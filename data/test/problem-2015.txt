“You know the words,” Voldemort muttered to Harry as he escorted Harry from the stone tablet to the knotted tree whose trunk looked to be in eternal agonizing pain. Harry gave a short nod. Voldemort spoke in a louder voice when they reached the tree, “Press your flesh and blood against the tree, Brother Harry, and speak to our Dark Father.”
But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual. Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague’s watch strap. …
“I understand,” Harry nodded. “So, let’s just keep this between us for now.” He picked the snake up and placed it on the table. “Come on, let’s just forget about it for now and meet up with my brother.”
Nagini yawned. She slithered onto Harry’s lap, where he rested, looking relaxed, content and completely vulnerable.
Something crashed on the other side of the door and a second later, the door swung open. Harry was grabbed, pulling into arms that seemed smaller and he felt rough lips kissing him as they moved inside. “Harry! Harry
The two Potters gave a sad, depressed noise and nodded as they finally opened their letters. It was exactly as Harry expected, a letter of congratulations of being accepted to Hogwarts and their school list. It looked that all they needed was to get new robes and schoolbooks. The twins went over the school supply list. “At least,” Niall said, doing his best to sound hopeful, “we have most of these books already, I think.”
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn’t even flinch. “We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” Fred said conversationally.
An elf came an hour later. “Wake up, please!” it squeaked. Harry opened his eyes and put on his glasses to see a wide-eyed elf wearing an empty potato sack standing by the bed, looking extremely worried. “Please sir, wake up!”
“What—no! No—I just, I can’t explain it,” Draco huffed. “I just knew at one look of him I wanted him, yeah, I’ll admit that but then when I tried I failed—a Malfoy actually failed! I couldn’t believe it and Harry actually hexed me. And just the way he looked infuriated me but also just kept him in my attention. Then when he gave a scented toy to Theo to add to his nest, it was so precious I couldn’t help it. Look, I’m not asking for you to hook me up with your brother, Potter. But I just want the chance. An honest chance to know Harry better. I’m worried for him—we all are. And I just want him to know that… that he doesn’t have to be worried about me, you know?”
Draco Malfoy was with his grunts in a compartment near the back end of school, along with a few other Slytherins that Harry always had the displeasure of seeing. There was, obviously, Pansy Parkinson, and Daphne Greengrass, as well as Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Harry found the compartment easily and did not bother knocking as he opened it.
Harry took this to step in. He opened the door and said in a confident voice, causing both boys to jump, “I find Transfiguration rather useful, Draco. Imagine being able to transfigure your body…”
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley and thank you,” Harry nodded. He quickly started writing as Mrs. Weasley fiddled with the dishes in the sink.
“Huh?” Ginny said, she turned to see Harry’s expression, “Oh gosh—no not like that, Oh god I’m sorry Harry!” she said quickly. “I didn’t mean—”
“As I said, I hate seeing a cute omega in pain,” Draco purred. Harry blushed and licked his lips. He looked up at the Alpha and decided to take a step forward. He got on his toes and surprised Draco by kissing his cheek. Both boys were beet-red as Harry stepped back. Draco stared at him and smiled, “Omega,” he purred.
“Of course not my pet,” Draco said, adding more pressure. He moved his hand down to around Harry’s waist and said, “Come along, you have a letter to write, don’t you?”
Blaise ran back into the hallway with Draco following him. Harry had to snap himself back into reality to make his feet move. His mind was frantic, his heart was all over the place, however there was one single thought that made him function: his uncles’ safety. “I don’t get it!” Draco gasped. “Shouldn’t Orion and Lycaon sense the demon?”
“I wish we can, it would easier if we can hex and poison her away,” Harry said, a high whine in his throat. The alpha and omega twins moved closer, hugging each other tightly. Both of them were hiding the pain they were feeling, the stress from the situation, and now, alone, they felt that they were finally allowed to let it go.
“I’ve just had a very busy twenty-hour hours Malfoy,” Uncle Remus said, “do not test me. Now. You will not barge into my home without permission, you will not insult my family, or any aspect of it, and you will definitely apologize right now to Harry for calling him an ‘it.’”
“I’ve gotten mine a couple months after my Initiation,” Uncle Remus said. “Lycaon quite literally just appeared in front of me from the shadows. Your uncle Sirius’s Orion appeared to him the day of the Initiation, an hour before it in fact.”
“You know the words Harry…” Voldemort hissed in his ear. Harry did not hear him come close. “You have the power. Say it…”
“For now, yes,” Blaise said with an authoritative command. “Sit.” Harry sat down automatically, crossing his legs. He didn’t know why he listened so easily, but it made his cheeks heat up whenever he did so. Draco, however, gave Blaise a suspicious look as he sat down a moment later. “Good boys,” Blaise smiled. “Get comfortable, close your eyes, and focus on my voice… there you go Harry, good job, trust me Draco… thank you. Now, I need you both to focus on your breathing. Concentrate on the air as it fills your lungs, and as you exhale you’ll feel yourself falling deeper and deeper into yourselves, your beings, until you find your magical core. Now boys, practice breathing. In… Out… In… Out… good job boys, you’re really doing well. Keep breathing.”
“Painful; your body stretches and turns into this... thing,” Harry began, “but I didn’t. I turned into, an I don’t know what. Walking dog? I had fur, claws and y face turned—but I wasn’t ugly, not like Greyback.”
Sirius pushed Fletcher against the wall, his arm on his throat with his wand jabbed in his cheek. “Do not joke about this,” Sirius threatened. “My godson is missing! And you think now is the time to talk about you?”
Harry nodded, “I’ll allow it. My father has left many treasures, mementos of his life. This cup is one of them. I want them all brought to me. These are my father’s precious things, he cared for them as though they were his own life. They will be enchanted, of course, dangerously so. However, I am not afraid to lose any one of you if it means bringing them back where they belong.”
“One more,” George said, and caught his twin by surprise kissing him. It felt weird, wrong, and totally taboo, yet he knew that Cedric would liked it, so he kept at it as the camera flashed, pulling away instantly. “Now that’s enough,” the Weasley twin smirked. “Shame though, I’m sure Harry would have loved this.”
“Alpha stuff,” Draco muttered. Greengrass just raised an eyebrow at that but left it at that. However, the people around her perked up at Harry’s name and started to whisper and gossip. Harry’s heart fell as he looked around. The school will know that Harry Potter slept in the Slytherin dormitories in an hour.
“You had a snitch,” Draco said. “One of Chang’s friends, Edgecombe I think her name is.” There were screams outside. Draco and Harry ran outside to see older Slytherins running around, trying to catch the students who were fleeing. “THERE’S POTTER!” a voice yelled, and Harry immediately recognized it at Pansy, “Leave the others and get him!” Draco immediately pulled his wand out and stunned Pansy as she ran towards them. The two started to fight the Slytherins as the rest of the D.A. members escaped until it was only Draco and Harry, along with Ron and Hermione. They fought off the Slytherins with ease, until Harry fell when a spell hit his back. Umbridge walked up to them triumphantly. “Well, well Mr. Potter, you have a bit of explaining to do, haven’t you? And you Mr. Malfoy, your father will be very displeased with you after I inform him of your rebellion.” She looked up to a seventh year Slytherin, “Bring the other two to my office,” she said. “Potter, Malfoy, you will follow me this instant,” and she turned around. Draco and Harry glared at the seventh year who walked up to Ron and Hermione.
“No, you listen!” Harry shouted, his exhaustion giving way to irritation. “Don’t you dare talk about your life like Niall and I will never be in it again! I’m not your Omega. I’m sad about that fact, I know that you love me and I loved you—but before I was your omega, before anything, I was your friend. You were our best friend.” He sighed and took Viktor’s hands into his. “I want you in my life, Viktor. You’ll always have a part of my heart, but I’m sorry it’s not as big as you hoped.”
“I’ll explain later. I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting—I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”
Harry shook his head. “No father, Pansy Parkinson continued to deny that we are related and that I am a slut.” Voldemort nodded and hissed angrily. The lower half of Nagini’s body coiled, the long thick snake pushing itself up until it was almost standing at five feet from the ground. The Slytherins all screamed and back up, Pansy jumping away as Voldemort turned towards her and hissed angrily, showing off Nagini’s deadly fangs. Voldemort turned to Harry, and asked
“Harry, can I hug you?” Viktor asked, his eyes flicking towards Draco as if silently telling him to challenge his request.
Harry choked on his food, coughing violently as he grabbed something to push it all down. He downed a large glass of water and sputtered at Ron. “What?”
The letter reached Voldemort around the early afternoon. It was a short letter, detailing Dumbledore’s instructions specifically and how he was able to add the Alpha Protein to Harry’s food. The Dark Lord was especially pleased to see that the letter came with a small package, which included the protein itself.
“He will sleep in my house… after my Uncles deal with him,” Harry said. Draco’s face brightened with realization. Harry shook his head and sighed, “We are in so much trouble Draco,” he said seriously.
Theo sighed and shook his head, “You’ll learn about it when you’re older Ron,” he said, patting Ron’s back. Harry chuckled. Ron just gave him a confused look. The three ate breakfast together, Harry enjoying talking with Theo, and when he was done, he stood up himself and smiled at the two of them, “I’m actually going to my husband now,” he said, “I’ll talk with you two later.”
“That is correct, Harry,” Professor Dumbledore interrupted. “Specifically, it is the first person active indicative. Where did you learn this?”
“Wizards,” Niall whispered. He looked at his brother and smiled, “Right, then we should like learn spells! Get another stick I want to set it on fire! We can use this to protect ourselves.”
The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked. A fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly into the cauldron. Sparks were sent in all directions.
“I think we should switch it to a weekly thing,” Draco suggested, “instead of switching nightly. It might be easier on everyone involved.”
Mr. Riddle was a man of the dramatics. For instance, his study screamed of his devotion to the Dark Lord. His fireplace always burned, on the marble mantle were several figures of the Fallen Angel as well as a rather gruesome painting hanging behind them, depicting a man with goat-like head and legs surrounded by fire and corpses burning around him, all bowing in worship as their faces show the most horrifying of agonies. Black curtains were drawn over the windows, a small coffee table in front of the fireplace had a skull with a candle stuck in it, and there were two more on Mr. Riddle’s desk. He refused to say where the three skulls were from, however it only took a single look to tell that they were authentic and human. Joining the skull on the table was a platter of fruit that Mr. Riddle had been picking at throughout the day as he worked. Besides the skulls, Mr. Riddle’s desk was neatly organized, there were books on the Dark Arts in one corner, a small bookcase next to the desk holding the rest, and a stack of papers in the other that he was currently going through.
His first stop was the girl’s bathroom on the second floor. He went to the sink with the snake on the faucet and hissed with ease,
“It was that thug, Crabbe,” Angelina said angrily. “he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d got the Snitch—but we won, Harry, we won!”
Professor Cornett, however, already seemed to know and Harry and Niall were arranged to leave from her office an hour later. “Boys, remember, you represent our school. Do not even think of doing anything that will embarrass Durmstrang.”
“Until then…” Draco said, inching closely to Harry until their lips barely touched. Draco waited a moment before closing the distance just for a second, their lips meeting in a chaste kiss that filled Harry with a new life. “You are very pretty, Harry Potter,” Draco said. “I’m glad that you are my boyfriend.”
The adults all stood and left. Now alone, Draco growled at Harry, “What the hell do you think you’re up to Potter?”
“By pure luck, it would seem,” Mr. Riddle said. “It was an open secret that Harrison is a Parseltongue. How this is possible, I cannot say, perhaps it is an aftereffect of his unfortunate encounter with Lord Voldemort,”—everyone except Harry and Dumbledore flinched at the name. Remus frowned and looked down at the table— “Needless to say, he simply followed my pet snake one day and found his way home.”
“Ronald!” Hermione shrieked. “Now insensitive can you be—no wonder Harry was worried when he told me!”
“We do, sir,” Harry said. “Blaise proposed to both Draco and I, and both of them proposed to me, and we will be getting married.”
Harry flexed his hand, feeling no pain at all, and smiled at Draco. “Thank you Draco,” he said sincerely. “I would like to write the letter now.” Draco nodded and he and Harry moved to a nearby table so Harry could write.
“But I wanted to zee Harry,” Fleur said, “It haz been so long since I have seen ‘im!” She pushed in and placed the tray on Harry’s bed as the teen sat up in his bed. Before Harry could say anything, she kissed both his cheeks and stepped back, “Gabrielle and I ‘ave not forgotten what you ‘ave done for us,” she smiled.
Oblivious to misty eyes watching him, Harry gave the twisted, perverted tree that will be the sight of his Dark Initiation one last look, before turning back and walking to his home.
“Alright, sounds good,” Draco shrugged. Harry’s grin broadened and lead Draco to his room on the second floor. As they stepped in, Draco couldn’t help but look around, frowning. “This won’t do,” he muttered. “The Dark Lord placed you in one of the smaller guest rooms.”
“Either way,” Harry said, fighting the growing blush, “you have no right to any of your actions. And you will not even get close to touching me until you start showing that you can change.”
They were in a circular room with many doors. She led Harry to a room with a nameplate on it that read
“That I have researched the Unforgivable Curses and broke them apart? Yes,” Mr. Riddle said. “However you do not need to be a user of the Dark Arts to break them down, just as Harrison demonstrated with the Severing Charm. We did not see him use it, or anyone in this room use it. He used his own knowledge of the spell and its effects, as well as its background and creation in order to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. Why should my research be any different but on a bigger and more detailed scale? I have looked into the Unforgivable Curses and what makes them so deadly and unforgivable both to understand them and see if a counter-spell is possible. I have done the same with the Patronus Charm, which is the furthest from the Unforgivable Curses as you can be. I admit that I cannot perform a Patronus like my son, however that does not mean that I cannot research it!”
“Fawkes!” Sirius said at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s not Dumbledore’s writing—it must be a message from your mother—here—”
“Nonsense, you’ll do them afterwards,” Uncle Sirius said. “I hope you like laundry and vacuuming event rooms, the boys like to use that as a sort of play area and hair gets everywhere.”
They extended it. She took Harry’s in her own. Harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings. “Tut, tut. I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” she said, smiling. “We’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we? You may go.”
She began to grab the necklace and Harry gave out a high scream. One hand went to pull his necklace closer while the other hand clawed at Hermione’s, slapping it away with such vile that Hermione stared at him in shock. Nobody said anything, however, as three owls flew into the kitchen, dropping a letter in front of each of them. The three looked at each other, anger and tension completely vanished and replaced by another sort of tension. Harry flipped over his letter to see it was from Hogwarts.
“She has good taste,” Ron hummed. “Come on, let’s find Harry and the others!” He took Draco’s arm once more, and Draco only had enough time to grab his drink and take a sip as Ron pulled him out of the kitchen. Ron waved and yelled out to people he knew, but he did not stop as he continued to search for this Harry. Draco kept his eyes open too, wondering what this Harry looked like.
“Sirius, please,” Remus said. Uncle Sirius stopped talking. “Thank you,” Uncle Remus said gently. “Yesterday has been just a repeat of the same argument that we’ve been having for years. I can’t get pregnant, but that does not mean that Sirius cannot. It’s just that he… refuses to try.”
he thought to himself, before falling quickly asleep, forcing his mind to turn from the potion to his lewd thoughts of Draco.
”—Loki imitated a vacuum— “up into the cube he’ll go with the nice couch, lamp, and window.” He held the cube out. The three looked at each other before Blaise reached for it, only for Loki to pull back, “Nope, nope, nope,” the god said in a childish manner. “This is for my lovely femboy only.”
, the shortest day of the year in terms of sunlight, started with a cleansing, soothing fall of snow that sprinkled down magically onto the town of Hollow’s Grave. The three boys woke on their wedding day to the sound of breakfast sizzling on downstairs. Still, despite the picturesque weather, and loud promises of a delicious meal, Harry found himself deadly nervous. He dressed slowly in his pajamas and followed his two future husbands downstairs, glancing now and again everywhere, as though Satan will spring out behind every corner to steal him.
Dumbledore chuckled and nodded, “Yes, it was a rather heinous office, wasn’t it? Harry, Niall, I wanted to come and talk to you two today to offer two things.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a large pile of letters stringed together. “First, are the letters from Viktor Krum which were confiscated, and the second, and most important, is an old man’s apology.” He placed the letters down on the desk. Harry’s eyes moved towards them instinctively, recognizing Viktor’s handwriting. His heart throbbed painfully. He wanted to snatch them and run away, but knew that if he wanted to be safe at Hogwarts, this talk needed to happen.
“I mean, Transfiguration is good for that,” Harry said. “We may be focusing on turning bugs into animals and objects, but we can work up to transfiguring your own body—maybe into a form that you find better suited or if our Lord needs us to infiltrate a place and we do not have the means to get a Polyjuice Potion.”
“Harry, I have to protest,” Dumbledore said. “I know that you are speaking out of grief but, you have to think rationally. Voldemort’s followers know about Grimmauld Place, at least with your Aunt you can be hidden.”
“Quite boy!” Moody growled out. “Wait till we’re inside!” He pulled the parchment from Harry’s hand and burned it. Harry heard a rumbling and looked up. The buildings numbered eleven and thirteen seemed to be moving apart, as a completely new building, looking just the same as those on either side, came into existence. The occupants in number eleven and thirteen did not look surprised or reacted as, right before Harry, stood a new building, labeled number twelve.
Draco only had a second to jump out of the way before he was run over by a speeding guy on a skateboard, falling on his ass. The man was, in a word, perfect in the short time that Draco had to stare at him. He was tall with raven black hair that just had a naturally messy look to it. He had a fairly muscular body, like he worked out at the gym every day, and by god his thighs and ass! They were thicc, with two C’s. That was the only way Draco could think of describing them! He was wearing jeans that hugged everything so nicely, and a rainbow belt along with a loud rainbow plaid shirt over a red muscle shirt with a lion. It sounded too stupid to look good but somehow, he made it all work. Then the man turned and grinned at Draco. It was a devilish grin that just leaked of mirthful mischief. And his eyes! Beautiful green eyes reminding Draco of emeralds or rolling valleys. “Sorry!” this mysterious man grinned, and he was gone the next second.
Halfway in I decided to make this story as gay as fuck. Why? Because I can. I don't regret anything.
“I’m fine in Gryffindor,” he said. “It’s where I belong. Besides, I um was supposed to be in Slytherin… but I had the hat change its mind.”
Uncle Sirius stood up quite suddenly and turned to Mr. Malfoy. “I would ask you, while you are under my roof, to keep your opinions to yourself, Mr. Malfoy. Especially if they are nothing but empty insults.”
“Can I?” Harry whispered to his uncles, who nodded. Harry wormed his way out of their hug and ran towards Draco, the two hugging each other. “Draco! I missed you,” Harry cooed.
“Stop,” Harry snapped. “We’re here so you two can shake hands and agree to be civil. If you can’t do that Draco, then I’ll just leave with Ron—”
“Young love is strong, yes,” Dumbledore spoke for the first time, “and I suggested and encouraged that Connor kept the memories of you, Harry, however I had no authority.”
He thought but he couldn’t bring himself to yank his drink away. He just held it steady as Harry drank. The taller raven-haired leaned back, licking his lips satisfied as he smirked at Draco, “Tastes great, but it could use a little hint of sugar,” he purred.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, placing his cup down. “I’ve forgotten my place it seems. Yes I am Draco’s submissive husband by marriage, I am rather submissive in general when he is around, but that only applies with my husband. To everyone else, including my father, I am hardy, stubborn, and I tend to speak my mind and do my own actions without others’ approval. You may think this is horrible of me and yet I am still here, alive.”
Harry fiddled as he stood in front of his bed. “My heat is next week,” he said softly. “I talked with Madam Pomfrey and she said that I have to bring parts of my nest into a special room in the hospital wing. So… umm…” Harry cleared his throat and looked up at Draco. “I want you to sleep with me. Not—not in that way but, I want you to sleep in my bed until my heat so that everything smells of you. Please.”
Draco patted Niall’s back awkwardly, “I was just doing what was best for my omega,” he said. “You would do the same for Longbottom.”
“Severus go check outside immediately,” Dumbledore said, turning to Snape. “Boys, both of you will get decent. I will take you both immediately to the hospital wing for Calming Draughts.” He turned to leave them alone, but Harry stopped him.
Harry and Draco went to Professor McGonagall’s office during the afternoon. “Enter,” she called out at Harry’s knock. The two walked in and she looked up at them. “Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, what can I do for you?” she asked. “Or, would you rather that I call you Mr. Riddle, Harry?”
“No, I did not,” Mr. Riddle said. “If this would make a difference, I do not know. For at this point, Harrison was known as Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived. I fear that the Ministry would not see me as a lost father, but as a greedy man clambering for fame and attention. That, and as I have said before I did not make the connection between my Harrison Riddle and Harry Potter. That connection was not made until this very summer where, ironically enough, Harrison found me.”
That night was the first night Harry dreamed. It was wonderful needy dream. He and Draco were alone, naked. Draco was inside him, moving quickly as both husbands were lost in a moment of pure lust. Harry begged for more, pleading the Malfoy to fill him, and just before both boys reached their climax—Harry woke up.
“It is no lie,” Voldemort said. “You have your dad’s eyes and my hair. I can see my cheeks and his nose in you as well.”
Back in the manor, Lord Voldemort watched from a window as his son and the Malfoy heir strolled around. “Of course,” he muttered. “I find my son only for him to find another.” He shook his head and turned to face the men in the room. “Either way, we have business to attend to.” Voldemort had his glamour on, looking as the monstrous dark lord that the world knew him as. His inner circle was in the room, watching their Lord carefully as the Dark Lord walked from the window. He looked around carefully, his eyes meeting each of the men as the combed through their thoughts. He stopped at Severus Snape, feeling his Occlumency barrier. He raised an eyebrow at that but said nothing. “Gentlemen, I have wonderful news today,” he announced. “Something I thought long since gone has been found once more. This week is a week of celebration, for I have found my son.”
“Don’t worry, Professor, we won’t,” Harry smiled. Over the years, he has gotten along with their Potions Professor and Deputy Headmistress. It also helped that he was one of her best students. She gave Harry a rare smile. “I know you won’t Harry, I was talking about your brother. Now, the fireplace is connected directly to Hogwarts. You will step into the meeting area where you will meet with Viktor Krum. Behave, boys, and have fun, Harry.”
“Tell me about it,” Niall huffed, “I got so used to your scent it took me forever to go to sleep. You’re lucky, you have your nest.”
“Did you know what you just did?” Draco asked. “You’re making my other cheek jealous.” He took a step towards Harry and hooked his arms around the omega. “You don’t want to do that, do you?”
“I cannot… I have other things I need to do,” Lupin said, glancing up at Dumbledore. “But I will keep in touch Harry, I promise, whenever I can.” He stood up and like Kingsley, squeezed Harry’s shoulder, “You’ll get through this Harry, you’ll see,” he promised. “Life is going to be hard for you now, very hard… but I know you’ll get through it.”
“Shut up Nott,” Draco muttered. Harry didn’t know why but he smiled at Draco’s reaction. House-elves appeared, along with food that filled the table, “Finally—you,” Draco snapped, “get more food for Harry! He is joining us. How long do you have?” he asked.
“Okay,” Draco nodded. He held Harry close and the pair went into the passageway that was under the tree. They were silent as they rushed down the passageway, wanting to be out of the cramp tunnel. It rose eventually and opened up to the Shrieking Shack. Draco sneered, “Everything here is disgusting, love, how did you even know of this?”
Dean and Seamus looked at each other. Harry could smell no scent from them and knew that they were Betas. Seamus stared at Harry hard, his hand holding Dean’s tightly. “Dean’s off limits,” he spat.
“Dumbledore is a bad man,” Harry answered childishly. Mr. Krum nodded, and he got his son’s attention. “Move, we are leaving this room,” he said.
Harry frowned. He looked down at his stomach and placed his free hand on it. “You mean to say… that I can easily get pregnant?”
“I KNOW YOU’RE GAY YOU DON’T HAVE TO BLOODY REPEAT IT!” Ginny screamed. Her nostrils flared angrily, tears gathered around her eyes and her face was just as red as her hair. She breathed heavily before taking a step back, blinking. “Sorry,” she said.
“Honestly both of you need to stop,” Hermione hissed at them. “She’s wrong and evil but—we can’t get into more trouble than we already are!”
“Ohh!” Blaise laughed, he smiled wickedly at Harry, “Oh just wait till that Potter! I’m glad I decided to stay here,” he said, turning to Theo, “this is going to be so much fun.”
Draco looked almost insulted for a moment, his facial features hardening for a second before softening. “Fine, but I want to hold you,” he ordered.
“Promise you won’t do anything,” Harry demanded. “Ron is still good to me; he was the one who told me about what happened.”
Neville’s face became even redder, but he nodded. “Okay,” he squeaked. “But, Niall, can you take your hand off my stomach?”
“Wow… I’m going to kill him,” Draco said seriously. He sighed and shook his head, “No self-respecting person would ever touch that place.”
“Fools each one of you!” Satan said, fire beginning to appear around him, its embers being sucked into the cube. “I am a God! Your god! The one true power that rules this earth!”
“Umm about the rumors and stuff—I want you to know that I don’t believe them at all,” Neville said. “I know that you wouldn’t do anything that they described, or that you were an Omega actually, until on the train. In fact, I can’t believe I’m an Alpha at times. Between the two of us, I was certain that you would be it.”
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide an the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through Ron’s central hoop.
“You’re wrong!” Harry screamed, standing up so quickly his chair almost fell. “You’re wrong! You kidnapped me! Not my father! Nagini found me one day after the Dursleys abused me, I was running away because of the article Skeeter wrote about me—the article that you helped write because you told her everything!”
“They were as expected,” Harry shrugged. He gave a smile and kissed Draco again, “I missed you,” he mewled.
Theo just rolled his eyes and muttered something they couldn’t hear. “Blaise, I think this Hogsmeade will be a date day for everyone,” Draco suddenly said, “smarten up and think of where you will take Theo.”
Draco looked relieved and relaxed in his chair, “That’s good,” he sighed, “so, can I ask what the Dark Lord had you do today?”
“Well woo hoo,” Draco drawled, “We are both queer, if that is all you wanted to talk about, I am leaving.”
“No… not a girl,” Harry said, closing his eyes to get it over with. “A boy. I was kissing a boy when it happened. I’m gay.”
mentioned about him. The only thing he was thankful for was that there was no mention of Greyback’s attack.
Ron nodded in agreement. Still feeling torn apart, Harry found himself drifting from attention. The first years came, the Sorting Hat sang, and Harry’s eyes drifted to the Slytherin Table.
He tried pulling up his sleeve again but couldn’t. He refused to look up, he didn’t want to see their faces. Faces full of disgust and pity, he assumed. Hatred and empathy, he didn’t want any of it. His eyes wet with tears. He continued talking, “I had to go under Voldemort’s wing… because I wanted Draco… I wanted to save Cedric. He killed Wormtail… and marked me.” Finally, slowly, with an agonizing pain that burned his hand and heart, he pulled his iron heavy sleeve. Inch by inch, his Dark Mark revealed itself, burning black against his skin. There were gasps, he could hear Moody growling to himself while Mrs. Weasley muttered.
Harry frowned but Draco gave a little sneer, “It’s not Harry’s fault she fell in love with a gay boy. Besides, we’re not here to argue about that or your relationship.”
“Mr. Garrison, was it?” Blaise said, stepping forward. Flames licked and burned away the shirt and pants he was wearing, revealing his usual leather straps and harnesses. “Tell me, Succubus, what are you doing here?”
“What am I going to do? What does she expect me to do? Am I supposed to hold her or something—what if I drop her! Or worse what if she tries to kiss me and I pull out her tongue and—”
“He was a violent alcoholic,” Uncle Remus said in a strange, monotonic voice. “I… I still can’t talk about all he’s done, I’m sorry Harry.”
The killing curse struck Macnair in his back, and the executioner fell over, dead. Voldemort looked down at the corpse and then over his shoulder.
“Are we now?” Theo asked. He moved towards a nearby bench and sat down. He took out his wand and made a floating fire. “I suppose we all are in some way,” he hummed, patting next to him. “After all, apparently we all have ambition, which is an evil trait at times.”
“Giving you a Bonding Necklace as a friend? Honestly does that Weasley know anything about being an Alpha?” Draco grumbled.
“We have a few ideas,” Voldemort hummed, “however nothing concrete.” Harry nodded and found that his mind quickly drawn a blank. He looked at the two and bit his lower lip.
“Yeah, I guess.” Ron said, though he still looked obviously curious, however he did not bring it up again for the rest of the night.
“Just eat your treat,” Theo said, “it’s cold, but I think I can last a little longer.” Ron nodded and pulled out his wand, “Watch this,” he said. He gave his wand a small wave and a small fireball shot out of it, dancing between the two of them to warm them up.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t paying attention,” Daphne said, laughing to herself. Harry shook his head and sighed before turning to Blaise, “Can an Alpha have two Omegas, perchance?” he asked.
“Can I come with you?” Hermione asked, standing up as well. “No offense, but I don’t think I want to be alone with them.”
However, as Wizarding Britain waited with bated breath for their saviors to arrive, Harry and Niall were packed and dressed excitedly to start their first year at Durmstrang Institute, a faraway school all the way in Northern Europe. The boys were curious as to why they were going there, instead of the nearer school Hogwarts, but both Sirius and Remus sat them down and explained that they both would feel safer if the boys went to Durmstrang instead and that Sirius had to use his family name to even get them a spot in there. “Hogwarts right now is run by a man that we thought we could trust but it turns out that we couldn’t,” Sirius explained. “Remus and I talked about it, and we agreed that you would have a much better and safer time at Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. But don’t worry, you have your owl Hedwig to send letters to us.”
Parkinson saw him first but immediately looked away as Draco stood up and immediately grabbed onto him. “He knows, he knows, he knows,” Harry cried out. “I’m so stupid! He baited me and I fell for it! I’m sorry Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Harry hated him. Draco could feel it. And yet, he didn’t know how to fix it. How to get on the omega’s good side. He heard Harry’s laugh and saw his smile and wanted above all for them to be direct to him. So that was why, after taking the entire day to swallow his pride, Draco Malfoy decided to do the most unMalfoy thing he could think of: he looked to others for help. He decided to go for the source: Niall Potter.
“And we agreed and realized that all three of us have feelings for each other,” Draco finished. “This was a conversation that we were going to have anyway, but the demon interrupted us.”
“She was one of the best when I taught the D.A.,” Harry commented. “So give more effort being nice to her, Draco.” The blonde just rolled his eyes at Harry’s little threat. “Anyway Ginny, I’ll see you at dinner, okay?”
Harry turned slightly and caught Ron out of the corner of his eye, standing slack-jawed. “Ron? You okay?” he asked. Ron did not answer. He just gapped at his Hogwarts letter.
He and Ron went to the common room and decided to play wizards chess. Harry felt a little irritated, his wrists getting surprisingly itchy, but it was manageable.
“Now come on, the ship leaves in an hour,” Sirius muttered. The four of them wore their heaviest robes, though it was a pleasant day in Britain. Harry looked quite lovely in his, a long emerald robe that matched his eyes while Niall wore a dark red robe that showed off his developing body. Niall’s auburn hair was short, only a couple of inches long while Harry’s was starting to grow out. Remus made a tutting sound as he checked Harry’s hair as he adjusted his robe. “They should have a barber there to cut your hair, otherwise I’m doing it.”
“You want my submission, Malfoy?” he breathed. “You have to earn it. The train was just my treat for you, you have to work for the rest of it.”
The darkness took over, and Harry took a breath before walking towards it, following the flood of red eyes. He did not know again how long he walked, however with a step, the darkness suddenly vanished, and he was once again in the basement of Malfoy Manor, and the Dark Lord was once again waiting for him.
Nagini said. Harry smiled at that and bit his lower lip. His hand went cautiously towards the snake, stopping halfway.
“That was an excellent display of wandless magic, Harry,” Voldemort’s voice said, making them both jumped. Harry turned to see his father right behind him. “Now, give him back his wand.”
“I didn’t want to worry you or father,” Harry said. “But I do want to have you all wrapped around my fingers eventually.”
“Calm down, Harry Calm down,” Draco said. He held Harry tightly and made his Omega inhale his scent until he was calm. Harry whimpered but was still crying, looking defenseless and the opposite of the boy Draco knew and loved. “My precious boywife, tell me what happened,” Draco whispered.
“I’m not scared of Draco,” Greengrass said. “Besides both of you are being stupid! Granger’s just a mudblood! There is no reason to be angry at me for stating that fact!”
“If that is what you want to describe it as…” The essence said, chuckling darkly. It’s darkness now overtook the whole room, Harry could barely see in front of him except for the everchanging outline of the essence’s main body. “Do we have a deal?”
“Oh? And what is that thing, my pet?” Draco asked, his hands roaming Harry’s chest, pushing his robes open and starting to unbutton Harry’s shirt. The Omega gasped as his skin was revealed, and Draco’s hot hands pressed against his skin, sliding to his Harry’s nipples which hardened instantly.
“No Sir, though I think the essence would rather not bond with me,” Harry said. “They like to taunt me, you see.”
“It’s just something inside me, I don’t know if it’s the Omega in me but, it seems natural in a way,” Harry frowned. “I want a normal relationship, believe me, but I don’t think that is possible now. I’ll try to keep it as normal as I can but, because of our new instincts…” Harry let out a low sigh, “I need to talk to Dumbledore about this.”
Draco pulled him up and into his lap for a kiss. “Yes you can, pet,” he said and winked at Harry. Harry retuned to his seat, but he didn’t feel like complaining anymore. The two worked on their assignments, Snape’s being so complicated that Harry barely gotten half of it done by the time for lunch.
Viktor stared at Harry’s hand. He watched Harry and Draco for a moment and sighed, “This is it, isn’t it?” he asked.
“Sounds like a good start, pet,” Draco nodded. He looked around for a moment, “Then we’ll need the books section, possibly rare tomes. Which is…” His eyes darted around before landing on a section of bookcases in the far corner. “Over here,” he smiled, taking Harry’s hand and leading him. Harry worried that people would look at them, however as they walked through the shop, he was surprised to see that nobody looked their way. They reached the section and immediately they began looking around. After a few minutes of browsing the titles, an old man stepped up to them. “May I provide assistance, young wizards?” he asked in a high voice.
“One more thing,” Niall said from his place by Sirius and Remus. “We want our letters! All the letters Viktor wrote to us—give them to us!”
The sounds of eating filled the room and Draco smiled pridefully when he heard soft moans at the food, “Draco this is amazing!” Hermione said. “Great as always, god I missed this,” Daphne cheered. “Draco please cook for me every night,” Blaise begged. But Draco found his eyes falling on Harry.
Harry dressed then went downstairs where he quickly got to work to make breakfast. He made a full breakfast for his Uncle and Dudley, Aunt Petunia only having tea and toast, while Harry was spared just a piece of buttered bread and a small glass of orange juice.
Harry caught a glimpse of Ron and smiled and waved at the boy, who smiled back before moving to the back of the classroom while the Parkinson and her gang snickered. “Look at that, the boy-girl thinks it can be here,” she sneered. Her gang and a couple other students laughed while Harry glared at her.
“Well, we can all catch up tonight,” Blaise smiled. “You and Theo can even trade Omega stories,” he smirked and smiled at his own Omega, who only glanced at him, unamused.
Harry found himself chuckling and starting to relax in the Dark Lord’s presence. He shook his head, frowning, “I have so many questions, how did you not realize that I was your son?” he asked.
They smashed together in a fiery kiss, their cocks pushing against each other. They moaned in the kiss, Harry thrusting up to meet with his Alpha as he turned his head to the side, bearing his neck. Draco licked and kissed his way down Harry’s neck, staying in one place and biting it, causing his sweet boywife to mewl highly. He needed Draco to mark him. To bite him over and over until he was covered by his marks, by his scent. Draco bit down harder and Harry moaned, his cock throbbing against Draco’s, pre-cum leaking out. Draco moved away, licking his neck and smirking at the large red bite mark that will bruise. “You want more, Omega, don’t you?” Draco growled.
Mr. Riddle chuckled, smirking at the robed figure, he stood slowly and walked around his desk. “Simple, I am Lord Voldemort. Leader of this coven. It is my duty and right to interpret the Dark Lord’s words… Now, woman, it is with His authority that I say this, Harry Potter is important to plans both His and mine. He is not to be touched.”
“No! It’ll be fine,” Harry tried to argue, but Mrs. Weasley did not respond. He turned to Draco, “I’m not dangerous!”
Umbridge’s beady eyes glared down at Harry as she croaked angrily, her arms waving pathetically. Harry grinned and stopped right in front of Umbridge’s desk. “I have a lesson for you, professor,” Harry whispered with great vexation. “It doesn’t matter who you are, you can be attacked at any time. You have to keep constant vigilance or else you’ll be taken advantage of. That is something that all Omegas learn quickly.” He gave a rough snarl and waved his wand once more.
“Well just keep it to hand-holding and kissing,” Uncle Sirius said. Draco nodded and Uncle Remus gave his shoulders a squeeze before letting go. The blonde moved to Harry and held his hands.
“He’s a lying whore,” the woman said back. “He shouldn’t be here—go away before I call the Aurors on you!”
“But I can’t sing,” Harry frowned. “And… out of all of these, Basics of Curses sounds more interesting.”
Niall had to be practically dragged away when class was over. Umbridge hurt his brother! His baby omega brother! He was seething! He wanted to slap her back, or worse, maybe just punch her. He was going to if he wasn’t dragged out of the room by Blaise Zabini and that Malfoy brat. “That horrible woman!” he snarled. “Touching
There was a loud snap and a house-elf appeared before them. “How can Dobby be serving Master Draco?” the house-elf asked.
“I’m sorry? But we’re friends Ginny, I wanted to tell you but I just didn’t know the right way to say it. Ron and Hermione didn’t know until this summer either,” Harry told her reassuringly.
Harry allowed the underlining threat to hover in the air, drawing out any tension until he had everyone’s attention and submission. “This will also be seen as a test of loyalty. With that said, let me see, ah, Gibbon, there is a shack at the edge of the property. Somewhere there, there is hidden a ring with a black stone. The ring is gold. Bring it to me, but do not wear it. You may slip it on only in front of me. Just to make sure it is safe for me to wear. Where are the Carrow twins? Ah, there you are. There is a locket, hidden in a cave by a seaside town near London. I must imagine the cave will be filled Dark Creatures and Magic to protect my father’s precious locket. So bring Dolohov with you. The locket is golden with a serpentine ‘S’ on it’s face. Let me think, there is one more…” Harry paused before shaking his head slowly, “This one I will obtain myself. Now, just to be clear…” Harry stood up from his throne and stepped towards the group, his wand in his hand. He stopped in front of the two Lestrange bodies. “I do not care if you die during this. If you do, that will be seen as a show of disloyalty to myself and my departed father. And any disloyalty, even disloyalty in thoughts, will be met with fatal consequences.”
The door closed and Harry sighed. He looked at Draco and asked, “How many of their families here are loyal to my father? All of them?”
Draco woke up with a splitting headache. Groaning, he looked around groggily, confused about where he was. He was in a half-furnished room with fairy lights ringing around the room, stopping halfway. Draco was sleeping on the unfurnished side, his belongings barely put away with only his laptop on the desk. He was wearing pajama bottoms and nothing else, his pale twink body on display, not that it mattered as the only other person was a redhead who snored loudly in his own bed.
The train started moving with a jolt and Harry stood up, stretching, “Excuse me,” he lied, “I’ll be right back.”
Uncle Vernon grumbled and looked around for a moment. “Fine,” he spat. “Then stay quiet. I don’t want to hear any noise from you while I’m watching the telly! They’re going on about some stupid American politician who died from a peacock and I do not want to miss it! You hear me boy?” He gave Harry one last look before leaving the room, slamming the door behind him. Harry gave a breath and went to Hedwig, opening both her cage and a window, “I’m sorry girl,” he said, “why don’t you go and stay at Ron’s until things calmed down?”
“Lucifer Morningstar!” It was Mrs. Weasley, her face red and wet from tears. “Light-Bringer I bind you!
“Not that much I am sure; my father loves blood rituals however he is not insane enough to require a lethal amount. I’m sure that even, say, a papercut of my blood will be more than enough. Along with one of my feathers,” Blaise said.
“What? It’s true! Kairi has no personality at all! All she does is just stands there and getting kidnapped,” Draco said, “She’s like a modern Princess Peach!” He went to the trunk of his car and started pulling out his grocery bags. “Hell if anything it’s a negative point in the series’ favor.”
“Will you stop doing that,” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who looked stockier than the last time Harry saw them, their butts looking bigger.
“Dully noted,” Mr. Riddle said, “if that is all, return to your classes.” The three stood up and Mr. Riddle watched them leave before giving a victorious smirk. “This is it Nagini!” he said, and from the shadows his wife slithered in. “Potter is to be married—the Dark Lord will visit him the night before and take his virginity as is the Dark Lord’s custom! We must make sure that in that union, a child is made.” He moved quickly to his desk, taking a pen and writing frantically on a piece of paper. “Go, get these ingredients. We shall lace everything the boy eats here with a pregnancy potion—two months of consumption will guarantee the boy to have a womb begging to be bred by our Lord Lucifer.” He stayed quiet for a moment to finish his list before handing it to his wife. “Go! Now!” he said, “There is no time to lose! I will make sure that Potter is pregnant, and his child will be our Lord’s.”
Theo, however, smiled up at Harry before looking back at the game. Harry smiled back and decided to relax in his chair to watch. The game continued for another ten minutes, with Theo becoming the victor. “Checkmate,” he smiled. “Good luck next time Draco.” He chuckled and turned to Harry, “Hello Harry, sorry about that, I had to beat Draco here. Happy birthday by the way.”
The next two weeks brought updating reports and articles about Dumbledore. For the first time in his life, Dumbledore was starting to get hate mail, however, that did not concern him. No, what was concerning him was the face, that handsome face that smiled at him like a demon from his past. Lord Voldemort changed tactics in order to win this war, that much is clear. He must be using a glamour, a disguise that brought back his vain beauty and fooled everyone, and it was working. Harry fell for it and learned the awful truth, and now Voldemort has stepped into the public and took control of the narrative!
“Well… we have Harry, yeah, but we always wanted a child of our own Sirius, and we’re not getting any younger, are we?” Remus asked. “I was just going to suggest that—”
Harry wondered next, but Blaise’s words took him out of it as they all held hands closely, standing close to one another.
“We will talk about that later, but for now, just answer, think with your heart, your instincts,” Voldemort said. Harry nodded and thought once more on the proposal. He was silent, staring at his wand in Voldemort’s hand, the long spider-like fingers slowly morphed in Harry’s mind, the flesh becoming healthier, the fingers shortening to more human-looking shapes. He found himself nodding, “Yes, yes,” he said a couple times, taking his wand from Voldemort. “Yes,” he said again.
“A French shop in the outskirts of the country,” Draco explained, “it holds the Darkest Objects and books that I know of. Father brought me there frequently during business.”
“Of course my love,” Draco said, smiling. He kissed Harry’s neck softly as he pulled his fingers out, slick-covered. He used the slick to lube his cock and pressed against Harry’s open and needy hole. He pushed. “Fuck,” he cursed as he slid into the tight velvet heat. Harry gave out a throaty moan, his cock jerking at the sensation of being stretched. The pain felt so good and he needed more. He could feel Draco’s cock press against something inside him and groaned as Draco slowly pulled out. “You feel so good Harry,” Draco breathed. “So fucking hot.” He pushed back suddenly, his hips slapping against Harry’s ass and the teen saw stars.
The two Potters missed Krum. He and a select few students were at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament. They were getting updates from the newspapers and Krum’s letters but that was it. Apparently, he met a nice friend there named Hermione, and Harry hoped that they would get along. Viktor left with Headmaster Karkaroff and the other handful of students in October, and it was now nearing the end of June. As with the other years, nobody spoke to the twins, and they just continued to be at the top of their classes, or close to. They covered each other’s weaknesses so that while Harry was horrible at Transfiguration and only decent at Charms, Niall helped him with those subjects as Harry helped him with Potions and Herbology. They were both great at the Dark Arts, both of them at the top of their class, and were ruddy awful at History of Magic and Ancient Runes which Harry thought would be a fun elective. It wasn’t.
“RON!” Harry yelled. Both stopped and looked at Harry. His face was red with a fit of rushed anger. “Both of you get out now!” He demanded. “I’m getting dressed. Hermione—never second guess Draco, understand? I can handle myself.”
The clothes shop, incidentally enough, was right next to the third shop that Draco needed to visit. This clothes shop, Draco smiled as he looked at the tight fitting clothing that fitted properly.
Uncle Sirius gave Mr. Riddle a look but said nothing. Mr. Malfoy smirked smugly at Uncle Sirius and commented, “It would be heartening, as well, to have two pairs of adults who can think rationally.”
“Good,” Blaise chuckled. “Would hate if my boyfriend lost his spitfire, right Draco?” he glanced at Draco.
He placed the dress back and then moved over to pick up an outfit from the right. It was a black suit with red rhinestones on the shoulders, designed in such a way that it looked as though they were bleeding. Just as the girl’s, there was a pentagram over their hearts, however in that pentagram was an icon of a sword, piercing the circumference of the circle. There was a tie that came with the suit jacket, as red as red can be, along with black leather gloves with red underhand. The pants were sleek and black as well, with no design whatsoever. “The boys’ is much more simplistic, yet still hold important symbolistic value. The shoulders look to be bleeding, carrying our values and traditions can be a dangerous task, my children. The shoulders bleeding is a reminder of the threat we’ve faced in the past, and the unseen threats we may face in the future. Next, like the girls, you have a pentagram over your hearts, showing ownership and loyalty to Lord Lucifer, however we have a sword to show that we are his warriors. We will fight and kill his enemies on his command and penetrate our loyal woman when he wills it. The red is to show sexual passion that warms cold winter days, passion for our Lord and for each other, yet always remember girls to save yourselves for our Lord. The gloves are twofold, the leather shows our dominance over the fairer gender while the red symbolizes the boiling blood in our bodies and loins that calls out for demons’ blessing.”
“I don’t know,” Bellatrix said, “I am clearly not stopping the wedding and I am useless here,” she looked depressed yet determined. “You sure I’ve played my part?”
Harry woke up hours later in a bed far comfier than anything he ever owned. His body jerked and he sat up to see that he was in a small bedroom. It looked more like an actual room than a cell, with the bed that Harry was sitting on, along with a desk with a mirror, a dresser, and a couple of chairs. The floor was wooden with an old rug and there was a window that overlooked the small lake.
It was always storming around the isolated island of Azkaban. Despite the fact that it was a clear night above Hogwarts, above Azkaban it was storming heavily, waves crashing violently against the rocky shore. Harry and Voldemort appeared inside the bottom floor of Azkaban, stepping through the darkness. It was a small room they walked into, a reception area with an empty fireplace and no door leading outside. From through the walls, Harry could hear rain pounding on the prison. He felt an uneasy dread in his stomach as he glanced at the handsome face of Voldemort. “Look carefully Harry as we walk through the prison,” Voldemort said. “One misstep, one bad move and these walls will be your home for the rest of eternity.”
The last letter was from the night before the trial. “NO!” Harry screamed, he was fully crying by now. “I—I have to write back! I have to do something! Draco please!” He was fully sobbing into Draco’s chest. The Alpha wrapped his arms around Harry, shushing him.
“Does anyone?” Niall asked. “They’re the most hated team in the league! Though, Harry did like one thing about them. They were very creative with their cheating.”
“That sounds cool! Yeah, I would love that!” Ron grinned, “These can like change colors too, so make sure to get that, alright?”
Harry could hear the rest of the school already packed in the Great Hall, the feast already underway. Their conversations turned to pumpkin pie and turkeys when they stopped in the entrance hall, horrified at what they saw.
“I don’t know why you bothered, I am perfectly capable of walking myself to breakfast,” Harry said. “I’m an Omega, not helpless,” Malfoy muttered something under his breath, but Harry chose to ignore it. The two left together with Malfoy pushing ahead of Harry slightly.
“Yet I also kind of love Blaise, especially with all our nightly meditation,” Draco said. He looked down and smiled when he saw Harry nodding in agreement with him. “Do you… can it work, do you think?”
He turned to see Harry walking up to him. He was just wearing a muscle shirt and dark jeans, which should not have looked good at all together but still did somehow when it was on Harry. “Going to Neville’s?”
“Wicked! I’m Ron, Ron Weasley,” Ron Weasley said, and he clasped Draco’s hand. Draco thought he was going to shake it, but instead, Ron just clapped it and slid his hand back. Draco stared at him, confused. “Uhh…”
He smelled Lavender Brown before he saw her. It was a really overpowering smell like a mixture of floral flowers and apples. Ron found the smell weird and turned to see Lavender walking towards him wearing her regular uniform and holding a basket.
“But they are not really your family,” the Dark Lord went on, “family does not starve others, family does not force to due impossible tasks…they do not hurt each other. Think, Harry, and tell me if those muggle are truly family?”
“Distractions?” Harry frowned. He stared at Dumbledore for a long moment and saw a glint in his eye. “Wait—you mean it was you?” Harry asked. “You were the one who told the Prophet about my Second Gender? And my relationship with Viktor?”
“I’m sorry Harry,” Niall would whisper on these nights and gently pet his younger brother. “We’ll get stronger, I promise. I’ll take care of you.”
“Riddle. Now come and if you behave, your fortunes will increase immensely today,” Voldemort said. “First, a simple set of clothing for my son can walk around without shame.”
He staged back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.
“Of course! Why would I support a person who wants me dead?” Draco said, as though it was obvious. “It is a waste of my time and an insult to a proper pureblood male.” Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “But yes, two weeks ago I’ve left my manor, and lived here ever since.”
“No, not the Burrow,” Lupin said, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry cautiously. “Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It’s taken a while…”
“Never lie, Kreacher never lie. I haven’t seen the Potter boy. Not that I want to see such an ugly boy—”
Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr. Weasley was in hospital.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at his friend, following him. If all the Weasleys were like Ron, he was sure that everything would be alright. Hopefully.
“So you will accept the Dark Lord’s marriage?” Mr. Riddle asked, raising his hand for the clamor of the congregation to die down.
“Yes but he is my father,” Harry said, indicating towards Voldemort. “I know he did terrible things; believe me I do. But we worked through it, it sounds terrible, but I can forgive him—”
Covered in his own cum, Harry was too exhausted to feel regret about his thoughts as he fell asleep.
Harry lowered his wand only slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move. “It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”
“I said let’s go,” Harry said, having the final word. He stepped out of the shop, angry and irritated as Ron and Hermione followed. As they walked, Harry was relieved to hear a familiar voice.
“Yes, yes…” the shopkeeper chuckled. He bent down and pulled out two jars in which slabs of flesh floated in. “They will do… for a price.”
Hermione still looked conflicted. She had a deep frown as he looked at Harry. “I—I don’t know,” she said, sounding genuine.
“As you should be,” Voldemort said. “Now, it is late, and we shall discuss more in the morning. Until then, however,” he turned and looked down. Harry’s gaze followed as he heard a hiss and heavy slithering. A snake as thick as his arm appeared and coiled around the Dark Lord before slithering to Harry. “Nagini will keep watch over you.”
Mr. Malfoy looked at his son flabbergasted. His eyes shifted between Draco and Harry for a long moment and his grip on his cane tightened. “I did not realize that I have raised an idiot,” he said. “This is your influence, Potter.”
The goblin placed his quill down and stared at Draco down his long crooked nose. “Key?” he simply asked.
“Nice,” Draco hummed, looking around. Harry saw this and frowned, “I know that this is probably not what you’re used to—”
The professor for History of Magic was a ghost named Professor Binns. He spoke in a low droning monotonic voice that quickly made Harry feel incredibly sleepy. He was relieved to see that he wasn’t the only one, but before he knew it, Harry spent the entire class in a daydreaming state with his head lulling against his chest with barely any notes written down. Harry couldn’t stop yawning as they stepped out, the breeze from the windows in the corridor feeling like the breath of life. “Is he always like that? How do you even pass his class?” he asked.
He moved away from the two teens and sat in a nearby chair. Leaning back, he stared at Harry as the boy struggled to catch his breath. “How did you know?” Draco said cautiously. Voldemort’s eyes turned from Harry to him.
“Then we better draw up wedding plans,” Uncle Remus said in a half-serious manner. “But first, finish your breakfast Harry, I’m going to go telephone Molly and tell her we’re coming.”
This caused Blaise to stop. “Warlocks?” he frowned. Looking down at the two boys he let out a sigh and shook his head, “This worldwide?” he asked.
“Yeah… yeah,” Ron said, with growing confidence. “Thanks Harry—I think I’ll go tell Mum, who knows she might be so happy she’ll get me a new broom!” And smiling, Ron ran off.
The Dark Lord stepped up and picked up the arm. “Ten minutes to cut off an arm,” he muttered. “Potter, you are far from him. …We will do better.” He threw the arm away and walked away. Harry followed him silently as they moved onto the next subject, which was surprisingly Transfiguration.
“No, I believe not,” Dumbledore said. “I believe that Lord Voldemort never held the ability to love.”
They walked into a bare room with their large cauldron full of poison set to the side. In the middle was a sigil of complicated design, a circle with interlocking triangles that filtered into squares and stars. Around the rim of the circle was a Latin phrase that translated into,
“I heard they have a Quidditch Pitch here, did you get a chance to fly in it?” Niall asked excitedly.
“Meditate just as you have been doing,” Blaise said. “That is only the beginning. As while you meditate, you are breaking barriers. The magical one that is holding your potential back… and the mental one my father’s religion has caused in your minds. Once you’ve broken those, when you can question what you are told instead of believing it out right, then your true potentials can start to shine.”
Orion and Lycaon followed him into the store, and the first thing Harry saw was a group of girls. His eyes fell upon the head of the pack of witches, a girl with a pug-nose and a doggish face plastered with makeup. Pansy Parkinson. “Oh look,” Parkinson said in a shrill voice. “If it isn’t the boy-girl! What are you doing here? Pretending to be a girl again?” A chorus of laughter followed her jeer.
The gang came together after classes were over, generally hanging out. Draco couldn’t help but notice Ron giving Blaise strange looks and decided to pocket that thought for later. They had dinner together, Hermione and Daphne dragging the boys into the library to study for a while before they separated to sleep.
Voldemort made sure that Remus was deep asleep before sneaking out of their bed. Wearing only a robe, Voldemort made his way to the basement where his precious Nagini awaited. He petted his Horcrux and closed his eyes. He reached out with his magic and soul, feeling Nagini and his son. A smile played his lips as he felt Harry’s calm composure.
Harry rolled up the scroll in confusion and looked down to see the shadow-walker. “Err… thanks,” he said to it awkwardly. The snake gave no reply, instead slithering back under the chair. Harry immediately got on his hands and knees to peak under, finding nothing.
“First, I wanted to have a clear understanding of your transformation last night,” Dumbledore said, “Molly has told me that you had a unique experience.” He moved into the living room with them, and sat down, “I would like to hear all about it.”
Harry found it was starting to get hard to juggle everything on his plate. He wanted to hang out with his friends, along with Draco’s, and add onto that, Quidditch Practice, schoolwork, and his and Draco’s experiments to see what exactly makes him able to get pregnant—Harry could be regularly seen stifling a yawn whenever he walks down the corridors. But still, he was happy. He had a loving boyfriend, great friends, a happy life. If it wasn’t for his furry little problem, and Voldemort, Harry thought that his life would be perfect!
A short stout woman with red hair walked out of the house, and said, “Come inside Sirius! Remus! Though shout a little louder, I’m not sure if the entire town could hear you!”
“You really need to learn your manners, Parkinson,” he said and leaned down to whisper something to her that Harry couldn’t hear. Whatever he said made Pansy’s eyes go wide and tears appeared. Draco looked very satisfied with himself and turned to Harry, “Come on,” he said and walked out of the common room. Harry followed, waving his wand as he existed to release Pansy’s tongue.
“Of course,” Harry nodded, and he turned to see his wedding outfit. It was a beautiful simple white suit, with a black undershirt to go with it. Harry dressed in it and sat in front of the mirror to do his makeup. A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door and Mr. Riddle walked in, looking at them. “I hope you are fully prepared, Harry,” he said.
“Yeah… we’re new,” Hermione nodded. “Ginny,” she let go of Blaise to hug Ginny tightly. Ginny held onto her and the two cried as Blaise walked them softly.
A huge smirk appeared on Niall’s face. “You like that Nev?” he whispered, squeezing his ass again. “You like it when a strong Alpha grabs you like that?”
“Ron, it’s just a date don’t worry about it,” Hermione said, shaking her head. Ron just groaned in response to that, causing Hermione to just roll her eyes.
Harry turned to Draco and took his head. “Draco?” he said shyly. “I just wanted to thank you again—for everything, really.”
“No,” Harry lied again. “I’m feeling alright, actually.” He fended a smile. Ginny did not look convinced.
They arrived on a hillside overlooking the ocean. The half-moon was shining beautifully over the ocean, the waves lulling gently with the soft breeze. Remus looked around and saw the moon. “Tom—”
“Ron? Are you okay, what happened?” Harry asked. Ron just groaned again. “Did your date with Daphne go badly?”
“Oh, yeah well I’m in engineering, I’m really good with my hands, you see,” Ron smirked. “Neville’s in some herbology thing, right Nev?” he asked, looking up at Neville.
light!” She hiccupped and gave another squawk as tuffs of dull-colored feathers popped off of her fingers. “What—
“No, I’ll do the trials,” Harry said immediately. He was going to be with his twin. Professor Cornett frowned but nodded. Harry was able to quickly outwit the ghost (he had to get to the potions table without the ghost noticing him at all or his shadow) and when he reached the Potions table, he immediately smiled as he recognized several of the potions. He quickly picked out the potion that would make the drinker puke as well as its antidote before being asked to move onto the next challenge. Harry lingered, however, taking a couple of potions and smiling as he mixed them together. “Mr. Potter, what are you doing?” Professor Cornett asked.
“I did not hear Nott’s name… shame really, since you have been explicit with Greengrass and Parkinson,” Voldemort continued. A cold sneer grew across his face. “Come here boy,” he said, holding out his hand to Harry. Harry moved towards him, more out of fear than obedience. His legs moved while his mind was telling him to stop. Voldemort just held his hand out patiently as Harry took painful step after painful step until he was close enough for his father to snatch his wrist and pull him the rest of the way. Uncaring, Voldemort grabbed Harry’s sleeve and pushed it up, revealing his Mark on his inner forearm, fully formed.
“They did, sir,” Draco nodded. “We are planning to have the wedding in the winter, near the end of December or early of January.”
“Funny,” Draco smirked. “I was about to say the same to you. Besides, it’s not right to bully such a beautiful Omega.”
“If I did, I pushed those feelings down,” Voldemort said. “Those feelings were useless to me. They’re still useless to me. Love and affection, they only stood in the way of my goals.”
“Don’t worry mate, I’m sure Hermione will come around soon,” he said, patting Harry’s back. Harry sighed and shook his head. He did not get a chance to respond however as the door opened and the rest of their dormmates walked in. Seamus glared at Harry while Dean looked at him with a sort of look that Harry didn’t like. Neville, however, stared openly at Harry.
“I know that! But—but I want him to be,” Draco yelled back. “I want him to be mine and I keep fucking up! I don’t get it!”
“Of course I am!” Draco said. “I bullied you away because I was being stupid, and I was angry that you chose Weasley over me! And now he’s most likely an Alpha and—”
Immediately, they got on their knees eagerly and Harry moved towards Draco who took his head in his hands and smashed their faces together. Tongues enwrapping each other, hands moving to latch onto the other, it was clear to Blaise that Harry easily let go all power and limitation to Draco as the blonde took charge in the kiss. Blaise hummed in approval as the two moaned in the kiss, their naked bodies pressed together, Draco’s length pushing against Harry’s smaller. The demon took his time undressing, revealing dark skin of muscle, perfected chest, clear abs with bulging arms, a huge, round, bubbly ass and formed legs. Hanging from his pelvis from a forest of short curly pubic hair, was a cock that was a little longer than a foot and thicker than a child’s wrist. Blaise’s pride and joy that he knew how to use very well.
“I am happy you call me Sir,” Voldemort said, slowly unbuttoning his vest. “I love an Omega who knows his place.” Remus mewled and moaned as Voldemort saddled his waist, grinding against his body as he took off his vest and shirt revealing his massive muscled body. “Worship your Alpha, puppy, and I might give you what you want,” Voldemort breathed, already grabbing for his pants. Remus whined and moaned. He pushed against Remus and moaned. Suddenly a hand shot at him, and Remus’s face was fully red. “You should—there’s something I need to tell you,” he stuttered.
“Fast working and efficient… you have done well boy,” Voldemort said. He dropped the dead rat. And transfigured the chalice into a sealed bottle. “I believe with this poison you have earned your lunch. We will resume in an hour. Do not look for me.”
Ron shrugged, “It’s true though, I’ve seen some of the homework Neville had to deal with and it looks horrible! I don’t get how he and Hermione can go after their majors, they’re like super difficult.”
“No, I’m horrible at Potions,” Ron scoffed. “Don’t tell me you actually understand what Snape is talking about!”
“Uh—sure,” Ron nodded dimly. Terry smiled, his cheeks blushing lightly. “Okay then Alpha, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
The rest of their walk to the dungeons was quiet. They kept holding hands, even after Harry’s tears dried. He led them through the maze, using his memory of when Draco brought him before. They reached a dead end, and Harry turned to face the wall. “Foxglove,” Harry said to the wall. It shook and vibrated, the bricks moving away to reveal a hole that the two walked through, still under the invisibility cloak. Harry brought his finger to his lips when Hermione opened his mouth and pointed into the common room.
“Of course, of course,” he nodded. Yaxley watched in silence as Draco paid for all the ingredients. Properly bagged, Draco took them and turned to Yaxley.
Umbridge looked as though she was going to scream, but instead, she just smiled and in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice she said, “Is that how it is going to be? Very well.”
“Well… in that case Blaise,” Harry said, giving a small smile, “I guess it makes sense for us to learn from you, right Draco?”
“I don’t know,” Harry frowned. “I have the rest of the month left with her. You only have tomorrow.”
With a sigh and roll of his eyes, Draco allowed his submissive to pull him back into the castle. Though Harry was still angry at Daphne for her narrow views, he was happy that he and Draco took another step in their relationship, and they can finally express their love verbally to one another. He proudly held Draco’s hand in the corridors as the two made their way to the library, and for that day, Harry forgot that he was the Dark Lord’s son, he forgot that he was the leader of an underground Defense Against the Dark Arts club, and that he was also planning how exactly to get rid of purebloods who couldn’t change their views. In that moment he was Harry, just Harry, and that was all he ever wanted to be.
“Do you think… that Blaise was right?” Harry asked to no one in particular. “He mentioned my womb… or at least the space in me where a womb can be formed. Do you think Mr. Riddle wants me to have a child with Lucifer?”
“At Durmstrang, we were taught the Dark Arts in order to protect ourselves against it. Naturally, we learned a few little pranks to keep the others on edge,” Harry explained. “Your tongue is cold, yeah? Act like a good boy and I’ll reverse the spell. Act like shit and your tongue will fall off, it’s your call.”
They took Ministry Cars to the station, and on the way, Draco looked at his mate and friends. “Harry,” he said, getting their attention, “when we’re on the train, would you like to sit with my friends?”
“Because it gives Betas and Alphas a sort of lustful high, it is an enhanced experience that is almost impossible to fully explain,” Voldemort said. Harry nodded, remembering how he could smell and feel Ron’s intense sexual aura the night before. “Is there anything else that happened, Harry?”
?” he asked, glancing back at Lestrange. “They all look deathly ill. Surely you will not punish me for natural causes?”
Greyback gave out a harsh laugh, “You didn’t realize? Those potions I forced in you were highly lethal! There was no way I was going to test them on myself, so I needed a body. And the Dark Lord so kindly and eagerly gave me yours. We figured dead or alive, you’ll be useful for something.”
“Harry! Ron! Wake up, Breakfast is ready!” Mrs. Weasley called out, knocking on the door. “Wake up.” She kept knocking until the door opened and Ron yawned at her, looking extremely groggy. “Finally,” she huffed. “Get dressed and downstairs,” she said, “We’re visiting your father after breakfast—and wake Harry up too.”
He stopped, however, to marvel at the only colorful display in the shopping district. In bright large letters, the store front practically yelled
Niall placed a hand on Neville’s stomach. The omega flinched but Niall moved so he can use his other hand to gently move Neville’s head so he can look at him in the eye. “Would you like to know the truth?” Niall whispered. “I think that you are the most attractive omega I’ve ever seen.”
“As long as you talk to that twig about working out,” Viktor counter. Harry laughed and smiled as the two quickly fell into an easy conversation as they went back into the castle.
“What do you want, demon?” Draco asked, “you’re ruining a sincere moment before my father’s idea of proper punishment.”
“Ron’s supposed to be here in half an hour, but I think you’ll be busy cooking dinner for a while,” Blaise hummed, “I honestly was expecting you to just make pasta and red sauce maybe some meatballs.”
“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it… and now, we shall see … now we shall know …” He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail’s arm and Wormtail let out a fresh howl of pain. The mark on his arm turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. “How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. “And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?”
Voldemort commanded. Harry soon felt Nagini wrapping herself around his legs before slithering on ahead of her.
Harry frowned and looked at Ron, who shuffled in his seat sheepishly. “Hermione and Ginny had a row,” he said. “It was awful.”
Draco was checking himself in the mirror before turning to Ron, who was spread out on his bed, “So what do you think?” he asked.
A man was wearing an expensive set of robes was standing behind them, bowing low, “Welcome to Twilfitt and Tattings, where you will find all of your clothing needs at no expense of quality. I am Mr. Twilfitt, and how may I serve you, fine gentlemen, today?”
“I would never touch that woman,” The Devil said with a look of disgust. “She was a means of making the boy.”
Draco thought for a moment before taking Harry’s hand, “Of course,” he said, “now that you’re a pureblood Harry, I can have you as mine, fully. Of course, we’ll need to train you to take my cock properly, but we have the rest of our lives to do that.” He chuckled, “And I’ll need to learn how to take yours, I’m curious about sucking too you know, who knows maybe I can make you cum with my tongue while you’re flaccid,” he smiled widely, “that’ll be an achievement only a husband can do!”
“I must say the kid has a certain confidence about him,” Uncle Sirius said. “If this thing is a long-term thing Harry, he might be good for you. Of course, no man in the world will ever love you like me or your uncle.”
Which was where Harry and Draco found themselves that morning, walking down the main street of Hogsmeade until they reached the inn. Harry found himself hesitating for a moment, but Draco touched his hand gently. “Come on,” he said softly and Harry felt his cheeks redden and his legs moved once more.
Harry could feel himself crying. He needed this mark off. He needed it gone. To be the person he was before this blasted mark! He kept scrubbing. The water steamed, fogging his glasses. Out of frustration, he threw his glasses away, a small cracking noise soon happened after. He did not care. He kept scrubbing. Then he saw red. He stopped and stared at his hands. In his deluded mind, he could see blood. His hands were soaked in Nott’s blood. He had to clean those off too. He pushed his hands in the water, rubbing fiercely with the soap. He was shaking, feeling cold despite the hot water. The water stopped automatically but Harry kept scrubbing. “Out,” he said hoarsely, “Get out… I have… to clean…” He scrubbed all over. Everywhere felt dirty, vile. He remembered the look of horror that was on Draco’s face and he scrubbed harder, tears falling freely, joining the water. His skin started to hurt, he could feel his nails dragging against it, but he did not stop. He was starting to feel the pain from the hot water and thought that he deserved it. He gave in too easily; he allowed his father to control him so easily. And yet that damn spot would not get out.
“I’ll talk about my husband in any way I want,” Draco interrupted, not even looking at Yaxley, and everything I say serves to elevate and praise my boy.” He started pulling out the snake venom, smiling to himself. “If you wish to continue following me, I’ll be also buying a very large dildo that will give Harry a proper pussy, although I’m sure that you will think that sort of actions is highly… unacceptable.” With the most potent snake venoms in hand, Draco went back to the counter and placed them neatly in a row.
“Of course, I wasn’t, Malfoys never are,” Draco smirked. Harry smiled and looked down as he blushed.
“Um, hello,” Harry said hesitantly, slowly walking into the room. “I know that this is out of nowhere but, my name is Harry. I’m an Omega. Your snake, Nagini, actually talked with me a bit—uh I can understand and talk with snakes, and she told me that you were still looking for your son. Bad men stole him away. I know that this is strange, coming from a stranger, but I would like to help you look for him.” The door closed softly behind him. Harry stopped and turned to see before continuing. “Nagini helped me through with some things, and we talked a bit about how similar your and my lives are and—I just want to help you find your son if I can.”
“Well, I’ll help you in any way I can Harry, you know that,” Niall said. “I’m sorry I snapped at you.”
“Did you know then, Potter, that the suppressants we use are based on the Dark Arts?” Professor Cornett asked. “A group of Omegas developed them—for their own safety—and the act was declared Dark by Alphas around them. And now they are all commonplace! But you will learn more about that, and other useful spells from Professor Barbanov. Before the feast, you all will be tested to be determined which of the four Semey, the Four Families, you will be sorted into. There are Volkovio, Korolvskiy, Knigav, and Skunchnyy. Which house you will belong to will be based on the results of these trials. You have ten minutes to prepare yourselves.”
“Yeah, about that,” Harry sighed. He pulled the blankets out and got out of bed, stretching fully. Ron looked at him oddly and leaned in, sniffing. “Stop that, you jerk! I know I haven’t showered since the day before!” Harry said, pushing Ron out of the way.
“Now’s not the time,” Sirius said irritably. He pushed Fletcher out of the way into the hallway. “I need to get Dumbledore.”
Draco snapped out of his memory and looked around to see everyone staring at him. “Sorry,” he muttered, “I was just thinking something my Nonno, my grandfather, told me. What were you asking?” he looked at Ron who was staring at him.
Mr. Riddle stood in front of the three, examining their hands. “You’ve told me that you have something of importance to tell me,” Mr. Riddle said.
“I don’t know,” Harry drawled, “I might be busy that day.” Draco’s hand moved to Harry’s ass and squeezed roughly. “Ow! I’m kidding,” he said.
“Honor? What honor? He is the Dark Lord, Satan, the devil! There is no honor regarding the Devil,” Lilith laughed.
“You did not turn into a werewolf,” a third voice said, “at least, like how I do during the full moon.” Harry turned his head to see Remus Lupin. He looked extremely haggard with dark large circles under his eyes, and his robes looking the most in shambles than Harry ever remembered. He then looked at his own clothes, which were still in perfect condition.
Draco and Blaise looked at Harry concerned but he just shrugged them off. “I have to write some letters,” he muttered. The two Alphas shared a look but Harry just stared at his half-eaten breakfast in front of him, no longer hungry.
The scarred words seemed to glow in the firelight. Harry’s face burned with shame as his three friends just stare at him stunned. Theo reached for Harry’s hand slowly, looking between both the hand and his face. Harry gave a small nod and Theo took the hand slowly. “How?” he whispered. “You told me it was just lines.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded. He stood up from his trunk and stepped on his letter as he followed Niall out of their room.
“Let go of me you disgusting dog!” Draco yelled, struggling. Fenrir punched his face and growled, “Shut up, bitch.”
When he was done, the dark lord left Goyle Snr. shaking in pain, impossible to stand on his own. “Now, as for the Department of Mysteries…” Voldemort continued, “tell me what we know.”
“Ron, Hermione, go and make sure everyone gets to their dormitories safely,” Harry said. “We’ll be alright.” His friends nodded and ran. Harry and Draco turn to follow Umbridge. They followed her up to Dumbledore’s office, where the Minister of Magic was waiting with a group of Aurors.
“It was a dangerous time, if people knew that I was visiting Harry’s home to make sure he was safe, Voldemort’s followers would have eventually found him,” Dumbledore said. “I had to stay away for Harry’s safety. I’ve left a letter explaining everything to Petunia and Vernon Dursley.”
“Such a submissive,” Draco smirked. Theo shared the same. “You want to be a submissive wife Harry?” he asked, “I wouldn’t peg you as the type.”
“Oh god no! I like living,” Harry said, laughing and grinning. Draco laughed as well as they reached the table and sat down. He took off Harry’s leather jacket and smiled when the same handsome waiter Harry waved at walked up to them, speaking with a heavy mixture of Italian and New York accent. “Harry! So good to see you again, how are you tonight? And who is this cute boy you brought here?” He turned to Draco and smiled,
Ron gasped next to Niall, taking his attention once more, “Woah, I forgot that you know another language,” he said.
“Well he certainly smells new,” Uncle Sirius said. “The thing needs a cleaning. I can still smell the forest off of him.”
He leaned forward and inhaled Remus’ scent. It calmed the Alpha immensely and he smiled softly as he found his eyes closing, and he too soon fell into a peaceful sleep.
Harry’s heart ached and he found himself reaching for Viktor’s hand. The young man smiled and gave a soft tug to bring Harry closer. Keeping a strong, but gentle, hold on Harry’s hand, he brought Harry down the marble staircase and walked outside into the afternoon sky.
“When this is all over,” Harry answered seriously. Draco sighed and shook his head, “That was supposed to a joke, love,” he said. He moved so that he was sitting next to Harry and pulled him onto his lap.
“That’s still bloody brilliant that you know how to speak another language,” Ron said, giving Niall some strange looked. “What did you say?”
“Ron! Harry,” Hermione said, “There you two are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you, where have you been?”
“It is indeed, Fred,” George nodded. However, Harry stood awkwardly, hugging Loki close to him as he felt a cold sweat take over. He shuffled nervously as he looked at Fred and George, an anxious feeling rising inside him as he couldn’t stay still. “I’m not a girl,” he muttered. “Please don’t call me that.”
“Precisely!” Dumbledore said, “Because you have love, Harry, you have a drive that Voldemort will never understand.”
The house-elves all cowered in fear before disappearing in loud snaps. Beside him, Nagini laughed as Harry picked up a dropped watering can. Smiling to himself, Harry went to the nearby bed of lilies. He got to his knees and examined the dirt and flowers before letting the watering can slowly sprinkle water. He moved slowly, wanting to make sure that everything got an even layer of water. “Did you know that these flowers have meanings?” He asked Nagini in English, looking down at the snake. “Like how roses are usually used for love or a daisy for innocence. Well, some flowers have different meanings based on their color.”
has been in my family for quite some time. It was built by my great grandfather, Alastair Yaxley for his wife, Lycoris Yaxley nee Black. Most of what you have seen here is a product of her care, as well as the care of all women after her in the Yaxley line. Everything you see around is the product of tradition, a proof of the importance of lineage, and the dangers of its collapse.”
“Y-yeah… look, can we talk about this later Hermione… somewhere where people aren’t looking?” Harry asked.
“I’m fine! I can walk,” Harry said, and to prove it he took a couple stride in front of Draco. “I’m submissive, not helpless Draco,” he smiled.
Blaise frowned, shaking his head slightly, “No, unfortunately I do not. However, I know how to find him, or at least I hope I know.”
“Nonsense you idiot boy,” Voldemort said, “As soon as I have my half liter, you will drink this, a Blood Replenishing Potion. And besides, the human body has 5.5 liters of blood, this is hardly a sacrifice for me.” Through the pain, Harry glared at Voldemort. The Dark Lord took a step closer, “More Harry, I need more blood!”
“Sod off Malfoy,” Harry said, getting to his knees and hiding his blush. Draco gave a harsh laugh and pushed his way in, Crabbe and Goyle following. Harry got to his feet and gave the two brutes a glare. “What are you doing Malfoy?” he asked, “Shouldn’t you be too busy bullying first years?”
“Which reminds me, Mr. Black,” Blaise said, “since I am tied to Harry, I will naturally have to attend this Academy with him. See how humans are messing up the magical art and meet this Mr. Riddle myself. So I will have little time for house chores.”
“Hermione’s in Political Science,” Ron said, scrunching his nose a bit. “You won’t believe the things she has to read! Let alone write about!” He took a bite of his eggs for emphasis and nodded. “Anyway this is no way to diss either of them, like I said, they’re brilliantly smart.”
The three of them have returned to Harry’s home, where they’ve immediately sat Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius down to talk about their plan to trick Blaise’s father. They were in the living room, sitting around the coffee table. Uncle Sirius had an irritated look on his face while Uncle Remus just looked completely shocked.
“I DON’T CARE ABOUT THAT!” Harry screamed, lashing out. “I WILL NOT ENDANGER ANY MORE OF MY FRIENDS! WE ARE DOING THIS TONIGHT!”
“It’s okay,” Hermione whispered. She hugged George, who squeezed her tightly, before moving to Ron and Ginny, hugging them as well. Harry hugged them as well and he and Hermione stood close to one another, Hermione’s hand finding Harry’s, and they watched as the Weasleys followed Professor Umbridge outside. They returned to their armchairs and sat silently.
“Yeah I noticed,” Harry said, “but I am today.” He sat down and looked at the two of them. “Draco and I are dating, he spend the summer with me and my friends, and now he wanted me to meet his friends,” he explained.
“Careful Harry you’ve only been dating for four days,” Uncle Sirius commentated. “Ow!” he winced, Harry turned to see that Uncle Remus had pulled Uncle Sirius’s ear hard.
“Harry, there you were, where were you?” Hermione asked, looking happy, “Neville told us that he has a place where we can practice!”
Neville seemed very relieved by that. He relaxed and smiled at Harry. “Thanks—are all Omegas like you by the way? I hope they are.”
“About time too, we heard Mum and Dad talking a few weeks back with the Extendable Ear,” Fred said, “apparently Dumbledore’s been having a real tough time finding anyone to take the job this year.”
“Very well, be sure to keep your studies up, Mr. Riddle. Your professors will all give you assignments that will allow you to keep along with your fellow students if your heat falls on a weekday,” Professor McGonagall said. “Madam Pomfrey will escort you to where you shall spend your heat on the first day in the morning, afterwards for the following months you are expected to go there by yourself.”
“What… what will you tell them?” Harry asked, staring at his mark. He completely forgot about it at times, so used to wearing long-sleeved clothing.
“Yes Sir,” Harry said. Draco smirked, his grip on Harry’s shoulder tightened. The ring started to glow, and they transported away, Harry feeling oddly calm as he stayed kneeling in front of his Alpha.
“Never, he died the moment I had my Harrison back. Our Harrison,” Mr. Riddle said. He took the few steps to close the distance between them and got on one knee, taking one of Remus’s hand. “He will never come back,” he whispered. “I promise you.”
“Nonsense of course they are,” Uncle Sirius said. “They should be! At least they were when Remus and I were here as students…” Uncle Remus nodded in agreement. The three went up a nearby staircase that turned into a corner and had a strange triangular pattern as it was obvious, they were going to one of the original pillars, but not the tallest one. The strange staircase led to a platform with an old wooden door that creaked as Uncle Sirius opened after knocking. It led to a study. The red walls were furnished with bookcases, most full to the brim with thick-looking tomes and texts that made Harry’s head spin thinking about it. The windows had black heavy curtains drawn, and the room was extremely hotter than the rest of the school as it had an enormous fireplace with a roaring fire heating everything up. Mr. Riddle was sitting behind an immense desk bent over stacks of paper. He looked up as the three walked in and placed his pen down. “The Blacks and Harry, yes,” he said. “Sit down,” he motioned to three chairs in front of his desk.
“I know,” Ron said in a low voice. “And it got worse, he said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he—Percy—knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to make themselves traitors to the Ministry, then he was going to make sure that everybody knew he didn’t belong to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and left.”
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry answered. “He helped me figure out that the Ministry was blocking communication between me and Viktor. Please, where is he? Is he okay?” Tears started to brim in Harry’s eyes once more. Mr. Krum just stared at the two while Mrs. Krum stood up, looking just as teary-eyed. Without a word, she pulled Harry into a hug which the omega reciprocated.
“Ron, relax,” Harry said. “You’re stressing over nothing. You’re going to eat, talk, and maybe do some kissing.”
With haste, his eyes darted towards Satan. He was still there, never moving, always watching Harry, his eyes burrowing further into him. “Ahem… I thought that I would never find love, let alone a friend. Being the only orphan… and being me, I was bullied and grew separate from all, never wanting to venture into the world for fear of getting hurt. Draco, you’ve changed that. Your love and friendship showed me that there is a world outside, a beautiful world full of love and happiness, and world big enough for you and me… and Blaise came along and that world became bigger. I moved out of my comfort zone, always being who I am, and what I found was beautiful. A world full of friends, family, people who support me for who I am. There were enemies, yes, people who hated what I do, but both of you, Draco, Blaise, you’ve protected me. You gave me love to survive a destiny I thought that will drown me, to survive a life that will surely kill me. So, with my vows, I vow to love you and love life. I vow to honor and obey you both, to be your loyal husband and take care of you two when you are at your lowest points. Through sickness and health, life and death, I will love and honor you Draco, Blaise… now and forever. I love you.”
Everyone else were already asleep, and Draco lifted Harry, carrying him bridal style the remainder of the way to his bed. He laid Harry gently in his bed and joined Harry. Being a little minx, Harry quickly pulled his pants off before doing the same with Draco’s. “Better, he hummed, hugging his body against Draco’s.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded and left quickly, pushing past the rest of the students, struggling against the pushing and shoving when he reached doorways out of the train, until he reached the compartment where he started in. Theo was the only one there, holding onto Hedwig’s cage. “Did you know that Parkinson tried to get in here?” he said as he placed the cage down and helped Harry get his luggage down.
Harry nodded, swallowing down a sudden rush of guilt and dread. He turned to the man and did his best to breath normally. He was an older looking man, perhaps fifties, or late forties with salt and pepper hair. He was a bit overweight, as Harry saw, and not the best of shape as he was already wheezing.
“Forget about Dumbledore, forget about anything,” Voldemort purred, closing the distance between them. “You are a beautiful Omega, my puppy, listen to your instincts, and do what feels right.” He closed the distance between them, their lips molding together. Voldemort felt the younger man melt in his touch.
“Alright, nothing really to complain about,” Draco shrugged. “It’s different than my last college but different in a good way.”
“I assumed you were going to be, I was getting excited by the thought of beating you but now it seems pointless,” Draco said. “They going to just kick my Omega off like that? Then I’ll won’t play. They lose the best damn entertaining rivalry they could have gotten!”
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
He thought as he stared at it. He shook his head and dismissed it before looking around. It was a little early to sleep, however Harry felt exhausted. He collapsed on the bed and looked over at the books. He guessed he should continue reading, if not for his own orders then just to pass time. With that in mind, Harry took his book and continued where he left off, reading about the many ways a proper witch (he just substituted the word wizard into it) can submit to their pureblood husband.
As if waiting for her cue, Ms. Samael walked in with a scowl on her face. “Shut up!” she barked, even though the class was silent. “Parkinson! Get up and collect the homework,” she ordered. Pansy stood up silently, glaring at Harry and Blaise as she went across the room, collecting homework. Blaise leaned back lazily and yawned loudly. “Who did that?” Ms. Samael snapped. “Potter! Was it you?” she demanded, looking at Harry’s way. Her eyes caught Blaise’s and she opened her mouth to demand who he was when Blaise gave a small snap. A dazed look fell upon Ms. Samael then she sat down at her desk, as though nothing happened.
“What?” Harry said, looking up at Niall, “I’m in pain, don’t say stupid stuff,” he groaned. “So hot…”
—I think the potion is working,” he muttered. “Look Ron, Hermione, what I’m about to say is going to stay between us, is that understood? Nobody will find out, they can’t. There will be times where I’m going to be unavailable, I’ll won’t be in here, no matter how long you look. I’ll be gone from ten to four mostly and I need you two to cover for me, say I’m cleaning elsewhere, distract people, do whatever you need to do, understood?” Both his friends nodded.
“What? I wasn’t going to harm your boy, just give him some ample breasts to experience how… exquisite they feel,” he chuckled and felt his own breast.
“Uh yeah,” Neville nodded. Harry shrugged and traded plates with Neville. He let Ron smell it and the Alpha nodded, saying it was clean. They started eating, and it was only halfway that Harry smelt something new. He glanced up at Neville, whose cheeks were blushing deeply red and he squirmed uncomfortably. Harry too started to feel uncomfortable as Neville’s arousal flooded him in waves. Harry's hand moved to hold onto his necklace, drastically shortening the chain length so that he could smell Draco’s scent and override Neville’s protein-fueled lust. Harry cleared his throat and focused on the food in front of him. When they were done eating, Harry smiled at Neville, “Thanks Nev, can you and I talk for a second?” he asked.
The excitement turned into anxiety and worry as time went on. The students couldn’t dawdle anymore and were forced onto the train by their parents. Those who took off from their jobs began to mutter bitterly, sharing looks with one another and talking about how stupid they were to be duped by “that one guy” who made them believe that the Potter twins would show up instead of taking their own responsibility. Some were even getting angry at the twins themselves. How dare they get their hopes up! How dare they lie to them! Save their world and then disappear only to not come back when they’re supposed to! It was very rude of those kids, they all agreed. They were supposed to make articles on the boys, talk about how they were sorted into Gryffindor, their parent's house, and all the good they will do for the Wizarding World! But instead, they were gone!
“Well, Parkinson fancies Draco, and I thought she was going to try and tear my sister apart to get him! But now instead she gets to tear you apart instead, or you tear her apart, either way, happy ending for my sister,” Greengrass smiled.
Cedric chuckled and looked at the two first years, “Thanks, you can go now,” he said. He turned to Ron when they were alone, “What do you want to talk about?” he asked.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Look, you had a bad date let’s move on and forget about it. What to play some Wizards’ Chess?”
“Hello my beautiful feminine boy,” Loki purred, invading Harry’s bedroom where the three were. “Thought about my offer to make you look more like me?”
“You feel so good Harry,” Draco moaned, “Such a hot pussy.” The three moaned, Harry’s hands on Blaise’s body, stroking and worshiping him with touches as he learned quickly he isn’t supposed to touch his own dick when being fucked. He felt the burning sensation boil inside him, the cocks rubbing against his inner tunnels and prostate endlessly, stimulating his pussy and body. Blaise’s pace increased, causing Draco’s to increase, his own hole exposed, he did not notice as a shadow overtook it, Blaise’s shadow coming out to play, thrusting an equally thick and long cock into the blonde’s pussy.
The two stopped. Harry turned around to see what felt like a ghost walk up to him, staring at the Omega with a lost, but hopeful gaze. His past’s ghost quickly caught up with them and Ron barely jumped out of the way before Harry was pulled into a tight embrace, his face smashed against large developed muscular pecs, a rough hand cradling his head. “Harry! My Harry!”
Voldemort thought. But the man was sly and slick, and so he did not worry. Instead, he gave Remus a sympathetic look and said “I did not want to lie to you, it burned me that I had to. But you must understand I just got my son back, my sweet little Harrison after sixteen years. I love you with all my heart and soul, however, I was still afraid, stupidly so, that if the connection between my Harrison and Harry Potter was made, then something terrible would happen.”
There was panic. The students started screaming and scrambling around, not sure what to do. Hermione and Ron ran to Harry, looking for how to proceed. Harry forced himself to calm down before yelling, “Everyone calm down! Leave the same as always in pairs of twos and threes, do not wait for the coast to be cleared. Younger ones go first.” Everyone stopped to stare at him. Harry stared back, irritated that nobody moved.
“Good, good, I approve of your answer, demon,” Mr. Riddle said. “The wedding shall begin once the sun fully sets tomorrow, I suggest you all rest, and Harry prepare for tonight.”
“Let me see that wet cock, babe,” Draco growled out, and Harry allowed himself to shift as Draco dropped to his knees, clothes disappearing off of both of them, and he swallowed Harry’s cock whole, deepthroating his Omega as his hands moved to play with Harry’s wet hole. He pushed a digit in and Harry moaned, his tail wagging in excitement as his skin turned furry. Draco moaned around his cock, loving the way his puppy feels under him. He kept bobbing his head on Harry’s cock, licking and everything his tongue can touch until, with a howl, Harry came and Draco swallowed every thick rope of cum that sprayed into his waiting mouth.
He ordered a whiskey when the bartender asked and leaned forward a little. He glanced at Lupin. Up close, he could see how beautiful the Omega is. His sandy blonde hair had bits of gray that looked too early to have, and his slender face looked gaunt and scared from the stress that made Voldemort frown. He knew that Lupin was a werewolf, however, it looked that he has been fighting it for years, something that Voldemort would most definitely fix. He had a nice body, but like his face, Voldemort could already tell that stress was having horrible effects on the Omega. He looked too skinny, too worn down. Not to mention his patchy clothes.
The six young adults all shouted suggestions and Draco couldn’t help but laughed. His old self loved being the center of attention. There was some sadness in that thought, thinking about how much he changed because of Theo, but now, with his friends, he couldn’t help but revel in this feeling and smiled brilliantly as he began to sing again.
Harry woke up with a start. It was the middle of the night, his room was dark except for the few moonlights peeking through his blinds and curtains. Squinting, he reached for his glasses as before him he saw a dark terrible figure, formless yet terrifying, its mouth looked like ripped cloth, there were no eyes, and its arms were skeletal. The creature had a misty look about it, as though constantly fading in and out of this world. Harry knew right away what it was. “You’re an essence!”
“As is war, but it still requires killing,” Voldemort said coldly. “That man was in the way, and so we had to have him eliminated. Shamefully, even after Nagini had to retreat unless she too was harmed.”
“No, it did happen, and we are paying the consequences, they are paying the consequences,” Mr. Riddle said. “Remus, I love you. Please just tell me how to repent and you know I shall do it. I want the Death Eaters gone, far away from our lives as possible. This is just a step of showing you my dedication.”
“Your major,” Draco said, “I want to know what it is, see if our class times will match up good or not. Because I would rather not have a roommate who I only see late at night and on the weekends.”
“Of course you’re mine Potter, you were made for me,” Draco growled out. “Alpha or no, omega or no, we both knew sooner or later we’ll get here, with you underneath me.”
Harry frowned, “That’s why,” he said. “I like girlie things like make-up, I care more for clothes and accessories than sports or dueling. And I’m gay. Mr. Riddle says that people shouldn’t be bothered by that however… I have a feeling that it also plays a part.”
Draco didn’t know how long he sat there staring at space before his senses took control again. Blushing mildly, he stood up and made sure both his suitcases were intact before walking into the dormitory. A very grumpy woman behind a security desk helped him get his key, find his dormitory, and after twenty minutes to take his photo ID taken. Draco thanked her but she just glared at him and muttered under her breath about buying toilet paper before looking back at whatever she was reading.
The scratching never stopped. Sometimes, there was a loud pound, like a fist banging against the wall but still it kept going on and on. The boys were too scared to move, too scared to close their eyes as the minutes moved slowly into hours.
Voldemort laughed coldly, “I know you are no whore,” he said. “Besides, I’ve no need for whores or omegas. I am more interested in who might have spilled your little secret personally.”
“You have the rest of the day free, however, isn’t that right Harry?” Theo asked. “That’s what you said, right?”
“Yes father,” Harry found himself muttering. He took the robe from Voldemort, and took off his own Hogwarts robe, putting it behind his chair before putting on the heavier robe whose hood covered and hid most of his upper face.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes, besides that, Alpha.” He sighed and looked around, though no one was really glaring or staring at him.
Draco was sitting with his friends, he looked happy, as though nothing was bothering him. Harry frowned a little, wishing that Draco could feel at least some discord of what Harry had inside him. The blonde, either by coincidence or feeling Harry’s gazed, turned to stare at the Gryffindor table. Their eyes met and Draco’s lips turned upright in a smile. Despite his feelings, Harry found himself smiling back, filled, temporarily, with a love so raw and passionate that only the young and naive could know it. He wanted to kiss Draco and be with him, to sit next to him at such a time, and yet know that he needed to be away, at least for tonight, until he was done with his confusion.
“No, I don’t,” Harry breathed. He got on his tip-toes again and slowly kissed Draco’s other cheek, “But I have an essay to write,” he whispered and slipped out of Draco’s hold. “Would you like help, Alpha?”
“I will Uncle Sirius,” Harry nodded. Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus kissed Harry’s forehead and sent the three to Harry’s room.
When it was time for the dance for Samhain, the three showered and they all made their way to the church to find that the other teenagers were already changed. “You two are late Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” Mr. Riddle said, “Go get changed immediately! And you! Demon… I see that you have been missing the past month.”
Dumbledore thought carefully. “If we can, it might be possible to keep the same protection on your and your cousin’s aunt’s home—”
“Not that type of carrying, oh bugger,” Sirius groaned. “Pregnant. Harry’s body is changing so that he can get pregnant. All Omegas can carry children. Well…” he glanced at Remus hesitantly, who smiled softly.
“And you did just that when you scented his plushie,” Remus nodded. “Besides, Harry will not be the only one who will go through changes.”
“If you are sure,” Dumbledore said. “Then I will be back later on to check on how you are doing, Harry, as well as to ask you for your help in a small matter.”
“You will move here of course, and Dumbledore will pay for what he has done,” Voldemort said, as though it was obvious.
Sirius sighed and shook his head, crossing his arms as Remus returned to the kitchen. “Harry’s on his way upstairs,” he said, “and the Malfoy boy is on his way home. Very polite and has a good familiar with him.”
“Just to do their sick experiments—they wanted to feed me something! I know better than to eat whatever they offer!” Ron said. Harry and Hermione laughed. “Yeah, you think it’s not funny when next thing you know your tongue is ten feet long and sticking out!”
“Really? Then you are way pass your bedtime,” Draco hummed. “I only have one more stop before I get that dildo… unless you would like to help me find one that is thicker than my arm.”
Aunt Petunia was standing in front of him, looking down at him with the nastiest scowl Harry has ever seen. “Vernon!” she yelled, and Harry heard heavy steps running down. Harry stretched his head to see his uncle running towards him. His face was already growing purple with anger and Aunt Petunia did not need to say a word for the large man to start punching Harry.
“No need to explain yourself, I’ll admit I did go a little overboard when I brought you an entirely new wardrobe,” Voldemort said. “It went so well with my Harrison, that I thought I could do it again for you, but this time as a surprise.”
“Well gee,” Niall said sarcastically, “who do we know that would want that? We know it’s Umbridge can’t we just be rid of her?”
When the twins turned ten, Harry’s heats started. He woke up sweating profusely, his entire face flushed and stomach cramping. Niall woke up to Harry’s groaning and yelled out, “SIRIUS! REMUS!”
“Yes, last night left an ill taste in all our mouths, Mr. Potter,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “So I will ask you directly: Why do you hate my son?”
“Exactly! Then we would all be in huge trouble,” Blaise laughed. “Trust me mages, you certainly do not want to meet my father…”
“Get naked,” Fred ordered, already posing foolishly. The twins laughed and giggled at each other as their cock started to grow hard as George got his camera to levitate in front of them, taking pictures automatically while the two posed, showing off their features, including hugging and pressing against each other. “Think we have enough?” Fred asked.
“And now he will never go there again,” Mr. Riddle said, “both because he is home, with me and Remus, as well as the poorly timed passing of Mr. and Mrs. Dursley.”
They kissed as Draco fixed his pants and smiled lovingly at one another. “We’re getting married this holiday,” Harry said.
Harry could feel a cold hatred growing for the Weasleys, and he felt awful. He mentally yelled at himself for even harboring a small bit of that feeling, but when he thought of how Ginny slapped him and the poison, and strangely Hermione’s insistence of Draco’s wrongdoing, he was reluctant to feel justified in his hatred.
His hair was getting longer, he noticed. It was a very light blond, almost platinum, and for years he always had it cut short and tamed, over his ears and above his neck. Now, however, his hair was starting to reach his ears and neck, and Draco kind of liked the look. He turned his head sideways to look at his hair better and smiled, yeah, he thought it would be interesting to see how long it could grow. His face was thankfully still clear. He had a few products to make sure it stayed that way. He had a slightly aristocratic cheekbones and a strong chin, however, Draco was always teased when he was young for looking girly. He remembered, quite grimly, one day when he was twelve Daphne chased him around her house trying to get him to dress up in one of her new dresses. To this day he still shivered at the memory.
“No it’s just… we never ate so much food,” Niall said in a small voice. Harry nodded along. Sirius gave a sad whine and reached for Niall.
Draco sighed and took his second shot. “Hand me the dark rum over there and I’ll show you,” he said, pointing to the bottle. He grabbed two red solo cups and took the dark rum from Ron. He filled the cups with ice and poured the rum into both cups before adding ginger beer and lime juice. He took two plastic straws from a cup holding dozens of them and used the straws to stir before throwing the straws out and holding both cups, offering one to Ron. “Dark and Stormy,” he said. “Enjoy.”
“Never,” Blaise answered. “We never lost our letters, right baby?” he looked at Theo, who also nodded.
“What? Are you going to use your Alpha Voice on me again?” Harry asked. He scoffed and winced as he curled his hand into a fist. “Just leave me alone Malfoy.” He muttered and stuffed half a bagel in his mouth.
“I haven’t been with anyone since Viktor,” Harry said. “That’s true. And I haven’t… had those feelings or urges since. Even my heat went away to just a dull ache that I could have ignored. But last night, after our little fight, I felt it again.” Harry’s cheeks were blushing red, he did not dare look at Mrs. Malfoy as he heard himself confessing. “For the first time since Viktor, I made my own slick... Draco made me do that and I don’t know what it means.”
“What? Throw away his muggleness? As if,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “He doesn’t have the courage.”
“Yeah well… could be worse boys,” Blaise said, giving them a rather joyful smile. “You could be suck with my mother.”
“Oh believe me mate, I’m freaking out,” Ron said, “but honestly I don’t think you want me to scream that You-Know-Bloody-Who is your dad.”
“Good, then I will leave you for I must get my robes blessed by all the darkest demons of the underworld,” Mr. Riddle said and he stared at Harry for a long moment, his eyes moving up and down, as though looking for something, and left with a satisfied look on his face.
Food appeared and Harry ate. He could feel people staring at him but ignored it. For soon enough, food was gone and Dumbledore stood to give his usual opening speech. Harry tried his best to listen, he really did, however he just did not know how to feel about Dumbledore anymore. He respected the man for four years now, and yet with his secrets… Harry did not want to hate him like his Lord does, however he felt that he had no choice. He did not want to pick a side, he just wanted to be with Draco, but in the process, Harry was afraid that a side was chosen for him.
“Alastor! You are not suggesting Harry do something so... so dangerous!” Mrs. Weasley said. “He is just a boy!”
His letter done, Harry returned his pen and rolled up the letter. He got on his hands and knees and looked under the chairs. “Uhh hello? Shadow-walkers?” he said. He looked around but all he saw was shadows, no figures or snakes. “Hello? Are you guys there?” Still no answer. “Umm well… I have a letter for the Dark Lord so if you can please deliver it?” he said awkwardly. He took the letter and placed it as far under the seating as he could into the darkest shadow he can find.
“Muggles,” Voldemort said with a sneer, “to think he had you living around their kind.” Harry was silent, and Voldemort went on, “I suppose the old man thought of you to grow a fondness for them. Have you, boy?”
Turning to the muggles, Voldemort pointed his wand finally at them. “You three are fortunate that my son needs you alive until the twelfth, and so I will leave you alive till then. However, while your bodies work, your minds will be dulled. These two days will be a day of relaxation for my child. If any of you attempt or even think of hurting him, you are risking your own pains. Not that it matters as your consciousness will be buried deep inside yourselves.” He chuckled and waved his wand. A purple mist appeared and enveloped the three muggles, all of them having a dazed look.
“My son,” Voldemort said, “it is time for you to repay your father. We shall use your blood, regain that which I lost, and together I shall introduce you to my followers as my son.”
“Yes Uncle,” Harry said, and they finished their walk down the cobblestone path lit by lanterns, up the few steps carved perfectly from the rocky hill, and to the great set of wooden doors that led to the interior of the Academy.
“A lovely idea,” Dumbledore smiled, he chuckled, “and I will expect an invitation of course, if you still remember your old headmaster at that time. It is good to have plans like that Harry, for the world’s horrors are never eternal. We will get through this, you will see.”
Harry did not know how to feel. He looked at his inner forearm at his mark. Before, it was just a black dot, but now a form was starting to come out, a thick black snake that started to wrap around his arm, it’s tail connected to a skill’s mouth as the snake wrapped towards it, resting on it’s head. “It is not complete, however you are still marked as mine,” Voldemort said, looking down at it. “My apprentice’s mark… held by you, just as it was held by Alphard Black.”
“If you’re done, hurry up,” Mad-Eye growled out. “Want to be gone before any Death Eaters get the wiser, or worse muggles.”
His pace matched Blaise, and soon all that could be heard in the room was the wet slap of skin the two moans and Draco’s gargling groans as Harry fucked himself on Blaise’s cock and fucked Draco’s mouth spontaneously. The overwhelming sensation caused his balls to seize up and with a high groan, he spilled his seed into Draco’s mouth, the blonde drinking heavily. Blaise spanked Harry’s ass as Draco pulled away, smiling with his eyes shut as the cum whipped all around his face as Harry finished cumming.
He stopped, there was a collective gasp and uproar from his fellow coven members. Woman stood up and screamed in protest while the men just glared daggers at him, Harry stood tall however, focusing on the Weasleys, on Cedric, on his friends and family looking for support. One woman yelled above all others, “You’re a lying whore like your mother!” and Harry frowned at that.
Like he told them, Harry waited until the soonest he could get Draco alone to talk with him about his idea. They were outside again, in the covered border of the courtyard. It was now fully cloudy, and Harry had the feeling that somebody was watching him. However, he figured it was one of the many students outside, some of which stared at him and Draco oddly. “So, you want to do more blood tests on you?” Draco asked.
Neville looked like he wanted to argue for a moment before he just nodded submissively and picked up a fork. Niall watched him eat for a couple of seconds and gave a satisfied smile before nodding to the others “goodbye.”
Harry stopped and smiled shyly at his father, “I wanted to show you how thankful I am for giving you a second chance father, so I decided to cook you breakfast.”
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.
“I will give you three weeks,” Voldemort said, not caring about the troubled, depressed looks the teens had as they were filled with despair. “You will first visit my oldest and most loyal of followers, Yaxley. Have your potion by then if you can, for it does not matter. You will go to him and beg for his forgiveness and show your loyalty to your Lord as you have done just now. That is all.”
Harry nodded and he led Draco and Blaise out of the room. Nobody talked as Harry led to the spare room next to his, all too lost in their own minds. It wasn’t until the door closed that Blaise smirked at the two. “Well, Harry, Draco, come here.”
Harry reached for his neck and felt his collar. Instead of looking embarrassed he just grinned with pride, “I know! Isn’t it awesome?” he said. He moved his robes so that his collar was in full display. “Draco got me this today.” Ron and Hermione blinked and stared at his collar, Hermione’s cheeks growing rosier while Ron just stared.
“Sleeping with Draco,” Harry answered. “I don’t know why but being at opposite ends of the castle felt horrible. Like my body was being stabbed with thousands of needles. I couldn’t breathe, almost threw up multiple times. I had to run out of the tower to get some relief. Draco was feeling it too, and when we ran into each other all the pain was gone.”
“Perfect! Now—about that trap! You’re sure I can’t convince you to harm Lucifer even a teeny, tiny little bit?” Loki asked.
“Oh, it’s not too far,” Draco shrugged. “A twenty minute walk or so through the woods. It’s easy. Why is that?”
Voldemort did his best to hold in his anger. They all did not know that Harry was his son, however they will soon, and proper punishments will be held. Instead he just stared at Bellatrix for a long moment and could not help but smell her. The woman’s obsession for him was obvious. She was one of three Omegas in his inner circle, and while the other two wore masking scents to hide their smell, Lestrange only puts on perfumes to amplify or compliment her pheromones. It was a rather disgusting display in the Dark Lord’s opinion.
Ron just looked at Theo. “All of you are stupid, stupid and vile and slimy gits,” he muttered darkly.
Harry started to move with Niall, but Umbridge grabbed his arm, “And where are you going, Mr. Potter?”
“Yeah,” George smirked, “a very personal lesson…” And before Cedric knew it, the two Gryffindor beaters lunged at him. He gave a yell as the three landed on one of the twin’s beds. “What are you—ahh!” Cedric growled. Something snapped within him and before he knew it, he grabbed both twins and with surprising strength, pushed Fred off of him while he spun around on George, locking him beneath the Hufflepuff. Sitting on George, Cedric turned to face Fred, who gave a playful smile as he lunged for Cedric. The Hufflepuff safely grabbed him by his shoulders and forced him down as well. Panting and surprised at himself, Cedric looked at both of them, “Is this what you meant by a lesson of dominance?” he asked.
He quickly folded the letter and ran to Fred and George’s room where Hedwig was now awake. He attached both letters and told her to bring the letters to Draco. He turned to see Ginny glaring at him with her arms crossed. “So that’s it?” she asked.
“He always finds a way,” Niall said, “Not that he’s the only accomplished Potter twin! I’m a pretty good flier, and I am the top of our class in Dark Arts—and defense if we had a competent teacher—as well as Transfiguration.”
Remus frowned and sighed. “I’ll bring him with me when I get the cup of water but that’s it. I mean it Harry when I say that you shouldn’t be around Alphas during your heat. You’ll understand when you’re older.”
“If I did it all correctly, it should sprout feathers and fur on Umbridge’s skin,” Harry said, “As well as turn her voice into a squawking ostrich.” Draco laughed.
As Harry thought, everyone was there because they were related to someone influential or famous. One by one Slughorn went through them, taking a shine to McLaggen especially. Harry did not like the way McLaggen kept leering at him as Slughorn interrogated him. He couldn’t see his hands, yet there was something heavy in the air. Harry wanted to leave as soon as possible, but Slughorn kept spinning yarns and telling tales of his old students. The heavy smell continued, and Harry’s stomach fell when he recognized it. McLaggen was aroused.
“Brilliant,” Harry smiled, and, famished, he began eating, plans for the DA, as well as plans for him and Draco floating in his head, along with his fantasies of what he’ll do to the Death Eaters when it is all over.
Harry nodded. He took the two vials of snake venom and poured both under the Dark Lord’s watchful eyes. The boiling water turned into a simmering toxic green. He gave the poison a few stirs, the toxic green color darkening, before he began reaching for herbs, adding foxglove, a poisonous plant, as well as mint and sage. The dark green color lightened slightly with each stir, the green slowly transitioning into a light shade of blue. Harry stopped, at a lost on what to do as he looked at the ingredients that the Dark Lord had provided. There were various mushrooms that Harry didn’t know the names to, as well as greens that Harry would see normally in food. He decided to keep to the greens, chopping them finely and adding slowly at the time, smiling as he saw the light blue lightening even more so. However, he was still stuck just before the poison becoming completely clear.
“Thank you,” the boys said, and Sirius smiled. He looked at them and stared at Harry curiously, his eyes shifting between him and Niall. “Um, boys?”
Their Healer stepped towards them holding two scrolls, “Have you two thought about names?” she asked.
“Truly tragic, yes,” Slughorn nodded, “and so we turn to Draco Malfoy. Here is a name that needs no introduction!”
Harry found that he could not dwell on such thoughts, for as the rest of his summer became desperately busy between cleaning Grimmauld Place and learning from his Lord. Harry kept his knowledge of Regulus to himself, too scared to ask, and the Dark Lord never once sent him on a mission, as Harry hoped, instead keeping him in the Malfoy dungeon where he continued his dangerous, terrifying road of the Dark Arts. Harry and Draco agreed that it would be best to stick to letters, and Draco promised to save his commands for their first day at Hogwarts, reminding Harry that “you still owe me Potter, I am owe my boyfriend’s submission.” August died slowly, September getting ready to rise from it’s corpse, and with it, letters full of Harry and his friends’ Hogwarts letters and shopping lists, and two special badges that would change the triad.
“Father!” Draco said, raising his voice slightly. “She is out to harm Harry personally! She keeps carving into his hand and—”
“I never thought of it like that,” he said. “I mean yeah there was a huge rivalry between us… still is I guess, but it’s more complicated than that. It really started when I started to read about Pureblood culture, this was also around the time when I was discovering that I am gay. I was experimenting, wanting to learn about myself and Draco. I guess you can say I loved him since third year and at the time when I heard about the Submissive Clause, it sounded perfectly romantic. Marrying your love, and having your love be proven superior because of your submissiveness, your willingness to submit. Obviously I didn’t know exactly what that meant at the time, but now I do and… I still love it, I’m happy identifying myself as a submissive, as Draco’s submissive boyfriend. I just haven’t been able to act on my wants till this summer. Voldemort returned, he offered to teach me as a way to get to Draco, and I took it. I became his apprentice; I was able to talk with Draco face to face—show him my love and submissiveness—and we started dating. He must have also had feelings for me, I mean we’ve been butting heads for four years, it’s hard to not have feelings for a rival like that. After that, everything basically fell into place… and just recently I’ve became a pureblood.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Draco said and he pulled Harry away from her. They made their way to the spiral staircase. As if going through a secret entrance, they arrived at a floor that Harry never noticed from the first one. This floor again had the same layout and same elaborate ceiling art, however the floor only edged around the walls, about ten feet out, leaving room to walk and to have some shelves and reading tables. The edge had a wooden banister and over it Harry could clearly see the second floor and, looking up, he could swear he could see four more floors. The two walked towards the nearest shelf and Harry pointed to a gold plaque on the dark wood with a very fancy
“We were wondering why, if it’s because he has a top energy or a bottom energy, but didn’t seem right to ask him directly,” Zabini shrugged. “Thankfully, you’re here, and thankfully Draco is a top.”
Harry nodded and took out the dishes Blaise and Neville had. They were a mishmash from different sets but all the same size, but it worked for Blaise and Neville, and Draco couldn’t help but admit that they had a strange homey feeling. Something that he never felt when he was living with his parents. They would always have the cleanest, fanciest china with not a speck on them, and if there was his mother would have thrown the whole set out and buy a new one. Draco shook his head and pushed those thoughts away. He wasn’t there. He was free with his friends.
“No,” Remus said. “My husband has been sent to Azkaban without a trial, and my godchildren were sent to live with their muggle relatives who treat them horribly instead of to me. What I want you to do is simply get Sirius cleared of all charges as well as get the needed paperwork to have rightful custody of Niall and Harry Potter to me and Sirius.”
he thought. He allowed the water to become hotter, the water slowly filling the tub. Harry scooped the water and got his arm wet.
“I gave a speech, a very hurtful, hateful speech towards his followers,” Harry said. “Draco and I fled to France for some time, and we came up with a plan. We were returning when Voldemort caught us. He forced our plan out of us, as well as the list of Death Eaters. He decided to show mercy.” A disgusting sneer appeared on Harry’s face, any weakness left him as a fit of venomous anger filled him. “He summoned Theo’s dad, Theo’s a friend of Draco and me. He came, obviously, they always come to that monster’s summon. He had… he ordered me to kill Theo’s dad. I refused. So he… he used the Imperius Curse on me. I tried to fight it, but he was too powerful. I can still feel him inside me, crawling on my skin … I can hear his whispers in my head. Telling me to relax, to obey and to kill. I… I watched my hand bring my wand out and point it at Mr. Nott. I killed him…I killed my friend’s dad. And I felt happy during it like I didn’t have a care in the world. And then he released me and sickness flooded back in…”
“That’s good Mrs. Potter keep going, the head is crowning now,” The Healer said. Lily kept screaming as the pain kept intensifying. James kept uttering nonsense and she just wanted her babies. With one final push five minutes later, a second cry joined her firstborn. “A beautiful boy!” the Healer said. “A beautiful Omega boy.”
“Sorry I yelled at you,” Harry sighed. The two gave each other an awkward hug and Harry rested against Niall’s chest. “I suppose we should stop doing this, huh? Especially with Neville in your picture.”
And on it went. Again and again, the boys wrote the words on the parchment in what Harry soon came to realize was not ink, but their own blood. And again and again, the words were cut into the back of their hands, healed, and then reappeared the next time they set quill to parchment.
“Of course Harry, I’ll always move at your pace,” Draco vowed. He looked at Blaise and held out his hand. Blaise gave him the photograph and he pocketed it. “But please, allow me to heal your hand, even if it is just a little. It hurts my heart to see an omega in pain.”
Harry returned to the Slytherin common room to find Draco waiting there with his parfait and two cups of tea. Draco stood up as Harry walked towards him and his eyes immediately went to Harry’s hand. “Would you mind if I?” he asked softly.
The thought went around and around in his head as he went around and around the corridors. After he passed the wall a third time, he stopped as a small wooden ordinary door appeared. Draco looked around, making sure no one was watching him, and he walked in.
“He works for Dumbledore as well,” Draco said. “Sixteen is enough Harry, no more.” And to emphasize his point, Draco closed the book and placed the quill down. Harry looked like he wanted to argue more but relented.
“Uh… sure,” Ron said, feeling both confused but relieved. Daphne smiled and stretched, “Great, then in that case pass the pancakes and more sausage. You would not believe how much I have to watch what I eat when I’m around them, Blaise thinks everything is a sexual innuendo, and I mean everything. Even a pancake.”
Professor McGonagall looked at Harry next, “Potter… Potter… Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration… all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?”
“I feel really good like this,” Draco smiled. Blaise ruffled Draco’s hair, “Good boy,” he said. Draco finished licking Harry’s taint and ass cheeks and moved away. Blaise looked at Harry and winked, “We should clean our boyfriend up,” he said, “he is such a mess.”
“Ms. Samael? She’s just bitchy,” Draco sighed. “But no, the other teachers are not as rude as her… expect maybe Mr. Snape. But let’s see… can I see your schedule oh boyfriend of mine?”
“Then, I must be a vile and slimy git then, since I am not stupid,” Theo said, “I also must then just be slimy, since I did tell Draco about that song, who did give you and Harry prior warning, though it was inefficient.”
“Well, first the doves up there didn’t believe me when I said that He’s my grandfather, and second Samhain is my father’s favorite holiday. I want to make sure he does nothing today,” Blaise said.
“Would that be enough time for them to recover from being surrounded by Dementors?” Harry asked. “It was horrible there Draco, it took everything I had not to summon my Patronus.”
“No!” Niall said immediately. “Baby you’re perfect!” He moved closer still. “I mean, you don’t need to force yourself to change just because you’re not like other Omegas. Look at my brother! He is far from any other Omega I know.”
The couple decided to spend their first break together, Draco dragging Harry to the library so he had some motivation to work on his Ancient Runes assignment. Whispers and glances followed them everywhere they went, and Harry found that he cared about them less and less. They were just a normal couple going to the library to do homework—who cares if he’s ‘The Chosen One’ and Draco is a Slytherin! Or that they’re both boys!
“I will,” Harry said, “In the meantime, make sure to have your account all written, I want to send everything to Mr. Malfoy as soon as we have it.”
He dreaded the news and reaction that will undoubtedly follow this. He did not want to face them and wished that everything would go away. But they didn’t. He was still there, a single ‘ruined’ Omega, sitting in oversized secondhand clothes, in a house that did not love him. He wished he could go away, far away, but that would never happen. Dumbledore ordered him to stay, and so Harry will, by force if need be. Physically and emotionally exhausted, Harry slipped the clothes off of him, putting on pajamas and crawled into his bed, where even his covers were thin and falling apart. Shivering from either coldness or sadness, the Omega swallowed heavily to fight back the empty tears and fell asleep. He was not aware of the snake still watching him, now in his very own room, and silently, the snake wider than his wrist slithered away, happy about all the new stuff she was going to tell her Master about her new little snake.
Satisfied with his answer, Mr. Riddle turned back to Harry. “Have you seen anything strange tonight? Anything weird phenomenon that would help explain your hand?”
“Remus Lupin, I was good friends with both Lily and James, as well as Harry’s godfather with my husband Sirius Black. Now I am… I am in a relationship with Tom Riddle. Sirius and I, we both visited Lily and James the day after they got Harry. Dumbledore delivered him personally in the middle of the night. It was him and one other person I cannot remember, I am sorry. Point is that Dumbledore gave Harry to Lily and James, who at the time were having trouble having a child of their own, and told them that his parents died tragically. They gave him his new name, and we all loved him, none more than Lily and James.”
“Ask Terry out! He’s too good for me, too cute and everything,” Ron groaned. “I’ll never find a mate, mate… uhh Omega, mate.”
“What do… what do you mean?” Harry asked. Voldemort walked to his chair with his wand and waved it, turning it to face Harry, with another wave a low couch appeared. Voldemort motioned for Harry to move there, which the boy did, collapsing on the pillows, laying with his face towards Voldemort.
Leaving the man to follow him, Voldemort made his way to the fitting room, stopping when he heard his son’s voice.
“I stand by my decision, at the time the Dursleys were the safest place to place young Harry,” Dumbledore said. However, it looked as though the crowd was starting to disagree with him. There were murmurs and disappointing looks aimed at Dumbledore’s way. The Minister stood once more, and the murmurs die.
“Neville, you don’t need to do that,” Harry smiled. “I honestly don’t care about this war anymore. It doesn’t even concern us, we’re just underaged students. But—” Harry thought for a moment. He mentally sighed, seeing only one way that he could work out of this, as well as do what his father commands. “I would like you to do something for me,” he said.
Soon, the stands in the Quidditch Stadium was full. Students filled the air with cheers as both teams mounted their brooms and, at the sound of Madam Hooch’s whistle, they were off!
Niall pouted but agreed. He went and got a glass and filled it himself before walking out of the kitchen, Remus hurrying to follow him. The older Potter knocked on Harry’s door before opening it. “Harry?”
“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them. “When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff—maybe even Patronuses.”
“Not to mention you would be the perfect son-in-law,” Mr. Krum continued. “So honest and polite—and the only one who can keep our Viktor on the good path. Way better than any of these British Omegas.”
“A Gladiolus is strength. Strength of character, honor, and conviction,” Harry explained. “Black tulips mean strength too while the others are for friendship.”
“This isn’t my classroom, so I don’t feel like helping,” Draco shrugged. He moved to the nearest chair and sat down. Harry sighed and began taking down the baubles when an idea popped inside his head.
The mood of the room changed. Blaise had a cocky look about him as he reached for the two teens, circling his arms around their waist. He kissed Draco first, both boys moaning passionately before he moved his head to kiss Harry, his tongue slipping inside the smaller teen’s. “Well boyfriends,” Blaise chuckled, his hands moving downwards and grabbing both of their butts, “I think there are some more things I can teach you two today. That is, if you want it.”
“Why do you have something you’re not going to share with Dumbledore?” Ron frowned, “isn’t the point that you are figuring this all out together?”
“Give me the receipts NOW!” Voldemort demanded, and in his rage he waved his wand and shattered several jars, their contents spilling and catching fire. The man jumped and ran off saying meekly, “Okay! Okay!”
With everyone seated, Voldemort looked at each one slowly, allowing the tension in the room to slowly rise. He enjoyed how much they feared him. When he spoke, he spoke with an unemotional voice that demanded no resistance, not arguing, and total attention. “I have called you, to inform you all of an important development,” he began. “While our allies are gathering our forces, I have been working on my own private experiment. One, I am glad to report, that has resulted fruitfully.
“Then I’ll cook,” Draco said simply. “I’m assuming there’s a decent grocer or food market around here, I’ll get what I need during the day and come to your place around four to start cooking.”
Harry shrugged, “I’ll be honest, I don’t agree with my dad’s ideology, in fact I’m completely against it. However, if going along with it for now gets me where I want to be, then so be it.”
This confirmed it. His father killed Fred. Lord Voldemort killed Fred. From the bite marks, Harry could assume that it was Nagini would attacked and killed his friend. Harry had to clasp his hand over his mouth to muffle his furious scream. He wanted to hit something, someone. He wanted this anger out of him. But he knew that now wasn’t the time. He had to mourn Fred. He had to tell Draco, tell Theo, what happened. With this in mind, Harry went to his trunk, pulled out his invisibility cloak, and ran down back to Hermione.
“This is quite unorthodox, I was not informed that I would be needed to testify,” Professor McGonagall said, “however yes it is true. Mr. Riddle visited Hogwarts several times in preparation for this trial, and each time he interviewed one of the staff, I accompanied him. One of the staff members he talked with has been our own groundskeeper and keeper of the keys, Rubeus Hagrid.” She sat back down as the crowd exploded in yells and comments.
Harry grinned and twirled his wand as he stepped towards Professor Umbridge. “Not even a blocking spell, Professor?” he taunted. “All I did was a little spell, a second-year could have easily blocked it.”
“But you did, even though it was neither of our faults,” Harry sighed. “Yet another way of how Dumbledore meddled in my life.” He sounded more annoyed instead of sad. He hugged Viktor and said, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry that Dumbledore ruined everything between us, and I’m sorry for everything that happened. I loved you, Viktor. I really did.”
Harry’s heart sank. He found that he couldn’t move at all, even though he tried to run. “Blaise,” he said, “What’s going on?”
“Got it,” Cedric smiled. He followed Mrs. Weasley’s directions, and found himself on the second floor, standing by an open door. Inside was a room full of small crates and bags full of what looked like joke products and materials. Cedric walked in and noticed the twins hunched over one particular box, whispering to themselves. He knocked on the door and smiled when the twins looked at him, “Hi, your mom sent me to bring you two down,” he said, “What are you guys up to?”
“Yes, a few weeks ago, you have given a woman ‘supplements’ at the order of Dumbledore,” Voldemort said. “You will tell me everything you know.”
“Looks like he’s fitting in nicely,” George agreed, “come on, I’m sure one Black must have liked doing exercises—and I still have my camera from when we went to Egypt.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “It’s just a weird feeling, it’ll be gone by breakfast, okay?” He kissed Draco’s lips softly, and smiled, “I’ll be okay, come on. We should be betting dressed anyway.”
“And the only family who treated me with care,” Harry said, “They treated me much better than Draco or my muggle relatives—uhh the muggle relatives of Lily Potter.”
“Of course, and I am sure during that, you will likely meet your demise,” Mr. Riddle said, returning to his desk. “Which reminds me,” he said, sitting down, “don’t you have lessons to write yourself? How can you possible expect to stay employed in my school if you dedicate your life to one student?”
“Faked, obviously,” Voldemort began. “Your birthday is not even at the end of July; it is in the middle. July 16
“Lestrange,” Voldemort said. “Rodolphus Lestrange.” He glanced at Harry, “He along with his wife and brother were very loyal servants. One of their more shining moments is when they both driven two members of the Order insane from torture…” A sadistic glee took over Voldemort. “I am sure you know of them… The Longbottoms.”
They found Sirius sitting at the kitchen table as Remus was setting it. “Hello boys sounded like you had some fun,” Sirius grinned. “I got the signature no problem. You’ll never have to see them again.”
The others stared in anticipation and small fear at Harry. They were all silent, not one wanting to speak, all eyes on Harry, only to glance at one another every now and again. Harry slept for ten minutes before waking up, he felt drained, extremely moody, and tired. His eyes were still heavy, and his head still pulsed madly, but that slowly went away as he regained more and more consciousness. “Ouch,” He groaned.
“Good boy,” Draco smirked. He removed his hand and stood up, stretching in front of Harry. “I think we should figure out what we should do before we are forced back to our dreary reality in Britain,” he said. “And that is something I will not do on an empty stomach.” He snapped his fingers and two house-elves appeared. Draco turned to them and, much to Harry’s surprise, ordered them in perfect French. They disappeared with a loud crack like the crack of a whip and Draco turned to Harry. “Shall we get dressed, then?” he said.
“I see,” Blaise nodded, “Still there is so much more missing. Did you know, for example, that you can turn into animals?”
For the rest of the morning, they spent every moment they could together, holding and touching one another, fixating on the feeling the others’ skin had on theirs, the love and affection they all had for each other. Just in case they ended in failure.
Lord Voldemort stood in front of his son and Draco Malfoy. His handsome, older face scowling with a silent fury, a deadly aura surrounding him as his dark eyes glared at Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco stared up at him with fear, and he tightened his grip on Harry’s throat before dropping him unceremoniously onto the floor. A book fell from out of Harry’s hand, but Voldemort did not look at it. “It is kind of you to finally show yourself, Harry, Draco,” he said, his voice seeping with an icy venom.
“Oh, well in that case why not come out with me tonight?” Ron asked. Draco stared at him, shocked at the question. Ron just grinned and said, “There’s a party being thrown by the athletes, and my friends are going to be there! Come on, it’ll be fun!”
“N-No! Of course not,” Ron huffed. “I’m going out! It’s just, you know, I’m just chilling till then.”
“Well not to worry men, I have the solution both of you have been craving, been needing. Yes, indeed my dear sirs, the blessing of the Dark Lord is upon you as I have an answer to your prayers,” the man smiled. “However, this will require explicit talks, stuff that should not be discussed in front of a kid, so…” He motioned for the three of them to walk together.
“I will Uncle Sirius,” Harry said. “If you don’t mind, I’m almost done as well and I just want to finish it before dinner so I’ll be in my room.”
The man’s whimpering turned into screams. He fell to the ground pathetically, his body convulsing uncontrollably as he felt millions of invisible burning knives endlessly stabbing him, leaving no wounds, only the pain such an attack would inflict. Harry’s hand stood still, his stance solid, and eyes locked onto the man, never looking away, though a voice inside him wanted to. That voice, however, died away quickly and his eyes fixated on the screaming man, his own eyes blinded by a blindfold, his sausage fingers raking against the stone floor, as though that would stop the pain.
A silence fell over the compartment as Harry’s friends looked down, Ron muttering to himself while Ginny and Hermione looked around awkwardly. Neville, however, broke the silence as he stuttered out, “Harry… I uh just wanted to say that uh I don’t believe any of that stuff that the
Draco laughed and stepped up to the throne, slowly shedding off his clothes as he did, revealing his large, hard cock. He sat down and glanced down at Harry. “Well my Dark Lord,” he purred, “don’t you have your allegiance to show?”
“You idiot boy!” Mr. Malfoy seethed. “You do not talk to me in that matter.” He and Draco glared at each other as Harry looked on. Then, Mr. Malfoy relented.
“Oh? Well that is good to hear—have I told you about this boy that Remus tried dating?” Sirius chuckled. “They didn’t last a week, James and I thought that he did it to make us jealous!”
“Even if your mark did not miraculously missed, if it was against any other opponent you would have killed him Harry,” Voldemort said in a surprisingly soft voice. He paused then said, “There are a lot about the Dark Arts that is unknown by the light, only those who know of the darkest dwellings will venture in, and those who do not generally stay away. I would not die if you hit me with your Curse, as I did not die when you killed Quirrell four years ago. I am immortal, I’ve taken the steps to become this, and so I have found a way to become above everyone, superior.
The named Death Eaters stayed sitting as the others all left one by one, apparating away. Voldemort waited for a few more seconds before looking at the remaining Death Eaters. “Bellatrix, stand,” he said. She did so quickly, smiling at Voldemort as she stepped in front of him. “Bow,” he commanded. Bellatrix got to her knees with a flourish.
The next day, Harry refused to talk to anyone. His hand still hurt, the raw redness refusing to go away. He growled and glared at anyone who dared go near him, especially Malfoy, however the worst part of the day wasn’t Malfoy or Umbridge’s satisfied look, it was when a letter arrived for Harry during lunch from the Headmaster himself, asking Harry to visit his office after classes. He didn’t know which one he was dreading more: his visit with Dumbledore or detention immediately afterward.
“No, to offer Hell to you,” Blaise said, “I will not rule it, not while I am here, on Earth with my loves. So, until we are ready, Hell is yours, Lilith, and with it the powers it gave my Father.”
“It’s still the middle of the night, puppy, go back to sleep,” Voldemort said, taking off his night robe. He slipped under the covers and pulled Remus to him, holding him tight. Remus relaxed under Voldemort’s grip and slurred, “Alright,” before falling back to sleep. Voldemort smiled, petting Remus’ hair as he thought about his next move.
“Not for a long time…” Lord Voldemort said. He thought for a moment then said, “Your mother’s in fact, was the last time he made a personal visit to the Initiation. Of course, he does not make himself publicly known, just in case the False One’s cultists are near… but his presence can be felt far and wide…”
“Sleeping in my room, the lazy sod,” Ron said. “I would rather have a fox than a rat any day—Fred and George both have lizards! Those are so much more interesting than a rat!”
“I am sure that Professor Snape does not want to read about or even know how to get it up,” Niall scoffed. “Anyway, give me your Transfiguration homework, I want to feel the superior twin for a bit.” Harry rolled his eyes but gave Niall his homework, they spent the rest of the afternoon finishing up their massive pile and even found some time to wander around the library, finding a section of foreign languages, including Bulgarian. It made both boys feel uneasy, so they left immediately for their next classes.
“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.”
“That was amazing,” Draco breathed, “That thing you did with your mouth Harry…” Harry gave him a happy grin, his lips covered with cum.
“We love you too, now get on,” Remus smiled. The family shared a final hug before Niall took Harry’s hand and the two boarded the boat.
Mrs. Lestrange continued to ignore them for the rest of the lesson. She kept to her desk, writing on the walls in a language Harry couldn’t read or recognize. Blaise moved pair to pair, teaching them the shield spell that he taught Ron. By the end, everyone could summon the small shield, and Mrs. Lestrange dismissed them without even looking.
“M-Maybe we can start the night early,” Draco blushed. “Tell Harry’s uncles that we’ll be staying in his room before the sun goes down.”
“I would Remus, escort me,” Voldemort said. Uncle Remus gave a short bow and walked down the stairs. “Harry, you will follow us, I have questions,” Voldemort said.
“I lost a girlfriend… and gained two boyfriends,” he muttered. “How am I going to tell my mum?” He sighed and shook his head, “I’ll think about it later.” He stood up and looked around. He was curious to what the boys were looking at.
“What in ruddy blazes are you doing boy?” Uncle Vernon’s voice thundered in the hall. Harry’s eyes grew wide with fear. He turned to Voldemort and quickly got on his knees.
My father has no sense of romance,” Harry sighed. He did not even think of his wedding vows, of what he will say to Draco when they will be married. It then hit him, how young both he and Draco are. “I want to be married but we’re so young,” he spoke to himself, looking in his reflection.
“Your openness of such vulgar subjects… if your father were to hear of this, and mark my words he will, you will be in trouble not only with him, but the Dark Lord as well!” Yaxley said. “You have shown no respect to our Lord, nor do you seem even remotely apologetic for your and his behavior last night!”
“One by one, my father deceived and tricked the old gods, angry and jealous of their powers. They were all of my grandfather’s siblings and children, however they are gods while my father was just an angel. It was his rebellion that triggered his fall and his conquer of magic and the gods. The one known to the Norse as Loki was the last to fall to my father, as he was the slyest and slipperiest of all. However, my father did trap Loki as a snake and buried him deep in a twisting cave that was grave to ghosts and lost souls. This cave was forgotten in time, earth laying over it, turning into a forest and a town nearby. It is said that a stump, wider than a human, is Loki’s tombstone, lost in the forest except for those who know the way.”
“Disgusting—how dare that lowly amateur Beta do that!” Draco raved, “you are the best member on that team, and everybody knows it—it is a wonder that you are not the captain!”
“To sleep,” Harry said, as though it was obvious. Ron and Hermione both stare at them. “Um, remember what I said this morning?” he asked.
“I’ll find a carriage and save you three seats,” Ginny said. “Harry, when were you going to tell me you’re dating Malfoy?” she demanded, looking only a little annoyed.
Greyback did not look angry, instead he just gave a satisfactory chuckle as he got back on his feet. “Worked better than I hoped for,” he said, “now I just need to make more for myself. I’ll be honest Malfoy, I thought you were dead.”
“Even this?” Harry asked, glancing down at his arm. Sirius hesitated, but Harry didn’t want to hear him stumble. Instead, he just pushed through, feeling disheartened.
“We shall perform the rituals right away,” Voldemort said, “as there is no use in delaying them. We do not need witnesses, just you and me.”
Harry nodded in agreement. “Yeah,” he said, “A proper wedding, not a thing for the Dark Lord and your parents to gloat.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded. The two stood awkwardly and Harry took the first move. He hugged his father and stood on his toes to kiss Voldemort’s cheek. “I better hear about you looking for your own happiness,” he said strictly. “I don’t want to hear about you being alone. And no, Mama Nagini does not count.”
“That during the summer, I have been tutoring a boy in secret. This boy is a Hogwarts student, and a follower whom I trust over some of my loyal followers. He has shown potential, great potential, and so I have decided to name him my apprentice. However, that does not give you command over my followers, Potter, remember that,” the Dark Lord said. “You are expected to obey my inner circle, and most of all me.”
For the first time, Harry looked down at his body and examined it. He didn’t look noticeably different besides his now fixed eyes. He stuck a finger in his mouth—his teeth still all felt the same, as did his nose and cheeks and hair was still black as ever. He thought for a moment and bit his lips, glancing towards his more private areas. Chest looked firmer, a bit bigger, but he had to wait for later to make sure.
“Well obviously that our letters are being read and confiscated if it holds information whoever is reading it does not like it,” Harry said. “We just need to figure out what exactly.” He sighed and looked at his twin thoughtfully. “My letter mentioned the detentions, maybe that was a trigger? Maybe whoever is stealing our letters does not want Sirius and Remus to know about our detentions.”
Harry left and made his way to the Headmaster’s office, a small fear and regret growing inside him as he forced himself to stay calm. He hoped that his father’s shields around his mind were still active as he reached the stone gargoyle. “Acid Pops,” he said and the gargoyle leaped aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore’s office.
Green fire took them, and when they both could see again, Harry stumbled out into a familiar-looking cozy living room with two old chairs facing the fire, both of which were occupied. “Harry!” Mr. Krum yelled. “You have nerve coming here!
“Yeah, that’s true,” Harry nodded. He looked at Draco and smiled, “So you never told me… how far is it from my house to yours?”
“I am not Lord Voldemort. I am simply Tom Riddle, a concerned father who wants nothing but the best for his son. I am a beaten and depressed man who has suffered under Albus Dumbledore for years, and now I will stand up against him and not let him kill my son.”
“Right well, I’m not exactly the best person to talk to about all this stuff,” Theodore said. “I mean, it’s fine to think about it, talk about theoretically, but to actually go through it. If you do, you are giving up your muggle half, you know. I’ve been looking into it myself, just in case Draco forgets.”
“Then next time I’ll have to try a bigger knife, Lilith,” Lestrange muttered. “Can’t suppose you would want some tea, then?”
“I am not my father,” Blaise said, “My name is Blaise, Prince of Hell and Lord of the Inferno! Old God, I name you Loki and bind you to your form, my grandfather sent me to seek your help!”
“Oh yes I do,” Uncle Sirius chuckled, “He had this ghastly suit—wasn’t his style at all!” He laughed and shook his head lightly, “Anyway, boys… After you get the consent, which should be obtained within the first two weeks of courtship, the real planning begins, and the wedding must be told to the High Priest. Lord Voldemort—”
“In that case, I would suggest you read somewhere else,” Mrs. Lestrange said. “Nobody likes a student who reads in the library so much.”
The man jumped, whimpering slightly, “So sorry, Alpha,” the man said. Voldemort smirked, “Then get to work,” he commanded.
The sun rose hazily onto the Burrow. Harry woke up with a yawn, his body back to its new normal. There was no fur, no claws. Only his pale skin and developed toned muscles. It was just like any other morning. He got out of his bed, dressed, brushed his teeth in the bathroom and made his way down to the kitchen where Mrs. Weasley was already up cooking. “Harry! I didn’t expect you to be up so early,” she said. “How are you feeling?”
“Yes,” Draco said, after a moment’s thought. He kissed Harry and smirked down at him. “Help clean up this room,” he ordered.
Harry’s stomach flipped, he moved easily into the roll of submissive, however he was still afraid that Draco’ll try to sabotage his chances to win. “Whatever it is… Sir, it better not mess with our chances to win.”
“Hermione, not everything has to make sense to you,” Ron said, surprising Harry. He looked between his two friends. “It’s not like Harry is Malfoy’s house-elf now! It’s just that their relationships is rather kinky. It always has been, right?”
It was a week since Harry brought Draco home, and the redheaded girl refused to talk to either of them. Whenever Harry or Draco entered a room she left it without a reason, and whenever Harry invited tried to invite her to play Quidditch with him, Ron, and Bill, she refused. “That Weasley girl is being bloody stubborn and childish!” Draco complained. “The full moon is next week, and my omega has better things to worry about than that stupid girl who refuses to—”
“I have an aunt who works on the Prophet! I bet if I tell her now she’ll have a story for the evening article! This is big news!”
“Unpacking her stuff in Ginny’s room,” Mrs. Weasley answered. She looked at Ginny and said, “Go help her if you’re done eating.”
Harry held the book in one hand as he slowly petted Nagini with his other, the feel of her cold scales cooling his hot fingers. He read in parseltongue, taking his time as the words hissed out naturally. He looked down every now and again, petting the snake and making sure she was paying attention before continuing. He was sleepy as he finished, and he gently placed the book down before gathering Nagini in his arms.
“When you’re bitten, that is when you have your first transformation,” Lupin said, “but you did not. Instead your body changed.”
Breakfast arrived and Harry was amazed that he could work on an essay for Transfiguration as he ate, leaving the empty plate on the small table. An hour after it arrived, the plate vanished, and Harry was left with his heat and classwork. Time moved agonizingly slow for the Omega. He forwent his pants long ago as his hole just continued to leak with need and his cock begging for attention. It would come in waves, his cock hardening and softening periodically but the end result left his lower regions sticky and the teen panting. He was somehow able to finished his essay for Professor McGonagall, as well as his homework for Professor Flitwick and Professor Sprout when his watch went off. Classes were over and he somehow worked through lunch. He did not feel hungry in the slightest and as he looked at the table, he saw that there was no plate just as Madam Pomfrey told him. He stood up and took a breath as he pulled his pants on. “Come on Riddle, just walk quickly,” he muttered. He could feel a strong wave of arousal coming, and he needed to be in the Room of Requirement before it hits him.
Draco showed the letter to Harry who read it. “Oh, that’s why,” he muttered. “I like it, I think it would work. But why are you so formal with your father?”
“We understand, “Uncle Sirius nodded. “Do not worry Harry, everything will be alright tonight.” He brought his nephew in for a hug, which Uncle Remus joined. “Just sleep my cub,” Uncle Sirius muttered, “our familiars will guard the home, so just sleep in love’s embrace.”
“Talking to yourself again Bella?” Lilith said. Mrs. Lestrange turned to see the Mother of Demons leaning against the doorway with her arms crossed. “Honestly woman, no wonder you’re so obvious.”
“She’s an expert mid-wife, helped deliver many babies both here at Hollow’s Grave and around the surrounding towns as well. Mortal, witches, warlocks, does not matter, she helps deliver them all,” Uncle Sirius said.
“Good, now that that is settled, let us eat,” Voldemort said, and he took the first bite. Harry followed. The food was good, and he smiled at the taste. This was the first real dinner he had since he left Hogwarts. The Malfoys followed for a while. Mrs. Malfoy looked up at Harry and Voldemort. “My Lord,” she started, “does your, I do not mean disrespect but—”
Harry left their room and took a deep sigh, wondering where his friend was. He first checked her room, which was empty, followed by the rest of the first floor. Ginny was nowhere to be found, and he was left to wander around the Burrow until he ran into Fleur. She pointed him outside to the gardens. Harry went outside and looked around. Bill and Ron were helping Mr. Weasley with something, and Harry was almost roped in until he asked where Ginny was. He found her with Mrs. Weasley pulling carrots out from the garden. “Ginny.”
And so, for every night, Draco waited in the common room for Harry with a chocolate parfait and cup of tea in hand waiting for him. Sometimes they talked, but mostly they kept silent. Draco saw the pain the Omega was in and when he was careless, Draco saw the back of Harry’s hand. With every night, his punishment became clearer and clearer. Near the end of the week, Draco was finally able to read what was on the back of his hand.
He didn’t hurt. Voldemort was touching him, and he wasn’t hurting. Instead, something inside his heart and head felt glad, almost giddy at the man’s touch. “I’ve done awful things to my son, my boy,” Voldemort muttered. “I’m a failure as an Alpha, and as a father. But I’m going to do better, won’t you let me do better Harrison? Please?”
Draco quickly called his parents and Harry and Blaise gathered around him. “Hello Mother. … Yes, I am at Harry’s. …. I know. …Mother, I need both you and Father to come here at Black’s House. There’s something I need to talk with both of you. …I know that he is busy with Mr. Riddle, however this is important. …” He glanced at Harry and Blaise. Harry grabbed his free hand while Blaise wrapped an arm around his waist. “It’s about marriage and the Dark Lord.” There was a long silence that ended with Draco hanging up. “They’ll be here soon,” he said with a sense of melancholy.
Harry and Draco did not see each other when the school was dismissed for the night, and all Harry wanted was to get into his bed as his headache started to get worse and worse the further up they climbed. When they reached the common room, it felt as though his head was throbbing against his skull, and he went straight to the dormitory, changing into his pajamas and went to bed.
Scrimgeour frowned. “Dumbledore, you must know what happens when an Omega consumes Alpha Protein! What possible excuse do you have for this?”
“This way, my loves,” Blaise said, leading the two towards the cave entrance. The walk down was dark, the three all had a small ball of fire in their hands as they cautiously walked deeper and deeper into the earth, the stone never changing, the stone never moving, it was a precise walkway just wide enough for one person. For half an hour, though it felt like longer, they walked down this never ending hallway with both darkness ahead of them and darkness behind them. Harry thought that the stairway would never end until, finally, he felt solid stone beneath his foot and the cave opened up into a small room.
The boys nodded. The four walked with their heads high. They all silently agreed that they would not show any of their emotions to the crowd. People would be looking for their nervousness, their sadness, or their excitement. The people would want to invade their lives and turn them into entertainment. They would have none of it. Niall and Harry stood close to each other as they walked in front of their godfathers, close enough for their hands to touch but they didn’t hold hands openly. It was a secret thing for them and their loved ones alone.
