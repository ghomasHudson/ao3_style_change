Draco’s breath left goosebumps along Harry’s nape, and Draco, now pleased at this effect, opened his mouth slightly and slowly trailed his lips up from Harry’s shoulder to just below the brunette’s ear.
Draco pulled Harry’s head back and connected their lips. Once more, their kisses were urgent, desperate, fiery. They panted and moaned into each other's mouths. Harry had snaked his arm around Draco’s waist and Draco pulled on Harry’s messy hair tightly.
Harry knew that his best chance of escape was to leave right now. Nobody beyond Draco’s bed hangings seemed to be awake, the dorm was still quiet and relatively dark. And yet, Harry found himself completely immovable. Entirely stuck on the spot, with Draco’s hand in his own and the warmth of his body flushed up against Harrys.
He sat next to Draco in Charms that morning. The two were paired up to continue practicing non verbal vinegar to wine spells. Draco had looked excited at the prospect of practising with Harry, then later left the class after the lesson looking miserable as Harry had barely said two words to the blond.
Draco was now stroking Harry in time with his grind’s. The blond was breathing fast into Harry’s neck and Harry brought up his hand, reaching behind him to roughly grip into Draco’s wet hair.
“There’s no way we were ever that small,” Draco said as his eyes swept over the group of miniatures.
Harry was moaning into their kisses. Draco then moved back down to Harry’s neck, sucking and biting.
The next morning, it was Christmas. The eighth year’s presents didn’t appear in their rooms however, but in their common room instead.
They set off toward the pitch and saw the huddle of tiny first years waiting for them. As the boys drew closer, they could see their tiny faces looking excited and nervous.
Harry clung to Draco, knowing full well that the pleasure coursing through his body made him unable to sit up right. Draco held him back, his face still nuzzled into Harry’s neck, placing soft kisses below his ear.
Their fingers were intertwined as Draco led Harry down the dark corridor. There were black wooden doors with snake-like doorknobs lining the hall, and then Draco entered one toward the hall’s end.
Harry struggled to kiss back through his heavy breaths and moans, but fought to keep the connection as Draco’s lips tasted like candy.
“Wha’ ‘Mione! We’re all friends now aren’t we?” He hiccuped again, “We’re all open and accepting, right Blaise?!” He called down the table.
Draco broke the kiss and Harry got a glimpse of his darkened eyes before the blond roughly tugged and threw Harry’s sweater over his head.
To make Harry feel worse, he hadn’t seen Draco or Hermione since lunch time, and now it was almost 9 PM. Harry stared miserably into the fire.
“I think Dad’ll be alright by himself, we’ve had a recent infestation of garden gnomes in our backyard, so I’m sure they’re keeping him occupied.”
Draco was humming in approval, his eyes closed, when Harry finally pulled away, looking at the Slytherin with dark eyes.
He had no idea how Hermione did it. She was studying more NEWTS subjects than any other eighth year and still managed to conjure up lessons for the younger years to teach for three Saturday’s a month. It hurt Harry’s chest just thinking about it. Honestly by Saturday evenings, Harry felt he was running on fumes, barely able to pay attention to the conversations he sat beside in the common room.
Her warm, wrinkled face broke into a smile, “I am very proud of you all. I never thought I’d see the day that Miss Granger and Miss Parkinson sat together pouring over a book, much less Potter and Mr Malfoy sitting not one meter apart from one another.”
He found himself sitting irritably; the clear sunny sky shining on his face, but his shoes dug uncomfortably in a layer of snow on the ground.
They stared intensely at each other for a moment, Harry’s heart thumping in his chest, but then he saw Draco bite his lower lip to stifle his grin.
Harry read over the letter. He felt he could’ve said more but the urgency he felt toward just responding to Draco was overwhelming, he needed Draco to know how much he missed him, how much he cared.
This apparently began to show on Harry’s face, because when Draco looked at him, he jumped to correct himself.
His face shone guilt, “I swear I was going to tell you sooner, I just...didn’t know what was happening. I was...I was trying to figure out how I really felt.”
But he’d grown used to the room’s eccentric taste, which was decorated in a dark academia aesthetic; silver serpents carved throughout the furniture, black feathered quills, velvet emerald pillows and a potent scent of leather, all combined to achieve a scornfully aristocratic and expensive look.
Harry couldn’t hold back his satisfied grin at Draco’s admittance. He sat back and straddled Draco, running his hands down his chest and stomach.
“We will be spending time together Ron,” Hermione interrupted him as she descended the stairs and walked over to them, “The three of us are in Defence together.”
Harry still didn’t know what it meant, if they were simply friends, or perhaps more, and due to the increasing pressure of NEWTS, Harry still hadn’t had the chance to pluck up the courage and ask Draco what was really going on between them. The weeks were flying by too fast, and Harry knew he needed to seize the opportunity to not only tell Draco how he felt about him, but also his friends. A daunting thought, but Harry was longing to touch and kiss and cuddle his Slytherin companion, and if there was any chance of either, he needed to be completely honest.
Harry, barely hearing him as he took in the immaculate nature of Draco’s emerald and silver room, still said nothing.
“McGonagall told me she’s giving you Defence and Quidditch Harry. See? Look.” Hermione pointed to the list underneath Quidditch, which, as Harry now looked, bore the names: Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy.
Harry’s inside swam with overwhelming warmth and guilt. He didn’t believe he deserved such acceptance.
When Ron and Harry returned from the common room, clad in fresh, dry, warm clothes, Harry saw that Blaise had joined Luna and Draco.
Draco slumped against Harry, their erratic breaths filling the quiet of the darkened classroom. Draco kept his face nuzzled into Harry’s neck, and before he knew what he was doing, Harry began stroking Draco’s soft platinum hair.
Harry, Hermione, Draco and Blaise threw back their shots. When they looked to Luna, she simply said, “I’m not interested in relationships. I believe they call that asexuality.”
He felt a rush of gratitude toward his best friends, despite still hearing the gossiping and laughing echoing all around him at his expense.
Harry laughed thinking back at the memory of Neville flying up into the air back in first year and then crashing back down into the ground. Of course, it wasn’t funny at the time, but the nostalgia of the memory made him smile.
Blushing slightly but keeping his composure, Draco said, “It’s in Hogwarts: A History. I guess I was right in assuming you still haven’t bothered to pick a book in the last seven years.”
“Yes Harry. We did. I woke up and laid next to you for half an hour or so before I realised you probably wouldn’t be waking up any time soon, so I went down to breakfast.”
Draco still looked perfectly smug, a playful smirk on his face like he was watching a child discover the taste of chocolate for the first time.
Needing to know how far away Ron slept from him, Harry raced up the next six steps and was brought with a sudden stun of relief; Ron and Neville’s names bared the doors of the following platform. Knowing now that Justin of Hufflepuff and Michael of Ravenclaw dawned the topmost platform, Harry went back down the steps to his own door and he really wasn’t prepared for what was inside. He now realised why the staircases weren’t jammed with the other eighth years running up and down wanting to see each other’s rooms, because the amount of detail that went into their own dorm was beyond fathomable.
Hermione, Ginny and Luna were standing together chatting politely, while Ron and Blaise stood side by side against one of the wall’s, grinning mischievously.
She sniggered at him, “Hey Potter. Enjoying yourself are we?” She looked him up and down. The alcohol so deep in Harry’s bloodstream that he couldn’t even bring himself to feel insecure under her gaze. He suspected she was looking at an exceptionally dishevelled boy who had, at this point, lost all inhibitions as he stared contently at Draco.
Harry suspected that the house elves thought it was only enjoyable to open your presents in the company of your friends, rather than by yourself in your bedroom. He found himself smiling at their kind gesture.
Draco frowned and broke eye contact, but moved so his lips touched the palm of Harry’s hand that still lay gently on his face. Draco kissed it softly but refused to look at Harry.
The Firewhisky was really running through Harry’s veins now, and he suddenly found himself uncaring, downing his shot with ease.
“Oh please, don’t act coy,” Pansy said, flicking her ponytail smiling. “I know what Draco’s like when he hasn’t had any sleep. And I know for a fact he doesn’t take any sleeping potions. But I also know that he has been getting sleep, lot’s of it may I add.”
Draco chuckled as they both turned back to their friends, who were still laughing at Harry and Draco’s expense, the two of them silently accepting defeat.
I can’t put into words how angry I am. These Ministry gits know no struggle. I doubt pompous Pattison has fought the Dark Arts a day in his life. Besides, where was Kingsley when all this happened??
“What?!” Hermione and Ron said in unison. Hermione beamed. Ron came to join them at the door, looking at Harry, aghast.
Cheers and claps broke out throughout the circle as Ron wiped his mouth with his sleeve, obviously pleased with himself.
Hermione blushed a little, “Well, we’re paired together for Charms. We couldn’t just keep acting like either of us didn’t exist.”
The pleasure in Harry’s veins swam through his body. Draco had literally just wanked him off and it was quite possibly the best climax of his life. And Draco just looked so sexy sitting underneath him.
“Oh! How is she these days? Honestly sometimes I feel like she just should move in here, she’s one of us, anyone who thinks otherwise is a daft-”
At that thought, and at the encouragement of Draco’s acceptance to his offer, Harry felt the familiar sensation of Gryffindor courage getting the better of him. He figured, in this loud and echoey classroom, why not just bring it up now.
Unaware of what this meant but not wanting the topic of conversation to change, Harry mustered up the most courage he had all night.
“P-please,” Harry’s voice was hoarse as he sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve, his eyes still staring at the book in his hands, “Don’t f-feel bad. I-I’m sorry for being such a prick.”
So then I was suddenly surrounded by Aurors and Ministry guards and the lot. They bound my wrists and took me to see my probation officer. He gave me an expected howling, lectured me about gratefulness and whatever. They kept me in a detainment cell overnight after they’d owled my Mother, who arrived the next day.
Harry had a feeling Ron was being friendly and open with Draco because he knew this was a tough day for Harry, and if Draco and Hermione had really just spent all afternoon preparing cake and gifts for Harry, then he reckoned Ron could give Draco a chance. The four talked and laughed late into the evening, and Harry felt his spirits begin to lift.
Harry thought he may actually explode. Draco’s hand around his cock and his wet, breathing lips against his neck was the most sensational feeling.
Harry stilled, his eyes wide. He nudged Draco’s head up to look at him. His pale, pointed face was still smitten with arousal, but Harry thought he saw a glint of vulnerability in his grey eyes.
“Neville and Hannah, Herbology. Lavender and Parvati, Divination. Who on this bloody Earth would sign up for that?” Ron continued down the list, “Potions, Ernie and Blaise. Blimey!- Hermione Granger, Defence, Charms and Transfiguration. She’s mental! She should be wanting to spend time with me! How in God’s name can she teach three subjects? If she’s got another bloody time turner around her neck this year I’ll-”
“Madam, I mean no offence but I am a Ministry official and this will have to be reported. Mr Malfoy here has a record, he’s on probation. I’ll need to speak with the Headmistress.”
“Teaching is a privilege Ron.” Hermione said fiercely, “In fact, I think all three of us should sign up for Defence Against the Dark Arts. We’ve been through more than most wizarding adults and I think McGonagall would prefer if we took the subject.”
Harry shook his head again then pushed Draco out of his way, but Draco swiftly grabbed his wrist, pulling their bodies flush together.
Harry shifted up a little on top of Draco, wanting to assert his dominance, and Draco practically revelled in it, arching up and thrusting his body into Harrys.
“Harry,” Draco said firmly, “I had to go through that, to get to where I am today. You couldn’t have helped me then, I wasn’t ready. I didn’t know what I was doing, and I didn’t know who I was. Please stop blaming yourself.”
Draco shifted back to sit up straighter against the headboard, then gripped just between Harry’s hip and arse, motioning the brunette to grind harder.
Harry on the other hand couldn’t even string words together. He could tell the other eighth years had all stopped their conversations to listen into Pansy’s oh so enlightening story. And he found himself unable to look up from the space of table in front of him.
Harry spluttered into his Butterbeer as he’d just lifted the glass to take a sip. Blaise laughed out loud. Hermione covered her mouth with her hand. Ron looked betrayed. And Draco went red.
Draco looked down toward it frowning, “I know, I have a feeling it’ll never come off. I’ve tried every spell I can think of,” He looked back at Harry, “Does it bother you?”
“Righto righto,” Ron said smiling as he broke away. “Anyway, it’s mum I reckon we should be worried about. Dad off at the Ministry and the rest of her sons out working…” he trailed off, “Yeah I reckon I will invite her and dad up to Hogsmeade, get her out of the house.”
Hermione raised her eyes from her book, eyeing Harry suspiciously, a little too suspiciously for Harry’s liking. Her eyes were now darting behind him and Harry’s heart rate only intensified.
Harry felt his eyes sting before he threw himself into Draco’s arms. He felt ashamed at his vulnerability, but also so elated against the warmth and scent of Draco’s body.
“You were right Draco. I am touch deprived. Hermione and Ron...they always hug me because they know, even though I’ve never really told them. But you Draco, I need you.”
Harry looked toward the DADA title and saw that no one had yet written their name below it. He suddenly felt torn; McGonagall probably expected him to go for Defence Against the Dark Arts, but she also knew of his Quidditch abilities.
“I’m sorry Draco, but do you not remember me getting caught in your room and the entire school and most likely the whole wizarding world finding out about it?”
The night was going well. Everyone seemed content in each other’s company. The music still blared loudly and Neville, Dean, Blaise and Draco had joined in the dancing with the girls. Draco and Pansy held hands as they spun each other around and Harry had to keep reminding himself to stop staring before he felt his pants getting uncomfortably tight, his arousal only deepening by his drunken state.
Draco held it up so as to show the sweater that was undoubtedly Harry’s; a great big Snitch stitched on the front by none other than Mrs Weasly not two years before.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, Hermione noticed, as she always did, “Of course, you have every reason not to Harry.” She said with a sorry look on her face.”
Where Harry’s hand was tracing small circles against Draco’s stomach, he slowly slid his hand lower toward Draco’s belt. Carefully, he undid it.
The kiss was fiery and urgent. Gasps and moans escaped each other’s lips as Harry gripped Draco’s hair and Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hip.
Harry turned away then came back and reluctantly handed over Draco’s sweater as Draco handed back Harrys.
Ron suddenly seemed unable to swallow his mash potatoes and scoffed profusely. Hermione rolled her eyes at him.
“Anyway,” Hermione waved her hand. “The point is, you can’t just stop seeing him because of everyone else… Harry,” She looked at him sternly now, “You’ve never acted in accord with how people perceived you, why start now?”
They froze in each other’s tracks. But it had only taken a second for Draco to assume his arrogant smirk, crossing his arms smugly as he looked down at Harry from the upper steps.
“Well Andromeda and Narcissa are sisters Ron,” Hermione said before returning her gaze to Draco, “That’s great Draco, that they’re rekindling their relationship.”
I think of you all the time, and like you - sleep only comes when I do (haha, pathetic pun I know). But you are definitely the last thought I have at night. You and your blond hair. I miss your scent. You smell like parchment, lemon, soil and grass.
After the blond had returned from the bathroom dressed in a loose green T-shirt, silk pyjama pants and black socks, Harry was already lying on Draco’s bed stripped down to his boxers and a T-shirt staring up at the ceiling, his hand under his head.
Harry lifted his head and shuffled his body up so as to lean on his elbow. But at this ever so slight movement, Draco blinked his eyes open and squeezed Harry’s hand.
It was late, but Harry wasn’t tired; his mind simply buzzed as the letters between him and Draco swam through his mind. More often than not after he’d read a new letter from Draco, he wasn’t only blissfully delighted, but dreadfully aroused. Harry had wanked so much in the past week purely over Draco’s words. He felt a little silly, but the more they wrote to each other, the more confident and intimate they became.
“Hush not so loud, he is sitting on this table,” Hermione whispered, “But nonetheless, Ron’s right.”
Draco gripped one hand on the pillow beside Harry’s head and the other, gripping tightly onto Harry’s hip. He was breathing heavily into Harry’s neck and Harry really did think he may be hard again in a minute.
Harry emerged, invisible, but curiously surprised at the way Draco continued to look back in Ron, Hermione and Neville’s direction. It was almost as if the boy was stalling, hanging at the back of his Slytherin gang, almost daring Harry to appear out of nowhere.
As the rawness of Harry's Occlumency lesson began to subside and he finally caught up with what he was doing, he suddenly felt vulnerable.
“Cheer up Malfoy! How about this,” Ron started as they neared the Three Broomsticks, “You and I will walk in together, and I’ll introduce you to mum and dad and everyone, saying you’re my new friend. Which you are anyway!”
Draco looked at it as it flew for a second in front of Harry’s face then sped off into the distance.
Then Hermione came down, looking beautiful. She wore a green sleeveless dress that went down to her mid calf. It was tight around her chest but loose at the bottom. And underneath she wore a tight, white long sleeve top. She wore plain white sneakers with the outfit and she looked perfectly like herself.
Ron laughed, “Nah Blaise…’Arry and I...We-” He started laughing uncontrollably, unable to finish his sentence.
“You are, by far, the bravest boy I have ever met, and we are all indebted to you for your services to not only this school, but to the wizarding world at large.”
Draco laid on top of Harry, his blond head still nuzzled into Harry’s neck, before his breathing slowed and he eventually rolled off of him.
When the three of them entered the common room, it was deserted, save for the bulky Ministry man standing on the common rooms threshold. The time must’ve only been nearing about eight o’clock. It was Sunday, so the majority of the eighth years would be sleeping in.
“But now I’ve realised that I have the choice to change. And to use courage where I can. To choose the light, even if it’s easier to choose the dark.”
At the connection of their lips, Harry felt sparks of magic encircle their bodies. He could feel the raw energy radiate between the two of them. Adrenaline rushed through his veins. Harry had never felt more alive.
“Are you two just about ready to admit you are obsessed with each other?” Pansy asked, causing yet another round of laughter around their table.
His voice broke off, only just realising what he said. He couldn’t look up. His body had frozen. He heard suppressed giggles fly around the table. Then there was movement as Pansy stood.
Draco simply shook his head grinning, apparently too drunk to really analyse the details of this revelation.
“OK, but out of the hundreds of blokes that go to Hogwarts, you just somehow knew it was Malfoy?” Ron said aghast.
But Harry knew it would be rude not to farewell his friends, so he threw one of Mrs Weasley’s knitted sweaters over himself, and his black, straight leg jeans and wrenched his door open, only to be faced with his chaotic classmates running up and down the stairs.
Ron, gasping for air through his laughter, said, “Yeah- We...we! We wanted to know who...who the heir of Slytherin was!” He was practically choking on his breath, “So...So we became Crabbe and Goyle, and...and followed Malfoy into the common room!”
“Yeah...yeah I feel the same way. But I could never work out exactly why I was looking for you all the time. And I don’t just mean sixth year, I mean every year. And because I couldn’t work it out, I started to blame it on this idea that we had this kind of gravitational pull between us. And considering all the weird things that have happened to me for the past seven years, that idea seemed plausible.”
Draco rolled his eyes at his friend but pressed on, “It’ll be hard for me to get a job anywhere else, but McGonagall supports me, so may as well take what I can get.”
Harry awoke to a streak of light penetrating his eyelids. He could feel a slight itch at his temple and something soft and smooth between his fingers. He slowly opened his eyes to see an extra pair of thighs leaning against his own. He became aware that he had fallen asleep sitting up, and so had the person next to him. It only took him a half a second to realise that other person was Draco Malfoy.
The two had been making out for little over an hour, but every time they seemed to be getting more urgent, one of them would pull back, so as to tease and prolong their feelings of need and urgency. Arousal practically bubbling through their veins.
Harry quickly bounced out of bed, throwing a random hoodie over himself, pulling on a dirty pair of pants, and followed Draco out through the door.
Harry felt his stomach flip and it took all his effort just to keep from smiling. Sobered by these mere facts, he vowed to himself to sort out whatever this was he was feeling toward Draco, preferably to end it.
As hazy thoughts from the night before swam through his mind, the one thing he could be certain of was sleeping next to Draco, but where was the blond now?
Draco’s pride was too strong for him to sneak into the Gryffindor dormitories, so it was always Harry sneaking around in his cloak at night times, heading to the dungeons. Otherwise, due to Harry’s infamous nightly walks of the castle, the two had chosen designated areas where they met in secret, obscured by the shadows and hidden amongst the nooks and crannies of the ancient stoney architecture.
When the eighth years had arrived at the Great Hall for breakfast, the four house tables, as well as the eighth year table had returned.
Suddenly feeling vulnerable and naked, no longer protected by the daring atmosphere of the night, he now felt unsure of what to do. What if Draco woke up in horror? What if he was hurt to see Harry leaving? Not likely. What if Draco woke up abruptly and pretended like nothing happened. Nothing really did happen of course, they only fell asleep next to each other.
The eighth years were to travel to the Room of Requirement in small packs in order to avoid detection from Filch.
Ron frowned in confusion. Hermione kept her eyes on him the whole way across the common room. He cursed himself for not checking if Dean and Seamus were still down in the common room, but to his first wave of relief for the night, he found his dormitory thankfully empty.
Hermione, Ron and Harry moved to one side so as to let them through. As Pansy passed Hermione first, she glanced at her then nodded politely. The gaze between the two girls lingered for a second before she continued on barely looking at Ron or Harry. Draco averted the trio’s gaze all together, until Harry spoke.
They’d just finished dinner in the Great Hall. Harry saw Draco move with the pack of his friends slowly heading toward the dungeons.
Although Harry wasn’t seeing Draco as much as he’d liked due to their demanding workload, if he ever got the chance to sit next to him in Charms, or Potions or Transfiguration, he would. Harry would sit beside him at meal times and although his tiredness seeped into their Saturday Quidditch lessons, Harry managed to stay awake purely for the fact that he got to look at Draco.
“Aand the option of mentoring the younger students in our chosen subject.” Neville said as he stuffed more greens into his mouth.
Now their topic had drifted to cautious territory, and Harry had begun to think that this was the moment that he should come clean about his feelings for Draco. Even though they were in a pub packed full of people, Harry felt like it was just he and Draco, and his heart felt full.
He really didn’t want to give it much thought… But unfortunately, Draco seemed to be dominating all of his thoughts as of late.
“Our magic?” Draco turned, “Yeah...I’d say that’s what your so-called ‘gravitational pull’ was you were feeling before you realised you loved me,” Draco was smiling.
Harry continued to kiss along the blond’s jaw and neck, until the rise and fall of Draco’s chest began to slow.
We had our last Potions class for the term today. Slughorn wanted us in the Christmas spirit so we brewed Amortentia. You’ll never guess what mine smelt like ….
The four of them fell into a friendly and humorous conversion; Harry and Ron laughing as they told Draco all about Hermione’s S.P.E.W organisation that she started back in their fourth year, as Hermione listed all the reasons as to why Draco should become an honorary member.
When I woke up in your bed today, your green rug on the floor had turned to crimson, how do you explain that?
A short while after, Harry saw Draco leaning against the wall next to the food table, a small glass with amber liquid in it, looking totally peaceful.
Harry pulled at Draco’s hair in order to reconnect their lips. Harry made the kiss intense and purposeful, trying to convey his love for the boy who lay sexy and breathless on top of him.
“It’s not funny business Hermione.” Suddenly frustrated. “You want house unity don’t you? Well a Slytherin and a Gryffindor walking into the Welcome Feast side by side seemed like a good idea.”
Draco had written to Harry telling him the owl was named Teddy, after Tonks and Remus's son. He’d explained to Harry that his mother and Andromeda had reconnected and were rekindling their previously estranged relationship, and that Teddy often came along with Andromeda to the manor for afternoon tea or brunch.
“No. She says being here is the best thing for me. Besides, Aunt Andromeda and Teddy will be with her on Christmas.”
As they approached McGonagall, now puffing slightly, Harry saw the all too familiar cold stone face of the Headmistress.
Draco hummed a laugh, “You don’t have to worry about me Potter, I’m fine. It’s nothing I won’t get used to.”
Harry swallowed but kept eye contact, “Well no, I remember us…” He trailed off, “That happened didn’t it? Please tell me it happened? I mean, I know it did, but when I woke up and you weren’t there...I don’t know. Things happen to me all the time and I sometimes have to pinch myself to make sure I’m not going insane.”
“Here,” and suddenly Draco had taken Harry’s teacup out of his hand and placed it on the side table. Draco then waved his wand and Harry felt the wetness from his tea that had soaked into his school shirt instantly disappear.
And yet, Draco still tried to feign indifference, “No, I don’t. Is it because you think you have to go and fight You-Know-Who? I know what you’re like Potter, with your hero complex.”
Hermione laughed, “That’s funny because we, Ron and I, dealt with the same thing except it was Harry carrying on about Draco!”
“Yeah it’s great. I’ve played with Dean before, flown for fun with Seamus, but they’ve got nothing on you.”
“I get it Harry...All the uncertainty you’ve known…. Loved ones lost and people you thought you knew, turning their back on you... But listen to me, I promise I won’t.” His grey eyes blazed, “I won’t ever leave you and I won’t ever hurt you.”
When Harry finally turned, his eyes were hazed with alcohol, fog and satisfaction, but he wasn’t blind enough to notice the glowing, sexy, handsome figure of Draco Malfoy, looking completely uninhibited, his facial features sharp and his grey eyes dark and sparkling.
The conversation for the remainder of breakfast was polite and friendly. Harry had contributed to none of it. His head still ached and his ‘fight or flight’ kept turning on and off every time he thought he would throw up. The only human interaction he did allow himself was intermittent glances at Draco, who, whenever he caught Harry’s eye, would raise his eyebrows and shake his head smiling.
This gave Harry all the encouragement he needed. He shifted even more closely to Draco and nuzzled his head into the blond's neck, leaving a trail of kisses from under Draco’s ear down to his shoulder.
After a moment Harry opened his mouth and Draco entered. Merlin Draco was such a good kisser. Who knew kissing a boy would feel so good.
“C’mon Ron, there’s just something really hot about Slytherin robes. And the way they all wear ‘em so well,” Harry hiccuped.
Blaise also drank his shot, unsurprisingly. But Ron was looking at Harry half amused, half disgusted, “A uniform kink? Really mate?”
At the moment Harry felt a hand close around his neck and then the familiar scratch of bushy hair grace his cheek. One arm slung around Harry’s shoulders and the other slung around Ron’s from behind them.
Harry’s eyes were dark and wide, and all Draco did was stare at him smugly, his lips slightly pink and his cheeks flushed.
Harry reminded himself of this truth as much as he could, it provided him reassurance and comfort, as Sirius often did anyway. But as for Harry’s numbness, the only real emotions he felt these days aside from his anger, was …. No, he really didn’t want to admit it, Harry couldn’t be in love with Draco Malfoy.
The echoing chatter around the Great Hall seemed to suddenly fall victim to a silencing charm. Harry and Draco seemed to silently but mutually agree there wasn’t any point in appearing startled, so upon the hundreds of faces that turned their way upon their entrance, they simply kept walking with their heads held high, set at a brisk walk, determined to get to the eighth year table as quickly as possible. It was easy enough considering the eighth years sat at the far end of the hall but directly in the middle, so they only needed to make their way down in a straight line without any awkward turns.
Dumbfounded, Harry saw the miniature label of Draco Malfoy walking slowly around the room directly next to Harry’s. He now felt a little stupid that he’d left his dinner half eaten, sprinted all the way up here, messed up his room in his haste to find the Map at the bottom of his trunk, only to find Draco literally standing only a few meters away on the otherside of the wall. And what was he even expecting to happen? Again, Harry could only blame the mysterious gravitational pull he felt toward Draco, and his ‘inability’ to resist it. But as he still felt the soft fabric of the emerald sweater in his hands, Harry now realised he had an excuse to see Draco. This sweater did smell exactly like the boy, perhaps in the castle's attempt to magic more objects into the eighth year’s rooms, it had accidentally swapped a few items.
“Not like that Potter! Merlin. I just meant that whenever Pansy or Theo or Blaise came to stay, they’d just sleep next to me and I was able to get a whole night's sleep. Sometimes Mother slept in my bed too.”
“Good news eighth years,” McGongall said loudly as she stood at the head of their table, “Mr. Malfoy will be returning this evening.”
“The courage it took for you to make a choice to be better, is just as powerful as standing up for others. You can’t do anything unless you believe in yourself first.”
The blond’s face looked hopeful as he faced away from his friends, but also, to Harry’s strange delight, a little worried.
Draco turned on the water then they both undressed themselves, leaving a mingled pile of Gryffindor and Slytherin robes all over Draco’s black tiled floor.
Draco then reached up and draped the Cloak over both of them, then clung onto Harry tightly so as to keep them concealed as possible.
“Blimey sixth year was the worst,” Ron said shaking his head, “Harry was ready to ditch Quidditch just so he could follow Malfoy around, which is saying something!”
Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry looked sheepish. But Harry couldn’t be more thankful for Hermione’s presence, as she cottoned onto Harry’s look of hesitance.
Harry suddenly felt guilty. Ron’s parents had gifted him something so generous, he knew he should visit them on Christmas Day.
“Mate? What in the hell-” He broke off, appearing as lost as Harry felt. The redhead sighed deeply, then looked back to Harry, “Malfoy, really?”
Harry looked at Draco beside him, who was looking across the table at Hermione with a mixture of gratitude and guilt, as if Draco believed he didn’t deserve her kindness.
Waves of disbelief that this was his life paired with fuzzy feelings in his stomach everytime Draco’s tender fingers would caress his body. Harry couldn’t believe the war was really over, and he and Draco were finally together.
The first years shuffled messily until they all stood next to one another in a straight line facing Harry and Draco.
Pansy and Blaise had reunited with Theo, who still sat with Ernie, who, by the looks of it, had become Pansy’s new victim of torment.
“Does it really matter anymore? We’re here now...I think this was the way it was supposed to be...You and me, coming together after everything.”
“Oh gosh don’t remind me of the weekends Slytherin played Gryffindor, I don’t think Draco went one minute without mentioning Potter’s name whenever we’d be leading up to a game.”
They were so close that Harry could feel Draco’s heart beating against his, and for the first time in a long time, Harry felt safe.
“They weren’t happy about it,” Draco said smiling, “Kept trying to push us out of the kitchen, saying they’ve got it all under control.”
Harry let out a pleasurable breath into Draco’s neck as his grinding became more intense. Draco then gripped Harry’s collar, then snuck his other hand underneath the bottom of Harry’s hoodie. Harry hummed in response as Draco began to feel up Harry’s abs.
“I think there’s more to your sexuality Harry, you just haven’t worked it out yet… Of course, none of that’s your fault, you’ve never had any time to figure out the normal things teenagers get to figure out.”
Harry was still clinging to him tightly, his heart beating rapidly. When he finally spoke, his voice was still croaky, almost a whisper.
As Blaise wiped the tears from his eyes, he dropped from the couch to the floor, dragging Ron with him, “Right, I gotta game that’ll get us all wasted. It’s called Never Have I Ever.”
As Harry broke from his reverie, he suddenly remembered his pact to make an effort with the other Slytherin’s.
Then before Harry’s dulled and delirious senses had caught up with him, he felt the soft touch of Draco’s fingers slowly bring their cocks together and stroke them simultaneously. It was heaven, pure heaven. Their leaking tips acting as a lubricant for Draco to stroke and twist and glide. Harry had never felt anything like this. He felt so close to Draco, both emotionally and intimately. His head fell forward onto Draco’s shoulder and he moaned profusely, gripping on the boy’s blond hair, never wanting this pleasure to end.
Harry ran at him, causing the Slytherin to stumble backwards violently onto Harry’s bed. Harry crowded him, a fiery, maddening look on his face. As Draco heaved himself back onto Harry’s pillows, he flaunted an annoying smirk as Harry crawled above him.
Draco and Ron walked through the door first, followed closely by an eager looking Harry and Hermione.
Harry had bucked his hips into Draco, seeking the friction from before, but this time, after Draco ran his hand down Harry’s toned chest and stomach, he slipped his hand between their hardened members.
“Oh you know,” Seamus said, “Just celebrating a fine first week back at Hogwarts. The first one in years that didn’t involve the usual ruckus.”
Just when Harry thought he couldn’t handle anymore pleasure, he then felt Draco’s bring their bodies even closer together as the blond now began to grind his cock against Harry’s arse.
“Night,” he mumbled, before pulling himself up off the floor, slowly making his way up to his own bedroom.
Ron, to Harry’s surprise, sat beside Blaise and the two started chatting about Quidditch among other things like they’d known each other for twenty years.
Although he battled with nightmares and the occasional panic attack, he felt relatively unburdened by the war, especially when he found himself in moments such as this. Alongside his best friends, and heading towards the one place he felt truly at home. He often had to revert back to the indescribable sensation of relief he felt in the moment he actually killed Voldemort. It seemed to ground him. Once he was grounded, he could list all of the things he was grateful for, just as Hermione had told him to do whenever he felt overwhelmed.
“Fine, fine! So busy, sorry I haven’t had a chance to come up to the castle. Me and the crew just opened yesterday.”
Harry felt his chest fill with warm and fuzzy feelings, but when he looked at Hermione, her eyes were watering, an astonished and extremely flattered look upon her face as she stared at him.
Draco reached in his pocket for his wand threateningly, but Harry leapt in front and placed himself between the two Slytherin’s.
Harry was so glad to see Sirius, especially after his traumatising vision of Arthur Weasley being attacked by a deadly snake. This incident, Harry admitted glumly, was just another wound added to his list of horrors he had experienced. Harry felt ashamed that he felt almost numb to it, that he’d suffered so much that he’d become accustomed to the pain, and perhaps that was why he felt angry all the time, that the goodness inside him was slowly fading. ‘Stop,’ Harry interrupted his thoughts. ‘You’re strong. Sirius told you that. He told you that we’re only dark if we choose to be. We’ve always got a choice.’
The Christmas Trees were sparkling, and although the sky was a soft, pastel blue through the windows, there was already snow falling from the sky.
Harry licked his lips as his green eyes blazed in the morning light. He suddenly felt vulnerable, he knew he was already dangerously attached to Draco, but he didn’t want to let that known, but he also needed Draco to know how much he meant to him, how much Harry needed him.
It was now Thursday morning. Harry and Draco had slept in Draco’s bed every night since their return to Hogwarts. On Tuesday night, Harry couldn’t find a reasonable excuse to knock on Draco’s door, and Draco hadn’t knocked on his door either, so Harry took the hint and tried to sleep by himself.
Harry couldn’t believe that he and his two best friends; the Golden Trio, were really sitting around a tiny table, sharing cake, and telling Draco Malfoy all about their stupid adventures they’d gotten up to over the years.
Harry couldn’t help but notice the dim lighting in the room and he soon realised his predicament; dark atmospheres always pursued Harry into recklessness, to do things that he would usually hesitate to do in the daylight. He instantaneously felt himself not caring. He hadn’t had a drink in a while so why not enjoy himself with his friends.
“It’s great anyhow,” Hermione continued. “It gives us free reign for self-expression! Now we can transfigure our room into the way we want it. I also know that there will be an eighth year’s table added to the Great Hall, and it’ll sit between the staff table and the four house tables. I guess this is all to do with the advocacy of house unity and I’m sure McGonagall wants all of the eighth years to be sort of role models for the rest of the school.”
Harry dug his face deeper into Draco’s chest and wrapped his arms around his waist, trying desperately to slow his breathing.
Spurred on by Draco’s arousing sounds, Harry began to grind against Draco’s hips, feeling his growing erection in his pants and needing to find friction. He heard Draco choke out a moan at the pressure Harry had ground down into Draco.
“Thanks a lot Harry. I’ll have no chance now that you’ve put your name down for Quidditch,” Dean said grumpily.
He ran the back of his fingers down Harry’s cheek, so as to wipe away more tears and once again, Harry was leaning into the touch.
Seeming again to know what Harry was thinking, Draco turned to look at him with knowing eyes, “I’ll be alright Harry.”
Harry choked into his coffee, tinkling of cutlery sounded as people dropped their forks onto the plates in shock, Ron finally looked up; his hair a tangled mess but a frown on his face nonetheless, Draco looked down into his lap blushing, gasps and suppressed giggles issued around the table as they all gaped at Parvati.
“Slytherins are renowned for making up rumours. And then after a time they die down and are forgotten about,” The blond’s face contorted into a smirk, “I’d think of all people, you’d know that Potter.”
Draco, I’m not sure if it’s because I haven’t seen you in so long, or because it’s easier to talk to you in these letters, but even though we’re apart, I feel like we’re closer than ever.
Draco shrugged smiling, “I haven’t played in a while. I guess Weasley will just have to pay a little more attention.”
Draco looked up. His face didn’t portray shock but merely surprise. The blonde swallowed and Harry watched as Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry’s face, they seemed to skim over his features before he looked up again to Harry’s eyes.
He avoided their eyes before finally reaching to grab some toast and porridge. His stomach had a sickly stirring sensation whirring around it and yet he also felt tremendously hungry. As he munched down his toast, Harry concluded that he may very well be running to the toilet cubicle any minute now to hurdle up whatever was stirring inside him, but as for right now, he was hungry and his toast and porridge seemed to be slowly waking up his brain.
As the trio walked further toward the back of the train so as to escape the attention, Harry saw three familiar Slytherin’s heading toward them, also trying to find a compartment. Pansy Parkinson led the way with her head held high, followed by Draco Malfoy and then Theodore Nott at the rear.
Harry smiled and squeezed his hand. He felt a flutter in his stomach at the fact that Draco had remembered the details of the first night they slept next to each other.
Draco linked their hands as they made their concealed way all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Harry really couldn’t believe this was happening. Not only had Draco consecutively refused to visit Harry’s room, Harry had already been caught in Draco’s room and the whole school knew about it! This was, simply, a recipe for disaster.
“I think I’d be more afraid to drink something from a Slytherin then whatever the Room has conjured up,” Neville said.
Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. Actually playing Wizard’s Chess together. This was another one of those moments where Harry had to pinch himself in order to check the status of his reality.
Harry gripped his wand as if to stop the urge to jump up and leap with joy. Merlin, what was it about Draco Malfoy that just made him insane?
They moved so that they were both properly sitting on the bed. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair and pulled his head back so as to look at him properly.
“You look immensely happy Harry. I feared that what I had put you through would have tainted you forever. Somehow, even as a painting, my heart hurts to think of it.”
‘Maybe this is what healing feels like?’ Harry thought. He knew it would have taken a while to feel some sort of normalcy after the war. Truthfully, he expected that he’d have anxiety problems for the rest of his life, and that it was just another thing he’d have to get used to. But none of those old bitter, sad feelings were rising to the surface, in fact they felt distant, dull.
Blaise and Draco broke out in a fit of giggles. Harry couldn’t help but laugh as well as he stood beside Hermione looking down at them in front of the fire.
“Hang on,” Ron said, his mouth full of toast, “Teddy, as in Lupin and Tonks’ Teddy, as in, Harry’s godson Teddy?”
Ron laughed. Harry found himself smiling at the mere and astounding thought of Hermione and Draco, together, in the kitchens, fussing about trying to make a cake surrounded by fifty house elves.
Draco stirred under Harry’s touch, he seemed to lean into the massage Harry was now giving his head.
It suddenly all made sense to Harry. Hogwarts was his home, as Draco just reminded him, and now he couldn’t even imagine ever leaving it.
And not a moment later, did he feel Draco come as well. The blond had released Harry’s waist and gripped his hair instead, as he growled into Harry’s neck.
Draco smiled, then reached up, like he usually did Harry had noted, to gently push one of Harry’s curls away from his forehead.
And then he was pushing Draco’s chest. The blond broke away as Harry stared at him with dark green eyes.
Harry downright choked. His erection becoming more and more apparent. Images of a nude Draco now flashing through his mind.
At the mention of his name, Draco turned. He was frowning, but Harry could’ve sworn he saw curiosity creep onto his expression. Urged on by this fickle fact, Harry spoke again.
Harry gasped as he fell forwards slightly, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco continued to stroke him thoroughly as Harry panted into Draco’s neck.
Harry winced. Their faces inches apart, their breath ghosting each other’s face, green eyes glaring into dark grey ones.
Harry shut his eyes, swearing under his breath, as if this would deny him the reality of the situation.
By Thursday evening Harry lay glumly on his bed staring at the ceiling. December had certainly arrived as thick snow fell gracefully outside his windows.
It seemed that all eyes were upon Harry, Draco and this mysterious young man who stood before them. He saw, out of the corner of his eye, that Hermione and Ron had slowly stood as well, their hands clasped at their wands by their sides.
As Draco’s grip on Harry became tighter and his strokes began to speed up, Harry was panting, but Draco looked up at Harry in his lap and captured his lips once more.
As Harry smirked into the kiss, he began to grind more urgently, now feeling their erections rub against each other through their trousers.
Draco chuckled against Harry’s jaw, “Trust me. There were plenty of times when we’d been fighting and I’d have to rush back to the common room for a quick wank.”
Though as soon as the butterflies crept into his stomach, anxiety began to replace it as he realised he wouldn’t be next to Ron. Not only did Harry find comfort in their friendship, but having lived with him over summer, being accepted into his family, and not to mention having slept cramped next to him for almost the entire previous year, Ron, like Hermione, had become his safeguard. Not necessarily from physical threat, Harry had gone through enough of that to be assured he could take care of himself, but more so when he felt restless and anxious. When trauma of the past began to suffocate his mind.
Two mullioned windows sat on either side of his bed, showing the brilliant starry sky. Two bed side tables also sat on either side. The one with a Victorian style lamp on it bared three small photographs in gold frames. Harry moved closer to them and suddenly was fighting back tears as he saw who moved happily within them. The first one was of Sirius and Lupin; their arms around each other’s shoulders as they smiled and laughed into the camera. They were standing in the basement kitchen at Grimmauld Place, so the photo must've only been a few years old. Next to it was Hedwig, she was outside somewhere in Hogwarts, her head moving slightly, the sky a shining blue behind her. Harry had no idea who had taken this picture, but he found himself not caring, Hedwig looked beautiful and his heart suddenly ached with longing. The third picture was of his parents; the one he had carried along with him for years, where Lily and James danced and kissed.
Harry revelled in the lessons he got to sit next to Draco. The two were finally developing a strong friendship. And now Harry was afraid he’d ruined it all.
They both moaned into the kiss. It was hungry, urgent, eager. Both desperately wanting to taste each other after days of such dismal distance. Their tongues glided and fought together and the grunts and sighs that Draco muttered into the kiss sent Harry into such delirious arousal, he silently hoped he could last long enough simply to just prolong this sensational feeling of urgency and need.
“Blimey you don’t have to make me feel like an idiot, how long was it until you two got over yourselves and told each other the truth?”
“Mmm,” Draco lifted his head. He ran his thumb along Harry’s cheek bone, admiring the glowing look on the brunette's face, “You’re so handsome Harry.”
And now, Harry lay next to Draco. Draco, of all people, and he’d brought Harry to such pleasure he was sure he was dreaming. Surely Harry would wake up soon all hot and bothered and humiliated with Draco looking down at him in disgust. Is this what Ginny was talking about? That maybe, Harry liked boys as well? Before he could ponder on this crazy thought, he felt Draco slowly shift his body off his, but keeping his gentle hand lay against the skin of Harry’s stomach.
Blaise was now in fits of laughter with Ron and George. Hermione and Molly were huddled in a secret conversation by the pub’s fireplace. Percy and Arthur had met some familiar wizards who were also in the pub for Christmas, Bill and Charlie sat together in warm conversation, and finally, Fleur, Ginny and Luna danced to the upbeat Christmas music that circulated throughout the pub, with many other festive witches and wizards, swaying with glasses in their hands.
Quickly, Harry and Draco picked up their brooms and run back towards the castle. Draco thrust the Snitch back into Harry’s palm as they went.
“Lies!” Yelled the dark haired man, “Where’s your proof?! The only proof I see is my bloody face caused by you and your associate here!”
On one Friday afternoon in January, Harry was studying in the library with Hermione. He’d lost focus a few moments ago, but thought he was safe to ponder his thoughts as Hermione scribbled furiously away at her parchment.
“So are you going up to Hogsmeade this weekend?” Harry asked as he twirled his wand in front of him.
He had undoubtedly stumbled, and the sound of his fumbling footsteps echoed around the deserted corridor on the sixth floor, as his feet pinched the hem of the Cloak, evidently showing random pieces of Harry’s body.
“Yes but pairing him with Harry?...Boy, the first years are in for a treat. Might end up watching a free wrestling match instead, might not even get to mount their brooms. What’s McGonagall playing at with this?”
There was silence as the five eighth years and Luna ate their breakfast, before Hermione spoke once more.
This only angered Harry more, so that night in his dormitory, Harry studied the Marauders Map for the git that was Draco Malfoy.
Harry had to run a little to keep up with the blond’s furious pace, his black and emerald robes billowing behind him as he climbed higher and higher up into the castle.
As she removed her glasses she spoke again, “I suppose your head feels free now that the war is over.”
Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Luna had half carried, half dragged Ron, Draco and Blaise back to the eighth year common room, after Harry and Hermione realised that there seemed to be no official end to their Christmas Eve Feast. They politely excused themselves from the drunken state of their teachers, who were still singing raucously and dancing around the Great Hall.
“But the rest of the school is told to look up to us as mentors and role models and to use us as examples of inter house unity,” Parvati continued.
Draco let out a breath of laughter, “Well, I know what you’re like Potter, needing to know that everything is alright in the world. I let you in to show you that I’m not up to anything strange in here, if that’s what you were thinking.”
Harry breathed out heavily in annoyance. He knew he shouldn’t be angry at Hermione, but her absence seemed to fit as a perfect scapegoat for the whirlwind of emotions he was currently feeling. One of those feelings, notably, was anxiety, anxiety not only over Hermione’s mysterious disappearance but Draco’s as well.
His eyes were squeezed shut so as to stop the flow of tears but he then felt a warm body wrapping its arms around his shaking form.
Hermione rolled her eyes and pushed her parchment aside, lowering her voice, “Does this have something to do with the person you’re seeing?”
Harry slowly ran his hand back up Draco’s chest up to his neck, combing his fingers through the hair at Draco’s nape. Once again, Draco’s head fell back in pleasure.
Harry then felt Draco’s hand on his hip as the blond slid his fingers underneath Harry’s shirt, caressing Harry’s skin. Harry bucked into the touch.
“And how exactly do you know what the Gryffindor common room looks like Malfoy?” a slight, all too familiar smirk that he reserved for Draco only, creeping onto his face.
Harry shrugged, “I admire what you’re doing Hermione, you know, wanting to change the system from within, but working in the Ministry just isn’t for me.”
“That works for me. Who knows? Maybe we’ll find a second youngest Quidditch player in a century,” Draco smirked at him.
Draco jumped off Harry at a speed of light. Harry scrambled to his feet and the two whirled around, looking for the source of the noise.
Draco chuckled, “I don’t know, I can’t become a teacher straight out of Hogwarts, but maybe get an internship in Potions, or Healing.”
My Mother isn’t doing so well being in this huge house by herself, so I’m planning to stay here for a bit longer.
Draco sniggered, “Take the lead Potter,” he looked down toward the bulge in his trousers, then back up to Harry seductively, “My cock is already aching for you.”
They stood breathlessly, Harry’s arm still leaning against the wall as his whole body shook from the after effects of his climax.
Hermione walked over to a table in the common room, Draco following behind her. Harry watched, his eyes suddenly watery and his throat coarsely dry, as Hermione gently placed a cake on the table. The cake was red and gold and formed the shape of a Quidditch jersey; James Potter’s Quidditch jersey. The words ‘Potter’ and ‘Seeker’ and the year ‘1976,’ iced on top of the cake.
But this letter had to get to Draco, so Harry fed the owl some of his chocolate that his room had magicked (funnily enough it was the same chocolate Lupin used to offer him) and he reopened his window and watched the owl fly into the night.
“Merlin,” Harry muttered to himself. Immediately trying to think of Aunt Marge and Uncle Vernon so as to rid himself of the hardness in his pants. And trying desperately not to think of Draco; gorgeous and naked hovering above him wearing only his Slytherin tie around his neck.
“Seriously you’d think we’d had enough Dark Arts for a lifetime.” Ron whispered to Harry as they left the common room and headed to dinner. And Harry felt himself strongly agreeing.
There was Blaise, holding the dark haired man's hands behind his back as Draco punched him hard in the stomach. The man groaned and Blaise let go of him as he fell clumsily into the snow. Blaise kicked him hard so that the man rolled over onto his back. Then Draco was on him again. The blond straddled him, then started punching mercilessly into his face.
His bedroom in Malfoy Manor was fit for a prince, and his fluffy, layered doona covers were varied shades of green, primarily emerald, and they lay scattered between two nearly naked bodies.
Harry exhaled, rolling his eyes, “Yes Blaise. I mean to say that I’ve never been a fan of the Ministry, and ever since the war ended, whenever I’d think about becoming an Auror...something just felt off. Then Draco helped me realise that Hogwarts has always been home for me, so why not get a job in the castle?”
“It shouldn’t be too bad. I assume they’ll just keep to themselves,” Parvati said. And then they all returned their gaze to one another.
“Let’s eat!” McGonagall said, with a lot less strictness then what was usually heard in her voice. Apparently the teachers had collectively agreed to let themselves go on Christmas Eve.
Nevertheless, Harry had grown attached, and that scared slightly him more than his recurring dreams of cold black floors and oddly familiar passageways.
“And I suppose that’s why we’re all sitting together on this table.” Harry said as he looked around the table properly for the first time, noticing who had returned and who hadn’t.
Harry looked to Draco, whose head was bowed looking to the ground, his hair falling into his eyes. His hands, still wrenched behind his back by the unknown wizard who had pulled him from the ground, his whole body slouched.
“Back when they were young, one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew, betrayed them. And when I first met them all, I remember Sirius yelling that he’d never snuck around people who were stronger or more powerful than him. He yelled at Peter and said, ‘you always liked big friends who’d look after you.’ Sirius made it through all those years in Azkaban because he stayed true to himself, because he always knew who he was.”
It was as though his rational and irrational self were at war with each other. Draco went against everything Harry believed in, and now the Slytherin was a part of the loathsome Inquisitorial Squad.
“Oh. Right. Of course. You just know everything don’t you,” Ron said rudely as he returned to his sausages.
He had removed himself from the Cloak but Draco remained invisible beside him. When the portrait flew open, Harry motioned the Slytherin to follow him, his heart thumping in his chest as he heard many voices chatting animatedly within the nearly full common room. This was madness. It was only a little time after dinner so of course everyone would still be lively and awake.
He turned and the three best friends followed him as he gave them a grand tour of his beaming new joke shop.
“Just stay close to me,” Harry half whispered and half hissed to the seemingly invisible space behind him.
Ron’s eyebrows raised in shock but Hermione just pursued him, “Why can’t it happen? You’re allowed to be happy you know?”
When the blond’s head fell forward and became level with Harry’s, Draco’s eyes were darkened. Once more, Harry was intoxicated by his looks.
“Well, when you’ve finished your staring competition, feel free to join us, we’re gonna play a few games.”
“Thanks,” Harry whispered. “So um, are we gonna, you know, give what we did last night another go? I mean we both admit we got a decent night’s sleep...”
Ron’s voice brought Harry back to the Entrance Hall, to which a trickle of staff and students were beginning to enter for dinner.
Harry still had no idea what he was doing. He hated Draco, he always had, but now, he wasn’t so sure. And as the burdens of his dreams and the strange darkness and anger that brewed within him had really begun to manifest, Draco had become Harry’s outlet.
Humming into the embrace, Harry ran his hand down Draco’s toned stomach. Then Draco nuzzled into Harry’s neck again.
“Sure,” Blaise said. And sure enough he’d pulled Draco into his lap, gripped the blond's hair and dug his tongue deep into his mouth.
“And they beat me up! As if you’re lettin’ em’ go to school, run around the village, when they’re associated with such vermin! And now they’re beating me up! Who knows what else they’re capable of!”
The two girls flung their arms around each other as more claps and laughter ensued around the table. Harry cringed slightly at the sappy sight.
Harry’s eyes flicked toward the Slytherin’s at the other end of the table. The eighth years table was less than half the size of the regular house tables, but Draco seemed to be in happy conversation with his friends.
“This year is about healing isn’t it? About figuring out who we are, about realising things about ourselves that we never had a chance to during the war,” Draco’s eyes sparkled as he stared at Harry, “There was no point acting on my feelings if they weren’t reciprocated. But like you said, there’s always been something between us, ever since we met, but you had to figure that out yourself.”
