“He’ll tell us if it gets too much,” Ron says, sounding altogether reasonable.
And he is gone by the time Draco leaves for work at 7.
He won’t do it as himself. He’s not much use here as Harry’s husband, anyway. Let the Order keep their crappy disguises. Draco will be unrecognisable
“I knew what this would be like when I married him.” Except Draco hadn’t. He’d thought… Merlin it sounds stupid now, even in his head, but he’d thought maybe he could help hold Harry back from the edge.
“OF COURSE I DIDN’T GO!”
Some give Draco concerned looks, others glares, and the rest just ignore him as a fixture of the room. It’s a coma, and then deep, Healer-induced sleep, so there’s nothing to see, really.
“I can’t do this without you,” Harry says, quietly, almost too himself. “Without knowing you’re safe.”
Draco makes sure to leave his address with the top two curse specialists before he leaves.
But Draco refuses,
“The people Harry is saving are important,” Hermione says, like Draco doesn’t care at all about the rest of the world.
Towards the end he is near shouting. There’s voices from the corridor, a muttered conversation. Harry looks embarrassed, but Draco is too tired to care.
At one point the waiting becomes so awful that he goes to Healer Bell’s office. Listening to her blame him over and over might shut up the voice in his head that blames himself; he’s contrary like that.
, Hermione says, speaking rapidly while casting twenty dozen diagnosing charms, but Draco’s too busy looking at Harry’s left arm and casting fast, exhausting, blood-replenishing and curse-weakening spells at what used to be an arm but is now some kind of stump, and Weasley is yelling orders at the other Aurors and Draco vomits in the corner of Weasley’s office while they all apparate away from him.
Neither of them knows how to look to each other for a comfort that isn’t mired in constant, terrifying danger.
Fuck reason. “You’re not pulling him out?” Draco asks.
list should be involved in extreme-risk cases. These include, but are not limited to: serial killers, ex-Death Eaters and conspiracies formed by radical fringe groups.
Finally, he is done expelling everything he’s eaten and he steadies his head enough to apparate to Mungo’s, alone, to track his husband’s broken body once again.
Whatever it was, after ten minutes, he pulls himself together. Casts a few fixing charms on the items in the room, and a cleaning charm on his own shirt. He won’t think like that. He
Draco could dwell on this. Could hate them for not telling him about the threat against his husband. Could hate Harry.
and it takes Draco a moment to realise why his brain is flagging this.
Draco doesn’t say anything. Can’t bear to ask Harry.
“We trust him,” Weasley says simply, as if that is all this was, a question of
He slows down, looking around carefully now. No one else that he recognises. But
He sees Weasley’s eyes draw to Harry’s left arm as they talk. Watches him figure out the answer to whether the Healers can do anything before he has to ask it.
He apparates to St Mungo’s to stop himself thinking, and asks them to prepare a room. The bemused secretary directs him to a healers office he has not visited before.
Really it could have been summarised in a memo with three bullet points:
Pansy, with much grumbling and slow final sips of her tea, departs.
, to take today’s newspaper out and look at the corpses the killer leaves, knowing Harry has gone off-book to chase him, alone.
“You’ve banned pain relief in your file, haven’t you?” Draco snatches his hand out of Harry’s to grab at the file; and then misses touching Harry, which is ridiculous, for a man five years married. “You really have. That’s meant to be for people who have nerve damage! Not paranoid Aurors, you self-sacrificing Moody-imitating idiot.”
old habits die hard”. Draco and Harry had only been engaged then, but little changed after the wedding. Gryffindor loyalties remain.
But Katie Bell… he didn’t have the words. He’d tried anyway of course, sent a letter to her after he was acquitted, apologising, offering recompense in whatever form she wanted to ask for. In his mind, he owed her a life debt, even if the magic didn’t take like that. But she had been out of the country, and never replied. By the look on her face right now, either she hadn’t got his letter, or she
Weasley fumbles in his jacket pocket, reaches out his galleon. Hermione had modified them so full messages could be sent wandlessly. When Hermione and Weasley put theirs side by side any secret messages Harry sends will appear (Harry said it would protect Draco not to be involved. Draco… has opinions on that).
Harry had looked desperately sad, for just a second. His voice cracked when he said, “I don’t seek
“You didn’t go?” Harry sounds genuinely confused.
“But you can help him. Long-term. Harry - Harry
“Not me. But Ha-”
Weasley finally explodes. “You need to ruddy well support him!” he almost-shouts. Hermione places a hand on her arm, but she looks angry too.
Bell looks a little shocked at that. Baring his soul comes with an awful awkward silence.
3. No one on the Ministry’s
“Properly injured,” Draco finds himself saying it as he thinks it, even though he is supposed to stay quiet. “That means he is already somewhat injured.”
“But I know you care, Bell, it’s clear you do.”
So Draco can’t even bear the thought of adopting, because he can only promise the kid one parent, and that parent is so constantly, stiflingly anxious about the other that he’s not sure there’s room to let in anything else.
? That was such a - it was the most Potter plan imaginable. Aggravate the enemy until he tries to kill you, and maybe you’ll get him mid torture.
“Maybe you should apply your own extensive curse knowledge. Wasn’t it one of your friends who cast -?”
So he goes to the Ministry. He sits in the corridor next to Weasley’s Auror office, because he knows news will reach there first, long before they think to contact him. One time Weasley informed
“Harry,” Draco says, before Weasley reaches them. He turns to his husband, suddenly urgent, desperate. “Harry, what if I help this time? You know I could have chosen curses as my expertise. Some of the ones he used to cause your injuries, they must have been specialist, I can find where he sourced them, I can help you catch him-”
, to save Harry some pain. He knows he hasn’t done enough to lessen the long-term damage accumulating with each poorly-healed curse.
, even in his own head. It will… it will be too much.
“No.” Harry’s voice is flat. He doesn’t even try to explain. It is Draco whose voice is breaking.
“Because you’re sweating. You’re paler than even a Malfoy should be. And you’re about to break the teaspoon you’ve forgotten you’re holding.” He carefully unclenches his fingers and returns the spoon to the table. Right. Uncommonly powerful deduction skills, Pansy has.
Hermione was the only one who ever seemed to understand. They used to catch eyes and half-smiles, waiting in the corridors of the Ministry for their partners. Both of them young, war-damaged, and on edge every time their Auror boyfriends stepped outside. But since she became pregnant with Rose a year ago, Weasley confined himself to office work.
– he spots a woman of Hermione’s height wearing the black running shoes she brings out in a crisis. Her hair and eyes are different and he can’t be
It’s as good as a dismissal.
“Did you have a good time at your conference?” Harry slurs out, his mouth still slow on the reflux of the spells.
“Oh, I’d say you’re worse than that.”
For the first time since the war.
He always thought there would be an end, that someday Harry would realise that he did not have to track down every single bad guy on his own. He had waited for it, through years of dating, through their long engagement, their years of marriage. It has been four years since Harry became Head Auror, and it looked like he would be in it for life now.
Oh Merlin
Draco looks to his husband, but Harry is not even looking at him, just down at his clenching and unclenching right hand.
He had done everything he could think of, but he couldn’t be the sacrifice’s husband.
Draco raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Healer Bell,” he says and it comes out like a plea.
Bell sighs gustily and it sounds like she’s letting a touch of the anger go.
“We can fix this,” Harry insists. “Change things. I know I’ve been too busy lately, getting hurt too. It’s just, with this one…” he trails off. Both of them know that every killer becomes ‘this one’.
He knows this isn’t the heart of it, but right now it feels like it sums up everything that’s wrong, that Harry signed a form to say he wanted no pain relief, even before knowing what pain he’d be in. That he probably hoped Draco would never notice.
“Then get out.”
that Harry had survived his mission before he told Draco. Apparently,
She softens by the tiniest margin. “I’m involved in long-term recovery. What they’re working on now isn’t my expertise. There’s nothing I can do to help him.”
“You’re busy and yet he’s still lying there, isn’t he Bell?”
Draco does.
Draco spends a lot of time anxiously waiting for floo calls. One time he was perched on his chair by the fire long enough that he read the entirety of the Ministry pamphlet
- those shoes must have sold more than one pair, and muggle shoes aren’t unheard of with witches these days. But the man walking with the maybe-Hermione, who nudges her gently towards the lifts, might as well scream Kingsley Shacklebolt with that bold pattern clothing.

He picks up the little guy, plays with his ticklish right pinky and reassures Andromeda that he remembers Teddy’s allergies and newest favourite toy.
danger.”
“Malfoy,” Weasley says, once their empty small talk has slowed to silence with room to fall apart in. “Probably best if you head home, have a shower, take a break, yeah?”
It comes out of Draco in a rush. “Check in on him in his office, once a week, pretend it’s a Ministry scheme, pretend it’s you trying to seduce him away from me - I don’t care
“I know he’s the best they have. I just…”
“You think I- You think I went to my-? With you here?” Draco is flabbergasted, can barely form the sentences. He is
after
So Draco takes his cue as the devoted Auror-husband. He calls out the door for one of the Aurors to floo call Weasley, who comes quick marching down the corridor within minutes. This is when Draco would usually clear out – Ministry secrets to be discussed – but he lingers at the door.
But also every moment Harry is gone, Draco pictures him dead. And not the deaths he had nightmares about before, which, he realises now, were a gift. Now he sees Harry like the gruesome corpses in the
Instead he apparates to Andromeda’s. She lets him in with a wave of her wand, looking harassed and a little lost in her wide hallway. If his hunch is correct, she’ll have somewhere to be.
“I know what you deserve,
And Draco had been left to fill in the rest. That danger found Harry anyway (though Harry
“Good Godric,” Harry whimpered, his voice squeaking at the strain. He felt fuller than he ever had, legs quivering as he was pushed further into the table, the legs screeching as it shifted minutely over the flagstone floor.
Now coming up on their last week in the contract, Draco had nearly all of Wizarding England eating from the palm of his hand. Everyone wanted to either know him or be him. For Harry’s part, he didn’t have to do much; just introduce him to the right people. It wasn’t surprising that Draco knew how best to work people, knew when to compliment, or when to gossip; knew when it was prudent to mention business prospects or discuss personal matters. He truly had been bred for this world.
because I quite like the boxers.”
No one would believe this—
Harry blushed under Narcissa’s praises and set his teacup down. “It was the right thing to do.”
Draco hissed in pleasure as Harry moved his hand up and down experimentally. His dreams certainly never prepared him for
As Draco pushed inside of him, his arse stretched wider than Harry thought possible. Grunting at the burn of it, Draco persisted until he filled him.
, and I—”
His stomach dropped. He knew exactly what she was inferring with the damned Prophet article. Those bastards behind the paper had confronted Ginny mere moments after their break-up was announced. Harry couldn’t blame her for telling them why they had split, she was still hurt, and he understood the reason. But it wasn’t his fault he was gay, and he hoped that one day she would understand him.
what kind of dreams you’ve been having.”
“Draco, I’m going to—
Chuckling, Draco slowly removed his fingers, and Harry let out another whimper at the emptiness they left behind.
Harry felt his pulse jump in his throat as the hand moved up to cup his face, Draco’s thumb tracing the line of his bottom lip.
, Potter?” Draco smirked, leaning back on his hands and shifting his hips forward.
“I want an answer, Potter.”
“Just... I’ve been dreaming about you for
The size of him made Harry’s heart pump faster in his chest, and his own freed cock twitched against Draco’s leg.
Harry chuckled and turned to face him, circling his arms around Draco’s waist and pressing his face into his firm chest. Draco was much taller than him, and it was one of the things that drove Harry mental―in a
“I’ve dreamt,” Harry started, gasping as Draco’s lips trailed down his chest and latched onto a nipple, “that you sucked me dry.”
Draco’s weight disappeared, and Harry heard him mumble under his breath. Two lubricated fingers pressed against his entrance and Harry arched his back, indicating his eagerness for more. Already his cock began to stir back to life, and as Draco’s finger’s stretched him, Harry cried out and bucked forward, needing some type of friction—some kind of pressure.
“Harry, as you know, our stance in the War was... misguided and wrong,” the witch shifted in her seat, the uneasiness of her words evident on her features. “We regret the side we chose, and have since paid dearly for it, though not as bad as we could have. We appreciate your testimony at our trials, especially Draco’s.”
“I want you to fuck me; I want my arse to hurt so much I can’t sit tomorrow.
“Continue.” Draco’s deep voice mumbled against Harry’s chest as he peppered kisses across to the other nipple, working it the same way.
“Draco shares in your preferences,” Narcissa smiled gently at Harry, picking her teacup back up. “We love our son, Harry, and we don’t care who he chooses to love.”
Harry took a sip of his champagne, allowing a moment for the bubbles to pop in his mouth before swallowing. “Just needed some air.”
At the question, he curled his fingers inside Harry, pressing that spot inside to make him see stars. A sudden sharp slap to his arse cheek sent him lurching forward against the rough wood of the table. He whipped his head around to look at Draco, only to find him wearing a broad smirk.
Narcissa’s red-painted mouth curled into a polite smile that was sure to be something she put on when she had to be diplomatic. “Name your price. Would you like to own a quidditch team? We’ll purchase one for you. Anything you want, we will make happen.”
Draco worked his cock through it all, pumping him gently and murmuring words of praise in his ear.
Had Narcissa not invited Harry for tea, he would have thought them gone from Wizarding England.
“Please—” Harry choked out when Draco twisted his wrist and pumped faster. “Please fuck me, Draco.”
He had woken, startled, but with a raging hard-on, and nearly ran to Hermione’s flat in panic. She took in the haphazard state of him, jeans still unbuttoned and sweater on backwards, and it was like she instantly knew. Hermione pulled him into her and Viktor’s flat and made him tell her everything.
Now alone, Harry was free to moan as loudly as he wanted, and he did, the sound echoing in the quiet house as Draco bit his lip.
Draco growled as he took him in, and he straightened, pulling Harry to stand and ripping their shirts from their arms. Now bare-chested, their naked skin flush against one another set Harry’s stomach fluttering as he was pulled into a searing kiss.
“Please, call me Narcissa. Come in.” She stepped further into the Manor, and Harry followed, blinking in surprise at the interior. It had completely changed since the War two years ago. The floors, once dark and caked with the blood of his friends, were now a white marble so bright Harry had to squint his eyes from the reflecting sun.
Turning them, Harry pushed Draco against the table, pulling out his wand and slicing down the expensive silk shirt to pop open his buttons. Draco chuckled against his mouth but made no protest as Harry quickly worked open his trousers and dove his hand in to wrap around his considerable length.
“Are you getting hard already?” Draco asked, amusement evident in his tone. “Do you still want to go back to that party to find someone else to shag?”
“Do you no longer want my help, Malfoy?” Harry replied, matching the abrasive tone. They glared daggers at each other, and Narcissa sighed impatiently.
Draco placed a finger under his chin and tilted Harry’s head up, their gaze’s meeting. He had expected Draco to be grinning, but instead, his face looked serious, a fire in his irises that had Harry’s cock twitching in his pants.
“You know we only have a week left until the contract ends.” The words were out before he could stop them, and anxiety swelled in Harry’s chest at the uncomfortable silence that followed.
“Is there a line of suitors out the door?” Harry quipped, grinning at the scowl he received in response.
“I hope you’re well, Harry. I must say we’ve been following your career closely and are very impressed,” Narcissa said, leading them to a room off to the left of the foyer.
“Draco, please...” Harry whimpered. He needed the oversized cock buried inside of him; he needed to be fucked, and fucked properly.
Harry looked up at him from behind his spectacles, aware of the picture he must make—thick cock still in his mouth, and hand around his own.
Harry finished reading the parchment—
“That will be all, Tivy.” The witch dismissed the elf, taking her seat in the matching settee opposite Harry and pouring them both tea. Once they had each taken sips of the steaming liquid, Narcissa set her cup down and folded her hand demurely in her lap. It was an odd thing to see; it looked as if she suddenly lost all the confidence she previously had on.
The amused look Narcissa gave him made Harry wish he had remained silent.
Harry contemplated for a moment as he stared at the contract. What was something he wanted? He had his parents fortune, plus Sirius’s, and the money given to him from the Ministry at the end of the war—his Hero Reward, as they called it. He donated so much of it to reparations, and yet he had more than he knew what to do with. No, he didn’t want anything material. But there was something even better that came to mind.
Snorting, Harry couldn’t help but retort, “I’m sure we all know by now how big your cock is Draco. You’ve obviously been proud for some reason, and it certainly isn’t your winning personality.”
Draco burst with a sudden laugh, the sound echoing in the small room. He sat up and leant forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he regarded Harry with a feral grin. Harry had never noticed the surreal mixture of silver and blue that swirled in his irises; it was as if he stared into liquid pools of mercury. Harry realised with a start that he had grown into quite a handsome man.
Harry arched his back, goosebumps breaking over his skin in anticipation. He had dreamt of his moment for so long, in so many instances, and now it was finally happening.
Harry whined as he slid out slowly, feeling every inch of the length as it left him.
Pumping faster, Harry shuddered as his orgasm wracked through his body, and cries of pleasure left him as he came for a second time. His legs turned to jelly beneath him, and he pressed his head to the table, not even caring that his stomach became smeared in his own fluids.
“Tell me what you want, Harry.”
“What do you say to trying this out for real? Fuck the contract.” Draco’s voice came out small, as if he was afraid Harry would say no.
“I think they’re adorable,” Harry said, grinning as he pulled them down. The grin didn’t last long; as it disappeared the moment Harry took in the sight of the impressive cock before him.
Harry’s voice came out in barely a whisper, the words terrifying him. He didn’t know if Draco felt the same; he didn’t know if what they had between them was truly just a farce or if, like Harry, something had changed for him at some point.
“Boys, please; we must keep this civil. Harry has named his terms, and your father and I have accepted them.” A quill materialised in her hand, and she handed it to Draco. “Signing this contract binds you two together for the next year. Do you agree to the terms?”
“Merlin, yes.” Harry breathed.
Harry couldn’t help but whimper at the burn of being so thoroughly stretched, and Draco began to rub soothing circles over the swell of his bum.
He couldn’t help but buck forward, desperate for
“But here you are, being bent over your kitchen table and begging for my cock.”
Harry could feel his face flush at his admission, and he quickly tried to rebury his face in the soft tuxedo jacket.
The intoxicating flavour of the leaking precum filled every taste bud of Harry’s tongue as he swiped it over Draco’s cock. The width strained his jaw as he stretched to fit him in, but he didn’t care. The only thought flitting through his mind as he began to draw Draco deeper into his mouth was that he couldn’t wait to feel it stretch his arse wide.
“I don’t want to hurt you, Harry.”
“Tell me again,” Draco whispered between kisses, “what happened in your dream.”
With a flourish, Draco signed his name, handed his mother the quill and contract, and leant back in his seat to stare out the nearby window. The sudden shift in his demeanour was a bit off-putting, but Harry paid that no mind.
His knees buckled at the realisation that Draco meant for him to come first.
Harry nodded, choosing to stay silent. The bergamot of the tea sat thick in his throat, and he was sure had he chosen to speak at that moment, his voice would come out gruff.
Harry couldn’t think of a worse idea.
“I know.”
Merlin, he was
Harry chucked his wand to the table and stepped back, kneeling to pull Draco’s trousers down. A surprised laugh escaped his lips at the sight of the pants beneath them.
Gryffindor courage filled him knowing he caused this kind of reaction, and Harry pulled back, panting for breath but determined.
-Malfoy.
; Draco hadn’t been lying earlier when he said he was immense. Licking his lips, he leant over to wrap them around the head of Draco’s pale cock.
“Are... are those ice cream cones?”
“Harry has agreed to our terms,” Narcissa said as the two men entered.
But that smirk, that damned smirk that mockingly curled his lips when he finally looked at Harry was all Draco.
“Fuck, Draco.” Harry groaned, knowing he was being teased, and as Draco’s hands gripped his hips to keep him still, Harry swore again.
Narcissa gestured to the light blue couch across from her when they entered the sitting room, and Harry was again startled at the modern and inviting decor. He took the seat reluctantly, perching just on the edge of the settee should a need arise to bolt from the room. The tinkling sound of a bell filled the space, and just as suddenly as the sound started, a different house-elf from the one that opened the door popped into view. A tea tray floated in from the door, settling on the table between him and Narcissa.
Her eyes burned into his as she sipped her tea, and Harry’s heart sped. What was he supposed to think of this? Malfoy was...
Harry didn’t know what he thought of this Nigel character. He might be wealthy and have impeccable taste, but besides that, what did Draco see in him? His looks were unremarkable, and his manners downright rude, and somehow he couldn’t picture Draco being attracted to someone like him for long. But what did he know, it was less than a week since he’d discovered that Draco was gay. And why should he care?
Harry shrugged. “I go out at all hours of night. We can try someplace different this time, if you like. Maybe you could brew a cuppa while I go down the street and Summon my broom?”
Harry nodded. “Righto, see you then.”
Draco was too tired to do anything but chuckle a little. Right now, he just wanted to bask in the sunlight of Harry’s presence, filtering through the quiet forest of their satiation. The music from downstairs faded into the distance as he dropped into sleep, with Harry’s arms wrapped around him.
Harry appeared to be struggling with himself, but he eventually went with, “As long as you don’t leave my side, I think we can handle anything.”
Draco was prone on the couch for once, rather than in his usual determined upright posture. He groaned and brought the palms of his hands to his eyes, willing himself to erase the delectable images of Harry dancing across his brain. “Damn it, I don’t know. It’s not just that he’s sexy. He has this
he thought – then was overcome with moans of pleasure as Draco picked up the pace, somehow still maintaining eye contact throughout. Eagerly, as if he wanted Harry as close to his Adam’s apple as possible, he devoured him, until Harry could feel the tingle of impending orgasm. “Agh – no – not yet, I want to see you come first.”
Apparently Luna posed no threat, and the new Auror turned her attention to Feruza while Ginny walked over to the clothing racks at the far side of the room with Luna to change. Harry took a moment to brief Hermione on what had happened, including the part about Draco being taken to St. Mungo’s. She squeezed one of his shoulders in sympathy, and asked if he’d had any news, which prompted Harry to check the Protean coin yet again. This time, he was able to pick up on some tiny writing that had appeared, which he handed to Hermione for help reading (he was growing less impressed with his Burberry glasses by the minute).
Draco scoffed. “Hardly. Do you know what it does to a person, turning off the sex tap like that?” His long fingers were knotted together, and Harry was surprised to see hurt in his eyes. “Not just the sex, either. I missed having you around.” It looked like it took some effort to say, but Harry felt warm inside after hearing that Draco had missed him.
Draco’s eyes flew open. It had just occurred to him that the words didn’t just describe Harry, but could describe him, with a slightly different definition of “unfortunate.” Or did that make him a narcissist? He wasn’t accustomed to questioning himself in this way, and cast about for a different topic. “Have I told you about Nigel yet?”
Trevor the Troll-Blood came jogging toward them. “All right there, Mr. Potter?” He looked at Ginny and Feruza and frowned. “You all had better come with me, I think your bodyguard was injured in the ruckus.” He jerked a knobby thumb over his shoulder and extended his other arm to Ginny. “Right this way.”
“Not too long.” She entered after he waved one hand to pull up a chair. “I wanted to tell you something. Not entirely work-related.”
Harry blinked, taken aback by the reminder. “Good to know, thanks.” He started to bundle the scarf around his neck, then saw Draco looking at him with what could have been either disgust or amusement. “What?”
“Godric bless us, why does everything you do to me feel
Harry gamely peered at the label. The ingredients were mostly innocuous, but one caught his attention: “essence of Felix Felicis.” He looked more closely at the contents of the bottle, and saw that indeed there was a faint sparkle of gold, though much less potent than a full dose would be.
Harry snorted and brought his hands down to tickle Draco’s sides, but he was too quick and spun away. “Let me play you one more song, Harry, and then we can stop for a bit.”
“When was the last time you flew on a broomstick?”
“Oh really? Where is he, still shacked up with his beloved prince?”
Meanwhile, Harry didn’t know what to do with the exquisite new clothes they had sent home with him. He settled for hanging them in a special place in his closet, and admired them as he changed into something more comfortable.
Besides exploring a different area of London (The Black Cap pub is unfortunately out of business, although The World’s End and The Underworld are still very much in business, pandemic hurdles aside), this chapter felt like an excuse for me to explore Harry’s and Draco’s personas by opposites. Why wouldn’t Harry fall apart after isolating himself for too long and start drinking and flirting to cope, while Draco chooses to stay at home cleaning and waiting around for Harry before launching into nurturing mode?
sort for myself, thanks. You should know that already, you tosser.” Draco was definitely smiling by now, and Harry felt light, as if a cloud had floated aside, leaving radiant possibility in its stead. “What d’you say we go for a walk?”
, he thought to himself,
not half an hour ago. She crossed one long Ferragamo’ed leg over the other, and Draco was impressed despite himself. This girl had
“Yes, yes, of course. And we will continue be as discreet as possible, before publishing your interview in the Saturday evening edition.” Hodges’ attention had turned back to Harry, who was even pinker than Draco felt by now. “I think I speak for all of our readers when I ask, when did you know that you were attracted to men?”
Ron looked a bit embarrassed at this new display of affection, and changed the subject. “You mentioned Ginny. Don’t tell me she knows about the two of you already.”
“At a wedding. How did that make you feel?”
Draco noticed his not-too-subtle attempt at changing the subject, and let it pass for the time being, despite his growing irritation toward Harry. Why, after bothering him about it for so long, and introducing him to his closest friends, was he so reluctant to be seen in the public eye with Draco? There was, of course, the delicate question of Draco’s mother, and whether she was ready to learn that her son was dallying with his former arch-nemesis from school. As long as Draco didn’t have to tell her personally, he didn’t so much mind the idea of her reading about it in the papers. Kept it at an emotional distance, until he felt ready to confront her.
“Erm, both? Sort of. I think we had different ideas of how to go about it initially, but this is the compromise we landed on.”
Harry’s head was spinning. ‘You want me to try these on
“I was hoping for librarian.” The look in his eyes was wicked when Draco turned his gaze back on him.
“Harry!” Hermione rushed forward and gave him a halfway hug as he rose awkwardly from the couch. “I came as soon as I could.” Seeing him looking sideways at her companion, she added, “This is Lucy Hawken, she’s a recent addition to the Auror team.” When Harry still looked shifty, she reassured him, “She specializes in cases involving stalking, harassment or blackmail, among other things, and she’s going to be helping us with getting Ginny to a safe house.”
Harry was almost gleeful in his response. “Brilliant. Let me just take care of a few things before we head out.”
It felt like a peculiar dream, yet Harry knew upon waking that today would be a little different, because of his anticipated return to Malfoy’s home. Normally he wouldn’t have cared how he looked, but Malfoy’s frightening attention to detail had left him feeling more self-conscious about his appearance than usual. He finally emerged from his closet with an outfit that felt passable, if not outright fashionable. New trainers, newish jeans, and a button-down shirt that Ginny had said made him look “distinguished,” whatever that meant.
Harry relished the moment of peace afforded him while she bustled into the other room. Pain and ear trauma aside, he was feeling supported in a way that he had not felt in a long time. Being in close contact with someone like Draco Malfoy was exciting, and breath-taking, but it was not exactly comforting.
She punched him none too gently in the arm. “You know what I mean. His view toward Muggles and anyone who is not one hundred percent Wizard has changed. Just the fact that he and Harry are together, is a beautiful testament to the possibility of unity.” She was growing misty-eyed over her Brandy Alexander, and Draco wondered with alarm if it was more Brandy than Alexander.
They ended up on the couch this time, and Harry surprised Draco by asking if he could bottom. “I want to see what it feels like for you.”
The light that shot out of his palm was small, and quick, undulating as if underwater. It darted away from him before he could get a good look at it, and he suddenly remembered that he didn’t need the glasses that were perched on his nose. Fumbling them off his face, he looked wildly around the room, seeking out the streak of silver he had produced.
Under normal circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the name. But tonight was not normal by any stretch of the imagination. Not for him.
They were silent for a moment, Harry taking off his glasses and pinching the bridge of his nose while he looked upward, and Hermione blowing her nose into a hanky.
“Why don’t you think about it while I look for your wand. Maybe it’s in your wardrobe, it’s certainly large enough to hide all sorts of things.”
That made sense to Draco, and he nodded. “If it’s any consolation, I was a bit obsessed with you too. And I definitely knew that I liked other men.”
Draco left them to their decorating schemes, and sought out the coatrack in the break room. Thank goodness the holidays were not upon them yet, otherwise he would be forced to participate more in the upkeep of the store. Autumn was a few weeks away, and he could still afford to exert the minimum amount of effort at his workplace as the hordes of summer tourists slowed to a trickle. Be that as it may, the day was surprisingly chilly, and he had chosen to wear a light form-fitting jacket in distressed denim that had drawn many admiring glances on the way in. Or maybe they were admiring him in it. Not that he cared just then.
Thankfully, there were funny parts too. Draco found himself smiling more than once at Harry’s stories about getting back at the Dursleys, and was surprised when Harry reached over to switch on a lamp. He had not noticed how dark it was getting.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice was calm but fuzzed with anxiety, or so Harry perceived while slightly sozzled still, parked as he was in the middle of a field of panic.
His vaguely anxious look tugged at Draco’s heart, and prompted him to pull up his feet and lean into Harry like a cat demanding to be petted. Harry’s outstretched arm tightened around him, and his shoulder proved to be a solid, comforting place to rest one’s head. Draco closed his eyes for just a moment and submitted to the feeling of Harry’s hand stroking his hair. He felt so treacley, it was a wonder he hadn’t stuck to anything.
Before he could voice any of his concerns, Draco nudged Harry none too gently toward the table behind, until he was sitting squarely on its surface. Wedged between Harry’s legs, he leaned over him to lay a wide circle of kisses about his neck, cheekbones, eyebrows, and nose. “Great mother of Godric, Harry, I want you so much.” The circling continued, and Harry was starting to feel dizzy from Draco’s fevered attentions, his already on-edge nerve endings set aflame. “I want you just for myself, and I also want to show the world what you mean to me.” His eyes were open as he cupped Harry’s face and stared him down. “But I want to do it on my terms, not my family’s.” He raked his gaze across Harry as if he were mentally undressing him. “I hope you can understand that at least.”
Harry winced. “You’re right, I did say that. But I still care about him, at least enough to care that he’s all right.”
Harry swung one leg over the broom. “Why don’t you get on behind me, I’m not sure how kindly she takes to being steered by others.”
“Yeah, from school. Color me surprised, I didn’t know he swung both ways.”
The demons came out at night, when Draco had read his last sentence and turned out the light next to his four-poster bed, an import from Malfoy Manor. He still left a soft pink crystal light on in the hallway, to avoid tripping over anything if he got up in the night, he told himself. But if he was perfectly honest, it gave him solace and made him feel less alone. Any nocturnal visitors of the human kind were invariably sent home after their tryst had ended, no matter how late the hour. Better not to have someone around when he woke up from the nightmares, heart pounding, reaching out after his father. Better not to let them hear him muttering about the Dark Lord, or Death Eaters, or Dumbledore, in his sleep. He wasn’t sure that he did, but given the usual tenor of his dreams, he didn’t want to take any chances.
“That’s quite all right, Harry. There are plenty of other things I’d rather be doing in private.”
“I was just thinking about what you said earlier, about being a glutton for punishment. It’s an odd expression, you know?” He started to gather up Draco’s clothes and offered an armful back to him before picking up his own. “Do you mean to say that you get off on being insulted? Or is it a pain thing?”
Harry brought his hands halfway to his face before remembering that he was in a public location and on view as a public figure. “Right, how could I forget that? I’d really like to get going now, if you don’t mind.”
Draco pushed up his blindfold and lifted himself onto his elbows. “It’s pretty simple, just do what I did earlier with my finger, then add a couple more fingers and finish with your cock.” He smiled at Harry’s uncertainty. “Don’t worry, I keep things very clean down there. As long as you keep the lubrication coming, I’ll get off in no time. And you probably will too.”
“What about you, Hermione, don’t you have work?”
Draco’s tone took a beseeching turn. “Harry, don’t you see, the Christmas Ball is the perfect occasion because it’s at the Ministry. Can’t get any more public than that.” His hands found their way back to Harry’s. “I know you’re a private person by nature, but in this case, the personal really does need to become political. We  - you – could do so much good by making this appearance. Just think of all the young Wizards and Witches who will be able to look up to you and follow your example, without shame or fear of being rejected for their identities.” He kissed Harry’s hands, one after the other, and trained his stormy blue gaze upon Harry’s steady green. “Together, we could make history.”
“Mmm. Do you consider yourself to be a lucky man?”
He immediately stepped forward to silence Harry with a kiss, pouring all of his pent-up frustration from the past few weeks into this moment. He knew they didn’t have long, and with his anger temporarily swept aside, this was the best way he could think of to soften the blow for Harry.
Harry waved his hand away. “No, I should be all right on my own. Thanks for the beer, it was very nice to meet you.” He gave Brandon one last long look into his lovely blue-green eyes, then made his way toward the exit.
Feruza finally spoke, with an accent Draco couldn’t place. “Who is this brother of yours, and when can I poke fun at him too.”
Lots of exposition, I know - thanks for bearing with me. :) There will be less exposition in future chapters, and more dialogue.
“Draco, I don’t expect you to understand, but
“Granger,” Draco spoke through gritted teeth. “Look in the bag I brought, you’ll find some a Wound-Cleaning Potion and ingredients for a Draught of Peace. If you let me go, I can use them.”
“Right, of course. Well – “ Brandon swallowed again and Harry watched his Adam’s apple dip toward his collar – “if you’ve got someone already, I suppose you could bring them along too.”
“I’ll have to think about it, they are awfully close. What about you, do you have anyone to talk to?” Harry had been curious about whether Draco had maintained contact with any of his old school friends, or if they had all gone the way of former Death Eaters and scattered.
That did it. Draco’s heart was officially dust in his chest, sifting through his ribcage into his gut in a rancid heap. “I don’t expect it of you, no. But - I had hoped –“
“He’s a celebrity, among some circles, maybe that has something to do with it. Only, he doesn’t seem to want to have anything to do with those circles any more. I don’t quite understand why it bothers him so much.”
“Yes, I think. That box on that desk over there, with the funny blank window in front.”
Nigel’s head subsided out of view, and Draco murmured something to him before turning back to Harry. “I have to get to work in about an hour, so if you don’t mind waiting here and trying on the rest of the clothes you have with you, the two of us can do one final sweep of the men’s department. Just remember to pose in front of the mirror with each item, Nigel’s spelled it to take pictures.”
Harry had keeled over to one side, overcome by the pounding sensation on the side of his head and the lingering taste of beer in his mouth. He thought longingly of his missing ear, and wondered whether they would ever be united again. “Hermione, I have to find my ear.”
Trouble was, Harry no longer felt clear in his own mind. Whether it was the beer or just his own conscience coming belatedly to life, he had started to feel distinctly off about being there, in a gay pub, with a man who wasn’t Draco. A perfectly decent, good-looking man, whom Harry might have wanted to pursue in an alternate, Draco-free reality. Harry felt momentarily enlightened by this realization, and broke into a smile that was immediately reflected back on Brandon’s face.
Hermione’s face lit up with the familiar expression that usually came with a new idea. “Harry, do you still have the Marauder’s Map?”
Draco sighed. So that was what this was all about. “Look, we don’t have much time left. But I’ll tell you, okay? I did do magic, right before that bugger shot me. I think I was in shock, or something, but it happened so effortlessly, and I’m glad I did it. I sent a Patronus to my mother, without needing to use a wand or say the incantation out loud. I wanted her to know that I was all right, and that I didn’t care about finishing out my year any more, and that I wanted to see her. Harry, I think – I was pretty nearly convinced that I was going to die.”
The moment was filled with tension, or at least it seemed so to Draco, who had not seen Ron since eighth year. Harry’s reaction, however, was to sweep Ron into a hug once he reached the bottom of the stairs. “Ron, it’s really good to see you. It’s been too long.”
“I don’t know, I just Apparated to the first place I thought of.”
As the sun dripped closer to the horizon, the light changed to fill the main living room with a warm golden glow. It was into this space that Draco would make his first entry, and Harry felt relieved that at least the window was large enough to provide a decent view, if they looked out at the right angle.
“Hardly. It’s a stag, although I suppose you got the hoof and horns part right.”
She nodded. Neither one of them could fault the other for taking the path they had, as vast as the differences were between them. After the fall of Lord V, Hermione had returned to her studies with renewed zeal, setting her sights on passing her N.E.W.T.s with flying colors and carving out a place for herself and her interests at the Ministry. Harry, on the other hand, after going through a year of Auror training and working for the Ministry for another year, felt too much pressure to live up to his previous reputation, and had decided to take a break from the Wizarding world, in as gentle a way as possible. He kept in light touch with his closest friends, but the onslaught of heightened renown after defeating the Dark Lord had been too much for him to handle.
Harry Summoned water for them both, and watched Draco’s throat as he drank greedily. “Did I do that?” he asked, bringing his fingers to the dark bruise that was coming out on Draco’s pale skin. “Sorry, I must have been more rough than I thought.”
The koi only lasted for a few minutes longer, but it was plenty of time for them to admire its delicate, fae-like beauty. Draco held on to Harry’s hand, unable to speak. The koi whisked forward in one last movement and dissolved into Draco’s chest, and he sighed, as if he’d been holding his breath.
Draco leaned forward until his full weight lay on both arms, his long hair swishing forward along his cheekbones. “Say that to me again,” he purred in a low voice.
“My mother insisted that I take dancing lessons as a child, in preparation for the Yule Ball, and any other social functions I might be required to attend. The disco moves I learned more recently, after I moved here. Turns out boredom and lack of real friends can be a motivator for picking up strange talents.”
When he arrived at the den, music was playing softly from a Wizarding radio in the corner, something jazz-like. The lighting was dim yet he could see everything clearly, including the sight of Draco sorting through cards on one side of the couch, looking like he wouldn’t object to Harry sitting next to him. Harry sat, then watched in paralyzed wonder as Draco turned toward him and began to straighten his collar, his face mere inches from Harry’s. A tiny smile hovered about his mouth as he made eye contact, a stray lock of hair falling forward briefly over one eyebrow before he shook his head to flick it back into place. A few breathless moments later, Draco returned to his side of the couch and resumed shuffling, acting as if it was perfectly normal to invade Harry’s space in that way.
Once the conversation had ended, however, Draco dropped his head into his hands and stayed there a while, slumped before the fireplace in his London townhouse. He now spent a fair amount of time in London, returning to the Manor only when his parents invited him over for a meal or social function a few times a week. The bulk of his time now was spent doing research at various institutions, particularly St. Mungo’s. He did not know how far his interests in alchemy, runes, potions, and Muggle medical history would take him, but he had not yet lost his drive for learning as much as possible, with the eventual goal of disseminating his discoveries throughout the world. It was as if he wanted to erase all the misdeeds of the Malfoy bloodline, by doing as much as he could for the human species as a whole.
“What – in holy hell – was that about?”
, as Fleur would say.” She got up in pursuit of something less strong to drink, bringing the bottle of sparkling water back to the living room. “How did we end up here, Harry?”
Draco tentatively smiled at him. “You’re a bloody Gryffindor, of course your feelings are going to get riled up a little around me. I’m a Slytherin fiend, just look at my outfit.”
Instead of questioning the fact that he could now taste the atmosphere and see the sounds of music spiraling through the Wizarding radio, he felt overcome by an urge to slide down a bannister. Funnily enough, there was one in the hallway, presided over by the floating chandelier that had captivated his attention on that night not so long ago, when Nigel had paved the way to Draco.
Draco struggled against his bonds again, his face twisting with the effort. Harry had never seen his hair this messy outside of bed, and he was promptly overcome by a desire to touch him. His knees seemed to be cooperating again, and he was able to stand up and look Draco in the eyes, up close. “Finite Incantatum.”
Harry resigned himself once more to trotting along behind the conversation. He did admit that Ginny looked spectacular, in a small strapless black number that plunged at the neckline and ended in feathers at the hem. Watching Draco gush over her, he was struck by a wistful feeling that there were some parts of Draco he would never fully understand, just as there were parts of him that Draco would never get. And yet, he loved him wholeheartedly.
“Ta.” The shimmering aureole faded, and Harry was left alone in the deepening twilight.
“Why don’t we fly over the city this time, take in the nightscape? I know it’s late, but there should still be plenty of lights on.”
Mobile phones were not yet endowed with the many capabilities they have now, so I took liberties with magically altering Nigel’s for convenience's sake. Plus I like the idea of Muggle-Wizard collaboration as an explanation for some of the miraculous leaps in technology that we now take for granted.
It took all of three seconds before Draco started laughing. “Barry… Waters?” he wheezed out. “What are you, a porn star from the seventies?”
Once he passed through the gates of Malfoy Manor, dressed in the most comfortable formal robes he could find without feeling sloppy, he began to regret his curiosity. They had probably just invited him out of politeness, now that he was on the Board of Education for the Auror’s Preparatory Academy. It was highly unlikely that Draco had anything to do with it, and it was equally unlikely that Draco would want anything to do with him.
Draco shivered involuntarily at the thought. “Not planning to run into them ever again, thanks. Isn’t it an enormously difficult spell?”
Harry raised both eyebrows. “Oh really? And why wasn’t I aware of this?”
“Listen, I’m not sure what you’ve got planned, but if you’re interested, I could take you to The Underworld this weekend. I have another friend who works there and might be able to get us some tickets to a concert.” Brandon’s eyes had skirted sideways and his finger was running laps around the edge of his glass again, now empty. “No pressure, of course, but if you’re into that sort of thing.” He made eye contact with Harry right as he spoke the final phrase, and the meaning couldn’t have been more clear.
Full of himself or not, he was able to make it to the end of the session without falling apart completely. The advice she left him with was to reflect on what was working in the relationship so far, and to try reaching out to Harry again and explain to him what he needed that was lacking. Easier said than done, but after day five of no Harry, he would try anything.
Harry followed his lead and found himself gaping at the chandelier floating overhead in the stairwell. It consisted of several concentric loops that moved slowly in circles, flashing various rainbow lights off the crystals that dripped downwards from each loop. When he looked back down, Malfoy had disappeared into the kitchen at the end of the hall, and Harry peeked through the doors that flanked either side of the foyer. To his right, there was a small dining room with a table for six. To the left, a den with dim lighting and pudgy armchairs arranged across from what appeared to be a locked cupboard.
It was all Draco could do to not stare at her with his mouth open. Was she that strategic in her approach to friendships, and were the pieces really going to fall into place as easily as she was suggesting? He had his doubts because he and Harry both were so effing stubborn, but he wanted to acknowledge her effort in any case, regardless of outcome. “Mother... thank you. For caring, and for letting me know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Their conversations took a darker turn as the news about the attack in the States continued to dominate the headlines, and more than once they started debating over whether Wizards should intervene.
Several hours and a couple drinks later that evening, Draco finally felt prepared to face the truth once more. Potter had not truly rejected him, he had rejected Potter, out of cowardice and fear, and an overdone sense of respect for the bonds he valued with his family. It had felt important to him at the time, and it had been wonderful to reconnect with his mother and rebuild his relationship with his father, but now it just felt – empty. They cared about his wellbeing, but not in the way that Harry could, because in their minds, his wellbeing was inextricably linked with how to maintain their power and who they associated with. It was a ruthless yet effective game to play, and even with the new side of his father coming to light that had inspired him into following his own healing path, Draco had mostly accepted it. But nothing they had done for him so far could fill the void left behind by Harry, and he felt ashamed that he had taken so long to do anything about it. He was finally ready to ease up on his obsession with proving his worth on his own, and to focus on rebuilding his friendships, including with Harry. And if friendship came around to something more, well… Draco was hardly going to try and put a stop to it, was he?
“I’m sorry, I knew we shouldn’t’ve stayed up so late.” Draco did look mildly penitent, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to his lips, steamed coral by the warmth of his drink. The memories of the night before surged back into his brain, and he was suddenly very interested in getting a better look at Draco with no clothes on. Or possibly finding out what those lips felt like on other parts of his body. Harry could feel a rising reaction between his legs, and hastened to find a way to guide his mind away from treacherous territory.
He passed by a gaming arcade and shuddered at the sounds of mayhem floating out through the open door. Honestly, how people could revel in pretend violence so much, was beyond him. He had seen enough of actual violence, inflicted upon others and himself, to last a lifetime, and he was only twenty-one. Gaining the entrance of the bookshop, he was surprised to see a new display set up in the window, featuring brooms, hockey sticks, and books about sports, including Quidditch. Draco could not see the appeal of pushing a flat disc around on ice, but far be it from him to object to spreading the good word about Wizarding sports.
As Harry dithered across the hall, Draco was very much engrossed in speaking to Pansy. It was the first time they’d talked since she’d left Hogwarts after seventh year, and it was intense. Most of their private conversations had been intense, when they weren’t drinking each other under the table and doing questionable things afterward.
“Hmmm?” Draco was still half reclined, nibbling at a well-buttered crumpet. “What’s that?”
That was Harry’s cue to make a hasty retreat back to the place where he should have been all along, in the den. The image of Draco on the bed was burned across his brain, and Harry didn’t know whether to laugh out loud or claw his eyes from his skull. The urge to laughter came from the sheer cognitive dissonance of seeing how much his image Draco had changed since the time of their schoolboy rivalry, and the eye-clawing, well – he didn’t know where that impulse came from. New information overload, perhaps. He was also bewildered to realize that the sight had sent his nerve ends tingling in all manner of unexpected places.
“He sounds dreamy. Are you two – you know – intimate?
Draco was on a mission, and contrived to play something of everything. He had music from each decade, mostly from British and American artists, with a few wild cards thrown in. Harry put up with his ongoing commentary as he rotated out records, but by time they got to the end of the seventies, he was starting to get antsy. When Draco put on the Bee Gee’s “Staying Alive,” Harry couldn’t resist moving to the beat a little. Draco looked him over with amusement, then broke into a flowing sequence of movement that would have made Travolta’s jaw drop. It took some slow-dancing to “How Deep Is Your Love?” before Harry was able to recover.
Harry’s reply was interrupted by a rising murmur from the crowd that had gradually materialized behind them. Craning his neck around to investigate the source, his heart dropped into his stomach when he saw Draco entering the room. He looked wan, but well-dressed as usual, with no sign of injury. To Harry’s relief, he did not appear to be handcuffed or shackled in any way, even after sitting down in the highly uncomfortable chair at the center of the room.
Harry’s mouth twitched, but he held his laughter in check. “You mean, like one of those colorful fish in a koi pond?”
Potter looked taken aback, but after a moment of hesitation, he said, “All right.”
“Nigel’s not my anything, let’s just try each other out for size and see where this goes.”
Harry was up on his feet before he had completely thought things through. “Hermione, I have to go see him. Maybe I can find out something. If his mother will let me.”
Harry was not prepared for the onslaught of luxury that was Harrod’s. It called to mind his first visit to Diagon Alley, as a fledgling Wizard with little idea of what lay in store for him. Abundance lay everywhere, and without Draco’s guiding eye, he would have turned around and fled, or drowned in it.
Buffeted as he felt by windiness of spirit, he was tempted to go for a rare pre-sunset broom ride. The weather was mostly cold in late November, but with a warming spell and plenty of layers underneath his Invisibility Cloak, he imagined it would be manageable to take a quick flight over the city. And if he happened to end up somewhere near Draco’s, well… but he quickly nipped that thought in the bud.
“Godric, I’ve missed this,” Harry murmured, and Draco gave an involuntary laugh at the near exact echo between his thoughts and Harry’s words. “I’ve missed everything about you, I’ve been going half mad without – “ and then he was under again, swimming through the tireless cascade of kisses and caresses exchanged between them.
Harry shuddered at the residual heat wave that engulfed them both. They collapsed onto their sides in tandem, spooning on the sheets as they watched the tide of passion ebb away to a distant throbbing hum. The raggedness of their breathing slowed, and Harry’s thoughts turned toward the revelations of the day.
The next thing Harry knew, he was staggering on a rooftop with an unpleasant sensation on the left side of his head, which had been closest to the threat of impact. The unpleasantness quickly sharpened into pain, and Harry’s worst fear was confirmed when he touched one hand to the source of the pain and discovered that his ear was missing. With blood welling down the side of his face and his glasses hanging askew, he did the only thing he could reasonably think of doing in the moment, and that was to spell Hermione.
Harry flinched at the mention of tourists, thinking of the pleasant American student he’d met and lusted after. “Yeah, well, this one happened to be gay-friendly. Lucky me.”
“What do you make of the rumors about this place being haunted?” Harry was about two-thirds through his beer and feeling just dandy.
the whole Wizarding world knows that I’m gay, and dating their hero, and studying Muggle customs. Any chance they might have at reintegrating, becomes much more difficult if they prove themselves to be just as bigoted and narrow-minded as before.”
Harry chuckled weakly as Draco writhed in mirth. “Very funny. You try picking out a name, it’s not as easy as it sounds.”
Draco shook his head. “I may be gay, but I think I speak on behalf of most of the male species when I say,
“I still think we should call her,” he whispered later, when their passion was spent. “Ask how she and her teammates are doing. Maybe invite them over for a party.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, but it was lost on Harry, who was almost asleep. Draco tucked him in with a sigh and cast a quick Scourgify over the sheets before settling down for the night.
Draco nodded. “Yes, I understand. But when you do have the time.”
He nodded and turned back toward the entrance. “See you when the dust settles.”
It turned out that there was every possible type of juice imaginable. Harry, cornered between Draco’s indifference and the nurse’s growing impatience, panicked and ordered four kinds, including a fruit he had never heard of. The nurse took his order, then asked, “Would Mr. Potter like anything to drink?”
She nodded, encouraging him, “He’s at the Ministry still, but who knows how much longer he’ll be there. I would hurry, if I were you.”
It was for this reason that he gave in, against his wilier Slytherin instincts. “Well, all right. As long as you don’t mention my name and as long as you don’t think she’ll spread the word to anyone, like Weasley.”
Draco saw his therapist one more time before the interview. Rather than mention the upcoming events to her, and risk revealing more about the Wizarding world than was advisable, he decided to bring up his interest in alchemy instead.
Draco was floored. “How long were you planning on keeping this from me?”
Not that it was a bad thing, Harry reminded himself. After all, hadn’t his greatest hero, Albus Dumbledore, been a queer Wizard too?
“Draco, what do you want to do with yourself, once you finish your Muggle immersion program?” He waved a half-eaten chocolate about, finishing the bite in his mouth before continuing. “Surely you don’t want to keep living here and working at Bedknobs.”
“Wena’s wand, girl, I knew that was a good pick,” Draco all but exclaimed as he abandoned the polo rack and Harry. “How does the fit work for you? Do you like it or do you prefer something more flowing?”
Draco nodded in agreement. “As long as you don’t think we’ll be seen.”
Harry wondered to himself.
Harry shrugged and picked up the menu. “As long as the food’s good.”
“Very funny, Potter.” Draco poured the tea and used the tongs to put sugar and lemon in his own cup. “Milk for you again?”
A new plan is laid for protecting Ginny, and Harry and Hermione jump to conclusions about Draco.
“So you do have some Wizarding friends.”
Harry nodded and accepted the cup Draco offered him. After a couple sips, he rearranged his seat on the bed and leaned forward. “I have an idea.”
Draco gave up on fiddling with the teakettle for the moment and turned on Harry with a conspiratorial glint in his eye. “I think it might be time to call in sick, and have Harry Potter take care of me. Nurse me back to health.”
It had been a while since Draco had seen his therapist, and he felt a bit guilty about it. True to form, she seemed to understand, and it was not long before Draco was pouring out his soul about what a relief it was to finally express some of his love for Harry to Harry’s friends. “Even if we don’t always get along, it’s like, I don’t know – we at least have that one thing in common, that we love him.” He stopped and laughed at himself. “What am I saying, pretty much my entire world is in love with Harry. I just wish…”
The question was clearly rhetorical, and Draco carried on in the silence broken only by Harry’s moans as he discovered yet another deep recess of pleasurable sensation. Draco had gone completely non-verbal at this point, just managing to focus his mind upon Harry and all the moves that he knew Harry liked. It had begun to feel like a well-rehearsed dance, and Draco performed it to the maximum of his ability.
The Z seemed to take forever before going into effect for him, but Harry noticed right away that Ginny and Feruza did not seem to be the least bit shy about showing their affection for each other. “Erm, excuse me,” he hedged. “Do the two of you want some privacy? Draco has a guest bedroom upstairs, if you need it.”
Harry’s breath gusted wildly into his neck as they both found release at the same time. The power of their mutual climax throbbed through them, and once they'd landed a little, Draco congratulated himself before planting a final kiss on his forehead. He toppled once more onto the mattress and curled up cat-like alongside Harry. The physicality of everything had become exhausting, and he just wanted to lie there, allowing his mind free rein while the pace of his body slowed.
Draco’s expression sharpened. “Yeah, I do. I just have to be particular about who I trust, and for what end.”
Harry paused mid-movement, looking toward Draco with wide eyes. “You’re joking. What about Goyle, or Zabini? Parkinson?”
What felt like hours later, Harry heard the door open and looked up from where he was dozing on the couch, adjacent to Ginny and Feruza, who had fallen asleep. His glasses were removed, having given him a headache earlier from their unfamiliar contours, and it took him a moment before he could identify the visitors. It was Hermione, still dressed in fancy robes, and someone he didn’t recognize.
“All right, look – Hermione” – the name felt misplaced in his mouth – “I know I have no right to say it, not after everything you have gone through together, and the way I’ve treated you all. But I think I’m in love with your friend, and I don’t know what to bloody do about it.”
Before she could say anything, Harry leapt in. “Yes, I’ve heard. What I’m not clear on though is whether he is off the hook altogether, or if there’s another matter to attend to before he can be called a free man.” He looked from Draco to his mother again, hoping she could sense his sincerity. “You see, I cared about the outcome of this case because I care so very deeply about Draco. I don’t want to see his life go to waste, and I don’t want to lose him.” His courage ran out at that point and he dropped his gaze to the floor, twisting his hands awkwardly in front of him. “Er, what I’m trying to say is – please don’t shut me out. I want to help.”
“You really didn’t need to do that,” Harry informed him. “It’s not the first time it’s happened, I could have managed on my own.”
Harry groaned. “I had completely forgotten,” he admitted, wincing again as she glared at him. “But I’m glad you brought it up.”
Draco looked lost in his hospital bed, his white-blond hair practically blending in with the pale background of the pillow he was propped up on. Harry was relieved to see that he did not seem to have many bandages, although they were probably hidden underneath the hospital-issue pajamas he wore. The dark circles under his eyes were worrisome, and Harry had to restrain himself from launching forward and covering him with kisses.
He swallowed and looked back down at the book in his hand, and Draco took a step forward to look. The page it was opened to had a full-length drawing of Potter on a broomstick, dressed in Quidditch robes. The likeness was close enough, but Draco doubted that any of the customers who came through a shop with a name like Bedknobs and Broomsticks Book Emporium would be likely to believe they were the same person.
Harry wanted nothing more than to hold Draco in his arms, but the closed-off look on Draco’s face prevented him. “Can I get you anything? Some water, or a tisane?”
“Ah. Your parents don’t approve of him?”
“Maybe a little. But who’s to say we’re not just wearing Christmas colors?”
“And gay,” Draco supplied helpfully. “Possibly the gayest gay that ever gayed.”
?” Residual tipsiness made his gestures more emphatic than usual, and Harry flinched as his hand came dangerously close to Harry’s nose. “Isn’t that every straight guy’s fantasy, to be in a threesome with two girls?”
Draco would not let it go until Harry promised him that they would get in touch with Ginny later that afternoon and arrange for their second visit to Harrods by the end of the week. In turn, Harry made him promise that they would only look for shoes, and not get caught up in trying every item in the store like the last time.
Draco shook his head at his thoughts as they approached his home. He couldn’t help admiring Harry’s boyish good looks as he sprang up to the door, taking the steps two at a time. How could he ever have thought he hated that face, those eyes, and the glasses that covered them? Well, he did sort of still hate the glasses, but he had not yet worked up to convincing Harry that he needed a new pair, let alone no glasses at all.
Harry gave up, he was definitely blushing now. “Um, no… Well, only a little.”
“Iwanthertobehappynomatterwhat.”
Nigel looked apologetic. “We need to see how they contrast with each other. And you may want to reconsider some of your rejects, that dark grey cashmere looked absolutely smashing on you.”
Clearly, circumstances had changed for both of them. And neither of them quite knew what to do about it.
Harry tried to picture himself at a concert in a basement with ghosts, and kept coming up with images of Draco floating above his bed, or blindfolded, or dancing to the Bee Gees.
He was still a bit bothered by it all once he got to bed, but the tension in his groin ached to be released, and so his temporary solution was to indulge in a delicious wank, casting a lubricating charm to make his hand slippery enough for the task. He came in no time, despite his tiredness, and his last thought before drifting off to sleep was,
Draco offered a hand, and Feruza proved to have a solid grip. “Draco Malfoy. Pleasure to meet you.” She nodded by way of response and said nothing. “So,” he segued, turning back to Ginny. “What brings you here, are you looking for anything in particular?”
Draco looked at him, with a calculating gleam in his eye. “Fine. One dinner. Tomorrow night, after I’m done with work.”
Draco seemed to have other ideas, however, clinched by the Draught of Peace he finally brewed for Harry. It didn’t seem to set off any misuse of magic alarms, since the making of the potion did not require any magical activity in itself once the ingredients were assembled. The last memory that Harry had of this very strange and exhausting night was of Draco’s arm wrapped around him from behind, as they lay spooning in bed on the side that favored Harry’s good ear. “Good night, love,” Harry thought he heard him say, but he might have imagined it.
“Hey, Luna.” She looked at him without the slightest hint of surprise, as if she’d been expecting him. “Thanks for your help, it’s much easier to get things done like this, in a quiet staging area. Rather than trying to figure it out on the ground.” He looked more closely at what she was doing, and was intrigued to see that she was carefully Transfiguring the robe beneath her hands, into a thick black coat. It looked very warm.
“You’re a right tour guide, you are,” Harry teased. “Next you’ll be telling me all about the latest exhibit at the Tate.” Draco smirked to himself, as he had indeed been contemplating his next daylight outing with Harry. So much the better if Harry thought of it first.
Harry squared off in front of Draco and put a hand on each shoulder. “Draco, my friend, now is the time to call upon
There were no objections, and it was not long before they sat down in the dining room across the hall and dug in. Harry thought of asking him about the record collection, but decided not to in case it brought up the subject of “picking up Muggles” again. Instead they ended up talking about fashion, and what had prompted Wizarding and Muggle fashion themes to diverge so widely over time. Harry was surprised to find that he was actually intrigued by the topic, although he had far less to offer in the way of conversation than the others did.
“You do know that I’m not infinitely wealthy,” Harry brought up when Draco handed him a pair of emerald cufflinks to try on. “I may have a vault full of Galleons from my parents, but I intend to make it last a lifetime, not just one day here.”
?” Hermione’s expression would have been priceless if Harry didn’t care so much what she thought of him. “Since when are the two of you on first-name terms?”
Draco had all but obliged when Harry realized that Draco was still completely dressed, with only a few ruckings-up here and there at the trousers and shirt collar. This needed to be remedied straight away, and Harry leveraged himself back up to standing as he tore Draco’s shirt the rest of the way off him. Silencing Draco with an open-mouthed kiss, Harry peeled off his clothing in record time, turning him around and trapping his delicate wrists against the tabletop so only Harry could touch him where it mattered. Harry came first, Draco not long after, writhing against Harry’s hands and cock.
“Hullo, Harry.” Nigel offered a hand to shake, and held onto Harry’s hand a bit longer than necessary. “It’s a pleasure to see you again, under more casual circumstances.” He spoke with a slight lisp that would have been almost charming, if Harry hadn’t just seen him finishing Draco off moments before.
ex shopping at a place like Harrods. With help from Nigel, no less. “Not all gifts come with strings attached, Harry.” His voice came out primly, and Draco wished he could have said it differently, but it was too late.
Draco was indignant. “I am not a kitten, and if I were, I wouldn’t be a fluffy one. Take that back, Harry. Or at least make up for it by calling me something sleek instead. Like an ocelot.”
It could have been worse, Draco supposed. Potter, once he got over his obvious chagrin at seeing him under these circumstances, at least made the effort to be polite and introduce himself to Draco’s friends.
“Oh come off it, it didn’t affect you that much, did it? This drink’s different, it’s more for energy but without some of the nastier side effects of caffeine. Don’t ask me to say the name though, I have no idea how to pronounce it.”
, he thought.
Harry didn’t answer right away, but did his best to hurry over to Draco and assess the damage. He didn’t show any bruises, and the only offensive object he might have been carrying was a small leather satchel, which had dropped to the ground in the struggle. His eyes were half-closed and he appeared to be breathing, to Harry’s relief.
Harry glanced at the clock in the corner. It was early still, the minute hand barely past midnight, and yet he wondered if staying on with Draco wouldn’t lead to more confusing feelings. What those feelings might be, he couldn’t say exactly, but the tightness in his lower abdomen told him that Something Could Happen.
Draco gets very Slytheriney after Ginny gives him an idea. For those of you who might be squeamish (or not), there's bit of spontaneous sexy fun toward the end, not followed by sleep for once. ;)
Many thanks for more excellent beta support from Kbrick. My memory of how the Patronus Charm works was a little foggy when I first wrote this chapter, and there may still be some aspects of it that are not strictly canon, but for the sake of story development between the characters I chose to leave it as it is. The same holds true for Draco’s wand. Also, I’m curious to see if anyone caught the BtVS Easter egg buried in one of Draco’s lines. :)
She laughed. “I didn’t either, until Hermione got involved. Apparently she watches it with her parents and has all five seasons taped. It’s really quite addictive, once you get over its faults. I don’t think there were any Wizards involved in making the show, seeing as they got quite a few magical facts wrong.”
“I thought you wanted to be anonymous. Getting rid of the glasses would be a perfect start. Cast a glamour on the scar, no more Harry Potter the Hero, just another ordinary if singularly gorgeous man.”
“Well, if it’s any help, I could refer you to mine. You’d probably have to go under an assumed name though, she knows a bit too much about you for a Muggle. The fictional version of you, that is.”
“Well, I suppose I can overlook it this time.” Draco had all but forgotten his breakfast plate, which lay perilously close to the edge of the side table next to him. He looked at Harry expectantly. “Go on, what is it?”
Draco resumed toweling his hair dry. “Honestly, I’d forgotten too, until I saw you hold it again. It feels like forever since all that took place.”
Draco’s smirk faded. “Well, the interview happened. I think it went well, but Harry’s been a nervous wreck ever since. I’ve never seen him like this, I had to force him to drink a Draught of Peace and go to bed early. Can’t have him looking overwrought when we make our grand entrance tomorrow.“
“I’m sorry, what did you say?”
Harry blanched. “Oh no. This is not happening again, I can’t have the two of you ganging up on me. Not for another seven thousand pounds!” The dry look Ginny gave him mirrored Draco’s feelings exactly, and he suddenly didn’t care so much that she and Harry had once shagged. This woman was on his wavelength, and if they had both Harry and an interest in high fashion in common, it stood to reason that there might be more worth finding out.
Safety, it turned out, was the street outside Draco’s home. Feeling ready to pop with the pressure of the situation, he wasn’t certain if he was more upset with the security oversight at the venue, for letting their wards on Apparition drop, or with himself for bringing Ginny here while leaving Draco behind to deal with the stranger.
“Sorry, you knew what would happen?” Harry couldn’t begin to fathom where this reaction was coming from.
Draco looked away for a moment, but didn’t let go of Harry’s hands. “Potter, you can be so fucking earnest sometimes, it’s hard to watch.” He ghosted one hand over Harry’s cheek. “I love it about you though, even if it annoys the hell out of me.”
A strong breeze had picked up, and Draco reluctantly broke away from the kiss with a shiver. “Come on, Harry, let’s go inside.”
He was thinking about Draco again, and it fucking
Draco snorted. “Really? Dinner? Isn’t that hopelessly not your forte?”
Harry laughed, without a shred of humor. “Hope? Hope doesn’t get you very far, it just strings you on, from one situation to the next, until you don’t have anything left at all to hold onto." His jaw had set in determination, and Draco knew there was no use in trying to talk him out of it. "I had so much hope when I first saw you at that bookshop, and look where it’s gotten us. I can’t do it any more, I can’t be the one holding it all together when I don’t even know what I want, let alone what’s best for you. I care about you so much, and I respect your decision, but I’m done with hope.” He emphasized his words by standing up, and Draco scrambled to follow. “Don’t bother coming back, Malfoy. I need to finish recovering on my own, and leave you out of it.”
Harry couldn’t help laughing a little as he ran his hand through Draco’s hair –
The knocking continued as Harry stumbled through the living room to the door. He was suddenly conscious of how ridiculous he must look, fully clothed in winter layers with a bloodstained blue turban wrapped around his head. But there was no help for it.
They lapsed into silence, sipping at their respective drinks. Harry looked sideways at Ginny and was struck again by how sophisticated she looked, despite being a year younger. He had to remind himself that they were all young still, even as they had been aged in spirit by the travails they had gone through.
Draco looked back in puzzlement. “What was that for?”
Harry had a funny feeling that Draco was letting on more than he could fathom, but before he could ask any questions, Draco whisked him on to the next department to pick out a selection of ties.
“Well, Harry – “ accompanied by an arm flung chummily over one shoulder – “what do you say to having a drink?”
Once he would have laughed at the idea of reconciling with the likes of Malfoy, but time had changed him. Time and the memory of testifying for Malfoy and his mother before the Wizengamot, in the wake of Voldemort’s demise. They had narrowly escaped imprisonment and settled for a temporary exile, if Harry remembered correctly.
Mysteria’s look spoke volumes, and Harry didn’t like the story they were spinning about him and Malfoy. With dignity, Mysteria rose to the occasion and kissed Malfoy once on each cheek. “His name is Harry, but I take it you know each other?”
She refused to sit down until Harry brought her the tea, as strong as he could make it. Draco was relieved that she sat in one of the chairs and not on the couch where he and Harry had been
“What makes you think I’ve been invited?”
She nodded and passed the message on to Ron, who seemed thrilled at the idea of having Harry over. “What do you say, pour at four?” He lowered his voice a little when the people around them twitched in fright at the volume of his enthusiasm. “Just so you know, Ginny might be there too.”
Feruza, it turned out, was fine, if a little shell-shocked herself. Harry, half-listening while he continued to kneel on the carpet, heard her explaining what happened to Ginny.
, Draco reminded himself. Friends were for people who needed them, and Draco did not want to be needy of anyone. He could practically see the need oozing out of everyone at the table, and it repelled him if he thought about it too closely. But he was willing to play along, because it meant one less boring night for Draco, trapped in the Muggle realm.
Carried away by his thoughts, he noticed belatedly that Harry had switched topics and was asking him a question. “Sorry, what?”
“Harry, don’t take it so much to heart. I wanted to be honest with you, is all.”
Harry shook his head. “I daren’t lose my trademark image,” he said with a rueful smile. “How would people recognize me otherwise?”
They had a good laugh at that, Draco falling on top of Harry before rolling to the side over the bedcovers. In the process he discovered that he had the most fantastic hard-on, and wanted to show Harry so he could have one too.
Harry grumbled to himself as he dressed and waved a hand over the covers to clean them.
Dinner with Ron and Hermione was arranged more quickly than Draco could have believed. It wasn’t like him to feel nervous, but after gaining new heights of emotional intimacy with Harry, the pit of his stomach was fluttering a little when they showed up outside Ron and Hermione’s home, a modest cottage on the outskirts of London. It might have been more related to their mode of transportation, as they had decided to use a Portkey rather than Apparating. Ron and Hermione had recently moved there and Harry was still spooked after the Splinching incident.
Draco cursed himself mentally. It was the first time he had let the word slip, despite the fact that he had been living among Muggles for the better part of the past year. He contemplated casting a quick Memory Modification spell at the end of their session, but took refuge in falsehood instead, as he wasn’t about to break the terms of his Muggle immersion contract so soon. “Yes, it’s a word I made up. For ordinary people.”
, but he kept that thought to himself.
As if in response, Draco stretched his arms overhead and bent one languid hand to run over his hair, yawning. Noticing Harry’s eye upon him, he grinned lopsidedly. “What do you say to a game of cards, Harry? I have a few sets in the den, Wizarding and Muggle. Your pick.”
Draco lay sprawled backward across the bed, his robe and legs fallen open to either side over the edge while Nigel worked his magic between them. It was not long before Draco tipped back his head with abandon, obviously cresting a wave of sensation, then bringing a hand down to bury in Nigel’s hair. Harry watched his lips move as he sat gradually upright, and how he smiled when Nigel rose to kiss him. They indulged in long, juicy snog before Draco slapped a naked buttock and made to stand up.
history of it, not the fictional one – got me thinking about how badly humans wanted magic and its power to be real. And yet, out of alchemy grew chemistry, and psychology, and all manner of spiritual exploration, like Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.” He paused before continuing. “It’s almost as if humans created their own magic out of the natural world, rather than finding magic in the form that they so desperately sought in the early years of history. What if the magic that they sought was there all along, and they just had to believe in it for it to be real?”
Suddenly it clicked for Harry. “Of course, I should have recognized them sooner. It’s Seamus and Dean!” He bobbed up on the balls of his feet for a moment, gauging the distance and the obstacles between him and his former Housemates. “It’s going to be tricky to get close enough to them to say hello though. Maybe after we dance for a little we can try.”
“Where is that? Here as in your brother’s home after a shite day, or here as in the fact that you’re now getting just as much media attention as me, if not more?”
“All right, what do you want to know?” He settled into a chair across from the couch where Draco had sprawled himself.
Harry shook his head, still bemused. “You don’t know what you’re missing, mate.”
Draco shrugged and licked his lips again. “I could do with something a bit stronger, honestly, but I don’t think they allow you to drink alcohol here. Maybe a juice?”
Draco’s reaction was to slow down and shift position so that he was able to pleasure himself as he kept working on Harry with his mouth. Harry felt vaguely disappointed and angled his head so he could see what was going on within Draco’s grasp, but soon decided that he needed Draco closer to him, now. “Come here,” he said, propping himself up on his elbows. “This is all so new to me, I want to see everything.”
“Let me get this straight. You’re saying that we were all in a cult and that nothing that happened with Voldemort was our fault?”
Harry laughed. “Since when have you shown any interest in my friends?” He stopped laughing when he saw how serious Draco was. “Sorry, I’m still getting used to the fact that we can tell people now. Within reason.” When Draco’s accusatory stare still didn’t let up, Harry shrugged. “What did you expect me to do, it’s not exactly like you have a history of getting along with my friends. They were all in Gryffindor, for Godric’s sake.”
“It was a gift. Bit silly, but I thought you might appreciate it.” Draco forked up a bite of sausage and munched with relish. “Merlin, I needed that.”
had he been thinking, to invite his former arch-nemesis over to his tiny flat and cook him dinner? He considered calling Draco to cancel the plan, but his Gryffindor pride wouldn’t let him do it. He had to prove to Draco that reconciliation was possible, after all they had been through at Hogwarts and Malfoy Manor.
“Godric, what happened?” Harry started forward. “Hermione, what did you do?”
“Sorry, sorry.” Harry held up both hands in truce. “I’m just a bit out of my depth, that’s all. The last museum I went to was in Dijon, with Hermione, oh, a year ago? And it was nothing like this, just tapestries and stone carvings and an owl that people touched for good luck.”
“That’s it, I swear. He bought me that one drink, and I was silly enough not to refuse, and then I realized that I liked men and that I loved you, before I left.” His eyes were anxious and very green against the aquamarine of the knitted blanket that was pulled up to his chin. “Does that make me strictly one way or another? I don’t know, but it was still a relief to discover that about myself. I was worried that it was only a weird, one-off thing with you.”
Draco’s proximity was doing curious things to Harry’s insides, but the moment passed quickly and they finished up their cups in no time at all.
Draco balked at putting on the jumper, turning up his nose at the loud design. When Harry explained to him that they would be flying in the countryside, he insisted on visiting Harry’s closet and picking out something himself.
Draco sighed. “I really don’t think it would make much difference. So what if she finds out through front page news? There could be opportunities to meet with her later, I just don’t want to have to broach the initial conversation if I don’t have to.”
Luna materialized as if out of nowhere, causing most of the people in the room to jump, with the exception of Feruza, who was still yawning herself awake. “Here, I can help.” She had some dark robes over one arm and a clothes hanger in the other hand, which she brandished like a weapon. Harry was impressed to notice that the new Auror had looked her up and down and assessed the situation within seconds. Her body language showed a relaxed alertness that promised swift action if any threat were to arise.
Draco moved in a little closer. “Yes? And in what ways might that be?”
But Harry wouldn’t take no for an answer. “If you’re so certain about their response, how is it that you were so wrong about me? Surely you couldn’t predict how things turned out between us. Doesn’t it stand to reason then that you can’t predict how your parents will react?”
Draco’s imagination went all sorts of ways, and he suspected Harry’s had too. The reminder that Harry had a life that was very different from Draco’s was a thorn in his side, and he wasn’t sure he had grown enough to accept the sting.
“Here, let me straighten you up a bit.” Harry worked some Poppins-level magic on him (Harry had also been educating him on classic Muggle films), and Draco felt better. “Now hold that happy memory about your father being proud of you, and concentrate on saying the incantation.”
Draco had hoped he wouldn’t bring this topic up again, but there was nothing to be done but tell the truth, as unsavory as it might taste. “Nigel is a bit of an outlier, and we do have a friendship of sorts, but I think he wants to move on and try something different while he takes a break from drinking." He paused and let Harry take that in. "The reason I didn’t answer your question is because I don’t, really. Have friends. Wizarding or otherwise. Just a network of casual acquaintances.”
The skylight closed behind them with final click, and Harry was hit once more by the oddity of the situation. Here he was, with his once sworn enemy, standing on a rooftop in London about to embark upon a tandem flight.
Harry’s heart rate ratcheted up, and he took a deep breath to steady his nerves.
Harry threw him a disappointed stare. “Really? That’s the first thing you have to say to her?” He turned back to Hermione apologetically. “Pay no heed to him, he can get a bit salty in the mornings.”
“What can I say, I’m the gayest gay that ever – “ Draco’s line was interrupted by a knocking at Harry’s door, and he groaned. “Ye gads, Potter. When did your flat turn into bloody Charing Cross Station?”
Ginny and Feruza shared a look that made Draco reconsider his assessment of their relationship. “It went over very well, let’s put it that way.” Ginny had a mischievous twist to her mouth, and Draco decided to let the subject go. “How about you and Harry, how are things?”
and even attempted a few twirls during the final chorus, bumping up against Draco breathless and giggling.
“I guess I mean that I might have had an unhealthy obsession with you while we were in school, and a part of me was wondering if what we have going was just a continuation of that. With sex added in, of course.”
He tried to unleash some of that fury in constructive ways, which made him realize how deeply Harry’s character had started to affect him. The previous version of Draco would have sought refuge in a new boy toy, or masturbated copiously to some of his favorite erotica without a second thought. Instead, he took to rage-cleaning downstairs and upgrading his various collections to keep himself occupied. He even found himself trying out the Patronus charm a few times, with middling success.
“The wedding or Nigel? Bored to the first, intrigued to the last. Nigel’s in a league of his own.” Again he found himself omitting a large part of the truth, which was that Nigel and his family were considered somewhat of an upset within the established Wizarding elite. Born as Wizards, but raised in harmony with Muggles, they had built their fortune upon collaborating with them rather than rejecting them as impure. Now there was a concept he couldn’t have sold to the Dark Lord if he had wanted to. Not for the first time, Draco thanked his lucky stars that the War was over. Even if it meant that he might never see his father again.
“Hermione! No, I don’t want a book! I’ve barely gotten the hang of kissing him, let alone all that other stuff you mentioned.” He was not going to mention their antics from earlier that afternoon, not if his life depended on it.
“Ha, very ha. But yeah, we should meet up again. Soon.”
Harry made a noise of agreement, then felt a mild vibration in his pocket and reached for the coin inside, frowning. He cast a quick Magnifying Charm on it so he could read the new words that had appeared: MR. MALFOY CONSCIOUS, WANTS TO SEE YOU.
When he saw Harry, Draco’s face transformed, blushing ever so slightly pink and looking off to the side almost immediately after they made eye contact. He motioned to the nurse in the room to leave, and asked Harry to close the door behind him, still not looking at him directly. Harry felt out of place, especially after being scrutinized by the many nurses that zipped about the ward.
Besides the money, what was there to fear? He tried to picture his mother standing before him, hearing for the first time that he and Harry were lovers, and he couldn’t envision what her reaction might be. It was entirely possible that he might be overreacting, and as he talked it out with his therapist, he started to wonder if his fear about his mother was really just a manifestation of his own inner demons, rather than an accurate reflection of reality. If so, they held some serious power over him, raising their voices in cacophony until he felt nauseated to the core. Envisioning his father was no better, bringing forth on top of the nausea a feeling of self-disgust and disappointment at his failure to live up to his father’s standards. If he wasn’t able to do right by them even now, then it wasn’t worth showing an ounce of vulnerability to them.
Mysteria raised a glass and gestured for everyone at the table to do the same. “To being alone together!”
She smiled back at him. “I’d like to think I’m not that indispensable. But I really am, aren’t I.”
Draco, to his relief, was still there. So, however, was his mother. Neither of them had seen him yet, and Harry took a moment to steel himself before properly entering. They were in conversation with Auror Hawken, of all people, and Harry hesitated a fraction of a second before catching her attention. “Ah, Mr. Potter.” Her tone was polite and professional. “You’ve heard the news of Draco’s acquittal, I take it.”
“I wouldn’t miss it for the world, Harry.”
Thus decided, the entire Wizengamot rose and departed the chamber, trailed by Draco and his defense. Harry tried to catch his eye as he left, but Draco’s gaze was firmly fixed on the ground before him. Hermione clutched Harry’s arm when he made a movement to run after him. “Harry, don’t. It’s not over yet, and besides, remember what his mother told you?”
Harry should have known he would pick up on it, after kissing him so impulsively. He felt a spiral of shame beginning to unfurl and fought hard not to go under. “Yes, I did have a drink tonight. One beer.”
It was as if a light had gone out behind Harry’s eyes, spreading pallor into his cheeks that was quickly replaced by the warmth of anger. Draco took this as his cue to step away, smarting from the agony of physical separation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione didn’t seem to know whether to laugh or shudder at this bit of information, but Harry carried on with serving breakfast until the three of them were seated in the living room, Hermione with the couch to herself. Draco glowered into his tea while Harry picked up the thread of conversation.
Stretching out one hand with the palm facing Draco, he silently spoke the
Draco’s laugh came out quickly, without humor. “Yeah, you could say that. I imagine it must be what getting branded feels like, or visiting a terrible tattoo artist.” His words rang hollow to him, and he tried to sound more sincere. “I didn’t really care at the time, I thought I was doing my family an honor by joining.”
“Tell me, how is it that you and Malfoy can stand being in the same room for longer than ten minutes, without being drunk or stoned?” Ron seemed genuinely curious, not just being mean, and Draco could appreciate his directness despite the content of the question. “No offense, I just can’t even picture how it might be possible.”
Draco didn’t know what to say to this revelation, but Harry didn’t seem to expect a response. “Besides, Ginny would have never forgiven me if I hadn’t started cooking for her when she first joined the Harpies. They train for hours every day, and trust me, it builds up an appetite.”
,” he jerked out with a groan at the end, tensing up for several seconds before collapsing back onto the bedcovers.
Draco was visited by an odd vision of fish swimming around the chandelier as he practiced in the downstairs hallway. “Erm, not sure how that would work. I haven’t learned any new magic in a while, I’d probably have to dig out my wand.”
Draco just stared at him, and Harry suddenly felt very awkward indeed. Was he comparing him to Nigel in his head, and did he find Harry wanting? Just when he thought he had completely bollixed everything up, Draco smiled in a sultry sort of way and brushed a hand along Harry’s arm to land on his waist. “Feeling a bit nervous about me, are you?”
Draco was not certain whether to be put out or elated when Hermione mentioned casually that Harry had said hello. They usually talked mid-week via Floo, and all had been proceeding as normal when she dropped the Potter bomb in the middle of a perfectly decent conversation about magically assisted blood transfusions. “Oh really?” he had murmured, and then carried on as if he cared more about the topic at hand.
After the Mediwizards had left, he was seriously in need of some sleep. “Hermione, can we have our talk in the morning? I’m knackered,” Harry said with a yawn. When she looked at him with concern and exasperation, he tried to stifle the wave of yawns that threatened to follow. “I will spell you first thing, I promise. You can come over for breakfast. And Draco will be here to look after me before then.” He hadn’t let go of Draco’s hand for the past half hour, and Draco looked at Hermione with the merest hint of smug.
Her words helped to reveal a reservoir of feelings that Harry didn’t know he had. Hate was too strong of a word. It was more like a feeling of guilt that wouldn’t go away, at the way things had gone, and at the way Harry had let himself go. He was better than an awkward boy hiding away in obscurity, offering no benefit to others besides those who fulfilled his most immediate needs. He was better than a peacock wanting to show off to the world what a hero he was, without taking the responsibilities that came with it seriously. He was better than a man who didn’t dare reach out to his lover for fear of how it might look on the surface. He was better than all of that.
This a short one, centered around a conversation between Harry, Hermione, and Draco. Brief profanity and makeup sex. Draco is very emphatic about his gayhood.
That drew a laugh from Harry, and to Draco’s relief, he agreed. “Yes, you’re a right peacock, you are. Is it – “ he seemed to have trouble getting his words out – “are you really that nervous about telling your mother beforehand? I mean, I understand about not wanting to risk losing everything. But what if doing the interview and going to the ball together has the same effect? Wouldn’t that make it all pointless?”
Harry agreed, but only on the condition that he try to learn it without a wand first. “If it turns out to be too challenging, we can try it with your wand. But honestly, I don’t think it will be that hard for you, you’re a much more powerful Wizard than you let on.”
“Expecto Patronum!” The light shot out again, but this time it didn’t vanish as quickly. It lingered for a couple minutes, floating like a mist through the doorway into the hall before fading into nothingness.
turned out to be another long, glorious kiss, and Harry felt every nerve ending come alive in a symphony of sweet desire, sending any form of rational thought scattering to the winds. Draco’s arms were firmly wrapped around him, and he could feel a peak of pressure building between their entangled legs. He suddenly wanted very much to know what it felt like to touch another man at his most sensitive point, and so tentatively trailed along Draco’s backside, squeezing the firm muscle there before circling around to palm the fly of his trousers.
After he reached drinking age, Harry knew it was time to change course when he found himself waking up in unfamiliar locations, sometimes public, sometimes private, in which he was sometimes clothed, sometimes not.  Ginny didn’t know how bad it was at first, but by time she found out, while in the midst of adjusting to her own skyrocketing career, Harry was already planning out his recovery, in the form of deliberate re-immersion into the Muggle world and removal of all substance abuse from his lifestyle. He had found his flat through Muggle means and had all but moved in by time she realized that he was serious about taking a break from his life, and Godric bless her, she was understanding of his decision. His stealth, however, had cost them their relationship. Thank goodness it hadn’t cost their friendship.
Harry sniffed suspiciously at the open bottle Draco handed to him. It smelled like cola with fruit. “What will it do to me?”
“Look, I didn’t ask to be a Death Eater, or to be born into one of the oldest Pureblood lineages. I did choose to take this year of Muggle immersion to make up for some of the damage caused to my family.” He exhaled sharply through his nose. “The least you could do is show me how I can trust you to not go spreading lies about me, or prying into my private business.”
“He’s a new friend I made this past spring. I met him at a wedding.”
Harry was impressed by Mysteria’s composure, as Draco divulged all of this information mere inches from their busy hands. To his surprise, Mysteria responded by suggesting that they arrive just a teensy bit late, so as to make more of a splash. “The Prophet is almost never late, so if people can start reading the interview before you show up on the red carpet, so much the better.”
“I thought the barriers were supposed to prevent Apparition?” Luna’s dreamy voice had climbed to an even higher register than usual, and the expression on her face was fearful. “That does not look like authorized press to me, I think they may be trying to – “
“So yeah, we did become friends. It was my idea at first, because I wanted to make amends. Draco, seemed – different, among Muggles.”
Draco didn’t dare ask any further, with present Muggle company, but he nodded in understanding, briefly overcome by an urge to wrap one arm around Potter in a gesture of solidarity. Perhaps he had had too much to drink. Any whisper of temperance withered away the moment the next round arrived, however.
Harry acquiesced and led her to the bedroom, where he started rummaging through one of his dresser drawers for the map. She insisted that he lie down after removing further layers of clothing and let her do the searching, which she finished promptly by saying “Accio Marauder’s Map.” Harry felt stupid for not remembering the charm, and wondered aloud if it might work for retrieving his ear, but she reminded him that it did not work on people, animals, or body parts. “Let me see if I have anything in my bag that I can brew for the pain while I check the map. Do you have a copy of a map of London lying around, by chance?”
He Disapparated.
“Not if we’re going out.”
“Sure, if you walk with us. We don’t want to linger too long, I think you can see why.” Harry’s gesture toward the crowd was unnecessary, and Draco was amazed to see that he was grinning instead of looking like he was about to vomit, like Draco felt. Was this some depraved Gryffindor reaction, to feel at ease in the most chaotic of situations? Or was it just Harry being Harry Potter, after years of growing accustomed to living in the spotlight despite himself?
He jerked to attention, looking up from the papers strewn upon his desk. Hermione was at the doorway, hand raised as if to knock, with a worried expression on her face. He had been drifting off mentally a lot more since he’d started up his job as an Auror instructor several months ago, and had taken a fair amount of teasing about his absent-minded professor persona. Maybe it was time to visit his therapist again.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I see what you mean. But Hermione, what about me? Isn’t it just as important that the public know my motivations? I’m the one who wanted to make amends initially, so maybe we could start from there and move to Draco's perspective after?”
“Drakes. Are you sure you still want to do this?”
“Thanks Hermione,” Harry was finally able to speak again. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
was the last straw, after imagining what Ron’s response would be, and it left Harry sniggering for several minutes afterward, despite Draco’s repeated shushing. It wasn’t until they got to a quieter gallery with no one around that Draco pulled him aside and hissed, “What’s going on, Harry – you’re acting like a complete idiot. Keep in mind that I have a membership here, and that people might
“That’s all right, thanks Ron.” He gathered up his coat. “I’ll let you know when I’m ready to set up the Portkey.”
“Well, Mysteria, I appreciate your showing me around, but I really don’t know what I’m doing here. I’m not – you know – queer, at least I don’t think I am.”
Forty-five minutes later, impeccably dressed and only slightly late, Draco emerged from the Tube station and began the usual slog to his place of work. It was ironic that of all the places he might have chosen, he ended up a with a bookshop in Soho run by Wizarding folk with aspirations of promoting unity between Muggles and non-Muggles. The terms of the immersion contract were broad enough that he probably could have finessed his way into something more prestigious, like a law firm or a banking establishment. But the thought of working with people – Muggles – who consistently thought they were better than him was too much for him to stomach. Better to stick to a place where he could still maintain a smidgeon of self-respect, with a boss who was a Wizard. An elderly nutter of a Wizard, but still a person of magical means.
Draco, once satisfied with his makeup, agreed to hold off on arriving until after six. “Gives us a little more time to go over what we want to say. Because you know there will be reporters outside the entrance.”
, he thought to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Harry didn't seem to mind. “Do you know, I think this is the first time I’ve really had any physical contact for a while. Not just the sex part - there hasn’t been anyone to touch since my time with Ginny, not really. I didn’t have the heart to go out looking after all the trouble I caused with carrying on the way I did.” He paused, and his voice came back a little rougher around the edges. “I definitely wouldn’t have thought it would be you.”
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry went in for a hug, which she returned warmly. “Sorry about all that, and sorry it took me so long to tell you. He’s not a bad sort, really he isn’t.”
Things only got worse from there, however. By time breakfast was over, Harry had somehow twisted things around enough to convince himself that actually, telling his friends about Draco might not be a bad idea either, in the name of “unity” and “reconciliation.” Draco finally lost his patience and suggested none too gently that Harry fuck off with his lofty ideals.
“They call it retail therapy for a reason,” Draco said aloud, and smiled to himself.
Draco’s eyebrows went up at the last part, and he smirked a little. “Did you say drag queens? Whatever gave you that idea?”
You might be able to tell that I’m not a London-dweller. Please excuse any geographical or historical inaccuracies, and let me know, kindly, how I might improve them.
Draco threw her a withering look. “That was my father, not me. I can still be around Wizarding folk at Wizarding events, I just can’t do anything remotely magical unless I’m at home.”
“I like to come up here often during the summer,” Harry shouted over one shoulder, “but as you can tell, it gets a little chilly at night. Let me know if you get too cold and we can head back to London.”
Draco wanted very much to know what he got up to, particularly if it involved nighttime trysts, but Harry had moved on. “Come on, let’s go flying.”
Harry’s laugh came out in a chuff of air. “Yeah, that’s an understatement. Ticklish, eh?” His fingers flexed for the attack, but Draco beat him to the chase by straddling him and pinning both arms with his legs. Harry felt pleasantly trapped.
“Two Cosmos, coming up!” Nigel bustled off to the kitchen in turn, and Harry was left awkwardly sitting in the room by himself. At least they didn’t seem to be aware of his earlier spying attempt. If he was perfectly honest with himself, he felt a little jealous of the casual camaraderie between the two of them.
Draco shook his head slowly in response, but still didn’t say anything. Harry reached out one hand to cup the side of his face. “Draco? I need a little more communication for this to work.” He stared into Draco’s eyes as if willing him to speak. “I need to know that you’re still on board with not knowing where this is going. And I need to know if there’s anyone else we should be thinking about.”
Draco broke into stifled laughter then, leaning his forehead into the back of Harry’s head as he quaked. Harry really didn’t mind, but he did want to know what had set it off, after Draco had told
Harry couldn’t speak, pulling her into a hug instead. “Thanks for everything, Hermione,” he managed to choke out at last. “You’re one in a million.”
Harry didn’t know what that was, but he didn’t care for Nigel to explain. “Sure.”
“What do you say we get out of here?” Draco finally leaned over and whispered in Harry’s ear.
Stunned, Harry could do nothing but listen as they explained the intricacies of what happened. It seemed that the attacker was once a Ministry employee and had been working an ancient, illegal curse on the grounds surrounding the Ministry buildings, that caused any protection spells cast upon it to disintegrate over a period of time. It wasn’t clear whether he had originally intended to work the curse for Ginny and for that night specifically, but the protective wards had weakened enough that he was able to Apparate himself onto the red carpet and draw his weapon on Ginny. What he hadn’t counted on was Harry being there and removing them both before she could be harmed. Draco’s interaction with him had only slightly delayed his ultimate goal, which was to trigger a built-in Killing Curse once the gun was shot.
Harry cleared his throat cautiously before responding. “Well, I – er, it wasn’t so clear-cut. I had only dated women before, as you know, and I honestly can’t say that there was a moment when I thought ‘Aha, I must be queer.’ It was much more gradual than that.” The look on his face made Draco ache to jump in and rescue him, but he held himself in check. It was important that Harry express himself in this moment, as he had wished.
It happened quite naturally, as Draco stepped down from his seat on the broom, with one arm still wrapped around Harry for balance. A slight turn of the neck, and their faces were in a heart-stopping moment of nearness. Draco resolved the tension with a kiss. A soft kiss, one that demanded nothing of Harry, yet suggested a world of possibility.
Harry closed his eyes and melted into Draco’s kiss. “I really did miss you,” he murmured against his lips, and squeezed Draco’s upper arms, which felt thicker than he remembered. The mental fog from the alcohol and his injury was mostly gone, and had been replaced by a cloud of exhaustion and relief. “I’m sorry I was such a prat about you not wanting to share our secret.” He hissed in pain as his glasses went crooked again, one bow falling free from the bandages on his earless left side. “Damn glasses.”
“Not since the Yule Ball, no. But it doesn’t matter, you don’t have to be great at it to have fun moving to music. Here, let’s look some up on that webby thing you were telling me about.” He grabbed Harry’s hand and marched him back into the living room from the kitchen.
“Sorry if that went on a bit longer than we’d planned. Nigel has very discriminating taste.” Draco looked at Harry with a hint of a twinkle in his eye. “But I think we did good today. The Boy Who Lived should live in style.”
Harry felt that just having Draco near him again was enough, but he felt too shy to say it out loud. He accepted the tisane and reveled once more in the feeling of being comforted, only this time, it was Draco doing the comforting. Draco Malfoy, his former arch-nemesis and once-again lover, taking care of him. There was a riddle to tease the brain.
A million sensations and adjustments later, Harry stood in front of a mirrored wall in Draco’s guest bedroom, perplexed. Who was the stranger staring back at him, dressed in fantastically fitted dark green satin robes, a pair of Burberry horn-rimmed glasses, and with hair that almost seemed under control? He resisted the urge to poke at his face to make sure it was real, and turned toward Draco instead, only to feel his jaw drop.
Harry sighed. He’d forgotten how persistent people who drank could be, but since this was Draco and he wanted to make amends, far be it from him to protest.
I wrote the larger part of this chapter after listening to the Velvet Goldmine soundtrack for the millionth time, and before reading the most excellent Marauders epic All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89, which goes on a much deeper odyssey into the music of the 1970s. If you’re not turned off by slow burn or Wolfstar fanfic, I can’t recommend it enough. Just bring tissues and be prepared to have your heart torn out of your chest more than once. It's probably the longest standalone fic I've ever read, but it's so worth it. (The author also wrote a few fluffier side stories, but I would start with ATYD before branching out).
“Let’s get going to your place first, and we can see how trusty we are when we get there.”
What are you doing here?”
In the ensuing scramble for clothing and dignity, Harry’s ear started bleeding a little, which was why he answered the door holding a wad of gauze to the side of his head.
Thus entreated, Harry stayed, alternately stretched out next to Draco in his narrow bed, and nodding off in the chair when the nurses came in to check on their patient. They chided Harry for breaking the hospital rules at first, but once they realized that Harry’s presence was helping Draco to stay asleep, they left him alone. He watched the sky lighten outside with approaching dawn while he cradled Draco. He didn’t know what the days ahead would bring, but he was determined to be there for Draco, no matter what the cost.
Draco ran his hands up and down Harry’s arms, soothing him with shushing noises. “Harry, Harry – look at me.” He waited until a hint of green peeped through Harry’s fingers. “We did fine, and we’re going to do fine all the way through this weekend. Everyone loves you, they’ll be eating out of your hand before you know it.”
Draco and Nigel exchanged glances, then by some unspoken agreement, Nigel turned back to Harry. “It makes you look like a gigolo on the cover of a trashy romance novel.”
Draco followed him back out into the hallway, weaving a little and sniggering at him. “What are you going to do, go starkers?” Harry had already removed several layers earlier, but he left his pants and a T-shirt on, less out of modesty and more for a need of something to lessen the friction while sliding down said bannister.
The silence stretched on interminably, like stubborn taffy, and Harry found his nerves dangling further into edginess. “Well?” he said at last, twisting the mug between his hands. “Talk to me, Draco.”
“I can hear you, you know,” Harry commented from the floor. “I don’t feel great, but I’m not on the verge of passing out any more. Just a lot of pain.”
They ended the conversation shortly thereafter, with Harry sending his love to Ron as always. “Tell him to spell me, if he ever has a moment. I know he’s been super busy with preparing for the World Cup next summer and all.”
He confessed it hours later in bed, and Harry couldn’t help smiling at him. “You’re forgetting that I have a little more practice in self-sacrificing gestures than you do. I can’t fault you for how you were raised, and I think you’ve already done a great deal toward changing your ways for the better.” His gaze flickered over Draco’s body and landed back on his face, soft and warm. “You showed me a different way of seeing, and now it’s time for me to do the same for you.”
“Right. Luna, I’ve got to go – it looks like Draco has woken up.” He gave her a quick peck on the cheek. “Finish that interview later?”
“Sorry, Hermione, how long have you been standing there?”
The first surprise was that there were no house elves in sight. Hermione had wasted no time in drafting amendments to the laws regarding their treatment when she first started working for the Ministry, and he wondered if her efforts had finally started to bear fruit.
Harry shook his head. Even as a temporary Muggle, Draco could be a real twat.
“Honestly, Harry, can’t you trust me for once?”
This was a really hard chapter to write. I’m not sure how accurate my portrayal of the Wizarding trial process was, but I did my best. Sorry if I crushed any hearts by the end - I promise there will be a bit of a reprieve in the last couple chapters of this story!
Nigel laughed, in a surprisingly wicked low-belly rumble. “Yeah, he likes a little bit of everything. Especially when it helps him to pick up Muggles.”
Harry shook his head and smiled. “Nah, I’m glad you called. These Muggle video games are killing me.” He cringed as soon as he said it, but she was gracious enough to overlook it. Instead, she huffed in only the way that Hermione could.
“You’ll have to be a little more aggressive than that, my friend.”
“A hot mess. With emphasis on hot.”
When he came to the part about shopping, Ginny stopped him. “Wait, wait a minute. He took you to fucking Harrods?” Draco couldn’t fail to notice the envy in her voice, and indulged in a little preening. “Is there no justice in this world? I would have died and gone to heaven if you’d ever taken me there.”
Before Draco could say anything further, Harry heard a knocking at the door. “Hang on, I have to get that. I’ll spell you back, I just have to take care of something first.” He started to get up before remembering the towels wrapped around his skull. He hoped that Draco hadn’t seen the blood soaking through one side, but it was too late to find out now, as he had already ended the spell with “Capitellum Kaput.”
“What’s going on Hermione, is it anything Harry and I should know about?”
Daylight arrived, and Harry slept the sleep of the dead until close to ten-thirty. He forced himself into the shower and emerged squeaky clean and partly satiated after a second wank. As was his usual wont since Draco had re-entered his life, he spent far too much time trying to arrange his hair just right, before giving up and spelling him at the stroke of eleven by the church bell down the street.
If Auror Hawken was surprised to hear Draco’s name mentioned, she didn’t show it. Hermione cast one more anxious look over the three of them before turning to Harry. “Yes, I think we are. Auror Hawken will get them both to a safe house, and I can help you with getting out of here undetected.” Her eyes swept over him in turn. “I think we’d better start by Transfiguring your outfit too, it’s not exactly subtle.”
He grinned lopsidedly. “Guilty as charged. I have color-coded reminders and everything. I just haven’t been reminded of this meeting yet. When is it again?”
Ron raised his eyebrows. “Have to say, Hermes, not setting the bar very high there.”
Harry’s eyes went round with astonishment. “You’ve never used one? But what about – blimey, how do you not have a computer? Shouldn’t that be, like, top priority in Muggle Studies?”
“Hello, hello.” Nigel’s eye swept Harry from head to toe, then back up again to scrutinize the fit of his shirt in a professional manner. Or at least, Harry hoped it was professional, and not just gratuitous gawking.
He at least had the grace to look sorry for his rudeness. “Erm, well, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but I’ve decided to take a break from Wizarding. For the most part. Which is why I’m surprised to find a Quidditch display in the middle of a Muggle neighborhood.”
“All right Harry, you’ve put up with our drinking long enough.” Ginny turned a mischievous eye upon him as he sat in a chair nursing the unpronounceable soda from South America. “What does everyone think, should we try the Z?”
She shot him a surprised look. “Of course.” She leaned in a little closer to tell him, “You know, if being at home alone is a bit much right now, you’re welcome to stay with Ron and me.”
, lying there. He didn’t want to let go of his hand, but the Mediwizard took it from him to feel Draco’s pulse, simultaneously casting a charm to stem the blood loss. Harry found himself clutching his elbows instead, trembling as he watched the scene unfold before him.
“Harry…” Hermione’s tone was hesitant, as they stood before the side entrance to St. Mungo’s. “They haven’t identified the person with the cursed gun yet, but regardless of who he was or how he acquired it, there are consequences for killing someone like that. Especially if the Killing Curse was used, as Draco appears to have done.” Her eyes in the dark were earnest.
Harry and Draco just can’t seem to agree. More conflict, profanity, and mild violence, and not just from Harry’s gaming.
She laughed a little. “Right. No Draco. Sorry, I think I’m just a little
“Don’t rub it in, Hermione.” The pain was making Harry feel terse, and his words came out more sharply than he intended. “Sorry, I’m just having a hard time focusing on anything but how to find my damn ear.”
Draco turned back to buttering his toast with a quirked eyebrow. He wasn’t sure if he was more insulted or amused by Harry’s cover-up story, but ultimately, it didn’t matter. As long as Harry’s Wizarding friends, who were mostly Draco’s enemies, didn’t know what they were up to, it was fine by him.
“Fuck that to hell and back,” was Draco’s reply, when Harry brought it up.
As he went about the business of preparing for bed, Harry’s thoughts turned again and again towards the vision of Draco sprawled on his own bed, being devoured by someone else. Harry realized with deepening bewilderment that he didn’t just want to kiss Draco and see where it went. He longed to be Draco’s counterpart, to explore and to understand the secrets of his body and his mind, and the desire they called forth. Where had
She gave a final acknowledging nod to Draco, and vanished into the door as she Apparated home. At long last, they were alone.
“How do you want to do this? You in front, me behind? Or vice versa?”
Harry nodded, holding a spatula in one hand while something sizzled in the background. “What about your family, how are they taking your magical hiatus?”
“Sorry, I honestly didn’t think of it until now. I mostly use it for post or when I need to sign up for something, like at the arcades. It was the best way I could think of shaking off the press when I decided to go Muggle.”
Harry recognized the posturing as nerves and took Draco’s hand in his. “Yeah, well, it’s just my stupid way of showing that I care about you. Enough to call this whole thing off if you’d rather not go through with it.”
Thinking about it made his head hurt, so Harry put those thoughts aside and closed the wardrobe. “Let’s not do this right now, I’m sorry I brought it up.”
Draco watched him bite his lip after the question as if in regret and almost couldn’t stand it, how cute Harry looked.
Harry imitated Draco’s movements, and once clothed, began to carry the chairs back toward the table. It was a miracle that the tea mugs were still in one piece. Harry brewed a fresh batch of tea for them both before he said anything.
Draco didn’t say anything, just looked at Harry for a few minutes. The expression in his eyes was unfathomable, and Harry began to wonder if something was wrong. His fears were allayed when Draco’s face lifted into a smirk, and he bent down to kiss Harry. Harry could taste himself on Draco’s lips, with just a hint of salt and musk. Remembering where Draco’s mouth had been moments before brought a fire back to his lower belly, and he shivered at the thought of going at it again. But first, he wanted to talk.
“Hiya Malfoy. Harry told me you were working here again.” Ginny’s tone was cordial, even while she insisted on using Draco’s surname. “This is Feruza, by the way. Feruza Gallagher. She’s a Beater on the team.”
Belatedly, he remembered that Draco preferred shoes off, and removed them in a panic as he scurried past the shoe rack into the den. He had barely enough time to arrange himself on the couch when Draco appeared at the bottom of the stairs, still slightly rumpled but at least dressed. Nigel was not far behind him.
First description of sexual activity between characters (nothing terribly graphic, that will come later). Harry has a moment of voyeuristic weakness and a mild case of jealousy mixed with FOMO. He also makes a terrible dad joke. You have been warned.
Harry didn’t ask for details, but his ears were a little pinker than usual when he took his first sip of the Cosmo Nigel offered to him. It flooded his mouth in a burst of sweetness and cranberry-citrus flavor. “That’s pretty good, thanks.”
“Did you find something?”
“Tell me so I believe you.”
“Why don’t we all go to Harrods together?” he suggested. “We haven’t been in a while, and I have connections.”
Nothing happened, and Harry advised him to be less angry about it. “You’re not trying to be forceful, just maintain focus and be in touch with yourself. Feel your inner confidence.”
Harry blushed deeply at the mention of his one publicity indiscretion during his days as a playboy of sorts, if by “playboy” you meant someone who stood about awkwardly at parties until he’d had at least three drinks in him and five hints heavily dropped on his head. “I just meant, what about you and your precious reputation? I thought you cared more about keeping the string of one-night stands going than about just spending time with someone like me.”
Pansy was sitting up in bed holding Vi. There was an empty bassinet set next to the window. Pansy looked up and gave Harry a sad smile. “I know she’d probably sleep better in her bed, but I want to spend as much time with her as I can before…”
Harry frowned slightly and nodded. “You’re right. It’s just right now…”
Upstairs, Draco reached his room and slammed the door shut behind him. He locked the door and then add a few spells for good measure. Draco moved to the center of the room and just stood there for a minute, trying to wrap his brain around what had just happened.
**************************************
“Yes?” Petunia Dursley said as she opened the door.
Malfoy had his wand out and he asked coldly, “What the hell have you done to Pansy, Potter?!”
Both Slytherins were sitting with their backs up against the headboard, but where Pansy had her legs stretched out under the blankets Draco was sitting on top of the blankets with his legs crossed.
Pansy blushed. Draco looked away. Ron’s and Hermione’s jaws dropped open.
