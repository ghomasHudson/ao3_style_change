Crawling into his four-poster, he took of his glasses and laid his head on the pillow.  He was sound asleep within moments.
He could still see Draco laying on the front stoop of Grimmauld, blood gushing from the wounds on his chest, just like when Harry had slashed him with the Sectumsempra curse.  As Harry stood over his body, Draco was trying to speak, coughing on the blood that was bubbling from his mouth.  Harry leant over him, trying to pick him up to take him to the hospital wing.  When he had Draco in his arms, he could hear Draco whispering the words, “I thought you loved me…  I thought you loved me…”
Harry looked up and saw Andromeda at the top of the stairs.  He felt Teddy stiffen in his arms.  “Tough luck, mate.  You got the full name.”  He let Teddy slide from his arms to the floor, where he turned to face his grandmother, black, messy head, which resembled his godfather’s, turning down.
Seeing the sorrow in the man’s face, Harry started walking again, looking over at Draco.  “Tonks was brilliant.  Clumsy as all, but brilliant.  She was a metamorphmagus, so she could change her appearance into whatever she wanted.  She could come up with the best disguises.  That helped her when she became an Auror.  She married Remus Lupin, and they had a son, Teddy.  He is also a metamorphmagus, and equally as brilliant as his parents.”
“Shhh!  I’ve got you.  I know what you need.  I’ve got you.”
“I have just a couple more things to pick up, but other than that, yeah.”
Kreacher handed Harry a plate of food, and so he carefully placed his cloak on the table, sitting down to eat.  They chatted a bit while finishing their food, and then Hermione told them it was time to go.
“I can’t wait to get my letter!  Will you take me to Diagon Alley to get all of my things?”
“Okay, you lift that side, and I’ll get this one,” he heard Ron say.
Draco looked down at the table as he whispered, “I deserved much more than that.”
to do is know that it is over, and that you only have to worry about yourself for now.  However, a lot has happened already.  Kingsley has been named Interim Minister of Magic.  Aurors have been crawling the castle since just after you fell asleep, trying to gather all of the--,” he hesitated briefly.  “The dead, and has started locating their next of kin.”
Harry smiled slightly, but also looked pained.
“Oh, har har, Malfoy. Whether you want to believe it or not, I hate the attention.  It is so disconcerting.”
Draco looked up at Harry, small smile on his face. “I can’t believe this.” He looked back down at the photo again, watching the scene over and over again. “Did you—“
“But what if it’s not right?  What if she doesn’t like it?  What if—”
After only three days, Harry was getting used to living with the Slytherins.  For the most part, they were just keeping to themselves.  He had found out fast that they were both very neat.  Everything had a place, and there was a place for everything.  Harry almost felt sorry for them having to share a space with him and Ron.  Their dorm up in Gryffindor, while not exactly a sty, was far from spotless.
He turned back to Blaise and Pansy and said, “And I give you two permission to do the same to me.”
“You mean right now?”
Draco panted below him.  He had his eyes closed tight, but opened them when Harry spoke.  “I’m so close,” he whined, staring right into Harry’s emerald eyes.  Harry stared right back, keeping up the tempo, and then bent down to kiss Draco.
They were both quiet for long moments, just loud panting and small moans coming from them.  It didn’t take too long until Harry was back to short, fast strokes, hitting Draco’s sweet spot.  Draco whined again, hand sneaking in between them to try and grip his cock, but Harry just batted it away.
“Uncle Harry!”  He leapt into Harry’s arms, who picked him up and carried him down to the kitchen, where Draco was making dinner.
“Sod off.”
He gripped Harry’s hand, swinging it back and forth.  This was exactly what they needed: just to be with each other.
“Brilliant.”
“Uncle Harry!  Uncle Draco!”  Teddy yelled as he slammed into Harry, hugging him tight.
Draco closed his eyes as Harry kept raking through his hair.  “You can tell me, you know.”
“Well, lucky me.”  Draco started lightly massaging Harry’s socked feet.  “Don’t let me disturb your progress, though.  Let me see a teapot.”
“What are you making?  It smells super yummy!”
“You’re welcome.  You really like them?”
Narcissa and Andromeda took Teddy back to the Manor, and Ron and Hermione took their kids back home.  Harry had picked up their things that were downstairs, while Draco went and grabbed their bags out of the room.
He looked across the room to the tempus charm he had cast earlier.
“I hate you,” Harry said, as he glanced at Draco and then their friends.  “I hate you all.”
Looking at the three colours of grey on the card, Draco pointed to the colour that was in the middle.  “If you go with this one, you can still get by with a bit darker furniture, and still not have it too dark in here.”  Looking around at the room, again, he continued.  “Yes, definitely go with that colour, and don’t forget to get a clean white for the ceiling and the molding and base boards.”
Draco turned around in Harry’s arms.  “Oh, I have some ideas.”
Draco, who had been taking another drink of the coffee, chocked a bit at what she said.  He coughed once, blushing as he said, “Yes, I do.”
“You can’t make promises you can’t keep,” Draco mumbled against the pillow, as he tried to blink back the tears.
Mr Stotts gestured for McGonagall and Harry to join Narcissa, and Harry reluctantly let go of Draco’s hand and went to sit down.
“Thank you.  It’s taken a lot of work, but I am enjoying it.  And, thank you for allowing me to host.  After everything you lot have done for me, this is the least I could do,” Harry said with a smile.
Ollivander stared at Harry a moment, and then stood and started pacing around his small office.
“Why—how—you chose Hogwarts?”
“It’s nothing, really.  I just…got in an argument, and didn’t want to go back to the Manor.  Grimmauld was the first place I thought of.  Without thinking, I just climbed in here.  Sorry.”
“Do I need to cast an
“Hermione, Ron, and I were at Grimmauld.  I’ve been doing some renovating, and I was showing them what I had gotten done, when suddenly, the side of my leg became extremely hot, and a bright light emited from my pocket, where my wand was.  Almost immediately after the pain stopped, the doorbell rang, and when I got to the door, Draco was laying in a bloody heap on the stoop.”
Harry agreed to think about it, and began walking around, chatting with his guests.
“When you, Granger, and Weasley showed up at the Manor in April, I couldn’t believe that you were stupid enough to get caught.  I wanted you to win.  Hell, I was counting on you to win.  Even if that meant that I spent the rest of my days in Azkaban, at least the Dark Lord would no longer be.  That is why I didn’t tell my aunt that it was you.
Harry looked at Draco.  While his tone was his usual snarkiness, his face showed a smile.  Harry smiled back saying, “Well, if you were to get a little bit of sun on that pale skin, you might be able to be seen.  Seriously, Malfoy, you look like a ghost!”
“Thank you, I appreciate your sympathy.  But, what I was going to say was that now that we are engaged, you get to plan a wedding!”
“Hi.”
Narcissa smiled as she looked at the two young men.
“Well, Mr Malfoy.  Glad to see you’re awake.  You gave us quite the scare, you know.  Here, drink this Skele-Gro.
“Fuck.”
“You did great! It’s brilliant, and so much more logical to have two openings into the dining room! AND! You got rid of that annoying portrait! Thank you,” he added, leaning over and kissing Draco.
“I told you.  Magic.”  He smiled up at Draco, who just shook his head at his boyfriend.  He joined Harry in looking down on the sleeping Teddy.
“I don’t know.”  They both turned as they heard the shower turn off.  “Guess I’d better go.  We’ll see you later.  Wish him luck for me, will ya?”
“Kreacher, would you please get us some breakfast?  Eggs, toast, and coffee would be great.”
“Are we sure we want to go home,” Harry asked with a smile, looking around the room.  “Can’t we just stay here for the rest of December?”
They stepped out onto the front step, Draco locking the door, and then Harry gripped both of their hands in his as he twisted them away in apparation, landing nearly in the same spot that he and Draco had on their date night a few nights before.
“Yeah, ‘course.  It’s the least I can do after all your help today.  So?  What do you say?”
“Harry!” Molly screamed as she threw the towel that was in her hand down onto the table and launched herself into his waiting arms.  “You’re home!”
They had had one of the best conversations that Harry had ever had.  They talked about anything and everything.  It wasn’t until Tom came over that they realised they had been talking for nearly three hours.  Draco had immediately stiffened and with a speedy goodbye, had immediately disapparated.
“How about… ‘He’s back! Harry is back after months away, and that means it’s time to celebrate!  When: Saturday, November 27
Harry looked around the circle, eyes landing on Hermione’s.  She gave him a small smile.  Harry turned to listen to Ginny.
Feeing the need to tell him he was home, he forced himself to get up and got downstairs.  He stepped into the kitchen and saw Harry standing in front of the hob, dressed in joggers, a tee shirt, and Christmas socks.
“Draco…” Harry murmurs, voice worshipful even as his eyes linger on the canvas. “This is absolutely incredible.”
He figures it out at lunch. If his friends are to blame for this entire situation, why was a trap set for Draco? It doesn’t make sense to put him in danger if there aren’t any malicious intentions behind the circumstances.
“How did you know I heard something else?” Harry demands with a soft chuckle.
Draco just nods again. He was preparing to spend £300 on her, so it’s just in budget. He may not be as rich as he once was, but he’s been saving all year to buy her—and the rest of his friends—something special.
He’s sweaty already, face red and breathing heavily. When I lift an eyebrow, he nods to the stacks of random objects and crates. Portkeys. I smile at him, a soft, private smile to tell him I’m grateful.
Draco realises what it was about the colours while he’s fiddling with the dyed cotton at lunch.
Harry knows that his childhood was shitty. He knows that he was abused, that being locked in a cupboard is neither normal nor acceptable. He knows that being forced to cook lavish meals at the age of six, but only receiving bread and water in return, was cruel. He knows this, but he still thinks Draco’s upbringing was worse.
“Do you want breakfast?” Draco asks, rolling over so his head nestles under Harry’s jaw.
“See? Beautiful.”
“Now open yours.” Harry nods to the parcel of red paper in front of Draco, his eyes bright.
“As you can clearly see, the number of pupils in Eighth Grade are rather diminished. This is mainly caused by the war, and parents fearing for their children’s safety. I assure you that there are charms threaded throughout the entire castle, ensuring that you are safer than ever before,” the Headmistress drones on. I’m not interested in the slightest about this, and stop listening for a second. I scan over the heads of my peers and note who’s here and who isn’t. Most of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor are the same, with about a third of Hufflepuff missing.
Harry’s hand seeks out his own, holding onto it tightly as he continues taking the painting in.
Sighing, but knowing that it can’t be helped, Draco steps into the shower. As hot water moves over his body in sheets of steam, he tries to wash away the traces of Potter. The hickeys stay stubbornly nestled on his neck — not that Draco had thought that it would work, but there was no harm in trying — but his hair flattens and allows itself to be washed. Draco rubs his fragrant lotions over his skin, running his hands carefully over his entire body. Wincing, he pulls his hand away from a particularly painful bruise on his shoulder. Damn Potter and his persistent marks.
“It’s Saturday, and if you weren’t here you’d be sleeping in.”
“So we don’t have to stop?” He double checks.
That single word pulls a grin from Malfoy, and Harry finds himself returning it full force.
“This is ridiculous.” He gives up, chuckles humorlessly, and unfurls himself from the ball.
“And you haven’t really been much upset about any of them ending, yes?”
. No. Harry should get ready for the day and continue on as if nothing has happened. Who knows, Malfoy might even have found someone else to stay with until they manage to get back to London. Hell, Malfoy might be back in London already! Growling to himself, Harry gathers some clothes and storms into the shower.
“Anyway boys, I can’t do anything to help except give you some pain potions.”
I sweep my eyes over the ground below, and marvel at the scene stretched before me. The view from Skiddaw mountain is astonishing. I feel tiny in comparison to everything else I can see. I feel like I’m insignificant. A welcome emotion for me recently. The sky above me is dull and cloudy, but there is no rain falling today. It’s Monday, and I
*~*~*~
“We never had lunch. Hurry up, we need to move this back.” Draco’s own stomach gives a gurgle of hunger and he slaps a hand over it.
Harry nods, swallowing back the rest of his apologies. Now is not the time.
His hand slides slowly down his shaft, trapped by his underwear. He’s not going to last long, and he doesn’t see the point in even pretending otherwise. He can hear his pulse in his ears, still racing from walking in on Malfoy. Harry imagines sitting between the blond’s legs, kissing up the insides of his thighs and making him writhe in pleasure. He sighs and moves faster, tightening his grip. He twists his hand at the head of his cock, his hips thrusting up against the pressure.
Potter rocks back on his heels after a moment longer and walks back to the sofa. He catches Draco watching him and his eyes burn with something Draco can’t place. Draco looks away, eyes glancing at the fire cautiously.
Tears threaten to fall from my eyes, and I rapidly blink them away. Mother has never said that before. “Th- Thank you,” I stutter out.
“Hmmm,” Harry says, even though he already knows what he wants. “Maybe one of your marvellous hot chocolates?”
“Me too,” Harry says, teeth grazing his throat.
Without asking, he shuffled closer to his boyfriend and squirted some lotion out onto his palm. He drew a stripe down Draco’s back, who lifted his head indignantly. His eyes found Harry’s, but Harry just grinned at him. Draco lowered his head back to his arms, and closed his eyes again. Harry rubbed the stripe of sun lotion into Draco’s back, massaging his skin with the white cream. He spread the line out and made it wider, before adding another two on either side.
Draco’s mind is whirring. He can’t help thinking about the inevitability of the morning. He needs to talk to Harry.
what Malfoy would do… No, too petty. So, even though he doesn’t know why he’s doing it, he turns and leaves the bathroom.
Draco had always been suspicious of Harry’s mental health. After putting himself on the line for so many years, and then
“Here you are,” Potter says as he opens the door a moment later. He approaches Draco in the bed, mouth open and ready to speak. Then he pauses, closes his mouth, opens it again. “You’re very pale.”
Draco sighs and finishes cleaning off his plate and mug of coffee in the sink. “Around ten I think.”
been thinking about, has been pushing it aside like so many other things. “I was terrified you thought I was broken, that I would never deserve it. I was afraid you’d still judge me on who I used to be, and not who I’ve become.”
Harry tugs him into the little bakery, and as the bell on the door chimes, Draco is enveloped in the smell of baking bread. He sighs and relaxes, his body losing its tension at the sight of rising dough under warm lights. There’s gingerbread men and tiny Christmas cakes in the display counter, and Draco catches Harry looking at them with something like envy. Why he’d be envious of something not even alive is beyond Draco, but he doesn’t comment.
Draco pulls his wand out of his pocket, raising it straight up at the sky. He murmurs an incantation and a stream of silver flows out the end. It’s the colour of a Patronus charm, and for a second Harry thinks that that’s what it is. But then it darkens, becoming a deep grey, and fires off. It travels around the perimeter of the plaza, following the pavers and looping around the corners. It’s precise, and it rockets back into Draco’s wand barely two seconds later. Draco, to his credit, doesn’t sway at all.
Harry nods.
“I don’t know,” I sigh. “I haven’t put much thought into it.” Harry nods, understanding perfectly. “I guess he could still be in the Manor, though that would be stupid even for him.”
Harry just nods. He probably doesn’t understand a word Draco is saying. Draco doesn’t blame him, it’s not exactly the most interesting subject to study, no matter what his father said.
Malfoy looks like he’s about to argue, so Harry grabs his hand and hauls him along, walking towards the village. Malfoy doesn’t pull away this time.
“Mr. Malfoy, I do believe I asked you a question?”
is irrelevant.
Harry shakes his head. “I hadn’t thought of anything.”
“Well that’s, useful? I think?”
“We aren’t dating…?” I feel dizzy, like my world is spinning.
“Take what?” Harry asks, concern shifting over his features. “Did I do something wrong?”
He sighs, “Just, please be more cautious Malfoy.”
Draco nods, squeezing his hand, and throws open the doors to the Vanishing Cabinet. It looks perfectly normal, but Draco stiffens. He raises his other hand and points at a string of magic falling from the top, just before it dissipates into nothing. Harry panics for a second, thinking it hasn’t worked, but Draco is already pushing their bags into it. He shrinks them further, making them minuscule and much easier to carry—and why hadn’t they done that in the first place?!—before tugging on Harry’s arm.
“Yep.” Draco berates himself for using such a common word. Potter is already influencing him, and it’s only been a very short while. Except, Draco doesn’t remember Potter using that word today… Damn it.
“Want to tell me?”
“Ok then. But why not orange, apart from that?”
“Why?”
“I did,” Harry responds carefully.
“Give that back you bitch!” Malfoy demands.
“Well, I guess I’d better get yours too then, hey?” Draco replies, rolling off the bed.
[Buche de Noel (or Yule Log) dessert on a white platter]
“No…”
“But you’d rather be with Ron,” Harry finishes for her. Even though the words ‘since you might only have two days left’ aren’t said out loud, they linger in the air, heavy.
“Yep,” Draco admits, taking a sip of his wine.
Not the spell, that is. Rather, the fact that the curse
Draco laughs with him, following his lead as he walks them down the path. He’s unsure as they turn to separate, not knowing if he should buy Harry something. He
“So, when would I start?”
“Of course he is silly! It’s his flat! Now, let me through.” Andromeda tuts at him to hurry up, and Draco rushes to his feet. He still doesn’t have much powder left in the bowl, but he manages to scrape up enough for her to come though.
“Come on,” Harry says. “Let’s join the others.”
The waitress nods. “And for you?” She asks, turning to Draco.
Only a day late! Got caught up with uni haha. Hope you enjoy Xx
He pushes the thoughts away. He doesn’t need to rant to himself when there’s nothing he can do to change it. No, all he needs to do is pick out some pretty and perfumed items for Pansy.
“Great,” I mutter as I stifle a yawn.
Draco squirms, lazily opening one eye to look at him. “Harry.”
I roll my eyes at the name. “At least call me
Malfoy busies himself preparing their dinner, and Harry stands there awkwardly, moving whenever he realises he’s in the way. Eventually, he decides to pour them both a glass of wine and takes them over to the dining table. He doesn’t think they’ve ever actually eaten at it, depressingly pushed against the wall as it is. Regardless, he sets the table and returns to help Malfoy plate the food. He sends them floating carefully to the table, and Malfoy walks slowly over to it. He looks uncertain for a moment, before sitting down. Harry breathes in relief, not knowing why he was so wound up over it. He’s glad Malfoy didn’t say anything.
“How come I haven’t met them? I’ve worked with
Draco snarls. “Of course I’m gay! Have you been living under a rock or something?!”
“Good morning.”
Not going to lie, I totally forgot I needed to post this... I’m amazed it took this long to happen, and I was so close to the end, but oh well. Enjoy the chapter (even if it’s nearly 7 hours late)! Xx
he doesn’t quite think they’re a good choice. If Harry wanted a quill, he’d just use one. Draco spots a couple with real gold-leaf covering them, wrapping around in beautiful patterns. They’re gorgeous, but probably too fancy for Harry. He sighs. This is going to take forever. He’s overthinking, allowing his mind to take control everything. He needs to feel the pens out, use his heart and not his eyes.
Harry springs to his feet, overcome with the need to get to Malfoy, to support him and make sure he knows he’s okay. The blankets fall off his shoulders as he races for the other man, and he doesn’t hesitate before wrapping his arms around him. Malfoy groans and struggles, trying to push Harry away, but Harry’s grip is too strong. If Malfoy were to actually try, instead of barely exerting any pressure, he'd be able to get away fairly easily. Harry knows he’s in a bad state.
He shakes his head to get his fringe out of his eyes. It’s really annoying when his hair gets trapped between his face and his glasses, and Harry huffs as it falls back down in his eyes. He should have listened to Hermione and had it cut. Putting aside thoughts of his hair, he makes his way through the village. Even if Malfoy didn’t spend the night here, he might have visited at one point. If he even found it. It’s entirely possible that he went a different way and never crossed its path. Harry certainly never spoke of it when he first found it. Perhaps, in hindsight, he should have.
The light is weak, the sun only just beginning to rise. It hits Harry’s back, slowly warming him up in gold light. It also reaches Draco’s face, turning his skin slightly yellow and making his hair
He looks up at him through his eyelashes, finding Draco’s cheeks pink. His silver eyes are taken over by black, and they widen as Harry gazes at him.
Draco cries out as Harry’s tongue touches him, and it encourages Harry more than his
“Are you after more of your
“I guess so,” Potter says, “but I think there’s too many things pointing towards them for it to be a coincidence.”
It’s been four days since we arrived at the castle, and we are about to head off to our first classes for the semester. At least, that’s what we were supposed to be doing. Instead, McGonagall calls all of the school into the Dining Hall. We walk in and settle at our respective tables. She stands up at the front, and starts speaking.
“Potter,” Draco states. Without sparing the man another thought, he turns and makes for the Floos again. Potter looks like he is about to break the silence and say something, and the image runs around Draco’s mind as the green flames run around his body.
“It’s worse than here.”
“Maybe the day after.”
The man looks down at the jewellery, then back up to Draco. “Does she look like you?”
it needs to be at least somewhat pretty. Hell, he’ll take
It’s only as Harry takes another swallow of his soup that he realises he’s no longer bone-shakingly cold. He moans around his mouthful, exceedingly glad his idea worked.
“Positive,” Hermione assures him, pushing a strand of hair off her forehead. “The spell I’m going to cast on both of you will allow Draco to hear what you hear. He will still hear what’s happening around him, if faintly, but your’s won’t be compromised.
“Never been better,” Draco jokes. Even though that clearly isn’t true, Harry helps him stand. If he’s well enough to joke he’s well enough to stand, in Harry’s opinion.
*~*~*~
I feel a warm blush creep up my neck. “I’m good, Mother,” I say, as I pointedly ignore Harry’s creeping hand roaming around my belt. “I have quite a lot to tell you though…”
“I thought you wanted to come here?” He sounds puzzled.
Harry chuckles. “I might have to fix that.”
“…coming along nicely…shouldn’t have long now…it will work out…if not we’ll intervene…”
Draco shivers, but slaps Harry’s hand away. “All
?” I grumble as I stretch.
“Look, Malfoy,” Potter is saying now, in a tone that makes him think he’s about to say something important.
It’s… familiar. Draco pauses. How does he know his name?
Malfoy visibly swallows, pushing words down his throat. Harry does the same, unable to say anything in the silence around them. The walls push ever so slightly in once again, and Malfoy is forced against Harry. Their chests come into contact, and Harry’s heart skips a beat. The coil of warmth that had settled leaps again, up into his chest. Malfoy is now ridiculously close; closer than Harry has ever been to him. Malfoy tilts his head, looking right into Harry’s eyes. Harry’s palms are sweating slightly, warmed in the confined space.
“Thank you,” he says, voice reverent as he wraps it around his neck. It’s not a Weasley jumper, but it’s
“Tell me exactly when it started this time.” Granger cuts to the chase immediately. There is no other reason we would Floo her at this hour.
“It’s a special bookstore,” he shrugs. I hold my laugh in, choosing to hide from his gorgeously green eyes. He hasn’t wrapped himself in Glamours like I have. Instead of the cropped sandy-brown I’ve become used to seeing in public, his black hair is hanging loose around his ears. It looks good on him.
“Keep going,” Draco says, breathing heavily.
Draco breathes out a long breath. “It’s complicated.”
“He must have been torturing her while we were at Malfoy Manor…”
Harry gapes. “You wanted us to
,” Potter turns to him. “The one with the house that’s threatening to explode and make it rain cursed gold?” He fixes Draco with a look that clearly says that he thinks Draco has a shit memory, but his eyes are sending a deeper message. One that Draco pointedly ignores.
, and then he has to explain that bisexuality isn’t automatically exclusive of nonbinary people; even though in some cases it is. It must be exhausting for him, but by the happy smile on his face as he leans in to kiss Alex, he wouldn’t change it for the world.
Harry groans but flips their position so he’s on top of Draco. He lines their hips up and grinds down on him, mouth dropping open as he feels Draco’s cock hard against his.
“Potter?”
The gathering at the Weasleys’ is a much more relaxed affair. Harry had persuaded him into jeans and a t-shirt—the pink one, which Harry apparently likes quite a bit—and had told him in no uncertain terms not to bother with a bottle of wine. Draco feels out of his depth approaching the Burrow, unsure of his welcome. What if they hate him? They probably
As I walk back to the patio to refill my tray a few minutes later, Ron approaches me.
He watches as the mistletoe keeps growing, protruding from the ceiling with a red ribbon tied around it.
Draco hums, shrugs, and takes a mouthful. “When you’re as addicted to coffee as I am, you learn how to make it pretty.”
“Actually…” I start telling her about Potter and I’s assignment, and how we’re struggling to find the information. She listens, lost in thought, before giving me her answer.
Draco’s hands are moving quickly, bringing mugs out of the cabinet and the ingredients from around the kitchen with a flick of his wand. Thankfully, the mugs are totally normal—not the hideous mugs they’d found… a week ago? Has it really been a week?
What’s bothering him now though is an insistent tapping. Draco groans and lifts his head from his book. He looks around, his eyes falling on the front door. Potter must be back. Carefully setting aside his mug and book, Draco stands from the sofa and wanders over to the door. He is immediately pushed aside by Potter, who practically
“First of all, don’t laugh about panic attacks. Second, yes. I think so.”
Zabini blanches. “I’m so sorry Draco, that wasn’t the intention at all.”
Working feeling into his arms as he goes, he makes his way down the corridor and towards the bathroom. Harry nearly always showers in the morning, and he doesn’t see why he shouldn’t today. Even if Draco Malfoy is in the room next to it. God, but this is a strange situation. He opens the door and takes a moment to marvel at the bathroom. Despite having used it yesterday, it looks just as stunning today. The blue tiles bounce light around the room, and it looks majestic. Not that he has strong thoughts on interior design. Much. Okay, maybe he does, but he’ll never admit it out loud. Ron would have his neck for liking something like that. It would remind him too much of Hermione, who is determined to refurbish their little house.
Harry pauses. “Are you actually offering?”
of you, Draco,” she says. “Proud of the fact that you managed to Rise, proud that you’ve finally found someone who makes you happy, and proud that you are helping the right side of the war win. You will single-handedly turn your fate away from the path your father and I put you on.”
is very annoying.
It’s been a week now, and I’ve heard nothing from him. I
Draco would think like this. “You are
Potter responds instantly, moving his lips in a delirious rhythm that makes Draco mad with want. There is no space between them as their bodies collide, forcing him even harder against the wall. There is no question about who is playing dominant tonight. Draco focuses entirely on the kiss, trying not to lose himself to it. It’s heady, hot and strong in a way that most people’s mouths aren’t. Potter is solid where he is pressed against him, making Draco remember his quidditch skills. Pulling his wandering brain back to the present, he tries to memorise everything.
“Are you going somewhere?” He asks, shifting so his hip is resting against the counter.
Draco looks back up to find Harry leaning close to him again and a smile on his face.
“Yes.”
to a small grocer, preferring to shop at a massive general store like Tesco. He knows that’s not a thing to be proud of and that produce is nearly always better from a local grower, but it’s much more convenient in a big chain. It does have the effect of triggering his claustrophobia sometimes, but when it’s too busy he goes home and doesn’t worry about his shopping.
“And it’s supposed to look like deer fucking?”
He doesn’t touch it, just swirling it through the hair and occasionally blowing over it. Harry feels his nipple tighten impossibly, and he tries to push Draco onto it. Draco chuckles at him, refusing to give in. He trails a finger around it too now, rough callouses catching on his sensitive skin.
Harry exhales in relief and hurries to remove his hand. He may not have been teleported by accidentally touching it, but he does
He shakes his head exasperatedly. “There is a book dedicated to fallen angels in recovering. Or rising angels, as you know I call them.” I don’t bite back my chuckle, and he smiles at me for a second, making my chest ache. Why though? “Anyway, it details a few things we can do to ease the process and just other information.”
Eventually his curiosity gets the best of him. He passes a charming little building and he has to stop. It is lightly coloured with matte black accents and once-clear windows, the glass smooth even beneath the layers of dust. Draco looks at it, his heart warming. It’s a bookshop. He steps closer, hand trailing over bricks and wood, fingers tingling with repressed emotion. Bookstores always bring out the best of him, he thinks. They are warm and cozy, filled with the scent of books both new and old, and they are home to thousands of adventures and stories; glimpses into other people’s lives. He’s read nearly everything in the bookshop near his flat, and he wonders sometimes if his business is what’s keeping the old store running.
“I don’t like him like that,” I deny.
“I guess I did,” I utter nervously. I can’t believe I allowed myself to do that. What if something had happened?
Which he doesn’t. No, Draco is alone in his feelings. It’s the only way he can avoid doing something like
Harry pauses. Something is off. “This was brought into work, remember?”

*~*~*~
“Oh, well, they have a silver string with purple beads.” Draco doesn’t see how this is totally relevant, but he’ll answer any question Potter asks him.
“Unfortunately, yes I do.” Draco frowns, biting his lower lip.
Draco scoffs. “You must have had
It takes a while to figure out how to answer the simple question without giving away my true feelings. I stopped denying them to myself what seems like ages ago, but in reality it’s only been a day. Not that that’s the length of time I’ve been falling for him for, of course. That’s just when I stopped lying to myself about it. These feelings have been building up for nearly a month, and even before that I’ve always been weirdly obsessed with him.
“There’s so many options…” He’s muttering to himself as Harry approaches. “So many…”
“Well then, you’d better hurry,” Harry replies, smirking.
as upset as he’s pretending to be. “No.”
A shuffling of feet and the whistle of a kettle wakes Draco much later, and he pries his eyes open. Potter’s no longer pressed against him, his bare chest no longer right up with Draco’s. He feels a pang in his chest at the loss, but Potter’s voice calms it down.
“A little while before I started being tortured.” It’s hard to get out. The word threatening to become stuck in my throat. I think back to the feelings of utter devastation and desperation. The depression and hopelessness. I never want to experience that again, let alone the physical aspects. I nearly pass out just from thinking about it.
She just shrugs again, smirking. “Let me see it then, dear.”
“Please tell me, Mr. Malfoy, what would be the best time to use this charm?”
Harry is concerned, but not entirely distressed. Malfoy didn’t come back to the cottage yesterday, something he’s never done before. Harry had stayed up late, waiting for the blond Ferret to walk through the front door—no doubt muttering about the chill. That had never happened. Relying on Auror training and skills that arose during the War, Harry had worked out everything he could; not much at all. He’d figured out when Malfoy had left in the morning by using a spell on the post-it note, which acts kind of like a
Having lived in Muggle London for quite a while, he is very used to not only blending in, but actually wearing their clothes as a preference over the restricting wizarding robes. He also happens to frequent their clubs quite often, so if his jeans are all slightly too tight, it’s not exactly his fault. They work really well for taking Muggles home, and they make his arse look amazing. Mind you, they also attract a lot of unwanted attention. Sighing but removing the clothes from the cupboard anyway, he pushes the doors shut. Once they’ve clicked into place, he pads quietly from the room and into the bathroom. If he looks back at Potter now sprawled out on the bed, and if he allows his eyes to roam the man’s lightly muscled chest for a second or two, what does that really matter? No one but him and the gods he so hates will know.
“Of course I do!”
“Harry, yeah?”
“The Dark Lord mentioned something about you hunting horcruxes. Said they were hidden in such dangerous locations, and hidden by ridiculously fierce guardians, that you’d never succeed.”
“Do you have detention?”
“Draco MyFatherWillHearAboutThis Malfoy!”
them! This whole thing is twisted and sick, and Harry’s breathing quickens into a harsh sound with anger.
“I was thinking,” Harry says as he pulls away.
“Where was the green light?”
The end of the day brings Harry wrapped around Draco, hands under his shirt and dragging along his skin. Draco sighs and leans into the caress, dropping his new book down onto his chest. He leans up to kiss Harry, but then the Floo in his flat chimes and the flames turn green.
Hermione smiles a small smile at him before turning back to Harry and I. “I can come back if you need me to, but…”
Once he’s satisfied that the dirt has been washed away, Draco struggles through turning the tap off. He hisses in pain as he uses his injured arm, but he needs both hands to turn the handle. It would be so much easier with his wand. He sighs, trudging across the hole and sitting down at the opposite side again. He tips his head back, resting it against the dirt wall behind him. The sky above is grey, cloud covering what Draco knows is blue. That means it’s either night still, with the moon and stars blotted out by the heavy canopy above—or that it’s going to rain. Pour, really, possibly even storm. Draco knocks his head back, hitting it against the dirt. Knowing his luck and just how much the gods hate him, it’s going to be the latter. He can’t even escape it, trapped as he is. There’s only one thing he
Swallowing heavily and feeling my throat contract slightly, I answer. “Only about an hour ago, I think. It woke me up.” I sneak a glance at Harry and find him already looking my way and nodding thoughtfully.
Draco moves away though, licking and kissing his way back up to Harry’s mouth. Harry groans as they kiss again, his hands clawing at Draco’s back. No one has ever been this thorough, has made him this insane with
close.
By the time Harry is out of the forest and sprinting down the cottage’s path, he is very out of breath. He isn’t quite sweating, but he imagines that he would be if not for the cold. As it is, his skin is flushed pink. Snow flies out from beneath his feet as he approaches the door, and he allows himself to exhale in relief when his hand collides with it. He’s here. Except, there’s one problem. One big problem, that will need to be dealt with before going inside. The door is nearly snowed under.
might be the one who isn’t over it.
“And then there was this one case that
Harry starts to rut against Draco, grunting with the exertion. Draco feels himself harden impossibly more inside his trousers, the sounds turning him on even more. Becoming desperate, he wraps his arms around Harry’s back and meets each thrust. Draco pants heavily, his breath mingling with Harry’s in a pleasant combination of their shared wine and Harry’s natural scent. Harry touches a hand to Draco’s chin, making him open his eyes in surprise. When has he shut them? He’s met with emerald orbs right in front of him, nearly taking his breath away. Draco groans needily and rocks forward. He grunts with the pressure on his cock, and finds himself thinking off everything they could do tonight. Harry snogs him hard, and Draco feels his head hit the door. He can’t complain though, loving the way their tongues just seem to know what to do. If he has a bit of a headache tomorrow, it would be worth it.
out. Not to mention, I physically can’t leave. If I try, I’m electrocuted until I’m knocked out. If that happens four times, I’m instantly killed. I am forced to stay in my tiny, dark, uncomforting room for a month. The only thing I’m allowed to do is write letters. But I have no way of sending them out to anyone or anywhere. With no owl to carry them, I’m doomed. They deliberately let me write for help, knowing that I’m not stupid enough to
“Good morning, Potter,” he raises his chin in a false show of bravado. Better for Potter to think that Draco is arrogant than entirely useless after last night.
Draco tips his head back, encouraging Harry to lean even closer and nip his neck. Draco moans at Harry’s teeth on his throat, his eyes fluttering open. He freezes, all motion halted. “Harry.”
considering his actions in the war and the part he played in Fred’s death, no matter how indirect.
have gone wrong for Malfoy to not have reached out.
the living room, and he’s slightly pleased with his accurate guess. Only slightly, because next is a small kitchen, with just enough room for two people to walk through. He scowls at the lackluster layout—and the lack of an actual dining room. The poor table has just been pushed against a wall to the right side of the kitchen. At least it’s decorated in nice colours and doesn’t make him want to blind himself. To his right he sees a corridor, leading presumably to a bathroom and some bedrooms. It’s only then that he notices his mouth is still hanging open. He forces it shut with an audible pop.
Draco cries out in need, and Harry takes pity on him. They’ve been teasing for ages, and Harry
“Do you know why it took me so long to kiss you?”
The faint scratching of my quill against the heavy parchment of my DADA assignment is oddly comforting. I don’t know when I turned to writing things down, in the dark and silence, but it feels like something you shouldn't do. The Curse of the Bogies is a spell of the curse variety. When cast, it gives the target a nasty cold and very runny nose. I try to think about what to write next, but I’m no good with introduction paragraphs. Potter was supposed to do this part, but he is making me do it. I sigh, and decide to do more later. Since I’ve finished writing, I pull open my bedside drawer and place my quill, ink, and parchment into it. I then slide the drawer shut before locking it with a complex locking charm. Frustrated with Potter for being a lazy arse, I open the curtains surrounding my bed. Light streams in through the window, and I’m temporarily blinded.
white, no one’s skin
Groaning, Harry pulls his hands from his pockets and cracks them. They’re really cold, his skin like ice, but he doesn’t feel cold anymore. If anything, he’s at a perfect temperature. It’s weird, but the whole situation is weird, so he doesn’t think anything of it.
“On the topic of Mr. Potter,” she starts. I stifle another groan. “What exactly is happening there?”
shares a common room now. I am absolutely bewildered by this ridiculous decision. Do they really believe that
Goosebumps prickle at his skin, his hands starting to tingle from the cold. His body shivers, shaking as tremors wreck through it. He wants to cry. He wants to drown in his misery and never face Harry again. He’s a coward, and the bumps across his skin are reminders. If he wasn’t, he would have apologised and gotten over it. No one was seriously hurt, hell, Harry didn’t even wake up! Draco is the only one hurting over this, and he’s causing more pain by isolating himself. He doesn’t care though. Can’t bring himself to get up.
“Really? Not at all?” Harry’s shocked.
“I’m a Blackout Angel,” I explain. “I can control and warp light in any way imaginable.”
“Why so soon?” Potter asks.
Draco comes with a scream, crying out Harry’s name and arching into him. He shakes, his hole contracting around Harry’s cock. Harry falls over the edge too, eyes fixed on Draco’s face. Ropes of his come splash into Draco’s body, Draco’s own come hitting Harry’s chest. He twitches as he keeps coming, his vision whiting out and the strength sapping from his bones. Sparks dance along his skin, and his eyes fall closed.
“Potter… It doesn’t matter,” he comforts.
Mother nods. “Yes, Lucius loved telling me all about it.” Her lips curl into a sneer of disgust. I’m sure that one day my parents loved each other, but those days ended when we were abused and tortured by his wand.
, sounds from him, and he gently pushes at my right side. My hip is forced to the bed, and I find myself sitting awkwardly on one side of my body. The hand leaves me and I shuffle into a more comfortable position. Out of the corner of my eye I can see an oddly coloured bone, and shudder as I realise what it is.
As Harry goes about getting changed and brushing his teeth, he tries not to think about how he’s going to sleep in the same sheets Malfoy wanked in this morning. He doesn’t succeed very well, and the fact that Malfoy definitely cast cleaning charms after being interrupted doesn’t sway his mind at all. He brushes his hair—as he does
Once Harry is certain his presence has gone unnoticed, he moves again. This time, he swings his legs up onto the bed. They land with a soft thud on top of the covers, the fabric stifling any other sound. He freezes as Draco shifts in his sleep, but he doesn’t seem to have awoken. Harry releases a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding, and tucks his legs under the covers. From here, it should be easy. All he has to do is slide his shoulders down so he’s under the blankets, and then go to sleep. And it is that easy. His whole body is enveloped in the warm blanket, but his foot is touching Draco’s shin, and he’s suddenly aware of how close together they are.
Harry frowns, tracing his finger along one. The skin is raised and rough. How he hadn’t found them earlier is beyond him, but he has now. “I’m so sorry Draco.”
“Bingo!” Harry says, face lighting up.
“Hey! Wait up a sec!” He calls, remembering his promised hot chocolate.
Malfoy is now on him, leaning over him and kissing him as he aligns their hips. Harry bites down on his hand, stifling his groans. He imagines the blond rocking against him, panting into his mouth. He moves faster still, feeling his orgasm rapidly approaching. Harry chases his release, desperate to come despite only just starting. He sees Malfoy move and take his cock into his mouth, and imagines him swirling his tongue around the head. Harry squeezes himself at the same time, and explodes over his fist.
“Yes, it saves me having to question customers about who they are.” Madame Warren smiles. “So, back to business,” she quirks an eyebrow, and I remember her asking what we were after.
“Is this better?” He asks, voice soft and hands firm as they slide back down.
“Hey Draco?” My stomach starts fluttering, a shiver racing down my spine. I’m still not used to it. Not used to Harry,
Potter sighs in relief and stretches his arms above his head. “Let’s go for a walk.”
wrong. Potter very rarely suffers like the rest of the workers, so Robards must have deemed it extra important.
“Fuck,” Draco whimpers, head falling onto the pillows. His back arches again, his whole body contorting with aftershocks. Harry grins at him, a weak smile that is reflected back when Draco looks at him.
Potter’s expression darkens. “Deep purple with lighter purple swirls? Separated with smaller black beads?”
Harry feels like he’s falling through space in the most pleasant way. It feels like he’s floating next to the sun, or flying through an endless amount of stars. He really does love Draco fucking Malfoy, and nothing can change that. Especially not when they’re pressed together in sleep, and Draco feels like home wrapped around him.
“It’s hideous isn’t it?” Harry laughs. “I much prefer green trees.”
Warnings: PTSD, hurt/comfort
sleep in then? We could be working.” Draco blinks, his hair falling into his eyes, but makes no move to get up.
When he sees that it’s just after 7:30, he feels like turning around and going back to bed. It’s way too early to be traipsing through a cottage and freezing to death.
“That is where you’re wrong, Draco. And you know that, because I told you so ten minutes ago.” One of her hands threads through her hair, tugging at it in frustration. “Why do you never listen?”
you are. You don’t fool me Malfoy!” He calls out even as Draco is already moving.
He’d realised Harry wasn’t in a great place these last few years, he’d
Draco has never seen Jenkins so relaxed as he has today, and something about it sets him on edge. Almost like something is about to happen that will change the course of his life. However, that won’t be the case. It’s just his overactive mind trying to force something onto a perfectly normal situation. Again. Maybe Jenkins just woke up later than usual today and had an especially good coffee? Yeah, that’s probably it.
His feet seem to carry him there by themselves. Realising that most of the people in the Great Hall are watching him, he thinks that he might as well start his plan now. Refreshed with new purpose, Harry strides confidently up to the dais where the professors are eating. He climbs up to the platform and charms his voice louder so he doesn’t have to yell.
Honestly. Potter has some nerve! Dragging draco out of bed, forcing him to assess that stupid cabinet... and now look at where they've ended up! Draco’s blood is boiling in a way no one else can get it to. Potter has always driven him up a wall. Draco sighs. He knows he needs to calm down. Bad things happen when he’s irrational. He can’t let his anger rule his head. He needs to find something to do.
~~~~~~~~
“What, no?” Potter’s reply is immediate. Just like the sensation of Draco’s heart dropping into his stomach. “I need to be with you so that I can analyse everything.”
to see this.
“No. Nuh uh, no way.”
Draco scowls half heartedly but goes about collecting things to make two hot cocoas.
you,” Potter tries. Only, Draco swears he hears him utter ‘not immediately, at least…’
Draco’s eyes widen as he realises what this means. He doesn’t say anything though, and Harry watches as a small smile flicks onto his face. Something else crosses Harry’s mind, something much more interesting than his friends being prats.
Potter just shrugs. “Honestly, I don’t care about that anymore. It’s been a long day, and all I want is a nice, hot drink to relax with.”
The command, an echo of his own yesterday, sends Draco over the edge. He shakes, his back arching as he comes in his pants. Sparks fly through his body, tingling in his fingers and making his toes curl. His chest hits Harry’s, his feet pressing him even closer.
Once the food is ready, Potter has made an appearance in the kitchen, leaning his hip against the counter and watching. He makes no move to help as Draco plates the food and pours them both coffee, but does try to carry it all out into the living room. Draco doesn’t let him get far with it before taking the mugs off him—that was a disaster waiting to happen, really. No one can carry two plates and two mugs without spilling anything… except maybe Muggle waiters. They’re geniuses, and Draco has no idea how they do it.
you saw me reading that trashy romance novel.” He takes a breath. “There never could be anything more than friendship. She knew that too, and she still agreed. Sometimes I wonder why…” Draco trails off.
Malfoy just looks at him like he’s mad, like someone who loses four games in a row can’t
he’d started improving himself, dragging him out of magical fire and onto the back of a broom. Draco feels warmth bloom in his stomach at the thought of Potter caring enough about him to risk his own life; multiple times too.
Draco just nods at him, eyes incredibly soft and open. Then they sharpen, his face coming back to poised and alert. “You won. What do you want as a prize?”
The man grunts and then goes still. Draco doesn’t care, speeding his pace up. He needs release, needs to
Harry shrugs. He pulls out his wand and casts a cleaning charm, his skin clearing and the sweat evaporating instantly.
*~*~*~
By the time Potter is sweating again and swearing as he pushes himself up to jump, Draco is warm enough to begin. His blood pulses in his ears, thrumming against his head and drowning out most thoughts. There’s only two that plague his mind, one screaming at him for working out in the middle of winter, and the other delighted that he’s seeing Potter shirtless and dripping. Draco shakes his head, takes a swig of water, and jumps. His feet clear the ground and he lands again, immediately falling to his chest and pushing himself up to jump again. His heart hammers in his chest, but Potter grins at him and it’s all worth it.
“Maybe they were talking about if I didn’t manage to find you?” Harry chews his lip. “Or maybe they aren’t connected at all and I’m overthinking everything.”
A hand is carding through Draco’s hair, stroking through the strands and massaging his scalp carefully.
Draco groans loudly, his head falling back onto the mattress. His fingers press into Harry’s head harder, digging into his skin in a pleasurable burn. Harry nips at the side of his throat, licking over the mark before sucking it into his mouth again. His tongue swirls over it, and he hopes it bruises. When he gets back to London, he wants everyone to see it and
“I want to fuck you into the mattress,” he growls, pulling a loud moan from Draco.
“Thank you so much,” Harry is saying now. “I’ll have to tell him that!”
There’s a bang from inside the cottage, and Draco’s head whips around as if expecting to see the wall in pieces. It
to get it because of the colours; a bottle of oatmeal all-natural body wash; a turquoise bar of soap in the shape of a wave; and a bottle of moisturiser with cocoa butter in it. Pansy talks his ears off about how good it is for her skin, so he didn’t think he could pass it up.
Draco wakes up, skin prickled into goosebumps and tremors racking through his body. He shakes and shivers, pulling the blankets tighter around himself. Sitting up, Draco stretches and yawns, wincing as the covers fall away. He blinks his eyes open slowly and finds himself in the living room, sitting on the sofa.
“The Dark Lord and my father called me into one of their meetings in about, um, the beginning of March?” My hand starts shaking, so I pin carefully move my left to cover the wrist and gently squeeze it. It acts as an anchor, something else to focus on then the conversation I’m being forced into having. Potter is nodding opposite me, his eyes flickering to my wrist for just a second before travelling back up to my eyes. His face turns grim, mouth a thin line, but Granger just nods and jots down notes with her version of Potter’s muggle quill. “They plan to crash the Unspeakables’ Department, which you already knew… The plans were for the start of May, but that could’ve changed.”
Draco smiles at the idea of more colourful globes and races after Harry, who’s already halfway across the plaza.
“What, so we’ll have a list of the times someone tampered with the core and what they did to it?”
Feeling dirty and gross, he makes to get up.
“Are you ready yet?” Draco asks, the floor around his feet littered with bags.
Taking note of the passageways and shortcuts to get to the common room faster, I realise where the dorms are situated.
“Okay. Wow, can I?” Granger asks. I’m confused for a second, before I realise what she means.
“What are you…?”
It’s amazing, the things he found. Most of it was useless junk that looked pretty but served no practical purpose, but some of it was much more useful. Like the Muggle first aid kit in the bathroom. Harry pushes open the door without much thought and walks over to the sink. He pulls the cabinet open and withdraws the red bag. When he looks through it quickly, he finds exactly what he needs. Closing the cabinet with a wordless spell, Harry grabs the bag and walks down the corridor back to the living room.
Harry stands back, waiting for whatever Draco will do. He pulls his wand out again, this time waving it in a slow circle and then in a horizontal arc. Yellow sparks spit out of his wand, and then one catches into fire. Harry panics, ready to strike, but Draco holds up a hand. Swallowing, Harry watches as the other sparks light up and then scatter. Yellow fire spreads over the courtyard, bathing it in a strange light.
“Why though? It’s not like I have anything to do,” Draco says, pouting. Harry wants to kiss it away and slap it off simultaneously.
Harry isn’t sure who said it, but he glares in the general direction. The image of Draco kissing someone other than him turns his mood sour. The weight in his gut reappears.
“Okay there?” I inquire, only semi-mocking.
“Good afternoon sir,” the man behind the counter says as he approaches Draco. “Can I help you in any way?”
He rifles through it, looking for something he can cook. After pushing everything aside and scanning every box he can find, he comes up with nothing. He chews his lip, moving over to the fridge. The remains of the Buche de Noel is still sitting there, half eaten, and it’s very tempting to just pull it out and eat
There’s an extremely pale woman behind the counter, her dark and curly hair in braids. It’s an interesting contrast, Draco thinks; white skin with black curls. Maybe her parents are of different ethnicities.
“Well, I know how you get without coffee, so…”
doing here?”
“Have you not seen that movie?” He asks, prodding Malfoy in the ribs.
Draco smiles against his skin and keeps pumping him, working his hand slower and steadier. Harry twitches again, his legs locking and stretching. Eventually his vision comes back and his eyes open, finding Draco’s right in front of him.
Draco isn’t quite sure what ‘Jesus’ means, and will have to ask about that later. Right now though, he hollows his cheeks around the head and starts pushing his head further down. Potter’s hand cards through Draco’s hair, tugging on it slightly. The sharp pleasure feels great, and he moans around the cock in his mouth. He can feel Potter twitch inside him, and he keeps swallowing more of him down. He gets most of it in, and the part he can’t get to, he wraps his hands around. Potter exhales heavily and pulls at Draco’s hair again. Draco opens his eyes and lifts his gaze, meeting emerald eyes. There are stars in the green, clouds of arousal and need blending beautifully. The sight of Potter so clearly wanting him makes him harden slightly again.
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy says again. “I’ll make you a new coffee.”
The title is written in a sprawling cursive, black ink a stark contrast against slightly-yellowing parchment. It reads; “Risen Angels’ Abilities”.
“One.” They pull at both ends of the gold wrapped cracker, neither putting in much effort. Narcissa doesn’t have any to give, and Draco doesn’t want to beat her. It results in a sad glimpse of what life could have been.
Choosing battleships, Harry walks back to the living room. He finds Malfoy eating yet another slice of cake and a mug of peppermint tea waiting for him on the coffee table. Harry’s eyes meet Malfoy’s as he licks some of the cake off his mouth. Harry’s eyes darken and go out of focus, everything blurring out except Malfoy. Malfoy, who just sits there as if nothing’s wrong. Harry swallows hard, blinks to clear his vision, and forces himself to calm down. He slides onto the couch and throws the game onto the table, grabbing the mug of tea and burning his tongue as he takes a swallow.
needs to wash his hair.
“Come on now, it was only a nightmare.”
That draws a startled laugh from him, which he quickly covers with a cough. I smile to myself though, glad that I can still extract a reaction from him. Even if it isn’t a snarl or a punch.
“You already have,” Draco counters. “Now
expecting it to be this one. Who could possibly imagine that they’d be called in early, touch a cursed object—because clearly it
Harry shakes his head with a roll of his eyes. “Of course that’s what you latch onto.”
while cooking?” Draco’s eyebrows rise, pale arches that Harry’s eyes helplessly track.
Harry’s heart stops, his chest bursting with fireworks at his first name falling off Draco’s lips. “Good morning, again,” Harry says with a chuckle.
Draco sighs, tugging the blankets up higher. He’s freezing, body shaking. There’s no way it was this cold a few minutes ago. Then again, he was in front of a fire. Draco grunts, rearranging himself and trying to get comfortable while not allowing any of the cold into the bed. He’s going to turn to ice in his sleep, but there’s not much he can do.
Malfoy huffs. “Fine, just don’t wake me when you shower in the morning.”
Draco moans loudly, legs wrapping around Harry’s waist. “Do it then.”
Aaah I’m so sorry for the wait! I got caught up with another fic for a fest (all done now, no I can’t say anything about it), and just didn’t have the time. Also note that I’m going into an exam period, so I can’t promise I’ll get another chapter next week either. But I’ll never drop this fic (especially not so close to the end!) so don’t worry about that. Have a lovely week Xx
weird.
is behind this and it’s not just some big coincidence—doesn’t want to make it easy to get back. Standing up, Draco moves into the living area once again. It feels like all he’s done today is aimlessly wander around, even if he knows there is a purpose behind it. Clearing his head and willing himself to relax, he enters the living room. His eyes search for Potter on instinct, and is somewhat disappointed when he doesn’t see him. If he really listens though, he can hear him moving about in the bathroom still.
“Really? But you said it was only established… about 50 years ago,” Draco interjects, coming to stand beside Harry.
Harry grins. “Who says I don’t like chess?!”
Draco watches as something in his expression flickers, emotions shifting beneath the surface of his face.
~~~~~~~~
They carry their food out into the living room, Draco plopping back into his seat from earlier. Harry sits down next to him, nudging close. Draco wants to chastise him for it, but can’t find it in himself to do so. He wraps the pasta around his fork, carefully bringing it to his mouth. It’s delicious and perfectly cooked, the chicken buttery and juicy.
This chapter is a little bit short than usual, only about 4,300 words instead of 5,000.
Harry feels a little cheated about that. He spent ages carefully rubbing his boyfriend’s sun lotion in, just to have him use a spell! That’s not fair.
“Do you want us to heal the scar, sir?” The MediWitch with greying hair asks me. I shake my head.
It works, everyone in the room yelping, alerting me to where everyone is. Keeping my ears peeled, I continue to tamper with the lighting, dodging people and just being a general nuisance to these people who are trying to help me. I feel kind of bad, blinding them on repeat and then plunging them into darkness in the space of a second. A good friend wouldn’t do that. Then again, the people I face in the actual battle won’t be good friends, will they?
“Draco.” Harry’s thumb rubs comfortingly over my hand. “I know what you mean,” he says. His skin is tinged slightly pink.
The man hums, eyes flicking over Draco’s face and then the many counters. “I don’t know if we sell anything like that…” he says after a second in thought. “I can have a look out the back if you’d like?”
“I love you,” he says, broken glass littering the floor. That seems to stop whatever tangent Harry was about to start, and he just stares at Draco.
“Bloody hell Potter,” Draco murmurs, eyes hooded and dark. His cheeks are pink, his chest splotchy.
Except, when he braves a look back at Malfoy, it’s to find a small smile and sparkling eyes watching his own plate; a stark difference to what was there a few seconds before.
Potter’s bubble is last, but once I get to it I don’t know what to write. He seemed important enough to include, but now I just don’t know. Deciding to put it off for the meanwhile, I draw a big question mark next to his name. I have no idea how I feel about him; apart from the fact that I don’t hate him. I know little about him, yet I want to learn more. But I don’t? It’s like something inside of me wants to know him,
“Yes, well.” Harry doesn’t know how to finish the sentence. What else is there to say?
Malfoy shakes his head at him, blond hair flying free and into his eyes. He lifts a hand to tuck it behind his ear and makes his first move.
“The first boy was right,” he tells Draco. “That store was no older than 45 years.”
“I’m aware,” I say with a smirk. He hands me the parchment and quill and I start answering the rest of the lines.
A hand on my wrist forces me to a halt. It’s too small to be Harry’s, meaning it’s Hermione who is currently preventing me from disappearing. Determined as always, I don’t turn to face her when she speaks.
“That’s plenty, Harry…” I croak.
late- Oh. He’d only had an apple for breakfast… and by now it’s definitely past midday. Harry sighs. He hadn’t thought to bring food with him. Of course he hadn’t. Harry curses past him and condemns his afternoon to hunger.
Harry pulls Draco in behind him, and now Draco follows without hesitation. The water laps around their waists, as high as Harry was willing to push Draco today. They stand one behind the other, Harry once again pressing into his boyfriend from the front. Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, watching the waves from his shoulder. The white tips are quite beautiful in their own way, a sign of strength even within a delicate aesthetic. Draco slowly loses himself to watching the waves, the water becoming engraved in his senses.
Feathers. It has been nearly two months since I had any, and I don’t even know if the dark ones floating in the air count. I’m stunned for a moment, before forcing myself to actually think about them. The bones are mostly covered, only peeking through in a couple of spots. There aren’t as many feathers as there should be — they are far from full — but the ones I have look healthy and beautiful. The light brown complements my normal skin tone in an odd way that I don’t quite understand, and my eyes look alive for the first time in days. And then of course there’s the blood. I slam the mirror away, a look of disgust flitting across my face. Harry seems to understand what it means, as his wand is back out and pointing at me in an instant. He casts a cleaning charm and Vanishes the remaining blood and skin.
“I’m well, actually,” she stands up from where she was sitting on the bed and meets me in the middle of the room. Despite the fact that a little while ago she was fatally wounded and fast asleep, she looks very healthy right now. Her pale skin is no longer cloudy, but much more like porcelain, and her hair looks vibrant against her face. “How are you dear?”
“It looks… straighter?” Harry announces, piping in before Draco can say anything.
Wanting to sink his entire body into the water, Harry tries to take another step forward. Draco trips over his feet but somehow remains standing. He rolls his eyes when Harry stumbles through an apology, and the sand, but follows him further into the water.
“Yeah. I paid for you to be put in a special ward, where you can’t be traced.”
“So, what? The kitchen is… sped up? While the rest of the cafe is at normal time?”
, so pale and warm, so
“Fuck,” Draco curses under his breath. He slows down, hands clutching at his side and stomach.
To start with, Potter had saved Draco’s life. He’d clearly spent hours thinking about it, spent the whole day searching for him, and then only found him as he was walking back to the cottage. Draco may have been slightly out of it yesterday, but he isn’t now. The fact that Potter literally pulled him out of the hole hasn’t escaped him. Draco knows Potter’s wand was in his pocket—he felt it shift against him when Potter had pushed the door to the cottage open, the magic resonating through his body even in sleep—which means that Potter either chose to lift him out manually to protect his scraped up body… or that he was so focused on helping that he forgot he even
that Draco likes Indian
Rows and rows of candies, chocolates, and confectionary fill the shop. Neat signs and labels are everywhere, telling customers what they are drooling over and how much they need to pay in order to sink their teeth into it. I let myself grin at the image. I pace up one of the aisles, and find myself looking at some chocolate frogs. I hesitantly pick up one of the blue boxes, and then another.
Humming to myself, I think over everything I’ve written again. Satisfied, I begin putting away my quill and ink. Then, with a gentle swoop of my wand, the page is transfigured into one of my drawings. I then mask it under a very strong invisibility charm. There is no way Harry will find it without my input, and he will never get that.
“Out the door, straight down the corridor, three doors on the left,” I say, not even thinking about it. After all, I’ve spent weeks thinking about this moment. Simultaneously hoping for it, and dreading it. Potter carefully opens the door, and I watch as he creeps out of my bedroom. I wonder how this happened. How the ‘
“Yeah, but you also mentioned they were in purple and silver robes.” Malfoy frowns. “I’m so sick of those colours.”
preventing leaving. He doesn’t know why he can’t just Apparate out. The problem is, even if he did manage to find something, he wouldn’t have been to do anything about it. The wards are very tightly packed, he doubts a pin would fit between them. While his magic may be able to squeeze in, he wouldn’t have been able to see what he was doing. An expert must have put these up, he’s sure. But, if someone went to all the effort of assembling some top of the art wards, why did they abandon the cottage? Potter checked on Monday, no one has ever stayed here. It’s weird, and Draco tries not to think about it for too long.
“Suit yourself,” the worker says, drawing their attention back to the baked goods.
“Look here Malfoy. What do you think of this?”
going to make it to Harry, and he
A strange thought occurs to him now. What if the Vanishing Cabinet… is doing something to make this happen? It’s possible, Harry knows it is. The Cabinet could have traced them with something, a spell to slowly draw them together for warmth. It could be setting them up, moving them gradually closer. Harry wants to laugh at the notion. There's no way in hell that’s the case, this isn’t a damned fairytale. Even so, Harry can’t deny the way they only seem to be comfortable when they’re together.
“Malfoy. You are dying.” I want to disagree, but realise he’s probably right. Not that I’d ever tell him that. “Stay here. I’ve decided for you.” He nods his head at me before slipping through the door, and pacing silently down the hallway.
“Draidan?”
“Can I help?”
Once the magic rockets back into Draco’s wand, knocking him into Harry’s chest and making them both wobble, Harry takes the tree's new appearance in. It’s wrapped in lights, silver and blue sparkling up and down the tree. Silver tinsel wraps around it, the baubles shifting in different colours of blue and purple. Harry thinks it looks gorgeous.
“Was. It’s mine now.”
“Sounds about right.”
Malfoy slides the books over to him, hands suddenly shaking. Harry takes them in his, stilling them. The man looks at the titles and then back at them, and grins at them.
A Vanishing Cabinet. Of fucking course it is. Merlin clearly has a sick sense of humour, to be punishing him for what happened in Sixth Year all these bloody years later! Draco sighs, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. Taking a breath, he nods. The hair vanishing thing makes more sense now. It’s still weird, but not quite
When he
“That said,” Parkinson cuts in, “I’m not too upset about it. You two have finally come to your senses,
Towards the end of class, Professor Falco announces that we will have an assignment due at the end of the term. The class predictably groans, and she stands at the front of the room with a gleam in her eye. Like she knows something we don’t.
magical. The truth is that the Aurors just don’t prioritise missing persons cases that much. He’d know, after all. He’s worked a few before, but all at his own request for wanting to help the families. He
“Brilliant,” Hermione says on a sigh of relief. She carefully makes her way back to the tree, sliding down the bark and to the ground. Tapping the grass next to her, she beckons me to follow. I do as she says and make myself comfortable. I look at her for a second, wondering about the Golden Trio’s relationship. Harry is in the very centre of this war, the only person who can ultimately defeat the Dark Lord. Weasley and Hermione are off to the side, heroes only because they befriended him when they were eleven years old. They must be constantly worried about his well-being, as well as being concerned for their own. Because they are targets too. Get to either of them, get to Harry. And now I’m in the picture, not that I ever
Harry sighs. “That’s because it isn’t official. I’m doing something ‘Mione told me to do sometimes.” At the look on Malfoy’s face, he adds, “That’s all you’re getting.”
Draco smiles, slightly reassured. Just because Harry likes it doesn’t mean Blaise will, especially not with the amount of bias Harry now holds.
“Pants. Off,” Draco breathes heavily. He has never wanted to get another man naked more so than right now.
, I don’t know.” Draco looks at Jenkins, who is grinning at him. That expression makes his stomach turn even though he started the day by throwing up.
I nod my head at him, delighted at the prospect of the game continuing.
“I really, really want to,” Draco admits with a smile.
“Let’s go then,” he says, already standing up and pulling Draco towards him.
Shrugging on his coat as the cold February air hits him, his eyes land on Potter. Still shirtless, he looks even more tantalising than he did inside. His muscles ripple as he walks down the street, hair glinting in the glow of the streetlights. Draco hurries after him into an alleyway, drawing his wand. He wouldn’t know what to do if something was to go wrong, and he desperately didn’t need another distraction from getting laid.
Draco feels a little sheepish, but he doesn’t comment. Instead, he turns back around and grips his wand tightly.
“I’ve just remembered something!” Regardless of how much I want to shove his face into the sofa to shut him up, the excitement in his voice is so strong that it must be good. With no explanation given, Harry pushes me off the sofa and then runs out of the drawing room. I grumble as I stand up from the hard and uncomfortable floor, flinging a longing gaze at the sofa. Sighing, I force myself to only
Draco runs a hand through his hair, pushing it out of his eyes. “Fine. I’ll finish here, you eat your breakfast, and then we can talk about getting out of here.” He’s sick of Harry’s shit, sick of not knowing where he stands with him. This just adds yet another layer of confusion that he doesn’t want to deal with.
“Come on Malfoy! You
He grins at her, not bothering to hide how much that means to him. She shoos him along, and he takes a tentative step towards Harry and his tiny cousin. As he approaches and takes a look at Teddy, he sees the child’s hair and eyes shift. His hair turns platinum blond, gentle curls raking through it. His eyes are the same startling green colour that Harry’s are, and the result is a boy that could very well be
“Come on, let’s go!” Draco shouts, his voice echoing from the front door into the bedroom.
Draco huffs. “Our friends are setting us up,” he says, unable to keep his voice from shaking. Warmth rushes to his cheeks in what he knows is a furious blush.
“How come?”
clumsy, despite what Draco may have thought previously. He sighs, stretches his hands out, and pushes his chair out from the transfigured desk. Once he’s standing, he flicks his wand and it reverts back into the chest of drawers, his paints flying back into the crevices they came out from. His paintings lie on top of it to dry, and as soon as he’s checked them over, he leaves the bedroom.
“I was thinking we should ask some more questions about the history of the village, see if we can glean any info from that.”
There’s a row of trees on the other side, lining the edge of the pavements and where they join to the grass. Gold lights twine around the trunks and weave into the branches, reminding Draco distantly of Christmas tree fairies. The golden orbs shine through the pale green leaves, bathing the area in a soft yellow light.
The squirrel is soaked through and covered in leaves and mud, and Draco’s heart clenches. The little thing doesn’t deserve to be out in the rain, not like he himself does. It skitters around the hole, trying to jump out back onto the forest floor. When all attempts are fruitless, the squirrel gives up and tries to climb out instead. It spots the beginnings of the alcove Draco has been digging, and launches itself at it. The hole in the wall squelches as the animal lands in it, but it holds. Draco would have screamed if it hadn’t. The squirrel looks around from its vantage point, probably trying to find something else to jump off of.
Harry’s eyebrows furrow, pulling down over his eyes. “Do we?” His heart flutters at the collective pronoun, but he tries to push it aside.
“But I’ve already told you…?” Potter really wants me to repeat our conversation. The last time I said this I felt awful. Helpless and useless.
The few things I have on me should be enough, but I check them all over anyway. There’s little I can’t do with my wand, so the only other things I have are spare wands, bandages in case I lose those wands, and a muggle dagger. I doubt I’ll use any of them, but I was told to take them anyway. I don’t think about where the spare wands came from. With one last look at Harry, I nod. I’m ready.
Then there’s the fact that Draco’s wand mysteriously appeared on his bedside table. It was definitely not there last night, probably still under the bloody cushion on the sofa, leaving only one solution. Potter moved it. They really have come full circle. Draco remembers the awkwardness when Potter had given him his wand back for the first time. The stilted-ness of it all, hands touching weirdly and looks of confusion shared. Draco hadn’t known why Potter was even giving it back to him at the time. He’d thought it had been due to Potter’s hero complex, forcing him to help even the weakest cases.
“Right back at you.” It sounds confident, but he has to work to not let his face heat or his voice shake.
A whole day later and I’m preparing to head to bed. The clock on the common room wall says that it’s just past eleven, and since I have another full day of classes tomorrow I decide I’d better get my sleep. I close my book on magical creatures, and walk steadily up the staircase and into my dorm. Glancing at Blaise to make sure he’s asleep, I draw the emerald curtains around my bed and get changed into my night wear. I look at my reflection and take in how I look. My blond hair is still neat and shiny, but my face is tired and pale and the clothes hang limply off my toned body. The dark blue of the pyjamas doesn’t help anything either, and I sigh to myself. I pick up my wand from my bed where I threw it, and cast a wordless cleaning charm to brush and whiten my teeth. I sit down and draw open the curtains again, just about to slide into bed. The door is tentatively pushed inwards, and a head of curly black hair shoves it’s way into the slight crack.
He pops the tip out of his mouth to run his tongue along a vein. It makes Draco whimper, and he does it again. Harry takes the head back into his mouth, sucking down on it. That would make
“‘Mione?” Harry responds in a question.
“Wings…?” I nod solemnly, grief and pain etched clearly on my face. I’m not bothered hiding my emotions right now, being in so much pain.
I nod absentmindedly, not quite agreeing with her but not wanting to argue.
“What on earth do I need these for, Potter?”
he’d had. Clearly it hadn’t been anything great.
Malfoy’s sigh fills the silence. “Well, I figured I might as well try to do something, so I can still give some gifts this year. I’m decent at art—I like anything visual, really—so I thought I might make people something instead of buying them things.”
There’s a pile of Famous Wizards Chocolate Frogs Cards, a box of Bertie’s, and a dragon figurine. Draco flicks his wand and the blue dragon comes to life, flying circles over their heads.
important—and he feels slightly sick when he thinks of how this Christmas might turn out. What if he isn’t back before then? Will anyone even notice?
“What are we doing here anyway?” I ask, hands curling into fists on my waist.
“Who says we’re together?”
“I’m not dressed!” Draco says.
“We will get to that in just a moment, Malfoy. Now, would you like a biscuit?” I shake my head, the ‘biscuits’ look absolutely revolting. Slughorn shrugs and takes a bite of his own. How did I know he wouldn’t get straight to the point.
After a moment of standing there like a loon, he moves over to the chest of drawers. Draco’s paintings are sitting on one side to dry, and the rest of the surface is taken over by Harry’s report. He’d somehow managed to finish it last night, despite whirling away from Draco like a coward. He sighs, his eyes dropping to the floor. Swallowing, he forces himself to lift his head. What happened can’t be changed, but he can take the initiative to make something of it now.
Draco sat with his back to the wall just below the window, and his side pressed against the thick clear wall that stood between him and his love.
"Her whereabouts are still currently unknown, but we'll find her. We found the rest of them didn't we?" There was the tone again, like she was strangling puppies, or torturing kittens.
Harry smiled wistfully as he placed his hand against Draco's.
Harry mimicked Draco's actions as he slid down beside him, both leaning against the thick wall that divided them.
Their punishment was not to die, but to live. To live knowing that all half bloods and muggle-borns had long since been killed. They lived knowing that there was a rebellion going on, as blood-traitors that had managed to escape Voldemort's punishment tried to fight back. More and more dying with each passing day.
"Good morning, my love." Draco stood facing the window, tears started to stream down his cheeks.
"He's done it, he's finally done it. Our dark lord has finally given me the order to kill you both." She cackled.
Draco felt himself lean back against the wall, sliding down, Harry's hand held firmly in his own.
Draco could smell it, gas in the air. They were going to make this slow. He had 8 minutes max. He could already feel his chest tightening.
"I wish I could kiss you again, one last time." Harry said absently.
"The youngest Weasley boy." She practically cheered.
"Oh," Harry sighed. And what more could he say. "What about Ginny and Neville?" He asked, as he walked to the window, enduring another coughing fit.
"Draco?" Harry coughed as he began to wake up.
Draco stood up and looked out the window. The sun hadn't risen yet and the field outside was dark. When Draco turned around, Bellatrix was gone.
The poison in the air gripped his lungs again and he began to cough, thick, heavy coughsthat left him breathless and sore throated.
"Because I'm still your nephew, we're still blood." Draco said.
He put his hand in the gap between their wall and their window, 'palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss,' He thought.
Draco nodded, "I love you too, Harry." He coughed again.
"Good morning, Draco." An all too familiar voice rang through his cell.
Bellatrix seemed to scoff at the very idea, but held to her word with a mumbled spell, the thick metal cover that had blocked the sunlight from the cell for five years disintegrated a small gap between the wall and the window, approximately the width of Draco's hand, took the metals place.
Harry made a face at him, smiling.
“Yes, we are.”
“Really?”
Harry laughed as they stepped closer, holding hands.
what I need.  I heard that there is a muggle ice-skating rink set up in Diagon.  Maybe we can take him?”
The next morning, Boxing Day, was filled with more laughter, more food, and more fun.  The kids dragged Draco out to play in the snow with them, and they ended up making a large fort, where they set up a supply of snowballs.
Harry was now moving at breakneck speed, and knew he was close.  “Gods and Merlin above, you are so fucking gorgeous.  Are you going to come for me?  You’ve been so good, Draco, so good.”
too fast, and I’m going to land flat on my face.  I don’t want to be the reason you get even more bad press.”  He took a breath, and then flushed as he realized what he had just said.
Harry sat the paper and pens down as well, and went to the small closet behind the door and pulled out the trays that he had bought when he had remodelled the en suite.  He placed them over the edges of the tub, and then turned to Draco, holding out his hand.
Sorry this chapter is so late, but it’s still the 18th in my time zone for another 16 minutes, so I’m calling it a win!!  Thank you for reading!!
“Yes, love, he’s doing better.  I didn’t realise you’d noticed.”
“Happy Birthday, Harry!” Ginny said from across the table.  He went around and kissed her on the cheek, then shook hands with Neville.
“Merlin, that was sexy.”
“Good morning, Master Draco,” Kreacher said, bowing low.  “What can Kreacher do for you?”
“What’s to talk about?  I’m a death eater.  Everyone knows it, and most don’t like it.  Don’t like that I’m here.”  He looked up at Harry.    “Don’t like that you helped me.  Don’t like that we’re friendly now.”
Pulling back after several moments, Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s, before rubbing his cheek against Harry’s prickly cheek.  “Merlin, the things you do to me, Potter.”  He physically shivered, kissing Harry’s neck.  “I want to say, though… Thank you,” he whispered in Harry’s ear.
Teddy skipped out of the room, as Harry and Draco slumped back down in the bed at the same time.
“That’s my point.  I only stay whenever you are there.  If you have to work late, or are on a mission, I don’t feel as if I can stay there by myself.”
Draco drained the spaghetti, and tasted the sauce.  He flicked his wand and made everything combine into one bowl, and then flicked it again to make plates and utensils land onto the table.
“Think about it!  We could elope.  Do things
“I would much rather be an ‘8
Hermione gave him a curious look, glancing around the room to see everyone’s eyes on them.  She seemed to blush before averting her eyes back to the gift in her hands, quickly unwrapping it.  She pulled the lid off of it, and gasped loudly.  She reached for Ron’s hand, gripping it tightly as she took in the pendant and chain.
“Yes, sir,” he said with a mock salute.
Harry just grinned at the trio before him.  “Great!  I don’t have the first clue as to what to do, so I appreciate all the help I can get.”
“Not until this is all over with,” he said with a sigh.  “I wish there was something more I could do for him.”
“I, er, made it.”
“Harry, mate, this is brilliant.  We don’t have any photographs of us before our wedding, so this is bloody brilliant.”
“Harry, please repeat after me.”  She spoke, and he copied her words, looking at Draco and gripping his hands.
She smiled at them as she motioned for them to step closer.  “Please cross your arms.”
“Hmmm, that sounds wonderful! Florean’s?”
“Because, what would the media do if newly engaged Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were to go out on the town, separately, drinking their friends under the table, and behaving like one does at a stag-do?”
, in order to be able to get away from Dudley and his goons. I’ve never ridden a two-seater, though.  But, how hard could it be?”
Harry showed Ron the newly finished room.  Windows lined the back wall, looking over the garden.  Harry had bought two long divans, one sitting underneath the windows, the other jutting out towards the door, making a large L shape.  In the open space behind the second divan sat a small work table and chairs.
“About dying.”
“It's not really called Big League,” she said, giving him a smile. “Whatever you want. I was actually looking forward to teaching the kids the Finbourgh Flick tonight.”
“I’ve got it,” Draco said, handing Harry his wallet. “You gave it to me, remember?”
“Er,” Harry said. He dropped the customer service smile. “Did you bring the slip I gave you last week or did you want something else today?”
“It’s just a therapy assignment. My therapist is pretty happy with my progress, so I don’t have to—it was just an excuse to go out, you know. A reason to go out, more like. Because my PTSD—we aren’t actually sure how the PTSD, anxiety, and depression mesh, if they’re three different things or if it’s all of it PTSD,  but one of the big things is that I get these intrusive thoughts, that affect, well, everything, and…I end up withdrawing from everything. Social isolation, it’s called. And I went to the Archive as a part of the treatment, to…try to get over that? The assignment was to go somewhere I’ve never been to socialise with someone I don’t know.”
Draco had slept over after Big Gay Pub Night and was lying face down on Harry’s side of the bed, a cloud of blond hair covering most of his face—Harry briefly wondered if he was actually able to breathe, smushed into the pillow like that. It’d been late when they’d left the pub; Percy and Oliver had eventually shown up, and then, because Oliver had told all
“No, I suppose they wouldn’t be,” Malfoy mused. “These aren’t meant to be ingested, I presume?”
“I usually go on Fridays, just get a couple of pints and catch up. It’s fun, you should come. Some of your friends might even be there, too.” Malfoy had never come to the pub with them, Harry realised. Pansy was usually there, Blaise came every once in a while, Goyle had come once, accompanying Blaise.
“Unless you actually are dead and don’t need sustenance, skipping meals is a terrible idea. Food is great. Food is awesome, and I know for a fact that the soup is fantastic. Today is chicken noodle soup, Anne told me so this morning.”
“No, I need to get back to work.” Harry stood with him. “I’ll come by when we close to look at those books.”
“Yes! I’ll see you on Monday.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “When I was little, my hair was so messy—” Five pairs of eyes flicked to his hair. “I know, it’s still messy. But I lived with my aunt and uncle and they didn’t like that it was messy. So every day I had to comb my hair, but it never worked because my hair has a magic all of its own and it likes to be messy, you see. So one day my aunt decided to cut all my hair off because then it wouldn’t be messy anymore.”
“Yes, thank you.” Malfoy looked like himself again, all collected and polite and distant.
“Not you?”
“Really?” Malfoy’s gaze landed on Harry, heavy and hopeful.
“We broke up a couple of months ago,” Harry explained, looking after Ginny as well. “I guess she’s still getting used to me being with someone else. Let’s go.”
Harry quietly put his shoes and cloak away, found the take-out menus, and put in an order for their usual at the Vietnamese place.
Harry narrowed his eyes at him. “Why did you recommend it to me?”
“Certificates? Er, those are kind of personal. They’re not on public file,” Harry said. He wished he could say yes, if only to keep Draco at the Archive for longer. He’d got used to seeing him practically every day, and if he didn’t need the Archive’s resources anymore, then…Harry felt like he’d slip away.
There was no way Harry was going to be able to focus in his lecture.
floors? With kids running around the place?” Harry scuffed at the dirt floor with his shoe.
“Yes, Potter?”
Ginny’s eyes followed the book, then flicked up to meet Harry’s. Her eyes were clear, even if red from crying, and there was a strange light in them, a kind of resolve and wonder. “You’re friends now, then?”
She let go, so he let go, and then she was out the door.
Instead of dwelling on it, Harry resolved to buy a book as soon as the opportunity arose. Which kind of book it would be he hadn’t really figured out yet. Maybe it would be a book about Quidditch. Maybe non-fiction of a different kind; Neville was putting out a revised and updated book of some kind about herbs in some context or other. Maybe he’d read it. Maybe he would pick fiction, if only he knew what kind of fiction he’d like to read.
“I do wonder why Muggles keep writing books about the evils of technology,” Draco said, eyebrow quirked. “It’d be like…if we wrote books about the evils of magic. It’s…unthinkable.”
Harry pushed his hurt aside, curious. “What do you mean, people like you?”
It turned out that a few of the kids needed reminding which position to play, but soon they were on their brooms and playing. They did better this time than the second, likely because it helped that Anthony wasn’t missing Bludgers anymore, now that Emma was on the task and he was free to chase the Snitch.
Draco could’ve suggested eating dirt and it would’ve sounded marvellous. “Yes! Perfect. Tea sounds fantastic. Can I kiss you again?”
“You were keeping tabs on me?” Draco gave him an incredulous look. “That’s just creepy.”
And now they’d be facing Candy Cranes again. The other semi-final game was Fishes versus Dragonriders—and if Butterfly Bumpkins proceeded to the finals, it was 50:50 who they’d compete against.
“It’s still empty,” she said. “Because you still don’t know what to put in it.”
“Okay,” Ginny said, eventually. “I’ll do it.”
“Okay.” Harry regarded her. She looked the same as she always did, if a little jittery. Probably not having second thoughts, then. “Are you okay?”
He nodded, straightening up in his chair. Made eye contact. “Okay,” he said.
was attractive, but he’d been gearing up for it all week. He wasn’t going to back out now. “I—I don’t know what to think of the whole thing, but I think I’m willing to see what happens.”
), about ordinary things (
Harry perked up at this. “Have you tried a bath bomb?”
“I asked first.” Malfoy’s eyes looked wild, his shoulders were stiff—the pencil had stopped, clutched in his left hand. He looked like a cornered animal.
“Here!” A little girl with curly hair raised her hand.
“He’s quiet,” Harry eventually said. “But he has interesting things to say. I like talking to him.”
“No.” Ginny turned on him. “You can go to the fucking pub if you want to, but I’m going home.” She didn’t wait for him to respond, only slid her wand out of her sleeve, picked up her gear bag, and Disapparated, leaving Harry alone in the foyer of the club.
“Thank you,” Harry said, watching as the kids attempted to repeat the exercise after them. Lots of Quaffles were dropped, but they were doing their best.
“It’s Peony. I don’t go by any of those names anymore,” she responded, awkward and hesitant. “I’m sorry—I’d just appreciate it if you just called me that. P works as well.”
“Oh,” Harry said, again. The spinning in his chest intensified. “Okay—thank you!”
HELP RAISE KIDS TO SEE THE GOOD IN EACH OTHER AND THEMSELVES AND BECOME KIND PEOPLE, he wrote at the bottom of the page.
“Harry! How goes life?” Dean saluted him.
“Yup. It’s a happy one. Always puts me in a good mood.” Harry directed him to the appropriate pile. He watched as Draco, barely controlling his excitement, turned the colourful bath bomb over in his hands, sniffing it and studying the label. “It makes the water look like a galaxy,” Harry told him. “All colourful and sparkly. Until it all gets mixed together in the end, but there’s a lot of glitter and it smells really good.”
George came over, having loitered nearby waiting on Lee. “Did I hear the word ‘babysit’?” He grinned at both of them. “Are you going to be our
The selection in Flourish and Blotts was overwhelming. Harry only vaguely recalled it having been so in general; he hadn’t stepped foot in there since last time he’d had to get textbooks and that had always been during the back-to-school rush, so it’d been overwhelming for different reasons. Now the school season was in full swing, so the store wasn’t actually chock full of students and parents trying to get copies of
that many of my friends turned out this way…but I
“What happened? You look awful. Have you been crying?” Ginny reached for him, concerned, and Harry winced, taking a step back.
“I don’t care either way. I just don’t get why you’d want to when the weather is like this.”
Harry had been one of the first people on trial.
Ron was already in the office, legs slung up on the desk. He was slurping soup from a take-out container. “Mate,” he said. “You have something you want to share?”
Malfoy’s cheeks pinked ever so slightly, and then Harry held the door. A gust of wind stirred up Malfoy’s hair as he passed through and he waited while Harry locked the door behind him. “I’m sure you have other plans,” Malfoy said.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked again, but this time he meant something else entirely.
“Oh—yeah, it was just, there was nothing else happening but them falling in love,” Harry said. “There was no…world-saving plot or anything. Just the two of them falling in love and having lots of sex and, I dunno, it was just boring. I wanted there to be other things too, like, like that book with the detective and the magician, they were working together to save England’s magic, but were also obviously falling in love on the side, you know? I liked that. But instead there’s just this witch and wizard and they do nothing but fall in love, and…” Harry trailed off, not sure how to articulate himself beyond ‘and it was boring’ for the third time.
destroyed, everything from homes to bridges to Hogwarts to businesses. We broke it, so we fixed it.”
“Okay. If you have questions later, I’ll be at the service desk out front. If nobody is there, you can ring the bell and either I or one of my colleagues will come.” Harry didn’t receive a reply to this—aside from a perfunctory nod—so he left Malfoy to his documents and went back to the service desk.
It was unfair, because Harry’s throat had tied itself into a knot, and his eyes were burning. “I know,” he said. It was unfair, because he wanted things too, and here Ginny was making it out like he was the only one who couldn’t, didn’t, wouldn’t—
“Yes, exactly!” Harry’s gut flooded hot and bright. “It was—there were several aspects to it, and it took almost the entire book until the mechas could reach that point of, of, vulnerability, that point of no return, and after, they were both changed. In the literal, physical, sense, I guess, because the data sharing meant some code got rewritten and they were different, but also—they finally understood each other. That’s when the war stopped.”
Dean took the card. “The Jamaican Kitchen? That place is really difficult to get into!” He looked at Gilliam. “Your
“What? No.” Harry glanced at Rhosyn, who was pretending not to be watching them. “I boxed up the rest of your stuff last weekend so you can come pick it up. Did you want the chest of drawers? Wasn’t that your grandfather’s? And the bed is actually yours—”
“Er.” Harry shrugged.
Malfoy sniffed it. “I recognise this scent. You smell like this sometimes.” He looked at the label. “That’s…an eclectic mixture of ingredients. I can’t tell if it’s supposed to be refreshing or relaxing?”
“What if I was thinking about you?”
He’d…do something about that, soon. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t object to lunch?
Outside, the sun was shining and it was an unseasonably warm day—it was only March, but it almost felt like summer. Aside from the wind, which nipped at Harry’s cheeks and ruffled Draco’s hair. It was almost sparkly in the sun, fine and pale as it was.
“You, go sit in that corner, and you, go sit in the other corner. Stay there until I come back. Do not look at each other, do not speak to each other and do not move. No tricks, understand?” Harry said to them, rather more sharply than he intended to. Hugh’s lip started wobbling, but he went to sit. So did Betty.
“I meant—”
When he finally emerged from the strongroom with Malfoy’s documents, he felt calmer. He’d spelled the mud off his cloak while the platform transported him back upstairs and paused to drop it off behind the desk. His hair was a lost cause, as usual.
“Mate!” Ron rose to greet him, thumping him on the back. “I heard about the Little League! That’s brilliant.”
Harry found a crumpled paper napkin in a pocket. He tapped it with his wand and multiplied it. They were all of them snotty from crying, and Harry set to work on the nearest child, wiping tears and noses. “Is anyone hurt?” he asked, expecting sprained wrists and bruises, at least. “Knee scrapes? How are your arms? Does everyone still have their heads?”
“If you’re going to be like that I’m leaving,” Harry said, getting up. He only went to the bar, however, and ordered himself a pint of the house IPA.
Was this the real Draco Malfoy or had he been replaced with a replica that looked like him, but was otherwise completely unrecognisable?
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Ah, yes. Thank you.”
Peony was silent.
“I just want to know you,” Harry continued. “Like—what do you do all day? I mean. You’ve never told me, what do you actually…spend your time doing? I know you’re not working, and you don’t come to the Archive anymore, so…I’m, like, super busy all the time and I hardly think you just sit around all day waiting for me.”
category, which was a dumb, undefinable category with a host of uncomfortable connotations attached to it.
, Harry?”
“Sorry.” Harry blinked, looking away. The back of his neck was hot with embarrassment. “Sorry. I just didn’t expect…why?”
Harry had never realised Malfoy was left-handed before. “Like a friend,” he eventually said. His heart dropped, hope with it, making Harry think maybe he should’ve picked the other option. Though really—Harry had wanted to be
“Yes?” Harry was reaching for the ex libris list, but paused.
“About time you figured that out,” Padma commented. “You and Ginny were starting to get really painful to watch.”
Malfoy had a far-away look in his eyes. “I don’t suppose you have anything recent?”
He found Dudley in London. There was a phone number and an address in Camden. It had to be him; there weren’t many Dudleys, by Harry’s reckoning, and definitely not of the Dursley kind. He copied the information onto a scrap of paper and made his way to the nearest payphone.
, he’d said, voice dripping with anger.
“Okay, uhm…” Harry noticed that Draco hadn’t touched his food yet either. “So does all this mean that you’re not breaking up with me?”
Malfoy looked up. “Meringue?”
Another thing that was true was this: something had to change. He knew this, but—as Ginny had observed—he was waffling about that too.
“It might.” Ginny gave them another once over. “You look good. I—I’ve got to go. See you later, Harry. Draco.”
“Dude, I don’t even know,” Harry said, sliding into the booth. “I feel like I’m running head first towards…dragons, probably.” He took a large sip of the ale.
“You do know how dates work, right?” Malfoy frowned.
Harry didn’t have any further interactions with Malfoy that day; Malfoy slipped out before closing while Harry was busy helping one of the other researchers: an elderly witch who was looking into her family tree to try to locate some cousins that’d gone to the Continent during the First War. He wasn’t certain how he felt about it—Malfoy and the botched attempt at socialising with him, that was, not the witch—but had no opportunity to try again, or say something different, or just lay eyes on Malfoy and reassure himself that everything was probably fine.
“That’s quite all right,” Malfoy said, but he had that formal, polite tone back in his voice. He hovered there for just a moment too long, as if he didn’t know what to do next.
Draco smiled. It was amazing, really, how Draco’s smile, when directed at him like this, all warm and soft and happy and loving, could make Harry’s insides feel.
. PCD manifests as one or more of the following: deep sadness, anger, aggression, not wanting to be touched, depression, feeling emotionless, anxiety, agitation, irritability, a desire to be left alone. When an individual experiences symptoms of PCD they typically do not feel any contentment, closeness or other positive feelings towards their sexual partner(s), that usually occur after sex (regardless of whether orgasm was achieved or not).
Ginny didn’t hesitate.
“Same thing,” Lee announced cheerfully, shaking Draco’s hand across the table. “I’ll get us drinks, loves. Anyone else want a refill?”
“All right.” Harry tried to clear his mind of all this debris, focusing instead on Draco’s mouth, his eyes, the pointy tip of his nose. “I wanted to ask you about another date or something. Not that I don’t love these chats—” Draco raised an eyebrow at that “—but I want to see you when I’m not at work, too.”
“I—yeah. I haven’t seen your place at all, but you’re here all the time. I’m stupidly curious about if you have any pictures on your walls and what’s in your fridge, if you even have a fridge, or what colour your sheets are.” He still didn’t really know where Draco lived, either. With his mum, he knew, but not
It was just as well that Harry didn’t see Draco on Tuesdays, being at the daycare all day and then at the College in the evening; his one single therapy session with Gladys Oakland had done a number on his head. It’d also left him exhausted, and it was all he could do to keep up with the kids—Betty and Hugh had got into a fight over the bats and by the time Harry had successfully managed to separate them, Hugh had angry red scratches on his face and Betty had a split lip.
“My other job,” Harry clarified. “I forgot to tell you that, didn’t I? Here.” He still had both Valentines in a pocket somewhere. He dug them up and showed them to Malfoy. “We made Valentines yesterday. You can have one if you like.”
Harry had the weird feeling of being back in class. “Well I dunno, his sort-of-fiancée left him, and his parents died, and his friends didn’t want to speak with him…” The mate had picked himself up and married and lived a modest, but happy life, and Edwarde had had his riches, but no one to share them with. “He wound up alone.”
“Hmmm,” Harry said, seriously. They were all standing in a circle around the grounded broomsticks, Charlie and Alice fidgeting, while Avery, Betty and Hugh were trading looks. “I see the problem,” he said. “Yes, it’s very serious indeed.”
“Yeah.” Malfoy sipped his tea. “Well, when I completed my sentence, I decided…to continue. More or less. Both sides of my family are old blood, old money, but I think you’ve actually got what’s left of the Black properties? Sole male heir and all. Anyway, my Dad’s family had a lot of land and estates, and a lot of it had been sitting empty and abandoned for a long time. I found out many of the properties had only been abandoned during the First War…many of the tenants had been Muggleborns, Half-bloods, blood traitors, what will you, enemies of the Dark Lord. Some of our tenants were actual Muggles. They were murdered.”
“Trust that the other person would still like you after seeing all your ugly parts,” Malfoy agreed. “And the reverse, accepting and loving the other person even after seeing all
He needed to
“Potter?”
“Oi, lovebirds,” Seamus said, cutting through Harry’s thoughts. “Any chance you can help me talk sense into this fool?”
had a kind of appeal to it. A potential for satisfaction.
Coffee, he determined, after a quick sniff test. Never mind that that beverage and other liquids weren’t allowed in the reading hall; people would find ways to sneak them in past the magical barriers anyway.
“I want to,” Harry said.
see Malfoy again, he told himself; Malfoy would come back to the Archive, continue his research. He’d get another chance to make friends with him.
Ron and Hermione shared another look.
Sooner or later Harry would get to see his home, he was sure. When he was ready to take Harry there, probably, or for some other reason. It didn’t matter. Well, not entirely—Harry had the spare key to his own flat in his pocket, the key that had once been Ginny’s. He’d nearly given it to Draco on the weekend already; he’d been so delighted to have him there, in his kitchen, making food. Draco’s pleased smile when Harry had liked the meal, and the soft kisses he’d let Harry sneak…it all added up to a certainty that, well, that Harry was definitely beyond the point of no return.
Hugh just sniffled. “I don’t want to play Quidditch today,” he said, tears welling up afresh.
Draco’s hands were cradling his cup of tea—his fingers looked stiff and uncomfortable and had to be scalding from the heat of the tea. Harry realised that despite his easy way of speaking, Draco must be deeply anxious still.
“Come on,” Harry muttered, palms sweaty. Next to him Ginny was shouting something at Rachel, who was currently playing as a Chaser. On his other side Love was screaming and swinging her bat, spitting with frenzy.
“Oh, hello.” Harry fastened his cloak in front. “I thought you’d left already.”
Well, sort of. Draco hadn’t colonised Harry’s wardrobe or anything, but he did have a toothbrush in the bathroom, and even if he didn’t sleep over every night—Draco usually opted for Flooing home, and some days he never came over to begin with, like on Tuesdays and most Fridays.
“I gave you the benefit of the doubt,” Harry eventually said. “I gave your mother the benefit of the doubt. I—” He swallowed. “I won’t say that it made all the difference. Just that it made a difference for me.”
Draco considered this. Then he dropped it in.
“Are you listening to yourself? Bloody hell, Harry, what’s your damage? Why are you like this?”
Harry had a busy afternoon at the Archive, as the grad student in the office next to Malfoy’s needed help deciphering some medieval manuscripts, a task that was, frankly, way above Harry’s paygrade. If he got into the archivist course he’d have the option of taking Medieval Palaeography but until then, those manuscripts were as much a mystery to him as…mysterious things, such as the existence of hiccups.
A warm hand settled on the back of Harry’s neck. “I know,” Draco murmured. “You might never. But so long as you continue to choose to see the good in the world instead of the bad, I think you’ll be all right. That’s the hardest choice of them all, and yet it’s the one that comes to you the easiest.”
“Right,” Malfoy said, again.
Let him be wet and cold and miserable. He deserved it.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “No, you didn’t. Anyway, so, this daycare of yours…you want to lead them to victory and overdose the lot on chocolate?”
“Uh, yeah. Sometimes. I don’t have trouble sleeping or anything, but sometimes I’m just…in a bad mood? Or tired but frustrated, or something, and just need to relax before going to bed, or maybe I’m not even in a bad mood but just want to relax anyway, and then this one is good for that, because it’s all calm.” Harry was definitely rambling now. “It’s soothing.”
“Well, yeah,” Ginny said. “I always love seeing you fall on your face. I'll make us some tea?” She was already heading into the kitchen as if she'd never left, and Harry’s heart sped up irrationally. He followed her in. She didn't make it far, however. “Uhm.” She was staring into the cupboard she’d opened.
“After the game,” Harry said. “Uh. Do you want to come? You don’t have to,” he added, his fingertips—now at Draco’s lips—tingling with nerves. What was he doing meeting his cousin? Why was that a good idea?
—into something practical and beautiful. Things like decorative trimmings, furniture, ceilings, staircase banisters…”
“In or near Soho,” Harry said. “I don’t actually know for sure. I don’t spend much time in Muggle London. This way.” The store was just around the corner. “So…you don’t want to die anymore?”
“Okay.” Draco paused uncertainly by the front desk, manned by Mildred today, and turned to face Harry. “If that’s all…”
“Yes.” Draco left.
gets it!” he said to Seamus.
Falling in love was a strange feeling: a pain that couldn’t be classified or quantified or described. Sometimes it didn’t even feel like pain at all, but like a kind of bliss, bubbly and perky and boiling hot.
“Yes, I suppose I can.” Malfoy carefully closed the report he’d been looking at, then put it back in the trolley. He then tore a page out of his notebook and wedged it in between the report he’d just returned and the one before it, taking care that it stuck out visibly.
“Pull the string.” Harry showed him a concealed bell string near the desk. “That’ll ring a bell backstage—actually, these days it’s a lamp, not a bell, and it’ll stay lit until I turn it off—and I’ll come to you. I’m assigned to you and three others, so if I’m not there right away chances are I’m helping somebody else, but I’ll be with you as soon as I can.”
“Not much, really. Just asked when I’d be bringing you round.”
“Ohh, nice. Have fun! And good luck with the boyfriend! I hope he likes the book!” Lisa gave Harry the book in a small paper bag. “The receipt is in the bag.”
“All right.”
“It was
“Just okay?” Draco frowned.
“Murder boy got enough of the murders?” Mildred asked cheerfully. “Oh, now, no need to look so glum. He’ll be back before you know it.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he didn’t say anything at all.
“Why?” Malfoy finally took the cards, then looked inside them.
They looked at each other, a lot of unspoken things hanging in the air between them. Rhosyn was waiting behind Ginny, and Harry…he wanted to go home and continue reading about gay robots having mind-meld sex in space. And then talk to Malfoy about it.
Lee shrugged. The girls smiled.
“That’s the spirit!” George, sitting on the other side of Percy, bumped his shoulder. “His consolation prize can wait, honestly.” He waggled his eyebrows and Percy rolled his eyes at him, cheeks slightly pink.
“You can borrow them for as long as you’d like,” Malfoy said quietly, almost inaudibly.
“I had a crush on Cho,” Harry corrected, annoyance rising up in him. His eyes were no longer burning, but his throat still felt rotten and now he was arguing about…what? His sexual orientation? As far as he was concerned, he probably didn’t actually have one, because it’d likely died when he’d died. Back in the forest, all those years ago now. Only he’d come back, and it hadn’t.
be fine,” Malfoy said. “You look like I just kicked a puppy. Honestly, Potter. It’s just a book.”
He paired them off two and two and gave each pair a Quaffle. “What I want you to do is race from this line here,” Harry drew a line in the snow with the toe of his boot, “to that line there,” he pointed at the line he’d marked out earlier. “You start on opposite sides. The one with the Quaffle has to pass it to their partner when they pass each other, make it to the other line, turn around, and then receive the Quaffle when their partner passes it back to them….do you know what I mean?”
“Thank you.” Harry leaned in to kiss her. “Do you know more people with five-year-olds who would like to play for chocolate?”
It was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? He didn’t have to accept her apologies, but he could acknowledge that she’d made them, that she was trying. Even if what he wanted most was to make petty, cruel remarks—
She just shrugged, as if to say she didn’t care, but the look on her face told a different story.
“See something you like?” she asked.
“Hey,” Harry said, offering to take her bag. She let him. “Let’s take the tube home? I want to talk to you about something.”
in one—without even having
“Are you mad, Mr Harry?” Betty asked. She and Hugh were sitting side by side, not looking at each other, but also avoiding looking at Harry.
Harry cracked a smile. “Sure, Lee.” He shrugged with one shoulder. “I still don’t have a team so don’t get your hopes up.”
“Mmh,” Draco assented. “What’d you have in mind?”
The three of them nodded solemnly. Harry gave them a Quaffle.
“Hullo,” Harry said, as he parked the trolley. “How can I help you?”
At the front desk, Harry tapped the ex libris list with his wand and flagged the documents that’d been taken out of the trolley during the day and saw that Malfoy had made his way through three hundred and sixty-four of the reports. Impressive. Harry then transferred the information to a new request form, deleted the flagged items, and gave Malfoy the form.
“Okay,” she said. She hesitated. “Did he…not want to?”
“I wasn’t going to comment,” said Malfoy, with a smile. “But since you brought it up, why don’t you?”
“I’ll buy you one,” Harry said, catching up with him. “Do you want it?”
Harry made it into the kitchen without fainting (a useful skill to have; thanks a lot, Aunt Petunia) and made toast. He had jam on his toast, a lovely blackcurrant and lime preserve with star anise that Draco’s mum had made last summer, and as Harry slowly munched through it, with the taste of sun-ripe berries on his tongue, the light-headedness went away.
“Oh, fuck you.”
I always knew that this day would come. Mother had warned me almost as soon as she discovered that I had Fallen. If I thought I’d ever get to this point, I had hoped that it would happen when I was both mentally and physically prepared. When I had a room with my family’s MediWitches and dozens of potions. Of course, hope fails you a lot of the time, and I shouldn’t have even thought about the ideal conditions. Because this falls drastically short.
“Merry Christmas,” he murmurs instead, turning his gaze up to look at Harry.
“Harry, this one’s for you,” Mr Weasley says, passing over a present from the massive pile to him.
“Not weak! Malfoys aren’t weak!”
He sighs. He hates this part of investigations, going through crime scenes and trying to figure things out. That’s normally something someone else does for him, but he’s alone in this. He’s the only one that’s on this case, and no one can jump in and help him. Harry moves his gaze upwards to the canopy, watching for any gap in the trees. There is a small one a bit to his left, but he recognises it as the clearing from Saturday. His thoughts try to turn back to the strange gathering, but he forces it away. That’s a separate thing, not at all relevant in finding Malfoy right now.
Harry snarls but decides it isn’t worth it. He holds his hand out, nudging Malfoy with it. Malfoy just looks at it like it’s a disease.
Now, what was he doing?
“What? Sorry, no I didn’t,” Harry says, pulling a face.
“Har-Harry,” he stutters as a jolt goes through him. Harry hums in response. “Stop. Stop.”
“You need to come, don’t you?” Draco asks, voice like honey.
“Wait. What did you want me to do?” She asks, less than ten seconds after I told her. I sigh inwardly, and tell her, once again, that she needs to dice the Ginger Roots into fine pieces.
He groans as Draco somehow aligns his thigh to press into his cock. Harry sees stars at the pressure in just the right spot, his mouth slipping off the nipple. Draco rocks his thigh across him, rubbing circles until Harry’s panting with it. He pushes Draco away after a second though, forcing himself to wait. There’s time for that later. Now is for Draco.
“I slept on the couch last night though!”
*~*~*~
An hour and a lovely shower later, Draco and Harry are leaving the cottage. The path is totally clear of snow now, and Draco wonders when they might get some again. He’s always loved snow at Christmas, even though it can get really annoying if not taken care of properly. Judging by Harry’s face, he feels the same way.
“Potter. Harry Potter. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Draco.”
“But what if they aren’t?”
“Technically it’s the basement, but the kitchen’s there too.” Potter has the sense to look sheepish at the fact that his kitchen is revolting and grimy, so I decide I’ll do as he wishes and look somewhere else.
“It’s not my fault ‘Mione!” Ron is saying now.
Harry hadn’t thought about that. “Why would anyone want
Draco slips in fully, water covering him up to his neck. He doesn’t really care if his hair gets wet, but he’d rather not dry it twice in the same day. Wizarding hair drying methods always dry his hair out slightly
“Because it simply can’t be true,” I state, staring into her eyes so she sees my sincerity. “Nothing will ever happen, because it can’t. We are on other sides of this war.”
“What have I done to Potter?!”
Harry sighs and paces around the bedroom. He’d slept in the bed again last night, deciding that it wasn’t likely Malfoy would be back before he got to sleep. He was correct, but he wishes he wasn’t. Something must have happened. No. That’s ridiculous. Malfoy is a highly trained, highly skilled Unspeakable. If he
Draco’s breath catches. His eyes widen and a smile creeps over his face. “I’d love that,” he murmurs, scared if he says it too loud it will shatter the moment.
Draco laughs as that was probably meant to be the incentive for them to get back quickly, but gets up and
As our little party arrives to the bend where the wrought-iron gates come into view, we come to a halt and duck behind a group of trees.
“And why on earth would I want a repeat,
Draco chuckles at that. “Me too, but it’s not so bad. Funny, more than ugly.”
“Malfoy?!” Potter calls from the landing. Speak of the devil. Or, the
Once they go back around to join his mother, he pulls the canvas for her out of his robe pockets, bringing it back to its original size. He turns it so she can’t see it, and opens his gift first.
Draco rolls his eyes, but his lips curve into a fond smile that does nothing to hide his emotions. Perfect.
“Yes, thank you,” Harry says, folding up his menu and then reaching across for Draco’s. Draco let’s him take it, and watches as he passes them to the waitress.
“Morning,” Potter mumbles as he shuffles into the living room. Draco looks up at him and frowns. He’s shaking just as much as Draco, bumps risen all over his arms and what’s visible of his chest. Potter seems to blush under the stare, and Draco looks back to his hot chocolate. He lifts it to his lips and takes his first mouthful, only just refraining from spitting it back out when it burns his mouth.
“I don't see why on earth you would want to dance with
Harry sighs, hands massaging his thighs to bring feeling back into them. His breath forms a cloud in the air, white and cold. That is so not normal; he’s probably freezing from the inside out then, at the same time as outside in. Maybe the two layers of freezing flesh will meet in the middle to finish him off sooner? Harry shakes his head, that is an
He heaves a sigh of relief as he hands them over and pays. His shopping is complete, and he can finally find Harry and go home. Shrinking the newest bag and sliding it into his pocket, Draco makes his way back to the water fountain.
That causes a reaction. Draco halts, his breath catching. His heartbeat skyrockets under Harry’s fingers, and he nods emphatically.
Her eyes widen, the grey lightening into silver as she examines the painting. She lifts a finger, tracing it carefully over the paint. Draco’s glad he added the extra wards onto
Draco grins back.
Harry’s cock is beautiful. It’s so thick Draco can imagine it splitting himself in half, and decently long enough. There’s a circle of trimmed hair around the base, and all Draco wants to do is bury his face in it.
The stands are slowly filling, the light sun shining onto the crowd. Clouds float somewhere in between sky and space, creating small patches of shadow. The audience is relatively quiet, but that could just be because of where the teams are standing. Both Gryffindor and Slytherin are gathered inside a tent, magically extended of course, sitting in circles talking and stretching. The rest of my team in fairly anxious to do well in this game, but I’m not worried at all. I know that our team is better than Potter’s, and I’m not afraid to tell the others this. We have trained so hard this term, and that the Gryffindor team has had to miss a lot of practises. Shifting schedules and bad weather have clashed with most of their sessions. When I told my team this, they just asked how I knew and then decided it would be best to just ignore what I’d said. I told them that Potter had brought it up during Defence Against the Dark Arts when we were working on our assignment. That’s not how I know though. The truth is I followed Potter to practise, hiding in the trees. I was curious to see what his team was like, and thought ‘why not?’ So I watched the whole practise. I observed the three Chasers (played by Sixth Year Demelza Robins, Ginny Weasley, and Dean Thomas) diving and swooping along the pitch. Weasley was playing Keeper, and doing a pretty bad job of it, just like always. The role of Beater was filled in with Ritchie Coote and a Fifth Year named Edna Andsell. Of course, there was no surprise who the Seeker was. Potter rose above the team, shouting instructions and sweeping his gaze over the pitch. His fit, lean body flying over everyone else’s, eyes scanning their movements and for the coveted Snitch.
“I’d rather give you a gift, I think,” Harry murmurs, pressing a kiss to the top of Draco’s head. His hands slide into his hair, playing with the strands and making Draco sigh in contentment. He loves his hair being played with, and he’d be more than happy to sit here all day.
“Calm down, you haven’t done anything wrong,” Harry says, shifting so he’s facing Draco.
“What is it? It smells amazing,” Draco says, placing his bookmark between the pages and setting it on the coffee table.
Harry shakes his head. “No, I can never beat him. He’s a genius at it.”
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” Harry says, voice still soft. “I just thought it might help lift some weight off your chest.”
,” Harry starts.
Malfoy’s smile drops off his face. “But I’m injured Potter. And I have a fever!”
“I’m sure he would if Dean let him anywhere near one!” Potter grins. “As it is, anything flammable is kept well away from him.”
“I know some of you did learn this charm in Seventh Year like you were supposed to, but the majority of you never did. Now, if you would like to flick open your textbooks to the page marked on the board, we will start reading about Augmenti.”
Potter backs out of the room, flicking his wand and sending the empty flask and glass floating out after him.
“I can’t hear anything from my end, meaning he’s not activated the spell yet. So, I can’t be sure.”
Of course, that’s not what Harry finds at all.
Weasley sighs. “Look. I know this is a difficult time in your life. And you may, um, be questioning some things. But I want you to know that I understand.”
~~~~~~~~
Harry suddenly shifts away, moving back. Draco’s head snaps up, his leg growing cold with the absence of Harry’s.
Harry Potter though. The Aurors might have no choice in whether or not to look for him, him being the “Saviour” and all that rubbish. God, that’s what Malfoy calls him. He’s spent too much time around the prat.
“Oh Merlin. How did I not think of this?!” He uses his wand to cast a Patronus Charm, before speaking to it carefully. He tells it to go and retrieve Granger for him, and to tell her to open the Common Room door to let him in. I notice that he doesn’t mention me, but I don’t care.
Harry closes the door with a bang, locks it with a standard charm, and flees back to the living room. He is panting by the time he sits back on the couch, all thoughts of processing and relaxation long gone. His mind races alongside his heart, and images flash to the forefront of his mind. All of them featuring a naked Malfoy, expanses of pale skin, and hands moving slowly. Harry’s blood warms and moves around his body, draining from every available limb and flooding to his cock. It fills quickly, and Harry bites his lip to hold in a groan.
Draco wakes up warm, the duvet on the bed drooping down at his waist. He settles into the covers further, getting comfortable. Light streams in through the bedroom window, bathing him in gold. Purple and red swirl together behind his eyelids, and he sighs in the warmth.
Harry smiles softly as we kiss, gentle caresses with our lips. He pulls away, his smile fading.
Once the puzzle is finally finished—and although Draco was very annoyed at the picture originally—it is actually quite beautiful. The cottage has a dusting of snow on the roof, and the trees around it are capped with white. It’s gorgeous, even if Draco still kind of wants to set it on fire. One thousand pieces is very big and took a lot of energy, so setting it on fire would be rather counterproductive. Levitating it carefully to the coffee table perched at the end of the bed, he stretches the kinks out of his neck and back. One side of his neck cracks in an extremely satisfying, yet disgusting manner, and he hums contentedly. Time may have passed quite quickly while working on the puzzle, but his stomach doesn’t seem too happy about skipping lunch. After stretching and putting the feeling back into his legs, Draco undoes the many locking charms on the door and starts down the hallway.
Draco watches wide-eyed as Harry lies down in the water. His boyfriend floats to the surface and bobs there, casually drifting on the waves. Harry closes his eyes and grins when he feel Draco drop down next to him. Green waves bring the boys up and down, up and down, just like a mother’s cradle. The comforting, calm rocking that is the ocean when you submit yourself to it.
“I can try, I guess.”
Harry can’t hear much of what’s being said, but the people watching seem to enjoy the speech. He presses closer, trying to listen in without being caught. This many people—nine, ten?—in uniform robes is not usually a good thing, especially since they aren’t work robes he’s seen anywhere before and the people definitely aren’t children. As he ducks behind a tree and closes his eyes in order to listen, he manages to grasp some of what’s being said.
“Oh, don’t worry! That’s your human stats, not your angel ones.”
Draco screws his nose up and clips his wand into its holster on his waist. “I’m going to go find shelter somewhere,” he says, avoiding Potter’s gaze.

Granger nods, releasing a slow breath. “I think I’ve found someone,” she whispers.
Harry moves over to the bookshelf, shuffling through the books. He wonders how many of these Malfoy has read. There are quite a few, but most of them feature straight relationships, and he said he wasn’t interested in those. At the bottom of the bookshelf, he finds a puzzle box. Intrigued by the lack of an image on the outside, he opens it. It’s empty. He scowls. Harry loves puzzles. They get his brain working in a different way and they don’t take much thinking at all. Well, he likes them until he gets stuck. Then he hates them. Shaking his head, he puts the lid back on the box and slots it back into the bookshelf.
“It’s really good,” Malfoy replies, “but you didn’t answer my question.”
She stops just short of me and scowls. “Hey, Malfoy.” Her voice is gravelly and raucous, and she is clearly annoyed at me.
“Have you been doing this all day?” Potter asks curiously.
Harry, no Potter, takes a confident step forwards and is less than an arm’s reach away from me.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, I haven’t.”
flowers, so he doesn’t say anything.
Draco’s breath catches. “I was just wondering the same thing!” He laughs.
“‘Callum and Ryan walk down the beach, their toes squishing into the sand beneath them. Their hands entangle and clasp together as they stare at the sunset, and Ryan can’t believe they finally have this.’ Jesus, this is so awful Malfoy. It’s not even written well!” Harry teases. Malfoy starts to argue, but Harry cuts him off. “‘He turns to Ryan and looks into his eyes, seeing where his future is supposed to be reflected in the green of Ryan’s iris. He opens his mouth to say something, but Ryan closes his mouth over Callum’s.’ This is so trashy Malfoy.”
The fire dissipates after a tense few seconds, leaving behind ash in varying colours of blue. Wind blows said ash away, and Harry wants to scream. Once again though, Draco holds up a commanding hand. What’s left of the ash rises back into the air, floating a foot above the ground. And then the edges curve, rising further at the edges until it forms the shape of a bowl.
