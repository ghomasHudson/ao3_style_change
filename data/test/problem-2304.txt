Potter didn’t go to bed until well past midnight. Draco listened to him get ready in their cramped en-suite as he pretended to sleep. Part of him voted to go and confront him, get the truth, once and for all. The rest of him said to wait, to bide his time. The moment would come soon enough.
That same night, Harry decided to break some news to Draco. They sat at their kitchen table eating takeaway pizza after a long day of moving and unpacking – “How is there so much stuff in such a tiny flat? Why do you even own a
“How are you?” he forced himself to ask, to be polite. His voice was hoarse from disuse. He spent most days in silence, only ever talking to his mother or whichever friend decided to give him a pity Floo call. Potter rested his chin in his hand as he turned back to Draco. He could just glimpse the pale scrawl on the back of that hand, but he knew immediately what it was, what it said –
“Oh, I tried to bake a cake,” said Harry. He pointed at the heap of dishes in the sink with his spoon. “But I burnt it. So no dessert, I’m afraid, just dinner.”
Harry let out a soft chuckle, one hand coming up to cover Draco’s, which only served to make Draco’s knees shake. “We both know that’s not true. You wouldn’t kill a fly.”
Harry shook his head. “Bits and pieces, but only enough to ask where the toilet is, really. I’m shit at languages. What was all that about anyway?”
Ron frowned at him as they pulled up to the main house. It had once been a Georgian-era cottage, but over the generations had been added on until it became a mosaic of various and disparate architectural styles. Harry loved it. Unlike the pre-fabricated house his aunt and uncle lived in closer to the village centre, this house had been loved for a couple hundred years, and it showed. Ron parked the car, shaking his head.
The end of term was always a hectic time. Harry spent more time than ever out of their room. Between training and studying, he almost never saw Malfoy. So it was a surprise to both of them that, one Sunday, Harry came back to the room after breakfast and found Malfoy pacing back and forth, his phone pressed to his ear. Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly when he saw Harry, but otherwise continued to pace. When Harry caught his eye again, Harry gestured and mouthed, ‘What’s going on?’
Ron lowered his wand, his face pale. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, the muscle in his jaw jumping as he looked from Draco to Harry and back. He put his wand away and pointed a finger at them. “This isn’t over,” he growled. Then he turned, grabbing a pinch of Floo powder from the bowl on the mantle piece, and disappeared into the green flames.
“Truth or Dare,” said Padma. “It’s easy enough.” She explained the rules quickly. “Got it? Good. Here, I’ll go first. Luna, truth or dare?”
“Everything alright?” Harry asked. Malfoy pulled at the cuff of his silky ivy-green pyjamas and fixed his gaze on the patinaed door hinges. Harry frowned.
“Hello, Aunt Andromeda,” he said, voice soft. “It’s nice to finally meet you. Mother told me so much about you.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Kellen piped up. “I have to ask – do you want to press charges against Mr. Weasley – er, Mr. Granger-Weasley that is?”
The room grew quiet. The winter winds rattled the windows as the night settled in, the only light left in the room coming from the crackling fire. Draco held the pillow to his chest as he traced Harry’s features with his worried eyes. He leaned forward and stroked the crooked line of Harry’s nose with his finger. Harry gave him a confused, side-long look.
Draco propped himself up so that Harry could see him roll his eyes. “You are insatiable,” he told the grinning boy beneath him.
Harry scrambled to his feet, shoving his glasses back on. He backed away from Draco towards the open window. Draco stood and tried to reach for Harry, the concerned crease between his eyebrows deepening.
Draco gave Harry a weak, trembling smile. “I know,” he whispered. “But it still reminds me, every day, of everything I did to you.”
“What?” Malfoy glared at him, his expression thunderous. “What, you want to apologise? What you did was self-defence, I know that. Fuck, I
His eyes flicked from Hermione to Harry and Draco, then to Ron just behind them. Slowly, the realisation that he was outnumbered began to dawn on his face. He took a step back, his lip curling. He jabbed his finger over Hermione’s head at Harry. “This is not a war you can win, Mr. Potter, I can assure you of that,” he spat.
to go,” he said, pulling Draco against him. Draco exhaled sharply as he fell forward slightly into Harry’s arms. “We could just stay in.”
“Of course,” Draco murmured, pressing his lips to Harry’s forehead. “I’m off in a few hours. You going to be okay?”
Draco shook his head with a grin. “Oh no, I’m not breaking up with the Chosen One over something like that. The entire wizarding world would never let me live it down.” He set the mug to one side and crawled forward onto Harry’s lap, taking Harry’s face in his hands. “Besides,” he added, his voice low, “I can think of some other gifts you can give me that don’t even require clothes.”
He met someone. A man named Theo in his Forensic Science class. And for a few weeks, it was fun, it was great, he could pretend he was falling for him. Every night, though, he closed his eyes and saw a pale figure in a crisp white button-down and charcoal-coloured trousers, an angular face with soft grey eyes. After two months, Harry stopped returning Theo’s calls. He stopped going to clubs. His roommate, an eager boy named Colin that Harry couldn’t shake the feeling he had met before, only saw him leave their dorm to go to class, the gym, and the café down the road. The few friends he had made chalked it up to first year exam nerves. But when Ron met him at the rail station that summer, he could see the shadows under his friend’s eyes and he knew that something was wrong.
They sat in uncomfortable silence for too long. Draco’s throat had gone dry. All the words he had planned to say were gone. Instead, only three words ran on a loop in his head –
Draco rolled his eyes, but gave him a tired smile. “Prat,” he said, but there was no venom in the word, only sweet affection. Harry’s face was like a small sun for all the happiness it radiated. Ron, watching them, let out a ‘humph.’ Hermione frowned at her husband.
Draco looked down at his hands. At some point, ink had left black smudges on his fingers and on the side of his right hand, stains easily washed away. He rubbed at one of the smudges with a frown.
“Ron’s not coming,” Potter said as he stepped into the compartment, heaving his own luggage up into the overhead. “And McGonagall made Hermione Head Girl, so she’s off sorting out the prefects with Neville.” He flopped down into the seat next to the window opposite Draco, still with that lopsided smile on his stupid face. Draco scowled at him. The nerve. Hadn’t even asked Draco if he could sit with him. Although, as he looked Potter over – with his thick wild mop of black curls, the silvery scar that split across his coffee-coloured skin, the shadow of stubble on his strong jaw, the jauntily perched glasses on his crooked nose – maybe Draco didn’t mind so much.
This was madness, said the logical part of his brain. A misunderstanding. You heard what Potter said.
For several minutes, they sat next to each other in silence, Harry staring at the fireplace after Hermione and Draco at his blank wrist. Then Draco pushed himself to his feet and strode out of the kitchen into the back garden. He stood on the stone walkway, overgrown with grass and moss, and tilted his head back, staring at the clouds gathering dark and heavy above him, his hands shoved into his pockets. He took one deep breath, then another. The air was icy cold, and he could practically taste the rain on his tongue. He closed his eyes. Breathed.
That night, after a subdued dinner, after they had both gotten ready for bed, after Draco had gotten under the thin coverlet and Harry was making his way to his cot, Draco said, “You know, you can sleep with me, if you want.”
“Since Hallowe’en is on a Tuesday this year,” Hermione explained, her frizzy curls escaping from her bun, “the prefects thought that it would be fun for each Year Group to have a party in their common room to help build inter-House unity!”
The Ministry atrium was bustling with activity when they arrived, stepping out of the Floor and into the crowded space. Harry had to take a couple of steadying breaths. After spending almost a month locked away in his house with only Draco and a few others for company, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies around him. He glanced over at Draco. He only knew Draco felt the same by the tightness of his mouth, the flutter of his hands as he straightened his charcoal grey robes. Harry wished he could reach over and take his hand, give it a reassuring squeeze. Instead, he tugged at Draco’s sleeve. Panic flared briefly in his eyes when he turned to Harry, who gave him a small smile.
Malfoy continued, “But I told myself, hey, just hear this guy out. If he has the stuff, then this will be the last time you ever make anything with powdered Erumpent horn, you’ll just have to tell future clients that you can’t, end of story. I should have just stuck with that, I should have just told this client that it couldn’t be done, but listen, I need this business. My rent’s due in two weeks and I need at least a week to brew the potion before I send it to the client, and I just… I really can’t afford not to, you know? So I go in, Ivanovich was stood over there, he turns around, sees me, and then you lot show up and he bolts.”
Draco nodded. He wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him in close, burying his face against the top of Harry’s head. “Yeah,” he mumbled into Harry’s hair. “I’m okay.”
Harry set up the wards around the room before turning off the lights and trying to get comfortable on the cot bed. He didn’t trust his transfiguration abilities enough to make any adjustments. He remembered all the times he’d slept in a bed just like this one, but could not remember how he had ever fallen asleep on one.
Draco hesitated, but only for a moment. Harry’s hand was warm and calloused against his as he shook it. “Alright, then,” said Draco. “Hello. I’m Draco.”
Andromeda looked from Teddy to Harry and rolled her eyes. “You are a bad influence, Harry James Potter,” she said, pointing at him with a warning finger. Harry shrugged.
Narcissa, not missing a beat, frowned. “Draco, is there something you want to tell me?” she asked. Draco slumped in defeat. He turned to face his mother with a sigh.
Draco always made his bed with hospital corners, the white sheets taut over the thin mattress. His pillow was a deep green silk, a welcome contrast to the white. Harry let his fingers brush over the silk, relishing the soft touch. Draco’s desk, as always, was neat, his pens tidied and his textbooks in alphabetical order. He didn’t have any pictures of his family or his friends – instead, there were pictures of a countryside covered in lavender, of old buildings made of honey limestone, and of rocky beaches and the iron coloured sea beyond. A part of Harry wanted to pull open his drawers, peak inside the clean exterior, but he knew better. He knew better. And yet.
Draco’s laugh startled out of him. “Babe, I had to explain to someone why I couldn’t make a soy cappuccino today, and I hate that I even know why I can’t,” he said with a bemused smile. “Of course I’m not doing something I love. I’m doing something that pays the bills.”
Draco frowned. “No,” he said. “Although that is up there.” He shot Harry a teasing smile, just to let him know he was joking. Harry smiled back, his stomach suddenly soaring back up, giving him a nauseous form of whiplash. Then Draco’s smile faded, and he turned back to stir the pasta. He let out a long sigh. “I was going to say so I can bury my parents,” he said at last. Harry’s heart clenched as his smile fell. Oh.
Draco scoffed and said in a lofty tone, “If you’re asking if I’m gay, yes, Potter, I’m a pouf. Now if you could just keep that information to yourself, I would greatly appreciate it, ta.”
Draco pursed his lips to keep from smiling. He looked up at Potter though his lashes, calculating. “Let’s go for a walk, Potter.”
He could see it all. A letter written in green spidery ink, a giant of a man leading him down a bustling street, a dusty shop as a wizened old man handed him a wand made of holly, a castle ancient and familiar. A turban unravelling, a gilt mirror in a shadowy room, a blank diary with the name T.M. Riddle embossed in gold, a bloody fang. A gaunt man with matted hair, a flaming goblet, dragons and mermaids with rusted tridents, a boy dead at his feet. A toad-faced woman in horrifying shades of pink, rows upon rows of milky crystal balls, a behemoth of a snake, an old man with kind eyes and silver hair tumbling off a tall tower. A ring, a locket, a cup, a diadem, a sword at the bottom of a lake. Draco, kneeling before him, fear in his grey eyes as he said, “No, I can’t, I can’t be sure.” And always, always, a green light, blood red eyes, and a high, cold laugh.
It didn’t take long for everyone to get ridiculously drunk off of very little alcohol. The electric lantern they had brought cast strange shadows on the walls that swung and danced against the dark walls. They ran through the usual party games – Truth or Dare (Harry always opted for dare), Spin the Bottle (by some miracle, it never landed on Harry), and Charades (for which everyone was simply too drunk and fell into fits of giggles over everything). When Hermione and Ron started snogging on the couch –
“Do what, darling?” she asked, marking her place and setting the book aside. She watched Draco pace the small space with a bemused smile. “Did your parents ask you to go home for the holidays again? In which case, good, you shouldn’t, not after last time.”
Draco nodded, mumbled, “Fine, yeah.” Harry considered him for a moment, then leaned forward, pressing two fingers to the inside of Draco’s wrist and brushing his lips against the shell of Draco’s ear.
“Anyways, Blaise pointed out that if you were going to shack up with anyone, it would be Potter, seeing how obsessed with each other you were.”
“It didn’t want to go back to its owner, apparently,” said Draco in a low voice so as not to wake the owl. “I imagine I’ll probably get a Howler for stealing it soon, but I’m not going to just kick it out. Look at it. It’s skin and bones.”
Harry flushed, avoiding the onlooking stares from the nearby students and teachers. He could see that the red-headed boy’s ears had gone pink, even if his gaze was still fixed resolutely on the board. Draco was fuming. He had turned to face Harry, his grey eyes narrowed and his fists clenched in his lap. Harry leaned forward and buried his face with his hands, pushing his glasses up and out of the way. He swore under his breath. He could feel Draco’s glare burning a hole into his head. He sighed and lowered his hands.
Maybe it was in those long, uncomfortable months after his trial, when he first came to 12 Grimmauld Place to apologise, for everything. Maybe it was when Potter started inviting him over for potluck dinner with his friends, simply because Draco had said he was a little lonely, stuck in the Manor with only his mother for company. Or maybe it was when he had drunkenly confessed, after sharing a bottle of wine as they celebrated Draco passing his Potions Mastery Exam, that he wanted to work for the Auror department but didn’t want to be an Auror. Potter showed up on his doorstep the next day with an application to be part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s Forensics team.
Narcissa smiled at her son, and, letting go of his sleeve, gestured for them to sit back down. As they sat, she called for Wilkins and told him to grab their gifts. The house elf disappeared with a crack, only to return a few moments later with a box and a gift bag, which he handed to Harry and Draco. With another crack, Wilkins disappeared again, returning almost instantaneously with Narcissa’s gifts.
Harry shrugged, his cheek against Draco’s damp shoulder. “No,” he said with a heavy sigh. “Not right now, anyway. You’re working. I should let you go.”
If Harry was surprised, he didn’t show it. He slipped out and laid down next to Draco. Draco, meanwhile, had to take a couple deep breaths before he sat up and went about straddling Harry’s hips, lining up. He let out a slow breath as he lowered himself down and – ah, there it was. He leaned his head back with a breathless laugh. When he looked down, Harry was watching him, open-mouthed. He traced a hand up Draco’s stomach, past his weeping cock, to splay across the dragon rising and falling in time with Draco’s shallow breaths. Draco covered Harry’s hand with his own and held it there as he began to rock up and down, hard.
“Uh, no,” Potter said, somewhat gruffly. “I mean, sometimes.” He put his phone away and glanced up. Any attempts to tame his hair had long been forgotten. His wild curls stuck up at odd angles from continuously running his hands through it all day. Draco found that he preferred it like that. He also found that even though it was incredibly late and every bone in his body wanted to sleep, he would stay up all night if it meant being with Potter. Harry. Who was looking at him now like Draco was a sunrise on a winter morning.
“Does it hurt?” he asked softly. Malfoy’s eyes widened, but he shook his head again. Harry had never been this close to him without fighting.
“So where is Malfoy – Draco, I mean?” Harry demanded. Something caught his eye and he crouched down to look at the hearth. He turned his face up towards Kellen, pointing at where the carpet came up to the hearth. “Ash. There’s ash on the carpet, just here at the edge, and here – that’s the edge of a shoe print. Not much to go off of, just a bit of the heel. So, they Floo’d in, stepped out, got ash on the carpet, cursed them, then stepped back and Floo’d out.” Harry stood up, his frown etching itself deeper as he looked from the fireplace to the empty chair opposite. “So where was Malfoy?” he asked, half under his breath. Kellen raised an eyebrow, but he pressed on. “If he was sat there, he should have been the first to be attacked, but there’s no sign of him.” He ran his free hand through his curls, fingers tugging at tangles as he tried to puzzle it all out. “None of this makes sense,” he said with a rough sigh. “Where’s the house elf? I’d like to hear his story.”
“That wasn’t so bad,” he said with a hint of his old drawl. “The way you were going on, I was expecting tears.”
Harry shook his head. “They’re fine, I Talked to them an hour ago, I just….” He paused, biting his lip. He stood by the cot – he and Draco had managed to make it a bit larger, thanks to Draco’s more confident Transfiguration skills, and added a Cushioning charm so that it wasn’t so hard on Harry’s joints. Draco’s copy of the
Draco turned with a dramatic raise of his eyebrows to Harry, who simply groaned and bowed his head so he didn’t have to look at any of them. “Yes, Harry,” Draco said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, “are you dating the git?”
Harry rested his head on his hand, his elbow propped on the table, as he listened with a contented smile to his boyfriend talk. When Draco went to take another bite, the closest to a pause in the conversation Harry could find, he asked, “What about you?”
“She was still my sister,” she said in answer to his questioning look. Harry nodded sympathetically as he tried to arrange Teddy’s curls into an attempt at tidiness. Draco came up beside them, wrapping one arm around Harry’s broad shoulders. He said hello to Andromeda and Teddy, confused by their arrival but polite nonetheless. Teddy shyly peeked up at this new stranger while still burying his face in Harry’s stomach.
Draco froze. “Oh shit, you heard that?” He laughed. “Well, no point in denying it. He was quite insistent on it.”
“You’re not the only one with secrets,” he said in lieu of an explanation. He tugged Draco onto the stairs, and as they were carried up, he gave Draco a curious smile. “What?” he asked. Draco shook his head.
Narcissa looked away. “I do,” she whispered. They stood there for a moment in silence, the weight of grief and memory heavy in the air between them. Then, Narcissa cleared her throat, and gestured towards a door down the hall. “Draco will be waiting for us,” she said, her voice thick. Sure enough, Draco leaned out of the doorway, a confused frown on his face.
Their argument continued until Draco had finished his breakfast, after which he simply waved Harry away with a, “I’ve had enough of you, I’m going to be late to Charms, no thanks to your shenanigans.” Harry only laughed, and waved at him with one of the pieces of toast Draco had abandoned on his plate.
“What, you’re okay with being accused of buying drugs, but not with people thinking you’re straight?” His words were serious, but he couldn’t help the incredulous grin spreading across his face. “Christ, you need to sort your priorities before you take that before a judge.”
“You sure about that?” he asked with a crooked smile. “You sound like you’ve seen your own ghost, not just me.”
“And do what the Dark Lord himself could not? Draco darling, this is madness! Just stay here, with me – ”
After escorting a teary-eyed Wilkins to the table – “Like an equal! Wilkins has heard of Mr. Potter’s kindness, but could not believe! Sitting! With Mr. Potter!” – Harry pulled out two chairs for them and sat down. He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, so that he was eye-level with the house elf, who kicked his heels as they dangled so far above the ground. “First,” said Harry, “I was wondering what the occasion was – for Draco to be visiting, I mean. I understand he moved out some time ago.”
Harry stood on his doorstep with a sheepish look. He was huddled in his vintage leather jacket against the November cold, his thick black curls dampened slightly by the heavy mist outside. He pushed his glasses up nervously, but they couldn’t have done much to help his vision, fogged up and speckled with water as they were. Draco’s heart squeezed tight in his chest. He pursed his lips, crossing his arms as he looked Harry up and down.
So it was Draco who manoeuvred them onto the bed, Draco who pressed Harry back after divesting him of his jacket and shirt, Draco who pinned him to the mattress with hungry kisses. But again, when Harry went to unbutton Draco’s shirt, he froze. Harry moved his hands away, instead rubbing Draco’s upper arms, his shoulders, smiling up at him as reassuringly as he could.
Malfoy took a bite of his toast. The space between them grew tense as Harry waited for him to chew and swallow. Harry tried to school his expression into one of patience, as if Malfoy was a student thinking of an answer, but could feel it slipping. Malfoy seemed to be taking his time, even pouring himself a cup of coffee and taking a sip before answering.
Draco’s head shot up, his eyes wide. “What?” he gasped. Lucius, seemingly pleased to have regained his son’s attention smiled.
Harry flashed her a quick smile, but Draco saw that his hands had curled into fists on his thighs. He bit his lip.
“How do any of us know?” he shot back. “Andromeda, he’s good to me. We’ve been dating two months now, and not once has he tried to hurt me – intentionally, anyway, he did accidentally knock me over when he got startled by a spider the other day. It was very funny.” Harry sighed when Andromeda’s frown only darkened. His shoulders slumped as he shook his head at her. “What can I do to prove to you that he isn’t what you think he is?” he asked wearily.
“Please,” Draco choked out, one shaking hand coming up to cover his mouth as he wept. “Please, stop, please.”
“You didn’t know him,” she murmured. “Not at the end.” Then she smiled, a polite mask sliding over her pale face. “I’ll have a servant show you to your rooms, shall I?”
Harry shrugged. He looked up at her through his lashes, still worrying his lip, before returning to stare at his hands with another feeble shrug. Hermione let out a long, despairing sigh. “Harry, I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what happened. Besides, how bad can it be?”
They stood like that for a minute too long. Then Malfoy stepped away, letting his hand drop, and the moment was gone.
“Quite close quarters,” Harry agreed with a serious nod. “In fact, Draco spends most of his free time in my – ”
“I’m fine,” he insisted, his voice already a little clearer. Kellen nodded begrudgingly. Draco struggled to his feet, Harry holding him up with an arm around his waist. “I just want to go home,” he said in a low voice to Harry, who nodded.
“So I packed my bags and left,” Draco continued softly. He opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling. Harry took his hand in his and wove their fingers together, his thumb rubbing Draco’s knuckle. Draco let out a shaky breath. “Pansy took me in. She helped me figure out how to get a Muggle job – I had to get a fake CV and ID card through the Ministry and everything. I got the café job, started being able to pay my half of the rent. Then, two years later, you show up and scare the living shit out of me.”
Harry nodded – yes, of course, he wanted this… right? Sure, his movements were mechanical, and every second he was thinking through his next touch, what he was supposed to be doing to make Draco feel good, but that was normal, right? The ease with which he saw other people kiss and hold each other, the passion he saw on the telly, that just came with practice, right? It’s not like everyone just innately knew what to do, right? Right? Realisation dawned horribly in his chest as the nausea threatened to claw up his throat. Draco’s cheeks grew pale watching Harry.
They grinned at each other, revelling in the ease of their banter. Back in the day, they would have decked each other by now. Harry came over to where Draco stood braced against the counter near the stove and hopped up to perch on the counter beside him. This way, he was at eye level with Draco, even as he kicked his ankles against the cabinet drawers behind him. Draco rolled his eyes and called him a heathen. Harry only smiled.
“Yeah. Bittersweet,” he murmured. “And what’s more, I got to remember growing up with you as him – all the hatred and rivalry and strange obsession. He might have married Ginny – which honestly weirds me out, she’s like a sister to me – but he wasn’t straight, I can tell you that. He had a crush on Cedric, that boy who died, in fourth year, but beyond that, he really did feel… something, towards you, that I don’t think even he could explain.”
Surprised, Draco and Harry looked at their shirts then at each other. Draco had blanched, but a slow grin spread across Harry’s face. Draco, as if reading Harry’s mind, widened his eyes and shook his head minutely. Harry waggled his eyebrows in a challenge.
Harry raised his eyebrows at that. “Fair enough. You got lucky though, you had a nice growth spurt in, what, third year? Maybe that’s why you’re such a shitty Seeker,” he added with a mischievous smile.
Harry shrugged. “Just wanted to say it.” He brushed his lips against Draco’s, so briefly it was barely a kiss. There was a flash of a camera, then another, like blinding white fireworks. Draco pulled him in for another kiss, one hand tangling in his hair as he held Harry close.
“Well, I don’t know about the ladies,” he said, “but we were betting on when you were finally going to make this shit official. Oi, Hermione!”
“What about Healer-patient confidentiality?” Draco teased. Pansy rolled her eyes. Draco let out a small breath meant to be a laugh, took a sip of his wine. “Wonder what he’s going to do, now that he’s not trying to save the world anymore.”
“Nothing,” he said too quickly, “I just invited Draco over for some tea.” The kettle began to whistle just then, and Harry flicked his wand at it to move it off the hob with a sheepish, “See?” Draco wanted to bury his face in his hands in mortification, but doing so would only make it worse.
Harry crowded Draco up against the bed, pushing him down onto it only to climb on top. He couldn’t stop grinning, and neither could Draco. This was a night ten years in the making, after all.
Later that night, he snuck back into the room. The lights were off, and from what he could tell, Malfoy was fast asleep. Harry took off his shoes by the door and began to strip as he made his way to his side of the wall, tossing his clothes in the direction of his closet. He was just stepping out of his trousers when he heard a soft voice say,
The icy touch of Draco’s hand brushing his shoulder made Harry turn. Draco smiled at him, a warm light in his silver eyes. Harry tried to stifle the hopeful leap his heart gave when his eyes met Draco’s, to resist the desperate need for touch.
Harry didn’t need any more encouragement after that. He leaned in for a chaste kiss, but Draco was having none of it. The hand holding Harry’s jaw slipped into his hair, thick and coarse between his fingers, while his other hand slipped around to press against his low back, pulling Harry flush against him. Harry gasped against Draco’s mouth. Draco eagerly licked at his lower lip, a question answered by Harry’s moan. Then it was Harry licking into Draco’s mouth, his hands roving over Draco’s body, pulling at Draco’s silky fine hair, palming along his side, desperately searching for more. Their kiss wasn’t just hungry, it was starving, as if they had never eaten before that night only to be given a feast.
Harry threw his hands in the air. “I know all that, Dromeda. I went to school with him, remember? I spoke in defence of him and his mother at the trials, remember? Yes, his father helped Voldemort rise to power, but his mother saved me from Voldemort, and, actually, so did Draco! They both could have given me up, but they didn’t. Yes, he has the Mark. But you saw the way he was with Teddy. He’s sweet and intelligent and more than a bit of a drama queen, but more importantly, he makes me happy. He’s changed since the war, and I would know, more than anyone.”
Draco harumphed and extracted himself from Harry’s arms. “Oh, no,” he said, making his way towards the living room and the awaiting fireplace. “I spent far too much time on all this just to stay in. You’re just going to have to wait.”
Only, when he popped into the great high-ceilinged atrium, he realised that he head no idea where the Auror office was located. The court rooms, his father’s old office, sure. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement? Not so much.
“It certainly looks that way.” He moved his queen out of harm’s way, his smirk falling into a small frown. “I’m sure I’ll find something to do on Christmas Day,” he mumbled as Harry defended his only bishop from Draco’s malicious-looking knight. Harry’s brow furrowed.
“Anything’s better than what you’re wearing,” Draco retorted, his voice surprisingly level for how hard his heart was pounding. Potter snorted.
“No,” Malfoy said at last, his expression clearing until all that remained of his scowl was a slight crease between his brows. “I just… You make no sense, Potter. Why are you being so nice to me? First at my trial and then on the first night and now…” He bit his lip. It was the most Harry had heard him speak in the past several weeks. “You hate me,” Malfoy continued, his voice barely audible as he looked at Harry, his grey, rain-coloured eyes lost and confused. “I fought against you. Why are you treating me like a….”
He sat down heavily on the cot, which creaked beneath his weight. The hound dissipated into the air, like mist on a summer morning. Harry buried his hands in his curls, elbows braced against his knees, and tried to even out his breathing. Draco knelt in front of him, his flushed face worried, frowning. Harry hadn’t realised he was crying until Draco’s thumbs tried to wipe away the tears. He fell forward slightly, and Draco caught him, cradling him against his chest, Harry’s sobs muffled against his shoulder.
“Ron! Please! Let’s just talk about this!” Harry insisted, his hands raised palms up, trying to calm the situation down. Ron barked out a hollow laugh.
It was a leather-bound copy of English poetry. Harry held his breath as he gently opened the cover, flipping the crackling flyleaves to the title page, where the publishing date – 1894 – was printed. He turned the page over to the table of contents, where it seemed every great English poet had a section all to themselves.
The figure had turned right at the landing, so Harry did the same. Distantly, he thought he should stop, go and get Ron and Hermione. Something stopped him, though. Almost like… he had been here before.
Draco stood suddenly, his chair toppling over as it caught on the carpet. Harry looked up in time to see Parkinson and Crabbe both take a step back. Both of their faces were whiter than Draco’s sheets, but Draco was fuming. His hands were clutched into fists at his sides, and Harry could see him shaking, this time with rage. Never, in all his years of fighting with Malfoy, had Harry ever seen Draco so angry.
. It’s all mechanical and awkward and uncomfortable, and I thought that was the way it was for everyone but… Draco said I should enjoy it and I realised that I … don’t.”
The curtains were yanked back. Draco looked up, startled, wand raised. Harry stood there, chest heaving, out of breath. He mouthed, “Can you hear me?” Draco shook his head and lowered the charm, only to raise it again when Harry had climbed onto the bed across from him. Harry’s cheeks were flushed and there were tears in his eyes again, but he grew pale at the sight of Draco’s arm. Draco wasn’t sure if it was the sight of the Mark or the red, raw skin that made Harry blanche. Either way, he moved to pull his sleeve back up to hide it all. Harry was too fast, though. He caught Draco’s wrist and forced his arm up, to bare the angry skin to the light. With his other hand, he traced trembling fingertips up and down the Mark, the ridges left by Draco’s ragged nails. Draco inhaled with a hiss at his cool touch. Still Harry did not let go.
“Still,” he said, looking up first at Harry with his heart in his eyes, then to Hermione. “I’m not saying that anything I did is forgivable. What I am saying is that I am sorry. For all of it. If I could go back with a Time Turner and change it all, I would.”
“This evening. I promised Ron and Hermione I’d get lunch with them. It’s the weekend, so I just need to get back to grade papers and set up for the week. You didn’t answer my question.”
Harry jogged up to his side. With a sigh, Draco slowed his pace and allowed him to fall into step beside him. They walked in silence for a few breaths, both flushed and unable to look each other in the eye.
“Hey.” Harry flicked Draco’s nose to get him to open his eyes, which he did with an indignant yelp. “You didn’t kill Fred. You didn’t force George’s hand. And you can’t be held responsible for what your father did.”
Draco shut his eyes and buried his face in Harry’s chest again. That voice berated him, over and over again – broken, wrong, pathetic – the words rang in his ears. He breathed Harry in – black pepper and cedar, sweat and sun-kissed skin – and breathed out.
They stumbled up to the bedroom like drunkards, neither willing to let the other go for long. They crashed against walls, chased each other up the stairs, left trousers and socks in their wake like snakes shedding their old skin until they were naked and exposed, reborn. When they finally tumbled onto the bed, limbs tangled and skin pressed against glorious skin, Draco managed to ask, “What do you want to do?”
Draco grinned. “I’m full of surprises,” he said. Just to prove his point, he flipped them around so that Harry was beneath him, his knees framing Draco’s hips and his mouth open in a surprised ‘o’. Draco set almost immediately to kissing and sucking at Harry’s neck, attacking the sensitive spots behind his ear and where his neck met his shoulder. Harry squirmed beneath him with a pleased little smirk on his lips.
Harry, who had initially stepped back in surprise, now moved forward, pressing into Draco’s personal space, his eyes dark as he looked up into his face. “Have you?” he demanded, his voice rough.
Draco sighed. “I don’t know,” he said, his voice vulnerable and soft. “I never thought that far ahead, if I’m honest.”
“Of course,” she murmured. They both surreptitiously dabbed at their eyes. Harry gave Draco’s hand one last squeeze before unthreading their fingers. “Alright,” said Narcissa, “let’s open presents, shall we?”
?! Cormac’s kid?! Come on, Teddy, you’ve got to have better taste than that!” Harry squawked. Teddy’s hair matched his crimson cheeks as he dug his phone out of his pocket. He pulled up a picture of the boy in question – after mobile phones became popular, Hogwarts had to update their anti-Muggle technology wards so that the phones could work, at least to a limited extent. Teddy shoved his phone over the island to show them. Draco and Harry leaned forward to squint at the small screen. The picture wasn’t great quality, but Draco had to admit, the younger McLaggen had inherited his father’s swagger. Harry frowned.
Harry turned to look over his shoulder at Draco, still standing there holding a cup in each hand. He raised an eyebrow. A small smirk played at the corners of his mouth as something clicked in those brilliant green eyes.
“I had a bad dream,” Teddy whispered. Harry was pretty sure he heard Draco mumble, “join the club,” and kicked him under the sheets. “Can I sleep with you?”
“Don’t worry about it. I saw this in a shop when I was visiting Mother’s family in Provence and thought of you. It’s nothing,” said Draco, rushing through the words as if he had rehearsed them. Harry focused on unwrapping the package, hoping Draco couldn’t see his blush. He let out a small gasp when the wrapping fell away.
Pansy, who had become a Healer with Draco but specialised in permanent spell damage, had asked him during one of their first summers in the apprenticeship program why he never wore short sleeved shirts. He hadn’t been able to tell her then. It was not, in fact, until they had been working together for three years that he showed her the Mark and asked if she could remove it. She had grown quiet and sad as she examined his forearm, covered not only in the Mark but thin silvery scars, some long and some small. She never asked about those. He never told her. In the end, she had not been able to remove the Mark. It seemed no one could. The Dark Lord had made sure of that.
“Well, technically, you’ve already met him,” he said slowly. Ron’s eyebrows disappeared into his fringe. Harry bit his lip. “It’s, erm… it’sDracoMalfoy.”
Wilkins frowned. “Wilkins couldn’t say sir,” he said. “When he was younger, the young master was more… open with his moods. But since the war…there was nothing out of the ordinary about him, sir,” he assured Harry. “He was just… quiet?”
“Er, right.” He shot a desperate look over at Neville, who just shrugged and turned back to his conversation with Professor Sinistra. Malfoy’s lips quirked up into a faint sneering smile, but there was no malice behind it. Blushing, Harry tried again. “What have you been up to, then? Recently, that is.”
“Ooooh, you haven’t heard?” Parkinson squealed. Harry’s palms began to sweat as his heart jumped into his throat. No, how could he know, how could Parkinson of all people have found out…
“I’ve always been nice,” he said, “just not to you. You should be honoured, this is a privilege reserved for a select few.”
Tonks, who had been staring at Malfoy like she’d seen a ghost – given Malfoy’s pale complexion and white-blond hair, he didn’t blame her – started and blinked, turning to smile back at Harry. “Just fine,” she said. “But you two should head up to the castle. The train’s getting ready to go back to London.” She glanced at Malfoy again before she added, “You alright, Harry? Not been fighting, have you?”
“You’re in a mood,” said Blaise, raising an eyebrow. He settled into his corner of the couch, one arm stretched across the back and his left ankle bouncing on his right knee. “What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
“Now why is it that when Granger offers to tell Robards off, it’s helping, but when I offer, I’m not helping?” Draco demanded, raising his eyebrows at Harry. Harry gave him a teasing smile and poked him in the shoulder with his free hand.
That odd, indecipherable look came into Malfoy’s storm-coloured eyes. Then, a slow smile spread across his face, a smile unlike any Harry had seen from him before. It made Harry’s breath catch in his chest and send that fluttery feeling through his entire gut. But before Harry could process it, Malfoy was speaking and he had to refocus on his words.
“What just happened?” he said to no one in particular. Hermione, who had been half-listening to their exchange from the cluster around the window, came over and patted him on the shoulder with a pitying smile.
if he failed. But that wasn’t what the priest was asking. Again, in the corners of his mind, he envisioned a boy with wild black curls and a mouth quick to laughter, but so easily twisted in anger these days. He shook his head.
Harry stumbled. He cursed, and half-considered pulling his trousers back on. From what he could see, however, Malfoy’s back was turned. He let out a sigh and tossed the trousers towards the closet with the rest. Just in his boxers, he made his way to his bed, not trying to be as quiet as before.
“It was so easy,” Draco began, choosing his words with care, “to lose myself in you. But I needed to figure out who I was on my own, first. Without my parents, without the war, without you.”
“No, no, sir,” he insisted. “Young master could never harm them! Even when they argued he was always very civil. No, no, Wilkins won’t believe such lies!”
“Malfoy,” Ron replied automatically. He looked from Draco, smirking like a cat, to Harry, still blushing and with hickeys blooming on his neck. “Right,” he said, dragging the word out slowly as he backed away. “I will…come back… later.” With that, he turned and left, closing the door behind him with a click.
“Oh, Merlin’s tits.” Draco flushed in embarrassment, burying his face in his hands. “You’re never going to let me forget that, are you?”
When he arrived at Potter’s office that morning, Draco was surprised to find Potter already there, coffees waiting. He had almost gotten used to waiting outside Potter’s office for the other man to rush in as he had done for the past week, apologizing for being late and hair still wet from the shower. Today, Potter stood behind his desk, sorting out papers and looking far more put together than Draco had ever seen him. His pressed button-down was a shade of pale blue, his sleeves rolled up to the elbows to reveal his muscular forearms. His mess of black hair had been tamed somewhat so that it looked more artfully tousled than like bedhead. His dress pants actually fit him, highlighting his toned legs and… other things. His trademark leather jacket was on the back of his chair, his Auror robes on the coat stand next to his desk, although it had only just begun to cool off from the summer heat wave.
Narcissa looked from Harry, to Draco, to Harry and back again. Her shocked expression schooled itself into a courteous smile. She straightened her tailored navy dress, her only sign of nerves. “Happy Christmas, Mr. Potter,” she said, before rounding on Draco with a severe raise of her eyebrows. “Draco, you didn’t tell me Mr. Potter would be joining us.”
Draco shrugged. He couldn’t bring himself to look the priest in the eye. He reminded him too much of someone else. Someone with bright green eyes and sun-kissed skin.
Malfoy nodded, lips pressed into a thin line, almost a smile. “Water? Or something stronger?” he asked, lifting one eyebrow. Definitely a smile now, small but there. Harry smiled back.
Hermione shook her head, her expression sympathetic as she whispered, “Oh, honey, you’re in over your head.”
So it was that the day they all returned from the winter holidays, Harry found another origami crane waiting for him on his four-poster bed. He picked it up and shoved it unceremoniously into his pocket before Ron could see. That night, when they were all tucked away in their beds, Harry once again closed the curtains and read the note by the light of his wand.
Harry let out the breath he’d been holding. He pulled Draco into his arms, leaning their foreheads together, breathing and shaking together. “Are you okay?” Harry murmured, peppering kisses on Draco’s cheeks, his forehead, the corners of his mouth. Draco nodded. He brushed away the drying tear tracks on Harry’s cheeks – when had he started crying?
Then, one day, Potter showed up at the Manor, cheeks pink and hair tousled from the cold November wind. Draco stood in the doorway, rail-thin and exhausted from the nightmares that tormented him, from days that felt like life sentences, from watching his mother scrubbing at the marble floors to wash away the blood only she could see. Potter looked him up and down. Draco’s heart stammered in his chest, but he managed to remain stoic as he rasped Potter’s name. He licked his lips, swallowed. “No damsels in distress to save today?”
“You have to tell me the story behind it – sorry, her. I’ve never heard of someone getting a break up gift before.”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. He covered Malfoy’s hand on his shoulder with his own, gave it a small squeeze. “I know.”
“I thought it would help answer your question,” he said. He stirred the vegetables, tension in the corners of his mouth. Harry frowned.
in bed and seen Draco curled up asleep beside him with that little worried crease between his brows. There wasn’t one moment when Harry definitively realised that he loved Draco Malfoy. There was a multitude, drops in an endless ocean.
“You missed matins!” said Father Nicola in way of greeting, striding up the nave to meet them. He cast a curious eye at Harry, who was craning his neck to look at the lofted ceilings, the old oak beams. “What brings you here today?”
An expectant silence fell in the room. Harry waited for the shoe to drop, for Malfoy to say something, anything. Then,
“It turns out we have more in common than we thought,” Harry said vaguely, his eyes on the carrot. Ron scoffed.
Harry nodded. Without another word, they Apparated, leaving the early morning commuters to go about their day as usual.
“Good to have you here, Draco,” said Molly, releasing Draco and giving him a quick pat on the cheek. He gave her a small, polite smile. He looked over at Harry, who was trying to hide his blushing face as he bent over the table, focusing entirely on filling the pies.
Kellen and a handful of Aurors rushed in to break up the fight. Humphries stepped in and bodily hauled Ron away, his arms trapping Ron’s to his sides. He nodded his stony face at Harry and said over Ron’s caterwauling, “Go, sir. I’ve got this.” Harry didn’t need telling twice.
“With who?” he asked. He shot Neville a wink. Neville rolled his eyes as he leaned against the corner post of his four-poster. Harry, too busy pulling on his favourite pair of combat boots, ignored both of them. When Dean repeated his question with a, “Hey, Harry!”, to get his attention, Harry only blushed a darker shade of crimson. He shoved his wallet and his wand in his back pocket and pulled on Sirius’s old leather jacket before striding off to meet Draco, ignoring Dean’s third shout of, “Harry! Who is it?”
“Something you should see,” Malfoy murmured, his low voice sending a shiver down Harry’s spine. “Just you, though. No one else.”
They drank the rest of their tea without another word about Malfoy, too wrapped up as they were in discussing the Gryffindor team’s line-up for the upcoming year. But Harry kept thinking of a certain grey-eyed man, and the words they’d exchanged all those years ago…
So it was settled. They would spend Christmas morning with Draco’s mother at Malfoy Manor, and Christmas evening with the Weasleys at the Burrow. As a result, they decided to exchange presents on Christmas Eve. That is why the two of them were sat in front of the fire in Harry’s room – or rather, what was becoming
More flashes of white burned behind Harry’s closed eyes. He didn’t care. Let it be all over the front page. They weren’t hiding anymore.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Hermione asked, concern etched into her brow. Rose tried to wiggle out of her arms but she tightened her hold without looking away from Harry. “Is it your scar? Has something happened?”
Harry opened his mouth, thought better of it, closed it again. After a moment, he managed a, “Right, well. Good to know,” before retreating back to his bed. He hadn’t been able to read much more that night.
Draco’s expression twisted and he pushed off the bed, grabbing his jacket from the back of the armchair. “Owl me when you figure it out, then,” he spat. He tried to fill his words with venom, but Harry saw the hurt flashing in his eyes like lightening. Harry stood, tried to reach for him, tried to tell him to stay – but Draco spun away, and with a pop, he Apparated away, leaving Harry alone in his room.
“Really,” he assured them, “I’m fine. Oh, I’ve been reading – very slowly, mind you, this case has sort of consumed my life, but you know, a chapter a night before I go to bed.”
Draco mulled this over. “I don’t blame you,” he said finally, not meeting Harry’s hopeful eyes. “I – I’ve fancied you since we were in school, but refused to acknowledge it. It was Blaise – Zabini, yeah – who first pointed it out. He said, what was it… ‘sometimes we lie to ourselves because it’s easier than the truth.’” He sighed. “He was right, of course, the bastard. But I thought it would never come to anything, so I just did my best to ignore it, which, during the war, was easy enough. That night you were brought to the Manor, though… seeing you like that… and then during the Battle, in the Room of Hidden Things….” He trailed off as he closed his eyes, the memories flashing against the darkness of his mind – Harry’s face, swollen from a jinx, his eyes begging Draco not to give him up; Harry’s hand reaching for him as the flames closed in around them; Harry, after the trials, offering a smile and a cup of tea like he was an old friend.
Draco froze. Harry’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, one hand scrubbing through his hair as he reeled backwards from his own declaration. Draco opened his mouth, closed it again.
Harry, who had folded his hands under his chin to better watch Draco as he told his story, closed his eyes for a moment. He tried to imagine Narcissa Malfoy – proud, regal matriarch that she was – scrubbing the floorboards and marble tiles of the Manor. He couldn’t. Instead, he remembered Voldemort, barefoot, stepping over the bloodied bodies, their eyes glazed as their lives seeped into the floor beneath them. He opened his eyes just in time to hear Draco continue,
Malfoy looked down at his cuffed hands. When he raised his eyes to meet Harry’s again, his expression was like an exposed flame, vulnerable but bright.
“You will have to be more specific, Potter,” he heard from the other side. Harry rolled his eyes and got out of bed where he had been reading to poke his head above his desk and look at Malfoy. Malfoy glanced up from his homework with a small frown.
“You can call me Harry, Mrs. Malfoy,” said Harry. He pushed his glasses up his nose as he continued. “It was a good first term, we have a good bunch of first years this year. To tell the truth, it’s been pretty uneventful, compared to when we were in school, but I agree with Draco, this term has been particularly…rewarding.” He glanced at Draco as he sipped his tea, and tried to hide his smile at the faint blush creeping across Draco’s cheeks. He reached a hand under the table and squeezed Draco’s thigh like Draco had done, but left it there, rubbing circles into Draco’s inner thigh through the fabric of his dress pants. Sure enough, Draco’s cheeks went from pink to red. Harry bit back his grin.
Harry sat down heavily in the chair beside her bed. He scrubbed his face with his hands, trying to rub the exhaustion from his eyes. He looked over at the form of Narcissa on the bed, covered in a white hospital sheet.
At around 2am, Harry and Draco jolted awake when their bedroom door opened. It was only Teddy. He came over to their bedside as Draco flopped back onto the pillows, grumbling about ‘having a heart attack’. Harry rubbed his eyes and asked blearily, “What is it, Teddy?”
He still grimaced when he felt Harry very pointedly rub his nose on Draco’s shoulder. “I take it back, I hate you,” he muttered. Harry kissed his neck just above his collar. Draco rolled his eyes. The man knew all his weak spots. They were quiet for a moment, still holding each other as they stood there in the small toilet, trying to ignore the stale smell of urine and cleaning product. Finally, Draco asked, “Do you want to talk about it?”
Harry fished out the Muggle coins and counted them out on the countertop. Malfoy swiped them and processed the transaction. Before he handed Harry his receipt, however, he asked, holding the piece of paper ransom in between his long bony fingers, “Why here? You could have had your date anywhere else. Why come here?”
Harry nodded. He knew the feeling. “How about we take this one step at a time? Let’s get you freshened up, and as much I hate to say it, out of my bathrobe.” Draco chuckled at this, and Harry’s heart skipped. “We can go down to breakfast if you want, or I can have one of the house elves bring something up. I have some work to do, but if you want, we can just… talk. Or sleep. Or none of the above. Whatever you want.”
Draco nodded. “Okay,” he whispered as his nose rubbed up against Harry’s, his breath against Harry’s lips. “Okay,” he murmured again, as he closed the small space between them and kissed Harry as if for the last time. “Ok-” But Harry didn’t let him finish. He pulled Draco back in, their mouths crashing together as they kissed each other hungrily, passionately, fingers curling into hair and into skin, pushing, pressing, holding.
Harry shrugged. “You never know,” he pointed out. “Maybe if Foreign Affairs doesn’t work out, you can get a job as a tour guide.”
“I’m glad you have no qualms about eating…here,” he remarked dryly, as he watched Harry help himself to a second serving of meat, sopping up the juices with his bread. Harry shrugged, swallowing his mouthful of food. It had been a long day, and he hadn’t eaten since that morning. The king continued, “I’ve been told most humans are afraid that eating elvish food would trap them here forever.”
“For one thing, she didn’t curse me,” Harry pointed out. Draco shrugged. Harry raised an arm in invitation, and Draco, toeing off his shoes, climbed into bed next to Harry, snuggling up against him as Harry pulled him into his side. “And I do need a new pair of socks,” Harry added thoughtfully. Draco turned into Harry’s chest to hide his smile.
Harry opened the door a crack and poked his head through. Sunlight filtered in through the tall narrow windows onto the strange devices scattered around the large office on their well-polished pedestals. Dumbledore sat behind his desk and looked up with a benevolent smile from his paperwork.
Ron narrowed his eyes at Harry but only gave a noncommittal hum in response. “I guess I have to give him some kudos for not giving you shit when he found out you were gay,” Ron said at last as he turned back to his parsnips. “Because if he had, well.” His chopping took on a menacing air. “Let’s just say Dumbledore would have me doing a lot more than meditating for detention.”
Harry’s heart sank like cold iron in his gut. He shook his head, his curls falling in his eyes, as he tried to find a hole in her argument but came up short.
Harry’s hand moved away. He covered Draco’s hand on his chest with his own again. He let out a sigh, and that awful distant voice told Draco that it was a sigh of disappointment.
“Hermione, I am very emotional right now, it might be best if you put Rose in her room because if you’re worried about me swearing, it’s about to get a lot worse.”
Draco waved a hand, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “You can’t, it’s fine, it’s unbreakable, I was just – ”
He told Harry everything that day. It took several hours – the sun had set and the evening chill set in by the time Draco finished. All the while, Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he had heard the story before, the feeling that his world had tilted slightly off its axis and slid into another universe all its own, that Draco’s words were coming to him from the bottom of a deep pool.
“I’m proud of you,” he murmured. “Have you thought of what you’re going to do next? It’s okay if you don’t have a plan just yet.”
“I know you’re there, Malfoy,” said Potter without turning around. He held something up that looked in the moonlight like a pamphlet, or thickly folded parchment. “I could see you coming.”
By the time he had finished, Hermione had gotten to her feet and was pacing back and forth. She kept trying to smooth back her flyaway curls into her loose bun. “So you weren’t sleeping with him when the investigation started?” she said. Harry shook his head. “Well, either way, it’s good the case is under Kellen’s name, because this could look really bad for you. I know, I know,” she held up a hand to stop Harry from protesting, even though he was about to agree with her, “there’s already a conflict of interest with George. God, I still can’t believe – George, of all people.” She sat back down in her chair, covering her face with her hands. Harry nodded as he looked down at his arms squeezing himself tight. After a moment, Hermione lowered her hands, wiping away the tears that had welled up in her eyes. She turned to Harry with a weak smile. “How is Draco?” she asked. Harry smiled back.
“Mad? No, I’m not mad,” Narcissa said hurriedly. She paused. “Okay, maybe a little mad. How long has this been going on?”
Harry swallowed hard past his racing heart, which had become lodged in his throat. Draco must have seen something in his eyes. He sat up, the concerned little crease between his eyebrows forming as he looked down at Harry.
Draco barked out a laugh. “Yeah. Whatever I am.” He pulled his hand back through the mantle. “It’s funny, sometimes I’m more solid, and others, not so much. Hallowe’en is when I tend to be more… here, I guess. Don’t know why, I never paid much attention in – ” He trailed off. He lowered his hand to his side as he gave Harry a quizzical look. “You don’t know anything about magic, do you?”
Blaise shrugged, his eyes on the glowing embers as they burned low in the grate. “Just a thought,” he said. “But maybe, sometimes, we lie to ourselves because it’s easier than the truth. And, maybe, what you call hate is something else entirely.” Blaise stood up and stretched, his back arching like a cat. His usual easy grin spread across his face as he caught Draco’s eye and added, “I might be wrong. But I think you and my cousin are alike, in more ways than one. Good night, Draco.”
A couple hours later, after he had showered and breakfasted, Kellen arrived in a swirl of green flames into Harry’s kitchen.
, my colleagues can chat up witnesses and sexually harass female members of staff – which let me tell you, I have half a mind to tell the
Harry laughed derisively. “Nah, they’re more fans of boxing than dancing.” His lips curled in a parody of a smile. “It’s fine, really, they’ve done worse.”
“You know, it’s okay,” he said, still chuckling. “You’ve been busy. If I haven’t had much opportunity to pull, I can’t imagine you would either.”
Malfoy smirked. “Pick your jaw up off the floor, Potter. You didn’t really think you were the only gay kid in the school, did you? It is an all-boys school, after all, although I think the all-girls schools have us beat in reputation alone.”
He had kissed Draco Malfoy. He had spent the night with Draco Malfoy. And Draco Malfoy had wept in his arms because his father had just died. Harry combed his hands through his hair, trying to pull out the knots and tangles. Outside his window, the sun was beginning to rise into a blue sky with scattered clouds. The storm, it seemed, had finally passed. The kettle whistled and Harry pulled it off the stove in case the noise –
Draco bit his lip as something broke in those moon-grey eyes. Then, he murmured, “Don’t punch me,” and kissed him.
As they turned the corner into their hall, they saw a cluster of Draco’s friends outside their door. Draco swore under his breath. One of them must have heard, because one by one they all turned and saw the two of them standing, frozen, at the end of the hall. Draco wrenched his hand from Harry’s grasp, and when he looked up, he saw the split-second moment when Draco’s fear was hidden by the impenetrable mask he had worn for so long.
Harry’s eyes had already closed. He burrowed back down further under the covers, his head half against the pillow and half on Draco’s chest. Draco held him there, slowly running his fingers through Harry’s wild curls as he fell back to sleep.
Ron eyed him as he chopped. “You’ve gone soft, Harry,” was all he said. But Ron knew his best friend, and there was more to this story than Harry was telling. He pursed his lips. Harry would tell him in his own time.
After he gave his statement in as long-winded and over-the-top manner as possible, Dawkins let Malfoy go. Malfoy smirked when he found Harry sitting at his desk, filling out the incidence report. He came over and leaned against Harry’s desk with his arms folded across his narrow chest. Harry watched him, trying to stifle a grin as he leaned his head in his hand, eyes shining with suppressed mirth.
“Wait, back up,” she said. “Harry Potter… wants to get drinks with you? And that’s why you’re throwing a hissy fit?”
His excitement was contagious. Draco could barely contain his own grin as he reached out and interlaced his fingers with Harry’s. They both closed their eyes, let out contented sighs, as if their joined hands were completing a spell five years in the making. When Harry’s eyes fluttered open, Draco smiled at him unabashedly.
“I know. And I will. But not right now. I have some things to think about first.” With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Draco no choice but to get up and follow him out of Dumbledore’s office.
By the time Harry finished explaining, Draco wasn’t sure who he wanted to hex, Ron or Robards. He took a deep breath. Then another. Then he dropped his head into his hands. He let out a quiet stream of swear words as he stared at his knees.
Teddy looked from Harry to Draco and back. “Is he your boyfriend?” he asked Harry bluntly. Harry blushed. Draco snickered and leaned in to kiss Harry’s warm red cheek.
“Which bed you want?” Harry asked, levitating his luggage into the air. “Take your pick, there are plenty.”
Malfoy’s cheeks turned slightly pink. “Er, well, what with all the wards and the – my using the guest bedroom and all,” he stammered, gesturing vaguely. Harry, finally taking pity on him, came to stand beside Malfoy and said,
“Can I ask you something?” Draco asked, his voice low and barely audible above the din of the party. He turned his head towards Harry, who glanced at him and shrugged with a smile before taking a long swig of butterbeer.
When Malfoy returned, Harry was nowhere to be found, and a wall made up of their desks and bookshelves divided the room into two. There was a paper sign taped to the end of the makeshift wall. He stepped closer to read the scrawled handwriting, and chuckled.
She pulled away from him to press a hand to his cheek. She smiled. “Go,” she said. “Just talk to him. Honestly. None of this ‘better off alone’ bullshit, alright?” He nodded, and she patted his cheek. “Good. He’s at Hermione’s. And if I hear you pull any stunts, I will make the Dark Lord look like a schoolyard bully, you hear me?”
Kellen greeted them as they stepped through the fireplace into the kitchen. She only spared a curious look at Amelia the orchid before launching into the new security precautions that had been put into place. Essentially, only DMLE staff with a certain security clearance could come through the Floo, and while Harry could make calls, no calls from outside the DMLE could come through. Only Harry and Draco could Apparate in and out, and even then only on the front doorstep. The previous wards Harry had put on the house had been strengthened, making it practically invisible to the outside world except to those Harry had shared the secret of the address with.
Draco shook his head. “No,” he said slowly. “No, I honestly can’t imagine that. Where are you going with this, Potter?”
“Right,” said Harry slowly, taking the Cloak from him and folding it over his arm. He hesitated, then added, “Don’t forget what I said, either. About helping.”
“You like it,” he teased, rolling his hips against Draco and feeling the hard length there. Draco groaned. “I promise to make you come properly next time, but we are going to miss breakfast if we do this much longer, so.” He snaked a hand between them and slipped under Draco’s boxers to grasp his cock. Draco buried his face against Harry’s neck with a moan as Harry began to pump him quickly. It only took a few strokes before Draco came with a sob in Harry’s hand. Harry chuckled, turning his head to press a kiss to Draco’s temple.
“Like I’ve been pummelled by Bludgers,” Draco mumbled. He made his way to his usual chair, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Harry made Draco his tea as well as his own, still smiling to himself. Something about seeing sleepy Draco in Harry’s bathrobe made his heart want to burst. He passed Draco his tea in his floral-print cup, which Draco took gratefully. Harry watched as he nursed his tea, holding the cup with both hands and taking tiny sips. Harry set his own cup back in its saucer and leaned back in his chair.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, setting his cup down on the kitchen counter. “You’ll go back to Hogwarts and you’ll never hear from me until the next reunion. This was just one night, Harry. It didn’t mean anything.”
Harry, tucked in a corner in the hall by the sitting room door, grinned ear to ear. He loved the man the minute he laid eyes on him. This was a man, after all, who had been his father’s friend, who knew about his past, his future, his destiny, surely. How could he not love him? Especially when, for the first time in Harry’s life, someone saw the bruises fading ugly on his skin and refused to stay silent?
Draco crossed his arms and shrugged. He had sat her down after the Yule Ball – she tried to kiss him, and he had stepped away, quite literally sat her down on a bench in a quiet hallway, and explained that he was gay. It was months before she talked to him again.
Harry laughed. He leaned his forehead against Draco’s with a wide grin. Draco couldn’t help but chuckle as well.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said. He shuffled a little closer and ducked his head to press a kiss to Draco’s shoulder. “I wish I could have done something, helped or… something.”
“I’m sorry,” he said in that same low, barely audible tone. “For everything I did when we were kids, for my family, for everything.”
A cloak, a stone, a wand. The Hallowed Trinity. It was every necromancer’s dream to find all three of the sacred relics in order to gain true mastery of Death, but in seven hundred years, no one had succeeded. The last necromancer to hold all three had been killed shortly after, and the relics scattered once more. The man who had killed Harry’s parents had tried, had even fashioned a new name for himself to boast of what had become his life’s mission – but his vanity was his downfall.
Draco sighed. Harry seemed set on talking, then. He looked up, folding his hands under his chin. Harry propped his head up with one arm, his other hand still brushing along Draco’s spine. “What do you mean, ‘what happened’?” Draco asked. “Many things have happened in my life; you have to be more specific than that.”
Harry smiled to himself. He got to his feet with a stretch. “Same as always,” he said, a strange look on his fire-lit face. “I thought of someone I love.”
“So what did you think about just then?” Draco asked, a confused frown etched into the corners of his mouth. Harry didn’t look at him as he put his wand back into the pocket of his pyjama bottoms.
Harry’s hands were suddenly on his hips, pulling him close to the edge of the bed, making him stumble a little. Harry steadied him, his grip firm. Draco turned his head, about to ask what he was doing. He jumped slightly as Harry pressed a kiss to the branch of the tattoo on his low back, but then Harry’s lips moved up, mouthing along the path of lightning as he carefully pulled Draco down onto his lap. He kissed up to the nape of Draco’s neck, his hands sliding down from his hips to his thighs. One hand traced the curve of the serpent’s head, while the other brushed along the inside of his left thigh. Draco leaned his head back on Harry’s shoulder with a moan as he let his legs fall open, giving into the feel of Harry’s lips on his neck, his hands on his thighs. Then Harry was palming up his thigh, up his stomach, making Draco shudder. He splayed his hand over the dragon on his chest, pushing Draco against him as he rolled his hips up under Draco, grinding against his arse. Draco cried out. He reached back to tangle his hand in Harry’s curls as Harry sucked a love bite into his shoulder, grinding his hips down against the hard line of Harry’s cock, biting his lip to hold back the keen building in his throat.
“You have to give it to her, she can make an exit,” he said with a chuckle. Malfoy’s lips twitched. He stared at Harry, fiddling nervously with his wand. His skin had taken on a waxy hue over the past few months – his face resembled a patrician death mask, the only colour the pale pink of his lips, his furrowed dark brows, the dark silver of his eyes. Harry sighed as reality set in. This was not the dark knight he had made Malfoy out to be. He was a pawn, just like Harry, so easily discarded by the men playing their deadly game. “What’s going on, Malfoy?” he asked, trying to keep his tone as gentle as possible. “I know what you did to Katie. I know Voldemort’s making you do something.” Malfoy flinched at the name, and Harry frowned. “He is, isn’t he? Tell me, Malfoy. Please. Let me help.”
Hermione nodded. Draco could practically see her drawing up a mental note to research Pureblood marriage traditions later, and he had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. Harry frowned.
Harry reached up to touch Draco’s face, cupping his jaw as he looked up at him, green into grey. “Hey,” he said gently. “That’s for me to decide. Okay? Nothing under your shirt is going to scare me, unless you have a dark wizard stuck onto your chest that I don’t know about.” He smiled at Draco’s nervous chuckle. “I promise,” he said, before leaning up and brushing a chaste kiss against his lips. “I won’t get scared.”
“It’s okay,” said Harry, just as Draco said, “that’s quite alright.” Thunder rumbled in the distance. Harry pulled Andromeda into a one-arm hug as Draco, his arm around Harry’s waist, gave him a small squeeze. They looked down at the chalky earth, the dry soil punctuated here and there as the rain began to fall, slowly then in earnest. Teddy rushed over to them, his arms over his head to protect himself from the rain.
Harry woke up before Draco the next morning. He disentangled himself from the sheets and Draco’s arms as quietly as he could. He put on his glasses, grabbed his wand from the bedside table, and tiptoed out of the room, casting one last glance at the sleeping man in his bed. He smiled to himself. Then he closed the door behind him.
“Draco Malfoy is the new Potions Master,” he said, more slowly this time. Ron’s jaw dropped. Hermione, on the other hand, simply nodded.
“What I meant,” he said, interrupting Bathilde’s ranting and looping an arm around Harry’s waist, “is I’m his boyfriend.”
Pansy did come with him to a Muggle tattoo parlour to get the Mark and scars covered up, however. He had tried to go to a wizarding tattoo artist who operated out of his SoHo loft, but the man had turned him away the minute he saw the Mark. The Muggle artist, on the other hand, didn’t care, didn’t know what it meant. She and Draco worked on a design together. He figured out how to pay her in Muggle money and arranged a date. When the day came, he squeezed Pansy’s hand so tight during it that he was vaguely worried he might break it. For her part, she never complained, just squeezed back.
Harry nodded again. Still not meeting Draco’s gaze, he said, “I’ll just… get dressed then and go. You’ll never have to be bothered by me again.”
“It’s an improvement,” he said with as deadpan an expression as he could manage. Draco rolled his eyes but winced. Harry’s free hand fluttered uselessly, wanting to touch but not wanting to hurt. Kellen waved her wand over Draco, her lips pressed together in a thin line. Harry glanced at her with a raised eyebrow. Catching his look, she shrugged.
“Well, I heard a rumour, from one of the boys at Durmstrang – they played against us last year, remember? Well, one of them, Krum – his father’s a good friend of the family, as you know, they got us VIP tickets to the World Cup – well, he said, he caught Potter looking at him, after the game, if you know what I mean.”
Summer passed into autumn, and autumn into winter. Harry threw himself into his new life, into school and clubbing on the weekends, into football practice and memorising the London Tube. He tried to put all thoughts of the man in the manor out of his mind. When Ron called him on the landline in his dormitory, Harry sounded cheerful, excited by his criminology degree, by everything London had to offer. But when Ron asked if he was coming home for Christmas, Harry grew quiet. Then, he forced out, “Yeah, yeah, they’re kicking us out of the dorms over the winter hols, so yeah, yeah I’ll be back. Yeah, if that’s okay, tell your mum I should be done with classes around the twelfth or so. Yeah. Looking forward to it.”
“Oh, I’m a fantastic teacher,” Harry told him with a smug grin. “But it’s already almost halfway through the first term, so I’d have to wait until next year to even see if there’s an opening. Now that I’m gone, I’ve heard their Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers actually last longer than a year, so chances are I’d end up doing something silly, like Divination.”
“Obviously,” he sneered. It didn’t come out sounding as confident as he had planned and he cursed his voice for betraying him. Harry raised an eyebrow, so Draco continued, “It only make sense, doesn’t it? You have to….” He paused to lick his dry lips. Harry’s gaze flickered from Draco’s eyes to his mouth and back again. Circe, if he had been anyone else, Draco would have given in. As it was, he was not about to be attracted to Harry bloody Potter. “You have to keep an eye on the ex-Death Eater,” he spat at last.
“They’re just going to have to get used to it,” he murmured, pressing a chaste kiss to the corner of Harry’s grinning mouth. “Because I’m not going to let you go, I promise.”
The kettle whistled. Draco stood and went about filling a teapot, bringing it back to the table to let it brew. The smell of black tea, faint but earthy and floral when caught, hung in the air, mixing with the smell of the herbs drying above the stove, the cigarettes Draco had taken to smoking, and Potter’s cologne, cedar and black pepper. Draco took a deep breath, let it out. Potter watched him all the while, chin in hand, a lazy smile on his lips.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You would need that memory in court when you finally bring the perp to trial,” he argued. “Then everyone would see it.” Harry let out a huff. He hated when Malfoy was right.
Silence fell again, but this time, Harry could practically feel the arctic chill that had descended inside. Then, one of the other boys said,
Draco lowered the handkerchief, the blood flow stemmed for now. Black bruises stretched like wings under his eyes as he looked up at Harry. He reached and took Harry’s offered hand in his. “How bad is it?” he asked, his voice thick and congested. Harry pressed Draco’s hand with his.
He was thirteen – the hippogriff scars faded quicker than he thought, but he played up the pain, loving the attention it got him, wishing for someone else to notice and hating himself for it.
Draco looked up from chopping lettuce at the kitchen island as Teddy came into the kitchen. “Hello,” Draco said, turning back to his chopping. “What are you doing inside?”
“Fuck.” Draco fought to keep the smile from spreading across his face, but how could he, when faced with such reckless affection? “Fine. But you know what this means, don’t you?”
There was a whisper of cold air against his sweaty forehead. Draco knelt before him. Harry could see his mouth moving, and between one breath and the next, a switch was flipped, and sound came pounding on his eardrums.
“Harry, dear,” Hermione whispered with a sigh, looking up from one of the massive tomes she had scattered around her. “I love you, you know that, but sometimes you can be so dense. You probably said something without realising it hurt him, and the best thing to do is just apologise.”
Draco blinked and leaned back, his hand dropping back to his side. Harry breathed again. Draco cleared his throat and turned away, returning to his unpacking.
“Huh. Sounds posh. Mine was a Christmas gift after Eddie and I broke up last year. Ron got it because it says ‘FCUK Him.’”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry said, quiet but firm. “If you want it gone, we can look into removing it somehow. But you were just a kid. It doesn’t reflect who you are now.”
Neville raised his eyebrows. “If you say so,” he said, getting up and slinging his book bag over his shoulder. “If you ask me, it’s still weird to be sleeping in the same room as him, but if you want to be his friend, then that’s on you. Now come on, we’ve got Transfiguration in ten minutes.”
“My parents, much like Robards, didn’t approve of my, er, lifestyle choices. Except I also had a bit of a drinking problem at the time, so there was that as well.” His smile faltered. “Although, they definitely still don’t approve of the gay thing – if you thought I was verbally abusing you while we were at school, you should have heard some of the things my father said when I visited last Easter. First time in two years, and Father’s vocabulary has only improved.”
Draco blinked again, and they were standing on the Astronomy Tower, eighteen and exhausted. Potter ran a hand through his hair, the curls growing if possible more wild than before. Draco wondered if his hair was soft and fine, like his, or thick and coarse, tangling around his fingers. He clenched his fists surreptitiously, digging his bitten nails into his palms to ground himself.
“Sure you do. We’ve known the Greengrasses for years. Besides, there’ll be time to get to know each other after the wedding.”
“And you could have let me die in that Fiend Fyre,” Malfoy replied, “but you didn’t.” Finally, he sat down next to Harry. They looked at each other with new eyes, smiling tentatively as they put the pieces of their past behind them. “I never thanked you,” he said, “for giving me back my wand. Thank you.”
One in particular, a golden-haired elf with black eyes like polished stones set into his carven face named Baron LeStrange, regularly carried out ‘purges’ of his land – human men were hung from gibbets at the border crossings of Starling, human women were raped and sold, bastard half-elven children were sent away or, more often than not, left to die in the woods at the borders. The road to Starling had come to be known as Dead Man’s Crossing, or, privately, the Bloody Road, and the Baron nicknamed the Bloody Baron. Harry himself was not allowed into Starling, even with his necromancer status, but often visited the bordering lands to shepherd ‘foundling’ children to Hogwarts, itself a sovereign nation inside Albion borders, and laid the restless spirits of the hanged men to rest. Harry met the Baron’s cold glare across the room and scowled.
Harry held him tighter. He turned his head a little to press a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “We can deal with that later,” he murmured. Draco’s lips twitched, and the hand resting on Harry’s hip palmed the length of his waist.
Harry smiled back, tight lipped and awkward. Bread, meat and stewed vegetables were placed on the table, and for the moment food ameliorated the stilted air between them. Then, after several minutes of quiet chewing, the king looked up.
“What is this about, Potter?” Draco asked as he fixed his glare on a couple of third years in front of them who kept looking over their shoulders at the pair. The third years blushed and hurried off, leaving Harry and Draco far out of earshot of the group. Harry chewed his lip.
“You’re one to talk, Gregory. Didn’t my father help you get those charges dropped from the Greengrass girl? You know,” Malfoy’s dropped to an ice-cold whisper that Harry had to strain to hear, “the girl you roofied?”
Draco stood by the window, looking out across the grounds. He turned just enough towards Harry that Harry could see a faint, sombre smile on his pale lips.
Harry raced up the steps and skidded into Draco’s office. Draco barely had enough time to whip off his reading glasses and shove them under some paperwork.
“No.” Malfoy’s voice was barely recognisable, twisted and choked as it was. “No one can help me! I have to do this on my own! I have to….” But what Malfoy had to do was cut off by his own sobs. Harry pushed the door open a bit more, leaning in to look.
and he would forgive him. He sighed and stepped aside to let Harry in. “I will throw you out if you’re explanation is shit,” he told Harry as he came inside.
He opened his eyes. Harry was so close, he could see the faint laugh lines beginning to form at the corners of his eyes, of his mouth. Each breath was filled with cedar and black pepper and cigarette smoke from the balcony above. Harry’s upturned face was lit by the market lights strung up on the railing, softly glowing like a dying sun.
He knew then, as Harry’s rumbling chuckle filled his ears, that it didn’t matter that his body couldn’t, wouldn’t work the way he wanted it to. This was enough. Draco was enough for Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry and settled against him with a shaky sigh. This was more than enough, because this was love.
“There is someone,” Draco murmured, rubbing the snot from his nose. “Someone I care about. But he – they are on the other side of this stupid war. There’s no way they would ever – I could never – no, they can’t help me.  No one can.”
She called him up through his kitchen fire one evening after a particularly gruelling shift. “Draco,” she said by way of greeting. He nodded back and continued chopping vegetables.
Ron shrugged, still frowning at the spot on his knee where the problem thread stuck out. “I’ll try,” he mumbled. Harry grinned.
Harry shook his head. He shared a look with his reflection in the mirror. His reflection rolled its eyes. Draco had been getting ready for about an hour, and at this rate they would be late for breakfast with his mother at Malfoy Manor. Not that Harry was particularly looking forward to it. He and Narcissa had a better understanding than he had had with Draco’s late father, but that was all up in the air now. Harry, who was wearing black jeans and a maroon button down, was uncomfortable enough already. Christmas was for lounging around in Mrs. Weasley’s jumpers and pyjama bottoms, not formal wear. But Draco had insisted.
“At least they seem happy together,” she said. Ron shrugged. She turned her shoulders towards him, since moving her entire body was too much effort. “Why can’t you just be happy for them?” she demanded. Ron crossed his arms across his chest, his expression growing sombre.
“I am going to kill you, Draco,” Harry muttered as he buried his face in his hands. He felt more than heard Draco hum with a suppressed smile.
Malfoy shuffled in, still wearing Harry’s pyjamas, his white-blond hair mussed from sleep. He was halfway through the doorway when he noticed Kellen. He immediately straightened up and tried to look dignified, even with the pillow mark on his cheek and the pyjama bottoms that really were much too short for him. Harry’s stomach fluttered, which he decided he was not a fan of. Must have been too much coffee. He busied himself with the French press with a small frown.
“I will give you two some space,” said Dumbledore, getting to his feet. “Draco, you know what you need to do.”
Potter barked out a laugh. Draco’s smile grew, that awful warm feeling blooming in his chest the way it always did when he made Harry – no, Potter – laugh. Potter shook his head, still grinning.
“Seems pretty straightforward if you ask me,” sneered one of the Junior Aurors, a brash and over-confident young man named Jenkins with the swagger only good looks and privilege could bestow. He reminded Harry of McLaggen, so, on principle, he didn’t like Jenkins very much. “The son obviously got into an argument with his parents, snapped and tried to kill them before running away. Case closed.”
“Oh, so you trust the word of a toddler over the word of your best mates? Great, love that you value a five-year-old more than me and, for that matter, Hermione. I take it went well then, since Andromeda seems to approve – she was okay with it, wasn’t she?”
“As I said,” Harry leaned down and kissed the top of Draco’s head, “you owe me. Plus, Teddy will be there, and I want you to meet my godson.”
Harry let out a small, “oh.” He shuffled so that he knelt on the sofa next to Draco, his knees brushing Draco’s thigh, and held Draco’s face in his hands, making him look him in the eye. There was so much sweet affection there, so much blatant
She wiggled her hips and looked over her shoulder. “Nope,” she said, “just shut you up.” She cackled when Draco made a rude gesture in her direction and shut the door behind her.
Draco plucked at Harry’s jumper. “Take this off,” he whispered into Harry’s ear, nipping at it. Harry shivered.
“Hurry up, Potter,” he growled. Harry’s smile broadened. Instead of speeding up, he went almost impossibly slower, pulling Draco’s jeans down inch by inch. “Potter,” Draco warned. Harry just grinned. Draco kicked his legs, trying to get the jeans off faster. Harry allowed this with a small shake of his head, but when he settled himself between Draco’s legs, Draco knew his attempt to speed things along had come at a price. Harry kissed up one thigh, one hand brushing up the other side. Draco squirmed as his mouth neared his crotch, the hand on the other leg rubbing circles into his inner thigh. “Gods, please,” he whined, even as Harry pulled away to turn his attention to the skin above the waistband. He could feel Harry’s smile as his lips trailed along the elastic, could feel his breath ghosting over his cock, and it was driving him nuts. “Please just, Merlin, do something, fuck, enough teasing…”
Before they went through the Floo, Harry stopped Malfoy with a hand on his chest. “I go through doors first,” he told him firmly. Malfoy looked down at him, one eyebrow raised, and nodded. Harry pulled his hand back and turned away, grabbing a handful of Floo powder while repeating ‘be professional, be professional’ over and over in his head.
There were three more attacks that week. Humphries became one of a rotation of Aurors on guard duty during the day. Harry and Kellen poured over the evidence, trying to find a connection between the attacks, anything that could narrow down their suspects. So far, all they had to go off of was Malfoy’s description, the use of the Floo to get into his victims’ homes, and that the victims were all ex-Death Eaters. None of them had survived.
Harry shook his head. His shoulders slowly lowered from around his ears. “You’re – you’re not mad?” he asked her cautiously. Molly came over and put her hands on either side of his face with a loving smile.
“Yes,” Harry admitted, tousling Teddy’s hair, “he is.” He looked up at Andromeda, who raised her eyebrows at him. “I’ll explain later. But now, I think we should head in, alright?”
“Go on, then,” Potter whispered, daring him with his eyes, still glittering with unshed tears. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine, and it wasn’t from the chill. Distantly, he heard the clock chime one.
“In that case – definitely not. No, like I said, it would go a lot faster if it’s just the two of us,” Harry said slowly as he rolled back on his heels. “You were the one who was so adamant that you take this task on and get it done as efficiently as possible. What did you say to that sour-looking lord, Sir Elfy McElf-face – ”
There was a gasp behind him. Draco turned, but there was no one there. When he turned back, the stag was gone.
“Oh, c’mon, it was years ago! And besides,” he set his spoon down and turned around in Draco’s arms, pulling himself closer by Draco’s narrow hips, “no one is prettier than you.”
“Read to me? It’s the last chapter,” Harry said with a hopeful smile. Draco beamed. He took the book from Harry and propped himself up against the pillows. Harry nestled in beside him, one arm slung across his waist as he rested his head against Draco’s chest.
They both turned. Lucius, haggard and gaunt but alive, strode across the hall towards them – towards Draco. He reached his hands up in supplication, in disbelief, a confused smile twisting his lips but not meeting his steely eyes.
“This,” Draco whispered, his voice rough, “this is really happening, right? This isn’t a joke, is it?”
Draco nodded, his stormy eyes weary but resolute. Harry sat back to let him get up and make his way towards the bathroom. He did look amazing in just his black briefs. “You’re gorgeous,” he called after him. Draco raised a hand in acknowledgement.
Harry looked over at the silver cat, who was sitting back on his haunches at attention, more alert than Harry had seen him in weeks. When Harry turned back to Kellen, it was to flickering green flames. Harry bit his lip, then strode out of the room, calling over his shoulder, “Stay here and keep an eye on the Floo, get me if anything happens.” He heard a distant chirp behind him as he ran up the stairs to the guest room.
“What did you do?” Draco asked the fire, his voice small and timid like a child’s. Blaise’s expression softened as he, too, turned to look at the dying fire.
Hermione shrugged. “Not yet,” she replied. Then she turned on her heel and went back to her fortress of books on one of the common room tables, leaving Draco with more questions than ever.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked, crossing his arms over his annoyingly broad chest. Auror training had only highlighted his already rugged features with defined muscles and a lean frame, leaving Draco to wonder if the universe was ever going to hurry up and get to the punch line of this cosmic joke. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco’s eyes seemed to ice over. He pressed his lips into a thin line. “Right,” he said. “Good for you.”
“Circe’s tits, what happened?” Draco asked. There was a crease between his thin eyebrows that made Harry’s stomach do a weird flip he couldn’t explain.
“Does Weasley know you’re here… with me?” Draco added, looking down at his whiskey. Harry bit his lip. There was a softness to Draco’s voice he had never heard before, and instinctively he wanted to protect it, covet it. He took another sip of his beer.
“Bloody hell, Harry!” Ron blurted out. Ignoring Hermione’s admonishing, “Ron!”, he added, “You’re not dating the git, are you?”
Later that night, after the feast and long after everyone had sloped off to bed, a small origami crane flew into Harry’s four-poster and landed on his chest. Harry sat up, picking the crane up and unfolding it as he reached blindly for his glasses and wand. Glasses on and wand in hand, he shut the curtains before casting a soft
He arrived at the Manor through the drawing room Floo, after making a quick stop for coffee at the stand in the Ministry Atrium. He only had a moment to take in his surroundings – the rich furnishings, the marble floor, the memory of Hermione’s screams and a dagger hurtling through space – before the officers at the scene descended on him and carried him towards the dining room. Harry stood in the doorway for a moment, clutching his coffee, breathing deep to centre himself before the memories swept him away.
Malfoy’s astonishment was quickly replaced with weary acknowledgement. “Right. Well.” He cleared his throat and gestured out to the hall, “I’m going to take a shower and, er, get ready for bed, I guess.”
“Not in my world, you’re not,” he shot back. Harry was too tipsy to ask him what he meant. “And I’m a bloody ghost, Harry! If you’re going to kiss anyone, kiss that girl giving you doe-eyes downstairs! Or any boy in your school who won’t punch you for being gay! Anyone but – ”
Harry pulled away, his brow furrowing. “Since when do you speak French?” he demanded. Draco shrugged.
But then Draco shifted, coming to stand between Harry’s legs, his hands running up Harry’s thighs, skimming his jeans so lightly, so afraid to actually touch in case he was rejected. Harry had to stifle a shiver. Draco looked up at him through his lashes, gauging Harry’s response, always so careful. Harry licked his dry lips, stomach tightening as Draco’s gaze followed the movement. He leaned closer, and Harry’s eyes fluttered closed.
“Oh, Malfoy, were you the one coordinating this little coming out party? How thoughtful. The boys and I would love to join, if that’s alright with you.”
Harry’s bark of laughter startled a nearby witch, making her spill champagne on her dove grey gown. He and Draco, whispering and giggling like children, finally ended up at Ron and Hermione’s table, where Hermione’s reproachful look only made them giggle harder.
“Oh, actually, I was just going to say,” Harry said, distracted in his search from the glasses and turning his attention back to Draco, “I might go over and see them in hospital, so I might be late for dinner tonight. Do you want me to just meet you at the restaurant?”
Harry laughed. “Alright, I’ll send him an owl. I should go, anyway, do adult things around the house like laundry and all that.” He stood shakily. Hermione got up and gave him one last hug. She watched him go, returned his wave as he stepped through the flames. The minute he was gone, she summoned her purse and ran off to the library. Research called.
But when Harry joined him on the hearth, Floo powder in hand, Draco hesitated. Harry sighed. He gave him a kiss on the cheek and offered Draco his arm. Draco looked at him and smiled timidly as he took Harry’s arm.
Draco’s brow furrowed as he turned back to Harry standing behind the breakfast bar. “Cupboard?” Draco asked, the word forming hesitatingly in his mouth as if it was something foreign. Harry nodded and took a sip of his whiskey. “What are you talking about, Potter?”
“What’s the point in that?” Harry snapped. It was like someone was bashing an iron stake into his skull and he squeezed his eyes shut. “I’m not that Harry!”
“To what do I owe the pleasure?” he asked by way of greeting. Parkinson cocked an eyebrow at the formality, but Crabbe, always the brighter of the two, didn’t seem to notice. He was still glaring at Harry.
Draco frowned, his shoulders hunching in as he leaned forward, bony elbows digging into bony knees. His mother hadn’t said anything about how thin he had become, only pursed her lips and pushed a plate of mince pies towards him during tea. But he couldn’t bring himself to eat much. For the task he was set, what he was meant to do – he didn’t deserve to eat, to indulge in food and drink. He was a would-be murderer, and murderers didn’t deserve to feast.
Harry cocked his head to one side with a small grin. “Yes, I suppose I did. What, do you not like it?”
“Well, yeah,” Harry replied. He leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms behind his head. “If we’re going to be friends, it only makes sense that I know what you like.”
Harry levelled his gaze at Jenkins, his lips pressed into a thin line. Jenkins grew uncomfortable under his scrutiny, but raised his chin nonetheless in an attempt to appear authoritative. Kellen raised her notepad to hide her smirk.
Draco shrugged, cradling the book in his lap. “I quite like Tolkien,” he said, a defensive edge to his words. “Pansy, of all people, came across this set while in Paris last winter, from that little shop, Shakespeare and Co. Sent it over as a Christmas and a ‘Congratulations You’re Out of Azkaban’ present.” His lips tilted into a soft smile as his fingers traced a pattern into the clothbound cover. “I read them all in the span of a month. Then I got the rest of his works and read them as well. Mother teased me about it, said she’d never seen me read so much in my life.” He chuckled, but the laugh faded even as it left his mouth. “The stories gave me hope,” he said, mostly to himself, and blushed. He put the book away in his messenger bag, refusing to even glance in Potter’s direction. But then he heard,
“Right. Good. Okay then,” said Draco, even as everything inside him shattered. Harry looked up one last time. Draco wrapped his arms around his waist to hold himself together even as the broken look in Harry’s eyes made him want to drop to his knees and sob. No, please, he wanted to plead, don’t listen to me, don’t leave me, stay, for gods’ sake, stay. But instead, he turned away, stared out at the garden lit by the hazy city dawn. He heard Harry heave a long, heavy sigh.
Harry’s head snapped up. He would know that voice anywhere. And there, on the landing, wearing all black and rubbing his shin as he scooped up his scattered books, was a young man with white blond hair and soft grey eyes. Harry’s jaw dropped.
Malfoy arrived the next morning during breakfast. He came into the teacher’s lounge where they ate outside of term time looking, to Harry’s surprise, hesitant, as if he was going to be told off for being there. McGonagall stood as she greeted him and gestured for him to take a seat. Harry saw Neville shift uncomfortably in his seat next to him. Malfoy gave McGonagall a tight-lipped but grateful smile and sat down, pulling in his chair before looking around at the other teachers. He gave Neville a small nod, who returned it with a hesitant smile. Then his eyes landed on Harry. It felt like hours before Malfoy turned to greet Charms professor Klingle, and Harry was able to breathe again.
“Which means that we’ll be having a party just for the seventh and eighth years this Saturday, starting at eight p.m.,” added Neville. He bounced on the balls of his feet and nervously rubbed his hands together as an excited murmur spread throughout the common room. Draco, who had been leaning against the wall near the stairwell, looked over to where Potter sat in the corner by one of the narrow windows. He frowned – Potter wasn’t even paying attention. Instead, he just stared out at the rain beating against the glass, his chin in his hand. Neville and Hermione were fielding questions – would it be fancy dress, could they bring friends from other years, etc. – and didn’t seem to notice their despondent celebrity. Draco pushed off the wall, ignoring Astoria’s attempt to draw him into a conversation about matching Hallowe’en costumes, and edged around the room towards Potter.
“Well, your track record from the past several years, for one thing,” he pointed out. He settled back into his corner, his ankle crossed over his knee as he rested his arm along the back of the sofa. He looked Harry up and down, quickly at first, then slow and languid, taking his time to really consider him. Harry blushed and instinctively crossed his arms over his chest, shifting so that his back was against the armrest and his drawn-up knees leaned against the back cushion. Draco pursed his lips, hiding a smile. “So? Are you? Not straight?”
“Sorry,” Harry lied, his eyes twinkling mischievously. “You’re probably never going to see them again.”
“The, er, living room is just down the hall,” Draco said, letting go of Harry’s hand and gesturing towards the back of the house. “I’m going to put the kettle on, do you – do you want tea? Coffee?”
“You still live at the townhouse?” Harry asked, his lips brushing Draco’s ear. Draco nodded. He turned and pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple. “Take me there,” Harry murmured. “Please.”
Harry, fifteen and still growing into himself, had grown quiet. The cosy room at the top of the second tallest tower – the tallest being reserved for the astronomers – suddenly fell cold despite the merry fire in the grate. Harry shivered and looked out the window to the lake, where his friends were helping the half-giant Hagrid feed a host of grindylows that had been forced out of their native loch and relocated to Hogwarts. The sorcerer, his blue eyes sharp even as he smiled kindly at Harry, leaned forward across the book-strewn table.
Draco looked down at the gifts in his hands, then smiled sheepishly at Harry. “Er, no. Not exactly.”
Draco looked up at him as if Harry had asked if he was joining the circus. “The world knows you are here, Potter,” he said slowly. “It was in the Prophet years ago.”
“I will have a chat with the Headmaster. Cannot hurt to try,” Malfoy mumbled as he passed. Harry, who had never been this close to Malfoy without the other boy hitting him, tensed. Malfoy was already gone, though, and he had to force himself to relax. The smell of peppermint lingered for several minutes after Malfoy left the room.
“So needy,” he mumbled, but complied nonetheless. Harry moaned as Draco squeezed Harry’s arse with one hand, explored beneath Harry’s jumper with the other. Harry tilted his head to one side, letting Draco kiss along his jaw, suck love bites into his neck. He closed his eyes and held on for dear life.
“Enjoying the décor?” Malfoy asked with a hint of his old sneer. Harry put his wand in his pocket as he considered his response.
He tapped the nib of the quill against the parchment as he pulled his lower lip against his teeth. Hermione turned the parchment around so he could have more space to write, one eyebrow raised as she studied his face. Harry let out a huff, then wrote,
A week passed since the attack at Malfoy Manor. At Harry’s insistence, Robards let Kellen be the lead investigator on the case, so long as Harry continued to supervise her through her first case as lead. But even the two of them working together could not make head nor tail of the case.
After that, they spoke briefly about what Malfoy could expect from the start of term, his duties as Head of Slytherin, and whether Malfoy would like to have tea again tomorrow after breakfast.
Harry hummed. Malfoy had taken off his apron, giving Harry a chance to appreciate how well Malfoy had filled out after the war, the thin layer of muscle over the bones. Malfoy noticed him looking and raised an eyebrow.
Silence fell. Hermione nodded a few times to herself as she mulled over Draco’s words. A pocket of sap crackled and popped in the fire. Harry brought their joined hands up to brush his lips along Draco’s knuckles, his magic slipping a warm tendril around Draco like an electric current, warm and tingling against his waist.
He kept an eye on Malfoy as often as he could that term. When Katie Bell was cursed, he told McGonagall that it was Malfoy, to no avail. He told Dumbledore during their first ‘lesson’, but Dumbledore only smiled and said that if Harry had proof, then he would happily listen. Unfortunately, Malfoy telling him he was sent by Voldemort wasn’t hard enough proof. When Ron was poisoned, Harry met Dumbledore’s gaze across the hospital bed and glared, silently demanding Dumbledore to do
“I’ve never been happy to get a death threat before,” said Draco with a grin. “But if Scorpius here hadn’t dropped onto my doorstep, who knows what would have happened to him.”
“When was this map made?” he asked, cutting the king off in his report. King Draco blinked, taken aback. The two guards at the door leading back to the throne room exchanged a look. The attendant, who stood just out of arm’s reach, pinched the bridge of his nose with an audible sigh. Harry didn’t notice any of this, focused as he was on King Draco, waiting for an answer.
Malfoy flinched at the name. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Then Malfoy uncrossed his arms and shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers. “Then what are you going to do?” he asked, his eyes flicking to the locked door before looking back at Harry, as if expecting someone to rip open the door and proclaim him a traitor.
Startled, Lord Rookwood glanced back at Baron LeStrange who, Harry noticed, gave a minute shake of his head. Judging by Draco’s stormy glare, the baron was not as subtle as he thought.
Harry sighed and ducked his head, trying to school his face into any other expression. He bit his lip, dragging the soft skin against his teeth. When he looked back up, Malfoy blinked furiously, the blush creeping into his cheeks as he looked down at the table. Harry frowned but didn’t have the time to puzzle that out.
The words, more honest and vulnerable than Draco had intended, made the smile disappear from Potter’s face. His brow furrowed. He set his arm down on the table, leaning forward seriously.
Harry’s lips were soft and dry. Before he could even begin to appreciate this, however, something sparked through him like lightning, followed by the sudden and uncomfortable feeling of being tugged by a hook behind the navel. When they opened their eyes with a gasp, they were still in Harry’s kitchen, Draco’s head still cradled in Harry’s wonderful warm hands. But the world seemed to have shifted beneath their feet, as if they had been caught in each other’s orbits, like magnets finally finding their pole. Draco could breathe easier, a weight he never knew existed lifted from his shoulders. From Harry’s wide eyes and glowing expression, he felt the same.
After class, Harry went down to the dungeons. He hadn’t been there since…well, since sixth year. He avoided them at all costs, and never had a reason to go down before. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was going to run into Snape at any minute, especially as he stood outside of what used to be Snape’s office. Now, though, there was a simply engraved plaque that read ‘D. Malfoy’ on the old wooden door. Harry squared his shoulders and knocked, but no one answered. He tried again – nothing. Finally, after waiting around as long as he felt he could, he pulled out a piece of spare parchment and a self-inking quill and wrote: ‘hope everything’s okay. See you tonight,’ not really knowing what he meant by that. He slipped the note under the door and hurried back up to his own office. The minute he left the dungeons, he could almost feel Snape’s ghost dissipate behind him.
“Anytime, mate,” Christian was saying. “If any of those buggers bother you or Harry, you come to us, alright?”
Harry sniffled, his brow knitting together in confusion as he rubbed at his eyes again. “W-what? Soulmates aren’t real, they don’t exist, that’s just… it’s a silly thing people say, it’s not real.”
“I’ll be right back, okay?” Harry said as he took a few steps towards the lift, not taking his eyes off Draco, as if afraid – afraid that if he blinked, Draco would disappear. Draco gave him a timid smile, another nod. Harry beamed. He held up a hand, another reminder for Draco to stay, before turning and jogging off to the lift. Before he went in, he looked back over his shoulder, and this time there was no mistaking the relief, the unbridled joy in his eyes. Draco raised a hand in a wave, didn’t lower it until the doors slid closed and the lift shot off into the depths of the Ministry. Only then did Draco sink down onto the edge of the fountain. Only then did he realise he was trembling.
Harry pressed his lips together as he nodded. “What do your voices say?” he asked, soft and gentle. Draco hated when he used that voice. He would do anything for Harry when he used that voice. Draco shook his head and took another sip of his tea, even though it was still too hot.
Ron and Hermione wanted to call. Kellen handed him a long letter written in Hermione’s neat and tidy script along with their twice-weekly re-supply box. Harry set the box to one side and read Hermione’s letter as quickly as possible.
“Not particularly,” he grumbled. He still held his cup with both hands close to his lips. He sighed. “But knowing you, you’ll want to talk about it.”
“You were just a baby at the time, so you probably don’t remember her,” he continued. “She’s Victoire’s aunt, Ginny. I started dating her while we were still in school, but we broke up a couple years after the war ended. It was the same situation, I loved her but just not in the way she deserved. I told her that I was bisexual, she assumed that there must be someone else, then, and before I knew it, she was gone.”
“No, no you’re not.” Harry reached for him, and for the first time, his hands didn’t pass through the other man. Draco’s shoulders were warm beneath his hands. So was his neck, his jaw, his scalp as he tangled his fingers in Draco’s silky fine hair. And when Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, they were solid and strong against his waist. They leaned their foreheads together, breathing each other in. Draco smelled like the soap he had used the day he died – citrus and mint. Harry smelled like sweat and dust and pepper, and Draco grinned, because he could smell him, for the first time in years.
Potter nodded. Draco waited a moment longer, then stood up and made his way up to their room, ignoring the Greengrass girls’ attempts to get his attention. He didn’t want to try and coordinate outfits with them at the moment – he had seen the way Astoria looked at him, and he didn’t think he could bear it tonight. One day, he promised, he would tell her. But not tonight.
“Ron,” Hermione scolded, slapping Ron’s shoulder. “Be nice. I’m sure he’s changed over the years,” to which Ron muttered, “Ten galleons says he hasn’t.”
“Yeah. Months ago.” He looked down at his shoes, kicked at a small stone, watched it skitter across the path. “Our relationship fell apart, and we didn’t know how to put it together again.”
Harry picked at the label on the sweating bottle with a sigh. “No, I know, I’m sorry. I’m just not used to you being nice to me.”
“‘Aragorn led them to the right arm of the river. Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen….’”
“ – what my life has been like these past few years! I’ve been perfectly happy here, I have my job, I know who I am here. Here, on my own, I don’t need you.”
They walked up the path to the house, their shoes crunching in the gravel the only sound in the muffled winter air. Draco kept fidgeting and readjusting his grip on the presents. When Harry offered to carry them, Draco shook his head and clutched them protectively against his chest, insisting that he could carry them just fine. Harry sighed and shrugged. He suspected that the presents were Draco’s back-up plan in case things did not go well.
memories to remember him by. The Healer’s gave him a year, maybe two. Thanks to your brother, he got six months. And I am sorry, for everything my family and I have done to you and your family, but that doesn’t mean any one of you can play God with our lives. So please, please, just listen – I am sorry. For everything. But Harry was just doing his job, and I am just trying to do right by him.”
Harry chuckled. “Well, we can work with that. I’ll need to get in contact with my superior, fill him in on the situation. In the meantime, you can stay here, I have a spare bedroom and I can lend you something to sleep in.” He got up and made to clear away the tea things, but Malfoy stopped him, one hand stretched across the table towards him.
“You’re silly,” Teddy snickered. Draco’s expression melted into such sweet affection that Harry felt his breath catch in his throat. Teddy got off Harry’s knee and reached towards Draco’s head. Draco, very confused by this turn of events, initially pulled back, then warily lowered his head towards the no doubt sticky toddler hand. Teddy petted Draco’s hair in awe. “It’s so pretty!’ he exclaimed. Draco made a face, unsure whether or not to take the compliment. Then, Teddy screwed up his nose, and the black curls he usually wore around Harry turned into a white blond mop. Draco’s jaw dropped.
Good question. The Poet urged him on, but Logic was shaking its head, telling Draco to shut up, shut up now. Draco cleared his throat.
I wish that were the truth, dear reader. But there is a second ending to this story, and this, I’m sad to say, is what really happened that day.
Potter blinked – he apparently hadn’t been paying much attention either. He looked up from his examination of the floor and said, “Er, dare?”
“You really do look just like him. You even have the same scar, except his is from surviving the killing curse while yours is from the car crash. He was also sent to live with his aunt and uncle, but they lived just outside of London, and when he was eleven Harry came to Hogwarts. But of course, you’ve heard my stories about St Harry – or, rather, St. Potter. I never called him by his first name, and he never called me by mine.
Malfoy inclined his head towards her, even as he muttered under his breath, “You always call your partner by her full title?”
“I don’t know if it will,” Draco sobbed into his shoulder. He pressed his face against Harry’s tear-soaked shirt, against the solidness of him, breathing in the smell of black pepper and cedar.  He wanted this, he told himself, he wanted this so badly. But wanting something wasn’t always enough.
Draco took a sip of his coffee to hide the sappy look he knew threatened to spread across his face at that. It was indeed perfect – Potter had already added the sugar, which paired so well with the chocolate undertones of the coffee. Last night’s eavesdropping replayed in his mind. He bit his lip and set the coffee down as Potter took a seat. Potter pulled out the notes from their meeting yesterday, but before he could start, Draco blurted out,
“She was meeting me at St. Mungo’s so that we could go out for tea and just so happened to run into him – he was a Healer there – so, technically, she met him.”
“Damn,” Draco whispered. He took Harry’s thick cock in his hand and began to stroke it, long and firm. Harry’s mewls were muffled by his hand over his mouth. But when Draco licked a stripe along the underside of his cock, his moan could not be contained. He dropped his hand and let the sounds come unchecked as Draco took him little by little in his mouth. He tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair as he began to bob up and down Harry’s length.
He fell silent again. Draco’s frown deepened. “As much as your eloquence is impressing me,” he said in an attempt at his old drawl, “I fail to see how this answers my question. Why are you helping me?”
Draco let him take control this time, and Harry, pleased that his position straddling Draco’s hips gave him the slightest of height advantages, eagerly took the reins. Draco kept his hands on Harry’s waist, but Harry was having none of that. “Touch me,” he murmured into their kiss. Draco smirked.
“It was bound to happen at some point,” he said. “Either I came here, or you would come bang down the door to Grimmauld Place. I just had the wards reset, so I decided to come to you.”
Out in the courtyard, Harry sat on one of the cold stone benches, his knee bouncing as he tried to distract himself by watching the other students mingle. They all looked so young, and yet there was a shadow hanging over them, muting their chatter and laughter in the chill November air. A few simply stood in front of the memorial stone set in the middle of the courtyard, reading the names of all that had fallen in the Battle. Harry huddled in his jacket as he tapped his fingers against the edge of the bench. Over a year later, he could still recite every name on that list.
Harry’s usually open-book face suddenly shuttered, growing cold and distant. Draco steeled himself, even as his stomach sank. This was for the best, he told himself. For both of them. A clean break.
Draco stood there, long after the pad of Harry’s footsteps drifted away, and the crack of his Apparition faded into the early hours of the morning. He stood there, watching the pale sunrise creep into the garden, where the daffodils nodded their heads at him. He stood there, until the tears on his cheeks dried and each breath didn’t break his ribs apart. Then he turned away.
Ron considered this, twisting his lips into a comma. “Yeah, I am,” he said finally. “You apologised years ago, mate. You’ve worked hard to be who you are now. You’re a better man than your father. I wouldn’t be friends with you if you weren’t. As for Harry, well…” He gave Draco an impish smile. “Let’s just say I shared a dorm with the man for six years, and seen him drunk off his tits on more than one occasion. He may still think it’s a secret, but I’ve known he’s liked men for years. Now, he finally gets to explore the other side of bisexuality. And if he gets to do it with anyone, then I’m glad it’s with his soulmate.” He paused. Draco looked away, trying to collect himself as much as he could. Then, Ron asked, “What’s it like, anyway, being soulmates?”
A half hour later, Kellen had gotten all the information she needed. “We’ll need to come up with a proper witness protection plan with Robards,” she said as she gathered up her supplies. Harry nodded from where he sat at the end of the table, nibbling on a piece of toast he had nicked from Malfoy’s plate. Malfoy, however, frowned.
“This seemed easier,” he replied. “Besides, I might be shorter, but I am a heck of a lot stronger than you.”
Draco’s gut twisted. “Do-Do you want to talk about it?” he asked. Harry shook his head, his eyes already closing in exhaustion. He unhooked his glasses and tried to set them on the bedside table but missed. Draco caught them just in time before they fell and placed them delicately on the table. Harry watched him with one eye and raised his eyebrows. Draco blushed. Harry only closed his eyes with a sigh.
Draco exhaled sharply through his nose, an almost laugh. In his mind, he was fourteen, listening to Blaise tell him a story, the image of two olive-skinned boys running through a dark forest, away from their past and their future.
One brisk October evening, sometime around midnight, Draco found himself climbing the steps to the Astronomy tower. Realising where his feet were taking him, he became more convinced that that was exactly where he should go. He could confront at least one of those pesky memories right there and then. But when he got there, he was not the only one.
Draco chose one of the beds at random, flicking his wand so that his luggage flew over to it. Harry picked the bed exactly opposite with a smirk. The next day after class, they came back to find all the beds but their chosen two had vanished. That’s when it set in for Draco – it was really happening. He was rooming with Harry Potter.
“Kill me softly then,” he murmured against Harry’s temple as he placed another kiss there. Harry shook his head but dropped his hands with a sappy grin spread across his face. He turned as Draco’s arms wrapped around him and whispered against Draco’s lips,
The curtains shut, the silencing charms back in full force. Draco, shaking, looked over at Harry, although in truth he didn’t need to – he felt Harry’s magic without needing to see his wand pointing at the portrait. It crackled like lightning around him, setting his wild black curls on end. Fury shone bright in his eyes, his jaw tensed as he glared at the curtains, as if daring them to open again. Here was the Saviour of the Wizarding World in his avenging rage. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine. He held onto the banister with both hands to stay upright as he felt his knees start to give way.
Draco put his hand on Harry’s lower back, rubbing it in small circles, little apologies and ‘I love you’s in each one. Harry looked down for a moment. He took a shaking breath. When he looked back up, Teddy had sat up and reached out to take one of his godfather’s hands in his. The three of them stayed like that, their touch saying everything. Then, there was a crash, and the sound of James’s raucous laughter echoing down the hallway.
Malfoy stood by the bed, not taking his eyes off the fireplace. He was a little taller than Harry, and the pyjamas were just a bit short on him, revealing bony ankles and pale slender arms. It made him look strangely young and vulnerable, especially with his wet hair dripping onto his bony shoulders. Harry cleared his throat as he entered. Malfoy jumped. When he saw it was Harry, he relaxed and returned to his watch of the fireplace.
“And as I said last night, no,” Malfoy stated. This close, he towered slightly over Harry, even though there were only a couple inches of difference in their height. Harry set his jaw, his grip tightening, fingers pressing against Malfoy’s pulse point. Both their heart rates seemed to jump in the same moment. Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment as he took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes again, he continued, slowly and clearly, “I don’t want people having access to my memories.”
Draco swallowed. He hated the shiver that ran down his spine at the sound of his name on Harry’s tongue. This close, he could smell the other boy, pepper and spice.
So, a couple days later, Harry knelt by the hearth of the kitchen fireplace with his morning cup of coffee, eagerly awaiting his friends’ call. Humphries, once again on guard duty in cat form, stretched out across the files and paperwork Harry was meant to go through later, covering them with fur.
to hurt you, all three of you.” Harry squeezed his hand. Draco lowered his head to look at their joined hands, chewing his lip and tracing the scar on the back of Harry’s hand with his fingertip –
Draco shrugged. “Want to tell me what happened?” he asked. Harry rubbed his eyes before taking another long drink of his tea. Draco handed him his glasses, which he accepted gratefully. After hooking them on, Harry smiled at Draco.
Back at Grimmauld Place, Harry laid Draco down on the guest bed – Draco’s bed – and propped him up with all the pillows he could find. He tossed his Auror robes onto his long-abandoned cot bed and rolled up his sleeves. Then he helped Draco out of his robes and his dress shirt so he could assess the damage. He inhaled sharply through his teeth. Black and blue bruises covered Draco’s pale ribcage and bloomed across his waist and stomach. Draco leaned his head back against the pillows with a pained breath.
He turned the page to the table of contents, where each chapter was dedicated to a different wizarding family. He trailed his index finger down the list, turning the page as it continued in alphabetical order, passing Black, Longbottom, Lovegood and Malfoy. His finger froze when he found it.
Later, Harry would regret not asking more about the argument between Malfoy and his parents. But in that moment, all he did was thank Wilkins for his time. Then he went back up, checked in with Kellen, and Floo’d back to the DMLE. After hours of pouring over the case file with Kellen, he was no closer to an answer. His only hope was that Narcissa would wake up from her coma and be able to tell Harry what happened.
“It’s got to be some highly trained assassin,” said Kellen as they stared at the board covered with their notes and evidence photos. Her Auror robes were draped over her chair, and she was wearing a fashionable navy sailor’s uniform, complete with high-waisted trousers with golden buttons and a little white scarf tied around her neck. “Someone who can get in anywhere undetected.”
“So, Malfoy,” he said, trying to think of something to talk about. Malfoy looked up from spreading apricot jam across his toast in faint surprise. “Er, how was the trip up?”
“Harry?” His voice was so soft, so gentle, but it broke Harry’s heart like a hammer. Harry shook his head, almost fell over as the back of his knees ran into the chaise lounge. He reached behind him, not taking his eyes off of Draco as he felt for the windowsill.
Hermione suppressed a squeal, her hand over her mouth, her eyes crinkling as she beamed at him. Harry couldn’t help but grin back, even as his whole face flushed and he had to look away to pull himself together. He turned back at the scratching of quill on parchment.
“Hell no, I love it. Wait.” His eye caught another flash of ink. He turned Draco’s arm over, expecting the Mark. Instead, there was a bouquet of flowers, narcissus, lilies and irises blooming across the faded skull and serpent. Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He traced the flowers with his fingers. Draco’s eyes fluttered closed at the gentle touch, only to open again with a gasp as lips replaced fingers and he looked down to see Harry kissing each and every flower, so sweetly and tenderly that he felt tears prick at his eyes. Harry looked up at him, his breath ghosting across Draco’s skin.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be fine,” he said quietly. He straightened up just enough to give Draco a quick kiss. “I love you,” he whispered against Draco’s lips.
“That doesn’t mean you don’t work.” Draco looked up at Harry, who squeezed the hand he was holding against his chest as he gave Draco a small smile. “It just means you work differently. That’s okay. Different is okay.”
With one last skeptical look, Harry shifted closer to Malfoy, and slipped his hand into Malfoy’s trouser pocket. He felt Malfoy shiver at his touch. He barely stifled a shiver himself as his fingers slid across the warm muscle of Malfoy’s thigh covered only by the thin fabric of the pocket. Then his fingers found something round and flat. His eyebrows knitted together. Pulling it out and holding it in his open palm, Harry’s mouth opened in a small ‘oh’. It was a sobriety chip.
Harry hummed. “The group from Beauxbatons back in fourth year really did help my bisexual awakening,” he admitted as he stirred the vegetables and prodded at the rice and lentils. “I couldn’t decide who was prettier, the French girls or the French boys.”
“Don’t look like that,” he chided him. “I’ve known you since you were a snotty eleven-year-old. You don’t have to hide around me.”
“You thought I was joking?” Harry spluttered. “Of course I was serious! Why would I joke about this?”
Ginny snapped around to face her, eyes as wide as dinner plates. “And you think that’s okay?” she hissed. “They could have killed each other by now!”
At that moment, the door opened. A house elf, who looked an awful lot like Dobby did back in Harry’s second year, stood in the doorway, shivering in the cold air. He smiled politely at Draco, but when his large tennis-ball sized eyes landed on Harry, he gasped.
“Wha’ is it?” Draco mumbled next to him. He pushed himself up into a seated position as he blinked blearily at Harry. Harry swallowed, trying to even his breathing out. His mind began to catch up to his panic. The room became familiar once more, the pale moonlight illuminating hulking, forbidding shapes and turning them back into armchairs and cloaks hung up on closet doors, blurry and indistinct without his glasses. Still struggling to deepen his panting breaths, he looked down at the sheets tangled around him, his brain trying to reconcile his reality with his nightmare. He had apparently dislodged a sleeping Draco when he had sat up. Draco positioned himself half behind Harry so that he could wrap his arms around Harry’s waist, tugging him back down into bed.
“Nah, I just have never come that hard before,” Harry said. He waved his hand, sending a cleaning spell skittering across their sweaty skin, taking the spent condom with it. Draco thought about complaining – he never liked the way cleaning spells felt, like scrubbing with a dish cloth – but he was too tired. He nestled against Harry’s chest, and, with Harry’s hands running down his back, his magic like a warm blanket settling against his sweaty skin, fell into the deepest sleep of his life.
Narcissa dropped her teacup. It bounced off her lap and crashed onto the marble floor, tea and porcelain flying everywhere. Draco winced and closed his eyes. Harry flicked his wand, repairing the cup and mopping up the tea from the floor. He bit his lip as he glanced back and forth between Narcissa and Draco. Narcissa was as white as a sheet as she stared in shock at her son. Draco looked like he wanted to melt into the floor. Harry moved his arm from the back of Draco’s seat, taking the other man’s hand in his instead and giving it a gentle squeeze, only for Draco to grip it so tight Harry thought it might bruise.
“Maybe he has! But has he ever done anything to make amends for any of it? No!” She slammed her palm down on the table for emphasis. Harry looked away, biting back his protest. “It’s been ten years since the war. In all that time, has he reached out once? Before this case, did he ever contact you to say, hey, I was a bigot and a bully, but I’ve changed? No! He came to you when he needed you, nothing more.”
Draco gasped. He licked his lips, his eyes searching Harry’s face. “I – I thought…” He trailed off. One of his hands came up, fluttering near Harry’s cheek, wanting but afraid to touch. He swallowed, Adam’s apple bobbing as he tried again to form the words. “I didn’t realise you liked me,” he whispered. Harry frowned.
“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Malfoy,” he whispered to the silent room. “I couldn’t save you the way you saved me. But I promise, I will try to find your son, and when I do, I will do what I can to protect him for you.”
“Yeah, mate, but that was one week. You’ve been gone almost a whole month,” Ron argued. He was trying to grow a moustache and Harry made a mental note to tell him to give it up – it made him look like he had no mouth. “Does this have anything to do with those murders of ex-Death Eaters?” Ron asked. “We’ve been following it in the news. A real mystery, that one.”
While Harry put the kettle on to boil, Draco opened cupboards until he found the mugs, picking out the bright orange Chudley Cannon one for Harry and a pristine china cup for himself. He plopped tea bags into each and turned away from the counter to set them on the table. The sight that greeted him almost made him drop the mugs.
“I trained as a Healer before I became an Auror,” she explained. Then, to Draco, she said, “It probably feels worse than it is. You have a broken rib, but from I can tell it’s a small fracture, it’ll heal on its own. No internal bleeding, but the bruising will be extensive.”
“I will,” he whispered. He gave her a crooked, secret smile. “We always do, he and I, somehow.” Without another word, he was gone.
Harry made a strangled noise but Draco ignored him. He gestured for Hermione to continue. She took a deep breath – Draco braced himself, pulling his and Harry’s joined hands into his lap.
A few weeks later, the Wizengamot released their decision to pursue an anti-discrimination bill, declaring Harry and Hermione’s case a victory. Robards was indicted, but ultimately released, much to their dismay. But, as Draco pointed out as Harry ranted about it for the fifth time that week while they moved the last of Draco’s boxes into Grimmauld Place, “Two steps forward, one step back is still progress.”
“I’m not!” he snapped back. “I just asked why you think there’s anything going on! It’s not like you came in on us with a dead body, we were just standing here!”
He pulled off the Cloak and jumped down, one hand already going to his wand but not pulling it out just yet. Surprise flickered in Malfoy’s grey eyes, but he quickly smoothed it away into his trademark sneer. He didn’t go for his wand. Harry hesitated for a moment, then relaxed, tossing the Cloak onto the seat behind him.
Harry’s eyes widened only briefly. Then he burst out laughing. Draco, who had frozen when the words had slipped involuntarily from his lips, let out a cautious laugh before joining in more whole-heartedly. They giggled, their cheeks red and tears building in the corners of their eyes as they clutched at the stitches in their sides.
The attendant gasped, horrified, and Harry jumped slightly. He had forgotten about the other elf. But King Draco only scoffed and again waved his hand, silencing the attendant’s indignation.
Teddy gave them both a watery smile. “You guys are the best,” he mumbled. He wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand. Harry and Draco gave him one last squeeze before pulling away, Harry’s hand still on Teddy’s back as they sat with him. “I just don’t know what to tell Victoire. Like, I get it, it’s a lot. But I don’t want her to think that I’m breaking up with her just because of all this, you know? I do like her a lot, and I want to stay friends, but…”
Draco was silent for a long time, processing this sudden revelation. Then, he whispered, “So you know who I am? About my family?”
Robards closed the door after Harry and gestured for him to take a seat in front of the massive desk. Harry sat down warily, fidgeting with the buttons of his uniform. Robards let out a long sigh as he settled himself in his office chair, staring across the desk at Harry over steepled fingertips. A middle-aged man with greying black hair and sharp black eyes, Robards was someone Harry had come to look up to during his training and now as a uniformed Auror. His stomach sank at the prospect of what was to come.
Harry barked out a laugh. Then he took Draco’s hand that was still hovering just centimetres from his face and leaned his cheek into it, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he smiled up at Draco. “And you say I’m an idiot,” he teased. Draco giggled. He glanced down at their feet before looking back at Harry tentatively.
“The last one’s new,” Ron joked with a grin. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs, but even she was hiding a smirk. Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.
“Does he know?” Ron asked. Draco, startled by the gentleness in Ron’s voice, looked back at him, confused. Ron, still leaning his chair back, nodded his head towards the window. “Have you told him?”
“And what did you think of Arnold’s counterargument? I found her points particularly fascinating – ”
Harry shrugged. He chanced a glance up at Malfoy and was surprised at the gentle smile he saw there. He smiled tentatively back. “So, er, are you seeing anyone?”
“Please. Thank you, Potter.” She sat with a sigh. Harry busied himself with setting the kettle on the wood-burning stove in his office and pulling out the tea things, already reaching for McGonagall’s favourite cup. It was Friday afternoon, the week before term started. It was routine for them at this point after five years – she would come to his office, he would ask if she wanted tea and she would always say yes, and they would talk about the upcoming year, mainly in terms of the Gryffindor Quidditch team’s chances for the Cup. As much as she thrived as Headmistress, Harry suspected she missed being head of Gryffindor house and being able to cheer for her house team. Being impartial was not her cup of tea.
“No,” Harry promised. “I won’t leave you.” But Draco was asleep. He pulled him close with a sigh, his heart so full he thought it might break. He fell asleep with a soft smile, happier than he had been for years.
“Like what you see, Malfoy?” he asked in a tone both teasing and alluring, enough to make Draco shiver as he tightened his grip on his whiskey. Draco took a sip as he thought over his options.
“So are you two…friends?” Hermione asked tentatively, looking from Harry to Draco and back. Ron appeared to catch up with the conversation and narrowed his eyes at Harry again.
, because what it comes down to in the end is understanding that the War of the Ring is only one thread in this greater tapestry.” Draco sat back with an exhausted sigh and took a swig of butterbeer, only to make a face because it had grown warm. Harry sniggered.
“Come here,” he murmured, before gathering Draco into his arms. Draco buried his face in Harry’s scarlet Auror robes, his hands gathering fistfuls of the fabric to hold himself up. Harry smelled of masala, but Draco didn’t mind, too busy letting all of Harry’s emotions wash over him, as he knew his were washing over Harry, waves crashing against the rocks of their bodies.
“Wait a minute, then follow me.” Draco got up, setting his glass on the table and draping his peacoat over the crook of his arm. Harry watched him slip off into the depths of the pub, his eyes following his white blond hair as he wove through the drunken crowd yelling at the Quidditch match on the telly. Harry swore under his breath. Then he got up and followed him.
“Why’s that?” Harry asked. Wilkins looked down at his pink-gloved hands for a moment. His pale eyes were shifty when he looked back up.
Harry and Malfoy both snickered at this. Dawkins’ brow furrowed, but Harry waved him off, pulling his expression back into something more professional. Dawkins sighed. “Fine. Cuff him and Side-Along him back to the department. We’ll need to take his statement in any case.” He shook his head and muttered something under his breath that sounded like, “I’m getting too old for this,” before Disapparating with the officers and Ivanovich, leaving Harry and Malfoy alone once again.
Then it was time to talk to Narcissa Malfoy. Harry had thought that they were just going to Floo call her, but Draco insisted on having the conversation in person, so it would have to wait until the next day. This made Harry very suspicious. That night, as they lay in bed together, Harry pulled away and looked Draco in the eye.
An hour later, after checking through all of the evidence, Kellen agreed that George could be a suspect and should be brought in for questioning. “Just questioning, mind you,” she said. “We don’t have enough for a warrant beyond circumstantial evidence and conjecture. I’ll go with a team over to his place, and keep you posted on how it goes.” She grabbed a fist full of Floo powder, one foot already back in the grate.
“Your birthday present,” explained Lucius. “I meant to give this to you for your seventeenth birthday, but – well, I never had the opportunity.”
“Don’t you think you do it on purpose?” she asked him. She had dragged him to one of the new wine bars that had started to pop up. This one was owned by a witch that bore a striking resemblance to Professor Trelawney, with her layered beaded necklaces and silver bangles announcing her presence as she moved about her clientele. He and Pansy sat at a high-top table in the corner, sharing a bottle of Zinfandel while Draco bemoaned the fact that he was going to end up a crazy cat lady for the millionth time. “You date men that are a good shag,” she continued, “but that’s it. Why don’t you try to find someone who actually
Harry leaned back in his chair, pushing it back in his chair, pushing it back to balance on two legs. He couldn’t tell her about the memories Draco had shared with him, they weren’t his to share, so how could he explain it to her? That there was a freedom in the way Draco moved when he was with Harry? That with each soft touch, like the brush of fingertips on his arm when Draco wanted to get his attention, they built their own unspoken language? Or that the first night they spent together, tracing old scars and memories mapped on their skins, each kiss was an apology, every caress a plea for forgiveness? That night, they had broken down in each other’s arms, both sobbing, “I’m sorry,” until the words became unhinged from their meaning. He cast his gaze around the kitchen, and saw Draco everywhere – in the herbs hung to dry above the stove, in the half-drunk bottle of wine on the counter, the cupboards Draco had reorganised in a fit of cabin fever after declaring Harry a heathen for keeping his potions ingredients with his spices. There were pieces of Draco everywhere in the old house, so unlike the clean slate of a flat Draco called his own. Harry smiled to himself.
Still, Harry didn’t answer, frozen in confused silence. Malfoy tsk’d and threw up his hands, running one through his perfectly styled hair with a scowl.
Malfoy wasn’t at dinner. Nor was he there the rest of the night. He wasn’t at breakfast the next morning, or lunch, or dinner. It rained the whole day, bitter and cold. Harry spent most of the day in his office trying to grade papers, but spending most of it watching the rain rattle against the windows, wondering if Malfoy was alright.
He wiped furiously at the tears building in the corners of his eyes. He could feel Hermione’s gaze on him, heavy and pitying, and he bit down on his lip, desperate for the pain to focus him, as it always did.
The next morning dawned cold and bright. Harry woke up to Draco handing him a cup of milky tea, still wearing his silk pyjamas. He sat down next to Harry as he accepted the tea and propped himself up against the pillows, inhaling the smell of bergamot and black tea. Draco took a sip of his own tea as he watched Harry.
Draco swallowed hard. “Why should it?” he asked. “We have jobs. Lives. We can’t just give all that up because….” He gestured wildly and vaguely between them. “We have… commitments, and I just… can’t.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. Harry didn’t look up. Draco made his feet move and all but dragged himself to the couch, sitting as far from Harry as he could. The couch was lower to the ground than he thought. He half-fell into the cushions, sinking deep into the corner even as he tried to right himself. In the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Harry’s lips quirk up in a smile.
But every week, at least once, he would find his feet taking him back to the small church in the wooded clearing, if only to hear the hymns one more time.
Ron frowned. He picked at a loose thread in his dress robes – a much nicer tweed set than the maroon ones he wore to the Yule Ball, if still a little worn. Harry let out a long breath through his nose and sat up, uncrossing his legs and leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. “Ron, you’re my best mate,” he said quietly. “Just do me this favour and try to not hate him? For me?”
“But we are protecting him,” Dumbledore argued. He did not look away from Draco’s bowed head. “If Voldemort knew young Draco here had betrayed him, we might as well place a target on his back here and now. If, instead, we play along, he has no reason to suspect him. You see, it is the only way. He won’t have to kill me, simply make it look as if he had.”
“London.” Harry frowned when Draco nodded and turned away, moving to go and sit on the sofa. “I thought you’d be happy for me.” The words sounded childish even as he said them, and Harry immediately wished he hadn’t said anything, but Draco waved him off.
After his speech, Andromeda was quiet. She studied Harry, her own gentle magic searching for any signs of coercion or deception. Harry let her. He spread his arms wide, adding, “You’re not going to find anything. I’m not under his spell. I genuinely like him. And he, amazingly, likes me, too.”
Draco was already at the pub when Harry arrived at 8:01pm. He was sat at one of the tables near the balcony overlooking the Thames, chin in his hand, watching the fog roll over the river. Harry took a second just to look at him. He was wearing a black jumper and charcoal grey jeans, his white-blonde hair swept back, a thick peacoat draped over the back of his chair. There was something like worry in the knit of his brow, the tiny frown tugging at his lips. Harry took a deep breath and made his way over to him. Here goes nothing.
“It’s a map,” Potter explained. And indeed, there was Hogwarts unfolding on the parchment, complete with individual names floating through it, a little Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter standing in the Astronomy Tower. “My dad and his mates made it when they were in school,” Potter continued. He tapped the parchment with his wand and murmured, “Mischief managed,” and the ink sank back into the parchment, leaving it smooth and blank.
Draco scoffed again and looked away, out the window. Harry had disappeared again behind the hedge, but he had never needed to see Harry to know where he was. Ever since that time in third year when Harry had pelted him with muddy snowballs from beneath his Invisibility Cloak, Draco had trained himself to sense Harry’s presence. Maybe it had been the Soul Bond all along, and now that it was awake, it only heightened Draco’s Harry-sense. But Draco liked to think he at least had a hand in some of it.
Father Nicola was quiet for a moment. Then, with a small nod, he whispered, “You’ve chosen well, my son. I will leave you now. I’ll be in the back if you need me. Besides, I think you need to save our Saviour from old Bathilde.” He gave Draco’s arm a squeeze before walking away to a small door in the back of the nave, leaving Draco to rescue Harry from the crone waving her gnarled arthritic finger in his face.
Harry rolled his eyes but nodded. “No, I get it, this is definitely something I know about. Right. Teddy, you need to tell her.”
EDIT: I can't do maths. Ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts would be 2008, not 2018. So same-sex marriage would not have been legal in the UK, wizarding or otherwise.
Draco’s white knuckled grip on the watch threatened to crush it to pieces. “That’s not why,” he gritted out through clenched teeth. “Surely Mother’s told you.”
“Well,” she said, setting her herbal tea back into its saucer, “it looks like we owe you an apology, Harry.”
“Sod off,” Harry laughed. Draco couldn’t help his own grin. It had been a while since he’d seen Harry so happy, or heard him laugh this much. His excitement was contagious.
“The truth is,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “you don’t choose it. You just know that you’re not like everyone else. For me, it never really mattered until – well. Until I met Harry. Not you, obviously, my – er – it sounds weird to say it, but my Harry.” Draco huffed out a laugh. “He was never mine, though. Unlike you, he never was – at least, I don’t think, although maybe, he never said, never… Anyway. Erm. The first time I met him, we were, er, getting fitted for our school uniforms, and he was just this… scruffy looking kid, but for some reason, I really wanted to impress him. I wanted to be his friend, but he didn’t, and we very quickly became enemies. As we got older, though, I realised that there was something else. All the boys were talking about girls, all the girls were talking about boys, and I… all I could think about was Harry. But of course, that was never an option.”
The first couple weeks of terms passed in a blur. Harry had half-forgotten what it was like to be in school, to have to study and do homework. But after a few jarring days, he had settled back into his old routines and patterns, with one exception.
He leaned against the backwall, pressing against cool stone, unnoticed by the congregation. The hymn came to an end, and the people sat back down in their ancient pews, faces upturned to the priest in the pulpit, raised only a few steps above his flock. The priest must have been about his father’s age, but his brown eyes were gentler, his skin olive-toned, sun-kissed. He reminded Draco of another boy with golden skin and gentle eyes, with the same mop of unruly black hair and way of smiling that made you feel like you were always in on the joke. But where the boy was slight, green-eyed and bespectacled, the priest was tall, his features more patrician than bony. Another boy came to mind – a boy whose family was feared in Italy but little known in England, who had a large nose and revealed sharp teeth when he grinned, easy and undaunted. But there was something more grounded, more level-headed to this priest than Blaise, who was about as steady as a fox in the night. Draco decided he liked this priest, whose sermon, it seemed, revolved around loving the seasons in equal parts – “for without the heat, nothing would grow, but without the rain and the wind of autumn, we would not miss the long days of summer.”
Harry’s hands shook. He balled them into fists, his nails digging into the flesh of his palms. He took one deep breath, then another. Anger rose like a thundercloud in his gut as the shock began to fade. Robards frowned as his bookcase and the blinds on the window looking out across the bullpen began to shake. Pieces of paper began to lift up into the air. The smell of burnt hair and electricity filled the room.
“Everything’s fine,” Harry reassured Draco. He stood. Draco, a small crease between his brows, frowned at him but nonetheless said his goodbyes as Harry wrapped his arm around the taller man’s waist and steered him away. Draco looked back at Hermione and Ron over his shoulder and gave them a confused little wave as they walked away.
Malfoy nodded once, his lips pressed into a thin line, but Harry could see the smile lingering at the corners of his eyes. When Harry came into the guest room a few minutes later, laden with an extra quilt Molly had made him as a housewarming gift, Malfoy was already curled up under the covers. Harry let out a slow breath and made his way over to the cot, only to find a book resting on top of his pillow. Harry set the quilt down and picked up the book.
Narcissa wavered, her face drawn and pale. Then she stepped forward and pressed her wand into her son’s hand. Draco’s eyes widened. She gave him a tight smile.
Without fully realising what he was doing, he reached out and brushed his knuckles along the sharp cut of Draco’s cheekbones. Draco jumped slightly at first, before relaxing into the touch. Harry’s stomach fluttered as he switched to trailing his fingertips along the sweep of his jaw, down the curve of his neck. Draco swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. He didn’t meet Harry’s gaze at first. Doubting himself, Harry made to pull away, to apologise.
“This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me,” he whispered, “and Pansy literally let me sleep in her bed after I got kicked out.”
“I thought you said we had to be in and out. Come on.” He picked up his luggage and made his way to the living room. Harry stared after him.
“Isn’t he married to that Weasley girl?” Draco asked. He took a long sip of his wine to settle his twisting stomach. Pansy scoffed.
Ron’s eyes followed Draco’s every move as he sat down on Harry’s other side. Draco ignored him and leaned over Harry to ask Hermione if she had seen the news about the recent tests of a new experimental potion at St. Mungo’s – the two had miraculously bonded over a shared intellectual curiosity that often left Harry third-wheeling in the conversation. He gave Draco a look and received a confused eyebrow raise.
Luna giggled but continued on, dusting her finger along his palm. “You have a lot of faint bow-shaped lines, so you’re optimistic but not that optimistic, happy but not as happy as you could be. Then there’s your fate line – it’s deep, prominent, and forked. Your life will be controlled by fate, and you will have some public recognition pre-ordained from your childhood or past worlds. Huh. Your intuition line is deep and well-developed where it cuts through the mound of the moon. Do you ever feel like you can predict things, or see things others can’t, or do things you can’t quite explain?”
Harry shook his head, frowning at the carrot he was peeling. “No,” he said, his voice low. “Somehow, I don’t think he will.”
Ron and Hermione nodded and stood, soldiers trained too young. Soon enough, they were one and Kellen was stepping through the flames. She closed the connection behind her, and before she could ask, Harry said,
“To be fair, I think I kissed you first,” he pointed out. Draco’s returning smile was watery, shaky at best.
“Why do you think I’m here?” He turned so that he too was facing Draco, but it was a long moment before he looked up and met Draco’s gaze. His expression was timid, uncertain, so unlike the confident Gryffindor that Draco inhaled sharply through his teeth. Harry fidgeted, shoving his hands in the pockets of his Quidditch robes as he tried to find the right words.
“You’ve never brought a lady home since the Weaselette? God, Potter, I pity the state of your love life.”
Draco pursed his lips. He looked down at Harry’s hand still holding his and covered it with his free hand. When he looked back up, he gave Harry a small smile.
They stood, Draco never taking his eyes off his mother, but as they made to go, Narcissa suddenly reached out a hand to her son, her fingers just gripping his sleeve. Draco inhaled sharply.
“Good lad.” Another pause. “I was named, as is the tradition in my family for all first-born boys, after our greatest ancestor. Although, I’ve been told, he’s not actually that fond of the whole thing. But when you’re related to someone like Nicholas Flamel, you want the world to know.”
“Yeah? Oh hey. Yeah, I’m out with Ron and Hermione and everyone. Okay. Well, we’ll go over that tomorrow, alright? I know, I know, it’s my turn to get the coffee. Black, right, with two sugars? Cool. Yeah, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Harry didn’t come back to the manor at Midwinter. He almost didn’t come when Beltane rolled around. But when the day came, and he was on his way back to the Dursley’s after school, he found himself turning away from the well-ordered streets and towards the valley where the crumbling building stood, stark stone against the green vale. There was a chill in the air, but the days were lengthening, and daffodils were golden in the green earth. Harry shivered as he followed the old overgrown lane. He argued with himself even as he squeezed through the drawing room window, trying to convince himself to go, to go back to the Dursley’s, where he would inevitably hide in his room without supper to avoid the snide remarks and cracking knuckles of his cousin.
Harry dropped his hands back into his lap with a groan. He laid down, stretching out his legs and staring at the peaked ceiling. He liked Ron’s attic room. It gave the semblance of privacy.
“You really do like me?” he murmured. Harry turned his head and pressed a kiss into Draco’s palm. When he turned back, Draco’s beaming smile struck him like lightening, stopping his heart in his chest.
Malfoy’s lips pressed into a thin line. “No,” he said. His voice became soft, if only for a moment. “It’s just covered up. They have a no tattoo policy here.”
Before he could answer, there was a roar and a flare of green flames in the kitchen fireplace, and they both sprang apart in time to see Ginny stepping out of the grate, brushing ash off her jumper.
“We should go back to the dormitory,” he said at last, gesturing at the stairs. “Try to get some sleep.”
“I had the same thought,” she said. “But for the sake of anonymity, they redacted the names from the official report. There was a note, though, that they weren’t able to study the pair further because… well, one was sent to Azkaban and the other was deemed not suitable for the study because… well, because he was a werewolf.”
“Victims are middle-aged white male wizard, Lucius Malfoy, and middle-aged white female witch, Narcissa Malfoy. Attack is believed to have occurred between 9:30am and 10:00am this morning, after they sat down for breakfast and before the house elf came in to check on them.”
Scorpius hopped onto the bed a little while later. He was only momentarily surprised at his human not only being in bed at noon, but wrapped in the arms of the other human. Then he sat down at the end of the bed with his tail curled around his front paws. He twitched his ears. This was fine, he told himself. He approved of this one. This one would not hurt his human.
Harry looked away, deflating. He knew she was right. And technically, he was supposed to be supervising her, he should know better, set a good example. He nodded and waved her off. “Right. Well, good luck then. Keep me informed.”
A few moments later, they stepped out of the fireplace into the atrium of the Ministry. No one noticed them at first, everyone too absorbed in the extravagant winter scene that had been recreated inside the space. Draco looked around and let out a small laugh.
So Harry set the letter-writing set aside, shaking his head with a smile, and picked up the book. The smell of leather was strong, as if the book had only recently been bound, and there were no words embossed on the spine or cover. Harry opened it curiously to the front page. He let out a soft gasp as he read:
“Because,” he said, “it’s Malfoy. That git has been tormenting you and your friends for years, me included. Why the change of heart?”
“Parkinson here wanted to throw us a little coming out party,” Harry told him. He crossed his arms with a smirk. “Figured I’d invite you all to come and join.”
“I…I’ve been given a task,” he said, picking his words carefully. “And I’ve tried, tried to carry it out, I know what I have to do, I just… I can’t do it.”
Father Nicola shrugged one shoulder, his eyes on Harry and the elderly woman as Harry tried, weakly, to explain that he wasn’t her nephew, even as she beat his arm with her purse, demanding to know why he didn’t visit more often. “Many people in our world believe in him, too,” Father Nicola said at last. “It’s easy to worship an idol.”
