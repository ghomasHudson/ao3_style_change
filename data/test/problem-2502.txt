Harry looked around. "I suppose I should have realised that," he said. He stood up and went to the window. "It really is an amazing view. Which way are we facing?"
Draco laughed hollowly. "I think you must have missed the bit of my story in which I explained that I
been with them I've never asked them about their relatives."
THE END
This caused a burst of surprised whispering from many people, and Draco and Harry both smiled. "That already tells you that he's no longer the same Draco Malfoy that I was at school with," Harry went on, "but that's not even the biggest change in his life. I mentioned that he'd been studying; most of you won't be aware
"Ah. I’m sorry. And what made you realise?"
"Well, I promise to only cheer for Slytherin during the actual

"You're like a demonstration of how to eat properly," he commented. "I know I
“I need to get back to the office, sorry,” said Harry, as they got back to the foyer of the college. “But I’ll see you tonight, OK? Shall I come to yours again, or do you want to come to Grimmauld Place?”
"I can't help wondering, though," he said. "I hope you don't mind me asking, but... what

Harry blushed. "Erm, yes, actually, but I'm a bit scared to ask you," he admitted.
Ron and Harry looked at each other and burst out laughing. "
"I think so," said Hermione. "Just a bit of indigestion. You know how he always eats too fast."
"Hermione, please can we worry about the cat mystery later?" demanded Weasley. "
"Not quite," said Hermione. "But he did move away. He’s lived up in Manchester for years."
"Enjoying being head of Magical Games and Sports, are you?" asked Harry wryly.
"I find it fairly unlikely that any of your ideas are stupid, because
would think it odd if we mentioned them."
that you told us about him, but you were quite mysterious about exactly why that song reminds you of him. I mean, it’s not as if you’ve been in a war, is it? But when we tried to get you to explain, you didn’t, but you did tell us a few things about him.”
Harry looked somewhat embarrassed at this. "Please, call me Harry," he said. "And, you are very welcome."
Harry looked at him, puzzled. "Depressing? Christmas decorations? I've never heard them called
"Hello, then, Draco," said Harry, smiling, and held out his hand, getting his first proper look at Draco while they shook. He was wearing a chunky Fair Isle sweater and jeans, and he’d definitely aged well. Not quite as pointy, Harry decided.
"I believe it's a shopping mall, actually," Draco told him.

"Oh well," said Draco. "I've managed without you all these years; I should be able to wait another day. If I do a lot of wanking, anyway."
"Harry asked if I could wear green if possible, actually," Rabia confided. "He didn't explain why, just that you'd like it. And I've been wanting an excuse to buy a new dress, so how could I refuse? Although, I doubt anyone'll be looking at me. Have you seen

Teddy shrugged. "Should be."
. He dashed to the Great Hall and bolted down a plate of pasta and a couple of slices of parkin, deciding to take his glass of water back to the DADA classroom with him so that he could gather his wits before the next class arrived.
"I think she's changed too, actually," said Harry thoughtfully. "And I'm not sure why. Although, I suppose, just like she doesn't know what we went through last year, we don't really know what
notice. All Apparitions anywhere near Auror residences are monitored for security purposes. And they may not pay much attention to most of them, but if you don't think they'd recognise Harry's magical signature, you're the one who's mad. He's managed to hide himself from the wizarding world for almost two years – why would he give himself away now?"
"It looks FABULOUS," Harry assured him. "And I like that you're not wearing a tie. It'd be too formal for tonight otherwise, but the open-necked shirt is perfect."
, my beautiful girl? It's looking good, isn't it?"
"The Geminid radiant is… well, I can't remember exactly, but Gemini's almost due south right now, so it must be somewhere around there." Harry shuffled around until they were both facing south and spooning, with Harry in front of Draco.
"Come in," said Draco. "Would you mind if I quickly got dressed? I'd feel a bit more comfortable. I'll be as quick as I can."
Sorry for the long gap. Other things got in the way! I
know the truth, that's all I'm bothered about. The kids are welcome to their fantasies of you. I'd rather have the real thing."
"Well, that was the problem, really," said Hermione. Draco could tell his confusion was showing on his face, but at that point Hermione stopped, and Ron grabbed her arm to keep her upright as her feet were about to slip again.

transplanted, is it?"
He'd managed to cheer Teddy up on this occasion by suggesting that they go to visit the famous Christmas markets in Manchester; Harry suspected it was the side-along Apparition that was the main attraction rather than the markets themselves, but was ready to take any positive result he could get. They'd wandered round and looked at lots of the stalls, although there were many more in every directions; Teddy had been complaining he was "starving" for the last few minutes, so they were now examining the food stalls.
"Well, that’ll be something. Right, I suppose I’d better go. I need to try and sleep. See you at the Ministry at nineish?"
"Maybe I've been saving the world in
"I don't think I've ever been called a potion before, but I've certainly been called far worse things, so I think I'll accept it," said Draco, laughing. "Have you finished eating? Because, if so, I have a suggestion about how we can spend the evening."
A very short one tonight, sorry, mainly because I jinxed myself by saying that the prompts were finally being helpful – I was totally stumped by having to suddenly get
"That sounds perfect," said Harry, smiling. "Thank you. I'd love to. Of course, you do realise that the first thing I'm going to be asking is how and when you learned to cook, right? Unless you've actually got house-elves in your flat?"
"I hope so," said Draco. "He's a great kid. And it's good to meet you too, after all these years. I've thought a few times about getting in touch, but never quite dared – I didn't know whether you'd want to know me."
Hermione and Ron looked at each other, with Hermione raising her eyebrows again. "Oh, go on then," said Ron eventually. "If Teddy survived the experience and enjoyed it, I don't suppose they can be all bad. I'll come and see for myself. We do have quite a few things on in the evenings, though, don't we? When are we free?"
"That is correct, Draco," said the disembodied head in the fireplace. "I know you've not been inside the castle very much since the war, so you may not have realised how much of it is still in ruins. We rebuilt the vital parts quite quickly, of course, but there just wasn't enough money to fix the... well, the

"My parents decided to start the new year by going to live in our villa in Italy – they’d had enough of the English weather – and Julian assumed I’d be moving back to the Manor. We’d been there a few times to visit them, of course, and it seems that Julian was looking forward to living there after we were married. When I explained – again – that I’d moved up here because I had such bad memories of that place, and had no intention of ever living there again, he… well, there was quite a row, and he moved out that very night. I’ve seen him out on the town once or twice since, but we haven’t spoken."
"The worst thing is when every single sentence ends with one of them saying
"If I WANT?" Harry shouted. "Ginny, the fact that it obviously never even occurred to you to think about Draco makes me wonder why I stayed with you as long as I did. But I don't think I ever realised you could be this heartless. So, thanks but no thanks. This bond has made me happier than I ever dreamed I could be, and it's not even a week old yet, so I have no wish to mask it. Unless...
"Hmmm. I
Short one today (and no cliffhanger), due to RL getting in the way. Tomorrow should be better.
Prompt 8: Stag Patronus
"I'm sorry about Ginny," said Ron, as they waited. "I thought she'd have got over it by now."
Harry stood motionless in the garden, too shocked to move. After a minute or two, he looked down at himself, and then laughed quietly. He wasn't sure whether he was laughing because he'd actually looked to check he wasn't invisible, or because he
"Sorry. If it's any consolation, I'm totally full too. I should have stopped ages before I did. But I've always been in the habit of eating every scrap of food that's put in front of me. It was a survival tactic when I was little, because my aunt and uncle used to starve me. I should try to change my habits now, though, really."
"Well, it did," said Harry. "So, thank you again, and let's try not to dwell on it. It's in the past, and it all worked out OK in the end."
"Let's see… I've got enough food and stuff for a while, so don't worry about that. A torch, though, with a red bulb. Or an ordinary torch with something red covering the bulb."
means 'please', but it also means 'you're welcome'."
"And did you discuss what you'll do in the future?"
," Draco told him, closing the oven door and sitting down. "I don't recommend it. But there's a thing on at college tomorrow and we're all supposed to bring something."
"It would be my pleasure," she said, coming to stand nearer to the circle of desks. "One... two... three..."
"Hmm. Just a cat, then. But obviously quite a special one." said Granger.
Harry looked puzzled. "Why? You've been teaching forever. Surely there can't be anything to worry about by now?"
"I’ve never been to a football match," Harry admitted. "I’ve seen quite a few on TV, so I do know who the best teams are and stuff like that, but I’ve never really followed a team."
it was the right spot. He looked around him; there was no sign that anything had ever happened there. He let out a shuddering breath he'd been unaware he was holding.
"That's mainly our fault," said Hermione, "because we were idiots, and didn't realise that although we spent a lot of time with Harry we weren't really listening to him properly. The thing I'm most grateful to Draco for is that he made the three of us realise what was wrong."
"Look at all those birds!" said Harry. "With the massive beaks and throats. What are they called again?"
him win, of course.
The next morning, Draco was woken by the pleasant smell of bacon wafting up the stairs. He lay in bed for a few more minutes, taking in his unfamiliar surroundings. The bedroom was tiny, containing little more than a double bed, wardrobe and bedside table. The curtains were open; he realised he hadn't closed them when he'd gone to bed, partly because the room was so dark anyway, but mainly because he'd been too tired to do anything other than pull off his clothes and collapse.
"I'm looking forward to finally being able to watch one of your matches, I must say. All three of last year's matches were during the Beauxbatons terms. I hadn't realised James Potter was a Chaser, though. I was sure Potter's kids would all want to be a Seeker like their father."
," he sang, in a surprisingly pleasant baritone.
Harry sighed, but couldn't resist reaching up and stroking the cat. It definitely approved of this, emitting a steady, surprisingly loud purr, and Harry was sufficiently encouraged to try stroking the front of its neck. It promptly lifted its chin and stretched languorously, but after a minute of this, it turned and walked a few steps along the fence before looking back at Harry.
"I know that," said Harry. "But 'as good as' isn't good enough. I want the proper ceremony. I want to show people that I'm
"It's a Christmas miracle!" said Harry, grinning. "Now, do you want to stay for some food? We haven't eaten yet."
. Harry banged the door knocker, and a moment later Ron appeared.
"James is calmer – in fact, I think he's actually pleased," said Albus. "I suspect this is what he's been hoping would happen. He's glad it's finally sorted out. Lily and Hugo were a bit upset at first, but James explained to them that it would be better this way, and they're both OK now. And Rose says she'd seen Mum with Dean a few times and had guessed something was going on, but didn't like to say."
just saying that, actually, but I have a feeling it will be a while before I can convince you of that, so let's change the subject. You were going to tell me about why you left the wizarding world."
"It's starting. Shush," said Draco, but Harry was sure he could see a slight blush on his face.
"Ooh look, it's starting!" said Ron. They all turned to see the silver fox darting around the sides of the street and jumping on particular bricks; every time it landed, a sparkling light started spinning round, each one a slightly different shade of blue or purple.
"Oh, don't you dare," said Harry, with a big grin on his face. "You are

"I was going to apologise for that, but I see yours is as unhelpful as mine," said Draco, spotting Harry's gaze. "The human body, eh?"
Draco kissed him, and then sat back and looked at him. "I can't believe I'm here," he admitted. "Thank you."
with that choir at short notice? I was memorising bits of it the day we met?"

and, after a year of absorbing all sorts of music via Draco, he had a much better idea of what was good and what wasn't.
As he debated whether he was bothered enough about the smell to ask to use Ron and Hermione's shower when he reached their house or whether he could bear to wait until he got home, he felt a feather-light touch on his head. For a moment he thought it had started to snow again, but when he looked up he saw a black cat sitting on the fence next to which he had been lost in thought. It stared at him with yellowy-green eyes, then bent its head to sniff his hair again.
“Um, let’s see - I have a security meeting at Gringotts at four o’clock, but those don’t usually take long, so I should be home by six. Oh no! Wait, I forgot.”

"I think that could be arranged," said Draco. "Wait, come
"That's what I always tell him," said Hermione. "But he always just says he likes Yorkshire puddings and there's no law against it."
There is lots of food, and a bit of nostalgia.
"Well, I do live in Manchester, and they’re the biggest local team. Do NOT say what I know you’re about to say," said Draco sternly. "It’s an urban legend, and it isn’t true, and it
"Go ahead," said Draco. "Listen, I... well, I normally sleep naked, but you'd probably feel better if I put some pyjamas on, wouldn't you?"
"Let's see… party hat… plastic reindeer… oh, good, a joke. What did Adam say on the day before Christmas?"

"Well, that's easy enough to solve," said Harry. "We'll both go! That way we'll be spending all our time with each other

"So… it's

Harry, who was walking faster than Draco, gradually vanished behind a dip in the ground; when Draco caught up to him, though, there was still nothing visible other than grass. But then Harry waved his hand, and a very small tent appeared; it clearly wasn't tall enough for Draco (or Harry for that matter) to be able to stand up inside.
Malfoy smiled. "Fair enough," he said. "Short version: I'm trying to memorise the tenor part to four choruses from Handel's Messiah. I'm singing it in a concert tonight, and I was only asked to do so this morning, but the choir are doing four of the choruses from memory and I don't want to spoil things by being the only singer looking at his score."
"You don't owe me anything," Draco told him. "I enjoyed that just as much as you did. But I'm not going to object if you want to get competitive about it. Either way, you should get in the sleeping bag before you freeze to death."
The crowd in the pub, it turned out, was thinking the same thing, and within a few minutes Draco's name was being chanted, until he stood up, bowed, and went over to have a quick word with the DJ before taking the mic.
"It's from a show called
"Slightly TMI, guys, but thanks for adding to my wank fantasies," shouted Rabia, bowing with them.
"Yes, but I'm not sure where I can put it," said Harry. "Could you…"

Another short one, sorry. This week is
He was very impressed with the effect of his actions on Harry, and considered continuing them for a while, but his attention was drawn back to the fairy lights, which led around to the front of Harry's body. Draco remembered how thoroughly they were wrapped around Harry's cock and balls, and grinned as he moved round to investigate. He was very tempted to do more licking, but realised that his barely-there kisses were driving Harry wild, so he continued removing lights and pressing his lips very lightly to a succession of tiny patches of skin. Sure enough, he was only halfway up Harry's cock when Harry came.
"Something like
"Two of them, actually. Huh," said Draco. "The one I was thinking of was 'You do something to me', which was the first one which I specifically sang about you. But he also wrote 'I've got you under my skin', which is the one that made you kiss me. So it's a double thank you to Cole Porter."

"Actually there is! I've been commissioned to create the soundtrack for a Christmas animated short - so not just write the music, but also perform it. That means it's just me and my piano rather than a full orchestra, but they seem happy with that, and I'm enjoying it. Today I've been working on a scene where the main character goes for a walk and sees a robin, and that makes her think of her father because it was his favourite bird."
"No! Absolutely not," said Draco. "But I… Well, I didn't like to assume. Right now it all seems a bit too good to be true, and I suppose the pessimistic side of me is waiting for it to all go wrong. Sorry."
"She thinks of everything, doesn't she?" commented Ron, grinning as he did as instructed, while Draco shuffled along.
Draco jumped up and stood in his way, and then somehow Harry's wand was at his throat before he'd even noticed Harry reach for it. Draco held up his hands in submission. "I can't stop you if you really want to do that, of course," he said, striving to keep his voice steady and calming. "But please can I ask you to wait a few minutes so that we can discuss the consequences?"
"It's only the truth," Scorpius said, but he smiled. "It's great to see you back, by the way. And I can't wait to watch you and my dad duelling. You won't hurt him, will you?"
"Are you OK?" asked Harry, turning on his torch and shining its red light on Draco.
Draco laughed. “Not because of the song,” he explained. “Because I need to use this.”
Harry stared at this for a second before registering that he was expected to reply. He flushed. "Actually I do," he said firmly. "But not usually as much as I did last night."
"And this area is very peaceful," added Lucius. "The nearest station is miles away, and there isn't that much traffic. The people are very friendly if you approach them, but they don't bother you if you don't. We only came here because it was cheap, but it's proved to be a good decision."
"Because it's by far the hardest one to memorise," said Draco. "It's only got one word in it: Amen."
Harry blushed even more. "Erm... Well, I had an idea. But if you don't want to do it, it's fine. Really! In fact, forget I said anything. It doesn't matter."

"Well, I suppose you don’t need to go to St Mungo’s just yet," said Hermione. "Just promise me you will if there’s any change, though, won’t you?"
"What plan's that?"

Written for the Slythindor100 "25 Days of Draco and Harry" challenge. Prompt for this chapter:
Draco laughed mirthlessly. "Friends? What friends? You are literally the first people I've spoken to since I came back from Russia, and that was six months ago. No, all my school friends are either dead or left the country more or less when I did, and for the same reason. I don't think any of them will be back any time soon. And you probably know that both my parents died shortly after the war, of course."
Draco ran his finger round the inside of his mug and then sucked on it, giving Harry a wink.

"You know that McGonagall
at them! And I can see that Harry can't leave the wizarding world. But why can't Draco leave the Muggle world?"
All of a sudden he remembered something he'd meant to do before going to sleep, and reached for his wand. "Expecto Patronum," he said, and when the silvery stag appeared he said: "Go and find Seamus and ask him if he can come here for a few minutes, please. Nothing bad, I just have a favour to ask him." The stag turned round and galloped through the wall.
"Oh, I see," said Harry. "Wait, no I don't. You said it reminds you of me? I'm a bit vague on why that is."
"None. That's the problem," said James. Harry raised his eyebrows. "We didn't have any seventh-years in our team last year. We had trials anyway at the start of this term, but no-one who turned up was really good enough to replace anyone. It's depressing."
"Look, we've talked about this," said Harry, alarmed. "It's not that I don't want to marry you, I just don't think we need to rush into it. There's plenty of time."
"Come on," said Harry, grimly, and walked a few paces away. Ron followed him, and an apparently heated argument ensued. Draco tried at first to pretend he wasn't watching, but then he realised they weren't looking anywhere other than at each other. The image of the two of them would stay in Draco's mind for quite some time, he realised: Ron getting more and more agitated, if the waving of his arms was anything to go by, with Harry standing perfectly calmly with his hands clasped behind his back and his very hard cock jutting up into the cold Yorkshire air. Draco remembered Harry getting turned on by being naked when Draco had been clothed; he wondered whether Harry also had a related exhibitionist kink. That would certainly explain why his erection hadn't been affected at all by the temperature.
a lot better," said Ron, peering at his face. Then he laughed. "And we had a lot of fun tricking your stalkers, actually. Did you see them when you came in?"
"Thank you," said Harry. "I’m sure I’ll be fine, though. I’m bound to sleep tonight. Oh, thank you, Helen. You’re a life-saver."
Draco passed the note back to Harry. "I suppose it's good that she's worried about you, and seems to have realised she's an idiot," he said. "That's awkward about Thursday, though. D'you think you'll be able to cope with waiting four days?"
"Very funny," said Harry, but he grinned bashfully. "So what are your thoughts?"
"No, I haven’t got any sleeping potions," said Harry. "I’ve never had trouble sleeping before. Isn’t there a danger of getting dependent on them?"
"Sorry," he said. "Old habits die hard. Welcome to our home, Malfoy. How are you?"
"It's all lovely, though," said Draco. "Thank you for showing it to me. Now, are you going to buy me a crepe or not?"
have enough experience to cope with most of what might happen. And McGonagall wouldn't have employed you without checking your references, you know. So your bosses at Beauxbatons must think you'll be fine too."
"Yet what?" asked Harry.
of the fact that we just both came together, although that's a bonus, but I've just realised that I haven't said this out loud yet: I love you. And I wanted you to know."
Harry brightened. "Oh! Your cat!" he exclaimed. "Where is she?"

"You're kidding. There were books about

The girl smiled. "Hello, Harpsichord."
"I'll try," said Malfoy. "But... Well, it's only fair to warn you that I might not dare. We do seem to be having a civilised conversation right now, for which I'm grateful, but me telling
After a moment's total silence, the audience erupted, and within seconds they were all on their feet clamouring for more.
"Sorry," said Harry, looking as if he really was. "I'll try to convince them after you've gone. Can't promise I'll manage it, though. People seem to believe all sorts of ridiculous things where I'm concerned."

Harry rolled his eyes. "What, exactly, do you think he could have
Harry and Draco stamped their feet on the mat to remove the snow, then followed Ron through to the back of the house, where Hermione was sitting in an armchair by the window.
Draco reached out wordlessly and pulled Harry towards him, wrapping his arms tightly round him before releasing one of his hands to play with Harry's hair. Their cocks pressed against each other as they settled into a comfortable entwined position, and they both jumped slightly at the initial sensation but then relaxed. "How does that feel?" Draco asked, hoping it was as overwhelming for Harry as it was for him.
Draco gave him a small smile. "Well, it means a lot to me that you've thought of that," he said. "Thank you. We'll need to be careful what we say about Ginny, too. We can't just ignore what she did – too many people saw it. But I'd hate to think she'd be made into a pariah because of it."
The three musicians appeared from the sides of the room, and joined Draco and Rabia for a few more bows before Harry quietened the audience again. "Now, I know it's Christmas Eve and you all have places to be, so if you have to leave then of course please do," he said. "But, if you can spare five more minutes... we do have a little something extra for you, and this one features
"I'm not calling you
“It feels back to normal,” Draco told her. “I can’t thank you enough for your help. It would have got there on its own, but not in time for tomorrow if it hadn’t been for you.”
"Ginny? We tried for a while, after the war, but we'd already drifted apart by then, and after a few months we agreed it wasn't working. She's still a good friend, though – it was all very civilised. And it wasn't until after we split up that I realised I might not be entirely straight. Actually, true story: my first gay experience was when I saw a bloke in a bar who looked a bit like you. I couldn't help staring at him, and he noticed and came over, and… well, that was an educational night."
Harry has more than one surprise for Draco.

"You know, even though I

Prompt 20: Icy tree branches
Draco looked up at Harry, and Harry decided that the word that best described his expression was 'sultry'. But then all thoughts of vocabulary flew out of Harry's head as Draco began to lick every part of his cock, alternating his licks with brief swirls of his tongue around its head. When Draco finally put the tip of his tongue inside the slit, Harry shuddered, and Draco instantly wrapped his mouth around as much of the whole cock as he could, maintaining his suction as Harry came harder than he'd ever done before.
"Oh, go on then," said Draco. "But only if you promise to tell me if you think it's rubbish. "Come on."
"Hot in the cold - that's quite an achievement," said Harry, grinning. "But
"Actually, it doesn't feel as bad with you here," Draco admitted. "I think it's the feeling of having to keep it all to myself that's exhausted me. You're right, I should have asked for help sooner."
"You can do a Patronus?" was the question on Draco's mind.
Draco grinned at him and instigated the kiss himself.
"Well, we should be able to get some in Hawes," said Harry. "Although… no, actually, that might be a bad idea. I don't want to make things difficult for your parents. You know what small towns are like."
"Of course they will," Ron told her. "But first, drinks! Harry, you're buying. WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PUB!"
"What was that for?" he asked, smiling.
"I might have a bit more in a minute, and I definitely want more coffee, but let's not keep them waiting for their dance," said Harry, leading the way to the piano.
"I'm sure your dad's happy about it, you know," said Draco. "I do understand why neither of you felt you could tell us before now, and I think he'll understand that too. All he'll be bothered about is whether you're happy, and you obviously are."
Ron and Hermione burst into applause as Draco finished speaking, but he kept his eyes fixed on Harry, who was blushing.
Hermione watched with interest. "Wrap a bit of it round his penis a few times. And his testicles," she said. They both gaped at her. "What? It'll look amazing. Especially if he stays as hard as he is now."
"No, I've usually tried to avoid being anywhere near the press at all, but when I've absolutely

Harry stared at him, taken aback. "I... thought you liked me doing all the housework while you were at college and stuff," he said.

totally naked, but that was the point at which the surrealism of the whole situation (particularly the conversation they'd just had) hit him, and he was still smiling at this when he rejoined his visitors.
"He has indeed, and he's been very welcome. You know, I suspect the reason he hasn't talked about me is that he's unsure how you'd react. It's a well-known fact that you and I didn't get on very well at school."
"I can't take time off to go gallivanting around the world!" Harry protested. "That would be very unprofessional. This week was the first time I missed any of my lessons, and that was only because the press conference was during the day. But I made sure everything was prepared for the people who covered the lessons that afternoon."
Draco squeezed Harry's arm again. "Harry. You did realise that you and Ginny are finished, didn't you?"
. Her huge eyes opened even further when she saw Harry. "Harry Potter, sir!" she squeaked. "You is supposed to be on holiday!"
if they change it now," he said lightly. Draco squeezed his arm in sympathy. "Hey, where's Ginny? And where are we, anyway?" wondered Harry suddenly. He sat up and looked around the room.
"Harry, I've been in the Muggle world for fourteen years," said Draco. "
"Who is it? And when did this happen? Must be someone quite impressive to get you smiling like that. You don't smile very often these days."
"I was going to do that, but I had a better idea while I was planning my lessons," said Draco. "I had the fourth-year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws just before lunch today, and the lesson just happened to be about how to determine whether or not a note was genuinely from who it
"We do, apparently," said Draco, grinning. He started to play a lively chord sequence on the piano. "I didn't quite dare sing this one before, because it was a bit presumptuous, but in light of what you've just said..."
"... I'm not sure I want to know, but I need to," said Hermione. "But Ron's right, let's eat. Oh wait, we haven't set out the crackers!" She leapt up and took a box from the cupboard, reaching inside and giving three Christmas crackers to each of them.
"And who is your friend, Draco? Have we met before?"
"So, you mean..." began Harry, amused.
Harry turned to meet Draco's gaze, at a loss for words. "Erm," he said eventually. "I realise that
"Sorry," said Harry, feeling terrible. "I didn't mean to accuse you. I don't know why I said that. I do trust you, actually. I've never thought of you as a liar."
"Thank you," he said to the audience, as the applause finally died down. "I'm not quite used to that amount of applause before I've actually sung anything, so I hope you'll have some left for the end. And I hope Harry hasn't said anything
Harry's eyes met Draco's briefly, but then he became fascinated with his fingernails. "Well, I was just thinking," he mumbled. "I know we agreed to take turns with the bed, but that sofa is more uncomfortable than I thought it would be, and my back was

"OK," said Harry slowly. "Sounds lovely, but you sounded quite keen to be here, and I think I'm missing why? Although it does have the most impressive Christmas tree I've seen this year."

Harry nodded. "I promise to look after him," he said solemnly, but with a twinkle in his eye. He opened the door and stepped out; Draco waved to his parents and followed.

"Can't argue with that," said Harry. "Hmm, that's weird. Have you noticed that lots of these stalls have some of the same things, even though they're actually selling totally different things?"
Harry felt bewildered as to where Draco might be going with this, but tried to remember. "Erm... well, obviously you know about Barcelona, and before that it was Sydney," he said. "And a few days before Sydney we were in Chicago.... oh, and Johannesburg before that. And Rio - you probably heard about that one because of the protests - and of course it all started in Beijing."
fault?" he asked.
"I’m sorry I missed today’s," Harry said. "But maybe I’ll see one from here soon. Listen, I should really get going. I’ve got an early start tomorrow, and I still have some work to do tonight before I can go to bed."
Draco smiled at them both, and then found himself grabbing hold of Hermione’s arm to steady her as she appeared in their midst. She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Rabia, whose jaw had dropped again.
At his call, the house-elf appeared with a
"I think we'll be OK," said Harry. "And thank you for what you said to me the other week, by the way. I might never have realised there was a problem if you hadn't helped. I don't know where you got your people skills from – it can't have been from me
"I'm going to return the favour," Draco told him, kneeling at Harry's feet and looking up at him. "I'm going to suck every millimetre of that huge cock of yours. But first, I'm going to look at you. … Bloody hell, it's even bigger in daylight. Typical that you'd have the world's biggest cock. Not that I'm complaining."
"Possibly nothing," said Harry. "But it doesn’t look good. There was an explosion in which several houses were destroyed, and Blaise was found searching through the rubble. He claims he had nothing to do with the explosion, but he refuses to say why he was there or what he was searching for. He’s being kept in custody for further questioning, but we’ll have to let him go if we can’t find any evidence soon, even though we have no other suspects."
to fetch him. I should've known he wouldn't believe me."
"That's not what you used to say about her when I was at school," Draco reminded him.
Draco squeezed his hand, concerned. "Of course," said Narcissa. "Forgive me for asking. I am sorry to hear that you had such an unpleasant experience."
Draco burst out laughing, and Harry stared at him in bewilderment. "What's so funny?"
Ten minutes later, all five of them were ensconced in armchairs by the roaring fire in the Crown Hotel, and the pub table was crammed with drinks and huge slices of lemon drizzle cake. The men had all been persuaded to try Theakston's Old Peculier, despite Draco complaining that the brewery could at least have spelt it correctly; even Narcissa was sipping a half of the famous beer ("I won't know if I like it unless I try it, will I?"), while Teddy had decided to try the hot chocolate.
They arrived back in Draco's flat, and Harry immediately cast a spell to dry them off.
"I'm glad to hear you're not too tired for
"I was up there last week on a case," said Harry. "And they have these amazing Christmas markets. I looked them up afterwards, and it turns out they're the best Christmas markets in the UK. But I didn't have time to look round while I was there, so I thought we might pop up there now."
"Probably dashed into the bedroom to hide when she realised it wasn't just me," said Draco. "Hang on a second while I get her." He returned a moment later with the cat cradled in his arms, and stood still so that Harry could have a look at her.
Draco leaned back on the sofa and gesticulated with his candy cane. "OK, so you've been partnerless since the end of July... what? Everyone knows when your birthday is!"
"They
It only felt like the next moment when he opened them again, but clearly some time had passed, because the sun was blazing through the open window and a fully-dressed Draco was shaking him awake. Harry rubbed his eyes and sat up against the headboard, and was handed a steaming cup of coffee. He muttered his thanks and drank half of it before looking properly at Draco, who had perched himself on the edge of the bed.
"Well, the sheep don't," Harry pointed out. "Some campers would build a latrine, or at least a pit, but we're not going to be here for long, so I don't think it's worth it. You can bury it if you like, but nature will remove it in time. Toilet paper is a different matter, though, so I must admit I cheat and using a cleaning charm instead."
cars. And the ground is so hilly that you only have to go a few yards from the road to get to somewhere where you can't see the road at all. You can't even see the lights of Hawes – they're behind a hill. And there are no other towns or villages anywhere near. There's one farm a mile or two away, but that's invisible from where we're staying. The only light you can see at all is a really dim glow on the western horizon – we think it's the M6 motorway."
"I see," said Draco. "That
"So you're unlicensed? Bloody hell. And they've never arrested you?"
"I was here," whispered Harry, and he felt Draco kiss his neck.
"You mean, to make sure I don't go mad again?" said Harry, smiling self-deprecatingly. "No, I think I'll be OK. It's a valid point, but I think I'm calm enough now to stay in control. I won't be long, anyway. I just want to see all three of them with my own eyes. I'll come straight back as soon as I've found them all."
"The quote reminded me of Ginny," said Harry. "And, since I know you're not stupid, I'm sure you've probably already guessed that what happened today is to do with her."
Harry suddenly felt horribly guilty for intruding on such a private moment, especially since Albus and Scorpius had no idea that they weren't alone. He quickly went back down through the common room, making every effort to be as silent as possible. The vision of his and Draco's sons remained etched in his head, though; he'd known that Albus and Scorpius were the best of friends, of course, but he'd had no idea there was any more to it than that. He wondered whether Draco knew how close they actually were, and resolved to ask him at the first opportunity. As soon as he thought of Draco, though, it occurred to him that he and Draco would have looked very like Albus and Scorpius if they'd been friends at school.
he asked. "Hmm. Actually, I suppose I can see why you would think that. But it's not true. There are several reasons why I offered, but that's not one of them. And yes, it'd be nice to be with Ron, but it's not as if I won't see him, and I really don't mind sharing with you, believe it or not. And, before you ask, Ron understands why I suggested this, and he's fine with it. Now then, I
"I'd actually like that," said Draco. "In the meantime, eat these. We don't want you collapsing in front of all these people, do we?" He reached into his pocket and produced an apple and a bag of crisps.
"Well, erm, yes, they sort of said something about that," said Draco. "I seem to recall that the word 'obsessed' was even used a few times. But my favourite bit was the part when they said that the thought of me makes you happy. I'm not sure I can quite believe that, but if it's even slightly true, then I think it's the best news I've ever heard."
Again, I didn't make as much progress as I wanted to, but we're getting there! Oh, and if you're curious, in my head Harry is wearing
to have you to protect me. I've been looking after myself perfectly well in the Muggle world. And I don't want to make
"Right," said Harry. He was silent for several minutes before continuing. "Well, if it's any consolation, I've never been able to make myself go up there either."
"What was that?" asked Harry.
"How on earth did you end up there?" wondered Harry. Then he shook his head. "Don't answer that. I'll add it to the list of things I need to get you to explain tomorrow."
"When you drive on the motorway from Lancashire into Yorkshire, there's a white rose on a pillar by the road at the point where you enter Yorkshire," Draco informed him. "In the other direction, there's a red rose."
"Erm... I've never actually bought any clothes," said Harry, embarrassed. "I've thought about it a few times this summer, but never actually got round to it."
"I'm going to stop you right there," said Draco, taking the candy cane out of his mouth for a moment. "You seem to have missed out a large part of the story."
Harry grinned. "So you don’t think I’m in any danger from the curse?" he asked.
"There's probably room for you next to me on here," said Draco, closing the piano stool and sitting down, "but would you mind standing up for the moment? Maybe with your hand on my shoulder? It'd be easier to play that way."
“And because of the piano we can’t bring the concert outside into the grounds, either, even if we could keep everyone warm,” said Harry. “Hmm.”

supposed to be there were ill. So the section was seriously underpowered, and the conductor did some emailing, and my singing teacher knows him, and that's how I ended up getting asked to do it."
"Lead the way," said Harry, standing up and pulling Draco with him. "Also: you cook? When did
Harry stood up. "That would be lovely," he said. "Thank you. I'd love to sit down and hear what you've all been doing since the war. And I want to see if you can guess why Teddy and I are here in Hawes, actually – I'm willing to bet none of you will come even close to the right answer."
"Uncle Harry!" shouted the boy when he noticed them; he jumped up and ran to give the man a hug.
"Well, there’s a bar down on the 23rd floor, or we could go somewhere else if you prefer. But it’s icy cold outside, and the bar will be noisy. So I was thinking we could just stay here and chat, since we seem to be getting along better than either of us might have expected."
Draco was taken aback by this. "That sounds very lonely," he mused.
"It's oddly satisfying," said Lucius, getting up and going to the breadbin. "I never would have thought it, but it is. Not just the cooking itself, but feeding people and seeing them enjoy eating what I've made."
"I never thought of that! Of course it is! Wow, I’m so thick," said Harry. He looked at the golden horn pendant for a moment before putting it on. "Thank you for this, too," he said. "It’s really thoughtful of you. I love it."
"Come on through," said Molly. "Everyone's in the kitchen. But, Harry, before we go in... I'm sorry for what my daughter tried to do. She just wasn't thinking clearly. She never meant to hurt you. Having said that, I think it's probably a good thing that this happened – well, apart from the fact that you're now unintentionally bonded – because you were never going to break up with her, were you? And it was obvious to everyone except you and Ginny that it wasn't working any more."
"Well, she's going to have to get used to it, isn't she?" said Harry. "She's only got herself to blame."
The other reason for this confession is to warn you that I have far less idea what will happen after this point!

"Yeah, right," said Ginny. "When was the last time you came to see one of my games? You never come to watch any more!"
Harry, increasingly bewildered, took Draco's hand. "I don't understand anything you're saying. I'm so sorry. But if I've done something to hurt you, I need you to spell it out to me in really small words, please, because I love you more than anything and I hate the thought that I might've put those tears in your eyes."

would lead to, but I can't cope with the strain of wondering what you're planning to do about what I told you."
"Well, I can't tell you that. But I
Draco gave him a watery smile. "It means a lot to me, you know, that you're not laughing at me," he said. "I'm sure you must be dying to."
"Draco's right here," said Draco, and he reached out and took Harry's hand.
of energy."
Draco allowed the kiss to continue for a couple of minutes before he pulled away (he realised that he'd been a bit too enthusiastic about it to convince Harry that he was even slightly angry, but felt that he needed to make the point). "Not that I don't appreciate the thought," he murmured, "but don't you think this might have been a
“I’m not
"Just fish and chips for me, please," said Draco. Harry grinned and flung a piece of fish into the oil. Draco found himself matching his grin.
"As this is a demonstration duel only, we will of course not be needing seconds," Draco told the class. "Perhaps, though, Professor McGonagall would be good enough to give us the countdown."
Draco's brow furrowed for a moment. "OK," he said, slowly. "Supposing for a second that I were to agree to this... isn't there a danger that people would think I'm just using you? They might even think I'm Imperiusing you! People won't believe that you'd willingly do this."
"Go on," said Draco.
Harry looked at him, puzzled.
"And to think people tell me I don't get enough entertainment in my life," muttered McGonagall to herself, settling down to watch.

to them, for that matter. What's happened?"
Draco looked at him, and they both smiled faintly. “We were actually talking about those fights last night in bed,” he said. “We’d lit a load of candles, and it seemed to prompt us to talk about the past. We apologised to each other. It’s sorted now.”
"Sorrento. And yes, there's plenty to do, but there are loads of tourists, and I mostly prefer to stay at home in peace. My flat overlooks the sea and I can see Capri in the distance. It's very pleasant to sit on the balcony reading."
"It's a deal," said Draco, nodding. "Project Firstborn, I'm calling this in my head. Just so you know."
"Let me check with Hermione before you do that - she might enjoy it too," said Harry. "And maybe some of the others too?"
"I didn't think of it. Sorry." They stepped inside the door of the hall where the concert was to take place. Harry was a bit distracted by the bizarre sight of an upside-down Christmas tree in one corner of the foyer, but before he could comment on this he found himself confronted by a friendly-looking woman.

"They can be much worse, but not often," said Draco. "As long as I stick to our routine, they're usually like this. They only really get in a state if I'm not there when they expect me to be, or if I try to make them do something different. Sorry for not warning you before I touched them, by the way. I forgot for a moment."
"Oy!" said Harry, laughing. "You could've told me I looked terrible
"It's important to me that they... well, that they don't hate me, if I'm being entirely accurate. I know you said they don't, but it still seems quite unlikely."
"Are you OK? Your hands are shaking." Harry's voice made Draco jump: neither of them had spoken since teatime.
promise that I don't want it to. I know we only got together two days ago, but why shouldn't it last? All relationships have to start somewhere. I want to get to know the new you, and if it takes a while… I'm OK with that."
At two minutes past four the next day, Harry stumbled back out of the fireplace, cursing as he brushed soot from his shirt sleeves.
"I knew you three were close, but I didn't realise you were
"Internet, of course," said Draco. "I've got friends all over the place. Mostly in America, but a few in other places too."
"Well, thank you," said Draco. "You do realise that you look amazing yourself, though, right? Clothes on
Draco looked at him quizzically. "I’m already wearing a pendant," said Harry, removing it from inside his shirt. It was a silver dagger, with a dragon attached to each side and a ruby in the hilt. "I saw it in a shop a few years ago and thought it was really cool. Maybe… Can I give it to you? Would you wear it?"
Draco smiled at him in relief, glad to get back to what they'd been talking about. "True," he said. "And, much as it pains me to admit it, I think you're going to have to tell us."
He was looking at Harry, but it was Draco who answered. "It was fine, don't worry," he said. "I must admit that I was a bit shocked at first, but not as shocked as I am at the fact that people don't seem too bothered by me being here. I mean, I suspect it will still be a while before I'll dare to come without Harry, but I'm grateful to you both for showing me that it's not as bad as I thought it would be."
Weasley stared for another few seconds, and then burst out laughing. "Yeah, right," he said. "Nice try. You didn't really think I'd believe
friends on the train." He stood and reached to get his bag down from the luggage rack.
Seamus held up his hand, and after a moment Harry reluctantly high-fived him. "I'm proud of you, mate," said Seamus. "About time. Now, I'm going to want updates on the progress of your relationship, obviously - I've been on my own for a while as well, so I have to live vicariously - but I still need to sleep ASAP... so, what's this favour you need?"
Harry Potter was having an unexpectedly pleasant afternoon. He'd been a bit disappointed when Draco had been called into college for an extra rehearsal ("You've finished the course, they can't make you!" "Being freelance doesn't mean there's no commitment!"), so their plans to go to the cinema had had to be postponed again. They'd both been looking forward to seeing
"After that, let's sit down and start our brainstorming, shall we? You promised a year ago that you were going to solve my life crisis, and you did... it feels a bit of a cheek to expect you to do it again! But at least I know I'm working with someone with a proven success rate."
Draco gestured towards the smaller of the two windows in the room, through which could be seen a snow-covered building in the distance. "You see that clock tower over there? Do you somehow think that the fact you can see it from you window gives you some sort of special power over time? Or... wait, you haven't been using a Time-Turner, have you? I thought they were all destroyed."
Harry took hold of both of Draco's hands and they finished the chorus together: "OHHHHHHH, VIENNAAAAAAAAAA!"
There were hugs all round. Draco noticed again how thin his mother was, and resolved to talk to his father about it when he got the chance. She did look well otherwise, though, he told himself as they stepped out of the house.
"I can imagine," said Draco. "She was always scarily intelligent. I'm pleased to hear they're still together, though. They were so different that I could never understand how it worked, but it obviously did."
it was over. He just stopped responding to any attempt I made to contact him. I haven't seen or heard from him in nearly three years."

Draco's songs:

"Believe me, we're just as surprised as you are," said Lucius. "Narcissa and I moved to this area recently, and Draco is visiting us. We've been for a walk and came in here for coffee and cake. In fact… are these seats taken? There are no empty tables… would you mind if we joined you? We are all very well-behaved these days, I can assure you. But, given our history, we would completely understand if you'd prefer us to leave."
"Right," said Draco. "And, of course, you wouldn't have been held as a child, would you? I can see why it's something that would mean a lot to you. It's not a silly thing at all. Well, I'm sorry you got to such an advanced age before you got to do it, but I'm very glad that it was me that got to make your wish come true." His arms had been resting loosely on Harry's shoulders, but now he pulled Harry closer to him and gave him a tight hug.
At that moment, the fireplace flared and Ron stepped into the room. Draco struggled to sit up and dry his eyes, but Ron waved his hand dismissively.
Harry considered this. "It makes so much sense when you put it like that," he said, eventually. "And, damn. I'm going to have to do something about it now, aren't I? Bugger."
"I did wonder whether that was why he seemed so… well, submissive," commented Draco. "It seemed unlike him."
Bearing this in mind, Harry smiled at Draco, and was interested to note that Draco blushed and looked away.
. I really enjoyed waking up with your arms round me."
approve," said Draco, relenting. "It's well known that you and I didn't get on at school. In any case, you don't see Andromeda and Teddy that often yourself, do you?"
Draco stared at him with a confused look on his face. "What are you... oh!" His expression became guarded but hopeful. At least, Harry hoped so.
"I was standing in the queue when you got here," she told him. "Maybe you have something on your mind? You looked right through me."
Draco, intrigued, nodded and looked at Harry expectantly.
"Alright... Draco," said James, smiling shyly. "I'm just wondering, though – does Mum know?"
"I'll try to remember that," said Harry. "It'll shock you to hear that I'm not the tidiest of people. But I bet I can unpack quicker than you."
Prompt 17: Pile of presents
Several minutes later, by which point they both had their hands inside each other's jeans, Draco pulled his head back slightly. "Not that I'm not enjoying this very much indeed," he said huskily, "but it'd be much more comfortable in a bed. Shall we?"
"It's just down the road," said Harry. "I have a Notice-Me-Not charm on it, but that's mainly just in case any wizards happen to be passing by. The Muggles don't bother me."
He was still trying to come up with a way of wording the question when Draco returned. There was a faint aroma of rum on his breath when Harry kissed him in greeting, and he laughed when Harry pointed this out.
tempted to start this part with it NOT being Harry… but that would delay the story a bit, so I didn't :-)
"You know I haven't," said Harry. "That does sound fun, though - let's do it. Will it be a boat like this one? That'd be
Harry, in the meantime, had just forced himself off the sofa, where he'd been lost in thought for quite some time. He mentally scanned the cottage, decided that most of it was probably tidy enough, and went into the kitchen to see what he could find to make a meal for Draco on his return. He was just feeling the potatoes, in an effort to ascertain whether they were past their best, when he heard a clatter in the front room, and looked up to see Ron entering the kitchen.
"I know, right? But of course it turned out I was just being an idiot as usual. Anyway, we're on the case now. No actual decisions yet, but we've talked about it a lot, and made several useful lists. But I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. And, more importantly, because - predictably - I don't think you and I have ever talked about this: what things about your life are better now you're working with George? And is there anything about being an Auror that you actually miss?"
be one advantage of employing Harry Bloody Potter," he pointed out. "Although it might have slightly less effect on the Muggles."
"Not till the stalkers have got bored," said Harry. "Sorry – I just think it would be a nightmare if I tried to go shopping at the moment."
"Draco, just having your mouth near my cock is making me hard," Harry told him. "There's nothing you could do that wouldn't be amazing."
"Yeah," said Harry. "They did say she wouldn't be ready by ten at the earliest, but we should get there in plenty of time before then, so they won't worry."
for not pushing me to talk about it earlier," said Harry. "I think that's what made me feel comfortable about trusting you now. I do have one request, though. Can you call me Harry, please? When you call me Potter I feel like a schoolboy, and we're different people now."
, of all people. No offence."
Harry tightened his arms around him. "I hope he doesn't feel too left out when I take over some of his snuggling duties," he said. "He led me to you, after all. I'd hate to think he was deprived as a result."

, unprompted, fully accepted me. So, on the one hand I'm delighted we're getting on so well, but on the other I have to make a decision."
So I don't know when he slept, or how exhausted and stressed he was, but he had a smile on his face every time he made one of his many speeches that year, and I couldn't stop thinking about how the FA and the Government were taking advantage of his good nature. And at some point it occurred to me that I could imagine the Ministry of Magic doing the same with Harry, and that if they also decided Draco should be wheeled out then that would be interesting.
Several hours later, Draco was surprisingly tired; he was used to spending time surrounded by the many inhabitants of a boarding school, of course, but over a dozen people had come up to speak to him during lunch in the Great Hall, and he'd always found that conversation tended to drain his energy. He'd been startled – but very pleased – at the response to McGonagall's announcement that he'd be replacing Potter for two weeks. He hadn't expected cheers, of course – it hardly seemed likely that anyone would be
. I nearly killed you! I would have, if Snape hadn't been nearby."
"Hermione did do that, yes," said Harry, clearly deciding that this was the safest topic to pursue. "Mainly because she was so frustrated that she couldn't use a laptop apart from when she was at her parents' house. She was desperate to get the wizarding world online somehow, but the effect of magic on electrical stuff made that impossible. But that just made Hermione try harder."
They arrived in the living room of Draco's flat in Wallington. Ron and Hermione immediately went to the window to look at the view of the city, and Draco stayed with them, pointing out landmarks. Harry went into the kitchen to make coffee, but he returned a few seconds later.
"Oh dear. But I see you got a nice balloon dragon, though?"
Everyone stared at her in amazement. "Well, no, of course you can't," said Harry, after a pause in which he realised she actually wasn't joking. "What part of 'bonded to Draco' didn't you understand?"
"Isn't it a bit lonely, though?" wondered Harry. "And, does your mother live here too?"
"Don't worry, I don't suppose she's had any reason to change her lifelong opinion of me," said Draco. "Maybe she will, if she gets to know me. Which is more likely now that I'm practically your
"Shush, Ron, he
? It's a horrible house."
"I bet you could," said Draco. "It's not that hard. I've kept in touch by owl with all my colleagues from the research project, so I have had human contact. I get letters from one or other of them most days, and I write back. I've managed to earn some money by doing translations to and from Russian, too – I've always been quite good at languages, and I learned Russian more thoroughly than the others did, so they've sent lots of translation work my way. And I've done lots of reading, since I realised I could buy books by owl as well as food. It's been quite peaceful really. Especially with Spike."
Weasley was looking at him uncertainly; when Draco reached into his pocket and produced a biro and a piece of paper, however, he looked astonished, and watched as Draco wrote down the name of the hospital and the ward.
time I was there, everyone was yelling at me – you know, 'filthy Death Eater!' and stuff like that – and casting hexes and jinxes wherever I went. It's not an experience I care to repeat."
"That was a pity, really," said Ron. "It would have been quite funny to see the looks on their faces if you'd walked in with no sign of any injury at all. But I suppose it
Draco stared at the speaker, a blonde-haired third-year Ravenclaw girl. His day until now hadn't been as horrible as he'd feared: it had started with second-year Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, who were no trouble at all, and continued with fourth-year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. That class, which was a bit more boisterous but still not
being a bit too full of myself. Ow!"
"I hope so," said Harry. "Tell you what, though. Let's agree on a code word for both visits – to your family
Harry. That would be very confusing," said Draco, with a perfectly straight face.
When the bell rang for the start of the lesson, Draco stood up in front of the teacher's desk, and Harry started prowling round the edge of the classroom. Draco ignored him – they'd planned this, for no reason other than to increase the excitement level – and addressed the class.
worrying," said Draco. "But I trust you. I think. So let's get some skates so that the laughing-at-Potter portion of the day can commence!"
"So, go on," said Draco, leaning back on the bench and stretching his legs out. "Why don't you have anyone to talk to?"

at the time. Draco had been amused when he'd first encountered the Muggle expression 'you look as if you've seen a ghost'; Potter had, of course, seen much more terrifying things than ghosts and had hardly even broken a sweat, as far as Draco could recall, but any Muggle seeing him now would definitely go with the ghost phrase. Potter looked quite ill.
"I'm absolutely stuffed," said Harry, eventually. "Listen, d'you fancy going for a walk? I think I need some fresh air while we talk."
Luna laughed. "That's sort of what journalists do," she pointed out. "They spread news! And even though I'm not really a journalist myself any more, I have lots of friends who are, and they're all very excited. Apart from anything else, they're
"That's... unexpected," said Draco. "Or actually maybe it isn't. I mean, Padma
Harry raised his eyebrows. "What did you think might happen?" he wondered. Draco looked a little uncomfortable now, in fact. At least, if the very faint flush on his cheeks was anything to go by.
"Go on," said Harry. "I wasn't lying when I said I was intrigued."
"Of course - that's not a day I'm ever likely to forget," said Harry, giving Draco a quick kiss.
"It's a deal," said Hermione. "And the same goes for Harry and Ron, of course. Isn't that right, Harry?"
Draco hadn't said a word during all this, but now he leaned forward to take a sandwich and pour them both some coffee. "I didn't know you had a house-elf," he commented.
"He's not bad," said Scorpius, emerging from the bathroom and starting to work his way round the living room. "I do always feel as if I've learned stuff after one of his lessons. And I like the fact that he always gives us real-life examples of when he's actually
of you - even though, as you say, Draco, you have no choice."
"You're very welcome to, though, any time you feel the urge," said Draco, stepping back and gazing at Harry's body again. He noted that Harry's cock was already half-hard again, and gave it an experimental grope.
"This is great," he said.
Malfoy – Draco – nodded. "So I presume you did end up as an Auror, then? Or are you Minister for Magic already?"
"I suppose I did," admitted Malfoy, after sipping his espresso, "although I do wear it from time to time. I like the colours, and nobody I see knows it's anything other than a green and white scarf."
"That sounds promising," said Harry. "And yes, I've finished eating. What did you have in mind?"
*******
"Well, you did," said Harry, beaming. Then he had a thought. "Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but... will it always feel this good? I mean, when the bond's faded a bit? I know you said it doesn't force us to do anything sexually. But does it enhance the experience at all?"
They bowed to each other solemnly, then stepped backwards several paces. Draco nodded to Professor McGonagall, who had slipped into the room to watch. Harry turned and grinned at her.
"The best I've slept in a long time," Draco told her, truthfully. "What time is it?"
"Well, let's keep that as plan B," said Draco. "I bet you can manage it without us having to brave the cold air again. After all, Superman could change his entire outfit in a phone box, couldn't he? And you're

"Hmm, I see what you mean," said Hermione. "That
The stag galloped off, and Harry found Rabia staring at him, open-mouthed. “This explains such a lot,” she said. “So… you ARE a magician? I take it Draco knows? Or is he one too?”
She stirred, and then opened her eyes. "Harry?" she said, sleepily. "So you
to tell you how I felt about you, but I didn't want to freak you out with everything else you were dealing with. But now I feel... unfettered."
It’s the big day!
Draco grinned. "Is that right?" he said. "How many times? And were you in bed, or in the shower?"
Potter let out the breath he'd been holding. "Um... Alright. I suppose so. For a day or two, at least, and we'll see how it goes. But you'll have to have the bed, and I'll have the sofa. I don't think I'll be able to sleep anyway, so it makes more sense for you to have the bed."
Harry was surprised when Ron and Hermione arrived home with Draco, but pleased when he found that they already knew all about his big news, and delighted to hear that they approved.
"With the coffee? No," said Harry, switching the kettle back on. "With the rest of my life? Almost certainly. But let's start with you. I haven't seen you since... well, since your trial, so I assume you've been out of the country?"
"There’ve been a few changes since you were last in one of those courtrooms," Harry told him. "I thought it was a bit silly that the lift didn’t go down to that level, so I tried to get it extended when I became the boss. But it turned out there was some physical reason why they’d stopped at level nine, and there was no getting round it. So I persuaded them to build another lift. This one just connects the Atrium to the courtroom level."
His next thought was: "You've got a naked Harry Potter in bed with you. Don't fall asleep again!"
The tears were flowing more profusely now, and Harry's voice was starting to sound a little ragged. Draco had been fighting the urge to give him a hug for the last few minutes; he wasn't sufficiently confident that they'd reached the stage at which that would be acceptable. He was also a little bemused by the fact that he had the urge at all: he hugged his own family regularly and loved doing so, but he'd never had the urge to hug anyone
Several hours later, all the cake was gone, and asparagus soup had been heated up and consumed; the sky was now totally dark, and the spectacle overhead was glorious. The square of Pegasus was setting in the west, but Orion stood proudly in the south, and Jupiter was blazing just above the eastern horizon, easily the brightest thing in the sky.
"I'm liking this self-confidence you've rediscovered," murmured Draco, resting both hands on Harry's back as Harry returned to his facial reconnaissance.
"Us too," said Narcissa. "So that was, what, seventeen years ago? I would have thought he might have got some different glasses by now. But that definitely looks like him."
"I can never bear to move her when she's asleep," Draco admitted. "She's just too cute. Can we just get in the bed on either side of her? She'll probably wake up if we do, and move on her own."
win," Draco told him. "He says James is the only one on the Gryffindor team who's any good, and he doesn't think that'll be enough to take them past Slytherin."
"I really think he'll listen," said Hermione. "I can't promise he won't give you a hard time, but I think he'll give you the benefit of the doubt. And I do think he'll come with you, and then you'll be able to get back to your life. I do appreciate you doing all this for me, you know. And I do want to find out what you've been doing since the war, but please will you go and see Harry first? The nurse told me that I'll be in plaster for six weeks at least, so I'm a bit keen to get some magical healing."
"Stargazing time!" said Harry. "Tell you what, I'm going to bring out that bag of cake so we can dip into it when we feel like it. We can have soup later, when we're freezing – we'll appreciate it more then."
"What a delightful mental image," said Draco drily, " but thank you for the compliment. And thank you for not running away screaming when we dropped the magic surprise. Lots of people would have."
Harry flushed. "I had an owl," he admitted, hoping his son wouldn't ask what his response had been. "She sounds fine. I'm sure she'll be in touch with you after the England camp's finished."
"Definitely," said Harry. "And, just for the sake of transparency, I think I was only half-joking. In case
Draco needs Harry's support.

Longbottom was one of those who'd come up to speak to him during dessert. He seemed overjoyed when he discovered that he was responsible for Draco being there; Draco thanked him fervently. It had become obvious to him during the war that Longbottom was by no means the idiot Draco had initially thought him to be, but they'd never met since then; the fact that Longbottom had recommended Draco for a job, despite the abuse he'd received from him in their youth, made Draco even more ashamed of his younger self's behaviour. Apologising at this point seemed a bit ridiculous, but he resolved to get to know the Herbology professor better so that he could maybe attempt to apologise over a drink sometime.
all idiots," Hermione reiterated. "You know why? Ron hates his job too. He and I have talked about it several times, but we didn't want to make any hasty decisions because Ron quitting would affect you too, and Ron kept saying that things might get better.
"Maybe I imagined it," said Draco, embarrassed. "It had been quite a while since I'd last used it. Maybe I'd just forgotten what it felt like."
Harry looked at Draco, surprised.  “You... were talking about me before we reconnected?” he asked. “How come?”
"Exactly," said Harry firmly, standing and draining his cup. "Drink up. No time like the present."
"Yes, we've been married since more or less the last time I saw you," said Hermione. "We live in Ottery St. Catchpole, near his family. Do you know it?"
"She wasn't, really, as it turned out. But you know how it is when you're a teenager and you fancy someone for the first time, and you can't think of anything other than what they look like."
"Well, I didn't know either," Harry pointed out reasonably. "And I'm just as upset as you are. No, not because he's with

, where Draco lives, is the tallest building in Manchester (in fact, the tallest building in the UK outside London). It has a 'shelf' about halfway up; everything below that shelf is the Hilton Hotel, and everything above is luxury apartments. I would LOVE to live there!
"Anyone would think I use language for a living," said Draco, wryly. "Also… we seem to have a bit of an exhibitionist kink, don't we? I hadn't actually realised that about myself before."
"You really have a short memory, don't you?" said Draco, grinning. "Singing. I ended up singing. More specifically, I'm currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Music Honours Degree in Vocal Studies at the Guildhall."
"I dunno. Seven o'clock?" said Harry. "Any time, really."
"Deal," said Harry, performing a cleaning charm on both of them as Draco climbed out of the sleeping bag.
"Longbottom? Really? I'll have to thank him. I knew he was Herbology professor here, of course, but I had no idea he knew what I was doing."
"Biscuits are fiddly, though," Harry pointed out, sitting down at the kitchen table while Draco looked inside the oven. "I'm a pretty good cook, but I've had biscuit disasters in the past."
"He said that dittany may help to avoid scarring. And it did, to a large extent. Just not completely, hence my ill-advised comment, which I see I was right to censor. Honestly, Harry, the scars are barely visible. You can't even really see them unless you're actually looking for them. They don't bother me at all, and I don't hold a grudge against you for them. I can understand why you used that curse, and I'd forgiven you long before you saved us all. That's why I couldn't give you up at the Manor when Fenrir Greyback brought you in. But you thanked me for that after my trial. And even if you hadn't, you've done far more for me than I've ever done for you, so my barely-visible scars are

Harry considered this. "You know, that actually makes a lot of sense," he said. "It took me a while to learn all the kids' names last year – at least this year it's just the first-years I don't know. The control thing is less of an issue – I feel a bit guilty, actually, because all the kids behave for me, and I know it's not because I'm a brilliant teacher. Something to do with being

Draco nodded thoughtfully. "I see. And he's agreed to this, has he?"
men, in the last couple of years, in fact."
"Thanks," said Harry. "And, hello." He took Draco's face gently into his hands and kissed him.
Harry was pulled out of his reverie by a loud chord from the string players, and realised he hadn't paid proper attention to most of Draco's first aria. He sat up and caught his boyfriend's eye as Draco sang "prepare ye the way of the Lord". And he smiled inwardly, because he'd just had an idea.

"Well, you know what I think," Ron chimed in. "They need you more than you need them. Just tell them to shove it."
"I will, I promise," said Harry. "Bye, Teddy. See you soon."
"Big spoon, definitely," said Harry, smiling as he remembered what had happened earlier. "Tonight, at least. I told you I was going to hug you as often as possible, and this is a good way to start."
Harry snorted, and Hermione looked slightly guilty. "And I've just realised how often I say that," she confessed. "Harry, I'm so sorry. We will try to do better. But do please whack us on the head if we don't manage it. And, more importantly, I am keen to hear the whole story of your encounter with Malfoy – from what Ron's told me, it's a bit of a big deal – but first please do tell us what's been on your mind."
"Malfoy?! What are you doing in my quarters?" he asked, after a moment of stunned silence. His voice was quite a bit deeper than Draco had expected (but then, he told himself, he hadn't actually heard Potter's voice since they were both seventeen).
Harry laughed. "At least they give you a spoon here," he said. "That's one reason I prefer Starbucks to the other high street places – they give you a spoon if you ask. The others only have those ridiculous stirrers, and the froth's not the same without a spoon."
Diagon Alley was absolutely packed with people, including a surprisingly large number of Hogwarts students; the shops were not always open on Sunday afternoons, but this close to Christmas the proprietors were keen to encourage people to spend all their money. Harry's attention was immediately drawn to the front of the wand shop, however, where Professor McGonagall was standing talking not only to Mr Ollivander himself but also to Hermione and Ron, who waved when they saw Harry and Draco.
Draco tried to keep his eyes open so that he could look around the room and memorise it in case he never got the chance to be in it again; he had no reason to disbelieve Harry when he said it wasn't a one-off, but Draco's lack of self-esteem caused him to be wary.
"That's a very sensible way of looking at it," said Draco. "Are the others as calm as you?"
as if you were. You wouldn't have to be near him all the time, and you wouldn't be aware of his feelings."
would, in your position – and I'm sure you'd rather I didn't witness it. In any case, I wasn't lying: I really do want to explore the school. So I'll be a couple of hours at least. If you need me before then for some reason, you can always send Winky to get me."
"No. But that's not unusual – she usually works until at least eight or nine o'clock these days. Her hours were shorter when she was just a reporter, but when I left the Aurors she got the head of department job. I felt a bit bad, actually, when I found out that she'd wanted it for years but never applied earlier because she thought one of us had better be around in the evenings for the kids."
“I have so many questions right now, but they can wait,” said Rabia. “Just one, though, and I think I know the answer but I have to ask: your voice…?”
Lucius and Narcissa had already installed themselves in their armchairs by the window, so Draco summoned an elf to keep an eye on them, before leading Harry and Hermione out of the front door. The grounds were very pleasant to walk through: although most of the leaves on the trees and the ground were brown, there were enough green ones to make an eye-catching two-tone pattern. There were also all sorts of different flowers of various shades of gold, brown and orange, and they smelled amazing. Harry didn't know what any of them were called, but decided that what he liked best was the combination of all of them, so it didn't really matter.
"I’ll look forward to that," said Harry, smiling.
idea?" he asked. "I should've guessed. But why didn't they give you any credit for it?"
"Well, yeah, but I think we both knew at the time that there was more to it than that, even if we never discussed it," said Ron. "And after he told us he was gay, everything made a lot more sense."
Draco took his hand. "Shall I tell you what

"They were," Harry said. "And no, I haven't been using one. But I'm still not sure what you're getting at. Why are you looking so furious?"
Harry gazed at him for another minute before nodding.
On emerging from Heddon Street into Regent Street, they stopped and gazed for a moment at the Christmas lights. "Huh," said Harry. "They're not as impressive as I was expecting, actually. Although the antlery things are quite pretty. Who turned them on this year, do you know?"
"Just over here," said Harry. "Come on."

"I know what you mean," Harry said. "I think it's the scale of it. True, it's just grass, but it looks as if it goes on forever. And having hills in the distance adds to the effect, doesn't it?"
Harry looked at them in confusion, and Draco forgot to breathe.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Studmuffin?!? That's a new one!"
When he stood up again, his eyes became gradually adjusted to the lights, and he saw that the 1900-capacity hall was only about a quarter full, which was still a lot more people than he’d expected for a student recital. He immediately spotted Harry in the middle of the front row smiling proudly; Hermione and Ron were on either side of him, and Molly and Arthur were on the other side of Ron.
He started to reconsider this thought twenty minutes later, when they were finally alone in the last room in the cloisters, next door to Seamus and Dean. Their trunks had all magically materialised in their rooms as they'd stepped inside, and McGonagall had left them all to unpack, stating that she'd see them at breakfast.
"I wasn't really asleep, actually," said Hermione. "I was just resting my eyes. Every time I feel like I'm about to drop off, they come and check on me and wake me up. Anyway, I want to hear about you. Where have you been all these years?"
"Then I'll definitely be there," Harry promised. "Can I bring Hermione and Ron, too? I think they'd like to see it. I've been telling them all about you tonight. They're very impressed with your Patronus, by the way. And so was I, once they explained to me what a big deal it is."
Padma tilted her head to one side to peer at him. "That sounds... unusual. People aren't usually very good at making you do things like that, I've noticed. Who.... oh, wait, I know. It was Draco Malfoy, wasn't it?"
Euston station, it transpired, was more or less closed for the night. The concourse was still open and there were a few staff around, but there were no trains on the departure board, and all the shops were shut. However, a cleaner told them that there was a 24-hour Starbucks at St Pancras, so they wandered along there.
Draco looked mortified. "Of course. I'm so sorry," he said. "Woopy!"
Really?" Draco quickly entered the journey into his computer to check. "Good grief, you're right: it does say that. I agree, that
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, you must know you look amazing in that suit," Draco told him. "You scrub up pretty well. But you do look exhausted. Although it might be less obvious to people who haven't spent years watching you."
"I can't help wondering how much of this is you wanting to solve the puzzle, and how much of it is just you wanting to see Malfoy," said Hermione.
"What's wrong?" asked Potter.

"We do, don’t we? Maybe we’ve both grown up. Yes, please, a drink would be great. I want to know how you ended up here."
"That was the conclusion I came to," Draco admitted. "But there's no rush, is there? We can wait."
"That's part of what we want to talk to you about," said Granger. "Do you mind if we come back to it in a minute? It's just that the cat's an important part of the story too, you see."
Draco couldn't quite tell whether Harry was angry or just embarrassed, but the truth was harmless enough either way, he thought. "Only a couple of minutes."
," said Ron. "You will soon, though. The bond won't let you be apart for quite a while. You're right about one thing, though. Think how much worse this would have been if we still hated Draco like we did at school!"
“Oh, he has,” said Draco, emerging from the doorway. “More than one type of magic wand, in fact, but I’m sure you don’t want to hear about the one in his pants.”
"He also hates not having an actual toilet," Harry told the Malfoys, grinning. "You should have seen his face when he realised he had to go outside the tent and pull his pants down!"

He hadn't been lying when he'd told Draco that he'd felt better as a result of this, and he'd felt even better – oddly enough – after he'd sobbed his heart out for twenty minutes after Draco had left to explore the school. He'd even managed to sleep for a couple of hours before waking and feeling the urgent need for a shower.
Draco laughed, slightly hollowly. "And there we have it," he said. "That's the problem exactly."
"Understood," said Draco. "He might still not talk if I tell him that, of course. But you never know. I mainly want to show him the guy who attacked Harry."
– it's not that big a deal. We'll still spend lots of time together. And remember how I said I can count? All four Houses have got an odd number of boys. So if you and I shared, either Neville, Seamus or Dean would have to share with someone from another House.

He gave them both a quick hug and strode quickly towards the door. As he opened it, the freezing air outside stunned him for a second, so he was still a little bleary-eyed when someone ran up to him and shouted "SIA MALEDETTO!"
"Well, I suppose I do know that," admitted Ron. "OK then. But you haven't explained why you're naked

Draco realised that his parents' house was right on the edge of the village; the open landscape that he had seen from his window stretched away to the north, but in the other direction it was only a few minutes before they were walking past a church, and then a tea room and a pub. The pub, it turned out, had a famous waterfall behind it, and Draco was impressed when his father turned out not only to have a pocket full of Muggle coins, but to be able to identify the correct coins for the three of them to pass through the turnstile.
"Why don't you, then?"

Draco had only intended to remove the top layer, but somehow everything stuck together and the manoeuvre ended with Harry topless.
By the time they reached Bond Street tube, the snow had become quite heavy, and Draco was shivering.
"No, he was surprisingly civil, actually – well, if you don't count the laughing at me and the refusing to believe a word I said, that is," said Draco. "I did write down the hospital details for him, so I'm sure he'll do something about it eventually, although it'll be a lot more complicated than if he'd just come with me. In the meantime, though, what do you want me to do? Is there anyone else who we could try? Someone who might actually believe me?"

the questions were 'Where's Harry?'" said Ginny. "And they call themselves sports reporters! It was pathetic. But then they're always like that, so I wasn't really too surprised. Still disappointing, though."
"The bond can't be broken," said Hermione. "Ron and his parents are right. At least, there are no recorded incidents of a bond ever being broken, and I've also looked into the theory of the actual spell, and I can't see how it's possible to reverse it."
Draco jumped slightly at the new contact, then returned both of his hands to Harry's hair. "You want to tell people?" he asked, seeming surprised. "I thought you'd want to keep it a secret. You seemed quite upset before when you thought
Draco looked at Harry apologetically, and then removed his hand. At first nothing happened, but then Harry gradually began to feel as if his whole body was being pricked by pins and needles. The sensation intensified within a minute, until those same pins and needles were apparently being rammed through his skin and then yanked out at a different angle, every couple of seconds and in a hundred places at once. Harry shouted out involuntarily, and then all the pain stopped in an instant; Draco had replaced his hand on Harry's arm.
"My father told me about how your relatives treated you, you know. I don't know how he knew, but he thought it was hilarious. Actually, I think that might have been the first time I started to realise that my father wasn't always right. I'd noticed that you always looked really skinny every September, but it didn't seem funny once I found out the reason." Draco ran his hand over Harry's belly, eliciting a shiver. "You're not skinny any more, though. In fact, I'd say your body is just about perfect. Your metabolism must be making up for lost time."
Drsco stood with his head bowed until a few seconds after the orchestral playout ended, and then looked up and out into the silence and grinned, which prompt wild applause and quite a lot of whooping.
Harry stared at him, but it was Ron that caught on first. "Ohhhhhh, I see what you mean!" he said. "They probably picked a date and then contacted the London Eye to see if it could be made available that day. And if it couldn't, they probably tried other dates until they found one that would work. And then after it was all sorted out, they told you when to turn up, and you never say no."
"Wow," said Harry. "That's a lot more issues than I've read this

"I presumed you'd just give my note to him at lunchtime or something," said Harry. "What did you do instead?"
"I can’t believe Diagon Alley hasn’t got any Christmas lights up," grumbled Harry. "It looks just the same as yesterday!"
“Hi, Rabia, I guess you must be in on the secret now? I’m pleased - it’s never nice keeping things from friends, but you’ll understand why we often have to. You look amazing, by the way! Like a Christmas cracker!” said Hermione. “Now, where’s the place we need to expand?”
"I'm glad you think so, because I'm not even halfway through," said Draco. "That's just as well, though, because your skin feels even more amazing, so I'd quite like to touch it as much as possible, if that's alright with you?"
in the snow."
thinking about that too, oddly enough," said Harry, rapidly pulling his clothes off and flinging them to the floor. "And I'm happy to oblige. It'll require a great deal of effort on my part, obviously, but I'm prepared to do it... for you."
Hermione fixed him with an unwavering gaze. "What?" he said. "Why are you.... Oh, no. You can't be serious. You're thinking of Potter, aren't you?"
"Oh, you know what sort of things Draco and I like," said Narcissa. "Surprise us."
"Ah, I wondered if Winky might have brought you some of that," Draco commented. "I suspect they put it on tonight's menu in your honour."
"That's one of the disadvantages of your dad being so famous, unfortunately," Draco told her. "Someone would have found out eventually anyway, and then it would only be a matter of time before it got in the papers. This way, your dad has made sure that what's printed is the truth. I know it's horrible, but it's better this way than if there'd been a load of rumours going round and they'd had to make a statement saying which ones were true. By tomorrow, people will be talking about something else."
The silver stag stopped speaking and looked expectantly at Draco, whose grin had been growing through this speech. He laughed. "Please tell him that Floo is fine and I'll be there in five minutes," he told it, and it dissolved into the air.
"Of course I will," Harry promised. "But I'm hoping that if my plan works then you might feel comfortable enough to change your mind a bit sooner."
Harry slumped bonelessly to the floor and pulled Draco down next to him. "Did you... oh, good, you did," he said, running a finger through the puddle of come on Draco's stomach and then licking it. "Sorry I missed it. You're just too mindblowing. I promise to pay more attention next time, though."
"Yes, I've told him," Harry reported, giving Draco a quick hug and kiss. "He... well, he didn't say he

"No, we'll leave Ron to do the night shift," said Harry. "I'm sure he'd prefer that. Draco and I will come back in the morning to help take Hermione home. Is that OK, you two?"

Seeing Draco in the pub was a first, though, but Harry resolved to investigate this another time; he exchanged a nod with Draco and headed for the gaggle of women at the back of the bar.
"As you know, Mr Malfoy, there isn't really anything that we can do for your parents other than what you're already doing," she said. "But, as Mr Potter pointed out, there is something we can do for you, if you'll allow it. The hospital manager has agreed, as a gesture of goodwill in recognition of the fact that you did not receive assistance the first time you needed it, to provide two full-time live-in nurses for the next three years. They won't be you, of course, and it will undoubtedly take a little while for your parents to feel comfortable with them, but we have two people in mind who we believe will be able to do a good job, and they've both already agreed in principle. If they are needed for more than three years, they are both currently willing to stay longer, but you would have to pay them yourself if so."

Draco inhaled sharply. "I'm… agreeable to that plan," he said, a little breathlessly. "But I've got an even better one. It'll be easier if we get out of the sleeping bag, and then we'll get cold, and I'm getting sleepy too, but if you're going to suck my cock then there's no way I'm going to sleep without sucking yours. So, since we want to minimise the time outside the sleeping bag… how about a sixty-nine?"

real, but how could it be?) but there was a phone inside. Just as he was wondering whether or not the phone might work (not that he had any idea how to use such a phone), his own phone rang, startling him, but also making him smile: Draco had insisted on setting up personalised ringtones on Harry's phone, and his own was "Puff the Magic Dragon", which made Harry grin every time he heard it, partly because he obviously always loved talking to Draco, but also because he recalled Draco's hilarity when he'd thought of the song in the first place.
"Well, not as much as you'd think," Harry told him. "It was when we went up to the Manchester office, and I got talking to one of the guys from there, and we had a bit to drink, and he kissed me, and I was startled at first, but then I realised I liked it. I was with him for a couple of months after that, and learned lots of surprising things about myself."
"Listen, mate, I do get it – why you won't Apparate straight to or from here, I mean – but I still think you're mad. No-one will notice!"
"That was my favourite bit, too," said Hermione, when he told her. "He's
"Well, there's a sitting room at the end of the cloisters that we're going to use for an eighth-year common room, and of course you'll each have access to your own House common room whenever you like," said McGonagall. "We don't want to keep the eighth-years totally segregated – we think you'll be an excellent influence on the younger students. We won't allow them in

“That was beautiful, Draco,” said Hermione, dabbing at her eyes. “I must admit that I hadn’t expected you to be as good as you obviously are, despite what Harry said. And I think I’ve heard that song before, but I like your version better.”
"That seems like a good solution," said Hermione. "But what about common rooms?"
Harry noticed that she was clasping her hands together so tightly that her skin was discoloured, and gently separated them, holding on reassuringly. “I promise I’ll get them in somehow, don’t worry,” he said. “I was just thinking it was pretty full, but didn’t realise it was

Later that night, they were back in bed, having turned in for the night considerably earlier than usual. They'd both forgotten about the lack of available time before dinner, which had meant that they had got no further than frantic mutual hand-jobs. Although this was still a lot more than they'd ever done before – despite sleeping together every night, they hadn't ventured beyond hugging and kissing – they were both left frustrated and desperate for more.
," said Harry. "Don't worry."
"Not at all!" cried Harry, raising his hands in surrender. "I was just surprised."
"No, of course not," said Draco, sounding a bit panicked. "The number of people who've heard me sing has already more than doubled this evening. Singing to strangers would take quite a lot more confidence than I currently have."
"I hope so. At the very least, I’m confident he’ll tell me who this bloke is, anyway."
"I'm standing right here, you know," protested Harry. "Please try not to embarrass me too much."
Several hours later, Harry, Ron and Hermione were still seated at the end of the Gryffindor table, but now the remaining eight-years were scattered around an otherwise empty Great Hall. The banquet hadn't been as uncomfortable as Harry had feared: McGonagall had stopped any of the younger students approaching the three of them by the simple expedient of standing beside them as the hall filled up. She'd moved away only when the other Gryffindor eighth-years arrived to occupy the surrounding bench spaces, and by then it seemed that the younger students had got the message. They'd had it reinforced by McGonagall's welcoming speech, in which she had made it clear that she was disappointed with the behaviour on the train, and would not be allowing a repeat of anything similar. Harry wished she could have done it without actually mentioning his name, but he supposed it was as well for her to be absolutely clear what she was talking about.
"No, I don't think so - not many people do while they're at the stage we're at. Maybe you could offer your services to them for next time, though - at worst, they'll say no. I think they might go for it though."
"Now, I'm intrigued about why you think Spike is important," said Draco.
Malfoy winced. "I'm actually pretty sure they

"I'm about as unworried as it's possible to be, right now," Draco reassured him. "Especially if... ah! There it is."
really need the money, as I said, so I would very much appreciate it if you would allow me to stay and help you out."
"Indeed, and that was entirely thanks to you, as many people told me repeatedly at the time," said Draco. "But there were conditions, and one of them was that I had to enter a training programme for a career. I wasn't sure what to do, because nothing inspired me. But then I realised that it didn't have to be a magic-related career, and that in fact it might actually be easier if it was in the Muggle world where nobody knew me."
Harry knew perfectly well that she'd seen him wiping a tear away and had been giving him time to compose himself, and he smiled at her gratefully. "Of course," he said. "Draco, that was beautiful. I think it was my favourite one yet. Although I've loved them all."
"I never bother with Christmas decorations," said Draco. "They're too depressing."

"Oh, none apart from English, really, other than a few words in a few others," said Harry. "But I'm quite good at recognising what some of them sound like. Hermione's been learning a few different languages on some app on her phone, so I keep hearing bits here and there."

"Pleasant though this is, can I remind you about how bloody freezing I am?" he pointed out. "Let's get the bedding sorted out and get inside, and then we can continue."
"I'm glad to
Harry smiled. "Two reasons, again," he said. "The first is that I asked about that wording when I became an Auror – not about your specific case, I mean, but about legal wording in general – and I made enough of a fuss that they changed it, so that now it does say 'person' and 'people' rather than 'witch or wizard'."
"I'd forgotten about Dobby," mused Draco. "My father was so furious when you managed to trick him into freeing him. I was glad, though: it always made me quite uncomfortable, the way he treated the elves. I hadn't realised Dobby was killed in the war, actually – the last time I saw him was when he left the Manor with you. Can I ask what happened?"
As he approached the Science Museum, he reconsidered his usual practice of not using the tube entrance there: he much preferred to walk along the street to the main entrance, rather than through a tunnel, but the tunnel might at least be a bit warmer. There seemed to be something going on, though: there was a small crowd of people at the top of the steps, and an ambulance was parked on the pavement, its flashing blue lights sending eerie shadows across the nearby buildings.
Harry smiled. "Why WOULDN'T I be? Since we started talking last week, I feel as if a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I know we haven't solved all my problems yet, but there are quite a few that I hadn't even realised
"I thought it might be a sort of olive branch," said Draco, leaning forward to give Harry a brief kiss. "I didn't think of that until I'd already changed my entire outfit several times, though. And by that point the red suit was the only one left in the wardrobe, and it struck me that it might be fun to try. I'm not convinced it works, though - do you really think it looks OK?"

years?"
"Well, it will," said Draco. "But you can always take it off again later tonight if you want to. I just think it might make things more awkward if you don't wear it until then."
"Hmm, I know what you mean," said Harry. "But what about your other friends? I know you keep yourself to yourself at work, although now I'm kicking myself for not making more of an effort to talk to you. But what about outside work? What happened to wotsername... Pansy? And your other friends from school?"

look really good," said Hermione, as Harry leaned over to kiss Draco. "And although I did rather enjoy the unexpected show at the cottage, I don't think they're about to repeat it here."
Harry is finding it hard to concentrate on his work, for more than one reason.
I like it, that's all I'm saying. I find it very comforting."
"I'm not sure I would have dared to take books like that out of a public library," mused Draco. "Luckily I never had to, though, because our library at the Manor was very well-stocked. And we had an elf librarian who'd go and buy any books that we asked for that weren't already there."
"Not at all," said Ron. "I can take time off work, and Harry will help too, won't you, Harry?"
"I should've known," he said. "We
Harry's cock, which he'd been interested to note had been half-hard ever since Draco had mentioned going to bed, suddenly became more interested in proceedings, which made Harry's answer to this question a lot more difficult to decide upon.
"I won't wake you unless I'm in dire straits – you look like you need your sleep," said Harry. "Listen, Draco... I can't thank you enough for being so understanding today. I don't know how I would have got through the day without you. It means a lot to me, what you've done."
"We'd be happy to stand with you both, and speak, obviously," promised Hermione. "In fact... ooh, I've got an idea! Speaking might not convince everyone... but I think your singing will. If I hadn't heard you sing, I don't think I would ever have believed how good you are. You should set up a special concert and make the announcement at the end of it!"
"Will you set the table, please, Harry?" Hermione asked. "I thought we might do it properly, with candles and everything. It's ages since we've sat down to a meal together, isn't it? We must get back into the habit."
you're not like that. But my self-confidence isn't really strong enough to believe that you'd want more than a one-off with
"I am too, but I'm sure my father will want to feed us," said Draco. "He's become a bit of a Mrs Doyle since he learned to cook."
Harry went over to open the window. The owl swooped in and dropped a note into his hands, before flying round the room and then back out of the window. Harry sat at the table to open the message.
"Not counting today," Draco reminded him.
Draco smiled. "I wondered whether or not you were aware of that," he said. "Scorpius told me about it. I'm glad you
tedious. I was struggling to stay awake myself."
"It?!" retorted Harry.
"Well, to be fair, it was raining even harder than this in London when we left, wasn't it?" Harry pointed out. "I made a comment last week about it always raining in Manchester. Nearly got my head bitten off by the local Aurors. I think it's a bit of a sore point with them."
"Draco? Anything to add?" asked Rita.
Draco grinned, delighted. Harry merely looked puzzled. "I don't know – why
"But how did you get into football in the first place?" Harry persevered.
Harry sighed. "To be perfectly honest, I'm not even sure I want to be an Auror any more. In fact, I'm not sure why I ever wanted to be one. And being Minister for Magic sounds as if it's a bit like being an Auror but with any of the bits that are even slightly fun removed."
"In a manner of speaking," said Draco. "I had it demolished."
"I don't doubt it," said Harry, grinning back at him. "And, going back to what I was saying before, I'm sure those third-years will be perfectly behaved in the morning. Albus and Scorpius will lead the way, and the rest won't dare not to follow their lead."
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, and Hermione shrugged. "Hmm," said Ron. "Might be worth a go. It’d have to be clear that it would all be reported to us afterwards, though."
He decided that it was the worrying of the lower lip that was the key to the adorableness, and found himself thinking, for the first time, about kissing that lip. As a result, he was startled to find himself being dragged out of the chippy by Hermione.
Ron muttered something that sounded like "by the time they notice he'll be gone", but subsided when Hermione glared at him. "Fine," he said, yawning. "Just thought I'd suggest it. Save you that long walk in the cold."
Draco looked away. "I was too embarrassed," he mumbled. "And there wasn't really anyone there that I knew well enough to feel comfortable asking. So I did a lot of reading instead, and formed my own diagnosis. All the symptoms fit early-onset Alzheimer's, and if it is that then there's no cure, magical or otherwise. Patients just get worse and worse until they die, usually within ten years."

"Thank you again for all your help, Draco," she said, looking up at him. "I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there."
Draco had been squirming more and more and, as Harry sucked his fingers one by one, he was starting to emit low moans. Harry had moved down his body during his exploration, and his head was now level with Draco's groin; it therefore seemed like the obvious next step to move his mouth to the perfect cock that was right in front of him. When he licked a stripe up the side of it, Draco gasped and arched his back. Encouraged, Harry continued to lick, being careful to avoid the very tip of the cock for the moment. Once he'd covered the whole of the rest of it with his tongue, he transferred his attention to Draco's balls, which his fingers had been lightly stroking for the last few minutes. He left his fingers in place as he started to lick, and was fascinated to notice how the balls tightened markedly the instant his tongue touched their sac. He wondered what would happen if he actually took one into his mouth; when he did so, Draco's moans rose in pitch by more than an octave and became more frequent. Harry chuckled despite having a mouth full of testicle, and laughed even more when the sensation of his

he muttered to himself. Then he laughed. "Just wait till I tell Hermione I was right!"
"You wouldn't be intruding at all," Hermione reassured him. "The thing is, although obviously Harry's the most important person to both of us after each other, for a very long time now we've been a couple plus one, rather than a trio. Harry's never complained, but I know he's felt like a third wheel sometimes. In fact, now that I think about it, that may well be why we stopped spending so much time together. So you'd actually be
"OK then. Right. That's... good. Really good," said Harry, feeling suddenly exhausted. "So... what is it, then?"

be better to wait a few weeks, but I don't want to," admitted Harry. "It's been a nightmare this week, not being able to touch you or kiss you unless we're sure we're alone. I don't want to hide any longer. In fact, unless you have any objections, I plan to kiss you right here at this breakfast table, in a minute, in front of everyone."
"Good Lord," said Lucius. "Is that… Harry Potter?"
"Sick of them? Quite the opposite," said Harry. Draco smiled and began.
"I know, and I know you can both look after yourselves," said Ginny. "I can't help it, though. But, you know what? When we get married it'll be great! The bonding spell means I'll always know where you are."

miss your shift," he said. "Promise me that next time we do this we won't have to stop?"
"I'm pleased to hear that," said Draco, who was resting his head on Harry's chest. "Although I hope that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed next time I do it."
Draco opened his eyes and stared at Harry for a moment; a blush appeared on his face. "Erm... Well, I wouldn't claim I loved you before yesterday, but... I have to admit I did realise quite a while ago that I fancied you. I never thought for a minute that anything would ever come of it, though, and I would never have dared approach you even if you hadn't been with Ginny. So you just became... well, someone I've daydreamed about from time to time."
"Ah, Señor Potter!" she exclaimed. "Buenas tardes y bienvenido! Mucho gusto! We are honoured!" She grabbed Harry's hand and shook it; Harry, feeling suddenly much more at ease now he knew that his very rudimentary Spanish might not be needed, smiled at her and allowed himself to be led into the reception area of the stadium and then along a corridor lined with pictures of footballers, most of whom looked vaguely familiar to Harry, although he couldn't remember any of their names.
"You never will," Draco assured her. "It's a housing estate now. But I'll ask them when would be good for you to visit. Is there any evening you're not free? I think they'll say any night is OK for them."
day since, there hadn't been a single moment in which the temperature had risen above freezing point, and so the snow and ice was still on the ground. Harry reckoned this was the longest he'd ever gone through a winter without slipping on the ice, and memories of bruises acquired in previous years ensured that he was keen to extend his record still further.
"I always knew you were a hero," said Harry, grinning as he stood up. "Listen, I also meant it when I said I want you to meet Ron and Hermione soon. D'you fancy doing that tomorrow night? I'm supposed to be going round there then anyway. Ron will have cooked, and I think Hermione's going to make her Christmas cookies."
Draco wrapped his arms tightly round Harry and revelled in the feeling of his cock pressed against Harry's arse. They lay there for a few minutes, getting their breath back.
Harry beamed at him. "It was alright, then? That's a relief. I wasn't sure whether there might be a better way to do it. I was just sort of guessing. Well, actually to start with I hadn't even thought about going that far – I just knew I wanted to touch you all over – but when your cock was right in front of my mouth I couldn't resist."
"Why unlikely?" asked Harry.
the coat."
Draco sat on the sofa and pulled Harry down next to him; he reached for a small jar of candy canes that was on the coffee table, and extracted one, which he stuck in the corner of his mouth. "I'd offer you one, but it'd stop you talking properly, and I want to hear this story," he said.
"Fair enough," said Harry again. "Draco it is. But only if you call me Harry. I get enough 'Potter!' at the Ministry."
"Posh git," said Harry, impressed. "So what happened to all the books when you sold the Manor? Did you just leave them there?"
"Of course," said Hermione, and reached for her wand. "Let me think. Shall we cut the battery off?"
"Well, I want to thank

"Harry, can I speak to you alone for a minute, please?" asked Ginny.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Hermione. "I've seen Harry naked loads of times. Although not for a few years, and never quite so, er, aroused as that," she added, as Harry pulled down his boxer briefs.
Draco felt oddly proud, but thought it wiser not to say so. "So when she said you'd shown no interest in her in a while, was that true?" he asked.
"There's no need to thank me – I only told the truth. And you did send me a thank-you note at the time," Harry pointed out. "But I'm afraid I can't recall the verdict, other than that you weren't sent to Azkaban."

Draco stared.
"We've often wondered whether the badger is because he's a Hufflepuff, or whether he would have had a badger even if he'd been in a different house," commented Harry. "I don't suppose there's any way we'll ever know."
Harry looked pained. "But of course I would have," he said. "Whatever you've done in the past, I would never deny a child the chance to know his family. I would have been careful about what access I allowed, at least at first, but I would never have stopped you meeting him."
Harry was mortified. "I'm... not used to talking about stuff like this," he said awkwardly. "I'm sorry for staring, though. I couldn't help myself."

Harry has lunch with the Astronomy Professor.
"Yeah. It's been really hard, but I think it was the right decision. I hadn't realised how stressed I was all the time until suddenly I wasn't. I feel much healthier these days. I just wish there was a way I could keep things as they are now, but still see all my friends. I'm hoping that one day the world will have lost interest in me, and I'll be able to go back."
"Since we're both aiming to be better at communication, I should tell you that I really do love you, too," said Draco, still beaming. "I know I've indicated it in lots of songs, but I thought I should probably say it at least once, too."
Harry stared at him, shocked. "I didn't know that!" he protested. "
telling them, but if I stay here secretly until Ginny arrives it'll be much easier. I just hope she can get away sooner rather than later – I hate the idea of being stuck in here for days."
Harry watched Draco remove his cloak and vanish into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He heard the shower start running a minute later.
going to have a shower, if that's alright with you. I'm a bit sweaty from all those stairs. Are there more towels in the bathroom?"

"Correct," said Draco. "So, Harry, my thought is this: if they need you so badly, why don't they ask you

"Right. Right," said Harry, his face very flushed. "Erm, please could you come and stand just inside the front door, with your back to the door?" Draco raised his eyebrows, but obeyed silently. Harry turned to face him, with one hand on the banister; he took several deep breaths before speaking again.
Draco stared at Harry, who glared mildly at Hermione. "That was
Draco looked around the room quickly and was pleased to see many familiar faces: he found his mother first, with Andromeda and, to his surprise, Teddy; they were sitting with the entire Weasley family, including various partners. Pansy was easy to spot because she was whooping and whistling; Blaise and Greg, on either side of her, appeared to be pretending they weren't with her. But on the row behind them sat McGonagall and the whole of the rest of the Hogwarts teaching staff, along with several dozen of their older students. Kingsley Shacklebolt was on the other side of the aisle with various Ministry of Magic staff he vaguely recognised; there were, as expected, a lot of reporters at the back, but the last people Draco spotted were Madam Rosmerta and Madam Puddifoot who were sitting very near the front, giggling to each other and grinning cheekily at him.
"I know. They do argue, but never seriously," Harry said. "I'm fascinated to see how their children turn out. I'm sure it won't be long before they start producing mini-Weasleys."
to them both, and I've hardly seen them at all," commented Draco. "Not deliberately; it's just that, since my parents don't have many visitors, they try to spread them out rather than have them all there together and then none for ages. It's a couple of years since I've actually seen them, but my parents tell me how they're getting on."
. I really believed he cared about me. But it turned out he just wanted to get his hands on the Malfoy fortune."
to break the bond. But instead you kept going on about whether or not Hermione might be wrong, so I assumed you were thinking about breaking it," said Draco.
"Exactly," said Ron. "If you don't want any, all the more for me! But never mind that. Harry tells us you're helping him with this Quidditch World Cup thing. We've been trying to do that for a while but haven't got anywhere. What's your plan?"
"Of course we will," said Harry, while Ron was staring at Hermione with a puzzled look on his face. "Oddly exciting?!" Ron muttered to himself, as he went into the kitchen.
how much more of a turn-on it is when it's got
Harry stared at him, then grinned. "I promise that eventually I'll get over this, because I'm sure it must be getting boring, but for the moment I really need to say it: you're using a
"So what's the problem? What is it that you think will happen if you go to Diagon Alley?" asked Ron.
The woman's eyes lit up. "Oh! You must be Harry! My goodness, the way his face lit up when he mentioned you! I'd thought he was a bit of an odd one until then - beautiful voice, though, of course, absolutely beautiful - but he was like a different person. And I see what he meant."
He went into the bedroom to look through his clothes, but then remembered that he hadn't been online since Saturday afternoon. He doubted he'd be able to catch up on his internet obsession in the next two hours, but it was worth a try. The result was, of course, that when Harry appeared in front of him he was still on the sofa in his work clothes.
"Of course Padma bloody well told me. I don't know if you've noticed, Harry, but people tend to talk about you, and that's even
Narcissa opened it a moment later. "Hello, you two!" she said, looking delighted. "Lucius! It's Draco and Harry. Put the kettle on. Come in, boys."
"Harry, I'm close," he said breathlessly. Harry grinned, gave both balls one last firm lick, and then engulfed the cock again with his lips, sucking hard. It was indeed only a matter of seconds before he had a mouth full of come, which he swallowed, licking his lips.
"I can't imagine it will be

"Weird, but incredible," said Draco. He put his thumbs inside the waistband of Harry's boxer briefs. "Can I?"
"Excellent," said Harry sleepily. "Let's have a nap before round two, then, shall we?"
"That looks... pornographic," said Harry.
"Doesn't look as if you need any help to do that," Ron commented. "I can't remember the last time I saw you in this good a mood. So come on, who's put that smile on your face?"
"How can you still be on probation?!? The war ended years ago!"
"We're great
"There must be
They were sprawled on the sofa at Peacock Cottage; Draco's head was in Harry's lap and Harry was playing with his hair. "I'm a bit distracted while you're doing that," Draco murmured, with his eyes closed, "but please don't stop, I love it."
"Huh, I didn't know that," said Harry. "All I know about Yorkshire is the white rose symbol. It's all over the place."
"Dad, have you
"I know - we've talked about this, remember? Try thinking of it as a collaboration rather than them telling you what to do all the time. We have to make them understand that if things go on the way they have so far, you're going to burn out sooner rather than later, and then they won't have you at all. So it's in their best interests to find a way forward that works for you as well as them."
Harry sat up straight. "There's a Quidditch match this morning! I forgot!"
"That does look amazing," Ron admitted. "Hermione, put the light out so we can see better."
"I've never thought of myself as good-looking, so I find that hard to believe," said Harry. "It's nice of you to say so, though. Now, this is all very civilised, but why are our clothes still on?"
Draco reached for Harry's hand and squeezed it. "I think we're singing from the same hymnsheet," he said. "Which is a phrase that totally baffled me the first time I heard it, by the way. But I know what it means now."
"Oh, yes.
"Not at all," said Draco. "Listen, d'you want to bring Kreacher here? Or would he prefer to stay at Grimmauld Place? Oh, and I'll add Ron and Hermione to the wards. Anyone else?"
It looked as if most of the inhabitants of Grimmauld Place had gone to bed by the time Draco arrived, as only a few of the houses were showing any lights. Number Twelve wasn't one of them, and Draco's heart sank: reluctant as he was to speak to Potter, it would make his life a lot easier if the man was actually at home and awake.
She rolled her eyes. "H-A-R-P-S-I-C-H-O-R-D, obviously. It's a keyboard instrument."

has actually got the facts right, for once – I think that's probably thanks to Mum working there – and anything beyond what they've printed isn't anyone else's business. If Mum and Dad had wanted to give more details, they would've put them in the statement."
"Deal," agreed Draco. "If either of us uses the word 'scar', the other immediately says it's time for us to leave, and we get out of there."
Draco studied his face. "You don't want to be Minister? Why not?"
"It'll be pretty dark in an hour, won't it?" said Draco. "It's half past three now, and sunset's about a quarter to four today. I looked it up."

Harry beamed at him. "You're just too good to be true," he said. Then he laughed. "Huh. That reminds me of my uncle's favourite song. Hadn't thought of that in years. It's a great song, which is odd considering he had so little taste. Anyway, thank you. How do you always know exactly the right things to say to make me feel better? You're brilliant."
"I very much doubt anyone will dare to do that. You're still Harry fucking Potter," Draco reminded him.
"I know, I know," said Harry. "I do always mean to. But it’s often quicker to do stuff myself."
"Shower sounds good," said Draco. "And I'm sure I
"OK," said Harry. "And what's the order? Are you last? I hope you're last. There's not going to be anyone better than you, after all."
Harry grinned and redoubled his efforts. He doubted he'd last much longer himself, which was just as well since his elbows and knees were starting to protest. The groans Draco was emitting were extremely satisfying: Draco was always delightfully noisy when they did
"I’m sure," said Harry. "Well, apart from being blinded by the amount of sparkly stuff in this room." They were in Hermione’s office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, on the floor above Harry’s. The office was decorated to within an inch of its life, with tinsel and baubles in every nook and cranny, paper chains festooned across the ceiling, and a huge Christmas tree by the door.
Harry was still trying to process this information. "So you’re a Manchester United fan? How did that come about?"
Draco turned his head and glared at him. "That, and the fact that I'm an
"I know you
“Thank you! So, as I said, I promise I’ll explain everything later, but for now I just need you to keep what you’re about to see to yourself, please. OK?”
"Fine," sighed Harry. "Now, is there a reason for all these candles?"
I hear people singing – it must be Christmas time
Harry stared at her, and then grinned suddenly and squeezed her hands. “Rabia, not for the first time, you are a genius,” he told her. “Now, this is going to take a lot more explanation than I have time for right now, but I promise you’ll get it - but it’ll have to be after the concert. For now… do you trust me?”
conversation, and for that I'm not going to want an audience."
Draco was starting to develop his own theory as to why Harry's marriage had been like this, but he wasn't sure how much of it was wishful thinking, so he put it to the back of his mind until further evidence presented itself. "Maybe the two of you just aren't sexually compatible," he said. "It does happen. What about your partners
Rabia stared at them, then shook her head. “Doesn’t sound like the most romantic conversation ever, but OK,” she said. “It’s all very weird, but it seems to work for you, if the way you look at each other is anything to go by. And I definitely want to hear more about how you’ve found each other again and apparently don’t hate each other any more. Draco gave me bullet points but I need more details! But that’ll have to wait, as our practice room slot starts in a minute and I don’t want to waste any of it. Come on!”
Harry wasn't at all sure that this could be entirely true, but decided to take her at her word. "Well, the thing is... I love the history of the Houses, and the idea that they all have their own characteristics, and even the rivalry – Quidditch would have been rubbish without that, wouldn't it? But I also think that some of the issues that came to light during the war were exacerbated by the fact that the Houses didn't mix much socially, so I was wondering if you might consider removing some of the segregation. Like, you know, allowing everyone to use any of the four common rooms. You could still keep the sleeping areas private if you wanted to, and of course each House would still be responsible for what goes on in their own common room. But I think it'd be really helpful if everyone felt they'd be welcome anywhere. Otherwise, I can't see how things will move forward, and I'm a bit worried about the Slytherins in particular. I think they'll be shunned, and that'll only make things even worse. I'm not saying that if you make this change then everything will instantly be fine, but I think it'd help." His face was hot with embarrassment by the time he finished speaking, but he forced himself to maintain eye contact with McGonagall, whose face had remained as impassive as usual throughout his speech.
