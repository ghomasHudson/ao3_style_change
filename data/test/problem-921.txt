“Now that we have your blood and a few other things from you, we can get to registering you within our Department of the Regulation of Magical Creatures. Name: Deloris,” Lucius stated, filling out an official looking form. “Species: Centaur. Sex: Female?” he looked questioningly towards his son who nodded as he retrieved something.
Theodore blushed at being caught but stood his ground. “I do,” he admitted, “but I am also worried about Alpha,” he admitted. “He looks so … fragile.”
“You are a disgrace to your family line,” Tobias sneered. “Not only that, but you are a disgrace to Mother magic and the world of wizardry.”
“We insist on this happening because it is what your parents wish us to do. The majority of them are worried about what they are hearing from their children and the children of their friends. All of them, however, are disturbed about just how much they are not being told by the Headmaster or the other Professors concerning their children’s health, wellbeing and education. Your families are worried about you – as is expected of them when their world has been turned upside down and one of their children are away from the safety of their home.”
“Well stitch my seams and burn my brimming,” the Hat whispered into the silent hall. “I take every word I said to you back, Milord Black. You are more than Slytherin than Salazar himself! You’d best be placed in SLYTHERIN.”
Tobias swallowed him whole before giving the wettest, sloppiest head job he could. He smirked at the disgusted look on Draco’s face before sinking slowly onto the swollen dick, relishing the slow burn.
Voldemort swallowed half of it before starting to sip at it. “Like I’ve just been pulled through a field by a Hippogriff tag-team. Why do I feel so sick? Can I have something for a headache and nausea?”
“I’ll be sure to tell him you asked after him when he returns,” Draco said with a nod, thinking that, just maybe, muggleborns aren’t all that bad when they assimilate into their world.
Grapplefang watched as the two red-headed males left after conferring with their superior. When the exhausted teen returned to his seat, he smiled, not showing his teeth as a sign of respect.
“Remember,” they heard him say, “He’s dangerous and needs to be treated with utmost caution. The Headmaster needs this to be done ASAP.”
Tom dropped the stirring rod he had in his hand with a slight flush on his cheeks and nervously cleared his throat. “My son is a brat,” was his only reply to the blonde’s question as he turned back to his paperwork.
“Of course!” Fred exclaimed, indignant at the thought of Pansy even thinking the two of them couldn’t.
Bill chuckled. “I don’t think that’s right, but it does have something to do with the status the Weasley family held in the past. The Weasley family – unlike what everyone believes – have not always been a light family, but that is a discussion for another day.”
Luna glided silently through the halls, deep in thought. She had communicated with Kitten – the sentient mind of Hogwarts – and had succeeded in convincing her to allow access to the Room of Requirement through the room in which Ronald Weasley was sleeping. Stepping into the Gryffindor common room, she sent a silent thank you to Kitten who had overridden the need for a password. She smiled slightly as a small movement caught her eye.
Eyes like emerald chips glared at the guilty party when Vince returned with him in his grasp. The crowd grew silent as they noticed fourteen blades buried in three areas – six a hair above the groin, seven in the stomach and one very small and deadly blade buried in the hollow of his throat. Tobias smiled.
Tobias yawned in boredom as he made notes on the reports his Father’s followers were making. It was times like this he pitied his father. He didn’t know how he would survive being surrounded by idiots all the time. He jumped slightly at the hand on his shoulder and blinked up at his husband.
“Bloody brats,” she hissed in her mind, thinking over all the failed attempts of the previous year. “Even now everyone is jumping over themselves to do the boys bidding. He needs to be punished, but how?”
Everyone in the room, bar Voldemort, shivered in their seats at the growl in Harry’s voice. Harry then shook himself and looked at Severus.
Harry, now Tobias, is reunited with his new family for a few days for the marking ceremony of new recruits. Does Draco need to show his support for the House of Lions, or will he gain himself a slave for two weeks?
“I can’t find a way for Ateria and Ateros to break the marriage contract to the Patil twins without them losing all the respect they have earned for themselves. I’ve looked and I can’t find a way out for them.”
Tobias, who had been cuddled into Draco’s side and dozing with his head nestled on his husband’s very comfortable shoulder, jumped at the unexpected noise.
“I suggest we take this discussion elsewhere,” Amelia said between chuckles. “I can tell we will not want to be here for what happens next.” Most of the people in the room looked at her questioningly.
When she arrived at her destination, Andrew Stephens was holding only a rolled up scroll held together with a burnt umber ribbon.
He watched as Tobias finished up his breakfast and stood to leave the Hall, giving Draco a soft kiss on the top of his head. Shaking his head, Severus turned his attention to his own breakfast, so he didn’t see the group that left the tables right after his charge did.
Draco looked at Severus, noticing for the first time that he was giving out a lost vibe that didn’t look right on the normally strong man.
Everyone in the hall watched slack-jawed as an enthusiastic discussion leapt into life at the Slytherin table. The teachers soon joined the students in their shock as most of the younger students laughed joyfully. As the entire house moved out of the hall as one being, no one saw the smirk on Tobias’ face, nor the calculated wink the potions professor sent him.
Just as the room was clearing, Severus stepped out of the shadows and the entrance opened. The sixth years blinked in surprise before laughing. Severus was an interesting shade of purple.
“Yeah, Gran had a couple of them at home. I used to sneak in and play with them when I was younger. One day they disappeared and I never found out where they went,” Neville said with a half-sad smile.
Draco was shocked when Tobias leant forward and placed a soft, chaste kiss to his lips – just a gentle brush of lips really – but where their lips touched was burning pleasantly long after both boys had drifted off to sleep. Tobias’ head resting on Draco’s chest, right over his steadily beating heart.
Bill, when he eventually decided to settle down, surprised no one when he introduced a familiar face as his soon-to-be bonded. Fleur had decided on joining Gringotts after leaving school and had quickly become one of the best Ward Mistress’ in Europe. The two bonded within two months of gaining their Alpha’s blessing and had contributed six cubs to the ever-growing Pack.
“Do you remember that letter we got a few days ago from Tobias? The one asking our permission to court Draco.” Narcissa nodded, confused. “Well, Young Tobias gave him his first courtship gift this morning after getting my letter of permission!”
Luna walked out of the private room, exhaustedly. She looked around and saw Ginny seated at the table with two steaming cups. She walked over and collapsed into the seat.
The device had to be put on in a particular order for it to work properly. First, a long metal thorn with a ball on one end and a flat disc on the other had to be inserted into the slit of the penis, ball end first. Once it was fully seated, the ball increased in size until its position was visible to the naked eye as a slight bulge at the base of the organ it was inserted into.
*looks around the corner of the building* Good news is ... I'm still alive ... bad news? I don't think I'll be able to hear much after this chapter for a while, so remember to talk really really loud
“Sorry to bother you Madam Bones,” the teen before he said shyly. “I just wanted to ask permission for myself and a group of friends to spend the morning down by the Lake. There are a few of us and we are from different houses, so it is difficult finding places large enough to hold us all in an area that is neutral.”
Tobias curled up on the chair and cradled his drink to his chest protectively as he watched Severus drink a high protein, high nutrient concoction that would aid him in gaining the weight he had lost in the past three weeks. Minerva hid her smile behind her own cup of tea. When she had first seen Severus after the incident, she had demanded he tell her everything and by the he had finished, most of her anger at him had dissipated as she had come to realise that he really did have the best interest of Tobias on his mind, but had little to no experience with pregnant women and even less with a pregnant man.
“Question: Explain why you need to study Potions for the first five years of Schooling. Answer: Headmaster Dumbledore wants to test us to see if we really are brave enough to be Gryffindors.”
Lucius cleared his throat nervously. “He and my son were soul bound this past Yule after which it was discovered that he is a natural bearer. There have been several attempts at forcing my son-in-law to abort their child – one in front of Randal and one before the Minister. I only want to ensure that no other child has been suffering needlessly.”
“He’s awake, and it’s worse than I thought. The bands I described to you? They not only prevent him from using his magic, they are also keeping spells cast at him from wearing off, or being diagnosed.” He slammed back the brandy, which Draco placed in his hand, and collapsed into a nearby chair.  Slowly he looked up into Lucius’ eyes.
The Mother smiled. “Normally I do make the two successors first bathe then eat, but it is not normal for us to have a mated pair as our chosen. For mated pairs, the rule is for them to eat then bathe, then meditate so there is no need for them to speak between bathing and meditating – less chance of temptation.”
“Agreed,” Luna hummed, making everyone turn to stare at her. “What? Even though neither of them is here, we know they would agree with it since they were the ones who suggested it to begin with.”
“Just because I said you couldn’t use magic doesn’t mean that you have to stop eating so you can focus on paperwork Love,” Draco sighed.
“You must remember that once we leave here, you are not allowed to use magic at all, not even for lubricant. I know this sounds harsh, but they are the rules,” Booph cut in.
“What have you done to me!” she screeched as she tried to stand. “I demand you return me to normal right this instant!”
“Tobias is scarier,” he happily informed his elder. “I never said that Tobias would never find out,” he continued seriously, “I will tell him what we do and why either tonight or tomorrow.”
Tom entered the Chamber of Secrets with wonder I his eyes. Not even in his youth had he believed that there was more to this place then what he had seen originally. He was astounded by the amount of work his heir had put into his old hideout. He followed the Potion’s Master to the room where the four founder’s portraits hung.
Tobias sighed and helped himself to fruit and yoghurt. “It was called elixir en jeune plaisir – or elixir of youthful pleasure. Taken correctly, it would have slowly interacted with the magic in your body and change your appearance to what it was like when you were younger. Don’t take this the wrong way, Pateras – but you were damn good looking in your youth. In fact, you could have passed as my older brother. The reason it had that effect on you was because you drank the whole vial at once. You, sir, got stoned. One of the main components of that potion is muggle cannabis grown in a magical environment. This meant that the effects of the drug intensified.”
Tobias shifted slightly so he could hide his face in Draco’s chest like a small, timid child. Draco rocked the sun lounge slightly, his heart fighting over whether he should be happy the rave-haired youth allowed him to do this, or outraged that anyone could treat his intended in a way that was beneath what he deserved. Resting his cheek on Tobias’ head, Draco vowed to treat the angel before him the way he deserved to be treated. Deep in his thoughts, Draco hadn’t noticed that Tobias had fallen asleep, nor had he planned on falling asleep himself.
“Please ignore them. I told them it was a bad idea to get the portraits done when Sal was with child,” Helga shook her head. “You have our permission to enter, but please don’t disturb the young Masters – I don’t think either of them could keep awake any longer.”
The Sorting Hat chortled. “Oh yes, I can see that you are most definitely theirs. Not that it is much of a surprise, what with the way you manipulated me in your first year. You, my lad, are Slytherin’s through and through.” Gasps could be heard throughout the hall. The Hat and Tobias ignored them.
“Our guard detail, Bouno – Mountain,” Millicent stepped forward, “Dynamo – Strength,” Vincent stepped forward, still covered in the spy’s blood, “and Skia – Shadow.” Greg moved forward and they removed their cowls as one. When Millicent’s father’s hand shot out to grab her, his eyes widened. He had a dagger at his throat – courtesy of Greg – a bladed staff at his groin – courtesy of Vince – and a curved one-handed sword at his chest, right above his heart – courtesy of Millicent herself.
“And you would know this how?” Tom had walked down from the podium when the strange man had approached his heir.
Blintzy bowed and disappeared with a pop, only to reappear moments later with a man wearing old brown hide pants, a cotton shirt and hide vest all caked in varying thicknesses of dirt.
“But you see,” he continued through the loud yelp that came from the boned, “I don’t. It is a nice feeling, to sink into such lovely heated water – but your arse has stretched so much that I cannot get any friction. We can’t have that now, can we?”
Tobias chuckled. “I was making my sanctuary more liveable. Yes, I have seen the Chamber – in fact that was where I have been all day – scrubbing floors, walls, ceilings and pipes. ‘Cissa, Lucius and Sev are not as young as they used to be and are immensely happy they aren’t the ones who need to try keep up with me. I only sleep for between one and three hours a night, unless I’m either really comfortable or extremely tired and I mark that which is mine – whether if it is beloved, befriended or prey.” He grinned wolfishly.
“Remove it without letting the person under it noticing and get my daughter away from them. If possible, get her to one of the Patils because I suspect that George will react before I can escape the ropes.”
“Not even he knew what he was thinking when he did it,” Sprout answered with a shrug. “As to why they asked for Minerva … well …” she cleared her throat nervously. “Turns out that the old fool not only mispronounced the spell, he combined two spells – one for human transfiguration and the other for non-living transfiguration the healers are unsure as to what can be done.”
“Last but by no means least, we come to the A-Team – Ateria and Ateros,” Pansy announced with a wolfish grin. “We left the best for you two.”
Tobias almost smiled at her. “It’s due to what I went through earlier this summer. My guardians originally came to me because I was restricting my own magic by living in fear of what would happen to me if I didn’t. This summer found me with my magic bound against my will and by people who I trusted to do the right thing by me. My guardians were still there, but as they originated from my core magic, the bands bound them as well. Once the bands had been removed and my magic flared, my guardians also had to release some of their bound magic, therefore binding them to me tighter still. Now, if I am ever in that position again, then the guardians will be able to protect me, and if they can’t do anything due to their power base being locked up, they can force my body to change into their shape.”
“I do not know what my Pack members will encounter,” Tobias stated. “No matter what they encounter through the day, once they are ready to end until the following day, they are expected to use a potion that will leech damaging components from their systems. At the end of each week, however, I wish for them to have a deeper cleansing.”
Amelia nodded her thanks to the man and turned back to the students. “When I call your name, go and line up before the tent with the number that I call first. Tent one …”
As usual, if any translations are wrong please tell me. This goes double for the French translation. I would love to learn a new language, but I have no head for them :'(
The old man sadly shook his head. This mystery about Voldemort’s heir was taking his attention away from his problem with the brat. How in the world did he manage to get the Malfoy family Patriarch and Severus behind him? And even more importantly...What could he do to break apart the young Malfoy and the brat? A gleam appeared in the old man’s eye and he started to make his plans as he absent-mindedly ate his toast and kippers.
“These two were the first members of my pack, Nonos,” Tobias explained softly as he helped his godfather into a sitting position. “They are both loyal to me and me alone, which everyone who has my mark is. They are so loyal to me that even though I can access Pateras’ inner circle, he cannot access my Pack – not without my permission. I will discuss that at a later date. We will not be having a full pack meeting until the Chamber is completed to my satisfaction. Now can we get on with this meeting?”
I would be very happy indeed if you would accept this invitation to join me for dinner tonight. Vincent and Gregory will escort you to our rooms for you to prepare, if you accept. They will also escort you to our table, where you will meet me. You need only bring yourself.
Mr Patterson shifted nervously from one foot to the other. “Do you trust the accused, even though it is rumoured he is a Deatheater?”
“Is that true Lucius?” Narcissa asked, icily, crossing her arms and hiding the still form of Tobias as she moved towards her husband.
Tobias smiled warmly at the woman and curled up on his seat. “Leave the papers the way they are, I’ll finish them after a nap. Don’t ask me why I’m suddenly so tired.”
Tom nodded in thanks “We only have Nona, Anadochos and Nonos to go before your Pack can give their reports. I’m thinking of dealing with that wayward Healer of mine before you start though. I may even be able to obtain a new healer for you – one that is better suited to your condition.”
Minerva stared at the ceiling as the Healer did an in-depth scan on her body. She knew that she would take longer than the other staff members due to her age, so she asked to be done first and requested a cautionary scan of her mind. When the Healer cleared her of mind manipulation, she heaved a sigh of relief, much to Amelia’s confusion.
“Y-y-y-yes m-m-milord.” Wormtail walked past Harry, who growled at him, his eerie eyes full of a promise – You’re next.
Without a word, Draco managed to get Tobias’ semi-limp body to lay face down so he could access his back. He smiled to himself when his husband’s body relaxed far enough to allow him to drift into slumber. Even with his husband asleep, Draco continued to massage the cream into his skin – being very careful to keep himself firmly seated in Tobias’s passage like he had been asked.
He also knew that Sev would go easy on the Gryffindor beside him because he was Tobias and Draco’s second. It had surprised everyone when he revealed that Draco wouldn’t be his second, but his equal and that his chosen second was in fact the klutz of Gryffindor. Tobias indicated that he would gather the ingredients. Neville nodded slightly and started setting up under Severus Snape’s watchful eye.
“It’s not eavesdropping when they are standing outside a classroom door when students are lined up for the class that takes place in said classroom without a barrier around them,” Tobias stated dryly.
“The bitch should have thought of that before touching what was mine. If she had, she wouldn’t be on my bad side.”
He didn’t see the small stool that Hogwarts appropriated for his feet or the jar of eucalypt, lavender and sandalwood massage oil that appeared on the table beside him. Draco and Pansy did. As Pansy lifted his feet onto the stool, Draco rubbed a small amount of the oil into Tobias’ neck. Tobias visibly melted, humming in pleasure.
“Okay, you win Brother,” he said. “We won’t use our ex-family as unwilling test subjects – not that they don’t deserve it.”
“Yes,” Luna hummed. “I’ll meet you all there. I’m going to Ravenclaw to get some more parchment. . My last lot was filled much too fast for my licking.”
Hope that you all enjoy this chapter as much as you seem to be enjoying the other chapters I have posted. On a happy note, I am now up to writing the 47th chapter for this story and I am hoping that the chapters will start to gain in length since some of the later chapters are rather short. As usual, I own nothing that is known, unless you have already read the story, then some of the parts that you know are mine :p (raise hands if I confused you with that *raises both hands XD*) and tell me please if I have any mis-translations :3
“It was sparrows actually,” Xenophilus stated calmly as he lit the lanterns so he could converse properly with them.  “They were getting into Luna’s grass garden and eating all the seed. Gnomes like sparrows. It’s like carrot to a rabbit.”
Draco’s sliver-green eyes flared with lust and the temperature of the compartment rose – bringing The Pack’s attention to the fact that the chill that was evident before had been banished by the arrival of the couple. He pulled on the shirt he had in his hands before pouncing on the minx before him. “You are a tease,” he murmured against the tempting lips.
The goblins who were seated around the room leapt to their feet and crowded around the desk, squabbling in Gobbledegook as sections were pointed out. After several long minutes, the goblins separated.
“I am afraid that we British Patils have lost sight of what our family originally stood for. It is time to change that.”
“He asks us to care for his newest pet name ‘Poke’ because he is fun to poke with a very long stick.”
Harry blinked slowly as he ran an observation on himself through his head. “I still have a dull ache on the inside, Sir, but everything on the surface feels normal.” He hesitated, and then shakily he asked, “Sir?”  At Severus’ nod, he continued.  “These bands? The ones disenabling my magic? When they are removed, does that mean I’ll be able to eat without throwing up?”
“Oh Deloris, why would I want to do that?” Lucius purred as Draco ignored the centaur and set up the small box he had received from Kyria. “After all, you were planning on selling my Grandchild to some unknown man for your own personal gain. Who knows what that child would have gone through had it happened?”
“Allow me, Love,” he purred before kneeling in front of Draco and slowly undoing the tiny buttons with his teeth. Once he had finished, he placed his hands so they were only a hair above the alabaster skin he loved so much and moved them up, gently removing the robe while being so close to touching the flesh he yearned for, yet not quite touching it.
“The resulting blade looks delicate to the point of fragility but is strong enough,” she plunged the blade into the remaining shin,” to slice through bone like it was a spoon through bread and butter pudding.”
Tobias woke up feeling warm and content. He smiled, remembering the events of the night before. To make it even better, he was sleeping with his Drakontas’ arms wrapped tightly around him. He smiled and tried to spin around without waking his husband. Succeeding in doing this, he snuggled into Draco’s chest and allowed his slow, steady heartbeat soothe him back into sleep.
Everyone either nodded absent-mindedly or hummed in response until, at the same time, the words registered.
“Fred wants to court Angelina,” Tobias said with a sigh. “They have been dating for two years. I don’t have anything against Padma joining The Pack because she is a hardworking, discrete woman who will listen to what we have to say, compare it to what she already knows and form her own conclusions. Pavarti on the other hand …”
Ginny smothered a giggle. “I asked if you were going to explain why you want this done and why us in particular.”
Luna raised her head to reveal large watery silver-blue eyes. “My toy broke!” she bawled, her fight against her tears lost as glittering trails flowed down her cheeks.
Tobias guided the blonde into the private clearing and gave him a drink to calm him. Once calm, Draco looked around the area with eyes filled with tears of wonder. Ivy and vines enclosed the clearing on three sides. The open side revealed the lake, dark in the night and reflecting the stars of the clear night sky above it. Along one side of the clearing lay an area hidden behind a woven divider of heather with a border of white daisy and bluebell flowers. The area they were seated in held a living sun lounge of woven vines and Ivy – on which they were seated. In the centre of the clearing stood a table complete with four chairs. Looking closer at it from where he was, he noticed the antique look of it. He thought it might be made of Blackwood or Walnut.
Lucius just pointed a shaking hand towards the room claimed by his son and The Pack – including Severus - ran to see what was wrong.
The Minister blushed slightly and cleared his throat nervously while indicating for the Aurors and Snape to go before him. As they passed Tobias and Draco, Tobias touched Severus’ arm and allowed a little of his magic to trickle down to the cuffs – which vanished.
Forty-five minutes later, Severus, Draco and Tobias were listening to Godric and Salazar explain what they thought might be wrong with him. By the time they had finished with their explanations, Severus’ jaw had connected his chest, Tobias’ eyes were wide and slightly fearful and Draco was dangerously pale.
“I promise,” Draco said with a smile, gently rubbing his nose against Tobias, making him smile tenderly.
Hogwarts herself shivered in disgust. In the Founder’s rooms, a trill and a flash of black flame signalled the departure of Thanatos.
The next morning dawned bright and early, much to the annoyance of the students of the school seated in the Hall. The noise was deafening to the groggy, temperamental Tobias who had decided that the only seat comfortable enough was the one his husband was on. Draco just looked at the man on his lap and started on his breakfast to the best of his ability.
“It means ‘Precious One’ in our tongue. We have been calling The Mother’s Raven this since we knew of his presence.”
“Well,” Draco announced, sounding neutral, though his eyes shone with laughter. “It seems this year, at least, is going to be interesting.”
“You look like a needy slut dressed the way you are,” Harry whispered heatedly into Draco’s ear. “Only sluts wear such clothing while working in a Lord’s Manor. Tonight, you will be nothing but a whore to be used. You will not cum unless I let you and you will do EVERYTHING I say.”
“You aren’t Draco,” Tobias stated, noting that the other Patrons were watching them closely while acting like they weren’t; including a dark faced George Weasley. “You got several things wrong when copying him. First, his eyes aren’t that colour. Second, his hair is longer, shinier and not as white and third, he never sneers at me neither does he ever silence our daughter, no matter how much she screams.”
Two hours later, Draco felt the ties around his wrists loosen considerably. Without a thought, he grabbed Tobias’ hips and thrust into him hard enough to snap him out of his blissful trance.
Severus’ face paled. “You didn’t,” he whispered. Tobias, Neville and Draco just grinned at him. Severus swayed slightly, pale green coming up in his cheeks.
Lucius visibly shook himself from something only he could see and turned eyes that held less warmth than ice-chips onto each member who was watching him silently. “She had been hit by bludgeoning hexes and cutting curses until she was almost dead and our child was. Tests confirmed Narcissa and I were going to be the prod parents of a little girl – the first female Malfoy born to the main line in over five hundred and sixty years. She was three month in utero. A perfectly formed human being, only just big enough to sit in one of my hands. After we had named and buried our daughter, I attended several mind healer appointments with Narcissa, watched those responsible for MY DAUGHTER’S death get a slap on the wrist and joined the Dark Lord the following week.”
“What would I do though?” Tobias asked. “I like doing my assignments with The Pack, same with homework. I have no books I’m willing to read because they’re all boring and Pateras won’t send me any more due to him not wanting  me to over work,” Tobias pouted while Draco drew him into his side, chuckling softly.
“So I’m going to assume that they won’t be awake any time soon,” Minerva sighed, putting her cup down.
Draco stayed wrapped around the centre of his universe until he sensed he was ready. The Pack, to Severus’ surprise, took turns to reach out and touch their leader.
As one they looked down at the paper they held and nodded in satisfaction. They could not wait to see the results of this.
Tobias nodded. “It is very useful, but a pain in the arse. I love Rowan though. And Helga is lovely. Hey Pateras? I think I know why you used to act like a Gryffindor with your plans, at least where they concerned me …” Tobias quickly ducked the hand sent to swat at his head. Chuckling, he turned to him. “Can I be blamed if we both have mixed Slytherin/Gryffindor blood in us?” he smirked as his father froze. “Yeah, Sal and Ric were bonded. They had at least two kids together too. You are descended from one, mum and I from the other. No wonder we are both fucked up. We are Gryffindors with Slytherin tendencies … or is that Slytherins with Gryffindor tendencies?”
“He … She … Our baby … really?” Draco asked in a horse whisper, eyes not leaving his husband’s hands.
“He was my Father’s best friend,” Lucius stated. “He was given the position of Uncle in my life and before he went insane, he was a stand-in Grandfather to Draco. Everyone joined knows everyone else’s reasons for joining but I am not going to tell their stories. I told mine because Wu needed a reason to do his Merlin-cursed job!”
“What is your guardian today, ‘Bi?” Draco asked softly. Almost instantly a raven Black Panther with blue/white eyes was giving Draco a cat’s smile, then she was gone, leaving behind a sleepily smiling Tobias.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Lucius said as calmly as he could. “How much do you give your silent partner on average?”
Tobias looked him over, taking in the slight flush, the new clothes and the blonde hair, which had been tied back with a slightly sparkling green-grey ribbon.
Once both Draco and Tobias were seated, Severus appeared with Tobias’ potion. Once more the members of The Pack continued to do their own thing. When none of them bated an eyelid at the enthusiastic way the potion was drunk, many of those around them realised just how common this occurrence was. Severus wasn’t the only person there to watch him drink it with sorrow in his eyes.
Draco smiled and bowed his head slightly, vowing to do as the god had suggested and never make Tobias, their pack, parents and any children they may have feel as if anything was more important than them.”
We used to have group desks set up for tutoring purposes,” the stern woman answered in a surprisingly soft voice. “Teachers would assign the top students of each year to give up one weekend a month to help the strugglers of the classes. If a student couldn’t make the time – like for instance they were the top student in another subject – they could request a one-on-one meeting with either the teacher or the tutor so they could get the help they needed.  That was stopped when Dippit became Headmaster at the insistence of our current Headmaster.”
“Now, back to what we were talking about before the joker appeared. This is my Beta. You will treat him with respect as he is my equal. His name is Drakontas – Dragon.” Draco felt his cowl fly back to reveal his face.
With that settled, both men looked around the tunnel they were standing in and gaped. Severus remembered what this area looked like before and felt his jaw drop as he took in the sight before him. Walls that had been grey with dust were now a gleaming black. There were no cracks or any other type of damage to be seen anywhere.
“Harry, just go to the normal bed you are put in. Draco, you go to the bed that is as far away from him as it is possible to be. I’m disappointed in the both of you.”
“What most people here in Hogwarts don’t know is that A-Aunt Bellatrix isn’t scared of Tobias – She’s terrified of him. For two weeks Tobias used her as a guinea pig to test out all his favourite curses on – not including the amount of crucio’s he sent at her just for fun. When the Dark Lord told him to stop before he killed her prematurely, Tobias locked her in an empty room with no light and, using a projection spell, forced her to endure a week of non-stop Bambi. It just played over and over and over without stopping. Mother was sent to retrieve her at the end of the week. She was pale and jittery. When she saw the Dark Lord, she bowed to him, shaking slightly. When she saw Bi, she flinched back, curled up in a ball shaking whimpering, ‘please, no more. I’ll be good, I promise’.”
“It’s been a long week,” Amelia admitted with a tired smile, “and it doesn’t seem to be getting any shorter.”
“What is it?” Blaise asked, looking at the odd box contraption on the table. It had a strap attached to the base, on which another, smaller box sat. The smaller box had a handle on one side. It looked old and flimsy.
Severus chuckled. “Or I could just tell him that he needs to have his paperwork sorted out and that you’ve offered to help him with both that and any general repairs that need to be done – under the guise of punishment, of course. We can’t be letting on that both you and he are on the same side of the war.”
“I know that I haven’t said it much, and contrary to how I treated you when you were younger, I am, and have always been proud of you Neville. You are deserving of the Longbottom heritage – and I am honoured and proud to have you as my grandson.”
“There now, Nonos. That wasn’t so bad now, was it?” Severus just growled at him and left the room, highly embarrassed.
“You should go to him,” she said with a soft smile. “We can finish this: You need sleep and your husband.”
Sitting on the outer arm of each chair was a female with strawberry blonde hair and bright emerald eyes winking at the camera before gently kissing the closest parent to them. Jessamine and Kilandra were the Marauder’s legacy and were known most commonly for their habit of wearing headbands with fox ears and a belt that had two fox tails attached. They had been born two years after Mary-Lou.
It wasn’t until after lunch that anyone who wasn’t centaur saw either Draco or Tobias. Unfortunately for them, it was Pansy who saw them first.
Pansy, Millicent and Blaise stood to allow the three adults to sit. Their jaws dropped when Narcissa and Lucius had to lead a glaze-eyed Severus to the seat and force him to sit.
“I first met Randal - Tobias’ adopted father – a few years before I joined the Death Eaters. He had found me after I had run from the house after my Father got drunk. He talked me into allowing him to fix the cuts and bruises I was covered in, then he left, leaving me his address just in case I ever needed to escape. I didn’t see him again until the day before the Dark Lord vanished.”
“What?” Lucius’ head spun around to look at his son so fast it was surprising that his neck didn’t snap. “Oh for the love of … GET A HOLD ON YOURSELVES! THIS IS THE GREAT HALL, NOT YOUR BEDROOM!”
Shaking slightly in rage, Severus turned his attention to healing his patient to the best of his ability.  For every mark he healed, there were two he couldn’t. The worst of these, to Severus’ mind, were the multiple cuts to Harry’s lower arms and thighs.  They indicated to him that the treatment he had witnessed in that room had occurred before.  Why hadn’t anyone noticed?
“What’s so funny?” Draco yawned. Blaise handed a newly developed wizarding photo to the blonde, who went bright red as he looked at it.
Draco tried – unsuccessfully, he admitted ruefully – to not laugh at his father and godfather as they sat in their seats, dripping with nutrient potion.
“Yes,” Draco said with a look of love and pride at Tobias. “I wasn’t convinced I would want more than one in the beginning,” he admitted. “Firstly I wasn’t sure I would be good with them and secondly, but more importantly, I knew nothing of male pregnancies and it concerned me. I love Tobias,” he said firmly, “and if he was going to be endangered, I would not have more than one.”
Tobias sat between Pansy and Vincent watching Neville and Millicent playing a game of chess. He smiled softly when he looked around and saw all bar three of his Pack around him.  He thought of the two girls that were sitting in a special room in the Ministry, privately sitting their N.E.W.Ts.
Tobias looked up and all three men shivered at his eyes. They were the eyes of the dead – dull and lifeless. “Dumbledore walks through the door. H-He puts the bands on him and casts the same spells as he did me, then he pays Vernon and Dudley to beat him until not one bit of him is left untouched.”
“Trapped,” he answered honestly. “I’m stuck in a cage. I want to go outside. I want to see PEOPLE. I understand not wanting me to go to the classes we share with the Gryffindors, but forbidding me from going to History of Magic which only has four other people in it – three of whom are our Pack and the other is the person whose sister is buying us the muggle foods I am craving at the moment is going too far. I’m lonely Draco,” Tobias admitted, tears in his eyes. “I see you for meals and bed. I see the rest of The Pack – bar Nev, Gin and Luna – for breakfast and dinner and I see Nev, Gin and Luna in passing on my way here once a day. I don’t even see Severus. He just locks me in here and disappears.”
“And here we thought she couldn’t get worse looking then she was originally,” Fred stated seriously to his nodding twin.
Draco nodded, fighting the urge to swoon. Who would have guessed that deep down the Slytherin Ice Prince was a romantic?  Not Draco that’s for sure. When Tobias raised the Ivy to one side of the shrub and led him to the entrance for his first glimpse of what lay behind it, Draco lost his fight.
The rest of The Pack and the three remaining adults looked at the two of them in awe. They had all felt the strain the wards had been under to contain the magic leaking from the two before them. Tom ended up admitting that they would be best in the place the Daemon’s were talking about.
Albus sighed. He needed to get more information and he needed it now! As he couldn’t get that information now, he decided to have a bit of fun planning the destruction of Harry’s support base – and he would not call the bloody brat Tobias. He was named Harry by him and that was that! Albus rubbed his eyes, tiredly. Maybe it would have been easier for him if he had chosen Neville to be his scapegoat, but at the time, he’d needed the Potter’s dead, and the boy had so much power he could drain from.
“I can’t believe it! Both Malfoys and Snape are traitors to our Lord! How dare they. Why should we listen to them anymore? When the Dark Lord hears of this, I hope I’m there to watch him punish them. They deserve nothing less than Crucio for this! And Potter –”
In the blink of an eye, Draco had somehow managed to change direction so he was before Tobias with one arm around his waist and the other resting on the back of Tobias’ head. “I wanted to spend the evening with you, honestly I did Love, but Father dragged me from the dining Hall and stuck me to as seat when I tried to leave after hearing he wanted to talk about things that could wait to be done tomorrow. I’m sorry baby, please forgive me.”
Harry nodded without hesitation. “It is dikos mou lykos. I need some stability in my life, and Pateras is the most constant thing in my past, so it stands to reason that he will be my stability now I’ve lost Siri.” Harry smiled at Voldemort. “Just keep me away from Wormtail and Bellatrix. I owe them both a death sentence. Bella for killing Siri and talking to me as if I had her intelligence,” his eyes glazed over as he remembered something. “But I do have her to thank for me learning Cruciatus, so maybe I can reduce her sentence to showing her how proficient I am at it now.”
Tom poked out his tongue before getting a mischievous look in his eye and launched himself at his son. “Mmmm cuddly,” he stated as he snuggled up to his laughing son, who was now in his arms. “Let’s get ready for this meeting. You will be sitting with me.”
Tobias shook Achalendra’s hand and gave an exhausted smile. “I’m glad we could sort everything out today. I hope to have the chance of working with you again in the future.”
Luna looked up as the door opened to reveal Severus carrying a deeply sleeping Tobias close to his chest and sighed in relief. She had decided that even though Tobias had told her to plan a girl’s night, that for now she would stay with the rest of The Pack since it was they who gave her the love, comfort and strength she required to face her – potentially ex - housemates every day. That isn’t to say that she wasn’t going to follow his advice, she would just make it for when lessons re-started so the Slytherin girls had something to look forward to as a break away from the stresses of being pure-blood maidens.
He growled in annoyance as Dobby – the fanatical house elf that would never do anything to harm the dark-haired teen appeared with the young man’s food and potions. There went his plan of ordering the House-elf that prepared the annoyance’s food to lace it with something. He really regretted allowing that creature to remain free when he started working at the school. Who could have known that the annoying creature would survive what was normally a death’s sentence to a normal house-elf? He sighed. What plans had he left?
Severus blinked the question not what he was expecting. “Why do you w… Oh. Um … Draco. Do you think you may be falling for your betrothed?”
Severus glared at his godson. “To say that I am disappointed in you, Draco is an understatement. You wanting to cheapen the relationship you have with Tobias with a quick tumble before being bonded to him is something I thought was beneath you. To put his life in danger because of it is pathetic. You are lucky Neogennito loves you more than life, because if he didn’t, I would kill you now just to get him out of the contract binding him to you. So help me Merlin if I lie.” Sev looked down his nose scornfully at Draco.
While the three men were talking, none of them noticed that the noise level had started to fall until only a soft murmur was left as the younger years left. It wasn’t until Minerva stood again that the three men noticed the change.
“That was one of the effects of The Pack mark, I’m sorry to say. We have a long weekend ahead of us and tonight we will be binding The Pack together as such. Tomorrow night we are taking our rightful places within Pateras’ group. There will be threats, there will be curses and there will be death – none of it for me and mine, I can assure you.”
“That sounds best, maybe I should ask someone else to take the detentions you had lined up for tonight.”
The Indian man looked up and around at the group around them. His eyes settled on his sulking oldest daughter and he sighed.
“I did,” Tobias said, looking at the man from over the rim of his teacup. ‘We have everything we need except for one thing.”
Once the words were stated, Remus pounced on the other man and with a murmured apology for what he was about to do, bit down as hard as he could on the flesh behind his left ear. He waited until the magic building in the air settled itself deep inside his chest before letting go of the spot, licking the blood gently from the wound, whining apologetically. It wasn’t until the wound closed that Remus noticed his most precious object had fallen asleep where he sat.
Lucius smiled gratefully at her and opened the door to the Hall, gesturing her to proceed before him. “Thank you for your time.”
Tobias nodded. “Um … Sev? Would it be okay if I had that yoghurt stuff for breakfast today? Please?”
Severus gained awareness of his surroundings slowly until one voice in particular made his attention snap.
“Yes, he is,” Narcissa stated icily, still glaring at the man. “And he is currently on my ‘wish to kill but have been ordered not too’ list.”
Three hours and four calming potions later, Tom was seated in his office chair looking around in awe. The room looked much larger now that it was cream and tan in colour. The window was clean and open, letting in fresh clean air and natural light. All of the chairs found in the room were all cleaned of all stains and were comfortable to sit on. The book shelves along his walls were empty, but had been polished and each shelf had the topic of the books intended for it burnt into the front of it. The desk … Tom felt his breath catch every time he looked at his desk.
“Then seventh years are our aim for today,” Lucius stated before turning to Amelia. “Have you thought more on Bi’s proposal?”
“I’d better get him back to bed,” Draco sighed from his position on his back with Tobias collapsed on his chest and stomach. “I know that it isn’t good for him to skip a meal, but he can’t eat like this.”
Tobias blinked stupidly at the speaker before turning back to murmur compliments to his owl. The speaker grabbed the front of his school uniform and pulled him so they were almost nose-to-nose.
“If it does, then between the three of us, we should be able to occupy his mind long enough so he doesn’t demolish the house only to rebuild it by hand.”
Severus smiled. “I think you should try it if you want to do it. Just remember to pick your employees carefully.”
Tobias couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m terrified, Pateras. I’ve gone from having no-one, to being surrounded by people who genuinely care about me, and it’s happened so fast. What if I stuff it up? What will I do if I drive him away? What if I’m not good enough for him?”
Ron sighed in relief as the pieces of bridge spun slowly around him and each other as they came together as though someone had cast a reparo spell on the pieces. He grimaced slightly as the stone he had at his back turned to rough wood and dug into his flesh. He relaxed slightly as her heard the verse sung once more, but his blood froze when instead of going for a third time, the eerie soprano took over once more.
Last, lying on his stomach on the ground before the pregnant man and being used as a foot rest was a doe-eyed male with Platinum blonde hair whose mind was obviously far away from the matter at hand. That man’s name was Lars and was born only four months before Remi.
The Pack watched with laughter shaking their forms as their Alpha and the Dark Lord squealed happily and hugged the Potions Master at the same time.
Draco nodded and clicked his fingers. When Dobby appeared, he handed the two half-empty jars to him. “Keep them safe. They are for Bi.” The elf nodded and disappeared with a pop. The sixth year Slytherins left together, causing the majority of the Professors to smile indulgently.
Draco smiled at the sight that greeted him when he entered the Potions Master’s private rooms. Severus was seated on his favourite armchair – a pale green fabric thing that Draco believed would be more at home in a museum dedicated to the early ‘50s rather than in the sitting room of his normally fashionable godfather. In his left hand he held one of the books he’d been given for the yule-tide holiday – the one on warding – and in his right he held a cup of tea. On his lap sat the white and caramel cat that an eight-year old Draco had found and given to him for his birthday.
This worried Tom. He knew that his son was clinging to the chance at spending time with his betrothed before they had to separate, but he had the feeling that Tobias was beginning to become dependent on Draco to keep him sane. He sighed heavily. The following fortnight will be hell for him. He’ll have to talk to him after all.
Lucius looked at the man meaningfully. “AS long as she is alive and has been fed and watered properly at the end of her time with you, she is yours to do as you wish. Did you need any aid in transporting her or keeping her under control?”
“Our beast speaker, Hemerotes – Tamer,” Charlie stepped to the front and removed his cowl, “and our dark mage, Katara – Curse.” Bill stepped up beside his younger brother and removed his cowl. The two of them separated, but stayed at the front of the cleared space.
Draco grinned in response. “He threw a temper tantrum that any toddler would be proud of. He screamed at her for an hour before sitting in a chair and stuck it and him together by gluing himself to the chair and the chair to the ground using two over-strengthened sticking charms. Nothing anyone said would make him move until Neville got the idea to get Randal back. He got Tobias to go with the hag by saying that his Healer to stay with him at all times. You should have seen the look on Umbridge’s face when she realised that the Healer was Algernon Longbottom and she couldn’t order him around. When she tried he looked at her and said, ‘I only take orders from the parents of my patients or those who are over-run by pregnancy hormones. Last I checked you had no children and you are far too old to be pregnant so shut up and stay away from me.’”
Tobias kissed the top of his head, whispering, “thank you dikos mou Drakontas. I needed that. What was the school’s reaction to your new look?” He asked, indicating the red and gold silk he was resting his cheek on.
She grabbed hold of Tobias’ hand and pulled him into the kitchen behind her, knowing that both her parents would have heard that last little bit about Hermione and Ron and secretly celebrated it.
“It is also possible to exchange one member of the Patil family for another regardless of which branch they originate,” Grapplehank added. “Unfortunately for Mr Weasley, it is non-negotiable for him; neither can both changes be done to the contract. It is one or the other.”
Both lists glowed blue then silver, transforming themselves into marriage contracts in Lucius’ hands. Blinking, Severus looked at the two before them, to the contracts then to Lucius, who seemed just as shocked as he was.
With one last grin, Luna returned her voice to her normal dreamy tone and began to once again sing the short song.
“I would if I didn’t know that they would deserve it. Mother only loses her temper when someone disregards one of her laws – or one of her guardians.”
“It’s the same story for the females, I’m afraid. Hermione has been looking for the name, history, recipe and contaminants of the blood nutrient potion you’re taking. She wants to know why you have to take it and finds it suspicious that you drink it with as much relish as you do. She doesn’t believe that what she, Ron and the Old Goat made and forced you into over the summer created the need.”
A soft chuckle bought both teens from their place in a world away and they flushed in embarrassment.
No one saw Tobias after that until halfway through dinner that night. Draco felt his jaw drop as he watched his betrothed glide into the Hall, his hair, skin and clothing making his eyes look deep and hypnotic. All movement stopped as he walked to the Slytherin table and placed a gentle, almost loving, kiss on Draco’s head before sitting and taking a small amount of a salad containing chicken, cashews, and rocket. Draco and Severus noticed that he didn’t eat much of it.
“We accept,” Pansy confirmed. “I was starting to feel as though I would cast an unforgivable at someone to keep myself from going insane!”
“I wonder …” Ginny mused, eyes taking on a clouded look. “I will be right back.” She vanished, only to return twenty minutes later deep in thought and escorted by four furious men.
Pansy nodded. “Both your parchments are the same. The two of you are to focus on your jobs. If anything else pops up, just add it to the list and send a message to either Alpha or Skoteinos outlining what it is about.”
Draco stood in the centre of the garden fidgeting slightly. His outfit set off his hair and eyes. His stomach was jittery and he couldn’t wait until he could see his fiancé again. A small commotion at the door drew his eyes and his heart jumped when he caught sight of his beloved’s father and he struggled to bring liquid to his now dry mouth.
“The followers you no longer want nor need,” Tobias replied, “And a bit of your hair,” Seeing the looks being sent his way, he sighed and told the two men his plan and was rewarded by two astounded faces.
“If you are thinking that I am asking for my two Pack members to come here once a week for a deeper clean, then yes,” Tobias stated calmly as he placed his empty mug down. “The worker who is in contact with them will join them. We will pay ten galleons per treatment,” he continued.
Both twins grimaced as George swallowed it and his skin rippled as though hundreds of small insects were crawling beneath it. Within minutes, a replica of Ronald Weasley stood amongst them.
He was five steps away from his destination when his eyes widened and his hands flew to the now obvious bump.
Tobias nodded. “Your job will be to create and cook my meals and snacks every day. If you agree you will be given a list of my dietary needs and the potions that I need to take and the times and amount I need them. As payment you will get a ball of wool every fortnight and a pair of socks as a bonus every six to twelve months.”
“I guess this means we are going to their rooms then the library,” Millicent stated softly after several moments. “I have something I want to look up.”
Severus’ shock showed on his face. He had not known how much the potion Tobias had made had affected his Lord. He also had not known that his Lord had come to see Tobias as his own son. He smirked internally. He’d love to be a fly on the wall if Tom was ever to meet Dumbledore after the Headmaster had harmed his son in some way. It would prove to be extremely entertaining.
Tobias heard the sharp intake of breath from Severus. He continued as if he had heard nothing. “When ordered to kill them, their friends refused and were tortured into insanity. These were Frank and Alice Longbottom. The person responsible for the death and torture is going to pay – but first I need to be able to get to him.”
The winning team will receive five points, second will get four and so-on and so-forth down to fifth place that receives one point. The winning team of each event gets a small prize and the overall winners will get a larger prize. Now teams, choose your contestants.”
“I came to say it is time for the four of you to get some sleep. Whatever it is that you are doing can wait for tomorrow. I have cocoa for you so you can relax before attempting to sleep.”
“It’s alright, you can remain seated Lords.” Ruen said, amused. “Tonight is about the two of you. We have agreed to join you because you show us the same degree of respect as you do to those of your own species. You do not need to show that respect to us all the time. You are members of our herd now.” The centaur smiled.
“Truly youngster, I did not intend to laugh at your plight. It is just … You remind me of how I was the first time Sal was with child,” Godric chuckled and shook his head. “You think seeing your husband acting like this is odd? How do you think I felt when mine took to skipping around the castle with a big beaming smile and happily humming?”
Ginny and Luna walked along behind him, talking about whether or not nargals would live in a periwinkle forest.
Severus pulled away slightly and looked into Remus’ eyes. “It will be a lot of work for you to prove it to me Remus,” he said softly. “Our relationship has been on eggshells since the incident with Black.”
“Just because you are a Prefect, Mr Weasley, does not mean you can take bribes to not take points from people,” he purred, laughing internally at the look on their faces. “After all, no human would willingly attach themselves to someone like you if there was nothing in it for them.” The girl – a fourth year Hufflepuff he realised – flushed with embarrassment as tears filled her eyes.
Waking up, she noticed the faint sounds of an argument coming from down stairs. The scene in the sitting room was enough to make her choke with anger – ‘Harry’, as Tobias was still playing, was being alternately lectured and yelled at for getting up at three in the morning to go to the loo without waking either Ron or Hermione before doing so.
“Before you go,” Lord Patil said, standing. “Can you give this to young Mr Malfoy-Black? It isn’t important enough for him to handle it immediately, but it does concern the topic he and I discussed earlier today.”
“This meeting is dismissed!” Tom yelled before running out of the room, leaving confusion in his wake.
“Are you alright Amelia?” Minerva asked, taking in the exhaustion written all over the younger woman’s face.
Draco felt his throat close and his heart pound when Tobias smiled at him. He now understood where The Mother was coming from. If they had to only meditate, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop himself from touching – or tasting – his beloved.
His attempts at getting the annoyance to the infirmary to destroy the life growing inside him before anyone knew about it had failed, as had the plans of getting the Weasley boy to make the boy abort by burning the herbs he had given him.
“Of course I do,” Tobias stated. “I and my Pack believe that the way wizards have treated those they classify as beneath them is atrocious. Donating our magic will mean that we aid in protecting our money, our allies and the centre of the magical half of the United Kingdom.”
“… Touch me you foul, blubbering piece of rat shit! You cowardly piece of whale lard! Get these off me and then face me, instead of chaining me like a …”
Draco couldn’t keep the fond look off his face as he watched Tobias. He looked so at home. Still smiling, he made his way to the lounge the raven-haired youth was sprawled on. Tobias opened an eye slightly and smiled slowly. To everyone’s surprise he sat up, allowing Draco to sit behind him before leaning back against him. Both boys hummed in contentment.
Tobias laughed at that one and nodded. “I will try do what you say Professor.  It may take a while, but I’ll do my best.”
“I can’t do any more of this sheet,” she announced giving Theo a thankful smile as he released her hand, only to give Blaise’s hand the same treatment. “I need a textbook for it.”
As quietly as he could, Severus crept into the receiving room where Remus was napping on a poorly transfigured bed that used to be an uncomfortable three seater that had been stashed in their room. Severus smirked to himself before creeping up to his lover and blowing a soft stream of air into the unprotected ear closest to him.
“I guess you are just lucky,” Remus stated, trying to hold in his own laughter at watching the two men snuggling into his lover.
Tobias smirked in pleasure. “As the questioner at a trial concerning an adult in direct contact with one or more minors where the minors are called upon as witnesses, all minors are to be asked the same set of question’s per rule 33 Section C Paragraph 4 lines 3-8. So either do your job properly or step down and allow someone who can do it take over … like a flobberworm.”
Taking it into a small room off the dining room, Harry curled up on a chair to eat and read. This is where Severus and Remus found him half an hour later.
A soft ‘hem hem’ entered the conversation. “If your son got another student pregnant, then both of them should be expelled for improper conduct in a school.”
Zog grinned. “I AM here on Official Business, Akzant’tra. I am here to congratulate you on your bonding and to present you with The Mother’s gift. Booph will be arriving soon from The Father, but first, I think we have an explanation to give.”
He took his precious burden into their room and tucked him into their bed before leaving a note on his own  pillow before heading out to try to get comfortable on the very uncomfortable and lumpy lounge that had been put into their room for storage.
Algie turned green at the thought while Draco swirled his spoon through his soup, suddenly feeling much less hungry than he was before.
Everyone in the Pack froze when the first of their members was called to the front. With the assurance that every eye from The Pack was encouraging her, Millicent confidently strode to the dais, ignoring all the gaging and bad mouthing that was going on behind her about her muscular physique.
Minerva laughed softly as she looked up from helping the few students who had come to her for help to see one of her favourite students reading a piece of parchment with his nose scrunched up and taking long, slow blinks as he fought off sleep. She pat the first year she was helping on the head softly, disregarding the colour of the badge on her uniform, and made her way back to the pregnant young man.
The three of them turned and faced the silent group. Tobias chuckled when he saw the light in Remus and Sev’s eyes. Neither of them could pass up the opportunity to question an Earth Daemon. They had a suspicion that they would think they were in heaven when they met Booph.
Severus went quiet, still stroking his arm with pain-filled eyes focused intently on the bare skin. Amelia waited patiently and in utter silence. She had not expected this when she had bought up the lack of dark magic coming from him, but she was happy that it was her that was overseeing this one and not someone else.
Luna absent-mindedly ran her finger though Ginny’s hair. Both girls had wandered towards the lake mid-morning and had settled into an easy silence. She looked down at the head in her lap and smiled. She had always wished that she’d had a sister, and now she had one in the fiery girl dozing in the weak winter sun. She leaned back against the tree and closed her eyes.
“He has a point Sev,” Draco said, amused. “Now we have graduated we are busier than we were before. We don’t have time to slack off.”
The already quiet room hummed silence when Tobias, the Dark Lord and Draco entered the room. The look of betrayal in Tobias’ eyes made each person in the room – whether guilty or not – bow their heads in shame. Tobias looked over everyone in the room, face blank. In his hand was a vial of the same potion he’d made for Draco. Taking three drops of it, he handed the vial to his father with a nod of thanks. Severus turned pasty.
That was how R’thir and Ruen found the two of them when they arrived with dessert. They cleaned up silently and let the two of them sleep in the comfort of each other’s arms.
“Just a moment, Draco,” he muttered as he added finely powdered basilisk bone to the simmering potion one pinch at a time. Draco watched with interest as the potion slowly lightened from the muddy brown it was originally to a colour that reminded one of a certain sandy-haired werewolf. “Now, what is troubling you, Draco?”
“Then follow us, its dinner time,” Draco started, gently helping Tobias to his feet when he started blinking sleepily.
Both girls had burst into hysterical tears when they had been told, worried about how their family would react to the news, let alone their partners. Once it was proven that both girls had consented to the act that had resulted in their current state, Amelia had told them as nicely but as firmly as she could to stop the hysterics; if they didn’t want this to happen then they shouldn’t have done the activity until after they had signed their betrothal contracts, or better still, were bonded.
“Now, as your punishment from us due to you doing something illegal is that you are not allowed to go anywhere without either your mother or myself and there is no hope in hell and beyond that you will be going anywhere NEAR that red-head. And if you know what is good for you, you will distance yourself from him at school as well.”
Luna and Neville smirked as they saw Ron drifting between being awake and being asleep. With a nod from Luna, Neville smugly raised the spell that would protect his her Luna’s identify and he watched as Luna slowly faded into a mist formed body with two black holes where her eyes should be, knowing that he looked exactly the same.
“No,” the two of them answered without hesitation. “We removed all potions that were there due to our job. That one remained.”
Draco laughed and nodded. “Then add on the fact that he is also carrying the next Malfoy heir, so he got the added magical protection boost for that …”
Neville nodded once in acknowledgement before leading the way into the room holding the bonded couple.
“We had already done them,” George said with a shrug. “NEWTs as well. We did them at the Ministry over the winter holidays. It was a clause to our contract with the Ministry.”
Pansy shook her head. “Like I was saying, because he started with the morning sickness, we were late since none of us are willing to leave Tobias since his life – and that of his child – has been threatened more than once.”
Tom, Lucius and Tobias blinked in shock. Severus sighed. “The potion you take is vital for you to live. Due to the abuse you underwent at the hand of Dumbledore, Granger, Weasley and the Dursleys your body will never be able to process enough food for you to survive. The less you sleep while taking it, the less effective it works because it needs to fight for energy. Even if Tom hadn’t have told me you weren’t sleeping, I would have known.”
Draco opened the jar and dipped his fingers into it. “I think we should start you on it right away.” With that said, he gently started massaging it into Tobias’ skin.
“I’m glad I did too. I’m hoping that I’m not like this for long; I don’t like getting weepy, angry or motherly over every small thing. I also hate that it was Severus who coped it first. It wasn’t fair on him, nor on you. I’m sorry.”
“Is there a time limit on when the contract has to be fulfilled?” Padma asked unexpectedly. “What?” she asked at the looks her Father, Pavarti and Madam Bones were giving her, “I’m hoping to work as a barrister or solicitor when I leave Hogwarts and I think it is a more than reasonable question.”
Every person in the Slytherin Common room blushed. Severus shook his head. It was far too early for him to be dealing with this. Taking a deep breath, he calmed down and explained what was going to occur.
Luna happily prepared the next part of her plan, humming a bouncy tune that Neville was positive was supposed to be dark and depressing. Shrugging it off as Luna being Luna, he turned his attention to the passed out idiot before him.
Neville ate the sweet, hoping that the trigger word wasn’t said. Unfortunately for him, Tobias was good at guessing them.
Draco, Blaise, Theo and Pansy watched in amusement as Tobias and Vincent paced before the empty photo frame.
The sound of multiple feet running into the room woke Draco from a lovely dream. He was buried deeply inside his husband’s more than willing body. Tobias moved slightly, bringing Draco’s attention to the fact that he was buried in his partner’s body and he moved slightly, causing Tobias to moan softly in his sleep. He was about to move again when soft laughter reached his ears.
He then turned to the scowling female that stood beside her. “In answer to your accusation,” he began with a nasty smile, “Yes, our females DO give birth. Male pregnancies have not yet become a part of goblin biology.”
The Slytherins saw firsthand the treatment their friend and Lord was getting from Ron and Hermione when the Hogwarts Express reached Hogsmeade. They hadn’t let anyone speak to him, nor him to anyone and they herded him between them on the way to the carriages. Before they managed to force him into one of them, Tobias managed a quick look around and locked eyes with the small group of sixth year Slytherins. He smirked before grinning maliciously. The answered with smirks of their own.
“The fat lump leaned it against the wall and stood on it. Then he urinated on the pieces.” Harry started to shake. “I can’t control it, Thanis. I’ve tasted blood and I want more! I need more! I need to hunt – to kill. To feel hot blood flood my throat.” Harry’s eyes flared A.K green, scaring everyone and making Thanatos squawk and vanish.
“How you have a job is beyond me,” the older red-headed twin said. “I will say this once and once only … you DO NOT speak to either of us in the way you just did. Going by your lack of knowledge you are either a muggleborn, half-blood with no experience in the magical word or a pure-blood with sub-par intelligence, put mediocre study towards your devotion to your chosen field or a mix of the lot of them.”
“There is no room for either of them in the opposite room. Each room can hold a specific number of people and both rooms are full.”
“Anyway,” he mumbled, “just gather a group of like-minded girls and have fun. I will take care of the rest.”
Neville smiled shyly. “I understand. As twins you don’t feel completely whole without having some contact with the other.” He turned to the Minister and became even shyer. “Is there any way for them to be together, Sir? It can’t be too much trouble to arrange.”
“Thank you Your Grace,” Amelia said with a nod of her head. “You have been delegated a Healer and Ministry official by us,” she continued, now addressing the forty odd students that had gathered. “These groups are not negotiable and I expect each and every one of you to treat both of the adults with respect, no matter who they are.”
Draco followed his husband to the section of the Mother’s garden where they would be eating. He hummed in pleasure as he watched his husband’s hips sway to the natural rhythm of his walk.
Tobias whimpered, but let Draco go. Draco dropped a kiss to the top of Tobias’ head and walked out, doing his best to ignore the heart-wrenching sounds that were leaving his pregnant and lonely Lover.
“That is what he said, amongst other things,” Neville stated with a polite smile, trying not to laugh. He had found that he had quite the sadistic sense of humour since starting his sibling ship with Luna.
When the teacher dismissed the class, Draco fled. He had a raven-haired Adonis to snog the breath from.
Ginny nodded and knocked on the table. “Two chicken salad sandwiches on multigrain and two tomato juices with a small amount of salt and pepper.”
Severus nodded. “What has been wrong with you today? You’ve been abnormally quiet and, dare I say it, tame.”
Severus looked up at the other two men. Tom’s eyes were the colour of mud and you could see that he was fighting tear. Lucius, however, had tears streaming down his aristocratic features as his soon-to-be son-in-law spoke of his dreams for the first time. He turned his attention back to Tobias.
“Did you hear?” she asked softly yet excitedly. “The brand was revealed last night by McGonagall!” She giggled in her excitement. “So was the fact that Tobias took a death oath out on her.”
“Are you sure this is what you want?” Draco asked. “Think of what it means. You will never be able to marry or bond to anyone or anything else ever. You will be able to father children, if you so wish, but they will either stay with the mother or belong to The Pack. You will never be able to become the Lord you are meant to become.”
“Next is all my ‘housemates’ turning on me and every time I told the truth I was punished by that female and her blasted pen!” He unconsciously balled his right hand into a fist and rubbed the worded scar on the back of it.  “Then there was no Quidditch – coupled with a lifetime ban. Hagrid then introduced us to Grawp – his half-brother and asked us to look after him and be company for him in the event that he was forced to leave. Then there was that stupid woman again – this time with her squad.”  He looked pointedly at Draco, who blushed slightly.
Harry tied down to a hospital bed while she, the Headmaster, Ron and Madam Pomphrey welded the cuffs to his wrists, ankles and neck. Harry’s screams as he writhed in pain on the same bed as a potions scalpel coated in some smoking substance was used to cut runes deep into his flesh over and over again. The soft whimpering as he asked why over and over again and the slowly encroaching betrayal that had filled his eyes as she told him sternly that it was all for the best, and the dead look in his eyes as the Headmaster told him that he was now safe enough for his relatives to handle while the menagerie of animals he called family all had mad glints in their eyes as she and Ron told them his magic had been bound, making it safer for them to be around their nephew.
Severus sat frozen on the chair. Did he just call them mild? “Draco, what did you mean by mild? These dreams had him freaked enough to not go back to sleep after them!”
“You used a lot of energy yesterday,” Minerva said softly. “Normally a good night’s rest would be all you need to recover, but you also have a portion of your magic going to supporting your baby, so you don’t have as much magic in your core as you normally do.”
When the last Professor walked into the transfiguration room, Minerva put up her strongest privacy charm – one that included a safety net ensuring that no one who heard what was spoken could reveal it. She turned to find herself being glared at by the school’s Potions Professor.
“Pissed off at the amount of work Albus has left for him to clean up,” he answered, covering a yawn, “And tired.”
“Come on, Lucius,” a female voice now sounded. “I want to see my boys so if you don’t move, I’ll let Remus at you. You are – after all – keeping him from his Neogennito.”
This was how Tom, Lucius, Narcissa, Severus and Remus found them half an hour later after seeing off the guests. The five of them had known that they wouldn’t have consummated their bond that night, since the both of them had been deeply affected by the past fortnight.
Draco froze, his breath caught in his throat. This was surely a dream. Tobias could not be doing what he thought he was … Could he? Draco moaned as he felt his husband’s cheeks rubbing against his cock. Yes, he was! Draco remembered telling Tobias about receiving a lap dance – the only sexual contact he had had with the opposite sex other than the odd blow job – but he’d never imagined that his husband would give him one on their ‘wedding night’. He had to admit that getting a lap dance from his husband was a very big turn on for him – even if the dance itself was inexperienced compared to the one he had been given before.
“Don’t make me request for someone to help me experiment Ateros,” Luna said dreamily. “Ronald will not last longer than this year, after all.”
“I do Father. I mean every word of it. Zabini’s stand by their family and I have learnt more about family in the short time I have been in The Pack than I have from the Zabini family. A real family accepts a person for who they are, not for how well they can keep secrets or lie to people of authority. Family is there to support you, even if they know you were the one in the wrong. Family is more important than anything. You may want for me to conceal what occurred between Grandmother and Alpha, but Alpha is just that – My Alpha.”
“That is only a rough figure though,” Fred said with a shrug. “It depends on the time of year after all. That was the figure we approximated from our owl services from last year so …” he shrugged.
He covered a yawn and blinked sleepily. “Kitten has agreed to reveal all hidden areas for us to explore as well in exchange for having everything cleaned and fixed. She hates feeling dirty.”
“It doesn’t. The idea about nightmares is that you turn into your wolf at night time and sleep as it. It would help, so why don’t you try it for tonight?”
Tobias looked back with a smirk. “It’s only a tease if it isn’t delivered,” he whispered passionately into his husbands’ ear before planting a quick kiss to the tempting lips before him. He squeaked when Draco picked him up, deepened the kiss and carried him back to the raised dais covered thickly with dark green moss that he was laying on when Draco had first entered.
“If it is Miss Patil who breaks it, then the Patil family loses one of their Wizengamot seats to the Weasley family as well as three hundred and eight galleons. IF Mr Weasley breaks the contract then he and his brother are to hand over all their current earnings to the Patil family as well as handing their shop over, never to be in business again.”
“I apologise. Thank you Mr Malfoy-Black for silencing everyone so ... Efficiently. If they had waited a few moments longer than they would have understood why we are doing this.”
After helping Luna strap Ronald into a set of unforgiving bands, Neville shrank back into the shadows to watch – unseen – until the time he may be needed. Once comfortable, he glanced around the room with interest and was surprised to find his jaw hadn’t dropped from what he could see.
To add insult to injury, Tobias lent down quickly and kissed the terrified boy on the lips, hard enough to bruise them, and smirked. “Watch yourself, Weaselby – I’ll be waiting for you to fuck up.” He stood and walked past Lucius and Severus, straight to Draco and wrapped his arms around the taller, broader teen, before letting the fear and rage take over him in waves of shudders and shivers. Concerned, Draco wrapped his own arms around the slighter boy clinging to him.
She sniffed slightly. She could be ordered around by her bond-master’s house-elves and could do nothing about it. She was nothing more than a toy now – one that had less status than even a common muggle. She could only hope that her bond-master didn’t wish to make her a pleasure toy for his enjoyment. If he did, then she would be powerless against him.
“Not everyone has the same type of blood,” a new voce said into the room, “and I’m not talking Pure-blood, muggle-born or half-blood either.”
Tobias laughed joyfully as he ran from a mock-enraged Draco. He hadn’t thought that having his husband chase him naked would be something that would make him want his husband’s touch more then he already wanted it – but it did.
Tobias stared up at Draco with wide eyes and nodded slowly. He whimpered when Draco pulled out of him, but he quickly moved into the position that Draco had told him to get into.
Tobias chuckled before yawning. “It was my pleasure Dynamo. It is a wonderful feeling when you see the ones you love as happy as you are with your partner with their own.”
Tobias blinked, trying to clear the shadows from his eyes and gasped at the scene before him. The room they were in was built into the cliff face that surrounded the Mother’s Garden. The front of the room opened out into the outer garden where the bed they were to share was protected from the elements by a glass awning with retractable sides.
With a final nod, Lord Patil exited the room and Tobias turned to the two new comers. “Where do you want me?”
“Leave him there,” Tobias ordered. Spinning around to face Severus, he asked, “Will it be like this every time I come into contact with any of them three, or just all three of them at the same time?”
The Pack laughed and spent the remaining time to the evening meal relaxing and talking about children’s names.
It was the last day of term and the Headmaster was looking at the stay list in astonishment. For the first time in the history of Hogwarts, there were no students staying for the break. He sighed. This meant that none of the Professors had to stay. His eyes twinkled as a thought came to him. He could use this time to make an attack on that Tobias kid. He grinned. This will be like taking candy from a baby. Speaking of candy – he reached for a new packet of sherbet lemons.
With that, both Daemon left, leaving two quiet boys. Silently they set up their belongings the way they desired them then they collapsed – gracefully – onto the armchairs before the fire grate.
‘Kyria was right,’ Remus thought as he picked the man up frowning slightly at how light the other man was, ‘He needed the security of the bite. I am such a fool. It is time and past that I pull my head out of my arse and become the Alpha my mate needs me to be. I hope I will be even a fifth of the Alpha Neogennito is to his Pack, to Severus.’
“Last but not least, our light mage, Epikindynos – Dangerous,” Ginny stepped forward, “and our torture expert Kyria – Lady.” Ginny and Luna removed their cowls, smirking at the crowd.
While Neville was inspecting the room, Luna was preparing her desired instruments of torture. With a whispered spell she vanished from sight as her special brand of magic surrounded her. With another whispered spell, her victim was silenced and stung spread eagle at waist height by ropes attached to the bands. With another whispered word, the red-head woke and whimpered slightly due to the pain in his wrists and ankles.
Severus easily removed himself from Remus’ shock-numbed arms. “Just so you know Remus …. I wouldn’t have told your secret to anyone if only to hear you tell me that you still loved me.”
Luna let out a wet giggle as the bonds that tied her to the other members of The Pack pulsed with all the pride, acceptance and, most comforting of all, love that they held for her.
The class was going smoothly until someone’s cauldron started to give out black smoke. Without thinking, Tobias ran at Draco and called out, “Kitten!” Tobias and Draco disappeared just as the potion exploded all over Lavender. Both boys reappeared at the front of the room, next to their Godfather, who was trying his hardest not to laugh at the girl.
Tobias sighed. “It started when I first learnt what the Dursleys were doing to me was classified as abuse. By this time I believed that I was to blame for what was occurring, as I’d been under their control for five years previously.” He smiled sadly. “They started the day I turned three. It was the first time I’d performed magic. I had managed to avoid being hit by a car – It hit the tree beside me instead. The man behind the wheel apologised, even though it wasn’t his fault. Some stupid kid had put something on the road that destroyed the car’s tires. I had managed to apparate myself to one side – just enough for him to believe that he had been able to prevent him from hitting me himself by swerving. The Dursleys were watching and my aunt and uncle knew what that meant. After that every opportunity to beat me that came up, they took. I always feared the day Vernon would take it to beyond the beatings and starving, but it never happened – Not until this summer.”
Tobias smiled softly as he remembered the happenings of an hour before while snuggling into his husband’s side. Theodore cleared his throat softly.
Draco used his magic to slam open the doors to the Great Hall, fury in every line of his body. Everyone in the room went silent and watched the blonde wearily as he glided menacingly towards the Head Table.
“My dear, dear boy! I am surprised at you! I am the Sorting Hat of Gryffindor. None can hide anything from me!”
Tobias smiled before taking the potion that appeared beside him and started eating the fruit salad before him. “I’ve got the library to continue, recipes to think up for Anadochos and, if Nonos has them, tests to mark. Why Pateras? Did you have anything you’d like for me to do?”
Meanwhile, in the Slytherin common room, one of the more stupid seventh year students was on a rampage.
I know I promised weekly updates, but that was before my computer decided to die. It is now fixed and here is the next chapter!
“Now that is over,” Amelia stated, discretely patting the Malfoy Lord on the shoulder as she passed him on her way to get another cu of tea, “shall we do as suggested?”
Watching in amusement as Tobias disappeared into the hole, Draco smiled. He was finally going to see the infamous Chamber! After a few minutes Draco lowered himself to the entrance and followed his betrothed, laughing at the feeling of freedom the journey gave him. He laughed in surprise when a pair of strong arms caught him.
“No matter how much you scream, no one will hear you,” Luna’s mystifying voice came from around the room. Neville struggled to hold hi his laughter as he stopped pulling on the ropes, satisfied that they would hold.
While everyone watched in shock, the other wolves transformed into their human forms. “That goes for all of us,” The Pack chorused, the growls making everyone shiver.
Tobias smiled. “No, R’thir, you didn’t insult us. We very much enjoy it. May we have another glass each?” The youngster beamed and nodded, rushing to refill their glasses before leaving the pitcher between them. Ruen watched him collect the used cutlery before placing the new plates before them. Removing the covers from the plates, he bowed in the form of humans and left.
Draco nodded and left to gather the rest of their family. It looked as though Severus wasn’t quite ready to let Tobias out of his sight just yet.
Once Draco had removed his hands from his partner’s intimate areas, he pulled himself away from the tempting flesh of the already abused throat that he loved. Moving away from his pleading husband, he released him from the willow and kissed and licked the slightly chaffed skin with intensity that surprised Tobias. Giving both wrists one last kiss, he moved until he was between Tobias’ legs. Lying on top of him, he looked into his eyes lovingly and kissed the tip of his nose.
The reaction of those in the Hall was immense. People groaned, shouted out in anger, fear or annoyance, some paled until they could almost blend in with the ghosts while others still just accepted it with a shrug of the shoulders.
She sighed, eye focused on the distant past. “He said that it was more of a hindrance than a help – that the students with higher marks should be allowed to shine rather than forced to aid those too lazy to do the work themselves. Dippit agreed – after all, Dumbledore was one of those very students, so he should know.
Dedicated to: Ash. Here is your promised one shot Hun. Hope you enjoy it and here’s wishing you a very early Happy Birthday.
“Okay everyone. You know the drill. Everyone not Pack to your room. On the upside however, this may be our last meeting here. Now shoo!” Tobias made a shooing gesture at the room in general. Once the room had emptied, Tobias because serious. “Nonos. Do you have any news from Pateras, Anadochos, Lykos or Nona?”
Severus nodded, deep in thought. “He could just be having a reaction to the difference in the magic between here and the Garden. How about this? You both only have potions this afternoon, right? Well, I’ll let you off this lesson so the two of you can sleep. I suggest using your new rooms, I’m sure that Kitten will alert me if something goes wrong.”
To everyone’s surprise it was Draco who knelt before him and took his face in his hands to make him look him in the eye. “Bi, I know you don’t want to go. Remember all the things we spoke about earlier today?” Tobias nodded causing Draco to smile, shocking everyone even more. “Then you will remember the promise I made you.” Once more he was answered with a nod.
Ron sobbed  in terror as a pair of intense eyes appeared out of the mist and most of the hands disappeared, only to quickly reappear to snatch small pieces of the precious materials before vanishing once again. The bridge was still slowly inching towards the bottom of the ravine.
Ginny laughed at the shocked faces of her four family members she was proud of. All four of them looked as if they’d walked through a long line of ghosts.
“Milord?” Madam Greengrass appeared before the Dark Lord, completely missing the look of vindictive pride in her grandson’s eyes.
“Both,” George replied. “The person who hit us with the loyalty spell only bit one of us and considering t was the one that was broken completely, the other’s magic would have reacted viciously towards it, hence it breaking.”
“If you move them from there, Bi, I will tie them up with the willow’s branches so you can’t move – and if that’s what you want, then by all mean, touch me,” he whispered seductively.
One shaking hand reached for the innocent-looking roll of parchment. When his godfather had stopped shaking and was reading with his jaw lowered slightly, Tobias swallowed, hoping against all hope that he had done the right thing.
Tobias nodded, running his hands slowly from the top of Draco’s head and over his neck, back and shoulders. “I’m ready to be yours, Draco,” he whispered.
Tom breathed out explosively when The Pack appeared in a flash of flame. “Thank you for coming so quickly. We have a problem.”
Severus sat as the scratching of quills on parchment filled his room. Gods he loved his life at the moment … or he had until a certain black-haired green-silver eyed teen somehow started to purr as Draco’s right hand stroked soothing circles on his left.
The following morning when Tobias and Draco entered the Great Hall for breakfast, they laughed when they saw nine eager pack-mates, a bright-eyed potions professor and a slightly amused Remus – who was apparently there to give Dumbledore a report. Laughing, the two boys sat at the table to eat.
Severus nodded. “I will tell my colleagues that both boys are experiencing a magical drain and Tobias has been hit harder than Draco, so he is resting under the eye of his family healer. Draco is well enough to attend lessons with theory, but not practicals and he also is staying under the eye of his husband’s healer. When we have our big meeting, I’ll tell them when I know that the Buzzard can’t over hear us.
A house-elf popped into existence before them. “Dinners is ready Sirs!” it squeaked before popping back out.
The tension that had formed in the younger man relaxed significantly as he registered the older woman’s words and he rubbed his eyes tiredly.
“I’m going to spoil you Tobias,” Draco whispered to the dark-haired youth. “I know you have something planned for our pack tomorrow, but at the first available moment I’m going to steel you away for a treat, just for you. I know you are courting me, but I want to do something special for you. One night alone isn’t enough, Bi. I need more time with you. Please allow me to have it.”
“Soup filling and tasty and nutritious. All good for growing baby and mother.” The other female said.
Abstract: madam Pomphrey keeps the boys overnight after they are injured in a fight and becomes the only person who really knows what happens when the lights go out.
“Personally, I like the sight of blood.” He paused to remove his potions knife from a pocket and inspected it. Slowly he dragged the blade across the flesh on his forearm. The seventh year student was now up against the wall, whimpering now that he’d realised his mistake, and watching the blade almost hypnotically. Draco had to admit that the way Tobias handled the knife was half erotic and half hypnotic – a dangerous combination.
Draco felt his mouth go dry as Tobias rose slowly from where he lay. He watched, mesmerised, as the green-eyed man walked slowly towards him, giving tantalizing glimpses of the taunt, almost golden, flesh that was hidden by the white robes.
“Let’s see,” she murmured under her breath, tapping the quill on her lips. “There was the NEWTs … covered that, and the Pack reunion … covered that as well. I’ve also covered the meeting I had with Alpha afterwards and my letter and gift to my chosen mate. He won’t receive it until this morning’s post so I won’t know his answer for another day or two …”
“I am also glad we finished today and I apologise for my hard-headedness concerning the need for Padma to keep things from us. I understand you were only protecting your family.”
“And how does the wizarding world’s hero-turned-minister plan on spending his holiday?” one reporter asked.
Tobias nodded in thought. Severus was still shocked that the others in The Pack didn’t attack while the boy was weak. It was then that he started to understand Remus’ protectiveness of their Neogennito – Wait a second … Their Neogennito?
“It does Alpha,” Vincent said with a small smile, “and if you don’t mind, I would rather Kyria be the first to see it.”
Tobias sneered at the set of four portraits and stamped his way to where he could see Remus’ laughing form walking through. Draco glared at Theo and the two portraits before following his husband.
Draco grinned and thrust forwards gently. “We only have 30 minutes, but I’m going to make it the best 30 minutes ever.”
Tobias and his fellow students arrive at Hogwarts where a surprise has been set up for those who were not in the know and one Slytherin seventh year discovers, first hand, why it isn't a good idea to piss off people who are higher on the food chain than he is.
Severus snorted inelegantly. “Small he says, as if we didn’t need to take some of his blood and push it into his daughters system.”
A soft whine from the bed made the four adults freeze before another whine made Severus run to his two cubs without a word to his visitors.
Hearing a gurgle behind him, Severus turned sharply and watched as Harry threw up once again, but seeing spots of bright red mixed with the contents of his stomach, he yelled, “Lucius! Get in here now! We need to remove them!”
Albus frowned. “Your son is fine. I’ve had no reports saying that he had been to the Hospital Wing …”
Draco broke the kiss, reaching for the robes that were hiding his husband’s flesh, only to have Tobias catch his hand.
“We already have enough evidence on how bad a teacher Severus Snape is, so I’ll skip those questions and go onto …”
As he finished reading the article, Tobias’ eyes were lit with suppressed glee. Operation Twinkle-Toes was being set up. Keeping his face as neutral as he could, he pushed his spare copy of the paper in front of Draco then turned the page of his paper, enjoying the sudden silence that had overcome the Great Hall for the third time in as many days.
Before anyone could react, Harry had stood and faced his professor. “That is no longer my name, Sir. I would appreciate it if you would desist in using it.” Harry blinked. “Pateras? What IS my name now?”
“Amelia,” Lucius greeted as he joined her as she made her way back to the Great Hall after the small break they were on between years finished.
Pansy’s scream bought the rest of the Slytherin’s from the hallway and into the Snake Pit. Everyone froze as they caught sight of the bronze animal with blood coloured eyes. Draco rested a hand on its neck before it could open its mouth. After whispering to it for a moment, the Wyvern disappeared to be replaced with a blank-faced Tobias. Pansy started to breathe again.
As in the last chapter, I would appreciate it if the Greek translations are incorrect that I am told since I am dependent on internet translation sites and they do have a habit of being wrong at times :3
Ginny smiled. “I’m positive they would be thrilled that you thought of them in your time of need,” she giggled softly.
“If you follow us, we’ll show you why you will more than like our produce,” the other said with an identical maniacal grin.
The next morning found The Pack in the Chamber bright and early. The sitting room now held a large table groaning under the weight of the food on top of it. There was steaming cinnamon twists, apple and minced fruit bread, a large bowl of Devilled kidneys with hot buttered toast around the edge, bacon, eggs, grilled tomato, sausage, yoghurt, muesli and an extra-large fruit and cheese platter.
The were-wolf disappeared and was replaced by a newly transformed Harry Potter. Half the hall felt their jaws drop as they took in the boy’s new appearance. There was no two ways about it – The boy was damned well smoking hot! Half the Hufflepuffs swooned, but Tobias had eyes only for the boy he had pinned to the floor. Ron gulped in fear as he met the cold, hard malachite eyes above him.
Smirking at each other, the twins rolled both scrolls and handed the original to the school owl and theirs to one of their own owls. “Take this straight to the Burrow. Do not allow anyone to see it,” George said to the owl. “We’re counting on you, Labrys.”
It turned out that on odd occasions, a Dragon handler would, for some reason, gain the interest of a specific dragon and sometimes the dragon would choose to bond with said handler. No one knew how or why it happened, but it was considered to be the highest of honours to be the chosen bonded of a dragon in  Dragon-Handler law. Needless to say, Charlie did not contribute to the enlargement of The Pack, but in his own admission, he was happier being the bonded companion of the Peruvian Vipertooth that chose him than he would have been had he bonded with a human.
“I have no idea,” Neville replied, only just managing to keep his laughter hidden from everyone else.
Tobias looked at the outfit hanging up in front of him, his hands shaking. He wasn’t scared of what was going to happen the next day – He was terrified. It was actually happening. The outfit before him was identical to his pack uniform, but for colour. His was white with copper and bronze runes and Celtic knots. Draco’s – he knew- was mid grey with gold and silver runes and Celtic knots.
Remus fought the flinch at the tear-filled, heart-broken statement. Slowly he pulled a chain out from underneath his robe, revealing the position of the missing ring. “I had to remove it,” he whispered, lowering his eyes, unable to look his mate in the eye as he made his confession. “I don’t deserve to wear it,” he clarified, fighting tears of his own as he smelt salt coming from the slighter man. “You have shown me – proven to me - that you are worthy of my heart and soul, but I haven’t done anything to prove that I am worthy of yours. I cannot, in good conscience, wear a symbol of the depth of your devotion to me if I have done nothing to earn or prove that I am just as, if not more so, devoted to you.”
“Like Alpha and Beta’s parchments, your two have been combined. Your list is several items long. First, WWW. Make sure that everything is going well. If you need help with new ideas or to test products, don’t hesitate to ask us. Next is your family. If any of them slip up and mentions something of interest let us know immediately. The other two things on your list are Umbridge and Pomphrey. Think you can handle it?”
Watching the Slytherin table from his position at the Head Table, Severus almost beamed with pride. He knew how hard it hit the Slytherins to have every house against them. He was intrigued at the way Tobias had been able to make the first through third year students accepted by both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. He’d have to remember to ask the boy about that at the meeting next weekend.
Both men chuckled and moved the younger to his family, which now included his Father and godparents.
The woman disappeared, followed closely by the two daemons. Hermione sighed in relief before looking up right before a large white wolf slammed into her. The last thing she heard was her own terrified screams.
“We only have Potions after this, Sir,” Draco told the man before him respectfully. “Professor Snape has assured me that he has something Tobias can do that won’t harm anyone. He’s even given him permission to use his personal lab.”
Tobias stretched and winced at the slight muscle twinge in his lower back. He had completed his History of Magic exam, both his transfiguration exams and his DADA theory exam since the examiners wanted to see if there was a way to safely test his practical knowledge while pregnant before allowing him to do the practical exam. He looked at the time. It was only 1 pm and time for lunch or get another lecture about missing meals. Once he stood the members of The Pack that were present also stood and started for the front of the room.
“How very Slytherin of you Mr Black,” Narcissa’s eyes twinkled, reminding everyone forcefully of the Headmaster. “Are you going to be taking such games into the bedroom?”
“I will be honoured to prepare the room for tonight Sister dear. Do you have any special requirements?”
Tobias smiled and reached for it. “Thank you. Do you think I can have something to nibble on? I’m feeling a little hungry.”
Draco looked at the box closer and found a slight depression and grinned. “I will tell you how it works out my Dear,” he almost purred. He pat her softly on the head and walked out of the room to meet up with his father.
Narcissa laughed and kissed her husband hungrily, forcing his mind to other – more enjoyable – things. After all, if a mystery is solved, it is no longer a mystery, and Narcissa felt that the mystery that was her soon to be son-in-law shouldn’t be unravelled by any bar her son. She also knew that Draco wouldn’t let on that secret, even if he were asked directly while under Veritaserum.
“Don’t yell at her,” the boy growled, “she was only checking to see if you were alright, you ungrateful louse!” He turned to the girl and softly asked, “Are you alright sister mine?”
Ignoring the gasping body in front of him, Harry started thrusting his fingers in and out of the still tight hole while licking and sucking on and around the area.
“I’m with you there Brother,” Fred replied with a scowl at the papers before them, “but we need them to ignore us so we can get information from them. Tobias said he is working on this newest problem for us.”
“Go to Lykos, Nonos. Give him your gift. Spend some time with him you both deserve it. Don’t bother going to Pateras. He doesn’t even know that your mark burnt. I’ll put the Slytherin papers in the appropriate place, okay Sir?”
He glared at Lucius. “I know you gave it to her, because Dobby told me,” he smirked, “but he also tried killing me several time over the course of that year, so he kind of evened it out.” He shrugged again before glancing around the room before whispering, “Do I have to go tomorrow?”
Once he had started, Harry could bring himself to stop and he licked a line from mid back up towards his Pet’s slowly leaking hole, gathering all the released liquid on his tongue. When he got to where he truly wished to be, he pulled back inspecting the quivering hole. With a smirk, he conjured a set of ropes with leather loops on the end. With a deftness that would have surprised all those who had known him in his school years, Harry relocated Draco’s feet into them. Giving each ankle a nibble, he also relocated Draco’s hands so they grabbed his ankles.
“Very happy indeed,” the other said with an identical grin. “And the reason we are back again makes this wondrous event so much sweeter!”
Tobias snorted. “You are talking to the boy who – when other boys were having naughty dreams about girls – was having trouble not creaming his jeans from his memories of you torturing his human family. Hell the only reason why I didn’t have that reaction to the things I could see coming from Pateras was because it fucking hurt me … and they didn’t involve Dumbledore, or the Dursleys spread on the wall with their heads on spikes.”
Harry awoke the next morning to the tapping of an owl at his window.  Stretching as he went to open it, he was surprised to see several owls waiting for him.  After he removed the letters, all the owls flew off. He looked at his watch and walked down to the kitchen for a glass of pumpkin juice and a bowl of something that looked expensive.
Tobias’ voice answered. “By the time Drakontas and I die, Pateras, Zog and Booph will have out-lived the time for them to serve the Mother and Father. When we die, we will be taking over from them.”
“Maybe you should have told him about us before the meeting, Alpha,” an eerie trance-like voice said.
“H-He uses it on him. And I have to watch. Draco never utters a word. All he does in look at me. Sometimes he mouths “I love you’ to me, but most of the time he just keeps looking at me. Vernon never touches him like he did me though. He went to once, but I threatened him with instant death if he did before I woke up. Normally though, he’d just hit him a few times with the whip before saying he’s got plans for a pretty think like him. Most of the time V-Vernon sells him to men and women to use as they will. I try to get to him to stop them, but every time I move the bands holding me to the chains get tighter and tighter while they chains get shorter and shorter until all I can do is listen to Draco’s screams as he’s entered dry and told what a good slut he is.”
“I understand Minerva,” Amelia soothed. “That is one of the reasons you are a good teacher – you care for the students. I’ll come to your room with you after this evening’s meal so you can give me those memories. Can you send Severus Snape in for me?”
“How about we talk to The Pack after the bonding at what they want to do? I have a feeling that they may have plans that we haven’t been told about.”
Albus Dumbledore let his fake twinkling eyes take in the population of Hogwarts. Smiling, he welcomed them back, while internally he raged. The one spy he fully trusted within the Dark Lords ranks had been returned to him earlier that morning. The man had every joint in his body snapped and it looked as if a vicious animal had attacked him. A mark – the death mark with flaming wings coming from the sides – was burnt into his chest. Below the mark was a message for him stating, “Thanks for the toy.”
“No,” Amelia said firmly. The seven of us will be coming to view the memory after the meal is over. We need to know what kind of stuff we are dealing with.” She looked around the Hall and frowned thoughtfully. “Where are Misters Malfoy-Black and their friends? It isn’t a good idea for any of them to skip a meal.”
Draco nodded. Tobias closed his eyes and called up his white fire. Narcissa gasped at the beauty of the scene before her. A moonlit garden with flowers so white they looked to be made of fine china. A delicate and sweet scent filled the air and Draco locked eyes with his fiancé, both of them remembered the kiss from earlier.
Two hours later, Voldemort knocked on his son’s bedroom door. Not getting an answer, he opened the door to see Tobias seated cross-legged on the ground in front of a makeshift altar. He sat on the desk chair present to watch as his son was meditating. Just as he was thinking of interrupting him, Tobias burst into flame and slowly opened his eyes.
Silently the two of them followed the two Daemons, careful to not touch the other in case the temptation to mate became too strong for them to fight. Booph and Zog exchanged looks. They could taste the desire the two behind them held for the other, and they could do naught but hope they could contain it until the right time.
Algie sniggered at the incredulous looks the people around him were aiming at the smirking blonde and the bright red man hiding his face in his husband’s chest. “Then I’d say craving number 2 is well underway. Don’t be surprised if he also becomes a tease.”
At the base of the cock shaft, the steel strip separated into three to wrap the testicles snuggly with the centre strap separating the two globes. The three strips of metal combined together once again just behind the testicles, where a hook and eye set-up was to be found connecting the front piece to the back piece of the design.
Lucius carefully removed his granddaughter from Tobias and silently left the room, allowing the Father and son to their bonding.
“You mean to tell us,” Ginny hissed, eyes narrowed, “that you didn’t go over the information on your patient and you ignored the bonding tattoo on his back.”
“I warned you, Tobias Regulas Riddle. I warned you that if you touched me before I said you could, you would be tied up til I let you go. Now,” Draco purred, appearing back on top of his husband, “Where were we? Oh yes, I remember.” And with a self-satisfied smirk, he lowered his head and nibbled on an exposed collarbone before leaving a claiming mark and left small nips and biting kisses to the other side.
