"I shall not bother you for details, either." Narcissa closed her eyes and leaned back into the chair as Millie popped into the kitchen.
"I am fine." Harry could feel Narcissa's gaze crawling over him, but he ignored her and knelt down before the elf. "I've missed you, too. How is Scorpius?"
One man stood out in the midst of the garish wrappings, and Harry grinned at George in his holiday suit. The black trousers and jacket had bright green Christmas trees all over the fabric, and they spun independently as George moved across the floor towards him.
She stepped forward and held her hands out. Harry placed the mug on her palms and drew his wand, tracing the tip along the bottom of the mug and Hermione's hand.
Ron nudged her and she turned, watching as the minister entered, followed by a small cadre of Goblins. Harry entered next and the room fell silent. His robes were black and grey that was ombre together like a shadow. Bright trim of green and red swirled around his wrists as he lifted his wand. Applause broke out as the tip of his wand glowed.
"Exactly what I am expecting from dad. I'll deal with both males later, though. I'm ready for my pottery lesson, Uncle Harry."
Ron nodded and held out his hand to Hermione. With a deep breath, she pushed to her feet and slid into his arms. He guided her out to the parlour to the fireplace.
"Your mother will not change Andromeda's mind, and I have half a mind to side with her on that decision."
Malfoy's head turned and Harry met his gaze. He returned the smirk that he was given and took a deep breath as he gathered his courage. He pushed into the shop.
Harry groaned and let go, his hand flying over his skin until he was spent.
A blue light pulsed and two balls shot from the end of Arthur's wand. Each sphere impacted, individually and respectively to Bill's and Ron's wand. "Go forth and do the House and Family proud.
"Harry," Hermione began. "I'm really sorry."
Harry couldn't take his eyes off of him. He'd had suits made for him before. The Muggle tuxedo that Ginny insisted on for the wedding still hung in his closet, but it wasn't anything he'd wear again. There was just something about a well-fitted set of clothing on a man that just screamed sex and masculinity.
Harry smiled at the ancient elf and wondered just how much longer the old bean would hang on. "How have you been, Kreacher?"
Harry nodded. "I had to. Receiving the owl, seeing Andi, and watching her struggle with the doubt of whether or not she had made the correct decision for Teddy, broke something in me. The letter was painfully clear that she wouldn't change her mind about you and Teddy."
"Oh, cruel witch, how I adore thee," Lucius murmured and bent to kiss her again. Narcissa melted into his arms, submitting to his attentions before gently pulling back. Lucius folded her tightly to him then released her.
"Let's start with a shawl cut, double-breasted jacket, fitted, of course as Mr Potter is quite lean. Moulded trousers with a mid-break, House style, if you please, Marcus."
Draco sighed and leaned against the shop while Potter unlocked the door. He waited to answer until Potter led him to the small showroom where he'd sat with his mother earlier.
"Good morning, Father," Draco chirped as he pulled out a chair and began to eat, suddenly famished. He prepared his tea and waved his wand at one of the ugly sweater cookies, offering the brightly coloured treat to Lucius with a grin. "Cookie?"
He wrapped his arms about her and she smiled, leaning into his strong chest before turning.
Tom sighed and placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. "I heard about Andromeda. Damn shame it is if I do say so myself."
Malfoy held it out and Harry took it from him. The stars brightened as he held it in his hand and Leo appeared. He eyed the stein and it changed to show all the constellations visible during winter. Malfoy gasped then stepped closer to Harry. "Is it the constellation or the design?"
Draco cut his eyes to Potter and watched him as they walked through Hogsmeade on the way to his shop. Potter's face was scruffy, his dark five o'clock shadow made him seem older than he looked. It fit, though, with the wild bird's nest of hair and his lean rugged look. His smile lit up those green eyes, and though Draco had seen the emotions of anger and pride in them earlier, there was something about happiness that made them even brighter.
"Are you even listening, Harry?"
Ron pulled her to him and nodded, kissing her temple and running a hand over her belly. "You've no choice. My heir has yet to be born, but all the heirs will be there, and we know ours is a boy. Nott and Greengrass ensured it with the old magics."
Harry's stomping on the ice eased and Draco moved back even as he kept a hold on Harry.
"How am I to do that?" Lucius demanded. "I reconstructed his life once already. I made him a match and he destroyed both his reputation and the marriage."
Hermione shook her head as Ron backed out of the flames and then looked at her daughter. "You are too young, my darling girl."
Stepping up beside Draco, Harry reached down and took his hand, "You know why I stayed away."
The inspiration for the mug is at the end of the chapter.
Ron leaned into the fire. "Don't give your mum cheek, Rosie."
"To what end can a magicless wizard hope to rear the remaining heir of the Blacks?" Narcissa murmured.
Potter took the bag from the woman and she ladled up a mug of mulled mead and floated that over to him as well.
"I've got you."
"No. Thank you."
"Oh, aye, anything for you, lad. Come this way."
Hermione drew in a breath as the Wiltshire postcode darkened for a moment then the location jumped to Hogsmeade. "How did it get out there?"
With a snap of his fingers, all the lights in the room dimmed, and only the light of the moon shining in through the window, and the fire illuminated their way.
Harry stomped upstairs to the little flat he kept above the shop, to shower and get ready for dinner, but not before also sending out a message to his two students. Drawing his wand, Harry cast his Patronus.
Lucius and Narcissa had been highly impressed and Astoria took on the mantle of restoring the manor, too, and now she tended to the merriness of the season, with a joy that rivalled the feelings Draco had.
Narcissa smiled, her lips curved slightly and shook her head. "Denial, too, is a war that must be fought with trust and belief."
Harry felt eyes on his back and ignored the sensation. It was normal to feel this way every time he attended one of the Ministry's functions. Still, this interest felt familiar, knowing, and like coming home.
Behind them, drawing Harry from his thoughts, a cauldron exploded, making Harry jump and eliciting a few screams from his classmates. Beside him, Malfoy flinched so violently that it was as though he had been struck. The entire rest of the class Malfoy was shaking so badly that he accidentally put too many Abraxan hairs in one potion and didn’t evenly spread the aconite fluid in the other. Harry pretended not to have noticed. He spent the remainder of his time fussing over his potions despite the fact that he knew there was no hope of saving them. He was wretched at this class, utterly useless without Snape’s book to guide him.
He was deranged, unhinged, out of his mind. Harry flinched back from Malfoy, but he didn’t see any of the pleasure he expected Malfoy to get from knowing Harry was afraid. In fact, Harry could not decipher Malfoy’s expression in the slightest.
He was torn from his thoughts by Malfoy’s condescending voice and sneering face. “Graduated from stunning spells have you Potter? Finally grown a pair?” He flicked his wand and chords of rope shot from it, entwining themselves around Harry, entrapping him. He struggled against them, but with another flick he was left immobile. Malfoy stalked over, a devilish grin curving his lips. “Should I put the Weasley bitch out of her misery? Or perhaps I should let Aunty Bella play with her. I’m sure she would love to tear her apart.”
“Fine.” Malfoy replied. “You make these two.” He pointed down at two potion names he had scribbled on a scrap bit of parchment, “And I’ll do these ones.” He pointed at the remaining two.
“Into your own head.”
Draco’s head was a mess of thoughts rushing him and leaving him breathless. He was absolutely terrified to return to Hogwarts after all that had happened. His trial had put him on probation with the condition that he returned for a proper final year of schooling. But if it had been up to Draco then he would have chosen Azkaban over facing the classmates he’d betrayed. Always the coward. His mind hissed and he didn’t bother to quiet it, not when he knew that little voice was right. He’d told his mother as much, and yet here he was. He knew there was nothing she could do about it, she was just as much a war criminal as he was, but it didn’t stop the bitterness that still flooded his body.
“Fine.” Harry spat.
Draco froze.
Draco was on edge throughout the entire class, both from Potter’s eyes driving through the back of his skull and from the pointed glances Devereux kept sending his way. It was unsettling, and it made Draco want to crawl out of his own skin. He itched to move, to run from the room or jump out of the window if need be- anything to get out of there. The moment the bell rang, he leapt from his seat, shoving his things hastily into his bag as he sped for the corridor. His hand had just brushed the doorknob when Devereux’s booming voice pierced his ears. “Not so fast, Malfoy, I need a word.”
Harry was so surprised by the question that his steps faltered and he nearly fell. He only just managed to catch himself against the wall of the corridor. It made his answering shake of the head far less convincing. “Really, I haven’t. My scar hasn’t hurt at all since… since I killed him. It isn’t that. It’s just- it’s weird being back here, after everything that happened. And everything is whole and if you didn’t know a war was fought here, you’d never be able to tell at all. And it’s just… harder than I thought it would be.” Harry finished lamely. He loathed the sympathy in their eyes. They didn’t get it, not really, not in the ways that mattered. But he plastered a smile on his face and pushed off of the wall, striding down the corridor for the kitchens.
“No, sorry, it’s just a habit.”
“To the bathroom.” Harry said evasively. He would not admit to them that he had been following Draco… again.
Several minutes passed by and the room had filled with a quiet chatter as other pairs began to get to work on their selected potion and still Harry had found nothing of any real use. He glanced back at Ron and Hermione and they offered him a sympathetic look before returning to their own potions.
“Did you have fun running around your little maze?” Malfoy crooned, his eyes alight with some masochistic glee.
“Would it hurt him?”
He sped off to Transfiguration, but despite his haste, he was still late. Their new teacher glared at him as he entered the room. He had a haughty expression on his too-perfect face, his high cheekbones, pronounced jawline and bright eyes gave him an ethereal appearance. The sneer he adopted when he took in Draco’s disheveled appearance lessened the effect slightly. “Ah,” He said, looking down his nose at Draco, “A Malfoy, are you?” He practically spat the words and then lowered, so only Draco could hear, “Disgraces, the whole lot of you.”
Harry inhaled, long and slow. “Expecto Patronum.” He muttered under his breath, moving a finger in the wand pattern. As far as he could tell, Malfoy had placed no wards around the room or the chains- his mistake. But Harry had never been any good at wandless magic, and his uselessness remained consistent with past attempts.
He continued into the room, glancing around, unsure of where to sit. The new professor looked up from where she was seated at her desk and said, “What’s your name?”
“Yes.”
He rounded on her but didn't make a move to draw nearer. He knew better than to try and intimidate her. He’d end up with a black eye and broken nose at the very least. “Yes.” He hissed back, dredging up that pretentious attitude he’d always referred to during his encounters with the golden trio in past years. Only now it felt like an act, a mask, a shield to hide behind. Ever the coward. “Why, did you really think I’d want to be around you lot? Especially a filthy mudblood?” His gut roiled at the word, at the way he expected her to react to it.
Harry’s eyes widened and he tried to force the liquid back up, but Malfoy was faster, clapping a hand over his mouth and plugging his nose, forcing him to swallow the remainder. Once Malfoy had released him, he coughed and spluttered before croaking out, “What did you give me?”
“Really? You were late to our first class with a new professor because you were going to the bathroom?” Ron asked skeptically.
The response to seeing Draco and his mother had not been kind in the train station, so he knew it wouldn’t be kind at Hogwarts, not when the carnage and loss had been so great.
Malfoy’s expression twisted into something cruel and calculating. “Ah, I see, love her, do you?”
Absentmindedly, Harry touched his scar, still not used to the fact that it no longer pained him.
“I’m done answering your questions.” Harry snapped. The words were a great effort, but he forced them out anyways. Malfoy whipped around to face him, anger lighting in those pale gray eyes.
Harry sprinted through the trees, weaving this way and that, trying his hardest to avoid the spells that wizzed after him, Ron, Ginny and Hermione. Only one death eater was pursuing them, but whoever it was, was more skilled than the average death eater. They’d managed to disarm Hermione and Ron, put a gash on Ginny’s forehead that caused the flowing blood to hinder her vision far too much to duel. Harry still had a wand, but it wasn’t his own, rendering it nearly useless. This death eater was fast too, and Harry was getting tired.
“No, you are not!” Malfoy fired, striding across the room to where Harry was chained.
Draco sat in the very corner of the Great Hall. Despite Blaise and Pansy’s urging, he had no desire to try and make conversation with the war heroes. Pansy and Blaise lingered with him through McGonagall’s speech and the beginning of the feast, but as soon as they’d made sure Draco had eaten something, they drifted off to speak with the others. Draco couldn’t really bring himself to care, though he did wonder when they’d had the time to make new friends in the midst of this summer’s chaos.
Harry entered the Great Hall with all of the other returning students crowded around him. He basked in how invisible it made him, how his classmates shielded him from the younger students who just wanted one look at the chosen one.
Let the fun begin...
“What did you think was hidden here?” Malfoy asked.
The wand slipped from Harry’s hand and tumbled through the air into the death eater’s outstretched palm. The death eater dropped his hood, laughing again, and removed his mask. And it was Draco Malfoy standing before him.
“Draco,” He said lamely, “Draco Malfoy.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, her tone exasperated. “Wants to start up his favorite hobby of eavesdropping on all of Malfoy’s conversations.”
“You got that look on your face, like you were sinking into your own self destructive thoughts.” Pansy replied with a shrug. “We don’t need you feeling bad for yourself before we even get to the school. Besides you don’t even know what it will be like yet.”
“Yes I am.” Harry said, glaring openly now. The words came a tad easier.
“Something we wanted.”
“How would destroying something possibly hurt him?” Malfoy ground out.
The moment Harry had made it through the door he knew this new professor was going to be trouble. It was that glint behind his eyes, that longing for malice. Harry wondered how McGonagall had selected him to be a staff member at Hogwarts. Were they as desperate for teachers as they had been before the war? Even more so with so many dead and even more still in hiding?
Malfoy seemed to reach that same conclusion as he came to take his seat. He didn’t think Malfoy would dare hex him, at least not here in front of all of these witnesses. Harry couldn’t help but slide his chair a little bit further away from him though.
Draco strode into the potions room with his head held high and found that about a dozen people were already seated throughout. Immediately he noticed that something seemed off, Ron, Hermione and Harry were not sitting with each other as they usually would have done. Had they had some fight? Draco doubted it, after all, they’d seemed fine earlier when he’d seem them at breakfast. And they’d all left together too.
Draco blinked. “Partners?” He drawled.
“Because we wanted it.”
Ron turned on Harry, his ears red with annoyance or anger. “Bloody hell, mate? I thought you were done with all of this! It’s over! Voldemort is dead! There is no reason for you to tail Malfoy.” Harry couldn’t bear to admit to them that he wasn’t really worried about Malfoy being up to anything nefarious, so he pressed his lips together and gave a resigned nod. “Good, now last I checked, we have a free period to enjoy right now. So, should we go to the grounds- maybe visit Hagrid? Or we could hit the kitchens, I’m sure the house elves would love to give us some snacks, or maybe just the common room? What do you think Mione?”
“So…” Malfoy began, his tone impatient. “Are you ready to tell me how the hell you think getting something from my house could possibly bring about the end of the Dark Lord?”
Harry pressed his lips firmly together and stared at Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyelid twitched in annoyance. “Fine.” He growled and stalked out of the room, slamming the door shut and clicking the lock behind him.
Finally, with his back to Harry, he asked, “And? Would it?”
Draco all but ran into the nearest bathroom, bracing his arms on either side of a sink and bowing his head low. He swallowed hard and attempted to steady his ragged breathing. He was fine.
“Or...” Draco drawled, “He could have argued for me to be locked up in Azkaban forever and the Wizengamot simply ignored him.”
It took a few minutes for the potion to come into effect, but once it had, Harry’s head felt light and empty. It was like all of the weight that had been on his shoulders had vanished.
He knew she had been hoping they’d get back together, but after everything that had happened, Harry didn’t think he was ready for a relationship. Even stranger, he wasn’t entirely sure whether he still held feelings for her at all.
He tugged uselessly at the chains, searching for any weak point, but there was none. Just as there had been none in all of his previous attempts in the hour since Malfoy had left. It struck him how very muggle all of this was- no enchantments on the room or the chains, he was confined by nothing but the physical- chains and a locked door. And the door had locked too slowly for it to have been done with the flick of a wand. He had locked it manually, by hand.
“What’s up with that anyway?” Ron asked, “Where did you go?”
The Great Hall looked nearly the same as it had before the war had torn it apart. It was still lined with the four house tables and the staff table at the head. The only remarkable change was the hundred or so candles that floated five meters above their heads. Harry squinted at the nearest one and his heart lurched. The candle’s flame glowed a deep scarlet to match its red wax, and there, emblazoned on the side, Harry could just make out two elegant, golden letters; FW. A little cluster of other candles had gathered nearby. JP. LE. RL. SB. All with the same coloring as the first. Harry’s heart lurched in his chest as he understood their meaning, what- who they signified.
Despite how parched he was, Harry kept his mouth firmly closed and eyed the water suspiciously. Malfoy sighed theatrically and said, “Fine, die of thirst then.” He began to withdraw the water when Harry gave in and parted his lips. For a heart stopping moment he thought Malfoy wasn’t going to give it back, but then he did and Harry was hastily gulping it down. It was the best thing he had ever tasted, cool and fresh and clean and a little bit sweet and- water wasn’t meant to be sweet.
“Go where?”
Potter hesitated for a long moment, holding his angry glare before he lowered his gaze with a muttered, “fine,” and took his seat, just a few rows behind Draco.
"Harry!"
to him.
"Fine, but we will finish this discussion later at home." Ron gently kissed Hermione's cheek. "I love you both." He turned and nodded at Harry. "This weekend?"
With a flick of his wand, another armchair appeared and a table for the tray. Narcissa settled and Draco leaned forward to play Mother.
She bustled into his room, rolls of parchment in her arms and floating memos circling her head. An attractive male assistant trailed behind her, plucked some notes out of the air, marked them with a quill and sent them off with a flick of his wand.
Panting, Harry broke the kiss as he pushed Malfoy against the wall. "Are you mad?"
"He's a Slytherin," Ron began, but before Hermione could interrupt, Rose did.
Harry nodded. "I'd be much in your debt if you could see your way into shrinking my acquisitions, and letting me pass, Tom."
"Ow. I think I bruised myself on the ice," Harry moaned and stretched out of Draco's arms. "The floor was a bad idea."
Andromeda shook her hand and laid her palm on his hand. Harry turned his hand over and entwined their fingers. "Nonsense. I understand why. We all have to find ourselves, Harry. No apologies are necessary."
Harry turned to Malfoy. "As for your interest, we can arrange private lessons for you as well. As long as I have time to craft for my business then I don't mind taking on students."
"Yes," Draco hissed and arched into the determine stroke.  "Please!"
"Both," Hermione and Malfoy answered at the same time then turned to glare at one another.
"Scorpius, Rosebud, why don't you go get something to drink at the Broomsticks?" Harry dug out some sickles from his pocket and tossed them at the two children. Silver flashed into the air and small hands reached out to grab the flying currency.
Ron groaned. "I don't need to hear this."
"Hey!"
The shop bell rang in the silent room and then the door clicked shut. Arguing exploded.
! He was to meet Rose this morning for breakfast and to go to Mr Potter's shop for his next lesson! Scorpius waved his wand and watched the numbers smoke from the end, sighing when he realized it was still early enough to not have missed breakfast. He checked her note for their meeting time and then turned to the gift box from his mother. He tore into the wrap and then groaned as he pulled a pair of pants free of the box. He unfolded the silky boxers and stared. Floppy antlers and a red nose looked back at him and horrified, he stuffed them back into the box before dashing back to his room to bury the gift in the bottom of his trunk, wondering why his mother thought it necessary to embarrass him like this.
Draco felt a frisson of fear scale through him and eyed Astoria. "You wouldn't."
Draco felt the smirking regard of his mother. "He came home," he whispered.
Draco swallowed and then whispered. "I never would have guessed that he would leave."
"Mrs Granger-Weasley, Draco. We are drawing an audience." Narcissa cast her eyes around the pub and then hooked her arm in Draco's arm, pulling him away from Granger-Weasley. "Perhaps Mr Potter can clear this matter to everyone's mutual satisfaction."
Lucius continued to make a face at him, and Draco shovelled the cookies in, stopping only to drink his tea.
Laughing, Astoria stepped back and studied him, and Draco tried not to squirm under the scrutiny. She's always been a quiet one when they were younger, and yet, she could see right to the heart of most matters. She was especially accurate with her deductions when she set her mind on a subject.
"A wizard never goes anywhere without his wand," Harry said. "And contrary to popular belief, I am
Kingsley called the session to order, and balls of light shot from the seated members of the Wizengamot wands, including Harry's, and struck the crystal chandelier, lighting the Hall.
Narcissa waved to the man, which made the confused look on his face, screw up his expression into something else entirely. She looked away and caught sight of the shop where they were being led.
"I know about Mother's and Astoria's roles, but Hermione?"
"If I may, Potter," Malfoy drawled.
In an hour or so the students from the school would invade the town for a day of revelry away from their studies. He was prepared, somewhat, for the children to spend their Galleons for last-minute needs, gifts, or wants before they left to go home for the holidays next week.
Astoria narrowed her eyes. "Don't disparage my son."
"I'd like to see more of this artisan's work."
"Does this mean you are going to stop eye-fucking me at the Ministry?" Malfoy drawled.
Dereliction and sorrow welled in him, seeming to burst from the very scar that throbbed on his chest. He sobbed, calling out for Severus, his father, and even finally, Harry himself, as the terror forced his heart into a frantic rhythm. He was going to die, like a snivelling coward.
"The prodigal son returns," Lucius drawled, and Draco nearly dropped the plate of cookies. He managed to juggle the dishes and set them on the table though without any mishaps.
"I have not! Don't accuse me of something that you can't back up with facts!"
His parents vanished under the awning over the front door of the manor and Draco's eyes were once again drawn to the gates holding the world back.
He moaned, the touches, the heat, and the weight of the water washed away the Night Mare's lingering presence. Harry's soft voice, reassuring, caressed him as the strong calloused hands of his lover held him.
Burgundy uniformed Aurors lined the Floo Hall, escorting elderly and young alike towards the Wizengamot Chambers. Bill waved to her then escorted Fleur and Louis inside. Outside the entrance door, Kingsley stood, his purple robes formal and stiff indicating his status as Minister.
Hogsmeade had expanded over the years, but Narcissa thought the little hamlet was still one of the prettiest she had ever seen. Colourful lights decorated the roof of the shops and sparkled on the mounded snow.
Harry looked around, taking in the changes as the bricks closed up behind him. He wandered, grateful for the spells that hid him from strangers. Only those Harry desired could see through the ancient magics that he'd agree to have cast on him. It gave me a measure of peace as he ambled down the magical alley.
Kreacher eyed him. "Busy, Master Harry. Kreacher has much to keep himself busy." He gave Harry a smirk. "Did Master Harry need something or did he just want to make small talk?"
Draco lay under Harry, groaning and trying not to chuckle. This being the umpteenth time Harry had shouted those words and had hit the ice, but the first time he'd managed to take Draco down with him. He wasn't certain that Harry truly was done until they vanished from the ice.
went unsaid, but Harry heard it nonetheless.
"An emergency session of the Wizengamot is opening. All seated members for the Houses and Families are called upon to attend immediately. Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, an attache from Gringotts and Harry Potter will be present. Repeating…"
“No, you did not.”
“Why?” Harry asked.
He leaned against the coolness of the window pane, letting it seep through him and push the thoughts from his mind. Pansy and Blaise, his only two friends who hadn’t been sent to Azkaban or been killed, sat across from him. They’d gotten together over the summer and Pansy had mellowed out some, at least she’d stopped following him around like a lost puppy begging for scraps. During his time as a death eater, her feelings for Draco had faded completely, and Draco was glad of it. It had always been hard for him to be around her knowing he could never return how she felt for him.
Harry smiled to himself. In Malfoy’s anger he had forgotten to replace the blindfold.
It must have been days before Malfoy returned, for Harry was weak and he knew the end was nearing. He was just about to succumb to the peace death would offer him when the blindfold was torn from his face. Malfoy’s leering face filled his vision, blurred as it was without his glasses, there was no mistaking those grey eyes and that blond hair. “You look like shit.” Malfoy drawled. Harry’s mouth was too dry for him to even attempt speech so he settled for glaring at Malfoy. His expression slipped into open longing when Malfoy conjured a glass of water.
“Don’t go there.” She ordered, crossing her arms and leaning back.
Harry raised his chin and tried to keep as much of the little dignity he had left. “I’m still in that room, aren’t I?”
"Just a moment," Draco called. "I want that. It's one of a kind piece."
Harry wriggled his eyebrows at Draco and slanted his mouth across Draco's.
As they marathon bought their way through Diagon Alley, and now London, he'd even managed to find something nice for Asteria. Even on the decidedly chilly terms with which they parted, they managed to be civil with one another for Scorpius' sake. He knew it was entirely his fault and owned that mistake, but both he and Asteria were happier now that it was over. That didn't mean that there had been no fallout from his mistakes.
Narcissa nodded as she took the book. "I was rather hoping to have more of the unique pottery like the mug."
Dampening his hands, Harry started the wheel spinning, ignoring the crowd that gathered outside his shop window. It wasn't often that he worked out front for this exact reason, but today he was feeling rather frisky.
Harry looked over at Narcissa and she made a face. Harry lifted a hand and snapped his fingers, a loud crack echoing in his shop. The pottery rattled dangerously and every person in the room froze.
Harry reached up and pulled Malfoy down into another kiss, still trying to stroke and thrust at the same time. Malfoy moved with him until they were both spent. Harry leaned against Malfoy, their foreheads rested together as they breathed in each other's faces.
Harry stood on the front porch of his little chalet bungalow, drinking his morning tea and watching the sunrise. It was chilly on the coast, the breeze from the ocean almost frigid in early December. He shivered, drawing his cloak about him more securely as he drank more tea and waited. The sky's colours grew in before him, the purple night sky bleeding away into vibrant reds, oranges, pinks and blues.
Lucius huffed. "As if that shade of red ever had a good side."
Harry handed him a letter. "Will you take that to the Headmistress and then my business is done. Thank you again, Kreacher."
"What style of robes are you looking to acquire, Mr Potter?"
Malfoy straightened and she nodded at him as Harry watched. "My apologies, Malfoy, for my earlier actions as well as those of my husband."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Mrs Granger-Weasley. Now that we are here, perhaps we can come to a gentle wizard's agreement about my mug."
"The Wizengamot needed someone to blame, Draco."
"It is still
"It was clean and I found it at Harrods. How was I to know it was yours?"
Andromeda smiled and watched Narcissa wrestle with herself before she spoke again. "And you won't reconsider Draco as an alternative?"
Passing Foyles, Harry stopped and backtracked, entering the overcrowded bookstore and wandering around for several minutes. He selected several books and paid for them before exiting back onto the street.
If nothing else, Andromeda could appeal to the kinship of motherhood she and Hermione would share. and Narcissa would respect that.
Another soft kiss to the nape of his neck and Harry's voice followed him back into sleep. "Rest well, my dragon, I am here."
This particular mug was a prototype for a set of drinkware that Hannah had commissioned from him for the Three Broomsticks. She had wanted a heavy-duty, durable set of mugs for the patrons to use as she slowly updated the pub wear.
Hermione looked up, narrowing her eyes at Draco. "Beg pardon?"
he thought as he stabbed his toast into the porridge then shoved it into his mouth. As he ate he mentally added to his list of places to visit whilst in town. He still had to get gifts for his grandmother and his father. Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes was out, but Scrivenshaft's might prove fruitful, or perhaps Dervish and Bangs. He knew that his grandmother was fond of Honeydukes' dark chocolate fudge and the almond nougat, but he'd already sent some of that to her for her birthday.
Malfoy hissed and his head banged back around the wall as Harry stroked him. His long arms reached for Harry and Harry snuggled in close, his eyes falling shut as Malfoy's cool fingers enfolded his flesh.
"Kreacher!"
Harry laughed. "Would you do me a favour and see if Hermione and Ron are able to receive visitors, please?"
With a sigh, she looked at the spread of food across the table and rubbed a hand over her rounded stomach. The meal presentation was like something out of a magazine. Molly's dishes shared the stage with the meticulously prepared holiday favourites, with the large goose, holding centre stage. Pretty and floral tureens held steaming vegs and other delicacies all waiting to be exclaimed over and greedily consumed. The Weasley women had outdone themselves this year, and with a nod from Molly, Hermione flicked her wand and sent out the call for dinner.
He wiped his arm across his brow, wicked away the sweat gathered there and finished spinning the mug he was working on. It would take nearly a week before he could fire this mug, but as he was placing his pieces in the kiln this morning, he had a quick burst of inspiration.
as Potter twirled with both the new Mrs Longbottom as well as his Muggle. They cut a remarkable figure on the dancefloor in the ballroom at the Longbottom Estate. Potter in the Muggle tuxedo with tails that flared when he was spun by the Muggle.
Lucius entered the room and she felt his gaze roam over her. He'd always been the most important light in her life until Draco had been placed in her arms. His position had once gain changed when Scorpius was born, but she adored all her Malfoy men with a fierceness that really couldn't be quantified. A woman's heart had no borders where love was concerned.
"Hold on to your wand. Weasley isn't going anywhere." Tiberius smirked at him. "If Lupin lets you anywhere near his cousin."
"I want you to stop baiting Ron and Hermione about Harry. It does nothing to change my mind about the decisions I have made regarding Teddy's care."
"Harry!" Scorpius shouted and wasted no time in moving across the room to jump into Harry's arms.
Draco licked his lips. "Possibly."
Ron grunted and grabbed a bottle of firewhisky from the cabinet and another glass. "Yeah, his owl arrived just after Kreacher and Hermione and I agreed that it'd be best to handle this all at once."
"It's been five years, Draco. That was always the plan. You all had time to live your lives and make the changes necessary for the future."
"Mummy, tell him you're sorry all on your own."
"No," Harry cut across her. "Draco and Astoria tried to help me, but in the end, I did what was best by giving up my "magic". Dumbledore's spells saved me."
"Do you mind if I pop in and watch?" Ron asked.
"Thank you, Harry," Hermione leaned forward and kissed his cheek. "I really am sorry."
Arthur blushed. "I suppose not, but I can say without a doubt that no fairies are trapped inside the bulbs or have come to any harm."
Harry sighed. "It was mutually beneficial to all the involved parties."
"Your admirer."
A great, white stag strode into the room and the black Night Mare rose to meet him. The two animals stalked one another while Draco's life swung between them. They clashed, shadows of light and dark, breaking off of the beasts, and then a man walked through their fight toward him.
"Bill. Ron." Both men stood and drew their wands, pointing the slightly glowing tips at Arthur. "Since you both are the only Weasleys with male heirs, as retiring Patriarch, I pass on the legacy of our House and Family to you."
so everyone," Harry spread his arms. "Everyone could have a chance at a better life. You, me, Malfoy and the future generations that were brought into this world. You are letting the past discolour the future. In front of the entire world, I might add, and you don't even realize what you are doing!"
Harry narrowed his eyes at her and shook his head. "Listen to me, Andromeda. I need to show you something." Reaching into his jacket, he withdrew his wand from the inside pocket, showing her the length of holly.
Malfoy looked up at Harry and nodded. "I agree. A godfather is an honour and an involved role in a child's life. You have influence that parents often don't, and you help shape the child into an adult just by your very presence. A second sort of teacher or mentor, if you will"
"Harry will be here soon," Andromeda whispered. "He's good and right for Teddy."
Andromeda nodded and settled back in the bed, closing her eyes for a moment and sighing. It was quiet in the house, though she could hear Teddy playing outside. His shouts and those of the rest of her adopted family made her heart soar. She knew it wasn't long, and although she was trying to outlast the holiday, she knew it wasn't likely to happen.
Draco contemplates the holidays.
Harry leaned back and grinned. "No, no. Now, I'll just fuck you at the Ministry, Draco."
"Are you all right?" Draco inquired.
Potter smiled at Draco then, and it took his breath away. Perhaps he'd been wrong about Potter being his type. The man was utterly beguiling when he smiled.
His desires were presented before him when Harry left the bank and Flourish and Blotts. He stopped and watched Malfoy be fitted.
Draco barely had time to wonder about the last guest when he heard the doorbell sound throughout the house.  An elderly male elf entered the room and Draco drew in a breath. His mouth went dry and he could hear Astoria as she dissolved into unladylike sniggering, but all Draco could do was just stare.
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked, a little annoyed.
“Yes I do.” He muttered.
And he could see it then, he could see that they were going to have a rematch of their previous fight. But in his panic and anxiety, Malfoy hadn’t attacked him, hadn’t even seemed to realize that Harry was there at all. Harry had stood their, stunned, for a long while after Malfoy had gone, unsure what any of it meant. Then the bell rang and he was late, late on the first day of classes with a new professor.
The teacher- Devereux, he thought it was- strode to the front of the classroom and opened his mouth to begin their first lecture of the year, when Potter rushed in. Draco hadn’t even noticed that he wasn’t there to begin with. Devereux’s face twisted with annoyance. “Ah, Mr. Potter, our favorite celebrity.” Draco’s thoughts shifted to that of his old head of house, Snape. Hadn’t he said something similar to Potter when he had first met him? His heart twinged painfully. Snape may have been an asshole, but he was the main reason Draco had never become a murderer. His mother had told him how Snape had made an unbreakable vow with her in order to protect him. “Surely fame doesn’t give you a free pass to come waltzing into class whenever you’d like?” Draco was ripped out of his thoughts by the words and his fingernails tore uselessly into his palms. He hissed at the sensation, but didn’t relent until he felt blood swell at the half moon indents.
Harry nodded, “Yes.”
“What’s going on?” Ron asked, catching up to Harry and Hermione as she tugged him along.
. It had just been a cauldron- it worried him that such a small thing elicited such a reaction from him. With trembling fingers he turned on the tap and let the cool water pool in his cupped hands. Once enough water had collected, he brought his hands to his face, dousing himself.
“Wanted it for what?”
During the entire lesson Harry couldn’t help but stare at Malfoy. The blond would not stop fidgeting the entire time Devereux was lecturing. Harry had never noticed him having a problem with sitting still before. Was this a new thing- triggered by anxiety? Or was it just that Harry hadn’t been paying attention before? Whatever it was, he was paying attention now. He knew what Hermione would say. She’d tell him to lay off and stop being so nosy. And she was probably right. Getting back into old- bad- habits so soon, was certainly a… downgrade… a relapse of sorts.
A poisonous glint entered Malfoy’s eyes as his grin widened. “I see.” He pressed his wand harshly against Ginny’s temple and muttered some incantation Harry didn’t recognize. A small whimper escaped her before her body seemed to dissolve into the air itself.
From the look of him, he was sure this man was from a noble family. Perhaps he was a sympathizer, like the Weasleys. He had to be with how disgusted he was by Draco. He had the sudden urge to scream at the wizard, let him know that he was not like his family- or at least… he didn’t want to be. He settled for a soft, “I am not my parents.”
He’d seen Potter, Longbottom, Granger and Weasley on Platform 9¾ and of course Pansy and Blaise were returning, but he couldn’t dredge up any other faces from the recesses of his mind.
Adrenaline rocked through him as he shimmied out of the rest of the chain and dashed across the room to the door. A simple unlocking spell had the door opened and then he was bursting through it. Only then did he realize he had no clue how to navigate the maze of hallways he was now trapped inside. Hastily he cast his patronus and sent it off with a message to the Order, warning them of what had happened in case he didn’t make it out of here. The more hallways he turned down, the lower his odds became and the more his hope and adrenaline guttered out.
She relaxed visibly and asked, “And no visions?”
Devereux scoffed and said, “I’m aware you have a bad record for teachers at this school. But in a normal environment, teachers demand respect, not fear.” He strode across the room, his expression growing smug. “Perhaps you could learn some respect from detention with Mr. Malfoy.” Devereux grinned wide enough to show all of his gleaming teeth and gestured towards Draco.
“No.” Draco sneered as he stalked to his spot and dumped his stuff down on the ground. “You neglected to mention that bit.”
He ran in circles for what felt like hours with no luck. All of the doors were evenly spaced, unmarked and all of the ones he tried were locked- and warded since Alohomora failed to do the job. He had no idea whether he had discovered new hallways with each turn or if he was merely retracing his steps. How the hell was this even a house at all? It seemed far too large, to infinite and repetitive and…
“We thought something might be hidden here…” Harry said slowly.
So Draco contented himself with thinking about who else might be returning to Hogwarts for this Eighth Year of sorts.
Hermione, ever observant, asked him, “Harry, your scar isn’t hurting you, is it?” She sounded so alarmed that everyone turned and looked at him, except for Ginny, who had already been staring. All summer- which he had spent at the Burrow- Ginny had been trying to get him alone.
It was almost as though Malfoy wanted him to escape. Harry laughed aloud at the thought, as absurd and ridiculous as it was. Harry dismissed it immediately and began running through the long list of spells he knew, trying to think of something he might have missed. Hermione would have known what to do. But she wasn’t here, he didn’t even know if she was alive. He thought of her dark curly hair and her laugh, the exasperation that always filled her tone when explaining something that Harry and Ron should have known. Ron… his bullheaded, kind friend. Braver than anyone Harry knew. Tears threatened to escape the corners of Harry’s eyes at the thought of them. His two best friends in the entire world… and both of them might be dead.
In the end, Hermione and her partner were the only ones successful in revealing that the Professor’s name was Moore. Malfoy cast a glowering look in Harry’s direction as they packed their things and cleaned up their workstation, but he didn’t say anything.
And fight it he did.
“Nope.” Harry replied shortly.
Harry sighed and turned to face Malfoy. But he was already frantically flipping through the pages of his advanced potion making book. Harry decided the best course of action would be to do the same thing in the hope of finding something useful.
It was the little things that reminded Harry that the war was over. That he had won. That he had survived it. It was the way the wind shifted the autumn turning leaves, the gentle hooting of Ron’s owl, the way the sky turned eerie but not quite dark just after the sun set.
“Yes.”
Ron groaned theatrically and tipped his head back as though in prayer. “Don’t you dare start up on this again. Not everyone in this school is a bloody death eater, mate. Give it a rest already. Voldemort is gone, I don’t need another year filled with your death eater theories.”
“What?”
“I was right about Malfoy, wasn’t I?” Harry shot back, annoyed. “It would seem that my instincts are pretty damn accurate, so maybe you shouldn’t be so quick to dismiss me.”
Understanding lanced through Harry just as the laughing started and he came to a skidding halt. “You asshole.” He ground out as Malfoy rounded a corner, his expression smug.
He shook his head, they’d had this conversation nearly everyday over the summer. “Nope. My head has been blissfully empty.”
“You tried to get in here without knowing what you were looking for?” Malfoy asked, his voice returning to that tone of superiority, mixed with something Harry couldn’t quite recognize.
“What?” Hermione exclaimed, momentarily baffled. Never had there been assigned seats at Hogwarts before. Harry did his best to keep from reacting altogether. Ron only gaped at Ginny in vague disbelief and horror.
The Order had suspected for a while that Voldemort might have hidden a horcrux at the manor, but they were unwilling to act on it, and unwilling to send Harry into the field, so he had taken matters into his own hands. And now, because of him, Hermione, Ron and Ginny might be dead. His stomach twisted painfully at the thought and he pressed his lips together resolutely, in blatant refusal to cooperate. Malfoy’s hand tightened around his neck in response. “Answer me.” Malfoy snarled and squeezed even harder. He only loosened his grip when Harry began to feel faint and on the verge of passing out. As soon as the pressure was alleviated he took in long gulping breaths of air. His lungs burned. “Why were you trying to break in?” Malfoy hissed again. Harry still refused to answer. “Fine.” Malfoy muttered and his hand disappeared completely. “We’ll do this the hard way.”
“We shouldn’t just do one potion.” He said.
He sighed and thumped his head back against the glass, closing his eyes and surrendering to a nightmare filled sleep.
“She’s gone.” Malfoy said, enjoying Harry’s distress, “You’ll never see her again.”
“Been here the whole time.” Malfoy gloated, his arms extended out to either side of himself as though he expected some sort of applause to rain down on him.
“Well, you will be working with whoever I have paired you with for the entirety of the year. Whatever grades you get, your partner also gets and vice versa.” She explained merrily. “Now, I think everyone is here, so let’s begin.”
“I doubt it.” Pansy said and turned back to Blaise, resting her head in the crook of his neck and closing her eyes. A clear sign that the conversation was finished.
Harry gaped at him. Malfoy looked so different than the last time Harry had seen him. He’d filled out, all broad shoulders and muscled arms. His cheekbones had risen impossibly higher and his jawline had grown more pronounced. His hair was longer and no longer coated in a thick layer of gel, instead curling naturally around his ears pleasantly. Harry hadn’t laid eyes on him since their sixth year, the night Malfoy had murdered Dumbledore in the astronomy tower and solidified his position within Voldemort’s ranks. That had been eight years ago. Harry had tried keeping tabs on him- had tried keeping track of all of the death eaters, but Malfoy had become a ghost. Missing for months and then popping up to kill an Order member before disappearing back into the shadows.
Harry hesitated. He didn’t know what he intended to do, but it felt wrong to leave Malfoy alone with him. Especially after everything he had seen today with Malfoy being so… delicate.
As soon as it was possible, he slipped out of the hall, intent on getting to his dorm room without incident. But, of course, the cards were stacked against him. He had barely made it ten meters when Granger stopped him in his tracks. Her shrill voice made him want to gouge off his ears. “Fancied some alone time, Malfoy?”
“He’s abroad.” Malfoy snapped, “And besides, I haven’t gotten everything I wanted out of you yet.” Malfoy jerked his hand through the air and across his body in a slashing motion. With that single movement chords tore from the walls on either side of Harry and wrapped around his wrists, pulling taught and minimizing his ability to move. He could hardly even shift from side to side.
It wasn’t that Harry thought he was better than the rest of them, he just thought that maybe defeating the darkest wizard to ever live would have some perks. Such as not being forced to sit with a death eater.
“No, Harry, I think Ron’s right on this one.” Hermione said. “You didn’t see the way Devereux acted when he first saw Malfoy. He was so revolted by him and his family, there’s no way he can possibly be one of them.” Harry sighed and decided against continuing to argue. It wasn’t as though he really thought Devereux was a death eater, not really. People could be total dicks without being death eaters.
Harry’s chest rose and fell unevenly as he watched her vanish. It was growing harder and harder to breathe. A lump had formed in his throat, straining his lungs and making his eyes water. “What did you do to her?”
He focused all of that magic, all of that power, into the chains that bound him and muttered over and over, “Confringo. Confringo. Confringo!” It started slow, like a building rattle in a single link of the chain and then it burst with a loud clank as each side fell away against the ground.
“Since I highly doubt a single one of you was listening at the welcoming feast yesterday, I took the liberty of writing my name on the board.” The professor said. Harry glanced around, but saw absolutely nothing. Had his eyes gotten worse? The rest of the class seemed to be just as confused as he was though. “Your first task of the year shall be brewing a potion that can be poured over the chalkboard to reveal the hidden writing there.” The professor continued. “Remember to work with your partners on this, don’t just do it on your own.” She glanced knowingly at Harry. “Ready? Begin.”
Only when the feast appeared before him did Harry wrench his gaze away from the flickering flames above.
He glared after her for a long time as though she would reappear at any moment. But of course she didn’t and eventually he snapped himself out of it, stalking down the corridors until he reached the Slytherin common room.
“Right,” Harry muttered and got to work. He was hardly five minutes into brewing his two potions simultaneously when the consistency of one of them began to differ from what the book described. It made him miss Snape’s old book again, he knew if he’d been following those instructions then this potion would be going swimmingly. But the Room of Hidden Things had been destroyed from the Fiendfyre that had consumed it during the Battle of Hogwarts. He wondered if it was worth trying to find it in the mess of ash and rumble. He’d ventured inside once after the Battle of Hogwarts had drawn to a close, and the smell alone had been enough to suffocate him.
"Master Scorpius is well if mischievous." Millie giggled then glanced at Narcissa before she focused on Harry once more. " He and Missus Astoria are at the manor." She stopped then added. "Master Draco is there, too."
"Thank you for being civil whilst Ron was being an arse."
Draco watched the workers meander over the grounds like ants, decorating the lawns and the house for the holiday. Snow fell lightly, added to the work that had to be done, but as he watched, Draco felt a sense of loss. He wasn't certain if it was the time of year or the circumstances that were looming.
It wasn't an immense surprise when Potter stood up for Granger on her wedding day. Rumours persisted about her parents being lost in the Muggle world. It was downright scandalous, though, when Neville Longbottom wed Ginevra Weasley, and Potter attended the wedding with a strange Muggle man on his arm; a tall blond one that had blue eyes.
Tea had been set on a low table, and dainty biscuits and sandwiches were stacked in tidy pyramids all waiting to be consumed. The same female house elf was setting places at the table, dishes floating about her head as she moved the linens to make room for Draco.
"The Wizengamot wanted to take Teddy from Andromeda and force him as my heir. I wasn't going to let them do that."
"I did want to thank you, though."
Draco skidded to a stop and braced himself to help Harry up from the ice. He dug the toe end of the blade into the ice hard to make certain Harry didn't drag them both down. Scowling at Weasley as he cackled and zoomed by them, Draco brushed the ice shavings off Harry's arse and squeezed one cheek for good measure.
Andromeda and Narcissa stared at him, eyes wide and mouths open in shock. Narcissa recovered first and sank into a chair at the table beside Andromeda. She shuddered and ran a hand over her face before looking back up at Harry. She studied him for several minutes. Harry felt like a bug under glass and was certain she didn't know Legilimency, but he let her look.
He smirked at her and leaned back in his chair, biting the head off of a Father Christmas.
, # 11:
Harry smirked. "Of course."
Draco swallowed and Harry stepped forward, opening his arms. Draco met him in the middle and held him. Harry buried his face in Draco's shoulder, his nose rubbing against the bare skin of Draco's neck.
"Explain your process, if you would. It rather looked like some form of Legilimency," Malfoy said, eyeing the blank, blue mug on the counter. "Unless it's a trade secret?"
Her gasp made him turn, and he watched as the stein fell in slow motion. Old Seeker reflexes responded and he caught the glazed handle neatly.
Granger-Weasley had set him straight on a great many things about Potter before he had arrived at their home that evening, but it still didn't dull his interest. He considered his mother' opinion on the matter a nonstarter as she had some very strange ideas about Draco's interest. He couldn't say she was wrong about Draco's interest, but Potter wasn't the sort of plaything he'd enjoyed in the past. He didn't have time for a committed relationship, but idle interest was always there. Besides, if Potter would allow him to take lessons, it would be unseemly to engage in that sort of manner with him.
A smile graced her beautiful features and she stood. Harry stared at her rotund stomach and then pointed at her. "Look at you!"
Harry held up a hand. "Give me the mug."
"Well, look at that." His father's voice was shocked.
Potter was too good, too innocent, despite the war for Draco. Life moved on and most of the time it was easy for him. His father's money had done its part to clear his name, even though it was forever tarnished by the brand on his arm.
"Nothing but buy a bloody mug, Granger-Weasley!" He snarled and then calmed when his mother patted his arm. Draco frowned. "I just Confounded him because he wouldn't sell the mug and left a fifty £ note on the counter. No Oblivation needed."
"Of course, Mr Potter. Please have a seat. Olivia will be right in with some tea. " The man snapped his fingers and a house-elf appeared.
Harry exited the Floo at the Leaky Cauldron and brushed the soot from his robes. He stepped away only to hear the fire flair again and out stepped Draco Malfoy.
Bill's long hair was pulled back and contained by a thong, his dragonhide trousers traded for deep black robes with dark blue trim indicating his role as Patriarch. Louis stood beside him, a miniature heir in training. Magic swirled about Hermione and her maternity robes changed. The colourful red for the holiday deepened and turned black with a lighter blue trim indicating Ron's status as the second.
"Not subtle or helpful to the Dark Lord, Draco. I am ... disappointed."
"Yes?"
"Bloody show-off," Draco muttered.
Harry watched the bird breathe, its large chest swelling with each inhale, a parchment clutched in its curled talon. Huge dark eyes studied him, almost as if making certain he was its intended recipient. He supposed that it had been a bit rough getting through the protection spells he'd cast and felt a bit sorry for the owl. He also wondered just how the bird had found him. Very few people bothered with him as of late.
Narcissa stiffened and lifted her nose in the air. "I wish nothing but the best for the girl and her Weasley."
She checked her watch and squealed when she realized that she was going to be late for breakfast. Scrambling out of bed, she jerked her cloak off the coat tree and ducked the flying houseshoes from her roommates as she nearly flew out the door.
He stood and Lucius pushed to his feet as well, Narcissa backing away even as she was shoved aside by Lucius.
Harry arched into the caresses and then stepped back and shook his head at Draco.
"At what cost, though?"
"Tonks House," George shouted and then shoved Harry into the green wall of fire.
And then it appeared. The Night Mare. The dark horse stepped forward, red eyes blazing, and Draco's eyes widened. Nightmares were one thing, but a Night Mare, a Night Mare could kill you, if you couldn't find your way free from the beast.
Dinner is interrupted for Harry's arrival
"Still."
Narcissa rolled her eyes. "Of that I have no doubts."
"Crafty little thing to return to its maker." Arthur shrugged.
A rare snowfall drifted on the wind as Draco peered out the window. The grounds were gently covered in a light dusting, the Evergreen grass bleeding through the powder as more and more precipitation settled on the lawn. The bleak chill and dimness of midwinter settled in Draco's bones like a living entity.
"Millie has a message. Mistress Astoria knows you is here, Master Harry Potter. She be requesting your presence at Nott Estates tomorrow. Master Draco will be there as well as Master Scorpius."
Narcissa made a face. "Tell Millie to retrieve me when she returns and I will leave you to your visitor, Andi."
Potter's voice drew Draco out of his ruminations to realize that they had stopped just down The Hogs Head in front of a holiday cart. Both Potter and the vendor were staring at him.
"Be nice, you two," Andromeda scolded and Harry cringed at the breathless quality of her tone. "If you can't, then I shall have to call Hermione and no one wants that."
Rosie sighed. "Daddy, you need to apologize, too. Neither Uncle Harry nor Scorpius Malfoy did anything wrong."
He sighed when he finished the tea, giving the dregs a cursory glance before dumping the unreadable leaves into the little compost bin beside the house. Setting the cup aside, Harry leaned back and nibbled on his toast, taking in the solitude. It was quiet in Millport, in spite of the tourist-filled summers, and Harry breathed in the peacefulness.
It had hurt to hear his father act like that again. Draco hadn't yelled like that since Asteria had left. Scorpius had been so embarrassed, and he knew Rose had been as well. She'd said as much when they'd finally made it to the Three Broomsticks. Merlin! He'd thought she was going to set fire to the table with her words, and all he could do was watch as she'd ranted. It was a bit fascinating, to be honest with the picture she made. He'd understood then, the old tales about where the angry red-headed witches had come from. But she'd spent her spleen then and calmed, and they'd had a nice time.
Harry waited in tense silence for something to happen, for anything to happen. The minutes turned into hours and still Malfoy did nothing. For the first half hour or so, Harry had pictured him standing there, watching Harry squirm. But he’s soon drawn the conclusion that Malfoy must have left, gone off to some other part of the manor, or left it entirely. It seemed like too much to hope for.
On the first day of term, he rolled out of his bed, already in a sour mood. And to worsen matters further, neither Harry or Ron could remember who their new Professor was going to be. Whoever it was, Harry knew that McGonagall had introduced them, they simply hadn’t been paying close enough attention.
Harry couldn’t believe his luck. Or rather lack thereof. He had been paired with his worst rival, second only to Voldemort himself. Well, technically maybe third to Dolores Umbridge. But still... He’d fought and killed Voldemort and yet he was still forced to work with that snobbish ferret in class. He wondered if Snape was laughing at him right now from beyond the grave. Snape would certainly approve of the professor’s ability to treat him exactly the same as everyone else.
Harry had long since stopped listening. He could care less where they went on their free period. He was far more concerned by whatever Devereux could possibly have to discuss with Malfoy. It had been at least two minutes and still Malfoy had not emerged from the classroom. Cutting off Ron mid-sentence, Harry abruptly asked, “Do you think Devereux could be a death eater?”
Potter narrowed his eyes at Devereux and said carelessly, “I’ve had literal death eaters as teachers, you’re going to have to try a lot harder than that if you want to scare me.”
Malfoy growled in annoyance and shoved away from Harry, inadvertently pressing his hand into Harry’s throat, hard. It hurt, quite a lot. Harry’s eyes watered and he coughed as Malfoy’s hand disappeared entirely. He took in gasping breaths, trying hard to regain his composure. A few feet away, Malfoy slammed his fist into the wall and it vanished, giving way to the room’s original shape. Malfoy, all of his composure gone, whipped around and shouted in Harry’s face, “Why are you so fucking stubborn? Why won’t you just give up?” He launched forward, reaching for Harry’s neck once more, but froze just before his hands could make contact.
Something sparkled in the teacher’s eyes before he said, “We’ll see about that. Detention, in my office tonight, five o’clock, do not make it a habit of being late.” He stepped aside and extended a hand away from Draco, as though he was welcoming him into the classroom, showing him the way, despite the fact that Draco had spent hours in this very classroom under a different professor for years. He pushed down his annoyance at the clearly baiting gesture and stalked to the nearest open seat, not giving the slightest bit of thought to whoever it was he was sitting next to.
in their seventh year together.
Malfoy stepped back and paced back and forth before Harry for several long minutes.
Even if they were gone, they’d want him to fight- to live- to escape. His magic felt a little stronger in that moment, like they were watching him, giving him strength from beyond the grave, offering up their own magic to him, for him to take and use.
Before he could dwell on it, the clock chimed, alerting him that he had one minute to get to his next lesson. Mopping the water from his face with the back of a hand, he strode from the bathroom and willed his hands to stop shaking. It worked… for the most part, and he looked as poised and put together as he had before- which wasn’t saying much. Even so, it was the best he could manage under the circumstances.
“No. You don’t.” She snapped back. “You know Potter gave information on every single death eater he met and that certainly includes you, and yet here you are, so he must have tried for lenience on your behalf.”
As soon as they reached the front gates, Malfoy blindfolded Harry. “Can’t have you memorizing the way out.” That was an odd thing for Malfoy to say. It implied that he wasn’t immediately going to be killed. When he’d been captured in the past, the death eaters had never taken care to blind him to his surroundings- they’d always been confident that it wouldn’t matter what Harry saw, as he’d be dead before he could make use of any of it. Did Malfoy intend to torture him a little before handing him over to Voldemort?
“Veritaserum.” Malfoy said evenly, slipping Harry’s glasses onto his face. Shit. Shit. Shit. He struggled fruitlessly against his bonds. He needed to get away, he couldn’t let Malfoy get any information out of him. “Oh calm down.” Malfoy snapped, rolling his eyes.
Harry was about to go when Professor Moore stopped him. “I expect better from the pair of you in the future. You would do well to work together, if you want any hope of being successful in my class.”
Even it felt different, foreign and invading. No, he was the invader now, the intruder in this school. He didn’t belong here. He should just turn around and join his father in Azkaban. Maybe they’d even have joining cells. Draco shook his head and trudged across the room to the corridor that led to the boy’s dorms. He didn’t bother with unpacking his trunk before he collapsed into his four poster bed and fell asleep- or tried to.
Malfoy backed off and ran a hand through his hair, disheveling it and making him look truly mad. He stared at Harry for a long moment before turning on his heel and practically running from the room.
“So we could destroy it.”
Ginny groaned, her eyes clouded and unfocused. Had she been blinded? Harry had no idea what he would do if she had lost her sight. A branch snapped and Harry’s face shot up, his gaze latching on the death eater before them. “Avada Kedavra!” He cast, but with the weaker wand, his spell was slow, and the death eater sidestepped it easily. A low, rumbling chuckle filled Harry’s ears as the death eater slashed his wand through the air, casting a silent disarming spell.
When Harry didn’t answer, Malfoy stepped forward and pressed a hand against her broken leg, bending it even further in the wrong direction. She shrieked in pain and continued sobbing even after he had let her go. “When I ask a question, you answer it.” Malfoy spat at Harry.
Harry laughed and resumed his intent peering out the window of the Hogwarts Express to the vast expanse of vibrant rolling hills beyond.
Some of the Gryffindors in the class muttered their agreement. The professor, who’s name Draco couldn’t remember, glanced around the room at them all before she stood and strode to the chalk board. “Listen up everyone. I understand that a lot has happened here in these past few years. And I know that some of you may not like each other all that much. But in this class, it doesn’t matter who you are, or what you’ve done. All that matters is garnering your potions abilities in my class. In the real world, you will have to work with people you don’t necessarily agree with. You will have to remain cordial with them no matter how much you want to curse them. This is practice for that.” So she did know then. The bloody witch had done it on purpose. “Professors Snape and Slughorn recognized the pair of you as their most gifted students, so this partnership should be well matched.”
