I always wanted to work some place flashy – where everyone wants to be.  I want to have fun.”
What a fine state he is in.
At Harry’s touch, Draco turns to him, expression forlorn.  Harry is once again struck by how attracted he is to this man.  Even one who looks as miserable as Draco.
“Boss hasn’t told you about my scrapbooking?  It's the highlight of his birthday every year.”  Clearwater asserts.
The nicest robes and suits he owns are kept in the way back of his walk-in closet.  He was occasionally required to don these whenever he was at a hearing or sitting in on a legislative session of the Wizengamot or going to a real to-do for a charity event like he was this evening.  It was the area of the closet he did not venture into much.  He considered it largely Kreacher’s domain.
“He is.”  Draco confirms, smiling softly.  He still found himself astonished to have a boyfriend.  Harry had filled his life in places he never knew he was lonely in.
“You might be embarrassed, but I’m not.”  Ron replies clearly, continuing to stare accusingly at Harry.  “I’m angry.”
“Malfoy.  Malfoy!”
Pansy merely huffs.  Handing him her baby like a guest at a party absently offering their host a bottle of wine as they enter.  Walking primly past him into the flat.  Draco is impressed by how put together she seems.  Particularly since he has a better understanding of the maintenance of children now.  Having been around Harry’s children for the last few months.  Pansy’s make up is impeccable, her clothing chic and comfortable in appearance.  She is a fuller figured woman now than at the end of their Hogwarts years.  Draco rather thought she was more fetching this way.
“Rosie and Gabby are chummy and Al plays with them too at school.  Besides, you like Tony.”  Draco points out.  “So be nice.”
“That’s not vague at all.”  Ron comments but he is ribbing him.
Pansy downs the last of her drink and waves over one of the rotating waiters with a tray of shot glasses and a bottle.
James is stock still beside him.  Hair a mess and looking pale.  Expression horrified.
“Outside.”  He repeats, tone brooking no argument.  “You can show him later.”
“They talked about him?”  Harry responds, surprised.
“Deserve is kinda tricky, Gin.”  Harry responds suddenly feeling a bit guilty.
“Am I okay?”  Harry repeats, sounding genuinely questioning.  Draco turns to his side and rubs at Harry's arm closest to him.  His boyfriend flexes underneath his ministrations.  “Fuuuuuck.”  The man moans, finally moving to unfold himself, but remaining on his stomach.
“I asked you.”  He redirects.
“How often have you met with this man?”
The boy digs in his pockets and pulls out a piece of folded up paper.  “I wanted to show you first before I showed Dad.”
“That’s what crups do.”  Luna informs them.  “They want to be with us.  They possess a great deal of loyalty toward wizarding people who take care of them.”
Grimmauld Place was far from the cozy, brightly lit home Jamie started life out in.  Jamie’s own first memories of it - when his parents were still married - were of him standing in the dingy, dark foyer while Dad ran up the stairs to get who knows what while he dutifully held his drooling, baby sister.  He remembers watching Dad skip the broken step that sagged in the middle with practiced ease.  The one Al was always afraid some creature lived underneath because the creak that issued when it was stepped on sounded like the recording of a banshee Uncle George let them listen to once.  Dad had laughed when he heard Al mumbling about creepy crawlies under the stairs.  He said the worst thing in a cupboard under the stairs was usually spiders.
The silence resounds in the chamber.  The council members look between each other, nodding and murmuring to their neighbors.  Harry hopes that will be the last of it.
“No.”  Draco denies at the same time.
Her expression is piercing as ever.  Making him feel like a first year in his first transfiguration class all over again.  “You have done wonderful work here.  I notice the fencing outside reflects your particular affinity with repurposing metals.  I am glad to see your skill has not waned.”
“How did I earn this?”  He asks delightedly, settling his hands on Draco’s hips.  Smirking, Draco leans forward to kiss him.  Hands coming up to frame Harry’s face as he does.  The kiss light but no less for that with the initial touch sending shock through him.  His boyfriend's tongue peeking out at the end as if to tease him.  Harry is very much on board that.  Having Draco close like this is a treat.  Any time touching Draco was.  It could take a while to coax him to this point.
Al collides with Harry first, loudly proclaiming, “Dad.”  Hugging Harry around the waist before glomming on to Draco’s other hand.  Molly approaches, patting down her work apron, smile hesitant around the edges.  Eyes on Draco.
They’re usually at Grimmauld instead.
Harry sighs.  “Cho Chang.”  He shares in a defeated tone.  Hermione and Ron already know anyways.  Merlin, the memory of her tears haunts him still.  What the hell was he thinking?  Poor girl.  He is glad she is doing well now.
“Where did you hear that name?”  Dad inquired from where he was in the herb section of their garden, glancing sharply at Jamie.
“Potter, why would you do that?!”  Malfoy yells indignantly walking backward to the other side of the room.  Still facing him the whole way.  Stance defensive with his shoulders hunched and hands fisted, but expression neutral.  “Why didn’t you knock?!”
“Yeah.  That’s when he lived far away.”  Albus says.  Never one to allow only his sister and brother to speak without his two knuts to add in.  “Mum lived with us then.”
.  He finds himself desperate.  It is so easy and
“Malfoy.”  His neighbor grunts out.  “Are you there?”
“Yes.”  Harry reassures, testing the bindings.  Pleased with the restriction he finds there.  “You remember the safety word?”
“Believe me.”  Harry asserts confidently.  “I’m the one - of the two of us - who has intentions.”
The holiday with Draco is a weeklong, self-indulgent trip.  He misses his children, but he does not miss being the authority figure at home and work.  Here he can just relax and enjoy being with his boyfriend.  When Draco is not there he sleeps in or follows his nose to the nearest delicious smelling aroma.  It has been a rare thing in his life to while away the hours leisurely doing whatever he wants.  Napping.  Beer tastings.  Shagging Draco.  Those are some of his favorite activities.  He barely even hurts here.  Maybe because he is on his feet less?  He's not sure.
Everything is altered when he opens his eyes.
“What's bothering you?”  Astoria asks gently.  Hazel eyes kind.
If he thought Harry, Astoria, and Pansy were overly concerned; Mother is something else entirely.  She sends him an assortment of care packages in the following days.  Boxes of his favorite chocolates, several new items for this season, and more things for Grimmauld.  Leave it to Mother to overcompensate by sending him material things.  Her letters are longer and more frequent too.
“I was able to meet up with Astoria.  You have fascinating taste in friends.”  He comments thinking also of his brief interaction with Pansy as well.
“I can’t always separate the two.”  He protests, irritation rising.  “I’ve been an auror for almost fifteen years.”
“What?”  Draco questions, perplexed.
“Hmmm?”
know I am seeing someone but not that it's you.  So I thought, the clinic is hosting a charity gala at the end of the week.  Astoria’s my plus one and I know you are on the list.  You could meet her and leave whenever so there would not be much pressure.”
“She will be a great Minister of Magic for Britain one day.”
“Malfoy, if that is you, you need to turn back.”  The curse-breaker advises him urgently, where he is bent over Draco.  “You’ll die if you don’t.  There isn’t a healer in this country who can help an animagus this injured in their creature form.  Your human body needs to heal.”
had been quite the ordeal for Draco.  He was certain it had been the result of James’ resentment of him.
good at French kissing so you’re welcome.”  Pansy defends, but then gives a swift look to her husband, frowning slightly.  “Sorry, darling.  I realize that was maybe a tad insensitive.”
A painfully tense silence envelopes the room at Draco’s outburst.  It is the first time Draco’s ever raised his voice during an argument Harry realizes dully and it echoes through him.
“Fuck, we’re good at that.”  Harry groans, feeling aftershocks from his spent cock to the rest of his body.  Nervous system lighting up like a thousand streaks of lightning.  Draco is trembling where he is holding himself up from collapsing on him.  Harry does what he can to guide his boyfriend to the side, petting at his face and shoulder where Draco loosens up enough to lie comfortably.  Catching his breath.
He feels a bit like a plaything during those first few visits.  Torn between Albus and Lily as they show him every nook and cranny of the house and engage him with their toys.  Draco acknowledges these actions.  Asks them questions about the objects that they indicate are important to them.  It is only polite after all.  The younger two are excited whenever he arrives.  Catching him up on their day as they tell him in their loud, little voices at the same time.  He has them take turns telling him after the few visits so he can parse out what they are saying.
“I’m going to teach you how to produce a Patronus if it’s the last thing I do.”  He states with a grin.
Draco forges ahead.  Determined to discover if his theory worked, reaching out his hand to see if he can get past the entry ward.  He tenses expecting the familiar barrier to push him back, but his arm continues into the air.
“Okay.”
were the only place people were shagging.  That’s a good one, Weasley.”  Tony says guffawing.  “I reckon Ravenclaws were a little more informed.  Our prefects always had a discussion with us once we hit third year, but it’d have been nice if that information came from an informed adult instead.  All of us were still fumbling around in the dark – so to speak.”
Dinner goes well enough.  There are no meltdowns from Lily or complaints from the boys about eating food they are unused to trying.  It probably helps that Olta was their cook tonight and both boys are careful to never offend the principal baker of sweets in the household.  Harry more or less goes about his evening routine puttering around his office and checking in on the children.  Giving Draco and his mother space to visit alone for a while until it is time for the children’s bedtime.
“Ginny
Astoria gives him a sad smile and pats his hand.  “He is absolutely gone on you, darling.  You should have seen the way he looked at you.  It was like a drowning man being given gillyweed the moment he laid eyes on you last night.”
It is wonderful.  Everything he does is wholly his choice.  Every goal achieved his own.
Jamie figures if they don’t talk to Bixby the elf can’t tell them
“It’s really all right.”  He redirects.  It will be.  He hopes.
“Simone!  Astoria!”  He exclaims, astounded.
Draco continues in his haughty tone as well, expression ornery and twirling his hand as if tipping an imaginary cap at his friend.  “Miss. Parkinson, have you met my boy Wilhelm?  He is six feet tall and will let you leave the house.”
Every point where their skin touches is heady for Harry.  He loves how Draco’s skin feels against his own.  The way Draco’s muscles react instinctively.  Flexing or shuddering at his touch.  Fine scars and hair sparking contrasting sensations along his body but especially in his own scarred leg and hip.  Loves the smell of them together as they begin to sweat and move more easily against one another.  He wants to lick every inch of his boyfriend’s skin.  Instead he focuses on kissing Draco.  Breathing deeply through his nose and leisurely entwining their tongues as they snog.
“You did give us quite the fright.”  Astoria begins softly.  Expression worried.  “I’m very glad you are okay, but please never scare me like that again.”
The most significant changes he has made thus far include a half pitch for quidditch on the back green of the estate.  It is two fingers directly in the face of his father who always thought a pitch – albeit a partial one – was too nouveau riche.  Draco even begins erecting what will be the garage instead of the former carriage house.  He is letting Harry store that motorbike of his on the estate and he does not want it in the stables forever.
It was a good divorce.
got scolded more.
“You didn’t get cockatrice pox as a child?”  Draco asks bewildered.  This was highly unusual.  It was almost a rite of passage for young witches and wizards.
“He is very proud of you.”  Draco finds himself saying.  James looks sharply at him at that, eyes narrowing.
The Académie des Praticiens has a long history of accepting
“We have several on-call solicitors at present on this floor or if you would rather -
“It really is idiotic, darling.  I’ve forgotten how moronic the British press can be.”  Astoria drawls.
It had been a long night.  He had been tracking a witch suspected of smuggling banned substances stolen from hags between Scotland and Ireland.  He and one of the aurors in his squad, Twysley, had apprehended her and secured a large amount of her supplies.  It was a significant win.  This was a case his squad had been working on and off for several months.
“C’mon, Dad.”  Jamie complains, lower lip pouting.  “I wanna show Uncle Ron when he gets here.”
“Oh, don’t concern yourself with that.  I have very long arms.”  Ron responds scathingly.
The second law he breaks is giving Malfoy a wand.
Draco’s bedroom is as neat as he is.  Harry’s bedroom isn't a mess, but everything in Draco’s is set so precisely.  He is certain if he moved the lamp an inch to the side his boyfriend would notice.  Draco folded down their blankets and is drawing the curtains shut with a flick of his wand when Harry goes to lay down.  Taking a deep breath of the lightly scented rose and sandalwood.  Draco’s apartment always smelled wonderful.
“G’night, Draco.”
Draco raises his head and once he sees Harry’s face barks out another laugh.  It is Harry’s turn to feel astonishment now, more than a bit flustered.
His daughter takes an exaggerated deep breath when she spots him.  Tears flowing steadily down her face.  “Dad-dd-y.”  She whines piteously.  “D-don’t leave me!  Tak-e meee with you.”
“Fine.”  Draco gives in, turning toward the boys.  “But you should know it won’t taste like the oatmeal you have at breakfast.  There is too much baking soda in it for that.”
Dad is quiet for a moment.  Long enough for Jamie to begin to feel unsure.  Maybe this was
“Not on your life.”  Draco retorts waspily, forcing himself not to cross his arms defensively.  Really.  Of course, he was not the only one who realized how domestic this scene was.
“Really?”  Draco questions, disbelieving.  He suspected, at best, Molly Weasley tolerated him for the children’s and Harry’s sake.  It seemed to him that most of the Weasleys did.  Whenever he was around there was still a certain amount of awkwardness.
“Really?”
Their cousin shuts their book firmly.  Huffing.  “Mummy says if you have questions you need to ask the right people.”
If it weren’t for the fact they were hiding Maud, they would have brought her with them when they return to the half pitch.  He feels bad to leave her alone.  She looked so doleful when they left.  Al placed the bacon he filched from breakfast on the bathmat and Jamie left her the quaffle toy they were playing with to appease their guilt.
Draco raises an eyebrow at that, internally cautioning himself to mind his tongue.  This was one of the few assignments they had to complete with a peer, and no one wanted either of them to be their partner.  They were stuck with each other.  Besides, his cuts were
Astoria gives him a long look.  It is more self-satisfied than Draco would like.
“He was important to me,” Draco eventually continues in a low tone.  “But there was as much uncertainty with him as anything else.  I didn’t have as many reservations with my mother.  She allowed me my eccentricities at times.”  His boyfriend explains.
“Oh,” He voices, thinking of the veg and salad dressing he would put together on a plate for snack sometimes with the sprogs.  “Right.”  He allows, feeling a bit like a fish out of water.
“Draco tried to smother his best instincts for a long time, but then - when it would benefit him most - he stopped.”  Luna explains in her far off daydreamy voice, expression thoughtful.  “I believe he must have discovered something irrevocably good within him.  I don’t know what.  He was punished for it – whatever it was – by the other death eaters.  Everyone knew he was on thin ice, and despite that, while I was a prisoner here, he used to smuggle us extra food and water.  Once he brought old Mr. Olivander medicine.  I was sad to hear they kept him in Azkaban before his trial finished.  I feared he might be killed there.  That’s why the memories I submitted to the ministry included those times Draco helped us – did you ever see them?”
“My deepest apologies, sirs,” The trembling voice of one of Narcissa’s house elves calls through the door.  “But guests are arriving, and Madam Malfoy has requested Mr. Draco’s presence.  She also has another concern that needs addressed.”
Then he bolts through the back door before Draco can even collect himself.
“I like that change too.”  Harry adds in.  Wondering at the state of his life that he and Pansy are on the same page about school schedules.  “My godson visits us a few weekends out of each semester.  I still miss him of course, but it’s better than only three breaks a year.  Hogwarts isn’t perfect, but at least the professors are doing more to address that now.”
“Shit, Al.”  Jamie swears running into the room with Al hot on his heels as the two of them run in circles searching for their missing pet.  Calling Maud’s name with increasing desperation as they go.  They look in the loo, under their beds, in the hamper, beside the wardrobe, inside the toy chest, and under Al’s pillow; but she’s nowhere to be found.
A children’s show plays on the tablet introducing a new song every few minutes for a dozing Lily as Draco works on the stack of papers before him.  The songs are mostly unfamiliar to him.  One or two he has overheard Lily sing since they met.  He rather enjoys the one about the twinkling little star.  All are a sharp contrast to the ones he was taught as a boy.  Most of those had darker themes – more tracking and hunting creatures.
“Severus?”  He calls, confused.  Scanning the area around him until he finds his old potions professor.  Standing several yards away, facing away from Draco and staring out the wide paned window down to the courtyard below.  Hands clasped tightly behind his robed back.
No matter how nicely he asks.
Draco snorts.  Really.  But he will not look a gift dragon in the mouth.  Draco flicks his wand again, sending a cleaning charm across them.  He knows Harry prefers real showers, but Draco would very much rather not fall asleep in drying spunk and lube.
He feels content then.
“You’ll make fun of me.”  Draco complains weakly, face soft in a way that feels like it’s just for him when he leans forward to knock their foreheads comfortingly together.
“That was when.  All those couples – those men.  I . . . I didn’t know it could be like that.  I think seeing it changed everything for me.  It was abstract before and I just didn’t know.”
Draco’s other arm slowly moves to the lip of the tub, turning himself so he can unfold his legs, facing Harry.  It's not the right time.  Harry understands this logically, but Draco looks attractive rumpled as he is in his underthings.  White blonde hair sticking out in all directions, short as it is.  He likes Draco messy; he thinks.  Looking Draco up and down from the soles of his long feet to the tips of his hair.
“That is not as romantic sounding as you think it is.”  Draco counters.  His smile indicates he isn’t put off though.  Harry pulls at Draco’s arm some more and is pleased when his appeal works.  The man sits back to take off his shirt and joggers.  Displaying more fair skin that glows in the partially lit room.  Tall body strong and compact.  Harry lifts his own hips where he is reclined and shoves down his pants.  Kicking them off the rest of the way with his feet.  The way he is propped makes it effortless for Draco to slide in between his legs.
Draco nods, expression wry.  “It was fun to find the perfect Yule log each year when I was young.  I think the children would like it.”  He shares as they finish wrapping the last of the presents they have gotten so far.
“Ugh.”  Weasley groans, making a face at Harry.  “You’re the worst.”
“It’ll be okay, sweetheart.”  Harry soothes, resting his hand on Draco’s back.  He ought to bristle at the term of endearment.  They really did not do that, but it is comforting in this instance so he allows it.
Most of the onlookers start loudly shouting and jeering, getting Harry’s attention.  The men led in chains into the chamber are ghosts of their former selves.  Draco looked bad the last few times Harry saw him, but now he seems decimated.  Hair limp, skin pale, and body thin.  A shadow.
There’s lots more trees and bushes over here making it denser.  Plenty of places for something to hide in this section of the gardens.  He feels a bit stupid after a while of investigating each crater and under each plant when they don’t find anything beyond a few mushrooms and patches of clover.  They’re a lot further from the pitch too by the time they examine the last hole for clues.
“Do you get along with his children?  His middle one is in Gabby’s class.  He talks a lot, but he seems sweet.”
“I’m sick.”  The boy states as if all the world has forsaken him.
The elf repeats, giving Mrs. Malfoy a significant look as she wrings her small hands.
“No, I’m not.”  He defends.  His veg is chopped satisfactorily thank you very much.  “They’re fine.  They’ll all taste the same.”
The next moment, Draco’s lips are on his.  Hot and demanding like they were an hour ago.  He opens his mouth letting his boyfriend gently lick in.  Sending a buzz of arousal through him at the connection.  He doubts that he will ever become fully used to kissing Draco.  The flutter of excitement and warmth that grows when they touch.  The happiness.  His boyfriend’s hands hold on tightly to his arms, embracing him.  Harry runs his fingers through his boyfriend’s hair.  Resting his palm at the back of Draco’s neck, feeling him shudder.
That earns a flash of a smile for their inside joke.  “You are.”  Draco returns appearing more sure.  “You are.”
“Papa
“Thank you for taking part in this study, Potter.”  Draco says, pulling Harry from his thoughts.  “You have provided so much data for us.  It will be fascinating to contrast this with our other volunteers.”
Harry doesn't need to ask to what Draco is referring to.  “It did."  He admits.  "I thought I planned for every eventuality.  I thought I could protect you, but I was wrong.  I was stupid.”
“All right, that’s okay.  We can do that.”  Harry agrees readily.  He can take care of Draco now and they can discuss this later.  He can do that for him.
“I can’t say I’m not hesitant, Harry.  There’s so much –” She cuts off, biting her lower lip.  Pausing for a moment.  “So much painful history.
“Just a guess.”
is pitiable.  I chose my lot for a long time, Harry.  I don’t feel sorry for myself about it.  Not anymore.  Regretful certainly, but not pitying.  I thought you knew that . . . I thought you understood.”
“Is that fair though?”  Harry protests.  Hermione raises an eyebrow at the exchange.
“You okay?”  His boyfriend checks, using his free hand to rub at Draco’s back while his fingers incrementally widen, twisting and, pressing in to tease his prostate.  The whole process has him panting, but it is good.  He wants this.
“Well that seems alright.”  Arthur says after a while, scratching at his chin, tone contemplative.  “It’s been years and he switched sides at the end, didn’t he?  And he finished his probation.  It was in the papers.  Shouldn’t that count for something?”  Arthur speculates glancing about the table with a small frown.
Lily gets her own room cause she’s a girl, but at least it’s the smallest of all the bedrooms.  Jamie can sorta see why Dad wanted to keep them nearby, Al and Lily
Father began to make noise about the potential that Draco had been cursed.  Arguing with healers about something Draco did not understand.  He remembers feeling embarrassed to have his father see him so poorly – like he was failing him.  Then there was his mother.  She always worried.  He felt badly about distressing her.  The strained expression on her face was enough to induce a further misplaced sense of guilt.
They split into two groups after breakfast, the boys head up to the playroom and Lily follows him to the library.  Laying on the loveseat in her Pygmy Puff patterned pajamas.  Tablet propped on her chest, looking down her nose at it.  Draco suspects she will go cross-eyed.  The tablet is attached to the internet.  Somehow?  Draco is not entirely certain how wi-fi works in practice.  He knows muggles can access it on their phones and through other electricity devices.  Harry has shown him how to access the internet on his office computer.  He does know the tablet remains in the library and the children are each limited to two hours on it per day.
“Bloody ferret in – which is bad enough – but my nephews and niece live here too!  They don’t have a say in being around
It helped to drop them off at bedtime, settling them into their cousins’ rooms.  Lily did not even fuss like he feared she might as he and Harry tucked her in while she literally nodded off.  James and Albus gave them sleepy hugs goodbye as Harry promised they would be back next week.  Reminding the boys again to behave for their aunt and uncle.
Draco glances down as if to remind himself what he is wearing, hand rising to fiddle with the buttons on his waistcoat.  “Thanks, er, you –
“You are right.”  Draco acknowledges, voice quiet but sure.  “I am sorry for how horrible I was to you and your family.  I can only ask for forgiveness for the things I have done although I know I do not deserve it.”
“I’m going to teach you how to produce a Patronus if it’s the last thing I do.”  Harry had told him, awestruck as he carded his fingers through Draco’s feathers that first time his boyfriend saw him transformed.  It had felt lovely to be caressed like that.  Astoria had given him a few pats on the head before in this form, but nothing so nice.
Harry sighs, wiping off his face with a cloth and putting away his razor.  “Yes, partly - though I still love your mum in the way friends love each other.  But your mum and I realized we wanted different things in a marriage – that can happen sometimes.”
“’Lo, Jamie.” Granddad greets cheerily.  His grandfather was quiet, but Jamie liked him anyways.  “How was your day, my boy?”
“Almost as if someone wants us to make that connection.”  Robards comments.  “Mock us for being too late once again.”  A theory that Harry too had been puzzling over more than once in recent weeks as their investigation into the smuggling network continued.  Hitting strange ends in leads and uncovering more disturbing crimes against creature folk and muggles.  They were staged seeming at times.  Indicating someone took the time to insult the aurors’ efforts.  He knew his own squad and others in their department were becoming increasingly frustrated by it.
“Maybe.”  Harry permits with a sigh and the creeping feeling that Ron’s right.  He
want kids – but I don’t want them to be wizarding children.”
“You don’t celebrate Christmas at all?”  He questions as they work in their sitting room to wrap the children’s presents.  It's midnight.  All gifting operations happened in the dead of night to avoid sneaky sprogs.  Harry had learned that lesson the hard way.  His children had a sixth sense for locating hidden presents.
Bloody idiot.
“Dunno.”  Jamie considers scratching the back of his neck.  “There’s nothing shiny round here.  It’s all just dirt and grass.  What else do you see?”
“Obviously.”  Harry cuts in joking, earning him a smack on the arm.
“You won’t hurt me, Draco.”  Harry had reassured, taking Draco in himself that first time.  Assuring in a way that made Draco trust him.  Draco’s mind narrowing down to the nerves in his cock and how fantastic that tight heat had felt.  How much he felt for this man.
“You think I’ve gone mad.  Living like this.”  Greg blunts suddenly, looking balefully at Draco.  Brow furrowed.  “I can see it on your face.”
“Play is a critical part of social-emotional development.”  Hermione expounds, eyes bright.  “Really, muggle psychology is much more advanced than our own.  They have done a lot more research on what helps children succeed.  For example, I always struggled with the tradition of having wizarding children separated from their parents for so long once they reach their secondary education.  That seems harmful to me.  If I wasn’t so eager to learn and be immersed in magic, my homesickness at Hogwarts would have been much worse.”
The manor – like many ancient wizarding places – was somewhat sentient and had begun to fester because of its inhabitants during the dark lord's occupation.  Mother had explained it best.  The estate had been confused about who to serve: his father or the dark lord.  Draco witnessed its gradual indifference to his father’s magic and the persistent defensiveness to its supposed new ruler.  A fact that did not go unnoticed by the dark lord.  All life fleeing from the once vibrant gardens and grounds.  The manor was slowly petrifying many months before aurors arrived to oust the last of the death eaters holed up in it.
The foot is not what woke him though it is the tap-tap tapping of a beak on the window.  Harry has the house warded against most owls and this owl is strange to him.  He has become familiar with some of the owls that fly by – many of them Weasley owned.  Draco does his best to extract himself from Harry’s hold without waking him or Lily to open the window.  It is not a success.  Harry groans groggily as Draco rises out of their bed.
“The shadow of Scotland?”
“Where do babies come from?”  Hugo asks the backyard at large.  Well, that is the effect of his question at least as he looks quizzically between Lily and his sister.
“Mother always said I laughed like the men on her side of the family.”  Draco adds as an after thought, pulling on his jacket.  “Said we all barked a bit when we start to really, properly laugh - like dogs.”
“I’m afraid so.”  Draco admits.  Glancing down at Harry.  “Did you give up on that death trap on two wheels?”
“Can you name this man?”
Harry considers this for a moment.  “How much of this is Hermione’s idea?”  He checks.
talk about this later.  Do you understand me?”
Potter is not trying to imitate him.  Two can play at that game.
“What?”  Harry questions, sensing a good story and cocking his head at his boyfriend.  “Why have I never heard this?”
“Good morning, boys.”  Draco drawls as Lily’s syrup covered hand grips his sleeve.  “Did you forget about knocking?”
“Thanks.”
“We saw them walking around the Grote Markt.”
He emits a soft laugh.  Surprised by her candor.  She was never particularly fond of him, but she had always been fair. “It is generous you even considered the possibility of our friendship.”
“I won’t.”  Harry promises a little offended.  He might sneak a small quiche if there is one.  Kreacher won't be able to tell.  Surely, not?
The first time Draco visits them at Grimmauld, Lily takes the blonde man solemnly by the hand and gives him a tour of the house.  Dad thought it was hilarious when Lily introduced Draco to all her dolls and stuffies.  Having him shake all the hands of the mayor of her toys - an old stuffie named Octie the Octopus.  Al asks Draco all sorts of questions while he shows Draco his room.  Draco seems to try to answer all of them thouroughly and even begins to ask Al some too that leave his brother stumped.
She turns, leaning over him.  Her hair falling forward as she whispers, “Maybe I can distract you for a while.”
He glances down at his body – the one he feels connected to – and sees no injury.  The reality of his situation hits him, stomach souring.  “How long has it been?”
“I did.”  Dad responds with a nod.  “I fought them in the second war with your mum and aunts and uncles and Teddy’s parents and all my friends.  My parents fought them too in the first war.  Tom Riddle killed them when I was a baby.”
me protecting you from my work.”   Harry argues.  Instinctively reaching out and clasping Draco by the forearm.  Wanting to draw him close.
is better.”  Harry argues.
from me.”
She is not the one who called him he realizes at once.  That voice had been masculine.
“Bah!”  He voices once, looking pleadingly over to his parents clearly hoping they can resolve the issue.
Draco could kiss the man right here.  He really could.  Instead he takes hold of Harry’s hand under the table.  He never should have worried.  It is Harry after all.  The man who is so accepting and loving it continually astonishes him.  His faith in his boyfriend has always been reconfirmed.
want to do that again before they leave, but not now.  Instead, Draco wants to propose something new.
I appreciate all the comments and kudos.  The world is weird and this rambling fic gives me joy.  I own nothing but plots.
The man before him sags.  Eyes searching out the other’s in the dim light of their room.  He watches him take a shaky breath, releasing the hand in his hair to grasp the top of the bureau for support.
They usually go for a jog on Sunday.
“I used to be a death eater, boys.”  Draco tells them gently, then looks over to Dad as if checking for permission.  Dad gives him a slight nod and Draco continues, frowning.  “I made many terrible decisions.  A good many people do not like me because of those choices, and they have that right.  You boys will probably hear more people say similar things.  For that, I am sorry.”
“Sorry, very sorry.”  The man – Rolf – apologizes congenially.
“Do you have kids?”  Lily asks around a bite of her food.
“Hardly.”  Draco denies mouth crooking in amusement.  “When I thought of you, I felt guilty for everything that happened during the war.  I figured you were happy though.”
“Mummies grow them in their bellies.”  Rosie answers him distractedly with a roll of her eyes beside her brother.
could have lost so much.  He can scarcely contemplate it without panic setting in.
This is a test.  He knows it is a test.  Potter will not keep him around if the children do not accept him.  It is with great relief that James finally speaks to him if only to go on about quidditch and his mother.  The first subject Draco can speak to with some authority.  As for the boy’s mother, he is less certain.  Draco tentatively calls the first meeting a success at the end of dinner.  Lily even spontaneously takes his hand.  Her little one a bit greasy from dinner, big brown eyes staring up at him, curious as they waited for the Potter boys to catch up with them.
“I’m glad you’re here too.”  Harry agrees, running his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.  “Everything is better with you here.”
“Let me handle this, Draco.”  Dad responds, pacing in front of them.    He’s walking with the cane today.  It was never good to upset Dad then.  He was crankier on those days.  Dad stops in front of Lily, leaning on the cane and staring down at her.  “Lily, is there something you’d like to tell me?”
“What?”  Harry plays clueless.  “Is there something you want?”
“Actually, Madam,” Dot cuts in using an undertone, clearly attempting to only speak to Mrs. Malfoy, but failing due to the high pitch of her voice.  “It is 5:32pm and we house elves have developed a rule to give Mr. Draco and Auror Potter a . . . grace period.  There is another forty minutes left by Frill’s estimate.”
“But so much of it is bad though, Harry.”  Draco says miserably.  “I’m trying so hard to be a good person.  I
The warmth of his skin, always warmer than his own, and the intensity of his green eyes engulfs him.
“Can I come?”  Jamie pleads.  “I don’t have school.  I’ll be good.”
His boyfriend takes another ragged breath.  “My skillset had always been more academic, so Severus encouraged the dark lord to make me one of his pet potioneers.  I was required to produce all sorts of nasty things for horrific purposes, and if one of my potions should fail or if I made some imaginary infraction, I was tortured.  Or worse I would be tasked with interrogations – which were also tests of my loyalty.”
bathing the crup.  When she shook her fur out, they got covered in muddy water.  The wall and sink did too, but that’s a problem for another day.
Dad says that Draco is fixing his family’s house too although no one lives there.  That it’s on a lot of land and even posher than what Draco is doing at Grimmauld.  Jamie doesn’t know why anyone would fix a house that no one is going to live in.  It seems like Draco might be staying at Grimmauld for good.  Even getting owls here now too.
It was starting to wear on him.
It is precisely as it was when he was last there.  Air oppressive.  The gloom of the room is barely touched by the lit standing candelabras.  High, arched ceilings gloomy as if darkened by storm clouds like the weather charm in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.  The long table made of black marble with silver veins running through it placed grandly in the middle.  Highbacked, elegant chairs on each side.  The remainder of the large hall an empty, eerie space with bloodstains forever inked into the dark wooden planks where Professor Burbage was consumed by Nagini.  The sound of bones crunching reverberates through the room when he takes a step, bringing him to a halt.
“Rarely.  We're friends of a sort.  I admire her.”
Harry nods to Draco to go on and turns to face his friend.  Hermione looks cross.  Hands on her hips as she frowns up at her husband.
Greg chuckles.  “She thinks it’s funny if a bit messy."  He answers.  "Doesn’t really appreciate it when feathers and waste are left behind.”
could do, former death eater, is the same.  You are here for the same purpose I am.  Do not apologize for it.  Prove your worth.”
Draco sighs in relief.  He feared it would be a dark object.
“Yes, I think so.”  Draco agrees, squeezing Harry’s hand on his arm.  “Let me say goodbye to the ladies.”
It is a regular epidemic.
Maybe Draco was there?
to the court.
“What is it?”
“And you have taken me home, Potter.”  Draco points out as an after thought, bemused.
“Who wants you to take Veritaserum?”  Harry asks again.  Gathering his wits about him.
Kreacher wants Draco’s attention too - which is weird.  Jamie’s never seen Kreacher fall all over himself to serve a visitor.  He’s seen Kreacher happy plenty of times.  Like on holidays when the house looks best or when important visitors come to meet Dad and he gets to bring out the nice tea set.  But Draco is like the Minister of Magic and Christmas all rolled into one.  Kreacher
“James, stop!”
“I imagine he would.”  Luna says conversationally.  “You two complement each other which is difficult to do – especially for two unusual people.  And Draco Malfoy is one of the strangest people I’ve ever known.”
Al points at his brother, laughing as Jamie leaves the sitting room in defeat.  They are having a playdate/dinner of sorts this afternoon.  It was meant to be more of a Potter-Granger-Weasley thing but then the Goldsteins got invited too.  That was all Draco’s idea.  At least the weather was finally nice out so hopefully they can do most of it in the backyard.
“I will.”  Harry retorts, leaning back.  He was a bit stiff today.  Work had involved one too many rough landings.  He had cushioned one jump with a charm, but his bad leg would be sore tomorrow.  Could feel it from the small twitches of muscle in his thigh.  “Do you still want to try cooking tonight?”
Draco stares at him.  Disbelieving.  “You had all those things when he first came – when you welcomed him into the manor – for months.  You knew what Bellatrix did to me – to the others.”  He says, years of resentment rushing to the forefront.  “Why didn’t you protect me?”
“Sometimes.”  Harry acknowledges.  “How did using the blender go?”
“Oh?  I rather thought the sleep draught we gave you was more potent than that.”
Jamie liked to make her happy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll do my best.”  He promises.  Meaning it.
“Excuse me?”
“You wish.”  Draco retorts with a fond roll of his eyes.  “It is a body oil though.”
“Who?”  Harry asks.  Wanting to get to the point.
money for our clinic, not lose it.”  Draco mutters giving him a slight smirk.
All and all he thinks he looks good.  His hair is a lost cause.  He gave up on it years ago.  But he did his best to comb out his nearly shoulder length hair.  Tying it loosely back so it appears a little orderly – or that he had at least tried.  Thick, springy jet-black hair still trying to do what it pleases.  He tries to imagine what Draco will think.  Harry fills out his robes much more nicely than he did as an adolescent.  He will never be more than average height, but he has wider shoulders than he could have hoped for as a teenager.  His tan skin looks good against the green of his robes, making the earthier undertones stand out.  Luna had helped him buy these a few years ago.  Her tastes tended toward the bizarre, but she had not steered him wrong yet.
Whatever it is, it will mean more work for them.  Good work.
“Go relax in your room, Kreacher.”  Potter tells him with a wave.  “We don’t need your help tonight.  We can serve ourselves.”
It does not matter what Draco does that day whether he works at the clinic or the manor, he ends it with Harry.  There is something lovely about having people to be around once done with the day’s activities.  They have only been dating for several months.  He reminds himself of that sometimes when he finds himself unsure of his place in Harry’s life.
Draco turns to look at her.  Harry watches his boyfriend’s grey eyes study Hermione, perfectly still and up-right in his seat.  The man reminded Harry of a marble statue.  Immovable.
“Yes, boss.”
Draco returns the statement with a knowing look.
“Do you work with Dad?”  Al asks between bites of his food, getting grease on his glasses when he adjusts them.  “Are you an auror?”
Draco turns away slightly, laying so that he is facing the bedroom ceiling though still tucked into Harry’s side.  His boyfriend isn’t ignoring him.  He can read Draco well enough now to know the man is thinking.  Harry shifts his head to rest against his boyfriend’s shoulder.
“Harry, I –
His friend gives him a wane smile but shakes his head.  “I’m a hard worker, and I'll always be loyal to her – that’s true enough – but I’m afraid of what our world might do to her.”  The man shares, expression worried.
Harry raises an eyebrow at the other man.  Smile crooking on his face.  “What about it other than it’s bloody fantastic?!  You’re magnificent.”  He affirms.
Dad quirked his mouth in a frown.  “Regulus was my godfather Sirius’ younger brother.  He grew up in this house and Kreacher took care of him.  He died in the first war.”
Simone nods emphatically at that causing his companions to laugh.  “The club manager would have fired him otherwise.”
He considers it.  “I suppose not.”  He accedes observing Draco lift his glass and take a sip.
“I appreciate you trying here, Ron, but we don’t have to talk about Draco if you don’t want.”  He offers, giving his friend an out if this is too much.
“Yeah.”  Lily muffles through her hands.
Draco nods.  “He talks about her frequently, but that might also be because he loves quidditch and she is a coach.”  He explains.  James was mad for quidditch.  The few conversations they did have typically focused on that very subject.  He sometimes wondered if James loved the sport so much because it made him feel connected to his mother.
He clears his throat.  "Can’t you see a little one with your wife’s smile and spirit shaking up the wizarding world?  The future is bright.”
“But Draco’s like a teacher though.”  Jamie complains.  “He doesn’t
Oh no.
“Very good.”
Pale and angular as ever, Malfoy appeared to have grown into his face and lean frame, filling out proportional shoulders to a thin waist.  Handsome face professionally neutral gazing at Harry with polite interest.  It occurs to him that Malfoy no longer resembled his father as strongly now as the he had before the war.  A sneer no longer permanently in place, watching over everything with condescending superiority.
“Where are the others?”  He asks.
The man clears his throat, mouth crooking slightly upward.  “I suppose you did.”
He is certain people can be bored to death.
The whole room tilts sideways, knocking him sharply to his hands and knees.  Pain jolting up his extremities down to the marrow of his bones.  It is like being dunked into an freezing lake.  It takes his breath away and makes him ache in waves of sensation.  Pale, icy hands violently grab his neck, lifting him upwards as his knees scrape against the floor.  Nails slice into the skin on his neck.  Hands hold him exactly in place, frozen to the spot.
“I’m sorry, mate.  All I told them was I didn't trust Malfoy.  I did not accuse him of tampering with your cases.  I didn’t make the complaint either.”
Christmas was a hectic time of year for him.  Since Teddy's birth, he'd done his utmost to make every Christmas special.  This year adds Draco into the mix.  Harry has no clue what to get his boyfriend, but he knows that he wants their first Christmas together as a couple to be special.  There is a slight issue though.  Draco doesn't really celebrate Christmas.  He celebrates Yule.
Harry grins slowly, leaning in to kiss him.  There is a bit of a bite to it.  Leaving Draco feeling flustered.  “You’ll be my live-in boyfriend.”
In the ensuing years of improved treatments, he was able to largely discontinue use of the cane.  Unfortunately, it had become necessary to replace important things like his femur every other year or so once the bone and surrounding tissues became too weak.  That, along with a small vial of his prescribed potion every morning delaying the next inevitable bone transfiguration procedure, allowed him the use of his leg.  Mostly.  The blood curse that was imbedded in the explosion that killed two other aurors - including one of his own sergeants who’d been a trainee of his - kept trying to tear Harry’s limb apart where the protego he had cast had failed to protect him.
Draco shakes his head, but his eyes are mirthful.  “Idiot.”
One stone, two birds.
“He is recovering too, Draco.”  Astoria advises him.  Lounging with him in his and Harry’s small sitting room in their suite.  “He obviously takes your safety very seriously and seeing you so hurt was terrible for him – especially since he was unable to get to you during most of the time you were trapped in there.”
good you didn’t become a healer.  Your bedside manner is awful.”  He retorts, going for cheek in his defense.  He's glad his dark skin hides most embarrassment.  It would have been difficult to hide it otherwise in this case.  He is surprised at himself though.  Typically, he is better at guarding his reactions away from friends and family.
The man looks up at Harry’s entrance.  Grey eyes studying him as Harry sets the groceries on the counter.  “Can you cut my hair?”  He asks and Harry isn’t fool enough to reject an olive branch when he sees one.
Harry guffaws, feeling like the kneazle who caught the knarl.  It’s fucking fantastic.  He feels sure again.  Surer anyways, and bloody hell, Draco is beautiful like this.  Face all desperate and wanting.  Grey eyes dilated and lips pink from biting them.  “You love me.  You love me so much you’re gonna fuck me after this.”
“I might.  Let me think on it.”  Draco replies.  There were still some contacts he had in the dark antiquities world who he would like to consult with about another possible course of action.  He may work more in potions now but his education in dark objects was often useful.
It is nice of Potter to care – to even think of him.  They have been meeting up casually since Potter began participating in his experimental treatment at work.  Draco would never admit it aloud, but their meetings were often the highlight of his day.  He had few friends in Britain.  Pansy was married and busy with her children and Greg spent most of his time working at his wife’s bakery.
Draco’s expression does something complicated.  “It was terrible.”  The man finally answers, brow furrowing and sounding sad.  “But you knew that.  What’s brought this on – the manor opening?”
The Weasley family knows about them.  Ron Weasley made sure of that announcement following the charity gala.  A few more of Draco’s friends are aware now too.  He wrote to his mother weeks ago informing her he was seeing a male someone very seriously.  Someone, he wrote, that she might not forgive him for caring about.  Her letter back had been more supportive than he could have anticipated.  Encouraging him to be happy of all things.
Perhaps this is a usual occurrence?  Potter did not seem the type to keep a house elf.  Always very self-sufficient.  The older house elves Draco grew up around took great pride in serving his parents’ guests.  It is possible that not being allowed to serve Draco is upsetting the creature.
There is a silence.  A tense one.
The adults come in chatting and sit down.  His aunt and uncle sit on one sofa and Draco and Dad on the other.  Draco and Aunt Hermione are in a boring conversation about pewter caldrons.  Blah.  Uncle Ron looks ill.  Jamie wonders if dinner didn't agree with him.  That's what Nan would say.
“Him?”  Molly repeats, placing a hand to her chest.
There is a pause.  The man sighs.  “I don’t know if
Dad and Draco look at each other for a long moment.  Dad starts to chuckle and runs a hand distractedly through his messy hair, expression baffled even Draco seems affected.
“Auror Potter.”  He hears a high feminine voice call.  Harry turns but it is not one of the women he was hoping to see.  Unfortunately, it is Pansy Parkinson and he must be civil with her.  For his own reasons, Draco remained friendly with the woman.
“I saw the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio.”  Draco tells him quietly, over his drink.  “I don’t think they saw me.  They were speaking with the Thomases at the time.  Are you certain about tonight?  You can still change your mind.  I would understand.”
Draco notices most of the Weasleys glancing down toward the elongated end of the table where the children are.  Amused expressions forming before turning back to their conversations which briefly lulled.  Harry chuckles from his spot beside him.
It isn’t
The last night he’s there they eat crunchy pasta that Malfoy made with a salad that Harry threw together.  It is the most comfortable they have been with each other he thinks.  There is an easier expression on the other man’s face anyway as they set the table.
How is it this man continues to steal his breath away?
“I-I’m glad it helped her.”  Draco responds appearing taken aback, shaking Doge’s hand.
“My job is to learn all I can about different medicinal items and create new potions to help people if they’re sick or hurt.”  Draco explains.  “It can be challenging – like a puzzle.”  He ends with a look toward Al.
"You’re so handsome – beautiful."  His boyfriend continues, leaning further back on the counter like he needs the support.  He can see the man's shoulders working in the mirror.  "Circe, I love your body.  You’re so strong.  Love your hair.  Love
and everything.
It starts with checking in on Draco more than once a month.  That was the original plan for the first year at any rate.  He tells himself that he’s just being cautious.  That Draco needs the support adjusting to living with minimal magic near muggles.  That he needs the supervision.
“I was going to say friendly.”  Draco says with a considering expression.  “I didn't expect that from your coworkers – at least not towards me.”
“How did they get up there?”
Harry has never felt this.  This constant flow of want.  It is beyond infatuation, love, and desire to be near Draco.  Moving toward each other with equal tenderness.  Laughing lightly again when his boyfriend teases him by nipping at his ear before sliding down Harry’s body.
“That’s true.”  Draco allows.  He had lately been hoping Mother would find something more to do with herself than write letters to Father and pour endlessly over wedding preparations.  It seemed sad to him.  A waste.  “Okay.”  He agrees with a nod.  Not entirely certain of what he is doing, but it feels good to say aloud.  It felt right.
Harry considers his boyfriend.  Draco is still fully dressed in a smart navy suit sans his cloak jacket.  Halfway through a glass of wine.  Fidgeting with the stem.  His hesitant movements making him rethink their plan.
wants to hear it.”
His boyfriend had been beside himself getting everything ready.  Dort, the house elf in charge of the manor, was often found overseeing the final touches to their plans.   The elf was incredibly helpful.  Always certain in how they should proceed.  Harry vastly preferred the elf and his good-natured advice over Narcissa’s.  Who, as far as he could tell, was bewildered at Draco’s plan to open the manor to
“Yes.”
“Sorry for making you cry, ‘Mione.”
“Thank you.”  Malfoy acknowledges, raising a hand to pull lightly at the loose ends of his hair.  Expression guarded.
There's another pause.  He hopes Draco will hear him.
That makes Jamie scratch his head.  “Who’re the right people?”  He sure won’t ask Gabby’s nan or Liam’s parents.
“Jamie, what’re we gonna do?”  Al asks desperately.  “We can’t keep a crup
"It is true - as others have attested - that I fought for Hogwarts in the end.  If that is my one good act in this life, then so be it.  Let it stand on its own.  I apologize for the rest.  Every hateful, self-centered act that I am pleading guilty to today.  The only thing I beg this court for . . . is that my one moral act not be weighed against my many gross misdeeds.  I am not fit for even a fraction of mercy.  I engaged in every one of my crimes knowingly and with full intent to harm others to save myself.  I am a coward and . . . I deserve whatever punishment this council deems fit.”  He rasps out.
“Circe, Harry, shut up!”  Draco retorts with a roll of his eyes, but the smile he has on thrills Harry to no end.
“Naturally.”  Draco retorts with a flourish of his hand.
“Weasley,” Draco drawls, “Are you maybe . . . possibly . . . being a tad homophobic?”  He suggests, trailing off at the end.
All three children itch and scratch.  They are feverish and tired and cranky.  James’ spots are huge for some reason which concerns Draco enough to fire-call a coworker whose expertise is in pediatric healing.  It is typical for wizarding children to contract this pox at some point in their childhood, but the spots are not much more than the size of peas.  James’ are the size of grapes.
“I participate in gift giving,” Draco explains, rotating his wand to finish a bow on Al’s gift.  “Whether it is for Christmas or Hanukkah.  There is a lot of overlap between those holidays and Yule.  Most pureblood families celebrate Yule along with one of the other major winter holidays.  The Malfoys only celebrated Yule, but my mother’s family indulged in Christmas on occasion.  As a boy, we did most of our gift giving on the winter solstice and the twelve days after were typically spent as a family.”
“I know it’s silly.”  She blubbers, wiping at her eyes with the dry kitchen towel over her shoulder.  “You’re divorced.  I know that, of course you’re moving on.  Why wouldn’t you?”
“I’m the one who’s sorry.”  He apologizes, taking another step forward.  “I shouldn’t have brought it up then and the way I did.  I pushed you to talk when you clearly didn’t want to and I didn’t explain myself properly either.  It wasn’t my proudest moment.”
Instead, something prods at him to follow the crup despite this logic.  The worrying part of himself that cannot leave well enough alone.  Why would Maud not be with one of the boys?  She never left their side if any of them could help it.
He loves Lucius because he is his father.  The same one who taught him to ride brooms and Abraxan horses with equal abandon.  A father he admired and wanted to be like in every way.  It was what he was
Albus is tearful when Draco returns to the master bath.  Frown firmly in place and brow furrowed.  He is wrapped in one of their fluffy towels.  Smelling much better but still unhappy.
“It’s not fair.”  Harry complains as neither of them becomes the clear winner.  His competitive streak getting pouty.  “You know too many Slytherins and foreign people.”
“Why did you survive?  When so many of our brethren were slaughtered?  Why you?  You were the weakest of us – not even fit to clean your aunt’s boots.
“Father hated it.  Said it was queer to hide in them.  I didn’t know what he meant for the longest time, not until one of the older Rosier boys was talking about faggots going to tearooms and the like.”
The three of them gather off to the side of the room.  Ron remains seated.
“Is there something the matter?”  Mrs. Malfoy questions frowning down at the elf.
“It . . . your name came up.”
“Holy shit, she’s right.”  Harry says, feeling stunned.  “Draco, you
Harry licks his lips.  “But you put on such a pretty show.”  He croons.
“Stop that.”  He remarks, attempting to wave her off.
“Weasley and Granger have a lovely home.
He does not often frequent wizarding pubs.  For one, people he doesn't care to speak to talk to him.  For another, Draco is reticent to join him.  Today he is meeting Ron in Yorkshire at a pub called Farcical Fernley’s a located at the center of the magical community that resides there.  It is nice enough.  There is minimal fuss as he takes a seat with his back to the wall at an available table and orders a drink and some chips.  Subtlety observing the other patrons.
Draco looks embarrassed.  Ears growing pink.  “He was always . . . polite.”
All he wanted to do was dictate his report, alone in his office, and call it a day.
As a rule, he does not like to be woken up in the middle of the night.  He is having a lovely dream about getting a shipment of rare Polynesian mandrakes when suddenly Harry is turning on the bedside lamp.  The first thing his eyes behold is a green-faced seven-year-old boy leaning directly over him.  Face contorted and paler than usual.
“Potter.”  Pansy acknowledges the greeting loftily.
He does remember Ginny standing at the door yelling at him for being an idiot and to come inside while he kicked the starter until the bike roared to life.  Of course, this was late in the evening and quite dark out.  He didn't even manage flight which was fortunate all things considered.  Hitting the gas and driving directly into the solid trunk of a tree at the end of their drive.  He does not remember that part though.  Only blackness and then waking on the ground.  A slick substance coating his face which he figured out was blood after he spat some of it out.
The man has taken to learning how to cook.  Already having gone through a handful of cookbooks by the time he’s been there six months.  Harry’s glad.  He wondered how Draco would keep busy.  Draco’s first few efforts aren’t the best, but they are the building blocks to some real talent.  He finds himself looking forward to their time together.  Enjoying Draco’s experiments in the kitchen.  He is the primary taste tester for most of the man's creations.
Hermione shifts on her feet.  Expression complicated.  Ron walks up to where they stand.  Making careful eye contact with Harry and Draco before sharing a long look with his wife.  Draco is stock still beside Harry.
“I know.”  He intones.  As much as he loves his former in-laws, it's strange to imagine sharing with them that he's dating again.  The idea of them learning he is dating Draco is uncomfortable.  There were just so many uncertainties.  He liked to think Molly and Arthur will come around to the idea once they see how Draco is now.  How happy he makes him.  Harry just hopes he isn't kidding himself.
Malfoy is there.  Stretched out supinely beside them, raising one elegant white blonde eyebrow.  Grey eyes twinkling in a way that makes Harry's stomach swoop.
“Lily?”  He repeats, shocked at the revelation.  “Harry’s mother?”
He transfigures the tarp to carry one of the large broken off pieces and the smaller parts.  Ultimately ending up levitating the front end partially, rolling it along on the back tire through the backyard to the front of the cottage.  He has the fleeting thought to take it down to the Burrow, but he expects Ginny would only mock him further if he did that.  He eventually accepts defeat and shrinks down the main parts of the motorbike.
“I suppose, but only the one.”  He allows as the boys immediately high-five and the crup yips before they scramble away.  “And you only play with it outside.”  He calls out.  “I know you hear me, James.”
“Would I really ruin bacon, Ron?”  Harry exclaims, outraged.  “Bacon!  My third-favorite breakfast food?”
Keep himself occupied.
“What is a crudité?”  He whispers to Draco under his breath.  The waiter just took their drink order and didn't seem too impressed by Harry’s request for the house red wine.  Which is an eminently reasonable request in his opinion.  He got a little uncertain when the wine lists were longer than his children’s bedtime stories.  There were too many choices and he was never much of a wine person.  Draco had had to save the day by ordering drinks for them.
Harry frowns, trying to find the right words for his son to understand.  “Mummy can tell you what she wanted.  I – well – I figured I wanted to be married to someone who knows me better than almost anyone.  Someone who knows I make mistakes and loves me despite them.  Someone who tries to be kind and wants to be with each other always – even when we’re really,
Rolf’s face shifts to one of interest as he takes in the room too.  “I see a crup’s found you.”  He states with a grin gesturing toward Maud who yips once in return.
particular area, does it, Auror Potter?”
But the best part about Draco’s flat is Olta.  She always bakes them the yummiest desserts.  Better than Nan’s even.  It’s fun to sit on the stools at the kitchen island and watch her bake as she speaks to them in her heavy accent.  Ukranian, they learn.  Giving them sweets samples as she works.  Olta thought it was bizarre Dad liked to cook – or that he could.  She watched in amazement when Dad showed Draco how to make toasties one time.
“To question him?”  Harry asks directly, beginning to feel cross.  He doesn't lose his temper, but he can feel the tension in his body begin to bleed through his posture.  He and Robards stare at each other.  It isn’t animosity exactly – more a stalemate.
“As always, the question we should ask ourselves is what do children
“I’ll see you tomorrow, right?”  Harry asks Draco over the din.  Draco nods, but his brow is furrowed.  Harry spies Astoria headed their way.  Expression guarded again, and people looking confused in her wake.  As if she just suddenly ducked out of conversation.  He wonders what they look like to her right now.  He ducks in closer to whisper in Draco’s ear, putting a hand on his shoulder.  “Their reactions don’t change my feelings about you.”
Dad takes a deep breath.  “Draco did bad things like the boy, Jamie.  Cruel things he regrets because he started thinking for himself and changed.  Uncle Ron doesn’t want to forgive him for all those things.  He doesn’t have to.  People don’t always forgive.”
This is the primary gift Harry gives Draco.  They will celebrate Yule this year together.  Him, Draco, and the children.  He can surely manage a Yule log.  He hopes so at any rate as he bundles the children in their warmest winter coats.  Kreacher doling out the gloves and hats for all of them.  Draco even seems excited at the prospect.  Grey eyes bright as they take the children to the manor for the first time.
“Life.”  Astoria replies.  Holding his gaze.  “Is this all there is?”  She waves a hand around them.  They are supposed to be courting, but all they have done is talk.  Draco had so missed having a proper friend.  Pansy and Goyle had been barred from seeing him.  Pansy by her parents and Goyle by his probationary officer.  Everyone else had fled the country or was dead.
“He’s not my dad.”  James replies sharply, sounding cross.  “Draco’s just Dad’s boyfriend who lives with us.”
“Well, this is cozy.”  He comments trying to lighten the mood.  “Thanks for letting me in.”
exactly I was asking and then everything got side-tracked and we never got back to it.”
“I’ve been walking around London with you for months just trying to get you to smile at me.  Of course, I won’t get bored.  I’ve never been bored of you, Draco.”  Potter soothes, mouth wry.
After dinner, Jamie agrees to play hide and seek with them.  Hugo and Lily are it right now.  They have to be a team because they're so bad at finding the rest of them when it's just one of them alone.  Jamie sneaks into the sitting room and hides in the alcove behind the tall, broken grandfather clock Dad stored books in.  He’s never hid there before.  They won't find him here.
“We were cheap though.”  Astoria retorts, wine glass in hand as she gestures toward the three of them.  “We lived in a hole in the wall that we literally magically expanded without the landlady none-the-wiser.  If we had not brought in Simone as a flatmate, we would have gone back to Britain with our tail between our legs.”
“You can when it suits you.”  Draco throws out with a dirty look.
“Yes, Harry.”  Draco answers with an exhausted air, giving him a sharp look.  “That.”
Students at Hogwarts got a couple weekends out of each semester to visit their families.  This weekend Teddy is coming to theirs.  His grandmother, Andromeda, was out of town for some work thing anyways.  Teddy usually spent one of his weekends and part of any holiday with them since Dad was his godfather.
“Dad?”
“I know it, but it’s been ages since I’ve read the Prophet.  To be honest, I am surprised you have a subscription.”  Draco responds conversationally, folding the paper and setting it down.  “What does your wife think of our owl delivery system?”
Jamie watches Draco clasp his hands in front of him, interlocking his fingers.  That was never a good sign.  He and Al exchange a wary glance.  Draco was nice to them,
Harry swallows dryly at that, watching Draco’s hand drifts down the front of his waistcoat.  Buttons opening in his wake.  The soft sound of metal catching.  Close enough now that he can see his boyfriend’s chest rise and fall with his breathing.  The scent of his cologne.  Heady like a forest after the rain.
It takes a while, and he does his best not to laugh especially when it is so obvious Malfoy is
Draco hit the brakes sometimes.  Harry was not always sure why.
Later that night when Dad tucks them in, Jamie asks about what the adults were discussing.
“He shouldn't have had to.”
the bar, Pans, not on it with you.”
He absolutely
“What’s it like – between you two?”  Pansy questions after a moment.  Expression inquisitive.  Draco is fleetingly reminded of a similar conversation between them.  Years ago now, where he asked her the same about seeing Tony.
Harry is here in case it all goes horribly wrong.
“I think I need to educate you about kink-shaming, Draco.”  Harry tells him fake seriously, sighing dramatically which is ridiculous.  Draco finds himself laughing so hard at that his face hurts.
“Love you.”  Harry murmurs, peppering kisses over Draco’s torso moving upward to his neck.  Savoring the feeling of his boyfriend’s shuddering in his wake.  Chest rising and falling in quick succession.  Clearly very affected by the attention.
“What was missing?”
He turns his head to look at Draco, expression pleased.  “You did – you did a good job.”  Harry tells him, patting him clumsily on the shoulder with his freed arm.
see you with me, there would be a write up in the paper with people asking all sorts of
They’re supposed to knock on the door to Dad and Draco’s room.  But it’s already ajar by the time him and Al get there.  They sneak quietly into the little sitting room, tiptoeing as they go.  Al hanging onto him so he doesn’t trip.
“Who’s Regulus?”  Jamie asked later while he and Dad were weeding in the garden.  It was a good idea to ask questions when they were in the garden.  Most of the time it was just him and Dad who bothered with it.  Jamie usually helped him do the weeding and pick whatever they might need for dinner.
It is only them.
“Hmmm, of course . . .”  Draco agrees, head falling back so Harry can gaze at the long line of his boyfriend’s neck.  Hand teasing the head of his cock as the other moves to play with his nipple.  “Always want you.”
mum helps coach the Harpies and she used to play for them.”  Jamie informs him.  “We
That is how he and Al wind up wrapping the crup in Jamie’s torn shirt and place her in Al’s bag to smuggle her into the manor.  Because surely, if the crup was with them, she couldn’t cause any more damage.  Then they could keep her, right?
He has told the children about the manor.  Harry knows Draco has too.  That it is a big house on a big piece of land.  That Draco has been working very hard at fixing it because it has been in his family for a long, long time.  Apparently, none of that prepared them properly.  The children’s eyes widen comically in amazement when they exit the ridiculously huge fireplace into the main foyer.
“I’m sorry, Draco -
“Don’t say that.”  Potter chides.  “I’m glad you told me.”
“Let me see your leg.”
“For whatever my promises are worth - I do.”
“You make him happy, you know.”  Ginevra states with surety.  “I’m glad you’re with him.  You're obviously made for each other.”
“That’s the idea, love.”
“Hyperion.”  His lab partner proclaims a few yards behind Draco.  Prompting him to pivot to face his peer once again.
First off - it’s completely unfair that Dad and Draco made him share a room with Al at the manor.  The whole place has about a dozen bedrooms and there are several in the
The voice reverberates around them.  Shaking the frames of the solarium violently and causing the glass to shudder even the floor seems to shake.
“You’re the one who wants transparency here, Draco.”  Harry retorts, off track from his original purpose and unable to restrain the frustration in his voice.  “That’s what this whole historical tour thing is for, right?  I know you’re not running them – I get that – but you’re already volunteering a lot of information.  So why can’t I ask you more about this?”
“Oh, most definitely.”  Astoria replies smoothly to her friend, looping her arm with Harry’s and looking up at him with a wicked grin.  “Shall we go have a look from the balcony, Auror Potter?  I haven't been up there yet.  It is always good to get perspective, no?”
It seems like Harry wants to laugh at that by the way his eyebrows shoot up and the corner of his mouth crooks.  Expression an unusual combination of incredulous and passionate.  The other man shakes his head.  “No, here, let me.”  He says, taking Draco’s hand and guiding it down where they are connected.  “I’m just past that ring of muscle there.  That’s what might hurt.  Are you sure I don’t need to pull out?  Maybe we need to stretch you more?”
“How is the move in going?”  Hermione asks, propping her socked feet on her footstool and sipping at her spiked cup of cider.
Dad did
technically own the manor, Mother.”  Draco reminds Narcissa.  “Come and go as you please.  You don't need my permission.”
After a pregnant pause, Harry breaks into a jig beside him.  “Take that, you bloody bitch!”  His boyfriend shouts gleefully, spinning around.  Delight contagious, causing Draco to grin in response.  Pleased he can make Harry so happy.
“Draco,” Harry speaks his name slowly, walking toward him and tossing the apple core into the trash can.  “They all think you live here anyways.”
“Because
“It could have been much worse.”  Pansy replies with a neat little shrug.  “We at least could date without chaperones.  I know for a fact my mother was never alone in a room with a man she wasn't related to until her wedding night.”  She says with a shudder.
They do eventually make their way out of the VIP section after a few more drinks.  Harry would have been content to spend the whole time there.  Less crowded as it was.  It seems like the general section and dance floor has become even denser in their absence.  The bass is louder as they descend the stairs.  Lighting changing rhythmically in patterns adding to the lively party mood.  Designs on the wall moving with it.
“You?”  He grits out, checking.
He kisses Molly’s cheek.  Then, facing the table – particularly Ron – nods to them and goes to collect his children.  Hopefully, they would be done with their meal.
“Can’t it be both?”  He submits.
“What?!”  Harry exclaims, sitting up as Draco backs off.  Looking paler than normal which in his case meant the man was white as a sheet.  Body language stiff.  Expression flickering between blankness and anxiety.  It puts Harry on edge to see Draco so distressed.
The boys are playfully hanging upside down from the interconnected metal dome.  Black hair standing on end.  Quite over their punishment from earlier in the day – for now.  Other muggle children are doing the same or clambering to the top.  Lily chooses a peeling bouncy horse to play on.  The pigtails Draco put in her hair this morning, flapping in the wind.  The great big smile on her face reminds him of Harry.  All cheek.
There is a lot going on around the boys and it's fun to explore Jamie's POV on things.  How much he picks up on and what he doesn't.  This chapter also marks how much change there has been in the Potter family dynamic compared to when Draco first babysat the kids for half a day in a previous chapter.  And Luna!  Sweet Luna.  She'll be in the next chapter too!
The solicitor he was assigned was able to convince the council to hear his piece.  Draco does not remember all of it.  Once he started, he wanted it all out.  The courtroom was deathly silent after the initial din.  Draco’s voice was as raw as his wrists at the end of it.  Breaking and creaking from the disuse.  He never bothered to look at the crowd in the court that day.  The jeers when he entered the domed courtroom were not encouraging.  The few times he glanced up was to gaze defeatedly at the new Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt and the interim head of the DMLE.
Mrs. Malfoy sighs but says no more as she raises her teacup to take a sip.
It is not a very flattering photo.  Draco feels comfortable admitting that.  He looks okay physically, but he does not seem like he is in charge.  Lily is on his hip, eating straight from the little cup in her hand.  Chocolate smeared all over her face.  He is wiping at it with a paper serviette.  The boys are using their spoons to catapult the remains of their dessert at each other.  Bits of bread and butter pudding in James’ hair and Albus’ face.  Smiling and laughing at each other.
“I know that, Doge.  What is it doing here?”  He repeats, leaning more heavily on his cane.  His leg hurt today, and he was not in the mood for foolishness.  It was cold out and he usually had more problems in cooler weather.  The salve Draco and his research team developed helped immensely but it was not a cure all.
“Goodnight, Albus.”  Draco wishes him, bending to kiss the crown of the boy’s head before he can reflect too much on his sentimentality.  “Sleep well.”
“Yes, Potter, why
Talbot, Clearwater, and Doge look inquisitively between him and Draco like they are exotic animals in a zoo.  The three of them obviously dressed in club gear for a roaring night out on the town by the looks of it.  Only Talbot seems appropriately abashed at approaching them.  Her expression toned down compared to the other two’s earnest looks.  They were young.  He had to remember that.  Talbot was the oldest at twenty-three and Doge the youngest at nineteen.
“A complaint was lodged against the department this morning.  Claiming one of our top aurors has been compromised.”
“Were you ever able to produce a patronus?”  Harry questions curiously, turning to his side to see Draco clearly.  Frowning when he discovers Draco’s face looking pained.
Harry is asleep before Draco turns the light out.
“Circe, I haven’t heard those names in so long.”  Draco sighs.  "Professor Lupin.”  He murmurs sounding sad.
“Sir,” Twysley greets with a respectful nod.  “We have a lead on the Spinner case.”
“Well, th -
look good.   Boss was real upset.”
It does feel strange.
It locks automatically behind them.  He glances over to the door and adds another lock if only to reassure himself that no one unwanted will walk in.  They can see people pass by the booth like nothing has changed, no real separation, but no one can see them.
He was pretty sure it wasn’t.
Ginny’s brow furrows, mouth frowning.  “You love him?”
“The healer will be here in a moment, Harry.  Let’s not disturb him until then.”  Granger advises, her tone soothing.  “Have you gotten ahold of his mother?”
Draco lets his head fall back, releasing the poor tebo from his grip and making a pfft sound.  “He agreed to meet with me.”
Albus nods assuredly.
“Malfoy?” calls out a male voice.
“Don’t act like I was the only one.”  Pansy demurs, trying to poke Draco in the side.
The street is busy with pedestrians, but it is obvious when Spinner arrives.  He is a loud apparator.  Harry overhears Twysley on the communication charm caution the hit wizard team to wait.
“Bellatrix would have
“I like you a lot, Draco.”  She tells him, interrupting his thoughts.  “You’re clever and funny and overall much more tolerable now.  We could leave Britain together – not as husband and wife – but as friends.  We can use my dowry money and have a fresh start.”  She suggests earnestly.
“None of that matters now.”  Father says with tired finality.  Long hair swinging forward, partially concealing his face.
He is the Secret Keeper otherwise.
“Let me rephrase,” Draco says, considering his next words.  “He cares less what I think about him than what you do.”
This time of day, his boyfriend is in one of two places at the manor, his office or the lab.  He finds him in the office.  Draco is writing at his desk while dictating to another quill taking notes before him.  It sounds like he is making a list for ingredients or plants he needs.
“Did you ever have a dream of what you might do once you became an adult?”  Astoria asks, turning Draco’s head again at the idea.
After they finish tucking in the children, he and Draco join Narcissa in the sitting room.  Narcissa is in the armchair near the fireplace.  Appearing to examine the stockings with all their names sewed on.  The children’s stockings were handmade by Molly.  Each embroidered with a different holiday-based design.  His and Draco’s are plainer.  Lily had taken it upon herself to place some of her stickers on them to decorate.
“It's a building.”
Malfoy reclines slightly back in his chair, watching Harry.  “The children have a mother, yes?  Or you have friends still I imagine?  Weasleys and such?”  Malfoy comments in an apathetic tone.
“Never make me do that again.”  He demands from his seat on the couch in the master suite’s sitting room.  Arm across the back of the couch.  He never wants to read an article about their relationship again.  If he can help it.
The owl drops an official looking envelope to the floor the second he opens the window.  Draco goes to take it but freezes when he sees the seal.  It is from the Minister of Magic.  There is movement from the bed as Harry swings his legs over the side of it and reaches out a hand summoning the envelope to him.  Draco watches him open it and read, expression falling.  Harry folds it shut and the letter immediately disintegrates, falling to the floor in ashes as if in a scorching fire.
“Not sure.  Spinner and his lot seem too interested in holding on to dark ritual artefacts for that.”  Shepard theorizes.
Ron nods.  “Been together for a bit.”
Harry takes - what he hopes - is an unnoticeable deep breath to steady himself.  Internally prodding himself to move forward as Hargreeves turns to both in greeting, eyebrows and mustache moving in what Harry assumes to be the man’s customary pleasant smile under all the fluff of his hair.
“I work at a healing clinic as a researcher.”
Potter kisses him then.  Draco has never had a kiss so sweet.  Chaste.  There is something about it that is captivating.  It is little more than a press of lips, but he feels his heart literally pound in his chest at it.  Suddenly intensely aware of everywhere he and Potter are touching.
“It is wrong.  One day the boy met - a wizard.  He had been told all his life this wizard was perfect.  The
Pansy giggles madly, curling up on the cushioned bench beside her sleeping husband, laying her head on his shoulder.  “Draco didn't want to visit anyone's baby factory.”
And why was Malfoy not wearing a shirt?
Everything I did was for the success of our family.  If it is true, what you say, then it is not
“Ha.”  Potter returns sarcastically, corner of his mouth lifting.  Expression thoughtful.  “He would help, you know.  Bill forgave you ages ago.”
“Perhaps I ought to have made you and Potter look after some first years while you were in Hogwarts.  We might have had an armistice between Gryffindor and Slytherin sooner.”
“Seven.”  Harry informs him, looking proud.
They went to a muggle pub after signing to celebrate the end of their marriage.  It was nice to be friends.  Better than before the separation when everything was strained and awful.  He wants to always be friends with Gin.  She's the mother of his children.
The plan had been to have Ginevra take them again at midmorning and spend the day with them at her cottage, but that gets nixed.  Instead, Ginevra comes to Grimmauld to spend the day with her offspring.
Lily cries harder.
a bad thing to be a blood traitor?”
The boys trot into the room which gets his attention.  Jamie holding his toy broom high above his head in what appears to be jubilation.  It's the new one he and Draco got him.  The last one had been burnt to ashes in an unfortunate outburst of accidental magic from Lily during a tantrum.
Draco gives him a ‘obviously’ look.
Everyone knew.  At least, it felt like the entirety of the British wizarding world did.  The announcement that they filed jointly for divorce had been splashed all over the news for months.  Speculation abounded about the reason why.  He overheard every other day about the various affairs he and Ginny were supposedly having.  People approached him on the street about it.  Even when he went on walks with his kids.  Lily in the pram and the boys at his side.  Their expressions confused and upset.  Harry had had to file an injunction on the paparazzi then.
“They are goddamn lucky we are in public.”  Ron returns, pointing furiously at them but lowering his voice.
All of it.
“How did you read these?”  Draco questions bewildered as he flips through the pages of the magazines.  He had never witnessed James read so easily.
Now, all of that has changed.
The hell of it is Malfoy looks content.  Faint lines on his forehead easing and a spark of interest on his face.  Harry imagines everything here is a significant upgrade to Azkaban.  It might help that they spend a lot of that first week putting the finishing touches on the whole place.  That Malfoy gets to choose what goes where and what he wants.  Using the pen and paper Harry gives him to make notes on how to take care of and use muggle technology he still struggles with each time.  Harry doubts he will soon forget the hilarious afternoon Malfoy learned about batteries, electricity, and fuel powering varied devices.
“I broke the glass bird.”  Jamie admits, dully.  “I tried to fix it using your wand.”
Ginevra sighs heavily.  He hears the clink of some dish being set down.  “So, I guess, we’re having this out again.”
Best laid plans and all that.
“You want to know what my daily life was like here, Harry?”  Draco starts in a strained tone, expression haunted.  “I’ll tell you.  I scarcely ate.  I rarely slept and when I did it was on my mother’s bedroom floor for whatever veneer of safety that afforded us both.  My father was out of favor.  I rarely saw him and when I did it was unpleasant to say the least.  There were . . . trainings.  Bellatrix and her cronies were in charge of those.
“It's our last night.”  Draco reminds quietly when they break apart, arms twinned behind Harry’s neck.  Harry’s hands still resting at his boyfriend’s sides.  Content.  “The children return tomorrow.”
And he did.
He wishes he had hidden somewhere else.  He’s never heard Dad and Uncle Ron argue like this.  He’s only ever heard them fight about quidditch and then those arguments were much more friendly.
“Jamie.”  Ginevra chides.  “Be nice to your sister.”
Standing side by side before their guests as Harry talks is an entirely joyous experience that he has not felt here in this place since he was a boy.  His own toast is quick.  Purposely so.  He planned it to be in case the mood became tense with him speaking.  Lily inadvertently aids him in this objective as she answers his rhetorical greeting with a lively “Hi, Papa!” surprising their guests into chuckles.
But Draco is right here.  Offering him something absolutely lovely.
He passes portrait after portrait of long-dead Malfoys as he walks to the east wing where his family’s bedrooms are.  Sconces lighting the way.  The paintings’ occupants turn their noses up at him or outright walking out of their frames to parts unknown as he goes by.  They hated him, but they knew better now than to shout out their criticisms.  None of them wanted to be confined to the dungeons.
Harry snorts.  “I doubt he’d have me.
Draco chose Harry’s outfit for tonight.  It's tighter than anything he would usually wear, and he refused shoes other than his boots.  He looks okay he thinks.  It isn't what he would normally choose for himself but it's almost better that way.  Draco is obviously pleased he allowed him to play dress up.  So much so, Harry catches Draco checking him out once or twice before they even make it out of the house.  That makes him feel good - more comfortable anyway.
“Al?”  Jamie starts contemplatively as they wait for Uncle Ron to pick them up.  Rosie is beside them with a nose in her book, hair pulled back in puff balls today.  It wasn’t even five minutes after the bell rang and she was already reading.  Lost cause, her.  “Has anyone said anything funny to you about Draco?”
“I thought it considerate.”
Draco hums dubiously.  “I’ve never been convinced of that.”
“Well, you
There are several safe houses for British auror use throughout the country and internationally.  It has been a long time since Harry set up one for his private use though.  He takes the opportunity to dust off the rust planning it out.  He outfits the safe house himself.  Situating it on the edge of a moderately populated coastal village called South Ashwith.  A locale populated solely by muggles for miles.
“Why don’t – why don’t I let you get ready?”  He eventually suggests gesturing slightly to the hallway.  Hoping to lighten the mood.  No need for this to ruin their morning he chides himself.  “I left a spare set of clothes and toiletries for you in the loo.  I can get some food for us in the meantime.”
His boyfriend’s expression is all desire as he removes his fingers and wraps them around his own erection.  Muttering the lubrication charm again as he coats himself.  Draco has an odd sense of déjà vu at the change in their positions.
“We do.”  Harry admits in a mutter.  He would rather not think about work right now.  He did his best to keep work and personal life balanced and separate – for his own peace of mind.
the children’s mother and she
Draco huffs.  “I am
Potter shrugs, scratching the back of his neck.  “It was Sirius’.  I didn’t grow up with many tangible connections to adults who actually cared about me.”
“Very.  It’s – we’ve been together a few months now.”
Hermione nudges him.  “Anything we can do?”
“Sorry.”  His boyfriend apologizes.  Looking and sounding utterly unapologetic.  “I’m just looking forward to adult time away from kids.  No accidentally stepping on toys.  No interruptions.  No having to be somewhere.”
Malfoy shakes his head, appearing lost in thought.  “Stand, please.”  Malfoy instructs quietly, eyes focusing on Harry’s right leg.  Flicking his hand and summoning a measuring tape that begins its work spooling around his limb when Harry rises.
Jamie liked Teddy.  He was cool like Freddie and always had a joke on hand plus he was able to transform himself to look like anyone because he was a metamorphmagus.  Jamie didn’t know anybody else who could do that.
“You did
“You aren’t your father.  You’re not like any of those other Malfoys.”  Potter states, looking contemplative.  “You changed.  Whatever you do with the manor will be good because you’re good.”
“You’re referring to Junge?”  Hermione inquires, peering at Robards over her reading glasses.  “Karkaroff’s son?  The Norwegian insurgent?”
Ron shakes his head.  “
I'm interested in playing around with different POVs.  The chapters I have planned out are mostly Harry or Draco POVs so far.  I own nothing but plots!  Thanks for reading.
“She wants to meet you.”  Draco tells him, eyes earnest.  “Not tonight of course, we are seeing Pansy and that lot this evening.
“Healer Hargreeves has helped me a lot over the years.  I want to support his work.”  Harry replies diplomatically, forcing his expression polite but disinterested.  “Congratulations on marrying Anthony, I guess.”
“You’re Harry Potter.”  The man identifies excitedly, holding his hands up.
It’s the weekends he does not have the kids that he struggles to find things to fill his time.  Used to be he would just go into work or do paperwork at home listening to quidditch games on the Wizarding Wireless Network.
“Of course not.”
“Do you?”  The man questions darkly.  Expression stormy.  “I think I know my brother fairly well, and he would want
“Jamie!”  Al yells.
It is Astoria Greengrass naturally.  One of the few people he wants to speak with tonight.  She sticks out in the crowd of already somewhat eccentric dressers despite her diminutive stature.  Dress spun and layered around her, leaving one of her shoulders bare.  Her hair done up with peacock patterned beads stuck through it in a crown-like fashion.  Her face is made up nicely as well though Harry doesn't have the words to describe it accurately.  It reminds him of the women he would see clubbing when he was younger.  She is certainly no longer the mousy girl he half remembers.
“Why is this man at this clinic?”
House elves don’t
“Good to see you, Harry.”  Anthony waves once in goodbye.
The wall hanging puddled on the dusty floor is a family tree.  His mother’s upon closer inspection which is no great surprise.  He levitates the hanging to cover Walburga.  Draping it over her sealed frame.  A dozen or more family members’ names have been burnt off.  He assumes by her.  The middle Black sister, Andromeda, is scorched between Bellatrix and his mother.  The surname at the bottom corner of the tree is his own, featuring the likeness of a male child beneath his parents’ names.  The tear in the corner of the fabric nearly severing his silhouette.
good.  Please, please, believe that, for me?”  He beseeches.
“Can’t a bloke just be happy to see his family?”
“Really?”  Hugo questions with a tilt of his head.
“I probably shouldn’t say that, right?”  Ginevra laughs self-deprecatingly.  “I’m the ex and all.  But it’s true.  I haven’t seen Harry so happy about something that didn't involve the children since – well, I don’t know when.”
Astoria throws her arms around him in a hug that is much stronger than he anticipated her capable.  She pulls back looking him full in the face.  Beaming.  “Promise?”
“Dad,” Jamie protests at once, but Dad holds up a finger, shushing him.  Looking over to Teddy.
“I respect that about him.”  He tells her, considering her words.
“The boy kept making choices to help others.  He changed more and more each time.  Even though he was afraid.  Even though if he were caught it meant he and his parents would be harmed – probably killed.  But eventually the evil, monstrous wizard was defeated – partly because of one of the good choices he made.  The boy was grown by then.  One who knew people are supposed to be different from each other and that no one is perfect.”
Hargreeves turns sharply and walks to an ajar frosted glass door off to the side.  Knocking hard twice.  A quiet “Enter,” emanates from the room.  The healer gestures Harry to follow, opening the door wider for them both.  Harry finds himself in a well-lit office with shelves upon shelves covering every free space of the walls filled with a wide variety of potions equipment and bottles.  Another tidy space clearly set up with the lab outside in mind.  The space was impressive like so much of the clinic Hargreeves had built, but that isn’t what makes Harry stop in his tracks.
Harry doesn't hear the rest of it.  He pulls Draco out of his seat and leads them toward the potioneer present who gave Draco the Veritaserum.  He will not allow Draco to be forced to spew any more truths before he can be given the antidote.
Right.  Draco sighs.  The boys had decided to make today the day they ask all sorts of favors.  Getting out that toy may be the line for him.
“Hello again, you two.”  Harry greets them.  “Can we have a word?”  Ron looks puzzled, but Harry looks intently at Hermione.  He watches her face phase from befuddlement to shocked understanding to her polite ministry mask.
“I was worried.”  Harry whispers moving to sit on the fluffy, blue rug Draco had in there.  He pulls idly at the material, waiting to see if his boyfriend would respond.  They are quiet for a long time.  He watches the tap run and wonders about apologizing.  He has been doing that a lot with Draco in the last 24 hours.
The broad stone walk up is crumbled; scorch marked in places.  The west wing’s windows blown out letting in the elements.  Draco walks around the side.  Getting a lay of the land.  Everything is horribly overgrown and it takes some time to get through.  It is hard to recognize the gardens and stables that were pristine in his childhood.  The pens where father kept the free-roaming peacocks in the winter are splintered and choked by weeds.  The main greenhouse seems legitimately dangerous.  He will have to have someone else here before he tackles that.  Mother and Father kept all manner of flora and fauna in there.  All of which left to grow unsupervised.
“All right.”
“No, no.  I can do this.”  Ron contends, holding up a hand.  “I’d do this for anyone else you’d date.  I can do this for you and . . . him.”
The first ones to voluntarily socialize with him are creatures – creature folk he learns to call them.  He puts his foot in his mouth more times than he can count.  It was never a strength of his to make friends, but he is learning.  Or perhaps trying is the more apt word.
Draco stills at that and Harry fears they’ll be in a stalemate, but then the man nods.
” Harry defends.
“You cannot reach your physical body.”  Severus notes, tapping at the glass with his pointer finger.  “But your mind remains yours.  If there is any solution to be found, it will be there.”
or the children without a big upset?”
“Like the abysmal lack of health education at Hogwarts.”  Hermione remarks dryly as Ron rolls his eyes next to her.  “Don’t roll your eyes at me, Ronald.”  His friend comments without even a glance at her husband.  “You cannot convince me that not having sex education
“What did he choose?”
It is also becoming obvious that Draco is shutting down.  His movements are jerkier like he is looking for an escape.  Skin still a ghostly pale.  Harry grasps Draco’s elbow, attempting to calm his boyfriend but is shaken off.  Draco’s expression is flat.  Eyes distant.
“It is your birthright."  She stated solemnly.  "You are the only remaining Malfoy heir.”
“No, you don’t.”  She challenges, reaching over to pat his cheek.  Reminding him instantly of their daughter.  “Tell me when you realized you were attracted to men, my dear ex-husband.”
“Everyone seems to have a different opinion on the subject.”  She comments with a sigh.  “What you need and what you don’t in a marriage.  No one’s been alike.”
“This is about the waiter.”  Draco states dryly.
He knows Draco didn’t mean it to sound defeatist or sad.  Quite the opposite.  But Harry can’t help but feel a bit badly.  “What sort of person would you like though?”  He asks curiosity stirred now.
His boyfriend had such a way with words.
“Welcome to the club, mate.”  Ron says in an affable manner.
“I will bear that in mind.”  He responds.
“Fine.”  Harry says with finality.  Using his commanding tone.  He can be mature.  “Be angry, Ron.  It won’t change anything.”  He grits out, moving to stand.  Suddenly feeling embarrassed at his own childishness.  He looks over to Molly, whose expression is upset and bewildered.  He tries to find the words to apologize for ruining her lovely meal.
Harry can’t quite figure out what happens then.  It seems to him Draco goes from being firmly in his arms to a melding of something fluid and rapidly changing in size.  Maybe two seconds pass as he tears the blanket off them to get a better look at what’s happening.
“I see that, you have good taste.”
“You’re going to end up on the PTA at this rate, Draco.”  Pansy teases.
The Burrow is, in a word, cozy.  It reminds him of a soft skein of yarn.  Sprawling and bound together at once.  Built for the comfort and function of its residents.  Every inch of it intrigues him.  Odds and ends, photos, and children’s toys scattered about.  All reflecting love and family.
Draco thinks that is that when they tuck Albus back into bed several minutes later.  Already falling asleep and muttering to himself in the way he did sometimes when he slept.  He and Harry trudge back to bed and try to get more sleep themselves.  Harry practically falls on top of him as Draco lays down.  Curling up behind him as Draco feels himself drift off.
“The left hand of the Blight?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“They will never accept you."  Father tells him viciously.  "No matter what you do or who you debase yourself with – however exalted
He side steps and takes his brother by the hand to help him up when the shrubbery before them gives three barks causing them to freeze in place in front of the bush.  Its branches and leaves shuddering ominously.  A twig snaps loudly and something launches at them.
“What made you stay?”  Draco questions interested.  He knew some of Potter’s experience living there.  It sounded little like the Black ancestral home his mother mentioned visiting throughout her childhood.  The Grimmauld Place in his mother’s stories was an opulent wizarding home, filled with all manner of dark objects and wizards.
“Speak for yourself.”  Draco says.  He was a potions apprentice too at the time.  When he was not working, he was focused on his studies.  It was always his backup plan to get work through one of his professors if employment at the club did not pan out.  The pay would have been even worse, but he would have gone on.  Somehow.
He hears a boom as loud as a canon.  Shaking him abruptly.  There is fire everywhere around him now.  Eating through the dusty, floor length curtains in the great hall and climbing the arches to the top of the ceiling.  Cracks along the walls facing the outside of the manor let in fading afternoon light, growing with each boom as if a battering ram were striking the structure.  He needs to move.  Fire may not be able to burn him in this form, but it could burn Harry.  He flops to the floor from the table where he landed.  Utterly graceless and frail in this state.
“What did he do?”
Draco does not hear Harry’s response.  Their voices drop too low.  He falls back asleep.  It is dreamless thank Circe.
“I know I've been occupied, Draco.”  Pansy cries, leaning toward him.  “Between work, Tony, and the children.  We haven’t been able to be as close as we once were.  I knew that was natural with us living so far away from each other.  But, I hoped . . . with you moving back -
He even makes decent progress fixing the bike considering he has zero mechanical skills.  Fortunately, the videos online about repairing this brand of motorbike acts as a step by step guide.  The main trouble comes from needing new parts and fixing the defensive operations Arthur had installed.  Strangely enough, this is sort of what he expected middle age to be like.  Him fooling around with some contraption like an enormous jigsaw puzzle.
Draco returns her look.  “I’ve been deemed a responsible adult.”
He loved that Draco and Lily were so bonded, but he did wonder at some of the unexpected results.
He is fairly sauced right now if he is honest.  That's the only way he could be convinced to dance.  He can only imagine how the younger members of his squad would be positively agog to see him like this.  It does remind him of his late teenage years and his early twenties to be jumping around and lost in a crowd like this.  Well, as unaware as he ever gets.  He still finds himself in strategically useful positions.  Unable to leave the cautious side of him behind.  Draco is not especially outgoing either, but he seems to be having a good time.  At least, he assumes so based on the fact Draco hasn't pulled away from Harry’s touch all night.  So much of this is like foreplay he thinks.  Dancing together in each other’s personal space.  The two of them.  The focus on moving together.  Heartbeats racing and an uplifted feeling coursing through him.
Malfoy hums non-committedly and takes a careful bite, somehow avoiding spilling crumbs that Harry has already managed to coat his front with despite the newspaper covering.  “It’s a goblin system.  It only makes sense to them.”  Malfoy says loftily, after he is finished chewing.  “And besides, I
“Not always.”  Harry reproaches.  “I have to work at it.  I think everyone does.  From what I’ve seen of you in the last few months, you do.  We couldn’t have gotten on like we have if you didn’t.  You wouldn’t have even been working at the clinic if you didn’t want to help others – chose to.”  Harry counters, taking the few steps over and, resting his hand on Draco’s upper arm.
it.”  Rosier hisses.  “But you
“Oh dear, I didn’t get permission to bring you yet, Rolf.”  Luna remarks, glancing upward to the man above her frowning.  “I think you surprised him.”
“We?”  Uncle Ron bursts out accusingly.  His face redder all of a sudden.  Surprising Jamie into freezing where he's hiding.  Uncle Ron could be loud, sure, but he was rarely angry.
Comes a more traitorous voice in the back of his head.
“Harry, I –
If it were anyone else in the world, he would be howling in laughter right now, but it’s Luna.  So instead he gives her a hug, lifting her briefly off her feet, and guffawing.
“Teddy, you go first.”  Dad orders.
“I am sorry for that, darling, but the photo is flattering, don’t you think?”  Astoria notes airily.
“How do you feel?  You okay?”  Harry asks again.
After a satisfactory amount of poking and prodding, on Malfoy’s part this was done to Harry’s leg, and on Harry’s to eat lunch while out on break, Harry was finally able to convince Malfoy – the posh prat – to join him for lunch
His boyfriend runs a hand hastily through his hair.  “It’s a summons.  There’s a, well – I have to go.”  He gets to his feet and exits the bedroom heading for the walk-in closet.  Draco follows.
“I can leave.” Draco offers to Harry in a whisper, lips barely moving.  “Perhaps it would be better that way.”
“You must recognize the irony in telling
“Andromeda.”  Narcissa calls out, tone carefully even.  Fingers clasping at the carved frame of the wooden archway.  “Happy Yule.”
Ginny sighs, appearing put out.  “This again?”
He watches them floating around the perimeter outside of the fortress’ towers when he is out for daily exercise in the courtyard.  Hands clasping the iron bars that form the wall around them.  It is one of his hobbies.  Observing everyone’s movements.  There is not much else to do and other inmates rarely approach him.  It is better that way.  When they do approach it is almost always a fight.
Andromeda and Teddy arrive via floo while Narcissa is gone to visit Lucius.  He and Draco invited them once they decided on having an official Yule celebration this year.  Draco had engaged in a fervent letter writing campaign with his mother the week before her visit to convince her to stay with them and enjoy Yule with their remaining Black relations.
There are more questions than answers swirling in his mind.  Does he want to continue working on the manor?  Should he even care if the place will accept him?
When they land in a small clearing in the woods outside South Ashwith, Malfoy staggers blindly to the side.  Barely kept from falling by the firm grip Harry has on the man’s wrist.  There is a cold wind permeating through the fir trees.  The force of it chilling even him in his thick cloak.  Harry will give Malfoy this, he doesn’t shout or try to run away or fight like Harry suspected the man might.  Rather, he just stares wide-eyed, body freezing in place the moment he catches sight of Harry.  Every part of Malfoy visibly on alert then.  It has been fifteen years since they last saw each other.  Malfoy was always a bit taller – that’s not changed.  The man is thin, hair long and unkempt, and vaguely odorous.  Skin nearly translucent with how pale he is.  Harry is well aware that the prisoners don’t get a lot of sun, but it looks like Malfoy’s been living in a cave.  There is a weariness in his expression.  Desperation.  In fact, Harry is fleetingly reminded of Xenophilius Lovegood’s appearance during the war with how tense and disheveled the man before him is now.
“Dare I ask?”  Hermione queries.
They have already done more than Draco has with the few muggle blokes who propositioned him at clubs.  Potter has seen more of him than he has shown anyone.  What if Potter is disappointed in him?  Or finds him boring?  Most men at their age are more experienced.  What if -
“I don’t wanna bother him, Draco.  He’s busy.”
“It gets mentioned when we socialize.”  Harry answers.  “Not always though.”
When he arrives at Grimmauld Place that evening the children are already in bed for the night.  Draco is not certain he could have withstood their inquisitive nature and demands for attention now at any rate.  Kreacher bows him in and escorts him to Potter’s study, announcing his entrance and excusing himself to get them tea.  A very old-fashioned elf.
The two of them watched curiously from around the corner as Dad returned down the stairs tucked behind the plain, wooden door on the third floor.  The only door in the house that Dad always kept locked.  Shaking his head with a rolled up rug tucked under his arm that would eventually be used to cover the floor where the crunchy carpet was removed.  Kreacher trailed Dad wringing his gnarled hands piteously, muttering about his mistress and
“Nothing fit for decent company.”  Harry deadpans.
“Harry.”  Draco repeats, sounding fond.  Eyes lidded.  Harry gives him a cheeky look and is rewarded by Draco’s own rare grin.  Totally ornery and sated.  Harry waves his hand casting a wandless cleaning spell over them and tangles his fingers with Draco’s own.  His boyfriend reaches for the blanket, cocooning them both where they lay side by side.
“Do you believe I have any issue with telling you how I feel?”  The man states dryly giving him a long look.  Harry has come to understand that expression.  He used to get it a lot from Hermione.
“No, I cannot.”  Draco answers quickly.  Like the words burn to get out of him.  A classic characteristic of the truth serum in its drinkers.
It was not the first time he had heard James say he did not want to disturb Harry.  Draco suspected it had to do with the boy’s desire to not disappoint his father or somehow drudge bad memories to the forefront.  James had mentioned in the past not asking prying questions because ‘Dad gets sad’.  Draco had overheard James pressuring Albus to do the same.
“Like nitwits?”  Harry suggests, feeling his evening has sidetracked.
It is quite the feat.
“I see.”  Draco acknowledges.  Harry draws close, green eyes bright.  Draco realizes he wants to say yes.  “Very well.  I’ll move in.”
“I wanted to talk more about you meeting my kids.”  He clarifies.  It was time.  He had been content to wait and see where their relationship was going, but now he knew.  For him, this was the final piece he had yet to share with Draco.
The man emits a little sigh but does seem relieved.  “I wish I knew better than to be attracted to you.”  He mutters.
There is more laughter and children running about than he suspects the manor has ever seen.  His own remembrances are more . . . restrained.
“They get excited.  It’s nothing more than that.”  His boyfriend excuses.
“I don’t know,” Harry retorts after swallowing.  “Is what you did to me last night proper?  Let’s consult the etiquette book.”  The man teases.
“I’m there most of the time.”  Simone answers.  “I was born there.  My designing business is based in Paris too, but I also spend time in Seoul where a few of our other businesses are located.”
can do that.
Harry sighs.  The last thing he needs around here is another copy of Witch Weekly.  He got enough ribbing for the media's interest in him from Robards and the other DHs in the off hours.  Plus, Clearwater was already a notorious scrapbooker in the auror department.  She thought it hilarious to put together a booklet of him in the news which she presented to him every year since she joined the auror department as a trainee.  Doge’s copy at least didn't appear to have anything cut out of it.
cautious.  He waits for the moment Draco tells him something that makes him hesitate.  That makes him unsure.  Drawback.
“You’re absolutely right, Al.”  He agrees emphatically.  “She’s a Maud.”
It is lovely and unhurried.
“I suppose not.”  Draco concurs with a nod.  “My job is all that I hoped it would be.  I’ve been allowed to pursue my interests in developing more treatments for maligning curses.”
The gala is at its peak when Harry finds himself next to Draco, a way away from others, his back to the wall.  Harry casually hands him a drink and continues to sip his own.  Keeping an eye out for Ron and Hermione.  The lots are being read off by the emcee and winners in the audience being congratulated.  Harry watches Hargreeves and several of his staff get their photos taken on stage.  Hargreeves eyebrows are making their happy movements.  Harry is glad for him.
Mordred and Morgana, how he had missed him.  Morbid, dry personality and all.  Severus had been one of the few constants in his life.  A calming, sane opinion in the rarefied world he was raised in.  Checking his enormous, unearned ego more than once where other adults let him run amok.  Draco had admired Severus all the more when he finally struck out on his own.  Going against the current.  Defying his parents' expectations.
Draco is surprised to hear that.  He has never been to Grimmauld Place before to his knowledge.  Although, this elf is definitely old enough to have served Walburga Black.
The cold permeates everything those first few days in Azkaban.  The frost encroaching into his wool blanket and grey uniform.  Reaching his hair and hands until it feels as though it has roots down into the marrow of his bones.  It is a lead weight that anchors him down when for so long he had existed on the razor’s edge of survival.  Unsure of where he would fall.  It is a shock to his system until he acclimates.  Then it is akin to walking around in a numbing mist with occasional jolts of painful sensation.  This well-deserved purgatory.  There is certainly nothing pleasant about the place.  Draco did not expect there to be.  Dementors drift in and out.  Never with any clear aim.  There is no space that is off limits to them.  The frayed black tendrils of their auras trailing behind.  Catching their victims in full body tremors.
a legitimate question?”  Ron asks looking and sounding unsettled.
at the end.  It has been corrupted.”
“Gee thanks, Pansy.”  Harry returns sarcastically.
“On occasion.”  Draco responds, unmoved.  A hint of defiance in his tone.
interested in the living - the afterlife is not entirely dull.”
“I appreciated your original letter more.”  Hermione responds gently.  She takes Ron’s hand and looks up at her husband.  “He wrote to me and apologized years ago.  I kept the letter.  I ought to share it with you.”
Teddy wakes them up bright and early for waffles the next morning.  Dad’s sleeping in which happens on the weekend and Draco typically spends the first few hours in the library most days, so the four of them get to eat breakfast without pesky adults around.  They're talking about the English quidditch league when it occurs to Jamie now might be a good time to ask Teddy a question.  Teddy knew lots of things he didn’t.
“Really?”  He checks despite himself.
After a while, he is less fascinating for them.  No longer the shiny new toy.  They run in and out of wherever he and Harry are.  Making their cacophony of noise with Potter passing down whatever judgements they need.
“I was an idiot.”
“My lab partner?”
“Just because I’m not parenting like you did, doesn’t make me any less their mother.”
He feels at a loss for words but is not discomfited.  There have been so few things in his life that have felt as correct as this moment.  “I fancy you, Potter.”  He declares, disliking how breathless he sounds.
“You know that, Lils.”  Ginevra reminds gently, ducking slightly around Ron as she attempts to make eye contact with her daughter.  “Remember you saw the wedding album at the cottage?  You liked my pretty dress?”
He goes to step away with Draco, but Hermione stops them.  Hand loosely gripping Draco’s wrist as she and Draco share a long look.
“So,” Ron starts slowly, eyes shifting down to his drink.  “’Mione tells me Malfoy is moving in with you.”
“About fourteen months.”  Pansy answers with a smile, looking over at her son who is flailing his arms.  “It went very quickly.”
Tonight, he is wearing one of his more formal grey suits with the evergreen patterned robes Kreacher picked out for him.  It's lightweight which is what he prefers.  If he never wore thick wool again during a mission it would be too soon.  He adjusts his tie as he looks in the mirror.
They stop.  Staring at each other.  Harry smiles tiredly and even Draco’s expression softens.
“Auror Potter, we will be seeking statements from the three individuals you named.  One of our staff will contact you afterward and inform you of our decision.  Please remain here in the meantime.”
“We’re friends, right?”  Harry checks as they leave the clinic and begin walking side by side to the pub.  It is a bit chilly out though it is nearly summer now.  It had rained earlier in the day.
The boy seems like he might argue but Harry crouches down beside his son.  “You need to drink it to get better.  No fuss, Al.”
Draco nods.  Thinking over her words.  They were not untrue.  It was comforting to him that Harry tended toward the right path like true north.  Harry was far from perfect, he knew that well, but Draco trusted his judgement above his own.  Particularly in regards of the heart.
Harry grits his teeth.  Then releases the tray.  Ron practically throws it at Percy, who does appear pleased to finally get his bacon.
“What is your relationship to Auror Potter?”
“Oh, that.”  Jamie considers.  “No.  I guess not.”  He determines.  Draco didn’t cause any problems so far as Jamie could tell.  Draco didn’t boss him either like other adults.  Sure, Uncle Ron didn’t like him, but Dad wanted him around.
“No.”  He answers, nonplussed.  He really didn’t.  He is not sure why that matters.
”  Harry repeats for emphasis, grinning wider.  Feeling the affection in his chest expand.  The intensity of it.
“You asked.”  Harry says shrugging.
It falls to him, strangely enough, to take James to the diagnostician.  A pediatric healer.  Harry was called in last minute on an emergency.  Draco just told him to go.  He can handle this one appointment.
It goes quickly after that.  Spinner puts up more of a fight than anticipated and a few guards pop out.  Shepard takes him on.  Twysley and Talbot charge through a back door in the building and deal with the guards.  He spies hit wizards appearing in bursts on the roof and infiltrating the hideout.  The associate turns tail and leaves, running directly down the alleyway toward him.  Harry throws out a spell to prevent the runner from apparating.  Letting the disguise he wore disappear.  The two of them are in the briefest of duels until Harry disarms him.
Still, he likes experiencing new things with Harry outside the bedroom too.  Draco had particularly appreciated the chocolate tasting they went on.  He had bought a lot of sweets.  They planned to share a portion of them with the children but stash the remainder away for themselves.  Harry assured him this was a normal parenting practice.
“Both.”  Draco retorts automatically, brow furrowing and ire rising.  “How could you not know what you did?  That allowing us to be harmed by the dark lord perverted the foundational magic?”
“Forgive me for wanting to find out if Harry screwed Draco before he screwed him.”  Hermione responds testily.  “It could've been a honeypot.”
“Of course not, darling.”  Narcissa simpers.  “I didn’t mean anything by it.”
Hermione huffs.
“Bling.”  Harry supplies with a guffaw.
That’s just if he’s honest.
“It's our house, Al.”  James says, sounding self-assured.  “Dad wouldn’t keep anything here that can hurt us.  C’mon, help me pull this off.”
The worst-case scenario was Draco being attacked or cursed.  They had been lucky; nothing had shown itself yet.  Harry had strengthened the wards on Draco’s flat accordingly.  Made it so no cursed mail or packages could arrive at his door or work despite Draco’s complaints that he could manage dark objects.  He gifted Draco a watch and cufflinks with strong protection charms inscribed on them.  Both of which Draco happened to be wearing now.
“Do you know what blood traitor means, Jamie?”  Al asks, looking up at him.
At that time, he only had lovely memories associated with the bike.  Going out for country runs to taste the air.  Packing Teddy into the side car with care to go on an adventure.  His godson's cheery little face smiling toothily up at Harry from the little wolf shaped helmet he got him.  Or the times he and Gin would travel to meet with friends.  Enjoying their time together.
“What about your work is discussed?”
But another thought arises as he makes his way to work.  One he can't quite shake while lining up in the queue inside the atrium.  Taking the lifts down to his level and heading straight into his office to review the night shift’s reports.  Interoffice paper aeroplane memos flying through the air.
Albus takes a great gasp of air as his color improves.  Eyes squinting open and tears running out of them.  Ginevra starts crying as Harry kneels and they both hold onto their son’s hands.  Draco knows he is in the way now as his own shoulders slump in great relief and he gets to his feet and looks around at those gathered.
They are not even back at Grimmauld long when it becomes obvious something is amiss.  The children typically ran off to the playroom or the garden first thing.  Unwinding after school.  Lily and Albus scamper upstairs, but James remains with Draco and Harry in the sitting room.  Drawing the tip of his toe in a line back and forth across the carpet.  Draco frowns slightly at that, it was new carpet after all.
Harry shrugs, scratching the back of his neck.  “It’s like anything else.  You have to decide for yourself what you want out of it.”
Nearly two months later, when Harry lands in the floo of Draco’s flat, he is met with a very solid body pulling him through the apartment and into the master bedroom.  Draco twists and captures Harry in a kiss against the wall.  Harry is certain this is their last stop and is pleasantly surprised when Draco leads him purposefully by the hand to the bed and presses him down by the shoulders to sit.  The man moves to straddle him, wrapping arms around Harry’s shoulders.  Harry considers himself lucky.
There is splashing behind him as the others join him.  Several of them yelling in fear.  Draco is half kneeling over Albus, trying to ascertain if the boy is alive with a quick jerk of his wand.  Flickering green mist from his wand indicating a weak positive.
Draco winces for a split second before recovering and begins to nod his head in silent acceptance.  Harry squeezes Draco’s arm, bringing them face to face with no proper distance apart.  Harry can see all the flecks of color in his eyes.  Draco’s face flashing a moment between vulnerable and guarded.
Jamie thinks of himself as someone able to get on with most kids his age.  His best mates are Garth, Ian, and Yuri.  If he's going to have the best fun it's usually with them.  They like quidditch almost as much as him and are up for most games.  Before he met Draco, Jamie always thought Uncle Ron was his dad’s best mate.  Lately though, he's wondering if Draco might be.  But he’s really not sure what they have in common.
Malfoy shifts slightly in his seat.  “Well, it must have been hard to be married to you when you spend your holidays hiding recently released convicts.”  He remarks lightly.
“You. Are. Weak.”  Jamie tells his brother emphatically in his most threatening voice.  Wishing it sounded more like Dad when he’s angry.
registered.”  His boyfriend contends.
They return to their table.  Simone at their side.  Seamus is at their table now with the Goldsteins and Astoria.  A half dozen glasses in front of them.  His old friend hops to his feet and comes around the table to shake hands with Harry.  Eyes positively popping with interest the moment they land on Simone.
“ – my death was imminent at any rate.  The horcrux was destroyed in the fire.  Crabbe was dead.  If I returned to the death eaters, I would have been killed for yet another of my failures.  I did not wish to die as a death eater.  I preferred what I assumed would be my inevitable capture as a traitor at the end of the battle then a prolonged torture and eventual death.
Ron frowns down at his wife, brow furrowing.  Harry had no idea.  Draco never told him.
Draco sniffs.  “You were cold.”
“What do you want, Draco?”  Potter asks, reaching over to put his arm around Draco’s shoulders.  Momentarily surprising him.  “What kind of couple do you want to be?”
Here is the thing about Harry that Draco has learned: he is a pervert.  Draco suspects – well he knows – his boyfriend has kinks.  Draco does too apparently.  They have played around with blindfolds and rope – mostly on Harry.  He is aware that they are only scratching the surface of his boyfriend’s interests.  Harry has let slip more than once how wild it makes him when Draco gets rough.  They have spoken about it a few times.  Harry has a standing offer to try out some more kinks and being open to hearing out any of Draco’s.  One day maybe.
All easy and carefree in public in a manner Draco is unaccustomed to but relishes nonetheless.  Taking pictures on his phone of local attractions and buying little trinkets for the children.  Content to laze in bed and walk around the city.  Walking together arm in arm.  Enjoying the sights and sounds around them.  Harry is a firm presence at his side.  One that relaxes and intrigues.
It's also up to his heart.
“We obviously have different parenting philosophies.”  She returns.
“What happened to the boy?”
“They’re
“I think that’s our fault.”  Ginevra states.  She and Mrs. Weasley having joined them.  “He must’ve heard Mum and me having a . . .
“Is there anything we should be doing at home?”  Draco asks.  James groans.
“Leave Dad alone, Lily.”  Al speaks before Jamie can say anything.  “He’s sleeping.”
It’s much easier when they get the crup to the loo attached to their bedroom.  No one goes in there except him and Al when they’re here.  The walls are thick enough that he doubts anyone would be able to hear the crup if she started barking.  Plus, it was no problem to smuggle in food and a bowl for water.
The Potter children meet Draco Malfoy.
“I enjoy my work and I love my kids.  Those parts of my life are nice.”  He shares.  Choosing to exclude the fact that he works too much and sees his kids too little.  That his kids only seem to tolerate him.  Look at him like he’s a stranger half the time.
“What happened then?”
“They told me it was unlikely to be successful considering the shards exposure to my hip and everything.  That’s why they went for the implants to work as a counter-curse.”  Harry explains with a shrug.  It had been a simple decision for him to make at the time.  Wanting to get to recovery as quick as possible for work. “And, I still had use of the leg.”
“Okay.”  Draco agrees.
There is a heavy thunk from above causing Draco to glance up at the ceiling to the third floor.  As he heads up the stairway, he begins to make out the boys whispering.  Moving slowly to suss out where they are.  It is not too challenging a task.  He finds the door to the attic ajar, and silently opens it further to climb the steps.
General Warning: this chapter contains one instance of a homophobic slur.
Hermione purses her lips in concentration, but it only takes a moment then her face lights up.  “Eldridge Bobbins.”
He sits in one of the new armchairs Draco bought, watching the snow continue to fall outside and basking in the warmth on the inside.  A sense of calm fills him.  This is what he likes best about this time of year.  It is what was missing from his childhood before Hogwarts.  A family.  Contentment.  Enjoying being with people he loves.  They are all in the sitting room.  Christmas tree lit in the corner.  Fairy lights and homemade ornaments decorating it.  One of his favorites is a small one.  A little snowflake framing a picture of him holding Teddy as a baby.
“I am not being an arse.”  Uncle Ron argues.  “I’m just not thrilled to discover my best mate has practically moved this –
“I love you Mini-Bolt.  I love how fast you go over the hill at Nan’s.  I love that you are better at turning than Jamie’s dumb Rapid.”
It is all white noise.
“Why don’t you go up there and get your picture taken.”  Harry prods partly teasing.
“Draco –
“He taught Defense Against the Dark Arts in our third year.”  Draco answers, nodding between him and Dad.  “He was the best teacher we had in that subject.”
He turns and the heavy door opens obligingly as he exits and walks down the steps into the crisp, early morning.  He actually liked this time of day.  Hardly anyone was around on campus.  It was conducive for him to study at the library before class.  Afterward, he could hopefully nab a couple hours sleep before his shift later this evening.
When Maud begins to bark loudly as they reach a high part of the creek’s edge, and he looks down.
“I know you're mocking her, but the two of you have very similar taste palettes.”  Draco intones, expression teasing.
Harry counted himself lucky to get treatment there.
There is a lot of plot happening in this one.  I hope you enjoy.  As always, I own nothing.  Thank you for reading.
“Hello, to you to, son.”  Harry greets a touch sarcastically.  “And, no you may not.”
“Jamie, we found you!”  Hugo announces suddenly, bushy hair bouncing in his excitement, distracted from his re-telling of what happened.  Jamie doesn’t think it counts considering he left his hiding place of his own accord.  Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron exchange a look of bewilderment at his entrance.  Draco frowns.  Jamie isn’t sure if it’s because of Lily being hurt or the fact he was hiding in the room all along.
a good boyfriend.”
The room brightens.  Harry watches as the rooms leading off the main foyer fill with light further emphasizing the manor’s old, opulent trappings.  Stone floor with its designs etched throughout in intricate patterns.  Portraits stirring in their elaborate frames.  Busts and statuettes throwing odd shadows on the wall.
“What were you assisting him with?”
“No.”  His boyfriend acknowledges.
“I don’t remember, and I don't have time for this.  You are not even real.”  Draco responds irately.
Kingsley sighs.  A rare expression of frustration.  “Gawain and Harry can understand my thinking, I believe.  I was an auror for years.  You come to rely on your instincts and mine are telling me we are playing into whatever game this perpetrator is playing.  There have been some successes, certainly, but we need to formulate a novel approach.  Something whoever this is, isn’t expecting.”
Dad is looking at him seriously and Jamie’s not sure why.  But things are not off enough to fuss about it.  They join the group waiting for them on the sidewalk.  Lily still clasping Draco’s hand and Al talking a mile a minute about his class project on dinosaurs.  Draco looks dazed.
“And that’s another thing, I wish you would do more with Lily.”  Mrs. Weasley states sounding frazzled.  Voice emanating from the open kitchen just around the corner from him.
When they look out Draco expects to see part of the east wing, but instead he sees himself.  Body hanging limply in the air above the long table of the great hall as if he is held up by an invisible giant who is using him as a puppet.  One of his arms is at a strange angle, pointing downward, clearly broken.  Blood dripping steadily down it.  His wand lays in the puddle underneath.  Several fine cuts can be seen on his face and neck, bleeding too, and staining the side of his jumper and his hair a dark red.
“Angry?”  The man throws out gutturally.  Looking wretched.
“Thanks for inviting us.”  Harry acknowledges with a gracious bow of his head.
“About how gay you are.”  Harry comments dryly making Ron guffaw beside him.
“Mrs. Malfoy.”  He replied with a nod, clasping his hands before him.  “Was there something you needed?”
“He’s here.  Green team, move.”  Harry commands.  Causing Doge to jump in his seat and Clearwater to sigh dramatically at being interrupted.  Those two were on crowd control.
“I’d like nothing better.”
“It’s all right now.”  He finds himself saying, reaching out without thinking to squeeze James’ shoulder.  James merely stares at him looking stunned before roughly grabbing him in a hug.  Burying his face in Draco’s shirt.  Breaking into a heart wrenching sob.
When Draco asks Harry about it one night, his boyfriend only shrugs, setting his glasses down on the bedside table as he prepares for sleep.
Draco waves an errant hand at him as if Harry is a pesky fly.  “You refuse to get rid of items that cannot be repaired and replace them with the functional things I already own.”
He and Al speak at once as the story comes out in bits and pieces.  How they found her.  Their concern that Bixby would evict her from the estate.  Storing – not hiding – her in the loo until they could talk to them.  Maud escaping from their bedroom and finding Lily.
“You’ll have to let us know how you liked it.”  Hermione says as the four of them stand in the foyer of the Granger-Weasley home, saying their goodbyes.  “I’ve heard the food and the shopping there are superb.”
“Are you trying to get rid of me?”  He half-jokes.  Deflecting.  Family is not his favorite topic of late.  His divorce over a year ago still too raw.  Him and Ginny had been falling apart for years, he just wishes it could have ended sooner.  Maybe he’d be in a better place with his kids now if that was the case.  The truth was no one was waiting for him at home or even expecting to hear from him this last week.
take on all the hosting duties.”  She remarks.
The alternative title of this chapter is Narcissa.  This was a fun one to write.  It isn't the holiday season yet but I wanted to include a chapter like this.  There is something about holiday based fics.  I'm a sucker for those across all fandoms.  I know nothing about yule and have completely made everything up.
The whole thing feels like a long, bizarre dream.  Every moment he finds Malfoy staring around agog is another that reminds Harry forcefully that the man before him is totally at sea and trying to figure how to swim.
Mrs. Malfoy is so obviously Draco’s mum.  They’re just alike.  She’s always dressed up and has the same sort of aloof expressions that leaves him feeling uncertain.  Prim, proper, and posh in her every word and movement.  Like one of the fancy witches in the clothing magazines Nan ordered from sometimes.  Smiling but distant.  If Jamie was unsure about Draco at first, Mrs. Malfoy is another level of impassive.  Plus, he usually has the creeping feeling she knows what he’s thinking about.
“Harry.  Merlin, Draco, call me Harry now at least.”  He grumbles, knowing that will make Draco laugh.  Can feel it start from the way his boyfriend slightly shakes above him.  The sound of it lovely.  Harry squeezes Draco’s side in response.
They’re having curry tonight.  It’s spicy and filling and oh so good.  Jamie eats two plates worth.  Splitting the naan with Teddy and Al.  Kreacher baked it today and it made the house smell good.  Everyone really enjoys it.  Except Draco doesn’t eat as much.  Spicy foods make his stomach hurt.  Jamie supposes that’s not so bad.  More curry for the rest of them.
“And the kids too of course.  All of us.  Together.”  Ron assures quickly.  He takes a deep breath and visibly steels himself.  Harry straightens in his own seat, giving his friend his full attention.  “I’m sorry, mate.  I’ve been a berk about Malfoy.”
Draco sighed then, mouth turning rueful.  “In my case, you announce your homosexuality in an argument with your mother.  Then run off with your ex-fiancée to Paris and only write to your father once a year for the next several years.”
.”  Pansy rebukes, voice carrying over him.  She narrows her eyes, scrutinizing Draco until she freezes.  “You
Draco is not certain how to be a part of that or if he even should.  His boyfriend or Lily usually take him by the hand to include him.  Otherwise, Draco will hang back as Potter interacts with the children.  Tentative.  The first time he gently enforces one of Potter’s rules – no pushing each other – the children look up at him incredulously like a nest of diricawls stunned to be found by a human.  There is a stagnant pause and then the boys start laughing.  Cracking up like Draco told them a terrific joke.  They stop abruptly when their father walks in and assesses the situation.  Telling his children they need to mind Draco.  Apparently, he is a responsible adult.
“What did you say, Teddy?”  Dad asks, reaching over to the side table to put on his glasses.
“Well, if Pansy liked it.”  Harry comments sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
want me to.”  He trails off, looking to the side with a frown.
His boyfriend chuckles softly.  Grey eyes amused.  “I'm much more interested in spending time with you where you don’t look like you're about to ingest a pickled flobberworm.”  Draco states, extending a hand to Harry.
Harry huffs amusedly.  “I promise.”  He swears grinning.  Draco was cute when he was nervous about being sexy.  The earnestness of it never failed to endear Harry to him further.  There was very little the man could do to turn him off.
Harry just chuckles.  “I had to try.”  His boyfriend responds, raising his hands in surrender.  “Seriously though, thank you so much for looking after them.  I know they can be naughty little shits.”
The day he divorced Ginny was another sunny day several years later.  They signed the papers with their solicitors present.  Copies of their divorce prepared for them both for their records.  It was all very civil.  The paparazzi was banned from the floor they were on, but they still had to wade through flash bulbs going off at them on the way into the registry department.  He remembers gritting his teeth through it all.  Willing his expression distant and unengaging.
to be your friend – but you see – I also fancy you.”  He tells Draco earnestly.
It is true that he does not have an abundance of time to dedicate to restoring the manor.  However, he does manage to go out to the estate at least once during the course of the week.  After a couple of months, the stables and barn are reconstructed and the main greenhouse is back in working condition.  Work on the gardens and lawn is much more challenging than he anticipated.  Once that laborious effort is completed, he takes a quiet moment to sit in the gazebo with his eyes closed.  Breathing it in.  The smell of the breeze carrying the aroma of freshly dug earth from the flower beds and shrubs is an exact replica of his childhood memories.  The sound of the fountain is even the same.
His own laugh startles him and Astoria giggles along.  She has a pretty laugh.  Harry can see where her humor aligns with Draco’s dry one.
“I was mostly.”  Harry replies.  “But you were definitely missing.”  He adds, leaning in and kisses Draco’s cheek.  Savoring the feeling of Draco smiling underneath his lips.  Draco takes his hand again, turning toward him, and eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips.
Harry gives his friend what he aims to be a sober look.  “Yes.  We’ve been seeing each other.  It is serious and I want you to know.”
Harry finds himself looking forward to these meet ups more and more as time goes on and the weeks turn into months.  Dressing with a little more care.  Checking that there's no ink on his sleeve from Lily practicing her letters beside him.  Making more of an attempt to comb his hair.
“Yes.”  He affirms.  It pleases him now to understand that part of himself.  Questioning and being confused was hard and he was so alone in it.  “I am.”
“I’m glad we came here.”  Draco admits after they eat for a couple minutes.  “This food is better.”
wizarding magics.  Father would be horrified.  The majority of students are still wizards and witches.  However, there are one or two goblins, vampires, elves, and half-breeds with various ancestry.  He does not exactly socialize with anyone.  Really, Astoria is the only person he talks to on any given day – and sometimes Simone who works at the club where they work.  He is mostly okay with that.  He keeps his head down that first year.
“I’m fine.”  Uncle Ron answers tightly.  Looking anything but.
“You’re a good parent.”  Harry murmurs absently into Draco’s chest.  “You were patient with him when I couldn’t be.  You’re always so patient.”
hurt him or there will be consequences etc.”
“Not at present.”  Draco denies.  Jamie thinks that's a shame.  He wants to breathe fire when he grows up.  More adults should.  It does pique his interest enough to ask the only question he cares about.
As they walk back, he notices that there is a man sitting at the table with Dad.  Jamie’s never seen him before.  He is very blonde and pale like Jamie's Aunt Fleur and cousin Victorie.  His nose and chin are pointy, but it doesn’t look ugly.  The man is dressed posher than anyone at the restaurant.  He looks even posher compared to Dad who is dressed in a tee and regular jeans obviously more at ease where he sits than the man.  Jamie can’t tell if the stranger is a wizard or not, so he doesn’t ask in case the man’s muggle.
Pansy drags Anthony in her wake seemingly to go find her other friends.  Draco takes him by the hand, and they head to the long bar.  Harry orders them drinks as they consider going back to their table but end up standing there for some time.  People watching.  He introduces Draco to his game of Who’s Who.  It's funny, and not at all unexpected, that he and Draco seem to know entirely different people.  Very few of their picks overlap.
“We’ve not gone on holiday, Mother.”  Draco retorted, causing his mother to lift her brow in disapproval.  “The seal doesn’t need to be removed now or ever.”
When he chose to leave with Astoria, it was an opportunity.  A chance to be his own person.  He believed he would never again return to the country of his birth.  Circumstances change of course.  They always do.  Mother was named the executor of father’s finances a few years after the war.  The moment their assets were unfrozen, she paid off all the remaining reparations.  Every Malfoy holding, stock, and business was gone except for the manor and the oldest Malfoy vault that she saved for herself.  This was fine so far as he was concerned.  He had grown accustomed to caring for himself by that point.  Proud that he was capable of it.
He takes a breath.  “Alright, boys!  Time to go.”
“Whatever will we do next?”  Harry wonders aloud.  He doesn't look outside of them at the people passing.  Eyes only on Draco as his boyfriend moves to kiss him.
It isn’t much different in the first couple months since they started dating.  If anything, it’s worse.  Harry wants and
“I didn’t say anything.”  Harry rebuts cheekily, grabbing Draco by the hips and pulling him so they are both sitting on the rug.  Two silly men sitting on a blue rug in the middle of the loo.
“’Cause she and Dad were married then.”  Albus answers with a beneficent look.  “That was a
The afternoon sun filters in through the curtains as Harry lays down next to Draco, dressed only in his pants.  His boyfriend stripped down to an undershirt and his pants as well.  Allowing Harry to curl around him with little fuss.  Harry is okay with admitting he likes to share a bed.  Likes having someone next to him.  He knows a lot of people do not.  He has heard complaints of hogging covers and cold feet.  But that never bothered him.  It wasn't fair to compare Ginny and Draco, he knew that, but Draco was generally more accommodating to his preference to hold someone while he's sleeping.  Harry felt warm and secure then.  Not unlike one of his children with their favorite stuffies at bedtime.
“Like what?”  Jamie cuts in, curious.
“But how do they get there?”  The boy persists.  Slight frown on his face.
“Conference room three - five minutes.”  Harry states, tossing the offending magazine into the bin.
He'd gotten some use out of his motorbike before the children were born.  Mostly during the period following the second war and the first year of his marriage.  He has a series of nice memories flying solo over the countryside.  Wind whipping through his hair.  Arthur Weasley had done an admirable job repairing the bike.  Fixing it up to its former glory and adding some tricks to its various functions.  His former father-in-law was not remotely at fault for it no longer working.
“Well, count me out of it.”  Ron responds to his sister-in-law, giving Harry a hard look.  “I am too well aware of what Malfoy is like and what he is capable of doing.  Nothing he does can make up for those things.”
“Okay, lets go home.”  Harry agrees blithely.  “Back to your precious mattress.”
“Like what?”  His boyfriend snaps, turning to face him.  Posture tense and arms crossed.
“Yeah?”  He prompts, muscles tensing as he tries to hold himself still.  Senses split between watching his boyfriend stroke himself and the feeling of his own cock hard and aching.  The expression on Draco’s face is dazed.  He suspects his is the same.  Loopy on the sexual tension in the room.  Entranced.  “You want me, sweetheart?”
“And tell them what?”  Draco counters raising a critical eyebrow.  “Why I don’t work for a living?  Where I’ve been the last fifteen years?  Where I come from?  Why a strange man visits me every other weekend?  No.”  He ends shaking his head then taking a sip of his wine.
It is strange how easy Potter can be like they have done this a hundred times before.  Comfortable in his nudity around Draco.  Potter looks over to him with a smirk, resting his head back on Draco’s shoulder.  Draco returns the look, placing his hand on Potter’s chest.  Interested in the feeling of coarse hair and his heartbeat.
When he reflects on the last several months, he is struck by how lucky they are to have their relationship evolve as naturally as it could without wizarding Britain’s scrutiny.  He suspects this was only possible because of Harry’s strong insistence on engaging journalists on his terms.  Usually this meant strictly from his position as deputy head auror commenting on ministry concerns.
He isn’t someone who usually takes holidays – not since his divorce – and before that too if he’s honest.  He does not enjoy a lot of free time and helping Malfoy at least is busy.  He prefers activity and they have a lot to accomplish, but as the week draws to an end it becomes obvious that they’ve done what they needed.  It is simple skills then.  The things he didn’t put a lot of thought into like the fact Malfoy’s never been in charge of feeding and cleaning after himself.  It reminds him of his kids.  Teaching them to be self-sufficient and responsible.
Draco hums.  He makes that noise sometimes Jamie’s noticed.  Jamie interprets it as Draco reminding Dad that he’s won some argument.  Dad just guffaws like it’s the funniest thing.
“A magazine, sir.”  Doge answers immediately, posture at attention where he sits at his desk next to the offending rag.
“It takes years to develop medicinal treatments.  Years of trial and error – mostly error.  The only reason I persisted was because I wanted to help people who have injuries like your father.  Failure can be part of solving a problem.”
“Let’s go.”  Draco announces suddenly, picking up his cloth napkin from his lap and putting it on the table.  “Take me to the nearest food cart, Potter.”
“Yes?”  He prompts after it seems she has paused mid-thought.
Maybe you should stick to your side of the table.  Seeing as you’ve chosen the
“Hello, sir.”
Draco tries not to cringe.  Part of him has thought similarly but another part of him that sounds a lot like Astoria reprimands him for that line of thinking.  There were many ways to be a good mother.  His own was proof enough of that.
“Or you’ll be mine.”  Draco automatically flips it.  But frowns, as he remembers an important someone.  “What about Olta?”
“No, but did it have to happen
“Of course not, liking cock does.”  Draco retorts, laughing in a hysterical burst, then quieting.  The man turns his face back to Harry, resting his head on his knees, tears sliding slowly down his face.  Eyes puffy from crying.  They stare at each other for a while.  Sitting in the stillness.
“The couple over there began arguing for some reason.  Not sure why.  It was rather dramatic when the young lady threw her iced coffee in the man’s face.”  He updates Potter.  The couple had cycled from kissing to argument and back quickly.  Potter missed the second iteration of it.
“Get permission next time, Lily.”  Harry advises.
There is a burst of pain.  He expected it but despite that he is distracted by the hurt and weakness in his body.  His right arm is entirely useless due to the break.  Numb.  His other limbs leaden from being hung aloft for so long.  Blood pooling.  He has minimal control as his body morphs into his animagus form.  Triggered as it was by his conscious thought.  Sinew and bones transforming into his avian form.  Leaving his right wing defective as he tries to get his bearings.
“Who's buried here?” Al questions, holding on to the iron post near the entrance of the Malfoy cemetery.  “Are there ghosts?  I’ve never seen one.”
Lucius looks ghastly.  Draco was prepared for that oddly enough.  Fine, platinum silver hair long and unkempt.  His pale ghost-like frame sharp and thin.  Dark bags under his eyes which appear tired and a bit hazy.  It is his father though.  Draco frowns.  Taking it all in.
“Excuse you, Potter, we got
Ginevra nods.  “My mum wanted a girly girl she could dress up and teach to cook and take care of babies.  I couldn’t be that for her.  I tried for a bit, but it wasn’t right for me.”
“Who I hear was more than a bit of a daredevil.”  Draco retorts, pocketing his wand and going to sit on the wall, legs dangling.  “If my mother and Aunt Bella's stories are to be believed.”
Harry shrugs.  “I’ll show you online later.”
“I gave that figurine to your father as a gift.”  Draco tells him, seeming serious with his pointy face focused on Jamie.  “Did you know that?”
“Not all of them.  Not Harry, of course, but they frighten me.”  Draco continues, speech pressured, and muscle working in his cheek as if he is trying to censor himself.  “They hurt my mother.”
It doesn’t take much to divert his attention once they’re outside.  The field looks great now that it isn’t littered with holes and the wind blowing his hair back as he flies is the best feeling in the world.  They take a break when Olta brings them lunch, but then they are back on the pitch.  Practicing weaving formations and before long it’s time to return.
“You know Molly and Arthur won’t mind, right?”  Hermione remarks looking at him shrewdly.  “Ron didn’t say anything to them if that’s what you’re concerned about.  They want to see you happy too.  If anything, I think Molly would be relieved.”
Harry hums thoughtfully.  Glancing around them.  The staff were closing the place down.  Downstairs was already closed.  It was nearly six am.  He watches Astoria and Simone in discussion by the side of the bar.  Seamus passed out beside them on a stool from the drinking match he got into with Simone.  They should be pleased with the grand opening Harry thinks.
“It isn’t unnatural.”  Draco decides on saying, forcing himself to meet his father’s judgmental gaze.  Draco wonders how he found out.  Father was not supposed to be given much news from the outside and Mother would have told him if she informed Father about it.  He will be having word with the guards after this meeting.
There is a silence, but it isn’t heavy or awkward.  Not like some of the others earlier in the week.
“Quick question though, how do you get chicken satay or fish and chips here?”
“Yes?”  Harry teases.  Enjoying Draco not
“’Mione.”  Weasley cuts in.  “Is this the time?”
He stares at his ex-wife, willing her to hear his words and accept them.  This athletic, intelligent, beautiful woman who used to be the center of his universe.
Draco stares at her.  Taken off guard.  His instinct is to thank her.  Can he thank his boyfriend’s ex-wife for complimenting his relationship?  Is that rude?  This was the part in those novels of Astoria’s he secretly read that the former lover and the current lover would be at each other’s throats.
Draco drags a palm down his front, rumpling his shirt as he goes, causing Harry’s own stomach muscles to clutch in response and one of his tied wrists to twitch.  His cock begins to fill growing interested in the proceedings.
James rolls his eyes, twisting around where he stands in the library.  Raising his hand and spelling out each letter in midair, using the toy wand Draco bought him.  “D. E. M. O. N. S. T. R. A. T. E.”
