They took the portkey which then led to Lupin's office, which Draco was pleasantly surprised to find was well decorated with a thought out lay out. He surveyed it with vague interest, not letting his eyes fall for too long on one thing. Grey stuck close to Draco's legs, clearly agitated at this hideous turn of events. Draco supposed Grey had never needed to use a portkey, him being a kelpie that would most likely be fought and killed on sight.
He was helping them out for the raid, so the least they could do was let him shower and change. He voiced his opinion to the auror, who agreed that he really should be allowed to, just not at the manor. There were only specific apparition points he was allowed to use, apparently.
The ground was wet and coated in layers of mud, but Grey's steps were much surer than Draco's, and he ran on without a problem till he came to he door.
"I suppose it'll have to do. What did you think?" She gave him a cat like look, and Draco knew she wasn't on about Azkaban or the food.
"Mr. Malfoy." An older auror said, walking up to him from the group that was preparing. There were at least fifty, Draco noted. He nodded back at the man. "Your services, I'm sure, Will be invaluable." It was said with withheld rage. Draco was sure the man would very much like to slap him.
He came back a few moments later, holding a small pile of some of his own clothes and a pair of shorts. (It was quite undignified to wash someone, but Draco needed something therapeutic and rhymical.)   Grey looked distastefully at them.
"Come now darling, I was busy." He drawls at her, examining the food. "Don't be too put out." Blaise choked on a laugh. Pansy glared at the pair of them.
"Oh?" Lupin asked, but it was too late, because Grey had already pounced, claws out and hissing loudly. Claws raked through skin, and Lupin it all but threw himself back. "Ah." He said, less pronounced. "I suppose that's why?" Draco didn't even answer, just threw a look at Grey who smiled back. Well, Draco knew he would've if given a human body. He shouldered his luggage again, to make sure it was comfortable. It was not. "Do you have a wand, Draco?" And now Lupin was eyeing him with suspicion. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Serenity. He felt it here again, the cold of the water that was lapping at his neck. He hadn't even realised that he had gotten so deep. But the black water held promise to him, promise to make it stop. He reached for his serenity.
'No.' When he had asked Pansy for a marriage of convenience. She looked so melancholic that she promised him the world and Draco retracted his request. He didn't ever ask again.
"Oh honey," She said rubbing his back as he looked wistfully at the ground. "He just feels betrayed. Listen, I can tell you where he is, if you want to make up with him." She offered, turning to face him with a smile. Draco couldn't stop himself. He wrapped his arms around her a held tightly. It wasn't for a while that he realised he was crying. She murmered quiet words of comfort into his ears as he sobbed. "You know," She laughed. "This is the second twenty two year old I've had crying in my arms in two weeks." For a brief, stupid second, Draco was absolutely stumped.
Draco found it easy to fall into a routine with Narcissa, as he always had, becuase she was steady and forthcoming, and he was always searching for stability in any areas that he could. It was safe and comfortable, and it made him focus on things other than how nice it would be to end his life.
They were supposed to be going shopping, and, as it turned out, there was another 'political' dinner that the three of them would be attending, the perfect time placement for it. They drove in silence through the brightening day, through the bustle of the London traffic and the stress that Narcissa was clearly not coping well with. Familiar scenery came into view.
"Ask if you may have someone over, mother." He said at the door, with his bags packed and Grey waiting a little further down for him. Narcissa smiled graciously. She did that a lot nowadays.
"Draco." Grey said again, rougher this time. He knew people weren't really supposed to be out in cold rain for long periods of time, especially when floating in lakes. He touched Draco's skin. It was ice cold beneath his fingers. Somewhere, he thought if this was what the humans were like before he killed them. His loose morals slipped away.
"Just fine, thanks. Are you ready to head down to breakfast or are we going to be subjected to a long talk about the importance of nail products in school?" Blaise called back, an eyebrow raised. Draco had to supress the need to laugh.
"I'm not sure mother, but I'll call you to confirm." He nodded and stepped out of the car. He always saw her as steady and constant. He now saw her as she had really been all along. A melancholic mother with a son who barely met up to any of his father's expectations, trying to keep herself afloat.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware you wanted to die. I don't have to put this on you; in fact, I'm not obliged to help you at all, I'm doing this all from the goodness in my heart." If Grey could roll its eyes, Draco was sure it would. "Yes, well I'm sure you'd feel like that." He imagined Blaise and Pansy watching him talk to a kelpie. He shoved away their laughter. Actually, he thought, they'd probably just be dull about it. It wasn't as if it were a normal horse that couldn't understand him; Grey understood him perfectly.
"Wouldn't touch a peacock. No meat." The speech patterns seemed rough and unused, and Draco had to remind himself that kelpies spent most of the time in a horse form. "Why am I here? Why help? I don't understand." The tone was vaguely distressed, but not overly so. Draco stopped and turned around slowly. Grey had taken on a stance that was both offering and dominative, a show of gentle submission in the most regal way. Draco knew it well. He let out another sigh.
Nothing moved. The peacocks were gone, but there was still the afterthought of them, the idea of the royal blue. Serenity looked like complete numbness because that's what it was to Draco. It was dying.
It wasn't that he felt threatened, at least not that he believed, but anything could be used against him. Full and half veelas didn't quite have the rights that normal wizards did, and they could often fetch quite the pretty price when sold illegally. There was a reason he knew where to find Grey, after all. Coming down off his adrenaline high, he realised that this might not have been the best idea after all, and he bitterly regretted his heightened sense of defence and the fact that he had been bred on fear. He felt both guilty and too prideful to apologise. He could make the switch, but it really would look odd in perspective.
It was getting darker, though, Draco was quite sure, it had started off very dark. His consciousness grew more and more vacant of coherent thoughts, mind replaced simply by one word: cold. Was he still alive? He couldn't tell.
He walked over to the cage the boy was being kept in; not long enough for him to lie down in, and just tall enough for him to stand up in. The boy looked at him wide-eyed and then glanced down to the lock on the door then back up again. His hands withdrew from the bars and he stepped as far back as the cage would allow, looking still with his pleading blue eyes. The aurors were still to per-occupied to notice Draco snap the lock and open the brittle door.
"What have I missed?" He asked Pansy, still smiling, though it was more amused now as he faced her awed face. She quickly masked her expression and turned to the rest of the hall.
"No, it's nicer black, though if you were to get green highlights I wouldn't stop you." Draco said, taking another sip of red wine. "Anyway, dorm management. How's it going for you, Pansy darling? Heard you got thrown in with Granger." Pansy sighed dramatically, takin her turn to sip the wine.
"Yes Pansy, I'm quite sure that's what it is." The words were, inherently, mocking, and that was surely how Blaise meant them, but he said it with such a straight face that both Pansy and Draco were quite unable to respond, and were also quite unable to contain their laughter, much to their dismay. They both started laughing a little which really seemed to enrage most of the room, especially the Weasel seated next to Potter who's face was as red as his hair.
The auror took his arm gently and led him out of the cell. Just a precaution, the guard had said when Draco had looked disdainfully at the arm on his bicep.
When they arrived at the apparition point, they landed in a field. Draco remembered this field. His blood almost ran cold, but it needn't have because of course, he was here to break the place apart. He didn't even need to get involved, apparently, just point the aurors to where they might find the entrance. He curse his mother who had decided to volunteer him, though he knew it was done to try and boost his status.
"Clean this up." He spat, turning sharply. "Sleep in the second bedroom." This seemed to steel Aidan. Harry couldn't hear the rushed, heaving breaths anymore, though he continued to hear crunching, the altercations of crystal against skin.
"A new mother?" He asked. Lucius came to a stop an knelt before Nikolai so that they were almost at eye level.
I have another au bouncing around my head which really does not help my writing for this. It's a single dad Draco au, so let me know if you want it released earlier, becuase I'll probably try to finish this and my 36 questions fic before I release it.
He still remembered the look on his father's face when he saw Nikolai for the first time. It hurt more than scar running down his chest and seemed to compress his heart uncomfortably. His father had looked upon him which such unbridled joy that Nikolai had found it hard not to run to him, to envelop him in a hug. He remembered everything his father had said, even though he had not yet spoken the language.
"And why is it going to be disposed of?" He asked, trying to regard the kelpie with feigned disinterest. The man raised an eyebrow.
"You're crying." He told Draco, who then, stupidly, felt for tears on his face. "No." Lucius said sharply, looking very much like he could shoot Draco in the ribs and be a happier man. "Cry. Narcissa, won't you be a good mother and comfort him?"
"If you bite me, I will kill you." He said, holding the bridle just outside of the bars. Both could see the fragments of truth, and Grey knew it would be a death sentence if it bit Draco.
Harry began to cry again, because true to the note, in the jewellery box were many small slips of paper with writing on them. He picked one up.
Draco found that his eyes were harder to wrench open than he had thought they would be, harder to uncover what lay before them. His head hurt and his body was stiff. (Dissociation, as the healers would later call it. Complete loss of the conscious for granted periods of the time, during which he was still aware of memories and ideas.) The glamour had held, though, he thought whilst glancing down at his hands, forcing them up to the tips of his ears.
At the end of the week, just as he had promised, Lucius took Draco to go and meet Narcissa for the first time. Draco had been living of the highs of joy, as if nothing could dull the shine in his eyes. Only Lucius called him Draco so far, though he had told them his name was going to change from Nikolai. Lucius had shown up, immaculate as ever, and Draco had put on the new clothes that had been bought for him and were 'more fitting  for a Malfoy'.
Lupin sighed, but it wasn't out of annoyance or disappointment, and it wasn't aimed at Draco, as far as he could tell. It was the kind of sigh one made when broaching a large topic that they really didn't ant to. He dropped his hand and folded his arm around his body, a shield protecting him from whatever invasive questions might come. He saw a perfect picture of them in his mind.
"Hello Draco," Lupin greeted warmly. "Is that a new cat with you?" Draco blinked at him, trying to suss out if his motives lined up with what he believed to be 'moral'. It wasn't that he held a profound disliking for the man, he just felt as though there was something else there in his personality. It creeped him out. (this was not the werewolf thing. Draco, to be honest, was perfectly happy with that.)
When Lucius had left, he had pondered the idea of Nikolai's heritage. Of course, he was Calina's son, and so there was no question about the fact he was a half-breed. This did displease Lucius, but it also did have its own advantages. In his childish features, it was already clear that he was not, in fact, a normal wizard. His skin was as pale as Lucius', even paler perhaps, and seemed to possess the glow of the moon. His hair was blond, unnaturally silky and also seemed to glow lightly, even in the dim of the room and just through the edges of it, the glimpse of ears that were longer and more pointed than any humans should have been. Lucius had grey eyes, and so did Nikolai, though they looked more to him like the iridescent of perhaps an opal stone.
"I was right, wasn't I? It is Draco?" She asked, clearly doubting either her pronunciation or Harry's version of the story.
Here it is! He finally gets to make his big entrance like the drama queen he is! I have been fantasizing about this scene for ages, and here it finally is, in all of its glory.
I do apologise for the lengths of these chapters, but it's the only way I really feel able to structure it safely without falling apart. Warning! Death is referenced a lot in this, so please don't read if you are uncomfortable with that! This is also purely Draco centric.
"See, they aren't as bad as the Weasel or Potter, but at least you're in a room together. Me and Blaise have had to spend all our time in the library section of the common room to avoid people, which I know Blaise hates to do." She said, looking like she was trying very hard to focus on her food, but her gaze kept drifting to Draco. Blaise looked rather haughty.
They sat on picnic rugs strewn across the grass, lying haphazardly across each other as they passed around the bottles, talking about everything and nothing, about all the things they couldn't talk about under the blanket of sobriety.
"Do you recon he's too stunned by your devilishly good looks to answer?" Pansy said sideways to him after a moment of s sort of staring contest.
"Couldn't say. Civility is, after all, a foreign word to both Potter and Weasley. I assure you though darling, we'll be just fine." Draco drawled, blinkingly lazily as he examined the artwork on the walls.
"Fur?" Draco asked. The kelpie looked thoroughly pissed off for something that was soon to be executed for simply existing. They'd of course argue that kelpies were dangerous and a hazard, and that there was nothing that they could do for it, and they'd of course get away with it. It nuzzled the bars and almost everything before blinking at Draco, looking directly at his eyes. "Ah." Draco said. "Grey, then?" Grey, apparently, rolled its eyes and gave a small gesture that might have been a horse nodding. "Well Grey, I'm Draco, and I'd say we're in a similar situation." Grey cocked its head. "I'm a little fucked, too. Just got out of prison about two hours ago." Grey gave him a look that Draco really didn't want to interpret.
Throwing himself up, he let out a sigh. As a privilege, eighth years were allowed to wear whatever they want within certain guidelines (Draco was almost certain that these guidelines were enforced because of Pansy and Blaise, and he was also well aware that they would be the only two to defy them.) He had taken full advantage of this and was wearing his favourite trench coat, black shirt and trousers, a Slytherin tie loose around his neck. There were more than a few rings adorning his skeletal fingers, long necklaces around his neck, and many more piercings. (He had allowed Grey to figure it out, after all, he had a wand to fix any wrong punctures.)
"No, we aren't. Pansy doesn't have to know, it's just... Something that happens now. Let's not, ok?" Draco turned to Blaise at the end, all soft eyes and washed out features. Blaise didn't respond for a good minute, eyes sad and on the floor. He was moping, only slightly, but Draco let him. It would only take a moment for Blaise's eyes to find him again, only a few short seconds that held him prisoner to this stilted conversation.
"How dare you. These bags under my eyes accentuate my good looks and make all the women desire me. Ever heard of case project?" He asked, and to his credit, he did not sound in the least bit lacking, just normal. Pansy gave him an almost pitying look before she grabbed his glass of red wine.
"Perfect." Draco said, and he climbed through the curtains and onto the bed where Blaise quickly flopped back down onto the pillows, groaning at the early morning. Draco cast a quick '
"Hello, Draco." Harry Potter said. Draco looked at the window and smiled, small and sad. The door shut and footsteps approached, full of longing and desperation, taken with hesitant joy. He was trying to gauge Draco's reaction, to see who he had become, to see if had even changed.
"I'm fine, thank you mother. How are you?" He wasn't fine. They both knew that. He was quite frankly surprised she was even touching him, given the state of himself.
Random fact about this chapter: I did mention about basing the Slytherin's relationship on the relationship I have with my brother, so I really hope you can see here in what parts this is not true. I actually drew out a room plan for the common room so that I could actually write consistently, and now my search history is absolutely convinced I am rich because all I have been looking up is effectively 'expensive furniture', 'expensive clothing brands' etc, (had to do this for Draco's gifts last chapter) so if I'm being traced, they will be coming for my bank account. Oops.
"Mother, welcome back." He said graciously, meeting her at the front door and embracing her gracefully.
There. He grabbed the object in front of him with his mind's eye. Everyone was standing behind him, he was at no danger of having them see his face. The glamor in just his eyes dropped, revealing their silver iridescence and he whistled once for Grey to come. He obeyed.
"Alcohol." Blaise said simply and loudly, a wide stupid grin on his face which vanished quickly when a Hufflepuff fifth year walked past them, tripping on her long robes as Pansy glared at her with cat eyes.
"Rumour has it that it was because of Pansy that this rule was created, because they didn't want to give her an entire bathroom whilst the others had to share." Blaise snarked, just loud enough to be heard by Pansy who hit him.
He hit the bed with a small thud, sighing into the open air around him, long exhales that still could not convey the proper affections for the pair of them. Draco wanted to lay there, forever possibly, but he had wasted enough time as was of his precious hour alone, and it was time to leave the safety of his bed and venture into civilisation. But alas, that just was not the way that his ego rolled. If he left now and walked in an amble, he'd be fashionably late, show up in style. The way he always did.
They ran the bath again, pleasingly hot, Draco was sure, but he spent it in agony, writhing on in the thin puddles of the water where the shock of the warmth felt like the white hot metal of branding. Grey held his hand, an unsaid gesture.
"Yes. I'm sure you will love her very much," Lucius breaths came out in clouds of steam, because it was night in a Russian winter. Nikolai had always wanted a complete family. He didn't dare say anything that could jeopardise himself. "She even has a new name for you," Lucius had smiled, turning Nikolai around gently so that they were both facing the same way, and had pointed up at the sky over his shoulder. "Up there, there's a huge sky dragon," He had explained, using practiced wandless magic to connect the dots before Nikolai's eyes. "It's called Draco." Nikolai had understood that.
"This is going to happen weekly, due terms of your parole. Two hours every Sunday just to make sure you're on track, and we're also going to be treating it as a sort of mind therapy. I know you've been through a lot." Lupin's gaze was so warm and comforting that Draco just wanted to live in it, to relish behind it's heat and pretend that there were no ulterior motives in that gentle smile. He couldn't afford to, though, that's what had helped him get this far, but he couldn't quite bring himself to respond.
They had joked many times since the engagement on details, all of which had sounded like meaningless apparitions in the air of love, but here they all were, carefully written down in what Harry was sure to be Draco's finest calligraphy. He put the box and note away, still weeping softly, and opened the bedroom door.
Azkaban, Draco decided, really was worse than Malfoy manor. At least in Malfoy manor he had the option to off himself whenever he so pleased. He couldn't here. Not safely. Not without the guilt following him to the next life, if there was one.
The common room was nice enough; large and comfortable, decorated with regalia's from all of the houses, colours intertwined with crests. It appeared to have elements of all houses in there, the large fireplace surrounded by comfy sofas, a small library dedicated area with writing desks, instalments of many magical and non-magical plants and flowers and the grand high ceilings and tall windows he recognised from Slytherin. Grey looked up at him, cocking his head.
"Dick." Pansy said, glowering in the Gryffindor direction. "Still, it's not worth risking it for your honour Draco, we know you lost it the day you slept with Blaise for the first time." Draco at that point was halfway between throttling her and laughing, and Blaise seemed to be having a similar dilemma. "Oh, come on boys, don't loose your tongues, it's just an insult." And then her smirk matched Draco's previous one, and she looked very smug, proud of herself.
The grip around his ribs grew tighter, harder to breathe in, but as the memory faded more so and he was left with the present, he realised it was less because of the tight hold on him, and more to the fact he was about halfway between crying and panicking, but either way, he just couldn't breathe.
"Draco." His voice was steadier, less marred with sleep. Draco had no idea how he'd managed to wake up underneath the covers like that, but it was a quality that he bizarrely seemed to posses.
"You get to keep him." Sam said, patting Draco's shoulder. Grey looked like he wanted to kill Sam, to create and uprising, but he stayed perfectly tense and rigid.
"Well, you're a bit fucked then, aren't you?" He drawled out, leaning glacially against a table opposite the cage. The kelpie glared furiously at him and snorted, though Draco could sense its fear. There was nothing he was supposed to be doing as such, he had only had to lead them to the market, not help with their fucking clean up. It wasn't his job. And so, like any sane person, he started talking to the kelpie. "You know, I've never actually met a kelpie. Do you even have a name?"
Leaving for Hogwarts was harder when he had already established a routine, and harder when he would have to bring Grey along with him. Another element of difficulty was leaving his mother alone in the manor. For the month that he was in Azkaban for, his mother was supervised by aurors, more civil ones, and one of whom was Sam, to Draco's great joy and surprise, who would at least have kept her entertained.
"I've been thinking." She said, carefully, as though it might not be the right thing to say. "About that man your father spoke to you about. The man you shared a flat with?" She must've seen his change in posture, because her approach got softer, kinder. More careful, he thought. "I can take you to see him."
Happy New Years!! I know I'm a little late, but here we are. Here's to hoping 2021 goes better that 2020, and that you've all had a better start to the year than me (yikes.)
Draco did his best to gather his wits as well he could while lying in a bath after almost accidently drowning himself. He seemed to remember the sensation of lying on a bathroom floor and trying to gather himself. It felt the same. He blanked out Harry's screams.
"I'm sure." He muttered. Harry didn't seem to mind so much, pushing harder into Draco, one hand on his waist, the other on his neck, tracing glimpses of his collar bone with his thumb steadily.
He strode down the elegant pathways, and it felt like he was being funnelled down toward his doom by the high bushes. A grey cat emerged from one of the bushes and trotted alongside him, a cat Draco recognised as a Russian blue, purely because of a cat obsession that Pansy had gone through in forth year. His stomach dropped as he left the grounds of Malfoy manor, becuase standing there at the designated collection point was no other than Remus Lupin.
"Are you feeling better? Sorry to startle you." Draco hated that tone, hated that it was being used on him. Pitying and fearful. Lupin looked so reminisce that Draco was sure in his mind he looked a lot more like Sirius Black than he looked like the lunatic veela, Draco Malfoy. He scowled at Lupin, letting his glamour wash back over him, let it settle like an awkward jumper around his features and peculiarities.
He lay there for a few moments, breathing heavily. The sound stopped, but now he was astutely aware of a stabbing pain in this arm and head, the bruised feeling of his body. Bringing his arm up to his face revealed just red, warm and metallic dripping off his fingers.
"Um, ok?" It wasn't posed as a question, but it was a clear social signal of 'please go away now, it's two in the fucking morning' The smaller man had pulled out a photo. Harry's heart had dropped. It was a picture of Aidan, only he looked a bit younger, and he was wearing a suit, glowering unhappily at the camera.
"You mean it?" He asked, long arms wrapping around Draco's chest. He put his head back to let it rest on Grey's shoulder, closing his eyes.
Grabbing Draco's shoulders, he shouted loudly for him to wake up, then shook his shoulders violently. No flicker of life. The muted pink that was more really of a grey had faded completely from Draco's cheeks, deathly pale and still shallow.
Everything still seemed slow and heavy, like waking up after sleeping for too long. The type where you only just manage to drag yourself out of the bed, even though you want to stay in the warm embrace of the bed longer. Draco looked upon death with fond admiration; he had no reason to fear it, and left the cold skeletal fingers that held him. It was easier the second time, he realised somewhere in his psyche.
"Had about a month to perfect it. Not much else to do in Azkaban." He felt Blaise stiffen beneath him as he mentioned it, but he did not pen his mouth against Draco, just tightened his arms gently again and squeezed, pressing a small kiss to Draco's neck.
"Bitch." He said, and swiped her ornate glass of wine, copying her actions. Blaise laughed across the table at both of them as they chugged the contents of the glasses with eye contact all the while. They all laughed a small while, the sound filling the air around them, unnerving those who sat too close, because, well, what could they be laughing about? They were Slytherins, after all. Draco felt a certain pair of eyes burning into the back of his head, and, not being one to resist temptation turned around with a smirk on his face, wine glass in hand. Harry Potter was staring at him from two tables away surrounded by other Gryffindor's who meant Draco less than well. "Would you like a picture Potter? You could add it to your stalking album." He called out across the sea of voices, many hostile. Pansy gave a small giggle beside him, more to encourage him than anything else, and Blaise was staring in a rather different way, more a glare than anything that did not match Draco's smirk.
"Now, now Pans, don't go all high and mighty after just one insult." Blaise tutted, and it was in that arrogant way he did when he knew his opponent had no real answer to come back with. Predictably, Pansy didn't answer and turned to Draco, blocking Blaise out.
"Why did you run away?" She asked. It was the third time she had asked the question. Not since he arrived back at the manor, but for the third time in his life. Once when he was ten, anther when he was fifteen and now again and he was twenty two. He was pathetic. But, he was older now and his mother knew him more. The cold of the air and the biting of the frost gave him numbness, subdued his emotions.
He didn't faint. He didn't black out. He just- stopped. He stood there, blank behind the eyes and watched everything unfurl around him with no reaction.
"It's a kelpie." He replied, as if that was enough explanation. The kelpie looked cautiously, no longer rearing, but pressing itself against the back of the cage. Draco made a noncommittal sound and the man nodded, turning away.
"You make it sound like I'm concerned about you." Pansy said hotly, and she crossed her arms again and sped up, but only fractionally so, leaving her deaf to the conversation that was now happening behind her.
We will be returning to Hogwarts in the next chapter, but for now, here's some of Narcissa and Draco's relationship for you after the quite awful first meeting that they had! Sorry that it's a bit of a shorter chapter, my life is absolutely hectic at the moment!
Draco was a man who, more often than not, got what he wanted. It was in his personality, in his blood, for he had been bred in a  certain way that let his capabilities fall outside of taking no for an answer. Still, throughout his still somewhat short life, he had been told 'no' numerous times, too many to count, but the more significant ones were easy to recall in plain sight.
"Mother, I-" But he was far too high to have this conversation. He looked away, but as he did, he saw his father pick up a picture. Now Draco was by no means an idiot, quite the opposite really, but this had really been a major forthcoming of himself.
The beating hadn't been as bad as he originally thought it would be, for, he had run away for over six months with a sizeable portion of money. Politics, Draco guessed. Must be something coming up.
A little more organised this time, and happy new years! I have to say, after the shit show of 2020, I don't know how much worse it can get, but I'm hoping for a brighter year. (despite this, I have really stepped up my funeral wear game, so I'm prepared in any scenario.)
"Just walking." He said, marvelling at the way his voice didn't shake or quiver. He looked as haughty as he could, but it was hard when the person he was giving it too looked so pitying and had only ever given him kind memories and gentle thoughts.
The talk was polite an civil, hostile in the way it avoided anything serious, anything that mattered. Draco watched his mother with eyed curiosity and decided, eventually, to broach the topic of his father.
Could it be? A comfort character who was supposed to be edited out has returned from the depths of creative hell? Apparently so. This is more plot coming together (hopefully) and more action for your benefit!
He spent the rest of his precious hour unpacking, placing personal effects on the carved walnut surfaces, surprised to find that some items already littered it, items wrapped in silver tissue paper. Draco smirked to himself, gathering the five items and seating himself on his new bed. There was a note attached, beneath the items which he unwrapped with practiced eagerness.
"Well then, it's been a thing my entire life. Don't know if you know, but you don't get bitten by veelas in the same way you get bitten by werewolves." He said rather cynically, and he was pleased in the drawl it came with. Lupin, to his credit, looked only slightly put out. "My mother's side. She was a full blood veela."
"I don't know who they were, darling! I promise!" He sounded like he was begging. He walked forwards more, and that was when Harry realised what was making the crunching sound. Aidan hadn't picked up the chattered champagne and he wasn't wearing socks. Blood was sweeping over the tiled floor. Harry hadn't the energy or the mental capacity to deal with it.
After a while, he gathered his fragile pieces together in a somewhat put together image, and strode up to the door, ringing the bell once he was within range. From one of the bedrooms he heard movement and noise, which was mainly his dad asking who the fuck was going to call in at four in the morning. There was also stirring from one of the spare rooms, mingled voices that he knew to be Remus and Sirius also announcing their annoyances loudly.
They were six simple steps, and yet he couldn't seem to get past the first one, because when he opened the safe that neither of them ever used, save for storing bank details and passports, he found a note and a jewellery box. Harry's breath caught in his throat as he carefully unwrapped the note.
"You little miracle worker. You know, it never ceases to amaze me when you show your talents." Blaise grinned, the sort of secret grin one would have once finding out gossip, a juicy secret. Pansy practically glowed at the praise. "I mean, who would have thought?"
Writing to Harry was probably both the easiest and hardest task, and was performed in the comfort of his own parlour whilst Grey messed around absently with a cushion that Draco had already pointed out several times as being designer.
"Love, what's wrong? Where's Aidan?" His mum asked, pushing forward slightly, looking far more awake than his dad, and then he was a twenty two year old crying into his mother's arms as she gently rubbed his back. "Harry, what's happened?" Her voice was quiet and soothing, and none of the men looked like they really know what to do. Harry wasn't sure what to do either.
"I beg your pardon?" He asked, clipped and precise. Grey shrugged, but didn't take his eyes off Draco.
Grey seemed bigger when he wasn't in the cage, more wild too. His mane was unkept and knotted same as his tail, and most of his coat appeared to smeared with dirt and blood. Someone should have really told them that when selling something, make sure it looks its best. Draco put his hands up, ready to be braced against soft fur, just like he used to do with Ursa. Grey turned his head to the side, watching him with just one eye. Draco glared at him. The eyes burnt into the back of his head. He knew what happened when he failed. He knew he had to do anything necessary, anything, hurt anyone to succeed. If he could just have enough control and-
"Merlin, I see what you mean," He said as they sat in and around a large green armchair surrounded by bookshelves, lit by green lamps mounted to the walnut. "They're all fucking crazy about you being in here." Blaise was the one who was occupying the armchair, really, whilst Pansy lounged gracefully on the floor, one hand on Draco's knee, the other folded across Blaise's thigh so that she might have better purchase to lay her head delicately there. Draco had opted for perching on the armchair's wide arm, one leg more dangling off the side than anything, one arm wrapped around the back of Blaise's shoulder, leaning in, the other messing with his long blond hair in the flattering light.
Angst! Just when you thought you were safe! Tw for panic attacks and suicide - please don't read if you are uncomfortable with either of those. This chapter is quite short, but that's because there is more to come tonight!
"So, what did you think of the common room and dorms?" Blaise asked as they walked on up the staircases.
Lucius Malfoy, however, always got his way, and Draco wasn't going to stand in the way of that, lest he become an obstacle himself.
The first time he had died, he had been painfully aware of it, but he hadn't panicked, and he hadn't been panicking. It wasn't quite calm, either. This time, nothing came to him. It was too cold to think. He didn't remember closing his eyes, but after all, he hadn't. They were still open and faced to the sky, pure gems in the tragedy of youth.
He could not forget him in the way that he revelled around his own heart, the kind of way that seemed to light his body on fire, send ghosts of shivers down his skin. He knew everything about Draco Malfoy, and that included the uncomfortable truth that Draco did not love him back, not in the way that Harry wished he would.
The room to was nicer than he expected. It was spacious and tall, high ceilings sheltering the four poster beds which were arranged in a sort of square, on in each corner. The two on the right side had been taken, clearly by Weasley and Harry with the amount of red and gold that hung off them. The one in left corner with the window view was the only one that had yet to be claimed, by the looks of it, though the curtains were drawn. Grey was taking in the sights of the room, wandering about it before setting down the luggage next to the vacant bed.
"Why, if you wanted to negotiate the terms, I would be quite happy to agree to certain conditions." Grey snorted. The kelpie was fucking laughing at him. Sam appeared to be thinking for a moment, before coming to a conclusion.
"Who are you?!" He yelled, and Aidan looked stricken, mouth parted slightly, and as close as Harry had ever seen him to tears. Harry had never seen Aidan cry. It was as unnerving as it was infuriating.
"Ah." Draco said again. His hands shook. Grey looked terrified, and stuck its head through the gap in the bars, throwing it around. Draco took its head in his hands and stroked it gently. He hummed, more to himself than anything really, a song he remembered from Russia, a haunting melody that accompanied his dreams at night.
"What the fuck is it." But his voice came out weird, not flat, like the laugh was, broken but still playing. The two men who were inevitably stood outside it side stepped. Despite the fact that he was high off his ass, this thought alone was enough to almost sober him. The syringe shattered at his feet.
"Bloody hell. Bloody hell. He's not dead is he?" Another voice asked, though there was scorn mixed in with his concern which sounded like it was less about empathy and more about himself. Draco didn't like that voice.
As soon as he was out, the aurors directed him to the side-along apparition point, but made note not to touch him. They were still very close, of course, but they didn't touch him. The auror who'd taken him from Azkaban (Sam, Draco remembered) smiled at him from Draco's left side. It wasn't cruel though, it was warm.
"Go look out that window there." Draco said, nodding to one of the large sweeping panels. Footsteps shuffled away to go inspect the view. "Do you see that large forest?"
"I thought it looked to expensive and silky to have been done by the school. Merlin, that's what I was going to ask, how are the roommates?" Blaise's grin turned into a vaguely unamused and contemplative frown.
"Oh, you know me so well." Draco reached through the curtains, drawing them back slowly, slipping out and not even wincing when the cold stone met his feet. On Blaise's desk was only one roll of parchment, so Draco took that to be it and nabbed it. "Alright, want me to read this to you?" He asked once back inside the safety and warmth of the bed's curtains.
There was a dementor out there, floating by the opening of the next cell along with the door flung open. The man was still screaming as he was dragged on his knees out of the open door by another two dementors who showed no sign of care. Draco blanched. It was Fenrir Greyback. He hadn't realised who had been next to him, but had no right to feel sorry for the man who had tortured him countless times. He felt a growl build up in the back of his throat, tongue touching on teeth that definitely weren't human. He supressed the feeling. Greyback screamed and begged, but the dementors didn't do anything other than continue their methodical path down the corridors.
"You've always loved the manor and the grounds." Narcissa said quietly, as if she were doubting her entire view on Draco.
"May we dismiss you, or shall you be joining us for dinner?" Draco asked them as he and Narcissa detached gracefully. Neither of them were Sam, and Draco bitterly wished he was there. It was a sour looking woman who looked to be in her mid forties with a high ponytail hairstyle that did not suit her at all, and what appeared to be a fledgling auror boy, and Draco supposed he was only around twenty.
"Let it go." He hissed at Blaise. His shoulders sagged sadly, and he gazed at Draco with sorrowful eyes, as if he were the one confessing his sadness.
"What do you mean, 'A while'?" He asked cautiously, both itching to snatch his hand away from Lupin and also to relax into the gesture, let himself believe Lupin wanted to help, to be someone else he could rely on. He left it stiff in Lupin's gentle hold. Lupin looked a little confused.
"Unless you would much rather walk around in my presence dressed like that." He said it with as much distaste as he possibly could, though he didn't truly mind. It wasn't as if anyone other than them were in the house, and Grey did have a nice body. Though that, he supposed, was also due to the kelpie's natural enhanced beauty. A low growl rose in the back of Grey's throat, but it was neither malicious, nor did it make itself prominently known.
"I'm sure it will. Merlin knows how long it would've taken without someone to show you." It was said so that it might be an insult, but Draco let it sound pleasant so that the man could do nothing but glare. No-one asked how he knew where it was.
A rippling murmur tore through the students like a wildfire as he strode through the hall, feigning nonchalance, a hushed cheer from many of the Slytherins. He did not make eye contact with anyone, instead keeping them forward facing and glinting through the artificial sky and candle glow. Echoing steps reverberated around the walls as his shoes hit the stone, coat almost billowing around him. He kept the smirk on his face. Image was power, and power was divine.
Harry had been out walking Padfoot around St. James' park, because his Godfathers were staying over for a few weeks and had decided to bring their dog along. Padfoot was a huge black retriever, much to his Godfather Sirius' disappointment, for he had wanted some huge shaggy dog to, and he quotes, 'fetch him the souls of the damned.'. His husband Remus had fortunately intervened and threatened divorce if Sirius did get a dog like that and teach it to attack people.
"I've missed you too." Draco whispered back, taking her hand and kissing it softly. He felt eyes burning into him as the three of them strolled past to the rooms, all muted chatter shutting off completely in favour of glaring at the death eater scum that stood before them. Draco lifted his head up airily and didn't give them the time of day.
Quite how he found himself in his next dilemma, he was unsure of. He was dressed hurriedly but well, a long cloak fastened at the base of his neck, the large jewel sitting there comfortably and cold, as the feel of metal against skin often is. He was standing at the top of the stairs, that he knew, but how he got there feigned mystery, for he could not think through the panic. Someone was screaming. He clutched his ears hoping to block out the sound, but instead it grew louder, shriller. He ran to escape the sound, but poor judgment and the dizzying fear that gripped him clouded his vision, and he fell before he was barely halfway down.
"Mm, no. I was just teasing. You shall live out your days as my faithful house cat." He muttered. "Let me go, I need to move this stuff up this staircase." Grey dutifully un wound his arms from Draco, and picked up the bags and headed up the stairs first. "Ah, such a good kelpie." He mused, following.
When waking up, Draco liked to be perfect, to look perfect in the case of anyone being there, and so upon waking up, he sat up slowly, beautifully, and stretched with yawning joints and yearning thoughts. He was glad to find himself in the solace of his own bed, the silk sheets beginning to pool at his waist as he slowly roused, but could not think for the life of him upon how he came to be there. Blaise, thankfully was not in his bed, and he could hear the slow sounds of breathing from across the room drifting above the long curtains of the bed, noises which he knew belonged to him.
"I'm not going to hurt you Draco, I just want to make sure you're ok. Calm down, and we can talk this out." He said slowly, as if talking to a wild animal that might bolt at any moment. "I'm not going to tell anyone." Clearly he though that this had come up all of a sudden, as though Draco wasn't born to someone who wasn't Narcissa Malfoy, someone who had somehow turned into a veela over night and was desperately grappling with the changes. Draco was sure his eyes were wild.
"Fine, alright, don't forget about it, but what happens in this room can now henceforth stay in this room. I'm afraid the jury's out, and I'm not taking questions at this time."
The door opened to his dad wearing a dressing gown and bleary look, his mum behind him accompanied by his Godfather's.
"I'll leave you here?" Sam asked reluctantly. Draco gave him a look that he had perfected over the years, a look that said: 'If you don't leave me the fuck alone in the next two minutes, I might snap your neck.' His words were perfectly civil, though.
Steps echoed around him, couples, singles, runners, families. It was all so loud. He pushed the panic to the back of his mind and steeled himself against emotions he had convinced himself that he simply didn't have the capacity to feel.
They had side-a-longed to the outside of an expensive looking manor, and it had been the first time Draco had really seen the extent of his new wealth. Lucius had taken his hand and led them to the grand oak door, which Draco remembered purely because it was the largest door he had ever seen at that point in his life. It no longer seemed very big to him. He had let Lucius go ahead in front of him, for he was scared of what may lie on the other side of the door. He was right to be.
"What happened to 'potentially dangerous'?" Draco's expression darkened sourly and he exchanged a look with Grey, mouthing the word: 'busted'.
"About what, sweetie?" She took his shoulders in her hands so he was looking into her eyes. Harry would have thought this almost comical had he not just dumped his fiance a couple hours earlier, because the three men had stuck their heads so that they were craning to see him from behind Lily's.#
"Sure." He said, and his voice was the most perfect, most beautiful thing Harry had heard to this day.
"You'll find him here." She said, handing the note to him. Draco tried to regard it with as little interest as possible, but he only achieved looking at with the longing of all the Kings of Greece looked at Helen.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy. You'll be our proper son, then, in name as well." Lucius hadn't been looking at him, but Nik-Draco had been able to tell he was smiling. It contained a family name, his father's name, and he had loved. Unconditionally. The joy of course, was yet to meet its obstacle.
It was around three o'clock in the afternoon when Harry's letter (and parcel) arrived at the manor. Both Grey and Draco had managed to finish all of their tasks early, making lunch an easy affair that was this time hosted in Draco's parlour in front of a young fire. Upon seeing the owl, Draco had set down his plate and excused himself to the privacy of his own bedroom to read the letter.
"Want some?" Lupin asked, offering rather a large bar of chocolate to him. Draco blinked in surprise.
"Mm, very much not. I'm quite alright, though the offer was nice enough. Perhaps you could avoid altercations like this if you kept your mouth shut and eyes to yourself." He drawled the first part out almost lazily, like he would have a few years ago, but he made sure his insult had enough bite to be an underlying threat, outline that he was not one to cross without saying it. Great many English teachers give the singular advice of 'show, not tell', and this is exactly how Draco deployed his speech. Make sure you're a known threat without going around and beating people up. The Weasel seemed to have no viable response and so muttered something that sounded a lot like 'Slytherin scum' and turned around again.
"Draco, darling," Blaise said, in the tone he used when he wanted something, wanted something specific. Overly posh in the way he always talked, with the trace of a slight whine that Pansy often used. "I want something."
"Don't you have a lake?" Grey asked. He turned his head so that his body was facing Draco. He had been made to sit on a foot stool (a comfortable one) because Draco was not sitting on his bed and braiding hair like eleven year old girls.
"Hello, Harry." He said, evenly, calculated. He would not step a single toe out of line, not in this first encounter. Harry paused briefly behind him. Carry on as usual, Draco was sure that was the thought going through Harry's head, because he knew that Draco hated to dwell too long on meaningless things, and that the only reason he should ever bring it up was if Draco himself had started the conversation on a sanctioned topic.
"Get away from me!" Draco hissed, flailing back and tripping on the chair. Grey, whose presence he had forgotten, made at Lupin, snarling and hissing, batting at his face. "Stay back!" Lupin's eyes were wide, but to his credit, he seemed to get a hold of himself rather quickly, holding his hands up in surrender.
He had been seated on a bench, letting the sun and warm breeze tickle his face, letting the other noises fade into the background. It was a warm July, the proper kind of summer that one would fantasize about.
"Yes, lets. We can go to the common room and I'll smuggle out the whiskey, and you two can figure out where we're sitting." Pansy said, not waiting for confirmation and standing up. Blaise walked around to their side as Draco got up, and the three of them strode towards the door, whispers following their steps. The group of third years blocking the door quickly moved out the way as they approached it, murmuring amongst themselves. None of them said anything outright and seemed particularly obedient, but their eyes held malice that they dared not show. Draco pulled his lips into a sneer, but let it not grace their presence, walking past in a swirl of coat and white-golden hair.
"I can take you to Malfoy manor, if you want. I'm going to be your parole auror anyway." Draco wanted to ring his eyeballs out of his skull. A fucking parole auror. He wondered how eager they were to get rid of him. He disguised his disgust with a mildly disinterested glance at Sam's robes.
Draco had spent the first week trying not to get sepsis. It really had been a bad fucking idea to walk across literal broken glass to get to Harry. A bit of an oversight, he told himself. He forgot to eat most of the time, and when he did, it was very little. Mostly, he just spent hours ghosting around the empty grounds of the small flat, which was, for the first time since they had purchased it, void of love. Harry had taken the bank details, he knew that because the safe was open. He had also read the note, opened the box, and once Draco had realised that, he'd left the house for the first time since Harry had left.
"Grey's not potentially dangerous." Draco drawled out, aggressively posh. He had to admit that an old fall back strategy was to fall heavily upon his father's heritage, though he suspected that this was more to do with the accent being beaten into him, and most times his aggression appeared to be aimed at his father, and needed to have a safe fall back. "Think about it really; aren't they the victim in this situation?" Sam, to his great surprise, laughed.
"Whatever you need, Draco." Lupin said, doing exactly that, hands still braced in front of himself. It both annoyed and enthralled Draco that this was the reaction he might've provoked from Lupin. Once he felt the distance was great enough, that he was confident any blow or mis-intended for his health could be easily dodged, he let himself relax. Claws retracted, teeth became more human, great horns forgotten.
Here we dive into their first week apart! If you are so far enjoying the story, or think that there are things I can improve on, please do leave a comment because I love reading your thoughts!
Draco wasn't sure at what point he got up and left, but he must've, because the next time he came too, he was standing in front of the lake. It was freezing as he walked into it, and he didn't even know why he was doing it. Part of him wanted to run away to his mother's warm embrace in her parlour where the fire was always warm, and the other part wanted to sink to the bottom of the lake where he wouldn't have to feel anything any more.
"Oh, Draco." She said, manoeuvring them so that they were instead facing the lake, not facing each other. "What happened? Harry's still... A bit put out. He won't tell us anything beyond, well, the basics."
"HE IS NOT MY SON!" Narcissa screamed, shrilly. She was halfway between crying and blowing someone up. "NOR WILL I EVER TREAT HIM LIKE ONE!" And it was at that point that Lucius snapped to. He slapped her so hard that she fell to the floor and clutched at her face. She panted and lifted her chin to look at him. Tears were running down her cheeks. Draco watched horrified from the corner he had curled up into with wide eyes. It didn't need words, and apology or an explanation. It wasn't even followed by Lucius screaming at her some more. He turned sharply on his heel and strode away purposefully. Narcissa let her head drop.
"She saw you in an alcove, apparently you appeared to be in significant pain and slumped against the wall." Ah. He did remember that. It wasn't even an altercation, really, just a birthday present. In fairness, it was the strongest birthday present he had ever recieved. He gripped the wand in his pocket firmly. The moonstone and opal were cold against his skin, jagged but forgiving.
'No.' When he had asked his father if he was allowed to play with the other children, who, at the time, looked like a lot of fun. This was really only memorable becuase those children had happened to be a part of the group called 'The Snakes', and who grew up to be Draco's best friends.
"Your uh- your wand was broken." He at least had the guile to look guilty about it. Draco rolled his eyes.
Still sorry about the chapter lengths - as these are mainly backstory and scene setting, they will be pretty short, but I promise they're going to get longer soon! Hope you enjoy! Warning: abuse - read at your own risk (it's not too bad)
"I'm sorry!" he screamed to the rain, steady English script. "I didn't want them to die!" He paused for heaving breaths that didn't match the pace of his heart. "Я бы хотел умереть вместо этого!"
"If you think I'm going to find solace in that, you're sorely mistaken." Draco spat. "I have never been once been hit nor slighted by my father, and the fact you would think so shows your clear lacking as a teacher. I have never wanted in my life, and -" Lupin cut him off, taking both of his hands again, clasping them in between his own. Draco panted slightly, chest heaving and still glaring at Lupin who looked at him meaningfully.
The only personal touches that he did in fact leave behind were the pictures of him and Draco, even the ones he treasured. The glass holding one of the picture in felt cool beneath his fingers, a familiar sensation. It was a relatively new one, a picture of the pair of them at Christmas taken by Remus. Harry was laughing and fiddling with the strap of a bracelet he had gotten for Draco, who was looking at Harry in the photo like he was his world. A couple stray tears escaped and ran wetly down his cheeks which he hastened to wipe away.
"I love you, mother." He said. But you did not have to like someone to love them. Her frown deepened, and she looked maddeningly close to tears. "I like you, as well, of course. I just- I'm tired." She gazed at him sorrowfully. "I'm tired of the pain, mother. I'm tired of acting like the perfect fucking child all the time, because that's what father wants, I'm tired of being hit, of being tortured, of being told that the only reason I'll ever amount to something is because I'm being trained to be a fucking Malfoy, I'm tired of trying to fucking kill myself in the hopes that maybe,
His heart had almost stopped at how gorgeous the man was, and then, with a rather quick realisation, saw that it was a man who appeared very close in age to Harry himself. He was wearing a white shirt with the first few buttons undone, showing the edges of his pale shoulder blades, and revealing a rather large 'v' of his chest. He looked oblivious to Harry's staring, gently fussing Padfoot and occasionally sweeping back his silky blond hair that fell around his face. Harry decided that something must be done about this, and so, he broke the silence.
They walked in vague silence through the high bushes that lined the path to the front door, through the big wooden doors that led to the entrance hall. Draco had to supress the repulsion in his chest and another panic. Weakness, his father had said, should be shown to no-one, they will use it against you. He led Grey up the grand staircase. He remembered running up and down them as a child whilst his mother still clung to her own chambers, when Lucius still seemed to be the father who loved him unconditionally. Once, he thought, he had tripped and fell down the entirety of the stairs and broken a rib and one of his legs. Lucius had ran out of his study to find him, and Draco was sure that was the last time he had seen pure affection on his face, as Draco tried to stand on a broken leg with no complaint and no tears.
"Open the lock for me, then." Sam watched him with guarded eyes and reached slowly to the lock with his wand, a small 'click' resounding in the small lock. The door swung open just a fraction, enough for Grey to push his way through. Draco knew that more than one pair of auror eyes were on him, a fact he was very conscious of.
"I'd rather have you guide the way, or else, who knows what I could get up to." Lupin raised an eyebrow in what could have been a smirk, had he not been so surprised.
"Why not?" It was the first time Grey had sounded careful and precise, the way Draco enunciated things when he wanted it to be known that there were consequences for not getting his way. Draco, however, really did not have a good answer to that question, so he stood and turned sharply.
"Well then I'll tell you now, I'm a lot better at cooking than you would imagine. I'll have you know I've been praised for my many abilities." He smirked, gesturing vaguely his fork. Pansy laughed and Blaise snorted, rolling his eyes an going back to his food that was apparently more important than Draco, an absolute lie.
"Yes that would be fine, thank you." Sam nodded, and with a crack, he disapperated. Draco let out a large sigh and rubbed his face with a hand wearily. He wanted to take a long bath and sleep in his own bed for twenty hours. Grey kindly reminded him that, no, that was not going to happen.
"Hold on, hold on." He drawled. "Are we going to skip past the me being gay thing? Is that not a big deal?" Narcissa looked whimsically disturbed, if it were at all possible. Draco laughed again. "What, did you think we were just sharing a flat as pals?"
He then sent it off attached to the old family owl that had always stayed native to the Malfoy grounds; a great big European eagle owl that had once been named Perseus, after the constellation. He realised that the family did seem to have a lack of originality, but he liked the names, the same as he liked his. He had somewhat fond memories of watching the stars on summer nights with Narcissa, who had taught him to value the sky, and to know it like the back of his hand.
Did I have to change the chapter notes because this was supposed to be out a lot earlier? Yes. Did I procrastinate writing this by taking my brother into town to piss him off? Also yes. I have such poor time management skills that I'm actually famous for my many excuses.
Credits to my brother who is my inspiration for this scene with Lupin lmao, he just fit so well that I couldn't help writing Draco after him
Draco had been many things for many people, too many things to list. But now, now as his world shattered around him, he was allowed to be selfish. He took a single glass out of the top cupboard an hurled it with all his might at the wall, screaming. He then felt his knees buckle, and he screamed and cried into his hoodie to the sound of raining glass.
"What about Pansy?" He asked, not letting his hands drop. Lupin looked a little confused before it clicked.
"There. Not a half bad job. I'm used to it- I used to ride, did you know that?" He found himself saying, gushing rather quickly despite the fact that this was a kelpie, and he was a perfectly sane human being. Well, perhaps not human. Not entirely. Draco glanced around, trying not to catch the eye of any auror who was currently leaving him alone. "Well, that's us. If you run off, we're both dead." Again, both of them understood that that was true. They did not acknowledge the fact. He grabbed the lock on the door, but it was a lot stronger than the one that had been on the boy's cage. Draco cursed and rubbed his hand. It smelt like metal.
"Good to see your sense of humour hasn't changed at all." She said, almost whimsically, as if she thought it might've. Draco wasn't surprised. They likely had expected him to be acting a lot differently after a stay in Azkaban, and to be honest, he couldn't blame them at all. It was all his best acting to make the talk look effortless, but he really did feel drained. As if he would never be happy again, some voice told him in the back of his mind ironically, except it wasn't the immediate reaction to the dementors, it was just a reaction really to everyday life.
"Yes, yes, fine there shouldn't be anyone else here." He didn't turn back, but he could hear two feet now following him instead of four.
"They said they were looking for someone by the name of Draco Malfoy, and they had a photo of you." He was glaring menacingly at Aidan now, in the feeble hopes that that would make him face Harry.
It wasn't deep near the banks and bore only gentle ripples when the wind died down, only came up to his knees when he was upstanding, and as he lay backwards on his elbows, the water barely reached high enough on his chest to be a worry. Narcissa ran over, almost refusing to run in after him, but gathered up the long skirt of her dress and ran in. She needn't have tried, because the cold water and the shock somehow seemed to align his mind and body. He could breath again.
"Hardly. I've been waiting for fifteen minutes for these two." She said, and stalked out, Blaise and Draco following closely behind. Draco turned to look at what Granger was doing, but instead met her eyes. They looked at each other for a few seconds before Draco turned and continued walking.
He turned around a few times to scan the market. There were a lot of eyes on him, and half were fearful. The cages were, unhelpfully, not labelled, and so he tried to make an educated guess as to who was what. He gave up eventually and just headed to end of the row. There was an assembled apparition point for the aurors to take the 'merchandise' starting already, the boy from before leaving Draco's side and running to the first auror waiting. They disappeared within seconds.
Lucius, using a translation charm, had described in detail of the wonder of what he would give Nikolai back in England, the wonder of the manor and his riches. Nikolai had listened, shiny eyed and quiet, because he had been taught that it was wrong to speak over men, and that it was even worse to speak over rich ones. He listened to the description of his room, large and so far unadorned, lying in wait for him. Nikolai marvelled all of it, the riches that he could have possession of. They didn't even need to do a test between them, because it was so painstakingly obvious that Lucius was his father in all of his features.
"Fine then, I'll bite. Yes, he's hit me." He was amazed, honestly, at how quickly he could flip the switch. Bi polar, Pansy had called it after a particularly vicious fight they had had. Lupin seemed amazed too, though he didn't dare voice his opinion to Draco in fear of angering him again, just nodded in an understanding manner, clearly upset.
Draco used more potions to get the grime out of the long knotted hair, often alternating between an ivory comb and French products. By the end, his hair was clean and no longer matted, but his body (the parts that weren't submerged, at least) was still a filthy mess. Draco sighed and glanced at his soaking fore arms and the many products he was using and decided he really did not have the patience to wash the rest of Grey's body.
"Those people beg to fucking differ!" He screamed, and now he didn't even care if others could hear them.
"The portkey isn't far from here." Lupin said, as though reading his thoughts, not turning to Draco nor slowing his gait down. Draco narrowed his eyes and walked on, through the hazy trees and damp green. Something hissed, and Lupin stopped. Grey had pressed himself against Draco's legs and was hissing at something unseen between the trees. Draco took a hard look at the trees, using his veela eyes to reveal the secrets of the dark beyond. A hulking figure. He instinctively pressed himself closer to the floor, grabbing his wand and pointing it at the figure. "Draco?" Lupin asked, also drawing his wand. "What is it?"
"My other wand?" He asked expectantly. Sam just stared at him. "Oh for fucks- If I were allowed a wand, would you give it to me?" Sam nodded dubiously. "Perfect." Draco seethed. "Now, I don't particularly want to spend another second here, so if you would be so kind as to let me home, I'm sure that I would be positively amicable." Grey also seemed rather unhappy at the prospect of being called a pet, but kept his anger in check. Draco felt very fortunate, or rather, lucky that his own stupidity was not leading to drastic consequences. He also feared that it would soon let up.

Thanks again for reading! Again please do leave a comment, they mean a lot to me! (my friend's support only gets me so far, lmao)
"Yes, I thought so too." She said, running her hands along the rough stone of the bannister. "Quite unnecessary how they have to mix the rooms like this, though. I'd much rather be stuck in a room with both of you." They had never really shared a room properly, only the room of requirements, but Draco could imagine just how it would go. It would be great, he thought, to share a room that smelt like cinnamon, French perfume and expensive alcohol.
"Well, I know that he's in Slytherin." She said, a knowing smile on the reaction that this would provoke. Blaise looked even more intrigued and ruffled her hair.
'To stubborn to worm it out': a tight lipped head shake. 'what do we do?': hands raised and then dropped, and a cocked head.
It looked like the kind of cold that seeped into your bones, coiled around you core. It felt like dying in the calm of the undisturbed.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment about what you liked/disliked or what you want to see more of in this fic, and I'll do my best to include it!
Draco Malfoy was special. He was special in his blood, his lineage, his wealth and even his looks. He was someone no-one seemed to forget, no matter how hard they tried to. He was not someone Harry Potter could forget.
Desperate, he tried to recall the foggy memories of what had happened, and suddenly he was kissing Draco, because he was sure that's what they had done. He placed his hands on Draco's chest, feeling the hard jut of bone beneath them. He pushed down, pulled back. He did it gain.
"Listen, I don't care who we're sharing with, but could you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep, it's Saturday." He muttered, glaring with sleepy eyes and hair that ought to be illegal. Draco just rolled his eyes and slipped out of bed, keeping at least one eye on Weasley in case of any incidents. Weasley stared back with similar intent.
"I wish you were my mother." He said it with full conviction, and couldn't even bring himself to tell himself that it wasn't true. He really wished that she were.
"Blaise, are you around?" It was a stupid question, because he had heard Blaise laugh earlier, but politeness was a valued trait. The curtain drew back to reveal a yawning Blaise, rubbing his eye with his free hand.
Then it was so much warmer, but it couldn't have been too much warmer because he was sure he was still in a lake. It wasn't a fact he was keenly aware of. There wasn't much anything he was keenly aware of. But he felt like he was on fire, and his chest hurt because there was weight on it, but it was gentle weight, like someone caressing his scars. Harry, he thought, loved to caress his scars. He never let him do it, not much.
"I don't like it here." He said, very simply. Narcissa refused to sit down. "This place, I don't like it."
Harry now found himself profusely wishing that Sirius had won and decided to own some breed of terrifying dog.
'No.' When he had asked his mother to run away with him, tears streaming. She had sat perfectly still and unmoving on the bed, completely ignoring him. It was the only time she had ever ignored him, and in his sour bitterness, he ran away alone. Didn't get far.
I'm so sorry for disappearing!!! I really didn't mean for this chapter to take this long to come out, I've just had a lot going on in my life at the moment. I hope to put out more consistent updates and will try my best too, but it's hard to work writing this around my school schedule (it's slowly killing me.)
Draco wasn't quite sure how long they stayed there in those positions; Grey kneeling on the floor beside the bath with a supportive arm around himself, keeping him upright in the bath. He didn't even know why they were doing it, but the more he became aware, the more he realised how fucking cold he was. It was his serenity cold, the kind that seeped into your bones and left frost across stiff joints.
They did, of course win after about a fifteen minute chase. They were aurors, after all, and these people were only smugglers and vendors. Not skilled, not against them. They were all arrested, tied and bound with magic cords that held them in place.
"Kelpie." He said, gruffly. It wasn't the same discontent that the others seemed to have, but it was in no way as kind as Sam's. "Leave it in there. We'll have to come back and dispose of it later." The kelpie was, of course, watching with intelligence. They were beings, after all.
Draco gasped through the noise, and his back was against the cold wooden doors, and they were being wrenched open because his hands were on the handles. He let out a strangled scream as he did so, blood continuing to pour don. He wanted to feel light headed, to pass out, but the pain weighed him down, tethered him to consciousness.
"And the-the veela thing? How long have you been dealing with that?" He asked. Best not to push too many boundaries, but to see where the lines lay, or lack thereof. Draco cocked his head, raised an eyebrow.
"Listen, we can forget this ever happened, and I'll never bother you again." And this he said with the air of finality he was grasping for. Weasley gaped, Harry stuttered, and he had no clue what Blasie was doing (he hoped it was getting whiskey, but alas, things never really do pan out the way you hope for them to do, you know?)
"I can assure you professor that I'm not going to manipulate other students." He said, smiling tightly. Lupin smiled back, less tight lipped, more pitying and soft. Draco hated that look. He turned away.
The thing was, Draco used glamour to hide a multitude of sins, all blanketed under the one relevant use of 'veela disguise'. He couldn't just drop one glamour because they were all the same one, interlinked and usable, he just added things, scars, bruises, to the glamour, but in the end, it was the same.
"Draco." He said, for, what else was there to say? It would be demeaning for him to ask of Draco's wellbeing, he was  sure, and he couldn't say nothing and watch him choke. Draco swallowed, but it didn't seem to do much good as his lips pulled back in a grimace.
"Right, I'll let you get on with the rest then." He shook out his arms over the bath, though a lot of the droplets flicked randomly around the room. Grey turned around to look at him with round eyes.
There was a small curse from behind the bathroom door, and when it opened, Grey emerged looking sincerely annoyed and with dripping wet hair.
"Yes, well, I thought you'd like them. I hope Blaise made the bed for you properly as well, that was supposed to be an extension on it." She said, examining her nails whilst she all but clung to him in a random show of affection the three of them had seemed to have adopted.
"Ready when you are." Sam said from behind Draco. It appeared to him that Sam might be quite important. Good. All the aurors turned to look at Draco who glanced back at them all with an even gaze. A quick turnaround. 'Presentation is the key to success.' His father had once said, slapping Draco after he had fallen to the floor in pain. He bit through the pain now.
"Well, also, thank you darling." She stroked his hair as tough it were the most interesting thing in the world, as if it could save her from the aurors behind her.
The traders did not even come close to Draco, they just paced and threw spells which he dodged with varying success. The aurors, after a few seconds of this, charged through and hurled their own back, but not without a few 'accidental' missteps and shoves to his body. Sam helped him to the side.
He hummed gently a sort of sound that could have been many things, indifference, acceptance, annoyance, but Narcissa seemed to take it as intended. As a child, he often made sort of hums and small noises of undisclosed pain, and Narcissa had always seemed to interpret them correctly.
On the other hand, I have worked out exactly where I want this story to go, so it will have a more concrete plot now.
which means both of you are automatically eliminated." She flicked her hair bitchily and strode onwards, towards the common room. Draco removed his hand from Blaise's shirt which came with protest from him.
Once he was fully packed in the room, there were only six steps he had to take to leave. One: open the safe, take the bank details. Two: open the bedroom door. Three: take whatever was needed from the rest of the flat. Four: leave his ring and a note. Five: open the front door. Six: shut the front door.
"Why don't you open it for us?" It was a predatory smile. It was the same one Lucius used to have. Draco scowled at him, but made no further comment as he tapped the tree in the right places. There was an awful creaking noise as the bark pulled away to reveal the one way opening that led to the market, noises of shouting and the hope of illegal salesmen drifting unsatisfactorily from it. Draco went to turn around, to say 'There, you see?', but all he saw were hands shoving him roughly back. His reflexes were good, but not good enough, so all he was able to before hitting the floor was twist himself around so that he might land on his hands rather than his spine. He tried to push himself up, but once his eyes met the crowd who had heard the 'thunk' of his body, he froze. Someone somewhere shouted to catch him, and a few eyes definitely recognised him from a previous incident, grins widening like a cats. He only managed to push himself up and reach a fighting stance as they struck.
After a while, Draco kicked himself up with the second bottle and ran into the small tide of the lake that lapped at his ankles, trousers rolled up and coat forgotten, laughing to the black of the water. Blaise joined him, wrestled him into the water for the whiskey and let laughter be their words of choice. Then Pansy joined it, giggling and stumbling kicking water up at them till they were all soaked and freezing, sitting in the shallow waters with only the burn of alcohol to keep them warm against the October weather and the harrowing thoughts. And then, into the wind and cold they all whispered the same three words through their giggles and drunken thoughts.
"Sirius!" Lily scolded, seeing Harry's distress. "Watch your mouth. Oh come in, love, I'll make you hot chocolate."
"Well go on." Draco prompted, pointing at the bath. Grey muttered something under his breath that might have been 'twat', but got in anyhow. Draco moved to perch on the tiles at the side of bath. The green window let through dim September sunlight that dappled both of their features in a pretty way, the kind that people took photos of. Grey sat obediently in the water, straight backed an still, hands waving through the green and bubbles, flicking up droplets of warmth.
"What harm can a kelpie really do when under supervision? Wizards aren't at a risk from being killed by them, and I doubt there are any muggles on the property of Malfoy manor in the middle of no-where in Wiltshire." Draco made a noncommittal half laugh that did not reach beyond Grey who watched him sceptically. He really was rather fucking tall, Draco thought, stroking his neck and wondering how on earth one would mount a horse this large. He zoned out of the rest of the argument, though it couldn't have lasted very long because his fingers weren't as filthy as they should have been if they had left it for a while. Draco hoped Grey didn't mind water magic, because he was definitely going to need pressure washing.
Thanks for reading, hope that if you're going back to school or are already back it's not going too bad! I start on Friday and I've already recieved assignments, dear God.
Draco Malfoy was special because he was the man that the saviour of the wizarding world was so helplessly in love with. He was special because he knew Harry loved him and had the fucking audacity to be annoyed and even inconvenienced by the fact, as if it were something that would not go away, despite Draco’s best intentions.
"Sir, the press." One of the men said, walking into the flat. Draco wanted to slap both of them hard for ruining his fucking life. Lucius glared at him, and then at Draco.
"My name is going to be Draco?" He asked. He'd liked the name from the moment he had heard it, the grace and power it possessed. Though, he supposed, it had probably back then just sounded cool to a six year old.
Draco had only seen chaos like this in the war. He found it hard to breathe. Its just, there were so many people, they were all fighting, there were people screaming, and there were children here, because how were they supposed to know any better?
"I- yes I suppose." The words seemed to shock Lupin into working, but not very well. "Have you, uh, been told who you're sharing with?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Aidan." It was almost spat out. He flinched. Harry felt the sick feeling grow. Aidan was never submissive in fights, in any altercations. He had never flinched, not as if Harry had just slapped him. "Who were those men?" It was a dangerous tone, now that the shock was fading, he could get a tighter grip on his anger.
He was surprised at how pliable Grey was beneath his hands, how his head would turn this way and that as he tried to do up the bridle. He supposed that Grey was just doing it so that it could escape. Draco supposed he would have done the same. It was awfully fiddley through the bars of the cage, and he couldn't quite move as he wished, but wishing was for those with the luxury of a backdrop to see to. If he went away wishing, he supposed he'd be looking very kindly upon the roof of the manor. He pushed away the thought.
"How far now?" He asked as Draco sidestepped a holly bush. Draco nodded at a tree in front of them, forcing Sam's eyes to flicker away.
He strode up to the door and pushed them open with the force neccessary, great hulking, creaking things that whined as they did exactly what they were purposed to do. It was flat and heavy beneath his hands. The chatter ceased. Eyes found his body, murmered gasps and exclamations. He smirked even wider at the mass of people staring at him.
Oh god, I'm so sorry this is so late! School's been so busy, dear God, so I've been writing this in most of my boring lectures, which may have taken an impact on the um, end. All I'm saying is that I have some very strong feelings about ancient history, lol.
"Mr. Williams, are you proposing that we allow him to keep the creature?" It was the surly man who had been leading the group. Draco took his hands away from Grey's muzzle and moved them down to his neck, patting it gently. Mud caked off.
He would wake up and shower, get dressed and read for a while in his parlour before greeting his mother downstairs for a nine thirty breakfast. He would then get changed again and go out riding on Grey until lunch which would be then spent in the kitchen in the domestic style of lunch and cooking. The time between lunch and dinner would then also be spent with Grey whilst he read, studied and wrote off to his friends, after which time he would retire to his mother's parlour for a small dinner that mainly consisted of sandwiches.
"Well, what do you want me to say?" Draco snapped, glaring menacingly at Lupin. "What, that I murdered people because I was too scared of what my daddy would do to me? That I cried in my room everyday? Something like that? I can tell you that, if you want, but it won't be true." He spat, aggressively posh and offensive. Attack, Lucius had told him, is the best form of defence. Lupin just looked sad, melancholy.
He strode on through St. James' Park becuase, well, he'd asked to be taken in. Taken an offer, really, but he didn't bother differentiate. The February sun did nothing to warm either his soul or his face, dappling light that only seemed as effective as he could let himself venture. He leant on the fence between the path and the lake and stared gloomily at a black swan who seemed to be doing better in the available light.
"Messy as well." Pansy quipped, releasing Draco in favour of playing with her hair. "I don't know. Do you think I should change the colour?" She asked, preening ever so slightly as she messed around with it. She needn't have bothered, it looked perfect anyway.
"Come on, you know Pans wants a proper answer and a detailed manuscript of use for each and every gift." Blaise said, leaning to place his chin on the back of his hand which was still holding a fork.
"See Draco, I think you were abused, by your father I expect. I think he did something to you." Lupin's voice sounded almost like honey, and if he lingered to long he'd get stuck. That certainly wasn't the question he had anticipated, and the shock left no room in him for a crude response. He just sat there eying Lupin who looked almost sad. Draco didn't deny, no matter how much he wanted too. His breathing pace quickened and then slowed, and he glared helplessly at his shoes. Lupin didn't say anything; Draco couldn't even hear him move, but when he looked up again, Lupin was seated in the chair next to Draco, on the wrong side of the desk.
He didn't go far, for much, per se. He just slipped back into old habits, accidently. He knew, incidentally, where to go, what to buy, and had the money. He clutched his pocket. Heroine. He'd taken it before, on numerous occasions. Never with Harry, though.
"He's breathing." Another said. "What the fuck happened?" This voice was nice and homely, and Draco was sure it loved him to. How did people love him? He wasn't sure.
"Yes?" He responded. Answers often needed to be coaxed out. It was either something vulnerable, or something that he didn't want to hear. He guessed that it was the latter.
"The tower above the Gryffindor common room. Can you find it ok?" He asked, hastening to walk around the desk to stand next to Draco who was picking up his bags from the floor. Grey looked more than a little annoyed at being left out, but Draco did not bother to consider it.
"Lucius," She had said. Draco had thought she had a wonderful voice. "There appears to be a child with you." It was perfectly even speech, only understandable due to wandless translation spell, and you would not have been able to take any tone from it. Draco at that age himself was unable to decipher the tone. Only Lucius, he suspected, would have been able to gauge how distressed she was by the pre-notion of a child that looked in his young age, exceedingly like him. He didn't need to see Lucius' to know it was smiling.
"Don't." Draco said. "Sit there." Grey obeyed. He summoned a towel and sat in the chair behind where Grey was seated on the foot rest and got to work, alternating again between the towel and the comb until the hair was satisfactorily dry. (he had done this a lot for Pansy in school, so he was used to it, though Pansy didn't have nearly as much hair as Grey did.)
"Think you already have." Pansy quipped from Draco's left, sounding both disgusted and completely used to it.
Which was how Harry found himself sitting on his parents old sofa at four am whilst his Godfathers argued over his ex fiancé's git levels. Lily told them that it was all quite unnecessary, but only Remus tried to stop talking about it. Sirius kept on rambling about how much of a dick Lucius Malfoy was, not really caring (or just really oblivious) to Harry's growing upset.
Ok, I admit it, this is basically just fluff. There will be more moving on action and such starting next chapter though, so please do read on!
"I'm sorry, you just... Showed up?" Lupin asked, perplexed. "I don't quite understand." Draco grinned, shark-like and predatory, and lent forward, confident Lupin wouldn't tell anyone.
A slam echoed in the next cell along. Draco bolted up, on his feet before his mind could even react to the sudden change in atmosphere. He could feel the dementors outside, feel their draining black holes of depression. Then someone was screaming. He blinked. Ran to the cell door where he had a gap marred by bars. His hands grasped the steel as he pressed his head as close as he dared to the openings.
"Love-" He said. Draco snapped his head to the side in a hard, angular movement, seething with unseelie rage, though it wasn't even aimed at Blaise, just at anything. You never let them see you upset, he thought to himself, so turn your sadness into anger and become an unstoppable foe. His body ached and his bones cracked as the resentment swarmed inside him in the shape of ugly vines, latching onto everything they could. His ribs broke and crumbled, his lungs constricted by a force that wasn't even there, rooting itself in the crevasse of his heart, though it had always been in there and he knew it, only now it hurt, it hurt like someone gripping him so tightly with a binding love that wasn't really love anymore, just suffocating agony that curled and creaked in his joints, whispering poison nothings into the blood that wasn't his blood, like hands on his neck, lips on his ear telling him he would fix everything, just not telling him how and dragging him down to the lake that was so familiar, like it was cold and calm, but it wasn't because the current tore him apart and leeched into him like fire, and it was so far away from his serenity that he didn't know which way was out, like he was drowning, but would be drowning forever without ever seeing the light at the top of the lake. Like he'd never see the moonlight again, never tilt his head back into the silence of the night and drink the sky, see his name etched in the stars. It was so dark now, and it felt crushing in the midst of the current, and he was willing for it to feel like the lake again, but it was hard when it felt like you were dying but would never cease to live. It wasn't as fast anymore, not now when the anger was fading, he'd already gotten here, but it still felt crushing and breathless, and the hands felt red hot on his skin. It was just stifling and empty. He floated.
"Miss me, then?" He asked, raising an eyebrow before Pansy side-tackled him as gracefully as she could into a hug. He wound a long arm around her, kissing the top of her head as she gripped his long coat with near trembling fingers. Once she withdrew herself, she feigned ignorance and pretended nothing had happened. Draco and Blaise did the same, because that was the nature of their friendship.
"What's your problem Malfoy? Was a month in Azkaban not enough? Want to go back?" He shouted at the Slytherins. Many of Draco's not quite supporters but sympathisers in Slytherin began an almost verbal assault with hushed shouting back at the Weasel which sounded more like a sea of insults to Draco's pleased ears. The entire room had gone silent again, and the teachers were poised and ready to launch themselves in should the teenagers get too carried away.
"If I were still allowed to be the high witch, they'd have a lot more to talk about." She professed to them, looking at the books as though she was trying to discern which ones would be actually interesting. Blaise and Draco exchanged a smirking look, Blaise's hand knocking gently against the side of her head as she gazed half heartedly at the books, causing her to look up at the pair of them, an 'I-know-something' cat look on her face.
It was a lot nicer and safer inside of the room, and it was good to lie beguilingly on the silk sheets of the bed reading a book in the quiet candle light. Blaise had neglected his homework, forgoing it for getting drunk with Pansy and Draco, but as he sobered up, his growing urgency for completing it steadily took over, and so Draco read to the turning of parchment and the scratching of a quill, gentle questions asked to the air, sometimes to Draco, with a small murmur of conciousness accompanying it all.
Draco Malfoy had not always been Draco Malfoy. He had once been someone very different. He had once been a boy named Nikolai Lebedev, son to a Russian whore and raised in a brothel. Some may argue that it would not have been the proper way to bring up a child, but Draco would argue that they were the happiest years of his life.
"I'm quite alright, thank you." Grey looked expectantly up at him. Draco sneered back. "It's chocolate, you wouldn't like it." He did his best to roll his eyes in the body of a cat. Lupin snorted and Draco pretended not to have heard it for the sake of Lupin's life.
"Oh yes I'm quite sure you have Draco. Anyway, the gifts?" Pansy sniped, pouting at the end as if he hadn't already answered the question.
"Do you recon," Draco asked thoughtfully, most of his focus still retained by Pansy's hair "That we should move? I can hear them talking shit through the shelves." Blaise let his head com forward to rest on Draco's shoulder, lolling to the side slightly to lazily poke his nose at Draco's neck.
I know this was also meant to be out yesterday and there was supposed to be a longer chapter today, but my brother had an episode, so I wasn't able to get much writing done, and so this chapter is criminally short as well, I do apologise, but there will be longer ones soon! The end also may be a little rushed because I really needed to get this out, sorry
When Draco awoke the next morning, he was cold and everything hurt. He made a small moaning noise of discomfort and endeavoured to sit up and open his eyes. In doing so, it revealed that he had somehow slept in his bath despite the shallow puddles of water that covered the marble base. That explained the stiff feel of his limbs, but not the sharp pain in his left. In fairness, since living in Azkaban, it had always hurt.
"I would hope you've been briefed on that already, but no. Right now, I'd like to talk about you." Draco felt the cage around him: the worst possible outcome. He groaned internally.
"If we had to re-locate every time this happened, I'm sure we'd be forever on the run." He muttered into the soft skin, and Pansy made a non-committal sound of agreement.
He was, of course, welcomed gracefully, because he was not loud or drunk, nor was he far to old, and, in fact, many of the girls there didn't mind fancying him. The large sums of money also helped him get through, letting his name only be muttered in the quieter corners of the room.
"Mm, you always did know how to send them running." Draco mused, watching the girl hurry away, still stroking Blaise's back delicately. "We're not stopping you from sleeping with us Pans, you just aren't into dick and there's nothing wrong with that." He gave her an almost patronisingly pitying look. Blaise laughed, loud and rich, much like his personality. Pansy glared at Draco and hit him lightly, sticking her nose in the air.
I am aware this is mostly the Slytherin trio again, but I really do love them. We kick off a bit at the end of this chapter (Open the gates fellas! Here comes the Drarry!)
The dementors weren’t anything new; hell knows, he had lived with them for over a year, but the cell was. It was cold, wet, and damp, and he was almost certain it was one of the worst cells that they had. When the waves crashed and broke to harshly, they sounded like the cracking of a whip which was always sure to send a spike of adrenaline through Draco, and because of all the unfortunate acts he had committed, the location of his cell meant he could feel the salty spray of those waves.
"Granger told you? What does she know?" He asked, careful not to sound to forceful or desperate. He sounded even and controlled, a win.
'Freestyle': hands gesturing in a rolling over each other fashion. Draco sighed at him. His first Saturday in the comfortable embrace of safety, and he was going to have to spend it worming secrets out of Pansy and continuously glaring at Blaise whenever he got an almost pitying look. Wonderful.
"I-uh-yeah, I mean I've seen him around St. James' a couple times, but that's it." He lied through his teeth, but the men seemed exceptionally oblivious. They both nodded. The smaller one (though, it really wasn't by much, and both of them were taller than Harry) supplied him with a card bearing a number.
"This isn't my dog, actually. He's my Godfather's dog, Padfoot. I'm looking after him while he's staying with me." He blurted out, flushing when the man turned to look at him. Then he started laughing, his face's sharp angles conforming a more friendly image, and Harry laughed too at the bizarreness of the situations. "I don't want to get caught out when I see you for coffee, and I turn up without a dog." He joked, jovially, with only the hint of hope in his tone. The man smirked at him, standing from his crouched position.
Harry drove to his parent's house, because, well, where else was there to go? He pulled up outside there door, and for a while, he just sat there in his car and cried some more in the vain hope of trying to get himself together. He hugged the steering wheel and sobbed.
He looked back at Draco and screamed for his help. This the dementors did stop at, turning to look at Draco as if they expected a rise, a fight, anything. Draco just watched Greyback with his sullen grey eyes, getting across the single point: I don't care. Greyback howled and Draco turned away from the cell door, hit with anther chilling wave. He steadied his breathing and sank to the floor again, pressing a hand to head where he had hit it. No permanent damage, which was good if he wanted to live. He was a bit indifferent over that now, to be honest.
-"He was cut off because his mother was hugging him. He panted into the frosted air, arms hanging lame by his sides. She was weeping, he realised. His mother never showed off signs of any human emotion. Not usually.
"Aid- Draco?" A voice from behind him asked. It sounded a weird mix of pleasantly surprised, confused and mildly disappointed. Lily. He spun around, clutching at the fence and pressing himself against it. "What are you doing here?" Fight or flight responses normally kicked in around this point, and for Draco it was usually fight. He bit the down the urge to tell her that he was allowed to go wherever he pleased.
"I suppose you aren't dead then." And Grey, Draco thought, was just as perfect as Pansy and Blaise were. He almost backed himself into another corner.
He wandered through the empty field to the outlines of the trees and stepped gracefully into the undergrowth. He heard muttering and slurs being thrown at him from behind, but they weren't meant to be audible and so he let it slide. Sam walked beside him and it occurred to Draco that he might be trying to get along with him.
"I don't know who they were, Harry. I'd tell you if I did, of course I would darling, but as it stands, I really don't know what you want me to do." His pace matched that of a caught rabbit. This was wrong. Aidan never acted like this, he used darling as a word he would roll off the tongue in a charmingly posh drawl, not at all in a rushed panic, as if it were the only thing keeping Harry's pure malice off him. Harry hated it. He started to shout.
"I once met a rare vampire sub-species who were in a cult." As if that were all the explanation needed. Draco didn't even respond; he saw no valid reason or reply.
" And, well, Blaise couldn't do anything but obey with a slightly bemused, concerned expression, hands leaving Draco's arms slowly, as if he were still worried that Draco would fall.
"It's almost like I didn't need that muffliato." Draco snarked. Blaise's foot hit his thigh from beneath the sheets, and the lump that was Blaise turned over. It suddenly hit Draco. "Oh, hangover then?" In fairness, Blaise had drank almost an entire bottle of whiskey last night. "What ever will your homework look like?" Hangover potions were banned in school on the principal that alcohol was also banned. Blaise let out a groan.
"No, that's quite alright, though I would like to go and change, perhaps shower. I'll cook for us, it's been a while since I did."
Ought he just to have said 'No.' himself? He doubted that was even an option, doubted it was contusive for his survival, and really, didn't he have to survive? He didn't really want to survive. Dying seemed to be the much more simple solution. (He had, unfortunately, sworn off dying if he could help it. Goodbye peace, he thought.)
"Now what." Draco near jumped out of his skin at the voice. It was husky and low, but also hesitant. There was no longer a huge horse behind him, rather there was a teenage looking man with knotted grey hair down to his waist. Amber eyes watched him uneasily. He was also only wearing a what appeared to be a woven skirt made from Draco assumed to be seaweed.
It was pretty down here, a serene escape that he had often utilised in times of need and desperate longing to get away from the house, though, he had nothing to shield himself with down here, only the huge expanse of a black lake. The grass kept crunching, getting louder and louder until somewhere in his mind he realised that there was someone walking towards him.
"We have a winner." Blaise called louder than neccessary, the alcohol removing any noise barriers of polite society that he previously had. Draco's right hand roamed up Blaise's back beneath the shirt he was wearing, fingers brushing lightly and pleasingly over soft skin and hard muscles.
He stared in horror at Lupin as he felt the glamour wash off of himself, like water in a shower. Lupin, it was safe to say, had the same look of uninterrupted horror, though Draco suspected this was more aimed at his arm than anything else, which was littered with cuts and scars, some self inflicted, others not.
"Oh, come on Pans. It's Saturday. Are you going to force us out of bed on a Saturday?" Draco said, strolling over to her and slinging an arm across her shoulders. "We're ready now, and that's all that matters, isn't it?" Her glare could have frozen the equator, but she didn't make a move to shove Draco off, just folded her arms and glared at her next target: Hermione Granger who unfortunately happened to be heading out of her room and down to breakfast at the same time. She froze upon seeing them, and then continued on.
"Fine. You'll have to side-along me though, because I don't have a wand." He said it as pointedly as he possibly could manage, and luckily, Sam got the hint.
"Oh fuck-" The second voice said, the one that hated him. Ron Weasley, that's who it was. Draco threw himself up, teetering on the edge of feet for a second before Blaise's hand and -
was, but I don't think it's something you just forget." Weasley didn't sound all that impressed with him, and to be fair, Draco got that. He didn't want to go there again. It was waiting for him.
And the truth was, they had both fallen in love with each other, inexpiably and perilously, without a second thought about it. There had been no need for a second date, a third or even a fourth one, because they were delaying the inevitable; they had both made up their minds. Harry was in an inescapable unlabelled abundance of emotions, emotions that could be called, despite their forms by one word: love. Aidan had fallen deep into a mess that grew deeper with each growing moment they spent together, but for him, it was like heroine. He couldn't bring himself to quit, because it was so happy, so perfect in those moments.
Could it be? But it is! My complete ignorance towards the Slytherins, despite the fact that they're basically Draco's backbone in this fic!
Serenity. It had taken a while for Draco to learn that word, really, because he learnt words when they were tied to certain emotions, events. He had to spend a long time searching for serenity in that way that children wonder and ask questions that they are far too young to fathom. Was he ever that young? He didn't think so.
It occurred to him, somewhere in this swirling tempest, that the hands felt real, because the tighter they became, the easier it was to breath through the drowning. He cast his head around, flailing in his own mind, trying to grab onto whatever would make him feel weightless, whatever would take him back. He knew what back was, that much he was certain, but the roots and vines did not shift their placement as the hands grew tighter, pushing deeper into him, despite the fact it seemed to quell the tides and pull him up, out of the turmoil below. He'd never been here before, never seen these sights, but a unseen vine seemed to reach up and hold onto him, not pulling him down of latching him there, but drifting up with him like a tether that kept him there.
Attached, bizarrely, was a picture of Draco from the prophet. It showed Sam walking Draco out of Azkaban, the single moment of unsheathed emotion, and he had no idea how they had gotten it. It was him looking out across the sea with something that looked like tortured pain in his eyes. It was signed on the back.
"Want me to come?" He asked, setting down his quill and folding his arms, leaning back. Draco smiled as he pulled on his shoes, adjusting his earrings so that they sat right.
He was, eventually, allowed to shower and change into some of his own clothes (thank Merlin) in a ministry shower room, which he did not like. The shower was cleansing and he like the feel of the hot water washing away the blood and filth, but he did not like the fact he only had ten minutes to do so. He made a mental not to languish in a bath for hours as soon as he got back home.
I'm also writing my 36 questions fic, which means that I'm jumping between each fic, (this is actually funny because I have like two chapters that date back to the seventeenth, lmao)
" Harry said, sounding incredulous and also unsure as to what he himself was addressing. Things like this were hard to recover from, perhaps easier if it had just been Blaise, perhaps more so if it were Harry. There were three of them here, though, and he couldn't employ his usual tactics.
"Oh, do keep it the same." Blaise said, overly posh again, hands moving to Draco's waist, pulling him down to sit in his lap.
"Why can't you mind your own fucking buisness?!" Everyone in the room could tell he was loosing control. Wickedly curved horns spiralled out, black at the bases moving towards a deep grey, rearing and sharp. Spare sparks prickled at his finger tips, teeth lengthening and sharpening, coming to sinfully sharp points. Lupin seemed very aware he was loosing control of the situation.
It did take a minute to, well, resolve the matter. After they eventually had finished arguing over the matter of 'No Grey, I am not asking to fuck you', Draco resumed to washing Grey's body, and afterwards, his face.
"Suck a dick!" Sirius shouted, looking at James and Remus. "I always said he looked like that git Lucius. Ah Harry, I'm so sorry mate, all Malfoy's are fucking awful."
He lay his head down on Draco's chest so that his forehead rested atop his ribs, moving his hands to Draco's lovely face. He had never seen anyone he liked die. He had only killed indifferently. He wondered idly if this was what the crying figures on the shore felt when they came to visit the watery graves.
"Where is it?" Grey's speech patterns were a lot blunter than Draco's, but matched the hardness that paired itself with the hidden jovialness of the general words. Where was it? It was a simple question, and yet Draco couldn't think to where it might be. Had he gotten it out last night? He wasn't sure. Grey seemed to sense his unease toward the general idea of the question. "I can track it down."
"Good that you don't need them when you have us." Blaise commented, reaching across the table to pat her head and ruffle he hair which she protested at with a loud swear. The moment was over almost as soon as it started, and Pansy went back to bitchily flicking her hair.
"Of course, then I'm sure we shall see you at a later date." She said evenly, inclining her head slightly out of polite regard. The aurors did the same, and then turned to leave, but of course apparated before going to far. Draco shut the door, pressing it hard with his hand. Narcissa reached out and took it whilst it was still outstretched. "So thin." She murmured quietly, running her thumb over it. Looking at his hands, they were very thin, white skin stretched taut over the bones to give an almost skeletal effect, though he supposed he hadn't really noticed this earlier because his hands were always quite skinny.
Now we get more into the action! We have finally reached present day, and from this point, we'll probably be switching from Draco to Harry's p.o.v. Thank you so much for reading!
"Hm. I don't know. Everything was fine till I was about seven or eight, I think? That was a bit of a tipping point, I suppose. I don't recon it's gotten worse, per se, just... Creative." Lupin hated the word 'creative', which could hide a multitude of sins.
"They're raiding a black market for the illegal sale of magical creatures and beings." Her hand was rubbing his back, now. The auror guarding the door nodded at him.
"How bad has it gotten? Was- was it worse growing up? Has it gotten worse recently? I seem to recall Hermione telling me something about you in sixth year, about the pain you were in." This did shock Draco.
"Yes, I do happen to have one, seeing as one is required for Hogwarts. The auror escorting me said it was allowed, so I took that as allowance." He spoke eloquently, but they both knew what would happen if it did transpire he was lying. Lupin needn't of asked though; Malfoy manor had been heavily warded from the vast exterior after the wall, creating a sort of perimeter that would only allow select members through, and would notify the aurors if any 'illegal' spells were being used. Lupin nodded and began walking to the edges of the outdoor wards. Draco followed suit.
"You alright Draco?" Blaise asked, knocking the back of his hand into Draco's skeletal ones, jolting him slightly form bleak daydreams. "You look tired. We won't blame you or anything if you don't want to talk, little as you think of us."
"I'm here for Calina Lebedev." He had said, smiling at the girl who sat opposite him on a worn sofa. The girls eyes had gone soft.
"I am the only heir to the Malfoy pureblood family and my wealth is so extensive that I could buy ten different kelpies instead of you. What the fuck makes you think I'm going to wash your body?" He asked, glaring at Grey from where he was standing in the middle of the room. Grey seemed to turn red and looked away, long hair hiding his face.
I've decided to continually do facts about random things in this fic, so here's the one for today's chapter: This dynamic was really hard for me to properly show off (I felt Blaise wasn't getting enough lines, so I had to re-write a lot of it), and I basically used the relationship I have with my brother to structure around, which is practically the relationship Pansy and Draco have (this is not exact, as you will see later in the fic), so it was definitely really funny writing these scenes!
"Can you prove that he isn't dangerous?" He asked, and amused expression on his face. Draco stuck his chin out and folded his head to the right.
He spent the next two weeks at their house, with Remus and Sirius staying with them, despite how short a walk it was to their own house. When he had tried to broach the topic he was met with the response that it was simply 'like being back at school'. Hermione and Ron had come to see him, to check up on how he was, same as Ginny and even Luna, who came with a bizarrely shaped basket and Neville. It was, without the depression of betrayal, almost nice, and he found himself relaxing into he slow comfort that was his support circle.
"Crime and punishment." They gazed at each other for a long while, studying the other's face. Harry looked at him with such longing and gentle passion that Draco wanted to run the other way.
Serenity: The goal of meditation, where you reach perfect peace and calmness of the mind. He was eight when he tied this word to something. Serenity looked white to him, fresh fallen snow that glinted in the weak sunlight and blinded him in its purity. The stark contrast between the plumage of a peacock and the deep white. He wanted to sink into it, to let it consume him.
was, and he was far to dignified to be caught like this. His eyes snapped open, though they didn't really because they were always open; open and vacant.
"I thought as a teacher you would know when to leave things alone. Clearly not. Is my poor deranged cousin distorting my features? Do I no longer have blonde hair?" He drawled, a defensive quiver slightly marring the uninterested drawl. He was shaking.
"Pans," Draco said, in an over exaggeration of how touched he felt. "You would let me get fucking plastered with you again? I thought you'd never ask." He then changed his tone to bored and monotone. "Oh, Blaise I suppose you can come too. What are you bringing?" Blaise didn't even hesitate, he knew how the game worked.
"I love you." Draco whispered last, and they watched the sun set against the horizon through a haze of happiness.
"Oh, fuck off Blaise I'm going to have to re-organise myself now." Pansy snapped, pulling herself forward before pushing herself back between Draco's legs so that he might continue with his hair. Draco didn't say anything, didn't laugh, just carried on as normal, because this was his friend group and he was finally comfortable mentally in between the people he loved and who loved him back without front or ulterior motive.
"I'm Harry." He offered, sticking his hand out. "What's your name?" The man took his hand in his own, lovely long, skeletal fingers wrapping around Harry's own. He was wearing rings, he realised. Piercing alluring grey eyes looked into Harry's green ones.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment if there is anything you particularly liked/disliked, or just because, because I absolutely love reading comments and tbh I need a little love right now lmao!
"Do you not like me?" And then he did turn to her, his mother, the one who had kept him alive. She looked so sad, so miserably like Draco had remembered his own reflection looking like at the age of five when his father had first hit him. The bruises ached, and he suddenly thought about whether or not he did like Narcissa.
Aidan woke to the smell of after dawn, the sight of weak January sun streaming through patched curtains. His feet ached as he pressed down on them, but he had wrapped them well enough that none of the blood leaked out. He checked the old clock mounted on the wall. Ten thirty, it read. He padded softly through to the living room, and a manic fear gripped his chest, knocking the wind out of him.
who the velvety voice was, of course it was - caught Draco's arm and steadied him, anchoring him to the floor. It was, truly, exceedingly far below him to act like this. His head swam, but it didn't feel like he was going to drown again.
"Fine, fine. I'm going to my room, have fun scoping out the bathroom, I'm sure the girls have a nicer one than you do." She pushed herself up from the floor gracefully, stretching and bending out the odd kinks in her joints.
"I'm very sorry sir, she is no longer among the living." She had replied through a thick accent. Lucius frowned. Another girl had then come up behind the one that he was talking to and whispered something in her ear, stealing occasional glances at Lucius. Then she had left, and it was just the original girl sitting opposite him again. He smiled in a way that would prompt one to eloquently display what the topic of interest was about, but the girl just sat there, looking occasionally at the door in disbelief.
"You think my voice is sexy. Oh look, you start off alright with the date in somewhat neat cursive, but it goes bit downhill from there." Blaise groaned at him, thumping his leg beneath the covers again. Draco laughed and sighed, leaning forward and kicking his legs back so that he was lying on his stomach, head near Blaise's feet, reading the parchment, chin propped up on his hand. The reading was followed by lazy flicks of the wand to change points, handwriting and language to ensure it was on par with the rest of his work. Blaise reached out through the covers and gently took Draco's ankle, rubbing it softly with his thumb.
"This is the entrance to the common room, and you should be able to find the dorms from here. No-one else should be in there, classes are running." And with that, he turned around and all but fled. Draco almost laughed.
Pansy and Blaise were waiting for him at the end of the Slytherin table opposite each other, a seat waiting and open next to Pansy, inviting him in. He turned and glanced around the room once he reached it, smirk growing slightly wider as he noticed all eyes were still on him, as if people were afraid to take them away. Good. He made a small mock bow to his audience and seated himself gracefully, pouring himself a glass of whatever was in the ornate golden jug (he suspected it was red wine) and took a small sip.
"Only if you don't say something stupid." Draco said, and Harry leaned in putting his rough hands on Draco's sharp jawline, his lips on Draco's lips. It was nice like that, comfortable, familiar for both of them like it were a muscle memory, like riding a bike. They both smiled into the kiss, like friends.
"Oh come on, you didn't get a clue?" Draco asked, straightening himself a little. Pansy looked disappointed in a subtle way that only the three of them could really do. "Of course, you're amazing though Pans. Any idea who the boy toy is?" She perked up again at the mention of gossip.
Also - Thank you all so much for 480 hits! WOW! I just wrote this because the au was in my head for far to long and my brother told me to just 'quit being a pussy and post it' so thank you all so much for the support! This is my favourite drarry au, and will probably be the longest, but I will be posting other drarry stories when I can, because I have a few in the works. There will also, at some point, be a marauders era wolfstar fic, because it's a commission for my wonderful friend! Again, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
"It's civil." Pansy sneered, half turned so that she could continue to glare at Draco. "Is it more than you get out of
"Don't be so dramatic," Blaise snarked whilst watching a small trickle of people leaving the halls, mainly just the second and third years. "Right then, are we leaving and getting our shit together?" Of course, Draco had barely eaten, but he made sure that it was known he was finished. Pansy and Blaise were nearly done once he had arrived so fashionably late, so it worked.
Lost in thought, he had barely heard someone distant sounding asking to pet his dog. He of course said yes, because, well, what else did you say when someone asked that? He had then decided it would probably be rude if he carried on ignoring whoever this stranger was, and so chanced a glance down at the man who had spoken.
"Well you know how Potter and girl Weasley never got back together after the war?" She said. Blaise and Draco gave her a look to show that they were hanging on her every word, the look that she absolutely loved. She smiled widely and Draco regretted the turn that this conversation was taking. "Heard he has a boy toy. Did some investigating," Which was Pansy code for stalking, but neither Draco nor Blaise pointed it out. "Turns out he's gay. Overheard him and girl Weasley fighting and he told her, made her promise not to say anything."
"Mm, have you seen the bathroom we have?" Blasie asked, clearly wanting to move on. Pansy flipped herself round again at the mention of it, grinning.
"I'm Aidan, darling! I'm-I'm you fiancé! Who else would I be?" The ghost of a faked smile kept flitting across his face, but he couldn't seem to kept it there, it kept falling off as though it were the wrong size, on the wrong person. Harry saw red. Aidan tried to walked toward him, but Harry back-peddled, which only seemed to upset him more, his breath coming out in heaving pants, the same one would do on the verge of tears. Something crunched.
Someone was saying his name, but it sounded far away, distant. Was that even his name? It must have been. Then he was choking again and his lungs couldn't work, but he wasn't panicking now because it was far too cold, so what was blocking them?
"I'm not having sex with you whilst my mother is in the same house." Despite being genuinely confused at this answer (kelpies, of course, are mostly solitary creatures. Grey didn't know either of his parents further than vague recollections), he let the matter drop, and so it was settled, though most of the settling of their more zoomed out picture of living had already been taken care of. Grey was simply to be an animal that Draco had picked up, a horse to replace the one he had lost many years ago.
Malfoy manor looked as imposing and eerily beautiful as it had the first time he had seen it when Sam apparated them back. Grey stood perfectly still, but he was trembling, and it was not, as far as Draco could tell, from fear.
"Everything you say in here is confidential, Draco, I'm not going to tell anyone. All I need is for you to tell me what happened, and that's it. No one will know, but it'll make you feel better, I promise." His words were soothing, and Draco took his eyes off him for a moment, before realising that his actions were not. Lupin pushed up the right sleeve of his shirt, exposing a pale expanse of skin, unmarked and beautiful. He dared not yank his arm away, but his resolve quickly fell when Lupin reached for his wand. Draco's eyes went wide, and he scrambled to try and put as much distance between the pair of them, but Lupin's grip held tight. Perks of being a werewolf, he supposed. He heard Lupin mutter a glamour dropping spell under his breath.
"Yes, I'm sure anything is better than what you could cook. God forbid I have to visit without the graced presence of house elves." Blaise snarked, posh and clipped with an amused tone.
Grey, he discovered, was also in the bathroom with him. He, however, was draped somewhat across the edge of the bath, having most of his body situated outside of it and on the tiled floor instead of inside with Draco.
"It's Narcissa." The voice called. Draco let his eyes close again. At least he was lying the right way on the bed this time.
"No no no no no no no," Aidan rushed, bringing his hands up. "They were wrong! It's not me they're after!" It was a blatant lie, and both of them knew it.
Suddenly it was a week earlier and he was holding himself steady in the shards of glass. His feet hurt. He moaned and wept, but no one heard him. He fancied no one ever properly would.
"The ministry requires your services for a raid." Draco stilled, inhumanly stiff. He wanted to be released. Narcissa must have sensed this because her grip on his back grew stronger.
"Granger." Pansy responded, high (and mighty), but doing her best to dull down her glare. Granger sat down rather awkwardly in one of the armchairs, indicating that it was time for them to leave. Draco unwound himself from Pansy's shoulders and walked over to Blaise. "Well, good luck, then. Merlin knows boys can't be on time for anything. See you." Granger seemed to smile at that, giving a small wave.
"Mm, very nice. I loved the ring, and I'm sure we'll all have a good time getting wasted by the lake." He said. "Oh, this is nice. I have to tell you, this is much better than the food at home."
He wrestled his way out of Narcissa's arms, despite her noises of shock and disapproving melancholy. He stumbled to his feet, one arm wrapped around his middle and the other clutching at his collarbone and the base of his neck. He gasped and choked, but then he missed his footing and stumbled back so far that he slipped and fell backwards into the lake.
"I don't know darling, you were the one talking to them." His speech was even more rushed now, and it was clear he was panicked. He appeared to be desperately trying to clean up the champagne, averting any eyes away from his face so that they might watch his hands instead. Harry was fuming.
Once he had finished, he put it up into a ponytail (yes, he was aware of the irony) and bound it with a long Malfoy pin which his father had given him, to match the one he had. At the top, it had the Malfoy crest and a snake winding down the long pin to the  sharp point, adorned with emeralds and made, Draco was sure, from obsidian. It looked nice against the grey backdrop, nicer than it had against Draco's more golden hair. (Pansy loved to tell him that it really looked more white than gold, but he was still hanging onto the fragile hope it was blond.)
"Draco?" He asked the form. Grey was sitting on the surface of the water; he had travelled up at the quiet thrashing, the gentle violence that assaulted the shores. He had come up to the rain which beat down on his face. Grey smiled somewhat into the rain, a somewhat melancholic smile. He blinked aimlessly. He was sure that the form was Draco, for, who else would it be?
"Draco Lucius Malfoy." His father said. Draco blinked. It was the dangerous tone, the tone before bad things happened. "You took some finding, my loyal son." It was spat, and he was sure that his father was the only man in the world who could make the word 'son' sound like 'you fucking disappointment. I wish I could hit you.' Draco served no God, but a merciful one had surely been looking down on him.
"Nikolai," Lucius had said on the fifth day. They were still using translation spells, and so it came out in perfect Russian so that Nikolai was able to understand. He angled his small head up to look at Lucius as best he could whilst they were walking down a snowy pavement. He nodded. "I belive that at the end of this week, you should meet your new mother." Nikolai had marvelled at that, too.
"Please call this number if you see him again. Thank you." And with that, they disappeared from the door, heading down the landing. Harry shut the door in a state of shock, card still clutched tightly in his hand. He looked down at it. It appeared to be a buisness card, not only supplying a number. It was addressed by a man named 'Lucius Malfoy'. Harry wasn't sure what emotion possessed him more: anger, shock or the depression of being betrayed. The music had stopped, no longer floating dreamily from the kitchen. As he rounded the corner to enter, he saw Aidan beginning to tidy away the expensive champagne glasses. His hands were shaking though, and he dropped one, shards smashing at his feet.
Fact of the chapter: Most of this was actually written in an astronomy lecture as well as ancient history lecture with my brother (he provides some very fun P.O.V's), and I can recommend not to ignore important lectures in favour of writing fanfic, because now I have no idea what is happening in my course, but my teacher absolutely loves me so I recon I'll be fine.
They walked in utter silence, the type that was appreciated but awkward. Grey trotted alongside them, glaring at anything and everything that moved, most of which seemed to enchanted paintings who remarked rudely upon the appearance of such a creature in muttered tones. Draco hoped Lupin didn't hear, and by the look of him, he didn't.
Supposedly, this timeline was a little different in my drafts and a lot more like the musicals timeline, but I had to change it so that the songs make sense in the sense in the fact that in the musical, Jace (Represented by Harry in the fic) is very fast to let Judith (Represented by Draco) into his house and let her explain herself. This way I thought it would better stretch out the story, and have more of Harry's personality coming through, because Harry is no where near as trusting as Jace, lol. (It's totally ok if you've never seen the musical and don't understand this, it will all be gone through in time.)
It gave him a searching look. Draco put up one of his hands from where it was crossed and raised an eyebrow. The kelpie gave an annoyed snort and nuzzled its coat.
"He wrote me, yes." She responded, quietly, but not so quiet as to sound reclusive. Draco sighed, and she looked up at him, as if realising for the first time that her son was seventeen, not ten.
