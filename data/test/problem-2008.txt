Draco frowned slightly. “Is it possible that maybe he’s not achieving all the skills he should be able to have at this age?”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I’m not letting Maurice alone. He doesn’t have family, neither do I. I think it would be nice to spend Christmas with him.”
“I’m serious, Draco.” Harry shook his head. “He’s done so much bad shit. I want to get him for
“This is not the last time we’ve talked about this! You’re still my son and I will do anything in my power so you won’t throw your life away.” He swore a few more things as he opened the door and walked out.
Neville looked up and grinned broadly. “I cannot believe it! The future Head Auror in my department!? My life has been turned upside down, I believe!”
The man smiled broadly and Draco was sure that he saw him wink at Potter. “Oh, don’t worry about me. I saw this in the post today and decided to come by you first, Sirius!”
As he turned to his side, he saw the door opening again and this time Neville walked in, though it looked more as if he was also getting ready for bed. Harry pulled the blanket closer just as his phone vibrated.
“So you could come in here, if you felt like talking to me. Was that not a good idea?” he asked and pulled the TV out again while turning to glance at his ward who frowned slightly.
With what little strength he had left, he apparated himself and Draco right into his living room. After that, he closed the wards with a flick of his hand. Draco stood there, still in dog form, staring at him as if he couldn’t understand what just happened.
Draco frowned at her and shook his head unable to believe that there was in fact something he could potentially do! “What?”
Aurora scurried inside and after about ten seconds, Alamar saw her owl head appear at the door again. She meowed quietly and her tail seemed to point at the direction of a magical trigger. Eric quickly placed a charm around it and they cautiously entered the magically watched home. Every movement was carefully chosen and while Eric placed stabilizing charms around the triggers and Aurora searched for them, Alamar gently removed the hateful charms on some pictures and where else Dumbledore had placed them.
Harry chuckled and closed the door behind him, placing the raincoat on a chair, when he seemed to have felt Draco staring at him. He turned at looked down the hall to where Draco was standing in the open door.
“Of course, Minerva!” Eric got up as well and hugged her, before she followed Alamar to the front door.
Charlie held out a potion. “This is Memento Mei” she said, looking at Draco and then at Harry. “It’s a potion which is supposed to give the brain a little nudge into opening closed off sections, such as memories.”
Remus rolled his eyes, grabbing a cup for himself, when Harry grabbed the other two, bringing Draco one as well. They sat down at the table, where Draco was sitting. “How can you make Teddy eat carrots?! He never ate them when I try and give them to him!”
“We said, you need to lie once” Dean said and frowned.
Out of nowhere, Alamar suddenly remembered something weird. He turned to his husband. “Do you remember Harry’s parchment?” Alamar asked.
His husband’s expression softened and he smiled lovingly. “Anything for you, my love.”
He wanted to keep talking, but his voice didn’t make a sound anymore. Draco frowned looking at his friends trying to find out who did something like that, but they all seemed as surprised as he was. Finally, he turned to the Gryffindors and saw Hermione shaking her head disapprovingly.
In fact, he had seen it and fixed the man called Connor with a stern look. “Did you open my mail again, Conner? What did I say about that?”
Frowning, Severus smiled weakly. “Because I’m not letting you wander through life without a plan, Draco. What do you want to do after Hogwarts?”
The peace was disturbed when Padfoot, lying on the floor in front of Harry, whimpered and got up. Harry looked at his dog and put the book aside. Before he could do anything, Padfoot walked right up to Draco and made a heartbreaking sound. It was almost a sob.
“What do you mean?” Draco shook his head.
“What, I’m not allowed to say the truth?”
His husband grinned broadly as he finally walked towards him, leaning into a kiss. Harry pulled him closer. This was where he belonged. He really couldn’t think he would have been happy with anybody else. Draco was all he needed – his strong, masculine smell, his loving eyes, the smirk on his lips. Everything seemed to just belong to him, because Draco was his.
Pansy had by now joined them under the tree as well, putting an arm around Draco. “Face it darling, Harry’s got both of you outsmarted. We all know that neither of you wants to go up that tree.”
Potter grabbed his waist and pulled him closer. “I wouldn’t say that” he whispered and kissed him, which in the end did wipe the smug grin off Draco’s face.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the twins standing at the door towards the kitchen, and they stood there in the perfect view of little Harry. So, before his ward could get back into his own head, he turned to him and grinned.
After a minute, the guard came back. “You need to go to the visitor’s area, Mr. Potter. We need the Dementors to go around, looking for him.”
“Good morning, Minerva” Harry said and smirked when the cat only looked at him. “From one cat Animagus to the other: You’re a little too focused for an innocent little animal.”
“Can I see?” Dominique asked, incredibly interested.
Draco nodded. “Guess your
That could work... Harry frowned. “So... having fun? And then asking them out?”
“Harry?”
“Ian, anything I can help you with?” he asked, probably out of annoyance. He grabbed a fork and took away Draco’s plate, starting to eat something from it.
Harry nodded and smiled weakly. “I know you didn’t do it. I think some people thought you were the one to kill him.”
Dean and Seamus had apparently heard something and so Harry tried his hardest not to make a sound, though with Draco on the way of giving him a love bite, that was almost entirely impossible. Somehow, he still managed and Seamus started talking again.
“So now what?” Harry asked and looked at his husband. “Just drop the act and tell them that we’re married? You’re no longer called Malfoy and we let them have their fun?”
This statement meant more to him that he was ready to admit and Draco nodded. “Thank you, Molly!”
“Oi, Malfoy!” Ron called out, shaking his head. It seemed as if he genuinely believed they had entered a parallel universe. Since where else would Malfoy throw a snowball at Harry without a hex right after it?!
Anyway, I’m looking forward to talking to you again, soon. Give my love to your families and I’ll update on my lovely cat and Cerberus again as soon as there is anything to update.
“I’m sorry I haven’t answered your last letter yet, Draco” Remus smiled apologetically. “I’ve been travelling around the country meeting experts and... I’ve been busy.”
Draco nodded. “I will make sure to do so, Sir.”
“Will they stay?” he asked, really hoping that it was maybe just a ritual wound and not a magical one. Magical scars couldn’t be healed; however, ritual scars only needed time to be gone.
“Don’t worry, love.” Alamar smiled lovingly and grabbed himself a cup of tea while re-heating Eric’s as well. Aurora meowed and jumped onto Eric’s lap, rubbing her head on his chin.
On the field stood Neville, creating a ditch. He looked up when Harry opened the gate and walked onto the dirt. “Good afternoon, Neville. I thought you had to work today?”
“Really?” Charlie quirked an eyebrow and grinned then. “I see. Two tickets then?”
Harry frowned and turned to Alamar who was chuckling and shook his head. “Who is she? And why did she call you lovely?”
Charlie suddenly widened his eyes and grinned. “Since you’re here, Harry, are you interested in my Dragon Show? It’s mostly about dragons and showing people how to safely work with them, even in the wild. My friends also have other magical animals, but well” he shrugged and chuckled, “people know how to work with smaller animals. Dragons are continuously one of the most misunderstood creatures. I still have four or five tickets for friends and family.”
Everyone sitting on their hidden spot looked at Harry, knowing that he was going back to his actual fourth year behavior. It was however Theodore who spoke up: “Even though your Gryffindor friends would have believed you now, we don’t. What is it?”
Harry, Alamar and Eric move once again deeper into Russia.
Draco Malfoy sat alone at his kitchen table. Quite depressive really. Well, much like the rest of his small apartment. He had never much liked Christmas time. People having fun, meeting friends, talking about how much they had done last year. He hadn’t done anything.
Lucas was laughing loudly, but calmed down eventually. “What thing?”
While Severus was quiet, Draco frowned, trying to find out what in Merlin’s name was going on! Finally, his godfather decided to speak up: “Well, if you’re concerned about getting a name…” He hesitated, before getting up and walking over to his bookshelf, grabbing a few papers. “I was thinking about giving you a name back. I know the Snapes aren’t as pureblood as the Malfoys and that the amount of money will probably never be the same again, but…”
Ginny nodded. “He wanted to come today, but Hogwarts has an emergency, so he changed the dates last second.”
“Title?”
“I don’t know, Pansy. Ever since I woke up when I was eighteen and realized I was a Slytherin… They seem to have gone from a trio to a duo.” Harry sighed. Draco thought he had seen a little sadness in his eyes. However, if that was the case, Harry expertly hid it again, when he smiled at them. “I mean, I am happy for them, but I felt a little alone. And I also wondered whether or not I’m that easily replaceable or forgettable?”
Pansy agreed. “So, let’s talk about the apartment. What would you want from us living here? For rent, I mean.”
Harry sat there, wondering. Yes, he should be learning and doing other things, but he couldn’t concentrate. Not really, anyway. He had danced long enough around a specific wizard. It was time to finally do something about it. The only problem was that he had no idea what or how to do any of it.
“Fine.” The Slytherin opened his eyes and smirked. “Leave! I need time to pack my suitcase for the inevitable train crash that’s happening in a few days. I cannot wait to be in your arms again.”
Nodding, Draco grabbed the tray of beer and walked over to the men. Ever since then he had never sat down until Potter closed and locked the doors at one a.m. and he fell groaning into a chair, eyes almost closed.
“True” Pansy shrugged her shoulders and they once again walked after McGonagall who was explaining something to a few former students. They walked down to the forbidden forest, where they could see a few new things that had nothing to do with the fight.
“Sorry for ruining your fun” Blaise said and held up his hands. “I was honestly about to run over and punch Hermione for her stupidity. Draco had to tell me the truth to keep me from hurting her.”
Alamar chuckled and started with a simple breakfast, while Eric nodded and walked over to Harry to sit on the floor. “There’s ‘magic’ and then there’s the second layer of it. We call it ‘Draíocht’. It’s the living, breathing personification of magic; sometimes the wizards call it Lady Magic. Wizards use magic and it works fine, but if you want to have acceptance of magic and want to use it without much effort and know that whatever you do, it will turn out fine, you have to ask Draíocht to be your guide.”
Your father tells me that you have Harry in your shop and that you called him your boyfriend? I have never heard this from Harry himself, which confused me further.
Harry chuckled. “Thank you for telling me then.”
“Malfoy, why won’t you tell us what you did to them?” Weasley crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. It looked as if he thought he could assert dominance by that.
Chuckling softly, Draco shook his head, checking for something to eat in the basket and found some sandwiches with different contents. He grabbed one and leaned back, looking over the Black Lake. For a while, they silently watched the waves, the creatures under water and the few clouds rushing through the sky.
He raised his eyebrows and frowned at them. “And pray tell… how is my timing of the utmost importance in this precise moment?”
He carefully opened the portrait, feeling Draco’s hands on his ass. Smirking over his shoulder, he blew the blond wizard a kiss and left their secret hiding spot, rushing through the halls back to the Common Room, hoping that nobody was inside. He smelled a little too much like Draco right now.
He saw Potter smirk slightly, but Ian luckily hadn’t seen it. He turned to Draco with a vivid look. “You’re just his rebound guy, man! Get off your high horse! And get me something to eat, I’m a food critic.”
“Nothing.”
Harry held up his hands. “I feel like everyone in my life has transformed into a Slytherin. Since when do you have Draco’s traits of promising to do something but only if I do something in return.”
“Well, I believe my lies, so until I’m out of Hogwarts, it’s all fine.” Draco was so in his argument with his godfather, that he hadn’t realised Harry was standing right next to him.
Frowning, Alamar shook his head. “And how do you go to school then?”
Harry also seemed very convinced that he was going to die any day now, with his best friends spending so much time with him. On some days, Draco read almost a note telling the reader what a nice life he’d had – as if he was saying goodbye. On other days, the entry was full of memories and things he probably didn’t want to forget.
“Peepaw!” Lily screamed and jumped up, running at Severus, who jumped himself, before laughing and picking up his granddaughter. Draco grinned at that. It was nice of Severus to come by, especially now that his life has gotten so much more complicated - he had been offered the job of headmaster again by the Ministry. The rumors said that the Ministry begged him to accept the position, after McGonagall decided to leave after the summer. Well, the actual story was that the Ministry had about ten other candidates ready, but McGonagall refused to accept anybody else. She had even threatened to keep the position after her death by turning herself into a ghost. Apparently, the Ministry didn't want to be blamed for turning Minerva McGonagall into a ghost, so they gave Severus the position. Pansy had said that int he end, even Kingsley stepped in and outvoted other people on this mess. So at least the Minister stood behind this decision.
“If you promise me to play a song once more, some time, I will not pressure you into playing right now” Harry offered, while he handed out a few more drinks.
Daisy seemed surprised, looked at Potter with narrowed eyes and nodded then. “Oliver told him to take vitamin pills with his food, since it seems he’s lacking a few of those.”
Draco swallowed and with a quick glance at his godfather, he sat down as well, Severus following quickly too.
Harry snorted. “Because I’ve hired you?”
“Pansy, no.”
Draco shook his head again. “I don’t even know if he’s gay! Nobody knows!”
“You know, sometimes I think you’re a vision as well” Harry brought Draco out of his thoughtful state.
Sitting down on Harry’s bed, Draco placed a calming hand on Harry’s arm. “Harry, wake up, bear! You’re not… on that cemetery. Come on, bear, you’re safe. The world has changed.”
“You’re a very good boy, Padfoot” he whispered. “Dad will be a little funny for a couple of days, okay? But we still love each other.” He grinned, before he got up again and decided to walk to the kitchen and ask if they had some dog food or if he should be buying something from somewhere. Seeing Hermione’s confused look and the way she was frowning at him when he left, made it almost worth it, coming here.
Draco sighed and looked down at his sleeping ward. He looked so peaceful, as if nothing could hurt him and actually, Draco had to fight the tears. Luckily, Madam Pomfrey had her back turned again, so she couldn’t see what was going through his mind. Or rather facial expression.
“But that’s what you’re looking for, Malfoy. Someone who would help you get out of all this pureblood pressure.”
“You’re crazy” Potter said quietly, while Draco couldn’t stop himself from kissing the other man’s temple.
“So, I’m officially telling you, that I can’t continue with this whole thing. You know, my mother actually died and she seemed happy for me. So, that was all I needed.”
Potter started talking, though he was slurring the words. Draco listened and could figure out most of what the Saviour was talking about. The winery was one of a few that had a vineyard right next to it. It was small so they didn’t have that much wine on hand. However, people loved it.
“First thing that came to my mind” Draco answered, shrugging his shoulders.
“It’s good team work” Harry chuckled. “I’ve heard Draco looks forwards to getting a good shower with some peace and quiet.”
“Well then” Eric sighed and rolled his eyes. “I think we’re leaving this town as soon as possible.”
Ginny nodded and grinned. “You can ask Harry, it’s rather difficult to get my blessing.”
Harry had just about had enough time to go home, quickly jump under the shower to clean himself from the prison cell dirt and put on something nice for the Christmas Masquerade Ball. He was already late when he apparated away from his home and landed on the front lawn of the Malfoy Mansion. Hurrying towards the entrance, he put on his mask, which was green and white checkered with a few smaller details. Then, just to complete the charm of being unknown, he placed a spell on himself which would hide his identity from people, as long as he was going to wear the mask.
Harry started laughing and Draco chuckled as well, while even Remus laughed over how clumsy this thing was. Remus stepped in front of the Boggart and it quickly transformed into little Teddy… transforming into a werewolf.
Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Jason got the news and we went to talk to the Minister. Actually” he hesitated and looked at the piano keys. “He wasn’t in his office, so went down to the holding cells to maybe find you and figure out what happened.”
A lot of voices called through the house. Everyone was looking for the little boy. Lovegood checked behind the Christmas tree, the twins systematically looked into all of the rooms, Molly even prepared a spell that could locate Draco’s ward. By now, even Granger and Weasel had come out and helped looking through all the rooms. Weaslette stayed in the kitchen, looking at all of the cupboards and…
Draco frowned. “What do you mean new stats?” He was aware that he wasn’t answering her question, but he would rather know what was going on with this thing than making a decision too fast.
And they had stayed in this room for the whole day and night – though they had cleaned up the room and… the sheets.
Draco smiled weakly. “Courage isn’t about being strong enough to run into the next best fight, bear. Courage is about being afraid, but still taking the next step. Being prepared. And I will help you with it. I promise.”
Rolling her eyes, Hannah turned to Hermione. “
Draco still didn’t know if that was supposed to be an insult or not, since Pansy and Jason laughed at that when they came by to say hello to their new guest.
It clearly wasn’t a portrait, so how Malfoy could have not seen them was beyond Harry’s understanding. He carefully stepped into the sun-drenched living room. It seemed as if he was stepping through time as he suddenly found the room not in its dusty and forgotten state. The couch was snow white, the windows cleaned and the old piano seemed to have been played only moments ago. The table and the three chairs had lost all the dust and shone in a beautifully rich dark brown. There were paw prints of a dog on the floor and in the middle of the table stood a bowl full of fresh fruit. The soft white curtains billowed in the evening wind blowing in from the outside through an open window. The only thing missing was a steaming cup of tea to sell the image of people using this space right now. It looked as if the people who had been living here had just left an hour ago to get something from the city.
You left your weekly planner at our home! You were supposed to have a ‘FLANNE MEETNG’ with someone called JenMa?  How is anyone able to read your handwriting?! I put a spell on it so no one can read it but the original owner and gave it to Ron. He’s going to the Leaky. Go meet my big brother, you giant old softy.
“What did ye mean then?” Harry jerked by the sudden voice next to him and he turned to see Seamus next to him walking. Dean was also pretty much behind them and Harry hoped that they hadn’t heard everything.
Hey, short update:
Harry nodded. “I am, Malfoy. Not here, obviously, but maybe somewhere else?”
Well, when he got up and left the back room of the apothecary, he stopped and widened his eyes. There he found a heavily pregnant Hermione. He hadn’t seen his friend in quite some time. The last time was about seven years ago when Molly had invited him to Christmas again and he had accepted because he thought he had to.
The sudden and blunt question surprised Draco and he frowned at his friend, before looking at the crib, where his ward was sleeping. “I don’t understand what you mean. His magic chose me and I…”
She smiled, clearly a little shy and came a bit closer. “Why don’t you want to go back? If your boss is giving you a promotion, shouldn’t you want to go back there? I always thought promotions were a good thing.”
And so, while Neville walked closer, Harry kept the same distance between them, walking backwards. “Well, I meant the proposition of moving in together. Either here or wherever you want to live. We’re moving so slowly and maybe that is indeed my mistake, but I want to...”

“Oh, yes. And no, I haven’t invented a relationship, I’m not that creative.” Harry chuckled and motioned to the flyers on the table. “Which you’ve told me countless times with my marketing.” He needed her attention on something else. With all the questions Hermione and Ron were asking him about his clearly fabricated boyfriend, he really needed to find a way out of this small lie. This stupid one liner he had once said to get Molly off his back had taken on a whole new life of its own.
When he finally turned back to the table, he leaned at the door frame. His lovely dog walked up and sympathetically rubbed herself against his leg. Petting her head, Harry sighed. “So, do you want something of that?”
Draco snorted. “Go, darling. It won’t be hard to find him! Along the way, if I find Pansy or Blaise, I’ll let them know that Hermione gave you a love potion and make strange remarks that should make them realize what she has given you. Just imagine her realizing that she made you a fertility potion instead of a normal love potion.”
It was as if Mother Magic had decided to make him pay for everything he had done in the past. Well, she really shouldn’t have tried too hard. He already felt terrible. His mother was on house arrest for a year, his father stayed in Azkaban for the unforeseen future and he himself was on parole. He needed to finish Hogwarts with good marks, find a respectable job and stay out of trouble for the next ten years.
He sighed and gave Draco a letter to Potter which was obviously written by Weasley. Draco read everything and handed the letter back. “Thank you, Oskar” He said quickly and left just as quickly. Otherwise he would have had to listen to another lecture of how Oskar felt he had betrayed his favourite person and stuff like that.
Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “That’s just practical knowledge, Theo. When you’re on the run you can’t really take huge things with you, so we shrunk everything. Most things, actually, not everything.”
“That is not really calming, Harry.” Millicent frowned and crossed her left leg over her right. She seemed like a professional journalist that way.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Coffee? What kind of potion is that?!”
Harry smirked. “Suggestions?” he winked at Draco which made him snigger and Neville groan in frustration and roll his eyes. Padfoot looked up and barked quickly before he turned on his back.
“McGonagall found out about this and forced Theo to stop holding you hostage and I offered to play mediator” the other Gryffindor explained. Draco chuckled.
“Are you certain you want to do this?” Draco asked, though he was in love with how Harry thought of others too. Well, that was Harry’s personality, to be honest.
He had taken off his coat and glanced over at Draco with what seemed to be an amused expression. Draco frowned quickly, though returned the smile without thinking and sat down behind his desk in the back room.
“No, you’re not.” Theodore shook his head.
Anybody up for a little fluff? This chapter was somehow incredibly easy to write and now I'm stuck again, though I hope you don't have to wait too long for the next one :)
“Thank you!” Baby Potter answered, grinning.
Fleur leaned closer and whispered: “He looks at you even softer than that. You two are the cutest couple out there.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. They were taking it slow. That was at least a good sign – Pansy wasn’t lost entirely. “Well, she heard you talk to some people today about how Slytherin’s are messed up and...”
Draco chuckled. “I love you too, you idiot! I want to be with you until I can’t remember my own name anymore.”
The young lady walked over and brought a small platter of food, almost making heart eyes at Potter, who didn’t seem to notice it. Draco was wondering whether or not Potter could be having an affair with all his clients. That would seem like something this savior would do. There was clearly no man in this country who would mind the oh so holy Potter having fun with their wives.
Alamar laughed loudly and shook his head. “You’re being too kind, love. We both know it took you quite some time to get me to trust you.”
He cast the tempus spell seeing that it wasn’t even four in the morning. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. In the faint green light of the projected time, Draco had a rather good view of Harry. He was breathing calmly and seemed completely relaxed. And somewhat content. Draco could only smile over this. How far they both had come! He was extremely proud of Harry. Draco knew that he shouldn’t be proud, but his instincts over Harry couldn’t be changed. This man had stolen his heart.
Draco grinned and shrugged his shoulders. “I mean, you said it a few moments ago, right? I’m a rebel.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry sighed. “Well, yeah. Some random wizard came up to me when I was really young, and he thanked me. I also know that Uncle Vernon was about to kill him. I do remember Hagrid telling me how my parents died. My aunt and uncle said they died in a car accident.” He stopped and rubbed his forehead, before he looked back at Draco. “I don’t remember my parents at all. Do you know if they... did they like me?”
“Do you think they’re proud of me?” Harry asked, whispering. It seemed as if he wasn’t willing to destroy the quiet of the nature.
Draco had to be honest that the usually neat handwriting had gotten a little bit out of control, but it wasn’t bad. And as he turned the page, the writing was back. Neat, tidy, incredibly controlled.
Severus got up and walked through the gate, while Potter actually pouted over the loss of his playing friend. He sat down on his arse and stared daggers into the back of Severus’ head, until he turned around and somehow created an old-looking teddy bear which made baby Potter clearly incredibly happy. The teddy bear was yellow and looked incredibly soft, with a fire red bow tie and a green knitted jacket firmly locked in place. Potter was now actually laughing over the bear.
Potter closed the door and slowly walked up the stairs, basically dragging an extremely tired Draco behind him. This time, Draco was realizing how the Gryffindor brought him to the Saviour’s room, but he couldn’t even care about it.
She crossed her arms over her chest and finally shook her head. “I cannot believe that you prioritized Draco and Harry’s relationship over me, Mr. future Head Auror!”
“Any leads?”
“You know, Pansy tells me I was a happy baby, not friendly.” Harry smirked when he turned back to the stove, finishing brunch.
“You walk into the bedroom with shoes on.”
Harry looked at his best mate and frowned. Ron had a huge family, right? If he asked him about how to approach asking someone out, he could use his knowledge of how others in his family had done it and maybe this would help him?
“You came!” he greeted Draco before he had the time to say something.
Since the chime had sounded over the door, there was someone walking out from the back, while Harry stared at the colorful array of joke articles. Honestly, Draco also couldn’t stop looking around. It looked and felt so happy to be in here and a soft smile crept on his face as he watched Harry walk towards a huge assortment of bigger and smaller explosions with different colors.
“I’m in love with you too.”
Severus huffed and shook his head. “You should never pretend to be something you’re not just so people like you.”
Draco shook his head. “Harry, I was so scared! I couldn’t find you! Why are you here?”
“Are you sure Harry wanted to go to the lake?” Theodore asked and looked around. They walked closer to the edge of the lake, where you could see most of the land.
“What are you talking about? He loves you! You and Weasel and Ginny... He’s always around you!” Draco shook his head and sighed again.  This was slowly just becoming too much.
“But it is” Nicolai grinned, while Draco rolled his eyes. However, he grinned as well.
“Harry!” Ron called out and hugged him. “How’s America treating you?”
Harry nodded and got up with some difficulties. “I’ll head to bed. You are very welcome to stay in whatever room you’d like. Everything in the upper floors is empty; I haven’t been up there in a year.”
Shaking his head, he let go of the backpack and fell into the bed. He was asleep before he could even form a decent thought.
. And you mess it up! Where are my plates you ungrateful bastard!?”
Before he reached the Common Room, his phone vibrated and he took it out to find a text from Draco.
Also: Shorter chapter, but a lot of fluff for your hearts! <3
With shaking hands, he opened the letter, looked over to insure that Pansy kept a good look on Potter and after confirming that she did, he sighed and turned to the writing.
He chuckled and rubbed Potter’s back. “You’re not the first to tell me.”
By the way, Luna and I are having a brunch on Sunday. Please tell me you can make it and !!!!! I want some of that awesome Christmas Glühwein. Nothing beats yours. Unless you give me the recipe, you have to bring some. Please.
“Well, those were old newspapers, weren’t they? Ronald Weasley told us a few hours ago that he left for Australia a week ago! I need to you stop running around Scotland without being able to find Potter. The hearing is in two weeks!”
Happy Mother's Day! In honour of Draco and Pansy who are amazing parents, I have decided to give you another chapter ;) Next update will be on Tuesday.
“Open it!” Draco said and smiled broadly.
Draco rubbed his back and kissed his forehead again. “Because I think I know what kind of love potion she used and she has no idea what she just did.”
Draco shook his head, remembering the baby bible. “I’m not your dad, Potter!” He got up and grabbed the teddy bear, before handing it over to Potter. “There you go. For future references, Potter: You know you can crawl over to your toy and just play there, right?!”
It wasn’t fair to the owl, Draco knew that, but he just didn’t want to have any other connection with his family. Without reading the letter, Draco walked into his room, where he placed his satchel and then walked back out towards the lake, where he was sure he would be able to find his ward and Pansy.
“Hello fellow Aurors” he said smirking. “Welcome to our first solo gig.”
“Ay ay, mama” Blaise said, which earned him a glaring look from Pansy and a laugh from everyone else, including Potter, who was clearly just laughing because everyone else was.
“Yeah, but how long ago was this fight? And why hasn’t anyone been in here to fix it?” Harry asked aloud. The orb just floated in the middle of the room, while Harry kept looking around.
Draco also had problems staying on Harry’s track, as he had started to laugh as well and it made it hard to concentrate on running and following his ward’s steps. Pansy on the other hand had taken over the leadership of the chase. And well, Hermione was following closely behind.
Severus raised his eyebrows as Draco turned to the door and grinned over his godfather’s answer. “Peach? That’s highly unlikely to achieve. Well, to achieve a nice taste with peach. Anything easier? Strawberry? Coffee?”
“It’s not that I’m worried about, dear. Children are expensive, you know” Molly genuinely seemed worried.
A whole pile of snow fell down onto the twins (just a little revenge for having lost sight of Harry). The room was filled with muffled screams from under the snow and after a second, there was a huge fit of laughter following out of the cupboard.
broken, Harry. You are so strong that nobody could get you to crack!” he said quietly.
“Hi Moony!” he said and beamed up at him.
That wasn’t the life he had wanted to live. He wanted to see the world, travel the continents, see things he had never seen before! He wasn’t even supposed to live past his second year, now he had defeated the death curse twice and what had he done with it? Nothing. His past self would have probably been mad at him for that.
Harry rolled his eyes when Theodore walked out of their room. “I think I’ve made a rather powerful enemy” he chuckled and pulled Draco back into bed.
“Eric makes the best cookies ever!”
Harry shoved Draco with his shoulder and grinned. “You’re the worst husband. And I also hate that Daphne made it sound like we married because of true love or something.”
Draco frowned. “He walked into a tree?”
“I just want this week to be over.”
Draco smirked, though hid it quickly, when Pansy rolled her eyes. “Harry, come on! You can’t just… give us a place to live in! Especially if it’s that amazing and probably expensive!”
“Charlie, what’s the worst that could happen?” Pansy asked, carefully.
He grinned as he walked outside where Padfoot raced around and played with a rather obvious cat. Harry smirked as he recognized Minerva’s cat form finally escaping Padfoot’s playful nature when she climbed up a tree and sat there on a branch, cleaning her paw. Harry’s service dog looked rather sad that his playmate had escaped. He looked at her for a short while, before accepting his fate and walking to another tree, where he sniffed for something.
“True. You also know that you can always go and ask him whatever. I also think both of you share the same liking for alcohol” Harry grinned.
Harry nodded somewhat careful and silently and placed some food on his plate. Not as much as Draco had, but he was able to eat more now. At least that was what he had told Draco.
Sighing, Eric nodded and placed the map on his bow. “I just really wish all this was over.” He got up and grabbed two plates from the box and a few glasses.
He wanted to add a few more things, when a knock at the door, made both Slytherins look up. When Pansy opened it, Harry stood there, grinning at them. “Draco, I realized I never thanked you for Dag! So thank you! Thank you so much!” He beamed and walked into the room, hugging Draco.
Suddenly, there was silence from the back and the Slytherins turned around to look at Potter looking a little shorter than usual. Severus stared at him and when the Gryffindor looked up there was something like panic in his eyes.
Harry grinned and pretended not to realize. “Thank you, Minerva.” He grabbed a bottle of Swiss mountain apple juice and went back to the table, sitting down next to an empty space. Theodore seemed to be the only one noticing something weird, though he didn’t say anything and Harry was absolutely not going to spoil his fun by revealing what was going to happen soon.
“Harry, where are you?!”
“Nice to meet you” Terrance said and smiled at Hermione.
“Back to you, Potter” Theodore said impatiently.
“I could think of worse things that we’re going to do” Harry said after reading it and shrugged his shoulders. “I’m just not sure what’s going to happen with this scavenger hunt. So I’m not sure I like the sound of that.”
He inhaled deeply and rubbed his temples. The first time they had met, he had said ‘pretty arse’... he was clearly flirting. Why? Since when was Potter interested in men?!
“No, I think I should look into that a little bit more.”
Hermione shook her head disapprovingly. “Are you dating him? Because that is the only excuse I’m allowing for you talking about him
“Can you still like... make whatever you want?” Harry asked with wide eyes.
Harry smiled at her. “Thank you, 'Mione. You don't have to, you know that, right?”
Remus chuckled, quite obviously at how much… affection Harry seemed to portray in this small sentence. Draco simply rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything.
“Weapon? He’s a child, Albus!”
Smiling slightly, Pansy nodded. “Almost, dear: Say ‘H’ for
Shaking his head, Harry got up. “Well, ladies, I’ll let you find out on your own. I’m heading to bed, it was a long day.”
Harry grinned. “What do you mean with why?”
Harry shook his head. “No matter what Draco, you’re first.”
“I haven’t.” Remus admitted and shrugged his shoulders. “My two favorite Hogwarts students then.”
Now, even Harry had started to laugh and that was honestly all Draco had wanted to achieve. “I’m always dramatic, Dray.”
While Dudley could already write and read, Harry had to teach himself in his cupboard with books he stole from his cousin. At least he could already count to fifteen
Draco took a sip of his now cold tea and stared at the next page. Harry had drawn a few animals, not perfectly as the porpotions were slightly off, though Draco liked to see that the perfect Savior had apparently also problems with other things. Still, this was getting worse and worse. He had never heard of a specific curse taking so many different ways to hurt a person.
. They hadn’t gone through the same thing Ron, Hermione and he had. And even though Hermione had her own problems right now and told them, that after the messy break-up she and Ron had, she didn’t want to see the two of them right now, Harry still received and wrote her letters. Ron would have probably listened to his weird feelings, but he didn’t want to involve him as well. And so, by the time he had reached the door, Nott and Malfoy were already trying to enter with force and all kinds of magic.
“In four months.”
Hearing their daughter drawing and singing to herself, feeling Harry so close and smelling his distinct perfume. He felt a kiss on his temple and smiled into Harry’s warm skin.
Draco nodded. “Makes sense to me. What was the scariest thing that happened there? You don’t… You don’t have to tell me, sorry.” He quickly apologized. Harry said he had nightmares about that. It probably wasn’t the best way to make him relive them now…
“No one’s big on fun, Eric. You should know that best. You and me against the rest of them, you remember?”
Draco nodded. “I’m not sure about Potter. He’s not sleeping that calmly anymore. It might be the age where his parents are killed.”
Harry chuckled and reached over the table, running his fingers along Draco’s jaw line. His eyes were so full of love and when he grabbed his hand and placed a kiss on the back of it, Harry couldn’t resist and smiled softly. All his fears that Draco would maybe want to divorce him after this week of ‘pretending’ were gone within a second. No, his husband wouldn’t go there. They were too much in love with each other.
“We’re not doing something so incredibly dangerous just to appeal to your curiosity and sex drive and for what it’s worth” Harry raised his eyebrows, blushing a little bit, “I’ve asked Hermione about that and she told me I’d have to seriously have lost it to even think of something so ridiculously risky.”
Surprisingly, an owl showed up – Dag had apparently seen Harry and decided to say hi. Harry was obsessed with him and had always some treats in his robes – which Dag definitely knew.
“Human trafficking is illegal, Draco.” Harry chuckled softly and Draco felt slightly better. “However, are you telling me, he’s going to choose your husband then? From the existing pool of purebred wizards?”
Harry took a deep breath to hopefully regulate his breathing. “It’s a non-magical assistance dog. He’s a little scared of all things magical.”
you made a tidal wave break over me.”
Blaise nodded. “Actually, Draco offered to plan our wedding. His partner has an event planning business and he wants to repay us for introducing him to Isaac.”
. There’s nothing magic can do to make us ‘be in love’ or whatever you all want us to pretend.”
That seemed to have helped Harry, as he nodded shyly and Dwarfbart carefully placed the spell on Harry. The small boy had closed his eyes and petted Aurora. He looked so little right now and even though he was six years old, he seemed to be too tiny.
“Yeah, he might run away afterwards.”
“Muggle idioms, I’m impressed.” Harry accio’ed his broom and they headed out to the Quidditch pitch, where Harry hoped he could maybe ask him out on an actual date after the game.
The whole Common Room – a few snakes were still staying there, waiting for their friends – were laughing along with Draco’s friends and he couldn’t stop himself from chuckling. Harry noticed him quickly and grinned, running at him and hugging him.
Harry grinned, fully aware of Pansy’s surprised expression. She looked like she had seen the ghost of Professor Snape who had said some last words which were just stupid like ‘I forgot to pack my boxershorts’ or something. Actually, the whole table had gotten eerily quiet, except for Blaise and Neville trying to hold back laughter.
Thy Rose
Draco smirked as he snuck past his godfather’s office and into the Common Room, letter in hand. Remus’ owl had found him in the library and he had only then realized how late it was. He had been studying Transfigurations with Hermione, driving her mad with all of his problems and he was sure he had confused her as well in the end. Luckily when he had snuck back, he had not been caught.
friends as well, Harry!” Pansy seemed to take offence to Harry’s sentence more than Draco thought she would.
“It’s just that…” Ron started and shrugged his shoulders. “You’re always gone and sneaking off. But we haven’t seen each other in quite some time, so I thought you didn’t want to talk to me… us.”
it! How can we find out where we have to go if we don’t have a map?!”
. Nobody could take it away. As much as he sometimes was afraid that someone would come and take his name, he knew Harry would never give up on him. And he knew he would be looking for him, should anything happen.
Harry chuckled and pulled out his phone. “Ginny’s writing me constantly.” He showed his screen and Draco could see what had made him snort.
“There might be something else what could help you here, Dray” Pansy said slightly mysterious.
Pansy chuckled and walked over to hug him. “At least you found out about it, darling. It would be weird with how much Harry’s got his eyes on you…”
Draco Lucius Malfoy
“Thank you.” Harry blushed and looked back on his parchment. “Then, Ravo walked into a tree and...”
“You can get beer tomorrow, Benjamin. Today, we pretend to be classy!”
Before he could finish, Pansy placed a quick kiss on his lips and silenced him effectively. “You can continue studying these plants, darling, I will make my escape now, rather than in two hours, when I can’t see people anymore only letters.”
After that he had realised that he didn’t have to go anywhere just because he felt the obligation to be the perfect person. He wasn’t perfect and neither was anybody around him. He had learned that from his boss Maurice.
Shaking his head, he turned back to the toddler. “It’s not that. We’ve spent a few years together when he was a baby. After Lily and James died I lost contact.” He got back up to his feet and looked at Draco. “When we met at Hogwarts, he didn’t remember me. So I’m a little surprised he remembers me now.”
“Draco?!” he called into the apartment and closed the door behind him. Nobody answered.
Meanwhile, Lily ran to her drawing again, grabbing the paper to go and show Severus. Draco kissed Harry and walked to the kitchen, grabbing some homemade ice tea and walked out to see all his favorite people sitting on the couch. Well, at least about to sit down. Apparently, Caellum had just woken up, as Harry was lifting him out of the crib and onto his arms, smiling down with such fatherly love and tenderness, that Draco had almost let go of the tray of ice tea.
Laughing over this surprise, George shook his head. “I cannot believe it! Harry Potter! In my shop! I need to call the newspaper!”
The other man licked his lips, still staring at the ground. He slowly looked up into Draco’s eyes. As soon as this happened, Draco forgot everything around him. They stood there for a few seconds, before he leaned in again.
Walking back up towards the castle, Harry caught Daphne and Draco in front of him getting slower and slower. He sped up his walking and separated from his group rather easily, until he had reached them about half way through to the castle.
“I don’t know, mate” Ron narrowed his eyes. “Last I’ve checked he still tries to give you extra challenges.”
“And what exactly is a good day?” he asked, sitting down by the table and pushing the journal to the middle.
Since you are the official Magical Guardian of Harry James Potter, it is of the utmost importance for you to appear in front of our Executer in case there are any goods that can’t be distributed. For your own information in preparing, we have listed all the other attendees. Please make sure to arrive early.
That role reversal was astounding. Draco nodded.
Draco shook his head. “No, it’s fine. One more day is nothing, right?”
“Hi Harry! Did you sleep well?” He asked with such an energy only small children and animals could have.
For the next few hours, he read about Harry’s worsening condition. He was getting black spots all over his body, couldn’t feel his legs on some days and sometimes, all he could do was lay there and he had only enough strength to write a sentence in the journal. His eating was still not getting better and all the potions the mediwitches tried didn’t work – even illegal ones.
Smiling softly, Harry leaned closer and pecked his husband on his lips.
“Are you okay, Dray?” his ward asked, slightly worried.
In the end, Hermione and Ginny were holding speeches as well, Harry applauding loudly and calling to them approvingly while all of Slytherin followed suit. Draco chuckled – Harry had changed so much in Slytherin. Would they have been so supportive of the other people without him? They had always looked after themselves, not the other houses. Harry had changed that and he had definitely been a big influence in house unity.
Draco laughed loudly and marched through the room. “So, have you finished the story, Harry?”
“It’s Potter, Pansy” Draco repeated, not really interested in going deeper into the matter. He decided to finally answer her question she had asked before winking at his ward. “So, I have to go to two classes, the rest is private tutoring by Severus and McGonagall.”
“Not really” he chuckled. “A little in over my head, to be honest.”
Harry chuckled. “Amazing, actually. Thanks for the call.”
“I was” Harry smiled and pretended that he didn’t notice anything different on himself. “I was in the forest and just needed to cool off a little.”
Harry nodded softly. “Draco.” He reached out and held him back by his arm. “Thank you. I don’t think I could have gone through all of this without you.”
“Never.”
Draco looked after his ward, hoping that there would be something they could deal with. He really wanted his ward back, the laughing, happy child he had known ever since… well since the beginning actually.
“If you define ‘easy’ as having to kidnap a child from a magically protected home surrounded by some of the strongest magic I’ve seen in my life connected with basically mind controlled relatives, sure.”
Potter nodded and stroked with Draco’s... or rather Benjamin’s brown hair. “Then why would you want to go back? You could... you could stay here with me.”
“I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking the last six months were but a dream. That was confusing.” Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “Other than that, it was a rather nice night.”
Before Draco could make himself known, someone knocked at the door and Potter opened it, cold air rushing the warm pub. He stepped back wordlessly and an older man entered. He looked at Potter closely and sighed.
“Stop it! Please!” Bill said and held his hand over his heart. “My poor old heart can only take so much of your love-sick actions. How are you still so… annoyingly in love?”
“Can I scare her?” Harry asked and an almost wicked grin spread over his face.
She leaned forward and put an arm around Draco’s shoulders. “Ronald has been telling everyone that he’d be a professor, once you take over Hogwarts.”
The Slytherin got up again and brushed some laughter tears out of his face. “First of all, it’s called ‘revenge’ and secondly, Potter,” his eyes were shining as if they wanted to turn into the sun during this snowy day. “Secondly, you needed something to distract you from all these pictures in your head.”
“Oh. I love you too, Dray.”
Smirking, Draco shook his head. “Finale? What are you talking about?”
“That I can do without any problems” Draco answered and got up.
Draco snorted and nodded. “Yes, go on and compare one gay couple to another gay couple.”
“Absolutely everything.” Harry shook his head and closed his eyes. Draco watched him closely and after a few silent moments, he placed the wine glass onto the table and ran his fingers through his hair. It relaxed him even more. “They want me to take over the Ministry. Be the Minister of Magic.”
“Don’t worry, darling. I’ll be all fine. See you sometime soon. I love you too.” Draco ended the call before Harry could and he shook his head smirking.
“We have an appointment, soldier Harry!” Draco said while he let him back onto the ground. His little laughing bear grinned and nodded, before running full speed at Theodore, who out of actual surprise screamed rather loudly and jumped to the side.
Apparently, even Blaise was on Pansy’s side… Well, no. Everyone was on her side. Weasley having left Harry behind just so he could go back to his warm and loving family… That wasn’t right. Whatever it was, Draco was more interested in the Horcruxes.
hurt him.”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Not really. Just because you guys are going to the kitchen and I want to go there as well, doesn’t mean I’m following you.”
Harry looked up, surprised. “What?”
High Executer, Department of Will Assessments, Ministry of Magic, London
“The real surprise, however” McGonagall continued as she opened a drawer in her desk and took out a parchment “was the fact that there is apparently a game going on.”
“So?” Potter glared at him. Draco finally seemed to see the real Potter, though this man seemed to be very broken. “I have no one who cares about me even remotely to be sad about my death.” He seemingly wanted to add something, but stopped himself. After a short moment, he still added something. “The only people that care about me are dead. I have seen more death than anyone my age should have. In fact, I should be dead as well.”
Just so you know, here are mine:
Blaise, Pansy and Draco laughed and the latter hugged his ward. Meanwhile, Theodore had walked closer and frowned at them. “What in Salazar’s name are you laughing about? Slytherin’s should be emotionless creatures! Well” he smirked, “according to everyone else, mind you.”
“I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Eric held his heart and fell to his knees, as if he was in fact wounded and couldn’t go on. Harry looked at Alamar who had quite a lot of trouble hiding his smirk. He wordlessly poured some more hot chocolate into a cup and walked from behind the kitchen island to place the cup in his hands.
The best thing he could come up with was rolling his eyes. “Oh that” he snorted. “That’s just some random color. Don’t worry about it.” He was delighted in seeing Ron’s suspicious glance at him, before he narrowed his eyes and looked at the red color again.
I will be there on the 15th, I promise. And tell Ron he has my phone number, he can write as well. Or if he prefers the owl post, I still get it as well. Tell him: IT’S CRISTMAS; I AM FREAKING BUSY EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. You can scream at him if you want. That’s all from me. See you soon.
Professor McGonagall... Minerva looked up slightly surprised and smiled. “I thought you and Draco Malfoy had married.”
While Ron started to argue over that, the door opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow. They seemed to be talking about a former Slytherin Prefect who had been sent to Azkaban and was now free again, since the Ministry had admitted to just imprisoning him due to lack of any actual investigation. What did Harry had in common with the Slytherin? They hated each other over the past few years, they studied at Hogwarts, they fought in a battle... Nothing really positive...
A loud and frustrated sounding voice made Draco look to his right and frown at the baby, who clearly wasn’t happy that they weren’t focusing on him anymore. Before he could do anything, Pansy was by Potter’s side with a bottle of whatever that she had probably gotten from an elf. She took him into her arms and sat down on the opposite side of Draco again.
“True, he does have a temper. But can we go and try to get him out there?” Draco asked and turned to both Jason and Pansy.
…” he turned to Draco and emphasized his name, which made him roll his eyes.
Laughing, Harry shook his head. “I somehow find that hard to believe.”
As a matter of fact, Draco spotted his ward sitting on a window sill, knees up to his chest and hugging his legs while he looked out of the window, where a magical storm was raging. Draco sighed in relief and quickly cast a Patronus to Severus with the message ‘yes’. He then cast two more for Pansy and Millicent only telling them to go and eat dinner.
“Good evening, Harry!” Severus greeted the former Gryffindor and when Draco saw him, he looked so happy and alive.
“She could live here as well” Daphne offered and glanced at Draco. Harry rolled his eyes. Before he could say something, he caught a familiar looking owl that flew around them and then suddenly stopped next to them.
In the afternoon, they split up. Draco and Pansy walked to the library and Theodore and Harry were doing… something. Most likely visiting a certain person to maybe do something not entirely legal. Who could tell?
good now. They’re just tired of dealing with me, I guess. And I hadn’t had any symptoms for three days. That doesn’t mean that I’m doing okay. I know there’s something inside me that’s changing me somehow.
With a flick of his hand, the blood disappeared and Harry leaned back in his chair, breathing heavily, though he could feel how closed his lungs were. He nodded and took out the box with his assistance dog.
“Merlin’s beard, I’m in love with an idiot.”
Dwarfbart shook his head. “No. And the glass keeps them inside; they won’t be able to do any harm like that.”
“That was quite frankly everything I had to say against living here with you” Draco laughed and grinned. “Why not? I would be honored.”
Harry pointed his wand at her, before she could even say another word and clearly said: “Innominatam!” Narcissa’s eyes widened with panic and within a few seconds, a whirlwind grew around her. It got stronger and stronger, destroying the house around her and Harry nodded, smirking darkly.
So, after another half an hour, Draco looked around the handful of people inside the bar. An older gentleman who did in fact look as if he had escaped one of the magical paintings was sitting on the table closest to the bar. He was in a deep conversation with a woman who had seen all there was to the weather and survived it. Her hair looked wild, as if she was still out in the sea and her hands were rough even in the soft glint of the electric bulb Potter had installed.
Eric smirked. “She’s a Krimnee.” He placed a bowl of what seemed like small chunks of meat on the floor and the owl-cat meowed and jumped towards the food. “They’re very rare and we saved one of the last living creatures with her. Krimnees have the body of a cat and the wings and head of an owl.” He pointed at the features he explained and finally sat down between Harry and Alamar.
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Most of them don’t exist anymore. So she might know more, now!” He then turned back to his friend, hoping she would answer his question from earlier.
Yawning, Harry stood in front of the fire place, waiting for Blaise. When he finally emerged from their room, he was fidgeting with his clothes. Usually, he wore ripped jeans and a t-shirt with a few words, but right now he was actually looking rather nice. His light blue shirt was a nice difference to the dark grey, almost black trousers he wore. Well, Harry liked the other style of clothing much more, but he still liked that Blaise showed he really wanted to try this. “Are you sure they’ll be okay with me there?”
Shrugging, Harry grinned back at him. “Since you can’t catch me, I don’t see how you can teach me a lesson.”
Draco stared at Harry, unable to believe that he had heard what Harry had said. His former schoolyard bullying victim wanted him to travel back trough time, adopt him and raise him. Because he wanted to. He felt that way.
“Harry! Help!”
“Thank you very much, Mr. Brown! I also wanted to talk with you in a serious manner. Would you like to come in?” Mrs Williams asked and Draco basically had no other choice than to follow her into her home. He did feel a little as if his mother had just called him to 'take a seat'. Somehow all older ladies seemed to have this kind of air around them.
As luck would have it, when Draco returned from the library, feeling slightly victorious for having understood a small paragraph in a Transfiguration book, he almost walked into Harry leaving Severus’ office. Draco stopped and smiled at his boyfriend.
Pansy laughed, linked her arm with Draco’s and they quietly walked down to the dungeon silently. When they passed Severus’ office, the door was open and Severus sat on the table, facing the door.
“This is Padfoot, my service dog.”
He realized that he had changed the name, but he had just thought about it being weird that baby Potter would maybe start reaction to Potter more than to Harry. So as much as he didn’t want to use his first name, he wanted Potter to be healthy and happy when he grew up.
, Draco thought a little amused.
“Neither did I” Harry admitted and smiled softly. “My soul mate told me and got me in contact with a Muggle association that helped me pick out the correct dog for my psychological problems, which turned out to be PTSD.”
Harry stared at Draco, disgusted. “Ew, no. Why on earth would I do that?”
“Six years” Harry blushed and chuckled, when Ron let go of the glass and it landed in the water again, making the floor wet as well.
Hermione, whose baby bump was only slightly bigger than Draco’s, found little Willow pretty quickly and she crossed the room to sit down as close to Harry as possible. “She’s so cute! I’ve seen her so many times, but I can’t get enough of her!”
Without missing a beat, Kingsley nodded. “The spell used is one the Ministry currently thinks about blacklisting... And after what we’ve seen, it definitely has the potential of being very harmful. Anyway, we’re done here.” He motioned them to leave the room, though turned to Draco and the professors. “A word, Mr. Malfoy? You may stay as well, Minerva and Severus.”
Harry grinned and let his hand run down over his husband’s arm until he grabbed his hand. “You’re very welcome.” He winked and added in a whisper: “Potter.”
Harry sat up and crossed his legs, pushing his face in his hands. He was just seconds away of another panic attack. He needed Draco.
“You don’t care about what, Harry?”
“Well, stop trying; you’re already doing a good job!”
“What Draco thinks” Harry quickly explained and smirked. “I couldn’t care less, honestly. Well, unless he wants Padfoot.” He looked over his shoulders, where his dog was playing with his favorite teddy bear again. Though as he heard his name, he stopped and looked up, Harry grinned at the dog.
“Sirius, if it helps you, I’ll keep my brother in check” Olivia offered and pleaded with her eyes.
Harry placed the parchment back onto the floor and walked out of the room, leaving Malfoy to think. It was still quiet upstairs, but maybe they had found something like that as well and were reading over the letters. Harry stopped at the door frame to the living room. He saw the picture at the wall and once again, two people were waving at him.
and with how far apart you two are, it’s literally impossible, even with magic” Draco explained.
Draco pushed a rather stubborn strain of hair out of Harry’s face and looked back into his eyes. They were so soft, so full of love and hope and just everything Draco had ever wanted to see in his boyfriend’s eyes. Leaning in once more, Draco kissed him softly, breaking it too soon.
, which we have established by now... I could get into some serious trouble.”
While the Auror left and bid goodbye to Maria, Harry just wanted to write Draco a message, when he received one from Ron.
“I’ll tell you what, love” Draco placed his arms around Harry’s neck and saw him licking his lips. “I will show you how to do my ancestral pasta sauce if you do two things for me.”
“I would have loved to see how you handle being the next Headmaster of Hogwarts, though I sadly won’t be here to witness such definite greatness” Flitwick said and Harry frowned.
“Harry Potter” Draco corrected and grinned when Potter beamed at him.
Harry in the meantime grinned at him. “Sure, but not everyone’s under a curse that frankly does whatever it wants.”
“What were you thinking, Harry?” Draco asked and chuckled.
Harry rolled his eyes and chuckled. “Got it. Since I’m back close to London, anything I can get you from there?” He took away Draco’s arm and grinned.
Theodore shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t really like to go out. I studied for the upcoming N.E.W.T.s. I’m trying to get as many Outstandings as possible. Right now, DADA is a little problematic for me.”
“I love you, Draco.”
And well, that only left Zabini reading a book on the table by the window. That was a no-go. He would never ask this man, not in a million years. Especially since he already thought that Neville was a bad idea. How much of a bad idea was it to ask Zabini? He probably didn’t even know anything about Malfoy.
Shit. Kingsley was here!
Ron smirked. “For a night?”
The boy nodded and high fived Potter. “Thank you again! Now I just need to find someone who can help me with math.”
Madam Pomfrey was back and handed Longbottom a vial with some yellow glowing substance, which he downed without even questioning it. He had definitely spent enough time in the Hospital Wing that he wasn’t even going to ask something anymore. She quickly dried his clothes and nodded.
He stepped inside and found the elves setting the table. He kept his eyes on the table, not looking at anything that could give him another few months of nightmares. His mother was already sitting at the small table and smiled at him. “Now, what was it you wanted to ask me? That couldn’t be trusted by the owl post?”
How could he ever forgive him for all he had done? He had made fun of his parent’s deaths. He had laughed over how easy his life must have been... Oh how stupid he had been! How utterly stupid. Especially with what he had learned a few weeks ago...
Padfoot barked what was probably a thank you, grabbed the toy and headed back to Harry. Draco looked up and found Harry’s quick smirk, which he replied with a satisfied sneer as if to tell him that Padfoot knew best to choose him over Harry. That almost made Harry chuckle, though he managed to roll his eyes in mock annoyance and ruffled Padfoot’s fur once he was back by his feet.
While Harry grabbed the plate (Theodore handing him the nutrition potion), Draco made a mental note to go to the Hospital Wing as soon as he had time. He had a lesson this afternoon, but after he was free and he was definitely going to look at the Injury Parchment. It didn’t feel good.
Just then, it vibrated and when Harry turned it over, there was finally a text from someone. Though it was from Kevin.
“Of being the chosen one.” Harry smirked, while Jason rolled his eyes and laughed.
“I’ve had about four cups of coffee already.” Harry grinned and moved, so there was more space between him and Padma. “Sit down, my dear, and drink your coffee. It’ll help.” He added some sugar and milk and placed it next to his.
Ginny’s saying had messed with his head. Nobody who had fought the war had won. The good side had lost a lot of good people: One of the explosions had also almost killed one of the twins and had left him in a coma for half a year. The bad side... his side. They had lost so much, though most of all: honour. As if they’d had any to begin with. Draco snorted and shook his head.
Hannah grinned and looked up at him again. “In all honesty, though, Harry” she smiled softly. “What have you been doing? I have tried to find some news about you a few days ago and I could not even find one single publication in the last two years.”
Sorry for all these letters, but I wanted them to be in this story. I also realize that I have a very light Dumbledore bashing going on. That wasn’t on purpose and I will keep it out of this story from now on.  (Dumbledore had his reasons to do what he did, I believe)
“Despite the fact that I always seemed to know who matched best with what person, I never seemed to be able to figure out who would be my partner. But with you by my side I finally know.”
Checking the clock, he realized that it was long past midnight. It was half past three. Yawning, Draco changed into his pajamas and decided to check in on his ward again, before heading to bed and getting two hours and maybe half an hour more sleep. Depending on how fast he would be asleep and how early either Pansy or Harry were going to wake him up.
“I am?” she asked and shook her head as if she had water in her ears. Then, as if everything was clear all of a sudden, she looked at him and nodded. “Right! Yes, one of the interns made one of the rare magical items explode. It was hilarious and incredibly stupid at the same time.”
Eric nodded, extremely relieved. Harry was going to be fine!
Harry snorted and walked over to make some tea. “I wasn’t being funny.” He put water onto the stove and started boiling it. “I forgot when Neville’s coming with you. Is that next week?”
And so, after picking up Potter and stepping into the fire place, they floo’d over to Remus’ place. Stepping out of the floo, Draco stepped on a small car-like object and started slipping. He lost his balance and saw the world turning on its side. Already about to cast a protective spell over his ward, he felt sudden helpful hands, pushing him upright.
Yawning slightly, Harry checked his watch. The Hogwarts club meeting ended at three p.m. giving Draco an hour to execute whatever he had come up with in these three hours, since it all started. Harry walked to the bathroom to clean himself up a little and to fix his shirt which had bothered him pretty much as soon as he had spent an hour in it. As he checked himself in the mirror, letting Padfoot look around the official bathroom for boys, the door opened and Draco walked in.
Seamus sighed and seemed to try his luck with this game. “You did not in fact fall in love with someone during Hogwarts.”
Before Harry could ask another question, Fred looked at the boy closer and widened his eyes. “You’re a Slytherin, Harry! When did that happen?!”
Harry smirked at his friend. “’Mione, it doesn’t. I am here, after all, right? This isn’t work.”
A faint meow brought Draco back to reality and Harry walked over to the terrace entrance, opening to door. “Good morning to you too, Merlin.”
“You are such a good boy, Harry!” Pansy beamed at him, which made Potter squeal and he laughed happily. Seeing this made Draco smile over how innocent baby Potter was, even though there were some really heavy things in his past.
Nodding, Draco confirmed that he had at least kept his first name. “I am, but I don’t have any last name anymore.”
Magic rushed through the air and suddenly, the green glue stopped and they seemed to be back to their normal self. Pansy chuckled, along with Theodore.
The other two Gryffindors were Hermione and Weasley. Both remained standing, Hermione glancing over to her boyfriend as if she was expecting him to do something, Neville doing the same. Draco frowned, wondering what was going on, when the man cleared his throat.
her being punished for what she did to Draco?
, I have a question about the essay…”
Once again, Neville shrugged, though now he was grinning broadly. “I have absolutely no idea!”
I’m in the Common Room. No one’s here, come.
He pulled Draco even closer, making sure not to hurt Padfoot who also seemed to press his body to draco, and held him safely, kissing his hair and rocking from side to side. “I’ve got you, darling. You’re here with me, safe and sound” he whispered. “And loved. So, so loved, my darling. So loved. You are my everything.”
“Yes!”
The mediwitch looked at the parchment, eyebrows raised and sighed, before handing it to Draco.
Sighing, Draco had to agree. Partially, because he wanted to find out how his ward would scare his best friend. “If you make your bed right now, you may scare her.”
“I don’t need the details, Ron” Harry smirked and they finally met up with the Slytherins again. They stood by the door and Harry almost walked into them. However, they looked a little confused and turned back to him.
Harry shrugged his shoulders and stepped back from Draco’s Patronus. “I have. But I never knew other people could also have Patronusses I can pet. I always figured you can only touch your own.”
“Did you already have your Mind Healing session?” Draco asked curious.
Harry hummed, grabbed Draco’s hand and followed Padfoot up the stairs. “I want you to sleep in my bed” he confessed and sighed heavily.
Draco placed himself behind the bar, smirking at the evil glare from Ian. For the rest of the day, they were all rather hard working. Before dinner, Olivia joined James in taking orders and Aaron wanted to help out Draco, but he sent him into the kitchen to help Potter instead.
“No?” Evelyn smiled at him, as if she knew he was lying. “Well, in that case, I won’t tell you about their friendship.”
And normal days started exactly like that: Kevin was already sitting in the office, looking through the mail and Maria, their office helper, sitting at the desk by the door working on a computer.
Sighing, Draco decided to interrupt his best friend, since she seemed to start explaining the whole history if the spell, which Harry really didn’t need to know to understand what happened. “With the spell, you take a person’s life as an example and perform this spell on any number of people you want. The spell gives the chosen victims everything that happened to the example. Sometimes you can take things away, but normally you just give them everything.”
Now the only person, who hadn’t said anything, was Blaise. The other wizard turned to him and raised his eyebrows questioning. “Well” Blaise started and blushed slightly. “I was trying to get the nerves up and asking a girl out. But I... I messed up and... I was really frustrated with what I said and I accidentally punched a wall...”
“Oh yeah, Toby’s the boss in our pizzeria. We usually call each other around twice a month or just whenever there’s a problem.” Harry smirked. “Or when he wants you guys to think that I’m having an affair behind my husband’s back. Come one, guys, why would I ever? I love Draco!”
Utterly surprised, Potter turned back to the picture and a huge smile was on his face. He then turned the page himself, while Draco watched carefully, so he wouldn’t accidentally destroy something. The next page was full of Potter himself. He was sleeping in his mother’s arms, in his father’s arm and a lot of different people.
Minerva nodded, though she looked a little tense. He couldn’t trust her, then. “So then, what do we do about his?”
“Nobody loves you? We all love you, bear!” Draco ruffled through his hair and smiled at his ward. He placed his arms around him and pulled him closer. “You are a wonderful person and amazingly smart and I know you won chess against Mil last night!”
Chuckling a little, Harry held up his hands. “Okay, you got me. It’s mine.”
“Well, I am Harry Potter, so I didn’t have to pra…” he couldn’t continue, as Draco smacked a rolled up parchment over his head and he snorted. Holding up his hands, he looked over to Draco who had a hard time trying to hide his grin. “Fine. I had to practice, but not as much as others had. The Patronus was never a huge problem for me.”
Harry chuckled and he bent his knees, putting his arms around them. “Thank you! So, I’m not the only person. Dumbledore wanted me to understand him.”
“We’re leaving, darlings.”
As he nodded softly and walked to the landing on the first floor, he stopped, hearing Eric and Harry talk quietly. Yes, eavesdropping wasn’t appropriate, but he was interested in what was going on with the two people he wanted to protect from all harm.
be part of the N.E.W.T.s, just a little warning.”
Let me instead tell you something about Harry. He’s an incredibly happy child. His favorite toy is the teddy bear Severus gave him when he was only about five months old. He laughs all day long and isn’t mad at anybody that long. Once, James forgot to change his diaper for almost half a day and even though Harry wasn’t feeling all that comfortable, he didn’t take it personally (not like his mother did. I know you’re reading over this James, and since I remembered it again, you’re now going to sleep in the couch again). Sorry about that.
What. A. Lie.
His former professor chuckled. “Animal instincts, Harry. Animals feel less strange around Animagi, one of the perks, I suppose.”
“What?” It came out as almost a bark. Before long, Draco was on all four and his yellow hair spread over his body. He grew a tail and his face transformed until you couldn’t tell the difference. Well, Harry could. But not anybody else who had just seen the dog Harry had come in with.
It was his happiest memory: the world had been okay at this point. His parents were still rather... strict, but they were nice and loving. He had gotten the smoothest, fluffiest jumper he had ever had. And he had treasured it as long as he could.
Pansy looked at Draco and chuckled. “I don’t know why, but I’m really happy you guys are here. It’s so much fun with you two and I think Neville works with us as well.”
Chuckling, Draco shook his head. He waited a few more minutes, before he got up, quietly looked into Harry’s room and found him in deep slumber again. He then took his favorite green jumper, his trousers and walked to Severus. That was something he needed to discuss with another person, and Severus was definitely the best choice there was. Surprisingly, Severus was awake, working on a potion with an open door.
But, then again… Harry had always been rather skillful. Draco suddenly frowned, wanting to tell his ward something, when Pansy burst out laughing. Widening his eyes, Draco touched his hair, looking at the ends and finding it in different shades of blue and purple.
Before he (or Pansy) could say anything, Draco sighed. “Pansy, what did you do? Why have you bought a tricycle for Potter? You know that he won’t be this age for much longer? You are starting to get a little… and I mean this the nicest way possible – a little impulsive.”
Mirjam smirked and leaned back, crossing her legs. “So, if guess we won’t be needing all these questions, then?” She looked at the parchment and frowned at it.
“I doubt it.”
“I might need a minute…” Harry stopped in the middle of the sentence, actually deciding to take a minute of silence.
Before Draco could say something, Sophie stood in front of them, holding an empty vial towards Harry. Both adults jerked up. That was where the potion had been!
“Sounds scary.” Draco frowned and felt the arms around him tighten as if to show that he was safe now.
Harry Potter. His heart sped up, though he was only able to concentrate on how soft his lips were and how perfect they moved to his rhythm. His whole body tingled as he tried to separate, when Harry caught the upper hand, intensifying the kiss. Draco pressed his hand against Harry’s chest, holding onto the fabrics for dear life, until he thought he was about to pass out and they separated, panting.
Harry groaned and hid his face behind his hands, while Draco laughed loudly. That was definitely not one of his finer moments. Luckily, they had been fast at ignoring things (and repairing the relationship as friends).
The house elves were hard at work when Draco entered the kitchen. However, none seemed to care that he had entered their territory. They were used to him, since he sometimes sat there, at the very back, when he wasn’t in the mood to deal with the world. And well, since it was in the middle of breakfast, they had a lot to do and generally no time to try and talk to him. That was exactly what he was looking for.
“These are your character quirks. And yes, your unpunctuality makes planning a little difficult, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. Besides” he beamed at Harry in a full on love-struck expression. Harry couldn’t help but smile back and he placed his free hand on Draco’s. “You being late for our wedding is my favorite thing to annoy you with. I know you would have never left me at the altar by myself, but that rush of emotions I was feeling when you ran through the door, not even properly dressed…”
Draco burst out laughing, almost certainly imagining this discussion while Harry grew even more red. He had been too drunk to care when he had asked her that question and regretted it only the next morning. It was terrible!
Harry stared at the Slytherin who smiled softly. His brain was trying to convince him, that this whole conversation was just happening in his head, that he was still lying on the floor, looking at the stars. He was surely half asleep and dreaming about the best possibility, right? This couldn’t have been… real?
As Harry was slowly calming down, Pansy sat down next to Draco, so that Harry could see her easily. She placed a hand on the boy’s knee and smiled warmly. “Darling, you are no freak!” she said softly. Harry turned his head slightly, tear stricken eyes looked at hers, while Draco was still rubbing his back. “You are a very handsome, little prince, darling! And princes don’t have to cook for others. And we all love you very much and it doesn’t matter that… that the eggs aren’t good or that you have a few problems. We all have them. It’s normal, dear.”
“Whatever.” Harry smirked. “I’ll just go and ask Severus for a vial of poison that kills people slowly and painfully. Nothing wrong with that, is there?”
“Harry!” Ginny called out and threw her arms around his neck. “I almost thought you were trying to hide again!”
“Anyhow” James then turned back to the topic at hand. “We were wondering if you’d want us to help you out, serving people you know.”
Apparently, the will reading was over and everyone left the room, Severus and McGonagall heading to Gringott’s with their respective letters of what was left to them. Remus stopped outside of the room, waiting for Draco who gathered all of Potter’s stuff from wherever he had placed them.
Before he could even think what the Slytherin could do with it, he stuffed it down Harry’s collar.
Zemblanity – noun. The inevitable discovery of what we would rather not know; the opposite of serendipity.
“I thought you might” Harry chuckled. “For the mean time, though, we need to come up with a few smaller things.”
“Hermione gave me a love potion.”
It only took about three hours. Three hours of Eric being creepy and standing in the dark room by the window watching the neighbours. Yes, nobody could compete with a patient fairy and a protective vampire. Since, while Eric pretended to be a stalker, Alamar sat on the floor surrounded by their tools and cast thousands upon thousands of spells on their weapons, increased the protectiveness of the vampire blood and inspected everything again. If it worked properly now, Dumbledore would sleep deeply and happily and nothing would tell him that something went wrong in the Dursley household.
“And quite a powerful wizard! I have a spell on this camera that allows only me to do spells with it. Yet, you broke through that!” Pansy shook her head as she sat down on the sofa, defeated.
Please let me know, I would like to come by as long as Harry’s memories are still fresh. While you would be talking, I’m very happy to play babysitter and look after Teddy, the picture you’ve sent me is adorable and I had to keep it away from Pansy, because I am sure she would have floo’d right over and tried to abduct him.
Harry knocked at the door to the Burrow, after having straightened his clothes from the long-distance Portkey travel. He had always hated it, but that was the only way of getting back to UK in a rather decent amount of time.
?!” he snarled. “How dare he come here with someone who hasn’t been at Hogwarts!? Is that even a wizard?!”
Half of all the babies this age can already distinguish between daddy and mommy and call them accordingly, though not with whatever name they call themselves (mostly dada and mama). They can also point at distant objects out of reach and even indicate what they would like to have through rough movements. Importantly, they also learn the meaning of ‘No’ in this age. Do be careful with this word, though, and use it only when absolutely necessary.
Before Draco could say anything, Harry stepped between him and the twins and glared at them. “No!” he yelled and shook his head. It reminded Draco a lot of when Weasley had tried to get small Harry out of his arms on their first play date.
They walked off and Draco groaned as he closed the door of his shop. “Fuck.” What now? What could he possibly do that would change the outcome?! It seemed as if he had to go and marry woman. Taking his phone, he quickly dialed Harry’s number and waited for a few seconds while it rang. Finally, the Gryffindor answered. There seemed to be quite a lot of background noise when he picked up.
“No, Pansy! They cannot just get away with that! They have done so many hurtful things to him! This is the last thing that’ll happen!” Draco snapped once again, effectively getting rid of his best friend and grabbing a jacket.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, bear. He was very respectful. Don’t worry about that.”
“Or to find a way to run away or take a break from our responsibilities in eleven years.”
“Pansy” Draco chuckled and sat down on the seat next to hers, pulling her into a hug. He smiled at her as he pushed some strains of hair out of her face. “You are already in too deep! Do you want me to go and talk to him? Harry has to go to his therapy session in fifteen minutes; I could go and try to find your potential boyfriend...”
Chuckling softly, Draco rolled his eyes, while Potter smirked and answered the unasked question. “Yes, Olivia might have told everyone. And people had their wildest theories about why you were hiding.”
Someone sat down next to him and Draco sighed, looking up. He really hoped it was Harry, though he did recognize his friend out of the corner of his eyes. “Hey Theo, anything I can do to help you?”
Harry stared at his parchment, grimly. Without looking up or any action actually, he stated: “I might have as well.” He then turned to face his guardian. “Good night, Draco.”
“’Mione, what are you even trying to prove anymore? That you’re the smartest witch around Hogwarts? We know that already” Ron started his rant and while he followed his girlfriend trough the almost hip high snow, Harry turned back to Malfoy.
Still... one could only hope.
Sighing, Draco sat up and made Harry move slightly, so they didn’t collide. Sitting up on his knees as well, Harry tilted his head slightly and frowned. What was going on? Draco seemed really annoyed and… somehow scared.
Yawning slightly, he flinched by another thunder and grumbled, having been unable to finish his yawn. He pushed the blanket away and sighed. It was time to go to bed. Midnight was long over, but for some reason he just hadn’t wanted to go to bed. Getting up, he stretched and walked over to the crib, where Potter was sound asleep.
happens” Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled a second later. “Thank you, Remus. If Pansy or Theodore have a question about DADA, could I tell them to write you? I think it would help them prepare.”
“What?” Harry widened his eyes. That wasn’t really played, he hoped that the library would somehow not give away that Draco was in there. It shouldn’t since nobody ever even figured out that there was a Black family library. Not even Dumbledore, who made this house a safe house and not Sirius, who had lived here. Though maybe Sirius didn’t realize, because he ran away to live with the Potter’s.
“Any way I can help you?” Harry asked and closed the door behind Severus, taking a few purchases away from him.
“I would be very happy if you could take care of him. It’s not that long, I promise.”
unknown (will show up at 17)
Another knock on the door made Harry quickly open it. There stood Severus. “Good afternoon, Professor Snape. What brings you around here?” Harry joked. “I'm pretty sure Lily isn't supposed to go to Hogwarts for I believe eight years and Caellum is by far roo young to even understand the word 'Hogwarts'.”
“Assad means lion in Arabic” Malfoy explained and looked at Harry with wide eyes. “William was Rose.”
“I can’t just leave it alone. I feel like I need to clean it and maybe… live here.” Harry looked out of the front door over the lake and smiled. “It’s also much nicer here than in the middle of London.”
Over the summer, he had never shown any skin, his light long sleeved white shirts had helped him almost forget that there was some black ink spread over his forearm. It was neither pretty nor helpful to have it there.
“I would like to have something to eat as well; it was a long drive up here.”
“If you can’t do it, Draco, you are free to leave, you know that, right? I won’t just put you back inside, just because I couldn’t get healthy.”
that there might have been a very old and brutal spell involved.”
“I thought I was his second favorite person.”
Could you maybe help me in finding out what it means? I’m really confused by it and I can’t seem to figure out why I don’t have a swallow anymore. Not that I’m complaining much, since I am rather proud of this animal, but still. I’m utterly confused.
Draco woke up a little earlier than usual. He looked at the ceiling and heard the shower running. Yawning, he stretched in bed and sat up. It was exactly when the shower stopped and while Draco rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he heard someone singing.
Hermione chuckled. “Tell us what’s going on! Ron and I don’t know anything about you! That’s not how it used to be!”
Raising his head, Draco smirked at the Gryffindor and shrugged his shoulders. “People say all kinds of things to the ‘mysterious stranger’, but Mrs Williams had been talking to me yesterday.”
Smiling about how nonchalant Potter had started to eat again – even though he wasn’t happy that it was
Hermione seemed to be on the same train as Ron was. “You trained to become a professional surfer in Australia for three years prior to that...”
“Shut up and get to it!”
“It’s Luna, Ron. I’m sure she manages to get in wherever she wants. She knows all kinds of secret passages” Hermione explained, giving him a pointed look, since he hadn’t gotten back to reading the book.
After Harry had gone back to bed to get some rest from the stupid food test, Draco went in search of the Black family library. Every pureblood family had one, mostly incredibly well hidden usually and with a lot of family heirlooms. Since he had already checked all of the public rooms, he decided to make a battle plan. He found some loose paper and started writing all the info he could think of on where the room could be.
Pansy’s frown deepened. “How long exactly?”
Harry stopped and turned back to the last picture. No, he hadn’t imagined it, there actually were two old ladies arguing with each other. One had a cane and continuously tried to hit the other grandmother with it, while the other grey haired woman used her black umbrella as a shield and attack weapon. It was almost like watching a movie.
In there, he grabbed the first book on Hermione’s to-read book stack that was like old days stacked next to the entrance and sat down by the fire place. It was a murder mystery on a secluded island in Scotland, where a serial killer had apparently wanted all the inhabitants dead and it was a ticking time bomb to find out who of the surviving islander would figure it out. Harry was so engrossed in this book that he didn’t even realize how fast time was flying by.
In the warmth of the Weasley home, Draco felt happy again – for the first time in a long, long duration. The only thing that usually could give him this happiness was Harry, when he ran around, played with them and just was his happy self.
Aaron chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. He then turned back to Draco, eyes sparkling. “You must excuse my friend, she hasn’t learnt proper manners yet and...” He couldn’t finish his sentence, as Olivia attacked him with her scarf, which Aaron caught rather quickly.
“I don’t think you’re the same you were as a child, Malfoy” Harry shook his head. “We both went through some hard times and we tried everything to stay alive.”
“Yes, I know.” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’d rather have me marry a pureblood witch, so I can have a few little Malfoy heirs and our name would continue. But I think we should stop this line of fuck ups. I choose not to follow your order and live my life like I want it. And my choice is Harry Potter. So you can either deal with that it get the hell out of my life. I don’t need someone who doesn’t accept me the way I am.”
“It was
“Well” Millicent got their attention again. “Blaise would buy a plane ticket to Brazil, Theodore would use it for whatever Muggle technology you said you’d do, Pansy and Draco would buy a flat in London and I would get a farm with some horses… Come on, which of these doesn’t sound so exciting?” She looked at Draco and Pansy rather accusatory.
The other Gryffindor groaned, clearly not happy that Ron either didn’t read everything or just wasn’t getting it. “They wanted to make the people stop the testing, Ron. Read the second part again,
“Maybe a little” Draco answered much faster than before.
Draco nodded and pulled out a few coins as well. Pauline already knew what he wanted. In the last two years, he had only changed his order a handful of times. “I think that’s how everyone here found it.”
The Slytherin swallowed the food and narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”
“Dada dad” Potter said and he was suddenly looking like a dog begging for food. Draco looked at him quietly for a while, before he smiled softly.
With that, he dragged himself to the next door, his lovely assistance dog behind him, and he entered his bedroom. For once, he was feeling like what he had done today was a good thing. If Draco couldn’t figure it out… nobody else could.
“Our future, to be frank” Draco said softly, before he looked at Harry and smiled. “And I’m ready to… step back from my argument.”
Harry likes apples the most, but I’ve tried something like carrot puree and he just likes to draw with it, not really eat it. Potato puree does the trick and maybe you’ll figure out how to make him eat more vegetable, I hadn’t had any success until now.
With all of this, Draco’s heart started speeding up and he kissed Harry’s forehead. “I love you, Harry.” He widened his eyes, staring at his boyfriend. Had he just said…?
“Well then, let’s get this started” Severus said and chuckled as they entered the store. “Bridger, guess who’s here?”
. Next to that were all the symptoms and other things written down.
“And you said ‘fuck no’, because you already knew you wanted a divorce!” He looked as if he had just now realized that this had ‘happened’ because of that reason.
Draco shook his head; it hurt him seeing his ward like that. And Harry was making himself responsible for his godfather’s death? “Harry, that’s not true! He would have…”
Sighing, Harry lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. “Did you not see how I… enjoyed harming Narcissa? I looked like a maniac!”
“Except having sex while apparating.”
Chuckling, Alamar shook his head. “Breakfast, Harry. We’re eating first, I thought you would remember that simple rule in our home!”
“That is quite alright, Harry. Not many students have started calling me Minerva. If it’s easier for you, you do have my permission to call me ‘Minnie’.” She smiled for a second as a shadow of sadness crept into her eyes. It was gone before Harry could even fully realize what just happened. “Your father used to call me that.”
Sighing, Draco closed the door quietly, after checking his magical ward. Sometimes magic was weird. Well, he was not going to think about something that depressing right now. He already was awake, thinking these depressing thoughts was just going to keep him up longer.
Potter’s head appeared next to Pansy’s shoulder and Draco caught his breath, incredibly surprised by what he saw when the toddler grinned at him. Pansy looked at him and sighed, getting up with the baby boy on her arm.
Draco was just about to say something back – even though he didn’t have a wicked reply – when another voice interrupted their discussion.
Draco nodded and presented him with a smile. “Absolutely. Don’t worry about it.”
“I don’t know, Pans. Some of the things sound too much like the household where Harry grew up. I don’t want him to fall into something like that…” Draco scratched his forehead and sighed.
James sat up straighter and smiled at Draco’s childhood nemesis. “Okay, so don’t be mad, yeah?” Potter stopped what he was doing and raised an eyebrow, probably silently questioning why he should (or shouldn’t) be mad. The boy then continued, after Potter motioned him to. “Connor told us about the critic that’s coming sometime during the next few weeks.”
He licked his lips, looking back up at Harry who had the most amazing soft eyes he had ever seen. The small smile on his lips as he carefully brushed a loose strain from Draco’s face was everything he needed to go back for another kiss.
“Oh yes, they have a huge employee turn-over rate. I believe after eight months I was the one who had been here the longest. So, since I knew how most things worked, I got to be the boss here” Neville explained and grinned. “It’s boring though. I’m looking for something new as well. I’m just staying because I know everyone else is completely unusable.”
Weasley snorted. “Harry and a boyfriend in Canada? Nah. He said something about having found true love in Scotland, though I highly doubt that. He went back there, probably hoping he can repair whatever mess he had caused.”
Harry was already getting up and he nodded. “I’d rather sleep in your arms tonight than having to go back to the Dormitory.”
Before he could fall into a somewhat deep depression, the couch seemed to get heavier and he turned his head, to face Harry.
“I know it’s Connor, Harry. I just want you to stay in bed. With me.”
Harry rolled his eyes, smirking. He placed the food under a quick charm and walked over. “Well, I don’t want to be watched all day long, Dray.” He grinned, pressing a kiss in Draco’s lips.
Harry shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly and smirked. “I just told it that today I wouldn’t be telling it what to do. If the Hat thinks Gryffindor or Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff was better, okay. If it thinks I should be Slytherin... That’s fine as well.”
“Beautiful day, Pans, isn’t it?” he asked.
“What are you doing, Dray?” a small voice asked. Even though it was so soft, it still startled Draco and he jumped, hiding the TV in the corner again.
Sighing, Harry cast a spell on the parchment and smirked. “I finished the story, if you’re interested on reading the end. You are free to change whatever you don’t like, since it
In all honesty, Harry was just sitting with there with the phone on the table, waiting until Ginny or any of his friends had read this article, since there was surely a reaction happening. And well, Kevin had told him to stay home today, since he had everything under control.
While he sat down, he suddenly remembered how he had been early far too much at Pansy’s and the door had suddenly opened to reveal a basically walking snowman. It had been Potter who for some weird reason thought it would be a good idea to walk there.
Remus John Lupin
“I do not change my mind so quickly!” Alamar protested and shook his head.
He jerked up, for a second thinking it was Harry, when he saw Pansy standing in his doorway. “He’s gone, isn’t he?”
Charlie held open a red curtain and looked at Draco. “You can call for Dross. He’s my oldest House Elf and knows where to find us.” She nodded at Pansy and they left, while Draco stayed back watching his ward intently.
There were so few houses all in different colours around that it wasn’t hard to figure out which of the softly illuminated living rooms was supposed to be the right one. In the windows, you could see people watching games, series or movies. One couple was playing with their dog, another enjoyed some wine while others danced around the living room. They were not the targets.
Draco burst out laughing and shook his head. “And you’re wondering why people think you’re a snob?”
“So, what happens now?” Millicent asked thoughtfully.
“He really wants to talk to you, but I can tell him to wait.”
experience. I have some in the department of…”
“I quit my job.”
Draco frowned as well. That sounded weirdly familiar. After a few seconds, Harry started laughing and his hid his face under the blanket.
Luna smiled. “I would get a thousand roses, a hundred candles, maybe a puppy” her eyes were glowing. Harry sighed. Luna wasn’t the right person to ask, he had quickly realized. Nevertheless, she continued and Harry listened, hoping she would say something that would help him. “And I would dance and sing and we would have fun and in the middle, I would ask them to go out with me.”
I’m not going back. I know I shouldn’t be alone for there could be something happening any second, but I don’t trust the mediwitches anymore. Also, I’m probably not going to be alone any longer. Today, I’m freeing Draco. I’ve got everything under control. I took my pain medication, Nora is with me (at least at the beginning), it should be fine. I hope.
Suddenly, the door opened and Potter jumped, losing the teddy bear in the process and hiding his face in Draco’s chest. He placed his arms around his ward, hoping it would help feel safer. Looking at the door, Draco found a much healthier looking former professor of his.
Luckily, about five minutes later, Blaise returned with a potion vial from Severus and Harry took it without any problems. It seemed to take effect immediately, as Harry coughed once more, before leaning back and rubbing his head.
Dear Mr. Malfoy
“They’ll know something’s up, love. You are somewhat thick when it comes to love, but I know you see all the flirts coming your way.”
Harry frowned and was just about to shake his head, when he widened his eyes. “Ravo... Yes! My penguin! Our story.”
Pansy Pandora Longbottom
“Ew!” Dominique called out and pressed her hands on her eyes.
Draco shook his head. He looked dead-tired. Today had been a long day. “I’m going to the Common Room. Maybe Blaise, Pansy, Daphne or Neville are there to talk with me for a little bit.” He smiled and kissed the corner of his lips. “I’ll see you in a bit.”
“I…” Harry stared at him with wide eyes. He had not expected that. “So… I am the oblivious one, then?” He glanced at the Slytherin’s lips, curling into a soft smile.
Almost as soon as he had gotten out of Azkaban, Draco had come by to apologize for what he had done in all of his childhood years. If Harry closed his eyes, he could see the situation in front of his eyes, as if it had happened yesterday.
Draco sighed. “Well, I can’t spend more time with him since McGonagall told me I had to go back to classes once he’s eleven and Harry has to spend his time with me in my classes or with Hermione in DADA.”
Nodding, Harry fell back into the chair and shrugged. Luna took the plates and cast a spell that started cleaning everything. From the hallway, Harry heard a sudden familiar deep voice talking next to Ginny’s.
fine.”
The group was talking about being out after midnight, which somehow felt like they were doing something wrong, when they stopped before the tapestry. Harry could hear the voices of Ron, Blaise, Millicent, Gregory and Megan. Right now, it seemed as if they were discussing something important.
Draco shook his head, looked up and just picked a random piece of cake for the two of them.
Luckily, Draco hadn’t needed to look far. The booklet, which Pomfrey had given him, coincidentally (or maybe not) stated a few things, which Draco was reading out aloud for his friends to hear.
“Well” he started and when Potter looked up directly at him, he shrugged his shoulders, hiding the shudder that was surging through his body. “I also don’t have a boyfriend anymore.”
Harry leaned in, kissing his husband softly. “It’s just a year, my darling. One stupidly, tiny year. We’ve had ten years of relationship so far. I don’t plan on stopping. So, now we’ve got a year basically separated? Won’t keep me from thinking about you” he said and tucked a strain of hair out of his husband’s face. “Besides, just think about how amazing the sex is when you’ve had to restrain yourself for a few months.” He winked at Draco, who snorted and shook his head.
While he yawned, he shook his head. “I’m just saying that I couldn’t sleep during the night. That’s believable, right?”
“Well, children before the age of eleven are unable to use their magic in an orderly fashion. There are accidental magical phenomena happening, but nothing else. Only once they’ve passed their eleventh birthday, they can start to grasp the concept of magic and its power” McGonagall explained.
This whole day seemed so weird. While Malfoy worked on pictures, sometimes actually with Muggle technology, a little less with magic, Harry had enough time realizing that he was completely different from what he had thought he was. He actually even had a sense of humor. Harry really needed to remember to thank Kevin for making him do this.
Finally, Ron sighed, sat down exhausted and leaned against the house as well. “It’s hopeless.”
“What are you doing?” he asked with a tired voice, leaning into the touch.
How did she get all these information? He stood there for a little too long for it to be an easy discussion. Draco wasn’t sure what to do. Lovegood was clearly crazy. However, she seemed to care about Potter. And maybe she had a free lesson, when he needed to go to the Studies of Ancient Runes. Why would he trust her more than Potter’s actual friends?

“Hm? I would never threaten people!”
Harry held up his hands in mocking surrender. “Yes, sir!”
Chuckling, Draco nodded. “Yeah, I just found it. Should we finish this story?”
She handed Draco the parchment and he actually saw one point on the life event or injuries list:
in common then, don’t we.”
After a few seconds, where Draco frantically tried to get the image out of his head, Potter finally seemed to answer. “Actually, yes. I realised that it’s easier to communicate with people in their native language. And French is such a beautiful language too. I taught Olivia and James, and even Aaron came by for a few lessons.”
Harry chuckled and finally poured the boiling hot water over the herbal tea. He then grabbed three cups and placed them on the table. “Well, it is nice to have you here.”
Draco frowned. The next test was only in four days, however, maybe the mediwitch would be fine testing his ward now. After all, he then didn’t need to come back on Wednesday. However, they had also done the last test only a few days ago, so maybe for her it wouldn’t work out... “Well, we can ask Madam Pomfrey, but I don’t think it’s necessary right now.”
Looking in the sink, Harry frowned and turned over his shoulder, looking for the knives. “Damn it. Heinrich, where did I put the knives?”
“Is that your way of saying we don’t need a dictionary? How can we ask for directions?” Draco turned around and looked for the book which was now lying open on the floor. He picked it up and placed it on the table again, looking accusingly at Harry.
It was close to midnight and most of their former classmates had already retired to their rooms or even gone to bed, expecting tomorrow to be a hectic day as they were leaving Hogwarts once again. Ignoring the idea to look around for any witnesses, Harry placed the wellbeing of the love of his life above everything else and walked through the Common Room, crouching down in front of the Slytherin, Padfoot by his side.
“You’re an evil genius.”
He wanted to walk by Ginny, who blocked his way, shaking her head. “I highly doubt that you don’t want to hear that. And I think it’s in Harry’s wishes that I tell you.”
Well, Potter stood there, looking at the toys, squealed and threw his horse into the middle of the room, running at Draco again. Laughing, Draco picked up Potter, while Lovegood quickly placed the toy with the others.
The longer Draco watched them the more he thought that Nora couldn’t be a normal dog. She looked like she wanted to communicate with Harry, though both didn’t quite understand how it worked. Draco placed the books he was trying to read aside and grabbed a blank page.

“You guys are crazy” Draco said and smiled at his best friend, leaning at her shoulder.
“You can’t outrun us!” Blaise called towards him, though his lungs were not really working in his favor.
“Nothing, really” Harry admitted. He then motioned towards Draco. “I’m planning on this one having a freak out at breakfast and then a few harmless hexes thrown at each other.”
“And what did we work on exactly?” Draco frowned. Blaise hadn’t said that something had happened. Though maybe that was because they hadn’t had time to talk to each other after they had come back. Everyone went straight to bed and this morning, there were too many people around to have a secret discussion about something that officially hadn’t happened.
Ginny is holding another party. Are we ever going to meet your boyfriend? Please bring him along! Anyways, Neville said he saw you in a bakery with Malfoy!? And you too looked close to each other, I’m just wondering what’s going on there. Please tell me!
“I don’t know what to do now, Pansy. My father wants me to have someone
Pansy shrugged her shoulder. “I have no idea. I think the Thomas’ are still in bed.” Harry shared a knowing glance with Draco who smirked, before he bit into his toast. Pansy seemingly hadn’t seen it, as she just continued counting all the people that were still asleep. “And Hermione and Gregory haven’t shown up until now.”
McGonagall took the parchment and frowned at it as well now. “I’ve seen his cousin, when I observed them a few days prior to Harry being placed there. He didn’t seem older than Harry himself.”
Draco was actually about to scream loudly. And by the looks of it, Pansy wasn’t far behind. His relatives did more than just hating him and putting bars at his window! They physically broke him! They told him to work his arse off, gave him no validation at all through his childhood and once he was but a shell of a boy, his uncle abused his power... That had to be punished.
“I will always worry about people being disrespectful to you. Just because I ended up saving the Wizarding World by accident, doesn’t mean I couldn’t have turned out evil. Sometimes I think I am at the very least slightly evil.”
“Why would we… oh” Neville’s eyes widened. “How did you find out about the bingo sheet? We made a deal to never cross out the boxes in front of you. We kept them in our room and Ron and I had a secrecy spell over it.”
She looked at her boyfriend and sighed. “Ron, you’re being inconsiderate. If Harry feels more comfortable around Draco and his friends, we should be happy for him.” She looked at Draco and smiled, before she turned back to Weasley. “And I think it will do you good to be quiet for a while, at least until you have your anger under control again.”
Draco snorted. “You are a perfectly evil Slytherin.”
Potter laughed loudly and shook his head. “Yesterday, you told me you read the letter...”
“Draco… You know I didn’t mean it like that!” Pansy sighed as she took back her hand, not really sure what to do with it. “People will always see us as a part of the bad side. In my opinion, we should just enjoy having an unknowing child here, who sees us as what we are not what we were.”
Draco chuckled. “I honestly couldn’t care less about proper etiquette with my mother. She’s easily…” he hesitated.
“What are you looking for?”
“You scared me!”
Chuckling softly, Draco carefully brushed a strain of hair out of Harry’s face and smiled lovingly. “You just want us to be here. Alone in each other’s company.”
Neville sighed and shook his head. “But now, you do know what it does?”
“Not bad.”
“Harry, tell me. I can understand complicated shit.” That made Draco stop quickly and he sighed. “I still don’t understand how I’ve decided to take Transfigurations, though. If it has to do with Transfigurations, you might have to be patient with me.”
“What?!” Draco widened his eyes, almost frozen in shock. “You can’t do that! I’m an adult; you can’t just marry me off!”
“They’re his friends, Pansy…” Draco, even though he really didn’t want to, felt the need to say something positive for Weasley and Granger.
Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him closer, kissing him softly. “I love you, though. Nothing’s going to change that.”
“I’m sorry” Ron interrupted and shook his head again. He was probably still thinking he had somehow entered another universe. “Since when are you two on speaking terms?”
“My apologies, Mr. Potter. My family is praying for you. We hope you get better soon.”
“Potter?!” the voice was tired and the once blond hair looked almost dirty white. The man behind bars clearly hadn’t slept well in the past ten years, when the Ministry did their absolutely unnecessary imprisonment sequence of all the known Death Eater families. Not even Harry had been able to stop that. Draco’s eyes were sunken, though as their eyes met, the Slytherin got up and walked over to him.
“Now, now, Paddy” Draco sad softly and scratched him behind his ear. “I’ll put him back together, like I always do, yeah?”
“Hey” Draco said and Harry could almost hear him not trying to laugh. “Where are you right now?”
Smirking, the Gryffindor shrugged his shoulders. “Testing things like we did the food test?” Of course the Golden Boy had figured out that this test had done nothing for him, so Draco glared at him.
Harry quirked his eyebrows and grinned. “I was unaware that I was invited to join you.” He bit into his favorite sweet, satisfied with his answer, while Ron struggled with another threat.
He was just about to sit back down properly, putting some distance between them, when Draco grabbed his tie, pulling him closer again. He moved closer and kissed the corner of his lips, which made Harry freeze and he just stared at the Slytherin.
“Neville got kicked out of his home when he went with me, because running away from the Aurors isn’t really what you’re supposed to do. So, he’s not really doing all that well. I tried making him come tonight as well, but he kept repeating that he was only going to see you, when he had a job” Harry sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “So that’s what we did with our lives the last week. And that’s only summarizing the first five days.”
Harry glared at him. “Doesn’t matter. That detail isn’t what’s important, my dear. Important is that I’d rather be alone in our bedroom when that happens.”
That made Harry chuckle and he nodded. “I agree.”
“And I’m meaning it” Draco added shrugging his shoulders. He heard the fabric rustling against the other wizard and his stomach was suddenly the source of a very weird feeling. He had never felt something like this before. It was like his stomach was turning, but he didn’t feel sick. It tingled the way it had when he was on a roller coaster that one happy birthday before everything went downhill and he had to go to school and be a cold-hearted Slytherin. Maybe he was getting a cold?
As McGonagall laughed, he realized that even in his head she still was ‘McGonagall’ to him. He shook his head and smiled at his former professor.
It warmed Draco’s heart how thoughtful his ward was. “Thank you, Harry. You did think correctly.” And so, they both settled down in front of the TV, watching Draco’s movie which made him feel slightly better.
The young man shrugged, but got up anyway and gulped down his coke. “Thank you, Sirius! You’re always a big help. I’m sorry for interrupting your date...”
Harry chuckled. “I’ll see you around, guys!” With that he waved and hurriedly ran up to the castle. Draco could see him charging through the dungeon right now very well. He was definitely not going to make it. Unless he knew some kind of short cut.
“What happened?” Longbottom asked and frowned.
“You’re looking awfully chipper this morning” Theodore commented and raised his eyebrows. “What happened?”
“Welcome to Petamans!” they were welcomed as they entered the shop. It was well lit and at the front there were huge tanks with every imaginable reptile. There were also a few fish tanks and on the rather high roof there were a few tree branches with all kind of birds and other animals there. The man standing at the door was wearing the typical blue-yellow striped uniform and smiled his stereotypical shop worker smile. “Do you already have an idea of a pet or do you want to look around a little?”
Waaaaaaiiiit!! Are you and Malfoy a couple?! Holy shit, I’m throwing up!
Harry chuckled and looked at the newest addition to the Weasely-Granger family. “Well, Layla will definitely grow up in a loving environment. And I mean she’s beautiful!”
Two characters clearly in love with each other and the man winking at his love, while she giggles and tries her hardest not to come off as completely on love… Or the slowly growing grin on both their faces which somehow had turned into a love-struck expression.
“You’re lying to yourself, Draco.”
“You’re just… I… That’s not true” Draco shook his head. “I didn’t… He…” He couldn’t get his thoughts organized. Harry was into him? He had never even realized that. Yes, he did realize that Harry even hugged Theodore, but he assumed that was more so he could throw him into the lake. Then again, he had high-fived Blaise. He could have done that with him as well.
Malfoy was quiet for a little while as well. They just sat there quietly, doing nothing. Harry had to admit that as much as he didn’t want any company right now, he enjoyed this silence with Malfoy very much. Just hearing him breathing softly, how he moved in the moonlight slightly was enough.
“Absolutely” Evan winked at him and Draco suppressed rolling his eyes. Was he ever going to learn? Or maybe Draco should stop being nice to him and just close the door in front of his nose. Actually, next time he was definitely going to do that.
sound made him opened his eyes and he found Pansy standing there with a rather old looking camera.
Potter yawned and turned to look on his alarm clock. While doing so, he placed his chin on top of Draco’s head and he couldn’t stop himself from smiling happily. However, at the same time, he hated himself for it. He had just wanted to stay away from Potter, so he could leave once his job had been finished. Now... it seemed impossible.
Draco frowned slightly. He had no idea what to do with that. “So… how can I help, bear?”
From somewhere in the house, a loud voice belonging to Kyle could be heard and few rapid footsteps down the stairs followed. “Uncle Ron!” He called out and hugged him, when Tommy followed his older brother’s example.
“Wow. And now, you’re getting sued? How is that ever supposed to go over?”
Rolling his eyes, Draco slumped into an armchair. “Stop calling me Rapunzel and no, I don’t want some tea. Thanks, though.”
“My point is... how can anybody like the lonely and dark dungeons?!” He asked, throwing his hands into the air, while water drops almost created a rainbow. Harry giggled at this.
Harry’s eyes darted over the names at the wall, until he stopped with one. He walked over and carefully brushed the dust off that section. All names had descendants and more names, while this one had only one offspring and it was a girl which from the dates underneath died when she was four years old.
Harry laughed and pulled Draco impossibly closer. “Only for you, Dray.”
Nothing would have prepared Draco for what he was about to see on the Injury Parchment, once Madam Pomfrey handed it to him, white in her face.
“Fine.” Harry saw Dean rolling his eyes and placing a kiss on his husband’s lips, just as Draco finally let go of his neck. Harry closed his eyes and leaned back into Draco’s touch. His now soft kisses moved over his neck to his jaw line. He almost couldn’t concentrate on the discussion in front of the curtains anymore. Still, he heard Dean talking again. “Just for you, I’ll stay here and I won’t complain.”
Before he could continue, Draco turned to McGonagall. There was something far more important that he needed to discuss than whatever it was, the Aurors needed to know. “Headmistress, where’s Harry?” He should have been with Ginny, but the Gryffindor was now here and there was no sight of his ward...
“I’m not Henry” he said sheepishly and the first man nodded.
Harry nodded. “Sure. Thanks.”

“Well then, my assistants will take a little bit of blood from both of you” he motioned the two people, who Draco just now realized were in the room, to do so, while he continued. “We will then perform the ancient blood adoption ritual.” Graeme turned to Draco. “Mr. Nemo, will you please go to the back and choose a flower in the other room?”
“Victor thinks you’ve killed a man and are avoiding police. Preston believes that you are actually married, but had an affair and somehow there’s also a child involved.” Potter frowned, while Draco smirked about their theories. “Connor considers the option that you are actually a maniac trying to kill everyone in this village.” Potter shrugged his shoulders, smirking, and Draco had to place his orange juice on the table so he wouldn’t spill it, laughing. “Oh, and James feels that you’re looking for the girl that broke your heart, after she ran away from you, because you asked her to marry you and she said no. Or the other way around, I don’t remember.”
