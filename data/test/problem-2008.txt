Soft, sobbing sounds started to fill the room. He could not remember the last time he cried. Perhaps his increased consumption of firewhiskey, over the last several weeks, had a hand in it. He felt Harry’s strong arms wrap around him, but the touch burned him. He was tainted. Something as pure as the savior should not even be near him, let alone touching him.
“Harry. If my performance earlier today doesn’t communicate to you what this means to me, then I don’t know what will. I literally got on my knees for you. I told you I won’t fuck Blaise again, and I’m a man of my word.”
“Oh, Malfoy, it’s just you. I was looking for Harry. I was told he was in here. Do you know where he is?”
Harry was jittery with nerves as he showered and cleaned himself, inside out, per Draco’s command. He wondered if it would hurt too badly. He knew he should have staved off his potion, but Draco had forced him to drink it the minute they came home. Off the potion, his pain tolerance was much higher around the full moon. What would Draco be doing to him tonight? He was extremely nervous to find out but strangely excited, at the same time.
“Oh, Draco. I’m so sorry…I know the timing couldn’t be worse, but don’t you think that this could be a blessing in disguise? Now, you can separate from her, without feeling guilty.”
Harry doesn’t know what came over him. Thinking about his new slavery makes him uncomfortable and unsettled. He feels like a raw nerve. When Draco mentioned him, he just saw red. He couldn’t stop himself. The need for destruction was palpable. Destruction was a decision he could control. Once a very powerful wizard, now, a slave. He feels that all his power and status amounts to nothing. Total weakness threads through his rapid pulse. He’s so certain that Draco is going to leave him for Blaise or some other sub that was better at this than him. Or just leave him, period. And there will be nothing he can do about it.
The chained man mouthed “please” to Draco, and Draco had to close his eyes against it. He was excruciatingly hard and tried to focus his gaze elsewhere. Unfortunately, his eyes landed on a glass cabinet against the wall that held different styles of whips. This man was, apparently, game for all types of submissive exploits, from the right type of dominant.
He grabbed the rope to hoist him back on his feet, but his upper body remained bent forward and downward.
He reached with his free hand for a glass of water on the nightstand to quench his parched throat when his fingers knocked something sitting in front of it. They were glasses, round glasses. He would know them anywhere.
If it was not the public that tore them apart, it would implode from within. Harry was no submissive lover, like Blaise. Someone like Blaise was Draco’s only true option. It was casual and under control. It worked with him because he yielded to Draco, mind, body, and soul.
Harry nodded slowly, not turning to look at him, but Draco cupped his chin and turned so their eyes could meet.
Draco was relieved he was completely healed, but also annoyed that Harry called what he did to him a mere scratch. The man was never going to learn at this rate. Still, though he may be able to handle it, Draco could not. He grabbed his hand on the table.
Still, the tears weakened him, as they always did. There was a new desperation in him that honestly, scared the hell out of him. He would play along and make him think they were in a scene, for his sake.
Tears drip down Harry’s face he does. His hand runs over his shaved head. “I can’t even tell you how…” Harry exhales slowly.
He thanked his lucky stars that Harry was married to his childhood sweetheart and was most certainly not bent. If he was, Blaise knew he wouldn’t stand a chance against Harry.
Neech, the oldest of the house elves, one who came from a long line, serving only the Malfoys, came up to Draco to ask him if he was unsatisfied with the cooking. He clutched his face in his hand, showing off a solid gold ring with the Malfoy coat of arms. Tears flowed freely down his face.
He buried his face in Harry’s strong chest. He smelled so good, like wood and rain, that musky oaky scent mixed with his cologne, and it made his mouth water.
Neech came in to deliver them treacle tart in the parlor, knowing it was Harry’s favorite. He took his with delight and began scarfing it down in large bites.
Draco looked into his pleading sub eyes. The man was so beautiful, it was sometimes hard to look at him. He was wearing fitted grey trousers and a thin blue v-neck sweater that outlined his perfectly fit, lithe body. He was sporting his classic handsome movie star grin as his deep blue eyes twinkled, hopefully. He looked like a star on an Italian soap opera. His wavy black hair sat perfectly in place, unlike Harry’s.
“I know the guy’s never been in a serious relationship because of you, all his life. I know that you’ve ruined him, for good, and you’re probably going to do the same to me, because you’re fucked up that way. I don’t know why I even bother. I don’t need this shit from you.”
“Mr. Malfoy, why hello, thank you for inviting us to your looovely home,” he said mockingly, making fun of their fathers. Scorpius giggled hysterically before taking his hand and shaking it emphatically.
When he finally arrived to his office, Harry was waiting for him with his arms crossed, leaning against his desk. He insides clenched at the sight.
“Fuck you, Potter. You don’t know anything about me. I don’t know why, in the buggering fuck, I ever let you in my life. You’ve brought me nothing but problems. I’m leaving.”
He gasps in anger when he realizes Harry’s already slick with lube. Using his forearm to push the back of his neck into the wooded wall, he twists his right arm behind his back.
One of the best ways to bring Dom Draco to the surface was to ignite his jealousy, as Blaise had done. He flirted shamelessly with everyone in the office, some men, but mostly women, knowing Draco secretly feared that he still craved women.
“This is easier, you’re too bloody smashed to even stand properly.” It was infinitely easier for Harry even though Malfoy was a good couple inches taller, Harry had toned up quite a bit between fighting a massive battle and having practically nothing to do all summer.
He nudged the door open and cast a soft lumos, Rons curtains were open, but both of them had (at least) shirts on for Harry’s sake. He was so glad they had each other like this, the war hadn’t left any of them unscathed, but as time went on Ron and Hermione clung to each other less, clutched their wands less, and didn’t duck when they heard latin. They had been attending those 8th year therapy sessions, (Ron only for Hermione’s sake) and it genuinely had helped them both. Harry knew they wanted him to attend too, but he wasn’t ready to share everything he thought about to a stranger or a room of his peers.
“Taking me to bed Potter? What a gentleman, though I must warn you i’m not normally that type of girl.” Malfoy did his best to wink suggestively, but it really ended up looking more like an aggressive blink. They were climbing the stairs now, and Harry was having a bit more difficulty hoisting Malfoy with his legs stumbling all about them. He eventually got fed up with the trouble of it all, and crouched down to scoop Malfoys legs out from under him.
“I’m all good ma’am, honestly i don't quite need those sessions. Besides, it’s kind of weird to hear everyone talk about their dead relatives and then stare at me like i’m why it all happened.”  He could tell he was rambling now, so he quickly shut his mouth.
He walked backwards to the door, trying to keep the floorboards from creaking. He turned around and slowly pulled the door open, it squeaked just the smallest bit, but it was still enough to make Malfoy shift about in bed.
“Ah, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind as to help Mr. Malfoy here up to his bedroom. I do believe the rooms are warded against all women, including myself.” She smiled tightly at harry as he stood up from the couch.
“Alright Malfoy let’s get you up to bed before you sick up on me.” Which was seeming more and more like a very real possibility.
“Mr. Malfoy, is it wrong of me to presume that you are heavily intoxicated at this moment?” Her stern gaze rested on his bloodied hair and her face softened a bit.
Harry smiled fondly at him and kept his voice at a whisper. “Mate, you’re never gonna believe where i w-” He stopped short when an absolutely thunderous snore caught his sentence and snuffed away his words. He laughed softly and slipped under his covers, setting his glasses on the table and his wand under his pillow.
“Well—” he began, intending to carry their charade as long as he could when a commotion behind them made him turn.
“I can sleep in the conservatory,” Potter said abruptly, studying the building with tight lips as he ran his hand through his messy black hair. “I’m used to being out in the field.”
There was a mumbled response, but Harry didn’t catch it because Draco made a particularly deft manoeuvre with his wrist and he nearly came.
After the animals were taken care of, Draco only managed twenty minutes of quiet contemplation in the garden before he discovered Harry Potter pounding on his door for the second time that morning. He wondered idly if he should start selling tickets. It would serve the git right: invade Draco’s privacy, and he would show equal respect in turn.
Draco nodded, glancing at the pinboard. “And with them… an end to this. Finally. My debt will be paid. Well—as soon as we solve this curse.”
It was, Hagrid had enthused, entirely the wrong sort of environment for his baby bubotubers, who, he said, required a cool, if slightly damp, habitat for optimal growth. The kind of environment, he pleaded, that perfectly fit the guest chambers dotting the hallway up and down the dungeons that would have otherwise housed them all.
a virgin,” he said, not with even a little bit of the embarrassment he’d felt before at saying so. “And you came just after me.”
Their eyes meet, and something in them makes Harry’s chest tighten with grief. The expression there isn’t only heated with lust; it is warm and open in a way that is nothing like how Malfoy really looks at him, and everything like how Harry wishes he would.
He’d kept tabs on Potter since Hogwarts. Who hadn’t? Mostly, he’d found the attention-seeking golden boy had continued much as he’d begun—with the world handed to him on a silver platter, despite how little he cared to follow its rules. It was infuriating, but Draco had learned to ignore it and focus on his own crap. There was more than enough of it to take up his attention. And eventually he had sort of… forgotten Potter.
“Was the instrument designed to understand the curse or prevent it infecting us in the next two days?”
“Malfoy,” Potter mumbled, grasping for Draco and succeeding in wrapping the gilded lines of his collar around feeble palms. “Help me… It… It
Then, he felt a warm hand in his, and he turned back to see Malfoy watching him, a knowing look on his face and something else—something Harry had never thought he would see in those grey eyes: compassion.
“He’s stable,” she said softly, speaking to both of them. “And the Healers say there is no mind damage at this point in time. Draco and Harry will find the solution.”
Draco caught sight of the cover of the book and gave a small start. “I used to have that book when I was younger,” he said, smiling at the little girl. “It has wonderful fairy tales in it.”
If an ancient cabinet had proven so unwilling to cooperate, Draco could only imagine what it would be like trying to Vanish the residual debris of a Horcrux. An ordinary Vanishing spell would never have worked, and that thing had been in Potter’s body, in his blood. It wouldn’t want to leave, not without a damn good reason to go. Trying to give it a destination—trying to override its Dark will with your own determination and deliberate intent—would be near impossible.
“You didn’t have to wait for me,” Harry said heatedly, stung by his sudden waspishness. “You didn’t have to wake me up.”
Back at Kalen’s house, Draco had felt like he could sleep for a thousand years, but now he was suddenly wide awake. Potter went into the kitchen and put the kettle on, and Draco tried to find a piece of furniture to sit on that didn’t look like it had once been a packing crate.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, flushing a brilliant shade of red as he realised what Malfoy meant. “Good idea. Nobody ever comes to the library.”
A small Pensieve sat on the table next to the package, shimmering faintly beneath the strength of the wards Draco had set. The first time they drank the Transition Potion, the wards on the door would activate and their memories would be stored in the Pensieve. It was only when the spell sensed that the curse had been successfully disarmed that the wards would come down and their memories could be returned.
He didn’t know if he’d ever have anything more with Potter than the few weeks of graceless connection they’d shared. He didn’t know if Potter would choose to heal or if he’d just keep going as he was until it ground him into the dirt. He couldn’t plan for this sort of future, just as he hadn’t been able to plan for a life spent with the Dark Lord living in his house.
“Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess,” Weasley said brightly. “Mum and dad are out at the theatre, so we’ve all popped in to give the house a bit of a blitz for them.”
Potter’s eyes slid to his, and he took a step forward, wand raised. “I have an idea,” he said, cheeks slightly flushed. “It’s a… er… spell that…” he trailed off and gestured helplessly to Draco’s arm.
As they sipped, a different mood descended on the living room. The open windows brought the sound of soft scuffling as Alan, Maisie, and Turquoise—only one of whom Draco had named—scratched in the earth searching for insects. And with that sound came peace. The fragrant liquid soothed Draco’s mind, the breeze soothed his body, and even Potter seemed to relax.
“Well that’s fucking rich,” Harry snapped back, both furious that Malfoy had been so quick to attack and indecently pleased that Malfoy wasn’t all soft edges these days. “That guy was practically rutting against you back there, and you looked like it was just another dull afternoon.”
to be something he wasn’t. They had been simple nights. In their mutual deception, they had entered a space where their true selves could come forth. They’d accepted each other’s flaws, admired hidden strengths, and learned to know each other in ways that Draco was only just beginning to know himself.
“Surely the small matter of people’s lives being saved is considered a net gain,” Draco said injecting as much cynicism into his voice as possible despite how dry his mouth was.
“And to think, you were suggesting we just charge ahead without any more research,” Potter said with a faint grin. “How disgustingly Gryffindor of you.”
Did you know that Hogwarts was the first place that ever felt like a real home to me? Every summer, I had to come back to my aunt and uncle’s house, and it was like going back into a cage. There were actually bars on the windows at one point.
“Seems a little biased,” Malfoy said, looking over at Ron and Hermione with narrowed eyes. “They could probably do that without the quiz.”
“I’m just curious,” he said finally. “Potter seemed so… off-kilter the other day, after our argument. I thought there might be something more serious brewing.” He forced himself to smile. “But you know best.”
Harry, who didn’t have to imagine quite so much as his friends, stayed quiet and played with what was left of his mushy peas.
Harry had simply assumed he was. Malfoy was so hesitant, so unsure about taking things quickly, that he had just taken it as fact that Malfoy was unexperienced. So, when he overheard Zabini and Parkinson laughing about one of Malfoy’s old conquests who was apparently trying to win him back via a drunken strip tease on the other side of the club, his mind went strangely fuzzy and blank.
He focuses on his tea while Draco scans the paper, confused and unsure why Harry is so upset. It’s hard to explain, even now. It’s only a photo after all, and like Draco says, it’s a good one. He looks commanding, intimidating even, but also happy. Privately, he would admit that it is probably an accurate representation for once, but that’s exactly the problem.
He waited a few minutes and then decided Potter must have fallen asleep in front of the hearth. The image soothed him, warming him all the way to his toes despite the dying fire. He stood up, stretching his hands above his head and sighing at the delicious cracks his body made.
“By focusing on Muggle-borns and half-blood families, you’re inadvertently subjecting pure-bloods to the same stereotyped bias that you’re trying to avoid.” He held up a hand to stop Potter’s objections. “I
He looked over at the box, sitting innocently in the circle. “Right,” he said. “So that’s what it is.”
“Emily,” she said, pointing towards the end of the line. “The little blonde one, just there. My name’s Evie.”
Potter murmured something in agreement, but he was too busy taking note of the train of wheels to respond properly.
You want to tell the papers that the person in that photograph is me? Go ahead. I don’t give a fuck anymore. No one will make me bow my head to them, ever again.”
The whole idea of BDSM had come from Blaise in the first place. It was at his request that he be tied down in submission, and Draco was only too happy to oblige. It suited them, and fifteen years of sex required variety to survive.
They were still fully clothed when Draco felt Harry’s erection jutting against him. He broke the kiss to draw breath, feeling lightheaded, and Harry attacked his neck with loud kisses and began to unbutton his shirt. Draco literally melted into him, powerless.
Blaise began to retreat with a look of pure heartbreak on his face. Draco’s heart plummeted at the sight. He got up to follow him out of the dining room.
Draco stroked his arms as Harry lay his head on his chest and sighed. Harry’s cock was already fully erect against his thigh but Draco was completely soft.
“Listen, Draco, I know it was harsh, but it needed to be done. You were never going to tell him about me. If he knows you’re involved with someone, then he can move on too. I did you a favor.”
On the third night he’s back, Blaise materializes in his floo. He looks…different, older somehow. Looking at Draco with pure loathing, he holds up an old piece of parchment in his hand. The edges are frayed and it’s completely yellowed. Draco realizes it’s the contract. He sets it down on the table without saying a word and pulls his wand out.
He moved his lips over it, breathing against it, but not directly on it, and traveled back up his chest in a similar fashion, millimeters away from making contact. Blaise was shaking by the time he stood up again.
He considered saying one of his safe words, but hesitated, wondering if he really wanted this to stop. Almost as if he’d read his mind, Draco approached him, letting the leash slide through his gloved fingers. “Your words, pet?”
“Yeah, because you got off all those pain potions this week. Same thing happened to me. Your dick goes haywire.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Draco. We both know who’s fault this is. Don’t you go blaming yourself for Potter’s brutish behavior. Don’t you dare give him a free pass, like everyone else does.”
When Draco didn’t move, Harry manhandled him roughly out of the tub and threw him into the bedroom. Draco almost fell, but he was able to stumble onto the bed and lie face first.
It was only then that Draco felt an overwhelming sense of shame at having a failed marriage, for all to see. Half the reason for getting married, in the first place, was to support each other at public functions such as this. He did not expect it to be this painful, without Astoria.
Purposely trying to make Draco miserable. He storms into the parlor, pouring a generous helping of firewhiskey and takes it down like a shot. He pours another and sits down, staring at the fire broodingly.
Even though he thinks he’d been with his assistant. Even though he told him not to come near him at the DMLE.
“Yeah…had a really good time in Paris,” and he flashes him his warm smile. “Thanks Drake. He was great.”
That’s not true, though, he thinks dully. He’s a liar—to himself. All the signs were there. Blaise tried to tell him. He made sure he never knew the truth because if he had known, he would have had to stop. No one looks their own destruction in the face and says
“God,” Harry breathed, hot breath into Draco’s ear. He squeezes Draco’s firm ass, grinding his cock up against him. “I want you.”
Blaise didn’t give him a chance to recover before thrusting his cock back into his mouth and setting a fast, deep pace.
But, he still obliged. He pulled him forward by his hair and started fucking his mouth deeply. He loved hearing Blaise gag when he went too far. He was moaning in rapture around Draco’s cock, loving the rough treatment. It spurred him on to know he was pleasing him, after hearing he had let others in his bed. His sounds were driving him to the edge, but Draco needed to fuck him before cumming in his mouth. He planned to fill his hole with multiple loads tonight.
He had been in a good mood for months now, but the only thing that was able to sour his mood was the off-chance that he would run into Blaise at the ministry. Harry did not know why it boiled his blood, just to see him. He was the one who won Draco and Blaise had lost. He could not name a single reason to hate the man, but his hatred burned strong, even after all these months of having Draco wrapped around his arms.
He wished he could cancel on Blaise and surprise Harry at Grimmauld instead, but this was not possible. He needed everything to run smoothly in his life if he was going to continue this explosive thing with Harry.
Draco had so much to do for work the next day. The Monday blues were creeping up on him early, even though it was only Sunday afternoon. He wondered if he really would have to complete Harry’s reports for him, if he should just do it now.
Draco worked through lunch that day, trying his hardest to avoid Blaise. He knew he was going to have to speak to him soon, but he was not looking forward to that conversation.
The whole thing was over in under fifteen minutes but had felt like a long battle. He was drained completely, and a wave of exhaustion overtook him.
Hermione smiles teasingly at Harry, then looks at Draco. “I don’t know how you dealt with him these last few weeks, Draco. The day you opened your eyes, no one had even told Harry they were waking you up.”
“You’re telling me that all this time we’ve been together, Blaise has some magically binding contract that says you’re still his?”
She shriek-laughs so loudly, that it peels over the ward’s noises. She laughs so loud and long she’s snorting. Harry stands up because he’s angry, and you can’t be angry sitting down.
Blaise moaned in slight pain at Draco roughly fucking him, hard and fast, now. His flesh was slapping against his loudly. Draco relished the sounds.
“But father, he’s been so sad lately, and I promised. You always say, ‘A Malfoy never goes back on his word.’ His parents are always yelling at each other, and he barely sees his dad anymore. Don’t you know who his dad is? It’s Harry Potter, for cripe’s sake! You’re both aurors. You must be friends. Please, can we go visit them? I’ll do anything. I’ll take piano lessons!”
“Ten swats, just enough to warm you up…Remember, I’m spanking you for my pleasure. And I will spank you whenever I like,” Draco announced.
He lines himself up behind Harry and breaches his entrance carefully, fucking into him at an agonizingly slow pace. Any faster and it's going to be over sooner than he wants. He reaches around to stroke Harry’s cock in time. This slow fuck is pure torture for Harry, who’s edging right at the brink of his orgasm the entire time, begging to cum throughout. He's mewling like a tortured animal. Occasionally Draco speeds up and once he feels that Harry is about to blow, he withdraws completely and squeezes the base of Harry’s cock painfully to stave off his orgasm. Once he’s sure Harry won’t cum, he restarts his torture, working inside him once more. He angles forcefully at his prostate now, stroking his cock faster.
It reiterated to him that Harry deserved the power in this relationship. He was confused by his willingness and want to sacrifice it, especially to someone like him.
“My assets, sir?” he snorted. Draco gave his ass another smack as an answer while he smiled wide behind him.
“A little hard to spend the rest of your life with someone when you're keeping your kids away. Now, who’s the dirty little secret?”
When he exited the bathroom, Harry was already showered and sitting up in bed, reading a case file. Where as once the sight of Draco’s damp nude body caused his eyes to darken with lust, now, it caused his eyes to narrow in disdain, as if Draco were imposing on him in his own home. If the sight of him was so disagreeable, then he didn’t understand what Harry was still doing in his bed.
It’s high cost wasn’t due to just the diamonds and gold, but also the protective enchantments and anti-theft charms placed upon it. It would shield Astoria from most minor curses and would burn hot if anyone but a Malfoy tried to wear it, melting their skin.
Draco gets on his knees to stroke his thick erection, working him from base to tip, where he finds a slick bead of precum.
Draco couldn’t believe he used the pet name that he loathed above all others, but it just slipped out, and it sounded right.
“Pansy’s great. She can be a little needy, like every spoiled pureblood girl, but nothing I can’t handle. I definitely go shopping more. I can tell you that.”
When Draco got home, he was drained from his long shopping day. He grinned when he thought of his trip down knockturn alley to visit his favorite sex toy shop. He bought Harry a collar, in the event that he would deserve to wear it. It was presumptuous to think he would be game, despite what he was saying, but he couldn’t help getting his hopes up.
Harry turned his pleading eyes to Draco, receiving a little swat as a reminder. “Eyes down. Perhaps you’d better kneel pet,” Draco said under his breath.
Blaise merely nodded his head, knowing not to argue, and kept his head turned away. Draco moved forward to give him a soft kiss on his neck, and disapparated back to Malfoy Manor.
It did not help that he was running into Blaise more and more, around the ministry. He would not approach him or speak to him, but he did not have to. One look into his pleading submissive eyes was enough to force Draco’s memories of him to the surface.
With only a single stroke of his hand, Harry shot jets of thick cum against the shower wall. Draco came at the same time, with a loud shout. He could not remember the last time he orgasmed so hard. He hugged Harry’s back leaning his cheek against it, trying to catch his breath.
He had lost his job. He had lost Harry. Blaise was lying unconscious in a hospital bed, and now, he had lost his wife. He could not listen to her, for a single moment. He was standing at the edge of a cliff.
Blaise nodded again, wiping his face and leaned closer for another kiss. Draco kissed him longer now, gently massaging his tongue.
Harry was wearing black trousers as well, but a forest green button down that brightened his eyes. He looked good enough to eat.
He did not know what it was, but it made him kiss Harry back like a starving animal who’s only food was Harry’s soft lips. Harry stumbled backwards with his enthusiasm. Draco virtually attacked him, in his passion, grasping everywhere on his body, working quickly to remove his dress robes, biting and sucking his lips.
It rankled to know that the Doms were the true slaves. Tirelessly working to insure the happiness of their sub. Always the ones who had to maintain complete composure, often ignoring their own desires for the sake of punishment or discipline. It was too much on Draco sometimes, which is why it wasn’t full time. They went through oscillating phases of regular sex and play.
It was amazing, a burst of savory flavor in his mouth. He needed a greasy meat to settle the firewhiskey from the night before.
Harry grew emotional thinking of his son, Albus’ namesake, Severus Snape. He used to tell him the same thing and that’s probably where Draco learned it, considering he was his godfather. He felt even more respect for Draco now, knowing he was mentored by the bravest man he ever knew. Harry nodded at him.
He wanted to tell him as much, but he just slipped on a pair of briefs and crawled to his side of the bed. Harry turned the lamps off with a wave of his hand and set his case file on the night stand, tucking in. Draco could hardly breathe through his grief. He focused on the window and knew this would be another night devoid of sleep.
Draco glared at him, at his shining gold badge designating him the head auror. He had no words for the man standing before him. It was almost as if he enjoyed Draco’s wrath. Sometimes, Harry returned his anger in equal measure, which Draco preferred.
Harry could not allow that to happen. His love for Draco lived in every molecule of his body. He often daydreamed of marrying him and could not wait to spend the rest of his life with his blond angel. He planned to propose at the one-year mark, and this needed to be dealt with, before then.
Though Harry plays the top, Draco is no submissive. He pushes Harry to lie flat on the bed and kisses him so hard that Harry is dizzy by the time he parts. He rips his clothes off by hand, but Harry can’t be bothered, he just magics Draco’s clothes away to feel him naked against him as quickly as possible. Draco moved his mouth to kiss his jaw, his throat. He moved hotly down, along the line of his neck, then licks his nipples, nipping the buds to hardness. He moves back up to his neck, sucking Harry's hot spot. Harry holds him there and—and this is what it felt like, to be wanted, to be truly desired—to be devoured.
Draco looked up. Blaise was wearing an apprehensive look as if walking through a minefield. It made his heart squeeze. Blaise thought his behavior was due to his Wednesday morning confession, and Draco seethed with guilt over the fact that he hadn’t given it a second thought, until now.
Harry’s eyes widened at the pet name, but he seemed to enjoy it because he smiled and picked up the pace.
Finally, his cock was gliding in smoothly and he set a steady pace. He put both hands back on deck and began to move with deep punishing thrusts.
When he doesn’t answer, Draco fiddles around his drawer looking for the master key to Malfoy Manor. He has to shake the door until it finally catches and pushes in slowly. He finds Harry in the shower with his forehead against the wall, his broad shoulders heaving. Draco steps in and touches his shoulder; it feels goose-bumped, slicked in cold sweat.
“Well, pet,” he drawled. “Today was quite a treat for me. And tonight I have a treat for you. Please put these on.”
To his dismay, he discovered that Harry was a huge fan of public displays of affection. Harry never cared about the barrage of cameras that would flash as he held Draco's hand in public whilst out on a shopping trip. At first Draco was alarmed by this behavior and would quickly move his hand away.
Instead, he continued to stare at the fire, contemplating the multiple horrors of the day. He felt broken, inside.
More days pass. For the first time in a while, Draco wishes he could talk to his mom. He tries to keeps busy, spending most nights riding his horses until his body is sore. As he lies in bed at night, he’s forced to admit there’s something wrong with him.
Blaise’s eyes light up when he sees him in his perfectly fitted grey ensemble. Draco’s wearing light grey plaid trousers, a white collared shirt, and a fitted matching vest with a silver pocket watch. The chain hangs out of the pocket making him look extremely posh. There was a strict dress code at the Wizarding Country Club and he never passes up a chance to flaunt his style. They shake hands and order drinks. They chat for a while about work and sports. Blaise asks after Scorpius. They’re three drinks in when Blaise mentions it.
What he did not understand was Harry’s defiant anger about it afterwards, as if some sort of secret had been revealed. He expected a shy, embarrassed, spluttering Harry, not a livid one.
Some of the side effects may cause a minor disruption in your life, but they will only occur around the full moon. Since you were having sex with a partner just before, your emotions for that partner will be extremely heightened, and you’ll have an increased libido. Your core temperature will be set higher, around this time, and all your senses will be heightened as well. You’ll also exhibit extreme anger, violence, possessiveness, aggressiveness, and an increased tolerance for pain, around your partner. I can give you a potion to help combat those symptoms. It’s a variation of the wolfsbane potion. I suggest you take it easy, for a few days.”
He pressed his hands to his eyes, cursing his own stupidity, as Harry lay unconscious in a hospital bed. He began to stir to wakefulness and reached out to grasp Draco’s hand, which he took immediately. He looked better. He was still flushed, but had stopped sweating.
He had gotten horrifically drunk and dragged Blaise to that room to suck his cock and fuck him within an inch of his life. Blaise looked particularly handsome that evening and was stealing the focus of most of the party attendees. All eyes were on him as is ought to be. He was wearing a perfectly tailored tuxedo. Everyone was dressed in muggle eveningwear that night to honor the event, but none so effectively as Blaise. He was charming, dashing, single, and rich. He was chatting up everybody that night but carefully avoiding Draco, who was there with Astoria. He flirted shamelessly with any witch or wizard who was brave enough to walk up to him.
If he was honest with himself and his mood, at the moment, he preferred Harry to stick his cock inside him, instead, but that was not possible. It would shift their new dynamic. It would put him at his mercy, again, under his spell for eternity. He just wasn’t in the mood, regardless, for any sex, whatsoever. It rarely happened, but here he was. When Harry went to remove his pajama pants, he stopped him.
“Don’t treat me like I’m some holier than thou hero. I hate that. That’s the whole reason this won’t work. You won’t let me give you what you need. You’ll never tie me up, even if I ask for it. You view me as this innocent wholesome hero. Meanwhile, Blaise gets to be your ‘cum slut’ and take seven loads from you in a single night. This isn’t going to work Draco. How can it? You’re hiding a big part of yourself from me. That’s the part that gives you the most pleasure. It might be fine now, but how about in a few months when you crave it again? You think I’ll be able to handle it when you cheat on me to get your rocks off with some submissive bloke? I’ll fucking lose it if that happens. This isn’t going to work.”
He took the words right out of Draco’s mouth. If Harry hadn’t behaved so rashly outside of the ministry, this would never had happened. Blaise never acted so rash in public.
He dressed fully, cast a glamour charm over his face, for good measure, and left the small closet, without a word, letting the heavy metal door close with a loud thunk, behind him.
“Breathe, Potter. It’s easier if you breathe.” Draco didn’t recognize his own voice. It was tender, laced with lust and longing.
“If Draco could see you now, he would tell your wild boar self to get a shower. He would hate to see you like this.”
Draco decided to stop by Malfoy Manor to get some personal items for Blaise. A change of clothes, a toothbrush, and some of his favorite records. St. Mungo’s had a magical record player in every room.
“I know I shouldn’t be here because of your ‘new terms’. I have to go soon, anyway. I promised Al I’d spend the day with him.”
Of course, she loves him. Everyone loves Blaise, except for Harry. He had a sexy charisma that Draco has never found in another person. He could convince anyone to do anything.
Draco did as he was bid and sat at that table, burning with the shame of his words. Harry stared at him, trying to reign in a smile. He was wiping his eyes because his laughter had brought him to tears. For cripe’s sake, it wasn’t that funny.
Blaise took his cock back into his mouth setting a slow languid pace. Draco looked down at Blaise’s perfect full lips suctioning his cock. He loved to watch Blaise, unawares. He watched his long dark thick eyelashes flutter, as Draco gave a hard thrust into his mouth.
was that he couldn’t escape Potter’s perfection wherever he went, the git. His damage was being forced to picnic with scarhead on a beautiful Sunday afternoon during non-working hours. His damage was that stupid tingle that went through him any time he accidentally touched Harry. It was likely, a tingle of disgust, to be expected, but it rankled, all the same.
He looked up when Draco came in, briefly, but didn’t stop punching. In fact, he began punching even harder.
“What would you have me say?” Draco asked in his soft drawl, “Do you want to hear how beautiful are? Do you want to hear about the way your skin is coloring for me? Or do you merely want my voice?” He struck again and again, harder, and just a little faster. “I want you to let go, pet. Just feel, don’t worry. I’m here.”
The sun was setting over the Malfoy grounds beautifully with oranges and purples streaking the sky. He leaned against the railing watching the sun dip lower. It
Draco is so changed himself—so wasted for him, years on end now—all his focus is on staunching his own wounds. He’s not looking past himself.
The healer gives him a flat faced look. Draco’s sure she knows who he is, and she’s not happy about it.
His only wish was that he was doing all these things to Harry tonight, instead. He quickly banished the thought. He could not imagine Harry enduring this kind of treatment. It just was not meant for him. He was too whole and good, not fucked up like he and Blaise, twisted Slytherins that they were. He compartmentalized Harry in his mind, so that he would not have to think of him again, for the rest of the night.
Harry always made him felt off-kilter and it made him vulnerable. He did not like feeling weak. Harry was a weakness, one that needed to be cut out, like a boil, lest it get infected and kill him.
When he arrives, he’s greeted by Harry laughing on the ground while his kids tackle him on the floor. It makes him smile…until Harry catches sight of him and his smile falters. Harry’s whole face falls, and his children stare at Draco as if he were an exotic beast.
It had been a whole day under attack, unbeknownst to Harry. The man had no idea how deeply he affected Draco.
Draco closed his eyes at the blissful tightness around his cock. He missed this feeling. He wrapped an arm around Blaise’s hip to pull him back as he thrust forward.
“Listen, forget everything I said that day. Everything’s fine the way it is. I don’t know what I was thinking. It was a complete lapse in judgement. My head was all jumbled from the newspaper article which wasn’t even accurate, by the way. I’m bisexual, not gay, as you know. I will start dating a pureblood woman soon and we can continue where we left off.”
“Technically, he’s still mine. My responsibility. But again, it doesn’t mean anything. He hasn’t even brought it up. It was signed over ten years ago. I’m sure he’s forgotten all about it. It’s nothing to stress over.”
“Mine,” Draco purred, feeling Harry harden more under his fingers. Not wasting time, and hoping to keep Harry confused and disoriented, he replaced his hand
When Draco was finally in his office, behind a closed door, he let out another sigh of relief. This was far worse than he could have ever anticipated. He felt like he was dying inside. He had worked tirelessly, for over a decade, to bring honor back to his name, and overnight, all his work became irrelevant. He was, now, only known for being a vile, disgusting deatheater who tricked the savior into a relationship. His reputation would never recover.
When Draco asked after Pansy, he was pleased to hear that he was still actively dating her, and that it was going very well.
He finally allowed Harry to leave the manor after they dressed together in his walk-in closet, grinning at each other like fools. Draco was thinking he would have to fuck Harry in this closet, at some point. He cursed inwardly at his own horniness. He was always thinking with his cock.
“Every crazy person in a hundred mile radius will always flock to us, and it’s because of me. If you stop seeing
and circles him, stopping behind him. Wanting Blaise to trust him fully, he leans close to his ear. “If you’re a good boy, I’ll sink my cock into that tight hole of yours. Would you like that, pet?”
Neech snapped his fingers and they instantly vanished. Draco was thankful Scorpius spent his weekdays with Astoria being homeschooled and didn’t have to experience this barrage of hate-mail. He only had him on weekends now, as he worked during the week.
“Don’t you dare threaten me, Draco! How dare you threaten to take my son away from me? Why don’t we talk about what’s really disgusting, hm? Why don’t we talk about how you’ve been fucking your male lover for the past fifteen years! Your best friend, the same person who comes here and plays with Scorpius, in our house. I’ve never said a word to you about it! Now, you’re two-timing him with yet, another man, the Savior of the Wizarding World, himself. Did you think I didn’t know it was you, in that Daily Profit article?”
Harry released him, his face hardening once more. He dropped the wash cloth in the tub and left the bathroom.
“You need to come pick your stuff up from the manor, tonight. I don’t need any more reminders of you! If you don’t come pick them up this weekend, you will never see them again. I’m transferring to the DMLE in Paris. I plan on informing Shacklebolt on Monday.”
“Didn’t know what,” Draco whispers. Harry lifts the hand behind his head to wipe his eyes and forces himself to say it.
Draco was so relieved when the end of his work day came. He worked through lunch, as he had promised himself, but it was incredibly hard to focus after Harry’s morning visit, pun intended. He barely got any work done because his erection persisted long after Harry left. As soon as he started to get into a work flow and his erection subsided, one of Harry’s sexy phrases would pop up in his mind, and his cock would reawaken like a lightening rod. He had a sneaking suspicion that this was Harry’s intention, all along.
Many park goers shot them evil glares as they passed. Draco didn’t know if it was because they were skateboarding on a walk path or because of that shockingly blonde hair that most certainly designated him a Malfoy. Either way, Draco couldn’t bring himself to care.
Draco didn’t know what to do. He stood up and walked towards him. His back was tense. He put a hand on his shoulder.
He knew Harry would be hurt if he ever found out he had come here, but as he was planning to remain completely faithful, he did not see the harm in engaging his retinas with a little domination/submission action. Harry did not need to be exposed to this part of himself. He was too pure for this darker side of Draco.
He knew he shouldn’t be surprised to see Blaise sitting across from her in the parlor, but he was. He couldn’t believe his eyes. Could his best friend really be capable of such a thing? At the present moment, Astoria was chuckling softly at a joke Blaise was telling. His heart was on fire.
As for losing your would-be lover, I’m assuming that’s me. You haven’t lost me. I’m right here. I’ll always be, right here.”
At that, Draco forcefully rutted his soft cock against Blaise’s clothed arse making Blaise chuckle. “Is that all you think about? Bloody perv.”
“I don’t want to stand outside in the sun for hours, Malfoy. The car has a disillusion charm built in and cool air too.
Draco wants to tell him that he’s already paid. That he’s broken up with Harry. That he needs his best mate now more than ever, but it’s too late. Blaise disappeared into the floo without so much as glance.
He nodded against his pillow and pushed his ass back into Harry’s cock, earning a loud groan. His own cock stirred in response at the sound. Harry reached around to stroke it as he muttered the preparation charms wandlessly. He kept rubbing against him, teasing his hole. His cock kept catching the rim, but Harry wasn’t breaching him. This went on for a few minutes. He seemed to be waiting for something.
“This next pose is called 'Present.' On your hands and knees. Down on your elbows—yes, like that. Arch your back so your ass is raised.”
He did not understand how he was teetering so close to the edge, when he had just cum inside him a few hours ago. He was behaving like a prepubescent boy.
When he arrived on the floor of the DMLE, it was almost completely empty. It was a Saturday and there had been no critical arrests. He walked right passed the head Auror’s door which was wide open, looking straight ahead. He picked up speed when he neared his own office and closed the door quickly behind him.
The week that followed their office break-up was the worst week of Draco’s life. Harry had been avoiding him, at all costs. Even when there was a big case, he would choose a different partner to accompany him.
Draco sighed. “I’m not doing this to upset you. You are a very beautiful boy, Harry. If I let you walk in there with no sign that you have an owner, you might not like what would happen next. You won't be hurt, but you might have to fend off a number of offers from some persistent admirers. I’m not going to put you in that position, understand? This way the other Tops will know that you already belong to me.”
In the past, this had never been a problem, as he usually became a participant. Many approached him for sex at this club and he was only too happy to oblige, that is, if they did not mind being chained and whipped. That type of treatment was too much for a wizard, even for Blaise. He was very picky, when choosing a parter, and almost always chose someone who looked like Harry, now that he thought about it. He did not count these muggles as part of his sexual exploits, as he did not even know their names. Only Blaise and Harry registered as true sexual partners. This was just his fantasy world.
He carefully planned in advance what he would be doing with him, especially if it was rope play. That was half the fun.
Harry hears the crack of a curse behind him, but before he can turn around he’s shoved so hard, he topples face first ten feet away.
“Auror Malfoy, I need to see you in my office when you’re done with your lunch date. Take your time.” He turned and stormed away.
“Let me make myself clear. What happened, earlier today, in the parlor will never happen again. I can guarantee to you that we will have another fight, but you can never use sex as a form of punishment. If that ever happens again, we’re done.”
If he thought Harry was going to approach him in a humble, apologetic manner, he was sorely mistaken. He adopted the same harsh, brash, demanding tone he used upon their return from Turkey, when Draco told him they could no longer be involved. It wasn't an act. This was real. He should have stuck to his instincts the minute they came back from that trip and stayed away from him, because this time, his patience had run out.
Harry had his arms crossed and a shoulder braced against the window as he looked out over the property. He was very still and relaxed. The light from the window washed over his rumpled hair making him look very young. He appeared lost in thought until he heard Draco enter the room, and then turned to face him in the display position, eyes to the floor.
He considered simply not accepting the invitation, but after ditching him the night before, he knew that wouldn’t be possible.
When he looked up at the mirror again, he saw Harry standing right behind him, his naked chest dripping with sweat, still in his gym shorts.
When he reached his bedroom, he kissed him tenderly on his forehead and set him down gently on the bed.
Harry looked up, contemplating Draco’s brooding figure and said, “You’re really great with your son.”
Blaise tried to keep quiet but eventually started screaming in ecstasy. The minute he did, it triggered Draco’s orgasm, and he slowed his pace until he finished shooting his load inside.
“This is Regulus Black’s room, Sirius’ brother. I was thinking this could be your room, while you stay here, so that you could have some privacy…but you’re always welcome in my bed, of course.”
Blaise took in the scene before him. They were both in work clothes. A case file was still in Draco’s hand.
This was his best friend, not some nameless cockwhore, no matter what Draco said in the heat of the moment. He was angry at himself for thinking of Harry at a time like this. It felt like betrayal.
He was kissing him with brutal force everywhere on his body, his chest, his abs, his pelvic bone. Red sharp marks were already starting to form, but Draco just melted into him. For the first time, he surrendered completely.
Blaise gasped in shock, not used to this kind of behavior at work, but quickly caught onto to Draco’s mood. Draco’s tongue plundered his mouth which had a minty taste and something else, something that was so undeniably Blaise, fresh and citrusy. His hands roamed all over his body, gripping his tight arse. Draco was trying to burn the image of Harry from his mind with visceral brute force.
Malfoy curled into him like a child. “She’s my only friend, Potter,” he mumbled into Harry’s collarbone.
“It looks uncomfortable,” he said, the words an echo of the last time they had been here, but suggesting something entirely different.
They finished sorting out their workstations, Harry’s propped on what had obviously once been a stool and was now a three-legged table and Malfoy’s on a dresser, and met at the edge of the balcony. Arranged beneath the parapet were the selection of dark artefacts they were here to examine.
He regards Harry curiously for a moment before turning to move around the room, checking for any final possessions hidden in the corners.
“I’d listen to them, Draco,” Pansy said, still looking a little stunned at the whole thing. “They know best.”
“Why do you need feathers?” Draco spat, refusing to budge even though he was becoming faintly cross-eyed at this distance. The thought of Potter waiting it out in his front garden, only to slip away when he needed Draco’s help, pissed him off for reasons he couldn’t explain.
“Do you know how hard it is to get anything approved by these people?” Potter kept speaking, unaware of Draco’s reaction. “They care more about money than they do about helping others.”
Blaise tipped his head back and laughed, the sound rolling around them in the cavernous room. “Well, she has a point.”
Draco could. Potter had carried this with him, alone. No matter that he hadn’t needed to recreate the evil acts one was required to do to create a Horcrux—just creating the echo of such evil would be awful enough, letting it mix with your own magic, producing something so horrible, so twisted. Draco felt sick, and sicker still at the knowledge that Potter had done it alone, with the threat of failure and unknown consequence looming over him every step of the way.
Alan cried out his appreciation, the haunting baby-like wail answered immediately by the other four peafowl that roosted by the conservatory, and scurried out onto the lawn. Draco spent a lavish thirty minutes inspecting the orchids, adjusting a few pots where he had expected blooms by now and making a mental note to trim the vines he had, perhaps foolishly, allowed to grow on the southern corner of the conservatory. A couple of yellowed leaves gave him mild cause for alarm, but given the bespectacled elephant sleeping inside his living room, it didn’t last long.
Ron clapped Harry on the back before sweeping him into an impromptu hug. Harry’s eyes widened in alarm, but he returned the hug with enthusiasm, and when they pulled back they were both grinning like schoolboys.
“Ten minutes,” he replied. Scorpius grasped Draco around the middle in delight for a few seconds and then skipped towards the blanket that Albus directed him to. Harry watched this interaction with rapt interest.
“Oh yeah? How? I’m curious to know how you think you’re going to get him to break it. Because I just don’t see him doing it.”
Draco stood up now, livid in his anger. He was going to hex Blaise’s balls off. Blaise told him previously that nothing sexual happened between he and the young unspeakable. In Draco’s absence, it appeared things had changed.
He walked closer and leaned over the pensive to observe the scene. Harry was already inside it. He could see that it was Blaise’s bedroom.
Harry began to wash him as he did that morning after they first had sex in Turkey. He also got right down on his knees and gave him his best blowjob, to date. In the end, Harry was sure to splash his own face with Draco’s cum, sticking his tongue out, to make sure none was wasted on the floor, just as he did in the Turkish bath. The whole thing gave Draco a deep sense of deja-vu. It tugged the string connecting his heart to his hippocampus, solidifying those memories into his soul, forever. There would be no escaping them, in the future.
Neech came into the dining room to see what all the commotion was. His eyes widened to saucers when he saw the destruction in the room. Draco stepped over broken glass to retrieve his case file from the wreckage and cut his hand a broken piece of china in the process.
Draco let out a girly moan, but he hardly cared, at this point. The only thing that mattered was Harry filling him up, with his power. It came off in waves, and was strongest where they were connected. He felt only pleasure now.
Harry kissed him tenderly and looked at him again, trying to communicate silently. Draco broke his gaze and stood up to buckle his trousers. It suddenly felt too hot in the room. He needed to get out of there.
The parlor is warm from hearth as Draco pours them each a glass of firewhiskey. He tries to hand one one to Harry but his arms are crossed and he’s staring impertinently away from him. He sets it down on the table and sits across from him.
“Draco, ugh, harder. Please, “ Blaise moaned. Draco loved it when Blaise begged, but he ignored his request. He pounded into him from behind, slowly, almost tenderly, driving Blaise mad with desire, dragging out their mutual pleasure as long as possible.
Draco took pity on one of the potioneers. He claimed that he was only doing their bidding because they had threatened to
The house elves were falling all over themselves. They usually didn’t like when people entered the kitchens while they they were working, as Scorpius often did, but they were acting as if the Queen of England had arrived.
Harry just stared at him for a moment then reached for his hand to hold it, his palm opened. At first, Draco was hesitant. They were in a public place where anyone could walk in, but he was powerless against his pleading eyes.
when they first arrived, sinking down to his knees and swallowing Draco’s cock whole, the moment they arrived in the hotel room.
Draco, it was for the sake of the kids. And you? I notice you get angry about my wife, but I’m just suppose to forget about the fact that your happily married to Astoria. This is completely one-sided. When are you going to separate from your wife and give this a real chance?”
He could, however, imagine living without Blaise. Though Blaise undoubtedly sparks his desires, and he mourns for the pain he causes him, he’s always considered him as no more than a friend with benefits. Someone he loves, to be sure, but nothing could compare to the avalanche of sickening love he feels for Harry. The kind that makes it hard to breathe. Hard to sleep. Hard to eat. He swallows the bile that works up his throat when he thinks of his hard, expressionless face, turning, and walking out on him.
Draco just nodded into his arm. Harry’s breathy little whispers were driving him insane with lust. He reached down to stroke his cock as Harry tightened his grip on his hips to intensify his brutal strokes. He had Draco crowded against the wall and Draco tried his hardest to to prevent his face from crashing forward into it. He used his free arm as a barrier, but Harry’s forceful thrusts were making it a difficult task. He hardly minded. His orgasm was approaching like a freight train.
“Goodnight Potter,” and he went into his room and shut the door, without waiting for Harry to respond.
Harry stroked his shoulders first, significantly broader these days. He stroked down his newly muscled back and sighed. Draco had managed to put on fifteen pounds of weight, in muscle, in these last six months, under Harry’s guidance at the gym. He was still trim, but he was almost as broad in the shoulders as his partner. Yet, Harry was still significantly stronger. Draco suspected he would always be the stronger one.
Shacklebolt held him responsible for Harry’s paperwork. Draco seemed to be the only one Harry listened to, when it came to following protocol.
Draco’s heart sank as Harry narrowed his eyes at him. Draco gave him a pleading look in return, silently begging him to stay quiet and not to make a scene.
Draco can’t order him to turn back around and tell him what’s wrong with the collar off, but he suspects he knows, in any case. He’s wracked with guilt but hasn’t had time to find Blaise a new Dom, too busy fucking Harry eight ways from Sunday in his new play room and on every surface he could manage. He strokes his arm lovingly.
Though Harry had asked for it, Draco firmly believed that Harry would not only be incapable of being his submissive, but that he was insisting on it for the wrong reasons. It was only his jealousy of Blaise that was pushing him into these ludicrous ideas. He wished he knew what suddenly re-sparked it.
“Seeing you with your son is such a turn on. You’re so good with him…Such a stern dad. Are you going to give me some of that daddy cock?”
It would be the third night this week that he considered handing in a letter of resignation. If this is what being an auror would be like in a post-Harry world, then he was no longer interested. He did not need to work, regardless.
Roast and potatoes was Draco’s very favorite meal. He never ate it as a kid. His parents thought it nothing more than overcooked cheap meat, fit for commoners.
This was unforgivable on Astoria’s part. The woman was stealing money from her husband to sustain her lover’s gambling addiction. Nott reminded Draco, so much, of Astoria’s father.
Draco’s heart warmed considerably when he read that part. It was always possible that Mr. Jones was using a quick-notes quill that embellished each of Harry’s reactions, like Rita Skeeter’s had done in the past, so he did not get his hopes up. Still, he found himself reading that part over and over again, despite himself.
Draco looked up at Blaise who wore a stoic expression and did not meet his eyes, choosing instead to stare at the fire. His shoulders were slumped forward. He looked strangely vulnerable.
Draco got off the bed quickly, intending to head to the bathroom to clean himself off, but he was stopped by Harry kneeling in front of him.
The air in the cramped car was tense, to say the least. They sat in silence a long time. Harry usually prattled,on and on, when they were stuck on stakeouts together. Draco felt Harry’s frustrated magic wash over him and cracked open a window, hoping to release some of it. Harry drew it up again, from his side.
That was believable enough, Draco thought. It was mostly, the truth. Still, Blaise’s face fell, and he quickly turned around and walked out of the shop.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t see the problem, then. Blaise is a big boy. He’ll recover. The only thing that won’t recover is your relationship afterwards…Is that what you’re really worried about, Draco?” he asks softly, not meeting his eyes.
It had become too much to endure. He knew that if he stayed another moment longer, he would cheat on Harry. He would face fuck that attractive moroccan man until he choked and gagged on his thick cock. He would grab the whip from that mediocre looking man and crack the soft leather on that ass the way the submissive truly craved. He would fuck him so hard that his chains would rattle and break the legs of the table. He would make him scream loud enough to be heard, from all the way upstairs.
He needed to calm down and pull it together. His hand trembled slightly as he lifted the firewhiskey to his lips, but his back was turned. Thankfully, Harry couldn’t see.
Harry screamed in pain before a magical light burst from his wand, flooding the cabin inside and the space outside the door with an unnatural, bright white light. Draco’s last thought before loosing consciousness was that Harry looked like some ethereal dark angel, light surrounding him, face contorted in rage.
He would soon be gone from him, for two months, and Draco suspected the worst. He was going to lose him, for good.
Draco nodded in front of him, not trusting his voice. Harry’s sex-laden, scratchy, sleeping voice, promising him slow sex, was almost too much to handle.
“Don’t stop fucking me. Please don’t stop.” Something crashes on the other side of the room and Draco’s head turns to it, then back on Harry because he can't be bothered.
Draco gets on the bed using a stool Harry put besides it, afraid his levitating magic will jostle him too much. Harry’s right besides him as Draco pulls his sweatpants down.
“Let me hear your pretty little noises, my dragon…I need to hear you…I need to know…Is this how you need it?…Is this how you need to be fucked?”
Draco didn’t know what to say. His first instinct was to instantly reject him, but he couldn’t do that. What reason would he give? He didn’t want Blaise to know about Harry, after he so recently told him it was over between them. He would look like a liar or worse, weak. Besides, he and Harry were casual, no matter what it felt like when they were together. The terms were set. It wasn’t as if they were an exclusive couple in a relationship. Using Blaise as buffer between them would be good for him. Things were always too intense between them, even with Draco as the top.
Harry slept many nights away from Draco at Grimmauld Place with the claim that he had been spending too much time away from his children.
He groaned in pleasure when he was breeched. He had long grown accustomed to being Harry’s bottom and relished the initial sting of being entered. Harry slid all the way in and stilled. Kissing Draco, he put both hands behind his neck, and then buried his face in his chest.
Tears flowed freely down his face, alarming Harry, so he hugged him through the water, getting his shirt wet.
“I was lying. I was just trying to make you feel bad. This doesn’t have to mean anything. Just a friendly poke.”
“Harry, I’m no longer involved with Blaise. It’s just a matter of telling him. Is the sex not satisfactory to you? I will do whatever you want me to do, but I’m enjoying things as they are. It’s a new experience for me. Aren’t you enjoying it, too?”
The table was set for two already. A single long stem candle was burning in the middle of the table.
Draco couldn’t help but return it. He burned for Harry. He instantly felt feverish. He was simply too desperate for the man to stop him, and he allowed this to go on for a few minutes. Harry palmed his cock through his trousers.
The fact that Blaise never married or seemed to be dating anyone seriously, as of late, sometimes worried Draco. Whenever he brought it up to the blue eyed Italian god, he would shrug it off and change the subject.
Harry raises his eyebrows at that. Draco’s always been a little hesitant to spend time together with Harry in public, especially in the wizarding parts of London where they would be easily be recognized. He mostly just endures it, and only after Harry pressures him so much, it annoys him into agreeing. He thought his hesitancy would be doubled now that word of their brief separation hit the papers. The papers claimed that it was Draco’s fault that Harry Potter almost died, but he weaseled his way back into his heart by staying at his bedside. It was a horrifically unflattering portrayal of Draco, and Harry planned on ripping the limbs off the Daily Profit reporter who wrote it. Alas, Harry is used to the perils of fake news. He’s beyond excited as Draco returns from his manor with a picnic basket prepared by Neech.
Draco went into his office when they got back to the DMLE and did not emerge until the end of the day. Harry had stopped by, mid day, knocking softly, to deliver him a coffee and a sandwich. The coffee was just the way Draco liked it.
He crawled into bed, solemnly, feeling Harry do the same next to him, on the opposite side. His eyelids felt like lead, but Harry’s words were rattling around in his brain. After a few minutes, he felt Harry wrap his warm arms around him.
with one long rope traveling from his bound wrists to the head of the bed. Harry could not move a muscle.
Harry’s heart flutters so forcefully that he has to look away from a moment. He scans the crowd and sees that many park-goers are staring at them disapprovingly, but if Draco doesn’t mind, then Harry doesn’t either.
He hardly knew what to do about it and had the impulse to withdraw into himself. A cooling off period, from Harry, was in order. He wished he could take some time alone, to think, but that was no longer possible. Scorpius was spending the weekend with his mother, at the beach cottage, and Harry was already invited to spend the weekend at Malfoy Manor. Cursing himself for this lack of foresight, he could hardly revoke the invitation now.
Draco scours the newspapers every day to see if he’s been with his assistant out at any restaurants. He wonders if he’s seeing her. He wants to hope he’s seeing her. He tries to tell himself that stupid lie—that he’d be happy if he was with someone.
“I wish. It only works because I cast a special spell on Albus and he shares my blood. It’s a tweaked version of the family protection spell. Made it myself.”
A paper airplane memo landed on his desk. It was from Harry, requesting his immediate presence in his office.
He started for a moment, as if out of a daze, and took his time straightening up. He looked back before leaving, hesitant to say something, but deciding to say it anyway.
Blaise laugh softly, blushing to the ground. Draco knows he won’t sacrifice the collar, no matter what he says.
Draco looked away. He couldn’t bear to look into those stranger eyes. It was just another reminder of what he had lost.
He did not make it this far, only to fail forty-five minutes before he was going to see Harry again. He was being driven mad with lust in this god-forsaken country. He grabbed his trunk and walked far away from the spot so that the man would not be able to find him again.
It was a lovely meal, but Harry seemed determined to bed Draco, and it ran along like a potent undercurrent the entire evening. It was threatening to pull Draco under.
Auror Malfoy, you are the best auror I’ve got. Together, you and Harry have a clearance rate ten times that of any other auror pair, and your reports are done swiftly and accurately. You have been working with us for ten years, and I have never once caught a mistake. If you think I’m going to let you walk now, then you are sorely mistaken. You should have thought about a replacement before making this request. You both refuse to train anyone in your methods. Who could possibly be a candidate to replace you? Auror Potter would never file a single report again. No offense Harry.”
When he arrived home the night before, he was too tired to think. He had just enough time to tuck Scorpius in, shower off the smell of sex, and collapse on the bed in a fit of exhaustion.
Draco should remove his belt and lash him until he screams. He should leave him with his pants down, ass marked red, and never look back. His Dom is screaming at him to punish him and leave him, but he can’t. He spanks his ass fours times in quick succession then brutally shoves his cock inside his hole. Grabbing hold onto Harry’s shoulders for leverage, he fucks him so fast and hard that Harry’s screaming. The wall is rattling loudly, and it sounds like war. He doesn’t care about Harry’s pleasure and doesn’t want him to enjoy it, in any case. The stable’s walls are shaking ominously and Draco thinks for a moment that the whole structure might collapse on top of them. It’s been standing since before his grandfather’s time, but he doesn’t care enough to stop. He reaches over to pinch one of Harry’s nipples through his shirt, twisting the nub painfully, earning a yelp.
He should have noticed the minute he fell to his knees. Sometime between the snowy cabin and now—Harry changed.
Draco felt his face heating up, uncomfortable at the intimate, knowing way that she said this. It was almost sympathetic. He moved his hand out from underneath hers in a huff and crossed his arms.
“I bet Potter is the only reason you’re here in the first place, so we will talk about him. What’s the matter with you? Have you lost your marbles? You’re far too different from him, Draco. He doesn’t understand social etiquette and we both know how important that is to you. You guys aren’t the right match. It’s not going to last and, deep down, you know it. How long will you continue to live in denial? This isn’t like you.
Harry just wasn’t meant to be the submissive lover, the way Blaise was. Draco didn’t see him that way, at the present moment, and it became painful to imagine. The man was too all powerful and pure to be taking it up the ass from someone like Draco.
Draco forced a pillow under his lower back so that he was propped up to allow Harry an easy passage. He spread his thighs high and wide holding them backwards, with his hands behind his knees to keep them spread apart and angle his hole higher. Harry groaned at his position. While still kissing him, he gripped the base of his cock and guided it to his opening, on feel, alone. When he finally breached his entrance, sliding all the way the hilt, they both let out a collective groan.
He was surprised he still retained bodily functions, at this point. He bid the aurors helping on the case, farewell. Harry was on the opposite end of the room, speaking with the forensics department. He practically ran to the lifts, to get to the floo in the atrium, not wanting Harry to catch wind of his leaving.
Draco was worried sick. The aurors arrived almost immediately. He quickly briefed them, then apparated Harry to St. Mungo’s.
He slaps his ass hard before casting preparation charms on him and enters him in one swift stroke. Harry groans.
Blaise is his best friend, his most trusted and loyal confidant. Out of all of Draco’s friends, Blaise was the only one Draco considered a true equal. He was exceedingly wealthy, good looking, from a great pureblood family, and had a wicked sense of humor that Draco enjoyed very much.
Harry kissed him languidly and softly now tasting himself on Draco’s tongue. He tried to touch his cock, but Draco smacked his hand away.
This turned out to be a fruitless endeavor. After searching many hours through the night, they hadn’t been able to uncover so much as a paw print in the snow, let alone a pack of human werewolves. The storm was too heavy for them to find anything. They could hardly see their feet in front of them.
Draco shifts his legs so they’re off the couch. Harry moves to help him. He still has a few healing ribs, but he’s got almost all his strength back. It’s still tricky to get up off beds and couches, and when he gets up or sits down, Harry helps him.
I can be cold, rude, brash, demanding. I’m broken and depraved…” Draco shook his head at himself. “You’re whole and wonderful, Harry. The most beautiful, brave man I know, and you can do far better than me. I’m just a kinky bastard. I will always thrill at the sight of you bent over my knee getting your arse warmed up. I can’t promise that I’ll ever want to stop spanking you.”
“You should take that calming drought, Harry. You remember? The healer prescribed it. I think it could really help.”
The blonde bloke stood up. His hair was not as blonde as Draco’s but rather a warm honey. He stood taller than Draco at 6’4. He was massive but trim. Draco hated him immediately.
He should hate him. This was the world’s darling who fell to his knees in front of him, a vile deatheater, a brooding half-man. And he can’t even shuck an ex for him.
When this thing with Harry eventually imploded, the way Draco was certain it would, he would be in a terrible predicament. This interlude was hot and heavy now, but it was not stable. He was old enough to know that the hottest fires always burn out the fastest. He would be left with nothing, no Harry and no Blaise.
After allowing Harry to adjust to the intrusion, he began to thrust slowly, very slowly. If he quickened his pace, he was sure to cum in under a minute.
Harry shakes his head, and swears he can hear Draco smiling. From this position, he can easily stroke his cock as Draco continues to fuck him and choke him, at once. Harry is already getting dizzy. Little spots are starting to form in his vision, and for reasons unbeknownst to him, it sparks the beginning of his climax.
It was right in front of the central bay window. It was difficult to reach, crowded all around by tables, but it was in full view of all the patrons, as well as anyone walking by the cafe outside. Draco felt exposed.
It wasn’t too crowded. The sand was soft underneath his feet and he inhaled the fresh air as he looked out at the crystal clear blue waters. He saw land masses in the distance and short mountainous areas lining the far edges of the beach with houses perched atop.
Harry looked around at the crowd, unable to read their expressions, but he was sure that some of them agreed with this vile criminal. It suddenly made him wrought with fear and panic. He let go of the man and turned to Draco.
Draco was shouting and his voice broke at the end as his eyes filled with tears. It felt like the beginning of their destruction. He was suddenly ripping apart at the seams. He was trying to draw breath but nothing came. The air in his lungs felt frozen. Harry rushed forward and held him around his middle, rubbing his back soothingly.
He palmed Harry’s cock through his trousers and placed soft kisses on his neck, to drive his point home.
lunch together at that table nearly every day for ten years, but Draco had not sat there for six months. Sensing his presence, Blaise looked up and locked eyes with him.
“I’m sorry, Draco.” It’s barely a rasp. Draco steps closer, and he sees his eyes are red. His mouth is tight.
“I miss you goddamn much that I can’t breathe sometimes,” his voice is broken as he talks near his ear, like he’s about to cry, so Draco holds him close, unable to bear it. Blaise buries his face in his neck and inhales, holding him in a death grip and starts trembling.
He’s trembling so violently it almost seems fake. Then he starts to cough. Once he gets going, he can’t stop. He can tell because his eyes flip open in alarm, and his hand comes to his throat. It’s a low, rough-sounding cough with lots of wheezing at the end. Then, with no breather, another long, hard coughing spell. His dazed, half-rolling eyes grab hold of Draco’s, and he realizes he should be doing something.
Draco didn’t answer and continued to pack a bag in a flurry of rage. Astoria began to get desperate. She started removing all of Draco’s clothes from his suitcase.
