He ignored Pansy's scowl and marched up the stairs.
“You’re right as always. At least I have you to keep me honest sunshine.”
“You don’t expect us to live with them do you?” Boot burst out, pointing an accusing finger at the Slytherin’s.
“I feel like even though I’m free to be myself now, I’m still ashamed,” Draco said slowly, “it might take a while for me to get over that. Part of me still needs approval from everybody.”
Draco nudged Justin beside him.
“No need Finch-Fletchley, I had a wonderful time causing an uproar in the boys bathroom. As if there was anything in there I would be interested in. You’re all happy enough to let Blaise in there.”
“Outcasts? Weasley practically has his own tribe, you’re the brightest witch of our age, and then there’s Harry bloody Potter! Famous before he could walk and talk.”
“What the fuck?” said Draco weakly.
He flicked his wand at the record player and the music was silenced. They left the room together for the empty hall. As they passed a door flew open, and Longbottom hurried out on his way to the bathroom. He paused when he saw them, his eyes flicking between them as his brow furrowed in confusion.
Potter turned to leave, before he stopped and looked back at McGonagall.
“Justin! It’s so good to see you.” Blaise exclaimed as though he’d just noticed his existence, which honestly was probably true.
Hermione sighed heavily.
“No,” said Blaise wearily. His eyes were shrewd. “I think what Draco has is stubbornness.”
Draco continued to watch Potter. He was laughing at something Finnigan had said, but his eyes were still tight with fury.
He reached up to stroke the tufts of the owl’s ears. Ulysses bit him.
He left the pub with Beckett and McDonald, and fell in step with Potter as they followed the Professor’s up the dark Hogsmead street.
“Oh, I was right, it looks lovely! I wish I could get my hair to do that.” she gushed.
This was ridiculous. Draco really needed to take some control back. He’d agreed to go along with Potter’s plan, but there didn’t seem to even be much of a plan so far. His anxiety riddled brain couldn’t live in the unknown for much longer. Hermione was right, he was overthinking this.
“Granger?” he blurted out, and she paused, her arms full of books. “Could I talk to you for a minute? Privately?”
“Ergh, I’ve always hated that nickname. ‘The Golden Trio’, ridiculous. When we became friends we were just outcasts. That makes us sound like a folk band or something.”
Draco stood frozen, staring at her. Arranged marriages were not uncommon in pure blood families. If the war hadn’t happened, his father would have already arranged Draco’s own engagement. He would have had very little say in the matter. As awful as it had been, Draco was suddenly very relieved the war had happened.
“Has she not spoken to you yet?” Draco sighed.
“Excuse me? I missed that, say it louder so everyone can hear you.”
Tracey laughed, “Rules are made to be broken Longbottom. You can say something you’ve done as long as you don’t mind everyone seeing you drink as well. I just want to get everyone drunk.”
Draco put down his quill and stared after him. He had no idea what that had been about. Why would Potter want to go out with him for any reason?
I don’t let myself wonder about how they would have reacted if I were an only child. Why make oneself miserable over something that isn’t the case. Honestly, it’s easier for them to understand my being gay than it is for them to understand my being a wizard. I do wonder how all the abnormalities in our family fell on me.”
“I meant,” she said faintly, “you’re OK with Luna being related to you?”
“Sorry that I’m actually taking this seriously. You’re not the one who will look stupid if this gets out,” he hissed, aware that the library was full of eavesdroppers.
He didn’t want to acknowledge that it was wearing him down. The notes on healing magic that he’d made last year, which he’d mainly used when he’d been forced to go back home, were now much more extensive. He knew the incantation for bruises off by heart, and he’d fixed a broken nose and several broken fingers. He knew the counter spells for quite a few nasty jinxes. If only he were taking Defence Against the Dark Arts as a NEWT, he thought he might do pretty well.
“You little shit Justin! You said you wouldn’t tell anyone about that,” MacMillan whined as he blushed beetroot red and refilled his drink.
“Really?” he said instead, “That’s the excuse you’re going with?”
“What do you mean full access? I received the money,” she replied, blinking owlishly at him.
Draco didn’t feel like laughing anymore. His insides felt cold. He looked away and saw Justin was also watching Blaise, a small frown creasing between his eyes.
Justin had left earlier that morning, with the rest of the school, to catch the train back to London. He’d only found out yesterday evening that Draco was staying behind, when he’d scolded him for not being packed. Justin had been as concerned as Pansy, and had invited Draco to come home with him too. Draco had been almost tempted. He could see what the muggle holidays were like, and spend time with people who would have absolutely no clue who he was or what he had done. He could just spend two weeks being Justin’s school friend.
“I hope I’m not keeping you from class Lovegood?” he gasped between steps.
He didn’t know if he should be worried or furious.
“Map?” was all she said, and Potter nodded.
He started up the next spiral staircase to the boys dorms. These were thankfully empty, but when he was half way up, he heard footsteps behind him. He quickened his pace, hurrying up the last of the stairs. The footsteps behind him sped up too.
He knocked back his cup of coffee in one, stood up with a stretch, and ruffled Luna’s hair before disappearing as quickly as he arrived.
“I’m happy with how this looks, it should be good as new in another hour or so. You’re free to go if you feel better Mr Malfoy.”
“OK, help? I’ve never been anyone’s boyfriend before,” he admitted, embarrassed, “real or otherwise.”
Draco vanished the remaining blood, and looked back up into Potter’s eyes with a small smile.
Potter huffed.
“Mine,” he replied, showing her the slice on his palm.
They all crowded onto the moving spiral staircase. Draco’s breathing hitched in panic, the unknown of the near future crashing over him. He closed his eyes briefly, trying to centre himself. He almost yelped in surprise when he felt a cold, calloused hand grip his fingers tightly. His eyes popped open and he looked down at Potter beside him, who was staring straight ahead. Potter squeezed his hand reassuringly, and then let go. The brief contact was enough to shock Draco into the present.
Everyone was drinking except Weasley, Longbottom, MacMillan, Pansy and Ravenclaw Patil.
“Harry,” he said again, the unmistakable warning in his tone had Potter looking at the floor and clenching his fists.
Silence.
“I was with Potter at the bar. I didn’t get involved with the fight until I saw the camera.”
“No you didn’t, I chose to get involved,” countered Draco.
There was a heavy silence. Draco didn’t think it was any of his business, so he wasn’t going to press the issue.
“Sleep,” he commanded, pointing at Draco to emphasise his point, but the expression behind his eyes told Draco that he wasn’t going to give it up that easily.
Draco supposed he shouldn’t really be surprised about how excited everyone was to have a few drinks in the common room and call it a party. Not after the last year they’d all had.
“I’m bored of this. Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s, what does it even matter? We all fought in the same war, and we’re lucky to still be here. Sure, we didn’t all fight on the same side. Parkinson over there was ready to throw me to Voldemort to save herself, but do you see me crying about that?
Pansy tugged Draco backwards, making for the edge of the crowd, which was beginning to disperse. Blaise was waiting for them, his eyes sweeping the room, holding back a scared looking Justin.
“I just wanted to say thank you for the tip,” he said, grinning.
She was in serious business mode now, like he was a particularly complex rune translation she intended to solve.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco remembered the conversation he had overheard Hermione have with Luna. It sounded like she was still struggling with a solution to her problem.
“OK. Promise you’ll let me know what you think later?”
The common room was chaos. Almost 60 kids in a room built for 20 was always going to be a recipe for disaster.
McGonagall was looking around at the scattered stragglers too.
Justin flushed.
“No bother at all old boy, thrilled to have you.”
Boot was sitting on the other side of the common room with Anthony Goldstein, obviously offended by the mere existence of the Slytherin’s. His perpetually angry expression shifted to one of surprise when Pansy burst out laughing and shot him the finger.
“I’m starting to learn that,” he rasped. “That’s very generous of you, to give me a chance like that when I don’t feel like I earned it.”
She squeezed his hand.
Her smile was more relaxed when she pulled out her textbook.
“No, definitely not. He only said he wanted to take me out to apologise for last Friday? Which I said was completely unnecessary.”
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Potter get up and disappear back into the crowd. He turned his head to watch him leave, feeling forlorn.
“There are a few extra things I need to discuss with you. As you know everyone left in your year group was offered the chance to return to complete your final year in education. It wasn’t the right choice for everybody, but for the few of you who are here we have had to make a some changes. You’re all going to have very different schedules, and I’ve decided not to place any of the usual curfew restrictions on you. To make things easier you will all have your own group common room and dormitories separated from your Houses, located in Central Tower.”
For some reason his words caused a look of relief to flash in Hermione’s eyes.
The two steps they took away form the bar took them closer to the red faced Howard.
“You didn’t hear what he said,” muttered Potter darkly.
“Isn’t that a muggle drinking game? How is that a Slytherin game?”
He bounded up from the bed, rushing forwards and grabbing Draco’s hands.
“Oh I do pity you,” Blaise sniffed, turning back to the bar.
He took a deep breath.
“Sorry Lisa, I’m closed for business when it comes to girls,” he laughed.
“What are you talking about Blaise? What did you see?”
A few people seemed to be drawing the same conclusions and staring at Potter. Weasley was resolutely not looking at Potter or Granger, but staring around at the other three people to drink. He knew about Potter already. This was the source of the mysterious rift in the Golden Trio, Draco was sure of it.
He was wearing a cream knit jumper and mauve trousers.
Draco thought that was an understatement, but he really wanted to know what had happened to the Golden Trio.
“I should have sent you a message. Did I mention I was sorry? I had a... family emergency?” he didn’t sound sure.
Blaise lowered the paper and stared at Draco. Draco thought his own face was a mirror to Blaise’s shocked expression.
“So Potter is really on the outs with the Weasley’s then?” Draco asked carefully, watching as Luna began pouring way too much honey into her porridge.
“Gay?” Pansy supplied helpfully, “but you like girls right?”
The people around them jumped back, away from the shower of ale and glass. Potter darted forwards with an enraged growl, his wand already twirling and slashing through the air. Howard’s wand was barely out of his pocket when it was ripped from his grasp and clattered across the pub floor.
While Draco was engaged with the others, out of the corner of his eye, he was watching Hermione and Potter. They were talking together, and Potter was smirking with pleased amusement while Hermione laughed at something he had said.
Lovegood laughed.
“Yep, that was his stupid way of asking you out Draco. Do you want to go out with him?”
Almost everyone turned surprised expressions on Tracey and Pansy.
“It looks like it’s not you that’s starting trouble, but it’s your choice Mr Malfoy. I’m just here to patch you students up, not to pass judgements.”
Draco met Beckett’s eyes and nodded.
She looked beseechingly at him, her eyes huge and sad like a moon calf.
“If you like I could teach you how to make it?” she asked.
“It’s like the Headmistress just said, we’re all adults. Grow up.”
“We’ve all made mistakes. Some of them bigger than others, but still mistakes. We’ve all done things because it’s what was expected, rather than what we wanted.” Potter continued quietly. He glanced at Weasley and Granger. She was watching him steadily, but Weasley looked away.
“What behaviour?” Potter asked indignantly.
Draco stood in the uncomfortable silence she left behind, desperately trying to conjure up the illusion that he was unconcerned with Potter’s presence. Potter didn’t look at him, but ran his fingers over the spines of the books on the shelf beside him.
“Depends on what?” Potter asked.
“Well I wish you wouldn’t. There are plenty of things I’m sure you need to atone for Draco, but I don’t count that as one of them,” she said matter-of-factly.
He sounded wrecked. When he looked up, Draco was looking into the face of a man who was lost. His heart constricted in his chest. It took all his self control to stay put and not rush across the room to gather Potter in his arms.
“Yes, well,” he continued, working to keep his voice calm and hide the panic that had been building for days now, “we should talk. In the common room after everyone is gone? Make a plan?” he stressed.
“Haven’t you heard, I’m not very nice. Anyway she started it,” he said petulantly.
“We didn’t?” asked Draco, surprised.
“I’m not ashamed baby, you should know better!” trilled Finnigan with a big grin. “There’s nothing wrong with a boy wanting to be Ginger Spice... although the Union Jack dress is offensive to my Irish body. My mammy would probably expire on the spot if she caught me in it.”
Draco would be impressed if it wasn’t so recklessly stupid. The Headmistress would skin them all alive if she caught on.
Now it was Saturday afternoon, the party was hours away, and Draco was lying on his stomach on Pansy’s bed while she held up dresses for his opinion. He was moodily resigned to the fact that he had to make an appearance at this party, but he secretly planned to hide in his room if things got too hectic. Who would miss him?
Pansy snorted into her tea.
Howard was weakly resisting the hold on him, blood still pouring from his nose, his gaze moving between Potter and the man with the camera.
“Haven’t they learned not to by now?”
Draco squeezed her hand, and Hermione met his gaze.
“You’ll have to ask him. On Saturday. In Hogsmeade.”
“You both clearly fancy the pants off each other, and you’re both single, how is that not simple?” he asked incredulously.
“Sooo, what do you think?” he asked her, shaking his head from side to side so his hair swished over his shoulders.
The bad news was that now they had to get over to Hospital Tower and up three flights of stairs. The good news was that Draco’s pain tolerance was a lot higher than it used to be, and he managed ok. Lovegood supported his left side, and he ignored the nauseating swoop of pain that shot up his leg with every step.
After twenty minutes with his eyes screwed shut, he sat up angrily. He wasn’t going back to sleep, and all he was doing was worrying about what was going to happen today. He still refused to get up, and instead pulled a thick volume from his bookshelf. He’d been meaning to do some in-depth research into the properties of gingko.
“It’s becoming increasingly obvious that isn’t the case. I’ve cut you a lot of slack so far this year. I trusted you to know what was best for you. You’ve earned the benefit of the doubt, but Harry,” she said gently, “I can’t continue to let this behaviour go unchallenged.”
Luna looked relieved he’d changed the subject. Pansy was frowning and looked like she had something she wanted to say, but Draco caught her eye and shook his head. She rolled her eyes and pouted.
Blaise laughed, clearly relishing the gossip no matter what he said to the contrary. Pansy looked incredulous, still shooting glances at Draco to judge how he was taking this earth shattering news. Draco’s mind had gone blank with shock as he tried to process what he’d just been told. Potter winking at him on the platform played in a loop behind his eyes, and the churning in his stomach could only be panic. Outwardly he tried to project a bored nonchalance and smiled along with Blaise’s amusement.
Draco was suddenly very aware that they were stood out on the street. He grabbed Potter’s arm and dragged him down a side alley between the restaurant and the cauldron shop next door.
He turned to leave, before turning back with a smug grin.
Weasley was pretending that he wasn’t ignoring Potter by talking to Longbottom, who looked very much like he’d rather be watching the drinking game. Granger had set up court on the sofas with Padma Patil and Lisa Turpin, talking animatedly with the Ravenclaw girls. Boot and Goldstein were raiding the snack table.
“Um hey? What subject did you want to cover today?” he asked uncertainly, shifting in his seat
“Teddy Lupin,” he said slowly, as though Draco were being deliberately dense, “Your cousin?”
Pansy turned and smacked Blaise hard across the back of the head, causing him to yelp and anxiously check his hair in the reflection of a knife.
Blaise talked enough about the evening for the both of them. He’d been up until dawn, refusing to let the fun end. Draco had to admire his party spirit. He’d ended the night by playing a game of strip exploding snap with Lisa Turpin, successfully achieving his goal of getting her top off... along with the rest of her clothes.
“It makes no difference to me.”
“Ewwwwww,” Brown groaned, looking horrified.
“Why did you want to know?” Daphne asked curiously, looking at the article with her chin on Theo's shoulder.
Potter was moving away from him now, fear and panic swirling in his eyes.
“Looks like you’ve managed to put together quite a queer convention here Granger.”
Patil looked up with startled eyes. Luna just nodded absently while she carried on writing her History of Magic essay in her loopy cursive. Granger turned her questioning gaze on Draco in exasperation.
He dumped his bag on the floor and laughed.
He seemed nervous. Twitchy.
Granger's brown eyes were wide, looking at him like she’d never seen him before.
The few stragglers left in the common room were the eighth years who planned to Apparate home from the village. They’d been able to enjoy a little lie in, and would be settled in at home before lunchtime. Draco’s stomach twisted a little, thinking about what Christmas used to mean to him. The parties at the Manor, and how happy his mother would be. She had loved Christmas.
Draco rolled his eyes as he buttered toast.
MacMillan refused to answer and looked beseechingly at Turpin.
They rounded a corner into a quiet study area, and Luna paused, her head slightly tilted. Draco looked across the tables and saw Granger and Ravenclaw Patil diligently working away together with a mound of books between them. Luna glanced at him, and then made her way over to the two girls, with Draco following silently behind her.
On Friday evening Luna came over to the eighth year table to have dinner with him. She didn’t say anything, but he knew that she knew what his weekend plans were going to involve. She talked about the latest edition of The Quibbler, and he leaned against her side. He wondered when it was that he’d started to rely on her calming presence so much.
“Thank you all. Now, it is my hope that we will discover ourselves to be stronger and more united than we have ever been. This is our chance at a new beginning, and to embrace all the hope and joy the future may hold. It is my wish that we all move forwards together from this point, with open minds and hearts.
“I’m also very gay,” Draco murmured.
Potter stared Howard down coolly. Draco had expected him to protest the accusation, but Potter didn’t seem to care if people thought that about them. Draco wasn’t sure if he should be offended or not.
Pansy shifted uncomfortably.
“Know what?” he asked quietly.
He stared up at her blankly. She sighed again, putting her hands on her hips and frowning.
Draco saw a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye, and turned to see a beefy, red faced man bearing down on them.
“Yep,” he said cheerfully.
A shoulder bumped his and he looked up. Potter stood next to him, his back to the bar, facing the room. He leaned his elbows back to prop himself against the bar top.
Pansy was very pink in the face as she huffed, also noticing the stairs.
She looked at him warily.
“Never have I ever been held down by my own father and forced to get a Dark Mark against my will...” she said heatedly.
Justin chuckled.
Boot rallied and changed tact, grabbing Draco’s chin roughly and forcing his head down to Boot's eye level.
He covered his eyes, and then reached up to start unpicking all his handiwork.
He tasted like crème brûlée.
Drinking and a teeny tiny mention of past drug use in this chapter.
He stopped a little away from Draco, swaying even while standing still.
Draco leaned against the wall for support while Lovegood began to twist her hands in her jumper.
He was halfway down the hall and still hadn’t spotted his name or Potter’s. His heart beat furiously as he eyed the last 2 doors. On his left was a closed door with the names “Harry Potter" and “Theodore Nott". He couldn’t believe how utterly disappointed he suddenly felt. Only a moment before his insides had been writhing with panic at the idea of sharing a room with Potter all year. Now he was faced with that not being the case, and he was dejected. His mood dropped further still when he turned to the last door and saw the names “Draco Malfoy” and “Justin Finch-Fletchley”.
“I don’t know about everyone else here, but I’m not comfortable sharing a room with Slytherin’s and Death Eaters.” He glared at Draco.
Justin squeaked, his hands trembling as he drank. Draco shot a dark look at MacMillan. This seemed like a much bigger secret to spill, and MacMillan looked as if he was realising that as Weasley’s face got redder.
She smiled.
“George,” he clarified.
Potter slumped in his chair, watching Draco thoughtfully. After a few minutes of silence he sighed, rubbed his eyes in apparent irritation, and left the table without saying goodbye.
“What the fuck?” Weasley demanded.
Blaise sloped off towards the record player to convince Justin to turn down the volume and Draco knew that games were afoot. The ball game seemed to have ended, a few people were still swaying around to the music but most had gathered near the fire. Potter was smoking over by the windows with Finnigan and Thomas.
It wasn’t long before the peace was disrupted when Blaise came rushing back into the carriage. There was a familiar gleam in his dark eyes. He had gossip.
“We go around the circle one at a time, and you say ‘never have I ever’ before saying something you’ve never done. If anyone here HAS done it, they have to drink. Get it?” Tracey answered excitedly, grinning.
“This morning Theo woke me up at an unreasonable hour, crashing around like a wounded manticore because he’d forgotten to pack,” Potter began, gesticulating wildly in what Draco assumed was an impression of said manticore.
“She wasn’t a secret. It wasn’t like she was some demented love child they kept in the attic. She was disowned, and it was long before any of us were born. I’m sure by the time we were old enough to notice gossip she was beyond old news. Of course we never heard about it.”
“Leave it alone Howard, you great idiot,” another man at the bar said to the beefy man with a grimace.
He gestured to the pictures on the wall behind him. Draco guessed that was the band who was singing. He rubbed his arms uneasily.
Weasley went red again, and Granger looked away guiltily.
As soon as Potter’s weight left Howard’s chest, he reared up, and kicked out. His foot caught Draco, who let go of Potter and went tumbling to the floor. His hand came down on a big shard of glass, which sliced his palm and he hissed in pain. Before he could move, his vision burst with stars and his head exploded in agony. Howard had struggled to his feet, his nose bloody and broken, and kicked Draco in the side of the head, sending him rolling across the floor.
“Ravenclaw Patil was all over this,” she cackled, waving her hand to indicate her whole body.
Potter seemed distracted by the gesture.
Before the sound of “Immobulus” even registered, Draco was frozen. Then he was blasted backwards until his back hit the stone corridor wall, pain exploding up his spine. Pain was nothing new for Draco, but a hiss still escaped his lips. He teetered against the wall, unable to catch himself from falling while he was frozen, but a big hand flashed out to hold him still and he was looking down into Boot’s face. For once he’s not angry. He’s gleeful.
They walked to the Great Hall in silence. He trotted along beside her, shortening his long strides to keep to her pace, and tried to contain his small internal panic about what this meant.
Draco realised just how tall Lovegood was for a girl. With her silver grey eyes, platinum hair and fine bone structure, they almost looked like twins. They were both looking down at the redhead, who was looking sweaty in quiddich robes. He spotted the gleaming silver Captain’s badge twinkling on her chest.
She blinked at him.
“Well, no. I’m assuming they are a muggle band? I’m not really familiar with a lot of muggle music.”
“Blasting spell of some sort I think Madam Pomfrey. I found him on the floor at the bottom of the back stairs by the library, and obviously his leg is broken. You might want to check for a concussion too, and who knows what else,” reported Lovegood efficiently.
“Not lately,” he replied coolly.
“I can’t just stop, it won’t be enough! I’ve done too much damage. The rumours are everywhere. People will just keep talking, even if I take a public vow of chastity. The only way to clear up all this mess is to point the gossip at something else, get them talking about something better,” he muttered sullenly, “Like a steady relationship... Just until the end of the school year.”
The letter he had been meaning to write was to tell her that he didn’t want to come home for Christmas. He planned to stay at Hogwarts, for the first time in his life.
“He was provoked,” Draco burst out.
“Mother is going to get married again,” he said in a bored voice, gently stroking a finger over Nyx's inky feathers. She clicked her orange beak happily.
He tried to imagine how he would have reacted if the roles were reversed. If he had had to tell his parents, at age eleven, that he wasn’t a wizard. That he wouldn’t be going to Hogwarts, and everything they knew to be true just wasn’t. He couldn’t fathom it.
“Sort of. She wanted me to just ask you for your help out right. I thought it would be a better idea if we tried the whole date thing...” he said awkwardly.
Justin sat up and grinned.
“I only recently found out. Mum was a Ravenclaw, an extraordinary witch, a free thinker, and she had a lot of ideas and opinions which were not in line with the Malfoy way of thinking. She was disowned by the family before she had even finished Hogwarts, and that was long before she married my half-blood dad. They never mentioned her again. Your father told me himself, when I was... a guest in your house.”
Hermione smiled hopefully.
“By all means,” he chuckled when he could breathe again, wiping his eyes.
His body had filled out. He no longer looked underfed, he was now leanly muscled and solid. His ripped jeans and simple black vest did little to hide his figure. His exposed bicep bulged as he bought the cigarette he was holding to his lips. Draco’s eyes widened as he registered that Potter had painted his fingernails in rainbow colours, and the dark copper skin of his arms was patterned with intricate black tattoo’s.
At first it was his fame. Draco had grown up hearing the story of how Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord. That every witch and wizard knew his name. That he was a hero. As a small boy, Draco had gone on adventures with his imaginary best friend Harry Potter.
He believed that his mother loved him. He wanted to believe that everything she had done had been out of a misguided belief that she was doing the right thing. The problem was that every step Draco had taken away from everything he had been raised to believe, the more withdrawn his mother had become.
Blaise planted his palms on the table top and assessed the group. He grinned.
“So,” Potter said after a moment, shifting and biting his lip, “I wanted... errrrm... I wanted to say sorry about last Friday?”
He glanced around the room, then squinted up at the shelf of wooden figurines.
“Um... thank you, that would be really useful.”
He leaned back, his head falling over the back of the sofa, and let his eyes slip closed for a second. He was tired.
“I’m really sorry,” Potter continued, as he sat down opposite Draco.
Draco sat up gingerly, trying not to wince. His whole torso ached, front to back. His head throbbed, and he put a hand up to prod at a good sized lump forming at his temple. His hair was loose, so he tilted his head forwards letting it swing to cover his face and hide him from Blaise’s close scrutiny.
While the ink dried he got dressed, wrapping up warm. He might as well send the letter right away before he changed his mind, or tried to rewrite it again.
“I highly doubt that Harry will ever be interested in politics,” she scoffed.
“Sure, of course,” he said, scrambling up to follow her.
Finch-Fletchley, it seemed, was an endless fountain of chatter. It was almost impressive. Draco didn’t think he drew breath once as they made their way through the castle.
“That would be lovely Cousin,” replied Draco, indicating the empty spot beside him.
Potter laughed meanly.
“The deal is off Potter,” Draco said softly, fidgeting with the cuffs of his jumper.
She didn’t seem inclined to move just yet so he stroked her back like he used to. He felt very peaceful and drowsy.
Draco stared at him with his mouth open in horror. He gulped.
“Do you mind if we don’t?” he asked slowly.
“Fine, if you want a plan so badly, we’ll think of something good on Saturday. You worry too much you know.”
“I’ll do it,” said Draco simply, shrugging, “I’ll help you.”
“No, it is. After the battle, I think we were all in shock. Harry had held it together for so long, and he just slept for days. The Weasley’s were in pieces without Fred, and I... I left. I went to Australia,” her eyes were glazed, lost in memories.
He shook himself and tugged on a long sleeved cotton top, before sliding back into bed. He really was exhausted. He lay down, shifting onto his side to take the pressure off his back, and tried to forget about everything. It was hours before he drifted into fitful sleep.
He batted her off him and pointed to the empty chair next to him, but she waved him away and wandered off to get herself a cup of tea. She returned with two mugs and handed one to him, then she settled in the chair, folding one leg underneath herself and leaning forward to rest her elbows on the table. If her mother could see her she’d have a heart attack. She sipped her tea and looked at him pointedly.
“I just thought that, of my friends, you would understand best,” he whispered.
Draco stilled and Pansy huffed a quiet laugh beside him. He was beyond confused. He hadn’t thought he’d been giving off those sorts of signals.
“Oooooh it’s like tha is it Potter? Givin’ it te Malfoy junior?” he taunted.
He was still trying to figure out why ten minutes later when Hermione arrived. She grinned at him as she settled into the chair Potter had just sat in. She was looking at him expectantly.
“What? I mean, yes, he spoke to me, but... I’m confused,” he confessed helplessly.
“Don’t worry Blaise, I’m not counting you. I know you don’t care about anyone but yourself.”
Pansy sniffed.
He looked down at the exposed mark on his chest, biting his lip, but she had already guessed about the spell, so he didn’t think there was any point trying to hide it.
“Hermione and Luna were so worried about you,” Justin said softly, “Hermione went to talk to Madam Rosmerta for ages, and Blaise gave her some money to cover any damages. He said you owe him.”
“There’s going to be another party on Halloween. It’s next Saturday .”
“I fail to see how that’s my fault,” Draco replied, pouring himself more coffee.
“That’s actually really helpful,” he found himself saying out loud. He knew he must be flushed with embarrassment.
“You know I would though right?”
He was debating with himself whether to ask Padma about Pansy, while he was making his way to the library for a study session. He wended his way through the shelves, heading towards their now regular table. Just as he was about to round the corner which would open out into the study area they liked, he heard two hushed, harried voices, and he paused to listen.
“Sure, whatever,” he said darkly.
“Are we drinking?” he asked lightly, flicking through the pages. There was more wine on offer than there was food.
And he was off, chatting animatedly about this band of five girls. Draco could barely keep up with him, as he started to unpack his clothes and hang them in the wardrobe with a few waves of his wand. He then set about charming the wrinkles out of his shirts and trousers. Finch-Fletchley had moved to his own trunk and was hurling balls of socks across the room towards his draws by hand, still talking a mile a minute. Draco tried to make sense of the words he couldn’t understand like “MTV" and “music video", but he was mostly grateful for Finch-Fletchley’s good natured manners. Maybe McGonagall did know what she was doing after all. At some point the record came to an end, and Finch-Fletchley went to flip it over to play the B side.
“It really isn’t any of your business Ron,” he said stiffly.
“Come along then chaps. We’d best get a move on now we all have to live in a tower like blasted owls.”
Draco flinched, shocked.
Draco looked around and saw Hermione waving at him from the corner, where she had claimed one of the bigger booths. He waved back, then turned to help Pansy out of her cloak.
Draco grinned. He didn’t realise Justin had a wicked side.
“I’m just really feeling this grungy butch vibe you’ve got going on. You should consider a haircut to complete the look.”
Pansy met Draco’s eyes and smiled wickedly.
It was impossible to reconcile this commanding man, who spoke with so much authority, with the boy who had not an hour before been doing shots during the Sorting.
“Oh joy,” Draco said dryly.
Draco frowned, contemplating that.
“That you were gay?” There. He said it.
They both posed in front of the mirror on the back of the door, laughing at their own ridiculousness.
“Lavender Brown? Badass face scars? Squeaky voice? Practically magically bonded to your sister at the hip? That Lavender,” he said, sitting up on the bed, still grinning broadly.
“Aren’t you freezing?” Draco whispered to him, before he could stop himself.
“Aren’t you having anything?” he asked sceptically.
“We’ll talk again before I leave on Saturday,” she promised.
Justin sighed, sitting back against his pillows and looking up at his curtains, his face angelic in the lamp light.
Draco twitched so violently he nearly fell into the shelves again. He turned a hard expression on her.
Pansy and Draco both jumped and looked over at him, startled by his outburst.
“Are you OK?” Justin breathed, his voice lower than a whisper.
The track changed on the record player. He looked back at Finch-Fletchley, who was still watching him carefully, as though expecting him to loose his temper at any moment .
“Ummm... I had a head start on the Arithmancy questions?” he guessed, wracking his brain for what she could mean. Why was everyone acting so oddly today?
“I don’t know what to do. His grades have dropped, he misses half his classes, he barely does any homework, and I’m pretty sure he turned up to Defence the other day drunk! Professor Beckett definitely noticed, and I think he’s reporting back to Kingsley about him. He’s going to fail all his NEWTs and he doesn’t even care!”
She put an hand on his arm to stop him from walking.
He paused, then met Draco’s gaze, his eyes a storm of desperation.
Draco smiled, but inside he felt his anxiety swell again. Being himself around Harry Potter was never something he’d been good at. With all the progress he’d made so far this year opening up to new people, Potter was the one person who really scared him. In a good way or a bad way, he couldn’t tell yet, but it would take a lot for him to be able to relax around Potter.
Draco bit his lip to hold in a laugh. He started to translate the menu out loud, running down the short list of items. Raphael hadn’t updated the menu much since the last time Draco had been here. He clearly knew what his patrons liked.
“I just can’t do this. I can’t put effort into something if you can’t even be bothered to show up.”
“Hermione made me come help you,” he said dryly.
She looked deeply disappointed. Draco felt tingly.
“There’s not much to tell... we’ve barely spoken to each other. He sort of asked me out on Wednesday, and Hermione has kind of set us up I think? I’m still confused about everything, and I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t sure how you felt about Potter?”
“Ummmm Hermione? Are you really asking me out in front of your boyfriend? Because I’m flattered, but I really don’t... I mean I’m...” he stuttered.
“She’s your what?” shrieked Pansy at breakfast.
She shuddered. Draco swivelled his head around to stare up at her in mock horror.
“What the fuck Pans?”
“Leg all fixed?”
“Enter,” called the unmistakable voice of Headmistress McGonagall.
Weirdly, Potter relaxed just a little. Draco hadn’t expected to have any impact on him, but his taut frame loosened, and his breathing slowed. His eyes darted towards Draco, taking in his panicked face, and his expression became serious.
“They gave you a hard time about him?” He didn’t need to say who he meant.
It ranged from hisses and mutters of “Death Eater”, and worse, in the hallways between classes, to physical torment. Draco decided that whoever had invented the stinging jinx was an irredeemable monster. He’d end each day covered in burning welts no matter what he did. He’d repaired his book bag so many times from well aimed severing charms that it was practically threadbare. His knees were bruised from hitting the stone floor so often, stumbling over tripping jinxes wherever he went.
“I should have done SOMETHING,” he cried, “you may not blame me, but I blame myself.”
Draco prodded his dinner and thought about what he’d said to Granger. Who could he be?
“I won’t, stop panicking,” Potter snickered.
“You know most whores at least get a percentage,” he continued grumpily.
He was free.
Draco stumbled forwards, unsure of what to do, his heart pounding mercilessly.
I need somebody with a human touuuuuch,
“I...” he began.
“I’m not being arrested?” he gasped, needing to be sure of what was happening.
“Are you sure that they’re...?” Pansy began to ask uncertainly, but Blaise cut her off with a snort of derision.
Draco bit his tongue to keep from asking Potter what family he could mean. That was probably rude, and he’d been trying so hard lately to not be rude.
Draco burst out laughing at the guilty expression on Justin’s face. He kept laughing until he was shaking, and he didn’t know anymore if he was laughing or crying.
This was all wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong because Draco realised just how much he wanted this. How much he wanted Potter, but Potter was drunk, and Draco was just a warm body. Potter probably didn’t know what he was doing, and would be horrified in the morning.
The loud blast knocked the air out of his lungs. Time seemed to slow as he felt himself skid backwards and over the top of the stairs. He wrapped his arms around his head to protect himself as he slammed down the stone staircase, rolling, and finally crashing into the wall at the bottom. He was sprawled out on the floor, panting and aching, waiting for the following footsteps to see if it was going to carry on. It was quiet. He dragged his head up and saw the upstairs landing was deserted. His chest was burning from the impact of the spell. It hadn’t been very strong. Used by a more powerful magical caster that spell could be deadly, but he hardly felt lucky at the moment. He felt dizzy. A little spaced out.
“I asked you, I should pay,” his shot back, his expression taking on that stubborn edge.
“You do realise we’re all of age. You could literally get drunk any time you liked. I don’t know why everyone gets so excited about parties,” he said sourly.
Pansy was very tense behind Draco, her leg twitching excitedly, but he couldn’t focus on her as he was forced to drink.
“I sort of have a maybe date with Potter this afternoon?”
Then Potter tripped over his feet, catching himself on the wall.
She sighed.
He looked back at her steadily.
“Those are just for light reading.”
Immediately his chest loosened and he felt a coolness rushing through his body, relaxing his muscles, and slowing his breath. As he began to breathe normally Madam Pomfrey brushed a gentle hand across his forehead.
“Never have I ever cheated on someone,” he said simply.
Everyone looked from her to Draco with wide eyes.
Once Draco was happy with his clothes, he stacked his books on the bookshelf next to his desk. He organised his school books by subject and then by relevance. On the bottom shelves he arranged the extra books he’d brought from home, making sure his favourites were the most accessible from the desk, and organising the rest by how interesting he thought they were. He had been so absorbed by his task that when he was done he looked around and realised the room had gone quiet. Finch-Fletchley was in bed, lying on his stomach and watching Draco with grin on his face.
He made it to the top of the stairs.
Draco had no idea what that meant. He looked between them, but neither of them seemed inclined to elaborate.
“Don’t be silly. Madam Pomfrey will fix you up and you’ll be right as rain... and then you can tell me what happened.” There was a surprising steeliness to her voice that brokered no argument, and Draco really didn’t have the energy right now to try.
He tried to sound innocent but Pansy narrowed her eyes at him.
“You don’t have to be a martyr Draco. I’m impressed that you’re admitting you were wrong. When I heard you’d chosen to come back to school, I kind of thought you were just going to try to pretend nothing had happened.”
Hermione stared hard at him for a moment, her hand still reached out, and then her eyes dropped to where he was holding his arm against his middle. She sighed softly.
A victorious grin flashed across Howard’s face, and he threw down the drink he was holding to draw his wand.
“You know I’m rubbish at silencing charms,” Blaise mumbled into his coffee cup.
Draco looked up, surprised but a little relieved.
The world seemed oddly muted and dim. Every window showed the same shockingly white downpour.
“Darling, you look fabulous. Blaise is making cocktails!” Pansy cried when he approached.
The books. He loved the books.
Justin and Pansy were waiting for him in his dorm room. Pansy was curled up on his bed, and Justin was pacing around the room, his face pinched with worry.
Draco sighed.
“So you’re backing out because I was late one time?” Potter huffed in exasperation.
He groaned. Feeling was coming back as his head cleared a bit, and the pain in his leg was suddenly excruciating. He looked down and saw that his foot looked like it had been put on the wrong way around.
“I thought we established that was off the table in fourth year? You’re gay?” he said, confused.
She was wearing a short sleeveless teal dress, with orange tights and silver trainers, and at least 6 different necklaces, one of which appeared to be made of butterbeer bottle caps. Her hair was pulled to the side into a fishtail plait that he was enormously jealous of. She had threaded strands of silver through it. She smiled at him gently. At her side, Girl Weasley stood scowling up at him. She had worn baggy cargo trousers, tucked into combat boots, and a tight black crop top under an open grey plaid shirt, displaying her impressively defined stomach.
“Stop feeling guilty about Potter, and just talk to him about anything else besides Weasley or what you think about his current choices. You’re the Golden Trio, nothing can break you apart for long!” Draco tried to sound positive.
Potter shifted uneasily.
“Also... Hermione suggested it. She was pretty insistent, and if she thinks you’re a good idea, I’m not arguing. She’s only just started speaking to me again.”
He looked back up at Draco, his eyes wide.
“I don’t know... maybe you’ve been playing a long con this term?” he said, his voice trembling.
Under the headline was a grainy photo of Potter looking shifty outside a building Draco didn’t recognise. From the flashing signs behind Potter, he guessed it was a club of some sort.
Howard’s expression was uncertain now, standing wandless against Potter, but he was still a big man. He didn’t look like he wanted to back down. A blue flash from Potter’s wand had Howard soaring backwards into a wooden pillar, which shuddered violently. Another flick of Potter’s wand, and Howard was jerked forwards and into the air by his feet, before he went crashing down to the floor.
He punched Draco hard in the stomach, and Draco couldn’t even fold into the pain so the air was just forced out of his lungs in a gasp. He couldn’t get any more back in and he wheezed. He couldn’t believe he had let his guard down just because he felt comfortable being back at school. Of course he was still in danger here. As he got some air back in shallow pants, he waited for Boot to make his point and stared him down calmly.
“I’ll be back if there are any more updates.” He winked and sauntered out of the carriage.
He was almost ready when Finch-Fletchley bounded back into the room fully dressed, his curls pulled back from his face with a row of small sparkling clips.
“Off to bed with you Draco,” McGonagall said softly.
“Thank you for the drinks Draco,” she said softly, fishing a cherry out of her glass, “I’m saving my money for travelling after school finishes.”
He could do this. It was the right thing to do.
Draco frowned, mystified by the conversation so far.
Draco had barely turned away, when a large hand came down on his shoulder, gripping firmly. His stomach lurched as he looked back at Beckett.
Draco smacked his hands away.
His father was locked away.
“Everybody can fuck off,” said Justin cheerfully, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
I love Luna ~Kisses~
Potter rolled his eyes.
Draco was very aware that Pansy was looking at him. He wished she wouldn’t. She knew him too well.
Draco had thought about it a lot, and he really wanted to make things right with Granger. Even if he could just give her some sort of closure, he wasn’t expecting anything back. Obviously the Slytherin in him knew it would be in his best interest to get her public forgiveness, but he’d done a lot of work to beat that side of his Slytherin nature down. Looking at her without the shit coloured glasses of bigotry on, he realised he actually liked her.
Pansy nudged Draco, who looked up and realised it was his turn. He racked his brains quickly.
“No no no no no yes, I’m very gay, I just mean hypothetically if kissing was a thing we would do, would you be ashamed of me?” Pansy seemed angry that he wasn’t following her drunk logic.
“Technically I didn’t,” said Justin sweetly, and everyone fell about laughing.
“What if it’s too late?” Granger mumbled, her voice so muffled that he barely heard her.
Her face softened and she sighed.
“Ah, ignore him Granger. You absolutely have to have at least one,” insisted Blaise.
“Great. Does everyone have drinks?” Blaise checked looking around.
Potter winced.
“Can I invite Justin?” he asked with sudden inspiration.
Time seemed to slow as Potter ground to a halt. Draco’s breathing was very loud in his own ears as Potter’s face went completely blank. The expression was even more terrifying than seeing his rage. His eyes sparked with a furious fire, and he turned slowly to face Howard, pulling free from Draco’s weak grip.
Out of the crowd marched Professor McDonald and Professor Beckett. McDonald had her wand out, pointed at the frozen men, her eyes flashing dangerously. Beckett was dragging the man with the camera by the collar. Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
Draco snorted, then clapped his hand over his mouth, flushing. Potter smiled sheepishly.
She looked up at him then.
“Didn’t Harry talk to you? He said he was going to, and I told him where you would probably be.”
“Smilin’, dancin’, everything is free...”
Justin had a hundred questions when he got back on Saturday, none of which Draco knew how to answer. What WAS he going to tell his friends? Hermione already knew, and he suspected that Luna might. They were the only people Potter really trusted. He’d have to tell Justin and Pansy, probably Blaise too. He couldn’t lie to them, but he wasn’t quite ready to say anything yet.
On Thursday evening they had taken a walk around the lake after dinner, and Luna had told him stories about her mother and her experiments with magic. She had written to her father to ask him to send some photographs, and she proudly showed them to Draco. Luna did look very similar to her mother, and Draco could see even more Malfoy resemblance in Pandora's face. She was softer than his father, and her eyes were wonderfully kind.
Draco noticed Blaise, Tracey, and Gryffindor Patil all drinking sheepishly.
“Ex Death Eater I should hope.”
The Hungry Horntail was like most places in Hogsmeade. It was on the small side, with rustic features, and a low ceiling with exposed wooden beams. It still managed to appear open and airy, with plenty of natural light, and the walls were painted a very pale duck egg blue. The honey coloured wooden tables were simple but laid prettily with blue cloth napkins and tiny vases of fresh daisies.
“What happened after we left?” he asked, when he was finished.
Not that he thought his father would make up something like that, but he couldn’t think why his father had broken his eighteen plus years of silence to talk about his disowned sister.
“You know,” Draco elaborated, blushing slightly, “the whole train thing?”
Draco sneered at him, but there was another pop of a spell and Draco hit the ground before everything faded to blackness.
He growled under his breath as they drew near him.
A few more people turned to look angrily at Boot, who seemed unsure of himself now he’d lost a bit of his high ground.
“Everyone else is leaving on Saturday,” he began, and Potter finally looked up at him.
When he looked up Finch-Fletchley had turned to grin at him, an unusual expression for someone about to tell him to piss off. Maybe this had just been a joke at Draco’s expense the whole time.
“Don’t scare me like that darling,” she whispered.
“Finally, Mary McDonald will be taking over as Transfiguration professor. She will also be the new Gryffindor Head of House.” The Gryffindor’s clapped loudly at this news, as the beautiful woman beside McGonagall grinned over at the rowdy table of students she was now in charge of.
“Didn’t he ask you out on a date?” she asked slowly.
Idiot.
Potter snorted. The Minister’s deep frown made Draco flinch, and it wasn’t even directed at him.
Everyone was quiet. Weasley looked away.
“So, have you finished the Charms homework yet?” she asked, all business again.
“Pandora Lovegood was once Pandora Malfoy,” he elaborated. “My father’s older sister and life long free spirit. Disowned, never spoken of again blah blah blah etc.”
He tried to carry on reading, but when he realised he could have walked down to Hogsmeade with Pansy, and come back by now, if he’d known Potter was going to be this late, he started to get pissed off.
“What was all that about with Parkinson earlier?” she asked simply.
Draco stared at him in shock.
He glanced up at the sound, and gave a soft gasp of surprise when he saw Potter stood on the other side of the table, watching him self-consciously. His hands were stuffed deep in his trouser pockets, and he rocked back a little on his heels when Draco met his gaze.
Longbottom nodded.
Justin looked away but Draco still caught the brief flash of disappointment that crossed his face. When was he going to give up on Blaise?
She nodded.
“If the slutty shoe fits,” she replied viciously.
She looked down at her lap, biting her lip.
“Why did you have to ruin it,” she sighed, sliding off the arm of the chair and into his lap to hug him.
She didn’t look around as he approached, but the way her head tilted told him she knew he was there. He stood and watched the sky go dark, and the first few stars wink into the navy sky. The lamps in the library grew steadily brighter until Draco could no longer see the night sky though the window, but Grangers unhappy face reflected in the glass, and himself ghostly behind her. She met his eyes in the reflection, and tried for a small smile, before she turned her head and buried her face in her hands.
Draco snorted.
“Why does he want to go out with me?” he asked faintly.
She held up two more little vials, one with a pink liquid and one with a sludgy green concoction. She handed him the green one first. He gagged a little as he drank it, it was bitter and had a thick, gritty texture. The pink one was next, and he spluttered into a coughing fit. It burned going down and tasted like metal.
It was a fluff piece about Potter’s love life. Draco had no idea how they had managed to fill up 2 pages, when as far as he knew Potter had only ever dated Girl Weasley. Now he was having not-so-secret trysts with Finch-Fletchley in a toilet. Draco began to laugh along with Pansy, until they were both holding each other up, tears streaming down their faces. It wasn’t even that funny, but all the built up stress of the morning needed an outlet it seemed.
“Are those... dragons?” he asked sceptically.
She helped him into a soft hospital robe, and into the bed. Then she whisked away around the curtain. He sat for a moment by himself, and the reality of the afternoon came crashing over him. By the time Madam Pomfrey returned with a tray full of little bottles a few minutes later, he had worked himself up into such a state that he was hyperventilating. She calmly placed the tray down on the table beside the bed, picked up a small vial of milky liquid, and pushed it into his hand.
“I’m sorry Pans,” he mumbled through his fingers, “the thought of a party with all these people who hate me... just makes me testy.”
It was so crowded that most of the furniture had been shrunk down and stored away in a shoe box. People were standing in groups on the stairs. Draco had seen a girl almost fall into the fire because she’d tried to sit on the hearth.
Draco felt his face flush crimson, his cheeks warm. He stuttered.
Draco felt mentally exhausted, but he shrugged.
“That money... was just for one month?” she gasped weakly.
Blaise put down a big pitcher of his blue concoction, then lined up a row of Fire Whisky shots. They all took one.
“Why did you want to know old boy?” he asked curiously.
The waiter thankfully arrived, smiling politely.
He felt the sofa shift as someone thumped down into the seat beside him. He slanted his head to the side and opened his eyes to see who it was. He froze.
“I know you don’t believe he’s changed, but I know he has. His aura is changing,” said Lovegood simply, as though it was obvious. Draco shifted uncomfortably. Were they talking about him or somebody else?
Pansy hummed, thinking.
Draco looked down at his notes. He was uncomfortable. He wasn’t used to telling people how he really felt about anything.
He nodded, and left as quickly as he could without running. He heard Potter start shouting as he reached the bottom of the stairs.
“We’re all having a perfectly lovely breakfast. Don’t come in here trying to use your feminine wiles to exploit nice people just because you’re too lazy to practice a spell. I know you think it’s beneath you to try at something that you’re not instantly good at, but a tiny bit of effort isn’t going to ruin your hair.”
“If anyone needs to Spice up their life it’s you Malfoy! The Spice Girls are positively a sensation. I have both of their albums.”
For as long as he could remember, he’d been obsessed with Harry Potter.
“I haven’t seen Harry all day, but I don’t think so. Most people seem to be more annoyed that she had a go at McGonagall.”
Potter stumbled a few steps and Draco let go of him. The loss of the warmth of Potter’s fingers on his skin made his heart ache. The hungry, heated expression on Potter’s face melted into confusion.
Potter sighed as he downed his drink.
“Ah, young Edward, yes,” he mumbled.
A brief look of panic crossed Potter’s face, before he suddenly surged towards Draco. Before he could react, Potter grabbed the front of his coat and pulled him down, sealing their lips together in a frantic kiss that shut down Draco’s entire being.
“Don’t fucking lie to me Draco!” Pansy hissed at him, slamming down her mug. “Do you know how hard you would have had to hit the floor to knock yourself unconscious? You’re tall but you’re not tall enough to defy the laws of nature! Just tell me who it was. If you keep lying to me I bet I could make a pretty good guess and start some shit.”
“When the war ended I offered you the opportunity to take any entry level position into the ministry you wanted, including the Auror training programme. You chose to complete your education, which is commendable of you, but higher learning does not seem to be your primary focus. The Ministry cannot be seen to condone this kind of behaviour Harry. People are still scared. The wizarding community needs consistency right now. Stability. Whether you like it or not you are a public figure, and people look to you for guidance.”
He twisted, trying to free himself, but the Gryffindor kicked out at his legs and he lost his balance, falling to his knees, letting out a whimper at the impact. He was precariously close to the top of the stairs.
“Not now darling! Tomorrow night.”
Pansy was disappointed that Patil had refused to speak to her since the party, but she was dealing with it in a typically Pansy way. Pretending she didn’t care. She brushed it off whenever Draco tried to discuss it with her, or deflected by asking pointed questions about where Draco had disappeared to so early in the evening. He deflected right back, so they were in a sort of stalemate about the whole thing.
Potter took a few steps forward, stumbled, and reached out to grab hold of Draco to steady himself. Draco automatically put his hand on Potter’s hip, and Potter stepped even closer, sliding his hands down onto Draco’s waist.
“I thought it was painfully obvious. I’ll have to hand in my queer card for the shame of it,” she mumbled into her hands.
“Be that as it may, his plan should not have succeeded. You know very well Mr. Malfoy, how easily Mr. Potter is provoked, however you are no longer children. Something like petty words should not have caused an all out brawl,” she said tiredly.
“I’m not really an expert. I think as long as you’re publicly hanging out a lot, that should be enough. Maybe some light PDA, but nothing you’re uncomfortable with? I bet you’ve been overthinking it,” she said softly.
Justin twirled as the Spice Girls began to “la la la” enthusiastically. Draco chuckled to himself behind the wardrobe door, and then, with perfect timing, he spun out into the room.
“And how did this little get together come about?” She waved a finger to indicate the three of them, “Don’t tell me you’ve finally learned how to make friends darling?”
“Are you free on Friday evening?” she asked.
Blaise sighed and downed his coffee.
They all laughed at that.
Her smug expression fell as she flushed and looked away.
The Gryffindor boy looked unsure for a second, but then he steeled himself, brandishing his wand.
There was a much larger crop of children starting Hogwarts this year. It seemed a few wizarding families had chosen not to send their children to school last year, and no muggleborns had received a letter for obvious reasons. McGonagall had decided to start them all together, and the Sorting Ceremony was taking forever. Draco was starving, but he still clapped politely as each terrified new Slytherin joined the table.
“It’s just... OK, so, Cho made me go there on a date in fifth year and it was so awful. It was Valentine’s day, and she was always getting upset about Cedric. Obviously back then I didn’t realise why the whole thing made me so uncomfortable. So I guess it has bad connotations for me? Plus have you seen it? It’s so ugly and frilly in there!” he ended emphatically.
“Who do you think talked?” asked MacMillan.
“I thought the shock might catch up with you. You were doing astonishingly well to stay conscious with the injuries you have. You have a small bit of internal bleeding, but these will sort that out.”
Draco pulled himself to his feet, cradling his pounding head in his hand. He’d forgotten about the gash on his palm, and left a bloody smear through his hair and down the side of his face. Pansy whimpered, and wrapped an arm around him.
It was late November when things started to change.
He dithered around the common room a little longer, and then he marched up the stairs to the dorm rooms.
“Yes, I do. You’ll never know if you don’t try.”
After a little while he wandered over to the bookshelves and picked out something interesting. He went back to his chair and settled back down. He wasn’t too worried, he’d expected Potter to be late after all.
“Are you SURE you don’t want to come home with me? I know it’s not much of an offer, but Blaise will probably be there all the time, to get away from his mother’s new fiancé,” she repeated for probably the fiftieth time that week.
He let a mean smirk quirk up the corners of his lips.
By twelve forty-five he was outside the restaurant, dithering about whether he should go in and get a table, or stay outside.
“Can I at least explain what happened?” Potter countered, looking pained.
Lovegood frowned at him.
The cosy common room felt empty when they had all left together, clattering down the stairs.
“Are you supposed to be somewhere now? I could run and tell someone where you are once we’re at the hospital wing?”
He didn’t bother talking back any more. None of them listened to reason.
“You just said you had to say something you’ve never done.”
He wrapped an arm around her, and held out the other arm for Justin, who still looked on edge. Justin jumped up on the bed and twisted against Draco’s side.
Potter was flushed and he stuttered.
Later, up in his room, Draco hummed along to the now familiar voices of the Spice Girls. He’d learned all their names, and nearly all the words to ‘Viva Forever'. Justin had disappeared to the bathroom, so Draco quickly got changed. His skin was looking better already with the ointment Madam Pomfrey had given him, but still might raise questions.
“Don’t say that, you know it’s not like that,” she smiled uncertainly, but her eyes were still worried.
“If I like? We need to decide how we’re going to do this Potter. You can’t just stand up in the Great Hall and shout ‘I’m dating Draco Malfoy now, someone call the press!’”
“Do grindylow's drink?” Luna asked the table vaguely.
Draco bit his tongue to keep from snapping at him. This was Potter’s stupid scheme after all, why wasn’t he doing anything about it?
“Have you come dressed as the common room for Halloween Malfoy?” she asked sweetly.
He didn’t seem inclined to get up again. He tipped his head back against the stone floor, closing his eyes. Draco sighed and bent over to haul him to his feet.
He’d only talked about it with Pansy once when they were drunk last year, he hadn’t been sure if she’d remembered.
“I can be a bit of an idiot when I drink,” he muttered.
A muscle jumped in Potter’s jaw.
“I... um... I... I was looking for... my sister?” she stuttered weakly, seemingly unable to tear her gaze away.
Potter kept moving backwards and Draco stalked him down the street. Then Potter tripped in a snow drift at the corner, and started to fall. Draco snapped his hand out and caught Potter’s wrist, pulling him steady. They were standing too close now, and Draco’s anger faded slightly. It was his own fault really. He should have known better.
Luna turned back to Draco with a soft sigh, and rested her cheek on her fist, with her elbow on the table.
“What about you? I’ve seen your ‘googly eyes' for Pansy, and you could actually do something about it,” he accused her. He was doing this then.
Draco watched him, trying to stay resolute to the decision he’d just made. He was finding it hard not to take it back already, with Potter so agitated like this. No, he had to set boundaries. Potter really didn’t need to know how much of a pushover Draco was for him.
He knew he never would.
“More than likely. Blaise is always pretty strict about taking advantage of loose inhibitions. He thrives on other people’s secrets... and he’s been trying to get into Turpin’s pants, so Truth or Dare is probably on the cards.”
Draco felt weird, his stomach was anxiously churning, and the caffeine from the espresso made him feel too aware of Potter’s movements. He couldn’t help feeling like he’d failed some sort of test. He needed to be alone so he could over think everything that had just happened, and possibly have a panic attack.
It was almost noon by the time Pansy appeared. Sleep was Pansy’s favourite pass time, and weekend lie-ins were practically sacred to her. She was immaculately put together as always in a chic little day dress, but her eyes were heavy and she was yawning as she came to find him. She draped herself over the back of his chair like an overindulged house cat.
They were all taking Arithmancy, so they worked together on the problems they had been given in the last class, and they found that they worked very well together. Granger didn’t ask Draco any more personal questions, and he relaxed a little bit. He was fascinated by the ways all their minds worked. Granger’s shrewd logic, Luna’s unique approach, and Patil’s perfectionism.
Brown, Justin, and Finnigan all drank.
“Hey,” Potter said quietly, ducking the eye contact and staring down at the table.
He tried to keep his tone neutral, and MacMillan looked him up and down, his frown deepening. He gave a little scoff, but then he shrugged.
“I’ll get the bill, shall I?” he said uncertainly.
She gave him a wobbly smile back.
“I need to assess the full extent of the damage Mr Malfoy. Off. Now.”
He couldn’t come near Draco without a reason of course. Draco wondered for the hundredth time if Potter even remembered Halloween. The phantom feeling of Potter’s touch on his skin made him twitch.
Draco shrugged. He couldn’t say it was because he had an unquenchable desire to know what Potter was up to at all times.
Draco laughed bitterly.
“You should leave them in for a bit. If you take them out before the party your hair will be all wavy. It’ll look lovely.”
As Mr Potter was unavailable for comment, we can only speculate as to his current state of mind, but his erratic and violent behaviour seems to suggest that in the aftermath of the War Potter has become unhinged. This reporter wonders why Headmistress McGonagall has yet to get involved? Showing such blatant favouritism so early in her career as Head of Hogwarts school could rightly cause alarm for some parents.
“That's just it. We've grown into ourselves a little bit more now, but we were just kids then. I was a know-it-all, desperate to be perfect, muggleborn. Ron was the sixth of his brothers to come here, no one expected anything from him... and Harry? He was Harry Potter, the boy who lived, but he was also a half starved orphan, who had nothing but the enormous expectation of strangers heaped on him.”
“Back so soon Miss Weasley? Miss Roper is resting. Mr Malfoy, what on Earth has happened to your leg?” the Matron greeted them as they tumbled through the Hospital wing doors.
They pulled out chairs, and pulled their homework from their bags.
“That she could think that... I....” His voice was small and broken.
“I study with Perks and Finnigan because we all take Astronomy, but I’m not going on outings with them! Why didn’t you tell me about this?” she said shrilly.
“No matter the gender, Potter clearly still has no taste,” he forced out, praying his voice remained calm, “or any decorum. A toilet on the train? He’s so desperate he can’t wait until we arrive? He never did have any self control.” He gave a disgusted sniff.
“I guessed you didn’t know.”
“I don’t want you to apologise, it would just be nice if we could move on.”
Blaise snorted.
Draco shrugged and carried on walking.
“She knows that Harry, but she also spent most of the last year assuming you would get back together, and you didn’t exactly let her down gently. People process things in their own way. You could try being less of a defensive dick about it.”
McGonagall definitely didn’t know how to react to Potter’s little speech, but she responded in her usual clipped manner.
Draco shrugged, putting the list back down on the table.
He sighed and put down his quill.
There was an abrupt shift in attentiveness at her words. People sat up straighter and private glances were shared. Beside him, Pansy and Blaise twitched with contained excitement. Draco kept his head down, his anxiety was quickly snowballing into full blown panic. Live with Gryffindor’s? Was McGonagall crazy? He wouldn’t live out the year.
“Good morning sunshine! What you doing over here at the boring table?” Potter asked, tugging on a strand of Luna’s long blonde hair. He glanced past Luna and spotted Draco, his eyebrows quirking up in surprise.
Draco rolled his eyes. The last party had been a mixed success for him.
Raised voices from all around the pub deafened Draco. He should probably run. If magical law enforcement were called, and he was found on the scene, he’d most likely be arrested just for being nearby.
“I... neither have I really,” he hiccupped. “None that I’ve been allowed to know. Will you tell me about your mum?”
“It’s time for the ‘getting to know you' portion of the evening. Who wants to play a proper Slytherin game?”
“Some of them,” she said, waving a hand. “It will be fine I think. There were a lot of expectations after the war, and life just doesn’t wrap up that neatly you know. They just need some time.”
“Yes, besides that,” Draco replied ironically.
“It’s definitely an effective way to get to know people. I had no idea about Lisa and Fred, that was jolly bonkers,” Justin continued, sniffing a little, his curls flattening as he pulled his blanket over his head.
There was a moment when the whole room stood frozen, staring as Potter wiped a bloody hand across his mouth. The music changed track, and everyone turned away and carried on with the party as though nothing had happened.
The door was ajar, through which Draco could hear upbeat music and terrible singing. He pushed open the door and stared as Finch-Fletchley bopped and shimmied around half of the room, flicking his wand as he stuck up gaudy sequined wall hangings over the warm oak panelling. There were also what appeared to be large muggle pictures of static women frozen in poses wearing bizarre muggle clothes. Draco found them unnerving. A magical record player in the corner was the source of the music, and Finch-Fletchley sang along to himself,
“I... well... OK, you know what happened last Friday?” he said a little desperately.
He glanced over at Justin’s bed. He was awake, his eyes blinking slowly from a mound of pillows, a small worried frown between his eyes.
Or it would get worse, but he wasn’t honestly sure how much worse it could be.
When Draco looked up Potter was fixated on him, his gaze speculative. Draco shifted nervously.
Weasley shot up from the table and stormed out of the Hall. Granger locked eyes with Potter, a frown of deep disapproval on her face. They seemed to be having a silent conversation, before Granger looked away and sighed. She got up and followed Girl Weasley. Potter turned back to Luna with a forced grin as though nothing had happened.
“That wasn’t very nice Harry,” she scolded.
She smiled uncertainly back at him, her eyes glittering with some emotion Draco couldn’t name.
Potter threw his arm out to gesture at the room as a whole and said gleefully, “Haven’t you noticed there’s a party going on?”
Draco forced himself to turn around and leave the room. The corridor was still empty, the noise of people and music filtering up the stairs. The party didn’t sound like it was going to slow down any time soon.
“Like you don’t care. I’ve seen you and your googly eyes for Harry.”
A terrible thought struck him then.
“Never have I ever done any roll play in bed,” he said.
“Oh! Well, of course, why didn’t you just say that to begin with? Is he alright?”
He was stumped.
Draco shuddered, his hands coming up to grip Potter’s biceps. Potter pulled back with a smirk, digging his fingers into Draco’s side. It was just a small self-assured curl of his lips, like he knew he was going to get exactly what he wanted, but in that moment realisation slammed into Draco so hard that he shivered again. His mind had been blissfully blank since the second Potter touched him, but suddenly thoughts crowded into his brain, demanding his attention.
Lovegood was smiling sadly.
He became absorbed in his studies, and when he looked up again he realised he’d been joined by Granger and Padma Patil. The two girls were sharing a room and Draco was amazed by the decision. He imagined the two swottiest girls in the school together would be a recipe for disaster. They would surely burn each other out with impromptu pop quiz competitions at 2am. When would they sleep? They seemed perfectly at ease with each other though, Granger’s frizzy dark brown bun beside Patil's sleek black ponytail as their heads bent together in whispered conversion.
“I...” he started, before continuing in a rush, “I just wanted to say that I’m aware my family has caused you rather a lot of turmoil, and I’m sorry. As for me personally, I know that my behaviour in the past has been... abhorrent to say the least, especially towards you. I won’t make any excuses for myself, I can’t justify my actions, all I can say is I’m sorry... and I have a lot of regrets. I’m trying to be better.”
“Sure,” he said sarcastically.
“Oh, she didn’t tell you? I thought she was your BFF now,” said Girl Weasley snidely from down the table.
He’d thought the bathroom was empty, but when he rounded the corner to where there was a wall of sinks he saw someone standing there and froze. Potter stood with his back to him, his hands braced on the sink in front of him, with his head bowed. Draco watched him silently for a moment. Potter didn’t appear to be doing anything except staring at the water coming out of the taps. Draco thought of all the things he should say to him, starting with ‘thank you’ and ending with ‘you saved my life, why did you do that?’ but he was a coward still. He didn’t say anything. He walked out quietly, and he had no idea if Potter had even known he was there.
Blaise’s money was safe. There were only two people per room, but McGonagall had made sure to mix the Houses up. Draco watched the sour look cross Pansy’s face when she saw her name on a door under the name ‘Parvati Patil’, before she plastered on a smile to greet her new roommate. Draco’s stomach started to churn as he wondered who his roommate would be. It would be just awful if it was Boot. What if it was Potter? He tripped going up the stairs at the thought. He wasn’t sure which would be worse. With a rush of fear he wished Blaise had waited for him, but squashed his emotions quickly. He wasn’t a child. If he was going to make it through the year he would have to bear whatever was thrown at him, with quiet dignity.
“Noted,” Blaise grimaced, peering around a pair of grizzly old wizards clutching smoking goblets at the bar, looking for Madam Rosmerta.
Justin was tense beside Draco.
There was no accusation in his tone, but Draco bristled a little all the same. This was the first time Potter had spoken to him since school began.
The Slytherin’s were the hardest to take, because he knew them all. At least with the rest he felt like it almost wasn’t personal. He was just a target for their anger and their grief. A face to represent all the evil of the war now the Dark Lord was gone. Seeing the Slytherin kids he had helped to tutor over the years, kids who had come to him for advice, kids who had looked up to him as an example, their faces twisted with disgust, cut him more deeply than he would ever admit.
Draco tensed instinctively, but Potter smiled at him. It wasn’t the loose grin that he had seen on Potter's face before, or the smirk he had sometimes thrown Draco’s way. This smile was heated, wolfish, and to Draco’s horror he felt his face flush of its own accord. Potter, slowly and deliberately, winked at him.
He’d turned the small piece of paper over, hoping for more, but he didn’t find anything except the familiar tang of disappointment. Pansy had been watching him from across the table, so he’d shoved the letter away and tried not to think about it.
“It’s my godfather’s jacket. I didn’t want to ruin it,” Potter explained quietly, keeping pace with Draco.
Draco felt his cheeks get hot, and glanced around for an easy escape route. Potter already had his wand in his hand. Draco hadn’t even seen him move. He’d stayed in his relaxed position against the bar, but he was vibrating with coiled energy, a manic smile on his face.
“I don’t know. It doesn’t matter anyway, she’s going through a lot right now,” she mumbled.
They sat next to the Ravenclaws. Terry Boot shot a dark look Draco’s way, but nothing else was said under McGonagall’s knowing gaze.
“Are we going to talk about last night?”
Blaise turned puppy dog eyes on Pansy, but she shook her fork at him.
“Uh huh,” she said sceptically.
Oh Merlin. Draco was in so much trouble.
“Nowhere Pans! I’ve been here. I was looking for you for bloody ages! Where have YOU been?” he shot back at her.
“Potter?” he called, feeling a bit absurd.
“Have you tried talking to him Hermione?” Luna asked softly.
“Ummmmm....” was his intelligent reply.
“I can’t believe I didn’t see it before. You look so much alike!” she exclaimed, looking between them.
“Could you do an announcement about that in the Great Hall? Save people from hurting themselves in the future, and from hurting me in the present,” he said half jokingly to cover up his discomfort.
Justin smiled, snuggling down in his bed. Draco waved his wand to turn the lights off. They were quiet in the dark, before Justin gave a small nervous cough.
“But you want me...” he said, his voice slurred and slow with incomprehension.
The Minister stepped forwards and placed his hands on the desk.
Potter glowered at the floor.
Blaise kicked him and drank. Draco snickered. Longbottom and Gryffindor Patil also drank, both of them blushing furiously. Finnigan and Thomas cracked up laughing.
“Your faith in me is heart-warming” Tracey said grinning.
Justin struck a dramatic pose as the song ended, and Draco clapped, still giggling.
“I overheard them saying some disgusting things about Justin, which I won’t repeat... when I challenged them about it, one of them asked me what Voldemort did to me to turn me into ‘a fucking faggot',” he said, his voice rough.
“What do you mean? You know that I have!” Granger shot back.
The castle was quiet as he walked down to the entrance hall. He didn’t see a single person. The short stroll across the grounds to the Owlery was wonderfully brisk. A path had already been cleared through the snow by the passage of many feet since the snow had stopped. His thighs burned as he climbed up the endless staircase, which was partially wrapped around the outside of the tall, thin tower. When he finally made it to the top, he looked back over the vast expanse of snow, and the castle glittering with frost in the sunlight. He took a moment to appreciate just how beautiful the castle was. He’d always been impressed by it, but he’d never admitted it. A Malfoy couldn’t be impressed by anything.
“My parents,” she shrugged. “When I decided to help Harry fight Voldemort I knew my parents would be in danger. I wiped their memories of me and sent them to Australia to keep them safe. I went to find them, but when I did... well I couldn’t undo what I’d done. I stayed for a while to make sure they’re happy, and they are. They have a really nice life out there,” she stopped, hiccupping as silent tears tracked down her chestnut brown cheeks.
He blinked in surprise.
After his classes finished Draco made it to the library in one piece. When he walked in he felt contentment wash over him. He’d always loved this library. He loved the high ceilings and the dark wood shelves that were taller than anyone could reach. The hush was so peaceful. It was never too cold or too warm. He loved that you could get lost in it. It was like a maze, and while wandering the tall dark shelves you could come across a study area with little tables, or a window with a squishy window seat, or a comfortable reading nook, or a couple aggressively making out.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought.
You’re all adults here, and I don’t wish to treat you like children, I’m trusting you to be sensible. You are responsible for yourselves.”
“Oh...” was all he could think to say.
Almost everyone drank except Pansy, Draco, and Potter. Draco looked at Potter surprised, but he just grinned back lazily.
“I’m aware,” said Draco, a little pointedly. He was thinking about Halloween.
Blaise had been right. Potter’s antics on the train were the only thing people seemed to want to talk about. Draco was more than a little bit relieved, as no one even glanced his way in the Great Hall. A lot of people were peering over to the Hufflepuff table, where Finch-Fletchley was surrounded by giggling girls, his ears very pink. Most people were staring at Potter, taking in his new look, and whispering behind their hands. Potter himself seemed completely unfazed by the attention, which wasn’t really anything new for him anyway Draco surmised. What had surprised Draco was where Potter had decided to sit at the Gryffindor table. He was laughing with Finnigan and Thomas, bracketed by Patil and the newly scarred Brown. A little way down the table Granger and Weasley sat with Longbottom. The three of them kept throwing disapproving looks towards Potter, feathers clearly ruffled like a gaggle of clucking hens.
It was almost dinnertime when they started to pack up, and Draco had a sudden panicky burst of courage to do something he’d been wanting to do.
“You really want me to go that much?” he asked weakly.
This was a set up.
“Semantics,” Pansy scoffed.
He couldn’t remember the exact wand movement for the spell used on bruises so he just left it, slipping out of the bed to put on his pyjamas. He’d have to look for the notes he made last year on healing magic. When he pulled on his loose trousers he noticed 5 little bruises on his forearm where Boot had grabbed him and he paused. Looking at them made him think about all the other times he’d had similar marks. He sat on the edge of his bed.
Potter stumbled forwards, the momentum of his last movements bringing him to his knees as he tried to stop himself. He was panting, his hands clenched in fists against the floor. Hermione crouched down next to him, speaking softly, and after a second he looked up to meet her eyes. The anger left him, and suddenly he was just a frightened boy. His eyes darted around, like a cornered animal, and finally rested on Draco.
When I started writing this fic I really didn’t set out to make Justin Finch-Fletchley into a character, but then I stuck him in Draco’s room to cause mischief (for my own amusement) and he just turned into the cutest muffin. Now I love him. ~Kisses~
Hermione had decided that it was best if he and Potter had a lunch date. He’d argued that it should just be coffee. Apparently that was unacceptable to Potter because there was only one tea and coffee shop in Hogsmeade, and Potter had an unexplained disgust for the place.
“How? I’m pretty sure Aunt Bella didn’t have an affair with Xenophilius Lovegood.”
He picked at the bobbles on his bedsheet.
“Never have I ever had sex with a girl,” she said, boldly turning her eyes on Potter with interest.
She sniffed, then pulled some parchment from her bag.
The last few years had been awful. The twisted memories took up the space of what was once a bright and joyful thing.
The last picture Luna showed him was the oldest, and he stared at it in awe. In it, Pandora was younger than either Draco or Luna, maybe 13 or 14. Draco realised she was in the rose garden at Malfoy Manor,  and with her in the photo was a very small boy who was beaming and hugging her legs. His father. Draco had never seen a picture of his father as such a small child. He looked happy as he waved his small fists up at his sister, who laughed. Draco felt a well of sadness in his chest, thinking about the life that was ahead of this joyful child. How he would be shaped and cut down to fulfil a hollow legacy, just as Draco had.
Everyone drank and then laughed when they looked around the circle.
“It’s not the same and you know it,” he hissed at her.
“You didn’t!?” he gasped.
Justin looked at him.
“Are you taking me to bed?” he asked hopefully, trying to grab for Draco.
“OK, so if I tell you something, can you keep it a secret for a little bit?” he asked desperately.
“Why?” was all he said, genuinely confused. Potter didn’t need to justify his behaviour to the likes of Draco.
Professor McDonald stopped before the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the Headmistress’s office.
On Wednesday Draco had another study session planned with Hermione after lunch. He was early. The snow had finally stopped falling, which meant his fellow students had taken to frolicking in the icy slush whenever they could. Rogue snowballs were hurled his way too frequently to be a coincidence, so he stayed inside. A few of them had been full of rocks.
When they got back to the table with another tray of drinks, Blaise slid into the booth on Draco’s side. They had strategically started a conversation about Paris fashion week, so that it wouldn’t look suspicious that Blaise had decided to sit next to Draco. Blaise wanted to go to Paris in March for the shows, but Draco thought it probably wouldn’t work while they were still in school. He suggested they could go to London fashion week in the summer instead. Pansy and Justin joined in with the conversation happily. Pansy was of the opinion that Paris fashion was superior, but Justin said his mother had connections within London high society and could probably get them tickets. Luna and Padma were listening, both of them unaware of the goings on in the muggle fashion industry.
“Draco...” her tone was too gentle.
“Lisa, please take your turn?”
“Why do you hate the tea shop so much?” he asked, genuinely curious.
“Well I feel exceptionally lucky to have been rescued by you today Cousin, you’re my white Knight, my guardian angel, but now I am in desperate need of a shower,” he sighed wearily.
Still nothing.
He dropped the book into his lap hopelessly. He didn’t even have any homework left to distract him. He was too over prepared.
He blinked.
“I have a free study period now. I was on my way to the library when I heard you.”
He fought back every time, but they were never alone and even the best duellist would struggle. He wasn’t the best duellist.
“What did I miss?” he said groggily.
“You know she’s upset, fighting with her isn’t going to help. You should try and be the bigger person,” Luna suggested gently.
Draco glared at him. Of course he knew that, but it wasn’t something he knew how to stop doing.
The distressing image of the Golden boy turning ashy as he gurgled in a pool of vomit, which flashed through his mind, propelled Draco into opening the door.
“Of course I like her,” she said, going pink, “she’s my best friend.”
Potter drank, and so did Blaise and Tracey. Finnigan looked mildly impressed.
A few years ago, this would have been the perfect ammunition for Draco to use to get Potter to pay attention to him. Now he wished he could find a way for Potter to never find out about it, as futile as that wish was. Luckily Potter probably wouldn’t find out in front of the whole school, he rarely showed up for breakfast anymore.
Draco gaped at him in surprise.
He hid in the tower all day. When the sky turned inky, and the shadows stretched across the floor, he forced himself to climb back up the stairs and go to bed. He crawled beneath the covers, still in his well worn jeans and soft baggy jumper.
My schedule is out the window. Too much work, too many new books coming out that I had to read! I'm still writing every day, chipping away at the ham, so I'll probably just start uploading chapters as and when I finish them.~Kisses~
“Of course not!” Pansy says angrily to Draco, as though he had been the one to suggest that Patil was ashamed of her in the first place.
“But you like Weasley,” Draco said, swirling the dregs of his coffee.
Potter sighed dramatically, as though the whole display was very underwhelming, and he had better places to be.
He was giggling until he glanced towards the open door, and saw Longbottom and Weasley staring at him with varying degrees of shock and alarm. They were both frozen, Longbottom’s fist extended to knock the door opposite their room. The door behind which, Draco suddenly remembered, Potter would be.
Draco tried very hard not to think about what Potter might have done with Finch-Fletchley on the train. He had to live with the other boy for a year, so he might as well try to make it as cordial as possible. When Finch-Fletchley stopped his dancing to meet Draco’s eyes in a challenging stare, Draco held his gaze and smiled tightly. He stepped into the room towards the smaller boy and held out his hand.
It lasted a few seconds before Draco’s brain caught up and he realised what was happening. He pulled back from Potter so violently that he nearly fell backwards through the door of the restaurant. He grabbed the door frame to steady himself.
She was shaking her head, her eyes screwed shut.
Hermione smiled sadly.
“Potter really must have had a breakdown.”
Draco shrugged.
Another thing to owe Potter for.
The smile slid off Draco’s face when Potter claimed the spot on Luna's other side, straddling the bench between his thighs so he was facing her. He had a little yellow duck charm hanging from his left ear today, and his eyes were ringed with smudged purple eyeshadow.
“You’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plan with Harry then. Keep an eye on him for me, will you?”
“Justin, what you said about George not being serious... Blaise isn’t a serious person either, not at the moment. You know that right?” Draco said carefully.
Draco was definitely surprised, but he scolded himself because he really shouldn’t be. Anyone with eyes could see Ron was straighter than a ruler, and Justin wouldn’t have had much contact with any of his other brothers. The twins had certainly been more prolific than Draco had given them credit for. His list of Weasley’s that Potter could have slept with had just been reduced to one.
“Of course he did. Shouldn’t Potter technically owe him. I didn’t break anything.”
They both made a beeline for the library.
He nodded slowly.
“Oh, that would be great!”
With a spark of betrayal he realised he felt much more comfortable in this common room than he ever had in the dungeons. The smooth wooden floor was covered in thick purple rugs. There were squishy purple armchairs and sofas dotted about and grouped around the fire, with big creamy throw cushions and fuzzy cream afghan blankets. A collection of study tables were grouped in a corner, bracketed by bookshelves full of books on advanced magic. There was a sideboard covered in fascinating magical instruments, on top of cupboards stuffed with a selection of loose leaf tea, teapots and mugs, and a magical urn that supplied unlimited hot water. The paintings were all landscapes and seascapes. Draco’s absolute favourite part of the common room however was the wall of windows. One whole wall of the room had floor to ceiling glass, giving an uninterrupted view of the sky over the endless forest. It was spectacular at night. Draco couldn’t believe he’d ever thought he was content in the dungeons, with his view so restricted. Now he felt like he could see the whole world, and it made him feel alive.
“Yes what?” he asked.
Potter swayed, looking lost. Draco groaned in exasperation, running anxious hands through his hair. He couldn’t just leave Potter like this.
Draco looked him up and down, rather enjoying how contrite Potter looked after keeping him waiting.
“Never have I ever been attracted to boys,” she said evenly.
They had reached the top of the stairs, and Beckett rapped smartly on the door.
“You’re an idiot,” he huffed.
“I’ll help,” she said uncertainly.
“I saw him come in really early in the morning a while ago. At the time I assumed he’d come from somewhere else in the castle, I didn’t even think that he might have been out of the school.”
“Of course I will,” said Luna, her face glowing as she beamed at him.
“Clothes off Mr Malfoy,” she instructed calmly.
He’d said that so many times to himself it was like a mantra. He didn’t even want to think about what life would be like when school was over.
“Of course!” said Tracey. “Never have I ever had a sexual fantasy about a teacher.”
The first two weeks back ended up being pretty quiet. Finch-Fletchley was a much better roommate than Draco could have imagined. He found classes so much less stressful without the shadow of the war hanging over him. The library was just as peaceful as it ever was. He really should have appreciated those two weeks more.
He headed over to Granger and the Ravenclaw girls, leaning over the back of the sofa to look down at Patil.
“Oh my God! Why didn’t you tell me!? I need to know everything!” his eyes were shining with excitement.
Draco hummed thoughtfully. This close to the school he was starting to panic about what was going to happen. His thoughts were racing. Could he be expelled for this? Arrested? He hadn’t done anything, but that probably wouldn’t matter.
She made a face.
“Don’t talk about Hermione like you know her,” he ground out.
“I’m really very sorry about that Lovegood,” he met her gaze, biting his lips.
Justin giggled as he chambered into bed, pulling his blankets around him like a cape.
He gazed at the books opposite him, and twitched when he spotted the very compendium that he had been looking for on one of the lower shelves. He leaned forwards, and tugged it free, letting it fall open on his lap. He got lost for a while, flicking through the pages of the detailed illustrations and magical properties of the plants, thinking that he needed to speak to Professor Sprout. When he looked up, Hermione was reading one of the books she had collected, sitting cross legged on the window seat, her back against the glass. They stayed in companionable silence, reading together, until the lamps in the library blinked on and off twice, signalling it was nearly time for Madam Pince to lock up.
“Last year was terrible for a lot of students. Some of them don’t want to leave the battleground yet. They don’t understand that part of winning is letting go of grudges and moving on. It doesn’t make what happened any less terrible, but holding onto pain, and placing blame, will only hurt them in the long run.”
She hadn’t replied to any of his letters.
“Um Draco? Have you and Blaise ever...?” Justin asked softly out of the darkness, the end of his sentence hanging heavily in the air.
“You’re welcome to come as well Pansy? And Blaise?” she said uncertainly.
Draco was keeping his voice in the careful, polite tone that he had been taught growing up. Potter frowned and shot quick darting glances towards him, and away. Draco looked away from him and around the pub. For the first time since they had arrived, he could feel the eyes of strangers upon him. More specifically, on him and Potter.
Pansy waved his apology away.
Draco blinked, nonplussed.
“You really are a Ravenclaw,” he muttered. “I can handle myself OK? There are a lot of people who are unhappy that I’m here, and sometimes they express that unhappiness in a blasty sort of way. I just have to get through the school year.”
He was looking for a fight.
Sure, Draco had gotten there early because he got everywhere early, but now it was one fifteen, and Potter was officially late.
“Well I’ll be knackered tomorrow night too.”
The gleam in Justin’s eyes, as he sat up on the bed, was not unlike the look Pansy got when she thought there was gossip to hunt down.
Potter tripped backwards, falling onto his arse in the loose way drunk people fall.
Weasley spluttered, sitting forward and staring shocked at MacMillan before whipping his head around the group.
He slid out of bed, shivering. The winter morning was freezing, but he smiled when he looked out of the window. The sky was that impossibly clear cornflower blue, that seemed brighter than any summer day over the crystal shimmer of the white snow. The sun was low in the sky, blinding but cold. The snow covered trees in the forest were barely moving, the morning was so still and fresh.
Potter stood behind the sofa, Finnigan and Thomas behind him. His eyes danced mischievously in the light of the fire, a challenging smirk on his lips.
That got Draco’s attention
As he was rifling through his wardrobe, Justin bounced into the room, still in his pyjamas, his hair wet from the shower. Within seconds a familiar song began to play as the record player started spinning.
“I will be acting as your Head of House and will be directly accountable for your behaviour, so please bear that in mind. The staff and I will of course be helping you to get through your NEWTs, but we’d also like you to pursue your own areas of independent study, with opportunities for one on one tutoring with staff if we can help you with any particular topic. You are free to come and go from the castle as you please. Your conduct will have no bearing on house points, and I won’t be handing out detentions.
MacMillan and Finch-Fletchley laughed, and Draco heard another muffled laugh. He looked around and saw Granger a few seats away with her hand over her mouth, blushing furiously. No one else seemed to have noticed.
As he reached the top landing he saw a corridor lined with open doors, boys calling back and forth to one another across the hall. He shoved his hands in his pockets and stalked forwards, gaze flicking left and right to see which room he’d been assigned. Through the very first open doorway he locked eyes with Boot, who was smiling at something Ernie MacMillan had said, before his face froze when he registered Draco. Draco raised his eyebrows at him with the last of his false bravado, and Boots face reddened in anger before he quickly turned away. Draco’s chest loosened slightly knowing he wasn’t going to have to sleep in the same room as someone who hated him so openly.
Blaise sighed and got to his feet. Draco slid out of his side of the booth, and followed Blaise to the bar.
“When was the last time Slytherin won the Quiddich House Cup though,” Theo shot back slyly, earning a hard punch on the arm from Tracey.
“I don’t really do desserts, but please,” he said, gesturing for Potter to continue.
“Padma did say that, but Blaise said you still owe him for the emotional damage of ruining his evening,” Justin muttered sheepishly.
“Calm down old boy, I was just thinking. You can ask me any personal question... I might choose not to answer, but I’d hate to think you felt like you had to censor yourself around me.”
He kicked off his shoes and burrowed down under his blankets to make his point. He looked up at Blaise beseechingly, silently asking him to let it go. Blaise ran a hand over his face, clearly deciding if it was worth the effort to keep arguing.
“I guess that explains why Connie didn’t want to come back to school this year,” said Anthony Goldstein a few seats down the table. “Her dad must have agreed to put her on the Prophet payroll. She certainly knows enough students to get the inside scoop.”
Pansy sighed dramatically.
Potter sat down carefully, as if he were afraid that Draco might bolt if he made any sudden movements. The twitchiness continued, his fingers drumming on the table. His face was expressionless, but his green eyes darted around.
Draco gave a small indignant squawk as she began towing him forcefully towards the nearest carriage door. Although she would never admit it, Draco knew Pansy was just as apprehensive and anxious about returning to Hogwarts as he was.
“You really do like books then old boy? I’ve been trying to figure out how you arranged them, and I can’t see any patterns or order there myself.”
Pansy grabbed his face to pull him so he was looking at her again.
“Oh Draco I’m so sorry! I should be getting you upstairs.”
Potter ran a hand over his face and through his hair, looking away into the crowd. He blew out a harsh breath, and shifted to pull his cigarettes from his back pocket. He pulled one from the pack and twirled it between his fingers, but he didn’t light it. The motion drew Draco’s attention to Potter’s fingernails, which were painted lime green.
Potter went rigid, straightening up with an indignant scowl.
Draco grinned at the startled expression frozen on Pansy’s face.
When Potter put the first spoon of creamy custard into his mouth he moaned “fuuuck,” and proceeded to devour the dessert. Draco shifted in his chair, uncomfortable for a whole new reason. He tried to look like he wasn’t staring.
“I’ll think about it.”
All three girls stared at him. Luna’s bottom lip looked a bit trembly.
Draco winced, and pulled out his wand automatically. Potter stiffened, but allowed Draco to take his arm as they paused in the snow. Draco was pretty confident in his ability to take care of minor injuries now,  and muttered the incantations under his breath. Potter watched silently, with wide eyes, as the cuts knit back together, leaving his copper skin smooth and unblemished once more.
“Believe me, I was trying to,” said Potter, looking back at Draco with a grim smile.
The weather was hot, and the sky was blindingly clear on September 1st. In the not so distant past, this hopeful day of new beginnings had seemed like a pipe dream. The wizarding world was at peace, evil had been vanquished, and Hogwarts had been rebuilt to welcome it’s students back for a new school year.
He felt no compulsion to drink, Boot wasn’t part of the game, but he sipped his drink anyway, curling forwards and avoiding anyone’s eye contact.
“No Pansy! Just let it go. They’ve had a shot at me, I’m sure they all feel much better. For all I know it could have been Theo because I forgot to remind him about the Transfiguration homework, it doesn’t matter.”
Everyone was staring at Potter like he’d just told a joke at a funeral. Granger looked like she was torn between being horrified and proud. Draco didn’t know what to think. Had Harry Potter just defended him to all his peers? He felt numb, but he knew he would probably freak out later. At least the shock had shaken off his panic attack.
A large dark bruise was blossoming across his stomach. It was tender, but not too bad. He sat up straight, placed a hand against his side and took a deep breath. It was sore, but there was no crackling so he was pretty sure nothing was broken. He’d dealt with broken ribs before.
“I really couldn’t give a fuck what you think,” Potter shot back, his eyes flashing dangerously.
He stared at her some more. Obviously he wanted to date Potter, but what alternative universe had he stumbled into where that could be a possibility. It was a ridiculous notion that would end terribly. For him.
“He sounds like he’d get on well with Hagrid. He’s a bit dragon mad too,” Potter said, before looking down at the bowl in front of him in surprise.
He was at a complete loss as to how to start making amends.
Luna closed her eyes and said in a whispered rush, “I don’t know, I mean, I never... I’ve never even thought about any of it. There’s never been anything, it was just never important. I’ve never liked any girls, or boys, or anyone... not in that way... but with Ginny, I don’t know, I feel connected to her, she makes me feel safe, she makes me happy. Then there were all these feelings suddenly, and I don’t know what to do about it.” She sniffed.
“Draco!”
Potter sat down directly opposite him. Draco felt less better.
He’d taken his time wandering down to the village. The day was still beautiful. Freezing, but beautiful, and he’d enjoyed appreciating the scenery the way he rarely ever did. Hogsmeade in the snow was the way the village was meant to be. The tiny houses and shops always looked their best and most magical with a coating of glittering frost, and their roofs heavy with snow.
He groaned, dropping his head into his hands. He had been quite happy with going to his grave not knowing. That way he could pretend that it could have been a possibility, instead of finding out for sure that it wasn’t.
“I know you do darling, we all do.”
Draco hoped he had managed to school his face so it didn’t let on that he knew that already. It wasn’t a good idea for Potter to find out how often Draco had stared at him in the Great Hall over the years.
To continue this story, and for further details of Potter’s illicit behaviour, please turn to pages 4 and 5.”
There was a slightly forced tone of nonchalance in her voice, which puzzled Draco enough that he missed the implication of her words for a moment.
“Would you fancy coming to the Three Broomsticks for a few drinks?” she continued.
It was Draco’s turn to stare silently out into the snow storm, thinking about how to answer him.
Justin kept frowning for a moment, before realisation dawned in his eyes and he snickered.
Both of them looked grim, and they were whispering together. He wanted Luna to have some time with Weasley so he shouted to her that he would find her later, and headed off to look for Pansy, or some booze, whichever came first.
Cool soft fingertips brushed his hair back from his face, soothing him, and he squinted up into to the wide silvery eyes of Luna Lovegood. She helped to heave him into a sitting position against the wall, and squatted down next to him to peer into his face.
Pansy would want to know why, and Draco needed to think of what he would say to convince her. All the shallow, practical reasons that his Slytherin brain had supplied him with in that alley were only part of it. He barely wanted to admit it to himself, but he had missed Potter’s attention. Logically he knew that this was more of a business arrangement than a relationship, but he’d be lying if he didn’t acknowledge that the biggest reason he’d agreed was an excuse to spend time with Potter.
His blush deepened when Potter caught him staring. He paused, watching Draco watch him. He reached up to catch his cigarette as it tilted when he took a long drag, cocking his head to the side to consider Draco by the fire, looking soft and innocent.
For Salazar’s sake, he’d actually agreed to out himself to the wizarding world... and his mother... just to help Harry Potter get a job.
Instead of pulling out a chair on the other side of the table, as Draco expected he would, Potter walked around to the chair directly beside him. Draco couldn’t think of any reason to object to this that would sound sane, but his hand clenched around his quill. A blob of ink dripped onto his notes.
Draco blinked, confused and convinced he had a terrible brain injury.
“I could...” Finch-Fletchley started, going pink again, but Draco held a hand out to stop him.
“Andi wanted to talk about... well I think she was trying to do like an intervention? They’re still writing about me all the time in the paper, and she’s been worrying. I spent quite a lot of time over her place in the summer, bonding with the little terror to give her a break.”
“Well maybe you could use this as an opportunity to talk,” she was frowning again.
Draco whirled around so fast that he almost tripped over his own feet. He hurried to catch up with Pansy and Blaise in the compartment they had claimed, as his mind stuttered over the implications of what had just happened.
Draco blinked rapidly, feeling a complex cocktail of emotions bubbling up in his chest. He sat down on the edge of his bed, worrying a Slytherin tie in his hands.
She got to her feet slowly, and Draco scrambled up after her. She put her hand on his arm to still him.
A huge part of him, the part of him that believed there was no coming back from the path his parents had set him on, the part of him that didn’t think he deserved anyone’s forgiveness, wanted to run away. To make his excuses to Finch-Fletchley and revert to his original plan of avoiding everyone. That was what a coward would do, and Draco was certain of his cowardice. Just maybe though, he could make a different choice. Maybe he didn’t deserve forgiveness, but avoiding facing the repercussions of his past was no better than regressing to his old habits and ways of thinking.
McGonagall looked between them, before sitting back down at her desk and rubbing her temples.
Draco saw that her eyes were a bit bloodshot but she had composed herself at least.
“Oh yes,” she flushed and looked down, “I mean, if you want to.”
“It’s the navy, I told you. Draws in Ravenclaws like a moth to a flame,” Draco crowed.
“You did what? Draco I didn’t tell you to get anything from you!”
“I’ve been talking to Harry. We’re... a bit better, and I thought it might help to get out of the castle. Luna is coming, and Padma,” she glanced past Draco, and he realised Pansy was listening intently.
Potter was beside him, turned towards Draco with his posture thrown wide open, one arm slung over the back of the sofa, one leg bent up on the seat. He was staring at him intently with his head tipped to the side, his eyes sliding down Draco’s body and back up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you two doing?” she asked, her eyebrows furrowed suspiciously.
Draco’s anxiety melted away in the face of his sudden fury. He’d known this was all bullshit.
Nothing.
Draco tried for a weak smile, and nodded.
The atmosphere around him was bright, but inside him a dark storm raged. He still couldn’t decide if this had been a terrible idea, and he was fast approaching the moment of no return. His name had been cleared, and if he wanted any hope of a future he needed to complete his NEWTs, but he still knew that he was unwelcome here.
“Oh,” she blinked and then looked down at her notes. “I always used to struggle with that too before I worked out that the Ohm and the Anth only refer to the past when paired with an Umlaut.”
“Honestly,” he lied, “I was on my way to my room and a spell hit me from behind. I woke up in bed. It could have been anyone.”
Theo looked around from where he was sitting with Daphne.
Draco was just wiping his eyes when Madame Pomfrey came back around the curtain. She spared a glance at Luna, before bending over him to check his chest. He looked down at it and saw that the redness had receded to a pale pinkish colour. The Matron gave him a tight smile.
She walked along the aisles with the confidence only the older students had, familiar with the quirks of the castle. Draco remembered being a first year, sticking to the more populated areas of the library, thinking he could be lost for weeks in its depths.
“Um, no, not at all. I was just wondering if you had done the translation for Ancient Runes? I always have trouble when it’s a past participle,” he blurted out.
“Well enjoy your little lesbian crisis. I promised Justin I’d be up to help him look for an outfit, which will involve looking at all the clothes he owns again. It could take a while.”
“Is this some sort of pathetic bribe or something? Or are you just showing off,” Potter said hotly. Challengingly.
Granger and Turpin were watching him shrewdly. Granger took a sip of the drink she was holding, and met his eyes steadily.
“So how do you play?” asked Longbottom.
“Sure, if you like.”
“Please don’t actually do that,” he choked out.
“It’s fine,” said Draco casually, as though he hadn’t been working himself up into a nervous wreak for twenty minutes.
“Umm... what is this music?”
They were standing close together on the dark street, the lights from the houses spilling orange warmth across the snow, and Potter was looking up at him with that same complicated expression he had worn in the pub. It was fear mixed with something else.
It was an archaic rule, steeped in Malfoy family tradition, that Draco couldn’t bypass even if he tried. By wizarding law a person came of age at 17, but Malfoy law withheld trust money until the age of 18 because it was tradition that a Malfoy would be engaged by their 18th birthday.
“Good?” Draco asked, smirking.
She looked at him sharply.
“Both,” Pansy replied, running her fingers through her damp fringe, “I think I might have a shot with the Ravenclaw twin. This is my year.”
He had barely come to terms with his own sexuality. For years he had been twisted up with confusion and fear. When he finally knew who he was, he also knew what it would mean for his life. He’d never be able to marry for love. He’d never even be able to openly date someone he liked. His father would never allow it. He would be expected to marry appropriately, and produce an Heir as soon as possible.
She rolled onto her side.
When he was done sucking on his spoon in a way that should be illegal, Potter put it down with a sigh.
He waved her concern away, turning to reach for the coffee pot.
“I know that you’ve lectured him, and you’ve nagged him. You and I both know that’s not going to work. You need to have a conversation. Listen to him! He doesn’t need more criticism, he needs a friend. He thinks he’s so alone right now Hermione,” Luna said, her voice achingly sad.
Draco pretended to be reading the book he had out on advanced weather charms.
“This will help with the welts. Take it with you, and if you run out please come back and see me.”
The main course arrived then, giving Draco time to wonder why Potter looked so uncomfortable.
They walked in silence again for a while, up the long winding path to the Hogwarts gates. Once they were back on the school grounds, Potter slowed to chuck his cigarette into the snow. It went out with a sizzle as it hit the frosty ground, melting a little pool of snow around it. Draco huffed, and vanished the butt with a flick of his wand, giving Potter a reproachful look. Potter just smirked at him.
Padma flushed again, but shrugged in response to Granger’s questioning stare.
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fuuuuuun!”
“We haven’t been together for well over a year, and I’m gay. She really needs to get over it already,” Potter said, crossing his arms defiantly.
The antagonistic Howard had also zeroed in on where Draco was touching Potter.
He forced his gaze away and propelled Potter across the room.
Blaise just shrugged. Pansy whipped the newspaper away from him and opened it to pages 4 and 5. She started reading intently. Draco could see a couple more photos of Potter included with the article, but none of them looked recent. There was one he recognised as the photo that was taken for the Triwizard Tournament, and he felt a bubble of hysterical laughter in his chest when he saw that they had cropped the photo to only include Potter and Cedric Diggory. He could only imagine what Connie Cuffe was speculating about Potter’s past.
