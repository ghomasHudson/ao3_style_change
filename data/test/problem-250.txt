"Potter, you don't seem to get it." Morag rolled her eyes and gave Aria a pointed look. "The reason Hannah is making such a big fuss about this is because she plans to seduce her boyfriend into bed that night.
"It's not my fault! First, Malfoy wouldn't let go of her – and then that bloody tosser Fisher shows up and goes all barkin mad, screaming about how it wasn't his fault and some other rubbish." Ron grumbled, grunting in exertion as he adjusted Aria again and began walking faster.
At this point, he knew she was just teasing him, but Draco still reddened and looked away so she wouldn't see the embarrassed cringe on his face.
Without turning around, McGonagall waved her wand once and folded her hands behind her back, waiting patiently as a single piece of chalk floated into the air and began spelling out the name of the class on the board.
Draco was waiting for her when she got there, his nose wrinked slightly in disdain as he stared at all the Hippogriff feathers scattered around. They didn't have to wait long before the doors to Hagrid's Hut swung open and Hagrid himself came clambering out, his friendly, bearded face immediately warming into a smile at the sight of Aria standing there and waving at him.
She sighed and, hesitantly, she reached a small gloved hand out and placed it into his. Instead of introducing herself to him, she answered him with a curt nod of her head before she pulled her hand away.
The class fell silent again, but this time, it was obvious that nobody wanted to answer. Taking pity on them, Fleur reached into her robes, pulling out the same white feather she had shown them at the start of the lesson.
and Aria heard from Blaise that Luca and Olivert were suspended for two weeks, followed by a series of weekly detentions for the remainder of the school year.
, of all people?! Do you know what kind of reputation he has?! And what the hell are you wearing?! You look like a harlot!" Macmillan shouted loudly.
"Oh was that your question? Mine was something about whether I valued loyalty or doing the right thing." Hannah mentioned curiously, looking up from her trunk. "I think I was placed in Hufflepuff because I said loyal friends
reporter who seemed to persist on writing about Aria was Rita Skeeter. It had even gotten to the point where the ferocity of her defamatory articles about Aria (and the veela community in general) had become so ridiculous that even the Daily Prophet had docked her column from the front page of their newspaper.
She had unusually sleek and incredibly long black hair. It fell over her shoulders and continued in a long, inky waterfall down her waist, past her ankles, until the silky strands hovered just a few inches above the floor by her feet. She was unnervingly attractive, with a perfectly sculpted nose, high cheekbones and a smooth, flawless complexion. The color of her skin was also noticeably very fair – almost glowing in an unnatural sort of way. She was tall – not as tall as he was but certainly taller than most girls in Draco's year. She was also very slender, her womanly curves visible even through the thick layer of ugly brown clothing she wore.
Ignoring the curious looks he received from the others, he went upstairs and changed quickly out of his school robes, throwing on his winter clothes and a long, gray coat. He was already hurrying his way out of the common room to chase after Aria when he suddenly heard a chorus of wolf whistles behind him, followed by Blaise hollering after him in an obnoxiously loud voice that echoed around the entire common room.
They blinked and stared after her retreating back for a few seconds before Blaise eventually shrugged and turned to Draco with a quirky grin.
More than a couple of minutes went by; and Aria was so lost in her own thoughts that it took her awhile to notice that someone had sat down into the seat beside her. She didn't have to look up to know who it was, however, because the touch of his hand on her leg and the warm press of his lips against her nape was enough for her to know that it was Draco.
"Someone's trashed the other common rooms during the night!" She blurted out, causing both Aria and Neville to jump up out of their seats in alarm. "As in completely
"Well then, I believe we've wrapped up everything you need to know about veelas." She bowed her head slightly and rewarded them all with a graceful curtsy. "
"You can drop the sass." Pansy countered, rolling her eyes at Aria's reaction. "My brother, Corey. The one I mentioned before? He's in second year now and he's doing really terribly at DADA." She hesitated, sensing the confusion in Aria's face and bit her lip before she continued. "Well, I know you're the best student at DADA in our year. I…I want you to tutor him, Potter. I want you to teach him how to defend himself properly." She finished uncertainly.
He tried to grab at her; but in her true form, Aria was faster and a lot more agile than she normally was so she was able to dodge his advances with relative ease. When he lunged at her, she flapped her wings and flew over his head; and he ended up swiping at nothing but air. Bentley eventually growled in frustration and spun around, yanking his wand out of his robes and pointing it at her with a snarl.
Aria waited until Greg walked off before she reluctantly turned back to face the reporters, meeting their predatory stares with a tight smile.
He was relieved when Narcissa mentioned that she had plans to meet up with a few of her friends after breakfast; so that meant Draco didn't have to worry about making up an excuse to avoid accompanying her on another one of her impromptu shopping sprees around London.
In Aria's nervousness, her voice cracked; and the sound of it was so unexpected that Draco frowned and stared at her in concern. Flushing with embarrassment, she swallowed and forced herself to continue.
Hermione sighed and leaned back against him. "But at the risk of inciting a faction war between the vampires and the veelas?"
Sure enough, when Draco managed to find a seat in the middle of all the spectators and reporters around him, he looked up and saw an uncomfortable-looking Aria (in her true form, with her hair up and her wings out) seated at the very middle of a long table that had been placed on a small, elevated platform in front of the Ministry fountain. There were a couple of older-looking veela women (also in their true forms) seated at the table on either side of her; and judging from their uniforms, Draco could only guess that they were all representatives from the Veela Affairs Department of the Ministry. Blaise's mother, Ilyana Zabini (the only veela at the table who didn't have any wings) was seated on Aria's right. She was currently instructing the group of Aurors standing in front of the crowd to keep the reporters a safe distance away from the platform.
"And the truth comes out." Draco sneered bitterly at her. "Did you have fun playing with me? What gives you the right to judge me like that? Who the hell do you think you are?!"
"Hmph." Pansy's scowl only deepened at his outburst and she turned her face away, nose high in the air as she crossed her arms petulantly across her chest.
"Pleased to meet you." Corey greeted him with a wide, toothy smile. "Wow, so you're captain of the Gryffindors? Do you think you'll stand a chance against Slytherin this year?" He asked in a loud, obnoxiously smug voice.
" Draco ignored the affronted expression on her face and purposely slammed his textbook shut, turning to the side to give the short-haired girl an irritated glare. "I don't give a flobberworm's ass about your latest lover's spat with Longbottom, okay?! Stop whining and just leave me the hell out of it!" He snapped.
"You're really close to your mother, aren't you?" Aria arched an eyebrow and gave him a knowing smile.
As Greg turned around and joined the rest of the Gryffindors, Aria caught a glimpse of Ron standing behind him. He looked as though he was in the middle of giving their team a pep talk, so Aria didn't expect him to notice her at first, but when he did, Ron winked and stuck his tongue out at her — and Aria responded by rolling her eyes and sticking her tongue out right back.
Corner shifted his feet a couple of times and stared cautiously at Aria, cowering under her intense, unblinking gaze. Finally, after a long moment, he took a careful step back and the hand he had gripping Pansy's arm loosened, allowing the short-haired girl to pull away from him.
"Speaking of which, you're the one who found the Chamber of Secrets right? Do you think you could still access it again somehow?" He asked, his eyes lighting up with barely concealed glee.
"Right, sorry." Aria grimaced and indulged the other girl with a sheepish grin. "So enlighten me for a minute here – why exactly are you so concerned about all this? I'm sure whichever gown you choose, Ernie will think you're gorgeous anyway. And if he doesn't, well, then he's an utter asshole and you should dump him." She pointed out, shrugging at her.
Draco smiled at her words and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her closer. He took one of her hands in his and placed a kiss onto her palm before slowly intertwining their fingers together.
Afterwards, as she glanced over her shoulder to thank the benevolent soul who had helped her out, she realized that the person sitting behind her was actually Pansy Parkinson
Other than that one time they took the same NEWT (which, ironically, was Potions) and she happened to be assigned to the seat behind his, Draco didn't get to see Aria much; and those few times he did manage to catch a glimpse of her, she looked surprisingly calm.
me?! Do you always make it your responsibility to save my life all the time?! Because it's not! You don't owe me anything! I'm not a fucking damsel in distress!"
Draco frowned and moved towards her, but when he passed by Fisher's bleeding, half-conscious form on the ground, the vampire glared hatefully up at him. He wiped the blood from his lips and gave him another mocking smile before reaching into the pocket of his coat.
When only a handful of students seemed to nod back at her, she frowned and paused to gather her thoughts. Fortunately, Granger's hand shot up into the air again and Fleur gestured for her to speak.
Draco winced and wiped the sweat forming above his eyebrow with the back of his hand. "For starters, does anyone know a decent enough flyer? One who has a basic knowledge of quidditch rules and gameplay, at least?" He asked halfheartedly.
into laughter at the exact same time Draco spat a whole mouthful of coffee across the table at a poor, unsuspecting Zach's face.
Unfortunately, his movement only seemed to draw Fisher's attention to the fact that Draco was still carrying Aria. All of a sudden, his hysterical blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits as they zeroed in on the arm Draco had wrapped snugly around Aria's waist.
"As long as the class is easy enough to pass without too much work, count me in." Ron chimed, causing both girls to give him a deadpan glare. He blinked and returned their expressions with an innocent smile.
Fuming with anger, Hannah shoved Macmillan away from her and spun on her heel, heading towards the opposite side of the hall. As she walked away, Macmillan snatched her arm again, but this time, Hannah retaliated. With a growl, she yanked her wand out of her purse and pointed it at his crotch.
Aria pulled him back up, dragging his mouth back to hers as she wrapped her legs around his waist. She bit down hard on his lower lip and arched her hips against his, deliberately making his erection slide between her legs and causing Draco to gasp and give an involuntary thrust against her.
There was a picture of Aria with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and another picture of Aria carrying a purple-haired baby (which Draco could only assume was his cousin, Teddy Lupin). He also saw a picture of Aria with Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, and a few more pictures of Aria with the rest of the Weasleys. Draco frowned slightly when he came across one picture of a young couple he didn't quite recognize, but after a few minutes, when he studied the photograph closer, he realized that they were actually Aria's parents, James and Lily Potter. The last picture on the shelf (the one that was obviously taken during their Yule Ball in 4th year) was one that Draco didn't particularly like seeing, because in it, Aria was smiling beside her date that night – none other than George Weasley.
. It was a way for me to reassure myself, and to give me enough courage to actually attempt a relationship with you."
So many secrets, insecurities, and misunderstandings that just came bubbling up to the surface. You see Aria (and Draco), this is why it's important to talk about these things. Not just make out and have sex lol.
"Hey, that's a great idea." Ron chimed in, looking up and giving both girls a pleading look. "Please, 'Mione, can we all take an elective class together this year? It gets really lonely in Gryffindor without the two of you around. I only have Seamus with me for company." He said glumly, his features creasing into a pout.
You got back pretty late last night. Morag and I were already asleep." Hannah spoke up, biting her lip as she glanced back and forth between the two girls with a cautious look on her face.
As the days went by, Aria was relieved to see that Hermione seemed to have adjusted well to her vampirism. Admittedly, the brunette
Draco's scowl only deepened at her answer. He continued to glare warningly at the people still watching them until Aria smiled and shook her head.
1. I'm so sorry this update took so long. I was actually supposed to update a week ago, but my laptop went all wonky just as I was in the middle of editing this chapter. I actually had to go back to the very first draft I wrote and I had to re-do all my edits from memory. It usually takes me a week to edit, so...yeah.
on the firewhiskey, coughing and wheezing several times as she tried to clear her throat. When she finally found her voice, she turned to Blaise again, staring at him with her jaw hanging open.
" Aria retorted as she leaned back and crossed her arms over her chest. "But if you did that, how else are you going to win the championship this year without your star seeker?" She pointed out.
"Oh that reminds me, we're still on for that study session tomorrow night, yeah? Reckon I may have a few subjects I need both your help with this year." He grimaced, a rueful look on his face.
"It's been more than 48 hours. If there were any side effects, I would have experienced them by now." Hermione snapped back at him.
As they neared the village exit, Draco noticed that a large group of drunken, boisterous men were coming from the opposite direction. Ignoring Aria's protests, he instinctively found himself walking around her and gently pushing her to the left so that
From the other end of the classroom, Megan Jones raised her hand and Fleur gave her an encouraging smile.
Blaise's eyes grew ridiculously wide at her words. "You actually suspected me?!" He blurted out, looking slightly offended as he glared at her. "And here I thought we had such a connection going here, Potter!" He added, scowling at her and letting out a dramatic huff.
Judging by the stone-faced, unimpressed look that continued to linger on Draco's face, she knew he didn't believe her.
Embarrassed at having been caught sleeping, Aria had turned to look helplessly at Hermione across the room but unfortunately, her best friend was sitting with the Ravenclaws and was too far away to coach her the answer like she usually did.
Aria was already stalking across the room towards the full-length mirror beside the teacher's table before Pansy had even finished her sentence.
He stared after her retreating form for a minute, blatantly enjoying the view. Though, the smirk on his face quickly transformed into a scowl when he noticed just how many of his male (and female) schoolmates around him seemed to be doing the exact same thing. Still scowling, Draco forced himself to shake his jealousy away before Aria could notice it through their bond, and he took that opportunity to glance around his surroundings.
Aria felt the way Draco's fingers tightened around hers in righteous anger at the last question (which, unsurprisingly, had come from Rita Skeeter). She was half-tempted to send another blast of magic at her when, to her relief, she heard another familiar voice call out to her from behind.
Aria was seething as she accepted his hand and used it to pull herself up from her seat. Ignoring the questioning looks she was receiving from Ron and Neville, she reluctantly began shoving her books back into her bag.
"What are you still doing here anyway?" Greg's voice was oddly laced with a hint of anger as he leveled Draco with a sharp glare. "Shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Astoria by now? It's incredibly rude of you to keep her waiting."
"It is a pleasure to meet you, Aria Potter." She smiled at her, and again, Aria blinked as she was taken back by how attractive she was. "My name is Ilyana Zabini, and I am here as an official spokesperson on behalf of the Department of Veela Affairs in the Ministry."
Apparently, despite the resorting and the fact that most of the former Slytherins were actually scattered into different houses now, the students from the other houses – most especially the first years – still had a tendency to disperse or move away whenever they saw someone in Slytherin robes approaching them.
Pansy was silent as she walked right up to her, studying the other girl up close with a knowing gleam in her eyes.
"I know exactly where you're going with that." Hermione cut her off, her gaze sharpening at the guilt in Aria's words. She shook her head and gave Aria a hard, chastising glare. "And I'm telling you right now, Aria,
He stifled another smirk when he saw the way she was avoiding his eyes, her entire form tensing every single time he got too close or accidentally (or in his case,
"Stop it! Can't you see that she's had enough?!" Draco's eyes flashed and he tried to grab Fisher to stop him but Fisher quickly twisted away from him and screamed out his next words.
"I didn't mean to gush about another girl in front of you." He rushed out, wincing in apology. "It was incredibly insensitive of me."
To his credit, Malfoy looked just as uncomfortable with her proximity as Aria felt, no doubt also thinking about how the last time they had spoken to each other was during their embarrassing little screaming match in the Common Room last night. From the way their housemates were staring at them, it was obvious they were all probably thinking the same thing. Hannah, in particular, was flicking her gaze back and forth between the two formal rivals in fear, almost as though she was expecting that either one of them would suddenly jump up and start hexing the other without any warning.
Draco smiled at her reaction and leaned in even closer, his lips brushing so gently against hers that the brief touch felt more like a very light tickle than an actual kiss.
He noted with fond amusement that Aria didn't look at all self-conscious about the fact that the first two buttons of the shirt she was wearing were undone or that the shirt ended only halfway down her legs.
"I think Draco is beginning to rub off on you." Blaise pretended to give her a petulant pout but Aria just rolled her eyes and ignored him.
He didn't bother waiting for either of them to answer before he turned and practically fled the pub, rushing towards the exit doors and slamming them noisily behind him. As soon as he was gone and they were the only two customers left inside, the girl beside him sighed and turned to give Draco an exasperated glare.
"You'll probably end up going straight to Azkaban. Without a trial, if I have anything to say about it." Aria continued in a nonchalant tone of voice, lowering her gaze to inspect her fingernails.
He lifted his gaze off the ground and blinked as he found himself staring into a familiar pair of green eyes. This time, however, there was none of the usual warmth or playfulness in them that he had grown used to over the last few months. Instead, the eyes he found himself staring into were blank and lifeless, and the sight of them made Draco's blood run cold.
, of all people, then he should be able to handle a few hours during the match. Besides, we're all up there with him anyway, we can keep an eye on him." He told her.
After a long moment, he looked up, suddenly feeling even more nervous when he saw four pairs of eyes — Aria's, Narcissa's, Andromeda's, and even Teddy's — all watching him closely.
Draco gulped and shrunk under her glare, his eyes wide as he stared at the way her fingernails were beginning to lengthen into talons. "We were in the library, and I really needed a book on Ancient Veelish from the Restricted Section. Morag got it for me, but obviously, she wanted something in exchange." He explained hastily.
filthier than Draco cared to admit) and when they broke apart for air, he lowered his head and spoke to her in a lewd whisper.
"I would, but you were the one who said we should take things slow." He teased, kissing the scowl that was forming on her face.
Draco chuckled and kissed her forehead, bringing his arms up and wrapping them protectively around her.
So good, in fact, that within the first few minutes of the match, they caught up to the 50-point lead Slytherin had fairly quickly so that the two teams were eventually neck and neck. Before Draco could come up with an alternative strategy to remedy this, the Gryffindor Beaters – Fisher and Jenson – suddenly took it upon themselves to begin aiming the bludgers directly at Draco, successfully incapacitating him for most of the game. And as he was their team's highest scoring Chaser, the lead between Gryffindor and Slytherin soon widened – a
When Hannah realized what she just did, she slapped both of her hands over her mouth in mortification and sank down low into her seat to hide her face. Pansy just closed her eyes and reached up to pinch the bridge of her nose, sighing in resignation as she watched Blaise collapse into his seat again, his shoulders shaking with laughter. As usual, Morag looked completely unaffected by all the attention they were getting from the other houses. Zach, on the other hand, looked as though he was still trying to figure out what was going on.
Please let me know if I need to raise the rating of this story because of this chapter btw. I really did try to keep things as innocent as I could, but my two leads wouldn't listen.
"By the way, if you don't mind my asking, is Blaise seeing anyone right now? And would you happen to know if he likes me? Romantically, I mean."
Draco blinked at her and looked away with a spiteful expression. "I suppose we'll see what the great Harriah Potter really believes tomorrow then, won't we?" He muttered bitterly to himself.
Draco traced his finger sensually along the curve of her neck, smirking when Aria closed her eyes and shivered at the burning sensation. Her breath caught in her throat and she felt the skin between her neck and shoulder where he was touching her break out into very tiny, tingly goosebumps.
"Well, I just—that is—" Astoria's eyes widened and she stammered a couple of times, clearly not knowing how to respond. "—well, does that really matter? I'm just going along with what's expected of me. Wouldn't you do the same thing?"
"Well at least Hermione'll be with you. Because I actually can't tomorrow night." Aria admitted, and she felt a tiny stab of guilt when she saw Ron's disappointed expression. "Zabini kind of invited all the new Slytherin 8th years to this little get together in Hogsmeade." She chuckled to herself and managed a halfhearted shrug. "Everyone had already agreed to it so I couldn't exactly say no without looking like a jerk."
Given that most of the classes of the graduating students were already wrapping up, Headmistress McGonagall then announced that she was giving the 8th years and 7th years the last week of school off before their graduation ceremony. She reminded everyone that, as much as possible, they should use the free days to attend to their applications and interviews for their chosen career paths.
Chuckling at the thought, he had just finished hanging the dress back up when the door to the closet suddenly swung open. Draco froze and slowly turned around, his eyes growing wide when Aria, with her hair piled loosely on the top of her head and wearing nothing but a fluffy white towel, strode into the closet.
Every now and then, Aria noticed that Malfoy would look up from his essay and stare suspiciously at her as though he wanted to ask her a question but when she glanced up at him, he flushed and deliberately looked away.
Groaning under his breath, Draco ignored the pain in his back and sat up slowly, watching as Bentley and Jenson finally managed to blink themselves out of their weird trance and scrambled back to their feet. The two Gryffindors looked confused as they stared questioningly at each other for a few seconds before turning their befuddled looks to Aria's hunched, hostile figure still curled on the ground.
"I wasn't making fun of you." He drawled, flicking his mocking gaze back and forth between Bentley and the nervous-looking Gryffindor boy behind him. "I wouldn't even waste my time on pathetic, insignificant
"Maybe she's just afraid to trust you because she's afraid of getting hurt." She whispered, her eyelashes fluttering as she lowered her gaze and stared at her hands. "She's probably been through a lot, and it's reasonable to assume that she's been taken advantage of one too many times already."
She took in Corey's ashen features, trying to ascertain for herself whether he was telling the truth. When he didn't relent and just stared back up at her with a genuine look of worry on his face, Aria's eyes narrowed and she shook her head.
for when she would be free and willing to meet him in Hogsmeade for dinner during their Holiday Break from school.
"It's not like that at all." Draco rolled his eyes at their teasing before he slipped himself into a pair of white nurse robes. "I was just thinking about how I'm going to miss this place. To be honest, I...really enjoyed working here with you all." He admitted, flushing in embarrassment at the fond smiles they gave him.
About an hour later, after Goyle admitted to Aria with a slightly sheepish smile that because of his large hands, he tended to mess up cutting ingredients, they agreed to switch roles. Aria took it upon herself to handle doing the precise measurements - weighing, cutting and peeling - while Goyle was in charge of adding in the ingredients and keeping up the heavy, continuous stirring of their potion while monitoring its temperature and consistency.
"That's exactly my point!" Draco snapped, his voice rising several levels in his anger. "Do you think it makes me happy knowing you were
"Well go on then, Potter. Do enlighten us further. I'm quite curious about your little seduction technique." Draco drawled, smirking slightly when he saw the irritated look on her face. "So what exactly happens next then? You seduce the guy – oh no, wait – like you said, you don't
Aria grimaced and opened her mouth to say something but Blaise just scoffed and waved her concern away. "He's really being a pissy little girl about this whole thing, isn't he? Don't let it bother you though. He'll probably confront you when he's ready to talk."
"Brilliant." Aria grumbled, looking resigned. "And since I'm unmated, how long will I have to stay in here?"
and she has the right to make sure that son of a bitch is punished for it! Who cares about whether he's a vampire or she's a veela or any of that rubbish—"
His mother hadn't been comfortable with the idea of Draco returning to school either and to be honest, if it hadn't been for the fact that Draco
"Don't forget. We still have to sign up for 6 units of those elective classes." He reminded her as they rounded a corner.
Draco laughed but didn't protest when she straddled him and furiously began unbuckling his belt, followed by his pants, until she pulled them both off, hurling them to the floor. She was just about to yank off his boxers when Draco suddenly rolled them over again, meeting the irritated look on her face with a cheeky grin.
Following his gaze, Aria was stunned when she realized that the reason Bentley was scowling was because Blaise and Draco had taken the liberty to sandwich her between them, shielding her from Bentley's view as they made their way across the hall. When they finally reached the Slytherin table and everyone sat down into their seats, Aria let out the breath she had been holding and looked up, giving both Slytherin boys a small, grateful smile.
As she passed by one of the room's full-length mirrors, she frowned when she realized that, in her haste to chase after Blaise after he had witnessed her embarrassing slip-up before practice, Aria had actually forgotten to charm the name 'Malfoy' off the back of her quidditch robes.
person I've ever met. Oh and plus, he lets me copy off his History homework too so I like him." He added, grinning at her.
Aria didn't notice him at first, too busy fiddling with her gloves as she stood by the doors, so Draco took that opportunity to just drink in the sight of her.
"Get away from her, Pans." Neville flicked his worried gaze briefly to the girl on the ground before he glanced back at Aria and pointed his wand at her, positioning himself into a defensive dueling stance. "I don't want to fight you, Aria. But I will if I have to. So just back away."
As Blaise got up to pay the bill, everyone else stood up from their seats and began pulling on their cloaks. Eventually, they all headed out of the pub and began walking down the road that would eventually lead them back to Hogwarts. Blaise managed to keep Zach upright by letting him hang off his shoulder with one arm while likewise, Morag kept a firm grip on Abbott's arm to support the other girl's balance.
The female reporter who asked the question stared at her in surprise. "You mean he hasn't accepted you yet? Why not?"
As Blaise snickered and exited the common room, Aria shoved Draco off again, rolling her eyes at the childish scowl on his face. He watched as she stepped away from him and began fidgeting with her hair and smoothing out the wrinkles in her gown.
"Lucky for you, I'm pretty stubborn; and I don't really listen to anyone." Aria reached up, caressing his cheek with her gloved hand until he opened his eyes. "You're stuck with me, Malfoy; because I'm not going anywhere."
While everyone was distracted, Aria quietly slipped away from the crowd and made her way up to the very top of the quidditch stands.
She hesitated, scuffling her feet against the floor, until finally, she let out a defeated sigh and looked up, giving him a slightly exasperated, albeit grateful, look.
As the 8th years were somewhat of an anomaly that year, it didn't make sense to have them resorted with the other students in the Great Hall. Luckily, the sorting hat remembers
He alternated the movements of his mouth from licking and nipping to kissing and sucking, using the sound of her moans and the urgency of her breaths as cues to guide his tongue to the right spots. It was an entirely new, learning experience for him, because he hadn't been lying when he told her that he had never done this before, but he soon realized that he
Beside her, Blaise was apparently strong enough to blink himself out of the trance as he leaned down to whisper something into her ear. "The strength of the allure is directly related to your emotions. You're making it worse. Just
Reluctantly, Draco deposited her into Ron's arms, taking great care to hide her broken wing from everyone else gathered around them. He frowned when Aria gave another muffled hiss of pain at the transfer before slinging her arms around Ron's neck.
"Gone but not forgotten, apparently." Aria drawled back as she stepped away and rolled her eyes at Wood's teasing comment. "What are you doing here? This isn't something quidditch related is it? Are you recruiting for Puddlemere?"
"I don't know, okay?" Aria finally growled, sighing in defeat. "Look, I know Zabini and Parkinson already know and it didn't bother me as much but it's just – Malfoy and I were at each other's throats for years! If he finds out that I'm a veela and he somehow discovers that my veela blood sees him as a compatible mate, he might – well, I don't know what he'll think! He'll probably be disgusted and
Her heart clenched at the hurt look on his face, but before Aria could say anything, Draco managed to force out a sad smile. He shook his head and reached out, taking both of her hands in his.
Aria ignored them and turned to Luna, properly acknowledging her for the first time since she joined them. "You look very pretty, Luna." She told her, admiring the other girl's deep blue gown. "Blaise isn't giving you any trouble, is he? He can be a bit of a prick."
As he walked around, he noticed that all of the rooms were painted with a bright, very clean shade of white. The walls of the flat that actually faced the outside were made entirely of tall, glass windows, giving the place an impressive, panoramic view of the surrounding buildings. When he stepped out into the small balcony in the living room, Draco was greeted with a beautiful view of the streets of Central London, particularly of Whitehall.
Aria's lips twitched at the way Hannah stared at her shoulders as though she half-expected something grotesque to come out of them.
Before either Lewis or Hannah could say anything else to tease him further, Draco took advantage of their momentary distraction to levitate his tray and quickly set off to get started on his patient visits for that day.
"Is that so?" The smile on Aria's face was positively serpentine as she leaned forward and folded her arms over the table. "It's also quite hypocritical of you, don't you think? Especially since, based off these records of ours—"
"The bond is actually already formed from Aria's side, but not from yours." Madam Pomfrey answered distractedly, and she gestured for him to lay his arm down on the table. "So you are, for all intents and purposes, her mate. And whether you affirm the bond or reject it, it won't change the fact that Aria's veela magic already recognizes you as such."
She stopped when Blaise nearly fell backwards in his chair from wheezing too hard in between his laughter. Beside him, Draco just cursed under his breath and shook his head, glaring at the other boy with an irritated look on his face.
Evidently, Theo seemed to be thinking the same thing because his lips curled upwards into a sideways grin as he stared at her, blatantly sweeping his approving gaze up and down her form.
"Oh joy, the Forbidden Forest. That's not dangerous at all." Pansy drawled sarcastically, reaching up to massage her temples.
Pansy blinked at her again, and she looked as though she had a hard time trying to understand Aria's words.
Aria waited until they were safely back down in the dungeons near the Slytherin Common Room before she turned to Corey, grabbing him gently by his arm and turning him around to face her. When he blinked up at her in confusion, Aria placed both of her gloved hands on his shoulders and bent down slightly so that she could peer into his face.
"Why?" Hannah frowned and glanced worriedly at the gowns in her hands. "What's wrong with them? Are they that terrible?"
of them, it didn't take him long to go through the entire collection. By the time he slammed the cover of the last book shut, Draco cursed in defeat and ran a hand through his hair, unknowingly disheveling the blond strands in his frustration. With a heavy sigh, he shoved the useless book back into its place on the shelf and jumped to his feet.
"Wait a minute. I'm confused." Zach interjected as he held a hand up and flicked his confused gaze back and forth between Draco and Aria. "Are we still talking about monogamous vanilla sex between you and Potter or monogamous vanilla sex in
"Malfoy, seriously." Aria let out an exasperated sigh and turned to glare at him, finally allowing him to see the genuine irritation seeping into her face for the first time. "It's not cute anymore. Will you grow up?!"
"You'll have to enlighten me about why you're making such a big fuss about this, Potter. Veelas are beautiful, powerful, and live unnaturally long, youthful lives with their mate. Most girls would kill to manifest as a veela like you." She pointed out bitterly.
"So…Any more common misconceptions?" Fleur briefly checked her watch before turning her attention back to the class. "I believe I still have time to answer a few more questions."
Five years ago, if someone had told Aria that she'd be strolling down a quaint muggle neighborhood in London, hand-in-hand with
Her veela blood was boiling hot under her skin, drugging her mind and overwhelming her senses with so much need and lust, that all she could even think about was how much she just wanted Draco to fuck her senseless until she broke in half.
"It's okay, I think I can make it back on my own." Neville noticed that they were beginning to clean up the table and stood up shakily, grabbing onto the top of his chair for support. "Just as long as nobody bumps into me on the way or anything." He added warily.
"Well fine then, Potter. Go on. Let's see what your brilliant 'hero' deduction skills have figured out, shall we? You think it was me, right? Despite the fact that I was just talking about how I didn't think those two boys did it, you now think it was me because I was the only one who didn't attend Blaise's ridiculous little drinking session that night?"
"Malfoy, you're welcome to continue hating me all you want. Nothing will change that." Potter answered stiffly, looking a little disgruntled by his comment.
"Careful!" Pansy snapped as she knelt down beside him, raising her wand to shine light into his eyes. "I think you have a mild concussion, you hit the back of your head pretty hard."
"We are, by no means, as flashy, hedonistic, or as extravagant as popular culture portrays us to be. So not to disappoint you all, but all those books that like to romanticize vampires by portraying us as gorgeous beings who like to spend their immortal lives in broody isolation? I'm sorry, but none of that is true."
The strange, hesitant tone in Pansy's voice made Aria pause and arch an eyebrow at her over her shoulder.
Aria barely noticed any of them, however, as Draco wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her closer. It felt like hours when they finally broke the kiss and pulled away for air, but Draco kept his eyes closed as he leaned down and pressed his forehead against hers.
As the two of them faded away into the distance, Draco let out the breath he didn't realize he was holding in and looked down, staring in confusion at his pale, clammy hands.
A few minutes after Blaise left, just as Draco was tuning out Hannah and Astoria's ongoing conversation across the table about wedding dresses, everyone suddenly looked up again and watched as George and Aria slowly made their way over to the small stage in the middle of the reception area. When they had everyone's attention, George and Aria both raised their wands and cast a Sonorus charm over themselves before they turned to address the crowd of guests.
Not surprisingly, the faculty wanted another round of questioning for all Slytherins, regardless of year level. This time, the consequences were more severe as the offense committed involved a case of assault. As Pansy explained, they found one of Gryffindor's prefects passed out cold in the Gryffindor Common Room. When they asked him what happened, he claims he couldn't remember anything other than being in a weird trance before he lost consciousness.
Draco glared up at her with a feral look in his eyes; and he sent a mental image to Aria through their bond — that of him manhandling her onto her stomach and
Aria could tell that Draco was a little drunk, if not tipsy, by his blown pupils and the way he was being more handsy than usual, but she didn't mind. They eventually pulled away before things got too heated, but Aria shivered when she felt Draco's warm hand climb up into her shirt, lazily groping and feeling his way around before eventually settling against her chest with all the smug, self-satisfaction of someone who was so unrepentantly sure of what was
"I—it's fine, it's just a scratch." Ron stammered, laughing nervously before he reached out and began trying to extract Aria from Draco's arms.
Draco suspected that it was Hannah he heard squealing and cooing at them, followed by the sound of a camera clicking a couple of times and Zach poking lightly at his head to check if they were actually there; but he was much too tired to open his eyes and snap at them.
A blinding flash of magic shot out from behind her, and Bentley was thrown backwards again; only this time, he let out an angry yelp of pain as he crashed to the floor a few feet away. Aria looked up to find a frantic Draco kneeling over her, his face turning white when he saw her partially severed wing.
Aria proceeded to give a full, detailed account of everything that happened that night, and Draco watched as all the reporters around him listened intently to her, scribbling everything Aria was saying into their gigantic notepads. Eventually, when Aria finished narrating her story and Ilyana Zabini opened the floor for questions, a tall, mousy-faced reporter sitting near the front of the assembly raised his hand.
She gave the older woman a comforting smile before looking over her shoulder and meeting Draco's gaze. His voice had caught just then and he remembered staring wordlessly at her, a million thoughts running through his mind but not one of them managing to make it past his lips. All he managed to do, in that moment, was to give her a shaky nod in gratitude. To his relief, Potter seemed to understand because she didn't do anything else except return his awkward gesture before she quickly excused herself and went on her way.
hearing this!" Neville suddenly blurted out, the tops of his ears noticeably pink as he stepped away from them and furiously shook his head. "Ugh, please stop talking about this in front of me! Aria's one of my friends, and I will never be able to look her in the eye again without thinking about everything you just said!"
"Look, Aria." Hermione looked troubled as she studied Aria's reaction. "I know he's your friend and I'm not saying he did it—"
Hannah's jaw dropped and she glared angrily at them, obviously annoyed by the unconcerned expressions on their faces.
He never saw the way Aria's features contorted with pain, or the way she clutched weakly at her chest as she watched him walk away.
had actually low-key insulted her, and irritation because the doe-eyed, pig-tailed girl hadn't needed to blurt out the obvious. "I'm just exhausted. All my professors have been brutal with their assignments so I've had to pull all-nighters all week." She snapped.
and her cheeks began to sag with long, heavy wrinkles. The elegant bridge of her nose gave away, followed by her thick, perfectly-styled blonde curls turning a dull, gray color as they began to straighten, hanging limply down her shoulders. It wasn't long before the rest of her veela enhancements began to fade away after that, revealing her age and exposing Skeeter's actual appearance.
"Wish me luck." He winced and managed a weak laugh."If I'm not there to meet you during breakfast, it's because Malfoy and Zabini probably murdered me in my sleep." He joked nervously.
"Intruding into your personal space." He raised his hand again, pressing his finger playfully against the tip of her nose.
"That makes sense, I suppose." Blaise agreed reluctantly and leaned back against his seat. "If that's true though, then the asshole responsible for what happened is probably proud of himself right now."
Aria and Goyle's face as he gestured for the two students to occupy the last table at the very back of the room. "Now then, once everyone has settled in with their respective partners, let's start. As always, you'll find all the ingredients you'll be needing at the back of the room—"
Wincing in pain, Draco pointed his wand at her again and tried to stun her but Aria just raised her hand, disarming him and summoning his wand into her palm. He watched in horror as her clawed fingers tightened around his wand, snapping it in half before she tossed the pieces to the ground by her feet.
reason she had looked at Pansy was to ask the other girl what she had been doing alone in the common room that night, knowing the answer know certainly didn't make Aria feel any better.
He was already on his way out, reaching for the doors, when Aria's next words forced him to freeze in place.
"No, she isn't." Draco countered fiercely, sneering to himself and shaking his head. "There are plenty of other veelas who were able to marry other men. Aria certainly doesn't have to 'settle' for me. I mean, look at
Oh and yes, I borrowed a line from the Crazy Rich Asians movie lol. And yes, I know Blaise's mother (according to HP Wiki at least) was hinted by JKR to have actually killed all of her previous husbands but I chose to ignore that for purposes of this story.
"Well, well. I do believe this conversation just got more interesting, ladies." Blaise suddenly spoke up, smirking as he leaned over the table to listen in on their discussion.
you are, actually. You think just because you were desperate enough to make the Chosen One your fixation, you're suddenly more deserving of her than anyone else?" Draco mocked loudly.
your parents are fussing over you and pushing you towards an arranged marriage with a man so much older than you? It's probably because no one
Honestly, in that outfit, she looked like she belonged on the cover of one of Blaise's racy magazines.
Potter's face had gone white at Draco's words and her green eyes were wide with shock as she gaped wordlessly at him.
Skeeter paused and her eyes positively gleamed as she tilted her head the side, shifting her gaze from Aria to Draco, Greg, and Neville.
Malfoy then?" Bentley asked again, his eyes growing dangerously wide as he reached out and grabbed Aria firmly by the hand to prevent her from walking away.
"Oh don't be so sensitive." Aria rolled her eyes at him, quelling his outburst with a dismissive wave of her hand. "It's not like you're the pinnacle of innocence, Blaise."
"Loathe as I am to admit it, the feeling seems to be mutual." He told her, causing Aria to chuckle at the grimace on his face. "My mother practically worships the ground you walk on these days. Did you know she recently subscribed to Witch Weekly because she heard they were doing a special feature on you next month?" He admitted grudgingly, making a face.
him." Neville blurted out, his eyes widening with realization. "You were the pompous ass who spent those first few meetings trying to convince everyone that Aria was a fraud."
the new Slytherin seeker. I just accepted the position this afternoon. It's quidditch, Bentley. It really isn't that big of a deal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm heading back to the castle—"
idiots, I suppose." Aria shrugged and answered her with a tired, self-conscious smile. "We both made some stupid mistakes; did some things, said some words we didn't mean and...we ended up hurting each other."
defense, I didn't ask to be put into Slytherin. I was just as blindsided about this whole thing as you were."
"Why don't we try learning something else? Something simpler?" Aria suggested after another hour of Corey failing to cast the disarming spell properly. "Do you know how to cast the stunning spell? I also find that to be exceptionally useful."
And by the third day, everyone was so clearly exhausted that some students (mostly Hufflepuffs and a few Gryffindors) had even stopped caring about their appearance altogether, walking mindlessly around the castle with uncombed bedroom hair, ruffled clothing, and dark, ugly circles under their eyes.
Potter's eyes were – so green and so unnaturally bright even behind her hideous glasses. The two Slytherins stared awkwardly at each other, unsure of how to proceed, before Draco finally lowered his gaze, gave her a stiff nod and stepped slightly to the side of the staircase.
By now, the smirk on Aria's face had widened considerably and one of her eyebrows had arched up as she gave Pansy a curious look.
"I didn't do it for you. I did it because I hate watching shit like that." Draco responded, scowling as he settled back into his original leaning position against the counter beside her and finished the rest of his drink. "You'd think that just because a woman is beautiful, it gives men license to lose their manners, act like a complete bastard and harass her." He muttered darkly under his breath.
Surprisingly, through the combined efforts of all the house prefects and the Hogwarts faculty, the investigation was resolved in a matter of days and the culprits responsible were identified.
nice, in theory, but to make things simpler, maybe I'll just remember not to sit in your precious throne again next time. Your Highness." She drawled.
"You are aware, Miss Potter, that the vampire community is pushing for a lighter sentence? They were able to prove Mister Fisher's fixation on you, after all, and they insist that his actions that night were simply the result of his growing psychological obsession towards you. Are you not worried about drawing any resentment from them?" She pointed out.
"You don't have to apologize for anything." Hermione rolled her eyes and gave Aria a fond, albeit slightly exasperated look. "We know you had to work some things out on your own first."
He had taken to wearing long sleeved sweaters these days, making sure to cover up the veelish symbols along the back of his wrist. With the current clangor of the wizarding world right now about Aria being revealed as a veela, and the dozens of articles that continued to be published everyday about who everyone thought her mate should be, the last thing Draco wanted was for the world to find out that their beloved Savior had unwittingly chosen a former Death Eater as her mate.
"So…" Draco shoved his hands into the pocket of his robes and stole a shy glance at her again from the corner of his eye. "Is there any chance I can see you again soon? Hopefully, in a better setting and not some dingy old pub. You know, assuming I'm not sentenced to rot away in Azkaban tomorrow." He quipped lightly.
As Potter finally disappeared up the tower and he began walking back down to the castle, he couldn't help but fall into a contemplative silence as he tried to figure out exactly
Aria rolled her eyes at their antics, sighing as she adjusted her position on the bed and snuggled herself down underneath the warm, thick blankets. After some time, once Ron and Hermione's arguments finally died down, Aria looked up and glanced at Hermione again. When the Ravenclaw gave her a questioning look, Aria reluctantly voiced out what she had been wanting to say ever since they arrived at the hospital wing.
"Don't get too excited, Mother." He scoffed, taking a sip from his tea to wash away the bitter taste in his mouth. "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you can forget all about your 'lovely veela grandchildren'."
"This is often a source of misunderstanding." Fleur looked troubled at Patil's words and shook her head. "As you all know, the famous veela allure is a bewitchment that entrances males and often puts them in a mindless, lust-induced trance. It is much stronger in unmated veelas, but a fair number of mated veelas have relatively strong allures as well. Yes, it can never be fully 'switched off', but it can be safely managed so as not to be anything other than a mild nuisance."
Luna sighed and gave Hermione a mildly exasperated look. "It's not really the alcohol that gets people intoxicated, you know." She pointed out.
As soon as he was gone, she blinked and turned to stare intently at Pansy. She noticed that Blaise was doing the same, a smug, teasing smirk already on his face as he arched an eyebrow at Pansy's flushed cheeks.
"Parkinson, how many times have you used an Unforgivable Curse?" Aria asked in a deceptively casual tone of voice, pausing in the middle of storing a set of mops back into a nearby cabinet to glance at Pansy from the corner of her eyes.
"I'm sorry for what happened back there. I…I should have controlled myself; and I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable." Draco began stiffly, and Aria couldn't help stifling a smile because he obviously looked very unhappy about having to apologize. "Anyway, I know that this – whatever this is between us – is a lot to take in. Especially since it's
it is used in a special incantation that is meant to force a veela in hiding to reveal her true form.
"Well—" Goyle grimaced slightly and shook his head, a guilty expression clouding his face. "—to be honest, I'm not really that good at Potions. The only reason I was accepted into this NEWT-level class is because Draco's always been my partner and he helped me get a decent enough grade. So I'm sorry if I end up becoming a liability or something. I promise I'll try really hard not to bring you down."
At the sound of Pansy's voice, all three boys looked up to see her lean back casually against her seat and lazily resume filing her nails. When she paused and looked up to see Draco frowning at her in confusion, she smirked and held up both of her hands in mock defense.
She saw a joint group of Ravenclaws and Gryffindors sitting near the entrance; and Morag and Ginny Weasley were among them.
They stayed in that position, nestled closely together as they watched the rest of the Slytherins still celebrating down by the field. Every now and then, they took turns drinking from the bottle of firewhiskey Draco had brought with him; and when Aria finished the bottle, Draco gripped her chin and turned her head to the side, pressing his mouth against hers so that the last few drops of the firewhiskey left a tingling, burning sensation on their tongues as they kissed.
Draco waited until the impatient scowl on Aria's face reluctantly melted away. As soon as he felt the way her body relaxed and grew pliant in his arms, Draco bent down and rewarded her with a quick, affectionate kiss.
"Given your track record at cheating death, I highly doubt it would have gone to your funeral." Pansy tucked her wand back into her pocket, watching as the pixie finally seemed to have grown tired of their antics and flew off, exiting the classroom through one of its open windows.
"Don't worry, it's here." Ron chuckled as reached into his robes and pulled out the said necklace, showing it to her. He turned to Hermione and gave her a wide, grateful grin. "I hardly take this thing off nowadays, it's incredibly useful."
When the two girls passed the Hufflepuff table, Draco noticed the way Pansy glanced at Macmillan from the corner of her eye. He wasn't surprised when, a few seconds later, a random jinx came out of nowhere and hit Macmillan square on the back, causing him to curse as he was propelled forward, spilling his hot tea all over the front of Mollie Davies' robes.
Ignoring the curious look on his face, she stopped them at the corner of a block and gave him a warning glare. "Wait here, I'll be right back."
her to do as she was told. Even now, as she backed away from Bentley's approaching form, that presence in her head only seemed to grow stronger and
Another one of those veela fics, you say? Well you’re not really considered an HP fanfic writer if you don’t have at least one veela fic in your collection right? Hopefully this one will be a bit different from the usual ones out there so I hope you stick around to see how the story unfolds. FYI, this story is also posted under my FFNet account. ;)
She screamed when he wrapped an arm around her neck from behind and pointed his wand at her throat. Blaise and Draco both froze, watching as Fisher tightened his grip around Pansy and dragged her along as he walked backwards away from them.
"You can't perform magic inside commercial establishments, Potter." Morag reminded her in an obnoxious tone of voice and with a firm shake of her head. "They'll kick us out if you do."
"Nothing." Blaise coughed and forced out a sheepish laugh, ducking his head behind his hand. "Anyway, it looks like it's about to rain. We should head back."
He blinked rapidly a couple of times and stared at her, a look of angry disbelief beginning to darken his expression.
"Pansy." Draco's eyes narrowed and he leveled her with a warning look. "I know you're hysterical right now, but I'm with Neville on this one. You can't just ask Aria to do something like that—"
"Yeah, I think so too. Having Angie around seems to give him the energy to get up out of bed in the morning. He's been coming over to check on the shop more and more too. Reckon it'll only be a couple more months before he's ready to open it up again. At least, I hope it will." Ron said softly, a small smile on his face.
"It's not really that interesting of a story." He muttered, shaking his head and giving her a strained smirk. "The day after I was conceived, my mom freaked out, dumped my father and ran away. By the time she realized she had feelings for him and that she was pregnant with me, my father was already in an arranged marriage with another woman."
