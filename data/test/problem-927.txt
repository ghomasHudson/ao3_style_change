Just as he was heading to see Dean, Harry’s eyes landed on Draco. He was wearing a crisp blue button-down, a light gray tie, and charcoal trousers to match. Harry was suddenly very aware of his over-sized muggle But I’m A Cheerleader hoodie that Hermione had gotten him for his birthday and his quidditch pajama pants. Draco was raising his brows in that stupid, sexy- erm, cocky- way that he loved to do, and Pansy was grabbing his arm and laughing and laughing and laughing like he just told the funniest joke in the whole wide world. She was wearing a short, sleek gray dressed that matched Draco’s tie. Her hair was freshy curled, her makeup expertly applied. Everyone was right- they really were perfect together. He felt seethingly, overpoweringly angry. He started to see red, which he didn’t even think was possible- he alwaays just assumed that was expression. He had to stop. What was wrong with him? Draco’s eyes met his, and he looked away immediately- he couldn’t meet his gaze.
“I-I’m sure there’s some residual cologne on my robes from yesterday. And you probably used lots of shampoo during your last shower, which is why I can still smell it.”
Finally back in his doorm room, Harry put his head in his hands and cried. God, he felt so dumb. The Boy Who Lived, the boy who’d stared death in the face and lived, who killed Voldemort, and he was crying over a boy. A boy who he hated, no less. It was exhuasting. Tears and snot got on the front of his hoodie- he was going to have to wash it later. Oh, this was embarassing. Secretly, he was glad no one had followed him. It was hard to explain, but he was an angry crier- ever since he was a little kid, he’d felt hot tears pinprick his eyes the minute he was shouted at. And it was really difficult to explain to friends and family members that no, he wasn’t sad, he was just angry.
Just as he stopped arguing, the realization hit him like a truck. Amortenia smelled like whatever you were the most attracted to. And he smelled Draco’s cologne after the potion had been brewed, which meant…
“God, you two are insufferable.” Ron joked, tying his tie. “You’re both the perfect, model students of your Houses. The faces of Hogwarts. And you hate each other! Wouldn’t it make perfect sense for you two to be friends?”
“...And that one’s Oreins’ belt. I’ve got no clue what it’s meant to look like, but hey, pretty cool, huh?” He pointed towards a line of three stars in the sky. Harry laughed, burying his head in Draco’s shoulder.
For a beat, Draco was silent. He looked at Harry in complete shock. To be honest, it scared Harry for a moment. He was used to Draco bullying him- when he was silent, he had no way of knowing what he was thinking. It was oddly unnerving. But in a blink, Draco had recovered, and was back to his usual, snarky self.
Draco’s eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. He mumbled something to himself, and used his right hand to rub the back of his neck. Harry realized, to his surprise, that Draco Malfoy, the king of Slytherin, the crowned prince of Malfoy manor, head Prefect, was embarrassed.
“There’s something else too, um… it’s…” Hermione also stopped talking, as the potion turned a lovely shade of scarlet. Harry noticed, to his shock, that Hermione was blushing as well. Even stranger, he noticed that the color of the potion perfectly matched the color of Ron’s hair.
“Oh, definitely. I’ve always wanted tupperware that makes me feel like a pretty princess.” Harry shot back, cradling the measuring cup as if it were his own child.
To his confusion, Harry couldn’t smell anything. He knew that they’d made the potion correctly, since it looked the same as everybody else’s potions, but he just couldn’t smell anything. Was he just not attracted to anything? Or had he and Draco secretly messed up the potion somehow?
The door opened, and students started piling in. Hermione gently squeezed his hand and smiled at him. “Good luck, Harry.” She then ran after Ron, who was already fighting a Slytherin over the golden cauldron.
“Bloody hell, Draco! You’ve gone and given me a damn near heart attack!” Harry bolted upright, hurriedly wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his sweatshirt. Fucking stellar. This night just couldn’t get any better. Here he was, bawling like a baby, and not only that, but his enemy had walked in on him. It was completely, totally, and utterly humilitating. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
“Funny. You know, that’s what every single Slytherin thinks about you… except Draco. He’s moved on, why can’t you?” he comfortingly clapped Harry’s shoulder. “Look. All I’m saying is, give the guy a chance, won’t you? I think you’ll start to realize he’s actually pretty nice.”
They arrived at the Slytherin common room, and Harry’s jaw dropped. In his entire time at Hogwarts, he’d never been in the Slytherin common room. And it was gorgeous. Gleaming, marble floors excellently complemented the dark oak furniture, and ceilings. The entire room was decorated with large clusters of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other precious gems. Silver veins flowed through the walls and floors, as if a river of silver was slowly moving through the room. It was a jarring shock, considering that the exterior of the Slytherin quarters was so ugly. It was a jarring stone dungeon, and inside it was a dark, damp corridor with rotten, wooden stairs leading into the basement, where one would find the Slytherin common room.
Ron threw his head back and laughed out loud. “You can’t, you can’t be serious…” he paused when he noticed Harry’s continued silence. “...Oh. You’re serious.”
When Draco’s lips met Harry’s, he felt fireworks. This was everything he’d ever wanted, and so, so much more. He’d only ever had one other kiss, and that was with Cho Chang during Spin The Bottle. He’d kind of assumed all kissing was like that- a short, methodical exchange that no party really benefitted from. This, however, was different. Draco’s lips were soft, and he could taste the slightest bit of cherry on his lips- chapstick, no doubt.
“The Slytherins say that it was Salazar’s choice. He knew that if the outside looked as pretty as the inside, then every other house would want to come over for parties, like we are right now. So to prevent that from happening, he made the outside as ugly as possible. Since, you know, Slytherins don’t like other wizards and all that good stuff.”
Harry felt heat rising to his face and neck, and realized, to his horror, that his face was now as red as the trim of his robes. “Yes, Sir.” He ducked his head down, trying to look anywhere but at Draco or his other classmates. Draco mumbled something similar and continued to look at the ingredients laid out in front of them.
His emerald eyes gazed into Harry’s. Looking closer, Harry noticed tiny, little flecks of silver swirling through the irises. Like the river in the common room, Harry mused to himself. Like the stars in the sky. Like the diamonds on the face of a watch, always spinning.
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair, massaging his scalp with his fingers. Harry shut his eyes and felt his entire body relax. This was nice. It felt so natural, as if they’d been doing this for years. Draco seemed to know just where to play with his hair.
He had no idea why the students watching were snickering, or why he saw a mildly impressed Hermione begrudgingly hand Ron two galleons.
“Why? Why?” Harry started laughing uncontroallably. “Because you’ve treated me like shit since the start of our years at Hogwarts, that’s why! And because you refused to shake my hand on the first day.”
Draco started laughing as well. “Really, Potter? That’s why you hate me? I was a kid. My dad hated you, for God’s sake. I was TRAINED to hate you. And I’ve apologized consistently. You don’t have a problem with any other witch or wizard at Hogwarts, so there’s got to be something else going on. So tell me- what is it? Why d’you hate me?”
He took in the sights at the party. In a corner, Gryffindors and Slyhterins alike took turns swigging fire whiskey. The Hufflepuffs seemed to be… baking something? Whatever it was, he saw the delicate wave of wands and smelled something so delicious that his stomach growled immediately. Proudly, Hufflepuffs removed light, airy, pink pygmy puff macarons from the oven. He’d have to get some later. Half of the Ravenclaws were setting up a board game that looked too complicated and boring for Harry to care about, while the others were arguing over what to watch on the Wizard TV. One of the Muggleborns had introduced them to Netflix, and things had never been the same after that.
“Finally, add the moonstone. Be careful- this stone is incredibly potent, fragile, and expensive. If you drop it, it’ll be a whole year of detention- and you’ll be paying out of your pocket.”
“Hmm?” he turned to see Luna Lovegood, dressed extravagantly in a scaled dress that kept shifting sapphire, ruby, emerald, violet, and any other dazzling colors it could pick up on in the room. It was as if the dress had a mind of its own. It was exquisite,
“I am! First impressions are very important, you know. It set the tone for how our interactions would be for the rest of our years at Hogwarts- him being a prick to me, and me firing back.”
Seamlessly, Draco strode over to Harry. He sat down and grabbed his hands. His hands were warm, soft. He must’ve been using a magical hand lotion of some sort.
“Potter, I think you need to lay off the fire whiskey, because I didn’t put on any cologne this morning.  And for the record, it is VERY expensive. 100 galleons a bottle!”
“Hey, Harry.” He felt a hand clap his shoulder, and nearly jumped out of his skin. Casting out his wand, he turned around sharply, only to breathe a sigh of relief when he realised it was Ron.
Slowly, and delicately, as if he was putting moonstone in a cauldron, Draco pushed one of his hands into Harry’s hair, so that four of his fingers were in his hair and his thumb was resting elegantly on Harry’s earlobe. Then, with all the care and prudence Draco could muster, he closed his eyes and leaned into Harry. The smell of his cologne flooded Harry’s senses. It was oddly woody, and he detected hints of vanilla in its undertones. It smelled amazing.
“I’m pretty sure most of them know. What can I say- we DO have undeniable chemistry.” Draco teased, elbowing Harry’s side.
Snape read out the names of each pair as Harry walked in. “Granger, Weasley… Finnigan, Thomas... Potter, Malfoy.”
But veritaserum didn’t care about secrets. All it cared about was the truth. All the emotions he’d felt since fifth year started pouring out, and he wasn’t sure how to stop him. Maybe he didn’t need to. It was oddly cathartic, this release. And if the person who had to experience them was Draco, then so be it.
With that final, lovely thought, Harry felt himself start to nod off, before he finally fell asleep, nestled deeply in the Head of Slytherin’s arms.
Draco’s mouth dropped. He knew Hermione was a good person, but he hadn’t expected it all to be so easy. Still, doubt creeped in his mind. What would his father think? Him? Befriending a gryffindor, a mud-muggleborn gryffindor, no less? He’d hate it. But, in fairness, Draco already hated his father, so the feeling would finally be mutual. With a confident smirk, Draco returned her handshake. “Friends.”
They landed in an open field, the soft blades of grass silver in the moonlight. Draco laid on the grass, and wrapped Harry in his arms. They stayed in the field for the whole night, while Draco pointed out different constellations to Harry.
Harry’s mouth opened, and he forced it shut. He hated Draco because he was an aarogant bully who couldn’t get himself sorted. That’s all he needed to know.
“Hermione, I just want to say… I’m sorry. The ways I treated you from our first to third year were not only wildly offensive, but also inappropriate. I now understand the weight behind the slur ‘mudblood’, and I apologize for my prejudice and undeserved bullying of you. You in no way have to accept this apology, but I can’t handle the guilt weighing on my conscience for much longer.” Draco fiddled with his thumbs awkwardly, waiting for Hermione’s response. The first three years at Hogwarts had been, to put it bluntly, shit. His dad had been awful. Always putting pressure on him, comparing him to the infamous Boy Who Lived. He might’ve hated Potter, but even Lucius had to admit that his magic practice was extraordinary. And to see Hermione in his Potions class, every day, always doing better than him even though she hadn’t had magical relatives training her for years. Still, that didn’t excuse any of his actions. And he was tired of her, Weasley, and Potter looking at him like a villain. All he could do now was stare at the genius, curly-haired witch in front of him and wait. He could almost see the gears turning in her head, grinding, pondering, calculating.
“Well, I guess we can wait for a bit, huh?” he was excited to tell everybody, but he also didn’t feel the need to shout it from the rooftops- not yet, at least. He would tell Ron, though. And Hermione. And Dean. And Seamus.
After many minutes of tripping over his feet and cursing out the moving staircases, Harry finally made it to the Potions classroom.
Draco flew so high in the air that Harry could almost reach out and touch the stars. The wind whipped his face, and Harry laughed, and laughed, and laughed. The wind tussled Draco’s once-combed hair, turning it into a mane of pure starlight. Harry felt on top of the world, easily the best he’d felt in a while.
Harry clenched his fists. “Really, Draco? Maybe if you hadn’t doused yourself in your awful cheap cologne this morning I would be able to smell this potion,” he snapped.
“Potter, I want to talk to you.” Draco cleared his throat awkradly. He fiddled with his tie, his fingers moving up and down the knot. Was he… nervous? No. Couldn’t be. He was never nervous. “I know that you don’t like me very much. I’d just like to know why.”
“You are the worst, Potter.” Draco murmurred, smiling into the kiss, his arms still wrapped around Harry.
“Draco. You’re right. How you treated me in those first years was completely unacceptable. However, I’m tired of hating you. You seem like you’ve genuinely changed. And plus, with your ambition and killer wit, I’d think we’d make a pretty stellar team. And don’t worry about Weasley- he’s a bit too protective, but he has the best intentions in his heart. I’ll talk to him about it, and you’ll be totally forgiven in no time flat. So, I suppose what I’m saying is, in summary, I accept your apology. Friends?” Hermione stuck out her hand, which hung in the air like a question.
“Awesome! Let’s go get ready! It starts at Eight, so we’ve got plenty of time.” Ron started heading back to their dorm room, and Harry, although still anxious, followed right behind him.
“Right. See ya then.” He waved goodbye to Ron before heading towards the fizzing, blue liquid in the punch bowl. He eagerly ladelled it into his cup before taking big, confident sips. It was delicious. It slowly and easily flowed down his throat. It tasted like blue raspberry, but there was some magical ingredient that kept it fizzing on the tip of his tongue. He mused to himself, wondering what the element could’ve been.
“-Malfoy, Potter, please stop flirting.” Snape scolded, turning away from the chalkboard. “Take notes of the ingredients we’re going to be using. Don’t bother looking in your textbook- you won’t find the instructions in there. You’re going to have to rely on my instructions and nothing else. Paying attention is of the essence. Do I make myself clear?”
“Woah, hey, easy.” Ron said calmly, raising his hands above his head in an innocent gesture. “I know you’ve had a shitty day, so if you don’t want to go, that’s alright, and I’ll stay in our room with you, but there’s a big party tonight in the Slytherin common room. All the houses are going to be there, and it’s Saturday tomorrow, so you’ll get to sleep in. Plus, some socialization- and some pastries- may be just what you need to cheer you up.”
“Can’t remember.” Harry finally got out of bed, throwing a robe over his pajamas. He was too tired to get changed. They were Seventh years now- he could dress however he pleased. And plus, all the teachers seemed to think they were heroes for being students during the Wizarding War and what not. He knew for a fact he would be fine in every class, he’d just have to pull his robe closely to himself during charms.
Oddly enough, Harry hadn’t found himself very distracted with emotions lately. His focus had been more on lessons with Dumbledore, with how to take down Voldemort, with the rise of death eaters and the possibility of Draco having become one of them.
The figure took a few jerky steps, as if to get away from the item, and rose suddenly into the air. Only once she’d risen to a hovering point in the air could Harry tell who the figure was, shaking and afraid with her eyes and mouth wide open. It was Katie Bell.
"Yeah, obviously." Harry said. Now slightly disgruntled, he tried to brush aside the thoughts from before. Draco wasn't even someone to identify with, much less to protect. And since when has he thought of him by his first name? No matter now, there were plenty of other things on his mind, plenty of other things to take his mind off of Malfoy.
The owlery was empty when they arrived. Pansy finally let go of Draco’s hand and went searching for her owl. Draco spotted Ulysses easily; he was probably the biggest owl in the entire owlery. Before handing the majestic bird his letter, Draco found a bag of owl-feed. He scooped up a few pellets and held it out for Ulysses to eat. The owl cooed; a slow, deep sound. When he finished eating, he held his beak open until Draco placed the letter there.
Maybe these nightmares mean something, Draco thought as he buttoned his shirt. He pulled his jumper on and went into the small bathroom adjacent to his, Crabbe, and Goyle’s room. Normally, first years didn’t get to choose a room, but all those years ago Draco had bribed another boy into giving him the room. Having the sink and mirror right there had been very helpful since he had arrived at school this year. Now, as he brushed his teeth, he avoided looking in the mirror, not wanting to see what he had seen in his dreams. When washing his face, however, he dared to look at his reflection.
Since coming to school Draco continued to have nightmares, but as the months went on, Potter had become more and more a part of them. It was unsettling. Sometimes Potter would be there, taunting Draco over his failure, but other times, he was just sitting there, innocently watching as Draco’s parents were tortured. And other times… Draco didn’t care to recall the other times. When his unconscious mind had shown Potter as someone he should care for.
“What’s wrong, Draco?” said Pansy, sitting down beside him. Greenish light filtered in from the window, causing Pansy’s face to look sickly. She looked down at his potions book. “Potions homework?”
“Bonkers,” Ron finished. “That’s the word you’re looking for. It’s a bit much if you ask me, going around giving people love potions. And how the hell do you keep it up, someone’s bound to notice if you keep slipping potion in someone’s drink.”
They were sort of similar when it came down to it, at least more than they had been before. Before Draco had been spoiled and bratty and able to get away with anything he wanted to. Now for the first time he was dealing with more human problems closer to what Harry felt. They both had responsibilities imposed on them in order to keep the people around them safe. They were different sides of the same coin.
What had shocked him most though was that, after attacking Ogden, Marvolo had gone after his own daughter. On account of her fancying a muggle. Merope had been incredibly unstable due to how she grew up, which is why Dumbledore had suspected she gave Tom Riddle a love potion to make him stay with her.
Someone knocked at the door a couple times, and the door opened before he could respond. “Have you seen my scarf?” Ron said, stepping haphazardly through the mess of belongings strewn around the floor. “It’s getting chilly out, and Hermione’s whining about dressing for the weather or something.” Harry shook his head, only half listening.
“I’ve decided to stay at Hogwarts for the break. I’m sorry to disappoint, but, of course, that means I can’t come for tea.”
Draco found himself in a dark gray hall with stone walls. He walked forward, and the walls began to morph into thick metal bars. Shadowy figures loomed around him.  At the end of the hall was a man, dressed in dirty, torn clothing, his usually shiny, silky blond hair knotted and matted to his head. He was crouching on the ground, his face hidden.
“Ah… I suppose so, but Ulysses was trained to carry letters in his beak. It would be difficult to re-train him.” Pansy’s shy smile turned into a light smirk. “What?”
Harry wasn’t sure just what he’d tell McGonagall yet, but he knew what he wasn’t going to mention. There was no reason for Draco to have cursed Katie Bell, no understandable motive. And even if he had other plans, all this questioning would cause him was unnecessary pressure. He hadn’t even been there.
“I guess that makes sense. Maybe you won’t be so stressed after, then. Once you get those things done.” She hesitated before continuing with, “And then we can spend more time together.”
It’s fine, he thought. I’ll just learn how to brew it. It shouldn’t be that hard, right? He took out his potions book as he sat down in the common room. He groaned when he read that the potion would take six months and was highly difficult to make correctly. Of course, the one potion he needed was one of the most difficult to brew.
He started towards the door to meet Hermione in the common area, then stopped to mention one more thing. “Hey, Ron? There’s some spells written in the margins of that book, I managed to figure out how to perform one of them. Levicorpus. I’m gonna give it a try before we go.”
Sleep did the exact opposite of what Draco had hoped. His dreams had been filled with visions of his failure at his task, the Dark Lord punishing his family further than ever, and Potter’s face tauntingly watching it all happen.
For nearly two hours, Draco sat in the common room, pouring over his potions books. Perhaps there was something else that could be even more useful than Felix Felicis. It wasn’t until the soft chatter of people around him faded that he realized just how long he had been sitting there. Everyone had left for dinner.
Of course, as he walked back through the common room, Pansy and a few of her friends returned from breakfast. She was looking over at Draco, slightly worried but mostly embarrassed while her friends poked her and laughed. Finally, Pansy said something to them and they scurried off like mice. She watched them go before turning back to look at Draco once more. She motioned for him to come over. Not wanting to upset her more than necessary, Draco took a few long strides and was at her side.
Ron and Hermione talked about the new joke shop, and he tried to nod along and comment every once in a while. Occasionally, he would even turn to say something to Neville, who was attempting to make conversation with Luna from across the house tables. But still, it was frustrating how easy it was to slip into the dull roar of the banquet hall.
"You sure you don't need those healed?" She asked. "It's not that difficult a spell, honest." Harry shook his head, wincing a little at the sharp pain.
“Draco, there you are,” Pansy said. She planted a light kiss on Draco’s cheek, much to his dismay. He was grateful for her help with getting rid of the huge bags under his eyes, but he was still trying to avoid the inevitable. He wished he could just love her. That would make things so much easier. “Where were you? Crabbe and Goyle said you never came back to your room.”
This insight into Voldemort’s family history made his drive and intentions clearer, but as of late it hadn’t served to bring Harry any closer to taking him down. All it had done was confuse him further.
“Any reason we couldn’t have come here after a bit of Butterbeer?” Harry asked her, glancing around to look for the sugar quills.
Draco subconsciously noted the effect of the bruises on Potter’s face made him look quite dashing. He had started to notice the boy's good looks last year, but the marks seemed to amplify them... He cursed under his breath.
Draco sat down beside his fellow Slytherins. Beside their table were four Ravenclaws, and across from them was a Hufflepuff and Potter, Weasley, and Granger. Various potions were setting fumes into the air. One scent in particular caught Draco’s attention, as it was the most pleasant of the bunch, although he couldn’t tell what it was. On the Slytherin’s table was a vial of a clear liquid that seemed to be boiling.
And now that Draco probably had the added pressure of the safety of his parents, what with his father in Azkaban, Harry couldn't help but― if only just a little bit― sympathize with him in some way. His gaze wandered slightly from Ron and Hermione across from him, his vision shifting focus, and looked instead to the boy in question.
Professor Slughorn began to speak, asking who knew of the potions on each table. Granger was instantly able to answer.
Surely he'd done bad things before, and there was no doubt his parents would be up for something like that. But did Draco, whiney and stuck up Draco, sensitive and over emotional Draco Malfoy, really have it in him to be a loyal follower of Voldemort? And why? The only thing he was absolutely certain of was that Malfoy was a death eater.
His skin was even grayer and oilier than before, and a few pimples had popped up on his forehead. Frowning, Draco pulled out his wand and tried casting a spell to get rid of them and, thankfully, they got a bit smaller. Unfortunately, the spell did not work on the huge bags that had formed under his eyes. He sighed, knowing there was nothing he could do about them, and instead focused on scrubbing more soap onto his face in an attempt to make his skin less oily. Satisfied with his weak skincare, he slicked his hair back and went into the common room.
He only had a vague image of what Tom Riddle Senior had looked like, but he couldn’t help but think about what it must have been like to have him as a father. And Merope’s side of the family was a far cry from rational or respectable. The idea of such a strangely cobbled together family didn’t make up for who Voldemort became, but it set a base for some of his ideologies.
Sighing, Draco continued to walk, but he heard someone else’s footsteps. It could only be one person. There was only one person who could follow him without being seen.
“That’s better. I don’t know why you do that. It’s silly. We’re friends, aren’t we?” She had come to stand next to him, ready to walk back to the Slytherin common room. Draco avoided her gaze. He didn’t feel like he could ever be friends with Pansy. She was sweet, sure, but how could he be friends with someone who he was forced to be with.
“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” Ernie Macmillan said, pointing. Draco leaned forward to see the cauldron on Professor Slughorn’s desk. It looked like liquid gold.
“Not particularly, I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t empty handed in case we were supposed to bring something to the Christmas Party.”  There was probably no need of course, Slughorn wouldn’t expect everyone to bring something. But a couple more party favors wouldn’t do any harm. Harry grabbed a couple of extra candies and was about to meet Ron at the counter when Hermione stopped him. “Have you thought about the party much recently?”
No more than 5 meters ahead of them two figures had frozen in their tracks, their faces hard to see through the array of snowflakes. The longer haired one, most likely the one who had screamed, shook and dropped something from their hands. Reflexively, Harry reached to his pocket for his wand, Ron and Hermione most likely doing the same.
Harry stopped in his dorm room before leaving for the day. He’d planned to visit Hagrid later with Ron and Hermione, just to make sure he wasn’t still sore about them dropping care of magical creatures. And Hermione had mentioned stopping in Hogsmeade for some fresh air before going back to study. It was the weekend, and other than Quidditch practice he didn’t have much to do, unlike Hermione, who’s workload seemed to be boiling over even more than when she used the time turner in year three.
This was written by 2 high schoolers, we've been working on this for a while and we're fairly proud of how it's turned out. Disclaimer: None of the characters or world-building are our creative property, they belong to our Lord and Savior Daniel Radcliffe because fuck jk rowling :)
Draco glanced in the mirror. Already, there was the slight appearance of grayish skin below his eyes. He silently cast a spell to make them less apparent. Surely people would notice them if he didn’t.
“Good. Now let’s see what we can do to make sure you don’t look like a ghost. I have a cream that can help to make your skin less oily, and maybe help with those bags under your eyes.”
It was light outside by the time Draco woke up, blinking. How long he had been asleep, he had no idea, but he felt even more tired than before. He stood up and rubbed his back, which had become very stiff.  He looked around briefly, grabbed his robes, and left, making sure to be careful as he exited.
There were a couple interesting spells written in the margins of the pages and he wanted to mess around with them to see what they could do. As he took down notes on a separate page about pronunciation and wand motions, his thoughts wandered.
By the time the tears stopped flowing, Draco was exhausted. He wanted to keep working on the cabinet or the potion, but he couldn’t keep his eyes open. He drifted off into a nightmare.
Draco looked back down at his work, realizing he hadn’t stirred it yet. He stirred clockwise two times, then added the slimy sloth brain. He stuck his tongue out as he did so and quickly wiped his hand on a damp towel. According to “Advanced Potion-Making”, the mixture should have been a deep purple color at this stage. Draco peered down, noting that it was more of a dark blue than purple. Next, he chopped up the Sopophorous beans into small pieces and squeezed their juice into the cauldron.
“Father?” Draco cried, walking faster now. His father was farther away than he thought, and soon he was running, hoping to reach him. He was only a few paces away when the stone and metal shifted, forming a circular room, he and his father at the center. Draco spun and saw hundreds of people in the cells around him. They came closer, reaching through the bars as if to touch him. Draco looked at their faces.
There was a thud behind him. He turned around to see Weasley sink down to the floor and come back up holding his heavy wooden spoon. Draco rolled his eyes, wondering how anyone so incompetent could ever have gotten into a sixth year potions class. As for the other two in the trio; Granger was certainly good enough, as much as he hated to admit it; Potter, on the other hand, was a mystery. Draco and his goons had always sabotaged him, and his potion-making skills were more or less unknown.
Draco ended up in the Room of Requirement instead of his dormitory. He wanted to work to get his mind off of what he’d just done. Since when was he willing to let Potter go unscathed, after he was spying?!
"Funny no one's asked yet," Ron quipped, mouth full of chicken. "Thought everyone would be dying to know what went down. Wonder what would happen if word got out that bloody Draco Malfoy did it."
Dumbledore had been even more evasive with his words than usual, almost showing weakness. Especially in bringing Harry along to contact Slughorn. Sometimes it was hard to remember that there was a method to Dumbledore's madness; that's all it felt like sometimes. Madness. And madness wouldn't do anyone any good for the inevitable fight against Voldemort. He rubbed absentmindedly at the bruises on his face, drawing queries from Hermione.
Upon arrival at his dormitory, Draco immediately changed into his silk pajamas and closed the curtains on his four poster bed. He didn’t want to stay up talking to his roommates. Despite this, he listened to their quiet mutterings until he felt the lull of sleep come upon him. He let himself drift off. Sleep would clear his mind.
Suddenly, hundreds of owls flew into the Hall, their hoots filling the crowded room with even more noise. One particularly majestic creature landed in front of Draco, a letter in its beak. It was his owl, Ulysses. Draco had never been very fond of the owl, and left him to stay at home mostly. “Thanks, Ulysses,” Draco said after the bird dropped the letter in front of him. “Go to the owlery. I’ll need you to bring my letter back to Mother.”
Multiple times that night, Harry found himself staring into the endless pool of butterbeer in his goblet. Sure it was the start of the year banquet, but it was hard to enjoy himself with so many things he had to deal with.
Katie dropped to the ground with a thud after only a few seconds went by. She landed in the snow, seemingly passed out. After coming to his senses, Harry thought to rush forward and see if she was okay when he heard a voice behind him.
Draco bristled at the mention of his weakness. “What does it matter to you?  I need to go to the library. I’ll see you later.” He stood and started to leave.
It had been the night after he and his mother had gone to Diagon Alley, he realized. Potter had walked into the shop while Draco was getting new robes. He remembered vividly how it was then that he’d first really regretted the mark on his arm, how disgusted Potter had been. Draco assumed Potter had seen him avoid showing his arm to Madam Malkins.
Quick tw for drinking just cause it's the holidays, a few characters get drunk but it's not too bad. This chapter is one of our favorites other than chapter 6 (can't wait to post that) So I hope you like it!
As much as he wanted to hold practice with the new team all together, his head was too cloudy to focus on participating in a practice, much less leading one. At Ron’s suggestion, he’d decided to try and take the rest of the day easy, maybe even go visit Hagrid. Although it was hard to breathe easy with the anticipation of more private classes with Dumbledore, with both curiosity and dread lingering in the back of his mind.
McGonagall would no doubt be questioning them to find out who’d placed the curse and why. It could just have been a practical joke or a first year magical mistake, but the chances of it being far more dangerous than that were high.
“I mean have you thought about who to invite?” Harry frowned a little. He hadn’t given much honest thought to it, Christmas still felt far into the future. But it was worth deciding earlier. Afterall, getting his date out of the way would avoid unnecessary drama, which everyone seemed to be wrapped up in at the moment.
“I really can’t. I have a lot of homework to do before Quidditch practice.” She was starting to get on his nerves.
Three Broomsticks didn’t fail to brighten their mood, to no one’s surprise of course. At first Hermione had sworn off the Firewhisky, but decided on a sip or two after Ron had some. They had talked about classes and friends and drama of all sorts, complaining about everything from problematic Slytherins to excess homework to professional Quidditch. The pub was bustling with customers due to the cold weather and the warm atmosphere of the shop.
He was walking past an alcove, staring at his well-shined shoes, when he heard a faint, “Draco?”. He thought he must have been hearing things and continued. Suddenly, his arm was pulled back by someone’s hand. It was Pansy. Of course.
Quidditch this year was going to be much more time consuming than before, Harry thought to himself as he looked out at the team he’d chosen. Tryouts had been a pain, especially since some of the students trying out weren’t serious.
“Potter,” Draco said through his teeth, sending a jolt of a spell at the spot where the prat must be. Sure enough, the invisibility cloak flew off, revealing him. “I would say you’re better than this but we both know that’s not true.”
"Harry?" A voice said, snapping his focus back to the table. Ron pointed to his still full dish he'd been poking his fork at for the past ten minutes. "You gonna eat that?"
“I figure that I can focus more time on some things that I haven’t been able to do with classes and Quidditch going on.”
It had been quite a while since school had started, and Draco still hadn’t made much progress on the vanishing cabinet. His skin had slowly become more and more grayish in tone, and he had lost weight. He had tried using spells to make himself look healthier, but they hadn’t worked. When his fellow Slytherins asked why his skin was so gray, he would come up with excuses, which they begrudgingly believed.
“I haven’t decided yet.” For a moment he worried maybe the reason she was asking was to go with him, but his fears were reassured instantly.
“S’pose you’re right.” Grabbing a last couple of sweets, Harry started towards the counter, turning to face Hermione while he walked.
A blinding light burst through the dark figures and the cold receded. Draco rolled onto his side, exhausted, seeing a faint, blurry figure with it's wand out, the light streaming from it. Before he could look any closer, he was forced to stand. Before him was one last dementor, but it wasn’t a dementor, was it? No, it was something even worse. The tattoo on Draco’s arm began to burn as Voldemort, wielding two X-shaped pieces of wood with strings attached, began to play with his limbs. The strings were tied around his wrist and ankles, neck and torso.
It had begun to snow by the time they started the long, scenic walk back to Hogwarts. It was warm enough that it didn’t stick much, but heavy enough to cloud their vision of anyone walking ahead of them.
For some reason, a quick pang went through his heart for Draco, one he'd felt often towards others. Like the strangest strong urge to protect him from whatever he was facing…
Finally, he stirred the mixture counter-clockwise seven times. It should have been slowly becoming a lilac shade, and then completely clear, but it only became a slightly lighter shade of blue. Draco ran a hand through his hair, which had begun to lose it’s usual perfection in the humid air, knowing he hadn’t produced a proper Draught of Living Death.
Draco resisted the sudden urge to laugh. “You’re lucky that I’m not in the mood to kill you.” He put his wand back in his pocket.
“Oh. That’s alright. If you need help making the schedule…” Ginny  trailed off nervously, tilting her head to the side. Harry watched her bright red hair spill over her shoulders a little. He’d never paid the color of her hair much mind because it was so similar to Ron’s, but hers was much brighter. And more well kept, though the bar wasn’t that high. Just briefly, he pictured running his hands through her hair, through the tangles all the way down to the end. But something was off.
As he walked out of the Great Hall, a few Slytherin seventh-years passed him and nodded in his direction. Draco repeated the gesture. He continued to walk, trying his best to hide his frustration at his mother and his whole situation. Around him, the people in the paintings relaxed in the morning sun. The halls were quiet. So quiet, in fact, that Draco could hear the sudden voices of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley coming his way. And wherever those too were, Potter would most likely be with them.
Draco was sad to see them go, if only because he was now effectively alone with Aggravated Pansy. It wasn’t as though they would have been helpful if they were there. She motioned for him to sit next to her, and he reluctantly did so.
Seething, Draco passed the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables to reach the doors. He scanned the Gryffindor table quickly, looking for Potter but also wary about seeing him. He wanted to avoid the Boy-Who-Lived as much as possible after the night before. He was still wholly upset with himself about that. Thankfully, he did not see Potter’s tousled black hair or big green eyes sitting at the Gryffindor table.
Draco opened the letter. It was not very long, but he found comfort in reading his mother’s handwriting. It was written in a dark, purply ink.
And then someone was calling for him, so Draco whispered one last thing and kissed Potter’s head before standing and floating away.
Draco perked up. That was exactly what he needed! He would have to learn how to brew it… Hopefully it wasn’t too difficult.
“Well, I exchanged letters with my mother, and she says you and your mother are welcome to stay with us for Christmas or New Years. What do you think?”
He stood, ready to go to the Great Hall as well, but only felt a rumble in his stomach. Still, he put his books back in his room and went into the hall, deciding to take a short stroll around the school.
“You had to play that card,” he said, silently cursing his parents for forcing him to play with the other pure-blooded children so long ago. The tips of Pansy’s mouth started to form a smile. “Fine. But please leave it alone.”
The walk back to Hogwarts was eerily quiet, only the sound of footsteps and of Katie stirring every once in a while broke the silence. Hagrid led Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the infirmary, where Professor McGonagall met them to find out what had happened. Chances were the whole school would know by the time they left, especially considering they’d had to walk an unconscious body down the hall.
“No, I don’t need your help. This is my task, and mine alone,” Draco said, a forcefulness to his voice that he hadn’t used in a while.  He stormed away before Snape could say anything else about the Unbreakable Vow.
Minor angst warning for a nightmare scene. It's been a while since we've posted but there's plenty more on the way. Hope you enjoy! <3
Pansy’s smile dropped slightly. It wasn’t until then that Draco remembered something his father had told him. “That Parkinson girl, she might not be the brightest, but she would be a good match for you.” He did not want their supposed friendship to be anything more. And yet there he was, a girl in front of him who was clearly waiting for affection, and all he could think about was his father’s advice.
“Exactly.” With that, her joyful mood returned, and she squeezed Draco’s hand. He tried his best not to grimace.
“Yeah,” he replied, feigning a smile. Pansy grinned, and suddenly, her lips were on his. He stumbled, caught off guard. He felt the steam, all the bottled up frustration inside him trying to come out, to scream at her. He was about to shove her away when the tiny voice inside of him that belonged to his father said,
In year four, the first time he’d looked into the pensieve, Harry had been overwhelmed by the situation. It was strange to say the least, and he’d been worried he might get hurt or stuck. Now it was much easier, though it was still difficult to piece together all the images. This time it had centered around the life of Voldemort’s mother, Merope Gaunt, and her love for Tom Riddle Senior, his father. Morfin Gaunt, Merope’s brother, had attacked the Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, and their father, Marvolo, had defended his actions. The scene was still clear as ever in his mind.
“Clearly you aren’t since you’re being so defensive about it. Plus you look as gray as a ghost.” Draco opened his mouth to speak but Pansy continued. “We’ve known each other since we were little, Draco. I know how you get when something’s wrong.”
As he walked down the hall, back to the dungeons, he heard a noise behind him. He spun around and pulled out his wand. “Who’s there.”
Draco nearly spit out his food. He was quiet for a moment, continuing to chew. He didn’t think that their “relationship” had progressed that far. In fact, he had tried his best to make it move as slowly as possible. Apparently Pansy was much more oblivious than he thought. Or much more in love with him than he thought. “I’m not sure. I’d have to ask my mother.”
He sat through the feast in silence, only speaking when his friends spoke to him, and clapping when it was revealed that Professor Snape would be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“No. I have more important things to do, and there’s Quidditch practice later,” Draco replied. Pansy finished talking to her friends and turned to face the three boys. Upon looking at Draco, she furrowed her brows. “What?”
“I don’t know, I hope no one’s thought that far ahead.” Harry still hadn’t really processed the idea of someone giving him a love potion, he wasn’t sure he knew the antidote, or even how to recognize it if it happened.
“You think Hermione and Ginny may have been right about the book? I dunno if it’s cursed but it’s still a bit odd.” Harry closed the book, careful to mark his page, and turned to face him.
He had the vanishing cabinets, yes, but there was no guarantee… He would think about it later, after the feast.
“I’m sure he’d appreciate it,” Harry responded, “wouldn’t let him miss out on the party.” Hermione tilted her head to the side.
The hospital wing doors swung shut behind them as they walked through, and Blaise turned to him, a small smile on his face.
“Remington, Wells, get in position! If the Chasers are coming straight at the Keeper, you’re really planning on just hovering there like two puppets with their strings cut and letting them?” He yelled.
The realisation crept up on Draco like a shadow, thickening into something very real and frightening. Had everyone else known except Draco?
Potter swallowed, green, green eyes tracing the movement of Draco’s hands as he raked them through his hair in a sudden fit of frustration. It was the first time he’d appeared even slightly affected by him this whole conversation.
- Draco surreptitiously massaged his wrists, suppressing a moan at the thought of Potter holding his wrists together with that precise, unshakable pressure.
There was a hot, desperate feeling clutching at Harry, sending waves of prickles rolling over him like a tide. He stared hungrily at Malfoy, who looked rather like someone had just kicked him in the balls. An urgency coursed through Harry, as though every second the taxi driver stared at them impatiently, he was losing the other. He clenched his teeth, foot tapping anxiously. His breathing harshened, and then, as a quiet exhale, he bent towards the driver.
An oddly long one, my friends-- enjoy the ride, I suppose. A lot goes on. Like seriously, uncharacteristically a lot. Hope you guys like it :))) please comment what you think.
Malfoy only had to raise a brow for Harry to plough on, his hands coming up to gesture tiredly as he spoke.
After every other House had a Quidditch practice, Draco would sneak into the showers and check if anything had been added to the writing. Once he’d established what House the person was in… he didn’t know, exactly. His gut writhed with anticipation. This had consumed him for weeks- was he really risking the ruin of the only exciting thing in his life just for… curiosity’s sake?
(Draco had given up trying not to relate everything to Potter. It was fruitless, and a total waste of his energy. Frankly, he burnt enough brain cells wanking over Potter’s mouth every night. He didn’t need to fry any more by  trying in vain  not to think about him.)
“Thank you, Professor,” he said, turning to go and seizing Potter – who was standing frozen– by the elbow.
He looked over at Ron, and cleared his throat. Ron looked up; his brown eyes were full of a sadness that could only be brought about when confronted with something like Hermione’s oatmeal. It was worse, Harry reflected, when you could practically taste the memory of Mrs Weasley’s wonderful egg sandwiches on your tongue, and smell the tang of the sharp brown sauce.
This entire time, he hadn’t looked Potter in the eyes. He’d gotten a flash of unruly hair, red lips parted in retort, pale skin, but quickly looked down. Where, to be frank, he hadn’t found much solace. Because—what was Potter
Blaise cleared his throat, eyes never moving from the page he was staring fixedly at. “Well, whenever you put a lot of research into something so you can talk about it, it generally means you’re actually obsessed with a person doing that something. It’s an excuse to talk about them as much as possible.”
Pansy gave him a doubtful look. “I don’t know, Draco, the man’s just been ditched. I don’t reckon he’s paying much attention to anything around him.”
“I said, mind if I return the favour?” Malfoy repeated. His eyes were steady, but he was biting his lip in such a way that he looked as though he wanted to devour Harry.
“Hmph! Not many young people have taste like you,” Mrs Finchman said decidedly, voice tremulous. “Anytime you want a book,” she stuck her bony finger out and jabbed at him, “you just ask me, duck, alright?”
“Point is, we won’t make fun anymore. We fully support your relationship with the Weasl—uh, Ginny. Honestly.” Blaise’s voice evened out and regained some of its usual liquid charm.
So it was with great frustration, and maybe a tiny bit of relief that he’d never admit to because Malfoys did not back down from a plan, that Draco found out it was Ravenclaw practice again this week instead of Gryffindor. Outwardly, he was fuming at the delay. Privately, he was grateful for the little bit of respite it gave him to formulate a plan.
—” he pointed an accusatory finger at Harry, who widened his eyes innocently “—I don’t need to know that you’ve seen my sister on the toilet.”
But Potter was already turning away, slipping into the stream of students that was starting to fill up the hallway, and his robes blended in with a sea of billowing black. Draco thought he might’ve looked back, once, the lenses of his glasses glinting in the warm daylight, but he was too far in and it hurt to watch him go, actually. Like Draco was losing something that had somehow entangled itself in his essence, tugging at his lungs as Potter got further and further. Leaving Draco with the odd, quiet melancholy of loneliness.
“Oh, and Mr Malfoy--?” McGonagall turned suddenly. Draco looked up. “By keep your temper in check, I ,of course, mean try to stay calm enough to cast a proper jinx. Muddled magic can have serious consequences.”
Draco leaned in, voice whittling to a chummy whisper. “Zabini, I always knew you’d be the woman of the relationship.”
Mirrors gleamed at him from the opposite wall; his hands were light and quick on his zipper, deftly pulling himself out of his jeans and yanking his boxers down. He chose the third urinal along, looking awkwardly in the mirror as he relieved himself. It had always seemed to him slightly obscene that one was supposed to look oneself in the eyes as they took a piss, and watch the pleasure- pain of it via a mirror, but there was nowhere else to look, really. So Harry stared apologetically at himself while he finished up, and put himself away with an air of an unpleasant task done. He made his way over to the sinks, feeling the water bathe his clammy hands in cool cleansing waves. Relief soothed the knot of anxiety that had been tightening steadily in his gut the past half an hour. But then he started to feel thoroughly violated, as he always did after using a public restroom, and his stomach feebly began to churn again at the idea of going back out there.
he added bitterly. Because, yeah, Draco knew better than anyone how hard it was to start afresh. Hell- even now, he still wasn’t completely clean, was he? He still had jerks like Zabini accusing him of being deep in the dirty workings of the Ministry. He still had a fucking
“I was just looking through your wardrobe, Harry! Not for anything… I mean, just for—I mean, I wasn’t…” Ron said, stumbling over his words. His ears were flushed a deep pink. “And it hit me in the face.”
So far, he was pretty sure he’d just alluded rather vaguely to a ‘misunderstanding.’ Plus, the Headmistress was no fool. She probably didn’t need Draco to explain what she’d seen. She did seem to enjoy watching him try, though; her beady eyes held a glimmer of something suspiciously like laughter while he struggled to finish his sentences. Even more so as Potter finally raised his flushed cheeks and started to haltingly add to the story. Unsurprisingly, he blamed the whole thing on himself, which was the stupidest thing Draco had ever heard. Not to mention unnecessary; the way he’d spun it, they weren’t even in for a detention. He tried hard not to be endeared by the contrite looks Potter kept casting him from under his lashes, and failed miserably. As per usual.
In any case, she’d left him here, with only a slight draught prickling at his skin and an increasingly empty hallway for company. The few pairs and trios of students frequenting the corridor had thinned out after a short while, and Draco knew everyone was heading to lunch. That delicious smell – it always seemed to permeate the castle at mealtimes no matter how deep into the building you were - wafted up the passageway, and his stomach growled loudly. Idly, he wondered if it was some sort of anti- eating disorder charm, the smell. To tempt even the most determined to skip a meal down into the warm belly of the Hall for at least some soup and a chat. Draco remembered when he’d been in sixth year, so consumed with killing Dumbledore and serving the Dark Lord. There’d been many a time he’d planned to skip every meal and brainstorm death plots, but physically could not hold up the whole day with that smell tempting him. No matter where he hid, it would taunt him, murmuring of beautiful, hot food and pumpkin juice. He’d always been too hungry to skip full days - the most he’d managed to do once was skip breakfast and lunch. By dinner, he always broke. And his brainstorming was never very productive, anyway; driven half mad by the smell of slow- cooked steak and kidney pie, he’d often just sit and stare at the dormitory wall, miserable in his resolution.
“Yes, please,” Pansy said clearly. “Can I have a vodka martini, stirred clockwise for three seconds with an olive? Actually, make that two olives. Draco?”
“Yep,” he said shortly, and opened his door onto the road, closing it quickly and dodging an oncoming car to duck around onto the uneven pavement.
So he spent the next twenty minutes trying to push the key in further, because Pansy had once said something about all the pins in a lock needing to be pushed the right way, and maybe there were more pins that hadn’t been pushed, so he pressed the little key practically all the way in, and then he broke it, and coincidentally that was when Draco’s patience broke too.
With some semblance of dignity, they managed to make it to the stairwell, and then he sensed movement somehow, spine rippling to tingles- there was a voice whispering in his ear, Pansy’s voice. He half- spun, only to see the delicate bluish glow of her Patronus hovering by his shoulder.
know, then? What is it that you and Potter have that means you can know and not me?” He demanded, hot anger rising in him. It might have been ludicrous to anyone except Zabini, because to everyone else Draco hated Potter. But Zabini knew… everything, as far as Draco could tell, and he didn’t bat an eyelash at the question.
Blaise raised his eyebrows expressively, dimple so deep it looked like a dent in cocoa cream. Draco fought the urge to snort with laughter, and Pansy narrowed her eyes at them.
He exhaled roughly, gazing at Draco with a desperation that split Draco open. His eyes were so deep Draco drowned in them, fucking cliché as it was.
As if this wasn’t crime enough, while Professor Mancie- a new addition to the staff, and a woman with an infuriating perpetual smile on her face- was explaining in detail the various functions of Muggle public transport, Potter leaned back on the hind legs of his chair, head tipped back indolently, and yawned widely.
Draco opened his eyes to the sharpish, iron- muddied scent of a London evening, lampposts still warm from the setting sun, air carrying a heavy tang of metal and river water. He looked around to see Pansy and Blaise opening their eyes, blinking owlishly as they released each other’s hands. They were standing in a back alley which led onto a large, elegant square filled with sleek- looking cars dodging one another impatiently and flocks of people in evening dress filling the air with hums of conversation.
Draco didn’t need to look right to know that Potter and Longbottom were inching hopefully towards one another.
Blaise looked concerned now- he came towards Pansy and sat opposite her. Draco leaned back against the counter, eyes intent on their female friend.
Once he got to the kitchen, Harry turned awkwardly, sending a spark of his magic flaring out so the lights flickered on.
Pansy took out a Knut from his wallet, put it carefully in the owl’s pouch, and gave it a pistachio. The tawny hooted happily, ruffled its feathers and took flight, veering clumsily out of the kitchen and down the corridor, to where Blaise was holding the front door open for it.
His legs shook a tiny bit as he walked out from behind the table, not daring to push his chair back in, and began to weave around the first table. A goblin sitting in the chair he was walking past gave a loud snort of derisive laughter, and his heart froze in his chest.
Pansy hadn’t come back for eighth- year. Her parents had sent her off to a finishing school in Switzerland, and she wasn’t allowed an owl. Draco had sent her letters, of course, but there was no way to know she’d read them. It had been lonely living in London alone, but somehow being surrounded by hundreds of students all day was even lonelier. It had struck him sometime in the middle of his second week trailing miserably to classes how he had really made enemies of most of his year during his first six years at school, and how the few who hadn’t hated him now hated him anyway because of what he’d done in his seventh. He even got nasty looks from a few Slytherins, which in his opinion was a bit rich, but what could you do? Who was going to listen to him complain about the hypocritical bastards when everybody despised him?
With an insolent pause, Draco turned slowly to face the classroom, eyes moving over it. He didn’t get it.
“When?” Draco asked, trying to contain the jealousy needling at him. “When did you two become confidantes?” He was aware he was acting like a possessive boyfriend. He didn’t care.
Draco nodded, disappointment welling in his throat, which was ridiculous, really, because Pansy had never been here, he hadn’t been expecting her, and he’d only thought she was here for about two seconds.
McGonagall rose, suddenly, and directed her words towards Potter, who looked up at her with a slight blush warming the tops of his cheeks.
Potter nodded vigorously, the cutest blush staining his cheekbones, and Draco wanted to giggle, but then realised what McGonagall was alluding to.
? That’s a marvellously big word, Potter, maybe we should write it down and tell McGonagall when she gets here, just so she can praise her boy? Go on, you were saying something,” he goaded, and watched with burning, corrosive satisfaction as the tendons in Potter’s neck tightened. His jaw clenched, and he looked as though he were chewing on a hundred foul swear words to spit at Draco.
“Why,” he took a deep breath in, “the FUCK have you been hiding as Theo Nott? Huh? You couldn’t have told me? You couldn’t have told your best friend you were planning to sneak into school even though your parents don’t want you here, and that you were going to masquerade as a fucking BOY for a year? Were you just going to stay as him the whole time? Were you ever going to tell me?”
Ginny’s tongue slipped out to lick gingerly at the oatmeal, the feline gesture making her eyes cross as she looked up at Hermione.
Harry’s best mate paused for a moment, and then shrugged. “Not that I know what that last bit means, particularly, but you know ‘Mione.”
From then on, the day was a catastrophe. In Charms, Draco massaged his aching temples futilely as Professor Flitwick split up them up again—same trios as last time.
Potter sighed, a sound that curled into Draco’s ears, tucking into every cranny of his brain and filling him up. He closed his eyes. Potter coughed, and he opened them to see curious green, green, green looking at him as though he were mad.
“The fashion guru? The queen of haute couture? The style icon?” A high, amused voice said from the doorway. Ginny was leaning against the door frame, long legs and arms crossed languidly.
. It was Malfoy he was doing this with, Malfoy he was breathing hotly into. The supercilious, posh, bigoted blond boy from school with peevish, beautiful eyes. But, God, there was too much to think about from their school days, and he didn’t want to consider any of it. The place where Malfoy’s grip had been burned like a brand on his left arm, strong and insistent.
Draco shifted under the covers, his mind drifting unerringly back to his most recent visit to the showers
Okay, he could do this. Snark. Witticisms. Dirty humour. This was his forte, his playground, his birthright, if you will.
The Charm collapsed, and rain poured in, drenching Draco in seconds as he stumbled in shock, and started to sprint the short distance between him and shelter.
****************************************************************************************************
She looked up, and grimaced. “No, I’m fine, just… I should really have told you this earlier. For the record, I’m sorry I didn’t. It’s- well, I wanted time to process.”
“—was because in that thirty- second conversation we had, I never connected with anybody more. I was surprised when it happened because… I, well, we know her. It turns out she, ah,” Pansy cleared her throat. “She actually went to Hogwarts. Year below us. I just, uh, never really talked to her. Guess I was prejudiced.”
Though the Shield Charm protected him from the water, the wind pierced his bubble with malicious ease, slicing into his cheeks and whipping them red until he was flushed, hair rumpled and tugged in different directions. He bent his head against the onslaught and carried on, buffeted by the fierce wind so much that he slipped on a step and landed hard on his hands and knees, the skin of his palms smarting and scraped. He scrambled to his feet, and now there were two muddy patches over his knees. Swearing, Draco stumbled on, and it was sapping his effort to keep the Charm up this long against such strong rain. When he had descended the huge slope upon which Hogwarts was set, he broke into a jog, feet unsteady over the long masses of tangled grass, slipping over the squelching mud and narrowly avoiding falling over again. Presently, the hoops of the Quidditch pitch pierced the thick fog clouding the ground, and Draco slowed, veering left towards the changing rooms with a sigh of relief.
“But she… someone said they liked- uh, kippers? Pansy- that was her favourite… and they called me a git. She always said I was a git.” he said sadly.
“I—you’re the same—you haven’t grown?” it came out as a strange half- question, and in hindsight it was definitely not the best thing Draco could have said.
They opened their menus in unison, eyes flicking over the lines of curly script. To be honest, Draco wasn’t even reading properly, just flicking his eyes over the menu. Pansy was the best at ordering; she always knew what would taste best. Blaise was already setting his menu down, hands folding neatly on his lap, eyes flicking around the room with lively interest. Draco looked over to Pansy; she was still buried in the menu, brow furrowed.
Ginny snorted. “Yeah, right. Like it’ll be that easy. I want to keep you guessing. You’ll find out on the day.”
Zabini huffed a laugh. “Date? No. Fuck, no.” He rubbed the back of his neck self- consciously, fingers precise and sweeping. “We were more like brothers- the summer was tough, for everyone. We became too close too fast for it to be romantic. It was like… we needed each other’s advice, and companionship, and support. There was no time for any of that.”
Pansy grinned suddenly, a pixie- like smile that exposed her small, pearly teeth and lit up her fine- boned face. “Yeah.” She blushed, then, and dimly Draco wanted to roll his eyes but he just couldn’t because it was so fucking pure.
Hermione laughed, a pregnant lady laugh, full of vibrant, generous life, and Ginny smiled despite herself.
She shrugged off her muddied Quidditch robes, leaving them in a dank pile on the wooden floor, and started to make her way towards the kitchen, eyes hungry. Harry moved to block her off, expression urgent.
Draco leaped and crashed onto Weasley, sending them both tumbling to the floor with an almighty crash, and Draco hated physical exertion but there was a sort of mist over him that made him feel utterly bloodthirsty, and he reached an arm back to hit Weasley, only to feel someone grip his forearm and haul him up roughly, grabbing the other arm and holding them behind his back as he struggled weakly.
Pansy shook her head, ringlets bouncing, and though she looked upset a small smirk carved its way onto her face as though she couldn’t help it. And, Draco knew, she couldn’t. She was a Slytherin. “They don’t know. I managed to get myself in pretty easily, it’s just Polyjuice—”
Zabini stepped ahead of him, turning smoothly so he was walking backwards through the Transfiguration corridor and facing Draco as they walked.
“That’s beautiful, Ginny,” Hermione breathed, misty- eyed and vaguely sugar- hazed. Even from the loveseat, Harry could smell the lingering scent of pumpkin- spice Butterbeer clinging to her skin.
It was late, and the fire in his dormitory was dying again. Draco levelled his wand at it irritatedly, and gave it a flick. The flames pulsed up again, fire crackling pleasantly as it re- ignited, and Draco felt warmth start to spread out towards him, softening his posture even further as he slumped down onto his elbows.
He allowed himself a minute to breathe before going into the showers, and sort out the tangle of thoughts knotting itself stubbornly in his mind. He closed his eyes, and mentally plunged into the melee.
“Yeah.” It was too breathy, like a whisper, but he couldn’t help it. His voicebox felt like it was closing up, stomach screwing itself tight.  “If, you know, there is one.”
“So, Zabini,” Draco said, hands tucked into his pockets as they walked briskly up the first floor stairs. “How come you’re talking to me civilly now?”
Pansy nodded, already deep in a rather one- sided conversation with Blaise about the exact shade of brown of the Quidditch player’s eyes.
It was hotter than it sounded. With a possessive flash that saw him pressing his cock forward into Malfoy’s own and grinding, he swore nobody else would ever hear it again. Malfoy’s breath shivered out in a gasp, and he laughed, the vibrations going straight to Harry’s cock.
Now, of course, Draco thought firmly, he couldn’t care less about the lot of them. No- he picked up his chicken leg and resumed his slow demolition of it- the Golden Trio was no longer his concern.
When Harry spoke, his voice was rough. “I… I don’t feel that way now, but,” he swallowed. “Maybe if I- if I met the right person I’d want to be…” He tailed off, knowing he was biting his bottom lip, unable to stop.
God, was it insensitive to be thinking about getting fucked by someone who was remembering something as awful as Malfoy was?
The next few days passed in a haze of indecision; Draco went from lesson to lesson, unfocused and preoccupied, mind swirling with possibility. Several times, he was called upon for an answer and had to improvise, ducking his head to hide an embarrassed blush. It was all very inconvenient, all very clichéd. He could attribute it to one thing, and one thing alone:
He was interrupted by a soft shifting on the bed before them, and a creaking sound from the mattress. They looked down to see Potter sleepily turning over, throwing an arm half- over his eyes to block out the warm rays haloing him.
The plates were piled high with sushi, miso- smelling liquids, rice with delicate little crabs fried in honey and a stew- like concoction that Pansy declared, with a casually cosmopolitan slant to her mouth, was called ‘shabu- shabu’. It looked delicious.
And Harry’s stomach tightened and melted, throwing itself on the floor and wailing. The emotion swelling in his throat quickened his breath so he was panting, pulse fluttering, and Malfoy was staring at him with limpid pools of silver for eyes. That was desire, Harry knew it, and he couldn’t wait any longer. He crossed the distance between them in a step and a half, hands reaching instinctively for Malfoy’s waist, and when the other man met him halfway it was pure relief, cool water in the desert. Harry burned for him, chests pressing together with the urgent need of two people utterly absorbed in one another, and he wanted more, so much more, nothing was enough. Not the slide of his lips over Malfoy’s exposed neck, leaving a trail of goosebumps in his wake, not the possessive splay of Malfoy’s hand over his hip, not even the breaths they were exchanging, hot need misting closer, mingling, gasping…
Over the next few days, the idea of the song haunted him. It was constantly at the back of his mind, and now he was having a million different ideas as to what he could have done to check that it was somebody else who had written the next line. He longed to go back to the changing rooms and see if there was anything more, but it wasn’t Slytherin practice till next week. If any other member of the Slytherin team had been caught sneaking in they would only have been kicked out by the other house teams. But Draco the ex Death- Eater? He wasn’t keen on facing down a bunch of angry Quidditch players, all of them probably yelling about a mother or brother or second cousin twice removed who’d been hurt by one of Voldemort’s many followers.  No; he’d have to wait and see.
“Well, normally I’d have accounted for the whole meal, but you both seem to have the appetites of Hippogriffs tonight. Pansy here has singlehandedly demolished that shabby shabby thing.”
The staircase opened up onto a slightly smaller space decorated the same way as upstairs, but this time with a clear feeling of magic about the place. Goblins, vampires, and one pale man with red- rimmed eyes who looked rather like a werewolf sat at darkly-lacquered tables, eating with an assortment of chopsticks and custom cutlery to accommodate the variety of claws and fur adorning their bodies. However, there were also dozens of tables with wizards sat around them, drinking from goblets, joking and laughing with their friends. Wands flashed and twirled in fingers, casually handled as though there weren’t Muggles just upstairs. It made Draco nervous.
And it smacked him in the face like green eyes and apples and a thousand batches of Wistful Draught.
Harry could hear the faint note of pride colouring Ron’s tone, and smiled. However, his smile was quickly wiped away by an echoing yell spiralling upwards from the kitchen, bouncing around the crooked walls and staircases of the Burrow. Footsteps could be heard nearing Harry’s- formerly Bill’s- bedroom, and the landing creaked.
There was a pause, in which they both looked at each other, Draco in mild hostility, and maybe a little curiosity, and Granger with an open amusement that bewildered Draco entirely.
And that stung- not that Draco was going to show Zabini that- but yeah, it hurt a bit. Because Draco wasn’t like the other Slytherin kids, children who were brainwashed at worst; victims of circumstance in a pinch. He had gone the extra step. He couldn’t be counted as a kid, or someone who was just born into the wrong family. He hadn’t been a passive bystander in the war.
With a groan, he collapsed against the brick wall and leant into it, gasping for breath. His hair was sopping, darkened by rain and dripping into his eyes, gel completely dissolved. His robes- he looked down and grimaced- were soaked at the shoulders, weighing heavy and wrinkling uncomfortably so he had to keep shifting and rolling his shoulders.
Harry exhaled, mouth tipping up in a half- smile. “It’s impolite to interrupt when somebody’s thinking.”
It was weak at best, but Potter swallowed and stepped back, and Zabini scowled in an angry- supermodel sort of way.
Draco gritted his teeth. Two years ago he’d have whipped out the blood traitor insults there and then. Now, he flattened his palms on the textbook and tried to think happy thoughts, fighting past the smoke- induced fantasies of Potter. “Why don’t you double- check, then?” He said as calmly as he could.
whoa, it's been months- really hasn't felt that long, but I guess time's moving weirdly nowadays. I've been updating my other fic a little more often, so this baby's been pushed back a while. Anyway, hope you guys enjoy chapter 2 :)) know it's been awhile coming
With an exhausted sigh, he heaved himself off the wall, and staggered slightly, unbalanced by the sodden weight of his robes.
Ron’s very freckles seemed suddenly to radiate concerned tenderness. He went over to Hermione and stood behind her, looping his lanky arms around her so his long- fingered hands were splayed gently over her belly. Hermione melted, and Ron nosed lovingly at the pale, exposed column of her neck, curls pulled back messily in a soft bun.
Harry lunged for the bed, landing on it with a ‘whump’ and narrowly missing Ron, who scrambled out of the way with a snigger. Harry sagged.
“Malfoy, would you please relax? She won’t be angry. Honestly.” He turned to Draco, and he looked so earnest and lovely, hair soft over his eyes and forehead, that Draco’s heart cracked open in his chest. He smiled tightly.
Potter did not say a word, hand frozen mid- air, and his face was galvanised by an emotion so akin to humiliation Draco thought he might get up and just leave right there. But then, with a desperate neediness that made him turned him on unbelievably, Potter brought his other hand up to cover Draco’s wrist, squeezing it hopelessly, fingers stroking over the light hairs on his arm and nails grazing his skin. Draco’s breath caught.
The other man’s breath was deliberately slow, intent dark in his eyes, and his hand tightened to mirror the desperation of Harry’s grip. Harry wanted to explode from it all, the coil of desire that saw him canting his hips forward. He was a hair away from grinding against the seat shamelessly.
“But what? You couldn’t have told just me? How the hell did school even let you in, anyway? They let you do this?”
She blushed, and Pansy looked at Draco. He knew they were thinking the same thing; Blaise could easily have turned on the same level of charm, dimple and all, to poor old Mrs Finchman.
They stood together before the great gargoyle as Potter cleared his throat, sliding a small piece of parchment from his pocket and peering at the words inscribed upon it in a curling hand.
It was only about eleven in the morning, maybe almost half past, and three out of the four of them were drunk. Not terribly drunk, but the kind of tipsy that ruins you for productivity for the rest of the day.
Harry wanted to curl up and disappear. The last dregs of arousal were still throbbing in his belly, but now he was prickling with anger and fear and he really needed a shower. The pulse of nervous adrenaline in his ears told him this could go very wrong very quickly.
“OTHER PROMINENT MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IN QUESTION INCLUDE CREOSOL GOYLE, LAVINIA ZABINI AND MARRIED COUPLE LORD AND LADY PARKINSON”
Draco opened his mouth, about to cut in, when he became vaguely aware of raised voices behind him. He stopped, and twisted in his chair to see the table he and Blaise had been playing a drinking game on. The dark- haired man with his back to them was sitting up straight, gesticulating somewhat incredulously, and the sheer- shirted guy facing them looked mulish. He stood up, chair screaming on the polished wooden floors, and cut his date off mid- sentence. His voice was loud and vulgar, audible over the gentle background music, which died down abruptly as the band stopped and stared.
Blaise dimpled and his tongue played in the corner of his mouth arrogantly, peacocking. Draco felt a thousand times lighter, suddenly, just witnessing them be happy together.
For the next week, Draco thought only of the writing on the shower wall. He stumbled through classes in a feverish state, hair mussed, visualising only the spiky scrawl that he’d seen burned into the tiles. He’d told himself time and time again that it was ridiculous, that the fact that another student knew the Muggle song was coincidental, unimportant. However, it hadn’t stopped him from scrawling down the next line of the song, heart pathetically in his throat, hair plastered wetly over his forehead. He didn’t know what it was about burning the words into the wall- what he felt… it was like a storm of emotion, of power. The concentrated tingling of his magic in his fingertips, mingled with a muddied cocktail of excitement, confusion, and curiosity made his head buzz pleasantly.
The man blinked. “Of course, sir. They’re just over there—” he gestured to somewhere behind the bar, and Harry felt faintly sick. He’d have to navigate the tables, and go through the staff door, and not make a fool of himself, and he’d definitely trip and fall or what if someone told him he wasn’t allowed and he’d have to explain—
“That’s because you were shit- faced!” Draco protested. “I was the only coherent one out of the three of us, and I’d drunk the most. I will not,” he crossed his arms, “will
They smiled back, friendly pockmarks between bricks like a million sunshiny dimples. Black flowers ghosted around Draco, and the air billowed at him. He blinked.
At that moment, Draco wanted it. Wanted to feel awful about himself, and be proven right. He didn’t let up, closing in on Potter and feeling his mouth thin out with that violent need fuelling him.
“I don’t need your damn pity, Scarhead,” Malfoy spat, and had Harry really ever seen anyone but the boy he’d been at school with? There he was, in the venomous tone and the haunted eyes and the sick pallor.
Potter huffed a tiny laugh, and it sounded rueful. Like he thought he was being an idiot for putting himself out there.
“Fuck,” Draco cursed aloud and blew out a frustrated breath, flinching as a small crash sounded somewhere to his left and Weasley swore quietly. He groaned.
The boys stepped off, and stood beside each other, both slightly dishevelled, with twin flushes working their way up their necks.
Yells, screams, and laughter erupted through the room. There were cries of ‘I told you so!’ and ‘Oh, no way!’
Harry ran out of the classroom as quickly as he could. He heard Draco yelling ‘Potter, wait!’ but he just kept on running. He knew that Draco was going to make the rest of his year a living hell, and he really didn’t need to deal with that right now. His enemy, his bully, his tormenter- and he smelled his cologne during the love potion assignment. Under different circumstances, it would’ve been funny- but not only was Draco a nuisance, but he was an ex-member of the Death Eaters. He had ties to dark magic. If he wanted to harm Harry, he could in a heartbeat. He had no idea why he smelled cologne during the assignment, let alone Draco’s. Maybe Draco was right- perhaps he smelled the residual cologne from the robes he wore yesterday.
“Class is dismissed. You all have received full marks on this exam. Congratulations. Homework is a two-foot long essay on what you learned from this brewing assignment. Thank you.”
“Now, pour in approximately one quarter of a cup of peppermint oil.” Draco pulled out a pink, sparkling measuring cup with the initials ‘P.P’ on it and meticulously measured out the exact amount of peppermint oil before adding it to the potion. Harry snorted, and Draco looked up at him, his eyes piercing daggers. “Jealous, Potter?” he taunted under his breath.
“You know, that actually does sound fun.” Harry could use some magical candies and pastries to boost his mood… and a little bit of fire whiskey, of course.
Pansy threw up her hands. “Why do I bother? You two,” she shot them both a dirty look, “take the mickey out of me no matter what. I
He forced himself to stand up, pushing his chair back as quietly as he could. It still squeaked a little, and he cringed visibly, looking around to see if anyone was watching him.
So how could he, given all that, still be interested in finding out who it was that was writing those lyrics on the Quidditch shower wall?
And Draco would have sworn at him, or flipped him off, but there was something in Weasley’s tone that made him raise his head slowly, eyes red- rimmed from all the mist, which was making the whole class tear up a bit.
“Why is everybody always telling me to move on?! Did you ever think maybe the old stuff has staying power?” Draco said hotly, and paused.
He nodded towards the two boys, a struggling mass, and with a parting shot of, “good luck, Finnigan, mate, looks like I’ve spiced him up for you a little- you’re welcome, by the way,” accompanied by a malicious wink, he closed the door to the broom cupboard and pulled his bag back over his shoulder.
Blaise eyed Draco silently, mouthing, "good boy." Draco gave him the finger, and all three of them held back laughter. Something about Mrs Finchman’s slightly random manner was hilarious to witness.
Truthfully, Draco was tired. Being a pariah was surprisingly exhausting- avoiding people’s eyes, swerving out of the way in hallways, not
Harry sat awkwardly in bed, and tried not to gag. After a minute or so of solid disgustingness, he cleared his throat gently, and his best friends sprang apart, blushing like they were all still teenagers. It was nauseatingly cute, the whole thing, and maybe somebody else would have been endeared, but Harry was starting to think longingly of eggs, possibly bacon, or maybe some of those fat fluffy kippers Hogwarts used to make, just anything,
“You?” he returned the question casually, expecting a careless ‘no’, in return, since Ginny usually talked about her dates freely and without any probing necessary. If she were seeing someone, he would have expected to have heard about it by now.
Later, a worried- looking Theo Nott attempted to engage him in conversation over lunch, but Draco couldn’t focus, too preoccupied with the distance between Potter and Seamus Finnigan over at the Gryffindor table. With a decidedly unhealthy sense of victory, he watched as their hands brushed over the chicken drumsticks, and Potter snatched his away like he’d been burned. Finnigan’s grey- blue eyes lowered, lashes fanning down, and Draco could have danced atop the table.
Harry hunched lower in his seat, jeans uncomfortably tight. His waistband was cutting into his stomach, puffed out from all the food he’d eaten. The embarrassment of being ditched was churning nauseatingly in his stomach, along with a salty soup- like dish he’d had earlier. That bastard had left him with the bill.
Ron leaned in confidentially. “Mental, isn’t it? Dipping the poor kid in water. I tell you, these Muggles…” he shook his rumpled head disbelievingly, and then brightened. “Did I hear Ginny come in?”
—the team, I mean to say. We were just thinking a practice match would be good, get us all back in the swing of things, and to be honest, they’re getting a bit restless. You know, waiting for match season to come up.”
“What?” Draco grinned. “This?” And he did it again, mouth open in an exaggerated ‘ahhhh’ from the fiery heat in the back of his throat.
“Thank you, Professor. I am.” He opened his mouth as if to add something, but seemed to reconsider. Nodding slightly, he turned back to Draco and allowed himself to be led from the office.
much, but now he was breathing hard, smoke clogging his lungs, and he was angrier and angrier every second. All he wanted was to run and
It spilled from his lips like water, and Harry could feel his cock thickening, twitching, his stomach muscles rippling under Harry’s fingers. With one last sharp breath, tears pooling and streaming from his eyes at the stretch, he sucked deep, mouth straining across Malfoy’s cock, tongue gliding across the slit, and Malfoy fucking roared as he came, his hands finally moving from behind his head to tangle in Harry’s hair, unconsciously fucking his hips forward so Harry gagged.
“I don’t… who do I…?” He trailed off, brain moving thickly and disjointedly. Zabini stared at him as though he was the thickest person is the world. Draco bristled, and drew himself up, wracking his brains.
The plan flashed through Draco’s mind at breakneck speed, then again slower, and he went over it again and again in his mind, deliberating excruciatingly over every fine point.
And she closed her eyes tranquilly, cheeks still a little tearstained, breaths coming evenly and deeply. Harry brushed her hair from her face and rested his own head on the back of the loveseat. Maybe it was time for an afternoon nap.
He was interrupted in his musings for a second time as the boys made their way to their desks- front row like Draco, Longbottom on the far right, Potter in the middle- and Flitwick gestured to their textbooks. They both flipped the Advanced Charms Guide, Grade Seven open to the introduction and began to read, Longbottom fearfully slowly, and Potter with an alert, easy speed that took Draco by surprise. It then dawned on him that perhaps he should not have been watching Longbottom and Potter read- he shook himself, and turned back to his book, feeling the cool waft of air from the window to his left drift over his cheek. In the airy, warm- ish Charms classroom that sat in a little pocket just overlooking a lovely stretch of the Hogwarts grounds, Draco lost himself in the simplicity of black and white print, his wand sitting comfortably in his robes’ right inside pocket. A grounding weight. A reminder that he was safe, that he could relax, and he could learn and just… be.
Draco picked up his fork and started to eat away at his rice, taking chunks of meat from the strange stew- like dish and an occasional crab. It was delicious, flavours dancing across his tongue and mingling in a vibrant, blendable harmony of spice and sweet. The three of them dug in enthusiastically; for a while, the only sound at their small table was the chinking of cutlery against china, and eventually the greedy scrapes of fork tines clearing any flavoursome debris from the very surface of their plates.
Blaise’s eyes grew comically round, and his next sentence tumbled out of his mouth as a dawning realization. “Holy shit. That Quidditch girl was at the fucking wellness centre too. You’re not obsessed with someone new, you’re still infatuated with her.” He said it with the finality of the truly shocked.
When Malfoy’s shirt popped open, Harry slid it off his shoulders, feeling the planes of skin beneath brush his knuckles as he cast the material on the floor. His burst of confidence receded somewhat, presented with the overwhelming sight of Malfoy before him, shirtless and panting, hair mussed beautifully. Malfoy seemed to sense Harry’s uncertainty; he grinned down at him slowly, and the pure desire of it was softened with just enough sweetness that Harry went completely slack, syrupy want loosening him until he was utterly pliant. Malfoy caught his face up in his hands and kissed him hard, full of teeth and the filthy slide of tongue, and the sharper spike of
Draco probed his feelings, anxious. And yes, he still wanted to know, desperately so. But, God… what would he do when he found out? What, was he expecting that person to just
But Potter’s arms – predictably – were lean and hard beneath his robes, and even as Draco tried to kick him, the other boy stepped even closer so that their groins were flush, Potter’s thigh slotting between Draco’s legs with a rustle of thick fabric. The graze of friction to Draco’s cock was a jolting shock of pleasure up his spine. He battled desperately with the savage edge of arousal that surged up within him suddenly, sparking up at the most inconvenient time. And yeah, he was probably always a bit turned on around Potter. But this… Draco knew with a sick, cold certainty that he was about to get hard if he didn’t get let up in approximately two seconds. He sucked in a breath, trying to come back to himself, trying to escape the drug- haze of Potter’s heavy scent and the warmth of the fire seeping into the bones of his back. It was torture not to grind forwards, down, anything, on the thick muscle of Potter’s thigh, not even rub off against his hip. Draco held himself tightly in check, body frozen, but for the life of him he couldn’t take his eyes off Potter’s mouth.
screamed the gay in Draco, who had already whipped off his shirt and begun to grind on a nearby piece of intestine—
Ron sat up. “The moment you realised you were gay.” He sounded as though he were suppressing a smile, and Harry stuck his tongue out wonkily at his best friend.
Draco gave him a pleading look; Blaise’s eyes were like delicious pools of stubborn chocolate. Draco sank back down into his seat with a moan, covering his face with his hands.
. He clenched his jaw, trying to clear his head. But unbidden into his mind came the memory of that overwhelming tenderness he’d felt at the sight of Potter curled on the hospital bed, the curve of his cheek soft and pale in the weak daylight. How he’d practically melted that day in Potions, when Potter had held him back from punching Weasley, whispering teasing words into the nape of his neck. Raw, unbridled jealousy, even fury, when he’d seen fucking Finnigan with his hands all over
Harry swallowed a mouthful of hot liquid, coughing, and said, “Who d’you think you’ll be playing in the final?”
Draco’ throat was dry, suddenly. “What does that mean?” He was terribly conscious of Pansy and Blaise a few metres behind him, undoubtedly straining to listen.
But then… there was something about the way Nott was staring at the carpet, the way he was shifting uncomfortably under Draco’s heavy gaze, tugging at his schoolclothes as though he didn’t quite belong in them, as though he was afraid someone would point out that he looked different…
