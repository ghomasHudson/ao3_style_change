Draco flushed and burrowed into the jacket, breathing in the scent of pine and cinnamon. He let out an appreciative sigh, only noticing belatedly as Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulders and led him off.
in the hallways too long, now would we?” The portly ghost glanced into the alcove again. James could swear the Friar flashed him a small smile before proceeding to herd his companion off.
“Thanks. That won’t give me nightmares or anything.” He shook his head and turned to Potter. “You up for a quick game, mate? Ginny’s been going on and on about a rematch after you showed her up last week.”
Not that he would ever tell James and Teddy that their artistic abilities were anything less than stellar, of course. But he had to admit the snowman left a lot to be desired. It was lopsided, for one thing. It didn’t have a hat or a scarf. The eyes were crooked and the smile looked more like a grimace.
scared him so much, that he’d decided to reject him first. He didn’t want to give him a chance to break his heart, even if Harry had given him no reason to think he would.
Draco sighed as he wedged himself in next to Harry. “Hi,” he greeted quietly.
you would know.” There was a ripple of movement — barely perceptible to the naked eye — as he shifted his stance. Father tensed and even Draco couldn’t help the hitch in his breath.
Teddy squealed and nearly fell out of his arms as Draco entered the little playroom. He put him down hurriedly and paused to take a look around.
“I just wanted you and Dad to like him too.” He looked up at her hopefully. “You do, right?”
person. So tiny and frail and trusting...just look at him, holding on to Draco like a lifeline. It was bloody terrifying. Draco would take the Hippogriff and the gavel over this any day.
Draco emitted a startled yip at the sudden outburst and Finnigan promptly took the opportunity to pull him closer.
Damn it. He could feel his vision blurring and so help him, he
corrupt my heir,” Lucius rages, wide-eyed and terrified despite his best efforts. Gone was the smug aristocrat. Stripped down to his core, this was him at his truest. A panic-stricken mess. Harry’s mouth twists.
The embarrassment of actually admitting it was a secondary concern now. He swallowed against a lump in his throat and cautiously pressed a hand to his torso. There was a...a
“Now, to business.” Draco stepped away from the podium and took to pacing the small stage with long, meaningful strides. “This year, we have a mission. SHAG is coming up and...”
“Okay,” Potter said slowly. He turned to Draco, giving him his full attention. “What’s up?”
The spell flared. The peas moved, swarming the plate as they rearranged themselves into unmistakable letters. And all around them, people blinked in stupefied silence.
he didn’t belong because in that one moment he had never been more frightened. Staring into that sea of a thousand cheering faces… he didn’t feel like he would ever be one of them. This place… it was too much. Everything was new and different. There were too many people and almost all of them were bigger than him. The castle was so huge, he figured it would take him all seven years just to learn how to make it from one end to the other. And then there were classes and points and passwords that changed every week and...
“I’d do anything for you, Draco,” Harry whispered against his lips. “Tell me what you need right now.”
“Steady, beautiful,” Harry murmurs, closing the open gash with a swipe of his tongue. “We may have gone a bit too far this time.”
going to cry all over Harry like a hysterical mess. He did have some dignity left. So, he leaned against his chest, hiding against him and letting the comfort of Harry talking about their future together wash over him. He spoke of big things like applying to Hogwarts as the new DADA Professor (assuming McGonagall ever forgave them, of course) and mundane, little things like clearing a drawer out for Draco’s things at Godric’s Hollow. And all of it was a balm to Draco’s bruised and battered soul.
“I see,” Father murmured. His eyes softened as he took in James’s teary, mournful expression. “I know you don’t want to talk a lot right now. But we need to, just a little. Can you answer some questions for me?”
Ever.
“I…I do. But that’s what I...”
His insides twist and he wonders despairingly just when he fell so deep. It may have been when he was barely thirteen and happened upon the vampire for the first time. Or it might be right now, at this very moment. More likely, he thinks it’s been every moment in between, before and after.
No wonder they liked each other so much. Harry was wild and spontaneous and carefree, and Draco was cultured and poised and polished. Wasn’t that a thing, opposites attract? It must be, he decided. What other explanation could there
Salazar help him,
, Draco. And it helps that you look like you walked out of my fantasies. Everytime you come here with him, all I want to do is ask you to stay a little longer.”
Draco has never been one to question his Father but right now he has to wonder. Does Lucius truly think he has any control here? That Potter can’t — or won’t — tear him to shreds the moment it sparks his fancy? This isn’t a werewolf or some street thug bought off with a handful of Galleons. Vampires...they played games. Deadly ones. And they didn’t lose too often.
“You do that, Head Auror.” Lily’s answering laugh was all amusement and fond exasperation. “But be back in an hour. The boys will be here by then, and I need you to set the table.”
“His words,” Pansy muttered. Theo just groaned and held his head in his hands.
Was it? Maybe it was. Or would have been, if he hadn’t wrecked it all today.
As he made his way back to the Eighth Year Quarters, suffering a wary glance from a gaggle of Ravenclaw Third Years, he was reminded of how little support he could expect through this whole...thing. He had the better quarter of a year left at Hogwarts and he would most certainly start to show by then. Soon, those looks and glances would turn to whispers. Nudges and discreet side-eyes. If the scrutiny didn’t drive him mad, the rumours certainly would.
“Of course not!” Draco sputtered. “I meant a real farm! Where he can run around and chase rabbits and...Harry, I
Draco sighed.
“A bet,” he repeated blandly. His voice was chilly—masking his seething fury in a parody on banal conversation. His fourteen year old seemed to shrink before his withering gaze. He curled into the narrow hospital bed as if fighting the urge to hide under the covers.
“She likes you.”
Draco stiffened. Harry went pale as a sheet. They turned around, still hand in hand, no doubt sealing their dark fates. Headmistress McGonagall loomed over them, mouth pinched and eyes sparking. Behind her, the entire student body thronged, clearly twitching to get the scandal mills working overtime.
“Draco.”
Of course his snarky attempt to change the subject fell flat. Harry smiled and nudged him, obviously expecting a real answer. “Draco,” he chided. “I told you I wanted to be with you. I want everything with you. This child is...a miracle but I have
Harry’s eyes widened as a golden retriever bounded out from behind Draco and ruffed happily at him. The situation sank in and Harry actually staggered a bit. “Oh no,” he blurted.
as perfect as hers.
“Well, Sir Nicholas,” The Friar declared in the tense silence. “It seems I was right. It was just a Kneazle after all.”
Dad had said at Kings Cross, pulling him into a hug.
“No.” Lily refuted that at once. “
Father frowned. “Of course it’s okay,” he said finally, after a bemused span of silence. “James… is that why you’re calling, love? Did you think I’d be upset with you?” He looked so troubled by the thought that James nearly burst into tears on the spot. If only,
Maybe it would be different if he were in an actual relationship or...something. But he wasn’t. And the thought of explaining
Draco frowned. This...wasn’t something he was familiar with. He wasn’t exactly an expert in Muggle toys but he knew enough to recognise them or at least, figure out how they worked. With the exception of the one time Teddy’s clockwork dog had barked at him and nearly scared ten years off his life, he hadn’t come across any that stumped him.
Harry nodded. “I get that. I once attacked my friend Neville over the last cup of coffee.” He reached over to squeeze Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s breath hitched as the innocent touch made his skin flare, but Harry didn’t seem to notice anything amiss. “You feel better though, right?” he asked softly.
Draco’s shuddered in disgust, attempting to reason with the little menace.
“Not sleepy,” Draco muttered sullenly, clearly intent on being difficult.
Draco wouldn’t really say he was shrieking
“Honestly William, what’s gotten into you today?” Draco demanded as he dragged his feet in an effort to slow down his fanatic familiar.
His bare toes curled into the plush carpet. Draco wrapped his arms around his middle as he huddled by the door. As a child, he was never allowed in this part of the house. He still had vague recollections of house-elves sternly shooing him away whenever he ventured near.
“What?” he muttered, trying to sound biting. His voice just came out as tired and resigned.
“I won’t share,” Draco informed him just in case he got any bright ideas.
“There are options, of course,” Pomfrey said. If she disapproved, she was careful not to show it. “I have some leaflets in my files, I’ll make a package for you to...think things over.”
him when he was gone...he had to admit it brought a bit of warmth to his soul.
“There we go,” an amused voice quipped, breaking into his reverie. “All better now?”
“Ha! A miscreant out for a midnight stroll, eh?” Nearly-Headless Nick declared, bobbing in excitement and predictably wobbling his head off his shoulders. James grimaced and tried very hard not to look as the ghost righted himself. “We’ll soon put a stop to that, won’t we?”
Harry laughed and nudged Lily playfully. “Went a bit wild with the seasoning again, Mum?”
Honestly, all he wanted right now was to hide in the Hospital Wing for the rest of his natural life.
She looked grave and sober, but the small smile she gave him was genuine.
“No, it’s okay,” Malfoy murmured, squeezing his hand gently. He turned back to James. “That…was the plan for a long time,” he admitted. “My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and I didn’t really see any reason not to.”
That wasn’t entirely unexpected. Maybe he needed some time to get his head around the situation? And to be perfectly honest, they hardly ever crossed paths outside of their scheduled rendezvous. They didn’t share classes — what with Potter taking Advanced DADA and Draco specialising in Transfiguration and Charms — and while Potter spent most of his free time on the Quidditch Pitch or in the Common Room with his friends, Draco haunted the Library. They were almost always on opposite ends of the castle and maybe, just maybe that was how Draco had initially planned it. It was just easier that way. For both of them.
“I’ll bet he spoils you,” he told the baby solemnly. Teddy gazed up at him with big, guileless eyes, listening with rapt attention. He always looked at Draco like that — like he was the most fascinating thing in the world. Draco would be lying if he said it didn’t stroke his ego just a little, but then he was quite sure he looked at Teddy the same way. “It’s all candy and sweets and that awful Muggle telly-thing, isn’t it? That’s why you like it so much with him. Well, I don’t see
Yes, he decided firmly. This would work. He just needed to get there and find an owl.
Draco hummed in agreement and leaned into him.
“I understand,” he replied with a sincere nod. But his lips were pressed together and he was obviously trying not to laugh and Draco was starting to see red.
“And what did your creepy little brother have to say about Draco Malfoy?” James demanded. Teddy gurgled urgently and toddled over to his father. James bit back on a resigned sigh as Sirius was immediately distracted. He Shifted — much to Teddy’s delight — and barked affably, nuzzling and fussing as the child grabbed at his fur with tiny fists.
“Malfoy? Is that you?” a voice called from somewhere in the interiors of the house, followed by the patter of footsteps.
“Potter!” he snarled, “I have something to
And Draco would never have met him.
“What, I’m not allowed to enquire about my son’s former classmates or…”
“Wow,” Ron quipped. “So, explain. How do you plan to seduce Malfoy if he’s going to spend the whole night shaking like a leaf under your bed?”
They’d subsided so far on small talk and the occasional slip into their old ‘bickering’ — as Andromeda liked to call it — but...well, Draco supposed he was still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Potter had shown no signs of wanting to change their arrangement — Draco had weekends with Teddy, while Potter and Andromeda shared the week — but it still worried him that he might someday. And that Teddy wouldn’t miss him if he did.
Draco shoved him playfully. “In a minute, Potter. I have to put this one down for a nap first.”
“I promise we’ll think about it.”
Draco startled as two arms wrapped around his middle, pulling him flush into a toned chest. His breath hitched as Harry pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
. “My scones,” he snarled, somehow managing to convey a whole set of terrifying death threats in those two simple syllables.
of it mean? Teddy huffed at being ignored and made grabby hands at the thing. He must have done something because numbers started lighting up the small rectangular screen.
“When?” Draco demanded sullenly.
before embarrassing himself completely. Yes, all he had to do was go in there, pretend nothing was amiss and spend a few hours with Potter. No harm done, right?
“Okay, that’s
“No,” Draco hissed. “Not again! Tell me this isn’t happening, Harry!”
Sirius yipped apologetically and Shifted back. “Sorry, love,” he grinned, placating his husband with a sweet kiss and settling back down with the baby.
“I left my bag in the Room!”
It’s the first time he’s spoken of… before. Suddenly, Draco has no idea what to expect.
“Later.” Harry slips off the bed and reaches for his discarded clothing. “You can barely keep your eyes open.”
“Oh, I’m sorry love. We
“And now you’re laughing!” Draco shrilled indignantly.
“Yeah yeah, two hours. Merlin, you’re just like your mother with the nagging…”
Potter shuffled uncomfortably and scrubbed the back of his head. “You could come,” he offered. “We need a fourth.”
he bleated helplessly.
So far, par for the course. But then it got worse. Theo committed the ultimate blasphemy by revealing the season finale of
Lily hummed thoughtfully as she added six —
”I promise,” James said without a moment’s hesitation. He lifted his head to look at Draco uncertainly. “Are you still angry, Father?”
And they were flying.
so you can get to shag again.”
His parents exchanged looks. Father arched an eyebrow, Dad hummed thoughtfully. James tried very hard not to sigh in annoyance. The silent conversations… that was one thing he didn’t miss. Right now, he just wanted them to say
“Go on. Read,” Draco ordered, pointing to the plate. “This isn’t how I wanted to break it to you, Potter. But here we are. I hope we can talk about this once it sinks in.”
Draco rolled his eyes and turned off his Kindle, making a mental note to delete that ridiculous e-book as soon as he had the chance. It was a gift from Pansy and now, he was more than certain that she’d forgotten his birthday completely and resorted to a panicked last minute shopping spree. Why else would she give him a compilation on Pagan Folklore? Or maybe it
Needless to say, Draco
“Ron!” Potter blurted, immediately stepping away from Draco.
“Now then! Who goes there?”
Finnigan answered with a flirtatious wink. “Not a second later,” he promised.
Malfoy smiled faintly and turned to Harry. “He did,” he said softly. “Harry’s always so…he just does what makes him happy. He could have been an Auror like you, Mr. Potter. It would have been safe, sensible thing to do.” He glanced briefly at James. “But he wanted to work with Magical Creatures, so that’s what he did. Honestly, I thought he was mad but…I realised that he’d inspired me. Harry made me want to find my own way. He showed me that I didn’t have to be what was expected of me. So, after a bit of soul searching, I told my parents I was going to be a Curse Breaker and that was it. Of course, Father was
It was late afternoon before he ventured into the world again.
“You told Father you’d take what you wanted when you were ready.” His arms loop Harry’s neck, trying to channel warmth and comfort. “Were you going to take me?”
William cut him off with a bark and a firm yank. Draco squawked, his shoulder protesting heavily against the strain.
“I know,” Harry murmured. “I know you do. Go to sleep, okay? I’ve got you.”
“Indeed,” Nick agreed. “Although,” he paused, took a furtive look around and cleared his throat meaningfully, “if any homesick children
At least he learned to pay closer attention to his surroundings after that incident. Now that he was looking, there was no mistaking the unsavoury lot slithering in and out of that study. It wasn’t just the werewolves with their leers and gristly smiles. It was the goblins with their beady eyes and doublespeak, armed with reams of classified parchment and departing with clinking purses. It was the denizens of Knockturn Alley — the Borgins and Burkes, the Cobbs and Fletchers — obsequious, fawning, bearing gifts for
“Care to explain why all my robes are missing and replaced with
“Are you going to tell the father?” Pomfrey asked softly. “The...other father.”
And tomorrow, he would put this mess behind him. He would tell Ha-
“There,” he said teasingly. “Now you’ll be safe from the cold all winter.”
Apparently, Sasha had other ideas. She yipped and made a sudden break for freedom, pulling Harry alongside as she bolted down the hill.
It makes his dead heart ache in ways he was sure he’d forgotten but it’s for the best. Draco deserves a life of his own. A true one. He’s too young and sheltered to understand what he’s asking for.
Remus gave him a fond look and took a seat too, shifting his attention to James easily. “Why the sudden interest in Draco Malfoy?”
“Granger, leave it. Just let me…”
They watched in silence as the Snitch flapped its wings in Harry’s grip. Harry hesitated, then ran a tentative thumb over it’s smooth surface. For a few moments, there was nothing. Draco’s grip on him tightened and then…
“You have tiny hands,” he informed Hugo. That earned him a happy giggle and another round of petting. Draco raised an eyebrow.
And that was that. Decision made. For better or worse.
And then it happened. The nightmare to end all nightmares.
“And you’ll have more friends than you’ll know what to do with,” Dad added. He grinned and laced his fingers with Father’s. “Of course if you’re
return to your Common Room before curfew. We will discuss punishments — if any — tomorrow.”
Draco rolled his eyes as she caught her breath.
“Godric’s Hollow.”
“I don’t see the harm,” Draco agreed slowly. “I’ll bring the initiation manual.”
She handed him a sheaf of parchment and Draco snatched it up with bad grace. “Fine,” he muttered. “I’ll see you tomorrow. And...and I don’t care
“No, just…” Potter huffed, sounding somewhat frustrated. Oh, good. And Draco hadn’t even got to the fun part yet. “It’s just,” Potter went on after a spell of silence, “normally, you avoid me. Unless we’re...you know.”
“Salazar, did you
That part, admittedly, was not something he held high hopes for. But if this was the only way…
. Why he picked us. Then, before I had even begun to mourn them... it was done. He remade me. Turned me into
“Shite! Oh god, I’m so sorry! Are you alright? I tried to warn you but I guess it came too late, huh? I’ve only had these skates a week and I’m shit at stopping and...”
“We’ve got food,” Finnigan cut in. “And Neville’s bringing Firewhisky from the Leaky.”
James scoffed. “Because I’m scared. Aren’t Gryffindors supposed to be brave? Well, I’m not.”
Draco frowns around a tired yawn. “You didn’t...”
bone, the sooner...”
The rush of mortification returned, threatening to submerge him. “He’s telling people about it?” Draco groaned. Merlin, how humiliating!
“Here,” Draco grumbled, surrendering Salazar to the proud father. “Handle your son.”
Dad blinked. “That’s happening?”
“Just so we’re clear, Potter,” Draco said, as Harry fiddled with the remote. “This is not a date.”
As he made his way downstairs to Harry, he reflected on how odd life could be. Harry was the one who’d fought Dementors, Dragons and Basilisks by the dozen. But somehow, in Albus’s eyes, it was
“Do you have a better idea?” Draco demanded. At any rate, it was out, for better or worse. He had done his bit.
Draco hums and curls into his covers. “Good.”
“Harry, please!” He was definitely shrieking now. “I can’t...I don’t know anything about children! What if he cries? What if I drop him? Oh gods, what if he needs to go to the bathroom?!”
Blaise rudely interrupted by choking on a sip of water. Draco paused to glare balefully at him.
“No.” He sniffled slightly and scrubbed a hand over his eyes. “He’s not...we’re...he’s an idiot.”
“No! My!”
He smiled down at Teddy, carding a gentle hand through his downy curls. “Well,” Draco murmured, his tone softening a little — even for Potter, “you’ll have to tell me how he gets on this week. Same time Saturday, I presume?” He moved forward to bundle the baby in the man’s arms but Potter didn’t reach out to take him. He just stood there, smiling faintly.
— and levelling Draco with an even glare. “There are other ways to get my attention, you know.”
“Your date?” Longbottom’s surprised question echoed in the silence. “Malfoy’s your date?”
Wait. Did he say ‘dinner’?
Maybe, but that didn’t stop a father from worrying. That’s just how it was. His one job in the world was to protect Harry and keep him safe. Now he was all grown up and dating and that was bad enough but a
“Hush, love,” he murmured, pressing a kiss to the wild, black curls. “It’s okay. We just need to cheer the snowman up, that’s all.”
Harry stared at it in silence for a few seconds, and then a grin crept up his lips. “You know I have other interests,” he said, reaching out.
Harry nodded in agreement and settled back as the movie started. “Not a date,” he murmured in Draco’s ear. “Maybe later, when you’re not so mad at me, we can try going on a real one and see how things go.”
His friend shrugged. “Seems like a lot of talk to me. I think I’ll sign up for MOAN instead. You know, Malfoy’s Ornithological Appreciation Night?”
“I have an idea,” he declared, talking firmly over Finnigan. He turned to the man and offered a smile of his own. “Why don’t you just move the party downstairs? Then we can all watch these ‘movies’ Potter keeps going on about.” And yes, maybe Draco’s voice had a bit of an angry hiss to it, but all in all, he thought he comported himself very well. “What do you say, Potter?” Draco edged, with a sharp smile. “Just us
“Hey, is someone out there?” a voice called out suddenly.
“Whassamatter?” he demanded, his voice gruff with sleep.
Well, obviously. She certainly wasn’t a hydra.
with you, baby or not. That’s a rather strong foundation to build on, isn’t it?”
The meetings continued, their disreputable guests kept trickling in and Draco learned to ignore them. And if the undesirable visitations just happened to coincide with the odd windfall in the Malfoy vault, one of Father’s political rivals succumbing to a tragic accident or the dissolution of a very specific legal blockade holding back a business venture... that was easily ignored as well. It was business and frankly, Draco wanted
“Can I stay here a while?” he asked quietly. “Please?”
“You,” he chuckled, turning to Draco with sparkling eyes, “are absolutely ridiculous.”
Draco frowned as Pomfrey visibly struggled for words. He’d never known the mediwitch to be anything but efficiency incarnate. The silence grew tense and his insides twisted.
Okay. Okay, that was it. Bring out the cheese graters, Draco was going to town! He slammed his fist on the table, rattling the plate and the bloke for good measure. He jumped and looked up at Draco, comprehension of his crimes no doubt dawning in that dim brain. Draco however, was going to make things clear. “Those are my scones,” he bit out, clearly and firmly. “I want them. Give them back if you want to live.”
“Welcome to the club,” Draco bit out. “It sucks, you’ll love it.”
“Man’s best friend, my arse,” Draco grumbled. “I can’t believe you threw me over for a girl!”
The only problem was he didn’t exactly remember
“I know,” Draco cut in, waving him off. “But I assure you, I’m committed to the cause. In fact, there’s someone I want you to meet.”
“What?”
“What?!”  Weasley yelped. Granger just gaped and Harry had started rubbing his temples and muttering about how he should have stayed upstairs.
career at the Ministry, I’m at your disposal.”
The wind cut through his hair and robes. Draco laughed breathlessly, tightening his hold on Harry as they looped and weaved through the air.
The Third Year student smiled tentatively amidst a smattering of applause.
It had to be done.
“I said it’s fine! You don’t have to…”
“Er...there there?” he tried.
“I knew a man like you once,” he murmurs. His grip tightens around Lucius’s throat and he hoists him up a few inches, dangling him on his toes. “A man who craved power more than anything. Even life.” Harry cocks his head and smiles. “He sounded just like you when he died.”
“He’ll pull through,” Sirius chuckled. “You have to admit, it’s rough when your kids start dating.” Teddy cooed and planted a grubby hand on his cheek. Sirius’s laughter trailed off into a soft smile and he planted an affectionate kiss to his son’s head. “Good thing that’s a long,
“Not hungry,” Draco mumbled, arching his back and pressing into him like a demanding cat. He gazed at Harry with lidded grey eyes and his lazy smile turned suggestive. “Not for drunk ravers anyway.”
The deafening silence that followed only made him cry harder. Father must be so
The only question was how.
Harry’s excited yell was accompanied by a wicket plummet. The wind stung his face and Draco grappled for dear life, almost missing the glint of the Snitch as it zoomed ahead.
“I’m fine,” Potter grumbled from his seat. He cast another disparaging glare in Finnigan’s direction. “Hey Seamus, you want to give Malfoy a little breathing room?”
keeping calm and carrying on. If anything, he was
William gazed at him with sorry, soulful brown eyes and Draco’s ire deflated like a bad soufflé. “Come here, you great mutt,” he grumbled, petting his doggy menace. William barked happily and planted his paws on Draco’s shoulders, proceeding to lick him with great enthusiasm despite Draco’s vehement protests.
His throat clenched around Draco’s hard, slick length and that was it. Draco thrust into his throat, arching and moaning as his climax hit. He flopped back on the bed, panting like he’d just run a marathon. Harry swallowed around Draco’s softening cock, drawing another hiss from him. Draco whined in weak protest and Harry released him, crawling his way up to kiss Draco’s lips.
He said the words and everything! “I’m not messing with...you have this all wrong. Wait, let me start over. Potter, we need to talk. I’m…”
Harry has him pinned against the wall by his throat in a second. His fangs are bared, eyes bleeding into black, a growl thrumming in his throat. Lucius chokes and struggles as his wand falls. Harry kicks it out of reach.
And there he was.
“I think it sounds delightful,” Draco broke in firmly. He held Potter’s gaze steadily, refusing to give in. Potter pursed his lips but he didn’t offer any protests. Fine, then. Draco turned to Finnigan and nodded. “We’ll set up the movie or whatever it is Potter needs to do. You get everyone else down here. See you in five, yes?”
Harry visibly wavered. Granger clenched her fist and even Weasley, who was scarfing down a second plate, paused his feeding to glance over at them. Draco barely noticed, he didn’t dare look away until Harry spoke.
Godric ruffed in agreement and clambered on to the sofa, situating himself firmly between them. Draco was willing to bet every Galleon he had that it was not a coincidence. The mongrel commenced licking Harry, wagging his tail in Draco’s face as he did.
Albus shook his head, black curls bouncing with the motion. He cast a worried glance back at the window, prompting Draco to take a step forward. Whatever this was, he intended to sort it out.

Well. That went in a whole other direction, didn’t it?

His grip on Harry’s shirt tightened when the vampire made his first appearance. Harry wrapped a secure arm around him and settled down to watch, grinning like an idiot the whole time.

“I suppose I’ll ask the obvious question,” Father spoke up after a span of silence. “Why do you think you don’t belong in Gryffindor?”
...by making more notes.
“Malfoy!” Granger protested.
“That’s not true!” Potter protested.
“You’re not going to make me eat ice-cream and pickles like some worn down Muggle cliche, are you?” he asked. His hand drifted over his belly as he spoke — a new reflex — and he winced at the nauseating thought. Admittedly though,
Contrary to popular opinion, Draco was not melodramatic. In fact, on most days he was the epitome of rationality. Calm, collected...some might even go so far as to call him
“Prongs.”
“That’s my boy. Now, do you still want us to come get you or do you want to give this thing another try?”

“Fine,” he declared, trying his best to sound collected and aloof. Appearances did matter, after all. “But just for dinner.” He flashed a warning look when Potter’s face lit up. “And you will behave yourself while there’s a child present.”
“Wait,” Weasley piped up again. “You’ve been seeing Malfoy?”
“Hey,

that he needed space and perhaps it was best if they avoided each other for the rest of the school year. And after that...well, he would need to figure things out but once he submitted his research thesis, he could very well complete his NEWTS by correspondence. Perhaps he would return to the Manor. Mother would be happy to have him back and he still needed to break the news to her. He couldn’t imagine her reaction but he would rather risk it than spend one more second…
“Sophie,” Potter chided, bending down to retrieve her wand. He smiled encouragingly and passed it over. “What did we just talk about? You’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself.”
“I told you!” James was yelling, holding the wireless aloft. “What did I tell you?”
going to believe this.
“I know.” His heart surged, even if his smile was a bit watery still. “Love you both.”
This would work. It had to.

“For Salazar’s sake, Salazar!” he scolded. “What part of

hiding some dark, potentially deal-breaking secret, Padfoot would know for sure. He still kept tabs on estranged relatives— a precautionary measure James heartily endorsed. “That’s not a bad idea,” he said out loud. “Maybe I’ll just head over for a check in, get the lay of the land, you know?”
Draco made his way back to his room on shaky legs.
“So what do we really know about this kid?” James asked, in a last ditch attempt to distract her. Lily turned to him and he promptly seized an opportunity to edge in around her and rescue the wine. “You know,” he coaxed as he stirred some brandy in, “other than the basics.”
the baby until...
“Did you think I wouldn’t come?” Draco asked.
That being said, it was midnight and Draco was trapped under his sleeping,
How long had he been standing there? “I...I was…what in Merlin’s name is that?” Draco straightened himself and pointed imperiously at the board, determined to recover some ground here.
“Oh, I think she can keep a secret,” the blond replied. “Can’t you, minnow?”
Flying. Potter wanted to fly. Together. Draco froze. He...wasn’t supposed to be flying technically. Pomfrey hadn’t expressly forbidden it but…
What had his life come to?
racks his exhausted body and his legs twitch in surrender, still wrapped around the vampire’s waist. Harry’s smile softens and he busses a kiss to Draco’s head before uncoupling them gently.
Hermione’s eyes widened as she saw them. Her baby was tucked into Malfoy’s shoulder, fast asleep. Malfoy had an arm around Hugo and he was propped up against the couch in a way that couldn’t be good for his back at all. Nevertheless, he was sleeping too.
Al nodded fretfully and huddled against Draco. One green eye flitted back to the admittedly large and imposing snowman that James and Teddy had built yesterday. Draco grinned and ruffled his son’s hair gently.
Baby Weasley gurgled happily and reached out to grapple for Draco with his chubby arms. Draco took a prudent step back.
Harry wasn’t buying it. He crossed his arms and fixed Draco with that relentless, stern expression that always made him want to sit in a corner and think about what he’d done.  “You’re astounding,” Harry informed him. “I can’t believe you would use this sweet girl as
Harry broke away from Malfoy and blinked at him. “Dad?”
Harry grimaced. “I believe you believe it,” he replied. He sighed and raked a hand through his hair again. And then, he shook his head, gave Draco a disappointed look and moved out of his way. “See you around, Malfoy.”
“I’ll bet.”
And that was it. His fury boiled over and the dam broke through.
Draco halted his tirade.
“She’s lovely,” Harry replied dryly. “I’m sure Godric will agree.”
Honestly, a part of him just wanted to scream
Then one night — and for the life of him, he would never understand how exactly — they’d fallen into each other. The exact sequence was a blur to him. All he remembered was that Charms Class was cancelled that day because a Fire Salamander got loose in the classroom. He was heading to the library when Potter caught up to him, claiming boredom and asking for a quick game of Seeker’s Tag. One game turned into five. Awkward small talk turned into banter and playful taunts. And then at some point, he’d ended up in a broom closet with Potter’s lips on his neck and his hand wrapped firm around his cock.
would happen but it would likely end with him locked up in some estate on the continent so far away that even Harry couldn’t reach him. His insides clench at the thought. As fun as sneaking around is, the truth is that Harry has come to mean more to him than a fling. That Father might try to separate them… it’s just one of the things that keeps him up at night.
allow this to happen to you because it is singularly not worth it! You’re going to go spare and everything will be different and you’ll never get a thrice damned treacle tart even though it’s the
“What?” James sat up and stared at him, eyes wide with shock. “But Father...”
His jaw drops in indignation. He struggles to sit up and argue but Harry pushes him back down. “It’s not an insult, sweetling. I just don’t want to hurt you, that’s all.”
Draco blinked in surprise as Potter cut Finnigan off by slamming the door rather forcefully in his face.
He struggled for words but they wouldn’t come. Instead, his eyes were prickling and his throat felt too tight and heavy. James swiped his sleeve over his eyes angrily. This was so
“Wine?” Father’s tone was treading a fine line between openly contemptuous and barely civil. “I’m afraid we’re fresh out of your...poison of choice.”
This was it. No excuses, distractions or interruptions for miles. He had no reasons not to do this anymore. Draco nodded and braced himself.
Father stiffened, caught somewhere between insult and caution. “I’ve been told vampires are patient creatures. When I’m the Minister for Magic, rest assured, you will be handsomely rewarded.”
Now he couldn’t even do his schoolwork without messing up. Had he always been this much of a failure at everything? Honestly, he couldn’t think of a single thing in his life that was going right at this point.
Well, he could do one of those, at least. Draco toed off his shoes and fell back on the narrow bed. He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
“This is fantastic!” a First Year declared happily as he ran past them. “I’m so glad I got into BDSM!”
was one way to describe the Malfoys. Also, uptight, puritanical, snobbish and so painfully conformist he’d bet they still brewed their tea in brass cauldrons and bestowed ceremonial beatings on their house-elves. In summation, he was not a fan and he didn’t understand how Lily could be so calm about all of…well,
find it funny?
“Oh yes, you did a stellar job,” Harry retorted dryly. “What with the mumbling and the snitches and fleeing from the sight of me. It’s a wonder I didn’t catch on.”
“I’m not sure what anything means anymore. Especially with you.”
was a nice…
“Want you,” the blond growled as he attacked the other’s throat, pausing every now and then to suckle at the skin and raise a mark. His hands worked busily at divesting the other boy’s clothing. He yanked at the boy’s tie, ripping it off and tossing it to the ground.
“It’s alright, Albus,” he said softly. “It won’t hurt you. Snowmen are very friendly.”
At least, someone was on his side.
Draco glanced up, to find himself surrounded by wide-eyed First Years. He jumped and Potter startled, clearing his throat and quickly removing his arm from Draco’s shoulders. More innocent blinking ensued, although Draco did notice a couple of small Slytherins shoot each other knowing glances.
“And I told you, I don’t care. I’ll take what I want when I’m good and ready. Until that day comes, relax. You’ve come this far without worrying about consequences, haven’t you?”
anymore. “It doesn’t matter now. I’m handling the situation as best as I can. And I really have to go to class now so…” He pushed past Harry in a bid for freedom and he wasn’t even slightly surprised when a firm hand clamped around his forearm.
“It’s no problem,” Potter replied, finally emerging from the corridor. “You just surprised me, that’s all.”
“No!” He wrenched his arm out of Harry’s grip and backed away. “You want to know what’s going on? Do you? Well, here it is. My life is complicated right now. I can’t give you what you want. I need space. I need to figure this out
He couldn’t go through another day holding on to this, he just couldn’t.
Draco froze.
to luxury.
Logically, he knows that’s ridiculous. They’ve been doing this for four months now. Harry always comes back. That encounter in Father’s study sparked something — something that had been primed for Salazar knows how long — and their time together since has been brilliant. The thrill of the forbidden just makes it better.
“There we are,” he said, setting Albus down as the things came to rest at his feet. Al skittered back a few steps and Draco let him go. He set to work on the snowman, setting the eyes and the smile to rights, then patting and smoothing the snow down to give it a better shape. Once he propped the broom up by its side, he had to admit it looked much better than before. Bit by bit, the snowman came together.
you okay?” he ventured helplessly. Fearfully. “Is this a breakdown? Because I...I don’t know what else to think right now.”
“I can hear you,” he drawled, biting back a laugh at the muffled curse he received.

He can see Father’s expression in his mind’s eye — from the displeased twist of his mouth to the glint of discomfort in his eyes at the reminder of who, or rather
“Congratulations, Pothead!” Draco grinned, throwing his arms out in a grand gesture. “You just got SHAGGED!”
“Fine, fine. I get it.”
Granger had to have talked by now, he was sure of it. Just three days ago, he’d come across her in the Common Room, engrossed in the book and furiously making notes. Weasley and Potter had joined her subsequently and Draco had made a quick exit to the dorms, where he’d waited with his heart thudding a mile a minute. Except, Potter didn’t seek him out that night or in the days that followed.
Harry was confused. This by itself wasn’t a very worrisome state of affairs because Harry was almost always confused when it came to his moody boyfriend. But for some reason, things felt different this time. Draco had been snarky and snappish all day and Harry just had this hunch that
We...
he probably wouldn’t have recognised them. But that was definitely the Gryffindor ghost, Nearly-Headless Nick. And the one with him was the Fat Friar.
Harry grumbled and rubbed his eyes as Draco kissed him goodbye.
It took a while but ultimately, Albus donned his mittens and snow boots and followed Draco outside, keeping a firm hold on his hand and skittering behind him as soon as the snowman was in view.
He was up and out of his seat at once, almost vaulting over the Gryffindor table in his haste to block Harry’s path.
Draco cracked a smile, even if it was a little shaky. “Duly noted, sir.”
James yawned again and closed his eyes, one hand reaching up to wrap itself in Draco’s robes. “Kay,” he mumbled sleepily. “Jus’ for a little while...”
“Exactly. Let’s hope this child doesn’t inherit your single brain cell.”
“So you’re suggesting that I find a dog with the sole purpose of distracting my boyfriend’s dog so I can shag him in peace,” Draco clarified incredulously. His brow furrowed as he went over that statement again. Huh. It had sounded a lot worse in his head. Actually, the idea had a rather Slytherin appeal now that he thought about it...
“I’ll do it,” Granger insisted, elbowing him aside again and pushing some of the bitter-root out of her workspace. “Just don’t do anymore wand-work right now.”
Granger squealed excitedly and clutched the book. “I can’t wait to get into this! I have so many questions! I’ll have to think of a research framework and a methodology…”
Draco nodded fretfully, his eyes scanning the vast room. The Eighth Year table was easily spotted, shunted right alongside the Gryffindors. The two mingled quite often. In fact, he could even see Ginevra Weasley at the table, cozying up to Longbottom and giggling as she stole from his plate. That, he would admit, helped bolster his spirits some.
Draco snorted. “He’s a toddler. He likes everything. Last week, I saw him giggling and squealing for two whole hours over a
“Oh, he’ll hear you out.” She pursed her lips and stared him down. “Malfoy, don’t underestimate my best friend. A lot of people have and they’ve ended up regretting it. He’ll step up, I guarantee it. But before that,
“You can always have another heir,” he cajoles. “Rebuild the family if Draco were to disappear. But ask yourself, Lucius, will you ever be Minister for Magic on your own?”
“Perhaps, I shouldn’t even mention what Dad and I went through when we were informed our
But that wasn’t the plan. He still needed to do this right. For the baby. So, he gathered himself and met eyes with Harry.
“He was here for hours before you finally woke up,” Draco added relentlessly. It hurt him to do this but it was long overdue. Twenty feet, that was all he could think of. Twenty
As if she would share this with
Wait. What?
Potter grinned and seated himself, sliding up to Draco a bit closer than strictly necessary. “I don’t remember seeing you here before,” he said teasingly. “Looking for some pointers, Malfoy?”
Silence settled on them like the aftermath of a curse.
She left them with another grateful nod and strode into the floo. Harry hid a grin at Draco’s wistful expression.
“I don’t need to think,” Draco muttered. “Just give me a potion so I can be done with it.”
Draco had half a mind to roll his eyes again. He couldn’t imagine why he let his fingers wrap around Potter’s instead. But, as they left Teddy to his devices — still ignoring them, by the way — and headed to the sofa for...conversation, he supposed he could figure it out later.
James sunk deeper into the alcove and huddled in his blanket as the spectral forms of two ghosts floated over. He’d only seen them briefly at the Feast, and if it wasn’t for Aunt Mione’s copy of
regret this.
“Draco!” Harry yelled, slumping on the couch and mentally willing the coffee to make itself this morning. “It’s for you!”
Draco had proceeded with his awful evening, firmly believing that it couldn’t possibly get any worse from here on out.
“Of course, Sir Nicholas,” the Friar agreed genially.
“You should come,” Draco offered, magnanimous as always. “I’m accepting new applications. I’ll bet you’d be a great MOANER.”
Harry’s heart leapt. He scrambled up at once, trying and failing to ignore the slight flutter of hope in his chest. “What’s the matter?”
wanted you. What made you think you couldn’t tell me?”
Potter grinned. Poison green eyes turned to the door, staring straight at him. Draco’s heart leapt to his throat.
reasons, to give up this child. And he knew it. He knew it was the sound, sensible thing to do.
“Well, yes,” Potter cut in. “Because you get all squirmy when I’m there!”
“Theo, it’s a dog,” Draco protested. “I hardly think I need a battle plan to...”
The thought made his stomach twist. He tried very hard not to think about how
This time, Potter flushed. Draco raised an eyebrow as colour rose to his cheeks in a most appealing manner. “That…would have worked too, I guess,” Potter stuttered. “I didn’t think…”
Harry looked utterly miserable. He was barely paying attention, even though Weasley was prattling on next to him, and he was pushing his food around with a wan, lifeless energy. It was awful and the guilt nearly made him cave.
“You can’t,” Draco retorted sullenly. “There’s no help for this. It’s done. I just have to deal with it alone.”
He’s definitely dying. But oh, he’s
“Are you playing hide and seek with your brothers?” he asked.
“I saw you two playing outside,” Harry said, running a gentle hand through Albus’s hair. “It was adorable.”
“So you’re studying for studying,” Draco remarked dryly. Why was he even surprised? At least she was consistent.
Put in that light, he could almost appreciate how ridiculous his reasoning sounded.
“I can do that,” Potter replied, his grin turning rakish. “Besides, Teddy has to nap sometime.”
He glanced at Padfoot — a normally reliable source of support — but all he got was another shrug. “Harry’s got good instincts,” Sirius pointed out.
He went back to his studies with a sigh of relief, letting Granger’s excited chattering fade away to background noise. Just a little longer and this would all be over.
Draco scowled and dug an elbow in his ribs. Potter laughed and dodged artfully, wrapping an arm around Draco and pulling him a little closer. “For the record,” he murmured, his voice teasing in Draco’s ear, “it’s called a calculator. Muggles use them to do sums.”
Harry cut a sharp arc and the broom dipped. Draco yelped as his stomach churned and his insides twisted but despite the momentary discomfort, he couldn’t stop laughing. Salazar, this was the most fun he’d had in ages. He hadn’t even realised how much he’d missed flying.
Lily scoffed incredulously. “Really, James?” she quipped. “
“If I wasn’t seeing it, I wouldn’t believe it,” she mumbled, shaking her head.
“Oh, so they’ve stopped coming into the bedroom to watch you and Daphne shag?” Draco asked innocently.
been doing two minutes ago…
It wasn’t something he’d signed up for, but Draco had to admit, he wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.
“This might be your worst metaphor ever.”
“No,” Draco replied crisply. “You’re mistaken.”
“I… I can’t...”
“Can you show us a new spell now?” one of them asked. “I want to learn the Slug Vomit Charm.”
It was only when the flames turned bright green and morphed into what he immediately recognised as Father’s study, that James considered his parents may not even be awake at this time of night. He needn’t have worried though because while blurry, that was definitely Father seated at his desk, scouring a Potions tome with an all too familiar expression of intense concentration.
Lily just pressed a kiss to his forehead. “He’s polite, charming, sweet and he likes my cooking. Trust me, we’re keeping this one,” she said firmly. Harry pulled her into a tight hug and she smiled into his hair. Everything would be just fine, she knew it. Lily gave her boy a reassuring squeeze before pulling away. “Now, let’s go find them, hm? I think a little dessert is just the thing to pull this party back together.”
“Draco.” Harry was scowling stubbornly and his tone brooked no argument. “Come

Salazar just barked and licked him again, prompting Draco to pick up the little nuisance and tuck him under his arm. Salazar’s tongue lolled out as Draco grudgingly carted him over to the living room. Godric perked up at the sight and barked in welcome.
Harry’s silence is answer enough.
forgotten about Teddy in all the chaos. Maybe he wasn’t so alone after all. And as he stared at his family, framed by the flames, he figured things could be a lot worse. Even if things didn’t work out here, at least he would always have people who loved him and believed in him.
“Those were my favourite trousers,” Draco grumbled. But he shifted off Harry— carefully and slowly. Then he turned around to look his old nemesis in the face.
“Draco!” he exclaimed. “You made it!”
“Ten times over,” Father promised. “You make us proud every day.”
Pansy’s response was drowned out by the gavel.
He drops the man. Lucius crumples and braces against the wall, one hand on his throat. His eyes fill with
A chuckle rang out behind him. Draco turned around and saw Harry approaching with little Helga and Rowena tucked under each arm. An anxious Helena followed close behind, ever the overprotective mother.
“What…?”
“But he…”
Well. It would appear he was mistaken.
tell her about the window you broke.”
“No,” Draco drawled. “Clearly not.” Potter looked about ready to melt into the floor, so Draco took pity on him. “Sit,” he ordered, shifting over and patting the couch. “Make yourself at home.”
“I’m going home,” he announced, stepping away and resolutely ignoring the crushed look on Potter’s face. “Goodbye.”
the nice one. Together! That had certainly never happened before. And…and were they…
Teddy, who’d been bouncing excitedly ever since Potter appeared, shrieked in delight and grappled for him with chubby arms. Potter leaned over to buss a kiss to his head. Draco swallowed again as he drifted near, bringing the curious and not entirely unappealing scent of wood-dust with him.
“What?! Why the hell would I...
“Oh, is it? Well, I was just heading out for a run and I thought I’d check in and say hi…”
“I tried! You snuggled me into submission, you brute!”
There it was.
“Like I said, you caught me mid-project. I could use a shower and I wouldn’t want to leave Teddy all by himself…”

He got another cheeky grin in response. “I wouldn’t expect you to. Besides, you clearly need them more than I do. Now come on, sit down and stop being homicidal for a minute.”

She turned on her heel and swept from the room. Draco watched warily as she paused at the doors for a moment.
“Quidditch,” he mumbled. How could he have missed…? He
Why did he insist on arguing with stubborn Gryffindors? Intractable mules, the lot of them.
Harry blinked. “I...sense that you’re implying it’s mine but I don’t really see how?”
They chuckled and swapped player stats until the announcements started. James shushed the boy and held the wireless up, craning to hear. Draco shuffled closer, all propriety promptly forgotten, contorting into James’s space to get a hint of the news. Puddlemere had the Quaffle, they lost it, they got it again, and…
A few days later, she was sunning herself on her rock when the door opened again. Marina looked up, half expecting the gorgeous blond boy.
“Teddy, do stop squirming,” Draco sighed as he hoisted the excited toddler in his arms.
Potter. Potter was here.
, he reminded himself firmly. No matter how much he wanted to, he couldn’t do that. He was here to teach James a lesson, not traumatise him. So he schooled his expression and turned back to his son again. “You do realise you’re not helping your case, don’t you?”
“Something better be on fire, you little mandrake,” Draco snapped as he bolted in. He skidded to a halt when Hugo stared at him with teary, blue eyes and lifted his arms in a not so silent demand to be held.
Pomfrey hesitated a moment. But then she nodded and patted his shoulder again. “Only if you promise to rest. And take better care of yourself.”

“Stop it!” Draco snapped. “William, enough! You will heel or so help me, I’m going t-
“And don’t forget, Teddy made Head Boy this year,” Dad added with a proud smile. “You know you can always go to him if you need help.”
“Um, Draco? What...”
“Okay?” Ron blinked, somewhat taken aback by the force of Harry’s rant. “Sorry,” he offered. “I just assumed...I mean you do spend a lot of time with him. And honestly, I’ve never seen you put this much effort into a date before.”
“Are you okay?” Potter was asking, one hand still bracing his waist. “I didn’t see…”
Hermione had to suppress a slightly hysterical giggle. “I think I’ve got it, thank you.”
“...when I thank Lawrence Fitzberger for last week’s illuminating presentation on
“I said,” he repeated slowly and meaningfully, “there’s a baby. Potter, there is a baby. Please tell me you understand and I don’t have to break out the finger puppets.”
“Sap,” Father accused with an eye-roll. But he smiled anyway and let Dad loop an arm around his shoulders. “And you’re not going to die in Herbology. As much as it pains me to say, Professor Longbottom is an expert and you couldn’t be in safer hands.”
“Please?” he implored sweetly.
“...hardly the first pregnant man in wizard history, are you?” Pomfrey’s voice was drifting in and out of focus. Draco took a shaky, stuttering breath and rallied to pay attention. If this was happening to him, he probably needed all the facts. “I know it’s rare and you were obviously not expecting this, but there’s nothing to fret over just yet. Why, you’re only six weeks along.”
...and apparently, it was never going to happen. Draco smiled and ruffled his hair gently. “I will always be there for you,” he promised. “Even if you are the most infuriating child I have ever come across. And I knew your Dad when he was your age so that is saying something.”
“Mr Malfoy.”
“Daco,” Teddy complained suddenly, planting a sticky hand on his cheek. “Hawweeeee...”
“I might have to get one of those myself,” Draco murmured thoughtfully.
“But...”
Al mumbled something vaguely unhappy but he just looped his arms around Draco and stayed put. Draco hummed thoughtfully to himself as he catalogued a few things he would need. Finally, he raised his wand and Summoned his old broomstick, a hat and a carrot.
Potter raised his eyebrows in frank surprise. Apparently, he hadn’t expected an actual conversation. “I do,” he answered, after a beat of silence. “They’re really smart, you know. Eager to learn and try new things. And they, I don’t know…” Potter trailed off and scrubbed the back of his head, looking a little embarrassed himself. “They don’t think of me as ‘The Saviour’ or whatever. I’m just the bloke who teaches them new spells. It’s...nice, I guess.”
thing,” Draco muttered. The nausea which had plagued him all night was slowly dissipating but the relief only brought the rest of his problems into sharp focus. Everything was a right mess and apparently, his own body was no exception. It was just another thing that had spiralled out of control.
“Stay where you are,
There. Now he knew
The flutter in his stomach tightened, twisting into a little knot of discomfort. It was like the baby knew.
Draco gave up as Harry went about coddling his pampered pet again. “I’m just saying the farm is an option,” he muttered.
Draco’s throat clenched. He didn’t respond. He just couldn’t.
William and Sasha observed them curiously before going back to nuzzling and fussing over each other. Draco cracked a smile, watching William make a complete arse of himself over the girl. When he turned, he noticed Potter grinning too. “Who would have thought, eh?”
Quidditch,” he informed his mother indignantly. “I’m just not a
Draco thought dryly.
Potter took his hand. “How about we try this step by step? You can start by calling me Harry, for one thing. And I could take you out on an actual date and we’ll see how things go.”
come together...for the right reasons.
She was doing that thing. That soothing, pacifying thing Healers did when they had bad news but also wanted to cushion the blow. Draco was neither soothed nor pacified. His stomach spasmed again and it made him want to jump up and demand answers at wand-point.
“No monster?”
Draco froze in his tracks. Potter smiled at the sight of them — Teddy in particular, he was sure. His hair was a fright and he was sporting those low slung denims he liked so much. There was a tool belt slung across his waist. Most noticeably however — and the reason Draco was having trouble formulating words anymore — was that Potter was shirtless. Shirtless with streaks of dirt running the length of his chest and tracking down his arms.
“Drying Charm?”
Draco’s eyes darted from the offered plate to the man’s sincere, open expression. “You...you’re giving...” He faltered slightly. This didn’t make any sense.
Fair enough. Fair. Enough.
Just for that, she executed a graceful flip, making him smile again. Suddenly, he started shuffling awkwardly. Marina frowned, wondering what the matter was.
“Are you sick?” Harry demanded, looking honestly, heartbreakingly worried for him. “Is that what this is all about?”
The sheer mayhem that followed the boy around was dismissed and shrugged off.
Draco swallowed. The phantom flutter beneath his fingers only cemented his consternation.
“Sirius.” Remus entered, sighing and shaking his head disapprovingly. “How many times…if you rile him up right before bed, he won’t sleep all night.”
“Potter?” he called, when the man himself showed no signs of appearing and greeting his guests like a civilized wizard.
The Floo flared up at six in the morning, bathing the corridors of their small flat in bright green. Harry muttered sullen curses under his breath as he stumbled, still half-asleep to the living room. If this was what he thought it was…
Harry had a firm grip and he sure as hell didn’t want to let go, but slowly and surely Draco was able to coax him into moving his arm. He heaved a sigh of relief as he wriggled out of Harry’s grip, only to find that the rest of him was still trapped under his boyfriend’s leg. Draco huffed irritation and resumed his squirming. Harry mumbled belligerently and he stiffened in alarm. But Harry just curled into his pillow and snored.
Ah, of course. Draco made a show of nodding solemnly and checking under the bed. “All clear,” he reported.
disappointed in him.
His vision cleared. He hadn’t even realised he’d been tearing up. Granger was watching him with wide eyes, her hands splayed in a placating gesture.
“Good for you,” Harry retorted.
The baby Snitch, as Draco had been calling it ever since he enchanted the little thing into being, fluttered clumsily. It flapped its wings and rose a few inches before collapsing under its own weight and tumbling into Potter’s careful grip again. Draco smiled as it buzzed petulantly. Perhaps he’d done too good a job at enchanting it. It was behaving, for all the world, like a petulant child.
“My son will
“I gather you’re outside your common room after dark? And that this call isn’t exactly authorised by your Head of House?” He hunched his shoulders guiltily, but Father just looked grudgingly amused. “I’m going to guess you weren’t placed in Slytherin then.”
“Hide.”
Dinner progressed, as dinners tend to do. James glared sullenly into his wine, resolutely ignoring the conversation around him despite Lily’s watchful eye. Everyone seemed to be doing just fine without his input anyway. Malfoy was having no trouble holding court. So far, he’d been a model guest — making easy conversation, showering Lily with compliments on everything from her Charms work to the food, liberally summoning wine…no doubt it was all those etiquette lessons Lucius Malfoy had obviously sprung for.
He just...didn’t know how.
“Male pregnancy?” Granger whispered, sounding utterly awed.”That’s amazing! How many cases are there? Is it common? Is it rare? On an average, what factors contribute to the success or failure…”
Wait,
Draco nodded along and let her prattle at him as he mused. Good. This was good. The wheels were in motion. Sooner or later, Granger would crack and Potter would be subjected to a seminar on male pregnancy. And once the bait was set, it was merely a question of easing him into the truth. Eventually, even that obtuse idiot would see the light. Draco was sure of it.
“Kinky little flounder,” he tutted amusedly. “Enjoying the show?”
He wouldn’t. He couldn’t.
James held up his hands in defeat at Moony’s warning tone. They’d collectively learned a long time ago that The Tone was not to be ignored. “Fine
The blond slipped his robe off and she flipped her tail in anticipation. The slight splashing alerted him and he turned to her. Marina smiled and waved at him; the blond responded with a sexy smirk that made her shiver.
“You want to know what I’ll demand as payment,” Potter finished. His smile flickered as he turned a lazy eye in Father’s direction. “It’s been, what? Eight years of ‘favours’? It’s a bit late to renegotiate, Malfoy. You’ve been perfectly happy extorting my services for free so far.”
“That’s awful,” Harry murmured as sincerely as he possibly could. He bit his lip to stifle another chuckle and pulled Draco into his arms. “Merlin, I feel like such an arse.”
Draco’s heart clenched in his chest. “Potter…”
As expected.
that they finally settled.
The golden retriever ignored him and bolted at Harry like a bullet, whimpering in concern. Harry scratched his ears and murmured reassurances but the thrice-damned mongrel wasn’t convinced. He turned on Draco again, tail bristling in reproach.
Draco held up a hand to still the bloke’s nervous babbling. It was giving him a headache. When his head stopped spinning and his vision finally cleared, the first thing he saw was brilliant, green eyes gazing anxiously at him.
What the…? Draco was swiftly running out of patience.
Harry smiled and approached him with a steaming mug of hot chocolate. Draco was only too happy to accept the drink and a kiss.
now. But Potter just made a small exasperated noise in his throat and shook his head. “Merlin, it’s always studying with you two.”
Lily grinned and ruffled his hair. “You know what I mean.”
“Albus,” Draco chided gently, “I promise there’s nothing to worry about. Honestly, it’s not even a very
