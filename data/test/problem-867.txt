Malfoy's eyes are oddly expressionless. "I have a few months left of my community service. Not sure what it will be."
They hold each other's gaze, both still smiling, and a thrill runs through Draco. If he loved the intensity of Potter's eyes back in the old days, this is an entirely new twist on that theme.
Quietly, Draco points out: "Well. There was that time at the Manor, when I tried to save your arse. And later, right here, when you did save mine."
Draco's eyebrows go up suggestively. "Oh? Well, you're not often right, but in this instance I completely agree. It's most definitely time for bed."
A few whispered spells later, the room is a meadow with soft grass and wildflowers. Poppies and cornflowers bow their heads under the weight of drowsy bees. A gentle breeze runs its fingers through the grass and the sun is warm on Draco's face.
They lean against each other for a minute after, catching their breath. Now that the urgency is gone, insecurity returns, and already Draco is wondering what this is to Harry, if it means anything more than a one-time thing, a way to let off steam.
"How very kind of you!" Mr Monet beams at him. "I'm not quite done yet, as you can probably tell. I need a little more light and radiance here, on this side, and perhaps a bit of red over here. Do you like art in general?"
Harry raises himself on his elbow, looking down at Draco's face. "I don't know. What would you like to happen? I hoped you'd come to the gallery and see the paintings, but I didn't think beyond that." He sinks down on his back again. "Hell, yes, I did. I wanted you to come back so I could tell you how much I've missed you. And how sorry I am - how very,
"Easy," Harry says and sits up, turning to look at Draco over his shoulder. "We live happily ever after."
With the help of Tower & Thorne, the jewellers in Diagon Alley, he creates an intricate dial with golden dragons that yawn and stretch, leap and breathe fire. It makes him smile and it makes his heart pound, because anyone who looks at it will see that it's made with love.
Potter pinches his lip, looking at the blackened ruins with a furrow between his eyebrows, and nods. "Sounds good to me. We'll figure it out along the way. I'm not terrific with sensor charms, to be honest, but I'm sure Professor Flitwick can help. - Let's start with the Scourgify, then!"
It's embarrassing how Draco keeps noticing every little thing about Potter: the ways his eyes crinkle when he laughs, how a bone protrudes at his wrist, how his eyebrows are drawn together when he concentrates hard. His tanned hand holding a piece of parchment flat, fingers splayed.
"View it as an exercise in self-control," says McGonagall dryly. "And teamwork. You are to restore the Room of Requirement from the bottom up, and careful planning is an absolute necessity. Once your plan is ready it will need to be approved by the new Board of Governors and myself. After that, the physical construction work will be done, followed by the spellwork. Potter, you will have to do all the hands-on spellwork since Malfoy isn't allowed a wand yet. I think that's all. Good luck, and do try not to kill each other."
While he's gone, Harry looks around at the yard with its pretty pattern of cobblestones, surrounded by flowers - roses, lilies, lavender. The sound of water leads his eye to a tiny fountain where a stone frog spouts a  thin, glittering water jet into the air. The sun is hot but the shade underneath the lime tree is pleasant.
"Being an Auror. I know people sort of expect me to, or at least that I get a job at the Ministry, but I'm not cut out for office work and I've had enough of chasing down bad guys for a lifetime."
"Is there any chance you could…" How do Muggles contact one another? "...give me his number?" Draco crosses his fingers, hoping this is the correct thing to say.
Draco adjusts his head on Harry's shoulder. "I remember the first time we were here. With the steaming water and the cold sky, and... and
Doing research with Malfoy is unexpectedly interesting. He's smart and comes up with a lot of good ideas, and towards the end of the day they're beginning to have an idea about what kind of spells they need, and what they'll have to research further.
He lets the piece of parchment fall to the floor and looks up at the canopy of the bed, not sure how he feels. A little sad that it's all over.
"Yes, clean everything up first so we can actually breathe around here without gagging," Draco says. "And then start thinking about weaving the net of spells. There must be layers and layers of magic. Wards, concealment charmes, expansion and compression charms... And the sensor ones, of course. Wish sensors, requirement sensors. What do you think?"
There was a whole Muggle world he didn't know very much about, and maybe he didn't belong there anymore, but he wanted to find out for sure. He wanted to see what he'd missed. So he went to sports games and concerts, cinemas and bars, museums and bookstores, and surprised himself by loving it.
"But now I think it was for selfish reasons. Because I wanted to be back in your life." He lifts his eyes to Draco's, half apologetic. "The hand is easily removed if you don't want it there."
But Draco also remembered how Potter's eyes had flashed with confidence and determination. Once again he had defied the killing curse and returned from the dead. There had been nothing left to fear.
Harry removes his glasses, his gaze finding Draco's, serious now. Intense. He catches Draco's wrists, sliding his hands up Draco's arms to his elbows, pushing him gently against the wall. The touch sends sparks up Draco's spine, heat to his groin.
Draco started visibly when he saw who it was, and a blush began to bloom along his cheekbones. For a long moment they just looked at each other. "I could say the same to you, Potter."
Harry closes the door. They're standing in the narrow, dimly lit hallway, just like that first time. So much has changed, but some things haven't. Draco's eyes are still the colour of stormclouds. Harry still wants to kiss him.
She looks him up and down, as if trying to decide whether or not he can afford to pay. She shows no sign of recognising him from the paintings, but perhaps she's just a good actress. "Oh, yes?"
Harry leans his head back and smiles up at the dancing snowflakes. He's warm all the way to his toes.
Harry sits by his desk with the photos in front of him. Narcissa is beautiful, dignified and a little stern. Scorpius looks the viewer in the eye with an openness his father has never had. And Draco… Harry swallows. Draco looks as lost as Harry does on his own family clock.
" He gestures between them, and the gesture encompasses all the years they've been apart, all the longing, all the memories, and the trembling anticipation of the present moment.
"I know." Draco's own voice seems to come from afar. "I know. Me too. All these years... Creepy, maybe, but I'm glad we're here."
"Of course you did, and of course it had nothing to do with being a great excuse for contacting me. You're many things, Malfoy, but subtle isn't – mmph!"
Draco is breathing fast now, propping himself up on his elbows so he can look at Harry, see if he's really going to do what Draco thinks he means to do. So far, they've only used their hands, but the thought of Harry's mouth…
"McGonagall has asked me to come to the Headmaster's office, but after that I'm off, yes." Harry chases the last of his scrambled eggs around his plate with his fork. "What about you?"
There are a couple of boyfriends, but nothing really serious. Sometimes Harry feels he's all surface and no depth; sometimes the depth is there but he's scared of diving. Sometimes he thinks he once held the key to his own happiness in his hands and let it slip away.
Harry smiles back. "Some people will probably think it's a weird choice, but then I'm not going to tell a lot of people about it. I'm going back to the Muggle world, to Muggle London. I want to go to art school."
Despite Draco's request, they're in no hurry. They take their time exploring each other. Harry's skin is so smooth underneath Draco's fingertips. Draco slides his mouth down Harry's chest, across his ribs; raising goosebumps in its wake; his hand resting on Harry's thigh. Harry pulls him back up, closes his fingers around Draco's cock in a loose fist and begins to work him slowly, gently, until stars burst behind Draco's eyelids and he's begging Harry to go faster, harder...
tell me how the gallery visit went." She reaches up on her toes and kisses Draco on the cheek. "Good luck with that, too!"
Draco looks around to check if there's anyone to witness his pink face and unsteady hands, but thankfully he is the only visitor, and the woman with the talons is reading her book.
Soul-searching is a gruelling thing, and not something Draco has engaged in much before. But if nothing else, house-arrest is inducive to thinking.
"You should go to Nice, Aix-en-Provence, Cagnes-sur-Mer… See the greats," Mr Monet tells him, enthused and amused by Harry's fervour. "Chagall, Matisse, Picasso, Cézanne, Renoir! If you don't mind going in my rusty old Renault, we could take a tour? A roadtrip! What do you say?"
Malfoy. He's even begun to notice Malfoy's looks, which are really not bad at all now he's lost his former, perpetual expression of contempt. He used to look like he'd bitten into something foul, but these days his face is in repose, his grey eyes calm and observant. Harry hates to admit it, but Malfoy is actually quite hot.
He has no regrets leaving Hogwarts behind - he can come back here any time he wishes. Leaving Malfoy is another matter. But they haven't talked about it, whatever this is between them, and it's not very likely Malfoy would want a long-term relationship or even a short-term one. A reconstruction fling, that's what this is for both of them.
Draco is actually touched. "I'd like that. Thanks for asking me. As for Weasley, er, Ron… well, if he hates me, he hates me. I'll just take a deep breath. No pub brawl, I promise."
"No, and I'm glad of that." Harry moves down, kissing Draco's belly, nudging Draco's thighs apart so he can fit himself in between them.
McGonagall puts her teacup back on its saucer. "So, Potter, what are you going to do next? I assume you have plans?"
For a moment, Draco is unable to speak. Then he leans over and kisses Harry softly on the mouth. "For an intelligent person, you're really stupid sometimes. You could have just
Occasionally, in his nightmares, he saw Potter as he had looked on that terrible day when Hagrid had carried his lifeless body into Hogwarts. And as he had looked standing before the Dark Lord - thin, ashen, marked by exhaustion and grief. A child challenging a mighty dragon.
Harry smiles, turning his whiskey glass in his hands. "I thought you should have more people in your life. At least, that's what I told myself."
Once he's done, there's a row of them on the wall. A portrait gallery of the dead. And Harry's tears begin to flow at last.
There are some re-entry problems like remembering not to use magic for everyday things. In one of their first watercolour classes, Harry knocks over his water jar and instinctively saves it with magic before it hits the floor. Not a drop is spilled. Shocked by his own carelessness, he quickly looks around the room. Everyone is too absorbed by their own work to notice, except for one student - from across the room, he meets the wide eyes of a quiet girl whose name he hasn't learnt yet.
Draco leans his head back so he can look up at Harry and says in his haughtiest, most drawling voice: "I have no earthly idea to whom you're referring."
Again very casual, again a question on the tail of a conversation about Hogwarts: "So, have you heard from Harry lately? How is he?"
"Not at all," he says out loud. "I've never been to a Muggle pub and I've never had fish and chips, although I've heard about it. I don't mind broadening my views a little."
"Like going to the Muggle world." She looks at Harry as if summing him up, seeing the same things, he assumes, that he sees when he looks at her - someone pale, gaunt and utterly exhausted.
Harry looks around the Headmaster's office, which looks pretty much the same as it did when Dumbledore was Headmaster of Hogwarts. It feels familiar and reassuring, but heartbreaking all the same.
This is supposed to be punishment, Draco thinks as he watches Potter lay the groundwork for the spells before the construction wizards are brought in. Most of the time it feels like anything but. In some ways it's torture, but on the other hand he gets to look at Potter all day, stand next to him so close their shoulders touch, chat with him over lunch and even on a few occasions laugh so hard they both wipe tears from their eyes.
Malfoy, frozen halfway between sitting and standing, opens his mouth to say something but no words come. He lets go of Harry's hand and stands up properly, running a finger between his collar and his neck, and nods.
Ginny's lip trembled a little at that, but she pressed her mouth into a hard line to hide it. "Remove it."
Then there was Potter, and Draco had finally been able to see what so many others had recognised years ago, but Draco's own pettiness, envy and jealousy had prevented him from seeing: there was strength there, and courage. And although Draco found it hard to admit, there was also nobility. Not only of blood, although Potter certainly did have the lineage, descended from the powerful Peverells as he was, but a wonderful balance; a core of loyalty, compassion and love. Things that Draco had always scorned, because his family had scorned them.
Hermione seems to have decided to let bygones be bygones. Perhaps she has talked to McGonagall, perhaps she has talked to Harry, or perhaps she has merely concluded that people can change. In any case, she is generous with her advice and support, and with consulting Draco about treatments. Their discussions about the latest research are always interesting.
They kiss again, with slightly more finesse this time, but not much, because Harry presses Draco up against the wall, wedging himself in between Draco's thighs and pushing his hips forward just enough for them both to feel how hard the other is. The back of Draco's head meets the wall with a thud.
He sits with his head bent and eats in silence. Perhaps he's had enough Potter for one day. Weirdly, Harry doesn't feel he's overdosed on Malfoy - yet.
Just as he opens his mouth to say he'll come back another day, her gaze moves to something behind him and her entire demeanour changes. Her face softens, she is all smiles, smoothing a strand of her hair seductively behind her ear. "Actually, here he is. You can talk to him in person."
They like the one where the pale body is stretched out on a bed, a wine-coloured sheet draped strategically across the hips. The one with a white-knuckled fist bunching up the sheets. The one where the model's head is thrown back, throat exposed, rosy pink with orgasmic flush…
One rainy autumn afternoon he walked slowly through the rooms of the National Gallery past paintings by Picasso and Cézanne, van Gogh and van Eyck, Caravaggio and Monet. In the Turner room he stopped to admire
Before he knows it, autumn arrives with cool air and misty mornings, and the leaves begin to turn. Harry rides the bike past brown and yellow fields and rows of blazing red vines, before going back to the house to light a fire for his afternoon painting session. He drinks coffee and thinks of colours, hues, moods.
"I go occasionally." Draco turns around from the stove where he is seasoning a cassoulet. Pansy has never understood why he is "so fond of doing elf work" - a sentiment she shares with Draco's mother - but the truth is he finds cooking calming and creative, just like gardening. He still spends a lot of his time in the garden at Malfoy Manor, and visitors often say it has never looked this beautiful. That's probably due to the fact, Draco thinks, that for the first time in a long time, maybe ever, it's shaped and tended with love. Neither his father nor his grandfather had any interest in gardens, but only wanted well-tended grounds for the sake of grandeur. "I do go to Muggle London now and then, Pansy. Why?"
For several days now, Potter has appeared at breakfast with stained fingers. It looks like soot. What does he do in his spare time, light fires? Potter the Pyromaniac, that'd be something for the press to write about.
A smile pulls at the corners of Draco's mouth. "And working with me is - what, a wonderful reward for killing the Dark Lord?"
It's new and familiar all at once. Eight years is a long time, but Draco has never never forgotten the feel of Harry's skin, or the way his body tenses when he pushes his hips up, or the sounds he makes when he comes.
A few visits to the National Gallery as a kid is Harry's only encounter with art, not counting the moving portraits in the Wizarding world. "I think so. I don't have much experience with it."
"Sit, sit!" The old man pats the space next to him on the wooden bench. "I'll fetch us some lemonade."
Draco shivers, head to toe, his fingers finding Harry's hard nipples under his t-shirt and playing with them until Harry groans.
"Mr Evans," the lady chirps, "this gentleman has expressed an interest in buying some of your paintings."
As Draco Malfoy stands, Harry leans forward in his seat not to miss a word. His fingers are crossed and he's holding his breath.
"Narcissa Malfoy saved my life. Without her, the war could have ended very differently." Harry holds out his hands for Teddy. "Let me take him for a bit?"
Once upon a time, Ron Weasley calling him "mate" would have made Draco's stomach turn - not, of course, that he'd ever have called him that. Now it feels strangely reassuring. Draco allows Ron to refill his glass, bites his lip and decides not to pursue the subject.
Pansy is laughing out loud. "I have no idea, but it's definitely you! You should go and see it. I mean, since you seem to know the artist
With dry eyes and a dull ache in his heart, Harry begins to make charcoal drawings of faces. Its's the faces of all those he misses: Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore. Sirius. Fred Weasley. Even Snape. He isn't skilled enough yet to do them justice, but sketching them, working on them, is therapeutic.
"Happily ever after, huh?" Draco says. He's afraid to believe anything of the kind, but right now, it actually feels possible. "As simple as that, is it?"
Harry leans forward to look at Mr Monet's canvas, where layers of paint overlap and blend into each other. It's not figurative, but the colour patterns suggest light and shade on a summer's day.
Harry laughed. If this was the new Draco, he could definitely get to like him. "Monsters is right. Being a teenager would have been horrible enough even without all the… even without…" He swallowed. "Without the war and everything."
The problem is the nights. There isn't all that much to do, unless you want to go on working. After dinner in the Great Hall, Malfoy disappears to Merlin knows where - the dungeons, probably, if they still exist. And Harry retreats to his own room to find something to do until bedtime.
"I'm sorry," Harry says again. "I think I really loved you back then, too, but I wasn't ready for it. I wasn't ready to commit. There was a lot of things I wasn't ready for. Looking back now, I know I was depressed, and it made me kind of detached. Numb, in a way. I didn't mean to be selfish, but I was. I just thought you'd be better off without me."
Draco's brain feels blank, as if someone has erased everything but the mere basics. "I don't know anyone with that name."
He loses track of time as he works, and consequently a good bit of sleep, but it's hard to stop. It's cathartic, drawing his history like this.
Draco blinks the tears from his eyes, clears his throat and approaches the haughty lady at the desk, willing himself not to blush in front of her.
"Do you want to go somewhere else," Harry said with a shiver of nerves, "or would you like to come back to my place for some Firewhiskey?"
It looks a bit like the boys' dorm, with more luxury. There's a four-poster bed, a wood-burning stove, two armchairs and a table. The door he'd thought was a closet turns out to be a bathroom, fitted out like a smaller Prefect's Bathroom with a large tub and plenty of taps.
Draco finds he's laughing, too, pushing his wet hair out of his eyes and wiping water from his face. "You look like a drowned rat!"
"I know Ron and you have never seen eye to eye, but I think it's time he starts to behave like an adult," she says dryly, and adds, "I already know
good, but he does love it. Mr Monet seems to enjoy having a student as avid as Harry. He teaches him how to prepare a canvas and mix paints, and use brushes and palette knives. Even the names of the colours sound magical, a different kind of magic that sparks Harry's imagination. Cadmium yellow. Titanium white. Prussian blue.
"I've missed you," Harry murmurs, his lips two inches from Draco's. "I've missed you so much. You have no idea. I want to…" He stops himself, pulls back and grins a little. "Is this creepy? I don't want it to be. It's just… I've wanted to…"
"This is the Potter Room," she says. She seems delighted to tell him this. "It's entirely yours and it will always be ready for you. You can come here whenever you want, stay as long or short as you like, and socialise or not, whichever you prefer. Think of it as your own sanctuary."
"So, what now?" Draco asks, remembering thinking the same thing back at Hogwarts and never saying it out loud.
The south of France. A holiday abroad. Harry had dreamed about this as a child - an unattainable dream back then.
Now, it seemed impossible to push Potter out of his head. Asleep or awake, he dreamed of Potter's face, his hands, his eyes. He dreamed of pushing Potter's wild hair off his forehead and leaning in to kiss the lightning-bolt scar. He dreamed of Potter slowly unbuttoning his shirt for Draco's benefit, holding Draco's gaze with that intensity that made the hairs stand up on Draco's arms and tiny sparks of pleasure run down his spine.
"Hello?" says Harry hesitantly, unsure whether Mr Monet speaks English. "I'm Harry Potter, I'm staying next door at the Grangers' house...?"
He expected Draco to taunt, but it didn't happen. Instead, Draco placed his hands on the table with his palms down. "I think we need something stronger than coffee. Let's go find a bar."
Draco looks up at the ceiling, where Harry's swirling charcoal patterns have been temporarily replaced by blue sky. "But I didn't."
The sensor charms are being very thoroughly tested. This time there's a bed, a generous four-poster with dark red sheets. Harry snorts. "That's really tacky! Definitely
Harry's breath is hot against Draco's neck, Draco's fingers knotted in Harry's hair, as Harry fumbles the button of Draco's trousers open. "Yes?" he whispers.
Harry pulls him down on it, his hands already sliding up underneath Draco's shirt, tugging at it. He's still smiling, but there's a hint of insecurity that he tries to cover up by kissing Draco's neck, drawing a wet pattern with his tongue on Draco's heated skin.
"Well, you'll want to as well." By now, she's unable to contain her giggles. "There's an entire room full of nudes or at least semi-nudes, quite tasteful really, and for anyone who knows you" - she puts emphasis on
Draco's mother didn't approve. "Draco, dear, why do you insist on doing squib work?" But Draco enjoyed clipping hedges, pruning trees, chopping wood and pushing wheelbarrows filled with mulch. It was penance, perhaps, but it was also satisfying work. It had the extra bonus of making him exhausted and helping him sleep at night.
As fate would have it, Draco ends up working with Hermione Granger at St Mungo's. They've arrived here by different routes - she as a specialist in restoring the memories of Obliviated patients, he as a potions expert - but their fields often overlap. Unsurprisingly, she is brilliant at her work. A little more surprisingly, they work well together.
He pushes his fingers into Harry's hair, but gently, not wanting to scare him off. His eyes fall shut as he feels Harry's mouth on him, warm, wet. Maybe he should be embarrassed about his own moans, but he can't stop them, only give in to the sensation.
A week goes by, two, and it does get better. Harry's energy gradually returns. He swims in the pool, sleeps in a lounge chair in the sun, and walks into the village for a coffee. When he finds a bike in the garden shed he rides it along dusty roads past orange groves and lavender fields. He eats the most wonderful grapes and peaches and tomatoes he's ever tasted.
There's a moment of deafening silence before Hermione replies lightly, in a voice an octave above her normal pitch: "Oh, he's fine! - Ron, can you take these plates to the kitchen? I'll get the dessert!"
"It's splendiferous, mate!" Ron said when he first saw it and thumped Harry on the shoulder. "Not pretty? Remember ours? This one's a beauty."
Sunlight is flooding the room when Harry packs his trunk the next morning, using one of Hermione's spells to get the last things to fit. It's a beautiful day and he spends a few minutes standing by the window to take in the views.
"Yep," Harry says, lying down again with one arm across Draco's chest. "I mean, we have to start somewhere. And happily ever after seems like a good starting point to me."
He hadn't anticipated the emotional impact. If these paintings represent memories, wishes, dreams, then they're not only the artist's dreams but equally Draco's own. He stares at the daisies threaded in his hair, at the tanned hand whose fingers are lovingly pushed into the strands of it, and feels tears rise to his eyes.
"They will have a memorial," she says softly, "and we will honour them and remember them every day. - Oh, I forgot to say that you can Apparate to and from this room if you like. We removed the restrictions for you. Are you ready to start working? Yes? Good. Come with me."
These paintings are entirely different from the coolly structured, abstract paintings of the other room. These are emotional, feverish, immediate, and filled with longing. Memories, dreams, or wishes.
"It's been waiting to happen, hasn't it," Harry says, and Draco can only nod. His fingers are still bunched up in Harry's t-shirt and he doesn't want to let go. "I don't think we should do this here, though."
There's something he wants to do, something he's been dreading, and one afternoon he decides it's time.
"I really like your painting," he tells Mr Monet who returns with the lemonade. "I don't know anything about art, less than nothing really, but I can't stop looking at this one."
other people, making jokes at their expense. Things like self-deprecation, or laughing at themselves, had been completely unknown to Draco and his friends.
"Thanks. It was mostly due to boredom." He pulls Draco close. "I know something else we can do to stave off boredom right now though…"
This morning, a school owl dropped two letters into Harry's scrambled eggs. He hasn't had time to read them until now, after dinner in the Great Hall, after Draco left for the Slytherin dungeons.
makes a dent in the spellwork. When it's over, Harry is panting and sweating, his hair is on end and he's tossed his jumper on the floor. Draco is rock hard.
Harry pushes his chair back and rubs at his eyes. He might as well go to bed for all the work he's getting done tonight. But before he does, he pulls out a desk drawer and picks up a sheet of parchment, frowning down at it.
There's a pause filled with heartbeat and breathing. Then Draco pulls Harry to him and kisses the damp hair at his temple. "I always knew you were soppy, Potter." He adds in a whisper: "Thank you."
One afternoon, Harry is painting in the living-room as autumn rain drums against the window panes. A fire is crackling in the grate and the wind howls in the chimney. When McGonagall's face unexpectedly appears among the flames, flickering and sputtering, and asks him to come back to Hogwarts to help rebuild it, he surprises himself once again by saying yes.
A faint smile is still playing around Harry's lips. "I have an idea. Let's try the wish sensors. The requirement sensors. Let's see what they give us."
It's the strangest thing, sitting here with Malfoy almost as if they're friends. They've certainly talked more today than in all those Hogwarts years together, and in very different tones. As surprises go, Malfoy has been a very pleasant one so far.
So this is the kind of friendship Draco lost out on all these years. He used to think friendship wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Other people mostly provided a way to get what he wanted, and not sit alone at meals. This is something else entirely.
It had to be him, and it had to be the Room of Requirement, which holds some of the worst memories of Draco's life. He glances at Potter, whose worst memories must be far worse than that.
They've been talking about the rebuilding of Hogwarts, and Draco has told them some amusing but innocent anecdotes about the restoration of the Room of Requirement (keeping the juicy ones to himself).
It could be an innocent question and then again it might not be. All through the evening he'd been looking at Draco's stormcloud eyes, at the blue veins on the inside of his wrists, at the way his mouth stretched when he smiled, and he wasn't ready to let go yet. They had loathed each other all through Hogwarts, they had almost got each other killed and then they had saved each other's lives. One thing was certain: they had never been indifferent towards one another.
two worlds, that gives the whole thing a symbolism that pleases him. The Muggle world and the wizarding world made him who he is, he created his family, he built the clock. There's the Muggle craftsmanship of the clockwork and casing, there's the spellwork for the trackers and the family member hands. He likes making all those small parts come together, work together, make a whole.
Draco swallows. He had no idea Harry had noticed, and he has no idea what to say. Admit it? Deny it? Both options feel equally impossible.
He is unusually quiet this morning and there's a different look about him, as if a shadow has fallen across his face.
Thinking back on his own life, Draco didn't remember much laughter in it at all. Everything he'd done, everything he'd ever believed or been made to believe, had been based on negativity. Loathing. Contempt. The oppression of others.
He glances up at Dumbledore's portrait and finds it beaming down at him. "Find your own way, Harry," it says. "That's the most important thing."
The sky had cleared after the rain, and they lay in the steaming tub with Draco's back on Harry's chest as they watched the stars.
So long ago, and it still has the power to hurt. Let it go, he's told himself over and over. Just drop it. Forget Potter. There are other fish in the sea.
One corner of Draco's mouth went up. "You've been itching to ask that ever since you came up to me."
, and when he turned around he saw a man on the other side of the room that made him draw a breath – someone who looked familiar in an impossible way... No, it couldn't be. Not in Muggle London. Not dressed like that. He was looking at a Gainsborough on the opposite wall and had his back turned, but when he walked slowly to the next painting, Harry had a glimpse of his profile. It was definitely Draco Malfoy.
"My parents have a house in the south of France," she continues, "and it's… well, I guess it's mine now, sort of." She swallows. "I'm not sure if my parents know, or remember, they have it. Anyway, you'd be welcome to go there."
It's not just the idea of keeping track of family that appeals to Harry. It's the merging of the two worlds,
If he's honest with himself, and he mostly is these days, this isn't just about friendship. For Draco, it's beyond that. Far beyond. It doesn't seem to be for Potter, but Draco can live with that - for now. While he comes to terms with it. With how he feels.
A good thing he saved Potter's arse, too, because it's looking fine in those jeans. Perhaps this won't be so bad after all.
Then Ginny finished her Quidditch, Astoria came back from her travels around the world, and it was time to grow up and live in the real world. Time to step into the conventional roles that the world had prepared for them.
Draco did look different, and it wasn't his Muggle clothes or the fact that he was older. There was something in his eyes, in his whole demeanour. No insecurity, no belligerence, none of the old contempt towards the world in general. He looked calm and firm, like he had finally come into his own.
He was in jeans and a thin, dark green wool jumper. The soft rubber soles of his suede shoes made his steps noiseless. He looked calm and relaxed with his hands in his pockets, very different from the way he'd looked at Hogwarts or Malfoy Manor – or the Wizengamot, where Harry had seen him last.
When they leave the room for a five-minute break, there's a whisper behind him: "I know what you did."
Draco took a sip of his black coffee. "Why not? Don't you think it's about time we got to know each other? Properly, I mean. Now that we're not... teenage monsters anymore."
He thinks of the box of charcoal and the tubes of acrylic paint waiting in his trunk. They'll save his life, or at least his sanity.
He looks at the dark hairs on Potter's tanned forearms, at the way Potter's hair grows in a funny whirl at the back of his neck, how the jeans hug his hips…
Harry's heart begins to pound as Draco puts his glass down on the table and asks: "Do you still have that bathroom on the top floor?"
"I have no idea." Harry looks down at his fish and chips (which is Ron's newfound Muggle favourite). "I haven't had time to think about what I'd do when all this was over. Now it is, and - I have no idea what to do next. This house needs to be done up properly before I can actually live there for real, but even then…" He stops and rubs his eyes. "There are things I know I don't want to do though."
The Chief Warlock eyes him sternly. "Mr Malfoy. Considering your youth and the pressure you were under, and of course the fact that Harry Potter has testified in your defence, the Wizengamot has decided to be lenient. You are hereby sentenced to three months house arrest followed by six months community service, the nature of which will be decided at a later date."
This bathroom is one of the best ideas Harry ever had. Plotting to get Draco back into his life may prove to be an equally good one.
This letter leaves a soft smile on Harry's face. He's so very glad things are going well for Ron and Hermione.
know where she was at all times. He'd only know if she was at Home (which he already knew she wouldn't be, at least not their home at Grimmauld Place), at The Burrow, Work, School, Travelling, Lost or in Mortal Peril. "And if it's that last option, I'd like to think I'd come to your aid whether we're divorced or not."
There's a thickness in his throat, a weird sensation in his chest and behind his eyes. Perhaps he's coming down with something.
Now that he wandered the halls of Malfoy Manor, having nothing to do but think, he always seemed to remember Potter laughing.
The library is miraculously intact and Madam Pince is still here. It's completely empty except for the three of them, but the boys are still shushed emphatically when they talk too loudly.
"Harry," Delphine says afterwards, when they've gathered at Mr Monet's house for coffee and brandy, "my father wanted you to have his easel. I don't really know why because I'm sure you have your own, but he asked me to give it to you so here it is."
When it was obvious Ginny and Harry wouldn't be able to save their marriage and Ginny moved out, she asked him – no, ordered him – to remove her hand from the clock.
Pansy shrugs. "No idea. Never heard of him. Bland name - Evans. I don't even remember the first name."
Harry laughs again, a different kind of laugh, husky, breathless. "Come upstairs. We can talk more… later. I want...
Draco rallies his wits, surreptitiously wipes his palms on his jeans and extends a hand towards Harry.
The fact that Hermione's found her calling makes him a little envious, too. She's found something worthwhile, something that will really make a difference in people's lives. The only thing Harry wants to do is paint. And when he thinks about it - why shouldn't he? He has enough money, it's not as if he's desperate for a job, and if it doesn't work out he can always do something else. Perhaps someone would even pay good money for him to write his autobiography.
"Oh, Hermione." Harry pulls her into a hug. "If there's anything I can do, let me know? And I mean anything."
Potter is silent for a heartbeat, two. "There's that," he says, and turns to look at what's left of the Room of Requirement. The stench of Fiendfyre is overwhelming. "I don't even know where to start, apart from a thorough cleaning. Vanish all the burnt stuff?"
He gives McGonagall a nod, shakes Professor Flitwick's hand, and sits down by himself. A number of serving plates and dishes immediately appear on the table around him, and with a smile he notices that all his old favourites are there. Chicken and ham pie. Treacle tart.
The gallery is small, with two tiny rooms and a desk where a haughty-looking woman with nails like red hippogriff talons sits leafing through a book. The walls are hung with double rows of paintings to make them all fit.
Draco walks up to the window, looking out at the summer-hot London street through the blur of tears, trying to decide whether he is offended, flattered or merely confused. But maybe he's none of those. The lingering feeling, once he begins to sort through all his emotions, all the layers of them, is longing. Longing and love.
The Grangers' house is small, neat and rustic, the outside walls whitewashed and covered with cascades of climbing roses. The garden at the back has an emerald green lawn, a herb patch with fragrant tufts of lavender, and a small swimming pool.
"Well, at first Ron and I thought we'd go there too, but I won't be able to relax or rest until I've seen my parents." Hermione is blinking away tears now. "So Ron is coming with me to Australia. I've contacted a specialist in memory restoration of Obliviated patients, and..."
Harry had a quick, heated debate with himself whether to slip out of the room unnoticed, but he'd never been one to back down from a challenge. Instead, he sauntered across the room pretending to look at the painting Draco had just left, inching closer until they were standing side by side.
"We've done a good day's work here, Malfoy," Harry says. "I never thought I'd say this, but we seem to make a good team."
They stay in Harry's bed all afternoon while thunder rumbles, lightning flashes and sheets of rain are flung against the windows.
Draco was studying him with a slightly puzzled look. "You said I look like I know who I am. Don't you? Know who you are, I mean."
In front of the fire, there's a long silence before Draco asks: "Why did you make that addition to the clock?"
They'd had a bit of an on again, off again relationship and eventually they'd taken a break to think. Ginny was away with the Holyhead Harpies. Harry busied himself refurbishing the House of Black, and when that was done he roamed Muggle London, trying to figure out who he was and what he wanted in life.
Something deep within Harry, a tiny voice of protest, is quickly pushed down and silenced, and Harry heads down to the Great Hall for breakfast.
He bites his lip at the thought of Ginny. They have decided to take a break from each other while she pursues her Quidditch career, and he both misses her and not. The "not" part makes him feel guilty.
That's not what's bothering him, though. It's not the most opulent or snobbish request he's seen by far. Since he started making clocks ten years ago, he's made several items for the rich and famous, at home and abroad. No, what makes him unable to focus is the name at the bottom of the sheet.
She pulls back and gives him a shaky smile. "Thanks, Harry. I know. Right now, you can go to France and check up on the house, and please go and see our neighbour, too - Mr Monet. He looks after the place for us when we're not there and he's a darling."
She manages to give the impression of wrinkling her nose without actually doing it. "I don't think I can very well do that, but if you would give me yours and I'll pass it on? You'll also find us on Facebook and Twitter. You can leave a comment for the artist there."
Afterwards they lie side by side on the tacky red bed, warm and sated. Draco looks up at the canopy of the bed, feeling the warmth of Harry's arm against his own and thinking of nothing except maybe that he's never been this happy. He wants to stay in this moment and not think of anything before or after this, not think of anything outside this bed.
But later, when he's in his four-poster bed watching chalky clouds drift past the moon outside his windows, his thoughts linger on Malfoy. He enjoys working with Malfoy, and every day brings some new, small surprise. Like when Malfoy tells him well done, or shows a streak of brilliance in weaving the net of spells. Or that sudden smile that makes his eyes shine.
After weeks of wandering around the house and finding all his old beliefs crumbling, Draco desperately needed something to do. Malfoy Manor was surrounded by a large park with a formal French Baroque garden, an English woodland garden and walled kitchen gardens. There must be things to do there. Draco found the Head Gardener and asked to be taught both physical, magicless work like digging, and spellwork to grow the most beautiful flowers and make fabulous hedge sculptures. Confused and slightly terrified, the Head Gardener took on his new and unexpected apprentice. Draco listened carefully and worked hard, making a point of saying thank you and expressing his appreciation of the Head Gardener's skills. He wanted to remove himself as far as possible from his old persona.
Despite being tired, Harry decides to have dinner in the Great Hall that evening. He washes his face and hands in his very own bathroom, changes his jumper for a dark shirt and tries to make his hair less messy, but it's a losing battle as always.
The gavel falls, Malfoy winces and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, his gaze slides sideways and touches Harry's. He doesn't say anything or even nod. And then he is whisked away.
Draco realised with a pang that he wished Potter was all those things, and that he, Draco, wanted to be at the receiving end of them.
The first one is from Ginny, and Harry starts with that one. The one he needs to brace himself for. The one he wants to get out of the way.
Later, when Draco has reciprocated and surprised himself by how much he actually enjoyed it, Harry threads daisies into Draco's hair, smiling. For just a few minutes, Draco lowers his guard and allows himself to feel how much in love he is, how much he wishes this could go on forever. He doesn't want to leave. He doesn't want Harry to leave. He hadn't known it was possible to feel like this.
It's quick and it's messy, and Draco shoves his knuckles into his mouth to stifle his cry as he comes. Harry follows, groaning against Draco's collarbone.
Draco turns his head and looks at Potter's profile, the soft mouth, the long eyelashes. "Tell me what?"
He needs the absolute focus that comes with working at night. The lamplight glints on his tools, on the loupe and on the myriad tiny parts that will eventually make a whole. On an ordinary night he loves it, but tonight something is wrong. His focus just isn't there.
Harry is still panting a little from attacking the web of wards, and Draco's own breathing is quickening to match it.
"You've been watching me," Harry says in a low voice. "And I don't mean just now. You've been doing it all along, ever since we started working on the Room of Requirement."
The working partner, who has just rounded the corner, stops dead at the sight of them. His blond hair gleams in the pale light from the windows. It's Draco Malfoy.
Art school comes as something of a shock to Harry's system, but he loves being back in the Muggle world. He's sure his fellow students regard him as a bit odd, but he needs time to adjust to the Muggle way of living, being, studying. Thankfully he's not the only odd student by far.
Harry takes a step closer, still with that intense look in his eyes. "It was a bit unnerving at first, but now... now I'm thinking…"
"A broom closet? Seriously?" Harry's face is inches away from Draco's. "The Room of Requirement seems to think we need a place to snog. Has it got the right idea?"
Harry is leaning on his elbow looking down at Draco, still with that soft little smile on his face and with the breeze ruffling his hair. If Draco could keep one moment of his life forever, one single moment that will never fade, he'd like it to be this one.
It's not ego that makes him add a Harry hand to Draco's clock. He only wants Draco to be a little less lonely.
Draco still isn't allowed a wand. He stands aside and watches Harry work, suggesting every intrusive spell he can think of, and after that every demolition spell, but not even Harry's powerful
Harry closes his eyes, and two seconds later the doors of the Room of Requirement appear, allowing them to enter…
With the war, Draco saw people around him change and turn into frightening, exaggerated - or disappointing - versions of themselves. He watched his mother grow silent and frightened and his father descend into despair. Crabbe and Goyle turned into the full-fledged thugs and killers he'd always known them capable of becoming. Until now, that had only seemed an advantage, something that could serve Draco well. Now he knew they'd turn against him in an instant, if they saw fit.
"I'd be interested in buying one or two of these paintings," he says. "I'd also be interested in commissioning further work from the artist."
Draco wanders slowly around the outer room. The paintings here are abstract, dramatic, with thick, slathered-on layers of paint. At first glance they seem to have been painted very quickly, but a closer look shows them to be meticulously made, with careful texturing and detail. The colours remind Draco of something - he searches his memory - France, perhaps? Yes, the south of France, where Draco and his mother have spent a few summers and autumns. Colours suggesting golden sunlight, lavender fields, sun glittering on the sea… It's expertly done.
Harry has another go at Draco's clock the next morning, and this time it works better. He doesn't even need the circle of light under his lamp to be able to focus. Perhaps his thoughts of Draco last night worked like an exorcism, and now that it's done with, he can get back to business.
Every morning Draco wakes up full of energy, ready to go to work. This is new - he's never felt like this before. He smiles at himself in the mirror and hums as he gets into the shower. His showers have never taken this long, either. He takes his time soaping himself, imagining it's Potter's hands sliding languidly over his skin, finally finding their way down between his legs... Most mornings, he needs a silencing spell to muffle his own moans as he comes, the back of his head falling back against the tiles, his mouth open.
"Well, good luck with… you know, anything you decide to do after that." Harry pushes his plate aside and stands up, holding out his hand. "It was great working with you." When Malfoy takes his hand and their eyes meet, Harry finds it in him to smile a little. "And… doing all those other things we did. Whoever gets to be with you in the end is a lucky person."
The simple honesty of it makes Draco draw a breath. Back then, he'd been angry and hurt. He'd felt used and discarded, and for a long time afterwards, it had been like grieving. He'd even promised himself not to fall in love ever again.
Having two people close to your heart is far better than having none, Harry tells himself, but the implied loneliness of Draco's life still tugs at his heartstrings. An idea begins to form at the back of his mind. It's not without risk and perhaps it's a little presumptuous... He needs to sleep on it.
When he looks up from his plate, Draco Malfoy is standing at the far end of the table, looking uncharacteristically hesitant. As he spots Harry and comes over, heads are leaning together all over the Hall and whispers and murmurs ripple through the air.
"We've done good work," Harry says, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. There's a strange look on his face, and his eyes don't let go of Draco's.
When Harry stands in the relentlessly whipping wind looking out over the stunning views of lakes and mountains, his time in France feels like a distant dream or something he only imagined, something that never really happened. Hogwarts is filled with memories and he only seems to recall the bad ones. They come washing in over him now in a huge, dark wave.
Harry sighed and leaned back on his chair. "Tell me about it. But for me, it's more than that. I grew up partly in the Muggle world but I only knew it as a child. I want to get to know it for real, as an adult. Make it my own." He took a breath and smiled a little at Draco who was listening intently, his eyes on Harry's. "I have no idea why I'm telling you this."
Harry takes the easel back to London and immediately puts his own aside. From now on, this is the one he'll use, and the first thing he wants to use it for is something he's been thinking about for a while, something he's been wanting to do ever since those months at Hogwarts restoring the Room of Requirement. Those months with Draco Malfoy. Back then, Harry hadn't been skilled enough to properly execute his ideas. Now, everything is different.
"Alright then," Potter says. "Let's get started and see if we can find a way to work together. I don't think we've tried that since we were in detention in the Forest when we were eleven - and even then we didn't try very hard."
"Sure, sit," Harry says. Seeing the haunted look in Malfoy's eyes, he adds: "And just ignore all those whisperers and mutterers. They'll get used to you."
Barefoot and in bathrobes they pad down to the kitchen, leaving wet footprints on the stairs. They stand side by side looking up at the Potter family clock, where their own faces look back at them from the Harry and Draco clock hands.
Draco arches his back into the hard, warm curve of Harry's body as Harry moves in him, slowly, sweetly, with his lips touching the back of Draco's neck. Draco squeezes his eyes shut, mumbling something incoherent, and when Harry reaches around for Draco's cock it only takes seconds for him to come, crying out as he does. Harry pushes inside him hard, once, twice, and follows, groaning against Draco's shoulder.
Draco sees no reason to protest. Just as he opens his mouth to reply, a deafening crack of thunder echoes between the walls and rain starts coming down in buckets. Laughing, Harry pulls Draco around the corner into a miserable alley with dustbins at the far end. "I'll side-along you! Hold on tight."
There's no clock hand for Astoria. Harry remembers Hermione telling him about the Malfoy divorce a couple of years ago – how the hell she knew about it he has no idea.
They occasionally have coffee together, then begin to lunch together when their schedules allow, and one afternoon Hermione surprises Draco by asking him to come to the pub with her and Ron.
for us, Harry," says McGonagall in clipped tones. "The least we can do is give you a place to stay, should you need it. Or want it."
"There isn't much to do or anything," Hermione adds hastily, "but it does have a garden and a pool, and you'll have it all to yourself. Stay as long as you like. I mean, if you want. It's on the Floo network, so I'll just give you the password."
"I know you don't go to Muggle London often, Draco," Pansy says. She has that light in her eyes that only appears when she has an extra juicy piece of gossip to deliver.
She walks away briskly, and Draco wants to laugh. An exercise in self-control! Yes, indeed, if not really in the way she means. All those fantasies he's had about Potter over the last three months...
Up until now, Draco has looked at the paintings with burning hot face, shell-shocked at being exposed like this to strangers, at something so personal and intimate being put on display for anyone to see. But this painting…
What shook Draco the most was finding himself drawn to Potter's world, where jokes and successes weren't necessarily at the expense of others. He wanted to be part of that world, to experience it for himself.
Harry looks out over the devastation, remembering the roar of Fiendfyre and Malfoy's pale, soot-stained face, his arms hard around Harry's waist as they escaped the inferno on their broom... He swallows. "Must be complex work. Will I get help? I'm not sure I know all the right spells for this kind of thing."
" She smiles as she puts them back on his nose. "I wonder how many times I've performed that spell for you."
Even though he knew who the artist must be, he is unprepared for the impact of seeing Harry again. His palms are sweating, his mouth goes dry and his cheeks are burning.
"So no one will see if you skive off work with me for an hour or two if we stay within the Hogwarts grounds?"
For a moment, Draco's old envy surges. Of course Harry Potter, the Chosen One, has been given his own permanent room at Hogwarts while Draco has been sleeping in the damp, half destroyed dungeons… He quickly suppresses it. After all, it wasn't Draco who defeated the Dark Lord. It wasn't Draco who walked into the Forest to die.
Mr Monet remains a constant in Harry's life, until late one evening when an owl hoots impatiently outside Harry's bedroom window at Grimmauld Place. The note is from Hermione, telling him Mr Monet is dead.
"Thank you, Harry," she says, hitching Teddy up on her hip. "Thank you for doing what you did in there, both for Draco and for Cissa. I know Cissa has done unforgivable things, but at the end of the day, she's still my sister."
Draco smiled. "Art museums – or art and music in general – aren't exclusively Muggle. Look at Monet, for instance. Or Turner. Look at the way they paint. They're wizards. Just like Beethoven and Mozart were wizards."
He has no idea what Harry feels. This might only have been a temporary thing, a nice way of passing the time while they got their work done, and now it's all over.
His breath is like a cloud and his black, silver-clasped cloak is adorned with miniature stars on the shoulders. It's snowing.
All this goes through Draco's mind as he watches Potter begin to clean up the blackened remnants of the Room of Requirement. Flick of the wrist, complete focus, as if Draco isn't even there. Which means Draco can look to his heart's content.
"You'll certainly have help. The actual physical construction work, bricks and mortar and so on, will be done by specialists, but you're needed for the planning and the spellwork. You can consult with anyone you like. I'm at your disposal, of course, as is Professor Flitwick. And ... oh, here's your working partner now."
The first few nights he's far too tired to paint or draw or really do anything at all, but still not tired enough to sleep. But once the work has begun for real and he's settled into a kind of routine, he unpacks his artist's materials from his trunk.
Draco grins. "She could have, but she didn't. But it kind of made me want a Real Potter Clock for myself."
"What are you doing in the Muggle world?" Harry asked, stirring his coffee. It didn't need stirring; he needed something to do with his hands.
This is only the first of a number of pub visits, and later dinners at the Granger-Weasley house. Draco and Ron Weasley might never be close friends, perhaps, but Draco considers Hermione one, and Ron at least tolerates him.
Draco does wonder if it's only the glow of first love that makes Harry shine so brightly in his mind, and whether that glow would fade if they met again. Perhaps it's only a hankering back to better days, to that period of heightened emotion after the war, when there was plenty of hope and nothing but potential. But he can't accept that. It hadn't been a spur of the moment thing, those months at Hogwarts with Harry. Ever since their first year at school, Harry had been central to Draco's life. An obsession, even. And the truth is he's still central to Draco's life after all this time, and Draco has little hope of his obsession ever going away.
Draco reaches up to push Harry's hair from his forehead, smiling a little as he remembers dreaming about doing that during his house arrest. A humble dream, but one that's ultimately come true.
Draco laughs, trailing his fingertip down Harry's spine. "I should have guessed you were a romantic, Potter."
Apparently he's passed the test, because Hermione looks pleased. "This Friday, then? At six? Have a drink before we eat?"
The repairs have been going on for some months already and parts of the castle have been restored to their former shape, all traces of war and tragedy removed. McGonagall takes Harry to a corridor he remembers well, but where there used to be a sandstone wall, there's a vast field of blackened ruins. He draws a breath.
Later, Harry will think there should be a sign of some kind, the "ding" of a bell or a prickling of the skin, when you meet someone who will change your life. But when he opens the gate and enters Mr Monet's garden, he has no inkling at all.
In no time at all, Harry is hooked. It turns into an obsession. He paints through the day and dreams of it at night, of colour shifting and blending as he sweeps the knife across the paint, of layers and textures and depth. A glittering sea, the froth of waves dying on the sand, thunder clouds building in the sky. Quivering reflections. Sunshine filtered throuh leaves.
"I have a Trace on me," Draco says, surprised. "I can't leave the Hogwarts grounds, and I have to be back in my room by nightfall, but apart from that..."
?"), and he takes her to France to meet Mr Monet. Mr Monet assumes they're a couple and they don't correct him, but their relationship isn't of that kind.
He doesn't mean to sound ungrateful, and McGonagall doesn't take it as ingratitude. She places a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder.
"And a Muggle to boot!" Pansy drains the last drops from her glass of champagne. "Well, I have to go. Good luck with your elf work," she waves a hand towards the cassoulet, "and you
. I want to help people with memory loss, from Obliviate or from magical maladies. I'm going to apply for medical training back home as soon as I can, but for now, Ron and I are staying in Australia. My parents can't be moved yet, and Ron is doing a course in Care of Magical Australian Creatures. He's absolutely loving it! Being the miserable letter writer that he is, he only asked me to say hello. So, hello from Ron. And hugs and kisses from both of us (okay, not so much with the kisses from either of us, Ron says)."
When the clock is finished, Harry scrutinises it one last time to see that there are no cracks or chipping or skewed parts. After a final polishing charm, everything looks perfect. It's without a doubt the most beautiful clock he's ever made.
With the tension temporarily out of his system, he goes to the Great Hall for breakfast. More often than not he ends up sitting with Potter, unable to stop looking at him. Sometimes it's all he can do not to lean across the table and...
Harry Vanishes some stray pumpkin cookie crumbs from his shirt. "Yes, I have. I've been thinking about it a lot, and I finally know what I want to do."
In the hallway outside the courtroom, Harry turns around at a high-pitched squeak and finds Andromeda Tonks with little Teddy Lupin. She looks pale but relieved.
It doesn't disappoint. Harry's palms are warm against Draco's face, his tongue is eager, his fingers catch Draco's earlobes and stroke them until Draco's knees are buckling and he's clutching at Harry's waist to stay upright.
Worst of all, he watched the Dark Lord change from supremely powerful to a panicked, illogical creature striking out at anything and anyone he deemed a threat.
Armed with a battery of charcoal sticks, Harry sends himself soaring towards the vaulted ceiling and keeps himself afloat in the air with a levitation spell, so he can start decorating the whitewashed surface. Didn't Mr Monet say Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel lying on his back on scaffolding?
Harry drops off his luggage in one of the bedrooms, kicks off his shoes and walks barefoot to the garden. The paving around the pool is hot underneath the soles of his feet and he sits down at the edge of the lawn, blinking at the bright sunshine and the vivid colours. So this will be his home for the next few weeks. It feels like a dream after the past rainy weeks in London with an endless string of interviews, trials and witness statements. Now, London is a world away. Or that's how it feels.
"Who would take me? Hogwarts is the closest school and they don't allow 'late bloomers.' And, not sure if you know this, but us wolves tend to be territorial. Moving to another country is out of the question."
To say that he sighed in pleasure because of the warmth of the car heater is an understatement. He could say he moans, which goes only a bit too far.
Potter didn't come back to Mr. Barnes potion shop. Every time someone would walk in, Draco's heart would leap at another opportunity. He would smile a bit more at his customers, write down their names carefully in his record book, and ask them casual questions about their day and the potion. He took the time to explain the potion and its brewing process. Some of his patrons accepted them in welcoming strides while others eyed him suspiciously. It was atypical behavior, sure, but Draco was finally putting his love of potions to good use.
"It was just what I needed," Draco promised. He suddenly looked guilty. "I didn't go too far either? With the comments about..."
“How was your break, Harry?” Hermione sounded cheerful, sitting so close to Ron the outside of their thighs were pressed together. It’s not like it was particularly small in the train cart.
"Harry, my queerness has been a point of tension in my family since I was ten years old. Though I must be far from the first gay Malfoy, it doesn't mean I can shirk my duties to produce an heir. That's all there is to say about it. Now, what other questions do you have?"
“I believe it was his family that donated the most to the reconstruction of Hogwarts,” Hermione said, glaring at her boyfriend. “He can’t be all that bad anymore. Remember, Bill lives in the same town as him, and he says he can’t even recognize him.”
He unclasps his boots and pulls one off. He groans and wiggles his toes. Draco feels like he's watching porn.
Hesitantly, Harry reaches out until their fingertips touch. He wants to cry at how cold Draco's fingers feel. How long has it been since someone has held his hand like this? He's been alone all year, even Crabbe and Goyle aren't spending a whole lot of time with him.
This was fun to write! For someone who enjoys omegaverse so much in other fandoms, I was surprised to realize I didn't read a lot of drarry A/B/O fics, nor did I write any. But I am also a sucker for unconventional dynamics (especially alpha x alpha, so please give me recs in the comments if you have any!)
Teddy smiled serenely at the display. "That's too bad, pet. I don't really want to get my dick wet tonight. I think I want you to prove to me just how much you can handle. Can you be a good boy for me and do that tonight?"
While one vine stroked his shaft slowly, another smaller one rubbed over the head quickly. It was torture. Before this, the only sexual relief he'd ever had was rutting on his pillow in the privacy of his bedroom. He refused to do it at school, where all of his roommates were. That was just humiliating.
Or, at the very least, come to tell him in person. The man couldn't even do that; he sent his overworked falcon to deliver an impersonal letter demanding Draco brew more. Like a spoiled child. His falcon stayed for an hour after delivering the order so he fixed him up some raw fish and water. Draco could've sworn he would be beaming if he had a mouth instead of a beak.
Draco frowned. These rooms wouldn’t be co-ed, would they? That would bring up a whole new set of problems…
"About that too: I'm thinking that if you help me out on this research paper, my work and your interview will keep 'my kind' out of your family's hair for another three centuries, at least."
"Oh? Getting ahead of ourselves, are we Granger?" Pansy teases. The tip of her tongue pokes through her teeth.
Draco smooths his hands down Harry's back and fondles his round arse. Circe, is he not wearing anything under these? What the hell? A spike of arousal heats him up even more. The idea of his lover going full commando as he rushes to meet him during his heat does unspeakable things to his already skyrocketing libido.
She uncovers herself from the cloak, deciding to hide it right at her feet to (hopefully) make it easier to find. Pansy smiles and helps her pat down her curls that rebelled under the fabric. After which, she kisses Hermione's forehead.
And damn it if Draco wasn't in this position he would have reached out and swat the back of Harry's head.
Draco laughed at her disgusted expression. "No," he responded. "I had a falling out with a lover. He was pretending to be someone else with Polyjuice Potion."
This one was fun to write! I really love hurting poor Draco, don't I? Except this time it's consensual! Yay! The next few fics are all gonna be cross-generation ships I believe hahahaha
But he feels like his insides are throbbing. Painfully so. He thinks if he doesn't get something inside him soon he might actually combust. All fire and explosion.
"Yes?" Harry answered quietly, brows furrowed as if he were trying to come up with an answer. It took a few minutes for him to realize he spoke aloud.
Or at least that's what Bathilda said. Gellert did tell Albus, but he has a tendency to lie about the most mundane things, so Albus wasn't inclined to believe him at first.
Draco Malfoy was in a room with him. Draco rolled his eyes and went back to putting away his clothes.
This one is far brighter than yesterday! Also I realized I made it a bit vague what Draco's gender is. It wasn't until I finished that I realized you could read Draco as being trans or not because Harry views them as an androgynous beauty, so I use they/them pronouns to describe Draco.
Then again, this team would consist of possibly four other houses. There were almost double the number of students that were routinely needed to make up a team. Draco felt rather awkward standing there; he had always been a Seeker, since the first year he started Quidditch. He hoped Madame Hooch wouldn’t find any reason to change his position.
McGonagall was waiting patiently for his response. Harry thought back, to the wind blowing through his uniform and hair, to the exhilaration of stealing the Snitch right before hitting the field, to the way that the cheers in the stands were muffled when he was flying so high. There was nothing that could compare to that feeling.
He smiled, bright and sunny and Draco felt at least 70% more Good just being in its presence. Having that kind of smile directed at him.
Draco cleared his throat. He wanted to ignore the sting behind his eyes. "If this is about my past as a Death Eater, I want to assure you that I've done my time and I obtained this job through legal means. Mr. Barnes has also been cleared of all affiliations—"
Unfortunately, he wasn't alone in that office. Three years ago, his lovely mother died. It wasn't anything sudden but it was still traumatic; some Muggle disease that the Healers hadn't seen coming. None of them saw it coming. Draco hurried her to a non-wizard hospital despite her protests but it was too late. (He tried not to suspect that his mother had already accepted her death by then. It would make things worse.)
Shining yellow in the glow of the fire, deep brown like roasted chestnuts, are extraordinary dragonhide boots. The bottoms are wet from the melted snow, but they're gorgeous. Draco's only seen dragonhide when it came to suitcases and boxes to keep important items in; he's never seen it like
, Draco thought as he checked the stock for next week. His employer suggested doubling the batch. As if it were that easy. If Mr. Barnes had wanted twice as much potion as usual, he should've told him last month.
“It was supposed to be a relaxing year, but then I saw you with broad shoulders and your jawline, and you just seem…”
Then Harry's curtains close, covering them in darkness. Wandless, nonverbal magic? Does Harry even realize what he's just done? No, he probably doesn't if the goofy look on his face is any indication. Harry's filled with more magic than anyone Ron knows. He could probably give Dumbledore a good run for his money.
Sometimes it was easy to forget that she had the same issues he did. She just seemed so confident in who she was and her identity. And she is, but she's also human and gets insecure just like everybody else. Just like Harry.
Ron inhales deeply, then exhales. Things went better when he just did things instead of dwelling on them. He gently pushes Harry to the left and lies down next to him.
she had added with a sneer, which put a damper on the whole event. But still, it was a nice and expensive gift so he wouldn't just
They lapsed into an exceedingly uncomfortable silence. Draco was imagining the other Aurors making a mess of his bedroom and of his, oh Merlin, parent's bedroom. Were they thinking his mother would ever let other Death Eaters near him while he was home from school? They were dead wrong.
He flipped onto his back when he heard the door open again. Malfoy— or should he call him Draco now? Their relationship has changed, hasn’t it? Draco looked more relaxed now that he was out of those nasty clothes. But his face betrayed some of that contentment.
Harry closes his eyes. Rests his head on Draco's shoulder and moves his hand until it covers Draco's entirely. "Maybe so," he agrees. "But it's worth a try."
He kissed the spot where it began to curve to the right. Then he rested his forehead against Harry's and let his gaze slide throughout whatever parts of the room he could see. A flash of bright orange caught his eye.
Harry's hand doesn't waver when he picks up the dagger. Which shouldn't surprise Draco because this is the same man who dedicated every inch of his time to this ritual. But it does because he's going to die by that dagger and he doesn't even flinch. It doesn't faze him in the slightest.
A strangled whine came from James' throat. He flushed even harder now, hands trembling in a tell-tale sign Teddy knew all too well.
Narcissa isn't a prude by any means, but even she has her limits. And hearing her son's moans while Harry shoves his hands down his pants is one of those limits.
I want to experiment a bit more with my style and I love writing dialogue, so that's all this chapter is. Like 95% dialogue and 5% phrases that give a bit more context to the dialogue. Werewolf Draco Malfoy is my absolute favorite trope (creature!Draco is my favorite no matter what creature, actually)
“You bet I will, boys!” Madame Hooch clapped Draco’s shoulder and he jolted forward from the impact. She was smiling too widely like she was desperate for them to get along. Draco remembered the conversation she had with McGonagall. He remembered the patient way McGonagall pitched her idea, the smile she gave to the gloomy sky after Madame Hooch agreed. He sighed. He would cooperate for McGonagall and Madame Hooch and only for them.
They were three dates in. That was longer than any of Draco's other partners. The first date, if you could call it that, was a visit to a Muggle bar, where they drank, danced, and made out in the men's restroom. Hank was a
He raised an eyebrow at him, and Harry recognized the fatigue encompassing his entire face. “Made it, Potter. How else?”
Ron pays close attention to how Harry's mouth wraps around the unfamiliar language. The hisses and clicks he makes thrum in Ron's brain. His stomach is squirming again, but not from nerves. What is wrong with him? There has to be something deranged about him if he's here, becoming aroused from watching his best friend sleep talk during a nightmare.
Is he being petty? He didn't even address what Potter was really saying. Just took one meaningless detail and tried to make it a whole other thing. If he could, he would take it back and say what he was really thinking.
"Can I clean you off?" He whispered through their post-sex panting. He waited patiently for her reply.

Because, well, it's rather awkward telling them you're in love with a woman, isn't it? Especially when that woman used to be one of your childhood bullies.
The voice is all too familiar. Even if he hadn't heard it in years, the entire family had a particular way of speaking. He thinks he'd be able to recognize him even if he never met him in his life.
On the left were the Slytherins. It’s not as if there were any physical differences between them and the rest of the students, but there was an aura of melancholy. Even in the small first years. That’s not to say they were quiet, not by a long shot. They just didn’t draw much attention to themselves. Harry smiled to himself, remembering how he and Malfoy would scream at each other from across the room about the stupidest things.
“Are you two nearly finished?” She asked. “I need to have my Seekers sorted so we could do some practice games.”
But there's a lot on his mind. More so than usual, typically containing one wild-eyed blond who's taken to following him around Godric's Hollow. He introduced himself as Gellert Grindelwald, nephew of Bathilda Bagshot. (Who Ariana's taken to calling "Bat-shit insane Bagshot". Not her most creative insult.) The sixteen-year-old instantly took a liking to Albus. Bothering him when he was working on his essays, interrupting his nightly walks, even sending owls after him when he was travelling for more than a day.
This is my first femslash that actually contains orgasms lol. I hope it's okay! Extra brownie points to those who get the Starkid reference!
"I liked it when..." Ron trails off when Harry glances up at him. Fuck, he's so much harder to talk to when he doesn't have his glasses on. "I like it when you speak parseltongue."
and wipes away the thick layer of dust on the surface until he can see his reflection. He smiles at himself. A flash of blond hair and pale skin catches the corner of his eye. Albus whips around to confront the student (his mentee?) but finds that nobody is there. Some sort of specter?
Harry’s hand crept toward his, under the table, and grabbed it. His hand was warm. It always was and Harry couldn’t explain it. Not that it really needed explaining; Draco’s hands and feet were always cold so it was a nice change of pace. But holding hands in a public space, even if it was underneath a table, was a little embarrassing. He felt himself flushing, thankful that it wouldn’t show that much on his fair skin.
If he were just a slightly more immoral person, he might've done it to himself. Become wholly another person. Nobody would treat fucking him like a revenge fantasy against all Death Eaters. He wouldn't feel compelled to say yes to everything his partners ask, simply because he knows he wouldn't get any kind of intimacy in any other way. Wouldn't that be nice?
Draco can't help but feel betrayed. Does Harry truly think he wants a child more than he wants his husband? When they dedicated their vows to each other, did Harry believe it was a farce? That Draco was just using him as a means to an end? A lifetime of trauma, of being used as a pawn in a greater game, must have instilled this into him. He wants Harry to snap out of it, to realize the importance of his life.
Seamus placed three drops of Veritaserum in the large bottle of wine, placing his thumb over the top as he swirled it around to disperse the potion. That was a lot of truth serum, but they would all be drinking small amounts so it shouldn't be too bad. Right?
At least he was let down gently. The grass was wet and cool against his hot skin. His mouth tasted of ash and acid. He heard the flora creep back into the forest, looking for another victim.
At first, it didn't click. Did Potter read his vile lake challenge comments? Draco frowned in concentration, promising himself he wouldn't dare open that damned diary and try to desperately find what he was talking about.
Romania in the dead of January is cold. Very cold, in Draco's humble opinion. -6°C. That was way too cold. Why anyone would want to live here is beyond him.
And the game continued on. Ginny asked Dean next, who picked dare and had to prank call his mother. Blaise took the truth option when Dean asked him, confessing to not having sex until he was eighteen, despite popular beliefs that he was some sort of sex symbol in school.
One of the only of his inheritances he took to his apartment was that magical portrait. She was still painful to talk to sometimes, but Narcissa— it felt wrong to call this young woman his mother when she had barely known him when the portrait was made, though she didn't mind when he would slip up— was usually quiet, watching him work with a curious eye.
He's tying up another letter on a potion with a nice lapis ribbon when she hears the front door open.
Blaise huffed in laughter. "No, Harry. You can come whenever you like. I can't guarantee I'll stop though, after you've come."
So many of the teaching positions were open after the Battle of Hogwarts. How did McGonagall manage to fill every single one in only one year? As well as fix up the century-old castle? There was nearly no evidence left of the destruction the school went through, save for the few intentional broken parts of the school left to honor those who died on school grounds.
McGonagall’s face was still as stone, her expression never wavering as she repeated herself, “I’m asking you to be the captain for an eighth-year Quidditch team that Madame Hooch and I are starting.” Her hands clasped together right in the middle of her desk. “Now, Mr. Potter, I would never want to force you into doing something you don’t want to do. I completely understand if you would just like to relax and study this year.”
He wasn’t the only one on the pitch, wasn’t the only one whose boots were slowly diminishing. The other eighth years were waiting in seven different groups. Madame Hooch was fluttering between all of them, constantly switching the students around, her hands feeling their shoulders and the tops of their heads. Every year, when Draco was on the Slytherin team, she would do this. Madame Hooch was not the type of woman to explain herself, although an older boy named Lucian Bole told him she had a gift for knowing who was supposed to be where. Very rarely back then were students moved to different positions, but Madame Hooch was as busy as a bee for this team.
understand. You are a child. I am the adult here, if I say no then that's my final answer. If you can't accept that, then you will have to accept the consequences for not only your disobedience but, more importantly, your
"You don't need to repay anything. I'm doing this because I care about you." He smiled into Draco's hair. "And because you really are a brat sometimes."
It wasn't really a question. James wouldn't really answer, they knew this. There must've been a push of concern in their words, though, because James nodded seriously and said, "
"Well, Blaise wasn't wrong. To ask the question, I mean. If what you're saying is true, then I was absolutely obsessed with you in sixth year." And then, without his explicit permission, his mouth added, "I still am. Hopefully as much as you're still obsessed with me, of course."
"So handsome," Teddy purred, not moving from their spot. They wanted James to feel the same anticipation that they did.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. He braced himself for a tragic reveal: he was secretly an animagus, or a vampire, or that he was actually Nagini the snake all along. Harry wouldn’t put it past fate to make the first guy he wanted to be with be some sort of magical creature. What a dilemma.
, Draco thought. Then he realized that wasn't the point of the man's statement. Potter was convinced he'd hate him? What, were they in fucking sixth year? Though it would make sense that someone as immature as Potter would believe he was still sixteen.
"I always hated prophecies," Harry tells him, more of a breath than actual words. He ignores Draco's begging for him to conserve his energy until he finds help, saying, "They're complete bullshit. Constantly demanding I do this and be this person and change myself to fit into it."
The mirror is back to normal when he looks back again. Just him, flushed and sweaty, with his hand in his sticky underwear. It's probably the quickest he's gotten off in ages.
He could recognize that voice anywhere. Tertius Langley, a year older than him. A prodigy in Transfiguration if Zygmunt ever saw one. And absolutely incredible, body-wise.
This was the worst day of his fucking life. He would rather be splinched a thousand times over than have Harry Potter,
How was he supposed to move on from that? Knowing that Draco Malfoy, his childhood archenemy, was completely nude. That they were separated by a thin piece of fabric hanging from the wall. Harry felt his back sliding down against the cool tile wall until he was sat on the ground, next to the curtain. Unsure of what to do with himself.
"I should fuck you right here. Should open the door and let the neighbors see how much you love being abused by your cousin. That would make you a happy boy, wouldn't it?" Sirius mused. He let go of his arse and forced Draco to look back at him by gripping his chin. "Wouldn't it?'
Harry groans and wiggles around in the rope. "The bastard stole our wands, took my glasses, and tied us up together. If I move any more than this, we'll both fall over and probably concuss ourselves."
"That's beside the point," Potter said, rolling his eyes. He didn't look any less embarrassed. "Look, I wanted to tell you sooner but... I was really enjoying spending time with you and not arguing all the time. Not that I mind arguing, sometimes."
Less handsy is Hermione. She tends to be too nervous to place her hands anywhere under her girlfriend's clothes, opting instead to rub and massage over her clothing when she can. Sometimes Pansy will remove her top with a mischievous glint in her eyes, letting Hermione know it's okay to touch her boobs. Like, really.
“It’s getting pretty late…” Potter said, as if he was trying to make small talk. Which, Draco thought, would be a terrible idea in their current situation. What could be more unbearable than small talk when one of the speakers was naked?
After her death, he inherited so much. Most of it was probably still at the Manor, left to be taken care of by employed house-elves to conserve as much as possible. One of the things she left for him was a magical portrait painted when she was twenty-six years old.
Decidedly finished with their civil conversation, Malfoy finished his hot chocolate and crept into his bed. Harry watched him in silence. Watched as his breathing settled and indicated he was finally in deep sleep. He allowed himself to sigh and walked over to put the mug in the bathroom sink to be cleaned later.
"She confessed to me that raising a child felt like trying to brew potions with a blindfold. You have a bit of an idea of what to do, but everything feels like the wrong thing to do and say. She told me she had to
Harry would rub Malfoy's erection firmly through the clothing and press his mouth against every inch of pale, unblemished skin he could see. Malfoy would grip Harry's waist. He would be encouraging the way Harry selfishly thrust his hips against him.
“You really mean that?” Potter asked. The longer Draco stared at him, the more he found himself unable to speak. So he just nodded. The smile that was plastered on Potter’s face moments after made Draco’s heart jump repeatedly, as though it was doing a happy dance. It only intensified when Potter took his face in both hands and pulled him into a soft and slow kiss. Draco couldn’t help but let out a sigh.
Merlin, his knees were getting weak. This was it, wasn’t it? He’d finally have Potter to himself. Desire flared up inside him, mingling with an undeniable rush of nervousness. Potter was experienced, at least far more experienced than Draco. Maybe it would at least help to be in the familiarity of his own home?
"Don't be sorry, Harry. It's not your fault. It's not my fault either. All I can do is blame my father, and I will take great joy in doing so." He smiles wolfishly. "How do you feel about Daisyroot Draught?"
Harry slumps over even more. He isn't upset enough to get drunk— it wasn't hard to tell when someone was going to dump him. He's had a lot of experience on that front. This time, however, Ron promised they'd all go out and drink away his worries. What worries Ron was referring to, Harry doesn't know.
Blaise pulled him over to the group by his shoulders. "Lighten up, Draco! If that's the case, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
The different colored sparks die away. Teddy grinned down at the naked body of their lover. The incantations were a nice audible and visual message that James may be getting close to his limit. The last thing Teddy wanted to was push James beyond his abilities and hurt him.
“He’s not my sidekick, Malfoy.” Draco didn’t need to look at his face to know he had probably rolled his eyes. “And he would rather spend time with his girlfriend than watch us bicker.”
"Yeah! Ridiculous, isn't it? And totally heterosexual, mind you. The man had to win in order to get married, and if the woman won then she'd be able to choose to duel him again and hope he wins or she could leave him."
"I finished up all of my paperwork... so I have the weekend entirely free! No work this weekend to interrupt us," Harry says lowly. Oh, Narcissa doesn't like the sound of that. She doesn't need to know her son's private life, thank you very much.
Draco tried to conjure up any entries in detail, but couldn't. He remembered writing about his dreams, which was humiliating enough. Were the Aurors laughing mirthfully about his juvenile descriptions of wet dreams involving famous Quidditch players? Or were they disgusted? Oh Circe's tits and Merlin's balls, did he write about the Yule Ball in that diary?
By the time he’d finished putting his pajamas on, he was simply ready to go to bed. It was an exhausting day and the hot chocolate made him feel sleepier than usual. He just wanted to sleep off the weirdness of the atmosphere.
Hank didn't go further than that. Said he needed to get back home to his kid. Draco promptly freaked the fuck out, jabbing his pointer finger into his chest and berating him for assuming he was some "good for nothing homewrecker." Hank flushed bright red and ensured him that the kid was his Godson, not a biological son. He was single. Single and he wanted Draco. For some reason.
Her praises were just another layer on top of it all. Harry twisted his hands in his unruly hair. He needed something to hold during all of this. With her other hand, Blaise reached up to fondle his chest and squeeze his nipple.
There isn't a soul around as Hermione stands in front of the familiar broom closet. She's rocking back and forth on her heels as she waits beneath the glide of the cloak. Soon Pansy will be turning that corner and they'll be reunited after a night apart and a full day of classes. (She misses Pansy when she's not around, sue her.)
It was as if the weather was preparing for the upcoming holidays. Samhain was in just a few weeks. Draco was still surprised he’d survived coming back to Hogwarts again for over a month; he was certain he’d get cursed, expelled, or his mother would just sneak him back home one night while everyone else was asleep. He wouldn’t put it past her. She would probably be sending him a package filled with sweets and tokens of Samhain, as well as an enticing letter pleading for him to quit. Maybe not in so many terms, but Draco knows how to read between the lines.
"Oh, you liked it. And I'm just trying to lighten the mood. It really does put a damper on things in my life sometimes. Especially because my father has succumbed to some sort of obsession about the lineage."
He’s good at Quidditch. When he wasn’t playing against bloody Potter, his team would win practically every time. Draco isn’t a
It was Blaise Zabini's idea, at first, confessing that he was always fascinated with Muggle party games. Then it was Dean Thomas who brought up Truth or Dare. That got Blaise's attention, a mischievous glint in his eye that made Harry grateful he refused to be sorted in Slytherin.
The first rare pair! Between two wizards from the 1500s who only show up in a 2013 Playstation video game. I hope you enjoy reading, I had a lot of fun writing this prompt
This was too much. It felt like too much. He groaned loudly as he finally came, the smaller vine swiping it up while the other one stayed wrapped around his prick.
Harry smiled at her. How many other people noticed his lack of sleep? Had Malfoy noticed? Merlin, how embarrassing.
Her girlfriend separates their kisses to give them enough room to breathe, but close enough to feel the warmth of the other's breath on each other's faces. She glances down at Hermione's chest, grinning.
The House Elves looked a little put off at not being asked to make the hot chocolate themselves. Draco would never understand Granger’s stance on them.  They want, no
"The arsehole beat us unconscious and then fed us sleeping potion just for shits and giggles, huh?" Draco says bitterly.
The stares, Draco was expecting. The murmurs, he was expecting. There was nothing about the unwanted attention that he was surprised by. But he was surprised by the heaviness in his gut, the same feeling that plagued him all throughout first year. When he was desperate for his secret to be held safe, for absolutely nobody to find out that he wasn’t assigned male at birth.
. All his to decorate however he wanted and bring over whoever he wanted and do whatever he wanted in it. One of the first items he ever bought for himself was a tall fern living in the corner of his living room. Still there after three years, kept alive with a mix of magic and devoted care taking.
Hesitantly, he stood to his feet and opened the curtain. Potter was standing a few feet away. He looked handsome and Draco wanted to kiss him again. He’s
Unexpectedly, Potter smiled at him. Not fully, but it was definitely a smile. He outstretched his hand and kept it between them, unwavering. Potter never wavered; he was always annoyingly sure of every movement he made.
Sirius had a tight grip on the brat's blond locks. His face was twisted in a satisfying display of pain and hatred. Practically
As the light leaves, so does Harry's strength. Draco can catch his heavy body in his arms moments before he hits the ground. The stench of blood and rain and soil is all around him and Draco refuses to look at the gaping hole in his chest. He will not acknowledge it. He stares at Harry's face for his final minutes. He tries to commit every age line earned from laughter, every scar and freckle, to memory. There's nobody else but him. There's never been anyone else in the entire world who can compare to him.
Hours pass before Draco's heat is satiated. He knows this will last for at least three more days (likely five, knowing Draco and his rotten luck) but he finally feels restful. Being surrounded by Harry's scent is definitely helping him as well. Would they be expected to go to class tomorrow? Draco hit his heat early in the morning, before classes, so somebody must have told their teachers.
It was easy to shove the boy against the front door, squashing his face into the polished dark oak, and pull down the blond's expensive-looking trousers. He was wearing silk iridescent briefs.
Fuck, it felt nice to talk to someone who understood. He forgot how fantastic his mother was. Narcissa never dismissed his emotions, no matter how ridiculous and dramatic he could get. His eyes stung with tears but he didn't feel ashamed to let them fall.
Ah, a date. Draco was glad Hank asked so he wouldn't have to humiliate himself and take the initiative. He smiled at him. (Not his customer service smile.)
Despite Malfoy’s promise that they would talk about it in the morning, the boy was out of the room by the time he woke up. Seemed to be gone for a while too; even the smell of his posh soap was almost completely faded. Harry had cursed when he realized. The git was as sneaky as a snake when he wanted to be, and there was no doubt in his mind that he’d barely see Malfoy all day. The only time they’d be able to truly talk again was going to be during practice.
He was still staring deep into the blur of reds and oranges and yellows when he felt the tip of someone’s shoe tapping his shin. Hermione was looking at him with a fretful gleam in her dark brown eyes as he raised his head in the direction of the tapping. In a way, he missed seeing that gleam. It held less pity for the person he’s become, and more about the trouble he was thinking up in his mind.
Just as he suspects that the night will pass just as smoothly as they used to, Harry begins tossing and turning again. His forehead is damp with sweat. Ron moves to stand beside Harry's bed. He's trying to figure out the best way to get in bed with him while not disturbing his restless sleep.
"I need to talk to him. Let me see him." Then, because he was a manipulative arsehole, added, "It's the least you could do, considering your involvement in all of this."
Draco's back is warm against Harry's. He is still groggy, coming off the sleep potion. Harry fucking hates sleeping potions. It always makes him feel like there's sand in his head instead of his brain.
His friends cheer him on as he stands up. It almost feels like a walk of shame as he stands up and walks toward her.
“Fine,” he responded. After the war had ended, it took months for the world to get itself together again. For the first three weeks of break, he was living with the Weasley family in their home. He thought it wouldn’t be any different than when he stayed with them for the previous summers, but he was wrong. They were in mourning; Molly would walk around like a ghost, and then he’d hear her sobbing at night, George would leave the Burrow late at night and not come back until the next afternoon, looking exhausted and covered in dirt. Ginny couldn’t look at him. The first time she initiated anything with him, she had to stop, saying, “I can’t get the image of you being dead out of my mind.” She said she didn’t like being the girl left at home, waiting to see if he’d come back to her or if she’d be hearing about his death in the news.
"— so I'm mostly hoping to compare their accounts with yours. I think we'll start with the monthly cycles. For most werewolves, it only lasts for as long as the moon is out and the adverse effects of the transformation can be prevented with the use of Wolfsbane potion. How do your full moons go?"
"Oh, Blaise told me. When he woke up you were already gone, but he could smell that you were in heat."
“Yes,” he answered, still wary about saying the wrong thing to her. For Harry’s sake, he wanted his friends to like him, believe it or not. “My father wanted me to take Divination, but I never liked how touchy-feely it was. Besides, Bridget Wenlock got me interested in it. I read about her in my mother’s copy of
“Harry, are you positive you’ll be alright? You seemed kind of out of it on the train ride here,” Hermione asked imploringly. All summer she’s been trying her damndest to encourage communication. She just didn’t understand how awkward it was to talk about everything; the breaking up with Ginny, the days spent listlessly in his bed staring at the ceiling at Grimmauld Place, the nightmares he got even at the Weasley’s that left him breathless and panicked for hours.
After about thirty minutes of this, their game ended and they finally began studying altogether. Weasley grinned at his girlfriend and slid his essay over to her, asking her pleasantly to look over it for any errors. She narrowed her eyes but took it with a sigh.
He holds Harry for as long as he can. The storm quiets after the death, seeming to lose interest in the theatrics. He stays there for so long that the blood on his hand dries and it cracks anytime he moves. Harry feels cold. Draco's wet clothes are itching his skin and he shivers.
Hermione would never have done this under any other circumstance. In fact, she prides herself on being as open and honest with her best friends as she possibly can. Bottling things up can only lead to ruin, she believes, and there's no use in it.
When Harry's had his fill, making Draco come four times in a row, he straddles his lap and kisses him with a fever. His hands are cradling Draco's face like he's something precious and it's all Draco can do not to squeeze his waist as hard as he can. His pheromones must be going wild, because Harry's inhaling him and moaning into his mouth.
. Can one let something like seven years of antagonism go that easily? He knows it’s what McGonagall is expecting of him; that’s why she roomed them together to begin with. There could be no other reason. A weak, childish part of him wished nothing would change. That Malfoy would wake up one day and hex the shit out of him and he’d hex him back, just like old times.
He's got a thin sheen of sweat all over his body. His hair was plastered against his forehead slickly. He had even begun crying out with every new sting. Every minute thrust of his hips was desperate, the saliva dripping from his open mouth was debauched. Everything about the scene in front of them made Teddy proud James trusted them with this.
He was waiting then, listening for the voices to get quieter. It almost sickened him with how hesitant he was to do, well, anything without worrying about what others thought of him. Sometimes he liked thinking back to his third year when he felt like he was on top of the world. Like nothing and nobody could touch him. When he and Potter got into scuffles every other day and he enjoyed it.
It's not what either of them wanted. Harry felt uncomfortable doing all the stereotypical alpha things, but Draco's sure it was even harder to replicate when he was bitching about every little thing. Though, to be fair to his past self, he was only being such a snob because he felt unsettled doing all the stereotypical omega things. He isn't sure when they figured it out, but they did. And thank Merlin for that, because now they could actually enjoy having sex with each other in ways they were both comfortable with. Instead of just copying the porn they see.
“Just worried for you Draco, that’s all,” Blaise muttered. A stupid-looking grin appeared on his face. “And you’re positive that one of your reasons for going back isn’t that a very special hero will be joining you?”
“What? Are you embarrassed or something?” He scoffed. “I would’ve loved to be fawned over by the general public like you are.”
Harry reaches around with his other hand to tug at Draco's cock. Who would've thought that five weeks of forced bonding time while they cleared out his family manor of Dark artifacts could become this? He feels the weight as Harry leans onto his back, licking up the sweat on the back of his neck.
Her voice rang in his ears like the Hogwarts Express horn. When he got close enough, she wrapped her arms around him and held him close even though he was probably getting her gown dirty and damp.
"Because Harry needs to be cheered up," Neville responds. He isn't drinking much either, just enough for his cheeks to become pleasantly red. "And we're all here to support him in this time of need."
When he found the records, he sniffed and stood upright again. Hank was admiring his shiny dress shoes and his face was still flushed deep red.
"Potter, what on earth is that?" He asked, raising his head and craning his neck to get a better look at it.
There was a plan for what to do. A plan was always put in place, one they both talked about in extensive detail the days, or sometimes hours, before everything. Too many interruptions could happen in their busy lives to risk anything but proper, thought-out time together.
Sirius sighed. "You're alright. I would've told you if it was too much. Besides, your poor arse already took the punishment for saying that. You're forgiven, Draco."
He went to the Ministry the next day. He made no appointment. Draco didn't think he'd need one. If Harry was actually an honest git, he would drop anything for this opportunity.
Potter laughed (he dared to laugh!), throwing his head back and exposing his long, thick neck. Draco felt weird for noticing; as if he were Turned during the War and became even more obsessed with Harry Potter.
The idea of being used like that is enough to push him over the edge again. True to her word, Blaise didn't remove the vibrator and instead leaned forward to kiss him deeply. Harry weaved his arms around her neck to keep her close while his hips twitched, trying to get away from the vibrator while also wanting to be filled with her cock.
. Sends him chocolates with little notes about “sharing with a loved one” or “giving to someone special.” Very subtle, mother.
"Well, they're a few miles away. But they're also the closest thing to civilization I have at this place. Would you believe me if I told you I was sold this isolated cabin in the woods at an amazingly low price?"
It's still odd to her that Harry is head-over-heels for Draco, but she supposes she can't really judge. Considering she's got Pansy's cool hands sneaking under her sweater and caressing the skin of her stomach and sides.
In the morning, neither of them talk about what happened. Ron wakes early, before everyone else, so he's able to make his escape back to his own bed without any taunting. Maybe their mates wouldn't tease them about sharing a bed, but Ron had a strong feeling that this was a secret.
"Why do you always disobey me? You could have been killed! The plants and animals beyond the garden are unregulated and have been here for generations, so it's not as if we can just mow them down. You look filthy, darling, did you sleep out here? Merlin and Circe, come over here at once! We need to give you a warm bath and some illness checks. Hopefully you aren't sick— winter break is almost over, you know."
"You speak so terribly about my family," Draco said hotly. "Wasn't it bad enough leaving behind anyone who could ever care about you? Or was it worth it to hump another wolf like a mindless animal?"
"This weather is miserable," he complains to the driver, pulling on his seat belt and clicking it into place.
She paused to sip some of her tea. “Besides, I do have a few captains in mind if you do choose to not be a captain.”
Headmistress McGonagall smiled, then looked up at the gray sky. The clouds were tinged a bright, explosive orange where the sun was peeking through them. The brightness would dissolve though, leaving everything cold and gray. A sad autumn indeed. She looked around and Draco held his breath as her eyes passed over his figure, hiding behind the audience stands. But if she did notice him, she didn’t mention it or react to him.
Shibari is truly so gorgeous I wish I could've done it justice. But I just wasn't confident in my abilities to describe it. Maybe in the future! Despite this, the first two lines of this fic have been tumbling around in my brain while I came up with the idea for this prompt and it was too funny not to pursue.
Potter was staring at his face but snapped back to alertness at his words. He frowned. “What do you mean by that? Wouldn’t it be odd if the captain didn’t play any position for the most part?”
Seamus shoved a thick book in his face, making him drop one he was holding. Then there was a downside: Seamus had the attention span of a flea.
Harry is tight and warm. Draco realizes with a sick fascination that they could use his slick as lube. And that is just so... hot. Draco feels like his cock is going to burst.
Harry rolls his eyes. "I don't think so. He's your best friend, isn't he? I would want Ron or Hermione to tell you if either of them noticed my rut starting."
Narcissa Malfoy is twenty-six years old and she won't be getting any older. She's been twenty-six for the past twenty years or so. It's been so long she's lost track of all the years. And time doesn't mean much to a painting, does it? All that changes are her surroundings and the people around her. Some of which she knows and others she never really met.
He should have listened when his mother told him not to go beyond the garden boundaries. That the flora and fauna were dangerous and he was too young and inexperienced to go looking. But he was a brat. And stupid and arrogant and haughty. He thought nothing could hurt him but this false bubble of safety was subsequently popped when his ankle was grabbed and he was pulled away from the manor. Into the deep darkness of the surrounding woods.
"Ohhhhh. I suppose you do have a point with that. Let me just get comfortable... well? Aren't you going to sit? I'm not a complete monster; you don't need to stand the entire time."
The two women whispered to each other for a few moments more, then left the pitch to turn back inside the castle. Draco stayed hidden for the next few hours.
“So,” Draco began, then cleared his throat. “Since you’re already the captain of the team, I think I should be the front Seeker.”
Draco closed his eyes and finally let himself relax, comforted by the very quiet playful arguing of Granger and Weasley as well as the wonderful pressure of his boyfriend’s head on his shoulder and his hand tightly gripping his.
"Do you still feel that way?" Harry asked, and he was still so close. Draco could feel his warm breath on his cheek.
“Hello, Harry.” Luna looked at Ron and Hermione each and acknowledged them before looking back at Harry. “Have you heard the news?” Her hands were fidgeting with the folds on her skirt.
His host grins again. "Isn't it? It's an eclectic collection of items my family sends me and stuff I buy from the market. Or something my neighbors give me when it gets really cold." He waved his knitted gloves.
. Hank groaned into him when Draco ran his hands down to his upper thighs, encouraging him to wrap his legs around him. Draco was stronger than he looked; he could take it.
Draco averted his gaze. Harry sounded so sincere that it blinded him. What witty response would suffice? None, he supposed.
Twisting in his sheets, his limbs jerking wildly every so often, is Harry. The boy of Ron's childhood legends come to life. And he's not like Ron's younger self could've ever prepared for.
Back in the mirror, Gellert is looking at him again with that damnable grin. His white button up shirt has the top few buttons undone, exposing even more of his pale flesh. Albus has some trouble swallowing.
They leaned forward, pulling his bound hands away from his twitchy cock. "Naughty, naughty," they murmured, kneeling on the bed with one knee in between his spread legs.
Neither of them could agree on the method of having a baby. Draco wanted to go more traditional, adoption and surrogacy. He insisted there would be bumps in the road but they'd be worth it. But Harry... Harry was convinced there was a way for them to create a child of their own. With just the two of them.
Draco’s hands were shaking so he shoved them in the pockets of his robes. There was no reason why he shouldn’t be able to, at the very least, try out for the new Quidditch team. He was a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. What would his ancestors say if they saw him now? (They’d probably be screaming at him for disloyalty and being a disgrace to the family name.)
Pansy looks a bit dazed. "Probably not. It's alright though. It's so hot being the one to make you come."
There was another lapse of silence after Potter asked his last question and Draco had blown up at him. Why would Draco have any idea of what to do in this situation? Did Potter think he made this into a regular occasion?
"Alright, alright, I'm getting there, Malfoy." Malfoy? The man's skin was beginning to bubble up. Bile rose in Draco's throat.
Wringing his hands, a tall and dark-haired stranger was standing at the register. He eyed the more dangerous potions behind the desk nervously. Draco coughed gently in his fist. The stranger gasped, head spinning to the source of the cough.
Draco slammed the top of his suitcase down and watched it clip itself shut. He shoved it and it fell off of the bed and onto the wooden floor with a loud
“She won’t?” he says, furrowing his brows. But she will. She just told them they couldn’t leave this room. And while Malfoy technically didn’t, she’ll still assume he did when she sees he’s not there. Unless… she doesn’t see.
The door bursts open before Harry manages to put his jumper back on, which is very unfortunate. He must look ridiculous with his jumper stuck halfway down his head, his glasses askew and the button of his trousers undone. Oh god. And Malfoy is kneeling in front of him, having intended to pick up his book, but now frozen in place. Just perfect.
Draco scrunched up his eyes, trying to block out the unpleasantness. He almost told Potter to stop when he started moving his fingers, but gasped instead when his whole body jerked and started to tingle.
He hears Malfoy snort as he turns off the water. Harry goes stiff, knowing Malfoy is behind him, completely naked. This couldn’t get any more awkward. Malfoy seems to agree. He’s silent, for once, while he gets dressed.
It feels heavenly. Harry closes his eyes and ever so slightly leans into the touch. Malfoy is good at this. If somebody had told him a few weeks ago, he would enjoy being massaged by Draco Malfoy — that Draco Malfoy would willingly massage him! — he would have laughed in that person’s face. It still seems a bit ridiculous. But… it also doesn’t. It’s just strange and unfamiliar to Harry to find himself relaxed around Malfoy. To not flinch away from his touch. To almost crave it.
“Magnolia,” Draco calls after her as she hurries out of the Great Hall. “That was strange,” he murmurs to himself.
“And you!” Pansy turned to Potter. “From what Lovegood told me, you didn’t even have to break up with that bloke you paraded in front of Draco, because he never really was your boyfriend.”
“What?” Draco had trouble following Potter’s words. All he could think about was his finger on his skin, his eyes on his lips.
Because Luna would probably say “I think it’s nice you two are trying to be friends. He must be so lonely with everyone avoiding him.”
“Potter! Get your filthy Quidditch robes away from my bed,” Malfoy growled, nudging the red and gold robes on the floor with his foot. Harry rolled his eyes.
“What are you—” Malfoy frowns at him before realisation seems to hit him. “NO,” he barks as he, in turn, tries to move away from Harry. “POTTER!”
“I didn’t break up with Astoria because of you,” Draco said, very aware that he sounded like a stubborn child.
“Is that what this is?” Harry asks, his blood suddenly running cold. “You’re trying to, I don’t know, make us closer, so it’ll break the bond?”
Just as he drew his wand and got ready to Apparate, somebody grabbed his shoulder and whirled him around.
He rushed up the stairs, hoping his mother wouldn’t catch him, and locked the door after he reached the safety of his room.
Teddy pushed his lower lip forward in a big pout but, to Draco’s and Narcissa’s satisfaction, he did slow down a little bit.
Harry snorts, trying to make it sound indignant. “For your information, I happen to like this café.”
Malfoy forcefully bumps his shoulder with his own, making Harry wince. But when he realises the Slytherin has curled his fingers around his hand and is squeezing it lightly, he can’t keep the corners of his mouth from twitching.
“... when I asked him this morning… I think he didn’t realise at first… maybe his voice is only strained at the moment…”
“Well, he was rather persuasive,” McGonagall said with the tiniest hint of a smile. “How did you put it? ‘We don’t need another lunatic who wants to take over the world because he thinks he’s better than everyone.’”
Harry wants to. He really, really wants to. But… there’s this whole ‘you nearly killed him’ thing going on in his head again. And while he said all those things to Malfoy in mockery, he’s only starting to realise how much truth lies in his words. Nobody has come to visit Malfoy. Not a single one of his friends.
“Potter,” Draco gasps indignantly. “Is that your—” He feels Potter shift behind him. “Merlin’s balls, what’s wrong with you?” he bellows, trying to turn around. The sleeping bag and Potter’s arm prevent him from moving even an inch. “That better not be your bloody penis, poking my arse.”
They didn’t even let him talk, Draco thought irritatedly. Four bloody years after the war, and people still lost their minds over him. Ugh.
“Maybe,” he whispered and tilted his head. Harry suddenly felt Malfoy’s tongue on his jawline and gasped. Malfoy licked his way all the way up to Harry’s ear and then began sucking his earlobe. Harry felt like he was about to faint. Malfoy turning his attention to Harry’s neck and sucking even harder didn’t exactly help that whole situation.
Harry takes a deep breath, deciding to show the other boy how much he wants this. He places Malfoy’s hand on his chest, right over his heart.
“Okay,” Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around the koala. Even though he knew he had to get used to the fact that Baxter wouldn’t be around for much longer, he tried to tune out all thoughts about having to give the koala back to the zoo. At least for now, he wouldn’t let go.
Harry’s eyes dart over to the spot where he knows Malfoy is still lying. Bleeding. Dying. He can’t see more than a blurry silhouette on the floor. Before he knows what he’s doing, he screams at the tops of his lungs. He screams for help. He screams in agony. He tries to stay conscious, but the strange thing is, the more he tries to focus, the darker everything around him becomes. So he gives in and closes his eyes.
“Listen, I’ll take care of him, but that only means making sure he’s fed and… not screaming, I guess.”
It takes Harry a moment to fully understand Malfoy’s words, or at least try to interpret them correctly. Is he saying he loves Harry as well?
“What the fuck did you just do to me, Potter?” Malfoy was positively livid. He lunged at Harry, grabbing him by his robes.
It took Draco a while to calm down after that. When he peeked up at Harry, his eyes were puffy and his face blotchy.
Potter looked torn. It took several moments until he finally spoke. “I really like you, Draco,” he whispered.
His mother looked at him incredulously and Draco knew she wanted to say something. But he also knew she hated to cause a scene. Surely enough, she nudged Teddy’s shoulder and ushered him into the dining room.
On the sixth day, Harry is fed up with watching him from afar. Squaring his shoulders, he walks across the street and strides into the café. His heart is doing somersaults in his chest as he walks up to Malfoy’s table. The git doesn’t even look up from his book.
“Shut up, Blaise, you- Hey! What is the clock doing on the windowsill? That’s not where it’s supposed to be!” He whirled around in his seat. “Which one of you two did it?” he said, zeroing in on his Slytherin friends.
“If you will excuse me, Mister Franklin,” Harry interrupted him, freeing his hand from the other man’s grip and placing it on Malfoy’s back. “I have important business to attend to.”
“Malfoy, wait,” he says, reaching into his bag. “Here, take this.” Part of him feels like he’s going to regret this; what if Malfoy doesn’t return it? But right now, it feels like the right thing to do.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. Or feel for that matter. He wouldn’t go as far as saying he felt sympathy for Potter, but this sounded pretty messed up. And very confusing. He couldn’t have just vanished into thin air; he was sitting right here after all. So where had he been? Had someone wiped his memory?
But Harry’s mind keeps going back to the significance of what has just happened. They’ve had their first real conversation. Of some sort. Harry confided in Malfoy. Something, he hasn’t even done with his best friends. And to top it all off, Malfoy held his hand while he did it. And, in spite of everything, Harry almost wishes Malfoy hadn’t let go.
“Ah, I just— I wanted to make sure you got home okay last night.” He looked sheepish. “I brought breakfast,” he said, almost sounding apologetic.
“Hey, I’m the one being stood up here. The least you could do is be nice about the fucking… whatever this is.” Potter pokes the scallops with obvious scepticism, as though he’s checking if they’re still alive. Draco has to admit, as obtuse as it is, it’s also a little adorable. Just a little though. Merlin, he must be losing his mind.
Ron hesitates and bites his lip before he throws his hands in the air in frustration. “I don’t know what to think anymore.”
He should have known it wouldn’t be that easy. When have things ever been easy for him? On the contrary, the next day, he has to endure the humiliation of Slughorn’s booming laughter when a bunch of purple flowers suddenly burst out of his cauldron and ruin his potion.
“Come on, Potter, I know you can do it. I believe in you,” Draco smirks, feeling more determined than ever. He’ll get Potter to fall for him. One night, that’s all Draco needs. Potter won’t be able to even look at another man afterwards.
“It’s not the same,” Teddy pouted. He almost looked like he was about to cry. Draco was tempted to tell him he was a big boy now, it was his sixth birthday after all, and big boys didn’t cry, but Draco had always hated it when his parents had told him that. It had taken him a long time to realise there was nothing wrong with crying. But it always broke his heart a little, seeing those silent tears roll down Teddy’s face.
“Happy birthday, Potter,” he murmured against his lips. He felt Potter chuckle and couldn’t help doing so himself. This was it. He had never been happier in his life. It was such a strange feeling; so unfamiliar, so beautiful and so powerful, it actually hurt.
“It won’ take that long,” Hagrid says reassuringly and pats him on the shoulder. “Here, take these gloves.”
Harry suddenly finds himself unable to concentrate on the movie. He’s hyper aware of Malfoy breathing next to him, shifting his legs so they’re almost touching Harry’s. At one point, Malfoy gets up to go to the bathroom and accidentally brushes his fingers against Harry’s. They tingle, even minutes after, leaving Harry confused and flustered.
If anyone had told him a few weeks ago, Draco Malfoy would be lying in his arms and it’s actually not the worst feeling in the world, Harry would have told them to bugger off. But a lot has happened in the last two weeks. And even though it hasn’t all been bad, there are some things Harry wishes he could take back.
“And I noticed something,” Harry continued, ignoring Malfoy’s comment. “You’re always alone.” Harry watched as a hint of annoyance flickered over the Slytherin’s face.
“Why does everybody think this is about Ginny?” Harry bursts out. “It isn’t. I’m not in love with her anymore!”
At meal-time, Harry’s eyes dart over to the Slytherin table, only to find Draco isn’t there. The one time Harry got a glimpse of him, he was shocked. Draco has gotten even skinnier than he assumed. And now, he’s skipping meals again, because he doesn’t want to see Harry.
Harry pays extra attention to Malfoy’s presence over the next few days, hoping Hermione might have been wrong after all. Unfortunately, as always, it turns out her theory was dead-on. But what the hell does it mean? Is this some kind of weird manifestation of Harry’s wish to move on and maybe even become friends with Malfoy? If it is, this is even more embarrassing than he thought. But… does this mean the blooming will stop once they do become friends? Ugh, this is maddening.
“Albus,” Draco hears somebody hiss. He opens his eyes, looks around disoriented, until he sees an old wizard in another portrait gesticulate agitatedly. “Albus, the boy!”
“I know you weren’t,” Draco said with a grin as he buttoned up his shirt. “I guess you’ll stay a virgin forever.”
“Ah, Malfoy, that was quick. Good.” McGonagall waved him over to her desk and gestured for him to sit down across from her. “I’m glad you decided to come, I—”
Imagine what an utter pain in the arse Draco would be while flat-hunting. He complains about everything, scrunches up his nose and yells at the estate agent. Harry gets so uncomfortable every time it happens. He’s beginning to think they’ll never find a new flat. But he should have known Draco would have high expectations. He grew up in a manor for Merlin’s sake. One evening, Harry overhears Draco on the phone with their estate agent and his eyes widen, when he hears Draco say,
“Maybe we should talk about this another time,” he murmurs and wriggles into a more comfortable position. It’s strange, Harry thinks; he has never considered it could feel more pleasant to lie in bed while another person is there with him. He usually likes his space. He has been so intent on unravelling this new side of Malfoy, he didn’t expect to discover something about himself along the way.
It’s not like the hate is suddenly gone. Harry still feels it whenever he looks at him. But it’s different now.
Draco stared at him. While Potter had talked, two coffee cups had floated in from the kitchen and placed themselves in front of him and Potter. Draco quickly put two tablespoons of sugar in his, thinking hard while he picked it up and started stirring.
The relief Harry feels doesn’t last long, though, as Lucius pressures Draco into confirming Hermione’s identity and all hell breaks loose.
Draco notices that Potter is trying to control his breathing, his abdominal muscles working furiously as he holds it and then releases it quietly.
It’s Saturday and not only did Harry spend three hours in the kitchen trying out a new lamb cutlet recipe, he also made muffins. He’s not sure if blueberry muffins really say ‘Hey, I love gay people, I’m not homophobic’, but it’s the best he could come up with.
