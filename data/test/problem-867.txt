‘Say that again,’ Draco breathed gazing down at the top of Harry’s head. Harry looked up as though in a daze, he felt as though he was in a dream, he couldn’t figure out how this had happened, a dream come true, he had somehow found himself in a confined space with the man of his dreams literally at his fingertips, ‘What?’ he asked, not quite sure what Draco has just said.
Victor Hugo ---------------------------------------------------------
‘Pans..’ Draco spoke softly in the quiet of the Hospital wing. ‘ He did an amazing thing for you today, something that none of us are ever going to be able to thank him enough for, but you need to let this go, even if he did feel the same he would never hurt Hermione this way, you have to see that.’
Draco dug around in his trouser pocket for a moment before pulling out what looked like a page torn from a very old library book, ‘Here listen to this,’ he said before proceeding to read out what it said about a creature called a Basilisk.
‘What are you chicken?’ Ron asked from behind Harry. Draco glared at the red head for several silent seconds before, begrudgingly lifting his hand to his head and rubbing it vigorously side to side until his hair tangled and stood on end. He glared at Neville who swallowed and scooted back slightly. Draco was seriously annoyed now, his hair was a mess, he was sitting cross-legged on a cold dusty floor surrounded by idiots and to top it off his boyfriend was looking entirely too comfortable sitting in the red-headed buffoons lap, he could see Weasley whispering in to Harry’s ear and squeezing the smaller boy and, quite frankly he was ready to rip off his head. He had had enough, he wanted Harry back by his side, he was going to kill Blaise for this, and he wanted to humiliate Weasley, this buffoon was never going to learn that messing with him was a bad idea, a very bad idea. He turned and smirked in Ron’s direction, ‘Weasley, truth or dare?’
Harry could feel the heat rising in his cheeks, he knew there was no way Draco was flirting with him, but still.
Draco turned his head to look at Harry, ‘Why?’
Ron shifted slightly so that he was now sitting side by side with Harry and placed a placating hand on his friend’s shoulder, ‘I know mate, but as I said I hate to admit it and it’s obvious he cares about you and there is no way he would let you follow them on your own, Merlin knows where you will end up Harry and you do have a nack of getting yourself in trouble.’
Draco whirled round and advanced on Ron with a menacing gleam in his eye, causing Ron to shuffle back slightly to create more room between him and the crazed Slythern,
‘And you really don’t care?’
Draco was amazed, there was no way he could not meet this person now after all this, he needed to know who knew him so well, he knew who he wanted it to be and smiled softly at the thought but shook it off, he knew there was no way it could be the person he longed for, the gods had no reason to be that kind, so, slowly he turned his thoughts to who it might be as he began his journey to the lake. His gift giver was obviously his year or perhaps a seventh year to be able to see him in class like that, his mind raced through the names of all the boys he could think of but he had no idea who would pay him this much attention, he needed to know, if he didn’t like it at least he could thank them, he would, of course, not be returning the gifts. He thought back to the request to see his drawing and thought of the sketch book that he carried in his bag, always on his person and wondered if he would ever share it with anyone, perhaps not this particular one, but he had others.
‘I was hoping you’d be staying,’ Harry whispered so quietly that Draco almost missed it.
‘What do we tell them?’ Harry whispered as he caught up with Draco. Draco thought for a moment, ‘It was a trick, I didn’t show, I was trying to get you in to trouble.’
‘HI,’ he said shyly
Harry placed a hand on the small of Draco’s back.
All four of the boys turned to look in the direction of the noise and, as one, their mouths dropped open. Sitting against the wall, hunched down, knees pulled up to his chest, was Professor Lockheart, he was moving a  rock around him with his arm extended, like a toy aeroplane, the noises were his sound effects. Neville scrambled to his feet and dashed to the Professors side, 'Professor?'
‘It’s my fault we’re here, it’s my fault you’re here.’
Draco slumped bodily against the door, he felt worn and destroyed. He desperately needed to speak to his godfather. He was about to turn and walk away when the door he was leaning on was pulled open, the shift made him stumble; falling at the feet of the man he sought. He looked up and met dark eyes that were burning with curiosity. He scrambled to his feet, ‘Sev, I … Can I come in?’
Draco sighed and took a long pull on his drink, savouring the burn as it made his way down his throat, if he got drunk enough maybe the night would pass in a blur and he would forget he was ever here. Blaise had dragged him here kicking and screaming, not literally he had far too much class for that, swearing that Draco needed to have fun, that he’d regret it for the rest of his life if he didn’t go out with a bang. Draco snorted at the memory, what the hell did Blaise know anyway? He was still wearing his school uniform not even seeing any point in changing as he had no intention of staying where he wasn’t wanted, but, as the evening had worn on he had regretted the choice, now his top few buttons were open and his green and silver tie hung loosely round his neck.  His hair and long since fallen in to his face, the silver blond strands casting shadows as the lights pulsed around him, it was already damp from the sweat  and humidity that  comes from being stood in a sea of writhing bodies.
The six students were sitting cross legged on the floor of the classroom in a small circle, Ron was sitting across from Harry with Hermione on one side and Neville on the other, Harry was opposite Blaise sitting between him and Neville and Draco between him and Hermione, the atmosphere could hardly be called jolly;
Draco was cut off as a set of warm lips covered his own. The familiar sensations flooded his system and he felt amazing and he did not want the feeling to end, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and stepping further in to the ‘v’ of his legs, slowly and not quite sure whether he was doing it right or not Draco tilted his head and parted his lips slightly hoping he wasn’t pushing Harry to far. Draco was relieved when, after a split second Harry mirrored his gesture and suddenly, he could feel the heat of Harry’s breath tingling on his lips and flooding his mouth, where previously there had only been his own two breaths mingled and shared the space, their mouths moved together,  as pent up worry, frustration and anger manifested itself in to a tentative but heated kiss each boy desperate to make their feelings known. Draco pushed further in to Harry feeling the need to be as close as possible as he felt the other boys hands rest on his shoulders, the finger tips digging in ever so slightly as Harry attempted to pull him closer still.
After Potions Draco was unceremoniously dragged in to an empty classroom by Blaise. The dark haired Slytherin had feigned interest in Draco’s wallowing therefore  lulling him in to a false sense of security, if he had had his wits about him Draco would have been slightly suspicious of his friend’s sudden concern, but as it was he was too busy feeling betrayed by Harry the he walked right in to the trap.
He scoffed, ‘Hermione please refrain from mauling me.’
From his side Harry made a decision, they were wasting time, he looked across at Pansy she seemed to read his mind and nodded in determination, ‘Let’s go get her.’ She said holding out her hand, Harry took it and turned back towards the chamber, shouting over his shoulder, ‘We’re going for Ginny, if we’re not back in an hour...’ He didn’t know how to finish that. They took off towards the Chamber with Draco’s protesting screams echoing all around them.
......
Draco stepped closer still, backing Ron in to a corner, ‘Harry was hurt, upset, betrayed, humiliated, frightened and blamed himself Weasley, and all I know is that if you have felt any of that today then I have done my job properly.’
It was the last day of exams, the final exams the 7
‘Okay, how about this, we make a deal , a pact, a share for a share, I will tell you a secret and trust you with it so you can tell me what’s bothering you, how does that sound?’
Draco swore at that moment that he forgot how to breathe; the warmth of the room was clearly getting to him. There was no way on earth he had heard what he thought he had heard., he was definitely hallucinating. There was no other way to explain it. He took and deep breath, swallowed hard and turned to face Harry.
.......
Harry raised his head and leant his cheek against Draco’s chest as he wrapped his arms around the boy’s waist.
to top it off I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 and now I don't have Word.
......
......
Harry sighed and stepped closer to Draco who stiffened at the movement causing Harry to stop in his tracks ; ‘Why do you think I am cheating?’
Ginny leaned over, pressing herself closer to Harry so that she could be heard over the thumping music, she had been watching Harry pick at a loose thread on his sleeve for about two minutes now, she had an idea what could be going on in his head. It had been a long and painful year for them all, but it had hit Harry more than most, with one thing and another they had been drawn together and now were rarely apart. She knew Harry felt as though his life lacked purpose, but tonight, well tonight she knew there was something else troubling him.
It took a moment before Harry and Draco stepped away from each other, so caught up as they were. Harry’s  hormones were going wild, the mere smell of Draco had sent heat rushing straight to his groin, luckily for him, he was pretty sure that no one had noticed but he was pretty sure that somehow Draco had just known.
......
......
Back in the Trophy Room Harry swallowed hard, he had thought as much but the confirmation was hard to stomach. Salazar Slytherin had lived about a thousand years ago; for all he knew, he really was his heir.
Hermione and Draco stood staring at each other, each trying to break the other whilst simultaneously wiling the other to back down, ‘Draco?’ Hermione said quietly, ‘talk to us, tell us what’s happened, why are you ignoring Harry, he’s heartbroken.’
All three of them noticed at the same time that Dumbledore had come to see the game and visibly relaxed, there was no way anyone would hurt Harry with the headmaster there.
Ron stared open mouthed at the fiery tempered witch, ‘but..’ he began.
‘Merry Christmas Harry.’
Pansy had overslept, she was inwardly furious with herself but no one would guess it as she stalked through the Corridors on the way to Transfiguration, cool mask in place, she really did not like being late, as a returning Slytherin she needed to be on her best behaviour, like Draco, her every move was being watched for the slightest of mistakes.
‘This is going to be so much fun.’
Draco stared at Harry, mouth slightly open, tears begin to fill his eyes.
The room’s other occupants were all there much to his annoyance. Crabbe and Goyle were sat on the latter’s bed and didn’t even look up at his entrance as they were seemingly embroiled in an extremely intense trade-off of their Honeyduke’s wares. Draco shook his head fondly and glanced towards Blaise. His friend was lying on his stomach on his bed, writing furiously on, to what looked like, to the unknowing eye, a very old, scruffy looking piece of parchment with the dopiest looking smile Draco had ever seen plastered on his face, there was no need to ask what he was doing or even who it was he was talking to. Draco took a second to wonder if his face ever looked like that while he was talking to Harry before looking across at the room’s final occupant.
Draco grimaced as he noticed the gash on the back of his friend's head, the wound wasn't deep but was bleeding quite a bit, just behind his ear a gash of about three inches long was oozing red. Ron sucked his teeth and looked at Draco, 'Can you hold him a second?' Draco looked shocked but just nodded and moved around Ron,he replaced Ron's hands with his own and watched as Ron crouched behind Blaise's head. Without another word he pulled his wand from his sleeve and looked at Neville and then at Draco as if waiting for permission, each nodded silent approval with Draco shooting a warning glare. Ron took a deep breath and touched his wand almost to the wound, quietly he began to whisper, a string of words that Draco thought he recognised. Before their eyes Blaises's skin began to knit together. Beads of sweat gathered on Ron's forehead as the strain of the
'Attacked'
‘And you are telling me this because?’
‘What, why?’
The Gryffindor table was in uproar, the cheering was deafening, they had beaten Slytherin by ten points and Neville Longbottom was hoisted up on shoulders, the small boy had gone extremely red. Draco could hear the groans and mutterings of the Slytherin’s around him as Dumbledore cleared his throat once more,
.......
Hermione chuckled and let go of the boys regaining her composure.
…....
‘She know’s the truth Draco. I don’t know how but she does.’
......
Harry swallowed the quickly reappearing lump in his suddenly very dry throat, he thought about what Ron was asking. Ron had asked a simple question suddenly giving voice to all those feelings that had confused him so much. Harry struggled to formulate an answer, not wanting to lie to his friend but unsure whether he wanted to voice his feelings so soon.
Draco bit his tongue at all the comments he wanted to make regarding Harry having Slytherin in him and smirked.
It was the welcome feast  and whilst the Greta Hall was still buzzing with talk of the Dementors Draco was watching the staff table and quietly observing Professor Snape, he was absolutely fascinated with the Potions Professors behaviour,  he had known the man all of his life and had never seen him behave the way he was now, Snape was staring intently down at the dinner plate in front of him as though hoping to bore a hole in it, but, every thirty seconds or so his eyes would flick to the side, quickly glancing at the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor before snapping back to the untouched food in front of him, if Draco didn’t know better he would have sworn that the tips of the man’s ears were turning pink.
Harry was worried as he approached the trophy room that night.  He opened the door and looked at where Draco was sat. The blonde was sat with his back to a wall, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows and he was surrounded by books . Harry rolled his eyes, ‘Seriously?’ he thought, if it wasn’t Hermione it was Draco, revision notes were coming out of his ears.
‘Yes but I took the mark voluntarily, you did not.’
‘Potter  I don’t …’ before Draco could finish Harry grabbed his wrist, muttering under his breath, and before he knew it Draco found himself pulled behind a curtain and dragged in to the photo booth.
‘So, what is it you want to know?’
Pansy and Blaise : Gravity by Sara Bareilles
The dormitory was dark and quiet when Harry burst through the door. Seamus and Dean were already asleep but Neville witnessed the distraught boy throwing himself on his bed and heard him sobbing quietly in the dark. It took him a few seconds of indecision before he made his mind up and made his way across the room to Harry.
This chapter spans over a large amount of time leading right up to the Forbidden Forest so there are just some snippets of what is happening over that time period, so bare with me I just need to get the boys in to the forest :D
Harry felt the bed shift as Neville shrugged, ‘I don’t know really, I just did.’
It had been Harry’s best Christmas ever. He and Draco sat there until their eyes grew heavy, Draco swept the chess set on to the floor and leaned back on to his bed lacing his fingers behind his head stretching his legs out as he did so. Harry followed his lead placing his head next to Draco’s feet.
Draco was overwhelmed, these people should hate him, why were though so concerned? He felt like crying luckily though Blaise interrupted his thoughts.
GRYFFINDOR!!!
Harry and Draco had finally managed to find some time together after everything that had gone on. Once again, they found themselves in the same dark corner of the Trophy Room as Blaise and Neville were taking their turn in the Room of Requirement. Since his conversation with Neville, Harry had found himself wondering what exactly his two friends were getting up to, he found that if he thought too much about it he started getting jealous of their closeness, wanting that with his own boyfriend but not knowing how to step forward in to that part of their relationship. That being said, he was full of a nervous excitement of the thought of being alone with Draco, but he had other things on his mind which took precedent.
‘Question is..’ she continued, leaning in towards him. ‘What are we going to do about it?’
'Ron and Hermione,' Harry replied missing the rolling of Draco's eyes.
......
‘I’d take you any time on my own.’
Draco turned to face Harry with a raised eyebrow at the question that had seemingly come out of nowhere.
Harry’s unexpected and extremely gentle touch had an instant reaction on Draco. He swallowed hard as his hand shot out to grab Harry’s wrist stilling his movements. The two boys locked eyes and Draco felt as though his insides had turned to flame, he couldn’t take his eyes off the boy in his lap. The feelings he was having were driving him crazy, he almost felt bad for harry thinking of all the things he wanted to do with him, to him. He had restrained himself every time, holding back, feeling guiltier each time that he wanted more, more with Harry, more of Harry, just more. He had to admit it was getting harder and harder to restrain himself. Each time something happened like this between the two of them if was so soft and gentle with Draco letting Harry take the lead so as not to scare him. He really didn’t want to push Harry but sometimes it took everything in him to not just give in and grab Harry and follow his instinct and give in to his desires, he often wondered how Harry would react if he did just that.
‘Me too.’ Said Draco, ‘Harry?’
Neville reached out a hand and placed it on Harry’s shoulder hoping to calm his friend, ‘No, I know, look what else or, more specifically, where else is not on the map?’
‘Really? How do you know? When did you realise?’
Harry and Draco were standing in Draco’s room with their ears pressed against the door. They could hear the few Slytherin’s that had remained over Christmas chatting in the common room.
As if hearing Neville’s thoughts Harry stopping rambling and tan both his hands through his already mussed up hair whilst letting out another long breath, ‘if it’s ok, I want to ask you about you and Blaise’ ‘Ok,’ Neville replied leaning forward to rest his tanned forearms on his knees, ‘Go on,’
The Slytherin common room glowed green in the early evening  lake-light; the Slytherin's had barely returned from dinner in the Great hall and were just beginning to settle in for the night.
Draco pulled out the chair opposite, flinching as the wood scraped along the stone floor. He sat gracefully of the chair, crossing one long leg over the other. ‘Well,’ he said with a wink, ‘If you think it suits me I think I can live with it.’
‘He never left.’ She replied looking quite annoyed at the fact.
Harry, as though reading Draco’s mind placed a hand on the taller boys shoulder;
As always, he felt the flutter of snitches as their eyes met, had tried to ignore them, knowing nothing would ever come of it, Draco would never see him that way, and anyway, he had Seamus now.
I'm won't write a massive apology, just know that I am sorry. I've had a completely mental few months and although
......
‘I dunno’ Harry shrugged.
‘Sorry Harry, jeez this is tough, look ok, you know Charlie? My brother Charlie?’
The three had spent an emotional few minutes cementing their new bond as a family. Harry relaxed in the presence of his ‘parents’ and smiled contentedly. He knew James and Lily would always be his parents and a huge part of his life, but he knew they would be happy that he was as safe and loved as he was right now and would be accepting of the fact that Remus and Severus had well and truly earned the title of ‘parents.’ He smiled as he watched the two men sink, side by side, on to the sofa before him.
With that he stormed off slamming the bathroom door behind him leaving a very confused Harry staring after him.
‘Sssh Ron,’ said Harry as he stole a worried glance towards Draco, he needn’t have worried, Draco had his head bent and was silently chuckling in to his Cornflakes, he knew what Ron had just been told and found it amusing how annoyed the firey tempered red-head was.
‘The need will get stronger, it will pull at you until it’s all you can think about’ Severus continued, ‘then suddenly you will find yourself locking eyes with the other half of your soul and the song will just burst out, you won’t know it’s coming and you can’t stop it, you’ll hear the reply and you’ll know.’
Draco stood and watched Harry’s initial failed attempt, the words ‘open up,’ slicing the air in clear English,  he took a step closer as Harry tried once more, urging the smaller boy on silently. Suddenly, like the day in duelling club, the room was full of the sibilant sounds of Parseltounge, Draco fought the need to close his eyes as he let the sounds wash over him, they felt like warm caresses wrapping around him gently almost lovingly,but, before he could lose himself, the sounds stopped, before his eyes the tap glowed with a brilliant bright light and began to spin, Draco watched as the sink groaned and then  began to move, he followed its movement as it disappeared out of sight leaving a huge exposed pipe in its wake. He knew it was coming before he heard the words, ‘I’m going down there.’ Draco closed his eyes in defeat, he knew there was no point fighting Harry over this, there was too much at stake, before he could utter a word he heard the determined words of Ron, ‘Me too.’ He hadn’t expected any less, it was Weasley’s sister after all. He turned around to look at his friends, each set of eyes showed fear but determination, Blaise gave a sharp nod, Pansy swallowed hard but copied the motion, Neville, still holding Lockheart looked at Blaise for reassurance, ‘You can stay Nev, no one will judge.’ Neville felt every pair of eyes turn to him, he closed his eyes for a moment, when he opened them again they were full of determination, ‘I’m coming.’ He said with an affirmative nod.
Harry was fed up, he hadn’t been able to see Draco for days and it would now be even longer due to Quidditch and, Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to be running in to Snape every time he turned a corner. With a grunt he headed to the ibrary, he knew Hermione would be in there, he wanted to know if she had found anything else, and frankly, it would be a welcome distraction.
‘Harry you have to talk to him.’
‘In your dreams Weasel,’ he yelled back, ‘bet you dream about me a lot don’t you,’ he smirked, sneaking a look at Harry as he did this, he needed to get to him soon. Ron was as red as his hair, he jumped out of his seat and glared at Draco;
......
The DADA lesson had been greatly anticipated so the students were truly disappointed when the room seemed to contain nothing more than an old brown wardrobe. …. as Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
Finally, Draco found him and what he saw made his breath leave his body as though it was him who had been hit in the stomach with a bludger. Harry was frozen in the sky, his haunted star fixed, unmoving, on the pitch below, then Harry was falling, it was like slow motion at first, Draco couldn’t believe what he was seeing, his heart stopped. Harry was falling, falling from fifty feet up, falling through the air like a dead weight. Screams echoed around him, drowning out his own as Harry tumbled through the sky in front of him and there was absolutely nothing he could do.
Draco smirked again, so the only thing Harry was upset about was being called Potter, not the kiss comment, that was good to know, ‘ Sorry Harry I’ll behave.’
The blond man looked up at him questioningly , with wide, almost innocent, blue eyes, 'That's a funny name, is that my name?' The others watched in shock as Neville dropped to his knees, his hands flew to his face and, within seconds the tunnel was filled with the sound of sobbing. Blaise struggled to stand and made his way over to Neville, 'Nev?' he said cautiously, 'Nev?' he crouched gently next to Neville and placed an arm around the smaller boy.
......
‘Yes Drake,’ Harry said with a sigh, ‘Just hear me out, ok, so we each take turns asking another person whether they want a truth or a dare, then you either ask them a question they can’t lie to or they have to do whatever you tell them.’
......
Harry flitted along the corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run in to Filch or Mrs Norris, but he was lucky. He sped up the staircase to the third floor and tip toed to the trophy room.
‘Sorry,’ whispered Hermione, ‘I just thought that you might like to know that Harry is awake.’
Harry glared at Neville, ‘What does that matter? I need to find Draco.’ he snapped in exasperation.
Harry’s smile grew almost to the width of his face as he pulled Draco close again and once more planted a kiss on those pink lips. ‘Merry Christmas Drake.’ He whispered.
, did she say?’
‘Wonder what Potter’s written in this?’ he said quietly as he laid his hand on the cover as though to open it. He caught Harry’s eyes and watched them widen in disbelief that Draco would do that. Draco really didn’t want to but he felt so utterly betrayed and devastated that his rules when it came to Harry had flown out of the window. He could not seem to think straight and it was almost a relief when Percy Weasley spoke to him ordering him to hand the diary back. Draco didn’t want to, he refused, he wanted to read the diary so badly.
Draco watched the exchange with interest, that confidence that oozed from Blaise used to be matched by his own. A year ago he would have no problem saying exactly how he felt and expressing his own needs and wants, but now, now well Draco felt he did not even deserve to have even his most primal needs met. That thought brought Draco back to the present moment and the heat he could feel as Harry’s hand remained on his knee as Harry listened politely to Granger wondering how their lessons would work.
Harry loved coming to the kitchens, it was his escape, the warm comfort it brought reminded him of the Weasley’s kitchen, somewhere he felt safe and secure. He began to walk over to the table when there was a loud pop and Kreacher appeared before him.  ‘What can Kreacher do for Master?’ the elf asked, bowing so low his long nose scraped the floor.
The reply was instantaneous
Harry watched Draco and noticed his cheeks turn slightly pink, then the tips of his elfin like ears joined in. Harry giggled.
‘See you tomorrow Draco,’ said Hermione, then looking at Harry she smiled, ‘ Meet you in the common room,’ and with that she skipped off up the stairs. The two boys stood and watched her go then turned to each other.
Harry continued to listen with rising interest, he didn’t know what a secret keeper was, but he was confused. If what Draco said was true and, if he could believe McGonagall about how close his dad and Sirius were then it was obvious that something, somewhere had gone badly wrong. But, Pettigrew, now that was a new name. He made a mental note to ask Draco if he knew anything about hi.
Harry’s question filled the parchment.
‘Ok,’ said Draco coolly, ‘It was me.’
‘Mmmm Harry you taste good.’ Seamus leaned further in to Harry and laced his fingers in to the raven coloured hair of his boyfriend.
‘That bloody Git!’ Ron bellowed.
Draco stood, straight backed and looked straight at Ron, ‘Why wouldn’t I ?’
‘This.’
Draco gets his revenge...
Harry sat back in his chair with a thump.  He felt empty, as though all emotion had left him, like the aftermath of a Dementor’s  kiss. He felt tears stinging the corner of his eyes and brought his hand so his face pressing his the heels to his eyes in an attempt to stem the flow. He felt humiliated, it didn’t cross his mind to think that Draco was lying, as he had looked in to those grey eyes, burning with pain and indignation for him, and he had believed every word. He felt Draco lay a reassuring hand on his forearm and dropped his hands, attempting a reassuring smile that he didn’t really feel not quite sure why he had felt the urge to reassure the blond before him. Draco had leaned forward and was watching him with concern etched on to every bit of his face.
‘Oh for...’ Fred rolled his eyes and leant over and flicked the spider from Ron’s hand before turning and striding out of the Great Hall to catch up with his twin. Trembling, Ron slowly lowered his hand and stared wide eyed around the Great Hall, all eyes were on him, every pair on the Gryffindor table were narrowed in annoyance especially those near by that had been showered in Pumpkin Juice. The looks around the Great Hall varied from surprise to amusement but those of a certain blonde haired Slytherin were glistening with glee, when Ron met his eyes, Draco lifted his goblet as though to toast him and sneered across the top. Ron glared in his direction this had to be his doing, he just knew it.
‘ I know Blaise,’ Pansy interrupted, ‘but look what he did for me today.’
Harry started and stared at his red-headed friend, he wasn’t sure whether to wack Ron for insulting Draco or be surprised at the back-handed compliment. Luckily, at that moment Harry was saved from making a decision as Neville blundered through the dormitory door.
Draco looked at Harry quizzically but did as he had asked.
‘That’s how we know Harry, the rules of the soul song are simple, the first person to hear it will be your soul mate. The first time you sing it will be in their presence and their song with immediately answer with their half, it’s sweet really.’ Hermione had a dreamy look on her face and Harry had to stop himself from laughing. He couldn’t help wondering who his soul-mate was, who had the other half of his song. It literally could be anyone, after fifth year Harry had realised that he was looking at men as much as, if not more than he was looking at women, so it really could be anyone. Where on earth was he going to start?
‘Draco?’ Pansy tried, when again, she got no response from her blonde friend, she turned and stalked over to the fireplace, taking floo powder from the green plot on the fireplace and kneeling down called out, ‘Zabini Manor.’ Pansy pushed her face in to the flames, after a few minutes Pansy withdrew her head and stepped back just as Blaise stepped out from the floo. Without a word to any of them he took the weird parchment from where Pansy had placed it, he located a quill and turned the parchment over, in elegant handwriting he simply wrote;
Ron stared at Harry’s outburst, ‘Why are you defending him Harry?’
With that the stones around him flew at the Ravenclaw attacking him from every angle, some of the smaller stones shattered on contact with the boy and some burst in mid air. The boy’s skin was torn and bleeding and then a blast of pure magic hit him square in the chest and blasted him backwards 10 feet. The Ravenclaw was unconscious before he hit the floor. His friends ran over to him quickly after glancing warily at Harry.
Draco watched the pink tinge cross Harry’s face with interest. Where on earth had that come from? He must be feeling a bit warm. He shook his head and thought nothing more of it, he had more important things to worry about. He had no idea how Harry was going to gauge the news  so decided to test the waters a bit first.
Draco lifted one blond eyebrow in further question, he was completely confused as to what Harry was getting at.
‘I don’t know ‘Mione, I don’t know how I feel about them splitting us all up.’
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb, great chunks of the ceiling were falling in, the students quickly ran for cover , as suddenly as it started it was over, but now a great stone wall was dividing the chamber, Draco looked wildly around; ‘Harry, ‘ he shouted, his heart dropped as he heard the reply from the other side of the wall, ‘Drake?’
‘We have talked about this before babe.’
The whole school had let out a collective gasp as Draco had begun to sing. Their eyes had not left him as he began to move down the Gryffindor table coming to a stop behind Harry. Harry had turned fully on his seat to completely take in what he was seeing, he could hear mutters and gasps around him but didn’t care, his eyes were all for Draco the man was gorgeous and was rocking out hard, all for him. As Draco came to an end Harry felt the tug of the compulsion to reply, he stood and stepped towards Draco reaching his hand out to wipe a stray tear from the Slytherin’s cheek and ignoring the shocked gasps and questions he sang his reply:
Without another word Harry began to move once more, the movements were small and stilted as Harry nervously watched for Draco's every reaction, he could not deny how nice this felt or the pleasure that was coursing through his veins at that very moment, each press against the hardness in his boyfriend's trousers sent shivers up his spine, feeling it hard against his buttocks was undeniably amazing, and if this felt this good then he could only imagine how good other things would feel, as his thoughts gave way to all the things that they might do in the future his movements unconsciously sped up, he knew this was where they were headed and was determined to enjoy every second.
Harry watched Draco struggle to find the words to say and eventually took pity on him, 'so what I think you're trying to say is that it's ok that I'm still sat in your lap?' Harry watched draco's face for any signs that he had mis-read the situation but Draco merely nodded not wanting to risk opening his unreliable mouth, 'and it's ok, if I... you know... move a bit.' Draco nodded once more mouth suddenly dry. 'Do you? … is it?... I mean is it ok? Is it … is it nice?' Draco looked up into the earnest eyes and spoke for what felt like the first time in centuries, 'It feels incredible Harry, what about you what does it feel like fir you?'
“Luna’s winning,” said Hermione. “I don’t understand how, since she doesn’t have a whole floor’s worth of places, which George said was the point.”
“Huh?” said Goyle, already retreating.
“Oh, did you manage to get their memories back, then?” Harry asked, both surprised and not at the same time. If anyone could have done something so incredible, it would definitely be Hermione.
, she was in charge, so I was abiding by the rules. Which is more than can be said for others present.”
“Did you get everything you needed?” Hermione demanded as soon as she came within range.
Harry suppressed the urge to roll his eyes and nodded towards the rapidly filling train. It was getting close to 11 o’clock and students were hopping onto the carriages and saying their final farewells. “We’d better get on before we have to stand the whole way to Hogwarts.”
“Firs’ Years! Firs’ Years, over here!”
Harry was surprised to see a young girl in a wheelchair. The only time he had seen a wheelchair in the wizarding world had been in St. Mungo’s. Usually the Healers had people on their feet before they discharged them. And the castle was full of staircases - how would she be able to make her way to classes without a lift? The girl continued onwards, slowly pushing the chair along by herself, gaze fixed on the head table.
Sure enough, McGonagall called out one last name - “Xylander, Karl-Heinz” - and put away the scroll. The last First Year ducked his head to hide behind his long, floppy blond hair and walked woodenly to the stool. As soon as little Karl-Heinz was Sorted into “GRYFFINDOR!” Mcgonagall took away the stool and Hat and put them aside. Then she stepped up to the podium, took a breath, and began to speak in a calm, measured voice.
“That’s not what I meant,” Hermione replied.
Then, over all the hubbub, he heard a familiar call.
“Aren’t they lovely?” said Luna, startling Ron so much that he practically leapt into the air. He ended up stepping on Hermione’s foot and she hissed in pain as she glared at him. Ron quickly apologised with a peck on the cheek.
Hagrid chuckled. “Yeah, Harry deserves a longer holiday than he got. Anyway, I better talk to yeh later - I can see some Firs’ Years following the older students. Better do me job!” He turned a little, lifted a hand, and bellowed, “Firs’ Years! Firs’ Years, over here!”
“Well, let’s try this out,” Hermione said, leaning forward to pick a counter.
“Write to me more often, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told Ron.
“Of course,” said Harry, quickly. Ron was frowning at him, and he didn’t want to start the year off on the wrong foot.
“Huh,” said Ron. “You’re still a Prefect?”
The names of everyone who had been involved in the fighting had been etched below it. Harry felt sick when he saw how many of them there were. Could he have prevented so many from dying? He shuddered as they drew closer.
As Seamus began to regale the group with a story of how his mum had paraded him around the closest wizarding community, Harry let his gaze roam over the rest of the students. There were more of them present now, and it seemed to be more packed than usual. The Slytherin table, however, seemed to be rather empty. And, when Harry looked over, he spotted Malfoy, alone, in the centre of an open space. Parkinson, Goyle and Nott were huddled away from him and Harry spotted them giving him glances, frowns fixed on their faces.
With a sardonic smile, Harry shrugged. “It’s hard for everyone.”
Before Harry could retort, the door opened and Ginny poked her head in. “Hey,” she said, grinning at everyone. “How’s it going?” She nodded towards the board.
“I suppose so,” Hermione agreed, though her face had the pinched expression she usually had when they were about to talk about breaking the rules. It only lasted a second before it quickly smoothed out. She smiled a little and said, “But at least we get to do this properly, one last time.”
There was a beat of incredulousness. No-one seemed to know what to do. Then McGonagall cleared her throat and said, “Sadowski, Jadwiga.” A little girl with a long plait stumbled forward and nervously sat down on the stool.
Besides, there were other things to do, which Harry also wanted to help with, even if he kept half an ear out for news of Death Eaters. There was the rebuilding of both the Ministry and Hogwarts, among other landmarks and houses that needed mending. The Ministry needed to weed out all those who had been loyal to the Death Eaters’ cause; the school needed to upturn the lawn to get rid of curses and Dark magic. Harry willingly helped with this - it was his fault that the school had been attacked in the first place.
Hermione gasped and leapt to her feet, nearly upending the board. “Oh! I lost track of time!” She frowned at the board. “This is a very distracting game.”
Ron’s ears turned pink. “I- Well, it’s just- I’m a growing boy!”
Yes, this last year at Hogwarts was going to be even stranger than he had anticipated.
“They forgave you eventually,” Ron reminded her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders.
Turning pink, Hermione wafted her hand in front of her as if to ward off Harry’s words. “Anyway, we’ve got a little time before we need to go. Though, Slughorn is still the Potions professor, so he might be inviting us to his Club at some point, if he’s on the train.”
Speaking of fame, Harry found himself alone, despite the crowd on the platform. People were clearly giving him space so that they could stare at him and whisper. Harry could hear a few “Is that him?!” and “Do you think I could talk to him?” and a few Muggle-borns said, “What’s going on? Who’s that?” Evidently, they hadn’t been reading the newly updated
Sitting in the carriage, curled up out of sight of the door, was Draco Malfoy. His grey eyes were wide for a moment before he drew back, his eyes narrowing until he was giving them a wary look. He was already in his school robes. Somehow, he looked smaller than he ever had before. And, now that they were closer, Harry could see that Malfoy’s cheekbones were sharper. Were his wrists thinner, too? A sharp note of worry flooded Harry until he pushed it away. Why should he care that Malfoy seemed ill?
When the line reached the head table, the tiny students climbed up the steps. Just before Sun Jung reached it, McGonagall waved her wand and transfigured part of the steps into a ramp. Sun Jung was able to roll herself up without much fuss, and turned so that she was facing the rest of the room. Her face was set with determination and her black hair was pinned up in a bun with a pretty, blue floral pin. With the way that a couple of the First Years leaned towards her, Harry suspected that the pin was charmed to give off a sweet, calming scent.
you, Ron,” she said with a sigh. “The Seventh Years have the Head Boy and Girl this year. Besides, even if the Eighth Years did get to be the Head Boy and Girl, we weren’t there last year to be included.”
Of course, because they had stood talking for so long, they couldn’t find an empty carriage. Most of them were full, but a couple had space - though they were filled with Slytherins who gave them wary looks through the windows. Ron had turned his nose up at the thought of sharing with them and moved on. By the time they got to the last few carriages, there were less and less people until, finally, they found one that seemed to have no-one in it. Hermione opened the door and stepped in, but stopped with only one foot through the door.
Ron passed over the box, which was flat and rather large, likely big enough for a board. On the cover was a cartoon picture of Hogwarts which was bouncing slightly. Cartoon versions of the founders were accompanied by their mascots as they waved to whoever looked at them. Then they turned to each other and seemed to debate something. Beds and desks and ghosts appeared and disappeared. Large letters at the top, in bold, black letters, told anyone who cared to look that this game was called
They arrived at the carriages, all of them gleaming smartly where they stood. In front of them, the thestrals waited, heads held high. Some students were holding up the process as they crowded around the skeletal beasts. All of them were staring in shock and awe. Harry suddenly understood what Hermione was getting at.
Harry watched it all happening as he remembered - both his first time on the platform, and the strange between-place he had been with Dumbledore. It was a little disquieting to see it again, full of life. At the same time, he felt a sense of muted excitement. This would be the first year where, though his fame would follow him yet again, there wouldn’t be the threat of Voldemort or one of his plots hanging over his head.
“If you are,” Hermione said, “you could come with us to visit my parents for New Year’s.”
Harry was miffed. He’d been through all of the war, mastered Death itself, and he was being forced to return to school. Grimmauld Place matched his mood once he had been delivered the message. Hermione, of course, was in love with the idea and Ron even seemed enamoured with it, though Harry had the feeling that it was because he wanted to sneak into the hidden corners to canoodle.
“Well,” said Ginny, “I hate to interrupt, but the Prefects in my carriage left to go to the introduction talk you all have to do. One of them asked me to find you and tell you it’s time.”
“Oh, I’m sure it’ll die down eventually,” Hermione said, soothingly. “I expect their awe will fade after seeing you every day. Especially if they see you copying Ron’s essay and vice versa.”
!” Hermione interjected. “It’s nearly over. Professor McGonagall’s going to give her speech in a minute.”
Slowly, the Hall began to applaud, though it wasn’t as enthusiastic as Harry had heard before. Instead, a dark muttering began. Looking around, Harry could see most of the school were glaring at the Slytherin table. They were the only ones politely clapping as they refused to look at the rest of the students. Harry had the feeling that some of the students weren’t happy that the Sorting Hat hadn’t mentioned the Dark Wizards that had come from the House.
“What happened to her?” Ron whispered, looking rather horrified. Harry knew that Ron was thinking of George and his missing ear.
His friends chuckled, though their amusement was strained. Harry realised that the joke had probably been in bad taste, considering. He opened his mouth to apologise when Luna spoke up. “The moon looks so beautiful tonight.” The conversation moved on from Harry’s slip up and he relaxed a little.
“Just… You’re staring at Malfoy kinda like you were during Sixth Year. Do you think he’s up to something again?”
“Now,” McGonagall finished, her stern expression morphing into a smile, “let us eat. And again, I welcome you, and I hope you all have a wonderful, enriching year.”
“Ron!” she exclaimed. “You left without saying goodbye! Ginny’s further along the train, if you’re looking for her.” She looked over to Hermione and Harry in turn. “You… You will look after them, won’t you?” Mrs. Weasley asked, suddenly teary.
“Someone’s going to have to levitate her everywhere,” Seamus said. “But the First Years aren’t experienced enough to do that without her being hurt.”
“Ignore him,” said Parkinson, tugging Goyle into the corridor. “We’ll find somewhere else.”
“SLYTHERIN!” it yelled.
Their section of the table fell silent, all of them imagining how much worse it would have been had the Slytherins stayed and been loyal to their families. There would be more names on the plaque. Maybe that was the right way to think about it, but it didn’t seem like the Hat was referring to that. It was almost as if it was trying to lift the entire school on a pedestal for some reason. Harry couldn’t figure it out, but he decided to let it go and settled back, watching the tiny children step forward to discover their fate.
“What?” asked Ron.
That was another thing that Harry had to deal with. After everything, him and Ginny… Well, it was awkward. He’d had no contact with her and she’d had different experiences than him. They tried to reconnect and share what they hadn’t been able to with others, but something seemed to stop them. Harry didn’t know what it was and, by the time it reached September, they weren’t together anymore.
Soon, they were all settled around the board, each with their own counter. Harry had Nearly Headless Nick while Ron had claimed the lion. Neville had taken the badger, while Luna had been given the eagle - which had prompted a brief conversation about how strange it was that the mascot wasn’t a raven. Hermione ended up with the Grey Lady. After an hour, Luna was somehow winning while Hermione was frowning, trying to work out how to catch up. Harry, meanwhile, was losing horribly and was somehow in detention
“You’ll be there too, won’t you, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley asked.
“Blimey,” said Ron, looking around more carefully. “Maybe they won’t even have a Quidditch team! Gryffindor will definitely win, ’specially with Ginny on the team.”
“It’s pretty good, right?” Ron said, beaming. “Can you cast a stasis charm on this, ’Mione? We can keep playing when we get back.”
“I mean, we might have to, mate,” Ron conceded. “But we’ll come straight back once they’re done talking.”
Finally, the carriage pulled up in front of the castle. Harry had been staring at it since they had turned a corner and they could see it. Somehow, despite everything, the castle looked untouched by war. At least, it did from a distance. As they drew closer, Harry could see the dark swathes of grass that had been burnt by curses and no longer lived. Some of the stonework that hadn’t been too badly damaged had been left as it was, the glint of metal showing a plaque that described who had been involved in the destruction and who had lost their life defending it there.
Ron and Hermione came back after an hour to continue their game. The carriage grew livelier and Harry smiled as he watched his friends, relaxed and free from the terror of the previous years. Time wore on and, soon, the Hogwarts Express was slowing down at Hogsmeade Station. Everything became loud as the whistle blew and hundreds of students in black robes began to disembark. Younger students stared in awe at Harry, but he tried to ignore them when he stepped onto the platform. The familiar clamouring of students, the whistle of the train, the cool air as night fell… All of it flooded Harry’s senses and he looked around with nostalgia. This was the last time he would experience this.
“You would have made a really good Head Girl,” he said, ignoring her noise of protest. “I mean, you’d make a good example to the kids with your secret potion brewing and your rebel clubs…”
“By the time you get out, there won’t be anything to invest in,” Neville pointed out.
“Except for McGonagall,” Dean interjected.
After the Battle of Hogwarts, there was an awful lot of bureaucracy. The Ministry catalogued who had been under an Imperius and those who had been true Death Eaters. Many of them fled, but there were Aurors to catch them. In this post-war world, Harry Potter wasn’t needed.
Harry supposed she had a point and shrugged. With that sorted, they all crowded around the door of one of the rear carriages. It took them much less time to stuff their trunks onto the train using magic. Even less, Harry realised, than what would have happened had he still had an owl. But Hedwig was gone, as were a lot of the older students, and they could easily float their trunks along the corridor.
“Technically,” said Malfoy, suddenly becoming a little more animated. He curled his lip at Ron, eyeing him with distaste. “
Then he was gone, left behind as the carriage picked up speed.
When they opened the box, it turned out that the board actually resembled the Marauders’ Map, unfolding more and more until it held all the rooms. None of the secret passageways were on it, but Harry spotted the statue of the one-eyed witch and the Whomping Willow in the grounds. There were tiny counters featuring the mascots and some of the ghosts associated with each house. The board itself moved, with things popping up when counters were placed on a square. Or, when set up correctly, providing fake coins when the players passed a certain point; the board would open and the coins would shoot out at the player. Instead of a jail, there was detention with an ugly toad dressed in pink.
“That’s awful,” said Dean Thomas. “How is she going to get around here?”
“Never mind,” Harry said, waving his hand. “Let’s see.”
“Oh, Ronald, honestly!” Hermione said with a sigh. “You and your stomach! I’m surprised it hasn’t gotten us into more trouble.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I had a bit of a holiday.”
“Huh? Yeah,” Harry answered. “I’m fine. Why?”
“A few more announcements, and then I shall let you eat and get to bed so you can be up bright and early for classes to start tomorrow. As always, the Forbidden Forest is out of bounds to everyone. Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you that there is a long list of banned items, if you wish to take a look as a reminder of what isn’t allowed. As far as I’m aware, this includes every Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes product, so I hope none of you have brought anything along with you. The Astronomy Tower is only to be used during classes and not for illicit trysts. Lastly, there is a section on the east side of the castle which is still under reconstruction - though it is safe, we ask you not to go there for now.
“Don’t worry, mate,” said Ron, grinning at him. “It’s only a year. Then you’ll be hunting down all the people that escaped justice.”
“Well, of course!” said Ron, grinning. “You’re the Saviour of the Wizarding World, after all.” He had pitched his voice a little louder than necessary and Harry grimaced. Ron looked around, chest puffed out, then turned back to Harry and lowered his voice. “I think that’s made them stop staring,” he muttered.
“Now, as most of you are aware, the previous year’s Seventh Years are with us once more. They will be here for an Eighth Year. As such, the castle has been transfigured into extending a little in certain areas. Much of the Eighth Years will be war heroes, as the Daily Prophet tells us. However, I must ask the younger students to respect them and their privacy. Please concentrate on your own studies or you will never gain your O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s.
“Like Monopoly?” Harry asked.
“Like he deserves,” Ron agreed.
She didn’t seem to notice as she rolled down the ramp and pushed herself around the tables towards the Slytherin one at the opposite end of the Hall. Nobody dared to speak as she manoeuvred herself around the cramped students who were giving Malfoy a wide berth. Clearly, there was no way for her to fit in there. Instead, she headed to the space beside Malfoy and stopped - rather far from the table.
“Like what?” asked Ron, confused.
“Yeah!” Ron agreed, pulling Hermione closer so he could put an arm around her. “I really thought Hermione would get it.”
“Yeah,” Harry piped up as Ron’s stomach grumbled again. “You’re getting louder.”
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked, looking rather concerned. “It can’t be easy for you, coming back here.”
“Because of the International Statute of Secrecy,” Hermione said, distractedly. She was already levitating her trunk towards the train, carefully nudging it around younger students who were in the way. “Once that came in, the Ministry tried Portkeys, but that was a bit problematic, what with people missing it or getting Portkey-sick. That was when the Minister for Magic at the time-”
They paused, however, when someone called for them on the platform. Quickly and carefully, they stacked their trunks to the side and returned to the door. A younger student who had been about to board stopped, frowned up at them, realised who they were, and scuttled away with wide eyes and a blush. Harry watched the boy go until his attention was snagged by Mrs. Weasley.
There, through the crowd that was giving him a wide berth, was Malfoy. His mother was with him. They both clutched at each other; neither of them looked ready for Malfoy to board. Malfoy looked paler than ever, and Harry wasn’t sure if that was his natural look or if he was ill. Whatever the case, he was valiantly trying to ignore the glares sent his way, from all sorts of students. Even Slytherins were frowning at him. Apparently, Malfoy was going to be a pariah for the next year, even when the Wizengamot had tweaked their ruling to force him to return.
“What is it?” Harry asked, his voice remarkably even.
Looking over at the Slytherin table again, Harry was surprised to find that the gaps between Malfoy and the other students were shrinking. Most of the students now sitting beside him seemed to be First Years, all of whom were talking to him. He looked a little alarmed from this distance, but was answering them. With his blond hair that seemed to shine under the flickering candlelight, Malfoy looked a little like a prince or a king holding court. Harry frowned at the thought.
Draco’s trial was complicated. There were his attempts on Dumbledore’s life that had ended in the harm of his fellow students. The Wizengamot had no evidence for these crimes and Harry didn’t tell them anything of import. Draco had, after all, failed. His refusal to reveal Harry in the manor and his subsequent lying to his aunt was taken in his favour, as was the fact that he hadn’t actually fought in the Battle. It was eventually decided that he would have a liaison officer of some sort while he stayed on house arrest with some community service which he reportedly did by helping with the rebuilding efforts. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about the outcome, but he accepted it and moved on.
“I did,” Hermione happily replied. “Of course, they still seem to forget little things, but they remember me and all of the important stuff, so that’s good enough for us. It’s just unfortunate that they were so angry once they’d remembered and they realised what I’d done…” She grimaced, apparently remembering some sort of row. Harry didn’t envy her.
Harry didn’t care much about Lucius, since he’d spent a good portion of the war trying to kill Harry and everyone he cared about. Since he had broken out of Azkaban and committed horrible deeds once he had, the Wizengamot resentenced him to another stint in the prison. There were, however, less Dementors, so Harry thought he was getting off lightly. Lucius had looked both ancient and weary and had accepted the verdict with nary a peep.
“Look,” said Hermione, quietly. She pointed at names towards the bottom of the giant plaque, separated by the others by a line, softly scored into the metal. Harry blinked and read the smaller words at the top of that section.
“See you later, Hagrid,” Harry said, letting him corral the tiny First Years towards the lake.
“Slughorn’s going to give you a N.E.W.T. on a silver platter,” Ron put in. “And you’re going to have to go to those Slug Club meetings.”
“Shall we share a carriage?” Ginny said as she and Neville appeared. Behind them, Harry could see Seamus and Dean who both waved at them.
Grinning, Harry made a beeline for the massive figure he could see over the heads of the students, Ron and Hermione following after him. When he got close enough, Harry raised a hand, waved, and called out to him. “Hi, Hagrid!”
Top of the list was attending all the trials of the Death Eaters he had interacted with. He had to sit through testimonies of all the horrible things they had done. Afterwards, he had had nightmares, though they were thankfully
“That must be Sun Jung Ryu,” Hermione quietly informed them, clutching at Ron’s arm. “Her family has a business in wand-making and originally moved here from South Korea to consult Ollivander before he was kidnapped. They hadn’t officially settled, but they weren’t able to leave the country before Voldemort took over. Apparently, her mother was followed home one day and attacked by Death Eaters, no-one’s sure why. Mrs. Ryu died and Sun Jung was hit by a powerful Dark Curse. No-one’s been able to lift it since then. It was in the Prophet, after it was cleaned up.”
With the wonderful spread before him, the warmth of the Great Hall and his friends around him, and the exhaustion that crept up on him, Harry soon forgot about Malfoy and the Slytherins’ strange behaviour. He only remembered as he was climbing into bed a couple of hours later, nestled in the new, additional room at the top of the Gryffindor Tower. For a second, he thought he should be concerned about it. Then, with a yawn, he lay down and told himself it was nothing.
“I’ll make sure you're kept well informed, Mrs. Weasley,” Hermione assured her.
“This is impressive magic,” Hermione commented once Ron had levitated the board to a level they could all see. “How long did it take?”
Hermione smiled gratefully and leaned into him. Harry quickly looked away in case they were going to kiss. With a flick of his wand, he lifted his trunk off his friends’ ones. “Let’s find a carriage,” he said over his shoulder.
“Oh!” Hermione turned back to Ron, blushing. “Well, it was made a requirement of being enrolled in the school. Using the train, I mean. I’m surprised they allowed you two to stay at school after Second Year and that stunt with the car,” she added under her breath.
His gaze inevitably trailed up to the professors’ table. There was no Dumbledore and his silver beard, smiling down at the students with a twinkle in his eye. Nor was there a dark-eyed, bat-like Snape glowering at everyone. Instead, there were a few new faces, as well as old. Slughorn must have been at Hogwarts before today since Harry had received no invitation to a commandeered carriage of the train, but he sat there now. He was trying to make conversation with Trelawney who seemed to be trying to predict something. Flitwick and Sprout were talking to a new man, his brown hair neatly combed. He had a lined face and was frowning a little; Harry thought he seemed irritated or displeased.
Harry nodded. There wasn’t much he could do about that. “I’m surprised neither of you are Head Boy or Girl,” he commented.
“So she’s stuck in the wheelchair?” Harry asked.
After everything, Draco wasn’t the worst thing that Harry had dealt with.
“Sure! Ginny got asked to be in her friends’ game, so we came to find you three.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I already
As the carriage moved off, Harry glanced out of the window and spotted Malfoy. He stood apart from the crowd as the rest of the students gave him a wide berth. Harry thought he looked defeated, his head ducked a little and his gaze distant. Then he looked up and their eyes met briefly. It sent a jolt of nervous excitement through Harry, kind of like when he’d realised that Malfoy had been up to something nefarious in Sixth Year.
Neville grinned at them. “Hey!” he exclaimed. “We’ve been looking for you.” He spotted the game and raised his eyebrows. “Is that one of George’s new games?”
Harry gave her a sheepish grin. “Yeah, I guess. They’ll all move on to hero worshipping you two.”
Harry hesitated. Then, as he turned to leave, he said, “Maybe you wouldn’t be, if you’d made better choices.”
in detention?” Ron asked Harry.
“Yes,” said Hermione, miserably. “And her father has decided to stay in Britain to help Ollivander - he might even take over for him. So she can’t even go home to see the rest of her family.”
“Ron!” she said, obviously trying to chide him about his public display of affection.
They laughed as Ron grumbled, though a smile was on his face. Harry relaxed a little more. He had expected the start of the year to be more solemn and he had been worried about it while he also thought it would be appropriate. Their mirth was a treasure and Harry thought it was a better way to spend their last year as children.
All of them were quiet as they ascended the stairs to the huge doors that had been pulled open. Glancing at his friends, Harry noted how they looked around, eyes a little distant as they remembered what had happened here. Harry shuddered as he remembered all the bodies. But the Entrance Hall was clear of destruction and blood. Nothing had changed, save for one thing. Beside the doors to the Great Hall was an enormous memorial, made of bronze. It seemed dull compared to all the marble, but it also seemed more worldly. At the bottom of it was a carving of roses, dittany and aconite.
“I uh, I do the laundry and the shopping every Sunday. So. If there’s something specific that you want, uhm, just let me know and I can get it. O-Or you’re welcome to come with me, if you want. Ah, I also don’t typically make lunch. I really just make breakfast and dinner. But, of course you can have anything you want for lunch. This uh, this is all yours. Uhm.” He was suddenly out of things to say. He was almost thankful that he didn’t have to hear his own anxious voice anymore.
Any and all confident left his body and he recoiled in shock. He realized the implication of his own words and blinked a few times. “I suppose that’s a conversation to have later. Not tomorrow, but eventually I would, yes.”
Demgass' copy was passed to Draco, along with a quill. ‘Draco Potter-Malfoy’ was written in a big beautiful cursive, but the 'Potter' was a bit awkward, as he wasn't used to writing the word. He wordlessly pushed the document and quill to Harry. ‘Harry Potter-Malfoy’ was written in a small and timid cursive. His letters were close and tight.
“I know.” He paused a moment, “How will I be able to contact you after this?”
“Yea, it’s charming.” Draco responded, only to turn and see that Harry’s bewilderment did not agree.
Harry looked at Draco sheepishly. “Sorry about that.”
He heard a few gasps and a whimper or two, then Harry’s room went quiet. The sinful noise played in his head once more. He decided then and there that of all the people he’s shagged, Harry has the sexiest end noise.
The blonde felt a soft smile creep onto his own face as he thought through the concept. "You are just Harry, at least to me."
Neville nodded, “You made Dean and Seamus finally understand how bad they were.”
Draco finally thought of enough fucked up things to kill his boner, and with that, they were both drifting back to sleep.
Draco smiled behind the door. “Won’t you come out, then? You know I’ll be gentle, loving, I’ll take my time, make you feel so good.” He tempted. “I know how you like it. Soft touches, sweet words. Come on, Harry. Won’t you get in bed with me?”
He had some time the next weekend to start reading around the restricted section. He started at the beginning, A. A vast majority of the A section covered ancient stuff. He made sure to take notes on anything interesting or potentially relevant.
He could handle the fact that he wasn’t treated well. He could handle knowing that his father wasn’t the same, and that things couldn’t be as they were. But the thought of Auror involvement terrified him. He didn’t want it to become a legal matter. The thought of having to testify was terrifying to him. He wouldn’t want that. Certainly, his father deserved to be locked up. That was no question to him. But saying he was abused was too far. He couldn’t believe something like that. There may have been a few shady parts of his character, and maybe he didn’t treat or love Draco like he should have, but Draco didn’t believe abuse for a second.
“About what?”
Narcissa cracked a smile, “Precious. It’s a good thing he has you in his life. Hopefully he’ll take after you and Harry, he needs the good influence. He needs someone to tell him all the good things about his blood, he's of the Black line after all. Oh, and his father. I know he was the only truly competent DADA professor you ever had.”
"Well, I always thought I'd never marry. I didn't think that was a possibility for me because my father would likely never approve of me marrying a man. But when I did picture myself marrying, I thought he'd be some stuck up man that I hardly knew, with whom my father would make the arrangement. I thought he'd pick out someone from our social class for me to court. Though it's unlikely he would have been from the UK, probably France or something. I thought he'd be unhappy to marry me or think me nothing more than a fuck. I had always resigned myself to the idea that I'd never be married to someone I truly love. But here I am."
"You say 'friend' and that worries me. Why are they helping you?" Hermione asked between what seemed to be her making mental notes of different people, compiling a silent list of names. This mixed focus caused her to stumble a bit on the pronoun as she wasn't used to using it.
No one could have guessed how much being a Healer would mean to Draco. It’s the one good thing he’s done. It’s his way of trying to reverse the damage his parents and friends caused. It’s his apology. His atonement. But it’s also become his passion. Saving people, healing injuries, taking care of others, it’s become something he thoroughly enjoys. Having his own scrubs made it official somehow. It was as if having his own uniform made it real, set in stone, permanent. It turned his dream into a reality. He really was a nurse now, it wasn’t just a nickname anymore.
Harry Potter. Apologies, sir, I didn't know your face." The elf let him in and took his broom. "Draco is in his old room. Upstairs, third one down the hall."
“Mm. Well, let's hope the boy doesn't snap one day. It really would be a shame if he did.” He droned as he began to walk out of the room.
“I’m gonna kick your arse.”
Draco’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. “Oh that’s precious. Don’t be embarrassed. When was the last time you wanked then?”
Harry frowned and let out a huff. "Whatever, I might not be tall but I'm easily stronger than you."
When it fell over, Teddy didn’t cry like most toddlers would. Instead, he made sure Narcissa was alright. “It okay. Build again, see.” He started building the tower again so she wouldn’t be sad. “I sad, but okay. See.”
“It’s Draco, daft bastard.” Harry grumbled as he looked across the room at the Slytherin table.
Harry’s face went red. “I’m sorry if that made you uncomfortable or if you saw something you didn’t want to see, I really don’t mean to be indecent.”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure what to call the feeling that overcame him. He felt happy, warm, and lucky. He started smiling, and he wasn’t even sure why.
Harry bragged about it too, but he was hardly in a position to speak about achievements.
Harry read the paragraph about himself aloud. “The Potter family gained their riches through a cycle of inventing potions and selling the companies for a fortune, while still retaining a large portion of the stock. This guarantees their riches will only grow through the years. The Potter line has come down to one Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived and saved not only magic society, but potentially the world from Voldemort’s plans. Rumor has it Potter’s been working in the Muggle economy to bring in thousands more each month, working to support both himself and his godson, Edward Lupin, son of war heroes Remus and Nymphadora Lupin. Did we mention he’s single? See more on Harry Potter in our top ten most desirable bachelors list on page 24.” He rolled his eyes and passed the magazine around for his friends to see. He figured somebody at the bank snitched to the journalist about where his money was coming from.
Andromeda let out a laugh. “
“What can I say, I’m a snake.” He grinned.
“Harry, this is amazing!” He hugged Harry tight, holding him close and nearly knocking him over.
“I just didn’t realize your beauty shone from the inside, outward.” He watched the other have no response and a smirk took over his features. “I thought you said you’d always win?” He teased.
He took in a deep breath and shook his head. “I don’t know what the hell I’m doing, unloading all this on you. You’re a child. You’re a child and I’m insane.” He stood up and walked off, digging around in his stuff to find some chocolate. “Remus used to give students chocolate.” He shoved some in his mouth before offering a handful to James.
“Of course I d- fuck!”
He let go of the trunk so the tree couldn’t feel when he was about to make his escape. He stared out at his friends, getting into position and readying to try and outrun the tree. He felt a bit foolish, and part of him knew there was no way to best the tree. He prepared himself for a beating.
They had their own impromptu dance party and wasted away an hour.
“Well what about yourself? You are no Casanova, but I haven’t seen you around any of the girls that work here.”
It was less of a statement, and much more a promise.
He glanced at the time and tried to reason with Draco. “It’s only ten. I’ll be asleep before midnight.”
Harry’s lips parted and he leaned back against the headboard of his bed. He closed his eyes a moment and swallowed. His chest was heavy and his throat was dry. He couldn’t believe what was happening. His mother was there.
Harry couldn't help but to grin. The Cupboard Project was nearly done, all he needed to do was present it to Wizengamot when it was ready and fix it up later for the final vote. But now, now he was in for a real fight. He couldn't resist it. He never liked war, but fighting for change and equality was a fight he couldn't thwart. "Count me in, Pawk. I fully support this."
“It’s about the principle of it! You stole my door, ate it, and you teased me. I’ll have my revenge, Potter!”
It all started a few days after Valentine’s Day, when Harry referenced Draco’s letter. “So, did you ever experience the raw honey of me?”
“Alright, I know a few spel-“
June 5th marks Draco’s 19th birthday.
Draco wanted to cry. No one has ever seemed to love him so deeply. In that moment he knew that Harry loved him. There was no doubt, no what if, no hesitation. Only two boys in love. That was all that mattered to him.
"You've got to be fucking kidding me." Draco mumbled as he covered his face. He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath, looking around the room.
“Fine, I promise.”
think I could do it. Even if it was just for a moment, you believed I did.” He let out a chuckle at his own sad victory, then his face fell back into a look of desolation and regret. “No Draco, I never killed anyone. Not unless you count the Basilisk. But he was just as sentient and alive as the two of us, the only different was his species. He technically wasn’t one of us, but he was just like us.”
“Draco.” Harry whined.
Harry mulled over Draco's words and began eating a biscuit. He made a face and mumbled, "Not enough cinnamon."
and there was soot on me face.”
Rather than showing any ounce of sympathy for Harry, Draco instead began to laugh.
Draco suddenly stood up, feeling inspired. He went into the bathroom and fixed himself up, running his hands through his hair and fixing his clothes. He smiled at his own reflection before going into the sitting room where Harry was sitting, looking over some parchment that was doubtlessly work-related. Though he didn’t have much of a plan, he confidently strode over and sat beside the man, confused to see relief on the other’s face.
"We should get married here, with all the dragons."
Teddy Lupin has his first birthday party.
“I thought you just want it to do it annually.” Harry repeated. “But I did try a little bit to make it special. I got you five flowers instead of one, and uh, what we did that night.” He subtly referred to the last blowjob he gave Draco. He really enjoyed doing it.
The blonde took the noodle and felt a bit silly. Nevertheless, he flicked it at the wall, and it stuck. “It’s done!” He seemed quite surprised and proud of himself.
"I remember in Hogwarts, I would do anything to avoid the paparazzi and their stories." He took a deep breath and came to the refreshing realization that he couldn't make himself give a single fuck about them anymore. "But now, I don't care. I'm not gonna let them stop me. What about yourself?"
“I know. I'm used to seeing him in his school uniform, and where I'm from, I rarely saw men dress so nicely. It's just sexy.”
Hermione was satisfied with that answer, and they went back to editing their plan. “Alright, we now have an official plan to investigate and prosecute people charged with abuse. Now we need to do this all over again with an adoption process and housing orphans. Fuck, we forgot to expand it to apply to magic.” She couldn't help but yawn and rub her eyes. “Merlin, we've been staring at this screen for hours.” Hermione glanced down at the digital clock in the corner of the screen, seeming disappointed by what she saw. She pressed the button to print the document as she spoke, “I'll take home what we have and we can meet here later to keep working.” She packed her things, “I'm late for dinner.”
Seamus pondered the questions a moment before throwing out a suggestion. "Well, it'd only be fair that they each have one girl and one boy best friend. Perhaps one could work in the Ministry and then the other could do something else?"
“Are you excited?”
He smiled and asked them how they had been. They went into an extensive conversation about how their lives had been. Moony bragged that his wife forgot their anniversary while he remembered, he still hasn’t let it go because this is probably the only time it’ll ever happen and he wants to milk it for all it’s worth. Prongs talked about how his wife’s birthday is coming up and he’s going to surprise her. Padfoot told everyone that he recently slept with a man who died in the seventeen hundreds.
On the second, Draco took his Potions and Charms exams.
“I’m sure you would.” Draco said as he got up, deciding to preserve what dignity Harry had left.
Still nothing.
“Have they really met before?” Dean asked, “They just looked at each other like they’re already planning to overthrow the government.”
Harry thought a moment, quickly coming up with a theory, “Because you lot linked your minds to a piece of paper and didn’t want it traced back to you.”
Harry eventually talked Hermione into buying Ron a few spellbooks on offensive and defensive strategies, since he would be facing a lot of criminals in his career.
Harry was free, wild for the tongue that pushed in as deep as it could. Any shame had left him. He let out every noise that overcame him and moved faster, silently demanding more.
Harry was glad to have Draco back, and Draco was happy to finally be home.
He and Harry arrived at a quite large house, two stories high and it’s size was about four hundred meters squared. It was no Manor, but it also wasn’t a simple suburban home either. It was giant.
With that, they parted ways to sit on opposite sides of the Great Hall.
To their utter disappointment, however, the dance did have to end. But it went on and on until the ball was over. They held hands on their walk to the Floo, which seemed to take forever. They did everything to prolong the arrival of tomorrow. When they appeared back home, Harry made the very soft comment that he now owed Draco three kisses. Since it was already late, they very hesitantly said goodnight and went to bed. But Harry’s mind lingered on his idea from two days ago, of cuddling with Draco. As unwise as it was he found himself a slave to temptation. Had Draco asked, he wouldn’t have said no. He could only manage to keep himself in his room and lay down for the night.
“You would know about that, wouldn’t you?” She responded with a knowing smile.
"Do it again." Where he should have been embarrassed, he only knew desire. It felt good and he wanted to feel good. He wasn't the blushing and coy man that either of them expected he would be.
Draco let out a soft chuckle and he sat up, looking down at Harry. “I could get used to seeing you under me.”
In truth, there wasn’t much Harry could do to embarrass himself. Draco had seen some pretty embarrassing faces and knew how bad it could be. And in his opinion, Harry was far too gorgeous to make himself look
Harry also notified Andromeda that he and Draco will be there for Christmas.
He knew his plan would work because Draco did the same thing almost every time.
“That’s wonderful! Are you enjoying your toy?”
With her taken care of, he only had to worry about his final two names, Gaius and Cassiopeia Searcy. He stepped out onto the streets and an owl flew down to him with a letter. He took it and saw it was from Pawk. She wrote about how she’d already finished off half her list. He sent off a reply saying he only needed to convince the Searcys.
“Harry seriously refused the house elves?” Pansy asked with a raised eyebrow.
He took a deep breath decided to head to Diagon Alley. He needed to find an apology gift.
A confused smile graced Draco’s face. "What?” As much as he didn’t understand what Seamus was implying, it was still a bit amusing to hear.
. I don’t imagine being in the classroom teaching a new generation, I think of wandering the halls with Draco until we’re both old and senile. The future in my head with him is the happiest I’ve ever hoped for. I know I love him because through it all,
Draco took a deep breath and rolled over to lay on his back, taking a piece of parchment from the table, and writing a crude letter to Pansy that detailed his anxieties about what Harry might do. He hated that he was so worried about it, but he was. Harry was being handed the chance to get back at Draco for everything he’s ever done. Not to mention his angry display towards Lucius. Harry had the balls to get in Lucius Malfoy's face and call him out.
Harry didn’t know why, but he felt his face heat up a bit. He knew he had no reason to react like that and he wasn’t even sure if he was actually blushing, but he was a bit embarrassed. He chalked it up to his lack of experience with men, and the fact that he was still a horny teenager.
“When does she present?”
“You would shag my dad?!” Ron’s voice jumped in pitch due to how shocked and disgusted he was.
Harry caved inward and crawled into Draco’s arms, mumbling, “I don’t like sad things. It’s really good, but sad.”
They both sat up and looked at the radio that seemed to have turned on by itself, letting a song by Ed Sheeran echo off the walls.
Draco did his best to stop a grin from slipping onto his face as he nodded. Of course he loved the idea of Harry showing skin, but he didn't want to make it obvious.
Harry let out a chuckle and nodded. “I guess it does.”
“You did always have a weak spot for being pampered.” Pansy pointed out with a grin. “But I’m so happy for you. I never thought Harry was so romantic.”
Harry gave a dry swallow and thought a moment, looking away. “Well, uhm.” He paused again, unsure of how to word his thoughts. “I trust you, Draco. I really do, but, ah. I ..... I wouldn’t want to uhm.” He stopped again, his cheeks turning red. He hid his face in his hands and tried to collect himself to finally get out the words that were hung in his throat. “I don’t want to have sex, not yet. And, I also don’t want to be seen naked. I’d just like to keep my knickers on, if that’s okay.”
Harry cracked a smile. “Perhaps not. But they’re still there. All of them.”
He opened it up, a bit excited since he had no idea what Draco might have gotten him. A grey coat was revealed and it brought a small smile to his face. He reached to pull it out of the wrapping but he was surprised by what he felt. “I’ve never felt something so soft.” He pulled it out and wrapped the coat around himself and almost immediately felt warm.
He was also helping Hermione come up with a list of changes that she and the other eighth years are going to work on when they join the Ministry next year. There was a whole group of aspiring Ministry workers at Hogwarts, which wasn’t surprising as most Hogwarts graduates go into the Ministry. But they had a whole list of things they wanted to accomplish. Rights of Werewolves, of House Elves, fixing corruption, taking unequal power from pureblood families, regulating the use of Dementors, starting a form of child protective services, and many other changes.
As he thought about it, he realized he didn't even know Draco was gay. He had never come out, which made him wonder if Draco was even comfortable with his own sexuality, and that made him feel even worse. He had to speak to Draco, but he didn't want to barge into Malfoy Manor unannounced, so he didn't take the Floo. Instead, he hopped on his broom and took off. He had a vague idea of where the manor was, and quite frankly, it wasn't exactly a small place. He knew he'd recognize it when he saw it.
On Harry’s day off, he took everyone down to a little lake that he found, so they could enjoy the warm weather.
“I know, but they put the idea in your head.” He was standing up straight again and seemed to be feeling better.
“I can’t believe this.” Harry held his head in his hands, chuckling a bit.
Harry cringed at his legal name, following the goblin towards a familiar hallway that lead to the offices and meeting rooms. By some sick twist of fate, he was taken into the same meeting room where his marital contract was hashed out. Inside, he saw Molly and Arthur, Narcissa and Draco, Neville, and another goblin sitting around a table with a few files around them. Everyone seemed really sad, except Draco. Draco was silently shedding tears, glaring at the table in outrage.
Draco saw a small bursted ball on the ground and picked it up. “It was a popper. Look at it.”
I've written even more Drarry fics if you're interested in reading them. I've also written Johnlock and Ineffable Husbands. I even plan on eventually entering Marvel territory. If you’re interested in any of that, subscribe to my account for more!
The day before everyone left for break, he distributed out all the presents amongst his friends. Pansy was a bit surprised that Harry for her something, but she took it with a smile and promised not to open it till Christmas.
Draco stepped forward in excitement. “You two have been talking?”
That night, Draco laid in Harry's bed with the man draped on his chest, his head on one shoulder, just like when they danced. Draco looked down and saw that if he wanted, he could kiss the other on the forehead. But he didn't think they were close enough just yet for something so intimate and loving. Perhaps it was the love behind such a move that made him hesitate. Harry, on the other head, was more focused on the fact that his heart was fluttering and he didn't feel like he was alone. It was warm and he loved the way Draco smelt without his cologne. He buried his face in the blonde's shoulder and closed his eyes.
After a long night of discussing all the ways it could go wrong or right, they realized the pros outweighed the cons dramatically. They decided their best bet would be to get Pansy to play to Draco’s competitive nature to get it started again. She suggested it considering Harry would be too oblivious to manipulate but Draco couldn’t stand the thought of losing. Especially losing to Harry. Some things don't change.
“Four-eyes.”
“Of course.”
Happiness can't last long. Especially not in a tired, hungry, thirsty, and broken man. "I've told you everything now let me go. I want to go back to him. I want to see him and hold his hand. I want him to wake up because I never told him that I love him and I can't live with myself if he dies without knowing." There of all places, it dawned on him. He didn't just
He paused and tilted his head.
Draco was taken aback as he realized what this was really about. Harry had slowly reverted back to his domestic expectations when he lived with the Dursleys, he was apologizing because he thought he had genuinely done something bad. “I’m not helpless, Potter. I made myself a sandwich and I rather liked it. You don’t have to be here to cook for me. I can handle myself.” Though he spoke with a serious tone, there was a bit of understanding interlaced with it.
Exactly three days ago, Harry had received an unexpected letter from Lucius Malfoy. He stared at it a solid minute before finally opening it and reading it’s contents. It took precisely four paragraphs for Harry’s entire world to fall apart around him.
His eyes snapped to meet the blue ones before him. “I CAN’T!” His breathing picked up again. He thrashed to get away from Draco, a silent and wandless spell leaked out of him. It was something he had picked up from his studies of the dark arts. He and Draco were both surrounded by a dark purple smoke that had poured from Harry’s hands, protecting them from a nonexistent threat. It was just wispy and sheen enough to let everyone see what was happening inside.
“I am not.”
“My condolences to Hermione.”
Draco grinned, “Precisely.”
Harry crossed his arms, “Of course not! I wasn’t waxing poetic because I want to have sex with you, I was waxing poetic because you’re beautiful!”
“Draco, now that we’ve established we both fancy each other, what do you want to do about this?”
Nearly thirty chapters and he was out of anything to do or say, he had no ending.
Draco spent about half of his time playing with Teddy, and the other half was spent talking with his mother and aunt.
Harry, like the other professors, lived on campus in rooms that were connected to their offices. Harry pulled a robe on over his pajamas and opened his office door to find Teddy standing there with his trademark blue hair, but instead of Remus’ chocolate brown eyes, Harry met teary green ones.
It was just some Yaxley relative, a man that Draco might have seen once or twice. It was almost unsatisfying. He wanted it to be someone he knew, someone he could feel betrayed by, someone he could be angry at, someone he could hate. If his own father could be so terrible then why couldn’t everyone else he’d known? Instead, it was a man that even Lucius admitted to having seldom spoken to. He only kept the man’s identity a secret because he felt as if the attacks were some form of justice. He said the traitors deserved to be revealed, they deserve to be attacked. Even his own son.
Harry mumbled a little more before turning to Draco. “What about you? I know you’ve lost people.”
how good he was doing.
Draco bit his lip, his eyes glued to the moving target before him. Part of him wanted to pounce and jump in tongue-first. But he didn’t. Perhaps, next time.
Even Harry's scar was becoming something to marvel at. It was once red and irritated, but since the war, it's tapered out into white, raised skin that looked more akin to real lightening. It was actually a bit intimidating.
He humped Harry’s sheets like an animal with his nose buried in the pillow.
A few minutes later and Draco falls forward, catching himself on the side of Harry’s bed.
Of course, this made Draco’s mind reel.
He could feel it welling up within himself all over again. A lie of omission. There was something else he wasn’t saying and the serum didn’t like that. He felt the words bubbling up, demanding to be heard. Whether Harry liked it or not, which he didn’t, he had to tell the whole truth.
He bought presents for the Weasley clan and Hermione. He gave them to Hermione so she could bring them with her and Ron to the Weasley house for Christmas. He got Hermione some new journals and notebooks for all her planning to become the next Minister, and he got Ron a training dummy to practice wandless magic on.
Next up was Dive by Ed Sheeran, what Harry considers to be one of his best songs because of the raw vocals. Ed Sheeran’s gorgeous voice serves as a reminder that there’s no way Harry will ever not be attracted to men.
Draco gave a wild smirk as he was in a mix of shock and playfulness. He knew exactly what Harry was doing, and he loved it. “Oh, don’t threaten me, Harry. Need I remind you of all the spells in my arsenal? I have an entire book now. And we have all night to experiment.”
Draco didn’t exactly have a fear of commitment, but he’s seen some very bad relationships. He was scared of what could become. But he also knew this relationship wasn’t like what his parents had. There was no monetary or social gain from being with each other. They were together because they accidentally fell in love, and that was all. The fact comforted him.
Draco only raised an eyebrow. "I think it goes without saying."
“Like all my bones and muscles and insides?”
“I am the head of the House of Malfoy, I make the final decision, and it is already done.” His father’s voice boomed. He wasn’t yelling, but he was visibly angry.
Shortly after the birth of Scorpius, there was a divorce.
He almost didn't want to speak. He was too caught up in watching Draco slowly come unto himself. It was as if he was worried about breaking Draco's concentration. But as the doctor entered, he began to turn his head, and his eyes gently opened.
Harry raised an eyebrow finally looking up, “Wizards use surrogate mothers? I didn’t think you had the technology.”
“Oh, thank you. I don’t know if this is an uncomfortable topic, but, when did you lot die?”
“If you moan like that every morning there’s no way we could ever share a bed.”
“Harder, Draco!” He was doubtless that Draco would obey. He felt good and nothing else mattered. He wanted more and demanded it. He wasn’t asking, or begging, he wasn’t coy or ashamed, he knew what he wanted and he was going to have it no matter what.
Harry walked over and helped Draco up. "You know she just likes you."
He went into the kitchen and set the paper down on the counter harder than he meant to.
Harry ended up going outside for a while. He leaned against his house, basking in the sun and closing his eyes. He took in the warmth and listened to the birds. He took a deep breath and filled his lungs from the suffocating weekend he endured. It was warm and he could breathe. It was a lovely moment, until he remembered his seeds. He went inside and grabbed them along with a glass of water. He poked holes into the ground and put in the flower seeds, giving them each a bit of water. Right in the middle of his garden, he planted the apple tree. He was happy to plant his seeds. Part of him suspected it had to do with the fact that Draco had gotten him the seeds. He greatly appreciated the gesture and felt the satisfaction of forgiveness all over again.
Harry couldn’t disobey a request like that. He moved his hand faster. He played with Draco’s nipple, rubbing and rolling the soft bud until he let his hand wander down further. It brushed down Draco’s abdomen and he was able to feel the trembling muscles beneath Draco’s skin. It made Harry’s own body heat up to
“Are you going try to set them up?”
“I swear when I get out of here I-“ He cut himself off with a shiver when Draco gripped his growing erection. He wanted to move his hips, he wanted to hump Draco’s hand and get himself off. But he didn’t want to give in so easily, either. It was Draco’s birthday and he wanted to play the fantasy for as long as he could.
Wincing, Harry hurried away, letting the door slide closed behind him. He hadn’t meant it in a bad way, though he could see how he’d put his foot in his mouth. Again. Harry sighed as he hurried to catch up with his friends. For some reason, he had had the vague notion that Malfoy might have been better this year.
Harry grimaced. “I’m not going to those,” he declared. “I’d rather battle Voldemort again.”
“More rules and bureaucracy,” Harry said distastefully, ignoring the last comment.
Wordlessly, Ron handed her the instructions. Hermione stared down at it, growing increasingly teary. She handed it to Harry when she noticed him frowning at them. There, at the front, was a picture of a laughing Fred and George, taken at Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Their arms were around each other as they swayed to and fro, eyes bright with mischief and happiness. Underneath, George had put a touching tribute to his twin, mentioning that they had been working on the game for a few months before his death. Harry’s heart clenched and he handed the booklet back to Ron who tucked it tenderly into his pocket.
pretty weird.”
“Yes,” was Malfoy’s only response, clipped and strained.
“C’mon,” Ron mumbled. “We better get inside and get seats.”
Eventually, they found an empty carriage and they stored their trunks before settling in. The brief conversation with Malfoy had reminded Harry that Ron and Hermione were Prefects, too. There wasn't much time for them to be Prefects during the past year. “Do you have to go to the Prefect carriage soon?” he asked, not looking forward to being alone.
It didn’t take long for Hagrid to enter the Great Hall. He looked around, spotted Harry, and waved at him. Harry waved back just as other students began to greet Hagrid, too. It seemed as though they all had a new appreciation for their professor after everything he had done for them during the occupation of Hogwarts and the ensuing battle.
Before he could come to a decision, let alone say anything, the train gave a great heave. The carriage rattled, then began to slowly roll away from Mrs. Weasley. All three of them scrambled to lean out of the window, ignoring the great plume of billowing engine smoke over their heads. Suddenly the train and platform was awash with farewells. Parents waved and students shouted, and the Hogwarts Express slowly picked up speed. Mrs. Weasley smiled as she waved, the tears in her eyes shining in the sunlight.
“Besides,” Ron added, his brow furrowing suddenly. “You won’t be the only one people will be staring at this year, Harry.” He nodded his head at something over Harry’s shoulder and he turned to look.
“Yeah,” Ron replied. “Fancy a game?”
“She might be able to do it herself,” Hermione protested. “She could be more powerful than you realise.”
“Ron!” Hermione chided. “There’s been enough fighting. Let’s go find another carriage.” She turned on her heel and left, nose in the air. Harry and Ron backed out of her way. Ron gave Malfoy the finger and stalked off, head held high. Meanwhile, Harry looked over at Malfoy, head tilted a little.
“Food is a gift,” Ron told her, as if he was reciting something that he’d been told once. Harry thought it was probably something that Mrs. Weasley would say to encourage eating.
“We wanted to say hello,” Luna explained with her usual dreamy smile. “Hello.”
“Forget all that,” said Ron, getting to his feet. He turned to his trunk and stretched to unlatch it. As he rooted around in it, he said, “Let’s have some fun before we get there. I’ve got this new game that Fred and Geo-” Ron stilled and leaned back. Hermione reached out to grab his hand, holding tight. Harry held his breath, his heart aching for him. Memories flashed in front of him - Fred laughing before he died, others lined up in rows in the Great Hall. Finally, Ron took a breath and reached into his trunk again. “I’ve got this new game that George… George made.”
“Anyone who was at the Battle,” Hermione explained, her eyes glued to the closest carriage. Or, more specifically, the creature in front of it. “...will have seen death. They’ll be able to see the thestrals.”
“’Mione!” Ron protested.
As the door slid closed, Harry frowned. Why wasn’t Malfoy with them? Something about the picture seemed wrong and he turned back to his friends. Ginny looked mildly surprised and she shrugged when Harry met her gaze. “That was… different,” she commented.
They made their way into the Great Hall which had been returned to its former glory. Candles floated above their heads, casting their glow on the long tables. The cutlery and plates glinted in the light. Harry made a mental look to find out how the house-elves were doing at some point, though he dreaded talking to Winky in case she was crying again. Above them, the ceiling showed shifting clouds as they skimmed over a star-filled sky. The moon was a thin crescent, a crooked smile to welcome students, new and old.
going to come to ours for Christmas, right?”
“It’s been selling well,” Ron told them. “I mean, all their stuff sells well, and this is new, so people are snapping it up.”
“You’re going to be a great Auror,” added Seamus. “So I reckon you should treat this year like a holiday. Nobody’s going to withhold a N.E.W.T. from you.”
“And, hey,” Ron said when they were discussing it. “You’ll get to spend more time with Ginny.”
That was when the Hall began to whisper and murmur again. Harry felt sorry for poor Sun Jung - he knew what it was like to have everyone in the school looking at you, not because they liked you, but because of something that had happened to you. He had had his share of good and bad whispers, and he knew that it was terribly disheartening to have people judge you on something they didn’t understand.
Harry grimaced. “Hopefully not.”
When the intruders didn’t say anything, Harry raised an eyebrow. “What, lost without your mighty leader?”
Eventually, the line of First Years thinned until they got to the ‘R’s. Sun Jung was still there and Harry was interested to find out where she would be Sorted. He hoped it would be Hufflepuff so that she would remain on the ground floor and not have to find a way up seven flights of stairs - though that wouldn’t solve the problem of getting to classes. He hoped the wheelchair was already magical and would take her where she needed to go. When her name was finally called - “Ryu, Sun Jung” - she rolled herself forward, picked up the Hat and placed it on her head. The Hall went silent. Everyone seemed to be holding their breath. Her face was still set in its determined expression until, suddenly, she smiled, and the Sorting Hat’s mouth opened.
“I heard that some of the Slytherins aren’t coming back this year,” Hermione murmured. “They’ve gone to Durmstrang. That’s why the Board of Governors approved this Eighth Year; they didn’t have to worry about money with so many of them gone.”
Months passed, and the question of the 7th Years’ N.E.W.T.s came around. Should people hire the seventeen and eighteen year olds without qualifications? Or should they be asked to sit the exams? What about those that had missed a lot of their coursework? How would they be able to sit those exams or work on theses if they didn’t have the knowledge? The Board of Governors worked overtime in their debating until, finally, a decision was reached.
Hermione cringed and whacked Ron on the arm. “Ronald!” she hissed.
She spread her arms wide in a welcoming gesture, and that must have been a signal to the house-elves. Before Harry could even start to applaud, the plates and jugs filled with food. The applause was loud - just as loud as for Dumbledore - but short. Muttering became chatter as everyone began to talk at once. Harry absently listened to his friends as he served himself some steak pie with crispy roast potatoes and plenty of gravy.
The door to their carriage slid open and someone stepped inside. Harry and his friends froze, cards in hand. At the same time, Gregory Goyle stopped and stared at them all, pale-faced and horrified. Over his shoulder, Harry could see Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson. Noticeably, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
won’t last long in Ron’s case,” said Hermione with a fond sigh. “Once they see him shoving ten potatoes into his mouth at once.”
“Mum,” Ron whined, his ears a luminous red.
Turning, Harry spotted Hermione and Ron hurrying towards him, their trolleys hovering above the floor behind them for ease of movement. Hermione had her hair tied up into a high ponytail and Ron was red in the face from running to keep up with her. It had been a couple of weeks since Harry had last seen them. At first, they had insisted on keeping him company at Grimmauld place. Then they had returned to the Burrow, though he still saw them during the Hogwarts rebuilding efforts. Before they returned properly, they had gone on a brief holiday, and Harry had had to be completely alone for the first time in memory.
“Still…” said Ron, clearly only affronted on Hermione’s behalf. It was clear that Ron was proud of her and quite pleased to be with her. Harry tried to quash the tiny pang of jealousy while also suppressing the tiny voice that told him that he could have had that with Ginny. Successful, he shrugged when Hermione gave him a long-suffering look.
“I couldn’t go in last week,” Harry said, grimacing at the memory of being practically chased as he tried to do his shopping. “Too many people.”
He shrugged. “At least I still have my money.”
But you will be Sorted to what you value most.
Underneath, Harry spotted names of people who were long dead. His parents. People who had died when Voldemort first came to power. Sirius Black. Mad-Eye Moody. Bathilda Bagshot. Dobby the Free House-Elf. Somehow, their names being here made Harry feel a little better.
Eventually, the platform dwindled into a speck and everyone turned away from the windows. Ron turned to Harry. “You
“Then why’re you looking over there?”
Ginny leaned forward from further down the table. “They kind of did?” she said, shrugging a shoulder. “They left the castle before they had to pick a side and fight.”
Jabbing his wand at his trunk to keep it from floating away, Harry nodded. “Yeah. I did. Though…” Harry grimaced at the memory. “It took me a week to do it - everyone kept wanting to shake my hand or get an autograph…”
“Yeah, the Slytherins totally helped us,” Ron muttered, rolling his eyes.
Which rankled, really. Harry wanted to be out there, bringing in the Death Eaters who had made everyone’s lives hell. He wanted to discover what other plots were afoot and bring people to justice. In fact, he’d really love a job as an Auror. But bureaucracy reigned and Harry didn’t have the requisite N.E.W.T.s to start the job.
“Yeah,” he said, agreeing with Ron’s previous point. “It
Once all of the First Years were settled, the room fell silent. From the side of the head table, McGonagall plucked the three-legged stool and the Sorting Hat. She stepped forward and set them down. When she stepped back, the Hall held its breath, waiting to hear what the Sorting Hat would say this year. After everything, Harry wondered what insights it would try to impart, particularly about the Slytherins.
Luna left them to head to the Ravenclaw table while the rest of them made their way to the Gryffindor one. People were already seated, the Hall half full, and many of them were openly staring at the eight of them as they moved through the Hall. Noise from the Ravenclaw table made Harry glance over. There, fellow Ravenclaws were greeting Luna with more enthusiasm than usual. Harry smiled to himself as the rest of them settled down.
“You-!”
While Luna and Ginny helped Neville clear up, Harry stared at the door, eyes narrowed. Not everything was different; there were still Dark Wizards out there, lurking, waiting for their moment. They might be using people who had already proved their loyalties to Voldemort. Could Malfoy and the others be up to something?
“Hmm… If you’re sure,” Hermione conceded with a worried look.
Looking around, Harry saw that he was right and he felt immensely grateful for him. As the crowd around them began to move towards the train again, Harry let out a sigh of relief. “Thanks. I really hope this doesn’t happen for the whole year.”
The silence hung for a moment. Then, slowly, almost reluctantly, the Sorting Hat’s rim parted to show its mouth. It opened wide, the First Years watching in fascination, and began to sing.
“Well, we did,” said Hermione, though she looked uncomfortable. “In a way.”
“Do you think I don’t know that?” Malfoy spat. “Get out!”
Ron raised an eyebrow. “You sure? ’Cause it’s kind of weird, you staring at him.”
Despite his curiosity - and his suspicions - Harry was distracted by the Great Hall doors being grandly flung open. Headmistress McGonagall strode in, followed by a long line of First Years. They were all looking around in wonder; some of them even stumbled over themselves when they stared for too long at the ceiling. At the back of the line, there was a gap. A murmuring started and Harry leaned forward to work out what was happening.

“Um,” said Harry, startled. He abruptly remembered the Christmas before when he and Hermione had been in Godric’s Hollow. They had been without Ron, though he had been at home for Christmas - Mrs. Weasley must have been extremely worried about Harry and Hermione for the entirety of the holiday. Guilt made Harry want to accept, but nostalgia for that first Christmas at Hogwarts resulted in his hesitation.
That was how their days usually went. Whenever they were in the room at the same time they would have a quick conversation and that was it. Then Draco would go back to reading and Harry would go back to whatever he had been doing before.
“And you’re a right bastard. Always getting into trouble. Clever and wily, you are.” Dean said back.
Harry gave a small smile before putting another candy in his mouth and staring at the floor. He did feel a bit better with Draco’s joking, but it was still a bit of a rough day for him. Of course, he wasn’t as upset as he used to be, but reading his mother’s journal put a lot into perspective for him.
If possible, Harry’s eyes would have widened even more. “On the Astronomy Tower?!”
Harry rolled his eyes and let Narcissa dominate the conversation with Draco. He'd seen her nearly fall apart over him and didn't want to interrupt. He didn't feel ignored or anything of that sort, he simply recognized that he had all the time in the world since they lived together. But Narcissa needed right now.
“I want to talk.”
Of course, they let him sit. In reality, the booth could fit maybe eight people, but it was only ever the three of them.
The boys didn’t say anything after that.
After talking a bit more, she mentioned that there would be another article printed that Harry was in. A list of desirable bachelors. Now this was something Draco could use to tease Harry, but he had to figure out how to bring the article up around Harry.
Draco hesitated, but shook his hand. His own soft and pale in contrast to the tan and callused one. “Right. And you ran off to be a dragonologist. You seem to be doing well. I assume you and all the dragons get along, then?”
"Don't be. Is this alright?" Draco asked, ready to move his hand away if that's what Harry wanted.
Draco couldn’t refuse such a command. He pressed his face against Harry and shoved his tongue in. He felt how relaxed Harry had become. Though the rest of his body was tense and trembling against the pleasure, his hole had become slack and open. He pulled his tongue away and cast a spell that Harry had become terribly familiar with.
“While I’m here?”
It took only a moment and Draco had found the spot inside of Harry that made him writhe. His other hand slipped to caress the stream of precum that leaked from Harry’s tip.
He was embarrassed by the way a slow-moving thumb could have him keening in pleasure. But he couldn’t stop himself from rolling his hips and trying to take more. He was desperate. But he trusted Draco, he trusted him so much, and allowed himself to be at the other’s mercy.
Draco stretched out his back and his fingers curled up. He twisted a bit and felt himself slowly be pulled from his sleep. He let out a sigh that turned into a soft moan as his eyes began to open. He saw the familiar batch of wild dark hair and squirmed. “Harry, you really shouldn’t wake me up like this unless you’ve decided you’re done being a virgin.”
Harry shifted again, unaware of how seductive the movements of his arse looked to the boy behind him.
Harry’s face went red yet again and he quickly walked over to his bed. “Really, Draco?”
When break ended and everyone came back to Hogwarts, it felt like their time together had been ruined by everyone else. They just wanted to be alone together.
No more war or evil threats, just hope for something better to come.
“It’ll be mad working here and seeing your kids come through. Teaching them. Do you think they would be anything like us?” Harry asked.
“Well, I suppose it started on Friday, when the thing with the Black properties happened.” That got a nod from Ron and Hermione, who knew about the situation in general, although they were unaware of what happened afterwards.
Harry was silent a moment before relenting, “How could you tell?”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, wondering if it had anything to do with the fact that he saw himself in a version of King’s Cross Station. Was he to get on a train when he really died? He wondered where it might take him and who might be there waiting for him.
The added pleasure made Harry lift up his hips, trying to find any semblance of friction. It only added to his exasperation and he squirmed yet again when he found none. "Draco," He sighed out the name and the rest of his sentence came out as a whine, "I need more. Please?"
After the first few months their conversations shifted, instead of discussing their losses and sadness, they started to discuss the future. The future was all they had left.
The first time Teddy referred to Harry as his dad, he nearly had a panic attack. Teddy grew up calling Draco “pére”, so Scorpius copied, knowing it was French for father. But when he turned to Harry with his big blue eyes and called him dad, Harry had to excuse himself to go cry.
“We’re already married. We might as well be on a first name basis.” He pointed out as he started copying down the seventh page. He’d covered almost a meter of parchment paper, which wasn’t terrible considering his handwriting was small.
“Do you mean to tell me these lights are ugly?”
Now, they were so used to just being friends that they were scared to take the next step forward. Again they were complacent with what they had and where they were. They figured it was better to be friends than suffer rejection and ruin what they had. Especially now that the war was over, after all they been through, after all they lost, and how they’d grown together. They figured it was better to just take what they still had.
Draco saw the legislation as a source of hope. He wanted to use it to get his own father taken care of. He brought up the idea to Pansy, who sadly shot it down. It was illegal for him to be an abuser, but until this new department was formed, the law could not be enforced.
“Alright. I’ll do it.”
“It’s even worse at meals.” Ron piped in, “I once saw them feeding each other and giggling. It was so cute and disgusting. They put me through hell.”
Dean is caring and brave, but dark rooms make him panic and forget where he is. It reminds him too much of the dungeon in Malfoy Manor. He was so certain he would die there.
Seamus glanced at the necklace and commented, “Your dad must of been a real charmer getting your mum a necklace like that.”
He sat down with his hot chocolate and curled up a bit on the couch, laying a blanket over himself as he watched the snow start to fall outside. He listened to the music, took in the decorated sitting room, snuggled under the blanket, and sipped his his cocoa. Everything felt so picturesque and perfect. Never in his life has one moment felt so right, but everything in that one moment was so good. He smiled and closed his eyes, drinking in the feeling of everything being okay. Part of him was worried that the feeling wouldn't last, that something else would come after Harry and himself. A small frown took over and he cast his doubts aside, wanting to photograph this moment, these feelings, and keep them locked in his mind forever.
Harry quickly assessed himself and made his body relax. “Uh, no. Not really. I just, well, I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable because holidays are really ..... domestic.”
“Nice, isn’t it? It’s made of vicuna; warmest, softest, most expensive fabric in the world.” He said it in a bit of a bragging tone, as if he was immensely proud of what he had bought for Harry.
"Sod off, my characters are going on an unofficial date."
She nodded. “We’ve exchanged a few letters. She can’t write much, as you know.” Draco understood what she was implying. She couldn’t write much because of his father. “But we’ve met up once. She even-“ Andromeda was cut off by a knock at the door.
“Of course I am. They’re out of excuses. What is it, twentieth of September? I’ll have them together before Halloween.”
“I asked if you were alright.” He set down the candy in his free hand and focused on the other.
“Harry, we don’t have to do this if you don’t want to. It’s okay.” He wanted Harry to be comfortable with everything they did.
Draco decided he would eventually go shopping to buy the rest of the gay romances from the bookshop that carried them. He was desperate for something new but he knew not to expect much. He was looking into a topic that was very niche to the society he grew up in, but new books were being worked on and one of his favorite authors was about to begin a new series of romances.
Lucius Malfoy was already being questioned about the attacks, but now, they'll be able to properly charge him for blackmail, as he had blackmailed Harry into the marriage. Thankfully, the article also mentioned that if given the option, they would not divorce. It wasn't the most logical decision for them to have made but it was the one that felt right.
Harry looked uncomfortable for a moment. “I-Is it normal to be quiet?”
"So you haven't told him or his friends that we're together?"
He smiled when he saw the familiar greeting by Prongs, Padfoot, and Moony.
Seamus grinned. "That's perfect! Maybe they could meet up at a charity event and their shared interest is what get's them talking." He knew Draco would know a bit about that as charity events were just another type of social gathering for politicians and the rich.
“If these lights are your standard, then yes. They’ll look excellent.”
“Mostly, yea. I’ve learned to make out words, but everything’s just a bit blurry. I can’t see in complete detail.” He looked around for an example. “Like that throw pillow over there.” He pointed to the one beside Draco. It was light blue but had very small dark blue dots. “It’s spotted, yea? The spots are too small for me to see. I only know it’s spotted because Hermione told me. I assume the spots are some shade of blue, similar colors can make it harder for me to make out details.”
Harry looked down at the dumb plum robes he was still wearing and nodded. "Didn't have time to change." Sounded much more professional than confessing that he was too busy cuddling with his unofficial boyfriend.
Harry paused a moment, almost impressed. Very few people recognized his bullshit, even less called him out on it. His shoulders slumped and he took a deep breath. “This is what I know, Draco. I know how to take care of people and situations, it’s what I do, it’s what I’ve always done.” He figured there was no point in bullshitting his way out of this one, so he decided to be honest. “I don’t know what else to do.” He looked off for a moment and a grin spread across his face. “Remember in third year, that one Quidditch match where I nearly knocked you off your broom? I actually felt a bit bad about it. I didn’t mean to almost make you fall. But then you opened your big mouth and called me a prat. Didn’t feel so bad anymore.”
“I don’t know. Taking my virginity?”
Narcissa let out a sigh. “Fine. But it’s getting late, go ahead and stay the night.”
Teddy babbled along, introducing himself.
"Honestly, I just want to ride him. I think that's how I would try to do it our first time."
There was a moment of silence as Draco understood what Harry was saying. “Harry, you don’t have to be in control all the time. The world rested on your shoulders for long enough. Relax, give in.”
“Draco, what did you do?”
“Yea, she’s a bit aggressive, but that’s what makes her good. She gets in your face till you back down. She intimidates people into forgetting about the game and moving out of her way. One of our strongest players.” Harry agreed.
Seamus couldn't help but to grin, "Oh, there was a lot he didn't expect. But the one thing I wish he had known was that since he had never done it before, and since I hadn't in a while, sometimes the person on the receiving end can take a bit longer to finish. But now, we know what to do and I usually cum first."
He was pulled from the imaginary world and forced to stare down at the plate that he now realized was empty. He glanced up at Harry before going back to his book, but did a quick double-take at what he saw.
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?” Draco was a bit thrown, though he appreciated the concern.
Harry let a the corners of his mouth raise into a smile. "I'd never make it anywhere without you." He turned to face her and felt himself getting a bit excited. He always loved when Hermione had an idea. "What are you thinking?"
“Yes! Oh, I’m close! Draco, please, come on.” He groaned and tugged at the blonde hair in his hand, listening to the beautiful whines that sounded off above him.
As exciting as it was to look at the house with Harry, Draco was still a bit unsure about Harry's intentions. He wondered about it on their way home, but didn’t say anything until they returned to Hogwarts.
With their plan set, they prepared for the next day.
“Yes.”
“Mockery is the sincerest form of flattery.”
Dean looked over and let out a whistle, soft enough so only Harry noticed. Harry looked over and his eyes immediately went to Draco’s bum. He had never really noticed before, but it was pretty cute. Of course it wasn’t big or very plump, it was more of a soft curve. But his pants fit it so well, it was difficult not to get distracted.
Draco felt a tear fall from his face. “Thank you.” He paused a moment. “I assume you’ve heard about my situation, then?”
Harry’s face went dark red at the comment, much to Draco’s pride. But there was no time to celebrate as the three fingers inside himself were completely comfortable and felt great. He pulled his hand away and cast the spell again. A brief confusion was quickly replaced by surprise on Harry’s face when Draco lifted up and began to stroke him.
Draco felt a warmth embrace his body and he smiled at the strange ruggedness of the man. It was very easily because of his stubble, ability to start fires, and the fact that he was stronger than Draco. Something about it all felt so different from the primmer boys that Draco was used to, they would never look like this or do the things Harry could. Something about it was strangely exotic to him, and that was exciting, but he was just familiar enough that the blonde was still comfortable.
Oh. Well that explained it.
“I’m not surprised. You ought to do what you’re good at, and you happen to enjoy it. I’m also not surprised you have the desire to work. You don’t have to, but I always knew you would. You’re too driven to sit around all day.”
They returned to Hogwarts late at night and covered in soot. It was mostly Harry who got coated since he wanted to do all the melting to help him with his arm, and he was covered in more soot than usual due to their larger than normal amount of metals to melt.
Harry looked up to see Dean and Seamus sitting off to the side, eating candy. He walked over to them with an awkward smile.
"No, no you didn't." She said as she sat beside him on the sofa. "You never pay attention to the names of reporters and I know you don't because I always tell you to pay attention so you''ll know who to avoid, but you never do."
“You are. Last year everyone thought the job was cursed. Believe me, no one wants it.”
He looked up at Draco and struggled to catch his breath. Once he did, he was met with Draco’s satisfied expression. “I-I’ve made a mess.” He commented lamely.
He finally caught his breath and Draco was still in shock. Harry was so beautiful, loud, and helpless when he was wrapped in an overwhelming pleasure like that. Draco would do anything to see it again. “You humped my leg.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked.
Harry felt a bit cozier than usual. He had the urge to curl up right there and call it a night, but part of him thought that was ridiculous because Draco's presence blocked half the sofa. Naturally, his first thought to remedy that issue was to curl up
“She lets me brew medicines and treat students all on my own. I’ve gotten much farther much faster than other apprentices.” His face lit up and his pitch raised a bit. It was obvious that he got excited just by talking about it.
His hand started up again, jabbing the fingernails of his left hand into it's own palm as his right was covered by Draco's. His mind lurched into his childhood. "The Dursleys told me I was lucky to have a family. I couldn't ruin what I had." He felt helpless and frustrated. "I knew how to deal with them, I knew how to survive, but what if I left and ended up somewhere worse? It was a risk I couldn't take. I tried to make myself unnoticeable, but every once in a while, a professor would ask, I'd protect them, and then I'd go home, terrified of what they would do to me for being noticed." He let out a weak laugh. "But the day that I left, I said to myself, anywhere is better than here. Strange, how things change."
Harry felt a small rush of pride at his breakthrough before he had to quickly put his hands up to defend himself from the blonde that had jumped on top of him.
Harry shuddered at the low voice that was so close to his ear. “Do it.” He didn’t ask, command, or dare. He tempted.
Harry and Hermione also figured out a little system for making money. Twice a month they melt 10,000 Galleons each, exchange it at pawn shops for cheap silver, melt and mint it into Sickles, and trade it for Galleons. They usually triple their profit, sometimes a bit over, but they doubt it’ll ever quadruple.
