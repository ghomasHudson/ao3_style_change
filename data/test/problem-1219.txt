“I didn’t know that you could cook.”
Harry sighs. “Did I? Fuck, I’m sorry.”
Harry does. He gives everything he has left in himself.
Harry, for once, enjoys his special status. The man thanks Merlin and all the stars in this world for getting him out of the lesson that quickly. He grabs his bag and his cloak and rushes out of the classroom, ignoring Ron’s frowning stare and forgetting the piece of paper on the desk.
When they're out for lunch together, she looks up from her menu and gives Draco a weird look - a mix between a smirk and a frown. "You're glowing."
Draco nods and blushes. “That’s right.”
* * *
Hermione shakes her head, clearly wanting to argue with Harry, but he’s not having it.
* * *
“Yeah. Sweet, little creatures who eat sunlight.”
Draco sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. "This whole situation is messed up."
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut and the hand around Harry’s waist begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m -“
He feels steady hands rush forward, holding him by the waist, and keeping him steady. “Easy, easy, Potter.”
With strong hands, he begins to massage the oil onto the soft skin of Harry's back. Harry moans with each stroke, squirming underneath Draco's touch.
“I haven’t decided yet. Since everyone is going home, I don’t really see why I should stay.”
Harry grins. “Alright then.”
“Yeah. It’s lovely so far. But speaking of Christmas. You know what?”, Draco says as he sips on his glass of wine and turns another page of his book.
“Nox”, Draco whispers. The light immediately goes off, leaving them both in darkness.
Draco lets it all happen. He moans happily, adjusts to Harry’s wild pace, and runs his hands through his black hair.
Harry smiles. “Deal.”
“Oh,” Harry states. His heart does not react to this. At all. It’s totally fine. He’s – yeah. “Okay.”
Harry smiles. “You still need to open the present!”
Neville hugs him quickly and then walks straight up to Harry. "Harry! So nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you and I just wanted to tell you how impressed I am that you figured Draco out so quickly and managed to get him out of his comfort zone."
"How?", Harry asks like a cute little puppy feeling lost.
Harry smiles. He tenses his body, trying his hardest to think about anything else. He should not be thinking about how badly he wants to kiss Draco, how good the other man smells, how soft his hair looks, and how pale his skin is. Harry clears his throat. He nods and continues eating his bowl of spaghetti. Once they’re done eating and cleaned everything, Harry drops onto the sofa again.
He doesn’t notice the way his friends exchange curious glances.
Or they are terrified of him. They wouldn’t look twice at him because they don’t know how to act around the Oh-So-Famous-Mr-Potter. Some of them are actually running away the moment Harry walks past them. Or they squeak loudly and point at him as if he's a big attraction. It's insane.
Harry tilts his head and waits for Draco to speak up. He can’t help but feel nervous.
“Sure, okay.”
“This was probably the best idea we’ve ever had.”
“God, I
Draco nods. “Yeah, pretty much. History was my favourite subject. It was clear to me that I would study it at the university. Then my professor suggested I should do my doctorate. So I did.”
The reply comes just as fast.
Harry shivers. He can only see the outlines of Draco now. His grey eyes shimmer in the dark light. They’re so close, Harry can feel Draco’s warmth and his breath on his lips. His heart beats so fast, it almost hurts in his chest.
He quickly realizes that the other students either adore him and literally try everything to get with him. It is actually pathetic, and a tiny bit scary how desperate and thirsty for him some of the people are.
. He tells himself he organises something great for the students because he wants to share his knowledge and give them the opportunity to experience history in a different way.
Harry rolls his eyes and grins. “Okay, go on then.”
He doesn’t move, too scared to wake Draco up. What would Draco say? What would he do? Will he avoid Harry from now on? Will he act differently? So many questions are running through his head while images of last night haunt his mind. Merlin, how is he ever going to --
Hopefully not.
Harry’s head spins. The alcohol stops him from thinking straight. “Why would you kiss someone just because some random guy asked for my number?”
A week later it turns out all of his worries were useless. Over 160 students signed up for the trip.
Harry lets out a moan himself. Merlin, this is so much hotter than he had anticipated. Who would’ve thought that Draco Malfoy, out of all people, would go crazy for Harry’s cock?
“That’s fine”, he says. “I’m Ron. Harry’s roommate.”
“Ready?”, Harry asks and holds out his arm. Draco wraps his arm around him and nods.
“Harry, are you struggling with a drug addiction?” Neville asks, his eyes wide open. He genuinely seems shocked.
"I hate to say this", Draco eventually speaks up "but I need your help with this. I need to put exactly 2 mg of powder into the cauldron but my hands are shaking."
“What’s your type? Come on, tell me!”, Harry whines. He doesn't know
Harry shakes his head. “Nah. I don’t really know. I’m not in the mood.”
well. But I also make hair potions for Blaise, Pansy, Longbottom, and a few others. They’re always happy with the results.”
Harry shakes his head. He’s barely even prepared him. “No. Don’t want to hurt you.”
“Oh fuck”, Draco moans at the sight of Harry’s cum all over Draco’s dick. He comes seconds after.
Harry does. He gives everything he has left in himself. If he weren't in good shape from all the Quidditch Training, he wouldn’t have survived this.
Draco glares at his best friend. “I said no more talking. Let’s eat now.”
Draco stares at the man in awe one more time. Then, he turns around and walks home with shaky hands and a thousand thoughts racing through his mind.
“Me neither”, Harry agrees.
Harry bites down onto Draco’s skin as he continues to slam into Draco. “Fuck, Draco feels so good. You’re so hot, fuck.”
Harry’s heart speeds up as he feels Malfoy’s eyes watching him. Harry licks his lips. “I don’t think you're trouble.”
“No”, Draco repeats. “I’m fine. Promise.”
This time, it’s Draco who surges forward. He surprises Harry by pressing his lips on top of Harry’s and by kissing him passionately. Harry lets it happen. He enjoys letting go and allowing Draco to take the lead for once. It’s exactly what his nervous mind and tense body need right now. He sighs into Draco’s mouth and melts like butter in Draco’s firm hands.
Harry grins and begins to press soft kisses onto Draco's jaw. "You, naked, with me in your bed."
Harry runs his hand through his slick hair and jumps in surprise when he feels hands around his waist all of a sudden.
They're bruises of pleasure, after all."
Draco sighs. "Alright."
He bites Harry’s lip and digs his nails into Harry’s skin causing him to moan even more. “Draco.”
and hurt!”
When Harry and Draco sitting in the library, both studying or doing homework, they sit so close, Harry would only have to move an inch or two and their arms would be touching. He bites his tongue and stops himself from shifting closer to Draco.
“What?” she says. “He is a great kisser. That’s all.”
Harry nods. “Yeah, I guess. But we’re not friends. Like, not at all.”
“Marzipan?”, Harry giggles.
Harry nods. “I know.”
Harry hurries up, conjures some lube onto his dick and carefully places himself on top of Draco.
Draco places himself in front of Harry’s entrance and teases him with the tip of his dick. He lets it slide across Harry’s entrance a couple of times without actually pushing in.
Harry feels his throat tingle. He wishes he could suppress what he’s going to say next, but he can’t. “I want to cry,” he replies.
Draco glares at her in disbelief. "Mum, have you not heard? He's my student!"
Therefore, Harry grabs Draco’s waist, squeezes it tight for support and wriggles his way to the seat next to the window.
Harry pushes Draco’s arse up higher. He needs better access.
through them. He can touch his butt, he grabs both of Harry’s cheeks and makes the boy moan into his mouth.
“Because we agreed that we wouldn’t fall for each other. We agreed on this
Harry nods. He grins. “I see. I didn’t know you had an illegal deal with Longbottom.”
Draco nods. "I felt like suffocating brewing that stupid potion for you."
They kiss for a while, hands exploring each other’s bodies. Every now and then, Draco’s hand brushes over Harry’s dick, sending sparks through his body. Harry bites into Draco’s lip and reinforces his grip on Draco’s biceps.
"I'm right here, babe", Draco responds and begins to rub his hands all over Harry's body. "Not going anywhere."
Harry takes a deep breath. “Do you want to repeat last week?”
“Then fight for him,” Hermione replies and she makes it sound so easy. “Apparate to his place and tell him you love him.”
Harry blinks in surprise and feels as if somebody had woken him up from a dream. He clears his throat and gets up – too quickly. All of a sudden, he feels dizzy and for a few seconds, his vision turns black.
Harry opens up on his knees, giving Draco better access to his arse.
Harry gulps. Draco is right. He’s actually saying out loud what Harry has been thinking. “Yeah. That’s true. But I had felt that the lines were starting to blur way before that anyway. And we already agreed that we don’t find each other ugly. So, it didn’t really take me by surprise.”
Harry hums in agreement. For a split second, he considers asking Draco if he wants to stay with him at Hogwarts. Just the two of them. But then, he bites his tongue and swallows the question.
The next week is long and nerve-wracking. School is taking a toll on him. He doesn’t eat much, he sleeps a lot, and he basically hides away from the world. Since he’s trying to avoid as many fan-encounters as possible, he spends a lot of time by himself. He doesn’t really feel like hanging out with his friends anyway.
cum so hard in my life.”
Draco nods. “I need a cig anyway. Do you want to come with me?”
Harry frowns and lifts his head, but Draco’s hand snaps up and pushes him back down. “What?”
“It doesn’t matter if I’m bisexual or not. I’m not interested in you, so fuck off.”
“Harry!” Draco giggles and tries to get away from him. “We’re both dirty and sweaty.”
Harry’s heart swells at the sight of the tiny thing. He conjures some cheese and very softly moves closer to the animal.
“I guess I’m not the tough guy. I care about other people’s opinions. I worry about not looking good or not being popular. All I really want is to let go of all that. I want - I
Ron sighs and runs a hand through his red strands. “Merlin, Harry. I don’t really know what to say. I’ve been watching you and Draco for the past few months and it’s almost like watching two cars crashing into each other. I keep waiting for this whole thing to blow up in your faces.”
“And?”, Harry whispers, his eyes full of hope.
Harry shrugs. “Yeah.”
“They either throw themselves at you, or they are mortified by you,” Harry explains.
“But why would you stop?”, Ron almost shouts frustrated. “I don’t get it. You were both so happy. Why don’t you just date?”
Harry chuckles. “Well, they must be very athletic if they can jump up so high.”
Harry is beautiful, no one would ever disagree with Draco. His eyes are glowing dark green, his hair is a wild chaos on top of his head, his jaw is sharp like a knife and his lashes throw a beautiful shadow on his high collarbones. The glasses make him look cute, younger, and softer.
Draco tilts his head. “What exactly is a movie?”
“Guys!” Dean and Blaise shout as they step closer to the couch. “We’re playing Truth or Dare. Come on, no one is backing out. Everybody has to play.”
Draco frowns. “What do you mean?”
“The house Mother bought is currently being renovated. It’ll probably be ready in August.”
Draco furiously shakes his head. “Merlin, no! Please, do anything, but not the hospital wing!”
Draco stares back at Harry. “What?”
Draco doesn’t know what to do. This feels like Harry is asking him out on a date and Draco can’t deal with that. He can’t fall even more for the boy than he already
Neville slaps his own head. “For fuck's sake! I’m totally with Harry now. He did the right thing, the smart thing, you know? You would’ve kept this facade of tiptoeing around each other up for years, probably. I understand why he had to stop this.”
Draco manages to get through his lecture pretty well, the boy with the emerald green eyes is almost forgotten.
Draco hesitates. He seems more tense than before. Eventually he points towards a tiny, brown bowl on the left. "Hm. Yeah, you can cut this Bats' spleens."
Draco grabs it thankfully and nods. “Thank you, Ron!”
Harry only nods and grabs Draco’s waist as he slams into him. “I know, me too.”
When Friday finally comes rolling around, his friends are all motivated to go to the Leaky Cauldron again.
At this point, he wishes he could just forget everything. The good thing is, he doesn’t see Draco often. They don’t have that many classes together, and there’s no reason to go and look for each other anyway. They’re not friends. The bad thing is, Harry
“Huh”, Draco answers and frowns. “Hm. So, you’re saying that you
"Alright, students!", Professor Slughorn shouts "that's it for today's lesson. You may leave."
Harry bites his nail anxiously and watches Draco staring at the cake. Oh god. This was a stupid idea. Harry should’ve just let it be. He overstepped the line. He knew he would ruin their fresh friendship at some point.
"I love you", Harry whispers.
“Then why would you say that everything’s ruined?”
“Don’t what?”, Draco asks, his eyes flicker unsure between Harry’s eyes and their hands.
Neville nods. “Yeah. Yeah, of course. Come in, come in.”
Then, she hands him a glass filled with blue liquid. “Drink up.”
Neville sighs. „Alright, I’ll come with you. But don‘t lie to me again saying that this trip isn’t about Harry.“
Draco's mouth falls open and he squeezes his eyes shut.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco smiles. “Me too.”
“Why’s that?”
Ron grins and shakes his head. “No, Harry. Not just a habit. You usually don’t even shower before going out to get laid. This is new.”
“Um”, Draco says. He thinks for a moment. “Probably lemon cake?”
“Potential mate”, Harry repeats dumbfounded.
Harry nods. “Yeah. The heat made me dizzy.”
When the group eventually heads to their dorms, Harry desperately doesn’t want their first evening back at Hogwarts to end just yet.
Harry opens the door to the passenger seat of the car. Draco sits down and moves the seat all the way to the back. It’s more spacious than Draco had thought it would be.
“Muggles watch TV, because it’s amusing to watch. As I said, it’s almost like reading a book. But it’s much easier and faster because you see everything in vivid images and colors and sounds in front of you.”
Draco doesn't know which group he should go up with. When he spots Harry, Hermione, her boyfriend and a girl with light blonde hair and another girl with bright red hair, he hesitates at first. But he really wants to be close to Harry and maybe ask him what's wrong.
“No. Let’s just say it’s strong alcohol.”
Draco’s head snaps around, the moment Harry’s fingers comb through his hair. Harry pulls back slowly. The blonde man watches Harry with an unreadable expression. Then, he slowly answers. “This is its natural state. I usually spend a lot of time to style them. I don’t really like it natural.”
“Why not? Just think about it for a sec. You are horny, but you don’t want to fuck just anyone here at Hogwarts. I’m horny, but I
* * *
“Ronald!”, Hermione hisses and punches Ron in the stomach. “What Ron is trying to say is, we’re all worried about you. We don’t want you to get hurt.”
When Harry is sitting at lunch the other day, a young boy comes up to him. Harry feels incredibly awkward when he asks for a photograph.
Draco frowns. “Aren’t you happy with what you’re doing right now?“
Harry bites his lip and ignores that comment. He doesn’t fancy Draco, ok? Like, not at all. But he’s interested in him as a person. They’ve been enemies for so long, and maybe it’s time to put that all aside and start fresh. And if that means fucking their brains out, he’s okay with that. Because Draco smells amazing, he has an incredible body, the softest hair Harry has ever touched, and a lovely smile. He brings him breakfast and he knows how to push Harry’s buttons. Merlin. Harry needs to stop thinking
“I need some fresh air.”
"I'm happy you agreed to this. Thank you", Harry whispers and leans his head back to kiss Draco on the mouth.
They cast a cleaning spell and eventually get dressed. Draco’s and Harry’s hair is a mess, their cheeks are rosy, and they look way too happy. All of their friends will know what they did, but they don’t care.
Harry shakes his head. “When they behave like this? Never.”
“So”, Harry asks. “this isn’t too much?”
over again?”
At first, Harry chuckles. Then, he realizes what this means. Harry’s heart rate speeds up. Draco wants to see him - Right now! He has no idea how he’s supposed to get out of this lesson, but he has no options here. His entire body craves Draco. He needs to see him, no matter what.
didn’t even notice it. How did you notice?!”
“Ginny!”, Hermione gasps, while Ron, Dean, and Seamus give the redhead a high five.
He drives out of the parking lot and just around the corner when he sees someone standing in the rain at the bus stop.
Harry takes a nervous drag off his cigarette. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
“Oh my god, fuck!” Draco cries, and then, finally, he sinks onto the mattress, into Harry’s firm hug, and relaxes.
“I missed hanging out with you”, Harry admits.
He decides to call him then. But Harry doesn’t pick up the phone. He texts him that he needs to see Harry. But Harry doesn’t respond.
Harry unlocks the door and grabs Draco's arm. "Let's go."
“Well,
Draco presses a kiss to Harry’s hand. “I’ll miss you too, Harry. You have no idea how much I’ll miss you.”
because he cares about Draco Malfoy. Definitely not. When he spots the blonde man in the crowd, Harry immediately notices that Draco looks even paler than before and now he’s hunched over in pain.
Harry exhales. “I’m not worrying.”
“Please, Harry. I need so much more than that. I need to feel you inside me! I need you to fill me up, need your cock inside my arse”, Draco groans.
"Harry", Draco sighs and lets his head fall back. "This is so wrong."
The holidays are actually rolling around much quicker than Harry had thought. The two weeks go by and Harry actually is starting to feel nervous now. Ever since realizing that he’s actually falling in love with Draco, he worries that Draco might actually realize it too. He might call Harry out on his bullshit or worse. He might be disgusted and angry with him and cancel their friendship.
So Harry does. Slowly, he pushes into Draco, again and again.
Harry shakes himself, shaking those thoughts of Draco's hands on his body off his mind, far far away.
Harry nods. “Yeah. You’re right. Are you staying with me for the night?”
Harry’s face breaks into a huge grin. “Fuck, yes.”
Harry can’t think straight anymore. The heat, Draco’s groans, his soft skin, it’s all too much and not enough at the same time. Harry speeds up the pace, moving in and out of Draco so easily, he thinks their bodies must be perfect for each other. Sex has never felt so good.
The others hum in agreement. Harry’s head spins. It’s probably just the alcohol. The others chat about attractive guys and girls for a while, but Harry doesn’t really focus anymore. He thinks about silver-blonde hair, grey eyes, and long, slim legs.
Harry smiles relieved. This is actually going much better than he had thought.
The door opens, but it’s not Harry who opens it. It’s his ginger friend.
Harry starts to beam and his eyes sparkle. "Thank you, Draco! This helped me so much!"
Draco laughs again, still no humor behind it. It almost sounds bitter. “I was
He blushes. “Are you in love with me?” Harry asks. He needs to hear it again. His heart his hammering inside his chest.
Draco tilts his head. “Like what?”
Draco shakes his head. "When I'm in a relationship. But currently I'm not in a relationship. So I'm not cuddling anyone at the moment."
"Sorry", Draco clears his throat "I didn't mean to."
Harry sighs. He gets up, his legs are shaking. He’s never felt more nervous in his entire life. Without turning back to check whether Draco is following him or not, he moves towards the bathroom. When he pushes the door open, he realizes how small it actually is. Oh, Merlin. This isn’t going to end well.
“He’s here”, Ron finally says. “Pansy told Hermione they would come.”
Harry opens his eyes. "What?"
“Did you sleep well?”
Then, the student nods and smiles at Draco timidly. The boy grabs his bag and his coat and rushes out of the hall leaving Draco to himself.
Draco opens his legs even further, allowing Harry to slip inside even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Harry frowns. The gondola rises up in the air. “Know what?”
Draco squirms underneath him. Harry’s hands go lower and lower. Eventually, he grabs Draco’s arse cheeks with both his hands and begins to massage them. He kneads them thoroughly, spreads them apart, and strokes Draco’s hole every now and then with his fingers.
He continues to suck him until Draco painfully pulls on Harry’s hair. “Stop. Stop. I’m about to cum.”
He hasn’t told any of his friends about Draco. But they know him and Harry couldn’t lie to them anyway. So, he explained that he had a date with a special someone. He didn’t want to drop the name, and they had accepted it.
“Are you? Horny, I mean?”
Neville and Harry enter the small room. “Don’t tell Molly. But I brought my favorite new plant to the Burrow. The Hexophelitantrum. But she’s being a tiny bit … bitchy.”
Draco looks up surprised. He still has 17 more minutes until students are supposed to come in.
Then, he rubs Harry's entry, spreading the oil carefully. Harry sighs. Slowly, he enters one finger into Harry's tight hole.
The boy stopped attending his lectures. He simply stopped coming. Draco knows he can’t blame him. He’d probably not show up too if he was in Harry’s position.
Harry watches him deeply lost in his thoughts. "So if I weren't your student, you'd hook up with me?"
Draco licks his lips opening the door for the two of them. "Do you now?"
“Fuck, yes,” Draco moans. Harry can tell that he’s close too. They’re both so sensitive to each other’s touch.
Harry nods. “Okay.”
Harry grabs Draco’s arm and guides him out of the museum.
“Okay? Tell me if it’s too much, babe.”
“You’re my
“Thanks for helping me out. I was in a lot of pain.”
“Yeah, see you on Tuesday”, Draco dumbly answers and waves awkwardly. How is he an academically respected professor? He can't even hold a normal conversation with a student.
“So, you just confirmed that I match your type. But you don’t find me attractive,” Harry eventually repeats.
“You need to loosen up. It’s not exactly illegal. I’m only visiting one of your lectures this semester and I don’t even have to write an essay or something. You don’t
"I'm just telling you the truth. I'd give it a try."
Harry shakes his head but doesn’t explain further.
Draco’s confused during the first ten minutes. But then, he gets the hang of it. He stares at the screen in utter fascination and admiration and every time Harry tries to say something, Draco punches his arm.
“Don’t”, Draco simply states, not even looking up.
He doesn’t look at Harry again.
“Let me show you”, Harry replies and begins cutting the zucchini in half. “Just like that. Here, go on. Try it.”
“Yeah. I really don’t fancy the idea of spending Christmas with distant relatives I don’t even know that well.”
Harry smiles. “I’m glad we moved on. And honestly, it’s not even that odd. We actually have quite a few things in common. It just works between us, you know?”
Draco shakes his head and blows out the smoke he had just inhaled. “Not your fault. It’s entirely my own.”
When did that happen? When did he get so fond of Malfoy, Draco fucking Malfoy out of all people, to a point where he starts to miss him after a few days? It’s getting more and more real for Harry every single day. He’s beginning to realize that he can’t blame Armortentia forever. Eventually, he’ll have to admit that he’s growing very fond of Draco. Eventually, he’ll have to start thinking about what this all means. He probably should’ve done that way sooner.
Harry feels exhausted all of a sudden. This whole conversation blew his mind, and he feels absolutely lost.
Harry nods. “See? I knew you wouldn’t say or do something. I
Harry presses his lips together and watches the beautiful man in front of him. A thousand thoughts run through his mind.
“Draco, I have to hear it again.”
Harry turns his head around and watches Draco surprised. The other boy is bright red. “What? Are you shy talking about bottoming?
“Really? But where’s the fun in that?”
Harry watches Draco with fascination as he slowly enters another finger. Draco’s back muscles move beautifully. His face is warped with pleasure.
When Draco manages to get rid of Harry’s boxers, he conjures some lube and gently squeezes Harry’s tip.
“Of course, you don’t. You don’t need any of that, anyway. Your hair is perfect.”
Harry shakes his head. “That really doesn’t sit with me. You, out of all people, have a problem getting laid?”
Tears are forming in Draco’s eyes, slowly rolling down his cheeks. Harry stretches his neck and kisses Draco’s throat.
Draco presses his lips tightly together and doesn’t say anything else.
“Harry”, Draco repeats. “This will change everything. Please, think this through.”
“Of course, Mr. Potter. We absolutely love to. It is an honor, Sir.”
“How can I help you?”
“Hello, nice to see you all. My name is Professor Malfoy, I teach History. Some of you may already know me.”
Friday evening rolls around and they’re all set to go to the theatre to watch Shakespeares “Romeo and Juliet”.
That’s why Harry stands in front of the mirror, checking himself out for the tenth time and adjusting his wild, messy hair.
Draco hums in agreement. “Yeah. Me too.”
Fuck.
Harry seems as if he wants to say something but then the waiter sets their food down on the table. “Okay, I’ll back off for now. But this discussion isn’t finished just
Therefore, Harry stops his movements and tells Draco to turn around. He takes off his shirt, his jeans, and his own boxers, throwing the clothes away carelessly. He conjures some lube into his hands and rubs Draco’s hole with it. He’s already so relaxed. It’s easy for Harry to push a finger inside.
Harry can’t believe he asked Draco out. He didn’t really ask him out. But this still feels like a date. Draco had immediately agreed to repeat their little adventure from last week. He had told Harry he would brew the potion and that they should meet around 10 pm.
“I’m with the savior. I’m immune to punishment. And who gives a fuck anyway?”
“Harry, mate. Have you gone insane? What the hell are you doing? And why does it smell like French cheese all of a sudden?” Ron hisses again.
“You have no idea,” Draco groans. “how often I touch myself thinking of you.”
* * *
Harry continues to lick Draco’s tight hole, teasing him and making him feel good. Draco moans uncontrollably now and Harry only hopes that the room of requirement is soundproof.
Harry’s dick hasn’t received any attention whatsoever over the last few months. And it’s safe to say that the young wizard is slowly going insane. How is it possible that saving the wizarding world and being the most famous wizard would be such a cock block?
Draco follows Harry’s order. “Harry, you don’t have to do this.”
Ron rolls his eyes. “No, Harry. We’re family, not friends. That’s different.”
“You alright?”, Harry asks genuinely concerned. “You look really pale.”
Harry shakes his head. “I only said that I didn’t find you attractive because I was too proud to admit that I think you’re bloody gorgeous. I felt stupid because you vehemently denied feeling attracted to me. Fuck, I always found you attractive. How could I not? Look at you!”
“I’m angry because I fell in love with you, Draco.”
Harry sighs. “I told you it never was about feelings. We were just having sex. And now that we agreed to stop, we’re trying to be friends.”
Draco smiles and lays down on top of Harry. “Of course. Wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”
Draco barks out a loud laugh now. Harry giggles. “Who would’ve thought we would end up like this, huh? Fourteen-year-old me would throw a tantrum if he could see us right now.”
Draco sighs. “I know. But still.”
They both moan at the sensation.
Harry glares at his best friend. “Fuck you, Ron.”
He rolls the window down. “Can I give you a ride?”
It’s been a week since the hookup, and Harry can’t concentrate on anything else. He gets flashbacks of that night, his thoughts keep drifting to Draco, and he feels uneasy most of the time. He doesn’t know what it is. At first, he had been in a fantastic mood. He thought everything was great between him and Draco. He thought he was being cool. He could handle it. He never got attached to a One-Night Stand before anyway.
“Do you?”
Thankfully, it’s late and dark and nobody’s here in the parking lot anymore. And even if, Draco doesn’t care. It’s raining like crazy, who’d be crazy enough to step out of the gym now?
Draco grins. His cheeks turn pink. “Couldn’t help myself.”
A small layer of sweat has gathered on Draco’s forehead, making him look even iller.
“You always say how soft my hair is. And you also comment on how smooth and fancy it looks.”
* * *
They continue playing the game. The bottle lands on Ginny, and she chooses Truth. “Ginny, who is the best kisser in this group?”
Draco frowns and types a reply.
“Remember when Ron thought he was in love with Lavender? He was crazy about her, all because that psycho bitch poisoned him with Armortentia. But he wasn’t even into her. It was the opposite – he hated her!” Harry suddenly giggles. He doesn’t know where that thought came from and why his brain suddenly brought that up. It left the conversation moments ago anyway.
But then he quickly had to learn that his mind, his body, and his heart didn’t really follow his orders this time. Maybe something of that potion got stuck in his body and is making him fantasize about Draco now. Perhaps he didn’t actually get sober. Maybe, it’s changed his mind forever.
Everyone quickly finds themselves a group of five.
And when they finally return to their friends, they’re already drunk and dancing to a remix of Travis Scott, not really caring about Draco and Harry.
Draco smiles. “Of course. As always.”
Harry stares at Ron in horror. Ron tilts his head in fake sympathy. “
Harry bites his lip, trying to suppress a groan. He’s starting to sweat, he feels way too warm. But he doesn’t stop. He wishes he could freeze this moment and stay here forever, with Draco.
Harry’s head starts to spin and he feels weirdly anxious and aroused at the same time. “I had no idea that you were a Veela.”
Harry stares at Draco, lost in thought. If he moved a little closer, he could probably kiss him. But if he did that, he would ruin everything between them. And after spending the entire Christmas Break with Draco, Harry isn’t sure how he’s ever going to live without him. Being around Draco is so easy and wonderful. They keep their eye contact for a while. Then, Draco clears his throat and rolls out of bed.
Harry looks at him in confusion.
Harry should’ve known that returning to Hogwarts was going to change everything. He kind of had expected everything to go back to normal. He would see all of his former classmates, he would go to his classes and do his homework. He'd hang out with his friends, play some Quidditch. Yeah, life would be easy and great. Harry had expected everything to be the same even though he’s smart enough to know that after
Draco smiles softly. “Okay, now talking about not selflessly sacrificing yourself. What do you mean with that?”
For the rest of the night, he hides away, mostly staying inside. The living room is much quieter and cozier than the tent anyway. He stays close to his friends and sips on different juicy cocktails, slowly getting drunk. It’s okay. It’s great, actually. He notices how much he missed chatting and laughing with them. He still can’t believe how they accept Harry’s bullshit without any terms and conditions. He sits down next to Luna on the couch and snuggles closer to her.
Hermione tilts her head and a deep frown forms between her bushy eyebrows. “Harry, you know I love you. But avoiding him will only make things worse. You’re behaving like a coward. I really think you should talk to him.”
It's lovely. It's simple. And it's also sugar sweet. Draco feels so light and young that even his mother is starting to pick up on it.
Harry can feel Draco’s dick pressing into his stomach already. He feels relieved knowing that the whole scenario in the bathtub didn’t leave the blonde boy cold either.
“I don’t know”, Draco admits. “I didn’t want to owl you first. I wanted to give you some space. Figure everything out.”
Harry watches him, unsure of how to reply. He’s still expecting Malfoy to fall back into old habits and start the insults and the fighting again, even though he knows that’s not going to happen.
Draco lets out a desperate sob and slams a hand down onto the mattress. “Harry!”
“Harry,” Ron hisses. “What the hell is up?”
Draco keeps quiet and follows him.
When Draco shows him how to do Yoga for the first time, Harry can’t help himself but stare at Draco’s incredible arse. He really hopes that Draco doesn’t notice Harry staring like a creep. He tries his best to focus and tries to follow Draco’s instructions, but it’s really difficult with Draco looking like that in yoga pants.
But then, something catches his eye. One of the paintings shows a man that looks oddly like Harry.
The other man jumps up in surprise and turns around. “Oh. Good morning, Harry. Didn’t expect you to be up already.”
This is a first, Draco thinks.
Draco blushes. “Like a professional athlete.”
Together, they walk towards their next class. For some reason, Harry feels awkward. They haven’t spoken at all since the trial. Harry had defended Draco and his Mother in court because he was and still is convinced that Draco was only a victim of his surroundings and that he didn’t have a choice. He never actually talked to Draco, though. Not before and not after the trial. The timing had always been odd. He feels weirdly nervous around Draco now.
But fuck, why isn’t Draco reaching out to him instead? Draco was the one who disappeared! And now Draco doesn’t write or call or text! Harry is slowly but surely going insane.
Harry chuckles and interrupts him. “Okay, okay. I got it. You don’t think I’m attractive.”
So when he sets up his laptop, turns on all the Equipment and opens the PowerPoint presentation, he forces himself not to look up and search the room for the raven haired man.
Harry’s head is going all fuzzy and he wishes that he could clear it. His heart thrums painfully in his chest and he feels like throwing up. Draco painted him! And he made him look so beautiful.
Harry sighs. “Our friends are absolutely mental. They gave us both a shot of Veritaserum.”
After releasing the students, Draco busies himself closing the PowerPoint presentation on his laptop. He pulls out the plug when he notices someone is walking up towards his desk.
“We were all guessing it was Draco because you both changed your behavior around the same time. We’re friends with Blaise and Pansy now, you know? And they noticed Draco changing too. He seemed happier and more relaxed.”
Harry looks at him deeply lost in his thoughts. His brows are furrowed and he bites his lip. Draco nearly has a heart attack at the sight of that and busies himself with his paperwork.
Harry’s dick twitches in anticipation, he’s getting harder and harder every passing second. Merlin, he cannot take advantage of Draco like that. The man is in severe pain and Harry can’t control himself enough to help him through it and not lure him into liking Harry’s touch.
He hands a Christmas tree bauble to Draco. “Go on.”
This feels so much more intimate than Harry has ever felt with anyone. He wants to do this forever, wants to feel Draco, wants to kiss him, wants to take care of him, touch him, and make him feel good.
“Let’s get started, shall we?”
“I’m in love with Harry”, Draco bursts out.
Harry smiles softly. “Thank you, Draco. It actually looks wonderful.”
“I think Luna is the prettiest girl”, Neville admits shyly with a blush creeping up his cheeks.
He grabs the painting and takes a closer look. That’s his messy hair, his long lashes, his lips, and – his scar?! It is Harry! It shows him sleeping on this exact couch. His hair looks wild but his face seems so peaceful and – beautiful.
“Hm. I’ll leave my boxers on”, Harry decides. He takes off his hoodie, then his sweatpants. He’s suddenly very much aware of the proximity in this tiny bathroom. He notices how close Draco is standing and feels hot all of a sudden. Even though they had sex multiple times and saw each other naked about a million times by now, Harry feels nervous, shy, and self-conscious all of a sudden. This is different, he thinks. There’s no Amortentia to cloud their brains. What if Draco looks at Harry’s body and finds it absolutely disgusting now?
“Yes?”, Harry’s eyes sparkle in amusement as if he knows exactly what he’s doing.
Harry shrugs. They’ve agreed that they’re on friendly, totally not weird, speaking terms now, but it’s still strange to talk to Malfoy in a friendly, neutral way. But Harry really wants to make an effort with him. He wants to give him a chance. They're not kids anymore. That’s why Harry tries to open up.
Harry stares at him with wide eyes. He’s not shirtless anymore, he’s wearing a black shirt and grey joggers. Draco now clearly sees the shadows under his red eyes and how his face seems worried and dull.
Draco smiles. “What’s so funny?”
“Fuck,” he sighs. “Harry,
They both head upstairs and go into their own separate rooms. Harry almost wants to suggest to share a room, but he knows that wouldn’t end well. He really can’t sleep in the same bed as Draco and not make a move on the other man. But staring at the lonely bed in his room seems wrong. He shouldn’t be sleeping here alone. Harry sighs. Get it together, man. Just friends.
“Hmm,” Ginny says. Her eyes sparkle dangerously. “Grab Draco, go to the bathroom, and stay there with him for ten minutes.”
Harry shrugs. “I’m interested in history. And I have to visit a lecture in a different major, it’s obligatory.”
“When will you move again?”
“It’s getting worse”, Draco simply explains. “Please. Leave.”
“For real!”, Harry chuckles at Draco’s shocked expression. “You should see your face.”
Draco tilts his head in surprise. “Really?”
“Better?” Draco mumbles.
Harry nods. “You know, I’m pretty sure nothing ever would have happened between us if it weren’t for the Veela thing.”
Harry sighs and decides to switch the topic for now. “Anyway. I didn’t want to hide anything from you. I just genuinely didn’t notice it myself”, Harry eventually admits.
Harry presses his lips together as if he’s gathering up the courage. Then he finally says “Here, I’ll give you my number. Will you text me when you know?”
“Anyway. That’s what makes him so special. He treats me like a normal person for once. He sees my flaws. And he understands me.”
Harry nods. His head spins, and he doesn’t know how to respond. The conversation went into a weird and confusing direction, and Harry can’t keep up anymore.
Draco leans against the door and takes a few deep breaths. Harry’s head is spinning. He can’t think clearly anymore; the alcohol is running through his veins.
Harry thinks for a moment. Then, he grins. “Follow me.”
Draco frowns. "You can't. You need to narrow it down."
Harry giggles at something the boy says and takes a bite off his food. Then, Harry leans on his shoulder and nuzzles his nose into the boy's neck.
, Harry thinks. Draco’s hair looks wonderful.
Draco nods and suddenly feels dizzy.
Draco sighs. "I could kill Slughorn, though. He just
“I’m so desperately in love with you”, Harry repeats. “You have no idea.”
“I want to know more about Muggles”, Draco hums. “And I asked Hermione what kind of books they are reading. She said there are many genres, but she loves this classic book called ‘A Christmas Carol’ by Charles Dickens. So, I’m reading that.”
Draco grabs Harry’s neck with his left hand and squeezes just enough to make sure that Harry knows he’s still in control after all. He could stop this at any moment. It’s the perfect mixture of rough and passionate, and Harry’s head begins to spin.
“What do you usually dream about?”
Draco smiles. „You’re young. You’ve got your whole life ahead of you. I’m certain you will find your way.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“You’ve never felt good about yourself before?”
Draco nods. "Yeah, sure."
Harry nods. God, he wants to hug Draco. He wants to be close to him. But he stops himself. He doesn’t know what to say and it makes him feel incredibly sad.
“Yeah. Let’s go.”
An awkward silence settles between them again. And although Harry wants to say something, anything, he doesn’t.
“Oh God,” Harry moans. If he could stop time, he would. This feeling with Draco, being with Draco, gives him this spark of joy that he never wants to miss ever again. “Fuck, Draco!”
Draco throws the cigarette away. “Well. I guess we’re both struggling then.”
The memories of last night hit him then. Harry suddenly remembers everything. The Leaky Cauldron, the Room of Requirement, Draco, his idea, the Dungeons, the brewing, the Armortentia, the Sex.
He’s breathing heavily and notices how tense Draco feels. God, this is it. Draco isn’t reaching back. Harry has ruined everything.
“Yeah”, Harry replies. “I know.”
Harry's eyebrows narrow in confusion, forming a small v on his foreheard. "Who?"
They both study for over an hour and Draco was right. It actually isn’t as bad as Harry had thought. And since Christmas break is already in two weeks, Harry feels much more motivated now.
Draco shrugs. “Sometimes. I guess all of us war kids have them, right?”
Draco sighs. "Okay, thanks for your advice."
“But we never really hung out without the love potion. So, do we really know each other? Urgh, I don’t know. This is all so complicated.”
“Happens all the time.”
He ignores her compliment. “What on earth is Malfoy doing here?!”
Harry feels alarmed. He jumps up and tries to rush past Dean, but the other wizard holds him down tightly. “Dean, what the fuck?”
“What is that?”
“I do care about you, Draco. I –“, Harry doesn’t want to give away too much. He sighs. “I like hanging out with you. I like talking to you. I’d like to think we’re actually friends now.”
Therefore, on Sunday evening, he dresses up as a vampire. His costume looks absolutely ridiculous. He’s wearing black jeans, a black shirt, and a dark red cloak. He painted his face white and his lips red. Hermione helped him paint a few red dots on his chin. They’re supposed to resemble blood, but Harry doesn’t really see it. Luna, Dean, George, and Seamus eventually arrive at the burrow as well. Their costumes look so much better, but Harry doesn’t even care. All he wants is to see Draco. That’s the only reason why he’s coming with them in the first place.
Draco hums. “Yeah. Fine.”
Harry doesn’t respond, completely taken aback.
“Why?” Draco’s voice is almost a whisper.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Harry asks, still panting.
Draco tilts his head. “I don’t know. It’s really cold outside, so it might.”
“I just do. We haven't seen each other in two weeks”, Harry sticks out his tongue. “Didn’t you miss me?”
It’s getting difficult. And Harry can no longer bullshit himself. Who is he even trying to fool here? He’s right in the middle of falling in love with Draco Malfoy. Completely sober, completely conscious. No love potions involved. Being “friends” with Draco only made him realize how much he doesn’t want to be friends with him. He wants to be with Draco. He wants everything with Draco. The sex, the kissing, the cuddling, then falling asleep next to each other, the hanging out, the jokes, the conversations, the long walks around the Great Lake, the yoga sessions, the study sessions, the stuffing their faces with cake, Draco.
? I thought only Ron knew? How? Since when?”
Draco tilts his head. “I see. But you'll have to eat eventually, you know? It's pretty concerning how little you eat."
Draco looks up from his book and stares at emerald green eyes. Harry looks a bit paler than usual but the smile is as bright as always.
When his orgasm finally hits him, it hits him with such intense power, Harry feels like fireworks are exploding inside of him. His body is shaking, his legs feel weak, and he feels out of breath. Draco follows him close after, they’re both collapsing against each other. They sink into the hot water, trying to catch their breaths.
“Morning”, Harry says after watching Draco for a while.
“Hey, that’s not fair!”
Harry comes shortly after, his whole body tensing.
Harry feels anger bubbling up inside of him. He turns around and finally looks up at Draco. He ignores the way his makeup enhances his grey eyes. Draco looks absolutely beautiful. Fuck. “That’s funny, considering
“So, you two really want to be friends now? No kissing, no sex, nothing? After shagging your brains out for the past three months?”, Ron asks.
Harry giggles and instead of watching the movie, he watches the way Draco’s eyes light up or the way his lips flinch every now and then. He wants to move closer. Harry feels this desperate need to reach out and touch Draco’s arm or run his fingers through his hair. He wants to hold his hand and squeeze it. Harry wants to kiss Draco and hold him tight. Instead, he clears his throat. He stands up and walks into the kitchen to get some snacks.
For what feels like hours they stay in their position, not saying anything. Harry lies on top of Draco, his soft cock still inside of the blonde man, sighing happily.
“Now, for our main challenge, we have a special holiday treat in store for you. Oh, Pit Crew!” Ru called out in a singsong voice, and several muscular men clad only in red underpants and Santa hats marched into the werkroom, each carrying a large box wrapped in holiday paper.
the red carpet!” Michelle exclaimed.
“Literally!” Draco cried. “Steve, do you remember how I told you that you’re smarter than a koala?”
—Confessional—
“I wanna be the hostess.” The team looked at Acacia in surprise. “You know, like on TV when they bring in a guest chef who shows the TV host how to cook something? That way, we can play off each other and not be on our own in front of the camera.”
As it turned out, the flame war was not what Draco had feared. Instead of facing death by fire, he had been sat him down with a calming draught while Dean Thomas explained that trolls on Twitter were posting racist tweets bashing queens of color on the show and saying they wanted Draco to win Drag Race.
Finally the song ended, and Draco kept her pose while working to catch her breath.
Draco smiled back.
“Make sure you put on good walking shoes, ‘cuz we’re hoofin’ it tonight,” Venus warned.
—Confessional—
“No kidding! My look is
Draco sprayed tea across the table. Crabbe had visited the
she squealed, and jumped up and down like a five-year-old. The audience cheered.
“RuPaul, please allow me to introduce you to the legendary British celebrity baker, Mary Berry.”
“Chicken.
Lorena looked around the room, too. “I think Blondie’s in trouble,” he said, nodding his head in Draco’s direction. Draco sat at his worktable, still glaring at the stuffed koala in front of him. The koala stared back at him with vapid eyes.
Draco leaped over the bale of hay that each queen had danced in front of. She began shifting her weight from one leg to the other as she hopped up and down.
The queens burst into the werkroom, ready to start the next challenge.
“It’s been swell, but the swelling’s gone down,” Kali lip synced as Tank Girl. She wore combat boots and denim overalls over a red bra with a derby hat over blonde braids.
This week: The queens create ads for RuPaul products! Watch Draco sell fried chicken. Really, this is quality entertaintment.
Harry could feel the frustration pushing against the edges of his control. “I don’t suppose you could recommend an accountant who is familiar with the property?”
This was probably a terrible idea. But then, when had that ever stopped him?
“Oh my god, what happened to the mirrors?” Kali Sister exclaimed. A few queens gasped in horror. All the mirrors in the werkroom had been covered in black paper.
Before any of them could make any guesses what this message might mean, RuPaul entered the werkroom in person.
Draco guffawed. She leaned in to whisper into Harry’s ear, “I am
“Oh dear, I should hope not!” Burbage shuddered. She looked at Draco. “How old are you now? Sixty-two?”
“They didn’t think my cornpunk concept was wonderful enough,” sighed Kali. She shot a side eye at Draco, who made a point of ignoring her.
at him. “Oh, and you ought to know that it’s Granger-Weasley now.”
RuPaul gaped, apparently frozen in shock.
And, thankfully, they had let him redesign their robes, too. Draco felt he had made a difference there as well. He hadn’t been allowed to design anything
“That sounds like incredibly dark magic,” Potter frowned.
Draco raised her eyebrows in surprise.
“Well done, ladies!” RuPaul cheered. “Now, Steve’s show will be called ‘Smells Like Fish’ and Intoxia’s will be called ‘Two Piece and a Biscuit.’” Lorena grimaced.
“Well, I don’t know, what?” RuPaul said.
Todric demonstrated a series of moves to each queen and then had them run through the choreography altogether.
The lip sync song for this week is “Pump up the Jam” by Technotronic. This episode’s special guest judge, Ya Kid K, is the lead singer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EcjWd-O4jI
“That
What with the sudden surge of attention in the press, a viewing party for the second episode was soon advertised at The Bent Unicorn, wizarding London’s hottest (and only) gay pub. The owner had procured a way to stream muggle video onto a large viewscreen without the tendency for muggle technology to short out from too much exposure to magic. Naturally, Draco had been hired to appear as the guest of honor and perform a lip sync after the viewing of the episode.
After each of the queens had had a turn, the music finally stopped.
And, since he was already depressed enough about his chances of fixing that damned cabinet, it only made sense that he would fall in love with such a depressed, depressing spirit.
“Hi,” was all the Savior of the Wizarding World could say.
“Yes,” she answered carefully. “What would you call it in the States?”
Michelle raised an eyebrow, unimpressed, before turning to Draco.
“Ooooh, I did
“That’s crazy. I’m gonna be the youngest, most beautiful candidate ever,” Lorena preened, stroking imaginary hair above her shoulder.
—At the Viewing Party—
On the other side of the room, the hooded figure was still there. Draco tried to ignore it and focused back on the episode.
“Our next star is also part of the baking community — it’s celebrity baker, Mary Berry!”
Draco entered the runway in a floor-length, elaborately beaded silk aubergine gown with long bell sleeves and a low, plunging neckline. She had chosen not to pad this time, going back to her naturally slender silhouette, although her corset made her waist look impossibly small. Her wig was thigh-length, straight platinum blonde hair pulled over one shoulder. She had her arms behind her back, a rope wrapping around her torso and legs tying her to a stake. A small pile of twigs surrounded her feet.
“Just for the wrong ghost. But how? He wasn’t even in the room!”
take the fun out of it, wouldn’t it?” Draco sighed. He hastily finished his business and left, leaving Crabbe to float after him down the hallway.
“Here goes nothing,” he muttered, braced himself, and opened the door. He looked inside in shock.
“That’s right,” he replied. “I’ve been to hundreds of them, and absolutely
—Confessional—
“Prat,” Potter chuckled. He glanced at the headline of the newspaper. “Binns is missing?!”
“Lorena is really turning it out in this lip sync,” Venus said, as the camera showed the two queens waving their arms and emoting to the lyrics with everything they had. “But Kali’s serving some serious choreography. I think this is gonna be really close to call.”
Harry snorted. “Really?” he asked. “The Lady of Cakes?”
“Draco, I love a slutty schoolgirl look as much as the next person, but the dark green and gray look a little drab,” Michelle told her. “I mean, gray on gray? You could have made this outfit pop with some brighter accent colors. Red and gold could have been so much more flattering.”
“Erm, because you asked?”
thunder,” Draco explained, then smiled sweetly. “This task is about showing I can do something that will get people to remember who I am. I’m Draco—! And if there’s anything I know, it’s how to make a lasting impression.”
“Oh. my. god.” Venus rolled his eyes.
“Anthony says that most of the eighth-year Ravenclaws will be there, and Ron says the Gryffindors will be, too. I haven’t haunted any of the Hufflepuffs, but I bet they’re going as well.”
The audience cheered.
“What’s done is done,” Lady Cakes said. Let’s give a big Condragulations to Kali for her win!”
“What about my sake?” RuPaul prompted.
“Werk, Mama,” Goldie Hanako cheered as Acacia Davenport wiped away the message. “You pulled out some serious moves in that lip sync!”
Draco later got swept up in the war and all thoughts of Myrtle were abandoned. He forgot all about the prophecy for many years afterwards.
“You’ve never had a sprain before, have you? It’s not like you can just take a pill and you’re cured. You gotta just not use those joints and wait it out until they heal.”
“Steve Donovan, your dancing tapped into our hearts, but your jokes failed to make us flip.”
“Look, Dad, I see my friend Albus over there,” he pointed to the Potions section. “I’ll pick up my textbooks for Potions and Arithmancy if you get the rest? I haven’t seen him all summer.”
, Kali is...some kind of Indian goddess?”
I treasure each and every comment and kudos, so thank you in advance!
“Good evening, and welcome to Frock the Vote 20__,” RuPaul addressed the camera from the moderators’ desk. “Tonight, we have seven queens on the debate stage, ready to win your vote. Give us your time, and we’ll give you an erection for the election. I am your moderator, RuPaul, and I’m here with my esteemed colleagues, Michelle Visage and Rachel Maddow.”
Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. Good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
“Well!
“Hey, assholes!” Another queen called out as she stepped into the room behind RuPaul. The queens cheered.
Lady Cakes shook her head. “No, no, come on, this is a safe space. Don’t laugh,” she said.
“Paris Davenport, in the grand tradition of Paris Is Burning, I’m going to read you in French:
“I’m flattered, but monogamous,” Draco told him.
” Goldie interjected.
Draco turned her head when she felt Harry slip his hand in hers under the table. She squeezed back, releasing a faint gasp when she saw the look on his face.
“We did at that,” Draco breathed. He blinked again, slowly. Maybe there wasn’t any harm in seeing where this could go, was there? Maybe he could have a fling without worrying about love.
Back in the workroom, RuPaul addressed the queens, who were still in their quick drag.
This week: it's time for a BALL! And a lot of other stuff happens. This was initially going to be a shorter chapter.
“Uh huh. O-okay,” RuPaul continued. “And last but not least, the Queen Bey herself, Beyoncé!”
“Erm, well, what was all that about a prophecy?”
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul chirped from the viewscreen. “Are you a beach blanket bimbo? Or do you prefer a Rocky Mountain High? Well, I don’t know about you, but I NEED A VACATION!”
“Here,” Lady Cakes handed back the notebook. “Take notes, ‘cuz Mama Cakes is gonna
The paper had followed the episode initially due to Draco’s reputation as an ex-Death Eater and, more recently, the Malfoys’ very public court case before the Wizengamot. But after the story about the first episode was published, the wizarding public was swift to react. The next day’s paper had featured an unusually long Letters to the Editor section full of opinions ranging from angry screeds about Draco’s accidental use of magic in front of muggles to enthusiastic support for a pureblood (and, well, former blood-purist bigot) embracing muggle culture.
“Not really.”
Goldie took a deep breath and centered her gravity. “Bok, bok, bitch!”
“Yes. If he took his medication, maybe he wouldn’t feel the need to be so violent anymore. We should
Lady Cakes gripped the podium and shook slightly, affecting an arthritic look. “I’m old as dirt, so I’ve seen a lot of ugly, ugly people in my day. And you know what? I’m at peace with that.”
party,” Lily frowned at her dad and stepfather, and crossed her arms.
!” Draco as Cher cried with her hands on her hips, just as she had practiced with Venus. She continued to lip sync as she sauntered over to the pole for her solo. “She is like a total Monet. She looks fine from a distance, but up close she’s a real mess,” Draco curled her lip as she mouthed the words.
“I chose the part of Leeloo from
Teddy pouted.
Draco gave her his most Malfoyish glare.
Millicent Bulstrode peeked her head in. “So, drag can be about celebrity impersonation, can it?” she asked, a calculating gleam in her eye.
“I would give myself one hour to make an outfit,” Draco explained. “Sometimes my boyfriend would bring home some random material for me to work with. I dare say it taught me a fair bit about sewing,” she added.
“Condragulations, ladies,” RuPaul said after Carmelita’s teary goodbye. “And remember, if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an amen up in here?”
“For your main challenge this week, I want each and every one of you —” he looked each of them in the eye dramatically — “to run...for the highest office in the land! America is finally ready for a drag queen president. Because after one reality-show president, what more could go wrong?”
“Thank you, Ms. McMansion. Ms. Sister, your final statement,” RuPaul continued.
“Sorry, not a match. Let’s go to Beyoncé. What did you say?”
—At the Viewing Party—
An awkward silence followed that statement.
“Yes, she’s sure to come back then!” Aunt Aura chimed in. Then they both burst into song.
a Wonder of the World?” Goldie laughed.
anything,” Draco retorted distastefully. “Think of it like lighting a candle and then blowing it out right away.”
“Shove off,” Draco sneered, and pushed past him and out of the restroom. He returned to his table in the workroom and vented his anger by hammering away at his metal henge construction.

Draco dropped his jaw.

“Maybe they’re an invasive species?” Steve suggested.

“You know, we have a box of pens over in the corner there,” RuPaul answered, pointing toward a shelf with office supplies.
“Yeah!”
“O-okay,” Paris said, “I guess that’s

Harry hooted. Draco chuckled softly. “Right,” Harry began, “It all started with a dirty joke. Draco has always had a thing for Parseltongue, so one day he asked if it would work on trouser snakes--”
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul called from the video screen. “Are you ready to play a game? Ooh, I do love games! But...who am I gonna play? More importantly,

“Lady Cakes McMansion.”
The next morning, Draco was standing in front of the hotel with the other queens and waiting on their ride back to the studio when Lady Cakes approached him.
” Courtney repeated in disbelief bordering on disgust.
Stay tuned for the next episode!

“You’re so
to sit down with some British accent tapes,” Ross laughed.
The others silently mouthed the Latin and signaled that they were ready. Draco looked up at Crabbe.
Meanwhile, in the Untucked Lounge, Lorena was less than pleased about the judges’ critiques. She fidgeted with the strap of a cherry-patterned halter top, giving the others a surly look as they discussed whom they thought were in the top and bottom.
American problems! We have enough on our plate just dealing with Brisket!”
“Let’s save it for when we’re in the room,” he replied. “The fewer who know about it, the better.”
Draco pursed his lips and looked around. The others were far enough away to be beyond hearing range. “Go on.”
that fell into muggle hands. It’s full of information on herbology, astronomy, and potions, all written in Veela, and the muggles have spent a hundred years trying to make sense of it. But it hasn’t been considered a breach of the Statute because they still don’t know what they’re even looking at.”
“Hmm.” The witch sighed. “Portkey, please.”
“Thank you, Draco,” RuPaul finished. “Now, Steve Donovan, tell us about your outfit.”
“How could I forget?” Harry smirked back deviously.
Third confession: I find antique dolls creepy AF. Dressing Draco up like one was a cathartic exercise — leave it to Draco to find comfort in something that scares the bejeezus out of me!
Kali’s performance, on the other hand, was a hit. She worked the crowd, addressing individual people and reading them for filth to raucous laughter. She even roasted RuPaul and the other judges, which Draco thought took a lot of bollocks.
“For the love of Ru, it’s Courtney Act!” Draco exclaimed, overcut by footage of Draco and Courtney squealing and embracing each other in a delicate hug borne of drag etiquette.
“I promise not to laugh,” Lady Cakes added.
One by one, each queen was called forward and given one of the boxes. Once all boxes were distributed, RuPaul said, “There’s just one more thing—you’ve already met your Secret Santas at your photo shoot! Now, go on and see what you’ve got in your box!”
“Whoa! Did it attack anybody? The one outside the studio went right for Draco.”
“For this week’s mini challenge, we’re going to play a game. Oh, Pit Crew!” RuPaul called out. Half a dozen muscular men in skimpy underpants walked into the room and lined up against the wall opposite the queens. The queens preened and looked excited.
“Legally, you are no longer a Malfoy.”
“Tell me, is this going to be your Wonder of the World look?” He gestured toward the dress Draco was pinning to his dress form.
“Do you know how to do stand-up?” Draco asked Kali.
“Is that really Kali’s idea of a British accent?” Draco asked in disbelief. He smirked. “I say, maybe she’s from western Britain —
“I only said that because I knew
Draco was returning to green room backstage when the person in the hooded cloak who had sat alone in a corner at each viewing party suddenly appeared. The figure approached her and pulled the hood back.
should go to the reunion,” he countered, hoping to change the subject. “They might give you your old job back. Or maybe Binns will ask you out on a date.”
The queens each had a turn dancing to one of RuPaul’s latest singles (now available on iTunes, of course). It had a twangy quality completely alien to anything Draco had ever heard before. She cheered the others as they boot-scooted and performed all manner of moves that may or may not have had anything to do with country dancing.
“I WON SNATCH GAME!” Lady Cakes gushed. “I am
“Lady Cakes and Venus, congrats on that win, girls!” Goldie exclaimed, changing the subject.
Eventually, it was time for the queens to arrive on the set for Snatch Game. Draco mentally compartmentalized her nerves as she set up her prop and made final adjustments to her appearance. Finally, the real celebrities entered the set and took their places, and the show began. A trumpet fanfare started playing as the queens were instructed to wave at the camera.
Kali grinned. “I’m just happy with the critiques I got. I don’t feel like I have to worry about going home this time!”
“So? You don’t have to know about it for it to be real. It’s not like everyone has to be familiar with your bumpy-foreheaded bint to get that you’re dressed like some kind of character.” Draco waved a hand in Intoxia’s general direction.
queen! I don’t know how to be funny!”
—The Morning of the Viewing Party—
“She was a real standout for me tonight,” Allison Hannigan added.
Draco raised her hands to her face and appeared to claw at her eyes. She swiped them down her face, dragging her fingertips through her eye makeup until they smeared down her cheeks.
“You were jumping up and down and shouting like a little kid, and I was here for it,” special guest judge Becky G told Draco. “It was pure joy.”
Soon enough, Draco’s makeup was finished and she dressed in a tweed skirt and burnt sienna silk blouse, a honey-blonde wig pulled away from her face in pinned ringlets and starlet curls.
And with that, the screen switched off. Draco was practically vibrating. She barely registered that a few tears had slipped past her eyes.
“But that runway look was
cakes.” Lady Cakes gestured to her naturally bountiful bosom and buttocks. Draco looked at her and dropped her jaw, sliding a puzzle piece into a mental jigsaw puzzle.
Venus shrugged. “Lorena, come on over here, girl!” Lorena beamed and skipped over to join the other three as Kali’s smile faded.
—Beginning Episode 8—
The good news is that I’m pushing through and getting back to work on this fic, because I really want to see it through to the end. Thank you all for sticking with this fic. And without further ado, here’s chapter 9!
“Okay, then. Now, it’s time to meet the Queen of the Air herself, Amelia Earhart!” Venus-as-Amelia-Earhart waved.
“Mary Berry, how did you respond?”
The witch cast a spell at it. “This says you selected the NMCS package.”
“Steve,” said Venus.
Draco looked up to see Cindy Sanchez looking over at his table. She pointed at something on Draco’s small piece of white fabric. Draco looked where she was pointing and saw a big brown smudge about a third of the way from the edge of the fabric.
“You could have done something that wasn’t so rude!”
The runway theme that week was Parisian Chic. Draco had opted for a full-length art deco-style gown embroidered with golden peacock feathers and a line of silk roses along the bottom hem. She had styled her wig into an elaborate French twist.
“Kali Sister, you are safe. You may join the other girls.” Kali cried and thanked RuPaul before walking back.
“Crabbe,” Draco answered, then stopped and gathered his resolve. “He’s a ghost now, but he wants to move on.”
“We all had to say who we thought should go home, and most people said Draco,” Intoxia answered.
After what felt like an eternity in rehearsal, the queens hobbled back towards the werkroom on sore feet. They entered the room to see a flurry of action as two queens on Team Paris fussed over a gold bikini.
He flipped through his costumes on the rack, wracking his brain for ideas. His fingers landed on an antique doll’s costume which he had found in the Black family attic at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place and engorged to his size. He hadn’t had a plan for the dress, but added it to his wardrobe because it was simply exquisite: ice-blue silk embroidered in tiny silver flowers, with pale sapphire buttons and a silver silk sash and collar. The dress had to have been at least a hundred years old, but remained in remarkable condition — owing to the curse on the doll which made it attempt to strangle anyone who picked it up.
“Okay! Now, do any of you have any experience with magic?”
Draco eyed the device apprehensively. After some hesitation, he very carefully placed his finger on the lock screen as if he might get burned in the process.
The dolls get political as they all run for president of the United States! “America is finally ready for a drag queen president. Because after one reality show president, what more could go wrong?”
Besides, he didn’t have the attention span for grudges when he was still preoccupied with his hearing before the Wizengamot.
Draco approached the door and rapped her knuckles on it. “Open up! I’m here for the party.”
She held up her card. “If yer not careful, it’ll make you go blind, too.”
“That’s for when she wants a
Draco did the most mature thing she could think of at the moment and stuck out her tongue at the ginger.
Teddy, on the other hand, only had to look at Draco’s painted face in order to copy it in a matter of seconds, which he did at this moment. It was both endearingly precocious and bloody annoying.
Lorena turned to face the back of the set and wiggled her well padded derrière. She looked over her shoulder and said in a sexy voice, “Chicken butt!”
The passport was designed to look like a muggle United Kingdom passport, but it had additional pages invisible to muggles. A bored-looking witch behind a glass window inspected this page when Draco finally made it to the front of the line (after what felt like an eternity). She looked up at his face, looked back down at the passport, then back up at him again. Draco stoically refrained from shifting under her gaze.
these other queens are trying to prove.”
Draco, Goyle, Potter, Granger-Weasley, and Weasley spoke as one.
He’d been shocked. He really did respect muggles, of course. He just hadn’t been prepared for the reality of a real, in-the-flesh muggle treating her so condescendingly. Treating her like she wasn’t better than all of them combined.
Draco watched as the others hurried to comfort the forlorn queen. He had never been a part of any group that would have shown that kind of support, and he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
“Ladies, if you think you’re gonna barf, please aim for Donald Trump’s star. Thank you,” Venus advised. The other queens all cheered.
“This is the most fascinating book I’ve ever read. Under ‘Technology,’ you have ‘Chair strap,’” Lady Cakes continued, then squinted. “‘One must fasten a chair strap while riding in an artmobile.’ What’s an artmobile?”
“What—”
“All right,” Harry told Draco and Millicent once they were backstage in the green room. “I suppose I can live with knowing you’re using me as some sort of theme for your drag show...
Goldie and Steve pulled out some makeup and started putting it on in Draco’s bathroom mirror.
“Aww, you’re so good,” Kali gushed about Acacia’s work. “I would go out like this.”
“You haven’t been talking to Pansy, have you?” Zabini asked. He put one hand behind Draco’s back and steered him toward the bar, surreptitiously pulling a galleon out of his pocket and handing it to Nott, who walked away to where Goyle was talking with Daphne Greengrass and Millicent Bulstrode. They each gave Nott a coin, too, including Goyle, that traitor.
“I don’t date clients,” Malfoy said bluntly.
In reality, there was a tiny battery inside the wand and Draco had simply touched a tiny button on the tip.

Draco blinked, then huffed in annoyance. “Well, of course, that

“Why...y-yes, she probably will,” Draco answered absently. He finished putting together a tray with tea, toast, eggs, bacon, and the morning’s
Draco walked into the sitting room in Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, where his boyfriend was watching something on television. They had been dating for a few months before Harry had introduced him to the muggle concept of television shows. At first, he had thought the whole idea of a wizard watching “telly” terribly silly, something Harry did to make up for what he’d been denied as a child in a muggle home. Draco usually made a point of reading a book while he sat next to him on the sofa, feigning boredom as Harry watched people on the telly kneel on the floor in front of ovens and fret over the state of their Genoese cakes.
find those when I was searching for the ink,” he confessed. “But I tend to think better with a quill anyway, so I thought this might help.”
Draco’s launch into a forward flip took her a bit higher into the air than she had expected. She flipped once, then realized she had enough momentum and flipped a second time, spinning in a little ball until she landed on her feet and slid into the splits.
—Confessional—
. I am launching a new set of products, and I’m entrusting each of you to help me market them. I need you to create thirty-second commercial campaigns. You will be working in teams of three. Now, pick your partners!”
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called as he entered the werkroom and descended the stairs in a suit patterned with eggplants over a green button-down shirt.
“What was that about?” Harry asked.
When four teams emerged, RuPaul continued. “Now, because I own fifty-one percent of this company, I will assign each team a product. Oh, Pit Crew!” Four burly men clad only in underpants strolled into the werkroom, each one carrying a tray. RuPaul pointed to the first tray.
Lady Cakes smiled and went to the back of the stage.
Draco looked askance. He had forgotten about that part.
“Lorena Gucci,” RuPaul said.
“The kind with a screen, yes,” Draco answered.
In truth, they hadn’t missed much. Steve went on after Draco and struggled horribly. She had attempted a song-and-dance gimmick, tap-dancing around the stage with silly facial expressions that didn’t read as funny so much as it was bizarrely avant-garde. Sadly, the funniest part of her performance was when she accidentally slipped on Lorena’s banana peel and fell on her arse.
“Carson Kressley, that’s what my voice sounds like?”
Meanwhile, Draco found a stack of rectangular metal plates, some stiff wire, and a pair of metal rods. This wasn’t going to be a repeat of the first sewing challenge. No Sir! He could work with this.
He sighed and looked off to the side. “It’s given me a bit more freedom to live my life on my terms, I suppose. That’s why I use my real name in drag. Let our family name stand for something he hates.”
“I said he
RuPaul gasped at the reveal. Draco smirked, hand still raised to the right shoulder, and quirked up his eyebrow at the judges. Draco’s entire left side was in male costume — matching grey trouser leg and shoe beneath a silver-grey suit jacket with a high collar. He wore his short, natural hair on the left, and no drag makeup.
After a few minutes of speculation, the large television screen lit up to start RuPaul’s opening message.
Draco pursed his lips. “Honestly, I’m not sure. I thought it was illegal for foreigners to even
Draco was relieved to not have been picked last this time around. Steve picked her right away, followed by Goldie, Paris, and Acacia.
"Don't worry, I'm British. Our body composition is at least ten to fifteen percent alcohol."
“Hey, I like it!” Venus declared. “We make art. We should get around in an artmobile. I’m calling it that from now on.”
Now, however, nothing seemed to matter. Draco was no longer a Malfoy. It was impossible to think past that.
“A little bird told me that a group of
“Condragulations, my crazy eight!” RuPaul told the remaining queens. “And remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else?! Can I get an amen up in here?!”
—Confessional—
But she had died young, and continued to exist. Once he became a Death Eater, there would have been plenty of enmity, both considering the turmoil surrounding his mission and the story of her violent death, which she had been all too willing to tell him about.
“No. You, he kept staring at and stalking. But he held a special hate for me and Vince. It’s like...well, you know how you can sometimes look at someone and hear a little voice like an author narrating their thoughts?”
And so, Draco had started slinging cake like a five-year-old throwing a tantrum. He had to admit it wasn’t a very dignified look. And an even worse first impression, especially considering how the act had come to bite her in the arse during the sewing challenge. No, he had to credit the muggle queen for winning that round.
Weasley scowled in disgust. “Do we really want to know?”
His mind whirled with dark thoughts that could only be purged by flying on his broom or by smashing everything in his hotel room. He grabbed his broom and disapparated to the San Adra Quidditch Park.
And with a quick departing message, Lorena walked back up the runway and out of the competition.
“Hello, Mariah,” he said, “Yes, I’m planning to lip sync to Celestina Warbeck after the viewing.”
“Do you want to be?” Paprikah glared at him as she unzipped Draco’s dress and began to remove the mic that had been taped to her back.
“It’s my lucky stick,” he explained when Paris gave him a raised eyebrow. Kali snorted.
—Confessional—
“How do you do, I’m Pernita Simmons,” she said, shaking Draco’s hand. “I’m the defense attorney who was assigned to your case before the Wizengamot.” Draco raised his eyebrows as she laid a thin folder down on the table in front of her and opened it up.
“There’s a spell I’ve found in the Manor library,” Draco said, setting the book on the table and opening it up to the right page. “We bring him back to life for just a few seconds, then he dies again and moves on.”
“And then I went to see Greg and haunted him for a bit.”
Eventually, the queens returned to the stage.
“Kali Sister,” RuPaul continued, “Tonight, you exceeded all our expectations and slaughtered the audience. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week’s challenge.”
—ooo—
Draco tapped his quill in thought.
Oh well, LOL. At least it wouldn’t be the first time queens have repeated celebrities on Snatch Game!
“You’re so pale,” he commented, contouring lines onto the blond’s face. “When you go outside, does your skin just, like, burst into flames or something?”
He picked a tiny ball of pink lint off the table and gently placed it on Araneus’ head. Proportionally, it resembled a spider-sized pink afro wig. He held the spider up to the other queens, who were timidly watching the scene.
“Draco,” Kali asked as they were putting on their makeup. “Who is Mary Berry?”
Draco walked onto the stage for his one-on-one comedy workshop with Bruce Vilanch. After saying hello and a few short words of small talk, Draco launched into his stand-up routine.
RuPaul laughed.
“Hollywood!” Goldie answered with an excited little jump.
Paris looked around. “It’s down to nine of us. Do you think—”
Draco was about to respond when they heard an angry voice yell, “All you fags need to get AIDS and die!”
Draco-as-Mary’s hands wobbled a bit as she held up her answer card. “Bum bandit stole my show, he did!"
“Oh, dios mio!” Lorena cried in relief. “I thought for sure you were going home.” Goldie and the others laughed.
Harry seemed to sense her discomfort and slipped his hand around hers. She gave him a weak smile in return.
“You’ve never seen a cooking show?” Steve asked in disbelief.
She cast a spell at the suitcase and frowned.
“Somebody’s got a stowaway!” Carson jeered.
“Oh, you’ll find out soon enough.” Kong winked. “Really, it’s just a formality. I’m sure you won’t give us any reason to suspect you of doing real magic in front of the no-mags.” With that, he, too, walked away, leaving Draco confused and slightly worried.
“You wanna know why?” Lady Cakes continued.
“I did,” Draco confessed, “But I’m the only one serving ‘Red Carpet Realness’ on this runway. I don’t know
“Draco, that’s not magic,” Goldie chided. “Anyone can do that!”
Mon coeur qui bat
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called as he entered the workroom wearing a neon green suit with neon pink polka dots and neon pink fedora.
“Well. I do believe our minds were in different places because I was thinking about cake, but I said
Draco took a bow. The queens applauded.
“If?” Draco asked.
“Venus Flygirl, you’re safe.” Venus went to the back and held hands with Goldie.
“I own fifty-one percent of this carpet,” RuPaul drawled as Draco turned to walk back upstage.
“I didn’t think you were funny, either,” Paris added.
“Well—”
The three queens stepped forward.
“Er—”
“I’m helping a lot of the other girls in the werkroom. I don’t know why, when I should probably be cutting their bra straps instead,” Ivana laughed. The camera switched back to the werkroom, where Ivana was showing a nervous-looking Draco how to operate a sautering iron.
“Astoria,” Draco corrected.
—Confessional—
Draco was trying not to notice Rita Skeeter among the audience, however, not sure she was ready for one of Skeeter’s style of newspaper write-ups. Looking at the reporter across the room, Draco noticed a hooded figure sitting nearby at a table in a far corner. Something about the figure reminded Draco of someone, even though the person’s face was invisible and Draco couldn’t put her finger on what seemed so familiar about them.
“I don’t see Scorpius. Did he leave?” Potter peered around the corner.
“I’m so excited — this is my first mini challenge on the show!” Draco gushed as the camera switched to footage of Draco stepping onto the photo set towards RuPaul and a man with salt-and-pepper hair who held a large camera. The set was designed to look like an overly decorated room full of Victorian furniture and framed pictures of queens from previous seasons on the walls.
After the judges concluded their interviews, the queens went backstage for Untucked. They each grabbed a signature cocktail from the makeshift bar and sat down. Lady Cakes sighed, kicking her heels off and leaning back into the sofa.
The man checked something on the back of his sign, then studied Draco’s face. “Heyyy, I guess you must be Draco!” he smiled, and reached for Draco’s suitcases.
the proper etiquette for such a houseguest?
As long as he was going to tell this story, he might as well get comfortable, he thought, and hoped the room would grant him something at least close to a sofa.
,” Lady Cakes told the camera, “then you need some of RuPaul’s Thick-n-Juicy Chicken. It’s sooo good—” she winked, “—just one bite will have you moaning in delight!”
The lounge dissolved into giggles.
“I love not paying for things! I haven’t paid for toilet paper in six years. I’ve got two rolls in my bra right now that I got from your bathroom backstage.” She giggled.
“Condragulations, ladies! You’ve each won a $1500 gift card for custom jewels by Disco Jazzle!” Paris and Venus beamed in delight.
of you, anyway,” she said with side eye at Carmelita.
“Whoa-whoa whoaaaaa, caught in a bad romance!” Teddy sang, whipping metamorphed long, turquoise hair over his shoulder.
“There was cake and I wasn’t invited?!” Lady Cakes laughed.
Sneak Peek for Episode 6:
In that spirit (no pun intended — okay, maybe just a little), he tolerated her attention. Part of him even welcomed her concern for his welfare.
Draco, meanwhile, was staring intently at his wardrobe rack. Cosplay was not a look he felt very confident about, even though he had known about the challenge before coming on the show and had had time to prepare in advance.
“Let me see that!” Potter frowned. He grabbed the book and leafed through it, his jaw dropping in horror. “Malfoy, how long have you had this book?”
“Hi Draco,” Herb Kong, Heather Villareal’s replacement auror watchdog greeted. He was dressed as a production assistant. He winked and gestured toward another man and a woman standing next to him. “This is Basil and Paprikah. I’ve brought them in as backup today.”
She fixed the judges with an intense gaze and patented Malfoy sneer. This song called up memories of all those years at Hogwarts, years of want and hate mixed so deeply together it made her lip curl just to think about them. Could she identify with this song? Maybe.
Acacia, Intoxia, Steve, and Goldie each trotted out on the runway dressed as the Statue of Liberty.
With that, he fled out of the bathroom and down the corridor in the opposite direction of the Great Hall.
How depressing was that?
Draco and the aggressive man stared at each other, neither backing down. Draco raised an eyebrow at him questioningly. He had his wand in the holster up his sleeve, and he had practiced using it with his other hand through the fabric of his shirt. He wouldn’t even need to get it out to make the idiot regret it. He could plant his hand on the man’s chest and fire a stinging hex without anyone seeing a visible trail of magic. He braced himself to do just that as the bigot started to raise his fist.
“What?” Draco asked innocently.
There hadn’t been any sign of trouble in the pub, either, even after the threatening letter. Draco wasn’t sure whether that had more to do with Harry and Weasley’s careful watch as aurors on duty, or the lack of anything potentially revealing about magic in this episode. Either way, Draco counted it as a win — at least, for this week.
Draco looked around and saw what he had pointed to. The tall, slender metal object stood at the front of the stage. Draco guessed that had to be what muggles used to make their voices louder in place of a
“Thanks, Myrtle,” Potter smiled at her.
“Calm myself,” Draco hissed back. “Do you think it was easy to live up to the expectations of my name? Do you have any idea what I’ve had to
“More of a social media queen, then?”
Goyle gaped. “What?!”
“She’s a bad influence on you,” Draco told his aunt. “What does pottery have anything to do with ghosts, anyway?”
Draco received a lesson on how to hold a microphone and how far away to hold it from his mouth. He jumped when he heard his own voice amplified across the room.
“See?” Kali gestured towards him, as if his admission were proof of theory.
“A kitchen sponge! Because she’s so dirty!” RuPaul agreed. “Now let’s go to our stars and hear what they had to say. Amelia, how did you answer?”
. Black corn husks exploded around the stage.
“Draco,” the rest of the queens answered. Draco frowned.
Draco sighed in relief, glad to see her go. He flew another lap before descending and returning to the hotel.
Steve’s bottom lip quivered as she clasped her hands in front of her face. Tears poured from her eyes.
Carmelita wore a black latex catsuit and jacket with short, slicked-back black hair. “You’ve been down
“Darling, we need more designers in the White House!” Lorena answered passionately. “Gucci, of course! And Chanel, Gaultier, Versace, Mark Jacobs, Vivienne Westwood…”
This would not have been a problem, except that the unexpected letter he had received from his great-great-great aunt was weighing heavily on his mind.
“Mmm! Potter, you’ve outdone yourself! This is absolutely delicious.”
“Yes, honey, show off those melons!” RuPaul called out to Lady Cakes McMansion as she flashed the camera a suggestive grin and held two cantaloupes in front of her.

He walked away, and Draco studied the koala.
“He’s right,” Granger-Weasley said, and took the book back. She slid her finger down the page with the ritual, scanning the instructions. “If I understand correctly, this is essentially going to reboot his afterlife.”
I’m adding a tag for chicken fellatio because I never expected to write such a phrase, and now that it’s out there, I have a chaotic-neutral urge to tag it just to see what happens, LOL. If you clicked on this fic because of chicken fellatio, was it everything you hoped it would be?
on a landing pad in the TSA Portkey Office at Los Angeles International Airport. After the initial dizziness subsided, he began to get his bearings. The room was large, noisy, and noticeably warmer than the portkey office he had departed from in the Ministry of Magic.
“Sort of like a lesson, then.”
Potter appeared around the corner and made his way past the woman and her children until the two of them were face to face.
“Draco!” A woman with smooth chocolate skin and bleached dreadlocks called to him from the counter. “I see you got our owl. Thanks for coming in! Are you performing again tonight?”
He turned to Goyle instead. There was no difficulty in talking to Goyle.
“Gather ‘round, ladies!” RuPaul called after everyone was finished and changed. “Now, the results have come in, and with just a few hanging chads —” a few queens snickered — “We have a winner: Paris Davenport!”
Draco smiled. “My, how utterly delightful!”

“May I ask why his hands are blue?” Blaise asked in a whisper.
“Dean! Mariah!” Harry called out, rushing heroically into the storefront, pulling Draco by the hand. He thrust Draco’s phone onto the counter. “We got your message. What do we do?!”
“I bet this is some kind of psychological test. They implant some of us with certain memories, and then take those memories away just to see how we react when we’re confused.”
“I think it’s supposed to be chocolate?”
Michelle leaned toward Leslie and said, “She doesn’t pad much.”
“I think maybe you might have relied a little too much on the visual gag,” special guest judge Amy Schumer told Lorena.
“All right, ladies,” RuPaul said, “Loretta Lynn would be so proud. But two of you really danced the barn down: Venus Flygirl—” Venus shimmied her shoulders prettily as the others hooted and applauded— “and Paris Davenport.” Paris preened as she received her own applause.
Several queens cheered.

tried one, Malfoy?” Potter asked. “I never thought I’d live to see that either. What do you want to talk to Hermione about? If you eat a weenie, maybe I’ll help.”
“We’ll start with Venus,” he began, pointing at each queen in turn, “followed by Paris, then Lorena, followed by yours truly, then Steve, Kali, Goldie, and closing with Lady Cakes,” he finished.
“I was up in the Headmaster’s office talking to some portraits. Then I thought I’d swing by and say hello to Myrtle, but now maybe I’ll spare myself the humiliation. I’d rather talk to you anyway, Malfoy.” Potter smiled. Draco felt something wobble in his stomach.
Draco nodded. “I imagine that must have been disorienting,” he said, and sipped his tea. “Go on.”
Several groans filled the air as the queens gathered together and rehearsed their choreography again.
“So...are you a wizard?”
“Excellent! That’s a great answer. Now, let’s turn to our celebrity panel. Ariana, how did you answer?”
“The koala’s coming from inside the house,” Carson quipped. Michelle groaned.

This week’s lip sync song is 9 to 5 by Dolly Parton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbxUSsFXYo4
“Girl, you need to fix that bottom seam, ‘cuz that meaty tuck of yours makes you look like you’re wearing a diaper!” Cindy Sanchez laughed.
Eventually, the queens were sent backstage to the Untucked lounge, where Team Paris were cackling madly at a silly gesture Cindy was making with her headdress. The laughter died as they picked up on the tense mood of the other queens, who each grabbed a drink and joined them in the lounge. Lady Cakes appeared to struggle to pick up her glass, and ended up abandoning it on the coffee table, laying her hands gently on her lap.
The light remained green for several more seconds before turning yellow. “Er, well—” The light turned red. Draco closed her eyes and pressed her lips together before rolling them into a dissatisfied pout.
“Right,” Draco replied. His mind was spinning with vague recollections of American news and retorts that he thought it would be wiser not to say.
“Your Mary Berry was

The queens reentered the workroom in their pinup outfits.
Lorena and Steve shook their heads.
“Ohhh
“Indeed!” RuPaul laughed. “Listen, I have to tell you that I’m not seeing where you’re going with this yet.”
“Oh, no, she’s not religious,” Draco laughed.
Harry snorted. “That’s probably going in tomorrow’s
As Draco watched the lip sync, she secretly rooted for Kali. Over the past few weeks, Draco had developed something of a kinship with her. It also could be noted that Draco had tired of Lorena’s belligerent attitude towards herself and the other queens.
“You should gather that seam,” Ivana advised.
“If I go home on a comedy challenge, I’ll never live it down,” Lady Cakes told the camera. “I have got to lip sync for my motherfuckin’ life!”
“Or, how about if we dress up like old women?”
“I thought she was funny,” Ross commented. “She slipped a little, but she was unique and I liked that.”
