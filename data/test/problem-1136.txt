"No, Draco. Just do what you've been doing so far. I think that's enough for me," Hermione replied and shook her head in amusement at his antics while getting up from her chair.
A week later, on the day of their anniversary, Harry finally got the courage up to come out of the closet to his friends as being gay. He knew it would shock them enough, so he would leave out dating Draco. Harry wanted them to let the idea settle in that he liked blokes, not angering them by telling them he was with Draco Malfoy. That was a whole other issue he would deal with another day. Ron's reaction worried him the most. His friend could be as hot-headed as himself and he feared for Ron's reaction when the second part of his confession would be revealed.
Hermione suddenly groaned and got fifty shades of red while burying her face into her hands. “What did Pansy tell you?" she mumbled through her fingers, shooting him an appraising gaze.
"Well, there was the war and we wanted to keep it a secret. It was a decision both of us made and it was fine then. But now we want to make it official that we are together. Harry wants to take it slow. His friends don’t even know that he is gay. So, I would appreciate it if you two don’t tell anyone just yet. I want this to work out, so please," Draco said with a pleading tone, hoping that his friends would understand how much he needed Harry.
Hermione’s face was buried into the crook of her arm which rested on the table, hair obscuring the violent blush that had befallen her whole shaking body.
When personally asked, what had attracted the two to each other; devastatingly bright smiles graced their faces. With their hands joined together, they turned to each other giggling, their bright Eyes gleamed mischievously, as their rings glinted in the sunlight, and they both spoke at the same time:
When Draco sank completely relaxed into the mattress, Harry stripped off his own clothes and lay down on the warm body of his loved one. He started kissing Draco. First his ear, then his high cheekbones, down his neck, just every inch of skin he could reach. His own desire pulsed between Draco's buttocks and Harry rubbed it up and down with small pushing movements over the oil slippery skin with relish.
"You can fucking bet on it. I will hex him into next week. That sodding half-blood asshole," Pansy hissed, her eyes glinting dangerously.
Harry rolled his eyes. "No, Ginny I can’t. I just want my peace and quiet," he answered her sloppily, which the fiery redhead didn't like at all.
Harry snapped back to reality, face red hot, and gazed up at Draco who looked at him worriedly. "Where have you just been?" he asked softly. "I called you several times. You may want to put on gloves before you approach the plant. Look, your hand already got blisters. "With that, Draco loosened Harry's hand, which was wrapped much too tightly around the stem of the plant, and carefully stroked the small blisters that had formed on Harry's skin with a fingertip that was not yet gloved. Draco mumbled a cooling charm and Harry shuddered at the soft feeling of Draco's skin against his own. "Sorry, I know it's cold but it will help against the blisters."
"Not directly, no. It's just... they were agonizing each other for years and now it could be a romance novel my mother loves to read." Ron sighed and shoved his hands into his robe pockets.
"Uhm, yes. I’m sorry about that. I was completely out of line there and I know that you anyway would never do that. I was just so angry that it slipped out.” Ron apologized and looked at his friend with worried eyes.
When Draco didn't respond anymore, too flabbergasted by the revelation of his one knowing and one not-caring friend, Pansy took the conversation in her own desired direction.
Shortly before he rounded the corner, he whirled back and shouted in a furious rage, "I know now how you really feel about me, Potter. Why did you even owl last night? What about how you screamed my name while I fucked you, while you begged me for more. Are you blaming that on my controlling habits, too? Does it make you sleep better at night? Does it feel good to tell me you love me and then go and laugh behind my back, at how stupid I am for believing you? Taking my first time from me? Fuck you, Potter! It's over for good."
Harry groaned, feeling awkward. Draco and his loose mouth would one day be his death, he was sure of that. How the Slytherin could talk about sex so casually was beyond him. He himself always felt somehow cornered and uncomfortable when the subject came up. Especially just thinking about Draco Malfoy and sex in one sentence made Harry feel unexpectedly warm in his lower regions. And since reading those sodding stories, it was more often than not that a certain blond Slytherin was the main actor in his thoughts.
Harry and Hermione had been right. Again. Most of Hogwarts had returned to a kind of normalcy, doing their thing and trying to cope with their losses and grief. Some with more success, others with less. And that was fine.
He shuddered at the thought; his pajamas soaked in sweat and blinked furiously tears out of his eyes. He knew it was just a nightmare. He tried to calm down as he remembered the night he almost accidentally killed his beloved.
Harry stood there stunned, wide eyes, shocked that Draco had told them that, even more so Draco just broke up with him. Harry knew he’d royally fucked up.
"Look Draco… can I call you by your first name?” She asked uncertainty but continued when he nodded in bewilderment, "I want to let the past go. I haven’t forgotten what you did to me or my best friends. I guess I will never really forget it, but I don’t want to live my life hating someone who despite it all saved Harry in a most critical moment and tried to protect his own family. And I see that you try to change and make amends for what you did.” She raised an eyebrow when Draco shook his head and looked down at the worn-out wood of the table.
"Yeah his hair is awful and he has always bullied us," Ron said scoffing. "His voice is annoying as hell and it grates on my nerves, plus his arrogant sneering is gross and he thinks he’s all hot stuff, but he’s totally not. He certainly isn't my type at all," Harry spat, lying through his teeth, gritting them. He couldn't believe he just said that and he instantly wanted to take it all back. He loved Draco's voice and his looks, simply Draco as a whole was completely his type. He opened his mouth, come hell or high water, he would make this right, but he was cut off when Hermione got between them with a shrill voice.
Draco smirked at him. "Why, thank you, Potter. I hadn't known you noticed," he teased, his smirk deepening when Harry blushed. "Shut up, Malfoy!" He groused and crouched down to get his dragonhide gloves out of his rucksack.
"You seem to have a vivid imagination. Do you also use it in other areas?" Harry chuckled and wiped his hands with a cloth.
Draco felt more than saw as soft bindings wrapped around his wrists and ankles and bound him tightly to the bed. It heightened his senses even more and Harry's mouth showed no mercy. The Gryffindor licked and sucked, sometimes he pushed only the tip of his forefinger into Draco's opening. But he never got deep enough to fill Draco's twitching hole.
When he had gotten back to the castle and laid down in his bed, he pulled his duvet closely around himself and almost immediately fell asleep, dreaming once again of green eyes, wild black hair, and a beautiful crooked smile, that had belonged only to him for two years.
Thinking about his mother, Draco noticed an old letter that had accidentally flown beneath his bed. He picked it up and sat down while unfolding the thin parchment.
"Yes, Ron!" Hermione admonished him. "It doesn't change who Harry is. He is still Harry and our friend," she said matter of factly and smiled at Harry, ignoring her muttering boyfriend. "Do you have someone you like?" she asked.
"Hello, Granger,” he said and coaxed a small smile to his lips. He had his hand on the back of one of the chairs in question if he was allowed to sit.
Ron and Hermione had tried to talk to him, to bring him out of his brooding but to no avail. They even tried talking to Draco, which left Harry with a deep-running love for both of them. But they came back unsuccessful, just as he had.
Draco fixed his gaze on Potter, ignoring the puffing Weasel that was hissing scathingly. "I hope you had your fun Potter, you lying piece of shit. Never come near me again, ever! It's over. Have fun fucking up someone else life."
"Maybe someone should go after him and apologize," Hermione threw in her two cents sternly. And Ron finally closed his mouth.
Draco was on his way to the library. If in search of the frizzy-haired girl it was the first address to take a look. Surely she was buried in tons of books again. But before he could reach his destination, an owl dropped something before his feet and flew away with a hoot.
"How long have you been ... gay?" Ron asked darkly, crossing his arms in front of his body as if in defense.
He laughed stilted, "Yeah, who on earth would like that ugly git? They'd have to have a death wish. Could you imagine how controlling and bossy he would be to date?" Harry grimaced at his own words, looking down at his feet, feeling ashamed of himself. He hoped Ron wouldn't catch on. He was saddened that his friend was so vehemently against Draco and Harry saw no silver lining to it getting better. He could only hope that his blond lover would never hear about this conversation.
Hermione eyed him suspiciously. "You’re not convincing. Did something happen with Malfoy?" she asked while opening the tome, pretending to read.
"I... well... yes, fuck, yes, it's Draco. Goddammit, Hermione. You witnessed Ron's reaction to his name alone. What do you think will happen when I tell him I have the hots for Draco Malfoy?" Harry exclaimed, muttering under his breath and pulling at his messy hair.
"You seemed to know what it was on the first look. Did you get something like this before?” She smirked teasingly and winked at Pansy who looked between the friends with curious eyes.
"I do that? Isn't it rather you who does that intentionally?" Draco quirked one of his aristocratic eyebrows incredulously at him and huffed a small laugh. "Did those little stories that were sent to us gone to your head? Sexually frustrated, what, Potter?"
"Merlin’s sagging balls!” he wheezed out and rubbed a hand down over his horror-stricken face. "Bloody ever flying fuck!” he cursed and eyed the parchment suspiciously. He contemplated, should he pinch himself and hope he was in a nightmare or instantly go and claw his eyes out?
Blaise looked at him with slightly glazed eyes as if in deep thought, then shrugged. He seemed to have come to a satisfactory conclusion and sent a Cheshire grin to Draco. Reassuring him that they were fine, no matter whom Draco dated.
Harry could almost see what Ron was thinking. "No, mate. I don't and never did check you out," he sighed, reassuring his friend that he wasn't on the list of potential partners for him.
Day in and day out Harry pondered on how he was going to get Draco to listen to him; he was utterly lost without him. Even his teachers had to admonish him several times to be more attentive in class because his thoughts always revolved around Draco and their broken relationship.
Harry cursed heartily and looked up. "You remember when you said that I should go and hold hands with Malfoy?”
A pink touch crept up on Draco’s cheeks. "Yes, fine. I wanted him to be my friend but we aren’t and will never be. Not after everything." his voice had grown almost to a whisper on the last words and he jerkily bound his shoelaces, averting to look anywhere else.
Hermione threw her hands in the air and scowled at Ron. "We will talk about this later, Ronald!" she warned him in an angry voice and rounded on Harry again. "So, who do you like then?" she asked, finally diverting the attention from the Malfoy topic.
"I think that's Harry's business," replied Ron, gesturing to her to help him plant the two-meter monstrosity of a plant.
Draco’s hands were shaking madly as he squeezed his horrified eyes shut and grumbled the paper into a small ball. Who the bloody hell came up with such outlandish and abhorrent thoughts and even saw the need to write them down? Further, who saw the need to send it to him? This was the sickest joke anyone had ever played on him and he wished to burn the sender alive with the parchment stuffed into their mouths.
"Can you believe them? That wasn't deliberately from Draco, he just did it naturally. I have never seen him quite like this and I dated him shortly in fourth year, mind you," Pansy exclaimed, smitten with her boy.
Draco moaned and wantonly pushed back against Harry's hands. He couldn't wait to feel Harry sink into him. But his Gryffindor boyfriend had other plans as he pulled away. Draco growled in protest. He heard the faint crackling of silk as Harry opened one of the boxes that he had previously placed on the foot of the bed.
After Draco had himself calmed down, he had snuck out of the castle. Thickly clad, he sat by the shore of the Black Lake and watched the small waves, the Giant Squid made in the far distance, crash against the pebbled shore.
It is nice to be able to witness the happiness of the Boy-Who-Lived and his chosen one. As a friend to both, I'm happy and supportive of them, so are their closest friends. Everyone who is close to both of them wishes them both all the best for the future.
The reconciliation they had the week before had brought one thing clear to the front of Harry's mind and wouldn't even leave him alone for even ten minutes.
The first group seemed to be harmless at first glance. There were a couple of girls and a boy who met in the library every week. Not to study, Ron had already found out that much. As much as they wrote, talked, and laughed it could not be homework. What worried him about this group were the looks they gave Harry, Zabini, Malfoy, and himself. Every time he got close to the group to find out more, they did a
Pansy smirked, while she held the plant at its bottom and Weasley carefully gripped it at its stem. "Do you think Potter has the hots for Draco?" she asked straight out, making Ron almost fall backward when he stumbled over his own feet.
"What? Why?” Potter asked, taking his hand again. His thumb caressed over Draco’s fingers while he studied the varnish again. "It would be such a waste. I think it complements your eyes,” he murmured, locking eyes with Draco. Then he jerked, red-faced, and let go. The next moment he sprung up from his seat.
"Erm, ... since first year, I guess. I don't know, Hermione. He always got to me, no matter what he did, but somehow I found myself always thinking of him and watching him. I like it when he smiles and he can be pretty funny if he wants to be. Sure he was a cocky rude prat, but he's so attractive, I just… I couldn't help falling for him...," Harry shrugged helplessly.
Hermione wondered if Malfoy knew about how Harry had grown up, but in the end, it didn't matter. What Malfoy was doing here was absolutely degrading.
He stilled in shock when he noticed and cleared his throat, "Erm, thanks Malfoy. I‘ll be going now." Harry blushed and had to control himself to calmly walk away.
Draco had similar fears about his father, and his closest friends were on the same side as him. He had no one he could confide in, that wouldn't think he had gone barking mad. It also didn't help that the Dark Lord and a bunch of the worst Death Eaters were living in his family's home at the time. Given that Draco and Harry had hated each other so passionately for the last five years, no one would suspect a thing. But in reality, they secretly had a massive crush on each other.
Hermione raised her eyebrows at him, worry creeping into her eyes, as she saw his agitated behaviour. "What is it, Harry? You know you can tell us everything," she nodded reassuringly.
Draco breathed heavily. He could feel an enormous pressure building behind his rib cage. It was as if his heart was crying out, threatening to overflow him with sorrow. He still loved Harry, no matter what the Gryffindor had said about him, these feelings don't just go away overnight. And what he was doing to Harry now, it just felt so wrong to him, but Blaise was right, he was a Slytherin and he was cunning and hurting and so fucking in love that he just couldn't forgive Harry. He didn't want to hurt him excessively, but he couldn't just accept what had happened either.
Blaise grinned at that. "Yeah, Draco. Balls!" Both of his friends snorted at that and Draco threw his hands in the air while rolling his eyes.
"You still need to tell me how you two came to be," Pansy said grinning. "And what you want to do for your anniversary. If you like, I'm willing to help out with a few ideas." She got up from her seat and hooked her arm through his. "I'm happy for you Draco," she whispered into his ear.
Squirming in his seat, he suddenly froze and noticed with horror creeping up his chest, that he wasn’t unaffected by what he had just read. The blush that had found its way onto his cheeks washed out in an instant and his already pale skin lost all of its remaining color as he glanced down between his legs. No! This couldn’t happen to him! He wasn’t turned on! He couldn’t! This was …
Blaise also changed, a smile playing on his lips. "I noticed that Potter was very angry for your sake when that blasted parchment came the first week. You were already in the infirmary when he threw a fit in the Great Hall. Are you on good terms with him now?"
"Well, not who he is, no. But I liked him since the first year ... well, I grew into liking him and well ...," Harry said bashfully, going red-faced. He wasn't used to speaking about his feelings and shipping around the Erumpent of his infatuation wasn't bettering the situation.
Hermine looked at Draco’s nails and gasped. "Oh, she did a wonderful job. I like her artistic style,” she beamed and intensely watched as the pattern changed.
"What was that supposed to have been? The two have the hots for each other, that's obvious," Pansy exclaimed superior, throwing her hands in the air. "Not even you can be that thick in the head, Weasley."
He answered automatically without thinking, "Tallish, light-haired, nice face, good build ... something like that."
Draco wrinkled his nose at the dragon dung and dumped it unceremoniously into the voluminous pot. "Your job, Potter. Knead away."
He had explained everything. How it came about that he had talked so badly about Draco. Why he did it and what he felt about it. That he had felt torn, that he immediately regretted it when it had slipped past his lips. The moment he realized that Draco had heard everything; he wanted to take back every single word, even more so. His heart ached over what Draco must have felt at hearing those words. That Draco was everything for him. That he loved Draco from the bottom of his heart and would apologize for the rest of his life if it meant Draco would forgive him and take him back.
"No, Potter, I'm just standing here to overshadow you with my beauty and grace," joked Draco, pulling his gloves over the long fingers of his left hand. He had hands made for playing the piano and Harry immediately wondered if Draco had learned the instrument, but he didn't dare open his mouth again. He didn't need to step into another innuendo trap.
coming out of his mouth, did wicked things to his lower regions. "Erm, I think we should go back,” he said, noticing the stares they were getting from the other guests.
Ron still sat frozen on Harry’s bed. His mind was reeling. He couldn’t wrap his mind around what his best friend had just dropped on him. After a while, he got up and walked as if in a trance to the door. He needed to find Hermione. Now!
They made their way back in silence. The boys, not knowing how to ship around the erumpent, and Pansy mostly because she helped Hermione’s burrowed form on the way, whispering with her.
His eyes sought out the owl which flew hooting towards the owl tower. She looked vaguely familiar. He shrugged and unfurled the parchment and instantly regretted it. He had completely forgotten about the sodding parchment he had received three weeks into the term, but now held another one with a different story on it.
The Slytherin's breath came erratically as the slight sting ebbed away. He growled at the Gryffindor but Harry only smirked at him and leaned back to get one of the vials he brought earlier.
"Ah, leave the Ferrett be. It’s none of our concern. The git had it coming," Ron mumbled between bites of his sausage. Harry glared at him, "You of all people should know how I think about that. I didn’t testify for him only to look the other way when he’s abused."
Harry wouldn't admit it, but he suddenly felt kind of nervous despite his previously shown bold behaviour. He wanted to make this reconciliation as perfect as possible, but it was like always. As soon as he got Draco to himself, willing and docile, his nerves ran away with him. The manner of the blonde Slytherin to simply let go and to express his wishes openly was so different from his otherwise so dominant nature.
For the last week, he had been puzzling over a plan for how to combine the two. He had written letters to dispel his fears and had already received positive answers. Most of all, he was happy that Molly and Arthur had no problem with the fact that he was gay. After all, their second-oldest Charlie was gay too, which Harry hadn't even been aware of until then, and so this fear had fizzled out.
Over the next few weeks, things slowly calmed down. The students were swamped with lessons and homework. Harry still wasn’t talking to Ron and Hermione had somehow befriended Pansy Parkinson after they got thrown together for a Charmes project. The girls currently sat outside on the courtyard and talked about the final touches of their newly invented Charm. Harry looked down at his hands. He had played guinea pig for the girls and his nails now showed an electric deep blue with little stars that sparkled in and out of existence.
Ron was utterly shocked about what had transpired in the corridor. He hadn't seen Harry so broken since Sirius died. Though unable to understand it, he felt sorry for his best friend and he knew that it was partly his fault, that it had gotten that far out of control. Remorsefully he sat down beside his girlfriend after she had come down from the boy’s dorm. "Has he calmed down?" he asked warily. "He fell asleep completely exhausted. Ron, I haven't seen him cry like this since...," Hermione muttered with a solemn expression. "Since Sirius," Ron supplied and whipped his hand over his face helplessly.
He had been pacing the room for the last half hour and just began to wonder where Harry was when suddenly the door flew open and his best friend fiercely strode in. Harry threw himself on his bed and pulled his pillow over his head. Ron heard mumbling and cursing but couldn’t make out what was said.
"Draco, I know in the past I've hurt you, I am truly sorry for that. But as I stand here before you, heart pounding, I'm lost for the right words to say. When I look into your beautiful mercury eyes, I see all of the reasons I fell in love with you. It makes me remember every laugh we've ever shared, all the hard times we made it through together, and every beautiful moment there was and will be. How you complete me, without you I am not whole. Draco, I give you my heart, my soul, my everything. I promise to love you, protect you. I will be by your side forever, if you will have me, I will cherish every moment we have together for the rest of our lives," Harry said with absolute honesty in his voice. Everyone who was present in the great hall had to recognize that potter was completely serious.
It had been clear to him what would be coming his way when the Wizengamot announced his parole after Potter had spoken his testimony in favor of Draco and his mother. He had to finish his education, wasn’t allowed to leave the country for three years and had to volunteer for a Ministry-approved cause after he finished school. His parents had to pay war reparations, with his father going to Askaban and his mother being under house arrest, Draco thought that they had been lucky with the outcome of their trials. Having lost all respect for his father, Draco was glad the man couldn’t breathe down his neck at every turn. His mother was kind of fired up to remodel Malfoy Manor and ride it off all Dark Magic that had infused into it when the Dark Lord was their unwelcome guest.
"For how long?" Ron asked and his hands tightened even more on Harry’s shoulders, hurting him in the process.
Draco looked uncertainly at her when she finished, contemplating how to react to such an open offer of peace. He felt out of his waters and decided to go with his usual snark when he replied, "Have you practiced this speech or does something like that come to you freely?"
When they were alone Hermione rounded on him and asked him straight out. "You like Malfoy and don't deny it, Harry. I can read you like an open book and you know that. I can't even fathom why you tried lying to me," she admonished exasperated and propped her fists into her hips.
Pansy lowered the scroll and looked at Hermione with wide, incredulous eyes. Her mouth was slightly open and her cheeks were adorned with a bright shade of red. Hermione didn't look much better. The girls stared at each other for a while before bursting into embarrassed laughter.
"Gin, really I..." Harry broke off and bit his lip thoughtfully, then revealed to her, what she would never have guessed. "I'm in love with Draco Malfoy."
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to calm down. "You mean to say that I need ⅓ of the Golden Trio to remove this?" he exasperatedly asked. "Yepp," Pansy answered, letting the ‘P’ pop at the end.
"No! Merlin, no. I wanted to talk to you about our relationship and that I think it's time to give up the secrecy. I want to be with you in public, hold hands with you and kiss you whenever I want, without looking for a hiding place or making an appointment with an owl just so we can meet up." He drew in a breath of air and nervously bit his lip. "I mean it's almost two years now and the war is over. Would that be alright for you?"
"Careful there," Malfoy mumbled, his minty breath fanning over Harry’s lips, making his head swim. His eyes swiped down to the blond‘s lips for a second before they locked gazes again.
"I have no idea, Pansy," Draco whispered back with a groan to his voice. His boyfriend looked so good; he wanted to gobble him up where he stood.
But his mind certainly began to wander, wondering how those nimble fingers would feel on his skin. Dipping low into the valleys of his body, mapping out every corner, flicking over the sensitive patches which could be ticklish or arousing.
"Shush, Blaise. Let him tell us the story," Pansy chastised. "You taunted him all these years because of your secret feelings for him, right?"
Draco rose on Monday morning, feeling ravished and exhausted. He had holed himself up in his dorm the whole weekend, afraid to run into Potter again. He hadn’t eaten and didn’t sleep a wink because every time he closed his eyes, unwanted images of a bound Potter swarmed his mind.
"Oh-kay… so what got your knickers in a twist?” Ron wasn’t certain that he should even ask but did it anyway because he got the feeling that this wasn’t about their friendship.
"Remember to put on your dragonhide gloves when you touch the plants. We don't want to risk burns," said Professor Sprout warningly as she waddled down the aisle. Her little pointed patchwork-hat wiggled merrily back and forth on her gray ringlets.
"Ronald! Harry! How can you say those things about him? Sure, he used to bully us and his arrogance is sometimes otherworldly, but imagine him hearing you saying that! I think he has changed since the war. And he has feelings that could be hurt too. He got through some real shite too, it wasn't just us. So stop this nonsense right now!" she growled, shooting daggers with her eyes at them. She gave Harry a look that said she was disappointed in him the most. She had been hinting that she thought he liked Malfoy. He was certain she must have seen the way he had been watching the Slytherin lately and how they had been walking around together more than once without arguing. He knew she hated to be wrong.
Harry groaned again as he rolled out of his bed, eyes open by mere slits, and tumbled over on unsteady feet to let the blasted bird and cool morning air into the room. He heard Ron stir in the background but the ginger merely rolled over and began to snore. Squinting his eyes against the light, Harry fumbled with the bindings of the scroll which was attached to the leg of the beautiful nightcrawler. When he finally got it, the owl hooted and went off against the last stars that still twinkled at the firmament. It was too bloody early to be awake, Harry decided and fell back to his bed, burying his head in his pillow.
Harry turned to see Oliver Wood, the team captain from the year above approaching them. He panicked for a second, worried that they would be chastised for poor performance.
“Yeah, mate. Was hilarious. I don’t know what you were drinking last night but maybe a little less heavy next time, yeah?” Ron said, laughing.
“No, no not at all. I mean, Diggory is fit” Draco said, before clamping his mouth shut, realising he sort-of-almost-accidentally outed himself. Theo, Greg, Vince and Blaise knew, but were under strict instructions not to tell anyone. Aside from the inevitable “so long as you don’t fancy me” comments, they had been decent about it, which was more than Draco had expected.
“Last time I wore my normal clothes I got laughed at. I’m not subjecting myself to that again” Draco replied, forcing a grin as he remembered the embarrassment he felt on his first morning here.
“Look mate, here. We’ll sneak Hermione and Luna in here before the ball starts, take photos, then you can wear a normal school shirt underneath. Molly will never have to know.”
“god Malfoy you do not look good, let me get you upstairs” said Harry, steering Draco’s body back up towards the party. Draco shook his head vehemently, but the movement made him feel intensely sick and he blanched.
“it's not for want of offers” I shoot back, smirking. “I just have...” here I pause, and sweep my eyes up and down his figure, “...standards” I finish, turning back to my drink. I revel in the feeling of having won this exchange, this verbal sparring match, and I have won, until Pansy, more drunk than I gave her credit for, snorted beside me and said “yeah, because you’ve only wanted to fuck Potter since we were eleven.”
Still upsettingly hungover, Draco made his way to dinner from the library, where he had sought the quiet to soothe his headache. He was shocked to see Harry and Ron sat at a table with Theo and Blaise, talking earnestly about something. As he neared, he heard their conversation.
“Harry, my boy, just before you go, I have something to show you. It won’t take long. Ronald, you may join us” she said in her severe manner, though her eyes were soft. She led them through to the headmaster’s office, and inside it.
Draco flushed again. He knew little about Harry’s background, but he knew he didn’t come from the kind of money Draco did.
“Horses need exercise. Joining me, Harry? I’ll watch” Sirius said, kissing Remus chastely on the lips before standing and stretching. Harry nodded and stood, collecting all the plates and placing them in the sink.
“mate” he hears Ron say softly. Draco had forgotten that he was there. He wondered at the sudden gentleness. He heard Harry cough behind him.
“hey, Draco hey” said Harry gently, tightly wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
“Sirius and Remus are the first gay couple I’ve ever met, and they’re happy. My dad used to tell me gay people weren’t allowed to be happy. That they didn’t deserve it. I’m sorry for invading your space but I didn’t choose to come here, I was sent away, I was unwanted back at home. To have Sirius talk to me like a real person is the best thing that’s ever happened to me”
True to his word, and despite his exhaustion, Harry refused to cave to the sadder end of his music taste on the first night. He was lying in bed, staring at the draping’s listening to the most upbeat music he could cope with while half asleep, which happened to be the mellow tones of Still Woozy, an artist he could never get enough of.
Soon, too soon, Harry pulled away. “That okay?” he asked, green eyes sparkling; the only things Draco could see in the darkness that embraced them.
“I was the older brother. I always had to do everything better. I bore the brunt of all their anger, all their dysfunction. I tried to save him from so much and then I left him there. He had four years in that house without me and I dread to think of what they would have done to him.”
Harry sighed. “You really are the best Luna. That’s why you’re my darling” referring to when they were much younger children and had had a pretend wedding, and called each other ‘my darling’ for weeks after, the way they had seen Ron’s parents do.
He had the opportunity to wear a suit, though, which he loved. He was not so politically radical that he didn’t also revel in the luxury his father’s wealth afforded him. He selected a traditional two piece, a dark charcoal grey with a crisp white shirt underneath, and cufflinks inscribed with the Malfoy crest, that matched his signet ring that he had received for his sixteenth birthday from his father.
The man was a prat. There was no doubt about that in Harry’s mind. But, was he an evil prat? Or just your run of the mill spoiled rotten prat? Were his hands not forced in the war just as much as Harry’s? He hadn't wanted to kill Dumbledore. Of that much Harry was certain. The half hearted attempts coupled with the lowering of his wand on the astronomy tower made it clear to Harry that Draco’s heart wasn’t in it.
Draco stood and extended his hand to the brunet. “Yeah, I think we might be able to do just that, Harry.” The corners of his lips quirked ever so slightly when Harry grasped his hand in a firm handshake. A handshake many years overdue.
“He originally suggested master but that reminded me too much of Voldemort, so then we settled on Daddy. I never had a dad, so it doesn’t really have any connotations for me.”
“Erm, yes. I just felt that Harry and I had some unfinished business. Some loose ends to tie up.” The blond felt uncharacteristically tongue-tied and out of his depth.
A look that could only mean working through deep, perhaps puzzling, thoughts crossed Hermione's face. Ron, apparently, either didn’t notice or opted to ignore it. “Oh hear that, Hermione. Harry just stopped by the office of his good friend the Minister of Magic for a quick chat. No big deal.”
“Yeah well." Harry shrugged his shoulders. "We've been owling a lot over the last year and I guess we got pretty close because of it.”
“Fuck Draco, you’re absolutely gorgeous.” Harry bit his bottom lip, his eyes moving their focus to the hard cock standing tall against a hairless body. It wasn’t overly thick or overly long, of average size on both fronts really, but had a delicious upwards curve to it—a curve that Harry knew would be devastatingly enjoyable if the man ever decided to top. Harry’s hand had started to rub his own straining cock through his jeans as he appraised the body on his bed. He was only broken from his appraisal when long fingers wrapped around the cock holding his attention.
“I’m not as committed to it as Patrick, and he’s not “my Patrick.” But that is very good to hear, Malfoy. Very good indeed.”  The predatory look had retuned to Harry’s eyes. “I cant wait to revisit the idea of punishment.”
“Hmm?” Harry had fallen into such a deep state of comfort that it took him a minute to realize that Draco hadn’t responded. He took his free hand and tilted Draco’s chin up so that he was looking into grey eyes. “Hey, you don’t have to tell me anything you’re not comfortable telling me. But at the same time, you don’t have anything to worry about. I know who you are, Draco. You don’t have anything to worry about.”  He gave Draco a soft encouraging smile.
It was during this line of thought that the owl from Kingsley finally located Harry. He was lying in a hammock above some rice fields in Bali. He had been in Bali for almost a week at that point, having fallen in love with the lush greenery and hot temperatures. The message from Kingsley pulled at Harry’s gut. It was time to go home.
Harry wanted too. The last ounce of self control he had been exhibiting broke when Draco slammed his mouth agains his. Harry’s hands roamed all over the other man, finally grasping the blond pert little ass in his hands. Harry squeezed as he aggressively ground his hips up, desperate for some friction on his aching cock. Draco broke the kiss as Harry ground against him, practically whimpering in the other man's ear.
“Patience is a virtue, Potter. One you’ve seemingly always lacked in. Now as I was saying, you testified in front of the Wizengamot that I deserved the chance to prove myself capable of being a productive member of Wizarding society. You quite effectively convinced them to suspend the remaining four years of my sentence in favor of parole. I don’t squander second chances, Potter. People like me don’t often get such a benefit. So I decided to become the man you convinced the Wizengamot I could be. Which happens to be a much “softer” person apparently.” Draco sneered the word “softer,” bringing memories of school age fights to the forefront of Harry’s mind.
Harry had arrived at the Burrow just 20 minutes prior, having flooed directly from Kingsley’s office after the trial.
Harry dramatically plopped himself down in one of the leather chairs in front of Kingsley’s desk. He wiped his hands down his face, letting out an exaggerated sigh. “It went exactly as we planned. He’s now officially on parole.”
Draco gasped at the sudden burst of discomfort as Harry finally pushed himself inside. Draco couldn’t voice his appreciation at Harry’s restraint, the man kept completely still giving Draco all the time he needed to acclimate to the impossibly thick mushroom head now inside of him. Draco took deep steadying breaths as the burning subsided and the feeling of fullness turned from painful to enjoyable. “Please” was again all Draco could manage when he was ready for Harry to move.
Harry’s mouth quirked up at one end into a smug smirk. “You of all people should know that it’s not what you know, but who you know Malfoy.”
Harry covered his face with hands and leaned forward, slowly wiping them down. The gesture had always been a way for him to take a few seconds to compose himself, particularly when he was on the brink of losing it. He tried to conjure every last bit of restraint he had, channeling the peaceful conversation he had just had with Narcissa.
Harry paused again and ran his hands through his thick black hair. He let out a long breath. “Everything that makes Kingsley a great Minister--cool, calm, collected, understanding, thinks before he acts--made him wrong for me. He’s the consummate Ravenclaw and I the consummate Gryffindor. We just couldn’t find the middle ground.”
“No.” Harry turned from the auror, who still didn’t seem to get it, and grasped the heavy serpentine knocker and banged it against the imposing mahogany door several times.
Harry ran both his hands through his hair, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “I, I don’t know, Draco. I-I- do you want tea? I feel like this conversation deserves tea.” His left hand was now rubbing the back of his neck. The man's demeanor could be described as sheepish at best.
Like didn’t even begin to cover it, Draco thought. The man standing naked before him was beyond his wildest fantasies. Not only had the man grown several inches taller since their last encounter, his body was broader, though still bearing the lithe impression of a seeker. The most surprising part was the amount of muscle the man had been hiding beneath his clothing. Draco could tell from the form fitting muggle clothing that Harry had certainly gained muscle in the last four years, but he hadn’t appreciated the extent. The raven haired man was positively ripped. Not in the over the top body builder way, but there was not a spot of softness to be found. Honestly, Draco hadn’t known that so many muscles existed in a man's anatomy.
Draco whimpered into Harry’s mouth at the effortless display of strength as Harry moved them through the flat to the bedroom. He lay Draco on his back on the bed, and with one final kiss, moved to stand over the blond.
I wanted to post more than one chapter today, but the next two or three chapters have been giving me a lot of trouble. I just can't seem to make them work the way I want, or that is remotely believable. I'm hoping to figure them out in the next few days.
“Oh come now, Harry. You owe me this. After everything, I do believe I deserve the opportunity to tease the bloody hell out of you. Now, Mr. Malfoy. I don’t want to jump on Harry’s story but as I do believe you two have been alone for well over an hour at this point, I’m going to speed things along lest he drag it out for another four years. Has he come out to you yet? I mean I know he effectively did years ago, but has he verbally done so?”
It had been four years. Four very short years. Time was funny like that. Like beauty, it was very much in the eye of the beholder. He was sure that for some, the preceding four years had moved at a glacial pace— the minutes dragging by never quite turning into hours.
The auror couldn’t be much older than Harry, but Harry definitely didn’t recognize him from Hogwarts. Maybe just a youthful face. “Er, yeah. I want to talk to Malfoy. Draco, that is. Can I?” Harry realized probably a bit too late that he may not be permitted to do exactly what he was there to do. Malfoy was on parole, but Mrs. Malfoy was on house arrest for another year. He wasn’t quite sure what her terms were, if visitors to the Manor were even permitted. Maybe he should have talked to Kingsley about it first.
Harry hadn’t seen Narcissa since the Battle. He had high-tailed it out of Britain as soon as the last funeral had ended, just as the trials were getting under way. He had no desire to participate in any of them, save one. Narcissa’s. Harry knew the war would have ended very differently had Narcissa not lied to Voldemort’s face. He had written a sworn statement describing the scene in the forest—a statement that secured just a two-year house arrest sentence for Mrs. Malfoy.
The dark haired man paused. Then sighed. “It depends what you mean by “been with.” I’ve had proper intercourse with two other men besides you and Kingsley. Oral sex, six. Frotting or wanking or heavy petting involving an orgasm, I’m not sure I could put a number on that. The muggle gay clubs can get a little intense.”
to fuck me. So I ordered myself a few toys from the Wheezes back room. I wanted to make sure I was ready when I propositioned you. Do you know how many times I fucked myself with a rubber dick, wishing it was you? I’ve spilled so much cum with that toy deep in my arse, screaming your name.” Draco had leaned flat against the other man as he spoke, whispering the end of his speech into the man's ear, causing Harry to groan.
Harry pushed the blond away a few inches to look him in the eye. “Are you sure Draco? We don’t have to. I want you but I want you to be comfortable more. I’ll wait for as long as you need.”
You’re so good baby. God I could fuck you forever,” the man rambled. Harry couldn’t control himself during sex, he was always loud and talkative.
In that moment, she pulled a long thin wand from the sleeve of her robe. She waved it in a simple figure eight pattern quietly but firmly incanting, “delebitur anima debitum.” A gold glow brightly enveloped them both before fading into their skin.
“Actually, in private I call him Kings. But if you repeat that I’ll hex you into oblivion. As will he, I’m sure.”
come from Hermione, but I bought some myself. And there’s some from Kinglsey, James, John, Patrick, at least one or two from each of the Weasleys...”
Harry slammed his fist against the wall next to Malfoy’s head, causing the blond’s breath to audibly catch in his throat. “I swear to Gods, Malfoy, I’m going to…”
Harry couldn’t help the soft chuckle that escaped him. “Too right.” Harry lifted his eyes to meet the other pair in the room, “but, I think that may be just what we need.”
Harry walked over to the tree and slid down to sit next to Ron. “Yeah, I guess. I mean, I don’t know, I—-you’re right. Ok. Fine.” Harry looked down and away from his friend as he started pulling blades of grass from the ground as a means to quell his frustration.
“Harry?” Draco was genuinely confused by the exchange he had just witnessed. If anything, he was more confused than he had been when he walked into Trotter's Antiques over an hour ago.
Harry grasped the tea cup tightly in his hands as he stared into it. The cups were dark green with gold gilt design on the outside, the inside of the cups were white with a purple floral design. Draco had to smother the threatening smirk over Harry’s apparent penchant for florals.
The men did eventually run out of steam. Running his hands through his unruly hair, Harry let out a deep breath, and stood. “I think it’s time I go. Thanks for talking to me, Draco. I think, I think we can move on from here, yeah?”
“Hmm, I’ll have to think how I feel about that. Lucious was always ‘father’ to me. I hardly think of him when I hear the term ‘daddy.’”
He spent a lot of time talking to Dumbledore. His feelings towards his former headmaster still a confusing mix of anger, respect, and love. He also spent a disturbingly large amount of time talking to Snape. Those feelings were more confusing. The man Harry had hated since he was eleven had sacrificed so much to save the Wizarding world. All because he loved Harry’s mother. It was...unnerving.
Harry was startled by the reaction, not in a thousand years could he have predicted this. “What? I just cancelled your…”
“Fine. Ok well. Yeah. So, uh, you know, things like “you like my cock in your arse, don’t you? Daddy’s little cock whore aren’t we? If you beg me nice and pretty, Daddy will let you cum.” So yeah, stuff like that.” The blush on Harry’s cheeks was fire red as he covered his face with his arms.
Harry huffed a laugh before he could help himself. “THATS what you had yourself worked up over? I mean really, Malfoy. You were nervous that I didn’t know my ex-girlfriend, whose brother is my best mate by the way, was practically engaged and the darling of the society pages? Please. I am not only well aware, but absolutely thrilled for her and Oliver. They make quite the couple.”
Draco paused his speech, gently tracing his thumbs across the man's strong cheek bones. “I knew you wanted me that night. I could feel it the moment your body pressed against mine. I felt how hard you were for me and I practically melted. I spent the last four years of my life agonizing over it, Harry. Every time I wanked, it was over the memory of your cock pressed to my thigh, your lips on mine.”
“Harry.” Narcissa’s calm voice broke into Harry’s internal panic, as she reached out and placed her cool hand on his forearm. “Perhaps I should have explained beforehand, though I was warned that you would attempt to talk me out of it. I merely cancelled a life debt that existed between us.”
“I think it’s great that you’ve found someone other than us you can confide in, Harry. Kingsley is a brilliant man, and I think he’ll be a good influence on you.” Hermione interrupted the back and forth, deciding that although she couldn’t pin point the reason, she knew the seemingly sudden friendship was good for Harry.
Draco reached between them squeezing the other man's bulge. “I've waited long enough. I want the real thing now, Harry.”
I don't know latin in the slightest, but used google translate. I used the term "life debt forgotten" and was given "delebitur anima debitum" as a translation. I'm not sure how correct that is, but I liked the sound of it.
“Thank you, Harry. I am sure that it is not easy for you be here, that my home does not hold any fond memories for you. As such, I endeavor to keep this as brief as possible so as not to prolong your stay.” Narcissa gracefully settled into the chair opposite Harry’s, crossing her ankles and placing her hands delicately in her lap.
“Auror Keith James. Kingsley assigned him to be my watch guard. He’s been stationed across the street ever since.”
“Hey, Draco, look at me.” He waited until he saw those silver eyes peak up at him, even though the majority of the face was still hidden. “There’s nothing embarrassing about being a virgin. I’m just shocked because well, look at you. There’s got to be an endless supply of men, wizards and Muggles alike, absolutely gagging for it.”
Harry had led Draco through the back room and up the stairs that lead to Harry’s flat above the shop. The flat was decorated much like the shop was—light and airy, but warm. Oh so, warm and comfortable. Draco couldn’t help but smile at the immediate feeling of “home” the place radiated. He sat down in a light yellow overstuffed arm chair as Harry went about preparing tea. Opposite the arm chair was a dark blue sofa large enough for three or four people. A white knit blanket was laid across the top of the sofa, complimenting the floral pastel throw pillows. Behind his chair, the wall was covered with a built-in bookshelf. Shockingly, as Draco never considered Harry to be a particularly voracious reader, the shelves were filled to bursting with well worn books. The sofa was flanked on either side by a matching set of end tables that Harry had obviously restored himself, as they both were white washed in his signature style. A lamp was set on each table, featuring beautiful stained glass lamp shades. Draco couldn’t help but admire their beauty.
“A life debt only accrues if death was a certainty. In our situation, the Dark Lord would have sent the killing curse at you immediately should I have suggested you were alive. I saved you from a certain death. You saved the entire wizarding population from likely death—that is not the same.” Narcissa had her crystal blue eyes fixed on Harry. He had the unpleasant feeling of being sized up. Harry had always worn his emotions on his sleeve, and face, and he had a feeling Narcissa Malfoy was moments from figuring him out.
“Fuck, fuck. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean… I don’t… oh fuck,” Harry stuttered as he turned and ran, high-tailing it out of there as fast as he could.
“Where’d you go?” Draco wanted to hear the rest of Harry's story before getting to his own side of things.
“That’s fair. I do want to know about it all at some point, but for now I want to know how it came to be and how it came to end, and why exactly he thinks I’d enjoy it.”
I think I always knew I’d be a bottom. It might be surprising to hear, but I’m submissive by nature. I also have what I believe the Muggles call serious daddy issues.” He paused to giggle at his own joke. “I like powerful wizards putting me in my place, I think it’s why I was always drawn to you. Anyway, when I started seriously wanking over other men it was always in a subservient position. Then in fifth year, Pans got me a book on gay sex for my birthday. That’s how I learned about the prostate. So the next time I wanked, I worked a finger into my arse. I knew immediately that I liked the feeling, but once I hit that spot, it was like I saw stars. Nothing has ever felt so good. I came almost immediately. From then on, every time I wanked, I fingered my arse too, it’s almost to the point I can’t cum without it. I mean obviously not, but you know what I mean.” He waved his hand between the two of them, referencing their recent escapades.
“I am unsurprised that no one has explained this to you previously. It is ancient magic. Very few families outside the Sacred Twenty-Eight have an understanding of life debts. Indeed, even pureblood families like the Weasleys and Longbottoms would never conceive of calling in a life debt. But it is dangerous to leave a life debt to linger. I do believe that is how one Peter Pettigrew met his end.”
“So naturally, now that it’s real, you’re second guessing yourself?” Kingsley’s ability to get to the heart of an issue was another quality that made him the most well liked Minister in decades.
“So that’s where the books came from. I was sure when I came in that they were Granger's influence and not a single one had been read.”
Draco smirked. It hadn't taken much to get Potter to admit the front. Though, it really didn’t need admitting—it was quite obviously Harry Potter standing before him. Anyone who wanted to know that surely would.  Which begged the question—
love with him, yaknow? There was too much we couldn’t give each other. For starters, Kingsley will never be out while he’s Minister. We could never go public. That’s fine while I’m still hiding away but I’m not going to hide forever. And I want to be out with the man I love. I want to hold hands in Diagon Alley. Other gay wizards don’t have to hide so why should I? Another issue is that Kingsley thinks I’m too impulsive. He’s the one that suggested I see a mind healer. He was right, god knows I’ve lived through enough to need one, but his main reason wasn’t to sort through my traumas--it was impulse control. He thought I was too argumentative and that I never stopped to think anything through. It drove me nuts that he was always so calm. I needed fire and he didn’t have it in him.”
Harry pushed up on his hands creating enough space between the two so that he could properly glare at the giggling blond. “Hey, that was four years of pent up frustration. I couldn’t help it.”
It was enormous. Nearly the size of the Entrance Hall at Hogwarts. The floor was white marble with silver-grey veins. The walls were the same dark mahogany of the doors, adorned by tasteful paintings and tapestries thoughtfully placed. The few side tables were adorned with vases of freshly picked flowers. All white. In the center of the room was a crystal chandelier so large, Harry thought it might be the size of a car. He wondered that it was able to stay affixed to the ceiling considering its clearly sizable weight. Oh, right. Magic.
“I don’t know pick something. Defeating Voldemort, saving you from the Fiendfyre, saving your mother from Azkaban, saving you from going back to Azkaban….need I continue?”
“I told Kingsley immediately. He’s my closest confidante. I can honestly say I wouldn’t be the man I am today without him.”
“Me? Oh yes. Us?” Kingsley motioned between him and Harry. “Once upon a time. Harry and I saw each other romantically for about two years but that ended about a year ago when we realized we each wanted things the other couldn’t offer. You should ask Harry about the story one day, I have a feeling you’d enjoy it.” Kingsley’s smile and tone had a distinctly playful air.
“No Harry. Apparently he's your friend. Don’t get me wrong. I think Kingsley’s great, and we’re friendly when we run into each other. But I’m not just popping by his office for tea to talk about our feelings.”
“Thanks Kingsley. I’m sure I’ll see you soon.” Harry took a pinch of powder and with the familiar and unwelcome feeling of floo travel, he was off.
Draco smiled tightly and nodded his agreement. Harry walked over to the shop door to lock it and flipped the sign to “closed.”
Harry groaned. His self-restraint worn so thing that it was practically non-existent. He was so focused in not pushing his hips up against the slim blond straddling him that he could only manage a hissed “yessss” through his teeth.
Draco turned back to Harry. He was tense, Harry could tell. It looked to Harry that Draco was weighing his options as whether or not to reveal something to Harry. He sat down on the edge of a set of drawers, his hands clasped tightly in his lap. “Well,” he said evenly, “then I’m sure you’re aware that your Weaselette has moved on.” Draco ducked his head to stare at his hands. So it was, that he heard Harry’s reaction rather than saw it.
The driver of the car, a tall broad man who had picked him up from the station had said not more than three words to him for the whole journey. His phone had lost service five minutes into the drive so Draco had been left to stare out of the window, lamenting what his life had become; reduced to a lowly farm hand in the middle of nowhere surrounded by people with accents so thick he could barely understand them.
“yes, I must admit I rather do” said the blond. It was sweet, thought Harry, the pretentious way in which Draco talked. Now he knew of Draco’s feelings, he was seeing the blond in an entirely new light, and quite a positive one.
“cleaning charms don’t clean away the smell of baby vomit. Learnt that the hard way” said Harry. “can you watch ted for five minutes while I go and put some clothes on?” Harry asked. Just as he stood, he heard a voice gasp behind him “my my Potty. And in front of Blaise too, Draco would be most upset”
As he was making the marzipan, he heard a light, female voice join in with his singing, and Hermione came up behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head between his shoulder blades. Harry leaned into the embrace, her presence draining some of the tension out of him.
I only wish Pansy had explained the games more thoroughly, though. As we speak. I am sat on the floor, nestled between Pansy and Blaise, as Granger explains ‘never have I ever’, which doesn’t sound awfully grammatically correct.
Speaking of Potter, about half an hour ago he and Weasley had decided they were too hot for propriety and had removed their t-shirts. Weasley had a surprisingly muscled torso, littered with pale brown freckles and the odd mole. Potter’s was broad-shouldered, and abs peeked through a thin, soft-looking layer of fat on his abdomen. Draco was thankful he was walking behind the two, so he didn’t get… distracted, for want of a better word. The harrowing past two years seemed to have delayed the final stages of puberty through pure stress, and now he was free, his hormones had returned with what one could only call a vengeance. He had suffered a particularly horrifying knack-jump over the summer, after which his voice seemed to have deepened even further. It also meant he had a tendency to be ‘distracted’, especially by Potter. Infuriatingly by Potter.
“the more I think about it, I think that maybe it was finally good because Draco wasn’t on top anymore. Blaise’s name had no stain on it from the war like mine or Draco’s’. Blaise had the cushy flat in Chelsea- which had always been Draco’s dream- and Draco was on probation, stuck in the manor, unable to work or travel abroad or show his face in wizarding society. I’m thinking now that the jealousy never left, and I think Blaise kissed you because he can’t bear to see Draco happy and in love whilst Blaise doesn’t have that.”
The opportunity for said revenge came when he was arrested. The temporary respite was more than welcome. I knew that interfering with my father’s politics was a death sentence, especially with Potter raving about the Dark Lord being back. I wished merely to create a thorn in his side; something small yet chafing and impossible to ignore.
Madame Pomfrey came bustling in just as Harry succumbed to the pain and closed his eyes, falling asleep. She took one look at Draco and manhandled him into the adjacent bed with a mouthful of pepper-up.
Draco entered his room and was immediately accosted by the sound of loud music and, surprisingly, Harry’s voice, clearly blocked by the door and a heavy-duty silencing charm.
“do you remember much from last night?” asked Harry, getting into the bed and sitting against the headboard, eyes twinkling with amusement as Draco tried to hide his shame in the duvet. The blond groaned
it worked wonderfully. It shocked everyone, and I received no less than fifteen howlers from Azkaban, and I felt so utterly self-satisfied.
“clubbing with Dean and Seamus mostly, gay muggle clubs have the best music, and no one recognises me” he replied. Draco coughed again.
“from what I heard, you missed me soooo much I felt I just had to get back to you”. Draco didn’t dare look up, scared to see the smirk he knew would be gracing Harry’s features.
Sirius raised his hand an inch, as if he wanted to reach out and comfort Draco, but then his hand dropped, the air between them charged with understanding, and sympathy.
He thought of the dress he had chosen her. It was a tight teal bodice with floating tulle skirts of lilac. It was whimsical enough to be totally ‘Luna’ and fancy enough not to look out of place in the great hall of Hogwarts.
New Year’s Eve finally arrived, and the Gryffindor boys with Draco in tow were sent off with Dudley (much to Ron’s chagrin; the others didn’t know Harry’s history and knew Dudley only as a distant cousin Harry had re-connected with, but Ron felt unable to forgive him) to buy the copious amounts of muggle alcohol needed for such an endeavour. When they returned, the house had been transformed by Harry and the girls; the downstairs was bathed in colourful lights and hidden speakers blared out music that had the floor pulsing with the beat. Harry had dressed up again; golden hair, makeup and a Bowie t-shirt with jeans that were almost so tight as to be indecent. Guests started trickling in,  and soon the ground floor of the most ancient and noble house of black was full of young people drinking and dancing.  Draco was enjoying the party atmosphere, chatting to Seamus before a yell cut through the air. “Bianca!!!!” both Harry and Hermione yelled. The girl at the door was stunning, with rich dark skin and braids down to her waist. She gave Hermione a rib-crushing hug before launching herself at Harry, who swept her off her feet and twirled her round. Draco felt a red-hot stab of jealousy at the sight, which burned brighter as Harry and the girl raced off elsewhere, hand in hand. Suddenly the music changed drastically, to a type of beat and an accent Draco had never heard before.
“you have outdone yourself miss Granger. That was more detailed than my own explanation, so yes that is it exactly. Tomorrow, a list of your groups will go up. They will be cross-house in the interests of unity, and somewhat challenging in the interests of co-operation and teamwork. They will be non-negotiable. Equipment will be provided by the school. You will be doing this the muggle way, as you will be handing in your wands next Friday morning, and you will receive them on your return that Sunday evening. One member of each group will be trusted with a device to call for aid in the occasion of grave injury”
To say that Draco was not looking forward to this weekend would be an understatement. He had barely slept, worried that his body was too weak to cope with the amount of exercise he was expected to do. As well as the obvious effects of the war, being held at the ministry awaiting trial as a growing boy boy, and being fed prison food had left him somewhat malnourished, and he had only just started to build his body back up to wear it should be as an eighteen year old involved in competitive sports for the whole of his secondary school career.
“if I look ridiculous Parkinson, I will blame you” harry said, but when he looked in the mirror, he had to concede he looked really rather striking.
Harry carefully lined his lash lines with Kohl. While makeup was typically seen to be a ‘gay’ thing for men, Kohl was worn by some Indian men, most notably for harry, his father. This made the ritual of getting ready extra special for Harry as he carefully applied the black cosmetic to his eyes. He then put in contacts, some lip-gloss and his face was done. Now the magic (pun not intended) happened. Harry braided small sections of his shoulder length curls, and clipped golden beads to the braids, so his hair seemed to glitter in the low light of clubs and bars.
But Draco didn’t miss it. He was all in. He moved so that he was once again sitting in Harry’s lap. Harry’s hands immediately moved to rest on the smaller man's hip, unconsciously chewing his bottom lip.
“KINGSLEY.” Harry’s voice was tight and full of ice. Any other man would have paused at the implied threat in Harry’s tone, but Kingsley was no ordinary man.
“Harry, is everything ok? You look...well let’s not sugar coat it. You look like hell. I’m assuming the trial went poorly?”
It was two o’clock on a Tuesday, when the wind chime above the door signaled to Gary the arrival of a customer. The timing was odd—the store rarely had customers during the work week, particularly during work hours. Truly, Gary only kept the store open for lack of anything else to do. He walked out from the back room where he had been sanding down an end table to greet the customer, running a hand through his thick black hair. There was dust all over his light blue jeans that had seen better days—wear at the knees had produced the beginnings of holes, not to mention the splotches from paint and wood stain. His black t-shirt was similarly splotched but thankfully exhibited no holes. His black Converse trainers were actually brand new—if only because his last pair had finally separated from the soles.
Draco’s senses were overloaded. Harry smelled amazing; a mix of wood shavings and spice invading his nostrils. The man's dirty words whispered against his skin was intoxicating, mixing with the overwhelming feeling of the firm body and hard cock rutting against him, teeth and tiny kisses along his jaw and in the hollow point under his ear. Draco wasn’t going to last.
Harry groaned from his seat at the other end of the couch. He hung his head back over the edge and covered his face in his hands. “I could kill you, Kings. I really could.”
“Well, I can confidently say that he does not struggle with it anymore. In fact, there are few things Harry struggles with sexually.” Draco’s mouth dropped open at the way the man openly appraised Harry.
A slight blush crossed Harry’s cheeks as he continued, “But the biggest issue was the sex. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t bad. He’s a phenomenal lover. But he prefers to top. And so do I. We took turns, and it was good, but never great. If the person you’re topping isn’t enjoying it as much as you are, it kind of ruins the experience. Towards the end of our relationship, I was finding it so hard to finish even when I was topping. About two weeks before we broke up, we were having sex and he was on his knees while I took him from behind. It was like he was performing a job duty. No moans, no excitement, nothing. He wasn’t even hard. I found myself wondering what it would be like to fuck someone who wanted it, so there I am fucking my boyfriend imagining myself fucking someone else. The image started innocent enough—just a vocal bottom begging me to fuck them. Then I had a fistful of blonde hair in one hand, and the other grasping a pale hip. It took me too long to figure out I was imagining fucking you. When I did realize it, I came harder than I had in months. It even took Kingsley by surprise. I made up some excuse about a different angle. For the next two weeks, every time we were intimate I imagined it was you I was with. Even when I was alone, it was you I was picturing.”
Harry snorted. “He’s always right. It’s an annoying habit of his.” He wrapped an arm around Draco, pulling the slim figure closer, surprised at the deep feeling of comfort that washed over him while cuddling his childhood nemesis. What a strange turn of events that brought them here.
“Oh I’m sure you’ve been able to keep your identity hidden from most of the press. Though I have to imagine that dear old Rita has studied your face enough to see through that charm from a quidditch pitch away. And yet, the Prophet has left “Gary Trotter of Muggle London” almost entirely alone.” Draco paused for dramatic effect, raising one eyebrow, “Do I detect Ministry interference?” There was a slight, but clearly evident, edge of snark to the question.
It was all the confirmation Draco needed. He closed the fractional distance between their lips, his hands twisting in the black mess of hair, his hips salaciously grinding against the body beneath him. Draco had no time for sweet or soft. He wanted the frantic dance of lips, and teeth, and tongues winding together. Draco just
“I’m kidding Harry. I’m not mad. I’m not upset. In fact, I’m highly amused. And quite pleased with myself for being so right for so long.” The Minister stood from the couch, smoothing out invisible wrinkles from his elegant plum robes, and making his way towards the floo. He grabbed a pinch of the powder from the mantel and turned back towards the two men. Harry had his elbows on his knees, his head down, and hands clasped behind his neck. Kingsley could tell the man was tense, and he knew it couldn’t have just been the teasing.
Harry couldn’t help but blink a few times at the normally proud woman’s humble demeanor. “Narcissa, this is your home, if you wish to speak to me, it would be I who is honored.” One of Harry’s best kept secrets was his knowledge of pureblooded customs—something he picked up in a book. A book he found one sleepless night at Grimmauld place in the early days of the hunt. A book that had yet to prove its usefulness.
Harry laughed with the man as he stood. “Thanks for trying to help Kingsley. I really appreciate it, but I think I’m going to have to work through this one on my own.” Harry held out his hand as Kingsley stood and made his way around the desk.
But the most impressive part, was the what Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from. While entirely average in length, the cock standing proudly against a neatly trimmed tuft of black curls was thicker than Draco had imagined a cock could be. A look of mild concern soon mixed with the lustful expression on his face.
“Well, a man can tell when he’s not wanted. Even if it does take him two years.” Kingsley winked at Draco with a devilish grin.
“What the actual fuck, Potter?!” Draco screeched, panic sowed into every syllable. A crazed, feral look settling in his eyes.
Harry pulled the blond down, meeting in a slow but passionate kiss. Where their first kiss was frantic, fueled by the fear of losing what was happening, this kiss was sure. Their lips and tongues dancing in a way that implied years of intimacy. The kiss lasted for quite some time, each man relishing the simple but deep pleasure of a good snog. It was when Draco broke the kiss to catch his breath, forehead resting against the brunet's, that Harry asked “you ready?”
He needn’t have worried. “Sure. Don’t see what ya want to talk to that death eater scum for though.” The man’s distaste for Malfoy was more than evident.
. The focal point was the large marble fireplace, this time white with a breathtaking black vein, which had also roared to life upon Harry’s entrance. Above the fireplace was a large portrait of the Malfoy family—all wearing matching looks of “why yes, we are better than you.” Harry tried to hide his snort of amusement as he plopped down into one of the chairs. A gesture he was sure the chair was unaccustomed to.
The two men were motionless for a moment, catching their breaths. Harry gently pulled out of Draco and collapsed on to the bed next to him, pulling the blond into a tight embrace. The two lay in silence, Harry’s nose buried in Draco’s hair, enjoying the scent that was distinctly Draco—cottony, musky, and a hint of citrus.
“Well. I saved Draco from the Fiendfyre during the battle. He definitely would have died if I left him. I mean, Crabbe did. But before that, while I was here, he refused to identify me. He saved my life.”
Draco ducked his head again, staring down at his wringing hands. His voice was barely a whisper when he finally spoke. “Why’d you disappear, Harry?” And there it was. The question. The topic that hung heavy between them. It hadn’t taken long, apparently Draco Malfoy was a man on a mission.
“Unfff you’re so fucking sexy Draco.” Harry growled as he started slowly fucking the vocal blond beneath him. “You’re so fucking tight and I love how you beg me for it. Oh fuuuuck,
“They’re called Tiffany lamps. They’re quite rare and sought after in the Muggle community.” Harry answered Draco’s unasked question as he walked into the sitting room with two cups of tea, cream, and sugar.
“What if he ends up actually being the man you argued he could be? Harry. I may have been young during the first war, but I did live through it. I remember the aftermath especially well. The Ministry made examples out of everyone it possibly could. There were plenty of wizards and witches who could have been shown the light, but instead they were punished harshly. Time in Azkaban does not make people question their actions, Harry. It makes them angry, bitter. It pushes them deeper into the dark. People like Draco are difficult cases. On the one hand he absolutely committed war crimes. I will not deny that. But on the other, he was raised by one of Voldemort’s most trusted lieutenants.  He was never given any choices. Yes, he was coddled and spoiled rotten—but only to the extent he agreed with his father. Lucius Malfoy was an unforgiving man, especially with his own son. Draco was expected to follow his father's orders without question. The slightest hint of hesitation was met with abject cruelty—something I believe you and he have in common. Harry, Draco was raised in complete darkness, and yet, when faced with opportunities in which he was able to choose for himself, he reached for the light. At risk of great personal sacrifice. Draco has goodness in him, Harry. I believe this is what he needed. Someone to believe that the goodness exists. That the belief came from you, his arch rival for all intents and purposes, I believe carries a great deal of weight.”
Draco moved across the room, with a grace similar to that of his mother. Definitely takes after Narcissa, Harry thought as the blond man delicately dropped into the seat his mother had recently vacated.
After the Battle of Hogwarts, there had been weeks of funerals, trials, and interviews. It was overwhelming for Harry. Never one to enjoy the spotlight, Harry found the increased attention after the war to be doubly unwanted. He had lost too much to feel anything other than empty. And so it was he decided to leave the isles in search of something, anything, really. Himself, as Hermione had astutely pointed out at the time.
Harry startled to attention, giving away the answer without saying anything. Of course there was more to this. It was Draco sodding Malfoy they were discussing, after all. When it came to Malfoy, there was always more to it. What that more was, at that moment, Harry wasn’t entirely sure of. And he certainly wasn’t about to parse it out with Kingsley.
But that was not the case for Gary Trotter. No, for Gary the minutes had very quickly turned into years, passing by in a blur. It had not been an unpleasant blur, however. The years had flown by marked by a warm comforting feeling of repetition and simplicity. Gary had decided to embrace the simple life and it had embraced him right back, and for the life of him he couldn’t find himself regretting a single super sonic second of it.
Harry laughed as he too shifted on the sofa, slouching back against the arm, lifting his legs to rest his feet on the table in front of the sofa. He was clearly far more at ease now that the impulse to jump Draco was somewhat satisfied. “Alright Blondie, fire away. What do you want to know?”
"Well, he does everything I say, really. I mean, he has a safe word in case what I say is too much but he’s never used it. If he disobeys me, he gets punished. Spankings, orgasm denial, that sort of thing. He loves dirty talk so that’s a big part of it, like with a bit of humiliating edge.”
“Potter, stop massaging my feet or we’ll get nothing done.” Draco pulled his feet away from the man's lap and shifted so he was sitting cross-legged instead.
Harry groaned and dramatically threw himself back against the sofa. His head hanging over the back, as he covered his face with his hands once again. “I can’t Draco. It’s not fair to you. I get that you’re not gay and that you don’t want me, and that you're just here to hash out my inexcusable behavior." He sighed heavily, "but even after all these years when I’m near you my whole body just hums with electricity and it gets harder and harder to pretend it doesn’t exist...ughhh. What??”
“Oh.” Harry was looking at the hands he had clasped in his lap. He wasn’t sure when he had started wringing them, but he assumed it was at the point when his life got a whole hell of a lot more complicated.
Harry froze. He couldn’t find the words. He didn’t feel like he had been hexed. But he also had no idea what she had just cast on him. He couldn’t believe he could be so stupid….
“You’re the first person to walk in today, Draco. I think I’ll be ok,” he said as he began to move through the store motioning for Draco to follow him.
“Have fun, Harry.” If Harry had turned around, he would have seen that Hermione had a look, the type of look that told said she had figured out this particular issue long before Harry had. Considering Harry still had no idea what was going on, that really wasn’t surprising.
Harry looked up from his lap where he had been intently watching his hands. Draco’s eyes were slightly dilated, his cheeks red. He took a steadying breath before he asked Harry, “so what happened?”
Harry shook himself when he noticed Narcissa had begun to move through the hall. He was having a hard time not gawking at the splendor of the Manor. The last time, or well the only time really, he had been to the Malfoy residence he had been far too focused on other things. Like staying alive.
“Actually, I thought it was you who would have something to say to me.” There was that dickhead attitude again. This time however, Harry knew exactly why he was acting that way. It was Malfoy after all. Despite all that had transpired between Harry and the Malfoy matriarch over the last hour, he couldn’t seem to help himself. He would rise to the bait every time. And well, if he was lashing out due to his own surprising gratitude for Malfoy’s health, no one needed to know.
Draco’s hands were now in Harry’s hair, his face hovering just above the man beneath him, his words ghosting over the other man's soft, plump lips. “I have waited for four years to find out if you still want me. So... Harry,” Draco’s lips moved impossibly closer to Harry’s, “do you still want me?”
As Harry began to make his way to the doors leading out of the sitting room, he stopped abruptly and turned. “Wait, I forgot something.” Harry drew his wand and pointed it at the other man.
Draco lifted himself of the broad chest, and interrupted. “Yes, Potter. I’m aware of the effect I have on other men. Excuse me for not bending over for every slag that made a pass.” His embarrassment made him revert to his snarky attitude. He crossed his arms and glared at the dark haired man. The effect was quite lost however, due in large part to the fact he was still snuggled up against the object of his ire.
Amazingly, Harry’s eyes somehow widened and narrowed at the same time. The effect was intent interest directed at Draco. “How can you be so sure?” Harry didn’t notice that he licked his lips in a gesture of pure desire.
With a loud crack, Harry landed on his feet just outside the gates of Malfoy Manor. Well, mostly on his feet. He may have stumbled just a bit. Maybe.
“I’m sorry Harry.” Draco wasn’t exactly sure what he was sorry for in that moment, but he assumed it was something close to everything.
“I never asked for your help, Potter.” Draco whipped around to face Harry, finger pointing accusingly. “Have you ever thought of that? Have you ever once thought what it must feel like to have you constantly swoop in and save me from myself? Every time I fuck up you’re there. Saving the day. Saving me. Do you have any idea what it feels like? Even the slightest clue as to how I feel right now?”
“Second, thank you for your testimony on my behalf. Though I did not have the dark mark, I am certain that if not for your testimony, an example would have been made, and I would have been sent to Azkaban much like my husband.”
“Look, Malfoy--Draco. I’m not here to argue. I’m also not here to make you feel any type of way about your choices, past or present. Despite what you clearly think, I don’t believe I’m better than you, or anyone else for that matter.”
“You aren’t the only fifth year in this room, Potter. And don’t whine to me about four years, I’ve been dreaming of that since fourth year.”
Draco made a face at the other man. “Funny, Potter. Where to start, where to start." He playfully tapped his chin. "I guess let’s try some ‘safe’ territory. Explain the wandless nonverbal magic.”
“Can life debts cancel each other out, like someone saved my life, but a few weeks later I saved his life, would that put us back at zero?”
The responding laugh was hot against his backside. “The charm is great for quick fucks in the loo, but for your first time, I’m going to make sure you properly enjoy the experience.” At that, an impossible fourth finger was pressed against his entrance. Draco groaned at the pressure of the pointed hand stretching him beyond the point he had ever been stretched before. The hand stilled waiting for him to adjust. When Draco pushed his hip backs, the hand started to move again, fucking him slowly, the fingers now moving inside him stretching him impossibly wider. After what felt like an eternity, but was likely no more than a few minutes, the hand was slowly drawn out.
The shop had previously been owned by an elderly couple. It had been known as Violet’s Vintages at that time, but when Violet had passed, her husband John found he couldn’t keep it going. It was too much to take on without her—he had told Gary that he saw Violet in every piece in the store and that the pain was too raw to handle. John had said he needed to get away. That was a feeling that Gary understood implicitly.
“I was hoping that you’d at least be a little appreciative, but I guess that’s too much to ask for.” Harry bit out, his confusion at the turn of events causing his anger to boil again.
While Harry had traveled and Ron joined the auror corps almost immediately, Hermione in her never ending pragmatism had chosen to return to Hogwarts to finish her education.  She had finished her final NEWTs exam the week prior and had been rotating between staying with her parents and at the Burrow since. It had been quite the ordeal tracking down Mr. and Mrs. Granger after the war, or at least that was what Ron and Hermione had written in their letters. In the two months between the final battle and returning for her eighth year, Hermione had set off to Australia to restore her parents memories, with Ron in tow. Though it had taken just a few short weeks to locate the Grangers, it took quite a bit more to restore even the faintest memory of Hermione. Indeed, the Grangers enjoyed a lengthy stay in St. Mungo's before their memories were deemed completely in tact--just days before the Christmas hols. To say they were not best pleased with their daughter was an astonishing understatement. But, as time ticked on the relationship was mending and according to Hermione, the Granger family was "stronger than ever."
It didn’t make sense, though. They had barely touched all evening until they left and then came back, and it was like a switch had flipped. They could barely keep their hands-or mouths- off each other. Then they had stumbled off to their room, followed about an hour later by Ron and Hermione.
Narcissa beamed when he gave her the photo, holding it to her chest in much the same way that she had held Teddy.
Draco groaned. His head felt like it had been sat on by a hippogriff, and Harry was way too chipper for early in the morning. He said as much, his tongue feeling like lead in his mouth.
“Right. I hope you don’t think I’m stereotyping, these are just genuinely my favourites” she said very sincerely, as if Draco would be offended she only bought chic flics because he was gay. She had brought with her Pitch Perfect, 10 things I Hate About You, It's a Boy Girl thing, and some others that Draco hadn’t seen before.
“come on Blondie. You invited me to stay. Talk to meeeee” Harry whined, clearly putting it on to distract Draco from his accidental confession. It should have made him angry but it didn’t. Harry never made him feel the things he was supposed to feel.
Draco smiled. He hadn’t smiled sober in a long time. Once the food was eaten and Draco felt sick from the sugar, he felt Potter’s hand on his neck, gently coaxing him down until Draco’s head was in Potter’s lap, face turned towards the window. He felt Potter’s hand stroke though his hair, and he sighed happily. He felt Potter move and then felt a soft kiss on his cheek. He didn’t know anyone, let alone Potter, was capable of such gentleness, especially not towards someone who had done what Draco did.
How wrong they had been. He had cried for the duration of Ron’s explanation, of cupboards and starvation and abuse.
“Draco, the cottage is yours for forever if you want it. I’ll get Hermione to show you how to use UCAS if you're serious about this. If you want to go this year it would have to be a late application, which doesn’t guarantee a place, or you could go through clearing?” Sirius asked, saying a lot of words Draco vaguely remembered from year thirteen.
Soon the hot chocolate was made, and Draco was reclining on a sofa with his little book of Shakespearean sonnets, wondering how he was supposed to wax poetic about his favourite without coming off as too gay to his English teacher. After reading through his four top favourites, and deciding on sonnet 116, he heard the door open and looked up to see Harry and Rugby boy 1 walk in, deep in conversation. Harry’s brow was furrowed, and he looked deeply troubled.
So, if this starts to slow down to less than every week know that I'm sorry. But if I keep getting Kudos and comments, I'll keep writing and posting!
Harry was stunned into silence once again. This was not the Malfoy he knew. The nervousness and vulnerability on display was wholly inconsistent with the man that Harry had known since he was eleven. He finally mustered the presence of mind to ask a question. Not THE question of course, but a question. “Why are you here?”
Before Harry could think too much on that, Draco broke into his reverie. “Harry....There’s something I should tell you..”
The tension in Harry’s shoulders lessened just a bit at Kingsley’s words. Kingsley had a way of making people feel at ease, it was part of the reason he rose through the auror ranks so quickly. It was also part of why at just 30 years old, Kingsley was elected the youngest Minister of Magic. The fact he had actually been the youngest Minister at 29 when he stepped in as the acting Minister following the war, was neither here nor there. Harry had always been fond of Kingsley, but now counted the man amongst his closest friends. A year of owling will do that, apparently.
The blond quirked an eyebrow, “is that so, Potter? And if I don’t? Are you going to punish me?” He challenged, giving his cock one long stroke before stilling his hand, but not removing it from his length.
“Harry Potter. Did you sleep with one of the Weasleys?? Wait. Two?? Did you ever sleep with Ginny?? Oh my god, did you manage to bed two of the seven??” Draco’s voice was brimming with mirth, clearly enjoying Harry’s embarrassment.
Narcissa lead Harry down to the end of the large room, to a set of French doors set in the center of the back wall. Stairs, mahogany of course, with white and silver runners, extended out of each of the back corners of the massive room.  She pushed the doors open and waved Harry inside. “Please, Mr. Potter, have a seat.”
“He is. Why don’t you follow me to the sitting room, and I’ll fetch him?” She stepped, floated really, to the side and allowed Harry entrance to the foyer of the Manor.
“Won’t you miss out on customers?” Draco asked rather innocently causing Harry to chuckle once again.
“Oh fuck Harry. I swear your cock is going to kill me, it feels so good. Ugh fuck me harry. Please.” Draco was already a panting, whiney, begging mess.
“Good. Because you’ll find I’m harder to get rid of than dragon pox. So what do you mean by an arrangement?”
Harry reached a hand out to gently stroke the sharp cheekbones, as he sat up. “But that’s for another time. Right now, I’m starving. I’ve somehow managed to work up quite the appetite. You hungry?”
Narcissa paused, and Harry seized the opportunity. “As much as I would like to disagree with you, I believe you are correct. Kingsley didn’t have the power then that he has now, and I couldn’t bear the thought of you in Azkaban. You saved my life that night. Something I have yet to thank you for. You risked everything to defy Voldemort in that moment. A moment that allowed me to win in the end. I doubt that I will ever be able to thank you properly, but thank you.”
“Potter, you’re naming people as if I should know who they are,” there was a slight irritation in Draco’s voice.
“FUCK POTTER. You have NO idea. None. Zero. Am I thankful that you saved my arse once again? That I’m not sitting in Azkaban right now? Obviously. OBVIOUSLY. But I just wanted once, just once, to be able to pay it back. To put us on even footing. The life debt was that opportunity. But nooooo, you couldn't even let me have that. The Great Harry Potter has made it his mission to save everyone from every thing—and if you want me to grovel at your feet and praise you for it, its never going to happen. You can fuck right off back to your Weasels if that’s what you’re looking for.”
“Delebitur anima debitum,” Harry incanted. The now familiar golden glow overtook the two wizards and settled into their skin.
He looked much the same, really, just tired—world weary, Harry supposed. Harry would have been able to see the dark purple hues under the man’s storm grey eyes from a kilometer away. His typically perfectly porcelain skin was almost translucent, a blue undertone from from too much blood showing through. The blues and purples causing the young wizard to look just this side of death. The notorious platinum blond hair had been cut since that morning’s trial—gone were the lank yellowed strands, matted to the pointy features from twelve months in a jail cell. Instead the white strands were cut to fall along the prominent jaw line, clean, and appeared soft enough that Harry had the urge to run his fingers through them. He was dressed casually, far more casual than Harry had seen in years. He wore a pair of black linen trousers that tied with a drawstring at the waist and a dove grey v-neck jumper, tucked in the front. The neckline of the jumper revealed the man’s collar bones, sharp, but not overly so. For a year in Azkaban, the man did not look too haunted or too starved. Harry caught himself feeling thankful for that, which only increased that uneasy feeling.
Draco blushed heavily. He hadn’t actually realized what he said. “Well, I, uh. Oh, bloody hell. In for a knut, in for a galleon, yeah? Yes, absolutely.”
“It went exactly as we planned. The rest of his sentence has been suspended in favor of parole. If Malfoy keeps his head down and obeys the law he’ll be a free man in four years.” Harry glanced up from his grass picking endeavor and gave Hermione a tight smile.
Harry bit his lip for a second as he thought. A second being all it took, as that uneasy feeling that had been plaguing him for the last two days propelled him to his feet.
Draco was reveling in the warmth of Potter's body. He had latched on to the other man like an octopus--his right arm and leg thrown over the golden muscled body to his left. His head was resting on the man's solid shoulder and Draco's long pale fingers were stroking the curly black tufts of hair that littered Harry's chest. The slow, quiet breathing and gentle thump of a heartbeat beneath his fingers was grounding. It was a level of intimacy that Draco was unaccustomed to, but was certain he could become addicted to. It had lulled Draco to a place in which he felt he could sate his curiosity, whisper his burning questions into this quiet intimacy and have them answered--free of judgment.
“I’m not your mate.” Harry really was being a grade A prick. He just couldn’t find the energy to like this guy. Something about him just wasn’t.....he just didn’t fucking like the guy.
Sat underneath the tree, Harry was still picking at blades of grass when Hermione arrived. Ron perked up at the sight of the bushy haired woman making her way quickly across the lawn.
Harry chuckled, he'd never tell the wizard (or maybe he would if it worked to his advantage), but he loved that the blond was jealous. It made Harry feel wanted and desired in a way he had not in a long time. "No, nothing for you to worry about Blondie." Harry bit his lip and reached out to gently tug on a lock of platinum. Dropping his hands to cover the pale one still working through his chest hair, he sighed. "Well in true slag fashion, one was a random one night stand with a muggle named Ben. He had bleached blonde hair.” Harry smirked. “He was less than a week after I ended it with Kingsley. Then there was Patrick. John's grandson." Harry huffed out a laugh. "Now there’s a true slag. There was never anything remotely romantic between us, but we had an, erm, arrangement for the last few months. I’ll actually have to end that now.”
“Because he knew about the incident between us. He knew about my arrangement with Patrick. He intentionally steered you, Draco.” Harry openly laughed.
“Shhhh. Harry, listen to me.” Draco removed his finger from Harry’s lips, taking the brunets head into his hands and lifting, ensuring Harry look at him. “You may have struggled with a sudden realization of being gay, but I have known that I was since the summer before fourth year. A combination of being repulsed by kissing Pansy at a garden party and a complete disinterest in the Veela at the World Cup pretty much cemented it for me. I didn’t push you away that night because I didn’t want you, Harry. I have always wanted you.”
“Oh sod off, Malfoy. I’ve just gotten lazy. The charm used to be much stronger. Although, you’d actually be surprised how many people 'who cared to know me' were fooled by the charm,” Gary, well, Harry actually, scoffed.
Hermione sat watching the exchange, the look of deep thought hardening on her face. Something which the two men seemed to be completely oblivious to. Something was tickling the back of her brain, some explanation for Harry’s sudden companionship with the Minister, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.
The two men chuckled their amusement, "Fair enough. This doesn't feel dangerous though, it just feels....unfinished, I think."
Draco’s mouth was suddenly dry. “Oh” was all he could manage as his head was filled with images of Harry’s nose pressed to his skin, his cock buried deep in his throat. If he hadn’t already cum twice in the last few hours, he’d have been hard as a rock.
Without breaking contact, Harry shifted them so that they were lying on the sofa, nestling between the blond's legs to continue his assault--one hand still firmly grasping the blond's bottom the other wound through silky white strands of hair. Draco wrapped one of his legs around Harry’s waist, pulling him down flush against his body. He actually did whimper when Harry’s cock finally rubbed against his. The other man answered with a groan and leaned down, whispering in this slight man's ear, "Fuck, Draco, you feel so good." He peppered open mouth kisses to the slender neck beneath him, "Do you feel how fucking hard you make me?" Harry ground his hips down, providing the delicious friction both men craved.
This chapter has taken me a really long time. When I first started writing this story months ago, I actually skipped this part because it was evading me and continued writing. I finally got it to work. AND. The next few chapters only need a bit of editing before they're good to go.
I am so sorry for the long wait. Unfortunately, I think it's going to be quite some time between chapters moving forward. I only have two or three more chapters prewritten, but they need extensive editing. Work has been crazy for me so finding the time to sit and write more chapters or edit the existing ones has been tough. I haven't abandoned this though, I promise!
I know cannon portrays Kingsley as much older. I liked him better in this story as older, but not too much older than Harry--I think I have it at about 11 years.
Draco rested his head against his forearms, he had never been so exposed to another person before. The heady feeling of exposure mixed with a jolt of surprise that caused him to jump, when he felt the hot wet heat of Harry’s tongue against his hole. He groaned as the man continued licking up and down his crack, circling the puckered skin around the opening. “Oh fuck” he ground out as the man's tongue breeched his body. His cock was positively throbbing as Harry tongue fucked his hole.
And reality crashed into him. Hard. Brutally. Like a deer in headlights, Harry stumbled back, wide-eyed and terrified.
Draco met the green eyes that were staring down at him lasciviously.  Harry raised his hand and with a quick flick of his wrist, Draco was naked—his clothing now folded neatly in a stack on top of table in the corner of the room. He whined at the casual display of magical power, “Harry...”
Draco was nuzzling his face against Harry’s bare chest. He was deeply sated and was on the brink of drifting off. “Harry, that was bloody amazing. I know I don’t have anyone to compare it to, but my gods.”
Harry looked up, impossibly green eyes meeting impossibly blue-- single nod to indicate Narcissa to continue.
Harry peaked at the blonde from between his arms. “You don’t have to call me anything. It’s only for a sub, to establish the power difference really.”
“Thanks 'Mione. As always, he said what needed to be said—not just what I wanted to hear. It helped, but I still can’t shake the feeling that something is just...not right. I don’t know what it is. But it just has me on edge. My instincts are telling me that something just isn't done here, and my instincts are rarely wrong."
“Perhaps. It depends on the situation. Death is fickle, and it truly takes a certain death to create a life debt.”
On that fateful day just four years ago, Gary Trotter emptied out his bank account and left behind his life of near constant tension and turmoil for the quiet life of a shopkeeper. Trotter’s Antiques was a quaint little store on a small side street in one of the more residential areas of London. Having grown up in a world in which everyone knew everything about his life, Gary very much appreciated the relative anonymity that a city like London provided.
Harry was taking his time preparing Draco. He knew how maddening it could be, but also knew that his girth required the effort. After several minutes of orally relaxing the man, Harry wandlessly lubed one of his fingers, pressing it gently into the other man. Draco’s breath hitched but quickly steadied as Harry’s finger worked its way inside of him. It wasn’t very long before a second finger was added. The fingers slowly fucking him, scissoring him open. Harry’s mouth was kissing sloppy wet kisses all over his back side, peppered with small bites that sent shivers up Draco’s spine.
“So naturally, now that it’s real, you’re second guessing yourself?” Hermione sat cross legged in front of the two boys.
Draco cleared his throat before he continued. “The back room is a veritable sex shop. All kinds of sexual toys and accessories you could think of. It’s where I got my dildos. There’s also all sorts of muggle pornography. Charlie helped George design a magical player that allows a wizard to watch the movies. DBPs I think they’re called.”
Narcissa smiled warmly at Harry. “In the last year, I have regained contact with my sister Andromeda. She had mentioned that the real Harry Potter was much more remarkable than anyone truly knew. I am pleased to see that she was correct. It also makes what I’m about to do sit that much better with my soul.”
“Alright, alright. Keep your pants on. Just don’t see why ya’d want to talk to him is all. But I s’pose I can take you to the door. ‘Sup to him if he wants to see ya though.” The young wizard waved his wand in front of the gates and started leading Harry down the long, meandering path to the door of the Manor.
Draco’s responding smile could only be described as weak. “Erm well, uh I’m, well...” he  finished his statement as he buried his face into Harry’s chest, the result being that Harry heard exactly none of it.
Draco’s face was overcome with an uncharacteristic look of shock that made Harry laugh. “Well it’s not everyday one can manage to crack that Malfoy mask. Should I be honored to have that effect on you, or have you become soft in your old age?”
“So, after four years of parole. Four years of attempting to be a better wizard. Four years of making amends. I was declared a free man at 10 o’clock this morning. And since I could finally travel freely, I apparated here to find out for myself just who Gary Trotter really was.”
“There was never any shortage of love between us. I still love Kings. I always will. But I don’t know that I was ever
"Have it your way. Anyway, after that he started coming round and while Kingsley really opened up doors for me accepting my sexuality, Patrick opened up doors for me to really explore my sexuality and determine what I like sexually, aside from knowing I’d rather top than bottom.”
Before Gary could gather his wits, the man broke the silence without turning. “So, Potter, tell me. How long were you planning on hiding away in the Muggle world, exactly?”
His mind wandered often to the conversations he and Hermione had after Ron had abandoned them. Hermione admitting her love for Ron, and Harry admitting he wasn’t sure he loved Ginny. He loved Ginny, he knew that even then, but he just wasn’t sure he loved her the right way.
“Oh fuck you, Potter. Make yourself useful and grab my wand from the table. I don’t quite fancy having sticky shorts,” Draco said as he playfully pushed at Harry’s chest.
Harry recognized it immediately.  “I promise I won’t hurt you. I’ll make sure you’re fully prepared first, and even then I’ll go slowly until you adjust. Okay?” The blond head silently nodded. “Good. Now, on your hands and knees for me, love.”
Draco snorted. He was well versed in interfering family members. The “from the heart” bit was foreign, however. “So yeah, Charlie steered me in that direction. And it definitely piqued my interest. I can’t say I’ll ever want to be as committed to it as your Patrick, but I definitely want to explore.”
The Minister's face disappeared to be replaced with the man himself stepping elegantly out of the fireplace.
Harry had listened intently to Kingsley’s speech. As always, he was impressed by the man's eloquence. But more so, Harry was impressed by Kingsley’s faith. Kingsley seemed so sure, absolutely certain even, that what had happened was the right thing. Harry found he couldn’t argue with him, despite the deep rooted desire to do just that.
“Everything.” Harry was no longer meeting the other man’s eye. He was focused solely on picking at invisible lint on his jeans. The jeans were new, chosen by Hermione. A dark blue wash that he (Hermione) paired with a long sleeved sage green t-shirt. The shirt was far too fitted for Harry’s comfort, but Hermione insisted that Harry had a body made to show off. He consented to wearing it to stop that topic of conversation before it picked up any more speed.
“As I’m sure you know from the Prophet, I apparated straight to Diagon and emptied one of my vaults at Gringotts. I exchanged it for Muggle money. I was acting purely on instinct and deep in my gut I knew I just needed to get out of the Wizarding world for a while. I always hated being the Savior," Harry practically sneered the title, "and being the center of attention was never my thing. And in that moment, all I could think about was how the world would react when they found out their Savior was gay and went around forcing himself on straight men. All the news, all the press, all the attention. I was so uncomfortable with it all that I needed time and space to sort through it on my own." Green eyes were flitting about the room, desperately trying to meet grey. "I stopped at Kingsley’s office to let him know my half formed plans, and he helped me find this place and set up some wards. Like I said, Hermione had that tracking charm on me, so her and Ron knew pretty quickly. I didn’t even tell Ron and Hermione why I left for a long time, but they know now.”
“Uh, no. He hasn’t. The last he said, he was struggling with his sexuality and that’s part of why he disappeared.”
“Ermmm, well. Patrick is a submissive, and I help him out." Harry shrugged, or shrugged as much as he could in his current position. "It all started when I ran into him at a muggle gay club. It was leather night.” He looked Draco in the eyes, lust clearly evident. “I love leather. You’d look amazing in a pair of leather trousers you know.” Draco blushed. Partly because of Harry’s remark and obvious desire, partly because he already owned a pair that did, in fact, look amazing.
Harry slowly pushed his cock in to the blond. He moved agonizingly slow, pausing frequently to let the man adjust to his thickness, so it took a couple minutes before he was fully seated. “Are you okay, love?” He asked the whining blonde beneath him.
I'm still hoping that I can post to this at least once a week (particularly since the next few chapters are written, though not edited), but my work life is very demanding right now (I'm an attorney IRL) and I haven't had a ton of time to really devote to this.
Harry took a curious glance around the room. The mahogany walls continued into the sitting room, but the dark intensity was broken by torches every few feet which had flared to life when Harry had entered. There was a dark, green carpet that was so thick his shoes sunk into it as he walked. Black leather couches and chairs were situated around the room,
Harry’s grunts, groans, and filthy words added to the pleasure that was overwhelming Draco. His cock was leaking sticky streaks against the comforter. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry had just been lucky enough to find the angle straight away, or if Harry’s cock was so thick he didn’t need to angle, but every stroke brushed Draco’s prostate causing him to moan wantonly. “Uhhh Harry. Oh gods, you feel so good. Yes, please, oh god, fuck me, harder,” the string of words tumbled from Draco’s mouth as he was driven closer and closer to orgasm.
Harry laughed again, a part of him surprised at how easy it was to just be around Draco. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Blondie,” Harry spoke the nickname playfully, drawing a frown in response, “but I’ll have you know that I have read every single book on those shelves. I’ll admit a good amount
