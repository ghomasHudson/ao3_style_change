When he emerged from the bathroom, Harry looked at him from the bed.
He realised after some time that he knew exactly where he was. Back in school, he had come here once a year to celebrate Pansy's birthday with her family. She was a creature of habit, and as far as he knew, she continued to celebrate her birthday in the same upscale pub—The Wandmaker's Arms.
He forced a small smile, picking up his lukewarm cup of coffee. "I won't. I promise."
A chorus of cheerful voices came near and paused next to his cubicle. Congratulations erupted amid the laughter and calls for celebration.
"So, how come you haven't been to any of the restaurants around here?" Potter asked. He'd decided to approach Draco as soon as he entered the shop the very next day.
Draco slammed the door and bolted it shut, then absently put clothes on.
It hurt to leave this place, but that wasn't Draco's fault. Harry just needed time.
Draco walked blindly towards the voice, along with numerous footsteps. Bodies jostled him as he got closer, and everyone squeezed through the door in a clumsy pack.
"Certainly," Robards said. "Now, I'd like a private word with Malfoy."
Moments later, Potter jerked his hips upwards one last time, and he cried out as his own climax overtook him. Draco was glad he came first—he could focus on Potter's head thrown back into his pillow and the way he held onto Draco's thighs for dear life. Draco caressed the tops of Potter's hands and watched as he rode out his orgasm. It was gratifying and impressive to see how good he could make Potter feel.
Potter was happy to oblige. He took Draco's cock into his mouth again and began caressing his balls with his free hand. Jolts of pleasure coursed through Draco, and he couldn't help bucking his hips slightly.
Fortunately, he was ready.
Potter balanced the shopping awkwardly and reached out to shake her hand. "I'm Ha—Henry. Singer."
But at least he was occupied. At least he left Draco alone, for the most part. He hadn't needed to talk about Lawrence any more, which was a relief.
Pierce. Draco could think of no quicker way to spoil a morning.
"It was a very low-risk thing, trust me."
"I just want to get home, that's all."
Harry stood, rubbing his arms. "Well, I'm freezing. Let's talk about this at home."
"That's not true. You're keeping me safe." Potter reached for Draco's hand.
"Oh, hullo," said Potter, who didn't look at all angry to have had his peace disturbed. In fact, he had the gall to smile.
"Have you been
"That's good, right?"
"Sorry."
Draco climbed on top of him again and pressed their foreheads together. He took Potter's hand and guided it back until Potter's fingers pressed against him.
"Robards said I should ask you to help me audit the departmental budget reports."
Draco thought for a moment. "No."
"Shall I make tea?" he asked.
A relationship.
Draco removed them from the bottom of the wardrobe, then began creating neat piles of clothes on the bed. Harry joined him, bringing a stack of Draco's books from the living room that toppled over as soon as he set them on the bed.
He gave up and instead curled up on the sofa with a book called
"Aren't you hot?" Harry asked as they stepped inside and removed their shoes.
"We've been lost for almost an hour!"
Merlin, all these years and the man had never learnt how to deliver bad news. It was almost comical. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Fancy meeting you here."
He blamed it on Potter, who was the cause of his insomnia in the first place. Potter also had the bed that week, and Draco slept miserably on the sofa.
. Does it bother you?"
Draco took it and walked to the kitchen in a daze. He filled the kettle to the top and leant against the counter whilst he waited for it to boil.
Usually, Whitby gave a great laugh and said, "You got me there." This time, he screwed up his face in concern.
Potter narrowed his eyes, then flipped his cards over to reveal a pair of nines and a pair of queens.
Draco tried to keep his expression neutral and exchanged a look with Harry. Technically, it didn't matter what they said, but it still felt odd.
Harry swept the books and clothes onto the floor. "There." He spun Draco around and pushed him onto the bed before he could complain.
"Oh, where are my manners!" she said. "Let me help you." And before Potter could protest, she had her arms full of their shopping.
Draco nodded. There were microscopic flecks of gold in the potion. "How many others here know?"
"Where are you going?" Potter asked.
Surely Robards knew that.
A swish of scarlet robes flew past the cubicle opening, and Draco nearly dropped his wand. He froze, hardly daring to breathe, and listened for any hint of who was here.
Draco shook his head. "It's been five years. You've done enough."
He and Harry had made memories here. They'd always remember them, even if the Muggles here wouldn't.
"Then perhaps you'd best not report it." Potter had the gall to look innocent.
"I guess so."
Draco walked over to a nearby table, taking in Potter's notebooks and various stacks of papers. "So you've been working here," he murmured. He ran his hand over the top of a chair.
Potter made a face and finished his cup of tea. "How would you feel about going somewhere else?"
Draco groaned.
"They're the best, and they've got nothing after a week where someone tried to murder the Boy Who Lived."
"I'd like to know your whereabouts on the seventh of August. It was a Sunday."
Draco was restless.
Robards looked at Draco through narrowed eyes for a long moment. "I underestimated you."
"I'm fine." Potter cocked his head. Draco shifted his feet. "You look cold."
Draco waited until the sound of his footsteps faded before daring to move again. As quickly and deftly as possible, he worked to restore the enchantments to the secret compartment in MacDonald's desk. Then he poked his head over the cubicle wall.
Draco fought hard to keep from blushing. That wasn't going to be a problem.
A ball of dread formed in the pit of Draco's stomach. Perhaps it was time to consider contacting Robards. He'd certainly get sacked for this, but that hardly seemed to matter any more.
Draco turned his head and felt his cheeks heat at the look on Harry's face. He shifted so they faced each other and loosely encircled his arms around Harry's shoulders.
He nodded, and the bed shifted as Potter got out. Only when Draco felt certain the tea was ready did he throw the covers back and saunter into the kitchen.
For all that Draco did notice, however, none of it was useful in determining how Potter felt about him.
"I already said I'd do it," Draco muttered.
And it did make him feel better.
"I've never done this before," Potter murmured, "so tell me what I should do."
"That's not what Robards wrote in my evaluation."
"Oh, turn here," Harry said, and Draco turned sharply. "That's it, I'm driving the rest of the way."
Draco looked into his bowl of porridge. It was their last breakfast here. They'd decided to go back to Harry's flat in London after the celebration that night.
Draco made the short walk from his cottage to his bookshop, where he unlocked the door and brewed the first pot of coffee that morning. After a long winter, warm weather seemed like it was finally here to stay, for a while at least.
"Hey, no, you can't go to sleep yet. Here."
He'd decided, as he smoothed his hair in the mirror that morning, that he was going to get to the bottom of this.
It was maddening. Especially when Draco considered that Potter had even started getting under
Draco stepped towards him, thinking about how he'd like to wipe the smirk off his face with his fist.
Barclay? Draco straightened to look over the cubicle wall, holding the Invisibility Cloak tightly around himself.
Draco nearly dropped his bags and slowly craned his neck to see who had greeted them. A short, dumpy woman with mousy brown hair waved and smiled as she took long strides to cross the street towards them. Draco stood rooted to the spot, hoping against all odds that she perhaps had only seen Potter.
But Draco had to start somewhere.
"Stop! Please!"
Jeremy grinned. "I can imagine. Listen, I wanted to ask you two over for dinner on Monday."
"Well, we have to keep up appearances." Someone else would have sat down eventually, Draco reasoned. At least he was used to eating with Potter.
The faint smell of peaches filled his nose, and for a moment, he almost dared to hope.
Draco grudgingly took his hand and led him into the kitchen.
"Do you want to do it again sometime?" His hand inched its way up Draco's thigh.
"I don't think so. I've come this far already."
"Breakfast?" Potter whispered.
Whitby did not look amused. "You need to eat more. I expect you're having difficulty keeping warm?"
"I'm not sure," he finally said.
"He tampered with the Ministry safe house files. There was an access entry dated the 2nd of September," Draco said. "And no, we can't go back home. He knows where we are!"
That evening, Draco lay on the sofa with his feet in Potter's lap.
"All our stuff's here," Draco said.
"Shut up."
In six years, nobody in the Ministry had ever been glad to see him.
"C'mon!" He grabbed Draco by the arm and pulled him onto the stage.
He spoke with Barclay before meeting with Robards and learnt that he'd been confined to desk work in Draco's absence.
Instead, he stretched his arm into the air and rotated it.
Harry was quite certain he had never experienced anything as deeply and as wholly as this. He spent hours in Draco's arms, lost to his senses and all concept of time as they made love on nearly every surface of his home night after night. He wasn't ordinarily a morning person, but since Draco had begun spending the night, Harry had woken up first every day. Draco was always burrowed against him, head tucked under Harry's chin, legs tangled together. His slow, heavy breaths against Harry's chest were a peaceful break in the silence. These drowsy, pre-dawn moments sometimes felt more intimate than the ones where Harry had Draco pinned to the bed, buried deep inside of him.
Draco turned his head and saw that Harry was already watching him. Could he see how desperate he felt?
He shifted uncomfortably. "We're not that close."
"Yes."
"What are you so afraid of?" Whitby suddenly became serious, and Draco tensed.
It was too much, and it was getting difficult not to say something.
"I suppose so. Hang on." Draco left Harry standing whilst he fetched his wand from the bedside table, then watched whilst Harry cast a spell at Pierce that caused bindings to appear around his wrists and ankles.
Rich autumn colours completely blanketed the countryside now, and the crisp, late October air was refreshing. Perhaps Harry wasn't completely off the mark.
"It doesn't matter. You're the one driving."
"And," Potter continued, "I'll take the sofa tonight."
Draco bent his head forwards to kiss Harry and shut him up. He ran one hand through Harry's messy hair and pressed the other against the small of his back.
"Yes." Draco vigorously dried a plate and set it aside.
"Not like we do in the wizarding world," Harry said.
Death Eater. And he hired me, didn't he?"
"Let me enlighten you. But first—" Pierce turned to cast the Cruciatus Curse upon Harry again, and Draco winced. He couldn't take much more of this, and neither could Harry. He had to find a way to incapacitate Pierce, or find a way to the bedroom where he could get Harry's wand from the bedside table.
On Wednesday, they went walking with Jeremy.
"I mean, I was with Ginny for a while, but I've never… with another man."
Potter had already returned and was in the rear corner nook as usual when Draco stumbled out of the store room and nearly collapsed into his chair.
Robards finished scanning the parchment he held and set it down, then sat back to prop his feet on his desk. "Tell me how things have been. The truth, now."
The breeze from outside and the smell of food cooking made for a pleasant atmosphere, and for a moment, Draco could almost pretend this entire situation wasn't so miserable. He leant back in the chair and closed his eyes.
"Have you been to any of the restaurants around here?"
Draco gave him a rude hand gesture and went back to his desk, where he rested his head against the cool wood. He was tempted yet again to hand in his resignation letter.
Of course, there was the problem of Potter. Though strangely, for some reason, he'd kept his word. He seemingly hadn't mentioned Draco to anyone.
By the end of the week, he had finished it.
"I'm sorry," said Whitby. "Sit down, please." He held a hand out, indicating the empty chair in front of his desk.
"Sleeping, Potter," Draco mumbled.
And frowned.
"Hmm," Draco said. It seemed strange that he could feel so at ease living in a Muggle village. He knew they weren't all bad, though. Jeremy was funny, and Emily made great cakes and biscuits. Plus, there were no Jaffa Cakes in the wizarding world.
But never Potter.
Unlike most other offices Draco had been in, Rutherford's was tidy. An in-tray and out-tray sat on his desk and nothing else, and none of the dark bookshelves were overflowing. There were no personal touches.
"Are you all right?" he whispered. It was surprisingly difficult to keep his voice steady.
It just figured that the one opportunity to come his way involved Potter. And wasn't it ironic that he needed protecting? Draco had made no secret of his dislike for Potter. And although they rarely interacted in the office, he was quite certain the feeling was still mutual, even if it was no longer as bad as it had been at Hogwarts.
"You didn't miss anything," Potter added. "It was really old. And there's no sugar here. Or milk."
Draco donned his Barbour jacket before leaving the cottage each morning and stepped through thick patches of wet leaves on his way to and from the book shop.
Harry shook his head and got up, pocketing the piece he'd been trying to place. Draco was probably trying to carry everything in one trip.
It was a relief to know Robards wouldn't pick him to track down the would-be infiltrators. He couldn't help but roll his eyes when Pierce and Morrell were chosen, though. No doubt a promotion was in their near future.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I had my one-to-one with Robards."
He felt a twinge of guilt about skiving off the auditing work. Barclay had turned into a shell of his former self over the last two weeks, and he often said how he looked forward to Draco helping him out on Fridays.
The bedroom door opened, and Potter strode out looking well-rested. He looked at Draco and did a poor job of hiding his amusement.
"Oh yeah?" Harry sat down next to him, and Draco grasped his hand.
"You asked what I want you to do."
"This is all your fault," he snarled.
Couples occupied nearly every table around him. Luckily, they were all too busy with each other to witness his humiliation.
"We have a problem," Potter said. "Neither of us can drive. And if we walk, we probably won't get home until morning."
For better or for worse, his depression had left him a bit lax when it came to security measures, and Hermione and Ron eventually found him in 12 Grimmauld Place.
Draco shrugged. "I reckon that depends on your definition of 'good'."
"Harry," Hermione said softly, but he didn't answer.
Draco glared.
Had Draco noticed? Perhaps, subconsciously, he had. Maybe that was why he'd felt so guilty. Potter wouldn't care about him if he knew he was dying. And Draco wouldn't blame him.
But for a fleeting moment, his turmoil had quietened, and he could enjoy this.
He lay next to Draco on the bed, stroking his hair, watching the slow rise and fall of his chest as he slept. Sunlight poured in through the windows, and Harry could almost pretend they were back in his cottage, just waking up. This couldn't be it, surely. Not when they'd barely said good morning to each other.
With other people surrounding them, dancing became more tolerable, and Draco felt himself relax as Potter led him around. This would end.
"Shout it to the entire department, please. Make sure everyone knows."
"I'm okay," Harry lied. He imagined Draco in that chair, and he just couldn't. "I just wanted to return this." He placed the tin on the edge of the desk and slid it towards Whitby. "Thanks, by the way," he mumbled. "For helping him."
"I reckon they'd be somewhere in the Department of Mysteries."
Even when they walked to and from the bookshop together, Harry could see. As summer had progressed and now neared its end, the 15-minute walk had become a 20-minute walk, and then 25 minutes, since Draco needed to pause and sit once or twice along the way.
Before he could process the words that came to his mind, Draco said, "You don't have to."
Friday was busy. Harry had to rush to meet with Rosemary about a last-minute situation that arose with the caterers, and he was gone all afternoon. When he returned home, he was exhausted and in a poor mood, so they ordered takeaway pizza for dinner and watched Midsomer Murders before going to bed early.
He smiled. "I'll go make breakfast."
When the holidays came around, Draco closed the bookshop for an entire week. As he locked the door on the evening of the 23rd, he felt relief. No Potter for an entire week. That in itself was a gift. He hoisted a bag with enough potions to last him the week onto his shoulder and crunched through the snow in his new boots. It was a quiet, clear evening, and the moon illuminated his walk home.
Next morning, Draco sat at the kitchen table finishing his breakfast when Potter strolled in.
Draco tried to remember. "MacDonald and Jennings. I'm not sure who else. But everyone knows I'm undercover at the moment."
His heart sank. "Which little old lady—"
"Then Apparate." He started making his way to the door. Mrs. Wilder was going to kill him.
He took Harry's hand, and they strode off into a dark clearing. From a distance, the fireworks display was still visible, and he could just make out the top of the bonfire over the trees.
"Perfect, thanks," Potter smiled when he returned. Against his better judgement - perhaps it had been Potter's smile - Draco sat down again.
"We're married?" Potter croaked.
"Erm, why don't you get the tea?" Potter said to him. The kettle was ready, and there were already mugs and spoons on the kitchen table.
Potter only had to consider it for a moment before a grin broke out over his face. "Deal."
Draco sat in the tiny chair in front of his desk. The office was tiny, and its walls were lined with shelves that were crammed full of files, boxes, and books.
"Harry."
"I think we'll be fine," Harry said. "Besides, what if it's nothing? Then we'll have blown our cover and have to relocate."
Draco strained to see exactly what was so curious, but to no avail. "What is it?" he asked, trying to sound nonchalant, but his heart raced suddenly. This was it, he could feel it. He'd finally stumbled upon something meaningful.
There was no easy way to phrase the question, and he glanced at Potter. His mouth was screwed up in thought, and his eyes were fixed on the ground.
"There's got to be a better way."
"Did you fall asleep?" Potter looked at him with an amused expression.
Potter was also much more tolerable whilst they cooked. He'd taught Draco a variety of basic skills and simple recipes. Food was a neutral topic of conversation, and to Draco's surprise, Potter wasn't half bad as an instructor.
Dinner was simple fare—baked chicken with mashed potatoes and a fresh salad—but Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd enjoyed a meal so much.
It certainly was convenient that Potter always wore joggers around the cottage. Draco pulled them off, as well as his hideous orange pants, then began lavishing attention everywhere except his erection—he could play this game as well. Draco waited until Potter squirmed with need before finally sucking lightly on the head of his cock and swirling his tongue around it, eliciting a sharp cry.
"I'm—I'm not entirely certain. Yet. But I know it's an Auror who's after Potter."
"It was a good attempt," Lister said, and he looked back. "I hope you're paying attention, Malfoy."
All of Draco's other regulars made their daily or weekly appearances. A number of tourists paraded through, grateful to have somewhere quiet and warm to spend a cold and rainy afternoon.
As they sat at the table to eat, Draco thought he might try again to convince Potter to skip the ceilidh.
"We never talked, you know."
Draco cleared his throat. "Did you hear me?"
"What do you want?" Potter asked.
One of the perks of owning a bookshop was that Draco was in charge of inventory. After finishing his first book about constellations, he decided to expand the astronomy offerings in his shop and ordered several more.
He heard Harry fiddling with the lubricant, and in the next moment, he had positioned himself at Draco's entrance.
More footsteps came towards them. MacDonald and Jennings appeared.
That weekend, Draco visited the Manor, but his attempt at relaxation was thwarted by his parents, who argued with him at every turn to quit his job and move back to the Manor permanently to fulfill his familial obligations.
"Oh, I just had to say hello! So you're the new owners," she said, clasping her hands together.
Draco turned on the spot and Apparated before Potter could curse his mission any further.
"It was a while ago. He had to take a leave of absence, so I got reassigned to Lawrence."
"Not tonight." Draco drained his mug and went to the bedroom, where he rooted around the large shopping bag full of books until he found the crosswords. He sank into the armchair beside the open window and paged through all the puzzles that had 'Beginner' stamped on them.
Then again, with any luck, they wouldn't be here too long.
Draco walked towards the exit in a daze. They had to pretend. They had to put on a convincing show. Married couples kissed. Obviously. It was part of the job. He pressed a finger to his lips, and the image of Potter kissing him played through his mind.
"We want to stay at the cottage," Harry said.
And look how that had turned out. Potter cared about him. Potter, who always seemed ready with a smile, who didn't hold back when Draco made him laugh.
"How did you manage to find a place to buy here?"
Knocking drew him from his thoughts.
"Now there's a happy couple," the caller said into the microphone. "Let's do another waltz with the rest of the crowd. Couple up and have fun! Then we'll change tunes."
Finally, he said, "There's a room on Level Five where all restricted substances are stored that the Ministry have confiscated."
"So does everyone in Law Enforcement."
"I am aware." Jennings looked at the report again, as though that would change anything.
Still, it didn't seem fair that he should miss Potter so fiercely. They ate dinner together and talked - that was it. Sure, Potter was in the shop everyday, but he and Draco usually didn't see each other or speak until the shop had closed. Potter had always insisted on taking up space in the rear corner nook, which was as far away as possible from where Draco sat at the counter.
"I'll take as long as I need. Besides, you took all that time looking at fruit.
"But you can't dance," Draco said through gritted teeth. It was a weak excuse, but it was the only thing that came to mind.
Robards pursed his lips. He looked as though he wanted to shout, but when he finally spoke, his voice was eerily calm. "Go talk to them. And get out of my office."
After a few minutes, he put the empty jar into a box with other empty jars, wiped his face with a hand towel, and made sure to lock all the drawers.
It was a risk, and Draco only liked to take a risk if he felt reasonably certain of coming out ahead.
"You'll probably get a promotion for surviving," Draco said. "And I'll probably quit."
Harry thought his heart might beat right out of his chest. "So, what about dinner?" He couldn't keep from smiling.
"Is this good?" he murmured.
. "He's - he really is just a friend. I'm not with anyone right now." Or ever.
perspective." God, where the hell was their food?
"Is that why we're—"
"I care because it's where we are now, and we have no choice. Same reason I'm trying to get along with you, though you make it difficult sometimes."
"You're the one with the map."
"Good night then," said Potter.
"There's no way another car would fit on this road," he said. Lister hadn't prepared them for this.
Draco held out a hand, and Whitby clasped it in both of his to give one firm shake before he stood to leave.
The man held a hand up as though in defence. "I'm only a friend. We're supposed to go walking today, except he's late. Thought I'd check on him. I'm Jeremy."
Draco crossed his arms, impatient. "That's very fascinating."
"Now, where are you from? And what is it you two do?" Dorothy spooned a ghastly amount of sugar into her tea and sipped.
A muted explosion sounded whilst Draco poured water into his mug, and his mouth dropped open at the sight of steak and kidney pie splattered all over the microwave. This was the last thing he needed. He made a mental note to file a complaint against Lister next week.
All Draco had to do was make sure none of these enchantments would set off some sort of alarm. He'd also learnt a thing or two about breaking through pass phrases from his father, thankfully.
He felt so out of place amongst these Muggles, but thankfully, the quiz began and he could stop listening to Randall talk about the brawl he'd got into the previous night.
"I won't be long," she continued. "I just wanted to welcome you both. I live with my husband, Philip, two houses down."
Unfortunately, Draco didn't know the answers to any of the questions, and for some reason, everyone at the table thought he should.
Draco gave a curt nod and watched as he turned on the spot and vanished with a crack. He stared at the clearing for several minutes, then looked up at the sky. He tried to find Orion, even though he had no idea what he was supposed to look for.
He hadn't given up hope on Potter coming back to haunt the bookshop. It kept him going. He'd spent the holidays thinking about what he would say when that day came.
do." They made their way up the aisle. Potter set a box of eggs in the trolley, which was full and getting difficult to push. "And who cares? We have the money." Draco didn't understand Potter's problem.
"I think I can clean the rest of this with magic," Potter said. He fetched his wand and managed to do a respectable job of clearing up the mess.
"That's not what I meant." Potter made a face. A stupid one. "You just look ill, that's all. I'm worried about you."
"Whoever did it, they're not related to the case Potter and Lawrence were investigating at the time of the explosion."
"No," Draco said.
"Sounds like a real pickle," Jeremy said. He indicated towards Draco's plate. "Are you going to finish that?"
That evening, their table won. It was largely thanks to Bill and Barbara, who maintained a wealth of knowledge that seemed pertinent to pub quizzes. Draco was impressed against his will and had to admit they weren't such poor company, either—they laughed easily and were laid back.
He unlocked a desk drawer and pulled out a piece of parchment. Robards had instructed him to keep a log of his assignment, which was ridiculous. Since Draco wasn't actively investigating the case, there wasn't much to report, but he poised his quill over the parchment and wrote:
Everything seemed impossible now.
Draco blinked a few times. He didn't remember falling asleep.
He wanted Potter. That much was clear.
Jeremy narrowed his eyes. "Thought you two were on holiday."
An image of Potter licking his ice cream cone played through Draco's head. He was definitely hard now. It seemed odd that Potter was moping moments earlier and now apparently wanted to repeat last night's activities. But who was he to question how Potter's mind worked?
Draco rolled his eyes and began heading back to his cottage. "It's like this everyday."
"I think you want this," said Potter. He looked determined, almost angry. "I think you're just afraid to say you do."
It was dark outside by the time they finally finished working that evening. Draco trudged through the Atrium and could hardly summon the energy to Apparate.
Harry's mind reeled. "What?" he breathed. Was this actually happening?
"Yes. Now what are you doing here?"
It didn't help that, the more he kissed and touched Potter, the more he wanted him. He should have put a stop to all of it. It was the obvious thing to do.
"I, erm. Well, I know you hate the sofa." He took a deep breath. "If you want to sleep in the bed, it's fine."
"I know how to waltz," Draco said. "Do you?"
"We'll never finish packing, at this rate," Draco said, but he only half-cared. It was difficult to be annoyed with Harry kneeling between his legs, mouth hovering mere inches from his cock.
He smiled, got up, and went to start a new pot.
Potter snatched it from his hand and studied it so intensely Draco thought he would burn a hole through the parchment.
It was an Auror.
He was alone.
He tried to look as inconspicuous as possible whilst looking for a name placard that read 'Rutherford'. In retrospect, it was probably a bad idea to show up in Muggle clothing and expect to blend in, but it was too late now. All he could do now was get out of here as quickly as possible and hope word of his presence didn't reach Robards.
"I clearly meant the next one."
Draco snatched his keys from the ring next to the front door. "Fine. Don't dawdle then."
"I—It's possible." Draco's face heated. "Yes. I wanked to you, all right?"
"You're such a child."
It took Draco a moment the next morning to realise where he was, but the sound of the toilet flushing brought him back to reality.
He made a note to criticise Potter later and threw the stack of post at him, then sat on the opposite end of the sofa to read the summary from Jennings. The ink was still shiny.
Draco cocked his head. "What if I told you I didn't?"
"You're tense," Harry said. "Let's go on a walk."
"Is that supposed to be a joke? Am I supposed to laugh?"
He kept trying not to pay attention to Potter whenever they ate, sat on the sofa together, cooked, or went out to do the shopping or go on a walk.
"Well, the intrepid prat, Pierce, decided to go after them on his own as soon as he'd located them. Things got bad quickly—of course, the git was outnumbered—and they started firing some really nasty curses at him. Pierce apparently conjured Fiendfyre in return. Now we'll never know what they were after."
Harry kissed his forehead. "I'm going to have a look around."
He only had to consider it for a moment. "Fine."
"Actually," Harry said, "I think that was when I visited Ron and Hermione."
"You should. I think you'd like it better here if you did."
"No. I'm not afraid." Well, he was. But only because he knew he would already fail. "I - just leave it. I can't be with you. I can't be with anyone."
Talk. Right. He and Potter had to talk about this thing between them.
"Who gave Lawrence the tip about the meeting?" he asked.
"I like it here just fine."
"Potter is fine, just a bit shaken. However, this explosion was no accident. Someone was targeting them. We believe the culprit is still going to go after Potter."
Draco's face went blank as he said, "Goodnight, Potter."
His date was ten minutes late.
He really didn't know Potter after all.
They ate in silence for a while.
"I need to keep moving," Potter said, stepping over a log. "If I stay still, I start thinking about it too much."
"That's so kind," Potter said.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Draco had stopped saying it, but Harry knew the offer was still there, if he decided to leave. If things got too difficult.
He straightened his back. "I have something important to say, though."
"Hypothetically, of course."
As soon as Jennings handed over the rolled up scroll of parchment, Draco left the Ministry and Apparated home, scaring Potter, who was brushing crumbs from his shirt.
"Just the bloody puzzle dust." He coughed some more. "I'm fine."
Eventually though, he returned to the bedroom to glare at the parcels.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You never buy anything. You just drink my coffee and take my blankets."
Now it was okay for him to cry. He missed Draco already, even though he was right there, even though his hair tickled Harry's chin and their bodies were pressed together. He couldn't imagine how much he'd miss Draco when he was no longer there.
"Fine. Let me go to the loo first, at least."
"What?"
The rest of the afternoon passed slowly. Draco forced himself to focus on his book, but his mind and his eyes kept straying to the clock. As the time approached to close the shop, he launched out of his chair to make the rounds and gently remind his customers.
"No." He sat up, suddenly feeling much less exhausted. "I saw Rutherford today."
Life as a Muggle turned out to be as bad as Draco feared. Although they were permitted to use magic at home, they didn't. Neither of them were good at cleaning spells, and there wasn't much need for magic otherwise. Muggle life was dull, and it was sobering to realise how limited they actually were.
Potter heaved his bag onto the bed. "I'm glad you're letting me have it. Enjoy the sofa."
He grabbed his wand from the drawer of his bedside table and levelled it at the stack of correspondence. "
"All right, fine. I just don't think it's him. My money's on Jennings."
"How else would someone know to tip you off about something related to it?"
"Don't. I don't have patience for your games today. I told you to focus on Potter. Leave the case to MacDonald and Jennings."
"Be my guest," Potter said, indicating the dying flames. "It's starting to get a little chilly over here."
With one last look around, Harry closed the door and locked the shop, just as Draco would have done.
be the last customer out the door, and more and more often, he'd stop by the front counter to chat for a few moments with Draco.
." Draco winced, shutting his eyes against Potter's desperation. "I said no, okay? How many times do I need to say it?"
"I won't." He pulled Draco to him. "I won't."
"Fantastic. You know, I didn't want everyone finding out about us like this."
There was a long moment of silence, and then Whitby leaned forward and steepled his fingers on top of his desk.
He swallowed hard and wrapped his arms around Harry, preparing to Apparate.
Once Draco was fully seated, he let out a deep sigh and allowed his body to adjust, taking a moment to appreciate the image of Potter before him. His face and neck were flushed, and his breath came out in shallow puffs already. He ran his hands up Draco's thighs and smiled.
Harry's mouth opened and closed.
"Oh," Barclay called over his shoulder, "you might want to bring some coffee."
Potter threw the onions into a pan on the hob and set to work on the potatoes. He looked over his shoulder. "You're welcome to help. You'd learn a thing or two."
"Erm. Listen, I feel bad about earlier. I mean, today. The walk. And your shoes."
And throughout it all, Potter insisted on showing up at the bookshop every afternoon.
Draco cleared his throat. "Are you certain—"
"It's fine," Draco said. "Of course you can come here." His cheeks went slightly pink, and he added quietly, "I'm glad you did."
"Oh." The tension went out of Potter's face. "Well, I'm around."
Two things were clear to him: he had to get hold of the case file, and he had to do something.
Draco took a deep breath. It was difficult, with Potter looking at him like that, straight into his soul. "Maybe - can we sit down somewhere?"
Harry’s heart ached at the most inopportune moments now, and he occasionally lost control over his own pain as well. They took turns holding each other through the worst of it, because in the end, there was nothing else to do.
Draco threw aside the blanket and went into the bedroom. He slid under the covers on one side of the bed, whilst Potter did the same on the opposite side.
Damn.
"No," Draco said. He shut the door and walked up to Robards' desk. "I know who wants to kill H—Potter."
Pierce stepped through, wand in hand and a mirthless smile upon his face. Draco stood frozen to the spot, trying to decide whether to attack Pierce or protect Harry.
It was October now, and the crisp autumn air was tinged with the smell of late-blooming wildflowers and dry leaves that had already fallen. Draco always enjoyed walking around the Manor grounds in autumn most of all, and he missed that.
Robards' eyebrows rose. "Who?"
It took longer than it should have for Draco to realise he was destroying the very things he'd come to Cartmel for - distance and isolation.
"What the hell has gone on here?"
His friends leapt up when they saw he was awake. Their mouths opened, like they wanted to say something.
Draco was still watching him, but he wore a curious expression, and his finger had paused in tracing the figure eight pattern. "Potter," he said quietly, "I still don't know."
"You're going to do the crossword whilst I talk?"
Draco averted his eyes. "No, of course not."
The Atrium was quiet.
Fine. So he'd be alone.
Then again, the likelihood of a non-Ministry worker getting this far was low. And truly confidential information was stored elsewhere.
"Goodnight, sir."
It was an owl.
The way Harry kissed him back and grasped at him sent shivers down Draco's spine, and he threw a leg around one of Harry's and ground their hips together.
"Erm, all right, sure, that would be lovely."
"Er, it's not ready yet," he said, sheepish.
"So?"
"You're twenty-five. You'll be fine."
Draco nodded and closed his eyes, which suddenly felt very heavy.
Potter gave him a dark look. "So I wanted to see her. And I wanted to be there to celebrate."
Draco glared at him. The worst part was that Pierce was right. Draco was the only one who would come out of this looking bad. "You need to get more coffee," he said.
"I presume MacDonald and Jennings have told you?" He sat in Robards' office with his legs crossed. "Someone at the Ministry is after Potter."
"I promise, I wasn't looking for you. Nobody sent me to find you," Potter said quickly, perhaps sensing that Draco was considering something drastic.
"I reckon it was thunder, after all," Harry said. He hung his jacket and removed his shoes, then settled onto the sofa. "I think there's an episode of Midsomer Murders on tonight."
It was another clear night out, and Harry looked up to find Orion again. It was easy this time - his eyes went right to it. He gave it a wave, then pulled his wand out and murmured a spell. He repeated the incantation over and over, until Primrose Cottage had a thick growth of the stuff all around the perimeter.
"Are you David then? Henry's partner?"
If there was one person who came close to being as annoying and smarmy as Potter, it was Pierce. And there he was, spooning the last of the coffee grounds into his cup.
"What are you doing?" Draco hissed, but Potter kept his hand up.
"I love you, too," he said.
"Pardon?"
"I can read." Draco slowed as they approached the large Burger King sign and turned into the car park. He was starving after an entire afternoon spent driving.
They spoke of Draco's health only sparingly. Harry knew Draco would answer any of his questions. The problem was that Harry was too afraid to hear the answers. It had been enough when, after their first night together, Draco had explained the next evening how his body was in no fit condition to Floo or Apparate any longer, nor had it been for over a year. Harry, feeling a little selfish as he clutched Draco's hands, asked if he was still fit enough to have sex. When Draco said yes, that had been the end of the conversation, and their clothes.
. He held onto Draco's legs for dear life, felt his toes curl while his entire soul splashed across his chest. His vision went white for a moment, and Harry was glad he was laying down.
"I mean, an Auror wants to fucking kill you! What's confusing about that statement?"
"What?"
Yes, somebody wanted to kill Harry, but he was safe for now. Nobody knew where they were, and they'd find the culprit. It wasn't going to happen tonight, and that was fine. Tonight, they had each other.
Draco flipped open a large book sitting on the desk. It was an access book, containing logs of everyone who had entered and left.
After a few minutes of deep breaths, Draco began to feel better. He looked down at Whitby and saw the resigned look on his face.
"Well, which do you want?" Potter asked, grinning. He withdrew his finger and circled Draco's entrance.
But it didn't matter.
Harry slouched back into the sofa and reached with both hands to touch his face. He felt so numb. Was that normal? He stared at the fire and shivered. Maybe he should have asked Draco to stay. He could really use a hug right now.
"Let me know if I should do something differently," Harry said, rubbing one leg. Then he bent down to lick a stripe up Draco's cock.
Did it matter?
The grilles on the lift drew aside, and he stepped out onto Level Three. The Obliviator Headquarters took up most of the space here, but Draco stepped through it quickly to get to the smaller offices. He poked his head into the door that read Committee on Experimental Charms and found the man he was looking for.
"It's not yours."
"She's always got the most entertaining stories." Lewis began babbling about something she'd told him.
Draco stared at the frog in its familiar packaging. His heart leapt into his throat, and he didn't know whether to feel suspicious or grateful. Then he felt silly because he couldn't believe he was trying to decide how he should feel about a piece of chocolate.
"Are you ready?" he asked.
Each step towards the sofa felt heavy with anticipation. Draco sat down stiffly next to Harry. There was plenty of space between them, and he had to wonder if that was a bad sign.
He went inside to shower.
"Sort of. I was cursed." Draco laced his hands together. Squeezed. "It was over four years ago, in Diagon Alley. Just after my family's trial had ended. Are you familiar with the Septicemia Curse?"
"Leave it. Leave your jumper on."
Draco knocked on the door and fidgeted. It felt as though he stood waiting forever, but the door finally opened, revealing a tall man with wild brown hair that stuck out in all directions. His entire face seemed to droop down at the sides, including his moustache.
"I'm not sure."
A thousand different things went through Draco's mind as he processed Harry's words.
If only.
"That's why you said you can't be with anyone."
"Nah. You should come out next time." He pressed a kiss to Draco's temple and rubbed his clasped hands.
Famous last words. "All right."
"I orchestrated a break-in," Pierce said. "Whilst all you lot were busy dealing with that, I slipped into the Confidential Records Office and bribed old Wilcox." His face hardened. "Didn't expect he'd die and that you'd be auditing all the records, though."
Whitby took a breath. "You were cursed when you were in Diagon Alley -"
"Hi."
Draco tried to think of something—anything—to say that might convince her to just leave them alone. He cursed Potter in his head. They should have never answered the door. Nothing good could come from these Muggles and their—
And he'd got used to living with Potter.
He had no idea how long they lay there, mouths pressed together, arms clutching each other tightly. When Harry opened his eyes, he saw tears running down Draco's face. Aside from the one brief incident in their sixth year, this was a new sight for him - Draco had never cried in front of him.
Harry shut him up with a kiss. "Stay with me tonight," he whispered against Draco's lips.
It took a few moments for the words to fully register. Harry blinked himself back to reality. Everything had gone a bit blurry, and Draco was holding his hands, looking concerned.
He glanced up at Draco and said, "You're never going to get promoted, you know."
With more dignity than Harry thought possible, Draco said, "I'll see you tomorrow." And he left, taking quick, long strides down the path until he disappeared from view.
Harry sighed. "Yeah, I know. Are you any good at packing spells?"
"Pierce tried to kill us tonight," Potter stated simply.
"Oh, you're not doing that poorly."
"No. Your focus must be on protecting the client."
"I missed the way this place smells," Harry said as they stepped out onto Level Two. "Is that odd?" He looked around and took slow steps towards Draco's desk.
Yes, he had. But Draco held his tongue.
It was so presumptuous of him, and yet Draco felt disappointed on the nights Potter just spoke to him for a few minutes and left. If he was being honest, it was nice to have something to look forward to after suffering in the tiny store room while he took his potions. But he didn't need it. He didn't need to have dinner with Potter. It was enough that he saw him everyday. And so while Draco could never ask Potter to stay, he could never turn Potter away either.
Well. That settled it.
"I can't give you any more information unless you agree to take the case."
Or the kissing.
Jeremy shrugged and began shuffling the cards. "It's your money."
Draco froze and fought to keep his embarrassment from showing. All Aurors were taught the importance of establishing stopgap measures with their partners in the event of a worst-case scenario. It was one of the first things they learnt, because it was a matter of basic personal safety and could save their lives.
"Why?"
Draco counted to five, pretending to check his bag for something, then looked back to check that he was alone. And froze in horror.
"Some," he mumbled.
Draco made a note to look into that and waved to Emily, who was out in her garden.
"What?"
Draco had no idea what to say—a small part of him cared, but he didn't want to give that impression. Potter might expect to cry on his shoulder next.
"Yes, well, you can't miss what you've never known." Draco looked out at the bare trees stretching towards the sky and thought about how true that was. Life without Harry seemed empty and bleak, and he couldn't imagine going back to that. Yet it seemed to loom ever closer.
Draco squinted and frowned at the wooden cabinets, a threadbare rug on the floor, and a rickety table and chairs.
Sundays, they spent most of the day apart. Draco never joined Harry and Mrs. Wilder for breakfast. Then in the afternoon, Harry paid his customary weekly visit to Hermione and Ron. He always invited Draco to come along, knowing his friends would keep silent. They already were. But Draco shook his head and explained he had to visit with his Healer.
It was a relief to be home. He took his robes off on his way to the bedroom and changed into his pyjamas.
Draco's mouth quirked to one side, and he thought for a long moment.
Draco stared at him. Being Obliviated would erase everything. He wouldn't remember his time with Harry, the one person who had given him a chance despite knowing about his past. He couldn't have that. Not when he'd just found something fulfilling. Not when they'd just decided to take their relationship further.
Potter sighed. "All right."
He and Barclay had to make certain that no files were missing or tampered with, which was easier said than done. Multiple spells had to be cast on each file in order to determine when it was last accessed, that it was the original copy, and that it had the right enchantments for its level of security.
Potter laughed. "All right, but you should go tomorrow."
"Hi," Draco said. He sat stiffly in the other chair. As usual, a small mountain of boxes surrounded the desk. "I'm wondering," he continued, "whether you know how all the records are ordered here."
"Why don't we go to your place tonight?" he asked, pausing.
Lawrence? And if he'd got the safe house locations, why
"I eat out."
"We can't stay too late," he said. Potter set two plates of fish and chips on the table. "I've got to work tomorrow."
"Oops." He scrambled to put them back in a neat stack. "Hey, what's this?"
"Oh, what better way for people to get to know you!" Emily said. "And you won't be putting anyone out. It's for charity. We're trying to raise money to fix the old bridge behind the church."
"What?" Potter asked, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.
"Are you afraid of commitment? We can take things slow. I just -"
"We need to be careful with our money," Potter said.
He picked up his book to read, but the damn Chocolate Frog card made him pause. At least he could gawk at Potter without having to hide it, even though this smile was a facade. Draco knew the real Potter. He knew what a genuine smile looked like from him, and he knew what Potter's mouth felt like on his, even though that had been a facade as well.
"You can't expect me to sleep on that lumpy old thing! My back is sensitive."
Draco took his time preparing tea, and when he went into the living room with a tray laden with cups, plates of cake, and a full teapot, he wasn't surprised to see Potter already deep in conversation with the nosy old bat.
"Now look what you've done," Harry said.
"Don't," said Draco. "Don't say anything."
"What?" He felt sick.
Draco raised his chin when Harry approached. "Potter."
"I... Well, I'm not sure. Maybe."
"Perhaps I can visit the location of the explosion, since I've finally got the address."
it, push his hands up under the fabric and touch him. There was no doubt he was interested - he could feel Draco's erection pressed against his thigh, just as Draco could probably feel Harry's. What was he waiting for? Surely he didn't need to think about
"I thought you'd want to read it," Draco said.
Draco gritted his teeth. This had better be worth it.
Yet every afternoon when he went to the bookshop, Harry found his resolve wearing thin when Draco greeted him with a smile. And when evening came around and they bid farewell with a lengthy, albeit chaste hug, the faint smell of peaches always helped to chase away any remaining concerns Harry might have had.
"What is that?" Potter asked.
"I don't know," Draco murmured. And it wasn't as though he'd tell Barclay. Until he knew who he could trust, Draco wasn't saying a word to anyone.
Potter and his partner, Lawrence, had just been promoted.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, though he had no idea what. Truthfully, he didn't know. He realised he didn't know anything for certain.
"Potter," Draco croaked.
"Well, what is it now?" He sat back in his usual chair in front of Whitby's desk.
The telly was on when he Apparated home, and he slumped onto the sofa and stared at the screen.
"I can't do this," Draco panted. "I need to think, not fuck."
With one last look around, Draco turned on the spot to Apparate.
"I want you to fuck me until I forget my name."
But the Muggles didn't know.
Potter pinched the bridge of his nose. "God, that's right."
"You don't believe me?"
"Can't," Draco said quietly.
"It's a nice view," Draco said.
He walked the perimeter of the shop, telling himself he was taking stock and making sure everyone was happy. When he got to the rear corner nook, he narrowed his eyes and halted. Potter's messy black hair poked up from the top of an armchair. His insides began to swim, and he just couldn't figure out why this was so awkward. This was Draco’s shop. This was also Potter.
Harry smiled. "You must love me if you'll agree to live with Muggles."
He took a deep breath and went to the kitchen, where Potter and Dorothy were nattering on about pointless topics and putting the food away. The kettle was going, and Draco groaned inside at Potter's hospitality.
"She's mentioned it once or twice." Draco turned to face Harry. "You should go and get something to eat."
After what seemed like an eternity, Potter finally said, "Fine." His face had gone completely white, and his mouth trembled slightly. "I'll erm, I'll be going then," he said, standing. "Thanks for dinner. And I guess, good night." His eyes looked so dull, full of pain and betrayal, and Draco thought he'd never felt worse in his life.
"Are you all right?" Draco asked, voice thick with sleep.
Draco ignored him and flipped to the back of the access book. Sure enough, there were entries for everything: names, dates, the time, the type of record accessed, and a column for notes. Many entries with Barclay's name littered the back pages, and 'AUDIT' was stamped in all the notes columns.
"How can you be sick of them already?"
"That's fine. We have all the time in the world."
All throughout the day, customers would come and go, some local, some not. Draco made sure there was fresh coffee, and when pastries ran out, he'd ask one of his regulars to keep watch for the five minutes it took for him to dash across the street to Mrs. Wilder's bakery.
"There's my deed. Can I have a blanket?"
Potter gave a small smile. "Good thing you're stuck with me for now, then."
Draco stared into his eyes, trying to gauge how truthful he was being. He'd never learnt Legilimency though, and he never trusted anyone these days, so it was difficult. How much did he want to trust Potter? Now that was interesting to consider. He thought back to the day they'd first arrived at Hogwarts, when he'd offered Potter his hand, only to be rejected. Somehow, this felt like a second opportunity, only it felt like Potter was the one extending his hand this time. It felt good.
If he'd noticed.
They had moved him around to different cubicles in his six years as an Auror, and he knew the desks all had a secret compartment in the same location. Not very secret, he had to admit. But they could be locked, and most people combined this with protective enchantments.
Draco nodded numbly, and Potter talked him through cooking a bright red tomato sauce and pasta.
Potter stopped eating. He set his container on the table between them.
"Barclay!" Draco called. He ran down the row and didn't stop until he nearly collided with the desk.
"Yes, you are," Lister said. "Says so right here." He pointed at the parchment in his hand. "Right. I believe Mr Potter already has experience living with Muggles, is that correct?"
Draco decided he believed him this time and asked more about their lives. It wasn't that he cared. As Potter blabbed, Draco only half-listened, enthralled more at the sight of him so lively and energetic. He tried to remember the last time he'd felt that way about anything, and if his eyes had ever lit up like Potter's.
Harry stretched to open the bedside table drawer and dug through it until he triumphantly pulled out the small bottle of lubricant. He tossed it to Draco.
"We're not doing anything wrong," Harry said. "Nobody's going to remember us."
"Maybe."
"Dunno. I reckon you get used to it."
"Sure." Why not? Let him think what he wanted. Draco stabbed into a piece of fish with his fork.
"To a degree. But the damage is cumulative. All we can do is try to slow the progression. As your body starts to fail, we'll no doubt have to add more potions -"
Potter gave a sad smile. "We all are. I could die tomorrow." He took a breath. "I thought I
Draco stood, but froze immediately once he realised it wasn't anywhere in the cottage. "It's not here."
Harry could still hear the sound of the shower going, so he went back into the living room and sat down on the sofa. They had begun working on the constellation jigsaw puzzle earlier that week and were nearly finished already. He had to marvel at Draco's capacity to sit hunched over the table for hours at a time, methodically snapping pieces together. Harry could never focus for more than an hour or two, and then he'd turn his attention to discovering what it took to break Draco's concentration.
"If only I could have that case file."
Well, except it was Harry's cottage now.
Draco set the tray on the countertop to dry and shifted his gaze from Potter to the microwave, and back to Potter.
Draco couldn't take any more dates like Friday's. And lately, they had all been like that. A partner was a lot more trouble than it was worth right now.
The arms around him drifted up to gently grip his shoulders and pull him back a little. Draco placed his palms on Potter's chest and let his head loll back enough so that he was looking right into deep green eyes. He felt drunk.
"So, who was this bloke?" he asked.
"You really need to stop doing that." Draco winced, swallowing thickly. "You're going to make me sick one day."
"Of my untimely demise?"
Robards gave him a harsh look. "No, I don't." And he swept towards his office with Jennings and MacDonald trailing after him.
"I'd like more details."
A rapping sound at the front door made them freeze, and the sudden breeze made Draco realise the windows were open. Fantastic.
"Yeah, I suppose so."
"And what, they gave it to you?"
"Right. Well, here's a wild idea—we can share. It is big enough for two, after all."
Sunlight streaming in through the window woke Harry the next morning.
"But someday."
"No, I mean that's all you're going to say about the investigation?"
Ordinarily, he Flooed to visit Hermione and Ron for Sunday roast. He wasn't sure about that today, though. He just felt like being alone and wallowing. He was allowed to do that.
Pierce leant against the countertop and shrugged. "Don't need to be. Why would anyone give a promotion to a Death Eater?"
This was what Draco had been missing. He wrapped his legs around Harry and ran his hands through his short, messy hair as they kissed.
Potter smiled. "C'mon, you already admitted you can't stop thinking about me."
"Potter—"
Potter was out when Draco returned home. He narrowed his eyes at the telly—as Potter called it—and snatched the plastic telly changer from the side. He'd seen Potter do this enough times now and smashed a handful of buttons until the box came to life.
"I resent the implications you're making!"
Draco shivered. "I'm not sure." He really couldn't say, not with Harry's breath tickling his ear and his hands sliding down to his hips to undo his trousers.
"What in Merlin's name were you doing?" He shoved another Jaffa Cake into his mouth.
"I'm never going to get promoted, and everyone hates me."
"Wow."
"You shouldn't have read this," Jennings said.
"You didn't pack your things," he said, while Potter removed and opened several cartons and handed him a plate and utensils.
Harry kissed his ear and whispered, "Show me."
"Don't see how it could be Morrell, either," Draco said. "He's too… cheerful."
"As for cases," Robards continued, "I assign those at my discretion. Highly visible cases get a lot of press coverage and can be very political. Surely you can agree that I must exercise caution with you especially, given your history. I wouldn't want to give people the wrong idea."
Harry wondered if everyone could hear his heart pounding. His hand stilled where it had been rubbing Draco's cheek.
"God forbid you should ever be faced with an actual choice someday."
He didn't understand why this bothered him so much, whilst Potter didn't seem fussed about anything.
it was him, but now that he tried to look at everything objectively, he could see there was still a missing link.
Draco watched as Potter's mouth began trembling and his brow furrowed. He was quite certain Potter's heart just broke, and Draco pressed his lips together. He couldn't look away.
"Don't bother," Potter said. "It's locked."
Harry pushed the thought away. He had to carry on like there would be some kind of future. One with Draco in it. Because Harry was too fragile to face reality. The facts were still too fresh and new, and almost impossible to believe when he looked at Draco, when he saw him smile and complain and go to work every single day like nothing was wrong. Everything was all so normal for him, so it had to be normal for Harry, too. And the only way that could happen was if he shoved it all out of his head and lied to himself.
- it doesn't concern you."
Harry got them all a round of drinks as the pub quiz began, and although Draco was once again unable to answer any of the questions, his face ached from smiling so much at the end of the night. Their table hadn't won. It would have been nice, since it was Harry and Draco's last pub quiz.
He wandered up and down the corridor until he found the stairs.
"Not ready? How many times have I told you that I need my coffee exactly at nine?" She looked angry, but the corners of her mouth struggled not to twitch upward.
"Go take a nap," Potter said in a flat voice.
The dizzy spell had passed, and Draco looked around. They were in a tiny, windowless room with no furniture in it. The air was stale, and the faded floral wallpaper had seen better days. He walked towards the door.
"I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be," Draco said, trying to calmly stir his coffee. "Don't you have a case you're supposed to be investigating?"
An obvious mistake.
"That's it?" said Draco.
He'd come to the bookshop after, alone. It felt like a mistake as soon as he entered, but all the familiar smells and sights coaxed him like a siren's song, and he stayed.
At last, Draco shifted his hips experimentally, and he tried not to look too smug at the cry it elicited from Potter. He rocked his hips again and settled into a steady rhythm of quick, shallow thrusts that sent sparks of pleasure through his body. Who would have guessed that Potter's cock was such a good fit? Dimly, Draco realised he was making all sorts of noises, but he didn't care. Potter was, too.
They'd lain in bed the whole day, talking. The hours sped by, and now with the sun going down, Harry felt the weighty press of time bearing down upon them. He pulled Draco close and kissed him, slow and deep.
"Should be, yeah. What's happened?"
"Home."
Under the table, Potter lightly pinched Draco's leg. "Whose side are you on?"
Draco's face twitched, just a little. "I don't know. It's all been so hard to predict. But it seems my heart is winning against my other organs in the race towards failure."
Perhaps some Muggles were all right.
Pierce laughed. "That's hilarious coming from you, Death Eater."
Draco looked at his face, trying to discern anything from his expression, but Potter only looked confused. "MacDonald had some residue from the explosive analysed. There was a high concentration of Venomous Tentacula seeds, which—"
Something more.
"He really thinks this bloke was killed?"
"So you know, then. You know what it's like."
"Sure, sure." Potter led them around the floor.
"I want to go now. Nobody will be there."
With a heavy sigh, Harry pushed back the covers and climbed out of bed. His joints felt stiff, as though he'd aged 40 years overnight. He'd decided against visiting Hermione and Ron after all. The sofa called to him after Mrs. Wilder left, and he lay in various uncomfortable configurations all day while staring at the fire and blinking out tears. He'd completely forgotten to eat until he finally stood to move to his bed that evening and saw the breakfast dishes were still out.
It was late when they arrived home, and Draco's entire body was in pain. His muscles were sore, his arms itched from when he'd tripped and fallen into a patch of nettles, and his feet and ankles were killing him. Although he felt exhausted, he dreaded sleeping on that damn sofa, knowing what it would do to his back.
Draco fought to keep his expression even. It took everything in him to remain calm. "Yes. I need you to give me any details logged about an anonymous tip sent in on the seventh of August."
Draco looked at his watch. "It's too early."
She eyed him over the parchment. "That's what this device is for. We'll know more in another 12 hours."
A thrill ran through him, and he shrank it and tucked the file into his pocket, then set the original back in Jennings' desk and restored the enchantments.
He'd been in St. Mungo’s the last five days. Not that he remembered any of it. He'd only woken up late last night. Next to him stood a small table with a delicate silver contraption perched on top.
Robards' steely eyes shifted from the book to Draco. "All this proves is that he accessed these files without permission. In truth, he's done this before, acting before getting permission."
"You mean you don't even use magic?"
He blinked. His face felt wet.
Mostly normal. Draco swallowed hard. "Good. What else is there? I want to get out of here today, you know. I have things to do."
"I made dinner, if you're hungry."
"Any chance you're going to tell me why you care so much?"
But he didn't want to talk about it.
"Ah," Robards said. "Well, as it's a small village, we'll be Obliviating everyone there."
Draco glared. Potter ate quickly. He never looked up from his plate as he shovelled in mouthful after mouthful. It was unsightly. Draco set his fork down in disgust and pushed back from the table.
"God, Potter, I just said 'take me now'. What more do you want?"
"Hope you don't mind if I sit with you," Potter said, taking a seat across from him.
"Well, budge over. I'll not let you keep me from my coffee."
"Oh, right. I almost forgot."
"Many of you have met these two young men already, I'm sure," Rosemary said. "They married just before moving to our lovely village, and I've been told they didn't have a proper celebration with friends and family. To show how glad we are to have them here, let's have them lead us into our next dance!"
"You heard me correctly, sir. It's Pierce."
"Trust me, this is the best way."
For now though, Draco slept.
"Thought you didn't want something that was a lot of work," Jeremy said. He stood and zipped his jacket.
Impossible, yes.
"I owe you a night, and I've decided it'll be tonight." He opened one eye to see Potter's mouth hanging open.
"Then how about we get takeaway from somewhere?"
Harry had no idea what sorts of spells Whitby performed, since they were all nonverbal. Whitby tucked his wand back into his robes after a few minutes and scribbled on his parchment. Harry took that as his cue that it was okay to lay down next to Draco again.
"What are you doing to me?" he murmured against Potter's mouth.
He wished Potter would stop looking at him like that. Like his heart was already crushed. "I can't," he said quietly.
Draco dropped the file.
Draco nodded. He knew all this. If they ever needed to trace the source, it was tedious, but it could be done by narrowing the search parameters based on information such as this.
"Right, well, I'm sitting down now," Draco said as the song ended. "I want to leave soon, by the way."
"Sorry, sorry!"
"If it's too hot, you have to eat it in about ten seconds, otherwise it'll melt. But when it's cold, you can take your time to enjoy it."
Finally, something Draco knew that Robards didn't. It felt good to catch him off guard. "I looked into the anonymous tip Lawrence received. It was forged—there were no identifying details associated with it."
It didn't really matter.
Potter shrugged and grinned. "I won't tell anyone if you don't. Besides, I'm curious to see this file as well. Maybe we can find something they missed."
"You're doing fine," Draco said, breathing as though he'd just run a considerable distance. "But I want more."
He held his breath as Potter's fingers trailed up his leg and dipped into his pocket. His hand felt warm through the fabric, and his fingers came close to brushing against Draco's growing erection.
"See you tomorrow, Potter."
Over the next week, Draco struggled with how to act around Potter. It was tempting to retreat to hostility. At least that was something familiar. Something less confusing. Something that would occupy less space in his mind.
Life, of course, seemed to have other plans for him.
But Barclay had disappeared somewhere in the darkness.
The Chocolate Frog Potter grinned at him from Draco's book, and he slammed it shut.
"No, he couldn't have done!" Draco yelled. "He wouldn't have a clue about which case Potter and Lawrence were investigating. Don't you see? It has to be an Auror. And I'm telling you, it's Pierce!"
"Right." Jeremy paused halfway to offer a hand for Draco to shake, opting to give an awkward wave instead. "Well, I suppose I'll see you around."
Draco shivered after he left Robards' office from their one-to-one. It hadn't been a good meeting, and he didn't think he could risk going to interview his list of suspects, but he certainly didn't relish the idea of going back to the Confidential Records Office. He needed more coffee for that, and he wasn't sure his stomach could handle more.
"You'll feel better after you've had some tea." Harry pushed a hot mug of tea across the table, prepared exactly as Draco liked.
Draco half-listened, opting to pay more attention to a loose thread on his sleeve instead. "It sounds as though you have a pretty good idea of what it's like to be an Auror."
Pierce frowned. "What does one more murder matter to you anyway, Death Eater? If it'll be easier on your conscience, I'll Obliviate you so you won't even need to worry about it."
He was too far gone at that point. So in love that to stop things now would almost feel worse than what was to come. He knew that if he left Draco, he would never be able to live with himself. And he had a lot longer to go.
He set the card out of sight, where he wouldn't have to think about it or Potter, and sank into the scalding water.
"That's not my fault," Draco said.
Eventually, he made his way back towards the front of the shop, pausing again at the counter. It was more habit than anything else. He didn't expect Draco to suddenly be there. Not really. The curtains were already drawn, so he took out his wand and cast the charms to put everything back in place and clean the dust that had accumulated.
"Ouch, watch where you're going!" Draco yelled as someone knocked into him. He rubbed his shoulder and headed towards the lifts. Fridays were supposed to be relaxed.
"Well, I'm interested in
"I'm going to take a bath," Draco said. "Bring my tea when it's ready?"
When getting dressed one morning, he looked at Potter's shelves and took stock of all his clothes, including a colourful stack of pants. Draco reached without thinking and rubbed the material of one pair between his fingers. Which colour was Potter wearing today?
"It reminds me of Hogwarts."
"You fucking liar. I'm about to pass out from the smell of your breath."
"Obviously not. I just got a memo from Wimple that says you were treating him like a suspect. Wimple, of all people!"
"Potter." Draco's heart pounded. "I can't do it."
"Right. Well, I want to be promoted. Everyone else has been at this point."
Draco pulled it from his pocket. He hadn't imagined he'd actually need to use it. He tapped his wand to it and said, "Draco Malfoy is an arse." When Potter was safe and home, he'd make him change that fucking secret phrase.
He didn't remember setting his book aside or turning off the lamp, but when he awoke the next morning, someone had.
The knocking grew insistent.
"Help yourself." How anyone could enjoy cold chips was beyond him.
"Pardon?" Draco gripped the arms of his chair tightly, and he saw that Harry was on the edge of his seat.
Draco scowled. Leave it to Potter to bring up trivial things such as rules and regulations when it suited him.
They trudged after him and went into a kitchen. An old kitchen. Bright sunlight streamed in through the windows and highlighted several spots of chipped paint on the faded yellow walls.
When the clock struck eleven, Draco took the last sip from his cup of coffee and strode over to Robards' office.
"And?"
He Apparated home and immediately set the kettle to boil, then tossed a piece of steak and kidney pie into the microwave.
Harry bent to kiss him, to reassure him, to comfort him. He pulled away at the sound of brisk footsteps entering the otherwise empty ward.
Thursday evening, they went to the pub with Jeremy, Barbara, and Bill again. They all had dinner together, and Draco found himself laughing as Bill regaled them with the story of his and Barbara's disastrous first date. Draco was slightly envious of the bond they shared, and he squeezed Harry's leg under the table and hoped one day, they could be that close.
"Who was it?"
When she finally left, clicking the front door shut, Draco let out a sigh of relief.
Lewis's plate sat across the table, untouched. The risotto looked gluey and unappetising now that it had cooled.
"Already tried it."
Draco gaped at him.
He didn't know what to say—he didn't know whether he could truly trust Robards.
At the front door, Potter fished around in his pockets.
"Last dance," he said. "Don't step on my feet this time."
Draco bit the inside of his cheeks and stared at him. He refused to blink.
Potter shrugged. "Depends on the day. I like to go walking and running. There's a Ramblers group—"
Draco bit the insides of his cheeks when Potter shut the bedroom door Monday night. He tried for several minutes to arrange himself comfortably on the sofa, but it was too squashy. Draco preferred a firm bed.
"We've already been administering one to you while you were unconscious." Whitby pulled out a small jar with thick blue liquid in it and placed it on the bedside table. "But now that you're awake, you can take it yourself."
When Harry woke again, he saw Hermione and Ron sitting beside him. Somebody had dressed him in a hospital gown, so he must still be in St. Mungo's, though he had no idea where.
"Just one other, Healer Longford. You met her -"
"Excuse me?" Draco said. He couldn't see how one box could cook and another could clean. The two tasks weren't related at all. The only difference in the boxes was the window shape. And the size. Was this really what Muggles had to live with?
"I've heard the floor can be good for that."
Mrs. Wilder halted just past the entryway, in the middle of taking off her coat. "What's gone on here? Everything's a mess." She sniffed the air. "And I don't smell any coffee."
"Excellent. Best of luck to both of you. I'll be off." Lister held his hand up, then turned on the spot and vanished with a pop.
After an excruciating cup of tea and many personal questions, Draco feigned a headache, which gave Dorothy the kick she needed to leave.
"This is nice," Harry said.
"I could go pick up food in that time."
The sound of Harry's scream mixed with Pierce's laughter was an eerie combination. Draco clenched his teeth and pushed himself to kneeling, but his limbs felt so shaky that he knew he'd never make it to the bedroom without Pierce catching up to him.
"Yes."
going to die, all throughout school. And then I knew I would. It was a rare bit of magic that I was able to come back."
"I'll order takeaway if you talk," Potter said.
Shortly after they finished eating, the pub became very crowded. Three Muggles—Jeremy, Randall, and Mary—arrived with pints of ale and crowded around the table with Potter and Draco.
He sighed, skimming the report once more. Again, he was struck with the feeling that he'd missed something, but he didn't know what.
something already!" Potter said, throwing his arms up.
"Oh hello! Hello there!"
have my one-to-one at the same time every Friday."
"We haven't done anything yet." Many ideas flitted through Draco's head as he stared at Potter's erection.
Potter shoved his hands into his pockets. "Come on," he said, and began walking along the footpath again.
Besides, Potter had already seen him desperate to come. This was hardly more intimate.
It was time to go to work.
A hot bath was exactly what Draco needed to relax after the calamity from the previous day. He refilled the water twice before finally stepping out and stretching.
Potter dried his hands and stepped close, placing a palm to Draco's back. "Look at the bright side," he said. "At least you don't need to go into the Ministry every day."
And so they donned their jumpers and jackets and stepped into the crisp evening air. Perhaps it was Draco's imagination, but the atmosphere felt distinctly unsettled. He reached for Harry's hand as they crunched through dead leaves that littered the empty path through the forest.
"I'm sorry."
"It's all right," Harry said. "We can get dinner another day. Do you at least want help cleaning up?"
Every time he'd cast the spells over the last three weeks, nothing had happened, which meant they hadn't been tampered with. With a shaky hand, he aimed his wand and uttered the incantations, exactly as he had done countless times.
On Sundays, the bookshop was closed.
"Am I going to die?"
"The man you were with on Sunday."
"Much later."
"I never get out to the countryside back home, though. Well, back home in the wizarding world, I mean."
Draco rubbed his eyes. "I've got to figure this out."
"Shut up, I got us here." He started the engine and turned onto Newtons Orchard. At the end of a short, tree-lined street stood their new home, and Potter stalled the car again as he pulled up to it.
Silence followed. Harry feared Draco wouldn't answer, that maybe their conversation was over before it had even really begun. Finally though, Draco exhaled and said, "It's stupid, but I don't want to associate anything in my home with this curse. Or with anything from my old life, really. I came here to get away from everything. As much as I could anyway."
It had been a suggestion of Hermione's, that he start writing. They were all affected by the war, and in the immediate aftermath they all handled it in different ways. Harry had taken to staying in bed, drifting in and out of consciousness for days, avoiding everyone and everything. He was a "hero", but he couldn't bring himself to face anyone. Not even his friends. He could hardly face himself.
As night fell, Draco's worry increased. He'd gone back and forth over whether to remain in this miserable shack or Apparate back to the cottage.
"What's your problem?"
It had to be his dancing. It was so bad that it was disarming.
Sometimes twice per day.
"No!" Harry said quickly. He couldn't hear Draco say those horrible words again. "I mean why do you take your potions there? Why not at home?"
Whitby nodded. "Your heart rate is abnormally high. Now -"
"Yes."
Draco nodded numbly and went back to his desk. But trying to focus on work was hopeless. Perhaps he should just go home.
"I dunno. I think I got caught up in the moment."
He sat at his desk and reached for the top letter in his in-tray, but he didn't bother to read it. Instead, he played through the scenario in which he handed over his resignation letter, trying to imagine what he would say to Robards.
"You can have this one," Draco said. It was pale yellow, and the metal bed frame looked juvenile.
After a three-day heat wave at the beginning of the next week, temperatures fell to a level more seasonally appropriate for early September. Potter went outside nearly every day to go on a walk or run. He began inviting Draco to accompany him, but Draco refused.
"People never change. That's why I've got to kill Potter, here."
"Some random Muggle isn't going to know how to steer us in the right direction. Best to just avoid them."
"Of course you are," said Harry.
Pierce rolled over and pinned Draco to the floor, holding his hands above his head. Up close, Draco could see how far gone he was. They'd be lucky to escape this situation alive.
"No need." Harry gave a small laugh. "I don't want to come straight away."
"Oh."
He looked at Harry, trying to keep concern from showing in his face.
"That won't happen," Lister said. "There's nobody around, and we've plenty of space."
"Fine. All right," he said.
"Mrs. -
"Don't tell me you didn't finish those fucking budget reports last week. There were only a few left."
People strolled up and down the street, smiling and laughing, holding hands, carrying their shopping. Scarves whipped in the wind. Everyone was out making the most of the day. Even the leaves had a charming lilt of careless joy as they drifted through the air to their final resting place.
Without thinking, he stepped in and snatched it.
"Every year for the last decade or so," Jeremy said.
to say, but in the interest of prudence, it was probably best not to.
"Harry, please -"
a bloody Death Eater! Did you agree to this date just to ambush me?" He tried to remember what Lewis did for a living. Was he a reporter?
Nothing.
It was better than good, better than he had imagined. And Draco had spent a lot of time imagining this over the last few days.
Draco caught Potter looking at him over Dorothy's shoulder with a look of panic and had to suppress a smirk at his discomfort. It was the same look he had when Draco argued with that Drinkwater bloke. They'd both reached for the last book of crosswords in the tiny village bookshop at the same time, and neither was willing to let the other have it.
"Have you met Harry yet? Just moved here some months ago. I think you two would really get on. You could use a friend your age."
Of course. Potter the Saviour. Always had to have his nose in everybody's business.
"Why won't you let me help?"
There was a persistent ache in his chest that had nothing to do with his medical problems. It seemed impossible for Draco to deny his feelings any longer. Not when they left him feeling like this. Like part of him was missing. Like he'd made a mistake.
He drained his mug of tea and went to the bedroom. He looked around to take stock of the situation and frowned. Somehow, they had accumulated a wealth of stuff.
"You don't know that," Draco said.
"Potter," he began, and Potter pulled him close and pressed their mouths together.
"It's someone at the Ministry," Draco said again. "At least, Jennings feels confident it is."
And the tea helped.
"Anyone can read a bloody map."
"Then we'll deal with it," Harry said. "It could also be some kids playing a prank or something. It is Hallowe'en, after all. The important thing is to stay calm."
"Not much of a husband, are you?" Draco sat at the table across from Potter with a glass of water. "Roasted chicken would be nice. And turnips and mashed potatoes with gravy. Perhaps some—what?"
Well. Anywhere else, really.
"And what about the tip you sent to Potter and Lawrence?" Draco asked. "Did you forge that?"
Robards waved his hand. "It's an emerging high-profile case that's just come in."
"That was fun," Potter said.
"I, erm, well. It was nice, I thought."
Draco sat up and took a sip. "I can get out soon."
He took a deep breath before continuing. "And if I think I might get a reprieve from Muggles when I go to the Ministry, that grand delusion is destroyed by Robards and the other pillocks in the office. I hate it here. I don't
"No." She waved her arm to silence him. "I won't hear it. Now let me think."
"That's another reason you'll come here once per week. We'll continue to have our one-to-one, and I'll share any relevant information regarding the investigation with you."
"No." Harry squeezed his hand. "I'm really going to miss this, though."
Potter eyed him suspiciously. "Well, they're all destroyed anyhow."
"I was," Harry said. "But you keep shifting around and knocking into me."
But it was so hard to resist Potter.
and opened the door. A thousand questions had sprung up in his head, and it was difficult to smile at Mrs. Wilder just then. Predictably, she was irate.
forget.
? Aren't I fine? What's wrong with me?" he demanded.
"No, you can't."
"Yes," Draco said. "That would certainly explain why the Daily Prophet followed you here on your first visit."
Nice? Potter thought it was
"Shut up," Draco snapped.
Yeah, right. Draco rolled his eyes and left, taking long strides down the corridor. As he made his way through the cubicles on his way to Robards' office, an idea struck him. Of course—the Charmed Galleons. He'd alert Harry to go to their safe location.
Potter volunteered, and Draco felt relieved. He protested when Lister insisted he get in the car whilst Potter learnt though.
He didn't believe it. "Don't do this to me."
these feelings resulted from being forced together, that they were temporary. But they felt very real and very powerful.
Robards sighed and frowned. He looked as though he'd rather be anywhere but here. "We've discussed this. You must show leadership skills—"
"All right…"
He'd been insistent right up until the end that nobody should know he was dying.
Each day, Draco had donned a set of plain black robes to sit in front of the assembled. He barely remembered any of it now, even though it had all just happened.
"Right. As I said."
"Do you know where the Time-Turners are kept at the Ministry?" He tried to sound casual about it, but from the way Potter looked at him, he didn't think he'd succeeded.
"This is my life, Potter." He rubbed his temples. The last thing he needed was a headache.
Draco shut him up with a kiss.
"What is it then?"
"How'd you do that?"
"Not exactly."
"Listen," Potter said, "we need to set some security measures between us."
It was difficult to say how long Draco stood half-naked in the living room, dripping and staring at nothing.
After a long moment, he nodded. "All right, Potter."
"That thing you do to earn money?"
Still a little disheveled, Draco quickly cast his usual cleaning charms around the place and started a pot of coffee. He tossed his wand in the drawer under the till, opened the door, and sure enough, Mrs. Wilder made a beeline for the coffee pot, placing a tray of fresh pastries next to it.
"Your turn," Potter said with a glint in his eyes, and he used the same light, lazy strokes Draco had.
"Okay," Potter said, rinsing a glass and handing it to him. "Because you don't seem all right."
Except Draco didn't want to embrace it. That meant becoming comfortable with Potter, understanding him.
Adrenaline raced through his veins as he tried to remember the last time someone had broken into the Ministry. Not since he'd been in school. In fact, Potter and his cronies had been the ones to break in.
And Harry watched him in the moonlight.
Draco removed his shoes as well and placed them next to Harry's so they made a tidy row. "All right."
Draco scowled. "Potter is under my charge. It seems necessary that I know what the status of the investigation is, and if there's anything I can do to help."
Just as well. Draco was certain he looked terrified. He took shallow breaths, then yanked his foot away. Potter's foot had brushed against his.
"It's just, we don't want to put anyone out," Potter said. "We're new here. People don't know us. You know."
"I want you to fuck me," Draco panted.
"Is this part of your punishment from the war, somehow?"
Harry had apparently gotten completely immersed in writing then, because when he felt a tap on his shoulder, he gave a startled yelp. His pen clattered to the floor.
If Potter was surprised, he didn't look it. "You mean, if you own it?"
He sat on the bench and waited for Potter to arrive.
"How much longer?" he muttered to Potter. They had fallen behind the group.
It wasn't so bad, he decided. There was something gratifying about having his hands in the dirt as he cultivated his own personal Eden.
Draco felt the head of Harry's cock press against him, and he held his breath in anticipation whilst Harry inched inside.
Potter had looked back as well. He
He put the jar back, closed all the drawers. Boxes on the floor collected all the empty jars and vials.
"You are comforting me, and it's all right. It hasn't exactly been necessary to talk about this. Not until..."
," he said through gritted teeth. "She won't close in one minute."
"Nothing," he mumbled, then left as quickly as he dared whilst carrying a cup of coffee full to the brim.
"And what about me? I'm a customer."
Nights were difficult.
"The Healers wouldn't give me any more Dreamless Sleep, so I decided to leave today."
Potter sighed. "You're the one in trouble if we get caught."
He groaned at the sudden absence of Harry's mouth, but the bedside table drawer opening and closing was a welcome sound—Potter was fetching the lubricant. He returned and positioned himself between Draco's legs, pushing them up and apart.
Reluctantly, he set to work, glancing at Potter now and then to make sure he was putting in an equal amount of effort, and before he knew it, they had stuck a chicken and ham pie in the cooker.
And that lumpy bit poking into Draco's lower back was Potter's erection.
Not today.
Draco ignored him and went to the bedroom, where he found his jacket and fished through the pocket until he found the Chocolate Frog he stole from Pierce's desk.
"Your respiratory functionality is - er, let's say -"
It wasn't enough.
"No."
He blamed Potter for all of it, simultaneously wishing he could punch and kiss him.
turn him away. Draco could think of a dozen reasons they were unsuitable for each other. He
"No. How many times have I got to say it?"
Whatever reservations Draco had been grappling with, he seemed to have abandoned them then. Harry closed his eyes and let himself feel. A tongue ran along his bottom lip, coaxing his mouth open with a groan. He did his best to respond in kind, curious and desperate to familiarise himself with the way Draco tasted. It was all so much better than he had imagined, and he wrapped his arms around Draco to hold him closer, lightly massaging his neck with one hand. He'd hardly dared hope that things would actually turn out like
"Your Dark Mark."
"Oh!" Draco sat up to get a better look. Harry smiled and watched his eyes take in every detail of the box. It was another jigsaw puzzle for Draco to add to his collection, and it featured a very detailed map of the stars. It also had the words
"Then guess!"
Draco had no idea, but he hoped he did as well. At least the place seemed suitably named—Burger King.
"Robards would never believe a Death Eater."
"Lighten up a little, you'll have more fun that way." Potter stepped on his foot again and laughed. "You wouldn't win any prizes with your dancing, either."
Draco froze. "He's a - a friend."
Draco could only stare, dazed, as he felt his heartbeat slow. Potter's pupils were large and dark, and his mouth was pink and swollen. Draco felt utterly spent, yet he'd never wanted him more. He pulled Potter onto the sofa and sank between his knees.
"Potter," he called when Potter emerged. "Stay here tonight."
"Do you still have it?" Lewis asked, his voice a whisper.
Robards shrugged. "That's fine."
Potter was never in the bedroom when Draco took a bath, so he never worried about being overheard. Not that he was terribly loud. Especially here. These were utilitarian wanks. And that's what this one would be.
Everyone was there—Pansy, Bulstrode, Nott, the two Greengrass sisters, Davis, Zabini, and even Goyle. Draco hadn't seen them in years. He was the only one missing, but they seemed just fine without him. His chest tightened at the sight, and he wondered whether he would ever be able to redeem himself to them. There was no way he could undo the past, and they seemed unwilling to let it go.
"When, sir?"
"Bedroom," Draco said against his lips.
"Yes?" the man said.
A loud knock brought Draco awake.
. "Obviously. But I mean, you kind of disappeared. And nobody knows where. Not even your friends." He cocked his head. "Not even your parents."
The sun was going down. They'd stopped moving. He looked at Potter, who was folding the map. Had he hexed Draco?
Draco worked steadily. It was tedious work, but it was easy to focus when there were other things he'd rather avoid thinking about.
It was early, and the sight of Potter sleeping peacefully in the weak morning light did something to Draco. His heart clenched with some sort of horrible longing, and he remembered Potter kissing him last night.
"You honestly think I'm a fool, don't you? That I don't know what's going on in my own department."
"I've been thinking about something." Draco set his glass on the bedside table. "Ever since the ceilidh."
He turned his eyes up at Draco. "And then you arrived, and you know the rest. Now, can we please get moving again?"
"I'm not
"Do you think - I mean, I've really missed you," Harry blurted. It occurred to him that it had only been two fucking days since he'd seen Draco, and felt silly. "Do you think I could just have a hug?" The whole thing made him feel like he was 12 years old again.
"Right. Erm. I'll be right back. Don't move." He gently pushed Draco to lean against the bar.
"He's fine," Draco said, though he struggled to keep his voice even. "He just had to go out."
"Just
Draco said nothing, and Pierce barked a laugh.
who might be there.
"Do you think it was thunder?" It felt like a foolish question as soon as he asked it.
"Of course not. I don't remember who they were. They died, actually."
Draco looked into the kitchen, which was also tiny and resembled the one Lister had shown them, with faded yellow walls and a vague air of neglect.
Potter frowned. "No idea. The obvious guess is the people we were investigating. My gut says otherwise."
Pierce, that fucker.
Draco didn't say another word until they were inside the supermarket.
Emily set her cup down. "No photos?"
Harry leapt out of his chair and dashed to the bedroom, throwing on his least wrinkled pair of trousers and a red jumper hanging off the edge of his bed. He jammed his feet into his shoes and threw on his coat. Outside, it was still snowing, and Harry revelled in the quiet solitude while he speed-walked down the path.
The knocking became insistent.
He awoke early the next morning and clutched at his lower back as he sat up, stifling a groan of pain. The fucking sofa.
Potter rolled his eyes. He looked annoyed, exasperated.
It was for the best. Draco kept telling himself that. He would believe it eventually.
He sank to his knees and covered his eyes.
"Nobody's going to care. These are just
"Is that what you want?"
There were several things he'd
Draco slammed the cupboard shut and glared at him.
"'Thank you' is fine, though you did the hard work. I'm merely recognising it."
"Erm, sure. Yes, I need to lie down."
"Is that all?" Robards said from behind his cluttered desk. Sunlight poured in from the enchanted windows.
"Good?" Potter asked, draping himself over Draco.
It was an uncomfortably intimate image. But then, their closeness was borne out of necessity. There was nothing they could do about it except embrace it.
"I don't know."
It was nice—it was more than nice, even though Harry struggled to coordinate his movements. But fingers were no substitute for a cock, and Draco well remembered how Harry felt inside him. He needed that again, and so he used one hand to ruffle Harry's still-damp hair.
"Fine."
"I need to finish this first." Draco indicated to the parchment he'd been using to log entries about his assignment. "And I've got my one-to-one with Robards."
"Is that a problem?" Draco turned and walked back.
"They're not supposed to."
"You know," Potter said, "it would be great if you made an effort to get along with the people here." He opened the fridge and pulled out a package of chicken thighs, an onion, potatoes, and asparagus.
"Touch me," he said, hoping he didn't sound as needy as he felt, and Potter didn't blink, didn't even breathe as he slid a finger inside.
"It looks like you win, doesn't it?" Jeremy said.
"Curious," he murmured, twisting the end of his moustache around a finger. "Very curious."
Draco exchanged a look with Harry, and they made their way to Robards' office. They sat down in front of his desk, which was littered with stacks of parchment.
"Yeah," Harry said. "It feels like home here. No place has really felt that way since Hogwarts."
"Now that's more like it." She made her way over and sat across from Harry.
The plants and shrubbery were a dull, muted brown, but a smile lit up Draco's face at the sight of it all. This was their home.
As he locked the door to the shop and began the walk home, Draco paused at the spot where he and Potter usually split ways. He knew where Potter lived, of course. He remembered the address from the land deed Potter had shoved at him nearly a lifetime ago. All for a blanket. All for this.
didn't," Draco said.
Browning, never one for much chatter, hung his coat on the rack by the door, poured himself a cup of coffee, and disappeared among the shelves.
As he prepared to leave his house one morning, Draco stood in the bedroom for a long moment and eyed a large box sitting on the floor. He shrunk it with his wand, then tucked both into his jacket pocket. His walk to the bookshop was distracted. He trampled several patches of delicate flowers signalling the early arrival of spring. Immediately upon entering, he went into the tiny store room in the back and removed the box from his pocket to enlarge and then open it.
Draco stepped closer to Potter, so close he could almost smell his hair. He draped his arms over Potter's shoulders and leant towards his ear.
"I'm closing the shop," Draco said in a soft voice. He looked like he wanted to say more.
Nobody was there.
Since he could no longer travel by Floo or Apparition, Draco was stuck taking the train back home that day. He didn't mind though. Sunday afternoon didn't seem to be a terribly busy time, and he had an entire compartment to himself. He sat watching the landscape change, fingering the portkey in his pocket. He wondered how much longer he had left. He wondered if he would actually use the portkey, if it came to that.
Draco nodded slowly. "All right."
Because it was someone else who knew anonymous tips weren't truly anonymous. Someone who didn't want to get caught.
"And what makes you believe he was looking for your location?"
As soon as he set his quill down, Draco launched into his prepared speech. "Sir, I've been doing some thinking over the weekend and—"
"But I'm working right now." He poked Potter's arm. "You're a lot of work, by the way."
"Everything!"
The rest of summer proceeded without much fanfare. There were a lot of tourists that year, and Draco's bookshop saw a number of visitors. Thankfully, his health seemed to remain stagnant, which was more than he could ask for these days. And most nights as he closed the shop, Potter would say something like, "I'll be back with dinner," or "Chips and sandwiches tonight?"
"What do you mean? You've got to stay here."
"It's funny. I've heard people say the same thing about you."
"I don't want this to stop," Draco blurted.
His fingers closed around the card and crushed it, but he stopped as the thick cardstock began to bend and set it on the arm of the sofa.
"I don't know. Listen to me, maybe? God, you're such an arse."
know," Robards added, "for security. You'll get all the details when we're finished here."
"I'm looking for Henry."
Draco yelped in surprise and quickly lost himself to the sensation. Potter wanted this as badly as he did, and he wasn't afraid to show it. There was something reassuring and sexy about that, and he watched Potter's face as he began stroking himself. Draco didn't want this to end, but his release built up quickly.
, but he tried his best to ignore it. In front of Healer Whitby's office, he knocked.
"I wanted to pick the best fruit."
"What happens now?" Draco asked.
"Robards called me in on Saturday. I've got a new case." Barclay rolled his eyes. "If you can call it that."
Someone who logged the tip themselves, purposefully omitting any identifying information, because there was none.
This was ridiculous.
getting the last laugh."
"No. We can, with your permission. Or you can tell them."
As he prepared to Apparate back home, the door swung open and Potter stepped in, shaking water off.
He looked at the clock when he got out of the shower, towelling his hair dry. It was something he did more and more often these days, always checking the time. It passed so quickly, or at least it seemed to. Its steady, stubborn progression drove Harry mad. It felt like there was nothing he could do to capture even just a few seconds of it.
"Quit?" Potter turned off the telly and looked at him. His fingers tightened around Draco's ankle. "Why?"
Robards sighed. "MacDonald and Jennings are more than capable of handling this on their own."
"I really couldn't say." He slid the piece of parchment back into the stack and placed everything back in the box.
They shook their heads. Draco's heart felt as though it was going to pound out of his chest, so it was probably best to avoid coffee. They each took a scroll from Lister and went back to opposite sides of the room. Draco unrolled the parchment with dread and scanned it.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand, feeling unreasonably pleased.
Draco nodded.
"Hmm?" Draco used his wand to levitate a pile of socks into his bag, then turned to look.
Draco shook his head, or perhaps the pub was moving. "I'm never leaving whilst you're still… not leaving." Hmm. That didn't come out right.
He caught sight of the Daily Prophet clipping, with Potter's stupid face looking up at him, and snatched it away just as the living, breathing version came to a halt in front of the counter.
Three Sundays per month, Draco stayed home, assembling jigsaw puzzles and reading books all day. One Sunday per month, he Apparated to an alley in London just next to St. Mungo's, where he entered and made his way upstairs to the fourth floor. Occasionally, he exchanged a nod with the Welcome Witch as he strode right past. He never had to deal with her.
"I know you."
"What? You've been here... how long? And you haven't tried any of the restaurants?" Potter looked incredulous.
"Glad to see you've learnt some self-awareness."
"Only on days you're here. Robards already said you could."
That sent Potter on his way. Victory.
"No!"
"There you are!" Barclay said. He sat at a desk surrounded by a small mountain of boxes containing records. "Where the fuck have you been all morning?"
But he wasn't wrong. Draco felt as though he'd been run down by a troll. He had been testing out combinations of potions to find something that helped his respiratory problems and did not make him feel like hell. Whitby had said it would take a bit of trial and error. Well, it had certainly been a trial. And this whole thing was starting to feel like a gross error.
But things had changed, hadn't they?
Potter looked over his shoulder. Their gazes met, and Draco froze. Without thinking, he stood and walked to Potter, who was sweating.
"Better."
"What does it mean, then?"
Their table didn't win.
"You should at least clean the dishes, since I cooked."
"Your
"So Robards trusts you," Draco said. He had to, if he let Barclay in here with no oversight.
Including Draco.
A sheepish grin broke out over Potter's face. "Sorry. I just like to help. If there's anything I can do..."
It was a good idea, and so Draco kicked off his shoes and went to lie on the bed. Potter followed and lay on the opposite end, turning on his side to face him.
"Well, doesn't that just figure," Mrs. Wilder said, shaking her head. "That boy holds everyone at arm's length. Even when romance comes smacking him in the face, he won't just accept it."
"Here, just watch me—" Draco reached for the map Harry had splayed open, but Harry snatched it out of reach, crumpling up several of the sections.
"I - I have to do something."
Potter added his jacket to the coat rack and walked towards Draco, who averted his eyes. He'd seen people walk before. There was nothing special about Potter
A wild urge overtook him, beckoning him to go and visit Potter. It took everything in him not to. Nothing good could come of it. He needed to accept that Potter was out of his life and move on. Draco had made his peace with everyone else exiting his life. This was no different.
"Excellent work."
He wrinkled his nose at the stale air inside and tried to remember what Lister had said about lights. Something about the wall.
Potter stepped out of the bathroom and sat on the far corner of the bed. "How do you feel?"
It had taken a while.
"I think so. No. I don't know."
He took a deep breath, bracing himself, and downed each potion as quickly as possible. Pain and discomfort overtook him, but Draco welcomed the feelings for once.
, it bloody well isn't. I need to sleep on a firm surface."
Lister frowned, but continued. "I work with wizards and witches who are to have extensive interaction with the Muggle world. I've been informed that you're going to be living amongst them for a period of time."
As though to prove it, he pulled Potter back on top of him and captured his mouth in another kiss. He ran his hands over the smooth skin of Potter's back, letting his fingers settle on Potter's arse and squeezing.
"Hey Malfoy, we need more coffee," said someone - Browning, it turned out. Draco wanted to kill him.
"Deep breaths," said Whitby, his voice low.
"Yeah. How many have you had?"
"Erm, what he means," Potter said, "is that we didn't get together until later."
"It's not about going slow," Draco said. "We don't need to go slow." There probably wasn't enough time to go slow.
He felt helpless in the face of their living arrangement, however.
Relieved and embarrassed, Draco looked at his bowl of pasta. "And I really just want a Chocolate Frog."
"No."
"Fine. Remember to pick it up later."
Potter lived at Hillside Cottage, and as Draco approached, he saw that unlike his own house, Potter's was appropriately named. To his immense relief, he also saw that lights were on inside. And despite his original intent, he found that instead of walking right past it, his legs carried him up the small hill.
Robards threw the stack of parchment onto his desk. "Are you trying to kill me? I'm doing what I can to give you what you've asked for."
It was.
It was selfish, and Draco hated himself for it, for knowing the pain it would ultimately inflict. But it still tempted him, to have just that small glimmer of happiness. He spent a lot of time asking himself 'what if' questions, and the one he could never answer was what if he told Potter about his health problems?
"Shut the door."
. His cold fingers pressed into Harry's back, urging him to thrust harder, groaning when he did.
Something wrapped around his chest, and then Draco remembered.
Harry watched the delicate instruments that sat on a small table next to Draco's bed. They bobbed and rotated and swung back and forth. He had no idea what they were supposed to do. Somebody had probably explained it to him, but he couldn't remember.
Draco gave a lascivious grin and stood. "That's fine, too." He began undoing the buttons on his trousers.
On Level Two, he opted not to get his usual cup of coffee. He felt jittery enough, and every second not spent auditing records was a second wasted.
"If it was him, he'd have come after me already."
"Dammit, Malfoy!" He slammed his fist on his desk, and all the tiny instruments, picture frames, and figurines toppled over. "This is serious! This is exactly what I've been telling you—I'm willing to give you a chance, and this is how you act." When Draco remained quiet, Robards continued. "As I said, this has just come in. A high-profile client needs protection."
Draco expected him to be angry and upset, but Harry looked crestfallen. His shoulders slumped.
"Who wants to know?" Wimple said.
"Yes, but—"
The sound of the door shutting brought him to his senses, and Draco made a mad dash for the store room, locking himself in and yanking potions out of drawers as quickly as he could. He lined them all up on the desk and waved his wand to uncork them. One by one, he downed them all and chucked the empty jars into the box next to his desk. He and Whitby seemed to have finally come to an amenable combination and dosage of potions to regulate his respiratory functionality without leaving him feeling terrible for the entire day. Unfortunately, those potions still had him hunched over the desk in pain for several minutes while his insides swam and he waited for them to take effect.
Over the last few months, a sort of tacit agreement had emerged between them. One of polite indifference. Potter would enter, they would exchange greetings, and Potter would disappear to the rear corner nook with a cup of coffee. In the evening, Draco would remind his customers he'd be closing the shop, and he and Potter would exchange farewells.
"Then why did you move here?"
Draco shut the door and sat next to Harry. "I'm fine. Maybe." He shook his head. "I don't know. Robards doesn't think—" He turned to look at Harry. "It's Pierce. Pierce is after you."
He kissed Potter again. Relief washed over him when Potter kissed him back, slowly and softly. He didn't want this to end.
"Any chance you know Claire MacDonald?"
A ball of dread grew in Draco's stomach as he read. It wasn't enough to live as a Muggle. Now they had to live as
"You can't possibly watch the client and conduct an investigation at the same time. Both of these are full-time jobs."
Barclay looked at him in surprise. "Well. Good. And you can get me that coffee now."
"Four years, and no."
Draco closed his eyes as he thought for a moment. "There is no difference." It didn't matter if there was.
"All right," Potter said.
focussing on Potter. Finding out who wanted to kill him was focussing on Potter.
"We need to do the shopping today," he muttered.
Sometimes Potter came into the shop a little earlier on Saturday. Draco tried to read his book, but it was a clear, brisk day, and the shop was uncharacteristically busy. His mouth went dry each time the door opened, and he gave a pained smile to everyone that walked in.
He was already beginning to feel guilty. Like he should push Potter away. He knew he would have to someday, to spare him the same pain as everyone else he cared for. Though - did he really care for Potter? That seemed a stretch.
"I've already got started, but yeah. You can start helping immediately. I was just about to head over, in fact."
Rutherford leafed through the enormous stack until, finally, he made an affirmative noise, pulled out a sheet, and read.
Draco set his spoon down. "I'm listening."
Harry's mind reeled. He could only stare, as the sight of a hot and bothered Draco sapped his brain of any coherent thought. It seemed to him that Draco could very much do with getting fucked just then. His cock strained against his trousers, still pressed against Harry's. It took everything in him to keep his hips still, because he so badly wanted to see Draco come undone, and this happy lapse in judgement might be his only chance.
?" Draco yanked the quilt down. "What's she doing here?" he whispered.
"Constellation." He carded his fingers through Draco's hair, short and soft, and watched his eyes close in contentment.
Draco looked so lost as he nodded against the pillow, gazing into Harry's eyes. "Don't leave me," he said.
"Oh, brilliant! Although, I'm really liking this stuff." Potter indicated his nearly-empty cup.
Odd. Last night seemed so far away now. Draco hardly remembered what it had been like to have Potter kissing him, and he found himself staring at Potter's lips.
In all likelihood, it would drive him away. Draco decided he could live with that. Rejection would at least shut the door on possibility, and then he could forget about this and move on. In fact, that might be preferable.
"Don't stop," he whined. "I'm close. I'm really close." As soon as the words left his mouth, he felt his arse clench around Potter's cock as his pleasure crested, and he caught himself with a hand to Potter's chest as he spurted all over him.
He shifted over until they sat so close their thighs pressed together. Potter placed a hand on Draco's leg and squeezed lightly.
And so Harry hadn't told anyone from their past, aside from Hermione and Ron.
Potter displayed no mercy to the other people dancing. He stepped on several feet and spun awkwardly around. His enthusiasm was infectious—those around him seemed to be in higher spirits than anyone else. He seemed to glow, though perhaps that was the lights.
Harry decided he hated mornings, hated having that precious intimacy stolen away from him day after day. Of course, Harry hated nights as well. He dreaded going to sleep. The mere thought of waking up was bad enough. The thought of waking up without Draco was unbearable.
"You'll get thrown in Azkaban, you git. Get his wand and Stun him. We'll take him to the Ministry and let them deal with him."
Draco's heart squeezed painfully as he searched for the right words. But there were none. "You're my friend, too," he said slowly.
He didn't want to fall asleep. He wanted to be awake, in case Draco needed anything. It was the least he could do.
Draco set the file on his bedside table and slid under the covers. It had been an exhausting day, and no amount of caffeine could keep him awake now.
Draco stared at the file again, feeling deflated. "There's nothing I can do."
Pierce shrugged. "Only Potter. But if Lawrence's death caused him pain, I'm not sorry he died."
This was getting ridiculous.
special.
"All right, fine," he said, and trudged after Potter into the kitchen. "What do you want me to do?" He sat at the table and rested his chin on his hand.
"You were in shock. You might've missed something," Draco said. "Please, Potter. I want to help." He wasn't accustomed to begging, but Draco realised then he truly wanted to help him.
It only took a few strokes, and Draco started trembling again. "I'm coming," he cried, and he squeezed his eyes shut as his orgasm rendered him a panting, babbling mess. Harry continued driving into him, though it wasn't long before his breathing became more ragged. He bent forwards and hugged Draco to him as he came with one last thrust.
It wasn't too often.
The next week, it was Potter's turn to sleep on the bed.
For some reason, Draco couldn't say it. It was more difficult than he thought to tell Potter that someone at the Ministry wanted to kill him. Nor could he formulate any words about this thing between them. All he knew as he looked into Potter's eyes was a fierce pang of longing.
"I'm just here for a good time."
"They're anonymous, you know."
"They've interviewed nearly everyone on Level Five," Draco said.
Harry had a hungry look in his eyes, and he captured Draco's mouth in a possessive kiss and ground their cocks together. Draco let out a surprised cry and grabbed hold of Harry's arse.
Outside, snow continued to fall. Harry decided to just sit back and enjoy the show while he sipped his coffee. It was beautiful here. Quiet, relaxing, cozy. He wondered if Draco's home was similarly warm and inviting, and the thought of that, of being in Draco's home, made his heart race.
"Erm, Malfoy?"
"Fine," he said.
The entire world felt different as Draco strode through the Atrium on Friday morning. A heavy cloud of portent seemed to hang over everything. People looked at Draco differently, and he warded them off with a glare.
"It never comes out right. Besides, you've got the good stuff. You and Draco."
Even now, only a few months later, there was a marked difference in Draco's appearance when compared to the photo. Now his skin was tinged slightly grey, and he looked exhausted all the time. And that was on a good day.
Draco hated to do anything Potter told him, and he had no interest in cooking. It wasn't a skill he would ever need.
"Robards likes me," Potter said, starting the car. "Just remember that."
"Good book?"
"What do you mean, it's an Auror?"
"What?"
"I do." There was a tinge of annoyance in Potter's voice. "I like some of these people, and I think it'd be nice if you got to know them."
Her eyes flitted between the two of them when Draco took a seat on the sofa. "Now tell me, how did the two of you meet?"
"Any chest pain?"
"Let's talk about this tomorrow."
After a painful few hours, Lister pronounced Potter's driving to be satisfactory.
Draco's heart sank. Pierce. If he was in his cubicle, he could see straight into Jennings'.
Robards nodded. "I apologise that both your lives were in danger tonight," he said. "However, you remembered your training and conducted yourselves admirably. And most importantly, you subdued your attacker. I believe we have a solid case against him. He'll be in Azkaban for a long time." He laced his fingers together on top of his desk.
Draco looked around the car park to make sure no Muggles were near. "Nobody's going to know." He reached into the glove box for his wand and cast a Stasis Charm at their shopping.
"We'll talk more once you return next week."
The drinks, the Muggles, the obnoxiously loud noises—Draco remembered the last pub quiz well enough. He lay the tea towel out to dry and leant back against the counter.
Liar.
"It's been a tough morning."
There was a sour taste in Draco's mouth the next morning, and his head hurt.
Draco looked at Potter, who smiled at him. It wasn't a goofy, bashful smile like his Chocolate Frog photo, either. Perhaps it was because they had been living in such close quarters, but Draco didn't feel uncomfortable being this close to him.
"We can try a few more potions. However, you really - and I can not emphasise this enough - you really aren't in a fit state to travel by Floo or Apparition any longer. In addition to everything else, your bones are getting fragile, and they can't handle such trauma."
"Yes, really."
The worst part was that Draco wanted to say yes. He didn't
"God, I was worried about you!" Harry said. He looked as though he'd been pacing the living room.
"A month," Draco said.
Draco pressed his hands to his ears. "Stop! This is awful!"
"What?"
Draco picked up the jar and swirled the potion around. "Did you tell my parents?"
"What's happened? Did you find something?" Barclay said. He looked sleepy. It was hard to imagine what that felt like.
Potter at least had the good sense to order a pizza for dinner, though Draco didn't even register tasting it.
"Oi, where are you going?" Barclay asked.
Tentatively, Harry moved a little closer, made to reach vaguely towards Draco with a hand. In the next moment, all he knew was the feeling of being pushed down onto the sofa and a body laying on top of his. Draco's face was inches above his own, and he scrutinised Harry with a look that made him shiver. He thought he might die from anticipation - it seemed very possible just then - and so he carded a hand through Draco's hair and pulled his head down until their lips pressed together.
"Well, we've been administering potions to help you feel comfortable." He indicated the instruments on the table. "If you're in too much discomfort, we can always give you more."
And on Thursday, Draco decided he had enough and stayed home whilst Potter went to the pub.
Potter ran a hand through his horribly messy hair. Somehow. "Look, I'm -"
"So you've said. Why did you get reassigned?"
Harry sunk back into his chair. His relief was palpable. "Thanks."
"You've got your wand ready?" Harry whispered. He fished the keys from his trouser pocket.
An identical, neat stack appeared next to the original. He repeated the spell a few more times, then set his wand aside with a satisfied nod.
"…We're still lost."
"Hm? Oh, it's…"
"What's it like?"
Emily's mouth formed an 'O' shape. "You went to school together
"Where are you off to?" Barclay asked.
Footsteps thundered all around. Heavy thuds and shouts sounded as people tripped over each other.
Harry shrugged and popped one of Draco's biscuits into his mouth. "We were working with a few other Aurors on an assignment," he said. "I don't remember what it was about, but during one of the raids we conducted, his wife was killed."
"I'm not sure yet," Draco murmured. He moved several boxes out of the way until he found the book laying under the desk. And sure enough, a tiny map covered the entire inside back cover. It was faded and difficult to read, but with some effort, he could make out a section that seemed promising—'Highly Confidential, Ministry-Controlled Locations'.
"So?"
"Hang on, I'm looking for that bloke's address!"
Draco tried to keep a neutral face and nodded at Potter, who was dressed in hideous old clothes and sweating as though he'd been doing some sort of manual labour. His skin was red, and bits of his hair stuck to his face.
Jennings reached to pull Draco into his cubicle, then took out his wand and cast, "
"Yes. I'll need your cloak again next Friday."
It was nice not to think for a while, and the fresh air helped to clear Draco's mind. It was almost as enjoyable as walking through the Manor grounds.
"That's a nice idea, but we won't always know where the other person is." At least, Draco hoped not. That would require a level of closeness he didn't think he could tolerate.
He buried his face in Harry's neck and silently wished for many more days like this.
"Good then. Are you ready to leave?"
Annoyed, Draco shut the compartment and set to work, making it look as though nobody had forced their way in. Hopefully, he wouldn't cock up this part.
It hadn't occurred to Draco to wonder where and when Potter usually wanked. He assumed Potter did it in the shower, just as he usually did. But perhaps there were nights and mornings where Potter wanked in this bed.
"Wrong again. No wonder you've never been promoted," Pierce said. "Or is it because nobody is willing to trust a Death Eater? Or"—he paused to let a smile stretch across his face—"do you think it might be because certain Aurors in the department kept spreading misinformation about you to Robards?"
"I don't think so."
Lister pushed another button. The light went out, and the noise stopped. "Well, that's how you use it."
"Where wouldn't I go?"
"Took you long enough," he said, but there was a twinkle in his eye. He set their book of crosswords aside and swung his legs over the side of the bed. "I'm going to take a quick shower myself. Keep the bed warm for me."
"I figured you would," Harry said softly. "So which one is your favourite?"
Draco grasped Potter's arm and wriggled out from underneath it. He stepped quietly into the bathroom and made certain to lock the door.
Potter trailed his fingers up Draco's thigh and leant in close. "That comes later."
"Whitby," said Draco. "Didn't think I'd see your arse again."
Jeremy gave a toothy grin. "Well, you two have fun sorting that out," he said. "Maybe I'll see you this weekend."
Draco was in the middle of writing his weekly log entry. He paused.
Someone knocked at their front door.
Potter had cold feet.
"Let me guess. We're starting today."
Draco decided to leave them there for now. He had breakfast, minus coffee. He turned on the Muggle tele-thing. He didn't really watch it very often. Usually just on holidays. It had come with the house, and he hadn't bothered to get rid of it.
Draco searched his eyes, then dared to voice a horrible thought. "What if it was someone Apparating?"
"Pardon?"
Potter looked so relieved then. All the tension from the week seemed to drain out of him in three seconds.
Draco watched from the corner of his eye as Harry tried to straighten out and properly fold the map, but it was a lost cause.
He was on a mission.
Harry scooted a bit closer. "I've got one. What do you do everyday in your store room?"
"He didn't say?"
Rosemary nodded at him and scribbled into her notebook. "Excellent," she said.
"Fine."
. They were now both senior Aurors, two ranks above Draco. It was unthinkable that in six years, Potter had been promoted twice, whilst Draco continued to languish at the most junior level.
And so he gently rolled Potter off him and broke their kiss to follow his hand as it trailed down Potter's chest and over his stomach. He wrapped his fingers around Potter's cock and gave it a few lazy strokes, trying not to smirk at the sharp intake of breath from Potter.
When Potter finally emerged from the shelves again a few hours later to leave, he gave another, slightly more certain nod to Draco.
did Draco ever insist on keeping that fucking portkey in his bedside table?
He paced the length of the shack until he counted fifty times that he'd gone back and forth. Perhaps it was time to leave.
"Are you listening to yourself? You're making excuses for him."
"Well, I'm all you've got out here. Talk or don't. It makes no difference to me."
Harry blinked. Hell - in all the mess of last night, he'd completely forgotten. "Erm, sorry about that," he said. He tried to smile, but his face hurt.
Draco failed to keep a smug smile from spreading across his face. "I am."
Draco looked down. Moonlight shone in through the window, and he could make out Harry's eager face looking up at him from between his legs. It was an obscene display. It was sexy.
But everywhere held memories that were just too much. Somehow, despite how bare and unadorned Draco kept the place, they'd managed to make it a cosy, welcoming home. It was oppressive. It was hard to breathe.
"Oh? Think you've got me figured out?"
"That's not true."
Now that Potter had volunteered himself to help plan Bonfire Night celebrations, his Monday afternoons were completely occupied.
"Pierce essentially accused my father of being guilty," Draco said. "I really hate him."
"Erm, yeah," Potter said.
He glared at the Chocolate Frog card.
"Right."
"You've had the same partner for six years?"
Villagers greeted them, and Jeremy waved them over. He sat at a table in the corner and already had a pint and a cigar lit. They bought two glasses of lemonade and joined him.
The sun had begun its descent by the time Potter jerked the car to a halt in front of their house.
"What now?" he asked.
Draco frowned. "If you're implying that you care, then perhaps I should find a new Healer."
shop, after all. But he stood behind the counter, frozen in indecision all day. He didn't trust himself not to get into a shouting match with Potter, which was the last thing he wanted among all these people who had no idea of their past.
Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. In the event he didn't submit his resignation letter at the end of all this, he absolutely had to get a new partner assigned. He couldn't maintain his sanity whilst auditing files all the time.
Harry laughed. "Cheerful people can still be murderers."
Draco shrugged. He didn't want to say 'yes'. That would make it real. As real as something fake could be. If his parents could see him now.
He thought over all their interactions over the last few months, trying to discern whether he'd given away any information Pierce could use to determine Draco was the one protecting Potter.
Potter made a beeline to a shop, and moments later, they stepped out carrying two large ice cream cones.
He held his breath as he passed by MacDonald's and Jennings' cubicles, thankful when they didn't call him over. Either they didn't see him or they didn't suspect him of anything—Draco didn't care which.
"No!" A wild look overtook Potter. "I've already lost a partner there. I can't—I don't want you to go."
Mrs. Wilder turned back to face Harry. "I want every detail."
Potter indicated to the fridge. "Take out the carrots, celery, and onion and chop them up into small pieces."
written across it in six different languages.
"You're scuffing my shoes!"
Draco looked up and saw Robards glaring at him.
"I'm going to kill you for that," he said, once Potter finally finished and they were back in the car.
He was easy to find—a magnificent pair of horns grew from his head.
It occurred to Draco that he had no idea what Potter's life was like before this.
But it was a rare good day in a string of monotonous, frustrating days.
Draco found it exhausting. From what he had observed, Potter seemed to relish it. Worse, Potter seemed to weasel his way in with all the locals in record time. Even old Mr. Browning - the last of the village council to approve Draco's plan to open the bookshop - regularly exchanged more than two sentences with Potter. Nobody seemed immune to his charm.
"Yes, Muggles." Potter frowned. "They're people too. And they organise walks around the area."
"Well, how much time does he need?" she asked.
Before going to work the next morning, Draco stuffed Potter's Invisibility Cloak into a bag and jotted down a list of names from the suspect list. They were people who hadn't been interviewed yet, who stood out to Draco as being more suspicious for one reason or another.
Lister ignored him and indicated a larger white box fitted underneath the counter. This had a window, too, but it was circular.
Harry tried desperately to keep himself occupied.
He turned to see Pierce smirking at him.
He turned around, hoping desperately that he didn't look like he was fleeing. His eyes caught sight of a sign outside the market advertising a sale on chicken, and he darted inside.
"There you are!" Robards roared.
Potter liked to watch a mystery show, and Draco often found himself getting distracted by it. The picture on the telly was of some Muggle in a suit talking about news though, which held no interest to him, so he smashed more buttons and shut it off.
"You've got to be joking. Fuck Robards."
"I wish I could say the same." Draco threw himself into the chair in front of Whitby's desk.
The next week, it began to rain.
In the living room, Potter lay on the sofa clutching a pillow. His mouth hung open, and his foot dangled off one end—he was uncouth, even in sleep. Draco stood watching the rise and fall of his chest for a few minutes, then turned on the spot to Apparate.
"What's wrong?" Harry whispered. He'd never seen Draco look quite so sad or lost.
"I don't care. Both. Just fuck me, I want you," Draco blurted. He was too aroused to feel embarrassed about how much he wanted this any more.
The table broke into laughter whilst Potter stared at the cards on the table.
"Get up, Malfoy. Dinner's ready."
Draco didn't need to be told twice.
"I don't want you to be the first thing I see in the morning."
"You didn't hate that."
He sat on the edge of the bed, looking down at himself. He'd just put on his clothes and shoes. The same ones he'd been wearing when they'd first arrived. They looked the same and fit the same, but something about them was different.
Everyone applauded, and the group broke apart as someone on the stage started the radio.
Potter nodded, and Draco went to the kitchen, relieved. It was nice to have someone prepare tea for you, and he felt a secret thrill at knowing exactly how Potter took his.
At his desk, Draco stared idly at his eagle feather quill and stroked it. A blank piece of parchment sat in front of him. Robards' words played through his mind again, and he frowned in disbelief. It certainly didn't feel as though he was willing to give Draco any chances. All the assignments he and Barclay had been given were dead simple. They usually spent more of their time on paperwork.
Draco smiled. He looked relieved. "I love you, too."
Lewis's cheeks reddened. Some people looked irresistible when they blushed. Lewis did not. "Since you're a Death Eater," he croaked.
"Well, consider yourself lucky then."
Not that there were many people in the Ministry on a Saturday.
"Go to Magical Evidence Processing. They've finished analysing the samples I sent."
"Let me worry about that," Potter said softly.
"I don't, sir. I'm just surprised."
Potter stepped into the room, leaning against a wall. "Erm, so why are you here?"
"God, who decorated this place?" Draco muttered.
He'd had a lot of those lately.
"Well, you've got to learn how to cook here, because I'm not going to do all the work."
Draco thought for a moment. Perhaps this really could work. "Sure."
Ordinarily, he liked to go into work early. Now especially, he wanted to leave before Potter awoke.
He continued to sit and scratch at the paper as daylight faded until warm hands wrapped around his shoulders.
"What more do you want to know?"
"What?" Draco looked at him. "What's wrong?"
Someone shouted a spell, and Harry's world went black.
Just a while longer.
"Yes."
"I think they're still out by the sofa." Harry grinned at the memory of last night. "Hurry up, I need to let her in," he called, and followed Draco out, eyes on his arse.
"My office, Malfoy. Now."
"Yes."
"We have that staff meeting in an hour, though."
"Did you find something?" Barclay tried again.
Chairs scraped against the floor as people pushed back from their tables to leave. Draco watched Potter scurry over to Rosemary.
Interesting. The thought hadn't even crossed Potter's mind that they might be back in the wizarding world next month. He'd got used to living out here.
Harry nodded. He realised how stiffly he was sitting and forced himself to lean back.
And he stood to leave.
That was when he saw the photo album Mrs. Wilder had given him.
"I'm staying with you," he said. "Anyway, I'm not hungry." And he realised it was true. His stomach had been in knots ever since they'd arrived.
Draco thought back to earlier that afternoon when she'd told him to fuck off. "We've exchanged words."
They showered together, and it was all they could do to finish tea before they fell back into bed again. Potter was insatiable. He made Draco feel alive. And although it was Potter's turn to have the bed that week, when night fell, there was no question that Draco would join him.
"Too much time has passed. There'll be too many holes in his memory."
"I suppose not," Potter said.
"Venomous Tentacula seeds are a non-tradeable substance," Draco said.
"Let him go," Draco said. He scrambled to come up with some kind of strategy. Right. Well, he and Harry were still alive. He had to keep Pierce talking, lest he carry out his ultimate task.
"Finally." Pierce directed his wand at Harry and said, "
But the Kilmington countryside wasn't bad, especially once they veered off the road and into the forest. It was almost nice, actually.
"What I think doesn't matter. You're just a murderous prick."
"That's it. Then we'll flip them over. Whoever has the highest hand wins." Jeremy grinned.
"It's my last one," Potter said, "but I think you need it more than I do."
"Potter! Where are you?"
"Well?" Robards took an appreciative whiff of his coffee and looked up expectantly.
At least tomorrow was Friday, and he'd have work to serve as a distraction.
"It was too much work to put them on tonight."
"Why does anyone do anything when they're in a bad situation? I didn't have a choice."
"I'll get it." Potter got up from the sofa.
Barclay scratched his head and yawned. "Well, the access book. There's an entry created each time someone accesses any of the files." He nodded towards the book in Draco's hands.
Draco inched closer to him until their bodies nearly pressed together. Heat radiated from Potter, which felt incredible against Draco's skin. Being this close to him was almost as intoxicating as all that ale he'd drunk.
This problem wouldn't go away on its own.
"Ah, that I'm afraid is a bit of trial and error," Lister said. "You'll learn." He pressed another button that caused light to appear inside and a loud humming noise started.
"Splendid," Emily said, clapping her hands together. "I'll bring round your tickets in a few days." She stood and smoothed her skirt. "I'd best be on my way, though. I told Philip I'd only be gone a few."
He opened his eyes.
Draco squinted. There was someone vaguely familiar who looked to be moving towards him, holding his gaze. He tried to place the man. Perhaps he had been in the Wizengamot.
Draco bristled.
Potter stared in disbelief. "Why not? Why not give things a chance? I mean, you already know I'm not here to out you to the Wizarding world, or terrorise you, or - or anything. I feel this connection to you that -"
Barclay nodded. "I know. Do you want to get lunch?"
Draco gave an affected shrug. "Sure."
"Someone
"Help me with dinner?" Potter asked.
Whitby sighed, pursing his lips. "I'll be blunt. Your heart is very weak. It's unlikely you'll last the night."
! And there's no end in sight." Barclay waved his hands in exasperation.
He was not okay.
It was the last thing Draco needed. He had long ago severed any meaningful relationships. He had, in fact, cut ties with the entire Wizarding world, save for Whitby. It had been an ordeal, and he'd worked hard since then to always keep some distance between himself and those who knew him.
If Potter was trying to make up for his colossal fuck-up, Draco was going to accept it. For now. He'd tear into Potter once he felt better.
"I'm going to the Ministry tomorrow," he said.
." Potter tightened his grip. "It's my decision."
It was going to be a long night.
"That's everything," Rosemary said. "We'll reconvene next week at the same time,." She motioned to Potter. "Let's chat before you leave, dear."
He kissed Draco's forehead and felt a mix of joy and guilt when grey eyes blinked open.
Afterwards, in the spirit of keeping things fun and interesting, Jeremy pulled out a deck of cards and began demonstrating what he called 'magic' tricks. Draco exchanged a look with Potter, who decided to take up Jeremy on his promise that he could play cards with anyone and win.
Harry sighed, picked up the journal, and moved to sit in his favourite chair out in the secluded nook. He clutched the journal in his lap and stared out at the river for a long time. He couldn't say how long - the clock on the wall had died, and it was entirely too quiet.
"You don't look sorry." But there was a glint in Harry's eyes. "Is there something I can do to help?"
"So, what did you think?"
Draco nodded. He could understand that. The drinks, the dancing, the lights, and the smell of summer. It was overwhelming.
There it was.
"Book-keeping."
Whitby cast whatever spells he needed in order to assess how terribly Draco was doing. It took several minutes. Draco focused on the sound of the flames crackling in the fireplace, and Whitby paused at various intervals to scratch notes onto his parchment. Draco waited until he said, "All finished," before opening his eyes.
"I can get you a refill."
"Potter," he began, and green eyes looked into his. "What have you told people about... this? My shop?"
No, it wasn't bad here at all. Especially with Harry.
Draco took more of him in, feeling a rush of satisfaction when Potter's thighs began trembling. It was so easy to make him feel good, and he was so wonderfully responsive. His breaths grew shallow and shaky as Draco continued sucking on him, and all too soon, he felt a hand brush through his hair.
"You were hit with the Septicemia Curse."
"I went for a run," Potter said, and he went into the bedroom. Draco heard the bathroom door shut and the sound of water running, then settled back into his book.
"That doesn't matter! We're not supposed to leave the village. How can I trust you in future?"
"The rest of the week?" Harry suggested.
Bed? "What time is it?"
He sat down and flipped back through the pages, past the point Barclay began auditing everything. He scanned the pages as quickly as possible until his gaze finally landed on an entry marked the 2nd of September.
Everything felt so empty.
"That's all right. I can charm one of the pairs you've got here."
It was a relief when Potter went out Saturday afternoon to go walking with his group of Muggle friends.
With any luck, he'd just awoken Potter.
"I must commend you on a job well done. Very well done, in fact."
"I don't think I've ever seen anything more beautiful in my life."
He sat down in the chair, across from Potter, who looked up at him in surprise.
Draco swatted him away. He'd look however he pleased.
Draco's cries were getting desperate, and Harry felt his cock stiffen just a little bit more against his tongue, felt the first spurt of come hit the back of his throat.
"What?" Draco spluttered. "No!" This couldn't be happening.
Draco sat picking at his half-eaten piece of cake when Potter returned.
"Erm," Potter said with his characteristic eloquence.
Draco gritted his teeth. They really had no business with these Muggles. This wasn't part of the job description. 'Keep Potter safe'—that was it.
Once everyone at the table greeted her, she leant in and said, "The dancing's set to start up again in a few. I've asked Rosemary if she could say a few words in your honour first though, to commemorate your marriage."
Draco pushed himself up and took the glass Potter held out. The water tasted good, and before he knew it, the glass was empty. Potter fetched his wand from the bedside table and refilled it.
"A flood?" Potter asked.
"There aren't many left. You don't need me to finish them today."
"Potter," he croaked.
He didn't know how to deal with people when they were like this, and whilst a part of him wanted to comfort Potter, another part of him wanted to disappear and come back later, once Potter had sorted himself out.
Potter took his time unpacking, and Draco watched to make sure he didn't take more than half of the wardrobe space.
"I want us to be more than that. I think you do, too."
"Fine."
"Really?"
"Of course," said Potter. His smile had faded, but he still looked earnest. Hopeful.
"Hey, Malfoy."
Draco struggled not to roll his eyes. Of course, Robards would agree to anything Harry suggested. Not that he was going to complain about holiday time.
Draco looked over his shoulder and said, "Another time."
"I dealt with Rosemary. It's your turn."
Of course, Hermione had been right. Writing did help Harry. He wrote everyday. Sometimes just a line or two. Sometimes he filled pages. But he couldn't imagine life without his journal now, and it was just as much a part of him as his glasses.
"Who on Earth would do that?"
Draco scowled. "Let me guess. There's a potion I can take for that."
"Did something happen last week? Or are you still moping about auditing all those records?"
Draco let out a cry of pleasure, and he fought to keep his hips still as Potter sucked experimentally around the head. He spread his legs further, and Potter raised his head to look at him.
Besides, that wasn't how he truly smiled. Not when he meant it.
Harry shrugged. "Why didn't you?"
"Yes."
"Trust me, this has been done before. Everything will be fine."
"It'll be fine. It's a lot of work, and I don't have connections to a lot of people here, so I won't be on my own. I'm working
"I wouldn't have you anywhere near me if I had a choice." Potter unzipped the bag and dumped its contents all over the bed.
He pushed back from the table and quickly put on his shoes, coat, and scarf. With one last look around, he shut the door to his cottage and began what felt like a fateful journey down the path.
He walked quickly along the path to the bookshop, Whitby trailing in his wake. A brisk wind had moved in, and there were few people out in the village that day. A small mercy.
After a chorus of farewells, Draco and Potter were in the car and on their way home.
Harry stared at him incredulously.
Well, not everything. They had their relationship.
Potter frowned. "The Kilmington Ramblers. Yes."
"All morning?" Barclay looked pale and sickly, and his hair was frazzled.
Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair again. "I love you, you know." He hadn't even planned to say it, but the words fell out so easily.
"It's hard to say -"
Potter shook his head.
"Exciting." Draco looked around. "How could anyone work in this room?"
Draco glared. He wanted the bed, but not that badly. "Are you mad?"
"I'm sure it's fine. I'll—"
To Draco's relief, his one-to-one with Robards that Friday was considerably more mellow than the week prior. Robards seemed distracted and kept it short, and Draco rushed to leave afterwards, lest Robards call him back.
"Sure."
It was a long time before either of them said anything.
"Not yet. I was sent to help Barclay straight away last week. Not really sure who to talk to, either."
Harry wished the numbness would return. Experiencing an entire spectrum of feelings all at once hurt too much. One second, his spirits were lifted to great heights at the joy from knowing Draco cared for him, at the prospect of getting to be with him and touch and kiss him. The next, he felt crushed already under suffocating agony. And then he felt angry, because all of this seemed a bit early, a bit pre-emptive and presumptuous besides.
"Ah, so you do own it."
He opened an eye and saw Barclay peering at him. "What now?"
"And will you?"
Draco winced and rubbed his back as best as he could. "I've never slept on the floor in my life."
Mrs. Wilder set down her cup with a loud clatter. "Surely he didn't reject you. How could he?"
He wondered if Potter was going to wank, too, when he awoke, and the idea of Potter panting and thrusting into his hand sent Draco over the edge. He gripped the edge of the countertop and had to bite his lip to keep quiet as waves of pleasure pulsed through his entire body. It was easily the most intense orgasm he'd had in a while, and he stood panting for a long moment afterwards. At least he had the good sense to aim into the sink.
here. But I don't belong in the wizarding world either."
"We can't have owls giving you away. Don't worry, you can come here once per week to collect your post."
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels as if
He snatched the stack of letters and scurried from Robards' office to where MacDonald and Jennings sat. Hopefully MacDonald was in the office today. She hated him slightly less than Jennings.
"Good night," Draco said. Unbidden, the memory of Potter kissing him came forth, and with horror, he realised he was getting hard.
"We have to live with them. You might be fine with having enemies wherever you go, but I'm not so keen on it." And with that, Potter began chopping the onion with gusto.
It also made for cosy evenings, wrapped up in blankets and limbs as Harry and Draco discovered each other's bodies.
Draco felt Harry's hand press against his chest and trail downwards. It was certainly tempting, except his mind was occupied with other thoughts.
"What does it matter to you?" Like he knew anything anyway.
"Oh joy."
"I still can."
Leave it to Potter to ruin the evening.
"Depends. If you asked, I'm sure he'd allow it."
"Shut up!" Potter no longer stared at the parchment. He had turned to face Draco and looked at him with such anger and pain in his eyes that, for a moment, Draco didn't know what to say. And he couldn't look away.
Calm.
It wasn't enough.
His head spun as he made his way to the Confidential Records Office afterwards. It could even be MacDonald or Jennings. The investigation had been slow, and they were excellent Aurors—perhaps one of them was purposefully stifling progress.
The silence that stood between them was interrupted by more loud knocking.
"It was anonymous."
Draco snatched them from him. "I hate driving."
Draco struggled to maintain his composure during his one-to-one with Robards, and he said little.
"You've got to work in the morning. Besides, you're drunk."
Draco stumbled into the bedroom and crawled under the blankets, grateful that it was Potter's turn to have the sofa that week. He kicked his shoes off, then wriggled out of his shirt and trousers and threw them on the floor. Sleep would be great.
Finally, he nodded his head slowly. "All right. I'll send Obliviators first thing Sunday, then."
Back inside, he took out his wand and cast several spells to dust the shelves, sweep the floor, and pour himself a cup of coffee. He locked his wand away in a drawer under the till and drew the curtains back to welcome the sun in, and then finally picked up his cup of coffee, which was now the perfect temperature. He'd arrived at the shop early, so there was enough time left before opening to enjoy it in the rear corner nook that faced the river. It was his favourite spot in the shop.
If Draco had a Time-Turner, he would have gone back to the day he accepted this assignment. He would have handed over his resignation letter and told Robards to fuck off.
He stared at the Chocolate Frog version of Potter for a long moment before stuffing him into his book and slamming it shut. He'd deal with that later.
He tore the blanket away from himself, careful to leave Draco covered. He clung to Harry as always, soft blond hair tickling Harry’s nose with the faint scent of peaches.
"It's for a case, actually," Draco said.
Potter scrubbed and handed over three more dishes before saying, "I reckon I wouldn't look forward to that either. How about you come out with me tomorrow? It's quiz night at the pub."
Potter squirmed and thrust against Draco, eliciting a groan from both of them. This was so much better without all those damn clothes in the way, but he needed more. He needed to have his hands on Potter. All over Potter.
And he stormed towards the lifts, his mind racing.
Draco wrapped a hand around his erection again and began stroking at a measured pace, squeezing lightly around the head that poked out from his foreskin. He knew this wouldn't take long, but he didn't want it to be a utilitarian wank any more. Not with Potter smiling at him. He looked so bashful, as though he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't have been. It was quite an attractive smile after all, Draco had to admit.
Potter gave him a small smile.
This time, Robards upbraided him for visiting the Office of Magical Evidence Processing to check on the status of the potion residue MacDonald had sent two weeks ago. It wasn't his place to figure out what happened. But Draco didn't care. He needed to do something more than babysit Potter.
"Is this with your rambling group of Muggles?"
Draco watched the clock whilst the celebrating continued. After five minutes, he poked his head over the cubicle wall again.
They found a small conservatory, which had two chairs and several pots of dead plants inside. Down a short hallway, there was a bedroom.
He shook his head. "I'm not really sure." He hadn't really thought about it.
Potter raised his eyebrow, then got up and left the kitchen. When he returned, he placed a Galleon next to Draco's plate.
Draco opened his eyes. "I know. It wasn't meant to be."
"Of course," said Potter - a little too eagerly for Draco's liking - and he reached into his bag.
"Right," he said after a long moment and looked at them both. "Potter." He nodded at Potter. "And Malfoy?"
Perhaps Potter had more Slytherin in him than Draco thought.
Draco thought about how Potter ate his ice cream cone the other day. It was certainly tempting. But then another idea struck, and he said, "I don't want to sleep on the sofa any more."
The village saw a healthy dose of tourists in warm weather. Many stopped by to visit Cartmel Books, but Draco's shop also boasted a fiercely loyal customer base of locals.
"What did I tell you?" Robards asked through clenched teeth.
"I know. But I might have something that could help you get it."
"I know. I am, too."
"Does it hurt?"
Jennings and MacDonald exchanged a glance and burst into laughter.
Potter ran a hand through his hair. "Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"Fine," he said through gritted teeth.
"What? How?"
Robards sat back in his chair and pursed his lips. Then he flashed a manic smile and said, "Get me another cup of coffee. That's how much time you have to decide whether you wish to change your mind."
They fell into easy conversation most days. Potter talked about his newfound interest in gardening, and Draco revealed his jigsaw puzzle habit. Coffee was a daily topic. Even though Draco could no longer have any, he enjoyed living vicariously through Potter and his love for the stuff. Every so often, they broached topics concerning the Wizarding world, although Potter seemed to understand that Draco had clearly shut the door on his old life. Draco dared to take a chance one day and ask what Potter worked on when he came into the shop to write.
As soon as the staff meeting ended, Draco stormed back to his desk. He snatched his quill and a small stack of forms and letters waiting in his in-tray and set to work.
"All leads are being investigated, and evidence from the scene of the explosion is being processed."
"Excuse me?"
Draco had never been down here. He found the wall and placed his hand to it, surprised to discover it curved.
Harry looked back at him and frowned. "Yes you can."
"Thank you," he said. "If you'll excuse me, I'll be—"
"Wonderful. Now, write down your address for me, and I'll get these potions." He tore off a piece of parchment and pushed it across the desk, along with a quill.
Potter was to blame for this, of course. The night before, he'd arrived back at the shop early with their dinner. Usually he waited for Draco in the rear corner nook. This time though, he'd knocked on the door to the store room just as Draco was emerging from his haze of misery. Dazed and panicked, he'd cleared things away in a rush. He couldn't remember locking the door and didn't need Potter barging in. It was sheer luck that he'd managed to throw potions for Sunday into his bag, but that luck didn't extend to the journal, which lay forgotten on the desk.
Draco made his way to the store room to quickly grab his journal from the desk. "Here," he said when Whitby appeared again, thrusting it at him.
Rather than invite conversation, Draco shut his eyes. It was easy enough to pretend he wasn't here, and that Potter didn't exist.
Draco shrugged. "My parents want me to move back to the Manor and start a family."
Saturday was sunny and cold—perfect weather for a Bonfire Night celebration.
He went outside. He just needed a few minutes. It was a cold, clear night, and Harry was reminded that it was almost November.
After walking in silence for a while, the footpath led them out of the forest, and Draco recognised where they were. It was the opposite end of the village, and they approached the high street, where throngs of people milled about.
That was Harry's first thought when he woke up one morning in early October. But Draco had been especially cold the night before, and so they'd made sure to cast strong Warming charms about the room.
"All right, let's go," Potter's voice said. Draco spun to see where he was and laughed when he crashed right into him. "Naomi's going to drive us home."
"Did you like kissing me?"
"I'm close," Potter whispered. "I'm so close."
Draco's birthday dawned bright and sunny, and it fell on a Sunday. It was the first Sunday Harry spent entirely in his company, and it began in Draco's bed.
"Great. Erm. Can I have it? Or, can you open the door?"
Oh no. Potter was moping again. Draco had to do something before this got out of control, but Potter just had tea. He was out of ideas.
