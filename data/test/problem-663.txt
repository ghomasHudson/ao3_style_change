Draco’s hips faltered beneath him when Harry held steady, and Draco’s cock twitched for him again. Harry watched it almost hungrily as he curved over Draco to thrust roughly and press until he could watch Draco’s cock leak another few drops down his shaft.
Apparently not having words, Draco settled for snogging him, bitingly, for several blissful minutes before he finally released his hold on Harry’s shoulders to let him sit up.
“It’s how we’re going keep in touch,” Harry explained. “And it is magic, only hopefully a little subtler. Here, I’ll show you.”
Neither of them got it perfectly, but as day became evening, they both decided they 'd better give it up for now. They'd been out there casting for several hours.
Draco sat up a bit to catch at Harry’s cock with slippery fingers and tug, covering it and using it to pull him closer at the same time.
Mostly, Harry blamed himself. And Malfoy, the sneaky git. Blaming the potion probably would have been easier, and Harry almost wished that he could, but he also knew he’d been thinking a little too much about Malfoy well before the potion was ever in play.
He was having an annoyingly hard time with it all—and would be lying to say that he didn’t miss the sound of Draco moaning or the spicy coconut smell that always lingered in his hair, no matter how sweaty it got.
Cassie hurried out of her office, leaving them to themselves. When Harry chanced a glance at Draco, he noticed a distinct thoughtful frown.
Harry had mentioned then he had been thinking of taking a little time off, and Hermione had asked him to let her know as soon as he knew when.
“Alright, Harry…tell him we all say hello.” Ginny smiled a bit sadly and hugged him tightly before she pulled away. “Just don’t accept any rock cakes.”
Hazily, Harry watched his once-rival nursing the last few sips from a nearly empty glass, and wondered how anyone could manage
Since Ginny had signed on with the Harpies, Harry spent a good amount of time helping her to practice before important matches. She pushed herself quite hard, inevitably pushing Harry to keep up with her. There had been times in the last year or so where he’d thought if any of the leagues had asked him to play, he would’ve been well prepared to step in, if he’d wanted, but he didn’t really. He was content with the lower stakes of helping with Ginny’s practice, or flying with Ron to occasionally blow off some steam, even if it meant he was relegated to the roles of Chaser or Keeper, dependent upon whom he was playing.
“—and of course, I’ll owl you with anything relevant that isn’t inherently incriminating. Then perhaps we might meet to compare notes another time.”
Harry sucked a love-bite dark red beneath his ear, speeding his thrusts as much as he could handle. Their pace interchanged, drawn-out then faster, faltering every time he got too close, but Harry fucked him with all the force he had to give so early on a Sunday morning.
That drew a real glare from Harry, not only for the jab at his second family, but also for the fact that Malfoy was deliberately missing his point.
Amused, Harry nudged up behind him to walk them in the direction of their own reflection. “I thought the hissing was your weakness, you’ve got a thing for mirrors too?”
“Sorry...” Harry trailed off with a distracted hiss at the sensitivity of his cock when he tried to do up his jeans. Maybe he needed to give it a minute.
“You can’t touch me all fucking sexy like that and tell me not to come,” Harry protested breathlessly, but it was suitable distraction to hold him off a while longer.
Malfoy was silent for so long Harry didn't think he was going to answer. He knew he could’ve, understandably, offended the man by bringing up the War, though even if they were both completely sober Harry likely wouldn’t’ve been overly concerned about causing offence. To his surprise, Malfoy seemed to have genuinely considered the question.
There was a nervous intake to Draco’s breathing then—which Harry imagined probably had something to do with the fact he was gently nosing and kissing his way down a scar which was very obviously his own handiwork.
As requested, Harry retrieved his pyjamas from the floor, and summoned a shirt from his bag. Draco didn’t bother with a shirt, but he retrieved Harry’s glasses from the bathroom sink, turning the rounded frames over in his fingers a moment before he handed them back.
He couldn’t possibly be hard yet, but he pushed himself back in at Draco's request. His cock was sore and achingly overstimulated, but not entirely displeased to be there. He groaned quietly, and Draco sighed back rolling his hips gently between the bed and Harry, who was trying to keep flush to his arse or risk slipping out again.
After Ginny left that Tuesday, Harry’s guilt became slowly overtaken by a nervous-excited sort of anticipation that was hard to settle. The next morning, he would be meeting Draco in Muggle London, and together they would go and speak with Cassie. After months of work, the fate of the entire project might hang on the outcome of this one meeting. Given that, Harry thought his nerves were entirely justified.
Harry quickly dropped his to join them on the bathroom floor, and they were both magnificently naked now, and rather hard.
Harry couldn’t even open his eyes, he didn’t want Draco to stop stroking his hair, he didn’t want the peace to go away.
“Buggering hell, you’re really pushing the edge of the law, aren’t you? Handing out enchanted items to Muggles…”
Closing the minimal space between them, Harry leaned in to nose beneath his ear, taking in the faint hint of coconut. The unavoidable naked press of their chests was warm and wonderfully distracting.
“Harry you really need new shirts—you keep losing your buttons somewhere, and I can’t mend them all if I don’t have the buttons.”
“It’s got to be open, Malfoy. Access was a big part of what Cassie said was the problem in the first place.”
Harry cleared his throat, and mustered his sternest expression. “Er. Exceptional as your skills may be—”
“You’re looking a bit pallid, Potter. Are you sure you’re up for this?” Draco’s tone was deceptively disinterested.
Draco quirked his eyebrow coolly. “How else do you think I manage looking this good all the time? I’m more than just a pretty face you know.”
Smoothing his palm down Draco’s back, Harry turned him around and bent him over the foot of the bed, sliding two wandlessly slicked fingers gently into the rather raw clench of his blushing arse, without any stretching spells.
A few of his plants had come out looking less than viable, and he’d taken the time to send out an owl to Neville about his lovage being so brown and leafless.
Harry made every attempt to keep his knees and elbows to himself as he squished into the phonebox with Savage. It was a bit awkward as the lift made its slow progress toward ground-level, but this particular exit always was.
“You’ll need to move off first,” Harry pointed out, pinching at the smooth stretch of Draco’s side, where his hand just happened to be resting.
Harry’s stomach sank slightly. He knew what that meant, there were only a few applications for a good Patronus charm, and he didn’t think sending messages would be part of his Field Training.
Draco looked so thoroughly deliciously well-fucked, his cheeks still flushed high pink and his stomach covered with his own come—as Harry pushed his legs open wider and fucked him harder, racing the dark shot of peaking arousal he got when Draco gasped out his next.
Harry wasn’t actually aware what was happening, only that when he urged Draco to come, he shuddered very hard and came almost instantly, and Harry had come only several harder thrusts after.
Draco did. One to unzip Harry’s jeans, and another to slick his hand before he was working into Harry’s pants to stroke his cock in slow, tight jerks.
“No problem,” Harry assured. He stopped himself short of saying thank you, and went back to his scone.
Finding anyone willing to chat with him for any length of time was much more difficult than he had anticipated. He was, embarrassingly, used to people being especially easy to charm information out of, given who he was—a trick that would obviously not work as well in a world where he was just one more bespeckled git asking unnecessary questions.
As they had the night before, they shared a tumbler of warming whisky together, this time with significantly less snogging, and more sleepily resting shoulder-to-shoulder on the sofa in the sitting room.
but—sorry, I mean to say—” Cassie took a deep breath. “How can I help? What sort of information are you after here?”
“Hush.” He started undoing Harry's jeans by hand, and didn’t even complain about having to tug the metal zipper down. He wasted no time quickly dragging them, pants included, down past Harry's hips and lower, all the way to his ankles. Then he pressed Harry’s knees out, spreading his legs more.
“You were speaking Parseltongue,” Draco cut to the chase dryly. “You mean to tell me that wasn’t on purpose?”
“Well you’ll never get rid of all the Dementors in London, you know—misery, part of the human condition I think.”
There was not a chance in hell that no one had noticed his absence for all of that time. He should’ve been panicking by now—but the overwhelming shots of bliss and oxytocin still pinging through his system were making it rather difficult for him to be bothered.
“We should go, before someone notes your… extended absence. I’d hate to be accused of kidnapping an Auror.”
They had only managed to get lightly tipsy, hardly a roaring celebration, but now there were more pressing priorities than drinking stupidly expensive firewhisky. For the time being, they left it all behind on the kitchen table.
“I try to stay focused on the bit where he’s being very generous with his time…and it helps he’s mostly stopped constantly insulting me.”
When Harry sighed against his lips, Draco let out a softer noise that almost sounded like relief to Harry’s ear. Whatever it was, he liked the sound of it, playing at Draco’s lips with his own in an attempt to encourage more of them.
A posh lunch date and a long evening of preparation leave Harry and Draco on the eve of a very big day.
What with Ginny home for the week and Bill and Fleur visiting with their big announcement, Harry spent the majority of his next week caught up in the chaos of the Burrow, with a lot of back-and-forth between there and work and home.
Curling in away from the night air, his mind began to wander off in whatever direction it wanted to go, and inevitably the direction it headed was sleep.
Harry had a nearly negative desire to be at this wedding reception. There were a number of reasons for this, chief among them being it was too stuffy, too formal, and too few of his friends had been invited. Unfortunately, as a friend of the bride, Ginny had felt somewhat obligated to attend, and she hadn’t really given Harry much choice in the matter of whether or not he would be joining her.
For his cheek, Harry purposefully drew the point of his teeth as he pulled up. Draco hissed tightly, but he was already sliding back in, his cock twitching tellingly stiff.
“You’ve cast it perfectly. If you think you’ve got a handle on the décor, then you’re ready. The other enchantments we can work out later in the week. We’ll start with the Extensions.”
“I’m dreadfully bored, my friends are all too busy partying away their fortunes to bother writing.” Draco’s arms crossed his chest. “Indulge me.”
Harry wanted to kiss him all over again, and his stomach flipped with nervous anticipation—but he resisted the urge. He really did need to go.
Draco only quickened his hand, almost challenging Harry to keep it together, and Harry shuddered dangerously.
Each of the trials had been one more step toward putting the whole business finally behind them, but for a time, the mood of the entire community could only have been called grim. It was no wonder that so many young witches and wizards of Harry’s generation seemed to be trying to move on.
He only realised after the fact he’d said ‘yet’ like it was something he planned on doing. Not that he was in any particular hurry to take it back either.
He searched out Draco’s lips again to kiss him more slowly, anything to pull focus off the tight grip stealing his senses.
“I’m proposing we have breakfast first…and maybe we could also fit in a really quick fuck,” he negotiated.
“Yes, ‘about that’.” Ron was apparently not in the mood for hedging. “Why in Merlin’s great bloody balls would you be working with that arsehole?”
When several long seconds of staring expectantly yielded no response, Blaise snapped his fingers. “The soap?”
Harry and Draco's Saturday spells practice runs late, conversations are had, new discoveries are made, and Harry is very bad at pattern mixing.
Shifting up behind him to thrust back inside, he watched an unadulterated pleasure beautifully contort Draco’s conceit as he slid in properly deep.
He wasn’t sure he could ever fully forgive him for all that he had done, but Harry thought now that he might understand him better.
Muttering a fairly unintelligible 'evening' Harry was momentarily very absorbed in not thinking about any of the words Malfoy just said. Somewhat desperately, he reached for the books instead, pulling one down from the top of the pile to examine the cover and the binding until whatever uncomfortableness he was experiencing had passed. He absorbed absolutely none of what he was looking at.
In a creaky little house on the edge of Ottery St. Catchpole, Harry tossed restlessly beneath the heavy quilt which blanketed him and the bed he shared with Ginny.
Harry heard something in Draco’s voice break. He tried to pull off again, but Harry thrust up with all the force he could manage without any leverage.
Harry has the week off. Harry and Draco have a meeting with Cassie, Harry pays a visit to Malfoy Manor, and Harry's attic gets painted, all in one busy Wednesday.
Of course, not everything they were doing together was the right thing to do. The irony was not lost on him that their unlawful pursuits also happened to be the more morally honorable ones, but either way Harry was standing behind his decision to move forward. He knew it wasn’t yet too late for him to reconsider if he’d had any second thoughts—but he had none.
Harry saw the dark dilation of arousal in his eyes just before he did. He lifted his hips up, but Harry caught at them and pushed him back down flat into the mattress before he was shifting over him to work the head of his cock between pale cheeks. It took him a breathless beat to find the right way to press in, and then Draco was moaning again.
Sounding rather dryly amused, Draco jumped immediately on the break in conversation for an opportunity to leave, rising to offer his hand just as he had the last time.
Watching the break of desire on Draco’s face, Harry thought this could easily become his new favourite thing to do together, and all thanks to the Malfoys' ostentatious ballroom.
They spent more than an hour that afternoon attempting to recap what they’d been working on, with as much detail as they could manage without giving away that it wasn’t actually a bold new Ministry project to improve conditions in both worlds as they were claiming. However, as they got into the finer points of what they’d been doing all this time, Cassie appeared completely enthralled by the potential of it, encouragingly so, as she was their expert on the matter.
Harry had never realised before how much he was capable of going on. He was almost as bad as Hermione.
Harry took the stairs two at a time, probably not the wisest choice given the spiral went up quite high—but he was pretty excited, and a bit breathless when he reached the top of them.
Harry watched him agilely slip over the arm of the chair, falling into the dark indigo of its cushioned seat. Without breaking the lock of green and silver, Draco rested his heels flat to the chair’s cushion, and shifted his arse much closer to the edge.
Leaning forward on the black iron railing, Draco scowled down into the atrium with a short, clearly bothered huff.
“We should go to bed,” Draco murmured sometime later, between the light nips and soft sucking Harry was currently bestowing on terribly kiss-swelled lips.
Their trousers and pants together made a pile at the end of Draco’s bed, and they rolled tangled in silky comfortable ecstasy, apparently in some sort of battle over which of them could make the other moan loudest. Harry was pretty sure he was winning either way.
Disoriented, he only noticed Draco’s legs sliding off his arms when they coiled over his arse instead. Draco caught him at the nape of the neck and pulled him down to kiss almost gently.
As they prepared to leave Draco instructed him to straighten out his shirt, and spent a minute or so fussing at his own hair in the mirror-wall, pointedly ignoring when Harry outright laughed at him.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed genuine annoyance. “Is this some sort of punishment you’re inflicting on me? Have I not paid enough for my crimes?”
“What are you doing here? I really don’t have a lot of time, I’m fully backed up on my reports after last week, and I can’t—"
Harry woke on the first morning of September to the weight of someone sat on his legs, smacking his arse. It was really the smack which woke him, and with quite a start.
Then, given Harry was presently taking up the majority of the bed-space, Draco collapsed half-atop him with a low groan.
“The government and the councils are leaning into supporting a lot of local and private organisations to do the actual work—but there’ve been a lot of miscommunications between them and some of the already established churches and charities—it’s not exactly efficient. A lot of them, as well as the hostels and such meant to provide accommodation, they weren’t always collecting or reporting their numbers accurately. St. Mungo’s have been trying to tackle the mental health aspect with a bit of success, but of course all those places are only ever temporary, and with quite a lot of conditions on who can stay, and for how long.”
Had he any sense left, Harry might’ve marvelled at the sheer amount of it all that stained their trousers and covered what little skin he had managed to expose—a few arches of hips, stomachs, and overstimulated erections. It was a bit stifling in the heat between them not to be completely naked, the scent of sex and sweat was heavy in the air, but neither of them had the patience to untangle long enough to bother.
As impatient as they both were to get him inside, once he had him there Draco rode him superbly slowly.
“Morning, Scarhead. Wake up. I’ve already done the windows and I’m going to make a proper breakfast.”
This chapter got too unwieldy so I had to split it in two, which gives me more time to work on the second half. Again as a heads up, there's an excessive amount of sex in this chapter, but not only that.
When the forest had nothing interesting to say in return, Harry carefully slipped on his glasses and went to collect his robes.
Exchanging mint and honey in the sliding swirls of their tongues, it was the taste that sparked Harry’s brilliant idea—and once it popped into his head, he thought he might’ve dreamed it once. Either way, Harry pushed him backward flat onto the bed with a mischievously eager smile.
“Don’t come,” Harry murmured in challenge, palming pale cheeks before he went on repeatedly tracing the sensitive circle with the tip of his tongue.
Even in a room so unnaturally cold, Harry’s robes suddenly felt much too heavy, and he hurried to shrug out of them. He had to focus just to breathe evenly as Malfoy stepped close enough to hook narrow fingers into the waistband of Harry’s trousers, playing at the buttons there.
A darkly unpleasant feeling wrenched sinkingly through him—he couldn’t see Draco anymore; only Malfoy—but he had questions that needed answering, and he was determined to ask them now.
“Keep practising the Extension revisions, look over the books I set aside for you. I’ll be in touch when I’m ready to walk you through the warding enchantments.”
Ginny responded with the sort of amused smile which gave away she didn’t entirely mind, though there were times he knew his blunders disappointed her.
“I think you like that I can’t stop looking at you. You pretend you don’t notice sometimes, but you always do.”
Draco laughed at him, low and unusually buoyant as he spun around to take the stairs properly and Harry helpfully palmed Draco’s arse again, pushing him in the right direction.
They kissed again, and Harry groaned low as Draco’s tongue teased and flicked repeatedly into his mouth to play against his own.
Renna Waddell was a Ravenclaw from Ginny’s year. Dark-haired and petite, they had become fast friends when the fates of alphabetical order assigned them to be partners in both Potions and Divinations class. She and Ginny had remained close, meeting for lunch or drinks, and exchanging the occasional owl.
Frowning at his uncertainties, Harry took a moment to dither and decided the least he could do was return the favor for the hot chocolate last Sunday.
He first owled Hermione, who (after checking with Ron) promised they could meet for dinner on Friday of that week.
He caught Draco tight around the middle instead, turning them both so he could sink down into the seat properly, and pull Draco into his lap as best he could in the small space between the chair’s overstuffed arms. He really didn’t care that the back was all sticky.
They walked in careful silence a little longer, but as they passed through a narrow torchlit corridor Harry’s curiosity, and his stomach, overruled his nervousness.
Just as he disappeared in a swirl of flames, Harry noticed his own bitemarks still all over Draco’s neck. He hadn’t bothered to heal them.
He pressed closer, trapping Draco between himself and the edge of the desk, and Draco thrust against him with another quiet moan. Harry indulged himself biting rosy marks into the curve of Draco’s shoulder, working the very last bit of fabric off of him.
Instead, he reached for the front of Draco’s shirt and pulled him up and closer—which was all the prompting Draco apparently needed to walk right into him and crush their lips together. They slid their tongues together too, and Harry hummed a low sort of satisfied noise as Draco broke the kiss only to bite tauntingly at Harry’s lower lip then, trying to pull him into another—
He pushed in deeper yet and they moaned together in mutual desire. A hard shudder foreshadowing the abrupt spurt of bitter heat into Harry’s throat, lust-darkened green shifted to watch the part of Draco’s lips around a breathless cry.
Surely enough, in two days’ time when Harry finally washed the honey-scented substance from his cheek—which had crystallised in the last day or so over the once-angry line where the curse cut deep—he found there was no trace of a scar left at all. And once again, Harry was genuinely grateful for Draco’s help.
Draco had prepared tea, biscuits and sandwiches included, on one of the library’s narrow tables. Harry was already making himself a cup, and selecting a sandwich.
Some of his classes Harry liked better than others. His Trace Magic class was particularly insightful, and he’d discovered he was pretty competent at the sensing required for the method to work. He’d enjoyed his recent class on memory charms as well. Mind-twisting stuff that, but it was fascinating.
—but Harry also didn’t think he could go much further sorting out solutions to the Muggle housing problem without Draco’s help. The complexity of the spell-craft was well over his head now, and he couldn’t think of anyone else with the resources and the free time available to dedicate to the project.
Draco made it halfway over the bridge crossing the atrium before he spotted Harry standing down there, a demanding question burning in the green of his eyes. A flash of shock crossed his pointed features as their gazes locked, a flicker of emotion shuttering quickly away behind absolutely nothing at all.
At some point that morning, while Harry still slept, Draco had gathered several large piles of sheets from elsewhere in the manor—though these were not the impractically extravagant sort he used on his bed, but a much more traditional linen, piled high in neat stacks on the ballroom floor.
Harry couldn’t help thinking they never would have worked so well together in school, but the more he thought it over, the more he had to acknowledge they were never really given the chance to try. They might’ve worked well together. Perhaps they could’ve even discovered how bloody fucking attractive they found each other sooner.
Malfoy looked as if he doubted that, but Harry proceeded to bring him up to speed on what he’d learned thus far, and about Cassie, her sister, and her agreement to be a point of contact in future. He thought he might’ve been going too fast but Malfoy seemed to be following—pacing through the grass as he did.
Harry was a touch concerned himself, and it was embarrassing as well. He’d had to apologise, and explain that he hadn’t been sleeping well.
“Who’s taking spunk?” Harry questioned with entirely false innocence, reflexively reaching back to slide his palm over Draco’s hip, but he was swatted away.
“Chapter twenty-seven of the book on spell modifications is what you should familiarise yourself with. You haven’t got to build the spell, I’m responsible for that part, but you’ll need to know what you’re doing when you cast them. You’ll need to understand the theory behind the added layers.”
Deciding he had better get on with joining the D.A. for lunch, Harry steeled himself to go back into the fray. He wrote a short note to Hagrid before he left, passing along everyone’s greetings—and promising to visit on a less sad day, soon—then quietly crept his way out of the hut.
The look Draco shot him then, the faint arching of an eyebrow as he merely leant back on the desk, spoke volumes. The fact he was still completely naked only added to the air of confidence.
Recently the Dementors presence in the city was less overwhelming than it had been when Harry’s training began last October, but enough of them remained to be troubling. Encouragingly, Harry’s Patronus had come out luminously bright that morning—only he wasn’t exactly admitting to himself what he’d thought of when he cast.
It was rather instinctively that Harry popped his finger up to his mouth after to suck it clean. He didn’t think much of it at all, until Draco leant back to eye him at the sound.
Harry rested his hands on Draco’s hips, wanting to feel how they moved, but let him control everything. It was an agonising sort of perfection when Draco drew out every inch only to take him in again. Lost deep in the patiently unrelenting drag of tight heat, Harry moaned. The soothe of Draco’s fingertips traced up his cheek and into his hair, and he moaned even lower when Draco did that circling thing with his hips as he rubbed their tongues together.
Nosing experimentally at soft blond curls, somewhat sticky with honey and come, Harry waited to drop his next question until Draco lifted his head, arching a pale eyebrow at him quizzically.
Draco went on smoothly sucking through the aftershocks, until Harry shook a little under the overstimulating caress of his tongue and he finally pulled off with a rather wet pop.
A pair of iron staircases, spiral of course, mirrored each other on either side of the room, leading up to their respective second levels. On those second levels were also two doors, one on each side, and both closed.
As noon drew nearer, Harry circled around into a side alley, and tried to stand out of sight while the Portkey worked its magic.
Suddenly picturing the exact positioning of Draco’s cock so vividly, Harry felt quite warm—but he had news to deliver, there were priorities.
“He’s lucky he’s not in Azkaban,” she answered in a more hushed tone, given they remained surrounded by people, several of them former Slytherins.
At the time, Harry’d thought Draco a selfish prick, which he was to some extent, even now—but he’d done what he’d had to do in order to survive, a sentiment Harry understood all too well.
Harry groaned, stumbling back a few steps until his back hit the side of the little glass shed he was using as a greenhouse—but he gripped at Draco’s arse, pulling him along, keeping him pressed right where he was. It
“Happy birthday,” Harry said quietly at his ear, feeling him shiver then, just before Draco shifted to rub his arse back on Harry’s cock through their trousers. It was incredibly distracting. “You’ll need to move that, if you want me inside it anytime soon.”
Harry wandlessly summoned the other cup and tried to ignore the warmth collecting in his own cheeks.
Experimentally, Harry wiggled his wand, tickling its vibrating tip over the small center of nerves, admiring the tensing tremble of pale thighs, and the hold of Draco’s arse on the slim wood of his wand as it penetrated him.
They relaxed their holds on one another in the uncertainty of the moment. Harry let go of Draco’s arse and plopped down on the tartan settee with a tense sigh. After a quiet beat, Draco sat down beside him with a small frown, though Harry’s frown had gone far more troubled.
With a smirk once again a little too reminiscent of the hateful prick Harry recalled, Malfoy pulled the stopper on the lid.
It took them nearly twenty minutes to get from Harry’s house to the paddock, which was hidden enough from town that they could fly unnoticed. Ron spent most of that time catching him up on the latest high jinks at the shop.
Shoving him down into the cushions, Draco kissed him back so furiously deep Harry was left gasping under him, then he shifted his hips, rocking into just the right place, and they both groaned.
Draco looked as if he couldn’t tell if that was a meant to be a compliment—and Harry didn’t really know either.
She wished them good morning, and they returned the greetings, and then Harry had started to introduce Draco—but Cassie was already beaming at him.
“I’m really sorry, Gin. I needed some time to myself so I—well I went off for a long walk and sort of…lost track of time. Then er—sort of fell asleep?”
“Sounds alright,” Harry agreed easily, the quirk of his lips a little knowing, before he was heading for the hearth. “I’ll see you then.”
Between the two of them they had nearly emptied a full tray of peachy-cinnamon glasses, which might’ve been a clue to avoid serious discussions, yet Harry felt the protests stubbornly rising in him. He also quite enjoyed the mildly horrified look he received when he made a point to prod the very tip of Malfoy’s nose in the middle of a party full of Ministry workers.
“And if you need to send any messages to me, it works just the same. If there’s a day you’re available to meet, you can write it on the light—and I can confirm with a checkmark or star or something.”
Why was Malfoy going off into the forest, today of all days? He looked relatively normal but maybe something was wrong with him. Harry doubted very much now that Malfoy was actually up to anything nefarious but it also wasn’t completely outside the realm of possibility—
A hazy nervousness ran through him—but it appeared Draco was too tired for nerves. He whispered a spell that unbuttoned Harry’s shirt and pushed it from his shoulders, tracing his fingertips slowly down over the slight muscle of his abs with obvious interest.
A bit shocked he was open to discussing the matter at all, Harry furrowed his brow as he considered his own experience. “I’ve visited with her and Teddy, but it was a bit awkward. She’s…honestly, it’s fucking creepy how much she looks like Bellatrix sometimes.”
Somehow, he managed not to, but Harry moaned low and his hips snapped his cock up into Draco’s prostate, and Draco let out a sharp cry that Harry found incredibly satisfying.
If Ginny minded how long it was taking to make the place tolerable to live in, she hadn’t ever said so, at least not to him, but Harry still felt a bit bad about it. He did his best to make time to keep up with the repairs, when he wasn’t occupied working his way through Auror training, classes, and workshops.
“I’m just going mad is all,” Harry muttered to himself, stepping out into a patch of the wood where the grass had grown over the forest floor, lush and green thanks to a break in the treetops above.
There were two pairs of push lights, four all together, and two packs of markers, with six to each pack. Harry had bought extra in case the spell went horribly wrong, as it was very complex, but he was really hoping he could get it working properly soon.
exceptionally sticky. He had to lick over its syrupy thickness very intently with his tongue before its viscosity truly dissolved—and the process was quite wetly noisy. Arching under Harry’s attentive mouth, Draco gasped, rubbing the long swell of his cock against Harry's stomach and smearing him with tacky sweetness too.
“Are we having naked breakfast?” he asked, hopefully reaching for the waistband of Draco’s silky pyjamas.
Only a week later, Harry had drinks with Neville and Hannah both, and not just with them either—but rather a lot of people.
It was only after they had returned home that night, past midnight, and well after Ginny had gone tiredly off to bed, that Harry began to get a bit… restless.
Unfortunately, that strategy really only worked so long as he was awake. Malfoy managed to haunt him in his dreams as well, and Harry found himself more than once waking in the middle of the night in a new kind of sweat—not from fear as he was so accustomed, but rather painfully hard and a little desperate. Those sorts of dreams were beginning to very seriously disrupt his sleep, thrown in as they were with his ever-present nightmares. They were particularly awkward on nights when Ginny was home, asleep in oblivious peace beside him.
Harry's week is productive, but his weekend takes a rocky turn, and Draco challenges him in more ways than one.
As always, Harry felt an irrational pang of guilt that he had not been able to save him, and how many lives he might have saved and changed if he’d just been able to kill the bastard a little sooner or more efficiently. Mostly he knew in his heart no one blamed him for all the deaths—still sometimes Harry couldn’t help blaming himself.
Harry’s cock throbbed with painful demand, swelled dark and beading to come as he pulled out slowly, with an unsteady groan. “How do you want this?”
They were on their way back up to the ballroom to finish what remained of the drapes when Draco stopped him in the curvy stone stairway leading up to its corridor.
“I hope it’s helpful, it has been an awful lot of work.” And for all the work it was for him, Draco had put in even more.
It took him longer than it should’ve to formulate a response that was just as aloof and impersonal as the one Malfoy had sent—or as close as Harry could manage.
The last time they had talked was Draco’s birthday, nearly a month ago. Harry didn’t even have a good reason to owl him now that they were both working independently on familiarising themselves with some of the enchantments.
Draco seemed to enjoy never telling him where they were going. He led the way out into the corridor and up a curving side staircase that Harry had previously only ever walked past.
Having left his other bag in the library, the one with all his clothes in, Harry summoned it, and Draco summoned his own toothbrush and pyjamas to the ballroom as well.
Harry’d thought to ask again about the shared magic what’s-it Draco was so reluctant to talk about, but he held back.
He was taking his sweet time with it too. The fact he found it necessary to lock eyes with Harry while he did it only sent the heat currently flushing through him climbing steadily higher.
Satisfied, he went on chasing honey trails, mouthing into the firm muscled warmth of his thigh, biting at a soft place he was growing particularly fond of before he was moving on to more sensitive bits. Draco’s bollocks obviously needed his attention badly, and Draco moaned heavily under an exceedingly determined tongue and the enthusiastic suction of Harry’s flushed lips.
"Honestly, don’t you ever think about the fact that even the poorest wizard has access to just about everything they need to live?” Harry paused to sip through the bubbles in his glass before he continued. “Doesn’t it seem wrong to you that we have the magic and the power to help Muggles the same and we just… don’t.”
Only now, almost two years on, were the trials even finally beginning to wind down. Harry’d had to testify at far more of those than he would’ve liked, but sensing how vital they seemed to everyone’s ability to move on, it had felt like a responsibility he couldn’t shirk, even if they hadn’t legally required him to participate.
Draco barely looked at any of it, leading Harry toward and up the spiral staircase on their left like he did it every day, probably because he did. When they reached the door, Draco tapped its crystalline knob with his wand and it swung open to grant them access.
Harry barely managed to get them through the front door, leaving his umbrella lying open on the front step as he slammed it shut behind them.
He felt somewhat better after he returned home that night as well. Ginny wouldn’t be home until Sunday, and Harry had a couple of days uninterrupted to work on the house and practice some of the spells Draco had assigned him. If he was lucky, he could hold off some of his more betraying thoughts for a little while.
“The less-than-good news is that we’ll probably need several days for the duration of casting time it’s going to take to get everything charmed and extended properly, protected and hidden, with the right illusion enchantments, the Taboo, and all the rest of it.”
After nearly five hours, whatever energy the banana and scone had provided for him was fully gone, and Harry’s stomach was growling—audibly enough Draco could hear it from several feet away, snickering as he finished out his most recent charm.
“Now you mention it, I could’ve sworn I felt their awful bloody cold the other night outside the flat.”
risky—the back garden was far from private, and they did have neighbours, which peripherally also included his future in-laws—but all he cared about then was Draco’s tongue swirling with his, and Draco’s cock rubbing persistently against his thigh.
All over again the heat inside Draco was nearly unbearable. It would have been so very easy for Harry to come, but he found the will to do what they had gone to all the trouble for—he pulled Draco back against his chest to see as he gripped tightly around his cock, tugging with aroused fascination when he could watch the milky drops of precum swelling at his tip.
They cleaned up after themselves, and Draco gave the whole place a proper inspection before they headed back out to start the next round of extensions.
“Pompous fucking prick,” Harry murmured, working his pants further down past his arse, and immediately surrounding a sensitively exposed tip in the swirl of his tongue.
Reluctantly he let up on the pressure between them, fighting not to give in when Draco arched to get him back. He was on a mission now, and too far gone for spells, he started tugging at frustratingly complicated fabric. He managed to pop several of their trouser buttons in his rush to press the pleasure-sore swell of his cock to Draco’s—and get lost the hot slick slide between them as the potion’s lewd power tore its way through their systems. It was ramping up every sensation—driving them to rubbing and rutting together until they could both come again.
As he tugged them up, a shift on the bed drew his attention, but Draco was only rolling over onto his front, and seemingly still asleep. Harry spent longer than necessary watching the slow rise and fall of his back—deciding then he looked as extraordinary stretched out in Harry’s bed as he did in his own extravagant one.
Someone had undone the spells behind the magically generated parlour music, in favor of taking up the violin and launching into a series of more danceable tunes. Before long another guest had joined in with a small concertina and together treated the room to a few reels, and a jig or two.
She fixed him with a searching gaze regardless, seeming to make her own assessment on whether or not he was really okay to be drinking with Draco Malfoy. Harry tried to offer a reassuring smile, but Ginny seemed to remain mostly trepidatious.
“Let’s swap places,” Draco said, giving the head of Harry’s cock one last flick with his tongue before he was rising and working off his own trousers.
That justification was part of what kept him moving forward with his planning—another part being the hollow looks of fear and trauma on the faces of every Muggle caught up in the Dementor’s feeding frenzies. Harry thought that alone was reason enough to do
Draco shoved him by the shoulder into the corridor wall and Harry only laughed at him in a smug sort of way—and caught him around the middle from behind.
The part of the day taken up by ceremonies was mostly held on Hogwarts’ grounds, along the lake, which was the only place with room to put enough chairs for as many people as would likely attend. The wake would come later that evening, entirely unofficial, and taking place mostly in the various pubs of Hogsmeade, and the houses of anyone living in the village inclined to throw a party that night—of which there were several.
“Wha’thefuck,” he ran together, still sleepily lacking the coordination to peer back over his shoulder.
Harry made Draco come all over the shower curtain, twice, stroking and squeezing the stiff length of him through each, before he gave over to his own orgasm—
It was past one by then, and Harry had mumbled something unintelligible and made right for the shower.
“Your decorating skills need work,” he drawled, eyeing up the abundance of tartan and paisley patterns, and the mix of them together, that Harry had created. “Otherwise…I suppose it’s quite cosy.”
He also wasn’t sure at what point he had become Draco, and not Malfoy. He was only really sure that when the constant throb of pleasure through his nerves finally began to release its hold he was very sore, stickier than he thought he had ever been and surprisingly rather unwilling to pull his cock out of the man beneath him. So he didn’t, and quite enjoyed the way Draco moaned any time either of them shifted even a tiny bit.
The guilt usually would not hit him until he was home with Ginny, standing in the kitchen, or the sitting room, or flipping through books in the attic, when the thoughts, the memories, and all the urges would return to him.
Harry’s revelation might have made things awkward between Draco and him, but they no longer had time alone together.  The summer season meant that there was a constant presence of researchers and tourists who needed to be escorted around the reserve, and Charlie’s team was in charge of visitor safety.  Since flying tended to provoke the unwanted interest of the dragons, all exploration had to be done by foot and the team spent days at a time trekking into the heart of the reserve, sleeping in communal tents or underneath the stars.  At least Harry was finally being included with the team, having been deemed no greater risk than the tourists who often ignored Charlie’s warnings about loud noises and sudden movements.
And for some reason, Harry’s mind chose that moment to remember that August was half over—that this feeling and these moments were going to end.
Harry huffed speechlessly into the lightly sweaty blond hair he was nosing into. Draco’s breathing was heavy and humid between rather claiming bites to Harry’s neck, and he sighed deeply, but also did not entirely cease the soft rolling of his hips.
His lips were now well past the point of reasonable pain. He probably should’ve taken the time to heal them, but instead Harry only licked at them and shifted up to kiss Draco, slow and sparked with rising heat—though he paused to pose a low question. “Can I fuck you?”
Cassie was surprised to see him when Harry popped his head through her office doorway, but as usual, she seemed grateful for the interruption.
“Alright?” he checked, handing the bottle back to be stoppered, only for Malfoy to take another sip instead.
“That’s completely irrelevant,” Draco sidestepped with a hinted smirk. “Either way I’m right, so you might as well just do as I say.”
Harry’s assessing green eyes shifted from Malfoy to the offered bottle—but rightly he was not quite reckless enough to drink a completely unknown potion, sight unseen.
That was enough to pull Harry’s focus off adding to the already impressive display of lovebites he’d left since yesterday. “How many days?”
Still sat square in his lap, Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously, but he didn’t press, charming the bottle to pour another careful splash into their glass instead.
“I thought Muggle Artifacts were underfunded, didn’t your father work for years to stop them raiding your house?”
If he were flexible enough, Harry imagined he would already have his mouth on it, but he wasn’t quite. He pressed his palms to Draco’s thighs, spreading them as he eased in deeper. He was not remotely over the feeling of being all in, caught up in the staggering intensity every time.
Ginny grinned back at him. “Isn’t it? I think she’s going to do big things for us this year, and we bloody need some wins.”
Draco gripped tight to a wooden step above his head when Harry curled his fingers as he sucked Draco back into his mouth, and Draco’s cock twitched hard on Harry’s tongue.
Ginny returned home when she could but, as Quidditch season was beginning in earnest, he would only see less and less of her for the foreseeable future. Even when she was home Harry’s new workload meant that not only had the house become more neglected than ever, but he found he hadn’t even the energy to communicate most nights.
Draco huffed in utter exasperation. “Will you be sucking my cock any time in the next century, then?”
Ultimately Draco had been trying to protect his family, right up to that moment. The only other time he’d taken a risk like that had been to save all their lives.
Malfoy’s magical signature was all over it, dancing about with the travelling spell—but there was nothing else there to set off any alarm bells. It was oddly calming actually, and Harry found his lips quirking somewhat inexplicably.
Sliding his fingers through silky platinum as his cock sunk deeper in slippery heat, he needed Draco not to stop. Maybe he could get away with thrusting into the ecstasy for a few more minutes, into the self-satisfied lilt of all Draco’s inciting moans. They were surely being too loud, but Harry hadn’t noticed anyone else around, and he was getting so close, so quickly—
All of Draco’s shushing went out the window then, whining a loud, desperate sound into Harry’s mouth, his words coming in far more breathless gasps.
Draco even made to pull away, but Harry pulled him back again, and that quickly they were kissing each other—for a little too long.
Draco moaned against his lips as Harry’s tongue slid into his mouth, pushing him down on the bed to crawl over him. Draco was already shoving his trousers down again, and Harry squirmed to help.
Ginny had been seated just behind them, but when the ceremonies broke for lunch, Harry met her at the edge of the lake.
Draco nipped lightly at his balls, keeping him pinned to the chair with an intense silver gaze all the while. “Because I said so.”
It would not have been possible for Harry to properly express how surreal it was to have Draco Malfoy sitting in his dusty little kitchen. Rather than try, he focused instead on charming the teapot to fill with boiling water as he collected some cups from the cupboards by hand.
Neither of them would’ve had time to cast before the Dementors would be on them, so they took off down the alley. When they had put in enough distance and moved far enough away from the main roads, they each fired off a bright Patronus charm—bright enough to send the Dementors screeching off into the sky, likely to recover their dignity elsewhere.
Nearly two hours later found them both in Harry’s attic, though the evening was not going as he had originally planned.
Two hours and four extensions later, it was taking them even longer. They needed to go in after every extension to check everything had come out alright before they could move on to the next. Draco was doing most of the final inspections, and also had to temporarily magically link each tent to the manor’s water supply to test that everything was functioning as it should in the kitchens and bathrooms.
Harry pulled the door shut and plopped into a wobbly chair. Extracting two of the push lights, and a pack of markers from his pocket, he laid them out on her desk to unshrink them.
He was so lost in his thoughts about wands and irony, he very nearly missed the casting. However on first cast the spell did not appear to have done much of anything to the inside of the music box.
“Mother and I’ve had tea with my aunt here once or twice, and I’ve since come on my own as well. They do a brunch with absolutely spectacular crepes.”
“Sorry,” Harry offered, sounding not sorry at all—but he got on with pulling each miniturised tent from the bag and laying them out across the floor by hand.
Harry spends the start of his summer focused on work, until Draco owls him to come over and practise some wand work instead.
“I wasn’t. I was going to say I should be free the weekend after next—but I can owl you with a time later.”
Then Draco murmured a low spell, a Disillusionment Charm, veiling them both under the same cool trickle of magic.
Once more, for several minutes they could only focus on regaining the ability to breathe evenly. When Draco finally sat up to charm them properly clean—for good this time—the stars were glittering silently through the forest’s thick branches, and it only reoccurred to Harry then what day it was, that they were still in the Forbidden Forest, and also that most of the day’s events were likely hours past over.
Draco woke suddenly, with a too-loud gasp, and when the fearful grey of his eyes met Harry’s, Harry saw a kind of panic in them he hadn’t seen there in a few years.
Draco stood and walked to the sink where he filled a glass with cool water. He grabbed the Cough-No-More Potion on his way to the sofa.
virgin who swears off a particular act of sex to claim the title, but a true fumbling about, never even touched it, no experience at all virgin.
Potter sucked on his collarbone and Pansy left his thoughts completely. Draco pulled back and captured Potter's mouth with his own. Maybe they'd shag that night or maybe they would just enjoy amazing kisses. Draco didn't care. He just loved the feel of Potter's body pressed against him and the heat of their mouths together.
Their rutting grew frenzied, and Draco bit at Potter's neck as he came in his pants. Potter gripped Draco's hips as he thrust up against him until he was groaning and trembling in the grass.
Harry wasn’t sure if buying cannolis for afters was his best or worst idea ever. Watching Draco lick at the creamy filling oozing out of the phallic pastry was better than any porn Harry could imagine. He only wished he could touch himself as he watched, but he suspected Draco would not approve of him sticking his hand in his trousers at the table. Something for them to work towards, Harry decided as he imagined having his way with Draco over that very table. Draco’s smooth pale skin would look amazing against the dark and weathered wood.
Groaning, Harry kicked fully out of his trousers and disentangled their lips, immediately throbbing with need at the soft sound of Draco's moaned protest.
“Long-term, secure, unrestricted,” the former Slytherin repeated, almost more to himself.  “Well we knew about the secure bit, but this should give us, or me really, somewhere to start with the enchantments…Not sure how we’ll manage balancing security spells versus not restricting access, but I’ll give it some thought.”
“…’S’pose I wanted to give you an out, Malfoy. We’re reaching a point here where there could be real legal ramifications for being involved in this. So.”
All day he tried to shut out a persistent twinge of concern that he had done something wrong. Obviously, the
He was assuming Draco hadn’t meant his aunt Bellatrix, she didn’t strike him as the sort to’ve gone out for brunch, especially not muggle brunch. He’d also spent enough time studying the tapestry at Grimmauld to know Draco’s mum didn’t have any other siblings.
Draco sucked at his tongue, until Harry thrust up searchingly and sent the blond man shuddering forward, panting into Harry’s shoulder. Every roll of Draco’s hips was punctuated by Harry’s groans.
“For the famous Harry Potter, on his very special birthday?” Draco drawled, sarcasm much tempered by the sleepy roughness of his voice. He nipped at Harry’s lightly-stubbled chin. “You can fuck me twice.”
Closing the door to the round room behind them, both men now knew to close their eyes as the room spun all around. When it had stopped, Harry nodded toward the door opposite them.
When he’d finished stretching and yawning, Harry stumbled out of bed—which Draco immediately went about charming to make itself, effectively ensuring they would not be crawling back under the covers any time soon.
“Whatever,” Draco snapped with faint irritation, offhandedly charming his trousers clear of debris. “I told you I wanted to. Leave it.”
Malfoy turned a wry look on the canvas-walled chamber—which might have fit within it several regulation-sized Quidditch fields, comfortably.
It was a warm and windy evening, the dusky late-summer sky being mostly clear, save a few clusters of thin clouds that the wind pushed quickly by.
Huffing a laugh, Harry felt caught in the relentless tug of sleep, and for several long beats there was only the perfectly soothing sounds of their tired breathing.
“Mind if I give it a go next?” Harry was still very tired, but seeing Draco’s success was invigorating.
. They certainly shouldn’t’ve been forced to stay here under some awful ancient magical contract they had no say in creating.”
Harry wasn’t sure if one or both of them had done it, they might’ve broken the door, but he didn’t care to stop long enough to sort it out. Draco’s feet hit the floor and Harry backed him to the edge of the bed.
was he doing this to himself, and more importantly, why was he doing it to Ginny. Why was he being such a terrible fiancé?
Harry answered by shifting down, biting tenaciously hard beneath his navel, and marking with his teeth until Draco’s arrogance was lost in lower moans.
Should he really be considering meeting him again? In light of his dreams, and his guilt over what had happened, Harry wasn’t sure. For several weeks now a small bit of his mind had been trying to warn him that perhaps he should take over the project on his own—and not let Malfoy get any more involved than he already was—but he wasn’t fully sure about that either.
Draco dropped his trousers, and left them just outside the bathroom door. He shrugged off his shirt next, before he looked back to check.
They fell into silence for a time, as most of his focus went into completely relearning how to eat soup. Eventually and inevitably though, his mind wandered.
” Draco was arching again, pushing his cock deeper, cursing and gasping as he came into the sucking pull of Harry’s mouth—sudden enough that Harry just let it happen before he remembered to swallow, and by then he had a bit of a mouthful.
Harry thought it was a little ridiculous they had to stagger their showers in order to manage getting properly washed up—but then again, he knew the reason he wanted Draco in the shower with him had absolutely nothing to do with anything clean.
Hello, so this is massively later than I'd hoped. Work got unpredictable and this chapter was a bit more involved so it took longer to get right, then I ended up splitting it in half like the last one, but here's the first bit! The next few chapters might also be late, depending on how things shake out, because there's a lot going into them, but I'm really hoping not.
He went on like that, until the crystal knob turned on the door and Draco wandered out of his room, padding across the stone floor in bare feet to look down at Harry over the iron railing, very unimpressed.
Hello! Thank you for continuing to read if you are, I appreciate you! The feedback is awesome and its nice to know I'm entertaining someone besides me. I've been taking longer between chapters but I've also been trying to go through and fix some errors I missed the first time round. If you've been saving it off as an entire work definitely give your file an update.
His duplicity reared prominently to the forefront of his mind every time anyone had asked him when Ginny would be home, or how she had been getting along with her training—not that he didn’t have those answers, he had been owling with her all the while. Nevertheless, he felt like a shit fiancé, not to mention a shit friend, and knew he was being one.
When he let her in to perch on a stand by the wardrobe, Malfoy’s owl hooted at him perfunctorily and presented her perfectly manicured talons for Harry to remove the attached message.
Harry swallowed a bit hard. Could he pretend he didn’t know what Malfoy was talking about when the very real evidence was racing through his nerves at that very moment? Was he yet willing to admit, even to himself, that he knew exactly what Malfoy was talking about? He wasn’t sure when his eyes had closed, but he could feel the ghost of those words just at the nape of his neck, their meaning washed over him, and it was all very distracting—most especially when Malfoy only continued with a knowing sort of smugness.
Harry drew in a slow breath, trying to steady himself as the only thing that seemed to relieve the roiling of the ground beneath him was the center of gravity that the pressure on his wrist was giving him.
“Oh god,” he gasped, slowly coming to an awareness of exactly how hard he was—and how good it felt to be caught under a perfectly wicked friction.
“I’m not… only I’m not a heartless bastard, and not everyone’s handed a massive vault of gold when they’re eleven.”
Riding back up to the atrium, they could already hear the loud chattering of drunken Ministry employees enjoying their holiday party.
After a long stretch where he thought he might never stop gasping, Harry managed to produce actual words.
Even Charlie had turned up for the news (and to celebrate with his brother) toward the end of the week. He had popped by to Harry and Ginny’s as well, to see the house. Harry was glad to have the chance to have a drink with him, it had been far too long, and there was a certain ease when he talked to Charlie that Harry had missed.
“You are not.” He plopped down on Draco’s posh modern settee, which was much more comfortable than it appeared to be. “Come here.”
Once they started exchanging the gentle up or down pressure of their hips together, they went on like that quietly teasing and sparking pleasure for several minutes, until they were both hard again.
“I am capable of them, but I doubt I could do them all myself—nor would I want to. I think it would be wise for you to start small, and even then—"
Harry’s breathing went a bit heavy—a heady mix of desire and nerves. It was a lot of trust to be placing in him that he wouldn’t fuck this up somehow and accidentally—well, an infinite number things might go wrong with his magic conduit stuck right up Draco’s arse.
Harry found him leaning leisurely against a tree, eerily reminiscent of a time right at the catalyst to the war, that summer at the Quidditch World Cup. They had been so young then, not knowing what was just on the horizon.
“I’ve brought my notes, but I wasn’t thinking and they’re currently shrunk down in my pockets. That’s obviously not going to work here, we’ll have to improvise without them. Have you got a…writing object?”
He felt a flutter of panic even thinking about telling anyone all that had occurred between them that evening. He made an attempt to keep his anxiety internal, but he wasn’t doing a very good job of it.
It was a few beats later before Draco’s curiosity got the better of him and he followed just behind. Harry was surprised to find that most of the furnishings in the sitting room were simple, modern and sleek. The kitchen too looked surprisingly like a modern Muggle kitchen—excepting its lack of electrical appliances—and Harry had to wonder exactly how much research Draco had been doing into Muggle houses to pull it off so accurately.
They caught each other up on work. Ron shared some great shop stories, Hermione did her best to summarise her progress on the new legislation she was so engrossed with, and they discussed the Aurors’ latest raids—a rounding up of the few Death Eaters with any traces left to find after two years, and anyone implicated in some of the more recent trials. Trainees weren’t allowed on raids, but Harry still had some interesting bits of inside information to share with them.
He felt an immediate pang of guilt for the jab, but then Malfoy was speaking before he could apologise.
When she went away for long periods of time, she would occasionally owl Harry to meet for tea or drinks, if she had the time, but she’d warned him this time their captain was expecting total focus, and no distractions. It was all something to do with team unity and shared experiences apparently—which sounded pretty legitimate to Harry.
“That’s a joke, Potter. It’s down the end of the corridor. Don’t get lost. If the portraits get chatty, try to avoid mentioning your name.”
He might’ve internally debated with himself whether it was the best idea to be having wine so early in the day, but as an astute grey gaze narrowed at him knowingly, he was rather glad to have it.
It was vaguely reminiscent of alcohol, but with obviously faster-acting effects and a bit…hotter. Malfoy was watching him quite closely again, and it was coiling a flush of warmth all through Harry, tight as a spring.
“There was nothing they did for us that I can’t do with an enchanted mop, a recipe spell or a proper
When Harry found Draco napping on the settee by his desk, something very deep in him stuttered hard—and Harry was pretty sure it wasn’t anything to do with his cock.
Harry tensed when Malfoy caught at his sleeve, but he only tugged him a step closer. The feather-light tracing of Malfoy’s fingertips slipped beneath the cuff of Harry’s shirtsleeve, brushing against the inside of his wrist—sparking tendrilled bursts of hot, pure pleasure from every ghosting touch.
They collapsed together in a tangle of legs, eager hips, and hurried attempts to strip as quickly as possible—with the aid of hands and magic alike.
“You look as if you’re being tortured, Harry. Relax and try to have fun, won’t you? It’s meant to be a celebration.” His fiery-haired fiancé gave him a strong shove to the back, propelling him in the direction of the bar.
At around eleven-thirty on Saturday Harry gathered up his notes, with a few of Draco’s books he wanted to return, and took the Floo to Malfoy Manor as planned.
Harry braced himself on the wall behind the curtain as he pushed his cock into Draco all over again. He tried not to rush it either, but as Draco’s progressively louder moans filled the increasingly steamy little bathroom, he gave in to doing whatever his cock wanted him to do—and that was clearly working for both of them.
Draco considered him a moment before he seemed to let his guard down, critical silver surveying the mess of Harry’s sitting room with a silently judging eyebrow arch.
That night found Harry seated at a small round dining table over takeaway curry from the Muggle place down the block. Ron had taken quite a liking to it—Harry was fairly sure they’d had it every second time he’d been there.
Draco shivered, letting slip a very soft groan, and Harry was pretty sure he was about to get what he wanted.
“Yes alright, I get it. You hate the venue. You can decide where we’re meeting next, if you’re determined to be so bloody particular about it.”
The Quaffle under Ron’s arm came flying at him and Harry righted his angle to catch it, the impact of its momentum nudging him back in the air a smidge.
Harry very emphatically ignored what the sound of it was doing to him. “He’s saved my life, more than once. He also knows how to keep a secret—but we aren’t staying here, there’s a free table in the corner.”
Sleepily he grumped over to the window, only to freeze, his hand stilling on its rusty latch when it dawned on him whose owl was paying him a visit. An uncomfortable twist took up residence in his chest, paired with a rush of completely unnecessary adrenalin, all of which Harry tried to ignore.
Draco had arrived in a perfectly fitted suit, with no tie or jacket. He came across shockingly professional, and somehow attractively casual all at once, resembling more a young banker, than a young Wizard.
Malfoy pulled the music box off the table, and Harry shook out the bag, situating it so its open top faced him.
He also apparently really needed to go shopping, but he had what he needed to make up a couple of cheese and pickle sandwiches. Draco looked at his with extreme suspicion, but he ate it anyway.
When they had finished eating, and Draco enchanted the dishes to do themselves, they returned to the library.
Harry faceplanted into a pillow, and immediately went back to sleep. He missed Draco watching him with an exhausted sort of disbelief before rolling out of bed to make a cinnamon hot chocolate.
“I’d thought about bringing the whole thing to you, of course, but I know you’ve both been very busy—”
Draco smirked, catching at Harry’s cock to tug him toward his last tent, past the kitchen table with their abandoned firewhisky, through the sitting room, and straight to bed.
They ended up working for nearly two hours, and by the time they were wrapping up, Harry felt he had a much better handle on what all Draco was working toward with his cocktail of spells. He had his doubts he had the skill to cast them—but Draco seemed to have a fairly high opinion of Harry’s abilities, and Harry hated to disappoint.
Draco’s answer was low and desperately lustful. “You’d like that wouldn’t you? Lying here night after night, remembering how many times you’ve made me come.”
“I’ve created the recipe for this myself,” Malfoy was saying casually. “It’s quite an interesting mix.”
When they reached the tree, Draco had looked as if he might say something as well, but instead, backed Harry firmly against its rough trunk, dampening the back of his shirt. The warmth of his breath puffed at Harry’s lips just before he was kissed quite lingeringly, laced with hints of wine, but overwhelmingly the spiced apple tart thing they’d been sharing a few minutes ago.
He hadn’t seen Luna at all that day, and though he certainly didn’t blame her for not wanting to be there, Harry made a mental note to owl her to be sure she was alright.
That sneer itched under Harry’s patience, but he wasn’t there to argue with Malfoy about not being an utter twat. Aberforth had surely seen more intimidating clientele by far, although Harry wasn’t sure it was the best idea for Malfoy to go around insulting the people preparing his drinks.
“D’you think if we’d had to work together on something like this in school, we might’ve been…less like we were?”
“For the hand—? Or had you meant for my mouth,” Malfoy taunted, effectively, as Harry went rosy all over again.
“I still don’t understand,” said Hermione. “Why would you ever want Malfoy’s help with something like this in the first place?”
There was a quiet moment as Draco absorbed this and Harry searched for his jeans—surely, his pants must be with them.
When the tent had finished setting itself, Malfoy charmed one of the flaps open for him, and Harry tried to keep in mind what he had said about stretching and not exploding, whilst also staying focused on the task at hand.
“I’ll run them through the usual checks if it would make you feel better about having them in the house.”
They rocked together in a few blissful minutes of intensity, all it took for Harry's hardness to stir again inside encouraging tightness. The moment he could he started a shallow pace of thrusts, drawing out every sound he could from the man under him. It took much longer to get close, nearly an hour, but Harry obviously didn’t mind the devilishly pleasurable process of getting there—and when he was very close he pulled out.
Harry set the music box down on the table a touch tentatively, pulling open its lid before taking a step back. “You know Hermione used one of these on a handbag when we were on the run…sorta saved our arses more than once.”
He spent all of his Saturday morning and most of the afternoon practising and reviewing Draco’s spells. It was actually going fairly well, he thought. He didn’t have the space to set up a tent to check, but he was developing a better understanding of patterns, and the long ritual of the casting was starting to become muscle memory—usually a sign he was well on his way toward mastering a spell.
When he got home from work that evening, he collapsed on the settee in the sitting room, and was asleep in minutes. He slept there for several hours, and only woke when Ginny called him out to the kitchen for tea.
Before he left that night Harry promised to stay in touch more, and to update Hermione on some of what he had been up to in London—though he knew he would need to be selective about revealing exactly how many Secrecy Statues they were planning on breaking.
The innocent request brought to the forefront of Harry’s mind the first time they'd visited, when he’d been fully prepared for Draco to make a terrible fuss over the indignity of the whole affair. But in reality he hadn’t expressed the slightest hint of discomfort. Harry thought it was possible the discomfort might be in there somewhere, but Draco was too good at hiding things when he wanted.
Harry decided to walk back to town, and said his goodbyes to Arthur as well before he carried on down the road with his broom and his own plate of leftovers.
Harry drew a little star under the question and used the pad of his finger to erase her question mark. He left the light on, so as to draw her attention, and set it on his bedside table so he wouldn’t miss any further messages, or forget to pack it.
He was glad to find her in her office, and checked with her to see if she had the time available to speak with him and Draco. Cassie’s only available day that week was Wednesday morning quite early, and Harry had given her a tentative yes.
Draco came sudden and hard, suppressing a cry against Harry’s lips. Harry felt the heat of his release soaking through to wet a bit of his own swollen cock with a faint slickness.
Although Harry supposed she would be Renna Lester now, having just married a former Slytherin several years her senior called Lester whom Harry didn’t know at all. He had barely spoken to Renna before that day, though he recognised a fair number of their guests.
He nodded absently, though his focus was far more on his notes and questions. “If I’m following you at all… a lack of permanent housing and a lot of stipulations to accessing it in the first place is what’s leaving so many people on the streets? I’ve noticed a number of small, er—encampments, I suppose—around the city lately.”
He reaffirmed Harry was comfortable with the first layers, before he added on all the spell modifications he had perfected since the last time. It took them several hours to work through it before they could move on to discussing the particulars—such as how many tents they would need to enchant, how many they could fit at the site, if it was too risky to use magic to squeeze in more, and what the best illusions were to make them all appear to be proper houses inside and out.
The friction was purely overwhelming, and in time Harry lost a battle of wills with his stamina, and came very hard. He let out a soundless sort of cry, tensing through his ecstasy, as Draco kept up a rubbing pressure with his cock, unrelenting and quickening, until he spilled in the tangle of sheets between them, adding heat to Harry’s mess with a throaty moan.
He had expected some sort of marble monstrosity but what he found was just a normal bathroom, not so very different from those at Hogwarts only slightly fancier plumbing, and an unusual number of curtains.
“Fuck’s sake, Potter,” Malfoy expelled in some strange mix of disgust and amusement. “Nevermind—only sit down before you fall down.”
They weren’t to stay in their usual rooms. No, there was no returning to crowded dorm life now that they had been in contact with one of the most infectious wizarding diseases still in existence. That was the only perk in the whole mess: Draco would be staying in rooms meant for faculty, which meant a private sitting room and lavatory. Sure, Draco would rather have shared the improved accommodations with a friend instead of Potter, but he took what he could get.
She allowed the change in topic and called them into the kitchen where she pulled a pie from the oven and set it at the table. "Steak and ale tonight."
Draco wanted to comment on Potter's unnecessary repetition of established fact, but he knew he should temper his usual goading while they were trapped in close quarters. He had driven Potter to Curse him open once before, and there was no Snape to Charm his chest back together if Potter snapped again. Best to say nothing and pretend Potter wasn’t even there.
He faced Draco again with an attempt at haughtiness of his own. “Well if I’m with you, you won’t have to wonder what I’m getting up to.” He was delighted to see Draco’s cheeks pinken. He didn’t deny it!
Harry nearly made a snarky comment, but then he saw the protective look the dragon gave Draco as Harry approached. Best not to risk it.
Merryn’s eyes flashed at him referencing her less-than-subtle obsession, but she walked away without conveying her irritation to Gabby.
Firm arms wrapped around his waist and Draco's low voice spoke in his ear. "The next dance is yours."
“The one you saw was Rosamund’s, Merryn’s mother. She cooks for the sunroom, mainly traditional Cornish food. That was one of my great-aunt Gwenna’s conditions for using her home. She didn’t want everything to be French and the guests to forget where they are. Rosamund makes sure of that.”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “No. Then I would have to make the same things every day. People would expect to have their usuals, and they would want a broad range. Even worse, I would have to be in London, or at least a large town. This way, with the hotel, I get to be at home and create a relaxing retreat for others to come into. I can make what’s seasonal or what fits my mood, and I can match the menu to the guests.” He smirked and glanced over at Harry. “Like when Weasley came. I knew the boy who devoured Chocolate Frogs like that would grow into a man who would adore my version of a flourless chocolate cake.”
But it was growing to be quite late, and Draco asked him to leave everything behind, until he had the energy for casting such a complicated spell.
He did not remember it being quite this blinding the last time, but Harry had also been in something of a panic then. As it was, when the door to the Time Room swung open before them, on the first try no less, he had to shield his eyes, and Malfoy was not far behind him in doing so.
For perhaps too long, Harry stood in the empty lift as his mind raced. He would need to find Ginny, assuming she had returned. He would also need to somehow not behave like a complete prat, despite the guilt and uncertainty currently raging in his mind. He could already tell it would not be an easy task.
Without thinking much about it, he sniffed at the bubbles, which smelled distinctly sweet—just before they went directly up his nose. He choked, nearly panicking further when Malfoy began pointing a wand at him, but he only charmed Harry’s nose clear with a wordless flick.
Harry and Draco spend the rest of Thursday finishing all the Extension Charms, and indulging in a late-night reward for all their hard work.
He was lucky they were managing to do it all while Ginny was out of town, as there would’ve been no way for him to explain away his sitting room floor being covered in tent bags last night. It had taken him several hours to shrink them all down small enough to fit into the one bag.
He found Ginny at a small table at the edge of the dancefloor, watching the other dancers with no small amount of longing. Harry felt a twist of guilt as he pulled up a chair beside hers.
“M’might not have managed to kill him at all, f’it weren’t for you.” He knew Malfoy didn’t know the whole story, few did, but Harry could admit that much to him.
He was curling them to rub at the right spot when the stiff twitch of a long cock pressed to his arm and Draco lifted off. He didn’t need to ask if he was ready, not the way Draco’s arse started chasing the tip of his cock.
Even despite the horrors in his dreams, he couldn’t help but to be quite excited that they were getting closer to actually seeing their ideas come to fruition. Draco had said they might only need a few more weeks of practice and refining.
Harry stopped himself short of expressing his thanks again. Given how much it seemed to annoy him, he reconsidered, and settled on:
—and the soft pink swirl of Draco’s arsehole was right there, in front of his face, and Draco looked so unguarded just then with his legs sprawled open, one knee hooked over the arm of the chair—
Standing together in a drizzly alley as the rain patted down steady on the umbrella over them, Harry very nearly kissed him when Draco finally did look at him again. He felt the draw of it, and was sure Draco saw the way he couldn’t keep from staring at his lips but—
He set about to pay for their drinks—but Aberforth waved him off with a grumbled dismissal that left Harry smiling a bit softly. “See you later then.”
“It’s quite a lot to ask sight unseen, I know. You don’t have to make any commitments, and I don’t want you feeling obligated to help us—but we really could use your expertise.”
“Of course,” Malfoy drawled drolly. “But if you mean to do this properly you’ll need to do better than that knock-off hand-me-down rag the Weasleys had you in. We could do a lot better than that, with the right spells we could actually get quite creative—the real key is the Undetection, and the proper protections. Start with the reading.”
He knew it was wiser to tell her only as much as she needed to know, but that would get more difficult when they inevitably invited her to be more involved.
“Right then, essentially, private use of Undetectable Extension Charms is strictly prohibited by the Ministry—specifically because of the Secrecy Statutes, you know. Production of those few objects that do use Extension Charms is very tightly controlled by Misuse of Muggle Artifacts and the Improper Use of Magic office.”
“Let’s say, favours. I satisfy you, you satisfy me. We get on with our lives... satisfied. Does that sound
Despite Draco’s playful tone, Harry flustered, but he also gave voice to another thought which had been turning about in his head for a while.
He had brought his Muggle notebook along, and he flipped it open to a blank page and handed it over, with a ballpoint pen that Draco made a face at, but also didn’t struggle to write with in the slightest.
If Aberforth found it at all strange Harry was sitting down to have a drink with a Malfoy, he didn’t let on.
He met him that morning in the Ministry’s atrium, and though he wasn’t waiting long, it did give his mind time to wander as he surveyed the room. Some things had not changed; the lifts still stood behind a massive golden gate, the main area remained lined with hearths stretching out farther than a single person could see, and the ceiling still arched high above them, glinting and flashing with bifurcating magic light.
a tease. The sound of him moaning, his voice raw with arousal as he took Harry in harder and for longer every time was possibly one of the hottest things that Harry had ever heard. Though lately there was a lot of competition.
As the half-hardness of their cocks pressed together in the constant unhurried rock of their hips, they both moaned, during and between all the kissing.
It felt so strange to him being there—not in the bathroom specifically, but the whole manor. Harry still had his reservations that coming back was a good idea, but the library had been so comfortable, and somehow untainted enough he could almost forget they had all very nearly died in this place.
“Harry’s breaking the Secrecy Statutes…” Hermione trailed off to frown at him again. “—with Malfoy? Good heavens, are you sure you can trust someone like
Whispering a spell to relax him, one more to cover his eager cock in slickness, and Harry’s groan went growled shoving into him hard in three determined thrusts. Draco cried out a little at each, squirming against the mirror as Harry pushed flush to his arse, this particular position providing a near perfect angle for fucking right into his sweet spot.
“I’ll survive,” he drawled indolently. “I’m fairly certain I slept most of the night on top of you anyway.”
He moved around behind Harry’s chair for the space to Disapparate, but just before he did, Draco brushed his fingers softly at the nape of Harry’s neck, sending chills trailing down his spine, and leaving him quietly gasping, alone in his kitchen.
When they switched places, Harry bent over the chair’s back, bracing himself on the mirror as Draco had done, close enough to see the depths of his arousal edged in green.
“Do you even know what you’re looking for down here? Half these rooms are deadly and the others are just severely dangerous.”
Cassie looked fairly incredulous, and her smile when it came around was tentative at best. “I hope so too, Mr. Potter. We’ll take all the help we can get here, and I’ll do whatever I can to help your case.”
“I suppose that’s one way to solve a problem,” Draco drawled derisively. “What’ve they got you working on in Poisons and Antidotes?”
“I’m not sure I understand, you’re helping Muggles in London with Malfoy? What help could he possibly be with anything non-magic? And you
“Shut up, Potter. I’m fine. It’s only a stupid charm.” He was scowling, but Draco went on in a testy mumble: “However if you need any help with the casting…”
It was a little ridiculous how much it turned Harry on to see Draco propping himself back on the desk as he was, spreading his legs enough for Harry to fit between them, and work his fingers up to the most hidden parts of him.
Draco’s hips jerked rewardingly back on him, and Harry had to find the rhythm of his impact again—but then he did.
make it up to me by asking me to dance, Harry,” she hinted, with all the subtlety of a bludger to the head.
They passed a small market on their way to the next place, none of its stands very busy given the increasing deluge of rain, and Harry stopped to get a coffee. Draco refused one, but proceeded then to drink a good half of Harry’s as they walked.
Harry probably should’ve been in a hurry. He shouldn’t’ve been doing this during work hours at all—but the way Draco’s low moan filled the tiny room when Harry guided the tip of his cock past the tight ring of Draco’s arse... it was very hard to care about anything else.
Their formal outing wasn’t as torturous as he’d expected, their earlier meeting had been quite encouraging, and they’d only been caught out in the rain a couple times. Overall, Harry thought it was a pretty successful afternoon.
Perhaps because he was losing all pretence of denying exactly what his body was craving just then, his tone took on a mischievous lilt. “Can’t… what?”
Beyond the familiar sneer there was a disconcerting glint of excitement in the silver of Draco’s eyes, and Harry was momentarily distracted by them.
“My parents have retired to France on a semi-permanent basis. Generally, they only return for special occasions. The Manor officially answers to me now.”
“I want all of you, Harry,” Draco drawled hoarsely between quiet moans. “Come inside. I want to feel it.”
Beyond the already uncomfortable secrets he was living with Harry knew he needed to talk to her, and about Draco—or at least, what he had been working on with Draco. She’d expressed her concerns to Hermione and Ron, but Harry was a little irritated that she hadn’t just asked him directly—even if he was just as guilty of avoiding conversations with her these days.
“Honestly I could use it,” Harry admitted. “Hermione sent me some reading, but it’s pretty advanced and I’ve never done it before.”
“Right… listen, Harry, there’s been a bit of an emergency in Holyhead. Duke’s had an injury, and they’ll need me to be there if they’re meant to run these new plays…”
Hermione, true to form, sent him a parchment scroll of information nearly six feet long, with a letter warning him again to be careful.
Most of what anyone was willing to say was vague at best, and often only anecdotal—but that hadn’t stopped Harry jotting it down—just in case.
“Prat,” Draco muttered, but Harry caught the twitch of a smirk as he hastened out to wait for their drinks in the ballroom.
For a few weeks in June Harry spent too much of his time sat at his cubicle filling out reports, working out long scrolls of parchment on theory, or simply studying. He would sometimes do Draco’s reading at work too, though for the time being, with Ginny home, his spell practice was relegated to what little time he could get to himself in the attic.
Whilst he was occupied with that, Draco went back to do a proper clearing of the bedroom, gathering up Harry’s things and his own—dirty laundry and all.
Malfoy might’ve been pissed off about the hair pulling, but he caught on quite quickly, letting Harry fall from his lips only long enough to nip his teeth up the underside of his cock before he was taking him in again, with quite a bit more edge.
As the two walked an unhurried path back to the Burrow, the dusk long since faded into proper night, Ron caught him with a question which stirred an immediate anxious tightening in Harry’s chest.
Harry hurried to sit up, to get his fly undone, pull his cock free from its confinement and find the breathtaking tightness of Draco’s arse to sink himself into.
Draco’s eyebrow arched into a wry look. “Probably…so long as no one else disrupts my work with their ridiculous bouts of jealousy.”
Draco did not stay over that night, though Harry hadn’t offered either. It was a step too far for his guilt to handle.
Harry wrote back to suggest an afternoon in mid-April for their meeting, and Malfoy agreed. In the week proceeding, he’d gone back to the attic, retrieving Malfoy’s Portkey from his trunk and preparing a few other things as well, including an ordinary Muggle tent, perhaps a bit old fashioned with its canvas and rope, but it would do for a practice run.
“It’s your…push lights. I’ve tested them with the markers, they work. I did both so you’ll have a spare. They’re shrunk down, you’ll just have to unshrink them then.”
Exhaling hard, he thrust his shaft stickily over Harry’s lips, and Harry licked all over it, an overload of sugar contrasting the salty drops from his tip.
Draco followed behind him, spacing them more evenly and farther apart with efficient flicks of his wand.
He let Draco focus on his getting into his pants. Harry focused on locking their lips together, his fingers catching in the soft hair at the nape of Draco’s neck.
Harry let himself out of her office, his mind turning anxiously over how he was going to make it through the rest of the afternoon, as tired as he was—but he had about twenty minutes left, perhaps he could pop into the Leaky Cauldron for a nap after all.
As always, thanks for reading, the kudos and the feedback, and enjoy!! Summer's been kicking my arse and I wish I had more time to work on this lately, it's the most fun I've had writing in ages. But I'll keep poking at it until it's finished!
“It’s nothing,” Draco dismissed, nodding his head to the door they’d come through. “Let’s get back to it, then.”
“Would tell the whole of everyone we know before morning tea. I think not. The very last thing I need is my father hearing about any of—whatever it was. More to the point, it’s obviously over now.”
Draco swatted the side of his head, ungently, then tangled long fingers in messy hair and pulled him down for another hard kiss. Harry moaned, muffled yet still embarrassingly loud.
Harry chewed his lip uncertainly. “I think...maybe he’s just bored? He said he was, er— ‘intellectually invested’ or something.”
Silver eyes were significantly clearer now when they blinked questioningly down at him. Harry peered back up uncertainly before catching Draco at the back of the neck and pulled him down into a tangle of lips that both men only ever broke long enough to breathe softly between. Draco gave up holding himself up over Harry and simply fell flush down on him again. They went on kissing in that way, shifting slowly against each other with a simmering sort of urgency until Harry began to notice the sky growing steadily darker.
“There aren’t any good permanent solutions for a lot of people, they’ll come out the other end of the system and many still need our help, which we are trying to provide—but if the cracks are there, people will keep falling through them.” She took a very deep breath. “Does that make any sense?”
After he finished up, Harry’d had enough waiting, and became rather preoccupied rubbing against the tempting rise of his arse.
“If you’re so sure you’ve got them down, this shouldn’t take us any longer than an hour. I’ll do them first—I’ve made up a list so we don’t leave out any of the components. Look it over, tick them off as we go along.”
Harry pressed up for another kiss and they moaned working their hips together forcefully—but then Harry broke the rules, teasing his fingers beneath the back hem of Draco’s bottoms, tracing between his cheeks and on to touch and press at the hidden pucker of his arse.
“Only because you’ve asked so nicely,” Harry snarked back, but had already started working his mouth exploringly down again—
“Fuck, yes.” Harry laughed relief following him. “If tomorrow’s anything like today’s been, I’ll need to sleep for a week afterward.”
Groaning low into the kiss, Harry shoved him back against the edge of the desk hips-first, just as Draco’s hand closed around the quickly-hardening length of Harry’s cock and squeezed tight for Harry to thrust into.
It was hot enough that Harry was struggling not to come every time—which appeared to be the point. Almost painful, perfectly pleasurable.
With tired interest, Harry watched him arching out of his pants and, despite his concerns, was immediately hurrying to get out of his own.
And liking blokes really wasn’t the heart of the problem, it was much more the fact he was still engaged, and currently fancying the pants off fucking
By the time he returned home that evening his feet ached. It had been an embarrassingly long time since he’d done so much walking, having been bogged down in paperwork, law classes and his projects at the house. It was a good sort of sore at least, and despite his earlier concerns, Harry did feel a bit like he was accomplishing something.
“I’m not understanding the point—feels sort of annoying actually,” Harry mused, straightening his shoulders a bit as he adjusted to the potion.
When he’d finished at work, Harry spent a couple of hours running errands in London, then hurried home after to pack a bag with several changes of clothes, and his toothbrush.
He didn’t know what Malfoy needed—but Harry finally gave in to his own persistent desire to suck a very slow, biting kiss into the flushing skin on Malfoy’s throat where he had just been teasing. When he bit down harder, and his tongue traced a slow circle, Malfoy went suddenly taut, tightening in tension against him—a warm heat growing where the tip of his cock pressed between them.
Neville joined them then, Dean and Seamus only a moment later, all combining to divert the conversation away to tales of their many school mishaps.
Harry nipped purposely just beneath his navel and watched the shock of pleasure cross pointed features. The kitchen’s wooden floorboards creaked a bit under his knees as Harry worked Draco’s trouser buttons open by hand.
Draco whispered a spell, and hooked a knee up over Harry’s shoulder—one, then the other—and he was suddenly incredibly exposed.
Harry still waited several beats before he cancelled all the spells on the door, and Draco quirked a questioning eyebrow before he opened it.
It was a bit of a challenge, which of them might break first—and on this rare occasion Harry won and Draco flushed a touch pink in the cheeks.
The sleep was deep enough he didn't notice Malfoy leave, and only woke when Ginny shook him to consciousness well into the night.
His temper faltered, green eyes flashing uncertainly behind the anger. “Why was he naked in your bedroom?”
Draco tightened deliberately around his cock, squeezing through the last twitches of Harry’s climax. Harry’s vision flashed white with pleasure.
Returning to the dreary streets of London, they discovered that it had begun to rain whilst they were engaged in their meeting.
The Dementors were quite quick lately, not so sluggish as they had been over most of the summer. Even in daylight they advanced on them with startling speed. It was now or never.
When he bit harder, just above the line of his pants, Draco moaned, his hips twitching forward impatiently. Harry tugged his pants down below his arse and helped to pull the stiff length of Draco’s cock free from them.
But he knew in truth there was a great deal more to it than that, more even than he was entirely willing to acknowledge.
Through a partial obfuscation of blond, Draco was watching him with a smouldering sort of wonder, only there in the heartbeat it took for him to register Harry’s attention before he was masking it away under a cocky smirk.
Alone in his sitting room, Harry cleared his throat as his cheeks warmed, but Draco was still writing.
Now that he was thinking on his job however, Harry couldn't stop himself thinking back on the last several months of perpetually clearing corners, alleys, and bridges of Dementor nests, drawn endlessly to the streets of London.
Unperturbed, Draco broke the seal and poured a proper two fingers of tawny liquid into their only glass.
Harry guided him deeper into the narrow room, ignoring more strange tugs of memories and dreams to focus on getting them to the other side without incident. Everything around them ticked loudly, at off times, and Harry didn’t know how anyone could stand to work in the room for any prolonged period of time without going completely mad. On the other hand, it was good cover on the off-chance anyone was around to notice them passing through.
Draco’s tongue slid tauntingly past his lips, not far behind in following him to feverish heights. Short sharp nails drew firm over Harry’s back, pulling himself in closer to thrust faster into speeding strokes until he came hard between them, the heat of it mixing with the cooling water rushing over them. He moaned through his orgasm, as Harry kissed and stroked him unrelentingly.
Harry felt something twist uncomfortably in his stomach at the thought of returning to the rest of the world, and Ginny, after everything that he’d just—
Harry sighed quiet relief. “Hoped you’d say that—think I fell asleep halfway through casting this last one. I’m shocked it hasn’t come out upside-down or something.”
Draco smirked, seeming to enjoy watching him try, and not bothering to fasten his own just yet. “I’m not complaining. Did you still want to go up there?”
By the time his meeting crept up on him Harry was very ready for a break. He waved off Savage’s offer to buy him a butterbeer at the Cauldron, and set off in the opposite direction.
He left it implied the consequences might apply to her, though in reality it was himself and Draco who would surely be paying that price. She didn’t need to know that now.
His head swam with a fading fog of whisky, but the ferocity of heat Draco was fueling all through him was wearing at the edges of his buzz, and bringing the absolute perfection of the man beneath him into incredibly hot, vivid clarity. He couldn’t stop looking into the dark dilation of black on silver—couldn’t stop watching the part of Draco’s lips when he gasped and the long stretch of his throat near-begging Harry to bite it when Draco tossed his head back to moan.
Everyone was very happy to see him, as if it were a delightful treat that he had popped in at all—only Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were looking at him with varying degrees of relief and concern.
Probably he should’ve considered the likelihood this would happen, but there wasn’t time to berate himself about it now. Without thinking twice about it he interlinked their fingers tightly to pull Draco out of the alley, down another long narrow road.
Spiralling his way lazily down toward the ground, he tried not to think too intently about the exact details of why he was so sore, for his own sanity’s sake.
Malfoy moved around the table far too gracefully for as many drinks as they had already consumed. Harry tensed a bit when he leaned in to speak more quietly. He was quite close.
“I wouldn’t’ve spent all these months researching if I intended to drop out on you now, Potter. It would be a waste. You couldn’t possibly do this without me, you’re hopeless.”
Harry snorted at the notion he would ever intentionally flatter a Malfoy, but his amusement faded as memories, too many and too dark, assailed his thoughts and quickened his pulse, until he managed to reign them in. Given the obvious consequences, he might’ve withdrawn from this line of thinking – but stubbornly his whiskey-soaked mind and terrible judgement would insist otherwise.
“I am. We’ll also need to seriously consider how we’re planning to shield it all from the powers that be—Wizard and Muggle. That is probably the most pressing thing I haven’t fully sorted yet. There are all sorts of Muggle-deterring spells, but that won’t do us any good if Muggles are meant to be living there.”
Waving him out of the way, Draco spun the chair with a wandless swirl, and properly stripped off what was left of his clothes before he was moving to kneel on the seat to face the mirror, bent slightly over the chair’s low back.
“Er. We also have a few more questions about the situation on the ground—so to speak. If you don’t mind.”
And with that matter sorted, they were finally as prepared as they thought they could be for the next morning.
“I think you’re overloading them, Potter. Perhaps we ought to try you on something with a bit more stretch to it first—something more substantial, less prone to breaking. Also, you’ll need to use your instincts; you’ve got to stretch the inside, not explode it.”
In the end, they had dispersed nearly a dozen small nests of Dementors from the city. Harry had discovered quite quickly that each was located within obvious proximity to some sort of centre of human sadness. The majority of them had been found in pockets of three or more, nested within small congregations of rough sleepers like some sort of great floating parasites. There had also been one unemployment office which had been somewhat overrun with them, until they’d managed to draw them all away.
“Breathe, Potter,” Malfoy muttered offhandedly, and Harry let out a sharp breath he hadn’t even been aware he was holding.
He opened his eyes at least, though he couldn’t recall closing them, and met directly with his own hazy green, his extremely heated cheeks, and a crooked tilt to the glasses he’d never bothered to remove. He heard Draco’s quiet chuckle as he moved back, offering a hand to help him stand upright.
He hadn’t been lying there very long—his eyes drifting closed in the bright afternoon sun—when it began to feel as if the ground under them were waving gently, as though an ocean rippled just beneath the surface.
It was difficult to modify the existing structure once it was all cast as one spell. If there were any major problems, they would have to start all over again—which they’d already had to do once, when one of Harry’s bathrooms had come out with no shower. He wouldn’t be making that mistake again.
Harry came with his own quaking moan and several unsteady thrusts. He’d come twice already that morning and it was painful but intensely good when Draco squeezed perfectly tight around him.
He chose one of the markers at random, the green one as it turned out, but before he did anything else Harry pushed down on the plastic bubbled button and both lights lit simultaneously.
Last year, only seven months off the War at the time, a push for normalcy and a desperate scramble to bury the proverbial bodies had driven the Ministry to hold a ball absolutely no one wanted to attend. It had been a rather depressing evening.
“Curse,” Harry replied succinctly, pulling out with a soft grunt before he was doing as Draco instructed and tucking himself all back into place.
Groaning again, he bit into the flushed center of Draco’s back where his mouth had landed, and Draco shuddered in the aftershock.
Harry nodded that way, and watched Draco Malfoy leisurely walk down his narrow hall into his tiny bathroom with the leaky taps to take a shower.
Draco’s wand-point stilled on his shirtsleeve, and he pulled a slight scowl. “Yes, you really should’ve.”
“I may be going mad,” Harry said conversationally circling around when the cluster started pecking too close to his shoes again.
Unfortunately, it became clear after only a few minutes that both Weasleys were very immersed in sorting out whatever it was that needed sorting. Rather than torture himself any longer, Harry made his excuses, deciding he had been at the ball long enough now that it was time to examine the beverages on offer.
“I’ll owl you with the latest once we’ve had a few days to get oriented—once I’ve got a feel for our new Chaser, and this year’s strategy of course…well, wish me luck.”
He was rubbing at Draco’s sensitive entrance with the pad of his middle finger for much longer than strictly necessary before forcing it inside—it was a far more unyielding space than he recalled—but as Draco adjusted, Harry thought he could start gently working in a second.
It was before he’d ever had a reason to meet Andromeda as well, when she was only a singed-off name in gold thread under a black scorch-mark, and whatever vague notion he’d had of what Tonks’ mum might be like. He was brought out of the memory of it when Draco started talking again, determinedly looking at his menu rather than at Harry.
arrived, Harry was not ready for it. He had been so busy, distracted and sleep deprived that he hadn’t realised it was upon them until the weekend before, and he’d been dreading it every day since.
It had not fully occurred to Harry that without elves Draco would surely do his own laundry, until he watched him levitate a swirling bundle of it out to the sitting room.
Harry hummed, pressing more at the taut ring of his arse, wetly prodding for Draco to relax open for him, so that he might carefully slide his middle finger in, slow and tight. He whimpered as Harry curled to touch at his sweet spot, and then he was whining even more.
“Right. Well I’ve managed to muss it once or twice—but I’ve either had to curse you or fuck you for hours to do it. Now could we go, please?”
He couldn’t stop yawning, and probably should’ve gone for a nap, but he really wanted to drop off his newly created method of communication. She was only a few blocks away, it seemed silly not to seize the opportunity.
Harry hoped he was right. The Dementors lately seemed to be growing in number once more, and though he had no real way of knowing why things got worse or better, it was wearing on Harry to be clearing them out of the same places over and over, with no improvement in sight.
That night he fell asleep on the settee with his book on patterns, and slept through most of the night—though not all of it. By about three-thirty he’d woken from another dream he couldn’t remember, just on the periphery of knowing but still too far to grasp it.
Harry rubbed tiredly at the back of his neck, trying to find words that might reassure them both, though he knew they probably did not exist.
It was a mad push of magic and inspecting as the evening wore on, but they did finally come to the end of the spiral, and even before midnight—though only just.
Somewhat reluctantly, Harry took the proffered scrolls to scan them. “Are curtains really that essential?”
Harry snorted and tossed a throw pillow at him. Draco redirected it with a wandless shove, and it landed on the floor instead.
All in all, it took them much longer than strictly necessary to get to the atrium, fully dressed and not touching. Partly because Harry’d had to summon some of his clothes, which he’d seen fit to leave a trail of between the library and Draco’s bedroom
When Harry moaned all around him, Draco’s legs spread a little wider for him, giving Harry access to properly finger-fuck him, trapping Draco between his fingers and his mouth.
That night, Harry dreamed of a high vaulted ceiling, reflecting a sea of pearly stars in milky white—but when he woke Tuesday morning and began the drowsy process of getting ready for work, all the exquisite detail of the dream faded quickly away to ethereal nothing.
That threw Harry off. Why would they need to speak to Arthur and Molly? Not that they hadn’t been incredibly heroic during the war, and sacrificed far more than anyone should’ve ever had to—but no, it dawned on Harry then the man had been referring to Ron and Hermione.
“Spread your legs for me,” Harry encouraged, flashing a wickedly keen half-grin in the dim firelight.
“Not that one. Way over your head.” Draco took it from his hands and replaced it with another. “Here.”
Draco took a step closer to him, his thumb running along the cut in question with an assessing narrow of silver eyes.
They changed in the bedroom together relatively quickly, if not a bit drowsily, neither of them bothering with shirts.
Even before they’d made it through the doors, the stark contrast between where they’d just been and where they now stood waiting for a table was jarring, to say the least, and only grew more so when they finally got inside. At just after two in the afternoon it was well past any sort of lunch rush, yet the restaurant remained packed full with people in posh clothes, who obviously had nothing better to do on a Friday afternoon than indulge in wine and expensive French cuisine.
Yet there it was on the parchment in Draco’s hand, an admission that fucking Harry on his birthday had been excellent.
“I can try. And I’ve been meaning to speak with Cassie again too—I had thought, now that we’re looking for an actual location, she might have some insight where might be good. She was willing to help the last time.”
A few slippery drops slid down Harry’s arse, and Harry was now so incredibly hard again he couldn’t keep from stroking himself to the feeling. His moan drew out, hoarse with aching need—
Harry went thoughtful a moment. Malfoy was right. Practically, it didn’t make sense to do a lot of work without first sorting out what was most vital.
When he thought about it, the realisation was a rather painful punch to his emotional core. He had to blink back a sudden mistiness in his eyes, clearing his throat, and scrambling to think of anything to say that wasn’t the truth.
Yet when he gave in to the impulse to consider things honestly, Harry inevitably reached a point where the urge to break things was a little overwhelming. He felt a bit trapped.
In the long stretch of minutes that it took for either of them to breathe normally again, Harry had drifted off to sleep.
As they joined the end of the queue, he shoved lightly at Draco’s shoulder, muttering a quiet ‘wanker’ when Draco only snickered at him. Then Harry was snorting a laugh as well, watching him surreptitiously running his fingers through his hair with a wandless drying charm until it laid nearly perfect again.
Harry was not awake at all when the soft nudge of a nose against his throat foretold the firm and sleep-warm weight of Draco sliding over to lay on top of him.
“Well,” Harry started. “I’ve done some practicing with the spell, with good results I think, but since we’re all theory today I’ll let you take over from here. Although I should say I’ve been really busy, and everything’s gone a bit scattered in my head.”
Draco summoned them a couple bottles of pumpkin juice from the kitchen, along with a couple of scones, an apricot for himself and, after consulting with him, a banana for Harry. It was a bit impressive to Harry he always managed so many simultaneous summonings and somehow didn’t lose anything along the way.
Harry thought it was clear something was very wrong with this process, he just didn’t understand why no one seemed to be doing anything about it.
Ginny pulled him to his feet, the leaf was lost,  and she helped to keep him steady while he tested out his legs.
Draco was glaring rather hard at the ceiling. Sans illusions there was only the tent’s black nylon up there, but Harry almost expected to see a burn hole where his gaze was currently fixed.
“Of course,” he admitted. “I’d forgotten all about it over Christmas—but, well basically when we spoke at the ball in December he’d offered to help with some research, that’s all.”
“It’s for Cassie,” Harry tried to explain. “I was planning to try a Protean Charm to keep in touch with her.”
“What?” Harry queried, but he followed Draco, who didn’t dignify Harry’s curiosity with an answer just yet.
Harry wanted to protest, but the gates were sliding open, and Malfoy was already stepping out of the lift. He might’ve pulled him back, but there were others milling about the main gates leading toward the atrium, and Harry didn’t want to attract any more attention than being himself did already.
Then Harry took the Floo home, and spent the rest of his Sunday looking through the book on patterns Draco insisted he familiarise himself with.
Draco chuckled, shifting to let Harry's cock slide out before he was stretching onto his front the wrong way across the bed. Harry immediately climbed up to lie atop him. He nestled his spent cock in the crack of Draco’s arse, kissing at the curve of his neck.
“I know that. I’m fine,” he snapped shortly, matching Harry’s concerned frown with a stubborn scowl. “It was only a dream.”
His spent cock twitched with residual interest on Harry’s tongue, when Harry went in on licking that clean too.
Harry had just summoned his jeans and Draco’s question caught him so off-guard he forgot to catch them, and they hit him in the face.
“Draco…” Harry’s breath caught with feverish anticipation as the pointed tip of Draco’s nose traced the soft line of hair beneath his navel, trailing down into Harry’s dark curls.
Harry hadn’t put much thought into his jeans that morning, and they made a decidedly odd pair as they settled into the wobbly folding chairs in Cassie’s tiny office.
The last had been Draco’s, and after a final inspection they stood together in its small kitchen, sharing a moment of weary relief. Though they were marking the end of only one portion of all the work they had yet to do, Draco was right that it was well worth celebrating, and he was quick to summon what they would need for a proper good time.
If either of them were any closer he might’ve started throwing punches. He could’ve had his hand on his wand in seconds, but he restrained himself. Mostly.
Really, Draco was irresistible when he was all wet. Squished so close together as they were, Harry couldn’t seem to keep himself from touching every bit of soaked skin he could get his hands on.
Moments later he was gasping a shocked sort of pleasure as Draco nosed gently under his bollocks to touch the tip of his tongue to Harry’s taint. The soft of his lips pressed to Harry’s balls with an open mouth, humming low as he started up rubbing all over them with the wet heat of it.
Draco huffed a soundless laugh, and Harry watched the flush blooming high at his cheekbones—but it was quite hard to look away when their eyes locked again, a profound sort of desire brewing between them, like a thread pulled taut.
To get Draco to safety, he needed to know the direction of the attack. Another flash of light came from the darkness beyond where they had searched. Away from the wind tunnels.
Potter pulled down his own pants and Draco stopped to take in the sight of a completely naked Potter. His shoulders and arms looked strong, but there was a vulnerability to his flat stomach and narrow waist. There was no bone there to protect him from any foe who might still wish to harm The Boy Who Lived.
"Do you want me to leave?" Draco did not want to let go, but he felt he didn’t deserve to have Potter in his arms after causing him pain.
"What? No!" Potter looked genuinely shocked. "I didn't say that! I don't think that at all."  The sneer was gone and Potter looked earnest once more.  "I just meant that you can be so bloody
She gave him a devious little smile, but it was the closest to actual warmth he had ever seen in her features. “May we quote you, Mr Potter?”
As the Aurors led Draco away, his hands bound in front of him, Potter stepped forward to stop them. He placed a warm hand on Draco's shoulder and leaned in close enough for Draco to smell him. He smelled like soap, fresh air, and sunshine: everything Draco wouldn't know for five years.
Draco shook his head and dropped his napkin. "No, thank you." The disappointment weighed on Harry until he noticed Draco walking towards him with a hungry look in his eye. He kissed Harry hard, his mouth still sweet from the cannoli. When he pulled back, he tenderly cupped Harry’s cheek. "Thank you for dinner, Harry. I had a wonderful time." He placed his lips to Harry’s once more before pulling away and heading for the door. Harry automatically followed as if his body could not be more than a metre from Draco’s. His mind whirled as he wondered what the next step for them was but worried to press Draco for too much too soon.
“Harry?” He blinked and looked up to find Charlie watching him in concern. Then Charlie laughed. “I guess it's a lot to take in on your first night, huh?” Harry nodded, glad for an excuse.
The two of them had become friends when Toby was sent by Magical Games and Sports to consult on a case of illegal performance-enhancing potions that were popular among some Quidditch players. It had been Harry’s first big Auror case, and Toby’s insight and experience had been invaluable. They had stayed close in the years since, eating lunch together or grabbing a pint after work.
Draco's mind filled with thoughts about the Abbott family's mediocre standing and wealth or how the particular witch was as plain as she was pretty, but he knew those things meant nothing to Longbottom. From the look on Longbottom's face, it was clear that he was happy in a way that Draco
The front door opened with the roar of loud rain beyond, and Draco was jolted back to the moment. There in front of him, in the entry to Draco’s hotel, was Harry Potter. Draco hadn’t seen him in years, other than a newspaper photo or two, but there was no mistaking him. He looked as awkward as he had as a child, seemingly unsure what to do with his wet cloak and bag as he closed the door against the rain outside. Not that he was unchanged by the passing years. He was possibly taller, and his jumper and jeans under his traveling cloak clung to a form more developed than the half-starved looking Potter who had defeated the Dark Lord. His face, too, looked matured in a way Draco had to admit was flattering.
Potter coughed out a laugh. "Not really. But I do have ears. A lot of guys spent eighth year discussing who had the largest breasts."
Draco coughed and gave him a pointed look before flipping open his copy of the file and beginning to read. Not wanting to appear useless, Harry opened his own file at his desk and did the same.
“Why do we have to spend so much time talking about rocks and sheep? I want to see dragons!” he said.  It might have sounded a bit like whining once he said it out loud.
They do not understand. Kauko is from far away, and he is still learning their language and their ways. Kauko will see Mehiläinen when he is ready.
Clever grey eyes searched Harry’s face before dropping to their joined hands. A smile spread across Draco’s face. “Perhaps this isn’t madness after all,” he murmured.
“Draco.”  Harry gathered the last of his courage and ignored the shattered remains of his pride.  “I just want you to know that I like you.  I like being your friend, and the sex is fantastic, but I really like you and . . . if you ever think that maybe . . . if you ever think you could want something more . . .”  Draco was staring at him and he felt the flush staining his own cheeks.  At least Draco wasn’t laughing.  Yet.  He shrugged to show that he was out of words.  What more could he say?
Draco had seemed receptive to all of his advances, both romantic and sexual, but Harry wasn't sure how many fuck-ups the other man would endure.  Draco Malfoy was not known for his patience, even if it did seem to have increased over the years.
Harry smirked at the thought of Draco being out of bed so early on a Saturday, especially without tea in his belly. Even the
Harry stepped into the jeans and pulled them up. They were much tighter than his own, but he rather liked the pressure against his arse. Was it weird to enjoy being fondled by an inanimate object?
George gave a little frown but nodded. "They wouldn't talk to me. They said they'd only talk to the Aurors."
Potter had the decency to blush a little. Unfortunately for Draco, it was an immensely flattering look on him. “I never saw Hufflepuff’s Common Room.”
Draco let his lip curl up in disgust. He worked with Bill Weasley, who was surprisingly charming and even easy on the eyes—for a ginger—but Draco was a long way from wanting to make nice with the Weasel and Weaslette.
He kissed Draco fiercely, pouring his outrage at any mistreatment into his lips and tongue.  He kissed his way down Draco's body and settled himself on his belly between the other man's legs.  Hovering above Draco's groin, he was reassured by the sight and smell of his arousal.  He stretched out his tongue and licked a long stripe from the dusty pink balls along a thick vein to the tip of his cock.  He teased the slit with his tongue before taking the head into his mouth.  He licked and sucked until Draco's heavy breathing gave way to moans and whimpers.
Harry smiled at Draco’s snobbery, but dutifully pulled out the gold and green tin of loose-leaf tea Narcissa sent each month and set about making Draco’s morning pot of tea.  The tin was running low, and Harry took that to mean he should expect Narcissa’s owl.  She seemed psychically connected to Draco’s tea leaf supply.  Harry could admit that Draco’s tea was superior to his own, but Draco refused to let him add milk to it, and that was how Harry liked his tea.  So Harry stuck with his bags and his milk, and Draco stuck with his disgusted comments and expressions.
“Oy!  Will you two stop flirting and get in here!” Ron shouted from the sitting room. Harry hadn’t even noticed him leaving the kitchen.  “We want to play team
Draco had all but forgotten about the race until Potter said it was time for them to line up with the other contestants. Nervousness slowly crept up his spine and down to his fingertips. Scrutinising the field, he was comforted to see no sign of mud among the lush green grass. And if Granger were going to make a Mudblood joke at his expense, it didn't seem it would hold the bitter loathing he'd imagined weeks before.
Instead of Transfiguring a stick into an axe, Malfoy reached into his pockets and withdrew a handful of seeds. Approaching the tree, he pulled the seeds apart, revealing that they were threaded together in a long garland. Malfoy held one end to the tree and gestured for Harry to hold it in place. Once Harry complied, Malfoy walked around the tree so that the seeds draped across the branches.
He kissed Draco hard and let his hands roam over the wonderful naked body in bed beside him. They both had morning wood, and there was no point wasting it. Draco responded eagerly, grabbing Harry’s arse and pulling him close until their groins rubbed together.
She explained that Harry had been Levitating Draco's coffin to the edge of the Burrow's anti-Apparition wards when he stopped to say his goodbyes. When he kissed Draco, he stopped concentrating on the Levitation Charm and the coffin fell to the grass where the impact knocked the piece of apple from Draco's throat to the front of his mouth. The Healer relayed all of this as she measured out a cup of goopy green potion and then poured it down Draco's protesting throat.
"Morning," Draco whispered. "What time is it?" He would need time to go home and clean up before the fair. Their race wasn't until half two in the afternoon, but he should be seen partaking in Muggle culture and supporting the Ministry. Perhaps Potter could recommend a Muggle food that wouldn't offend his sensitive palate.
Draco must have sensed the level of Harry’s sudden insecurity because he didn’t tease him.  “That would be lovely.”
“And given that you will be able to get away from me soon, so it won’t be endlessly awkward if I’m wrong about … I mean I think you feel the same.” Potter cleared his throat and sat up straighter. “Remember when we were talking about what we want in a boyfriend?”
Draco was afraid to sleep lest he awake to a corpse in the next bed. Part of him knew he was being ridiculous, but part of him knew his luck in recent years and didn’t want to take a chance. He worried Potter would choke, so he turned him onto his side. Of course, Potter kept flopping back. Draco ended up sitting on Potter’s pillow with Potter’s head rested on his thigh.
For one long moment they were both standing in nothing but their pants, and Draco's mind filled with a hundred exciting possibilities. Before his inebriation could convince him to try one, he threw himself into the nearest bed.
Potter lifted his head and turned onto his side. He reached out for Draco who immediately climbed onto the bed and pulled Potter into his arms.
Draco's eyes shot up from Potter's leg to his eyes. Their faces were nearly touching, and Draco wondered if they'd ever been so close even during their confrontations at Hogwarts. It would explain why Draco had never before noticed just how green Potter's eyes were behind those ridiculous glasses he wore.
Harry sat up and grabbed the paper. Sure enough, there was an article about their case complete with reference to Auror Potter and his Herbology expert, Draco Malfoy. According to the paper, there had been a raid on a warehouse the night before, so Fernsworth must have gotten some information after all.
“No. You don’t get to make my decisions. I’m almost seventeen. I’m almost of age.” She took a deep breath and then met his eyes with a seriousness Draco hadn’t seen in someone her age since the war. She suddenly looked just like her mother, and Draco felt compelled to listen the way he always did to Rosamund, even when he disagreed. “You don’t get to be the only one to suffer. We are a family ‘ere and we protect each other, but we also suffer together. You can’t take every ‘ex for me. You ‘ave to let me take one for you.”
Draco opened his eyes to bright light. Blinking, he realised there was nothing but light. White, as far as he could see. He stood up and looked around, but there was nothing but white. He began walking. Everything looked the same. He kept walking. There was no scenery to mark the passing of distance, but the act of walking was soothing. Draco wondered if it was the only thing keeping the inevitable panic attack at bay.
The Charmed broom knew the course and moved without him the moment he kicked off from the ground. It was more than a little disconcerting to be flying up into the daunting mountains with no idea of where the village of Bârlog was or how to get there, but for three hours he held his cloak around himself, clutched the broom tightly, and forced himself to appreciate the startling beauty of the forested mountains below him.
This Christmas, he sits in stained, threadbare robes on the hard stone floor of his cell. There are no decorations. His cell has nothing more than the hard bed, a thin blanket, and a bucket to catch the little waste his body can produce. There will be no feast, although Draco thinks his bowl of porridge that morning might have been slightly fuller than usual. Perhaps the kitchen staff are feeling soft. Perhaps Draco's mind is going. That might be for the best.
She shrugged lightly. "Maybe he is but, like you, is too fixated on a particular person to notice when anyone else is flirting."
Draco's eyes gleamed, and it egged Harry on.  For once in their lives, Draco liked it when Harry talked.
“Nauseating, isn't it,” said the familiar drawl in his ear.  Harry spun around so quickly that he nearly slipped off his stool.  As it was, he slid forward and found himself flush against the delicious man who'd come up behind him.  “Easy there.”
It shouldn't have worked.  It was a stupid line, but Harry's body was responding to Draco's heat and his smell and the fact that he was right there, naked, and beautiful.  Shit, he really was, wasn't he?  His pale hair and skin gave him an ethereal glow that contrasted with the feral look in his eyes.
He cast a Disillusionment Charm on Draco and hated the way Draco slowly became part of the hedge behind him. Once Draco’s hand was on his left arm, Harry used his right to Disillusion himself and cast a Notice-Me-Not on both of them. Night was falling fast, but the moon was almost full and could expose them without charms.
He looked into those deep green eyes and knew, knew , that he would find happiness if he gave in to hope.  He took a deep breath, smiled, and placed his hand over one of Harry's fidgeting ones.
Harry chided himself as he forced his thoughts to the flowerbed beside him.  The daffodils had finally bloomed, and he fondly recalled his friends arguing as Hermione had planted the bulbs last autumn. Ron had mocked the flowers for not doing anything, but Hermione had insisted on having Muggle flowers among Ron’s twinkling Fairieflowers and his gently purring Calilillies.
When will you stop pinching my arse, he silently questioned.   Useless cow .  Contrary to his thoughts, he threw another brown-nosing smile over his shoulder before heading into her office.
He laid very still, feeling Potter's chest rise and fall beneath him and listening to their mingled panting.  As his heart rate and breathing slowed, he started to doubt he was dreaming.  His mind struggled with the unlikely fact that he had just pulled Harry Potter in reality.
“More Charms?” Potter looked confused as he glanced up from his magazine. “We just had the essay and the reading, right?”
“Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves,” Harry's calming words were undermined by his own enormous grin.  “Let's get these guys in custody and then celebrate!”
“No, thanks, Draco.  I think they’re trying to close up.”  He looked over his shoulder at the elderly couple who ran the inn.  They were cleaning off tables and putting out lights.
Kensa stepped forward. “I owe you an apology. I acted horribly, but please understand, I was just trying to protect Jowan.”
When the coffee appeared before them, Draco took the opportunity to busy himself with preparing two cups and ignoring the topic at hand. Potter just sat watching him.
But that had been back when Draco had believed that Potter's bed was fully booked. Now Draco knew better.
Harry gave him another quick kiss before pulling Draco into the warmth of the entryway and shutting the door behind them. Draco dropped his leather case by the stairs and let his fingers twine with Harry’s as they walked down the hallway to Rosamund’s kitchen. Smells of beef, onion and buttery pastry filled the hallway, and Draco felt his stomach rumble in anticipation.  He really hoped Rosamund was making pasties.
Draco propped his head up on his hand to look over at him.  “I didn’t think you were interested in anything more.”
All mirth left Draco's face. 'Trust me, that's not . . .' He shook his head and put on a smile that Harry didn't believe. 'Hermione has plenty to give me grief about.' Not work, but possibly related to Hermione, Harry noted.
“It’s not using me if I want to help you. And Ron was actually the first person to ask me to help this place.”
The spells were coming closer. Harry needed to buy them time. He cast several Blasting Charms at the front of the tunnel until he heard a shout of pain and saw the fabric of the tunnel collapse to the ground. With a quick Lightening Charm, he hoisted Draco over his shoulder and ran toward the back of the tunnel.
“The food was really good.” Hermione agreed as she set down the parchment she’d been fussing with and came to join Harry on her couch. No doubt she was already throwing herself back into work after her long weekend away. “And ethical! You know the hens are free range when you can actually see them walking around the grounds. They have their own cows, geese, and pigs as well, and they are all well treated as far as I can tell. There was an extensive vegetable garden, too. I’ve told Neville to visit if he can get a reservation. I think they must be using cultivating charms that would interest him.”
Even those who were not charmed by Draco's words were enchanted by his dancing. His back was straight and rigid, while his long limbs stepped and glided with perfect grace. Harry was so entranced by the dip and slid of Draco's body, he didn't notice Ron and Hermione come to his side until Hermione spoke.
Harry rushed forward to press Draco against the door as he kissed him hard and deep. Draco let him in, and Harry’s tongue was enveloped in the sweet, wet heat of Draco’s mouth. Draco wanted to see him again. Draco wanted to show up at a party of their friends as couple! He would have liked to kiss Draco forever, but he needed to accept the offer. "I’d like nothing more," he whispered against Draco’s wet lips.
Harry couldn’t have suppressed his smile if he’d tried. All thoughts of the war vanished as he imagined Malfoy feeding birds and squirrels like a Muggle child at the park. Warmth flooded his chest, and he resisted the urge to hug Malfoy and pinch his cheeks.
Harry's eyes softened as they met Draco's. "You've been all but dead for days. You need a Healer and something to eat and drink."
Harry closed his eyes and let Draco's voice wash over him. The Muggle crossword had been completed and the
The sun was trying valiantly to fight through the clouds, but it was still grey and misty. Harry didn’t care. So long as there wasn’t lightning coming down from the sky, he was taking Teddy to the park. The night before had been maddening with Teddy climbing the furniture and refusing to go to bed. The boy needed a long run around and some fresh air to get him back to his usual sweet self. Harry hoped Andromeda was enjoying her weekend off because she had looked exhausted when she’d dropped Teddy off Friday night. And that was with Teddy at school much of the day.
"Coffee? Port?" Harry was sure there was some beverage that would get Draco to stay a little longer. He didn’t care if they didn’t have sex. Well, he did care, but he cared more that Draco be in the same room as him for as long as possible.
They often had lunch together, sometimes alone and sometimes with one of Harry's Gryffindor friends.  Draco discovered that he could share a meal with Weasley and Longbottom, so long as they discussed illegal potions cases and little else.  He assumed that was why Harry invited him along in the first place.
Harry shrugged. “You can put a mark on anyone. My godson has put on my Auror robes. It doesn’t make him an Auror.”
needed his own words to write about him. Draco supposed Potter could relate to that, too. He met Potter’s eye and raised his glass of wine. Potter seemed to understand the silent toast and clinked their glasses with a wry smile.
A man’s voice on the other end was rich and familiar. Draco was so distracted by it that he missed most of what was said. Not that he needed to hear more than the word “reservation.” Draco was honestly just grateful for the dignity of cancelling instead of just not showing up like the family who never arrived on Friday.
Weaving his way out into a darkened corridor, he ventured down it a ways. He passed several couples and a few small clusters of other guests on his way, searching out the sound of silence.
“Evening,” he muttered roughly, rubbing the jean-clad stiffness of his cock on Draco’s very naked arse.
“Oh, right—" Harry immediately started rummaging through the tent bag. “Er—a few things. I brought a paper bag, there’s an old teacup, shoebox…but I thought we might try this first.”
“Er, also, I had hoped you might have an idea what sorts of things we might need to get started. I know for sure some sort of first aid, other emergency type things, er, towels, extra supplies and that sort of thing. I can get whatever it is, I’ll just need a little guidance on what I’m getting.”
Weasley rolled his eyes and walked off without a departing word.  Draco had thought he might intervene or attempt to “protect” Potter from the evil Death Eater, but instead he seemed unsurprised by a turn in conversation that sounded suspiciously like Potter asking Draco on a date.  Was that what just happened?
"If Potter is there, I'll forget it ever happened. Not that I am ready to sit at your kitchen table again. Please tell me this party won't involve your kitchen table."
Draco raised a pale forearm. His right one, Harry noted. “This complexion goes straight from white to pink to red, Potter. There is no such thing as a tan Malfoy. And trust me, the pink isn’t cute and the red is atrocious. Sun Protection Charms are as much part of my morning ritual as cleaning my teeth and putting on socks.” Having made his point, he dropped his hand back to his pint.
Harry thought back on his training once more. His instructor encouraged reference to a greater authority, and Harry was eager to turn attention away from himself. “The Wizengamot reviewed each member of the Malfoy family and met out the consequences they saw fit after reviewing all the evidence.”
Draco had almost thanked Potter as they stood staring at each other in the courtroom. There were people moving and talking all around them, but Draco had seen no one but Potter. He wanted to speak, but his mouth was dry and his head was muddled. In the end, he just gave a nod before the Aurors dragged him out the doors to the long hallway beyond.  He had thought Potter called something after him, but the words were swallowed by the crowd.
When Draco awoke, Potter was staring at him. They both stayed frozen in their beds staring across the space between them with closed expressions. Was Potter going to thank him? Would they have to talk or could they go back to ignoring each other? Whatever was going to happen, Draco wanted it over with before the awkwardness could grow.
"What?" Draco was becoming more and more confused with each passing moment. Had Hermione had a few too many at the Leaky? What did this have to do with Harry?
Harry schooled his face as blank as he could, but he couldn’t help noticing Draco’s argument against freeing elves had rested on his elf’s feelings. Draco could act as callous as he liked, but Harry could tell he cared.
Best to move on to lubrication, then. He hoped Potter had some, because he certainly hadn't thought to bring any. When asked, Potter crawled up to his nightstand and pulled out a tube. Draco squeezed a huge amount onto his hand and it slipped through his fingers and down his arm onto Potter's rug. Shit. He quickly rubbed some of it onto himself to stop the dripping. Potter had moved back into his position at the end of the bed with his arse displayed for Draco's benefit, so Draco pressed one slick finger between the globes of Potter's arse and began to push in. Potter tightened immediately.
Potter's arm around his waist loosened. "Are you just making me squirm? Because I can't imagine you're racking your brain for a gentle way to decline."
Draco shook his head, his eyes still watching Harry. “She and Daphne transferred to Durmstrang. They have been living and working in Rome for a couple of years, but they are considering moving back.” He sat very still, his usual ease missing from his posture.
Harry gave a confused face to show that he—raised by Muggles—needed more information.  “It's a village like Hogsmeade and it's near Loch nam Fear.  It's far north, so it's got to be cold there.  And didn't Malfoy say one ingredient grows near Highland lakes?”  Ron was almost bouncing in his seat and his excitement was certainly contagious.  “Harry!  We might actually crack this one!”
He ran his hand through Draco’s hair and was rewarded with a lifted head and a sleepy smile. A knot Harry hadn’t noticed before suddenly loosened in his chest. No awkwardness or regrets. He smiled back.
When he wondered what future he could ever make for himself in Britain, she'd offered her home to him. He could open a hotel to showcase his baking to the wizarding world, she'd said, even if
“Okello doesn’t like wandwork,” Draco whispered as he moved his chair even closer to Harry’s.  “If it can’t be cast wandlessly, he’s not interested.”
"You could shag someone else so that you'd have actual sexual experience when you—you know what? Nevermind. Forget I said anything."
Harry had handed Draco off to Hermione without any sign of suspicion. Draco had grumbled a token amount about working on a Saturday, but by the time he'd put on his travelling cloak, he'd already been nattering away about the possible effects of quotas on hiring practices. Hermione had just winked at Harry behind Draco's back, and then they'd Apparated away.
involved quite a lot of squabbling and name-calling.  It didn’t really seem like the basis of a romantic relationship.  Then again, he thought back to the fighting between Ron and Hermione in sixth-year.  And hadn’t Harry seen a memory of his mother yelling at his father, calling him names, and saying she’d never date him?  Maybe there was hope for Harry and Draco yet.
“I’ll go.  To Christmas.”  Draco looked up from his book with an arched brow.  “That is, if you want me to.”  Harry tried to remember whether Draco had expressed any preference over breakfast.  “Do you?”
“I've come to make sure you don't mess the flat up the first night.” Harry bit down on his tongue before he could make a joke about Malfoy coming. Clearly, he was tired and in need of rest.
When Shacklebolt and his minions had finished waxing poetic, Potter dragged Draco toward a cluster of tables and tents. They threw rings over bottles and small balls at jugs. They drank a sweet juice made of apple and elderflower that tasted like summer and nibbled on baked goods that were surprisingly good for having been made without magic.
point that summer. However, according to Pansy, the famous snog was the extent of the Macmillan/Potter relationship and the entirety of Potter's sex life since the Weaslette in sixth-year.
He leant forward and pressed his lips to Draco's. A catcall sounded from across the room, but Harry ignored everything but the feel of Draco's lips pressing back against his and the dig of fingertips against his hip.
He felt his skin flush and his hands felt a little shaky. He hoped he was half as talented as Draco clearly was.
A crash from the next room disrupted his thoughts and he held his breath until he heard the muffled shout from Scorpius that he was okay. Draco would repair the damage to the room later. Thunder-showers had kept Scorpius inside all day, and the boy was growing stir-crazy. If he didn’t get outside soon, he would be breaking bones instead of vases, and Draco couldn’t risk that. He glanced at the grey, wet world outside and hoped that he would be able to take his son out in the morning. Luna had told him about a wizarding playground near her house that was almost always empty. He knew that Scorpius needed to make more friends his age, but Draco still worried that Scorpius would meet a child raised to hate the Malfoy name who would take a family’s worth of anger out on Draco’s unsuspecting son. An empty playground would be better than one filled with enemies.
He'd pined for Draco last Christmas because he'd had no idea the other man might have any interest in him.  There was no way he would repeat that fate when he and Draco all but lived together.
Everyone seemed to take the cue to disperse: Merryn rushed after Aida as Kensa said she owed her brother an apology as well. Harry found himself almost alone with Draco as Rosamund worked quietly on the other side of the kitchen as though pretending not to exist.
“Yes.  That was the result of the conversation.  And here I thought you were actually paying attention.”  The sarcasm did nothing to lessen the ridiculous grin that Harry felt stretch across his face.  He had a date with Draco!  He lunged forward and pressed his lips to Draco’s, eagerly pushing forward with his tongue until Draco relented and let him in.  They stood against the wall kissing deeply, holding each other tightly, taking their time.  They had all night to make it to Draco’s bed.
Draco was standing straight and looking completely composed. 'I have a great party, good food, drink, friends.' He ticked each item off on his long, pale fingers as if discussing a Ministry matter with a colleague. 'All that's missing is my present.'
Patil was rather a clever witch and caught on immediately. “We will be fine,” she announced as she took Abbott’s side and wrapped an arm around her. Draco knew his friend Nott was rather taken with the sensible Patil sister, and he was finally understanding why.
Draco went straight to bed that first night. He even skipped his usual evening ablutions so he could stay locked away in the privacy of the attic. The room was hideously decorate with the garish orange of the British league's
Well he wasn’t going to spend the rest of the week moping around his flat waiting for Charlie and Pavel to have time to train him or for Draco to come crawling back from his vacation.  Harry went to his room and dug out Hermione's mobile number from his trunk.  He pulled on his boots and headed out to see if Jens could point him in the direction of the nearest Muggle village.
"Night, Potter." He flicked his wand at the nearest lamp and it went out. There was a shuffle and a mutter, and then the other lamp went out. Draco laid in the darkness listening to the slight rustles from the other bed. He hoped sleep would come quickly and save him from the awkwardness.
He climbed from bed and saw he'd been left to sleep in his now-wrinkled shirt and trousers. Wondering what had happened to him, Draco went to find answers.
A ripple of excitement ran down Harry's spine and spread into his stomach.  "Only if you join Luna and me for dinner."
"So you’re not married?" The timing might not be great, but Harry had to know. He was so confused, and there was a dangerous hope bubbling up in his chest. The hope brought with it the possibility that he would soon be very angry with himself for jumping to conclusions without the full story.
Draco’s smug grin was back, and Harry realised he would do anything to keep it there. “You ask someone who worked with it for years before it became illegal.” He gathered his file and gave a little salute. “Until tomorrow.”
Hadn't someone taught the man how to buy clothing by now? Draco had learned a fair amount about Muggle clothing in the last couple of years—flipping through a Muggle magazine at work was a surprisingly pleasant way to appear pro-Muggle—and he knew that t-shirts could look much better than Potter's. His looked like it had been bought for a fat man ten years ago, and it completely hid the form of his upper body.
Harry blinked against the morning light pouring in the windows.  Not only was Draco’s room bigger, it had more windows, and Harry found it impossible to sleep in with so much light.  He had suggested they use the curtains, but Draco had refused.  Draco said that he liked to fall asleep to the starry sky at night and wake with the sun in the morning.  Harry glanced over at his boyfriend’s still form bathed in sunlight up to his neck.  His head was hidden under a pillow.
At one point they ran into Weasley and Granger, and Draco wondered if it was Granger's turn to Hex him for all past wrongs. Instead she just gave him a wry smile and said she'd heard they'd had a boy's night at the Leaky. From Weasley's snort of laughter, there could be no doubt she knew about the Stinging Hex.
Shit! He couldn’t call out for him and his own Charm was so strong that he couldn’t see Draco in the darkness. Harry glanced at the sky and saw the moon was hidden behind a dark cloud.
Draco set the letter aside and began eating again with far more attention than toast really warranted.  “She wants to know if you’re coming to Christmas.”  It had been whispered to a fried tomato, but Harry heard it none the less.
His mother wrinkled her nose, and Draco looked to see what Aida had made for the evening. It appeared to be rice and fish in a tomato sauce. Certainly nothing objectionable, but his mother had never been fond of trying new things and that trait had become much stronger in recent years.
Harry glanced ahead to where Luna was walking with Pavel.  “It’s not too late to change that.”  He quickened his steps and couldn’t hide his smile when he felt Draco increase his own stride to stay by his side.  Harry positioned himself between Draco and Luna just as Pavel was mentioning the Opaleye they’d gotten from their sister reserve in New Zealand.
So it was more than a little odd to be enveloped in the broad chest and warm arms of Harry Potter. Draco was very slightly taller, and Potter's head seemed to rest easily on his shoulder. Potter's hands, as energetic as the rest of him, moved up and down his back in comforting loops of warm pressure. It all felt rather . . . nice.
But that was going to change.  Harry forewent his usual drinks with dinner, determined to keep his wits about him when they made it home.  The rush of lust that Draco always inspired in him was distraction enough from coherent thought.  Draco must have noticed Harry’s abstinence because he repeatedly offered him drink.
His eyes drifted back to Draco and their eyes met. Draco arched a brow at Harry's obvious mirth, and Harry just smiled at him and lifted his pint in salute. Draco would be pleased that Harry was enjoying himself. He always seemed baffled by how much Harry disliked these events. If Draco had his way, they would attend a ball every week.
Draco had always known Potter was slow on the uptake, but he apparently had no understanding of simple commands like,
He carefully removed himself from bed without disturbing Potter and walked to the mirror over the sink. His eyes were red-rimmed and shadowed in pale purple. His face was very pale while his nose, cheeks, and lips were flushed.
They lay panting and staring at the ceiling. He was warm, relaxed, and happy. It was a great feeling. Harry could get used to regular sex and Draco in his bed.
Harry glanced at Draco, but George waived him off with assurances that Draco would be fine. Harry finally nodded, slowly gathering his things and saying goodbye to Draco with such intensity that Draco felt its touch on his skin.
Harry was nervous about visiting Luna, but it was long overdue.  She had attended his house warming party, his Christmas party, and been over for dinner several times, yet he had never even
Only some of that time was spent with Potter convincing him to borrow some Muggle clothes for the day. Draco wouldn't admit it, but the jeans looked rather good on his long legs and firm arse.
“Kreacher brought sandwiches. I figured you might be sick of soup.” He gave a little smile. A private kind of smile, like one would share with a friend over a secret joke.
. The reminder that Harry now lived with him just made Draco smile more. It must have been a soppy smile because Merryn rolled her eyes and headed back into the house.  “You’re letting the heat out,” she shouted back at them.
"She's picking the vegetables now." Malfoy lifted his glass to gesture across the yard to where a pale head of hair could be seen bent over dark plants. "Luna.  When she said she was 'behind on dinner', what she meant was she hadn't started."
Draco ascended the stairs past the landing for Great Aunt Gwenna’s rooms and the next landing for his own until he reached the top floor of the wing. The rooms were spacious with high ceilings, but they made Draco feel smothered. Every curtain was drawn as if his mother could keep out the world beyond. Every bit of wall space was covered in portraits and other art from Malfoy Manor, and the rooms were tightly furnished with every piece his mother had refused to leave behind in a home she refused to return to.
Only the couples remained, and a group of them congregated on the dance floor. As the man's voice began to sing, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and rested his head on his shoulder.
Potter did a little snort-laugh, and it was actually rather cute.  Not at all like Pansy's.  “No, no.  We were following a suspect.  The information you gave us about Euphora and Scotland, it was pure gold.  We had a suspect right away, and then he led us to the lab and his associates.”
“Thinking what to buy me?”  Draco was smiling with the materialistic glee of a small child, and Harry fought not to laugh.  Draco could be so sophisticated and mature one moment, only to regress to childishness when promised a present or denied a treat.
Blaise bristled. "She doesn't have time to cook! Her training schedule with the Harpies is brutal. And … and—!"
Pomfrey gave her a sad smile. “A Healer is of little use anyway. The potions will help with comfort, but there is little that can be done but to let the illness run its course. Miss Abbott will be fine. As will you if you catch it. And house-elves will be bringing meals and checking on you throughout the day.” Part of the joy of house-elves was their immunity to wizarding diseases.
Draco looked over the paper and then threw it to Harry as he dug change out of Harry’s coin bowl for the owl. “We’re in it.”
He hadn’t thought to grab any clothing on the way in, but at least he had large covering towels to wear out.
Objectively, he didn’t see why Toby was sought out when he wasn’t. They were of similar look and build, with dark hair, bright eyes, and lean muscle. Harry doubted that Toby’s blue eyes and tamer hair were the difference.
"You knew I was coming?"  Harry had assumed it was just his usual luck that Draco had stumbled upon him naked in front of his house.
He heard a pop and Potter instructing an elf to change Draco’s bedding. There were mentions of food, too, but Draco just thought about the softness of the sheets and of Potter’s voice. It all felt very safe and comforting, so he slipped back to sleep.
Padma found every opportunity to touch Boot's arm or chest, as Draco looked on happily. No, Draco would not be able to hide his anguish at watching his lover with another man. Draco turned toward Harry and their eyes met. Draco's smile grew wider and he raised his glass of champagne.
No more stories or jokes; no more flattery or careful questions. This was just Draco, swaying to a sweet melody as he rested in Harry's arms.
For once, Potter didn’t blush at all. He just smiled at Draco with tender eyes. "Yeah. Once I gave Pansy a chance and got to know her, she started talking about you all the time. I liked her stories and realised I should give you a chance, too. And, well, I liked talking with you even more than Pansy's stories about you."
Sitting alone at the bar, watching other men strike up conversations and flirt with strangers, Harry had felt ugly and unwanted. It was too much like being back with the Dursleys, and by the time Toby stumbled off the dance floor—looking sweaty and sated—Harry had been desperate to leave.
He waved his hand airily, clearly enjoying listing all the things he knew that Harry didn’t. “There certainly isn’t enough annual sunlight in Scotland. I would think South West England is most likely. Perhaps Wales.” He turned his smug grin on Harry and waved his finger in mock scolding. “And no, you can’t use sunlight spells because the plant destroys the magic.”
Draco raised his eyebrow in a more successful attempt. 'Are you denying that you planned to order the roast beef sandwich that you
It was a quiet three days, during which Draco tried his best to pretend he was entirely alone. Potter seemed to be enjoying the same fantasy.
Harry had been in Romania almost a month and had yet to see a dragon. In fact, he’d yet to leave Bârlog. Charlie had given him books, gear, and lectures, but fell deaf at any mention of Harry leaving the village. To make it all worse, the rest of the team, including Draco, spent long days away from the village working.  Harry found that he almost missed Draco when he was gone.
Heart pounding, he took the final step so that his foot slid between Draco's feet and their shirts brushed.
The woman had raised an eyebrow at Draco's name, prompting Potter to explain that Draco had eccentric parents.  Draco thought that was actually a pretty accurate description.  She seemed appeased and led them to a table in the corner as she rattled off a list of pies.  Apparently Muggles could only eat their meat from within pastry, so Draco chose one with lamb and berries, whilst Potter chose beef with ale.  A tendril of the woman's dark, wild hair had gotten loose, and she tucked it behind her ear as she made her way back to the large oak bar in the next room.
Draco’s hand flew exactly to the tuft of hair sticking up on one side. How did he always know when it was messed up and where? Maybe that was a normal talent that Harry lacked because his hair was
The odd thing about Harry and Parkinson's animosity was that it had vanished for a while. When Draco first moved in two years ago, she had apologised to Harry for wanting to hand him to Voldemort and he had willingly forgiven her. She had been almost friendly and had encouraged Draco and Harry to work out their differences.
It was Draco's job to figure out what that potion was, how it was made, and how Potter and Weasley could find the potioneers responsible.  It was a mystery for which he, with his understanding of brewing and hiding illegal activity, was uniquely suited.  It was everything he had wanted to do for the past three years.
Draco smiled in what he hoped was a friendly-but-not-leering way. "We grew our own vegetables at the Manor." Well, the elves did, but Draco wasn't going to mention that at a party Granger was probably attending. "So I really don't know about market quality. But these are better than anything I had at home." Pansy and Longbottom really were amazing with plants. It was the shared passion that had brought them together in the first place.
Potter’s fever broke mid afternoon and he fell into a deep sleep. Draco worried more than once that Potter had died on his watch—and he was sure that would violate his probation—but when he got close he saw the gentle rise and fall of Potter’s chest.
Merryn stepped forward. “Which is why the hiding had to stop.” She looked from Draco to her mother. “I gave an interview to Gabby Yarn before she left this morning. I’ve told her I’m a Squib and how Draco’s helped me work here. If people want to come out here to off me for having no magic, they had better book a room and dinner first. At least then we get the business.”
What use is his mind in the endless tedium? Each day passes the same: three meals and a disinfecting charm to reduce the spread of disease but that never lets him
'Pedant,' Harry shot back. Draco raised a brow. 'Yes, I know what it means,' Harry snapped in mock indignation.
Potter's leg was surprisingly strong and sturdy, reminding Draco that Potter hadn't been a weedy pre-pubescent boy in many years. Potter's hands were definitely not a boy's hands: broad, with long, muscular fingers. Draco wished he'd worn thicker trousers as he felt the heat of Potter's leg against his own.
He eagerly opened his mouth and wrapped it around Draco's cock. It was hot and rested heavily against his tongue, filling his mouth and stretching his lips. Draco's hands threaded into his hair and tugged at him almost painfully. His cock twitched at the discomfort, and he decided that he definitely had a kinky side to discover.
Harry was exhausted. He’d taken an early morning Portkey to Salzburg with two apothecary interns hoping to collect edelweiss from the Austrian mountains. From there, he had taken the Floo to Vienna alone. He’d sat with his spinning head in his hands until he’d had to catch a second Portkey to Budapest and a third to Oradea, just over the Romanian border. He had just stepped out of the Floo in the city of Sibiu, the closest city to the dragon reserve with a wizarding presence.
in all those years of Astronomy?”  Harry wondered if there was some prediction in the stars about pointy gits working well with over-sized lizards.  He remembered Firenze and the other centaurs going on and on about Mars being bright, and figured it was possible.  Ron didn’t seem to be thinking about it all, having returned to dunking a butter biscuit in his tea.
A dull plunk was followed by Potter's hands grabbing him firmly around the waist. Pansy would not be impressed that Potter had just dropped one of her crystal wineglasses into a vegetable bed, but Draco could not care less so long as Potter kept digging his fingertips into his hips as if terrified Draco might slip away.
Even the public had been supportive—though largely due to Hermione's meeting with Rita Skeeter in which Hermione suggested Skeeter write the story as a sweet romance if she didn't want an Auror investigation into her being an unregistered Animagus.  The article published the following day had told a melodramatic story of star-crossed lovers finally united that the public had greedily devoured before begging for more.
