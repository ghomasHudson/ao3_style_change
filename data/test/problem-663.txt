draco sighed, realizing that he was probably,
“don’t you dare speak to him,” draco snapped, sending a slight stinging hex at vernon. he howled as if he had been
“potter,” draco breathes, looking down at his shoes. “you... you smell like broom polish, and springtime, and warmth, and you taste of peppermint, and -” he tapers off, sighing heavily. he runs and hand through his hair and admonishes himself for not practicing a speech during the time he had sat here worrying.
“mmm,” harry groaned. he pulled draco towards him, wrapping an arm around his waist and hugging him close - his back pressed to harry’s front. “talk to me.”
he looks down - from this angle, he really does look very much like draco - so much so that it’s easy to believe for a moment that harry’s at home, in his own bed, getting ready to kiss draco goodnight. every feature is nearly identical, save for the eyes. they gleam silver with hatred and evil, things draco hasn’t possessed in years.
draco pouts in response for a moment, before turning to harry with a devious grin. “not even if i ask politely?” he blinks at harry, wide eyed and innocent - although his hand trails over his thigh and towards his crotch.
harry pulls out after a few long moments, his chest heaving as he attempts to catch his breath. beneath him, draco still pants softly, a thin sheen of sweat visible on his forehead. beneath his legs, draco’s cock was already hardening once more. reaching down, harry cupped draco’s balls in his palm, rolling them gently and savoring the way draco’s eyes rolled back into his head.
as he climbs the stairs, anticipation builds steadily in the pit of draco’s stomach. he finds himself hoping that harry is asleep in their bed, tired from a day of shoveling hippogriff dung, or whatever it was he did at hogwarts. draco would silently kick off his shoes and slide in bed behind him, not even caring that he was wearing his day clothes in bed. he would wrap his arms around harry and kiss his shoulder and neck until he woke fully. he would straddle him and lean close, pressing their foreheads together - he would say quietly, “guess what?” and harry would ask, his voice still thick and his eyes still creased with sleep, “what?”, and he would tell him, and harry would grin and  -
“you know, i’ve been having a lot of fun hanging out with you, draco,”
“we can talk more about that later,” draco says quickly. “for now let’s just,” he pulls harry back down into the bed, their lips only a hair’s breadth away. “do this instead…”
and another sign underneath that read “
,” he practically screamed, the word tearing its way out of his mouth as if it were actually painful. a chill ran through harry’s body, magnified by the force of draco’s cries, as he sobbed for his mother again and again, to no avail. “my mum - she…”
when draco wakes again, several hours later, the sun had risen completely and peaks through the sheer curtains in their room. he looks over at the empty side of the bed, wishing for a moment that harry hadn’t been called away. their morning routines were dear to draco, what with the way that they moved around and with each other in a practiced dance, a testament to their time together and the level of familiarity they had achieved. he allows himself only a moment of longing before kicking the sheets from his body and clambering from the bed, yawning and stretching and mentally going over all he would have to do for the day.
he looks up as he hears harry come in, his eyes just as damp as they had been a few moments ago. he still looks the same, not fundamentally altered in any way, as if he hadn’t just been orphaned at the hands of his partner.
“she loves roses,” he bites out, looking down. his voice trembles as he speaks. “she’s always loved roses.
harry was standing at the head of the table, head down and bracing himself on the edge and speaking in a low voice. his eyes were closed, and he looked, frankly, worse for wear. his partner, a woman named thalia, stood beside him, also speaking to what seemed to be a large majority of the auror department.
he spread draco apart, drinking in the sight of his tight, furled hole - small, pink, and perfect. even now, after almost three years of dating, harry still wasn’t sure if or how draco kept himself so pristine - he had never once mentioned a shaving charm, yet his arse remained unblemished and perfect.
he pockets the bag without a second glance and leaves the room, his stomach churning.
“what?”
“draco?” he calls, and then his footsteps are coming down the hall, the steps that draco has memorized, and then he’s frozen, and shaking, and about to sick up everywhere, and he doesn’t know what to do - and then hermione is shoving him through the floo with a choked sob.
at the base of the stairs, pansy, as well as three other aurors from harry’s larger, usual group of bodyguards stood at attention, their arms crossed behind their backs and their faces set into identical, stoic lines.
“oh no, i still want to hear everything you were going to say,” draco grins, pressing his forehead to harry’s. “just wanted to make it clear that my answer is yes.”
,” draco sneered, coming to a stop before vernon. he pushed his wand into vernon’s meaty and bent down just a bit, close enough so that vernon could clearly see the hatred in his eyes. “for the cupboard… the starvation… the beatings… the emotional neglect… he’s told me about all of it. have you any regret?”
once draco trusted himself enough not to run screaming, he climbed back into bed - opposite harry, and turned on his side, staring unseeingly at the wall. his mind raced as his dream replayed, over and over again. the way harry’s hands had roamed his body had been eerily realistic, and practically mirrored the movements he had used on draco countless times.
and then he was gone, rushing down the stairs and through the floo, while draco readjusted in bed and pulled harry’s still-warm pillow to his face. draco’s sleep-addled brain made it easy to not think about where harry was going, or worry about the possibility of danger for very long.  he fell asleep quickly, lulled back into unconsciousness by the comfortable and welcoming warmth of the duvet.
wrapping his arms around harry’s neck, draco quickly found a rhythm that worked for both him and harry. he rode harry’s cock slowly, picking up his weight before grinding down on harry with a slight circular motion to his hips. beneath him, harry’s eyes were screwed shut in pleasure, his mouth hanging open obscenely.
“if you make a sound, i’ll leave you dead in your driveway,” he sneers. “now what you’re going to do is walk very carefully, and very quietly out of this door, and into the car. you will get in the backseat, and you will be very silent. do you understand me?”
“malfoy,” harry says softly. he doesn’t sound angry. he sounds sad, exhausted. everything that draco feels. yet, somehow, it isn’t bringing him to his knees. he's still able to hold draco upright while his entire world falls in around him.
even now, years later, the cottage remained a light at the end of the tunnel. they referenced it constantly, always adding details and expanding the dream. they had picked paint swatches and rugs and lamps and all sorts of tiny details, slowly making everything seem more real as time went on. and then, suddenly, it had been real. on christmas, two years ago, draco had gifted harry a key, which he had later discovered unlocked the door to a spacious, homely cottage all the way out in oxford. slowly but surely, they had begun renovating and decorating the home - it would be finished sometime in the next four years. then, it would sit empty, waiting for the way that harry finally stepped down from minister.
“what color were they?” draco asked, reaching across the table and grabbing harry’s long abandoned drink. he took a deep pull, savoring the fruity taste.
“is this true, draco?” she catches his eye, her own brown eyes wild and damp. her lips trembles and her hand, still in draco’s, shakes.
draco pauses for a moment, stricken.
when he called ron and hermione to tell them he wasn’t coming back to england, they had hummed good naturedly and told him that it was probably for the best.
“yes, i know,” draco smiled gently, rolling his eyes at harry. “i’m the one who told you that, you berk.”
finally, harry dismounts and walks towards their ensuite on shaky legs. there, he wets a towel and brings it back to their bedroom. he sits beside draco as he wipes away all remnants of their time - making sure to be extra gentle as he cleans his lover. draco lies still and allows himself to be cleaned, his eyes soft and following harry’s movements the entire time.
“indeed,” draco sneers moving forward. “get out of bed, now. and stay silent.”
draco dialed on one of the only numbers he knew by heart, putting the phone to his ear and pulling his knees to his chest.
and so he sat, his head resting on pansy’s shoulder, staring at the clock and waiting for harry to come home and decide that he had had enough of draco. on the other side of the sofa, goyle sat stiffly, seemingly flipping through one of harry’s quidditch magazines, although he hadn’t moved from the second page in about ten minutes. theo had disappeared back upstairs, and blaise had retreated into the kitchen in search of snacks.
he can’t believe that he’s doing this, hurting harry this way. he doesn’t think that he’s ever wanted to hex himself more than right now, as he watched harry’s shoulders knit together with tension, and his hands slowly ball into fists at his sides. more than anything, draco wished he had just brushed aside the stupid, fucking dream.
“Trainee Forrester. Let’s say we are out of blood replenishing potions. Name me three treatments that we can use for the patient with this chart.” Healer Cummins gave a chart to a mousy brunette Draco vaguely recognized from first year Anatomy.
Exactly what was Draco Malfoy up to?
“No.” Draco finally looked up at him with those piercing eyes.
“Did you make the cake yourself?” Draco asked. Some of the piping was a bit crooked and it didn’t seem like house-elf work.
He apparated a few minutes walking from Grimmauld. He expected it to have changed. Aside from a thick layer of dust that made him sneeze, it was much the same. He had cleaned it out after the War so at least there were no troll leg umbrella stands and delicate serpent fixtures, no mounted elf heads or screeching portraits of his godfather’s mother (while the Elder Wand probably should not have been used for her removal, it was remarkably effective where several Cursebreakers had not been).
It starts to pour rain in thick sheets, and there’s good-natured laughing as people dash indoors from the terrace. Now the party actually is too crowded, and people make their way home.
They had only ever kissed twice.
There had been incredibly close calls and people had been hurt but no one had died yet. Why had no one died yet? Why did they keep finding all these Dark objects?
“I’m doing this because we’re
There was even a record player where Patience played some jazz music over dinner.
“Twenty-one. Of course it would be twenty-one runes. Let’s switch places,” Draco said.
“Oh alright. I’m being an awful lunch guest,” Harry said. He tore his gaze away.
“This is why,” Draco whispered, leaning back. His eyes were darting all over Harry’s face. “If you must know. This is why.”
“No. But it always feels the same,” He responded.
“You know, I was crazy about you. Absolutely crazy about you. I wanted you. If I had been a romantic, I would have stayed.” Something in Harry has been waiting years to hear that. Believing the whole affair had been one-sided hurt much worse than hearing it hadn't, even if Draco still hadn't stayed.
Theo paused in the middle of his bowl of mapo tofu.
“I want,” Draco said, fumbling with Harry’s shirt buttons and still pressing searing kisses to his mouth.
“Imagine,” Harry cajoles. “You could sit there and read in the nook, and I could cook a proper breakfast with dishes that are clean. And we can buy you terrible squishy couches.”
“Do you live here? What do you do?” Harry asks when they both have their drinks.
“There was nothing wrong with your old nose, Pansy,” Theo said. He sounded like this had been the subject of many conversations Draco did not want to join.
Harry should have firecalled. But he was getting so consumed with work nowadays.
“It’s either me, you or a seventy-four year old witch named Geraldine from Lancashire as far as perfect travellers,” Draco said. His joking tone was probably to set Harry at ease but it had the opposite effect. Draco read Harry’s expression when he came back into their bedroom.
The next day when Harry arrives in their office, Draco says, "I can't be your partner anymore."
"I'll be fine," Draco said shortly. He can feel Harry looking after him. He goes home.
“Let’s talk,” Harry said.
“Hilltowne, Pellack.” Harry nodded. They nodded back.
When Harry jolted into the next universe, Draco was kissing him.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Harry said evenly. “And you’re alright?”
"I just can't imagine, like, ever trying all of that again with someone other than Ginny," Harry confessed. “Like, I can’t imagine even kissing someone else at this point.” Then in their kitchen, Draco had leaned in and kissed him, soft and slow and before Harry's brain could catch up, it was over.
Harry couldn’t think of what to say to them about the situation so he opened his mouth and said, “I think the crib will be done by next week. Sorry.”
“What do you want me to say to that?” he asked Draco. Hermione was at another table greeting someone.
“Or else I have to figure out how to charge you and get the incompetent fuckers in the Auror department involved. Sorry Harry,” Hermione added as an afterthought.
They fell into an intimacy that felt so natural Harry didn’t want to question it. Draco brushed a smear of toothpaste off Harry’s face, napped on his shoulder and put his cold feet in Harry’s lap while he read dusty tomes from the library.
A black hood was placed over his head as they arrived with a drawstring a touch too tight around his neck. He saw a flash of spring leaves, rolling hills, and a few sheep dotted on the horizon. It was colder too. So they must be North somewhere. An international portkey was unlikely.
This was not his universe. This affable, smiling Draco was not the one he was searching for.
A month of investigation and they still couldn’t figure out how they were using Dark objects to make bombs. There had been a few more incidents, mostly copycats who had gone for smaller targets like the Muggle section of Flourish & Blotts. People were starting to get very worried. Minister Steel seemed near sacking them all to have something to show to the public.
“I need you to get me a mirror,” Draco said.
Draco definitely hates Harry’s, with its fine coat of perpetual dust and its air of gloom and genteel neglect. But at Grimmauld there’s never been an American sorority girl named Juniper who gives them a detailed re-enactment of a mooning protest she’d done at Salem during an episode of Corrie Street. Last week Harry banged his head off a shelf in Draco’s room trying to keep quiet during sex while Luna held a seance in the front room next door. Millicent experiments in the kitchen and has never washed a single dish. Blaise appears immune to it all and seems to always be home. Harry might not live there, but he’s had enough.
“What were your Patronuses?”
Harry got to Grimmauld, showered, and ate an apple (and a sleeve of biscuits). He fell asleep before he even got into bed and slept face down on top of his duvet before jerking awake.
In every other universe, something let him know something had changed before. Sometimes it was a matter of a setting or even his career choice. But no, the War had happened here. Harry could tell Draco still had the faint remnants of a Dark Mark on his forearm because he compulsively pulled his sleeves down over his left forearm, though the weather was warm out.
“I want it to be,” Draco said. “It’s not that simple.”
“You’ve ruined the joke. This is where you say ‘but I don’t pay you anything’,” Draco said.
His mother made coq au vin for dinner that night, bought him three sets of new trainee robes and gave him a key to a Gringotts vault. He looked at his mother quizzically.
Many of his classmates went for placement in Azkaban, people who had raised their hands in lectures and talked about patient advocacy and prison conditions. Draco had never really understood how people could feel unfairness that deeply for anyone who had been the worst of wizarding society, himself included.
“I like it,” Harry says.
“Hello,” Draco said, though Harry should have greeted him first.
Instead, they spend a long half hour in the stacks kissing. Harry lets the feeling of the shelf digging into his back ground him as he relaxes into Draco. This doesn't burn hot enough to require more. In fact, the bond is a steady calmness that soothes as Draco demands long, hot kisses from Harry and he gives them up too eagerly to have anything to do with a curse. He wants this more than he's ever wanted anything.
“Let me,” And Harry leaned in and cleaned it from Draco’s face too, with a much softer spell.
Zacharias gave him a quiet nod from his workstation. It figured Harry would have to be literally attacked on the job before Smith would give him an ounce of respect. Harry nodded back.
“I’m going to read the reports from last week,” Harry said.
“It’s still gorgeous,” Harry breathed. Only years of training stopped him from running his fingers along the stone walls. The magic here pressed insistently, like a firm hand on his temple.
“Well, you’ll be off then. You’ll visit, won’t you?” Eustace asked as he had gathered the mugs, spare work shirts and personal items he had left in the Forwellstead's on his last day. Draco stood in front of the door.
"But boys, wouldn't you rather be doing something else?"
"We have to go back to the Ministry," Draco says. He is so close that Harry can see the tiny freckle on the left side of his nose.
“All I got was a month in Azkaban and five years with no magic. You on the other hand, are probably headed for two decades in Azkaban. My father died there, you know.”
“You can tell him yourself next week. We love you, Harry. Potter Residence.” his mum disappeared into emerald flames. It took a few moments to clear the tightness in his chest.
“That’s up to you,” Harry said. Harry would give him a single point in all this, which is once Draco understood, all bets were off. Draco firmly grabbed the lapels of Harry’s jacket and pulled him closer. Draco’s slate-grey eyes were boring into Harry’s.
What had
He lifted a brow at the blond in confusion. “A proper death-eater?” The malice laced in it was downright infuriating and he could’ve refuted, if not for the evident fury on Draco’s face and for once, he would rather not worsen it. “Or the Dark Lord himself, perhaps?” He rasped with a low growl. “Or would you –”
Draco poured water into the kettle, placed it on the stove and opened a cabinet and set out two cups. While he had a particular preference with tea, he was certain that the brunet didn’t.
Draco arched a brow in confusion. He had refrained from a clever, sarcastic comment when he had the perfect chance. Perhaps, it was a right choice to offer him one chance. “Inflated ego –” A beat. “and the Malfoy pride.”
, Malfoy”
A friendship but not really
He was sort of pleased with the familiar comfort of a retort-fest and considering the six years of animosity, the silent confessions and uncensored conversations with Draco Malfoy weren’t well-suited. “You exhaust me.”
Harry gaped at him. A place that doesn’t exist on the globe – And he couldn’t find a way out. He couldn’t ignore the intense throbbing in his head. “Your fucking father – A bastard – He sent me to this absurd place. And now I can’t find a way out?”
"Yes, woman.”
No, it wasn't. It was a fucking nightmare to be turned into a ferret while the others watched with amusement.
It was certainly an improvement.
A pause.
“Right,” He said with a small smile. “yeah, I won’t.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched, and curved into a small smile. Only for a brief moment. Yet, Harry could hear the smile in his voice as he said, “It was plain atrocious, Potter.”
“Quit trying?” Malfoy said, voice rising at the accusation, and he inched closer to the brunet, staring into his eyes with evident anger. “Oh, I’ve tried. Once. Twice. Countless times. And I failed – I. Fucking. Failed.”
Harry frowned. Voldemort didn’t show mercy – He would kill the ones who dared to cross him. Why had he sent Malfoy here?
“I – I can’t recall it,” He said as he inched closer to the blond, his voice wobbly and unsure. “I don’t remember falling in love with you, because you erased the memories.”
right, hi y'all. Or whoever bothers to read this. Anyways, I forgot I have to post on ao3 pls-
“It’s – well, your mother protected you when you were a child.” Malfoy said, focused on the waves, yet glancing at the brunet once or twice. “Patronuses are spirit-guardians – It was fitting – considering, she protected you.”
He dismissed his thoughts. He didn’t want to stress over the questions he didn’t have answers to. And the truth about his father’s actions would be terrifying. He would never be ready for the truth. Never.
“I’m not, you’re just beautiful.” Harry smirked while blowing a kiss, which effectively turned Draco into a blushing mess.
“Good.” He forced out, falling back on his heel, turning his head to the side, eyes fixed on the mantelpiece, while he whispered, “I don’t care about you.”
"Do you have one?"
Malfoy stared at him in confusion.
A tiny, familiar flutter.
“Ice skating,” Harry said, laughing at the horrified expression on his face. “It isn’t that difficult.”
“Er,” Malfoy said, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly. “I can’t crack eggs. Or cook, Potter.”
enemies.”
“You wish,” He didn’t wipe the smirk off his face, in fact it was curled into a pronounced one. An infuriating satisfied-smirk, which was rather familiar to him, “
“Would you like me to continue or are we finished? Oh wait, you fucking asked for a reason, I’ll give you another one – You cursed Katie Bell. It doesn’t suffice? Ron almost died because you spiked the mead.”
“Oh, were you?”
Malfoy caught the snitch and it struggled within the confinement. He half-turned to him with a confused frown and an arched eyebrow. Right on cue. “Why do you have a snitch with you, Potter?”
“Draco...”
“No, I fucking tried enough – I was in Otryazan for six months – away from home and I miss it. I miss it more than anything in the fucking world – so, quit with the accusations.”
He had written it. In 1996. The erased memories. An erased canvas.
“If you refrain from cursing, it’s a deal.”
Perhaps it wasn’t fractured, but the pain was lancing on one side. “It’s not –” The words were cut off when he turned to one side, perching up with a hand placed on the rough bark, rising to his feet. “Oh, fucking –” A sharp pain flared to his side, causing him to wince, “I can’t figure out if it’s fractured or not.”
“Oh, right,” Malfoy’s lower lip had protruded in a petulant pout, “oh, don’t pout, it’s not attractive on you.”
Malfoy's voice was suddenly reverberating through Harry's stunned mind, the statement ricocheting around his skull in clamoring echoes until he was feeling nearly dizzy from the force of it. “Don’t assume that I have no regrets. You don’t fucking know, Potter.”
When the whisper of profanities ceased, he raised his eyes and half-turned with a quip on the tip of his tongue, only to find the brunet asleep with the novel on perched on his chest and the strand of hair falling on his face.
“Pity,” He said with an air of drama, as he nicked a paperback novel from the bedside table, wrinkling his nose as he skimmed through the pages. “I wanted you to shut up.”
"Draco, I want to dance with you tonight," He said with a soft sigh. "the prophet can fuck itself, plus, it'll be factual news for once and I'd rather not focus on it when I can dance with you," A beat. "can we?"
– It’s sort of impressive you saved him.”
More of casting the Patronus
“I want tea, not rest.”
Harry laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco cracked a small, brief smile. Perhaps, he could forgive Harry Potter. Once. It might cause trouble. Yet, he could risk it. Once. “Right, what high praise out of your mouth.”
"Wasn't your proudest moment, was it?"
He couldn’t resist a smile. “I will, if you focus on casting the Patronus – which, by the way, will more likely happen if you keep the cursing to the minimum and casting to the maximum.”
He opened his eyes, with a scream caught in his throat.
Harry turned, a warm smile grazing his lips. He walked over to Draco, and kissed him on the cheek. And it made Draco’s heart flutter in his chest wildly. “Morning, Malfoy”
He had to perfect it, because he didn’t have a fucking wand. And he wasn’t going to be defenseless around Draco Malfoy. Or anyone. He was driven by the idea of perfecting wandless magic.
Harry was lying on the sand, with his eyes closed. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he was drained – Had he conjured a fucking wandless Patronus? It was absurd. To conjure a corporeal Patronus by a wand was a feat. He would’ve applauded himself, only if he wasn’t screaming in pain.
“More,” he whined. So, Draco chuckled and poured a little more chocolate in the cup.
He didn’t want to stare at the canvas. It was almost painful. A reminder that his sky could be beautiful amidst the chaos. Plus, he still hadn’t figured out the reason he had painted Potter’s sky.
Otryazan was not on the list of
"We can," Draco rests his head back on the shoulder, fingers curling around the arm while he murmurs, "it's our secret, isn't it?" He nestles closer. “Plus, we can’t come out to the others, can we?”
“You did all this, do all this, driven by your family and I do it for mine, Potter.”
Would it be safe here? Harry didn’t want to hold on to it, yet he didn’t have a fucking choice. He couldn’t risk losing it. He had to avoid thinking about the fucking watch. Or it would hold a power over him. And he didn’t want a repeat of recent events.
’ - It's a feat to conjure a vaguely corporeal Patronus, Malfoy and we're a few days in -
A flutter which wouldn’t cease.
Malfoy half-turned to face him, with a bit of curiosity. He arched an eyebrow, as if to demand a further elaboration. “Even if it’s a sad ending?”
A pause.
“You don’t care about the references,” He stated as a matter-of-factly. “You’re curious, aren’t you?”
“Well, I dueled with the death eaters,” He said, with a satisfied smirk. “I barely dodged the curses they were sending my way, while I was finding a way out. I was in the east wing. Your father – He dueled with me, and he wasn’t using any unforgivable curses or hexes.”
“You’re fucking welcome.” Malfoy underlined the words with a glare, face reddening with rage at the accusation. “Now, if you’re quite finished with the accusations, we should start with wandless magic.”
His eyes cracked open, as he heard a soft chuckle above him. Malfoy had an amused smirk on his face, and a gleam in his eyes. “Still lurking around, are you?”
“Fucking fantastic.” He received a pointed glare in response to the cursing, which was sort of fair, considering Malfoy wasn’t swearing for once. “I can swear if I want to, considering I’m refraining from the retorts.”
The seashell ascended in the air at a slow, decided pace. He could control the flow. It wasn’t spontaneous. It was calm. Precise. The shell was hovering mid-and and he caught it in his hand and a small smile formed on his face. “It’s – wow.”
“Sprinkling in Muggle references,” Harry said.
The Healers fixed him up fine. No permanent damage to his vision or hearing somehow. Harry looked for Draco but a small mousy Healer Trainee reluctantly told him he wasn't working. After making sure he was stable enough he Apparated home and slept.
“Yes, and yes,” Harry said. Then suddenly, Draco was directly in his space, peering at him, tilting Harry's chin down to his chest. Harry glimpsed his Firebird; still, cool and glowing an assertive pink. If this were his Draco, it would be red. But Draco was close nonetheless. This Draco was pressing his hands gently on both sides on the hinge of his jaw and neck. His hands were cool.
“I don’t sell it in my shop,” Draco said. "Even you could brew your own if you wanted it. Not that you would need to." The last part came out all wrong like Draco had meant it to be a cutting observation about his fame instead of Draco admitting he thought Harry was fit. Harry was pleased.
“Can I check?” Harry nodded and let him scan.
But otherwise, it was still musty, with outdated dark panelled wood, peeling navy blue Rococo wallpaper and elaborate wrought iron sconces. At least the ceilings were high, otherwise, all that darkness would feel like he was drowning. It was late enough in the evening that Harry decided he would start after breakfast. He slept fitfully, but when he awoke, couldn’t recall a single dream.
between them.
His necklace sat hidden but still warm against his chest.
Or maybe a universe of generals and spies and muggle wars with France was up his alley. No matter, Harry didn’t want to be there.
“It’s rare, is all. We’ve tested the entire building, including the Minister, and there’s only three.”
They buy a case of beer with some more confusion over the brightly coloured bills, then apparate to a park and walk up a residential street that could have been anywhere in the world.
He did not like being hunched in cold alleys waiting for nothing to happen for no reason anyone would tell him. He felt conflicted about midnight raids and relying on a split second instinct that often left him to wonder if he hadn’t fulfilled Dumbledore’s dearest wish and become a weapon and not a person.
“Now I know why you’re not supposed to treat people you know,” Draco admitted. Draco was biting the corner of his lip hard. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever been so aware of what someone’s mouth was doing.
What he liked best about Hermione was that she knew so much, but she never hesitated to share. She never made him feel foolish for not knowing something these days.
“You were getting serious,” Ron said. It was a statement and not a question, but Harry nodded. That much was true on his end, no matter how Draco really felt. He should have pressed him.
Draco pulls away. “You’re not allowed to use lines on me, I’m already here,” he says and dives back into their kiss. He moans when Harry gives his hair a gentle tug so that Harry can kiss the side of his neck. Draco shivers but forces their mouths back together. Harry runs hands over his solid shoulders. It’s surreal to be doing this again.
Well, as far as explaining it to a nine-year old, he supposed that was the least complicated way.
“Yes,” Harry says. Harry smiles even though it feels like his heart is about to skip out of his chest.
The excuse is flimsy.
“Happy birthday, Draco,” Harry said. Then Harry reached up and he was kissing Draco carefully, sweetly. Maybe he was reading too much into a single kiss and maybe Harry would regret this tomorrow morning, but it was still Harry nipping at his bottom lip and licking hotly into his mouth.
“We’re wizards, Harry,” Draco scoffed and apparated them both upstairs.They landed directly on Harry’s bed .
Harry wasn't sure whether he had pulled Draco down or not. Either way, Draco was straddling him, wearing most of his work attire and offering little nips along Harry's collarbone. Harry had been sleeping in nothing more than shorts so the imbalance threw him off a little.
“I don’t think that,” Harry protested.
"If you do that I'm going to—"
“I’ve risked everything. What else do you want from me?”
After a year, he took her up on a single potion to try. He wanted to sleep uninterrupted. He wanted to make some progress. He wanted to be a better person, or at least one who wouldn’t have put himself here. But it was difficult to say he wasn’t sure he deserved it.
"The seller said 1750," Harry said.
“Forgive me, I forgot your approach is probably the same for both,” Draco said. “Too fast and without pacing yourself.”
“I think the term is orphans,” Draco said. He knew she mentioned Harry Potter to annoy him, though she didn’t know the details of any of their interactions on his cases. While Draco didn’t mind children he encountered in Paediatrics, he liked treating adults too.
“I’ll miss your work ethic, dear boy. You reminded me how nice it is to run the shop with other people,” Eustace said. Even Eustace was getting a bit misty-eyed.
"Can't believe you're here," Draco says.
“Come on, it’s tradition by now,” Draco encouraged.
“You can take anything you’d like to read home,” Eustace said.
“No. He was...” Draco licked his lips nervously. “He was very much in love with Harry, but hadn’t realized it was reciprocal until it was too late.”
Draco dresses and follows him in a daze.
When he walked out, Draco was sitting in his kitchen reading a book. The wards must have let him in. It was nearly 8 pm now according to his kitchen clock. Harry waited a second, enjoying the curve of his neck and savoring the idea of Draco being in his space. Merlin, he was a good looking man.
He felt bereft, even though Draco still stood in front of him. Then Draco stepped closer to Harry and tilted his chin upwards with two fingers.
“Paedetrics if you’d like to keep on with your shiny new redeemed image,” Pansy continued. “You could go work in that foundling home they named after Saint Potter.”
He didn’t know if this was a universe that had a war at all, even if it was a close one.
Draco emerged from the room, still on his cellphone. Without looking, Draco closed the cover on Harry’s fingers and waved his hand towards the entryway.
"Okay. If that's what you really want," Harry said.
“I think not,” Draco said.
Harry had never been close enough to see the starburst pattern in the grey of his eyes. He found it disconcerting somehow.
“Told you I would be back.”
“You shouldn’t eat so fast. You’ll give yourself digestive problems. ” The Healer in him jumped out before Draco could stop himself, as Harry polished off the last of his goulash.
“Theo, what do you think I should do?” Draco asked.
“Draco, dearest.” And then she broke all of her rules and hauled him to her, though he was taller than her. She took a deep, shaky breath. She was thinner than he remembered, but when was the last time they held each other like this? Probably as he was arrested and before that, the night Voldemort died.
Pansy came by a few days later with Theodore Nott. Draco was a little unsettled. He didn’t know Theo well, but from her letters nowadays Pansy came as a package deal. Draco had been that way with her once, but it had been five years.
He returned to Hogwarts and threw himself into work. He sponsored the Duelling Club, started tryouts early, and tried to fly more often. He cut his hair short. He slept badly. He would fall asleep in the middle of his bed and wake up curled on his side. He had slept alone most of his adult life, and a few weeks had him grasping at empty sheets in the middle of the night.
Then Draco sinks to his knees and Harry is speechless. His head thumps back violently against the wall. His jeans and pants are pushed down roughly and Draco's mouth is on his cock, all at once, with no preamble. He can't watch. It's too much. Because it is clear that Draco has, in fact, done this before. Harry has been trying not to think about it. He thinks Draco might be laughing at him but no one he's dated has ever been so abrupt about it.
“Can I walk there?” Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
He wandered back into the house, with Draco’s arm draped around his waist. He wanted to look at everyone he had lost, gathered together. He knew,
“You’re okay. It’s okay. I'm here,” Draco said over and over.
“Sure. But she started to notice her mum’s reaction and started avoiding me too. I gave her space. Wrote her and got no replies. After she was thirteen I didn’t see her again until career day at Hogwarts. Her professors recommended her in sixth year for Auror training. She refused.”
It was a good year, he thought.
“He made a choice,” Harry said. “I’m making a choice here. My choice is you. For as long as you'll have me.”
Going back to Hogwarts had stirred up a few feelings that he should probably talk to Melinda about next month. He had made three cups of french press coffee and drank it at 6 am. Now closer to mid-morning, he wished his mother had made him eat more than half a scone with jam and an orange as his stomach roiled.
“Owing to the circumstances of these trials, Mr. Malfoy, and mitigated by the fact you were young and under undue influence and a statement submitted by Ms. Granger and Mr. Potter about heroic acts to save lives with significant risk to yourself while under the influence of Voldemort, you are eligible for the pilot diversion program for five years.”
“Can’t it be both?” Harry said from experience. He noted Draco’s use of we. It seemed some things stayed constant. There was no Mark on Draco’s forearm at all. Huh.
“It is utterly devoid of colour," Draco says. He hops up to sit on the marble counter in the kitchen—“one slab of veined marble imported from Italy by the previous owner as a gift to his ex-wife.” Harry goes to him, puts one gentle hand on the sliver of ankle exposed by his trousers. Sometimes it feels ridiculous that after everything, there's them. Draco's been working a lot, and maybe just one stolen kiss is okay. Once he realizes Pansy won’t be back anytime soon, he follows up with a second kiss.
As he shivered under the awning of yet another shop on his way to the local apparition point, he peered into a window to see someone familiar. He could swear it was Draco Malfoy. He watched for a moment to be certain. Malfoy remained tall and willowy, white blond hair pulled back in a bun. If it hadn’t been for the hair, he might have decided it was some other man in chinos and a black t-shirt, chatting with two coworkers. The older man clapped Draco on the shoulder and they both laughed at something.
They had it good before all of this. They worked well together, went out to the pub every once in a while, they knew each other’s friends and families. They were friends, Harry thought.
"Fuck," Draco said.
Harry’s voice was a little more unsteady, a little more shrill than he’d like. His heart started hammering so hard, he could practically hear it in the hushed silence of the room. He could feel it. Both of them said nothing.
Harry patted his pocket and handed it over. With an elegant gesture, he lit his cigarette.
“Your hair is curly when it’s long,” Draco said one day.
Harry did not like the sound of that at all.
But what Draco doesn't have this time is the element of surprise. Harry is the one that apparates them to his flat. Maybe he was competitive or incensed Draco had one over on him.
Harry also did not like Healer Blishwick’s office. For one thing, Harry expected something that looked more like an office. Instead, he was stuck in a replica of a beach house. The window showed a view of the Pacific Ocean. Every few minutes at random, wind chimes played. Even their chairs were a teak frame with a woven white hammock-style seat. The effect must be meant to be relaxing but Harry felt deeply irritated as if someone was trying to trick him.
“Most of it,” Harry admitted. “I didn’t understand why though.”
“I’ll come,” Draco says. No hesitation.
It’s crowded and getting too loud. Harry excuses himself to cut to the balcony on the second floor. He can be social, but he always feels like people can sense he made his first friend at eleven. Even now Harry finds it hard to make acquaintances if people don’t approach him first, especially if it’s not about work. Harry peels the label off his beer for something to do with his hands while he leans on the balcony and looks down the road at the rusty gated park and its blue sign.
“Don’t mistake this for something it’s not,” Andromeda snapped in a low, hurt voice. Instead of cutting through the room the way she came, she exited the door to the garden.
Draco searched his robes for a sheaf of papers. Something that should have been long dead under the circumstances enjoyed just watching Draco reach into a hidden pocket.
“Her father,” Draco supplied for Harry’s context.
Both departments were public facing and the worst possible choice for someone like him as he would rather die (again) than talk to the media or politicians.
“I’ve promised Molly and Andromeda that I’d take care of you like my own,” Narcissa said softly. “So many of your people called to check on me with the situation with Draco. They knew that...” she trailed off.
Draco sat down next to Harry on the sidewalk patio of a coffee shop, though it was too warm out. Somehow what Harry said next caught him unawares.
“I couldn’t tell...I couldn’t tell...” Draco’s voice wavered then died. Draco was taking shallow panicked breaths. Harry moved one hand to his back.
“You were always a riot, D,” Greg said. He didn’t extend the invitation again.
He pointed at the black box in the middle of the parchment with his wand and  the following appeared:
“You don’t have to make me dinner,” Draco protested.
Harry immediately sat and read through. Some sections were blacked out, but it gave him a vague sense of things he had been uncertain about. An unsmiling Draco blinked up at him.
“Are you feeling better?” Harry nodded.
Draco waved and left.
“It was really, really difficult for me to get pregnant. I took all kinds of illegal potions because I wanted a child. He stopped me and said that it didn’t matter to him either way and he didn’t want me to put my own life in danger.”
Harry did not understand why Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt summoned him to the Ministry from his summer cottage a few days after term, but he was certain he wouldn’t like it. It wasn’t for social reasons, as the Aurors who flanked his door proved.
Neville stepped away.
"Mum! I’m twenty-six.”
“How would that differ from being an informant?” Draco asked. Harry fixed him with a sharp look. Draco had forgotten for a moment that Harry was a trained and highly dangerous professional. Draco guessed being questioned by Harry would be seriously unpleasant.
Oliver’s arm was slung around Percy. Percy flushed with happiness, and maybe the liquor too. Oliver kissed Percy on the tip of his nose, which made his face turn even redder, but he didn’t move away.
“I... don’t live here most of the time?” Harry informed him. Draco looked puzzled.
Like all questions about the Task Force, Harry made a neutral noise, neither confirming or denying. There was an ink smudge that had somehow got on the bridge of Harry’s nose and Draco reached out to rub it off.
“Shut up,” Harry said. But he had relaxed and found the staring didn’t bother him as much after that remark.
“You don’t understand at all,” Draco said softly.
They sat and resumed kissing until Harry’s leg fell asleep and he nearly fell off the couch.
“Mmm?” said Harry.
Harry must have said something. Something because Draco went to the bathroom, and he left Harry standing alone, heart racing and palms sweaty. But next he was aware, he stood on the balcony. He reached under his shirt and pulled the left wing of his Firebird.
“Get tested for me. And I’ll make you sticky buns,” Hermione said.
Draco led him into the garden and took the washcloth from Fleur and pressed against the back of Harry’s neck. The cloth was just this side of freezing. He felt himself calm a little. He touched a hand to his forehead. It was a close universe, but the edge of his scar meant this wasn’t one of those strange ones where there had been no Voldemort.
A silence lingered in the air. Pregnant and uncomfortable. He figured that if he was stranded on a severed Island with Draco Malfoy and surviving, he could at least come up with some sort of trust-pact or whatever.
Draco laughed. And it was fantastic. It sent his heart flying. The blond leaned in, placing a soft kiss on his lips.
I've decided to update on Tuesday and Thursday now<3
Harry gazed out of the window, at the night sky. A beauty in the chaos. He wanted to drown in the light of a thousand stars, or to be in a sky with stars. Or maybe he didn’t belong with the stars. The sky was infinite, and he was infinitesimally small in the entire universe.
“I’ll kick your arse to Neverland if you don’t –
“I can,” Potter said with a sigh, half-turning to face him, fingers brushing over his jean pocket in an anxious manner, a ghost of a concerned frown crossing his features. “I wouldn’t worry – You can’t compliment a soul, Malfoy.”
The brunet’s voice was harsh, and he closed his eyes to force the voice out. Yet, it didn’t work. He had only wanted to protect Harry. The entire operation had failed only because he had prioritized him over the serial killer.
“Well,” Malfoy mumbled, placing the wand in the cloak and carding his fingers through his hair with a relented sigh as he leaned against the rough bark of the tree. “
“You – Christ, Malfoy – Rapunzel with golden hair, containing healing powers?”
Maybe I won't, n e waze-
Draco Malfoy said that Harry Potter is perfect, and he isn’t.”
On that night, he had a dream.
A voice in his head said – It was his own. ‘
Christmas had approached quickly and they had hardly had any time for themselves with both of them working endlessly. They were currently strolling through Muggle London, their fingers intertwined. Snow had started falling the moment they stepped outside, adding to the Christmas spirit.
“It – the artefact caused the small outburst,” He had an unclear voice. Wavering while he outstretched the right hand. It was a cup. “Glamour charm –” A pause. “one would perceive it as a regular pocket-watch.”
“No,” Harry said with a shrug, eyes drifting to a distance to the seagulls perched on stones close to the shore – a vigil over a grave – it was sort of disconcerting. “Isn’t it a rule in your
“Oh, shut up.”
It was a much softer tone. A lot softer than before.
“You said
He lost control over the charm, causing the small rocks and seashells to tremble slightly. It halted as he dismissed his concerns. He had to believe Ron and Hermione were safe. Alive and safe. Or it would be a never-ending cycle. And he had a lot to stress over. A lot, including – No, he couldn’t think about it.
dangerous. But I’ll be back soon. It’s not a search and rescue, we know exactly where he is.” The Ministry bell clanged once again. “Yes, yes, I’m coming!”
Harry tried to hold his breath for long enough, but he felt a tightness in his chest and a burning in his throat. He opened his mouth. The water rushed in. He awoke drenched in sweat and gasping for air.
Harry rolled his eyes at him.
“How are you?” Harry asked desperately.
“Then at least let me give you a point of comparison,” Harry said.
He knew Lucius Malfoy had not been healthy. He’d asked for and received all of his medical records in Azkaban.  He had developed serious tremors as a side-effect of dark curses. Unlike Draco’s, they hadn't faded. His father walked with a cane and had a small seizure shortly after his first year in prison.
Harry followed him out in a daze, and they strolled Diagon. A few stares were directed at them, but they mostly passed over Draco and looked at Harry. Harry would never stop feeling that mix of shame and embarrassment when people paid him any attention at all, even if people had stopped approaching him. Draco placed a hand on his arm and bent over.
“Which rotation should I pick next year?” Draco asked.
“Again with the glitter. I’m going to regret this, aren’t I?” Harry responded evenly. Being special reared its head once again.
Harry nods once.
“I’ll walk you. You were heading in the wrong direction,” Draco muttered. Chike returned with a small hand towel and a black t-shirt with the name of the bookshop, a size too small, but Harry took it anyway, dried his torso a little and changed quickly. She handed him a branded tote bag for his wet shirt.
“Are you okay with this?"
This time the jolt was immediate because he saw Draco right away. Face to face. They were in an old-fashioned setting in a ballroom. Harry could see dozens of tails, cravats and gem coloured ball gowns. And Harry was glad his muscle memory was apparently engaged because Draco was leading them in some dance?
“Too late for regrets. Please. Is he alright or not?”
It made sense. This was different here. Draco looked like
“I need one more character reference. Headmistress McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey both have already. The rest refused. I have exactly two friends and I’m not allowed to use criminals or war collaborators. That’s
Draco sketched out the calculations directly on the hardwood with the black marker he had tucked behind his ear. Too much magic wouldn’t be a problem for this. He left the room, and the door melted into the wall. He had cut off the room from the house’s magic and made it unplottable. It would probably collapse on itself like a black hole. Good riddance.
“did you talk to him?” demands pansy as soon as draco answers the phone. “did he cheat on you? bloody hell, draco, tell me he didn’t. i’ll kill him, i swear. azkaban be damned.”
“is that really what you think?” he asks, cocking an eyebrow. his throat burns, every part of him aches - but he continues. “your ignorance and your pride will be the death of you, petunia.”
from the table beside him, the mobile harry had insisted he get began to vibrate loudly, shattering his dreamy hypnagogia. he reached out blindly, feeling around for the phone before quickly accepting the call and putting it to his ear.
without much preamble, harry poured a generous helping of lube onto his fingers and reached behind draco, tracing his hole for a few moments before pushing in. they had just fucked last night - so draco was already a little stretched, which made preparing him that much easier. harry spread the remainder of the lubricant over his cock, a soft moan escaping his lips as he did so.
draco flicks his wrist once more, and a shield snaps into place over them - just as the car explodes and parts go flying. harry flinches - the sound is deafening, and only slightly muffled by the shield charm holding fast around them.
guilt eats at him, scratching at his insides and practically choking him. he should stay - he knows he should. they aren’t married, but in their years together they have formed an unspoken covenant, a promise, to take care of each other. when draco had been ill with dragonpox and practically delirious all those months ago, harry had taken care of him and stroked his hair and fed him molly weasley’s soup until he had finally been able to pull himself from bed. and when harry had fallen into a particularly deep depression following the fifth anniversary of the battle of hogwarts, draco had prodded him into the bath and washed his hair and scrubbed his body when he hadn't been able to find the energy to do so himself. they had seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of each other… how could draco possibly walk out on him now?
“is he okay?” draco asked, flicking off the stove. he could feel hysteria rising in his chest, but fought steadily to maintain his composure. “what’s happened?”
“whenever you’re ready, minister,” pansy said lowly, making eye contact with harry and nodding seriously. it’s almost funny to draco, the way that pansy effortlessly transformed from his best friend into a stoic, austere deputy auror who wouldn’t hesitate to put a man flat on his back. this pansy, with her red lipstick and her narrowed eyes, is nothing like the pansy who spends weekends curled on their couch, hogging a bottle of wine and snorting with laughter.
he had stuffed himself full, all the while prodding harry for more information, which he had refused to provide. after breakfast, harry had pulled him out of the house, and towards the empty childs play area.
. the moment you learn this, your life will become so much easier.”
he chokes on his tears as he reads the paper again and again, running his thumb over the line of harry’s writing again and again. knowing that harry had written this note to himself, had touched this paper and ripped it himself and tucked it away in this dark little box. draco presses it to his nose, hoping to catch even a whiff of harry’s essence. the only thing he smells is peppermint - which is close enough, but also so very far from fully capturing who harry was.
a loud clattering from the entrance of the room caught everyone’s attention - all turning to see theodore standing in the doorway, a pile of plastic bottles at his feet.
draco closes the door.
one phrase stuck out to her most: “
“harry’s here,” she choked, her eyes watering once more. “he’s - they found him at hogwarts and they’re trying to revive him but - i saw him, ron, he looks -” she gulped and blinked rapidly, willing herself not to burst into tears.
draco doesn’t respond verbally, but he locks eyes with harry and slowly opens his mouth, his pink tongue darting across his plump bottom lip. harry wraps his hand around his cock and drags it slowly across draco’s lip, watching with satisfaction as he eagerly lapped up the liquid left behind.
finally - draco had the opportunity to say goodbye on his own terms.
draco stares blankly at harry’s hand - thinking about the time the roles had been reversed when he had offered harry his own hand and been rejected. he pastes a smile on - a pureblood smile, still ingrained in him after all these years. he looks up at harry and catches his eye, those bright, electric green eyes. a part of him misses those eyes. will always miss them. andrew’s eyes are a nondescript brown.
. “draco,” harry starts, stepping closer.
“we all have magical hands, we’re wizards” draco returns, a smirk playing on his lips. harry opened one of his eyes and squinted at draco through it. “but i love you too, harry.”
told draco that harry would be waking up within the next few minutes. his stomach had yet to settle, and he felt as if he would either throw up or cry.
“you’re so annoying,” harry groaned, gripping draco’s hip with one hand, and his cock with the other. he lined himself up quickly before moving to hold draco securely, slowly lowering him onto his cock. draco whimpered softly in response, his eyes fluttering shut. once draco was completely seated, he
“father,” draco said shakily, and harry resisted the urge to reach out and grab his hand. “you know why i’m here.”
“draco,” harry said gently, reaching across the table in a quiet show of support.
draco takes a deep breath, his hands trembling.
should work for the prophet. i’m quite good at this, don’t you think?
“i made sure to pay attention, mr.malfoy. you can review my memories whenever necessary.” he said as soon as they were out of earshot of the room. “i saw your eyes glaze over when he started to talk about fruit and vegetable exports.”
draco took a deep drag from his blunt as he leaned back in his chair, watching as the smoke curled into the air and dissipated. his eyes closed slowly, the familiar burn in his chest soothing rather than upsetting him. when the pain faded, he took another pull, this one smaller than the first. this time, he held the smoke in for a bit, releasing it in a steady stream of smoke that made him smile.
harry had fallen asleep in draco’s embrace that night, a departure from their normal position. draco had lain awake for long afterward, his mind racing and the love of his life in his arms.
“hermione,” he pleads. he’s not sure why he’s hesitating - here’s the way out he had been craving since this had all started. except, he’s too afraid to take it. he loves harry, doesn’t want to leave him - forgives him for all he’s done, all that he will do. “i can’t - “
he looks up at draco with a wild grin, and draco looks away before his fondness spreads across his face and leaves him terribly exposed.
“i’ll stay in contact,” he said gently, forcing himself to remain composed. his mother smells of vanilla and lavender, and he feels safe in her grip. “i’ll write to you, and pansy offered to pass along messages for me until i can get my floo set up.”
“can i kiss you right now?” harry asks, and draco’s knees go weak. harry steps close to him, and draco inhales the familiar earthy scent. he opens his mouth again, and draco smells the peppermints he knows harry has had recently. “i’d like to kiss you.”
“what do you mean, love?” draco sat up, pulling harry with him. his handsome face was contorted with grief - his eyes were bloodshot red and swollen, along with his lips. his face was wet with various fluids, but draco couldn’t bring himself to care.
“oi, what are you talking about, malfoy?” seamus says loudly, obviously misjudging the severity of the situation. beside him, dean nudges him discreetly, shaking his head.
“i’ve been looking for months. nobody would tell me… i had to find you in the magical directory.”
“what? how could it have possibly not come up?” she demanded.
“i’d say that’s enough small talk,” harry grins, reaching across the bed for a pillow. lucius’ eyes bulge in his skull, as if he hadn’t actually expected harry to carry out his promises. “any last words? no, i didn’t think so. good bye, lucius. see you in hell.”
the sun has long set, and draco blinks belatedly as he realizes that he has been sat in the dark, holding harry’s body to his and trying to muffle his sobs. as he stands to close the curtains, his fingers brush a strip of plastic. he doesn’t have to look down to know that harry’s small green bag is at his fingertips.
“it’s called best friends club. the lyrics are still a work in progress, but here’s what i’ve got so far.
“well this is absolutely dreadful,”
he took his hand, leading harry to the sofa, where he sat beside him and placed a hand on his knee. harry waits, patiently, watching as draco collected himself. his gaze is full of affection and acceptance, and it causes a bulk of draco’s insecurities to melt away. he can hear pansy’s voice in his mind, reminding him that harry loves him - and his sitting beside him in their silent home is practically proof.
“fine,” draco groaned, pushing harry’s hands away and standing from the bed. he wobbled on his feet, but recovered quickly. “then i’ll take a sobering potion.” he staggered over to the vanity, where there was already an impressive collection of serums and potions - despite them having only been at the resort for three days. draco reached blindly for a vial, knocking over several others. he squinted at it for a moment before discarding it and beginning to search for the potion again. after a few tries, he found the correct vial, and downed it in one go. he shuddered as the potion coursed through his body, immediately sobering him.
“mr. malfoy, i don’t usually do house calls, but i felt this situation deserved an exception.” kingsley says solemnly, his hands folding over his robes. draco’s mouth goes dry as his mind begins to race - each avenue of thought leading him to the same conclusion each time. he wants to slam the door shut, to find a time turner and go back, to change the order of what he already knows has happened. instead, he stands in the doorway, his eyes wide and his shoulders tense. “is there somewhere we can sit and talk?”
“Time for you to answer some questions,” one of them said. They pulled the hood halfway up his face, forced his mouth open and dropped something on his tongue. Draco tried to spit, but they covered his nose until he swallowed.
Would it have to be so different if they were actually together? But that thought was interrupted by a donor at his elbow.
“I’m not going to forget,” Harry said fondly. “Although you’re welcome to remind me tomorrow.” A kiss on the cheek. “And the next day.” Another kiss pressed to Draco’s knuckles with their hands still joined. “Maybe for the next year or so.”
Harry agreed. But he hadn’t even really thought through the implications of the breakup. They were her family, not his. No matter what they said. He flooed home. Ginny owled him back after his missive.
Healer Jupiter Blishwick was more interested in questions such as, “When was the last time you slept eight hours Harry?” and “What do you know about depression?” and “How do you feel about eating sandwiches from the street cart in Diagon for dinner most nights?” and “How would you feel about the word bisexual?”
“Next week, then. I’ll get you the location.”
Draco disappeared into the floo before Harry could find out for certain.
“That’s not the point. You can’t just call me up at any time to do shit for you. I don’t work here anymore. You promised me I would be done and walk away from this. I don’t have missions or duty or service. I don't owe anyone anything.”
Harry strode into St Mungo’s at 3 pm wearing the standard-issue Auror field cloak after a twelve hour surveillance shift and asked for Healer Malfoy. The witch allowed him into Draco’s office in the family medical ward  upon seeing his badge. Draco was bent over a chart wearing silver wire-framed spectacles.
“You can sort the books any way you like. We’re closed for the summer.” Eustace said.
“Thank you for coming,” His mother said. She seemed a little overcome, and Draco steadied her with a hand on her back.
that if I can prepare a perfect crepe, I won’t mourn when you die.”
His aim was slightly better, but he didn’t dare hit Draco in the face more than once. Harry totally let the blond win, and the proud grin on Draco’s face was worth it.
A pause.
Harry lowered himself on the couch, and carded his fingers though the platinum blond hair. He decided it didn’t matter if Draco finished all of the chocolates. He could never get tired of the spark in the grey eyes.
“Thank you, Potter.”
A frown creased Draco’s forehead. The odd glint had faded. The eyes were unfocused. Confused. It was one of the effects. “I – what?” The voice was small. “what is that –” He stopped short, sighing, mouth twisting as he fought to find the right word. “what is that thing?”
Draco’s stared at him, the widest grin on his face and he didn’t even care to suppress it. He couldn’t even be bothered to – Because he had missed this so much. “Say it again.”
“Oh, how considerate of you to grace Draco Malfoy with your presence,” Draco said in a slow, sarcastic drawl, shifting in place with a low grunt, forcing a scowl on the face. “a change of heart, Potter?”
“It’s always the right moment to mention how beautiful I am, Potter.”
“The third of December, 1996.” He whispered, as he went closer to the slender figure. “We wished on the falling stars, in the middle of the Quidditch pitch. I kissed you under the light of a thousand falling stars.”
Not that living in Otryazan wasn’t a ‘break’. It wasn’t pleasant, but it was a break. He wasn’t camping and hunting horcruxes. Or on the run.
“I - I cursed Katie Bell with the necklace and spiked the mead - It almost killed Weasley. I fucking deserve to die.”
“Oh, you’d defend the
“I changed my mind.”
In an hour, he opened the door slightly and glanced at the living room. Potter wasn’t breaking any more teacups. Or walking around.
Instead of worsening it, he walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind him. It wasn’t a lot. A double bed was placed in the centre, and a white wardrobe was against the wall. A small candle chandelier hung in balance, casting a soft light on the room.
“Sort of,” Harry mumbled, fishing out the pocket watch and placing it on the kitchen counter, on top of the novel. He hadn’t finished it yet. “you want a cup of tea?”
“Wizard Hitler – Potter, have you lost your sanity?”
, I’m exhausted – so, we’re finished for today.”
His mind traced back to the manor, and the words that Lucius Malfoy had whispered softly before he had fired the spell: ‘Save him’
Draco curled the fingers into the white sweater with a curse. “I’m not angling for the ‘
Malfoy snorted, yet he didn’t retort. A tiny victory. It caused a rush of satisfaction within Harry. The corner of his lip twitched and curled into the smallest smirk. “Your constructive criticism isn’t encouraging, Potter.”
The cursive was oddly familiar. He scrunched his nose and placed the note in his bag, and continued to brew the potion instead of stressing over a note. Yet, it didn’t leave his mind and he tried to access the events of December 1996.
“Finish it off, Potter.” He said, his gaze fixed on the floor. “Kill me.”
“For the record,” Malfoy said, underlining the words with a warning glare, but it failed to hold the intended effect on him. “it was supposed to be a sarcastic statement and not a compliment.”
He decided to rest, instead of letting his thoughts overwhelm him. And he did, until Potter shattered two teacups. Or more.
More of rooftop conversations and oh - fairytales
He never asked him to stay. On that December morning – Harry announced that he was moving to New York. He wanted to start all over again, in a new place. He wanted to recover. “You never run away, Harry. Never.”
Draco scowled, tilting his head to the side and staring at the waves and exhaled slowly. Fantastic. The glamour had worn-off – He wasn’t fond of the eye – The left iris was the lightest shade of blue, and he had concealed it since he was eleven. “It’s defined as Heterochromia, Potter.”
He’d rather prefer former enemies who weren’t friends, yet were forced to put up with each other, considering they were stranded on a severed Island with
“Why wouldn’t I?” He repeated with the similar soft, patient voice. It was sincere. Draco felt the pent-up rage within starting to subside. “you’re a –” Potter cleared his throat. “you’re tolerable now, aren’t you?”
“I’m not going anywhere.” He said softly, and placed a warm palm against his cheek. “I won’t, I promise okay?”
“Good for you,” Draco’s tone had a hint of ruefulness to it, which he hadn’t heard before. In fact, he had rarely heard Draco speak conversationally, without the sarcasm. “If we’re finished with our conversation, I have to return to the room, finish Lord of the Rings and pretend you don’t exist.”
“I’m luring you into being a dark wizard.” Draco said, as the brunet gave him an innocent grin, and it made his heart flip a bit. “It’s a part of our secret Pure-blood subject.”
Malfoy smirked. “Not that I care about you, Potter. But if you die in Otryazan, your death will be a minor inconvenience – I’ll mourn the crepes.”
“Yeah, I figured that out as well.” Harry said, sighing softly. It was radiating magic. Yet, it wasn’t familiar to him. He couldn’t quite understand it. He wanted to know more. Yet, he knew that he couldn’t get out of here. “You shouldn’t be here, Malfoy.”
“Yet, a painful reminder of what the sky of your fancy was when you were eleven?”
When he neared the end of it, a head drifted to his shoulder and he paused. The soft blond hair brushed against his chin and tilted his head a bit and stared at Malfoy. He was kind of beautiful and kind of close to perfect.
It was a subtle ‘thank you’. Or a ‘fuck you’. He couldn’t decide. With Malfoy, he could never decide. He poured more batter into the pan and rest his gaze on Malfoy. “Do you want to flip a crepe?”
It wasn’t a convincing argument. And he didn’t know if he could come up with one.
Potter retracted the hand with a single twitch in his fingers – a sort of worried mien crossing his face – and he raised the eyebrows in question. “Your face is screwed up.”
“Oh, yeah right,” He saw the flicker of hurt across Malfoy’s face and he wasn’t prepared for the slash of guilt in his chest. “You can’t trust a Death Eater, can you?”
“Why a few years?” Harry said in confusion with a short, uncertain laugh. He couldn’t grasp the connotation in Draco’s words and said, “I won’t be in Otryazan for a year now, will I?”
“You don’t say.” Harry said, with a hint of sarcasm. He couldn’t put up with Malfoy. He would rather get splinched than stay here any longer. A missing piece. He was missing a piece of this puzzle.
Draco was eating the M&M’s. Nobody touched the M&M’s and that was the fucking rule. Or the skittles. Or any chocolate for that matter, until he offered them himself.
"Together."
“I was – I didn’t care if you were the chosen one,” Malfoy whispered, he fidgeted ever so slightly, losing some of his carefully maintained Malfoy composure. The fidgeting also made him accidentally brush up against Harry and he pulled away as quick as the touch lasted. Not quick enough for Harry to not feel a flutter, though.  A lingering warmth. “I wanted one little win, Potter. Only one.”
"So that's– what does that mean?" The uncertainty and sheer vulnerability Draco let creep into his voice was sort of embarrassing but somehow, everything seemed to be worth it when Harry said:
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy said archly and directed an irritated glare at him. “Believe it or not, I did not spend my childhood attending tea parties.”
“I assumed it was mostly posture coaching and learning ballroom waltzes.”
The brunet laughed, and it caused a familiar flutter in his chest as lips curved into a reluctant smile. Only Potter could simultaneously enthral and irritate him, and he would hex himself to escape if he could.
It felt odd to recite a fairy-tale while baking cookies, but there was a glint in Malfoy’s eyes. Almost a childish innocence. “The fact that she tied Flynn with her hair was – weird.”
“I was –” Potter paused, a brief flicker of regret crossing his features. “I’m not –” He cast a glance around the room with a sigh, fingers fidgeting with a cup in the hand. “well yes, a change of heart.”
“You didn’t have it in you.”
“No,” Draco placed the cloak near the door and sauntered to the counter with a measured pace, legs quivering while he dropped down on the chair. “it bothers you, doesn’t it?”
“You see, some wizarding families are better than the others, Malfoy. You don’t wanna go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
“I don’t,” He whispered, as he marked the page and placed it on the table. Holding the man by Timothy Conigrave. An Australian author. A muggle. “It's good."
Harry let out a chuckle, holding out his hand again to help him up, Draco grabbed it and stood up on his shaky legs.  Harry gave him a devious grin. “Now that you have to rely on me entirely – Shall we?”
The lens mended itself, and he exhaled softly. He rested the back of his head against the nearest tree. He was exhausted, and he could barely resist his urge to scream.
He closed his eyes, as he heard the soft clinking of teacups and a frustrated groan. It wasn’t a note-hunting if he hadn’t even left one. Harry could barely refrain a chuckle.
“Yes,
Harry snorted, and gave a slight shake to his head. He wasn’t wrong. Yet, as reluctant as he was to tell him he had to. He couldn’t risk Malfoy invading his head. He had secrets. Besides, it was too dark in there – His years with the Dursleys, and the deaths he had to witness.
“In that moment, yes.” Harry said with a strained voice. He had wanted to hurt Bellatrix. Wanted her to pay the price for killing Sirius. Yet, he couldn’t. “I used the cruciatus curse on her – It didn’t work.”
Harry reveals what Lucius said to him in the Manor and Draco doesn't take it well
They continued to walk in content silence, taking in the Christmas lights that had been scattered around the city, adding an aura of happiness along with them. They had warm coffees in their hands, as they made their way through the crowd.
In retrospect, he shouldn’t have used the ‘death eater’ card. It was a cheap shot and a sensitive topic at that. But Malfoy had used the ‘Sirius’ card. It was insensitive. Harry had lost his patience. Not that he had much patience to begin with.
“Well, are you suffering?”
Draco smirked.
“Spoon of cream? Cap of milk? It’s supposed to be half and half.”
“An astute observation,” Draco stared at the bright tingle of the stars – the silver light streaking in the calm water – the silky feeling of moonlight on the skin. “It’s – well, it’s worth it.”
He retracted his hand and continued to dance. The air which was comfortable a moment ago, turned taut.
“Eleven?” Malfoy whispered in a small voice, staring at him incredulously. “You didn’t have any idea of the wizarding world until you were eleven?”
The panic started to rise within a minute. It was the close proximity which caused the surge of panic. He wasn’t the one for touches. Not even a brief embrace or a soft, familiar touch.
He wanted to ignore Malfoy’s curious, piercing stare and forget about the fucking artifact. Preferably for a few hours. He couldn’t entertain a conversation about it. He wanted to force
“Malfoy,” He said, his voice unsure, wobbly. “Voldemort sent you here, didn’t he?”
“I was convinced that it was necessary.” Malfoy said, frowning slightly. His eyebrows making a small, sharp crease between his eyes, then he gave a long exhale, his breath making a cloud of fog in front of his face. “Necessary to survive, and save my family. The darkness – It drew me in, and held a power over me.”
“Watch,” He said, as he turned and skated away a few feet before returning to face him. Harry gestured him to try again, but he didn’t make any progress. “Were you even watching my feet at all?”
“Fucking – Shit – Bastard – Arsehole.”
“I, uh, s-sure.” Harry mumbled, cursing inwardly for stuttering. “Thank you.”
The only thing closer to Hogwarts – closer to the memories – was Draco Malfoy. Closer to the easier times of first-year rivalry. Of Quidditch matches.
The blond winced in pain, his fingers on his jaw. It was bruised. “Fuck you, Potter.”
The brunet chuckled, raising the cup to his lips and the eyes widened with a small sip. “It’s incredible, considering it’s a tea without sugar.”
“I will screw up the chance if you touch the cup, clear?”
Malfoy drew in an uneasy breath, and frowned at the ground. “It might’ve been a part of the Pure-blood upbringing.”
Malfoy did not have breakfast that morning. Or lunch. He didn’t write back. Instead, he wandered back into the bedroom with any notes. Confusion was one way to put it.
Malfoy was sort of confused, and perhaps uncertain. He paused to consider, frowning at the kitchen counter. “If you tone down the excessive sarcasm and the smart, wonderful Potter bit, then yes.”
“Quit laughing.”
“Until you finished all of them?”
He smiled.
A short, yet amused laugh escaped Draco’s mouth which caused the brunet to curse and he was quite pleased to earn a reaction out of Potter. “Glad we cleared it out.”
It was a familiar drawl. It couldn’t be. He was just an outline against the sky, but the moonlight falling softly on the platinum blond hair was unmistakable. He turned.
Harry awoke slowly to the sound of birds chirping in distance and the soft rustling of the trees. He rubbed his eyes, pushing the covers aside and glanced around the living room. He smiled softly, curling his fingers into the blanket. A candle chandelier hung in balance in the centre of the living room over the brown coffee table.
The cleaning charm was easier. He practiced it a lot often. And he had perfected the vanishing charm at breakfast. Only after a half-vanished toast, and a sort of vanished apple was he able to perfect it.
“Draco,” he said in the softest voice. A confused frown creased the forehead and the brunet shuffled closer on the bed towards Draco with a nervous, uncertain sigh. “Of course, I care.” A pause. “why wouldn’t I?”
Another shrug.
It elicited a soft muffled gasp. It was certainly astounding to hear a not-so-subtle apology out of Potter’s mouth. He couldn’t come up with a clever quip either. Not when the brunet was disoriented – frowning at the ground with his fingers curled into a fist at his side and the nails buried into his palm.
She would ruffle his hair and smile, as he argued with her over the beauty of the night sky.
“I’m not – Yeah, I’m kind of curious, Potter. Kind of. Will you recite it?”
He was so broken. So vulnerable. And he decided, that he would save Malfoy at all costs.
He half-turned to Potter, and scanned his face for a brief second. The silence wasn’t mocking or filled with any underlying concepts. Just plain old silence. “Yes. One soft epilogue.”
“I know,” He said, sighing softly as he carded his fingers through his hair. “I’m used to it. Four days isn’t a lot.”
“Shouldn’t you be working on your to-do list?”
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. Draco hadn’t been anticipating it. He was missing a piece of the puzzle. He fixed his gaze at a distance. He watched the moon light up the night and cascading its light with a soft glow, casting a slivery sparkle on the water.
Harry stared at the two seagulls standing still, ominously gazing at the ocean's surf and it was unsettling. The sea was turbulent. He walked at the edge of the shore, watching the waves crash. The sun was rising at a distance, and its soft light was falling on the water.
“Draco,” It was a soft whisper and with a confused frown etched on the face, the brunet clinked the back of the index finger on Draco’s. “what are you on about?”
, didn’t you?” He said with an oh-so familiar smirk “It’s a classic error for a daft, idiotic, moronic fuck such as you," A beat, "No reaction?"
“I’ll start on the breakfast in –
“I didn’t,” He said with a soft sigh, tracing his mind back to the first time he had cast the Patronus. Perhaps, Malfoy should work on the thinking aspect of casting the charm. “I couldn’t cast a corporeal one for months.”
instead.”
“Plus, you can’t dance.” Draco said with a soft chuckle, thinking of the Yule Ball in the fourth year and of Potter dancing ineptly. “It was painful to watch.”
He had a tragically beautiful sky. A little bit like his life. Not only beautiful, but tragic.
sworn rivals, Malfoy, mostly because you were a prat," Four weeks ago he wouldn’t’ve cared if he had offended Draco Malfoy. In fact, he would’ve left the blond to stew in his own misery. Now, he couldn't do that. He did care. More than he wanted to. “Now, you and I are not the same," A beat, "now, we’re friends,” A corner of his mouth upturned in soft amusement. “Deal with it.”
A tense silence lingered in the air, and Malfoy pointedly focused on folding the crepe while he whispered an uncertain, “Who isn’t, Potter?”
They slipped into the house quietly, and Draco pushed the door until it was almost closed. Only a small whistle of the wind revealed that it wasn't. He fished out his wand from his robes, lighting a fire in the grate.
The surface was soft, but he groaned in pain. He frowned, searching frantically for his glasses. His fingers brushed against the familiar frame, lying on the ground. He placed his glasses back in place, and cursed under his breath. The lenses were cracked. And he didn’t have a wand.
"Hey," He whispered in a slow, uncertain voice as he nudged the blond. It had to be subtle. Not a 'I'm uttering a quick apology because my conscience decided to guilt-trip me into it. No, certainly not. It had to be subtle, yet sincere. "I - erm - never knew you weren't offered a choice."
It floated in the air and into the room with an added weight. Odd. When he received a muffled ‘thank you’ in response, he placed his wand on the counter and wiped a sheen of sweat on his forehead.
In those moments, he would put the words he couldn’t say out loud in the form of vivid colours on a canvas. He turned the words into a painting.
“I’m alright, came for a conference with Michael. Michael Corner.”
They are both more than familiar with all the top healers. Harry manages to feel slightly embarrassed about it, while Draco has a ranked hierarchy for which ones are great and which are “little better than summoning a mirror and poking oneself with a wand." Draco relaxes when Healer Ahmed enters the room, so Harry does as well. Healer Ahmed is apologetic but firm.
“Reckless.” Harry was not sure whether Draco was talking to himself or Harry.
“Promise me you’re not going to list us on WixSurf,” Draco says.
“Severus said I wasn’t to tell you that he left you money unless you did something useful with yourself,” she told him. Draco smiled a little. Sounded like something he’d do.
“It’s too hot for this. Will you shut up?” Draco said.
Harry was in a beautiful lush green forest. A tiny red cardinal alighted on a branch. When Harry went to reach out, bright green vines had bound his hands, thinner than Devil’s Snare. They tightened painfully around his ankles, thighs, wrists and biceps. Harry thrashed, and they only burned more. The vines brushed away his tears and tightened again. The bird watched him now. It spread its wing wide and swooped. Harry woke up in a cold sweat and clapped his hands over his eyes as if they might be in danger of getting pecked out.
“If Bill thought you should handle this by yourself, he wouldn’t have sent me with you,” Harry pointed out.
"That's not what—"
“I need to lean over farther, laying flat over the edge,” Draco said, looking back at Harry with a serious expression. Harry could see the light reflecting in Draco’s eyes.
“There’s no need for all of that if you cooperate. I don’t want to arrest you and the Minister doesn’t want this public. The information is more important anyway,” Hermione said.
“That won’t be possible, Harry.”
A week later, a bright gold scroll titled
“Hi Hermione. Hello Minister,” Harry said. If he smiled a little, it was because he knew what was next.
Next time Hermione complained about his lateness he could tell her he had peered into several universes and it was inherent to his character.
Then Harry stood up suddenly.
“Harry?” Draco said beside Harry’s ear, warm and intimate.
And when he arrived at the Great Hall, he found it smaller than he remembered.
Harry noticed that Draco stuck his tongue out slightly when he was concentrating and it made it harder to think.
“It’s barely magical,” Draco said.
“My friend Chike illustrated them,” Draco said. Draco rubbed the back of his neck and looked at the ground.
“I can wait,” Harry said. He could be patient for this.
“No, I like this one. Where Voldemort is dead and my life is boring and all my friends are alive and well.” She winced at his crassness.
“I’m afraid I didn’t bring you here just for dinner, Harry,” Kingsley said.
“I can catch you up on suspects, Potter, ” Athena said. “Come round.”
“All of you should remember to read the charts thoroughly. Read them yourselves. Don’t let a mediwizard or another Healer convince you of what isn’t true. Not even me. They aren’t there for decoration. Off to your rounds.” Healer Cummins dismissed them.
Draco disappeared into the other room. Harry looked around at the flat. Again, blessedly normal. There were little abstract art prints on the walls, a couple books piled on each surface and a bowl of apples on his kitchen table. Harry studied one of the bigger coffee table books, Queering the Classics. It was photos of naked men of all shapes, colours and sizes posed beside Ancient Greek statues.
“I would do it myself, but I can’t sustain enough jumps to do a thorough search since Malfoy is a perfect traveller,” Hermione said. It must not be possible if she admitted that much. But the question still rankled.
There was shifting in the benches, as if they thought he would have tried his father’s gambit and lied that he had been under an Imperius the entire time. Draco didn’t have the energy and didn’t see the point. No one was buying it, and if they were, all the assets he could use to find a better lawyer to suggest it were impounded somewhere in a special vault. This time, they knew better than to allow Malfoy money to influence things.
The way he said it made him look around again. The house wasn’t so terrible once he had returned every night. It had itself shuffled to accommodate his likes and dislikes now. There were more windows, more light. He knew magical houses could be like that, but it was another thing to experience it.
“We should send Maddy a birthday present soon. I should owl Fleur about that toymaker cousin of hers,” Draco said, one morning when the house offered them a wheel of brie. Harry froze while Draco busied himself cutting a triangle of the cheese onto some crusty bread.
"Busy with what?" Draco asked softly.
The name finally clicked for Harry. Dorcas Meadowes was an Auror who had died in the first Wizarding War. She had been an Order member. There was a photo somewhere of her smiling and waving in Harry’s albums. Athena must be related to her somehow.
“Sorry! Sorry. I’ll do it tomorrow!” He had never heard his father’s voice so casually, but it sounded like his. Harry froze on the landing, rubbing his ankle. He felt a comforting hand placed on his shoulder.
“Have you done this before?” Blaise had asked. Draco flushed red. He knew Blaise did not mean making out with a Muggle boy during Pride night at his local. He shook his head no.
“What was your favourite universe?” Harry asked.
“Her aunt Dorcas was my first partner,” Kingsley explained. “She was my best friend. When she died, I went to pieces.”
"Did you accidentally vanish my work robes? I pay for those," Draco complained. Harry was pleased that he sounded short of breath too.
“I’ll be there Monday,” Harry promised.
The fruit trees he wanted to plant would wait another year. All the gardening he needed to do he asked Neville to check in on.
“draco,” she tried, her voice just barely heard over his heart-wrenching sobs. “i know that right now feels like the end of the world, but i promise you that it’ll all work out. it’ll be okay. you’ll find someone else, and you’ll love them much more than potter. i promise you that, my love.”
draco tangles his hands in harry’s hair, holding his head in place as his hips snap up weakly, into harry’s mouth. whimpers and moans fall from his lips like a song - never ending and sweet like honey to harry’s ears. the knowledge that he is the one taking draco apart so wholly - causing him to lose touch with his normal, well-kept self, is enough to make harry’s own spent cock stand at attention, already thickening between his thighs.
as the weeks went on, their haze of engagement bliss continued to dissipate.
at hermione’s suggestion, harry clenches his fist imperceptibly, but draco catches it. he knows the violent side of harry quite intimately, knows that he wants nothing more than to grab hermione by her hair right now, and slam her face into the wall again and again, breaking her nose and knocking her unconscious.
“harry,” draco had murmured one night, as he sat harry on the toilet seat and pulled off his stained shirt. “what’s going on?”
“i’m on my way up there now,” the healer said finally. “i can explain as we walk.”
he laughs through his tears at the implication - at the idea of harry ever needing to psych himself up to propose to draco. even now, draco loved harry completely, with every ounce of his being. he would’ve had to have been a fool to do anything other than immediately say yes - and draco was no fool.
they do, and draco hustles them together into the hallway, one hand dragging petunia and the other using his wand to poke vernon’s large backside. they bustle along, complaining and whining and being generally annoying. harry stands to the side, watching silently with his arms crossed in front of his chest. he instructs petunia and vernon to stand still, shoving his wand into each of their faces as he kicks in dudley’s door and gathers him up in much of the same manner he had used for his parents.
for a week, things were perfect. they woke early enough to watch the sunrise and spent their days swimming and lazing around in and around the cottage, surviving on wine, cheese, pastries, and fruits. when they became hungry for a real meal, they apparated to a market harry had discovered, and spent the day picking out cuts of meat and fresh vegetables.
and then he’s sobbing loudly and freely, hanging his head in shame. he leans into potter, burying his face in his hands and allowing his anger to melt away. the utter grief, the sadness that had been edging just below the surface spills over falling over draco in one long, terrible moment.
