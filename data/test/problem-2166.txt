It was a lucky thing that the copy spell didn’t need CLEAN paper, and that Fred and George were so hard on their textbooks that even his mother had given up trying to repair some of them.
I wanted to use this chapter to illustrate that Ron and co are not in any way desperate for time travel, and neither should Draco have been. That the choices Ron makes going forward are not egged on by some great tragedy or loss any more than any other tragedy and loss they’ve encountered. Everyone has been grieving Draco for years.
His wand was old, used, a handed down relic that had seen more hands then he imagined a wand thought it should. It was familiar, if he thought about it, if only because it had never quite fit him. Just a little too short, the grip worn down in the shape of someone else’s fingers, the way it seemed disinterested in how his magic flowed through it. Like it had stopped caring all that much after his brother gave it away and was just along for the ride. He didn’t remember what it was that his brother had done to wear off the tip and expose the unicorn core inside, but the sight of it made his stomach ache.
Draco closed the case of an ancient roll of wampum and climbed his ladder to store it in the shelves high above the windows. They both knew he wouldn’t go, he never did, but she asked anyway because she knew he never liked to answer. “He’ll tell me tomorrow,” was all he could say, as the box slid into place, “and everyone else in the Library while he’s at it.”
She’d only been gone an hour, just to go down and collect the traps for dinner, but an hour was more than enough for several jumps. He was just going to revisit a few places, just to observe, no changes, nothing important that would need too much writing. He had promised not to get lost in his work.
Ron could close his eyes and see how his room would change in the years to come, but for now his ceiling was bare. It felt… like it was actually sinking in.
The book was still on his stomach, a weight every time he breathed. He felt the impression of the hard cover against his tense fingers.
The ragged end of the wand gave off a little spark that he had thought he’d never see again outside of plugging in whatever ‘repaired’ appliance his father had stolen from a muggle rubbish pile to fiddle with. The words that started to scatter across the page didn’t really follow what he was used to seeing with the spell, when he made copies of notes and files at work, those went quickly across the page one ordered line after another like some invisible hand was writing them fast as could be; these however were like a disturbed nest of ants hiding under a flower pot, scattering in all directions desperately clutching eggs. It was still fast, and the words did seem to be lining up in something of a readable order, but it was chaotic and disturbing enough that Ron jerked back and threw the book off his lap with a high whiny little noise of alarm.
Was it a side effect of the spell? He didn’t remember his brothers ever mentioning the note copying spell could hold memories, but it made sense in a way. The spell copied entire books, though much to his wife’s frustration it did not share the knowledge, but somewhere in the mind the copied text was stored. He’d never imagined trying to tract it down and capture it in a pensieve, just imagining how much WORK that would take made his head hurt, and he’d never even heard of anyone SWALLOWING someone else’s pensieve the way Ron had just done.
It made his eyes cross. These were nothing in comparison the the journal he had read, which had been more like a private diary detailing his many incremental changes and how the present time reacted to them, or noting down who did what and where and at what time. He realized, as he skimmed through yet another list of points including ‘positions and timeframes’ that those jumps were primarily so that Malfoy could observe these incidents from all angles.
Draco gasped, mouth working like a fish, but the pain already stole his voice. Ron could see it now, the slow clean parting of the flesh, like some invisible knife was opening him up. Ron uncorked the first of the handful of dittany vials he’d swiped from the cabinet and began pouring it as the wounds opened, racing the lines, trying to anticipate based on his last two jumps where they would open.
“They won’t heal.” Draco seemed to be losing strength, or maybe just his will to keep talking. “The dittany bought some time, but they will come back. They’re in a time loop Weasley, there’s no saving me from this.”
“Dittany,” Ron said, uncorking the next vial and reapplying it as the first slice reopened, “I carry it since I got splinched, it worked last time, so I grabbed more.”
They passed him by without incident, and he went back to staring out onto the unbroken line of water, far far far away from any location he could conceivably apparate to.
Ron stared down at him, at the vacant blue eyes and the slack face, and swore. Fuck you Malfoy.” He said bitterly, because that was really all he could say. He’d thought, he had really thought, but it hadn’t made a difference after all.
Harry laughed, not loudly, but his eyes scrunched up and his mouth went wide and his shoulders started to shake as he breathed brokenly through his nose in little huffs. Ron was happy to see it, in the sky with no one to hit he could turn and watch as some fragment of cheer came to life in his best friend.
His wand continued to roll between his fingers but he was struggling to actually sit up and cast the spell. He should, he had to, obviously the answer would be in the journal, and obviously the journal wasn’t for first year so he should probably get a different book if he didn’t want to ruin the one on his stomach, but the actual action of stoping his fingers, getting up, getting a book, and casting the spell seemed beyond him.
(The name Jorge is pronounced hoar-hay, other than that you will learn as Ron does, from Draco’s memories.)
“-Hell Malfoy” his mouth finished the words, and he blinked, staring down at the corpse in the room.
Draco hadn’t resurfaced though, even after the article ran alongside the coverage of the Malfoy trial. Public opinion of them was mixed but the good thing about not being trusted and openly ridiculed early on by the Dark Lord was that Lucius had not been granted the honor of participating in anything but the housing of political prisoners. There was still a long line of Death Eaters to be tried and punished, the magical community had more than enough targets to focus their vengeance on, so it wasn’t more than a week before the resentment was drowned by vindication as judgment was passed on the next, and the next, and the next.
“I just need all the books.” He reassured himself. “I don’t have to follow Malfoy’s plans, I know what happened best of us anyway.” He hadn’t expected the memories to come with them, so it shouldn’t matter that they were unpredictable.
The doors had been replaced, and all the shattered windows too, the bonnet was removed, but there was a new one in the corner, unpainted, ready to be put in place.
They never did, and he was beginning to suspect he was in fact the only magical presence here, on this one boat, beyond the reach of any authority hunting him. Somehow instead of relief it terrified him more. A lone wizard among muggles.
He had to rip the plain white shirt, saying “Why couldn’t you have worn one of those stupid button-up ones you always liked,” as he set to trying to stay the blood flow. It wasn’t natural, a white shirt and trousers, scuffed steel-toe boots, a muggle billfold had been among his personal effects for merlin’s sake. He’d almost pulled a Harry and assumed Malfoy had faked the whole thing.
“You can’t mean to say you were so very far into the future?” Draco brushed off his distress with a casual sniff.
The last memory had been much more straight forward, just Draco amending a few file numbers he had apparently come across in another jump, about Buckbeak’s case, if he decided to follow along with that whole incident. Take out the book, update the case numbers, put the book back, nothing much else in Draco’s mind except the long scrawl of legalities.
If Ron took all the things in the trunk, the pills, the hastily duplicated journal, the time turner in the gear shift, and set them all on fire or banished them to the ether he didn’t think he’d lose one thing important in his life. They had loved and losses and grieved before, a childhood’s worth, a war’s worth, and they had picked up the pieces and moved on.
So far he had the main journal for fourth year and three reference books, 2 for fifth and one for third, and of the memories involved he knew Malfoy had ridden a boat, gone to an American school, become their librarian, was close with a woman named Bernadette that he called “Dimples” who was either a teacher or other school staff, and a man who had yet to fully appear named Clavel whose impression in that one fleeting flashback had been of sturdy warmth and steady grief and bottomless rage. A line of strength beside Draco as they looked everywhere but at each other in a star crowded night thousands of years in the past.
Yet while the ministry had been appeased, Harry Potter had not. Harry Potter had near exploded in a fit of questions and demands and accusations. Ron had thought he was prepared for it, thought he knew how obsessively Harry had searched for Draco, but the raw betrayal in his friend’s face when he learned that Ron had found Draco Malfoy and kept it secret. It had cut him, probably as painfully as Draco’s own wounds.
The strain on her face came back in an instant and she had shoved a hand through her hair and looked like she wanted to cry. “He used to go on trips, chasing down leads.” She confessed after a moment. “He’s hired so many private investigators over the years I swear he could start his own firm. I used to try to understand, he’s the type who needs to do what’s right or he can’t justify existing, but its been ten years Ron. This obsession, I thought it would go away, that it was like in school and eventually he’d move on. Narcissa has, she’s accepted it, even though she never says, she accepted that he might be dead a long time ago. Harry bringing it up, it hurts her, and I try… tried to make him understand that she needed to be allowed to move on but he just never gave up. Ever time, EVERY TIME Ron,” she raised her voice with such bitterness, “he would get some tip from his little network and spend days searching it gave them hope, and every time it led to nothing it was like she was realizing he was dead all over again.”
She’d turned to him, this once powerful woman, and looked at the man she saw as her husband with eyes of despair. Lucius was supposed to be in Azkaban, the breakout wouldn’t happen for a few more hours, but Draco didn’t bother to worry about this one discrepancy, he wanted to see his mother, had never stopped wanting to see her. He stood before her, a man of near 30, and wanted to run to her as keenly as he had as a child tormented by the very birds he’d just ordered the elves to rescue.
He’d been sitting on his bed staring down at the blank notebook, his wand raised and ready to cast, waiting for something to happen after he had swallowed the pensieve capsule. He didn’t know if it would happen right away, or if it would take time, or if he would even be able to tell if anything was different at all.
The title of the chapter is because the first stages of Draco’s formation in Ron’s mind feels like intrusive thoughts, some so minor you can’t really tell they aren’t yours until you have a very jarring reaction to them. How Draco talks to Ron is a lot like how my own intrusive thoughts talked to me. Once I started imagining my Intrusive thoughts with a shape they started becoming easier to deal with, especially the more uncomfortable ones.
It wasn’t far to his room, opposite the chaos of two dozen hungry teenagers, and with all the protection spells and silencing charms he didn’t allow in the library. It had been an old storage closet when he’d first started teaching, a place to keep the most delicate and precious of the easily damaged items they had reclaimed, before there became too many of them to keep in one space.
“I think you should paint it blue.” He said, and Ron raised a brow in question. “The car, it should be grey-blue. Like his eyes.” He tilted his head with a grimace disguised as a smirk. “A homage I guess.”
“Bonswa. Don’t suppose I can pull you away from your little project tonight?” A voice, low and melodic, spoke from the doorway and Draco greeted her with a smile. Bernadette’s wild hair was somehow more of a disaster, reminding Draco uncomfortably of Granger in small painful moments, like stepping on a thumbtack or stubbing a toe in the dark. “We’re celebrating our victory in Shaonàxën, and Jorge wants to recount his winning shot for the millionth time to someone who hasn’t heard it the entire 3 hour bus ride.”
He’d reached for her, but her eyes had gone hard and furious, a twisted hatred that Draco had never seen in her, and she turned away striding along with head high and shoulders firm.
Heh, he had a bedtime again. Ron flopped back on his bed staring up at his ceiling, exposed wood a familiar comfort. He and Harry had spelled quidditch posters to the ceiling the summer before the Quiditch World Cup, and more added after even with all the chaos of that night attack. He’d not done much before that, though his walls had some of his childhood decorations, posters he’d loved in his brother’s rooms that they gave him as they got new things, drawings they’d done, the wrappers of some of his favorite candy with witty jokes or inspirational sayings he’d wanted to save at some point. A few of his chocolate frog cards when he had first started collecting them and hadn’t wanted his mother to throw them away but before he’d gotten them their case. All making a patchwork attempt at decorations, sticky charms his parents had place for him or his brothers had cast for him in secrecy. Next summer it will be filled with Cannons posters and newspaper clippings, eventually Sirius would make his way to the wall via his adorable little sister trying to terrify him and never come down until Ron moved out.
“I told him you were my partner and a damn good one, that you made a living taking down Dark Lords every month and if there were none to be found we fashioned them from scarecrows. Then on the weekends you did naked cartwheels on tropical beaches with the entire Harpies Quidditch Team.”
“Draco!” Bernadette dumped her crawfish traps on the wood floor and had him in her arms before he even noticed she’d returned. “Draco look at me. Look.” She forced his face up, her hands were hot as tears, the tears that wouldn’t come. “Ça çé mové you are so old cher, what happened?”
“I’m Not Going back to fix your mistakes” says Ron, who then realizes his life is kinda perfect but goes back in time anyway specifically to fix Draco’s mistakes.
Pointing he wand at the notebook he still had in his lap he cast the second part of the copying spell, “Transcripo Sensus”.
Impressions: feels aversion to boats, uncomfortable during memory of boat as well as prom invitation, feels fond of students, feels loss as they graduate, isolated from rest of wizarding world, does he never leave the school? Where is school location? What is school name?
It wouldn’t be a bad thing to fail, it wasn’t a bad place he ended up, but it also wasn’t his place to be.
Ron stared back at the corpse, at the pool of blood and the one opened vial of dittany that had been as useless this time as before- the DITTANY. It had WORKED. Or at least, it had to have delayed Malfoy’s fate somewhat. Maybe if he was faster, if he could keep Malfoy from straining his injuries and used both bottles as fast as possible.
“Merlin Malfoy, do you think I’ve the skills to do this myself?” Ron gagged as the freshly healed parts of the wounds started to peel apart in front of his very eyes. “This is so far beyond anything I can handle.”
Because he hadn’t really realized it would be the first time. To him it was the last time. The only time. His only chance to save Malfoy, and when it had failed… he’d been frustrated and angry but he had expected it.
So he had cut them a deal while they were still in the dark, and Harry had agreed to table the article until after they had gone to trial and been granted leniency. The Malfoys would pay dearly for their crimes, it would just happen to be in a large sum of money and information about Death Eater activities. In exchange they would not see Azkaban and Draco, wherever he may be, would be fully pardoned.
Now here they were, sitting in the old unpainted Ford Anglia that Ron had only just finished the repairs on. He’d somehow managed to clean the auto shop of evidence before the Aurors had arrived, had gathered Draco and Theo’s pensieve pills, copied and erased the journal, and in what he thought of as a moment of temporary madness had doctored Draco’s books to include Ron as the owner of the car.
The case had a weight to it that he had only felt when handling the cursed items in his home, something that did not feel physical, not a heaviness that pulled at his arms, but a weight that settled in the very core of him.
Ron also knew, from the second and third journal he’d made, that Malfoy had the habit of going back and double checking his work. The second journal had given Ron even less of a glimpse into Malfoy’s mind then the third, not even adding anything. Malfoy had only flipped open the book, tapped his finger against Harry’s trial date, then flipped it all closed and cast his spell. Nothing but vague frustration that he even had to look it up, then Ron was back to his room.
With a sigh Ron rubbed at his eyes, scratchy from lack of sleep, and cast a tempus. It was early enough in the morning to still be considered middle of the night, but barely, and Ron still had a dauntingly large amount of blue pills to work through and a towering pile of textbooks.
“I couldn’t save him,” Ron had told Hermione when she asked why he’d done it, “I’ll save his reputation, at least.” They didn’t speak about how that reputation was a lie, one that Ron had been against from the start. Now he was taking the first step.
“I thought he was making a big deal out of it, I thought ‘Merlin Malfoy if you don’t want to do it just come out of hiding yourself,’. I was so fucking frustrated with him.” He felt that frustration now, as he shifted gears leaving the rural roads behind them and heading towards London. Soon they’d be away from view of any homes or cars and he’d activate the cloaking before taking to the air, for now he just enjoyed the hum of tires over asphalt. “I never thought they’d kill him. I’d never have agreed to wait if I did.” It was astounding how easily he lied.
‘Is it finally hitting home Weasley?’ He thought and rubbed his eyes, sitting back up. He’d been excited as he’d snuck through his parents’ home to collect his books and decipher Malfoy’s journals, but as he’d sat with the patchwork of research slowly appearing in front of him, so very different from the Diary that had led him to trust Draco Malfoy in the first place, with two out of four of the books giving him memories he didn’t understand and the other two nothing at all, he found that maybe there were a few doubts.
Though as he snuck in and out of Percy’s room, who was likely to have the most uselessly filled and discarded notebooks, he came to face another problem he’d not quite accounted for.
“But I was careless, I keep track of all my jumps, I made sure I knew where I was at all times, but after Nott…” Draco shook his head. “He found out my plans. He was okay with changing a few things, things to benefit us, ways to save face or better our prospects, but starting over? Changing everything? That was too much.” His mean little smile went nasty, “So I obliviated him. Should have known though,” he lay back down, resting his hands on his stomach, “that he would keep the prototype.”
But at least through this he understood something of Malfoy’s mentality. He was fucking bat shit is what he was.
“I’m dying Weasel,” Draco spat, and a bit of blood bubbled to his lips to punctuate that, “if you spoke with me you are running out of time, take it off.”
year history of magic, barely held on by a few stubborn threads of the binding. He knew his mother had repaired them as much as she could, but there was only so much she could do year after year until they finally reached him. He knew his sister, at least, would get a few in better condition which had infuriated him as a child but was reassuring him now as he wiggled the cover and watched one of those threads give up the ghost and leave the top corner fully free.
“Someone has to help Mione with Nott, and since I married her guess that’ll be me.” He said, not really remembering if that’s what he had said before. He stared down at the open file, the arrest report of one Theodore Nott, who had been found acting erratic, aggressive, and showing signs of being obliviated. With a Time Turner on his person. Harry laughed, and Ron came around his desk to crouch down by the fireplace, folder in hand and strained smile on his face. He knew what day it was now, and what time, and he didn’t have the luxury of a chat. “You take your girl, mate, I’ll handle mine.”
Ron blinked, and then gaped, and then made a high frustrated sound in the back of his throat. “What?”
“Crossing yourself,” Malfoy supplied, and that answered the question of what that term meant, “You would have, if you still had the prototype on, but once you took it off time caught up with you, instead of the other way around.” He circled a finger in the air, “This is your time now, congratulations, welcome to the present.”
He thinks that it had been that moment he had decided to go back in time. Guilt maybe, and a weird sense of duty. Harry was his best mate, close as brothers, and Ron had never even known how deeply he had felt the loss of his schoolyard rival. Ron had lived quite pleasantly this past decade without the perpetual threat of the pointy faced menace, and Hermione had no shortage of ignorant heads to butt against among the ministry as she championed her magical creatures rights campaign.
“I didn’t know how to feel.” She admitted when he pressed. “I wanted someone to pay, we are all hurting so much and we need people to pay for it, to find some closure. Bellatrix is gone, Voldemort is gone, but the scar is still here.” She traced her arm, and Ron pulled her more firmly against him as she cried. “I didn’t know what I wanted. She saved Harry, it terrifies me what could have happened, sometimes I think about it and there’s so many ways it could have gone wrong. He died, he came back but he died and there’s no assurance he would survive again. I think about it so much I can’t breathe. He was helpless and hurting and alone and she’s the only one who could save him, and I hate her anyway. I think,” she had a wretched look on her face as she met his eyes, “I think I hate her more for helping him while I couldn’t then I hate all of them for anything else.” She confessed. “I didn’t now how to feel, so I didn’t know what to do but…” she crumpled the paper in her lap and let her head fall back, eyes closed, “but I think I’m relieved now. I didn’t have to make any choice at all, and for some reason it doesn’t feel as terrible as I thought it would.”
Hermione was his guiding light, he’d decided that early on, nothing he changed could change THEM, not so long as he didn’t let it. They were a team, the most perfect team, and this time he’d be everything she could possibly need for all the time they had together and not make such an ass of himself. Hermione wouldn’t let him down, certainly not when it came to books, he was sure this next one would be exactly what he needed, and there wasn’t a more perfect home for it then Hogwarts A History.
His hands gripped the wheel, that little prick of pain like he’d been running too fast for too long urging him to ask one final question.
He smiled and gave the car a light pat, then looked back at Draco, who was still dead. He knew the seconds were ticking down, he’d be pulled back soon, so why not indulge a little? It wasn’t like Draco could say anything. He opened the car door and slid into the seat, Merlin, but he had wanted his own car for AGES. Hermione of course, being a muggle born, had dismissed the idea as a frivolous expense, muggles used cars out of necessity, wizards could floo or apperate.
Draco didn’t have favorites, whatever Bernadette and the others liked to say, but every year there was one or two that hovered a little closer in his personal space then he intended, needed a little more of his attention. Demaurius hadn’t really done more than any other student, wasn’t even the type of smart-assed or petulant student Draco usually found himself drawn to, trying to untie the knots they tied themselves up in. Demaurius had simply taken up too much space, been too big and too quiet and too intimidating as he struggled with his schoolwork at a table that none of the student assistants had wanted to approach him. So Draco had been the one to sit with him, thinking the children so silly. Demaurius was a little wider about the shoulders but a full head shorter then Greg or Vince.
“I didn’t break the bloody law to travel back just to not save your pasty ass you-” Malfoy cut him off by putting a blood coated hand on his cheek and forcibly turning his head to the side, towards the array of muggle items in the corner of the shack.
The air wasn’t helping, his room felt like a prison and the deck felt too vulnerable, too exposed. He had never been on any wizarding ship, his family had never seen the need. If they wanted to travel they did so by portkey, spending days or weeks packed into the confines of a ship with other families, even rich families, was not something a Malfoy would do.
What is a Prom? Students participating in Prom, Malfoy declines invite. Carrying formal wear but not wearing them during transport, mentions of boat.
It was one hell of a mess, Ron had thought himself prepared, he’d seen the evidence when he had first walked the crime scene with his father to collect the illegally modified muggle equipment, but there was a very big difference between dry black bloodstains and an actively growing pool beneath a still living body.
Ron glared at the offending item where it lay, still open and ready for its next update on Malfoy’s desk. Detailing the date of his latest time-travel experiment, the one that would cost him his life.
‘He’d notice and raise hell though,’ Ron reminded himself, ‘if Wormtail didn’t out you through the door.’
“Damn it Malfoy.” He kicked out at Draco’s leg, but there was no reaction. There wouldn’t be, not ever again.
Must Find Potter. Potter will not abandon if suitably upset or endangered, if possible seek opportunity to sustain injury or save other from injury for additional leverage.
“Did he say anything?” Harry’s voice was breathless, as though afraid to ask at all and wanting it over quickly. “About me?”
He could see it, his years stretching ever on in this place, with teachers and students coming and going, languages being found and lost again, sacred items being fought for and won or lost to museums and collectors, teenagers working through their highest and lowest moments in the conversation pits with the blankets and pillows hand crafted by students who came long before.
The students were dancing, he could hear the beat of the drums through the walls, through the silencing charms and muffling spells and noise canceling padding of the library, you could always hear the drums in this school, like a pulse, be it the work of magic or ghosts or just good acoustics the drums always carried.
“Why?” Ron passed over a roll of gauze as Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, leaving smears of blood.
“Malfoy?” Speaking out loud, the jarring sound of a voice in the quiet, made him very aware that he had not been
‘I think its better’ Ginny had whispered, wracked in guilt as the great looming threat she had faced every time Draco Malfoy’s memory had sent Harry off on an obsessive chase had finally been laid in the ground forever.
It had been like this since Harry and Ginny had come back two weeks ago, a sudden and disorienting change from the month of near daily firecalls once Harry had learned of Draco’s death. It had been similar to the last time with Ron and Hermione carefully omitting any mention during the first few days then too; uncertain as how Harry would react to it. Now even though Ron knew: denial, anger, frustration, demanding answers and short on patience for how slow the investigation was going, he had still hesitated.
But it had only taken that moment, an instant of separation, just a meter or two of space. When he looked back up at his mother’s sharp cry it was to see his parents surrounded by Aurors.
Was this how Potter gathered his little cult? Draco wondered as he looked into the dark eyes, so black he couldn’t tell the iris from the pupil, of a student who seemed so invested in a simple, unimportant librarian.
“Useless,” Draco hissed, “A prototype, Nott was to destroy it,” he said with an anger unfitting someone who had double crossed his partner himself. “Do you remember the note copying spell your brother’s made?” Ron nodded, “Take the 7 pills, not at once, in the blue jar, they are my other journals. You’ll need them. When you remove your time turner your memories will begin to unravel, you’ll need them.”
He rolled up, and wow didn’t that feel good to just bounce right up in bed no creaky back no extra padding around the gut, and snagged his wand, casting the quietest of silencing charms and lumos, shoving his glowing wand into a discarded shirt to dim it enough to sneak about without blinding anyone.
Ron stood on shaky legs, not quite ready to let go of his anger. Not quite ready to let go at all. Death wasn’t new to him, but it really wasn’t anything he was comfortable with.
The wand in his pocket felt vile, he loathed to use it even as he shoved his hands into his stolen jumper and cast his usual array of spells to ensure the nosy parents of the wildly screaming children did not pay too close attention to him, having well learned his lesson about being an unaccompanied teenager on this deck.
The aftermath was a vague blur that he still didn’t know how he pulled off. Lying to the Aurors and the ministry, to Kingsley, to his WIFE, about how he had stumbled upon Draco in an online forum for wizards interested in cars. The wizarding community was still behind in the ways of the internet and it had been no great hardship to fabricate and backdate an email correspondence between the two of them under the usernames of Redkingreckoning and greyeyesoffwhitewyvern, which Ron thought was a great use of wit and pretension for a username that displayed Draco’s knowledge of muggle pop-culture since the git had been living as one,  but few in the ministry got the reference and it made him want to pull his hair out. The email conversations began in an eagerly chaotic back and forth, like the honeymoon stage of all internet friendships that moved from public forums to private messaging. They spoke of Quidditch and chess and cars and eventually their personal lives without naming real names. Ron had been up through the night worrying about how Draco should sound, matching his image of the man in the journal to the one bleeding out under his hands to the boy he knew in school until finally deciding that Nott was the only person they knew who could actually call him on his bullshit and created a Frankenstein character in Draco’s place that somewhat resembled all three.
Look at him, big tough Auror, how many stakeouts had he been through, hours he’d pushed through pouring over paperwork or standing watch, and he could barely keep his eyes open. Sure it was past 2 in the morning, but he’d slept enough given his bedtime.
“Last-?” Draco’s eyes crawled down to his chest where the time turner swung on its chain, “How did you?!” He surged up, grabbing at the device and pulling it hard, and Ron along with in.
Ron sat crossed legged on his bed, fourth book in his hand now, and let what he’d just seen settle into his thoughts as he watched Draco’s careful fluid handwriting overtake a battered 2
“I think, the time to save himself would have been when he met you.” Harry finally answered, meeting Ron’s eyes and there was a resolve there, a firm understanding of where they’d go from here. “I think Draco had all the chances we could give him. I don’t think Time Travel would have helped him more.”
He just needed Book 1, to get an idea of Malfoy’s plans, he’d get the rest sorted eventually. After all, he didn’t plan on using hand-me-downs for long.
Instead Ron gripped the wheel of his car, still unpainted and still dented but returned to him by the ministry, his father had helped him reattach the bonnet and the windshield wipers just that morning, and he tried not to think about the time turner Draco had said was in the gear shift.
He blinked again, frowning and the wand finally stilled. The irritation at himself wasn’t… what t normally was when he was caught between actions like this.
Ron did, and felt.. felt sturdier. He hadn’t even realized he had felt so off, or perhaps he had just disregarded it as part of his breakdown earlier, but with the time turner no longer around his neck it was like everything came into focus.
Taking up his and and the pill bottle he closed his eyes, wishing upon his wife’s beautiful face like he’d wish on a star, and chose blindly.
Harry studied him for a while, wheels turning in his head. Harry was probably thinking of the time turner in the bowels of the ministry, of five minutes to change or save a life, to alter everything forever. “I..” he looked like he couldn’t find the words and the moment stretched endlessly, then he sighed and fell, it seemed, into defeat. “He wasn’t ever going to change,” Harry spoke into the world a truth they all knew, but speaking it felt like a betrayal of everything they all worked for. “I don’t want to say he wasn’t worth saving, but I don’t think he’d have changed if he hadn’t been a victim to it himself.” And that was the thing, wasn’t it, a person shouldn’t have had to fear for their own life to acknowledge that condemning others to death was wrong. “After the war.. I don’t know. I don’t know how I could have done more for him. One moment he was there, giving me his wand, then he was gone, and not even his parents knew where.”
But he hadn’t decided on what point that was yet. Ron flopped back onto his bed as he realized this.
Of course Ron was questioned, and upon producing the emails was questioned even more, why had he not revealed Draco Malfoy’s whereabouts, why had he not alerted the Ministry of his Father’s lost illegal car, what had Draco been worried about? And finally, how had he known Draco was in danger?
And he highly doubted Draco Malfoy had a contingency plan drawn up for THAT childhood trauma. Though, if he was stalking them all through their Hogwarts years to plot out their positions and timeframes he probably knew more than enough.
Ron flipped the journal closed and stalked towards the muggle machinery, the same old beat up car he had last seen as a teen. How Malfoy had recovered his parent’s flying car he’d never know, but that the thing was gutted and sitting in a corner under a tarp had hurt. It had saved his life, his and Harry’s, and Malfoy had been picking it apart like a scavenger bird.
“You sound like tire brakes,” Malfoy scowled at him, “bad ones. Kindly stop doing so in my ear.” Then he sighed and stared back up at the ceiling. “I told you, I was careless, I kept meticulous track of every jump I made, and only jumped to times where I knew my own location. Except, apparently, one, because I had already changed it.” He lifted his hand, flexed his fingers in front of his face, staring at his own blood, or perhaps the lines in his palm. “I locked Myrtle’s bathroom that night, so that Potter wouldn’t catch me in a… delicate moment, and altered my own locations for the following days, as I was no longer hospitalized. Running into myself… Time Travel is not a well developed field, because any changes we make would alter the future, making the need to make such changes unnecessary. Even now your memories of your future-past will be trickling away, until all you have is a vague recollection of some strange feeling, an urgency, to act in the manner you did. The consequences of missteps are… not often recorded.”
Hermione had not spoken a word, her finger tracing over the carving along her wrist. Mudblood. She had opened her mouth several times when Harry had asked her thoughts, but seemed at a loss of what to say. It had fueled Ron’s resentment back then, but as the days passed and Harry had won his battle she had curled against Ron on the couch as she read the paper, then she folded in up and sighed, sagging against him.
Malfoy was a complete and utter mess, with 15 million different contingency plans, and Ron was so very very not prepared for any of what he just got himself into.
The notes went on and on in a similar vein, Ron skimmed after the first 3 pages, feeling that same sick ache in his gut as when he had first seen his second hand wand and it’s exposed core. Malfoy’s methodical plotting of how he could create minor changes in his relationship with Harry, Hermione, and him, mostly focusing on stealing the poor house elf Crouch had been using, and then how to get through Ministry protocols until his father collected him, or how to reunite with his father if they didn’t detain him.
‘If I was visible you’d have seen me by now,’ oh, oh. Ron griped his collar, feeling that subtle flex deep in his throat that came with long internal arguments. ‘Even someone as thick as you can’t miss me in such small quarters. You really lived like this?’
The final piece would be even more so, he was certain he’d pinned down where he’d gone wrong last time. The block that was preventing him from true, permanent time travel. It had been in something Clavel had said, as they stood in this exact spot and watched the stars, 2000 years before the school had ever been built, to prove that they could, stood where glacial ice crept and cracked and carved its way across the world and ancient humans painted murals of their lives on stone for their far distant children to find, and they were not even the oldest. The fires and homes along the river below them were not new to the area, for all that they were not old. The people had been there for generations already, as far back as could be remembered, and were likely lamenting the folly of the youth among them.
If only they had arrested Nott when Malfoy was still alive, instead of tracking their ties and finding the poor bastard’s corpse months old in this… muggle auto shop.
Why would Malfoy make any small changes at all if he intended to completely stop the war? No, someone wanting to win a war wouldn’t plot to save enemies on the other side.
It felt weird, calling it that, but it had not felt like any pensieve he’d ever been in, and as an Investigative Auror he’d been inside enough. No, he’d not been walking inside as an observer, he’d BEEN Draco Malfoy, felt his contentment organizing and locking up for the night, the irritation of being disrupted even by someone he was fond of, the prickle of pain that was recognizing the pieces of others inside someone you cared for. Memory within memory. Ron did not know who Clavel was, but within that memory he knew he was someone important, a co-conspirator and close friend, who carried a grief and rage Draco could never hope to soothe.
It was hard to think that, once upon a time, the school’s entire collection fit into this one small room, an esteemed institution dedicated to preserving magic and culture, shuffled off by the government to be the dumping ground for delinquents none of the other schools would take. Though, it had been that disparaging attitude that had let Draco slip in under the radar and a fake name, and a box of illegal wands.
Ron had asked Ginny, just the morning before he had gone and stolen the time turner out of Hermione’s desk. It was their anniversary, and Ron had begged several people to call her away so he could infiltrate her office and surprise her. It had been a moment of bright cheer in Grimmauld Place that morning as Harry and Ginny had set aside the strained grief that smothered them and helped him plan. He had felt a touch guilty for deceiving them, but the only way to access the time turner would be for Hermione to hastily store it in her office after she had removed it to study, and it wasn’t like he hadn’t planned to fill her office with so many flowers it was hard to walk in anyway. It would only be a moment out of time, and though Ron wasn’t certain it was a good cause he was certain it was a necessary one. Still, he had taken a moment in the kitchen with Ginny as Harry had run back upstairs to fetch Hermione’s gift, Ron was currently wearing his, a fancy timepiece he didn’t want to know the price of. He had asked her about Harry, and Malfoy, and how it was all holding together.
“Of course you didn’t.” Malfoy mocked, then closed his eyes and breathed. “For serious injuries you really should put it directly on the wound, as you were doing, however this is not a normal injury.” Draco ran a hand from his chin to his navel, where the lines were… still weeping blood but they looked more like cat scratches now, very large cat scratches. “It shouldn’t exist.”
He was cold, his fingers like ice rubbing themselves to get feeling back but all he felt were the prickling static beneath his skin. Sensation of touch gone.
Ron had nodded his head firmly and the conversation switched to who would babysit his children that night just as Harry came through the door loaded down with breathlessly expensive books and the first smile they’d seen on him since before Ron had broke the news.
Only it wasn’t a corpse, and it was staring back. Draco Malfoy, laying exactly where he had left him, with a growing pool of blood and squinted open raw red eyes. Ron gaped, looking down at the time turner, which was indeed still running, then over to the car, still sitting quiet and ruined without wheels or a bonnet.
The reference books seemed to have all the actual important information, every point in this seemed to call back to lines of thoughts in those, with little notes in the margins to recheck book 3 if such and such action had or had not taken place or if he jumped previously or if it somehow hadn’t worked out, and circled sections reminding what was actually important and not to get distracted by who and why and how some task wasn’t going to plan.
He was running out of time, the five minute countdown was sure to be running low, and then he’d be back in his own time and having to face his wife and eventually Harry when he came back from Ginny’s tournament. Tell them he broke the law and risked getting fired, or Azkaban, to save the ferret.
These memories within memories that came with the journals were hard to really get his head around. When he focused on the memory it all seemed very simple and straight forward, except that Ron had no idea who Bernadette was or Clavel or any of the students Draco interacted with, they sat like a word he couldn’t quite remember but couldn’t fully get his point across without, frustrating and unable to move forward.
Skipping over the very ruined history of magic he stifled a yawn that made his ears pop and browsed the rest of his hoard. He really should have risked any alarm Pettigrew would have raised to sneak into Percy’s room, though the knowledge of the rat still being with his family sat like lead in his stomach, to try for Percy’s greedy little stash of notebooks. He remembered even in his school years how Percy never let go of any of his past notes, not to let them read or be reused. Even his first year journals had sat dust free in their own little place on his bookshelf.
The bus headed off after that, two long yellow boxes that Draco and Clavel did their best to keep rattling on for just one more year. Just one more year. Just one more year.
Unfortunately Draco’s journals only changed the inside writing of the books, the battered and tattered appearance did not improve and Ron was doubting the more he switched over if he should trust something so important to the dubious stability of his brothers’ castoffs.
“Then how did you… how do you remember?” Ron indicated the room, and then to the desk, where the journal lay. “Is that why you keep the diary?”
Ron could tell him the exact feel of grit and condensation turned slime on stone and iron bars, the taste of metal in his mouth and the ache in his throat as he threw himself against his bindings, desperate for Hermione. The rage and pain and horror of hearing her tortured beyond his reach.
He didn’t look like himself. Maybe it was the stress, the lost weight, the way his bones were so sharp against his pale face, maybe it was the ink he had dumped all over his hair in blind panic as he had spotted his reflection in that dingy muggle loo his parents had ushered him into to change out of his school clothes. His mother had been so alarmed when he had come out, hair stiff and black, face smudged where he had tried to rub at his eyebrows. He had tried to explain, that they were too noticeable, that they hadn’t a wand between the three of them for glamours or charms, his father could pass for a graying man but his hair was too noticeable and he was going to get them caught before they’d even reached whatever location they’d set up to escape.
One more book, he promised himself, and made an anxious little spectacle of choosing just which book it was. Though it didn’t mater, of course, because he’d do the rest later, the fact that this was the last for the night made it feel like it had to make up for the others.
“I didn’t mean to look,” he said, and a bead of a tear touched his lower lashes, a sensation that felt like a single too tight strand of hair in a ponytail painfully tugging at him. He could still hear her screams.
“No no no,” she cast warming charms on her rain poncho and threw it around him, rubbing his hands between hers and breathing on them, he could smell the oil she used in her hair and it grounded him like he was biting into a cold tart fruit. “Let’s get you off the floor, come on, up up up.” She tried to pull him by his numb hands but his body didn’t move.
The rest of the emails were short after that, one or two a week instead of the whole conversations every day, and no longer on good terms. Ron tried to make it obvious that they now knew each other’s identity, though they only referred, when they did need to call each other anything, by the age old nicknames of Weasel and Ferret. The emails painted a terse, vague story of their purely professional mutual interest in restoring the car.
Draco’s memories will still come over from the penny pills but from her on out they will be filtered through the area of Ron’s mind that Draco will inhabit, like a book to be opened and closed. He is not an alter created by Rons mind, but an imprint of himself left over from his own memories, he has no control over Rons actions or movements no acts more like a backseat driver in Rons ear.
“He’d been gone so long, afraid so long, I don’t think he knew how to come back. Muggles didn’t know about him, didn’t judge him, he was safe. Until someone found him.” Ron covered her hands with his other one, they were cold and gripped him so tightly, like he was her last lifeline. Just off a ways Harry and Andromeda stood silently, facing each other like they were in conversation, but listening intently to his every word. “I didn’t know who, but he was being pressured into something.” Another lie, but Ron wasn’t supposed to know they’d tied it to the Nott case yet. “And it was starting to scare him, I know they threatened to reveal him, and he… if he was going to live like a wizard again he wanted to face you first. He made me promise not to say anything until he told you.” Ron squeezed her hands, “He was going to tell you.”
He wandered to it, flipping the pages back to the passage that made his decision for him, though the whole rotten thing had been one guilt trip after another.
“We arrested Nott,” Ron explained, “He was obliviated, and had this on him.” Ron pried Draco’s weakening fingers off the device and swung it around to his back as he worked, focusing again on the injuries that just kept reopening. “You need St. Mugo’s, I should have owled them before I came, I don’t think I can side along you and keep you alive at the same time.”
Malfoy family fled to port (where they were apprehended) Draco Malfoy disguised with black hair. Small case full of wands, 11 in total, cursed? Malfoy uses wand to confuse muggles on ship and flee Britain.
It took some doing, sneaking in and out, and some quiet contemplation as he lamented not having a Marauders Map of his own home and the obstacles he ran into or stepped on, the realization and mental ransacking of his own memories to recall if his brothers had ever told them WHEN exactly they found the map and if they had it with them now, and the likelihood of success should he try to steal it. Eventually he made it back to his room with an armful of old textbooks, discarded paperbacks, and beyond salvageable notebooks slated for transfiguring or kindling depending on the need.
“Oh, yes.” Ron dumped his bag out, bandages and wraps and vials of potions scattering on the floor. Draco groaned as he turned on his side and raised himself on an elbow, snatching up the closest vial and reading the label before uncorking it and drinking that. “I… didn’t know you could do that.”
“I don’t get much time to work on it.” Was all he could say to her, and she just tilted her pretty round face to the side and pursued her lips into a loud raspberry. Her tiny studded nose piercing winking from white to green. Her hair styled in loose ringlets were coiling like agitated serpents as the stress and excitement of the day frizzed them back to their tight curls and they  bounced as she stood and swung around the desk, many ringed hands flapping at the air about her head like she was shooing at birds trying to nest in it. Though he had often compared her to a strange combination of the worst of Pansy and Granger, neither would have the complete lack of dignity to stomp out of the room attempting to make fart noises to the beat of distant drums. “Pttttb Ptttbt Pttttthhhhhbbbbtttt” she stuck her head back in one last time to jut her tongue directly at him, cross her eyes, and bast one long line at him until all her air was gone.
“He was going to see you,” Ron lied again so easily, hadn’t even meant to except that he couldn’t bear to let her leave thinking her son had lived just a few kilometers away and not found her worthy of his visit. “It was what we fought over the most, coming out of hiding. When I, the last time we met he said… that he didn’t know how.” Ron recalled the journal, a line from a day he hadn’t seen as important. Draco had gone to the manor some point in the summer after 6
“I’m not going to fix your life for you.” Ron told him, though it probably wasn’t something someone should say to a dying person. Draco cracked one bloodshot eye at him and managed to grin.
“Not you,” Draco scoffed, “You just take the journals, find something else to give my memories to, and not me either. I’ll be no help to you even with them.”
Ron rolled onto his back, lungs straining from his pillow, and stared at the shadowed planks of his ceiling. An attic room, with exposed beams that he had hit his head on too often after 5
And he was right, of course he was, and not just because the injury had been magically created. Ron nodded, and Harry clapped his shoulder with a flat smile and furrowed brow that didn’t quite convey any real emotion except that there were emotions involved but anything beyond mere existence didn’t need to be acknowledged. Ron made a strained looking smile back and Harry got out, clearing his throat as he held the door open for one last goodbye.
His mother had touched his face, a gentle rub of her thumb across the blotch on his cheek, and told him they were not without wands. She had given him the slim case then, long as his forearm and half as wide, a glossy black leather that had felt foul and heavy in his hands though it weighed no more than a textbook. Then they were hurrying away, out into the crowds of people along the docks queueing in to board their ships or offload onto the shore.
“If you could…” he swallowed. “If you could go back. To before, the war, or Hogwarts, or even just before he.. died.” He parked in front of the townhome and faced Harry fully, who for the first time in the whole drive faced him back. “Would you? Go back and change things, if you could?”
He felt the pull, not unlike apperating, and knew the time turner was bringing him back, but the car roared to life at the same instant, the door slammed shut and the dials on the dash flinched, jumping up then stabilizing. He could feel the time turner pulling him and he understood why Malfoy had referred to them as ‘jumps’, only instead of the feel of moving forward he could swear it was like sinking. Like the moment he leaned too far back in a chair and it tipped. He gripped the wheel of the car tighter and screwed his eyes shut. “Bloody-“
“I apparated from my office here Malfoy,” Ron ran a bloody hand through his hair, then grimaced when he noticed and began rubbing at his hand with the spare gauze. “How am I going to explain finding you in your own blood when I bring you to St Mugo’s?”
‘Hope that hurt, you greasy piece of shit.’ Flitted through his head just on the wrong side of repulsion, wondering how he could have forgotten that the past also included Scabbers the Rat in its list of people to deal with.
It wasn’t exactly a fair thing to say, Ron had his own experience with a splinching and he knew the victim couldn’t really control how the body reacted to that much trauma, but he wasn’t really feeling gracious bedside manner at the moment.
“You’re going back Weasley,” Draco informed him, and smiled, “or did you think you wouldn’t jump again?” He scoffed at the clueless face but it became a bubbling wet coughing fit halfway through and Ron was too stunned by watching Draco die, again, and the dawning knowledge of what the madman planned, to react. “Don’t tell me there isn’t something you want to change,” Malfoy mocked him, tempted him, “someone you want to save? Some hole in your life you want to refill?”

Potter wand Stolen point 6, Crouch Jr cast Dark Mark point 10, interfere as needed, no important changes must be made re Crch jr & Potter.
Then placing the new one on top of said book 5 he pointed his wand at the finished journal and cast.
“We, ah..” he hadn’t even though of it yet, deciding felt like he was stealing it from Draco, which he absolutely was doing. “We hadn’t settled on one.” He looked back at the car, and counted up his lies figuring one more wouldn’t hurt. “It was something we argued about, friendly arguing, easier to argue about paint then… other stuff.”
“Don’t be an idiot Weasley,” Draco huffed a laugh, “it’s been far longer than five minutes already.”
Time travel was not something that could be fully understood, because time was not a thing that could be studied, only experienced.
Draco cracked open his eyes and stared at him, something like confusion in his pain clouded gaze. He was dressed so normal, Ron couldn’t help but be unnerved by it as he dropped to his knees and got to work. He hadn’t actually seen the body, even when Harry had firecalled him asking him to, ‘to be sure’. He had already been halfway through the journal at that point. He hadn’t the stomach to pay a visit.
He jerked forward, there was no way that had been five minutes already, and opened his eyes. He stumbled against a desk, knocking his thigh into the corner and hissing a swear.
Neither one of them took the time to just… feel. Wallow, Hermione had called it once, wallowing in the feelings instead of fixing the issue and moving on, but being parents, being the caregivers of small bodies with too many emotions to fit inside them and not enough mental capacity or experience to explain them away, it had forced them to reevaluate how they handled things. Family Counseling had helped too.
Ron had never found out what Harry would do when Ginny next had to travel for her game, she’d been allowed home a short week for the funeral but even world shattering revelations did not stop Quidditch. Harry was Ron’s partner, and had returned to work as soon as they hit London, but his obsession with the case had been obvious from the start and Ron had almost gotten into a row with him several times over the slow progress. Harry just couldn’t accept the declaration that Draco Malfoy had died from time travel related splinching, an injury previously unheard of. The only thing the Ministry was interested in about the investigation was if anyone besides Nott and Malfoy were involved, if any research could be uncovered, and in the interest of preserving Harry’s own hard fought image of the Malfoy family as war spies, if Draco was using time travel to assist the dark Lord.
His room was smaller, he’d shoved too many boxes of supplies into the space, but he’d use it all up eventually, once he got around to unpacking it all into the new potions cabinet Demaurius had made for him in class.
He’d miss her, when he finally could go back. He’d miss a lot of people, but he’d miss her the most, her and Clavel.
“Back?” Malfoy rasped, grunting as Ron used the torn shirt to mop off the blood and expose yet another freshly opened slice. “You go back in five minutes.”
He’d taken only a moment to find Hermione and ask her to apparate home. It would be a bit of a drive to Grimmauld Place from the graveyard, Draco had not been buried in the Malfoy plot which was on the Malfoy estate and in the possession of the Ministry. They would have allowed it, had even submitted an inquiry to Narcissa, as stated by Andromeda, into if they would be requesting the opening of a new grave; the Malfoy Manor had been turned into a Museum commemorating the war. Draco Malfoy, however, had been buried in the small plot on Andromeda’s home, beside her husband, daughter, and Remus Lupin. Last time the papers had run the story about how a former death Eater living in hiding plotting the resurrection of the Dark Lord through time travel was being laid to rest beside war heroes, this time Ron made sure Luna led the charge as she dusted off her old type writer and put out the first Quibbler in years since her father’s retirement. Draco would be properly grieved before his ties with the time turner became public knowledge, and remembered as a boy in the jaws of a beast who made the choice no child should, and buried where he belonged, with his family.
Ron scribbled a little note in the binding of the book he’d just used for Book 4, a little mockery of Malfoy’s deranged notation system.
It isn’t a good thing, for a child, to look so intimidating in an environment where the adults tried to maintain absolute authority. So often they were sorted into the pile of ‘problem children’ and never washed the label off.
Ron felt a weight on him now, his stomach a cramped mess of anxiety as he looked to the very very small stack of usable parchment and the dauntingly large number of tiny blue pills still in the bottle.
He’d barely cracked the door when he’d looked Peter Pettigrew in his beady little eyes and the vile little man did what he had done countless times before, he squealed.
“I don’t like boats.” Draco said and his serviceable smile seemed to bite deeper in the corners as he pressed his lips harder together to keep from adding ‘I lost my parents on a boat.’
If book 4 covered to reference book 10, Ron didn’t even want to GUESS how many other books he’d have to read, and non of them were labeled.
“Don’t talk,” Ron ordered, laying Malfoy out and fisting his shirt, tearing it open to expose the wounds. “Don’t talk, don’t move, just concentrate on staying alive Malfoy and you just might do that.”
He wasn’t upset at Malfoy. He was upset because he was back here, again, when he should have been home, and the person who could tell him why had died too fast to help him. Why had he died so fast?
Narcissa closed her eyes as if in pain, and she must be, as a father Ron didn’t think there was any pain so severe then the loss of a child. Then she nodded, swallowed, and blinked her eyes of tears. They rolled down her cheek and into the corner of her mouth so that she tasted them when she wet her lips and tried to thank him again, but her voice was choked by emotion and came out in a weak croak.
“Yeah, its fine,” he said distractedly, glad he was out of view of the fireplace, “just bumped into the desk.” He tried to be casual as he searched the office for an answer to just where he had ended up, eyes alighting on the files spread about.
So somewhere in the mess of theoretical magic Malfoy had used to capture the memory containing the entire magically copied journal, putting it in a pensieve, and turning THAT pensieve into the pretty coloring gel capsules, some of his short term memories had come with.
Later the assessment of Draco’s body would confirm the time looping nature of the cutting curse, and rule that the disparity of time between Ron apparating and calling for help did align with Ron’s insistence that the treatment worked at first and the injury seemed non fatal on first arrival. He had, therefore, not been made to give a pensieve of the encounter.
Draco was a touchy subject, even after all these years. His sudden disappearance after the battle, the manhunt as the Ministry had tried to capture all fleeing DeathEaters, Harry’s near violent arguments with Kingsley and Percy and his dad about Draco and Narcissa’s role in saving them. A fight that had only doubled in intensity once Narcissa and Lucius had been arrested boarding a muggle cruise to Canada. Draco had been nowhere to be found, and no amount of interrogation had made the couple reveal his whereabouts. They had, though, been willing to cut a deal with Kingsley under Harry’s insistent pressure and the threat of an article, drafted by Luna and ready for print in her father’s next paper, of Lady Malfoy’s role in saving Harry’s life and the use of Draco’s wand in Voldemort’s eventual defeat.
Like Ron he’d been pulled, beyond reason, towards that room. Invisible, impossibly small, flying fast as he could to make the closing door.
Hermione, Ron smiled and felt warm just thinking of her. He should probably feel guilty, leaving her and their two children in the distant future, she’d been the main thing keeping him from traveling back that very day Malfoy had died at his feet. How his decisions would change them, their lives, their love. Ron picked up the behemoth of a book and hugged it to his chest, tucking it under his chin and smiling. Yes, this was what he was going to use.
But out here, alone, with endless open ocean around him, even the smell of fish and salt seemed foreign and dangerous.
Then, because he needed the answer, he let his smile fade and studied Harry fully. He could not leave any detail unnoticed, not for this. “I told him you were with Gin,” he said and watched every inch of Harry freeze as if hexed, one long line of tension. “Engaged, but not married. Too much travel, not enough time for a wedding, let alone a honeymoon.”
“Do you know who it was?” Harry asked suddenly, staring out the window of the car as the world passed. Ron breathed deep, trying to be grateful they were talking, that he didn’t have to make the first move. “Who he was afraid of?”
He loved them. He let that soak into him now, let it swell and fill him in a way he’d been promised he was allowed to do by the counselor. He loved his family, his kids, his wife, his friends. He loved Harry, and he loved this life they had all built for themselves. He was not regretful of it, and he knew, with a surety that Harry no doubt felt himself as he sat in this car, that they would grow and heal and move on from this tragedy. Harry and Ginny would marry, Narcissa and Andromeda would continue to devote themselves to Teddy, his father would help him finish fixing the car.
Harry was silent for a while after that, still refusing to look anywhere but the line of distant homes. They came, eventually, to the tree line and Ron checked the rear view for anyone else on the road. It was growing dark, and the shadows of the trees cut slices of overcast sun like the slats of window blinds. He activated the invisibility as they moved from one dark sliver to the next.
“You used the car,” Draco waved a hand in that direction, “The car doesn’t send you back like a time turner, it sends you BACK, all of your memories, your experiences, your…” Draco glanced meaningfully at the prototype time turner, “specifically charmed items. They all go back to a previous you.”
He sat at his desk, a little thing under a loft bed he rarely used, and carefully pried open the old ford truck carburetor he kept mounted on the shelf, where the time turner lay hidden.
Somehow worse was that because of Ron’s affiliation he was not permitted to work the case, which meant Harry was not permitted to work the case, and when they were eventually pulled from Nott’s when the two were linked it left them with nothing to do but snipe at each other. The ministry was no doubt certain there was a third person involved, it was what Ron would suspect, who obliviated Nott and killed Draco, and because Ron had known Draco and hidden it Harry could not hunt them down, was being forced to continue his leave to prevent him from badgering the investigators, and was pacing his home like a caged lion waiting for the chance to strike.
It was a beautiful thing, a near perfect replica of the ones he had seen in the Ministry, but with a few very important changes.
She shrugged, not really bothered. It was hardly the first time she’d tried to use a favorite student to get him to show his face outside the library, and she’d do it again come New Years, and spring break, and graduation. Every sport, every holiday, every celebration she’d poke and prod at his conscious, but they never worked. She’d been doing it since they were students here themselves, and would continue until they were old and hunched and snappish, “Alon sélébré!” She would say digging a bent wrinkled finger into his side telling him how much it would mean for him to show up to the jingle dance of that year’s favorite student.
A stitch of pain tugged under Ron’s ribs, and that horrible anxious worry he’d always had but ignored simmered in his gut. The apprehension as he had fought with Harry over the trial, as he had ignored anything to do with Draco for years until the man had been found dead and rotting, ignored Harry’s closeness with Miss Malfoy. The questions he had hinted at as he search his sister’s face, asking her how everything was, and hearing just how obsessed Harry had always been. Never stopped looking, just not where Ron could see.
Ron had let the issue drop after that. They both had. Neither had ever bothered with anything about the Malfoys or Draco since, a tentative ceasefire with Harry that had lasted for years. Though Ron had suspected Harry had never given up his search, and in his capacity as caregiver for Teddy had made tentative ties with Narcissa through Andromeda, Ron had not been involved in that area of his life. It was not a secret or a lie, just a silent mutual agreement to not talk about.
He had thought they were headed for a portkey location, or a safe house hidden behind some muggle tourist shop, he hadn’t paid much attention to where they were headed or what the plan was for after they got there, not after his mother had let go of his hand to dig into her bag for something, speaking quietly, hurriedly, head bent sideways towards his father.
Ron rubbed his eyes, it was Harry’s voice. Harry was firecalling him, and he didn’t sound upset or stressed or impatient for answers as he had been the last few calls after they had found Malfoy’s dead body.
He just needed to wait, five minutes wasn’t so long, then he could go back and save Malfoy. Or at least buy him the time to call someone to save him. If he could keep Malfoy alive long enough for someone to arrive.
He reread the last few lines, trying to remember where he was going with his pros and cons of joining Umbridge’s little student task force. Deciding that he’d pretty much picked that topic to the bone he flipped the cover closed and opened a fresh journal, writing  ‘Reference book 12, accompanied Book 5 Year 1995-1996”
Though in this moment Ron had extinguished his wand and ducked out of the room in time that when the bastard’s high chitters disturbed his brother’s sleep he only got something thrown at him. Ron heard the thump and squeak accompanying his brother’s aggrieved “shut it” as he slinked back up the stairs, heart pounding.

“Shit shit shit, don’t talk.” Ron hit his knees beside him and opened his bag for the vials of dittany, but even as he uncorked it and reached for Draco’s shirt he knew he was too late. Malfoy coughed, once, and then breathed no more. “No, Malfoy don’t you-” Ron spread the vial over the lacerations, but no new skin grew. “Fuck.” Ron fisted his hands in the bloodstained shirt and shook him, “Malfoy come ON!”
Ron just nodded. “I think that’s swell mate.” He agreed and watched as Harry climbed the steps to his house, waiting, unmoving, even as the door shut and the porch light went off followed by the brightening of the living room window as Harry entered. No doubt Ginny was awake somewhere, she usually staid up in the third story smoking room turned game room as she watched old Quidditch games on their modified telly. She’d be coming down now, Creature alerting her to Harry’s arrival. They’d sit and talk, communication was never an issue for them as it was for Ron and him, Harry bared his emotions more easily to her and Luna than anyone else. Ron had once chalked it up to girls being better about things like talking about their feelings, but these days he realized he and Hermione were just not emotionally available people. Ron suppressed them, pushing them down and ignoring their existence until they boiled over onto everyone in the area. Hermione was just too focused on logic, on finding the reasons for the feelings and explaining them away.
“I’m a Slytherin, I’ll use what leverage I have.” Draco closed his eyes, and neither he nor Ron really bothered with the blood that grew on the floor around him. “Do you remember the summer before first year?” he asked, and his voice was soft now, almost dreamy. “It really felt like anything was possible then, if only I hadn’t made such a mess of it.”
Her screams, as real and present as it had been ten years ago, and him just as helpless to save her. He hadn’t meant to look, hadn’t wanted to look.
Draco had become accustomed to the dances these many years, and found comfort in the beat It felt like it could reach him no matter where he went in the world, if it could find him even into the supposed quiet of the library.
Draco watched the last of the students board the school buses, chattering excitedly, carefully preserved and protected formal wear all wrapped up in their arms. “You really ain’t comin?” Demaurius asked, his large square body barely squeezing through the folded doors of the old rattling bus. He wasn’t particularly tall, barely reaching to Draco’s chin, but he had always had the presence of someone so much bigger than those around him.
“Ride back with me?” Ron had asked, prepared to be rebuffed and tentatively hopeful when Harry had jerked his head in a nod and strode away.
He had to stop, bracing his hands on the side of the car and bowing his head, just breathing. He was breathing too hard, too fast. Why was this upsetting him so much? It hadn’t the first time.
“Why is it not healing?” He growled and keeping his weight on one forearm, both to keep Malfoy still as to keep pressure on the wounds, grabbed another bottle of dittany from the bag he’d brought with him, uncorking it with his mouth and applying it across the huge open gashes.
The students wouldn’t be students anymore once they returned, a three day Carnival Cruise for a prom and then Graduation that Monday afternoon. Draco would see them collect their diplomas and then he wouldn’t meet them ever again. The wizarding world was so much broader with too much distance between then it ever was in the UK. Demaurius was from Oregon, which might as well be in Germany for all that Draco could leave the school.
Not that Ashuwixën’s library had ever been quiet, unlike Hogwarts’ library which had been ruled over by the terrifying and tyrannical Pince it had always reminded Draco more of a common room then a place of study, and had been used by the students to meet and gather and share their stories in ways he’d never known a library could be used for.
Ron ran his hand along the side, feeling all the little imperfections where the dents had been popped back out and sanded down. The journal had spoken about Malfoy’s ‘project car’, he just hadn’t connected it to the battered vehicle his father and he had shaken their heads over as they gathered evidence.
The Malfoy in his head sniffed haughtily, a nasally little breath through his stupid pointed nose. ‘That’s point 2, kill it with fire’
It had detailed Harry surrendering to Voldemort to buy them all time, as the three of them had agreed to hide the existence of the Horcruxes, and went on to reveal Draco’s rather embellished role in their escape from Malfoy Manor, with Luna and Dean and Olivander all giving a heavily edited and most certainly fabricated commentary on the Malfoy family’s role in their confinement. Dean had jokingly told Ron and Hermione during the planning stages of the article that he had never even seen the Malfoys while he had been there, which was in itself a kindness.
Ron surged up and rushed to it, grabbing for the handle too fast it slipped out of his bloody fingers causing him to struggle with opening it for precious seconds.
“You never want to catch up with yourself.” Draco told him seriously, and reached for the dittany in his hand, “Especially not with the car.” Ron watched, disturbed, as Malfoy drank what was left in the vial. “Did you have any more?”
“Time as we know it was created by humans.” Clavel had said, watching the smoke curl from a wigwam up into the brilliant sky, so bright were the stars that even with no moon they could see much of the world around them. “We track the sun and the seasons and the stars, but we cannot track time, only how it shapes and moves us.”
In it’s own way it ended up being worse than before he’d traveled back to fix things, and every moment he couldn’t be in the same room with Harry without yelling eroded at his willpower. He wanted, more than anything, to just tell Harry the truth. That he had traveled back in time, that a few days from now he’d steal the time turner to go back and save the biggest git they’d ever known because his death was tearing holes in Harry that none of them knew how to patch up, that he’d never have kept finding Draco a secret and Harry would have been the first to know if any of that had actually happened but it was all an elaborate lie that he was desperately keeping hold of and he was sorry, so sorry for making him think Ron wouldn’t trust him with the truth.
He stopped himself from adding more, the last book was already full of his questions just like these. He didn’t even had Malfoy’s supposed identity, he couldn’t imagine him still going by Draco.
His sister deserved nice things and he wondered if he could sneak a bit of his planned blackmail over in her direction as easily as he had once scraped his peas onto her plate as a child.
