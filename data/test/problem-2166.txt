"Baby!"
“Holding pattern?” Draco scoffed noisily, eyebrows shooting skyward as he raised his chin and leveled a narrow-eyed stare at Pansy, who was supposed to be his ally in all things and comfortable confidante. Her needles clicked on, unstoppable; she met and matched his Look with a scathing Look of her own. Draco tsked. “Tosh. Whatever do you mean, ‘holding pattern’? I’ll have you know I have a perfectly lovely, perfectly satisfying life, Pansy Parkinson Zabini, and--if it weren’t for my bloody house going off the rails and shoving procreation up my nose twenty four seven--I’d be continuing it on, happily uninterrupted! It’s hardly a ‘holding pattern’ when you like what you’re doing!”
“Yes? Talk,” Harry prompted, looking severely unimpressed with the entire business. “Tell me yours if you don't like mine, then. Because we’ve tried everything there is to try. Even the Unspeakable things that I can’t even properly speak of, they're of no use and don't think I'm even the slightest bit--”
“Merlin!” Hermione sighed heavily, fed up, apparently. “Idiot boys, all of you!” She ducked into her book, taking her doctored wheat toast with her, leaving Harry to keep a wary eye on proceedings.
"Prat. Bull-headed twit.
“Shut it, mate,” Harry informed Ron sternly, interrupting a heated exchange between Ron and Seamus and not caring. “It was your doing; don’t deny it.”
The Floo's Muffling Knob must've been malfunctioning though, as Lucius was once again highly audible, every single bloody word, no matter how Draco discreetly twiddled it.
"I won't see. I hate you," Draco informed him. "
“Different, yes. Don't fret, Harry. What's done is done. And Auntie's never really said, one way or the other. But the boy’s certainly always been entertaining--even if maniacally energetic--and it’s a pleasure for me to help out Auntie when I'm able. She’s a remarkable woman but he's definitely a handful and a half. I'm happy to give her a respite whenever I can.”
“But what if--what if I choose wrong?” Draco burst out, sitting forward. He threw his hands up in a helpless gesture. “What if we’re really only meant to be friends, Pansy? I don’t want to ruin this, I really don’t. It would--”
“Not the same illustrious Wizard, Harry, but thanks,” Malfoy was hardly ever at a loss, and shagging Harry Potter had been a great restorative for his battered feelings, after that awful Seventh Year. “Ever so. You like this, then?”
“Oi!” Pansy barked. “Draco! That wasn’t nice! No setting my knickers on fire and no lame double entendrés; I’m far too chilled to insult you properly in return, darling. It’s not fair.”
Potter—hurtful bastard that he was, Potter actually grinned boyishly as he pulled back, his lips finally departing Draco's cheek, and he was still doing it when he opened his mouth to destroy Draco's carefully cultivated mask of indifference, summoned from nowhere only by Draco's own enormous willpower.
There were, after all, other 'trendy hotspots' available just off Diagon. And it wouldn't be the first establishment they'd been tossed out of, either.
Draco smirked wider and harder than ever, till he was practically all over smirk, tip to toe. Harry scowled in return, purely out of habit.
"Atrocious!"
In dire pain about the temples, Draco fumbled hopefully for the knob that controlled the level of the flames, as it also functioned to control the Floo volume. Thank Morgana for the mod cons an updated post-final Battle Hogwarts featured.
"Alright, I s'pose," Harry shrugged, dropping his cloak and kicking off his work shoes in weird little tipsy dance across the room. His messenger bag went off to the left somewhere, his work robes were slung over the one armchair in passing. "And no—hafta' to go back again tomorrow night, to finish it off. Damned Wickes didn't have the what'sit jigger I needed—that elbow-bendy bit. Special ordering it for me. In tomorrow."
, Harry decided firmly, settling his bum with conviction. It was, but still.
“Sorry! Wasn’t sure you’d still be here, this late. Here’s those old surveillance files we wanted from Archives this morning.”
“Go it, Potter! Go it!” he screamed, jouncing madly. “Potter! Don’t fail me now, you prat!”
And also…"FUCK ME!"
Draco used his newly-bangled hand to dig out his billfold, forestalling the waitress's determined approach by throwing down a generous heap of Muggle money on the sticky, wrapping strewn table top. Kept hold of Harry the whole time, though, with the other unadorned one. Unless he counted it as being adorned with Harry.

regulation Muggle denims. He squirmed where he sat, hands shoving hastily at his pants and jeans. They inched down his lean hips 'neath Draco's attentive gaze. "By what 'possibilities', exactly?"
"Oh, you're so right." Harry's teeth closed. He smiled, thin as knives, and the words whispered back intimately into the hollow of Draco's neck, formed where he was bent over Harry like the arc of a bow, they sliced as deep as any ice-coated steel. "It was never that. Clever, Draco."
"Sure. Yes. I'll give it a whirl."

"All to the better," Draco snuck in, darkly. "I'm sure."
now dwell in, weren't we? But my House is just as horrid, damn it, even if it's all frolicking mooncalves and towering stacks of nappies! It’s worse than a mere fucking Curse now and Mum’s saying there’s nothing anyone can do, not that she knows of, not that even Blaise’s mother knows of--but you, Potter! You’re the one I need, I know it. You've got it, the knack of saving people, and bloody hell, Harry, I need saving!”
“But,” Draco overrode Potty’s protest completely. “Has all the diagrammes laid out—very well presented.”
Draco patted his stomach, feeling distinctly greenish about the gills. Would pesky Potter ever cease with that infernal spinning of his? Draco would be next in line, retching up his luncheon, all over Pansy’s imported French stockings!
Hermione shrugged.
In moments they’d gained the fourth landing up, and Draco silently steered Harry to face down the centre of an expansive three-corridor split. They regarded it. The main hall led to various suites for guests and whatnot, the right led to all the rooms the House Elves occupied as paid employees and retainers. He cocked his thumb at the leftmost one. Which had once been merely serviceable, as befitted its workaday purpose as a repository for boisterous Malfoy spawn, but was now quite tarted up with pristine striped silk damask wallpaper and a series of rather impressively filigreed silver Persian-style sconces leading down the distance. A truly gorgeous runner overlaid the polished parquetry and small sculptures and portraits of antique Ancestors as Children were displayed in niches every three or four yards or so. It all smelt of lilac, talcum, honey and freshly gathered daisies and was just precisely the most comfortable of temperatures.
“From last night, remember?” Harry replied airily. “You know, for
Harry rolled sideways; settling his sticky legs more firmly between Malfoy’s dangling ones. Fortunately, it was one of the magically extendable work surfaces and fortunately, Malfoy knew the right incantation to scrub all the cauldrons clean whilst they recovered. He’d his uses, for a walking, talking prat-of-ages, Malfoy did. Harry wouldn’t be without him, now.
"Thanks for that."
“Oh! Hmmm,” Draco hummed, tapping at his chin with a long finger. "Perhaps..." He pressed a little harder up against Harry’s side, trying to bring him back to the present and out of the ill-tempered funk that had settled over him like a damp cloud. “You know, that’s not a bad notion. Temporarily, at least. Harry, what do you think? Are you game for it?”
"No!" Draco surged forward once more, stung into action, the force of it toppling the armchair abandoned behind him. It fell with a solid thunk, rattling the random bibelots on the mantel. "No! Fuck
"Oh-gods.
"Fool—fool—
“What?”
, arsehole. I was only—only."
Harry snuffled his sly amusement against the shoulder he leaned upon. He was warm and nicely resting, wrapped in the wings Draco always whinged over—silly git; the wings were beautiful!—and completely sodden and soaked still with various sorts of stickinesses and stuck-on down. His arsehole was deliciously sore; it felt plundered and likely he'd be feeling it still on his broom when they eventually returned to Hogwarts.
“You don’t say. Really? Sounds smashing." Draco blinked at the mental picture, momentarily feeling slightly appalled at all that might go dreadfully wrong should the spells fail. "Right. Of course, Mum, but you know I've always mounds and mounds of work, right here at home. Hard to steal away.”
"Yet."

He sighed gustily, scowling dispiritedly at the unfinished Incident Summary, left askew where Draco had shoved it aside, and renewed exerting every ounce of his will towards foiling the bloody Veritus within him. He couldn’t say what he wanted to say but he could tell Draco a different truth, just as valid.
But Draco resisted. He was no coward, not he.
"Uh! Right, then—
No! Harry couldn't be that lucky—besides, Malfoy was to marry! He'd been told all about it and from the mouth of Ginny Weasley, no less!
"No, no," Draco hastened to assure his father. "I do believe, Father, he's proceeding. In that, exactly. A…well, let's call it an
“Right, that's it. You’re swaying, Potter, and now you’ve gone dead pale,” Draco stated flatly and this time he did rise up, slipping his wand out of his sleeve holster as he did so in one smooth motion. “Enough. Either tell me what you got hit with right now or I’ll hex you silly and trot you straight back to St Mungo’s myself.”
“Admit—it! Tell me…that…I’m… your…best! Say it now, Potter!”
“Hah, Potter!” Draco burst out laughing. “You wish. Danger is
"Ooohhh, Haaarrrry," he whispered, and felt his stupid selfish heart lurch in his achy chest. "Oh, Harry!" Maybe—just maybe—he could allow La Brown a little more of Harry—but only if Harry knew this was his home. His place, here with Draco.
Of course Potter caught him, because Potter. Well before Draco might've struck the smooth stones with his spinning head—he
"Potter?"
"Okay." He blinked vaguely at the fire burning earnestly in Hermione's eyes and then dropped his own, meek, biddable. Weasley he didn't even glance at; he knew what he'd see there. "I get it." And he'd didn't rise to his feet to see them out, either, even though all his Malfoy breeding demanded it. He was just so…just
He’d used to think the whole ‘throwing oneself’ at a person was bunk, an expression of speech. Turned out it wasn’t; who knew? The Quidditch shed wall was convenient; the trampled lawn was even more so—and mutual frotting went a long way toward releasing pent-up frustration.
“Harry—my nymphet nit, are you even still awake?” Malfoy shoved him on the shoulder, impatient. “What d’you say then? Spain sound viable for your glorious eighteenth? Or would you rather see Gay Paree? Might be cooler there—or
"Uh-huh."
For Harry.
Sometimes Harry fancied he might, and that Draco’s invisible wings were
Harry shrugged, grimacing as he returned the urn to its place on mantle.
"Haven't you," Draco persisted softly, gamely stoic in the face of just plain grimness, and because he was also insanely curious and it was a sign maybe, a ray of hope. "Already altered them? When you." He wet his lips, biting down hard on the lower one when Harry scowled. "When you first came here, after?"
“I wasn’t!” Draco sat up, startled, his cheeks tinging pink at the passing mention of his and Harry's one ridiculous spate of shagging. "I'm not!" He firmed his jaw, staunchly ignoring it. “That’s the whole point of this--this advice-seeking, Pansy. I am invested; that's bloody obvious, just as you say, and I fucking do well know he cares for me, but marriage, Pans--and kids! That’s all--that’s just--I can’t even--no!”
That was it, Draco decided, breathlessly, when they'd arrived at a tiny, common, rather grimy shop tucked into a further nameless side alley located off the first one and positively crammed full of rather inexpensive baubles.
“Sound nice, Potter? And you can stay over at the Manor, of course, till then. That’s a given. Mum’ll love having you to fuss over. We can have Aunty Drom to visit and Teddy, too,
"Absolutely not," Malfoy agreed heartily. "Cheers to that. Now then, you boring lot, let's play a game."
Draco's head smacked the flagstones, bouncing; he didn't mind.
"I—yes."
"Um, what? What's that you're saying, Draco?"
fourthly, mind—I'm Prefect and you're the resident boy hero. Hmm. Salazar's toenails, Harry. What ever shall we do with this fortunate circumstance, I wonder? As we're all alone."
"It's not our flat." Harry pursed his lips, twisting a lock of dark hair into an unruly corkscrew and staring at it cross-eyed. “It’s only that...well, I suppose I miss it, just a little. Grimmauld. Like you probably miss living at the Manor, I imagine. You do, right?”
"I know a few people who don't know him that well yet," Patil volunteered, swinging her head in close to Pansy's. "Want me to dig them up?" They commenced whispering furiously, sotto voce.

“Ohmygod, this is so mindless! So—so asinine! You’re inane, the both of you! I mean, look! You’re actually fighting over Malfoy’s
? Stop talking for once? You’re humiliating me! He’ll be watching us, next! He’s not supposed to notice!”
“I’ll do it. I'm off out anyway, down to the town for a little shop,” Harry offered, perking up under the effects of his beverage and eying Luna’s discarded plate with interest. “You go back to bed, Luna. You look as though you could do with another eight hours. Perhaps also a Pepper Up of your very own."
got to say."
"That's tomorrow, right?"
“Haha,” Harry laughed nervously, furtively inching his chair away from his end of their desk and shaking his head ruefully as he ran a hand through his ruffled hair. “Right. Yes, well, there was one more Wizard still in the room, you see?”
, you damned Death Eater!" Weasley snarled, his hand back on his wand again, but Harry was right there, stuffing him back in his hole.
Ron was vastly amused by this. But only because of Hermione, really.

was, rather—his Mum. All that fuss over a ring, as if most Malfoy heirlooms, jewelry included, didn't come as a package deal, complete with numerous enchantments. What was the big hoorah, anyway? As long as Harry liked it, who cared?
“No, no, no, stop it at once, Draco,” Hermione shushed and soothed. “I’m not the one suggesting you sell off the Manor, that was this idiot here.” She thumbed over at Harry, who looked a bit put-upon. “But maybe...just maybe..? Something more like...”
Draco's eyes burned. "No! Oh—please! More!"
“Well…” Harry shrugged, grimacing ruefully. “There’s my Antwerp chappie, always, and I’ve been receiving some unsettling news from the Americas recently. Damages at Nazca, unfortunately. And I never leave here at a rational hour and the bloody Aurors are always nattering after us for field support. So, normal enough, I’d say. Nothing drastic.”

Pronunciation – rye-though
Still, both Granger
"And the charades marathon, Draco. That was each of us making things up to amuse the others," Granger reminded him. "Plus we've all dueled till we were black and blue and taught the DA stuff to the Youngers. I don't see much difference, not fundamentally. It's just methods."
“Er—no reason. I’ll see you later, alright?”
Harry couldn’t stand it. Really. He was jealous, he admitted. Couldn’t bear the thought of further invasion of what was undeniably his to stake out and stand over, howling. That expanse of pale skin between the jut of Draco’s hips was
It was a bit of quandary, Harry thought unhappily, his eyes busy with scanning through another enquiry, this time from Newfoundland.
That was all it had been, for Harry. Fun. Good times. Shagging.
Harry only stared blankly in return, not replying instantly in the affirmative as he should do, and Draco, dropping his gaze in an excess of accumulating panic, discovered the floor was a fascinating locale; nay, even the box the ring had come in was a deeply mesmerizing object—and truly, if he were forced to meet Harry's eyes again whilst he pleaded the case for a hasty bonding Draco was positive he'd expire on the spot. His poor heart was pounding so...as were his wings. Whuff...whuff...whuff, they went, contrapuntally.
"Dr—"
sunning, prat. I am—I am swotting, alright? DADA, I'll have you know. Not that it's your business what I do!"
, by all that's holy, fucking stop breathing on me, alright?" he warned, and shoved the first of his inches in on the words. Harry gasped, jolting and wriggling, so that Draco sat carefully back on his heels and put an arm up to hold Harry's shivering legs still, smoothing a soothing hand down long muscled thighs and running the fingers of the other all over Harry's flagging dick, coaxing him back from whatever precipice he was on, mentally. "Steady!"
“Thai, I think, ta,” Harry replied, leaning forward to make a space for their soon-to-be supper plates on the table. Which was mostly accomplished by his spelling of everything piled onto it over to the antique bureau Draco had carted over from his study in the Manor. “There, now. Ah. Would you mind bringing me one too?”
"Why, yes. Yes, of course, Father. I don't play fast and loose; you know that."
, though? I mean-huh. That's, er—that's interesting, yes. A very…interesting…idea."
Draco, disliking the sudden intense attention he’d garnered from a passing remark, spared a thought to  checking down the front of his brand new merino jersey to ensure he’d not spilt his morning porridge on the hunter-green weave of it—but Potter was all at once upside down in the sky and spiraling like a whirligig and he didn’t want to miss a single solitary move of that.
“Yeah?”
"Git," Draco replied smartly, but with no heat to it. "No one is five anymore, not even Teddy."
“And I,” Harry stated grimly, “do
"You—you-re-really—
“What, nothing! You startled me, that’s all. I’m…I’m not accustomed to you being at all ‘poetical’, as Ronald here calls it. That was very weird, Harry. Not at all like you.”
“Famished, actually,” Draco smiled, gratefully accepting the glass of wine handed him. "But thank you. Throat was a bit dryish." He cast his light cloak carefully over the back of a convenient armchair, peering more closely at his old mate. “Hmm. You look harried, Harry. Haunted, even. Aright there?”
It would be…it would be the worst thing ever, Harry not wanting him. It would be…the Draught of Living Death.
"Stuff it."
“No!” Draco slid his arm about Harry’s shoulders and pulled him close, leaning in to mutter confidentially into Harry’s ear. “No. She cannot, and here I was, hearing myself singing lullabies and chanting nonsense rhymes! And the smell I smelt? I swear it was intoxicating--like Amortentia, but all about bloody babies! Talcum and daisies, damn it! Fresh linens, line dried! So, it struck me.”
They'd have to work on that bit, Draco mused happily, that very intriguing notion. He'd always wanted a sibling, Draco recalled, his bemused mind wandering off to much balmier, talc-scented climes. Or three. But maybe five would be a better number—give those sodding Weasels a run for their Galleons. Or seven—go them by one more.
Ouch!
! Why ever would he wish to drive Draco to this point, the bleeder?
—his Zen focus had fled and all this noisy idiocy was forcing him to watch stupid Ron and not Malfoy’s interesting hair—and really, Malfoy’s hair was worth watching. Especially in the mornings. …And Ron—now that Voldie was offed and out of the picture—was entirely too free-spirited. Some kind soul should sit on his damned ginger head! Or soak it!
“Say that again, slowly?” she requested after a very long moment had passed, in a wondering tone of voice, rather s though she’d witness the birth of a supernova or something.  “Darling?”
“Oh, come on now—surely you recall ‘Weasley is Our King’, Harry? And—and, well, that’s inspiring and—and
"Oh! Oh, Draco!"
At Draco's impatient frown and chin-jerk assent, he carried on.
"Yeah?"
“Whaaaat?” Harry gaped as his evil git of a friend ran through a very odd set of opening musical scales. Horridly offkey ones. “Excuse
"Wait, what? For me, you say? Draco?"
“Oh—fuck!” Harry gasped. “Would you just keep going, arsewipe?”
They were schoolboys, still—barely. Potter, Draco decided, could skive off whatever it was that was getting in the way, right? Pish-tosh to detention; they'd both make it later if they had to. Really, they were still just kids yet and that was what kids did, wasn't it? Childish things? Irresponsible things?
"Dear…" Draco's Mum interjected, with a winsome smile and a cautioning Look send Draco's direction. "Don't you think—? Perhaps a tonic might be just the thing-"
for luncheon--had been sufficient to dim the glow of his anticipation.  His early escape to Town and thence to Tesco’s had been very much necessary and not just for purpose of fetching the swill Harry liked quaffing.  The Manor was, in a word, stifling. Well, two words really did it greater justice:

Perhaps it was the Gardens that really clued Draco in, absolutely blanketed as they were in baby’s breath and lavishly scented orchids and passion lilies, whilst all the poor Bachelor's Buttons had died off.
“Set,” Harry proclaimed to the winds, glancing fondly down at the Flower.
his Stately Pile.
Draco tilted his chin impudently, rudely rocked his chair back on its hindlegs and made no move to leap into mollifying action.
He—they—were never quite clear on whether it was words or images or feelings, or what precisely it was that left Harry Potter speechless and awed, his lips parted, his once again revealed eyes wide and strangely pupils-blown. It didn't last more than moment, though.
“Oh, yes, actually,” Harry nodded, looking up from the book but keeping a thumb to the page as he carefully closed it. “We learn a lot from bees, you know. They have their own language; the Ancients likely understood and used it in their runes.”
? No, erm…bruising?"
Bloody Harry, with his heart like a sponge! Always diving into dangerous waters, the twat.
“Like that, Harry—just like that; come for me, come all over me---I want it
But the entire time he was speaking, Draco was also utterly unable to cease mentally pawing through the shop's pathetic little wares—except that they
“Better than anything on earth, isn’t it, Potty?” Malfoy asked, twinkle decidedly returned to his eyes. Of all things, he adored poking at his Potter the most.
, Draco?"
Day 254. Fucking a day of infamy.
“Indeed,” Luna agreed, mustering up a weak smile. “Bit much when you are, too.”
this dense, aren't you?"
Draco shut the Floo connection down posthaste, backing away from it as if it were a dangerous beast. Certainly it had contained one, just now. He stumbled to his feet, weary and with ears ringing still. Duty called, despite all this nonsense and paternal idiocy. And he'd a Harry to torture, besides. Torture with snogs and sucking and licking—It could all be much worse, really.
Harry glanced up quickly at Draco for confirmation but his companion was preoccupied with staring at the man standing before them, all decked out in dark violet robes practically sprouting outsize stars and indecent amounts of spangles and cheerfully running his gnarled fingers through his excessively long silver-grey beard.
"…Yes." Draco finally-finally—raised his chin; met Harry's searching stare. "Together, then, Potter." He quirked his lips wryly. "The suspense is killing me, you know? What is it this year—another tome on Potions? Broom care kit, maybe."
“B-Berks!” Hermione added, still overcome. “F-Fine, fine! Miss breakfast—go at it! See if I care!”
, Potter! That’s more like it! Go it, git!”
"Draco! Draco, hold up!"
"Fool!" She spat, newly ticked off, rising like a small Fury and tugging her silent sidekick along with her impatiently, her disgust with Draco over-evident and brashly loud. "You've let it go too far again. He's broody, Harry is. Probably obsessing, thinking he's made this grand gesture by walking out and now he can't come back here, even if he
“Not anymore, I don’t,” Draco hissed grimly at Harry’s ear, urging him up the marble steps all the while. “It’s resisting every incantation, even the Blood ones, and the ones you showed me last week at dinner no longer do a fucking speck of good. Believe me, I've tried them on my own, repeatedly. They may work for your tawdry Grimmauld but they do nothing for my Nursery. I need you here, Potter, and you need to do the casting for me. It's all I can think of to try, now. You know them better than I--Hermione taught you the wand movements directly via floo call, you said--and besides, we both know you’re the more powerful Wizard of the two of us.”
Boy Wonder. Small fry.”
"M'not a 'job', Potter!" Draco huffed righteously, right in Potter's worried face. "I'm a treat-and-a-half, you gumptious prat! Better be appreciating me, wanker. I wouldn't do this for just any old—"
Rub it in, fuck it—how the world wanted a piece of him (them, really) and Draco had to put up with it or get over his own self or whatever worked to smooth these little incidents over. 'Cause unreasoning jealousy was so passé in an ex-Slytherin and besides, Harry wouldn't know how to cheat even if presented a bloody manual!
“Yes, fine, splendid!" Firming up his courage, Draco looked up, a hint of challenge in his elevating chin. The words scrambled themselves together, rushing from somewhere, doing their damn best to come bursting out of his mouth in a muddle. "Why wouldn't I be? Right, yes, it's very nice to see your speccy phiz at last and all that, but. But I--"
"But—go ahead. Open it," Draco still wouldn't look. His lips twisted though and Harry thought maybe it was a near facsimile of a smile. "Right? T'is the season and all." The passersby outside the window, even being nothing more than red-nosed, scarf-wrapped ghosts reflecting, were more of interest to him than Harry. "Get it over with, Potter."
“Pfft!” Draco’s nostrils flared. “You say this.”
“Well,” Harry eyed him speculatively, eyes narrowing. “Since you ask me so nicely, ‘more’ means that I would rather like to leave here right now and go home--mine or yours, makes no difference--and take a bit of time to know my partner a bit better than I already do. Have a drink with him. Share a meal; I’m a bit famished. Can’t think well when I’m hungry, sorry. And, er. Have ourselves a lovely s--”
"Merlin, Draco!"
"Stop
"Harry." Draco's actual voice was no more than a whisper—
Blinking and rolling with the drunken sideways stumble Apparation always left him with, Harry found himself standing on a huge sloping dolmen-shaped boulder, atop a number of other huge boulders in the midst of the Lake, and all of a yard away from one very sorry looking Draco Malfoy.
The voice in Harry's head wailed.
"Oh, Merlin, how I hate you sometimes. Come on, Harry. Pay attention!"
"Just like Teddy!" Harry grinned. "They're talking of having another, you know."
“Then nothing,” Draco muttered darkly, settling back into his seat and crossing his arms defiantly over his chest. He’d only asked for the purpose of diverting her; clearly that wasn't on. “Go on with you if you’re going on, then. Give me the life advice I’m apparently so in need of and let me get on with coping with my latest mental breakdown. Merlin knows we don’t need two of us in this state; Harry’s going spare as it is.”
"Fuck!" Harry observed, after several of those moments had passed, his eyes snapping open in alarm. "Tempus! Shite! We're late, Malfoy—shift your lily-white arse!"
“Oh, certainly,” Draco replied, soft and low, just by Harry’s blushing ear. He must have bent over, to be slipping his hand down Harry’s arm like that, pressing the warmth of his body up against Harry’s side. “That’s all there is to it, then? For you.”
fountains? What's going on, I wonder?"
"Love you, babe; easy now," Harry crooned sweetly, softly, his lambent green eyes fixed upon Draco's stormy rolling ones with every indication of ardour. "Breathe in, m'love. Breathe out—yes, that's it. I'll take it nice and slow—promise."
It wasn't even that Draco wasn't interested in having a child of his own, because he wasn't averse to the idea, not really. He supposed he likely should, one day. Maybe.
"…Proof?" Granger echoed, a species of shocked realization dawning upon her horrified features. "Oh,
Because of course it would. It would be smashing, actually. Go out to pubs, have a few drinks, perhaps even go clubbing? By Merlin, that was a much more attractive prospect than Portkeying his solitary arse off to Monaco to watch a herd of flying horses go 'round about over some twisty Muggle streets in the company of his mum and her bosom pals. Harry was also and incidentally a damned decent wingman, which he’d proved over multiple times during their Flamel years. Well, at least until he’d up and been recruited by the Ministry and before Draco had become more involved with Theo, but all that really wasn't to the point, these days. Nor was pulling.
“Tosh. That’s not what I meant, really,” she said, “and you know it, both of you. I literally just said that, not even a minute ago, Harry; were you even listening? No one requires children to feel happy and fulfilled and that's fact. But some people really do have a lot to gain from their interactions with children and the both of you are classic examples. At least on the surface, Harry. At least admit that.”
"But, come along, Harry," Draco made to rise, and Harry saw the waitress hurrying along with their bill. "Let's go home, alright? Time to leave."
Draco bit his lip.
“Pish tosh, Potter!” she scoffed, having neatly polished half of her butty in the time it took Harry to chew his first bite and hastily swallow. “Don’t have all day, you know? Things to do, people to intimidate, darling. Must rush, so do spill.”
“Thank you!" she called out to them. "Arigato gozaimasu!”
little sod. They would begin as Draco meant to go on, with
“No!” Harry shrugged it off, scowling. “Of course not pumpkin juice, Hermione! You think I’m mental, don’t you? Malfoy’s hair, obviously! Whatever are you on about?” He waved his goblet, irked. But then it struck him: Hermione wasn’t planning on becoming an Auror. He should explain his reasoning; it was maybe not clear to everyone, the correlation between Malfoy’s hair and the properties of Giant Squid territory. “Hmm. Y’see, Hermione, pumpkin juice is just…just orange, but Malfoy’s hair is all white-ish-silvery-watery-coloured and it gleams something fierce. Glossy. You know,” he nudged her with a prompting elbow. “Lake water.”
"Urk!" Draco had never considered his Mum might actually ponder his largely uneventful love life, much less conclude Potter was a natural for a starring role in it. "M-Mum?"
"Coo-ee!" his mum called out suddenly, startling him. "You look a bit at sea, Draco. Did you hear what I just said? You will contact Harry, won't you? I realize it's been a long time for you two, darling, but I'm sure it's only that he's just been re-assigned. I hardly imagine he'd slight you, my sweet."
“Say something.”
Draco, just before he lost his grip altogether and the world mercifully faded to fuzzy black, had only one thought rattling about in his blond head: really, the world simply
"Shut it, Malfoy—" An intent Potter barely paused in his explanation. "Look here, Ron, Hermione. We wanted to, erm, uh…demonstrate. Demonstrate—that's it. Um, give you some proof."
“Couldn’t have said better, darling,” Pansy nodded. “Myself.”
"I've got blackmail material," Harry went on, snickering wickedly, rubbing his stubbly chin against Draco's chest and scraping it in passing. "Thanks to the Room. Right there." He pointed to a black-box shaped contraption, positioned just so, and humming away as it gathered evidence for use of, as and if needed. "Video camera, m'love. Plays back anywhere, anytime you want, it does, and doesn't even require a Penseive bowl. Fancy, eh?"
Luna shrugged charmingly. “
"Of course I did," Malfoy nodded, blandly ignoring Harry. "Have, I mean. How could I not? It's Potter."
"Let the future take care of itself, Harry," Draco kissed the ear; he couldn't resist. "Let me give this to you now, please."
, Harry! I still can't feel my sac! Bed sounds like a very nice place to be right now, alright? And we two should be off there, soon as we can. Just need Granger and we're golden."
“Mmmm…yes, perhaps I do. A little.” Draco glanced off, diverted, gaze not really taking in the vague movements of the muted Muggle actors on the widescreen glass panel. “It’s nice enough there--nowadays, at least. But I’m also at Malfoy often enough so as to not feel homesick a'tall and I--I really like being here, with you.”
"Oh, for Salazar's Sake!" Draco exclaimed, beginning to feel as though he'd suffered quite enough already. "I can't even talk to you, Father! Do leave off now—forget them for now—"
"How much will it set me back, Mr. Pucker?" Draco interrupted. "Not that the Galleons are at all important—but, can you have it ready by Beltane?"
The old Wizard twinkled at him from behind wire-rimmed spectacles and Draco quite thought it possible that their Headmaster might very well have a distant cousin right here in Hogsmeade, working in a tiny hovel-like shop in a bloody backwater village, and he wondered…many things. But he said:
we could, Harry. It's just a little applied dexterity—and some slick. And we've got both, and—and I do want to try it, at least once. So we can say we did."
“Really, just do, mate. I said I barely even felt it, didn’t I? I only went off to St Mungo’s because Peesely down in Archives carped at me for tripping. Oh, and Ron had mentioned the kid willingly confessed to casting it just after I turned him over for processing. Likely wanted to protect himself from any backlash from his putrid uncle. Said he wanted to make certain I, Harry bloody Potter, told the entire truth of it when he was booked in,” Harry scoffed bitterly. “Hah! As if!”
"Oh dear." Draco blinked rapidly. "I don't quite know what to say."
“Like Draco? Or like Ollie? Appearances, Hars,” she chuckled kindly. “Don’t be coy and blush at me, you. I can’t imagine your foreign beau is anything less than purely divine. I was only wondering what type it was you went for, these days. Eihwaz, remember?”
"Interested in beekeeping, Potter?” he asked quietly, and sat himself down when he caught sight of the elevenses tray resting on their coffee table. His favourite mug was also there, along with a fresh pot of his preferred blend, plus a small plate of pastries Harry must’ve picked up along the way back from the MInistry. “You’ve never mentioned.”
He sighed glumly, assessing the state of teapot. One last lukewarm cuppa and he’d go somewhere. Maybe not the Manor but somewhere. Else. There was very lovely flower market located off of Dilly’d Alley and--
"You, you're not the usual Harry James Potter with whom I am familiar, not at all, even though you appear to be. No, you've obviously been tampered with in some fashion; a Spell Damage victim. Millicent has doubtless placed some sort of vengeful curse upon you as a result of you saying you were faffing off entirely, and now you’ve being impelled to act just as a normal person does on a normal weekend. Wanting a meal out in public and shopping, all that. How diabolical of her. A fate worse than death for an important Ministry official such as yourself. You should likely go have yourself nice lie-down instead. Just till it wears off, of course. And I'll stand guard, of course."
“Answer. My. Question,” Draco ordered, snapping his teeth for emphasis. “Wanker.”
Draco flinched. It was over, at last. He'd the best advice he was likely going to find, at least from the people who knew Harry better than he did.
make it; Potter
, Harry. And you’ve never been
Draco smiled in return as he fiddled the telly wand, enjoying the drowsy postprandial atmosphere.  In a moment the fit Captain was again romping about the screen, exuding charm and sex appeal.
"Harry!" She swatted him, and it smarted, but Harry didn't care. It was par for the course, wasn't it? Insult to injury. "Harry, you're a bleeding nutter. And that article said nothing to the point. It was all Skeeter's speculation, remember? I read it too, Harry. Load of Thestral crap."
"Have an early lunch, too, as the service is always better before two," Draco nattered on, planning their itinerary aloud.
"You don't trust anyone, Draco. Can't say as I blame you but there it is."
“Yes,” Theo added. “It’s an excuse for you to ogle Potter. Why didn’t you say so, Malfoy? I’d’ve brought Zabini along for reinforcements.”
," Malfoy growled, "now I've got you! Now you're mine—and don't forget it!"
“Tall, blond and fit, Harry?” Mills asked archly, plumping her bum on the corner of Harry’s desk and unwrapping her own in a business-like fashion. “Or tall, brunet and fit, like Ollie? Do tell me everything, holding nothing back. You know I care for you, darling.”
“I know, Potter,” Draco said softly, turning his hand about so that their fingers could intertwine. “It’s alright, really.”
Floribunda twittered—there was no other word for it. She was wreathed in kittenish smiles, all larger even the face-splitting one she'd worn whilst accepting his Very Large Order.
"That'll be a cold day." The reply was fast and flat, unemotional and spare. Spec lenses glinted at him, reflecting Draco's frown, the bags under his eyes. "In hell. That you should even consider I'd return to the debacle you've made our old flat. I'm not a fool, Draco. Do run along." Harry gulped, and seemed to stand a little taller, if anything. Draco took another step towards him, involuntarily. "Really. Be real, okay? You're not wanted here, Draco. Not welcome, got it? Go back to the fucking flat. Hell, sell the flat, why don't you? Burn it and all the contents for all I care. But
Harry blushed and let himself be drawn nearer, almost knocking his half-cold mug of cocoa over in the process. Draco's grasp slipped up his forearm to his collarbone, fingers gripping strongly, only to snake through and round to his back, dodging right in the warm sweaty space between Harry's upper arm and his perspiring—gosh, but he'd been
“Just, you know."
"—ever—and—ever—"
“I hate you both. You are unbearable,” Draco announced. “Fucking take yourselves off, then.”
“Of course,” Luna beamed. “My dear, if you’ll come over nearer me, we shall try the Hygieian on them, using the concerted cast method. You know it?”
to. So, for
the fucking bastard here, for just walking out on me. And for not listening, not even trying to—why is it won't you hear me out? Why are you even like this? It wasn't that bad, what I did, Harry—it wasn't even that awful! It can't have been; I never meant it to be!"
He yanked at Draco’s elbow again, but subtly, edging the two of them well out of the arc of the double doors. With a final quiet snick of an unseen lock they completed their motion, leaving Harry and Draco safely outside.
“Damn it, fine, you stupid obstinate old house!” Draco swore, nearly a full week later, when the Manor once again presented his person at the doorway to the Nursery. He slammed the insistently open door shut again, kicking it for good measure, and pointed his wand tip at the painted panels of rosy-cheeked cherubs with a heavy scowl. "I'm through! You hear me?"
“Alright, Harry.”
"Potter! Potter, that's all very well—nice speech and so forth and so on, yes, but," Draco interjected, nervously wriggling his toes in the carpet. He was also a bit chilled, what with having no real clothes on, and the two yobs across from them were only just sitting and gawping at them. "Get on with this. I'm losing my nerve here. Not to mention my bollocks are about to crawl up my arse-"
"You want I should buy a case of Firewhisky?" Goyle asked. "Or two? If that Durmstrang bloke's coming?"
"Be serious, Harry, You two are not a Potion, you know. You're just boys!"
This was nothing like how it was supposed to go, nothing like.
-whisper under his breath, half hoping Draco would hear and half hoping he wouldn’t, either. It would complicate things if he did; it would clarify things if he did—it would lay them wide open to scrutiny if he did, and—
"You will bring him along, won't you, darling? To visit with me? I would so like a chance to become reacquainted."
"Ah? Obvious?" Draco gulped, which must have caused the choke of surprise that overcame him. "A decade? Ah-ah-excuse me?" He blinked at the blandly beautiful face across from him, confusion resolving to a dark scowl. "Mum, whatever do you mean? I would hardly call this turn of events obvious! Nor expected! It's Potter, Mum—Potter! I didn't even think—would never have—"
"Absolutely," Nott allowed sombrely, downing his own. "Stiff."
“Oh, you’ll never be indifferent, Draco!” Pansy cackled, fingers deftly feeding a new skein of yarn into her creation. “Of that, I am quite certain. But you will know, you will absobloodylutely know, and that’s a good thing. A very good thing indeed.”
"You! You're a hero, remember?" Malfoy taunted, leaning close. And closer yet, his fine grey eyes narrowing with intent, his arms bunching muscle as he flexed them, till he was arched over Harry like some great hungry raptor over an unlucky bit of terrified fluff. Harry was far from being frightened, though; on the contrary, he was beyond all that. He ceased any attempt at inhaling or fleeing and only stared up at Malfoy entranced; he didn't want to miss an instant of viewing Malfoy's pores up close and personal; nor a second of this golden and unexpected opportunity for bathing in that Malfoy air, that Malfoy sensation. "Do what heroes do, Harry. Take action."
And dinner? The dinner he'd so carefully prepared, after a long hard day of toil? His special Friday night 'aren't we glad to be home again, us two, and happily together?' dinner was stony cold and it was nearing half ten—and there was absolutely no sign of the world-saving git—and Draco (Merlin help him; he didn't deserve this!) was
"Yessss!"
Draco’s small self-admission of weakness and his resultant low mood were abruptly diverted by the loud cheery rush of the main floo.
to give it to you—I've been to the Shack just last night and it's all clear—but—"
Draco thought instead of his life now, which had Harry Potter featured prominently. How incredibly, strangely different it was from anything he'd ever imagined, back in the day.
Harry heard the bitterness, though he wasn't sure why Draco might feel that way. The dregs of the cup taste that no amount of sugared whip or icing on cakes could quite disguise. He gulped hard against it—it sent a funny shimmy through his stomach; not pleasant—and his eyes fell again to his gift.
going off anywhere…it wasn't as though this whole scenario wasn't far too familiar. Harry just wished his git would play out his bloody insecurities with fewer theatrics—preferably without an audience. Because Neville looked to be ready to skin him for taxidermy and Ginny was quietly fulminating, her hair nearly sizzling. And the entire fucking restaurant of trendy folk was avidly watching Draco turn his back on Harry Potter, gawping.
Draco's moan was nearly audible; he thought so, too. Harry groaned at the degree of want conveyed by the voice in his head and couldn't help but respond. He spread his legs, settling his bum at the bend of Draco's waist, and clamped his thighs murder-tight round Draco's waist. Draco's cock lay throbbing against his well-lubed crack and Harry smiled.
"You know, Draco, I really do think you should get up off the floor now. That looks to be really uncomfortable."
“Yes, well. That's a matter of opinion,” Pansy smirked. “Very scary subject, that, at least for some chaps. Not that you’d ever truly have a problem, dearest, since Mrs Weasley is the mum in Harry's case and Hermione's mostly giggles over her, thinks she's lovely. Which she is, rather, but! The point is, Draco, we’ve all been concerned about you and Harry, and it’s really only gotten worse since he landed that Unspeakable position and got himself shipped off to parts unknown for so very long--and with no word, other than the occasional postcard. Oh, oopsie. Sorry, darling. Wasn't even the occasional post card, was it? Poor you, love. All that time and not a peep from one you love." She frowned in sympathy, pursing her lips. "Still. You’ve been terribly close, you and Harry, thick as thieves, ever since uni and perhaps even before in some daft manner, who can tell, right? And we all know you two shagged each other rotten in uni, at least at some point, however briefly, so don’t even bother denying you, at least, are highly invested in Harry. It just seems so obvious to us and yet you are both wandering about that flat, acting like boobies and not doing anything positive about it.”
"No…!" Draco moaned; his head all at once too damned heavy to hold upright. He could feel himself falling, falling into Harry, but Harry—for all he was there, right there in Draco's arms—wasn't reaching out to catch him. "No—no."
Draco quailed. Why now did he have to be overcome with such debilitating fear? Why now, when what he needed most was the fine art of gentle persuasion?
“Really?” Black brows quirked at him quizzically as Harry crowded politely after, resting a hand on the mantle. “Why is that?”
Lucius, who seldom raised his voice above an urbane, mock-genial tone these days, had clearly lost any pretensions to proper Malfoy behaviour. Draco shrugged. He knew the feeling all too well; Harry sent him up with great regularity. Had never ceased eliciting that reaction from Draco, honestly, but at least now there was snogging and shagging to soothe his injured sensibilities.
He'd missed this sensation all day long—he had needed—did need—this singular feeling, every moment of every dreary hour he spent working, separated from
. Hah!"
And why was that, precisely?
"Yessss—yeah!" Harry's eyes were closed, his back arched into a bow. "This—isn't—easy, you know?" he gritted. "Bast—
“Yes, of course!” Harry shook his head impatiently. “That and more. A fuck of a lot more, in fact! I’ve been literally dying here, wanting to tell you that. Have you not even noticed?”
“Ten minutes ago, maybe,” Draco advised him calmly, breathing out silently. He clicked off the telly and cast down the controller.  “And? What of it?”
“There, all set. Alright, there? I'll turn the talking box on again for us, shall I?”
"You'd best."
The Lines were messages, meant for descendants, direct from the ones who had lived eons before Harry, Luna and Ishika-san had come to listen and to see what the Lines had to say, of course. For long ago there was magic to be found merely in not only eking out a daily living but also in the deliberate creation of the great Places, the Channels and the Paths and the Leylines of water and air, birds and other creatures, resounding of the lives of the People themselves and the other lives abounding large and small about them. One could be a simple little daisy; one could be great cat, one could be a Wizard or Witch or a Muggle who dwelt amongst them--one could be anything at all, and every one of those was precious and necessary.
Oh, please?
“Of course I do.” Luna righted her glass and took a moment to sip some. She didn’t take her knowing gaze off Harry’s face, though. “But it’s not merely that,” she went on, her light languid voice at odds with the razor’s edge glint in her pale blue eyes. “You have a hole in you, I can feel it. Will you be able to make peace?”
how much effort I’ve put into the Manor, to return it back to the Light--you and Ronald have come and helped me, for Merlin’s sake! How could you even suggest I give up my home, the home of my family for eons?”
For he couldn't bear to stay a moment longer—not if Harry.
As were their cocks, half-erect and silky smooth with magical emollient. A great deal of it:
Harry--the infuriating git--at last deigned to glance up from his bastarding mouldy old tome, eyes wide behind his smudged specs.
—exactly what Draco hadn't wanted. Potter w
"Oh, yes." Draco, satisfied with a job well done, thrust his own arm out and shook it impatiently. "Of course, Harry. Doesn't it figure? Do mine now," he added, and the hand still at Harry's spine spread wide and possessively, a living blanket at his back. "Do mine," he said again, nuzzling away at Harry's earlobe, lipping it. "I want to see yours on me. On…us."
“Uh...huh,” Pansy replied, dryly, apparently not at all impressed by what was quite possibly the best single example of flying Draco had ever been blessed to witness. “If you say so, darling.”
He'd much schoolwork to catch up on before mid-June rolled around. Far too much valuable study time had been lost to mending the Cabinet and his poor attempts on the Headmaster's life, and his grades reflected that, sadly. But Potter had mentioned they'd swot DADA together, and Charms, and Draco looked forward to it. He looked forward to nearly any excuse that intimated additional hours spent in Potter's company.
Runes, of course, as the UK Wizards understood them. So, some derived from the Norse and some from the Picts and then the Romans, the Druids and various tribes and bands that had occupied the Isles over time. But not only those. Harry learnt of others. The larger world was full of many different sorts: the staves of the Baltic areas, the worn-away glyphs and faded pictographs, the markings and scratchings on tipped-over standing stones, the painted ochre and charcoal handprints found hidden away within caverns and mounds. All of these and many, many more, in Europe and Africa and all the continents--they had spoken to him. The magic of those ancient Elder messages shouting out, down from the times even before mankind--and Wizarding kind--had even begun to bury their dead, all of them called out to Harry, and he could not help but to
—using an especially loud
The Muggles only gasped a bit—bless them—at the sight of two young men. Strangely-garbed young men at that, wearing weirdly sewn topcoats against the cold and ratty mufflers badged with school patches no one recognized, and with sparkling, bemused eyes, made only for one another. Only gawped kindly but quietly when the two clogged the bustling entrance, having paused to snog, the smaller of whom—the brunet one, with the interesting scar and those amazing eyes—practically flinging himself into the taller one's reaching arms.
"Erm," Harry wrenched his arms out from where they'd been trapped by Draco's sharp elbows. Very carefully he laid a palm on either side of Draco's bobbing head, his fingertips entangling with the silky strands that tufted out between them. The git was nipping at him with every other word. It stung but also felt contrarily marvellous—and his cock was so hard he was dizzy with it—as was Draco's—but this absolutely had to be cleared up first.
The onlooker's averted eyes proclaimed, their collective thought so loud it was almost audible, even over the steamy hiss of the espresso machine.
"But you'll still stay with
Really, that was all that mattered, when it came down to it, Draco concluded. Harry wouldn't have a clue what he'd started by going against Draco's express wishes—the sodding prat—till it hit him. Like a wall of solid cake, laced with the finest French brandy. In something like sixty-four separate tiers.
“Poor Harry,” Harry heard Lavender whisper to Ginny; that only made it all the worse, somehow.
"Fuck me, fuck me blind," he bitterly informed the filthy underwear, the strewn-about
Draco reared back, nimbly avoiding his father's sudden grab through the Floo connection. Thank Merlin for the fire screen, right. "Right, at a later date, I think. End of term. Let you know my plans for the summer and how they pan out, yes? Er—brilliant! Good! Toodles! And—good night now!"
, Harry. Try it. Use Legilmens. Go inside me, go inside my brain. Everything, anything you want—I don't care. I want you to. Just….just see."
He sneered and swallowed hard, his throat working, and allowed himself the faint relief of pinching his sinuses, to relieve the pounding pressure.
Draco opened grateful eyes to a crowded, low-ceilinged country kitchen with a feeling of utmost relief, and felt Harry immediately relax beside him.
"It's alright, then? Draco?" Potter peered up at him, panting a bit and scanning Draco's pale features anxiously. "Draco! Talk to me, git! Don't just stare at me!"
"Talk to me, Harry," Draco coaxed, his mouth twisting. "Tell me how you want me!"
"What?" demanded Weasley, flushing. "It's just an expression, for Merlin's sake. Shut the fuck up, Harry!"
Harry's sake and to shove the admittedly bare-naked facts of the Potter-Malfoy alliance straight up the nosy, pointy and, above all, disapproving nostrils of their unhappy audience. "…Oh?" He arched a brow at the Gryffin-gits. "Kneazle got your tongues now? Nothing to more to say, peoples?"
“It is,” Harry agreed softly, gazing again at the claviform. “It definitely is. We should go, though,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder at the little knot of Muggles behind them. “No point in wearing out our welcome, is there? And it was only this one, fortunately.”
All ultimately due to Malfoy’s damnably attractive hair. Like, er…Lake water, that.
He wasn't an idiot; not he! He wasn't gullible, either—so, erm, what exactly was Malfoy implying? Odd, how?
"Marry-me-p-p-please?" he squeaked, though his throat had closed tight, like a porthole against the rushing sea of emotion pouring up his esophagus. "H-Harry? M-Marry?"
"Mmm," Draco agreed with that idea; he'd enough to do, what with staring down the Swot and the Weaselbee. "M'kay. But...hurry, Harry."
"…t's cruel," Draco could only protest it, this outrage. This…oddity. "That's...that's really cruel. Harry." His head sank down, slumping shoulders going with it. His whole body felt thinned out, compressed; he even went flat on his heels as if waiting for the carpet to swallow him. He clasped his arms about himself very tightly, to hold it in, his not understanding. This not-Harry. "I never knew you were…that you could be…mean, Harry."
"Er, Draco?"  Harry looked well and truly puzzled. "What?"
? No, it’s not brilliant, Ron!” Harry thrust his hands out in a silent plea, scattering muffin crumbs. “You’ve totally got the wrong idea—and, and will you please just
must, 'cause
Both students craned their respective necks, staring about them again for any signs of sapient life, the whisper of their nearly inaudible Seek spells falling away into the comfortable silence of a hundred thousand spines and a million plus pages. There was only the hush of books at rest and respiring, musing through their own ToCs and finally at ease after a long day of students manhandling them. Nor were there any muffled squeals or giggles to be discerned from swotting Firsties, nor the shuffle of rapidly riffling leaves turned by speed-reading Ravenclaws—peaceful, it was, in the Hogwarts library…
,” Harry replied staunchly. “I choose this, same as you. Not doing a bunk now, no fear.”
“That could be, Harry. But…it sounds to me, ah, as if you’ve put a fair amount of thought into this.
“Oh, er…nothing, darling.”  Pansy smiled sweetly. “All is just fabulous; not a thing to worry your lovely hair over, dear.”
“Why would I ever do that, Nott?” she replied, staring. “Do I look like an Elf? Summon some if you want it so badly.”
He only smiled (he nearly managed to hide the warm sweet degree of it, the bugger, by half-smirking; twisting sideways and off-kilter what was really just an actual, honest to Merlin
! This was just too exciting—too utterly freeing, after the horrible events of last year. He felt entirely alive again—thanks to the git (with his long throat and acceptable eye colour…even if it was obscured behind reflective lenses at the moment.)
"That's not all I am!" Draco growled, grinding his cheekbone against Harry's fiercely. "That weas never all I was and you know it!" Stubble grabbed and burnt pink trails across features unbearably strained. They were rubbing one another raw, not that they hadn't been, already. Draco hated it—hated that he'd denied it, all these days. Hated that Harry seemed so stuck on it, and had never, not once, forgotten, as he had. "Look at what I
Draco Malfoy—master of the verbal cut-and-slash, commander of snark and banter, the very epitome of all that was ornately verbose and pointed—stuttered, mumbled, gagged and gasped. Was completely inarticulate—was a right berk.
“Like
get a grip, will you? Bloody girl! Going on about my arse! Damn it!"
"Mmph!"
“Well, you were right.” Harry grimaced, frowning at the files shoved to the edge of the coffee table. “It’s a bit consuming, being an Unspeakable. I love it, I do. But, Malfoy? I’d not have left, you know, if you hadn’t been happy with your life. Did you know? I thought about it a lot, when I was offered the Journeymenship. That I didn't want to leave you if you weren’t going to be okay with it.  Happy with Theo, too, I suppose. I’m sorry that didn’t work out for you, you know.”
"Oh! Oh,
told me all about it—showed me the candids, Hermione! He's bloody smiling at her, that little bi-bint—right in Madame Puddleby's! And she's got a bloody great diamond rock on her finger!"
be the one? Why can't
his blessings, whatever they might've been. Poor unlucky sod.
Draco, as was his wont, didn’t reply in words, so much.  He was an action sort—the kind who liked to be mysterious and cryptic. Wanted to be interpreted, like a Rune or a code or a puzzle.
“Pshh,” Harry said, ushering Draco into Grimmauld’s ornate dining room with a smirk. “Tosh. I suppose it’s alright.”
"Oh, you fool!" Harry told the wind, grinning like a loon. "Just wait half a tick—I'll be there, I swear. Idiot!"
“But yes, darling. You could, is what I think we’re all saying, darling,” Pansy replied gently. “It’s that you may, if you choose to. Harry’s very much on board with this; he loves you, Draco. Has for a long time, I think, and likely did even before you started that thing with Theo. Point is, now you both have a chance to bring it together, do something, commit to something--but only if you chose to.”
"Pah!" Weasley sputtered, his hands clenching into fists. "Bosh! How you can find it in you to think any part of
. Throbbing, they were—slick-sliding against each other with every inhale and exhale, every twitch and wiggle.
"Out!" he demanded querulously, standing tall as he could manage, gathering his gaping shirt about him protectively. "I want out, Harry! You never said I'd have to deal with this, damn t!"
"Harry."
"Draco," Potter's voice was quite adamantine and unyielding. "Just
"Oh-gods!" Harry squeaked, for it panged and it burnt and he was being stretched to the point of ripping and he could care less. Only wanted more of it, more of being Malfoy's. "Ye-ye-yes!" he managed, as Malfoy jerked his hips back, a slippery sucking noise accompanying it, one that dripped of lust, inbound. Harry closed his eyes tighter, almost unable to bear it, it was so fantastic. "Oh-oh-ah-ye-!"
Potter was clearly losing his patience.
“Oh. Sorry!” She smiled at him in apology, though it was a weak, watered-down version. “Harry. Right, er, my mistake—you’re practising
"Oh, yes!" Adrian practically danced in his seat. "And it will be worth every Knut, darling!"
“What? Is that your bloody motto? And, in its further favour,” Draco responded sternly, “it’s a much better idea than what you’ve gone and inflicted on poor old Grimmauld Place. Grimmauld is so far from the ideal of a honeymoon destination, Potter, it’s in a different galaxy. Perhaps Alpha Centauri. You really need to ask Hermione's help; find a better solution than renting it out nightly. Kreacher’s not looking at all well these days. Terribly haggard. For Kreacher, Harry, that’s saying rather a lot. He’s not spritely on a good day.”
"Well…yes."
"Really? Wasn't sure, when I came in," Harry glanced up, grinning wryly. Perhaps he wasn't as sodden with Firewhisky as Draco had thought. The light in his eyes seemed almost…intelligent. "That you were—missing me, that is. Thought you were vexed with me, Draco, instead. Not too fond of our Lav, are you?"
"I'll, uh—er, yes," Draco mumbled, not quite audibly. He very seldom blushed like this—not a brilliant scarlet all over, from the roots of his blond hair to the curl of his toes. That habit had been shed long ago, along with his playful attempts at badge-making and silly songs. These days he was all about being cool—chilly, even—and always composed. A man in a man's world, doing a man's job. Men didn't blush like Firstie schoolgirls.
"Pish-tosh, Harry."
Which would one day become Draco's stately ancestral pile. Though he hoped not, Father's distempered fits aside, not for a good long time to come. Harry wouldn't be very happy there, Draco knew. And that, at least, was an aspect of his life he'd control over. The Dower House—safely on the other end of the Village of Malfoy—would do nicely for them, later.
"Get out. Out's over there, remember?" Harry said,
“Oooh,” Ron batted his red lashes at Harry, raising broad greasy palms to fend him off.”Touchy, touchy, mate! Feeling defensive?”
Not enough, that. Little scraps, here and there. Not enough.
Draco sniffed, having waved his mother off for the evening. She'd some sort of drinks do to dress for; he'd be forcibly dragging himself away from the bounds of the Nursery wing e're long, no doubt, having been waylaid on the way to his dinner.
“Yes! R-Right. Yes. Okay. Later.”
“So, yes, meant to enquire before. Are Luna and Rolf are settling in alright at the Manor?” Harry asked idly, turning his head and opening his eyes to gaze curiously over at Draco. Draco blinked, startled, and stared back at his friend. It was as if the man could divine Draco’s thoughts!  “Hear any good news yet on their Happy Families front from them?”
"Wh-what?"
“I know l’m grateful to have such a brave and intelligent Wizard at my side, every day. A cunning and courageous one--a forgiving one,” Draco crooned, his voice silken smooth but also disarmingly sincere. “I don’t know that I deserve it, but I’m lucky, I think. Circe blessed, to have such a brilliant person in my sphere and in my care. I don’t honestly believe you feel the same, of course--that would be asking too much, wouldn’t it? Arrogant. But it’s frankly amazing to me to be here, every day, working so closely with you. And of course I do worry, constantly. You’ve always managed to terrify me, Potter--even if now it’s in an entirely different manner.”
“Yes, well.” Draco hastily slid by him, palming his dry handful of Unspeakably grey powder. “I, um. Must be going. It’s funny you should say that, though.”  He glanced back over his shoulder.
—that aroma of clean skin, male sweat and lemony aftershave tonic.
"Now, Draco...it's a lovely arse you have-"
Pairing: Harry/Draco
who has to fix it after? I mean, really, enough's en—
"Oh, Harry! Have you not told him?" Hermione prodded at Harry, not two minutes after he'd been goaded into 'sharing his feelings' one lazy late September afternoon down on the lake shore. "You really should tell him. In fact, you
…It was much later Draco explained it all, as he understood it, at least. His Grandme're's ring, the spell upon it, what it meant and what he wanted of Harry in exchange for it.
"Fuck me, Malfoy," he whispered, and Draco didn't need to be told again.
It was mortifying. Harry struggled manfully not to hyperventilate. What he'd admitted could prove a terrible, horrible mistake…or it could not. Only Draco Malfoy knew the answer to that.
Harry inched up on his elbows and took in the same sad and sorry sight his boyfriend had just freaked over: books upon texts upon parchments and scrolls, all damp and streaked, oily and sparkling here and there, as if they'd been dipped in lube and dusted with coloured glitter. In heaps and in piles and scattered far and wide, in a great semi-circle about the wobbly worktable's environs.
“Shut up,” Harry retorted, clutching at the edge of the desk in an effort to keep his balance.
Word Count: 11,000
heart.
“Huh. So
"Oh, but—you." Harry glared up at the glittering gaze above him, the one that sought to strip him down to rag-and bone; remove every pretention. Not that he had any left, after Draco. "You just said—didn't you? Why are you? I mean.
Draco talked through it, the throbbing sound; 'round it, below and above it, desperately. Listing reasons, trotting out data, talking up Veela and Malfoys and the many positive attributes he could boast of, despite being only nineteen years of age.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I'm sorry, I was a right twat, Draco,” Harry was sobbing as he clambered onto Draco’s bed, dragging aside the duvet and rapidly wrapping himself around a startled Draco like a smaller, frenzied relative of the Giant Squid. “I didn't mean it, not a word I said, I’m just--and it’s so--and I can never say anything that matters,” he wailed, gulping and blinking, specs all askew, glinting crazily in the all too suddenly bright lamp light. “And you hate me, you must hate me, ‘cause I can never ever do it right; I dunno even know what it
"She should be, Draco!" his partner protested. "She
"Sorry, luv," Harry shrugged and wended his arms a bit tighter 'round Draco's waist, snuggling. "Wish I'd been here, instead. Stupid drains, the Muggle ones—always mucked up. And poor Lav—she's a right mess, she is. I just…I just feel so sorry for her, now. She needs her friends about her."
, personally, couldn't wrap his brain 'round the concept of reading about made-up people's romances for fun. Why bother?
“So…come July, we’ll do something special, alright? For your birthday.”
way faded to the silvery-yellow of advancing age, despite that (very) few months in Wizarding gaol, off and on, after one Trial or t'other. Ahem, his hair—was silky-smooth about his well-clad shoulders, the coif exquisite, but yet waving wildly about with the sheer velocity of his internal miff-dom.
“Oi, it’s not just that!” Potter protested, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze. “Sometimes we do have to confront Dark Magic, you know. This isn't all about making rubbings and speculating over ancient spelling errors. Sometimes there’s actual danger.”
“You have, have you?” Draco drawled, sitting back again and crossing his arms across his chest. He sniffed. They’d played this same scene out numerous times since they’d moved into the flat. “That’s bleeding hilarious, Potter. You weren’t even home two hours ago, when I left a floo message at your office asking you to let me know whether I should pick up food and Millicent said you were deep in it and she’d not heard a peep out of you since luncheon. How would you ever had time to make supper, here at home? You were at work.”
"Would you look at that, Draco?" Harry grabbed at his lover's shoulder and jiggled it urgently, pointing rudely off at the corner champagne fountain. He didn't seem to notice Draco was in the classic position of The Lover, Approaching the Culmination of a Proper Courtship. Draco snorted darkly. "Merlin! And—and—is that a chocolate one, too?
Ron shrugged, his eyes only vaguely on the crowd of students before them. “Okay.”
"With the right style…" Brown had crowded Longbottom up against the teddy bear and was sifting her fingers through his hair, her expression one of bemusement. "Maybe…"
"Silly boy! Of course. Love does render one rather incoherent, doesn't it? How delicious!"
"But we
your mettle, Harry. I truly do not believe I can bear to be in this house a single fecking second longer, not as it is
"—so you must marry me, Harry, and this is the ring, right here," he galloped on with his massive fail of a proposal, thrusting the box at Potter's half-curled hands and scowling his darkest ever, his wings pounding air a mile a moment. There was a steady shower of down filtering through the atmosphere of the garishly scarlet Common Room; it looked like early snowfall had come overnight, rather. "My Grandme're's—very important. Special, Harry. And you'll place it on your damnable finger right now, won't you? For—for me? Harry? Won't you? Say you w-will!"
Harry had been approached by one of the Mysteries representatives for a potential position even before he'd begun his final year of study.
Harry quirked his eyebrows, felt the tiny frown growing on his forehead smooth out, just like magic. Watched Draco, same as he'd suss out a napping dragon he'd had the bollocks to tickle.
Perhaps this was what Potter looked like when he was happy? Draco wondered. If so, he liked it. Made him want to break out into a bit of a goofy grin himself.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione glared at him. "You just had lunch, Harry. Merlin!"
, proposing marriage to Draco. Bloody kids, even!
“Of course I’m still here. I can’t very well finish this afternoon’s report without you. But,” he went on, making a business of looking Harry over as Harry slung himself into the chair opposite. “Are you quite well? You look a bit...skew-whiff. Scarlet. And green, too. Not a very attractive combination, at least not in my opinion.”
“I know, Pansy,” Theo nodded, a concerned frown wrinkling his brow. He turned his eyes to Draco. “Hmmm. Perhaps a visit to Pomfrey?”
Then came the Playroom. Tea sets and Potions sets, brightly coloured blocks and intricate puzzles, Gobstones and Muggle board games, Martin Miggs and
Draco also winced, recalling his own troublesome Nursery with its newly enhanced Potter-appeal. Spiderwebs? Really? And that was attractive?
As to that: a fortune had been spent to make it so very…pristine—this, Draco knew from his Goblin accountant. Father 's rapacious claws had been barely kept out Draco's Trust Fund he'd been left by dear old Grandfather Abraxas. What with all the Galleons Lucius had determinedly doled out in the effort to eradicate all traces of both the Dark Lord and the Aurors from his ancestral pile, it had better damned well better be a bloody National Wizarding Trust Gold Seal Residence. Father would not, it seemed, put up with even the tiniest of besmirchments upon either his person, his Heir,
"Lightning Strikes Events, Ltd.," Draco replied dryly. He'd found the name of the establishment most fitting, given the circumstances. "Those last are for Beltane Betrothal Ceremony I've planned, though. Naturally, I'll need the other order—the 'Love Speaks' posy— delivered immediately, as soon as it's made up, and then the same again for every day between now and—"
"What?" Hermione probed, scalpel-sharp, never missing a trick, a fleeting shift to her expression Draco couldn't quite interpret. Or couldn't be arsed to, actually. "What, Draco? You're laughing?"
for each of them, but it was still Harry, and thus it was
"But you have to listen," he insisted, furtively edging closer. "You owe me."
"Shut it, you. Look, I wonder if she even realized we were still back here? That's not like her."
"Grrrr!" he growled. "Sod it. Sodding Malfoy. Bloody walking about like he's all that."
Woe and mayhem. There had to be a better way, Harry figured. He just didn’t know what that was yet, and Malfoy’s hair was a matter of some observational urgency. He’s have to find a discreet way to get closer.
"You say this," Draco said tersely, "but you've not seen it yet, have you?"
“Oh, so beautifully soft!” the arse babbled on, relentless, making as if he were fluffing out his own blaze of ginger hued thatch and preening before an unseen mirror. “So pretty! I’ve never seen such as shade as Lake water! Tell me, Draco—which stylist d’you fancy? I must make an appointment with him forthwith!”
Draco snapped his teeth, sharply, simply recalling that terrible, awful scene. Harry had had to rush through the Floo after Luna wandered blithely through it, off on her way to parts unknown, claiming airily she wished to live her life solely in the company of the blasted Nargles from then on, and
carry on with it? I'm waiting."
! IF I
"Um." Granger stared wall-eyed at Draco, a faint blush rising fast upon her youthful cheeks. "Um, um. Uh, Harry? Why is, ah—why, precisely, is Malfoy here?"
, Draco knew. Even if Harry didn't, because he was him. "No! Listen, I have it! Legilmens, Harry. Use it. On me, in my head. Just go on in, poke about and see, for once in your life—please just see. See how I am for you. See me, Harry-
Gallantly, Draco raised his chin, adjusting to the new, smoother rhythm, and then ventured to propping himself upon his elbows. Granger and the Weaselbee should see this, he thought; him being pummeled by their precious Potter.
." He laughed, dark and sharp, so deep in his chest that tremors shook them both, as close against each other as they were pressed. "And what does that even
"Huh." Harry humped a careless shoulder. "What can I say?" he asked, bleakly. "You're very fit and I—"
“You say this, dear one,” Pansy grinned, “but I don’t think you quite know what it means. Oh, no, no. Don’t shush me, Draco. Let me finish, please. After all, you came to me, darling. I certainly didn't drag you here, wailing and gnashing.”
Harry smiled. "You're the best."
He hadn't expected a reply and of course he didn’t get one. Potter was just like that, sometimes.
"Yes, yes."
"Oh, my gawds," Harry gulped, closing his eyes tight in sheer frustration. "You barmy sod! Woo me? Like you'd actually have to! Merlin!"
He thought of Draco, naturally enough, as he moved about the market, seeking out bits-and-pieces to add to his collection of possibilities. The bothersome, nosy git had become his roommate by then, what with Ron and Neville matriculating and moving on, and he’d been instrumental in dragging Harry off to a Runes elective course ‘for a lark, Potty’.  But it had sucked Harry’s somewhat dilatory devotion to academics right up, and right smart about it, no question. All those years he’d spent solving the puzzle that was Voldemort (and Grindelwald before him), all that energy he’d believed would be best slaked by becoming an Auror? Well, it had found a shiny new sluice-gate to pour through--he winced internally at his own mediocre metaphor--and turned into a great roaring river, one leading to an enormous, inviting sea of fascination beyond.
"Um," Draco nodded, slumping forward. "Lovely, thanks. And, um, more," he begged, "and, erm, yes!—harder. Show must—show must go on, what?"
“About five minutes remaining, I should think,” Draco replied calmly, easing himself upright. He stepped away; Harry missed his departing warmth intensely. “We may finish the report for Peesely if you like. And then you may go, as you so wish. But safely.”
Sadly, Jera was still paramount and there were more pressing problems than any of those happening in faraway lands. His agents in the field were competent, his agents at HO were capable, and it was his bounden duty to act the bloody Polestar he was meant to be now and trust them all to get on with it. Besides, Antwerp was frightfully insistent, as usual.
"Oh, thank Merlin! Good man, Malfoy!"
“There was?” Draco exclaimed, casting his quill down and leaning forward to peer at Harry. “Merlin, Potter--where? We swept that room with Revelio, remember?”
“Well, I should hope so,” Draco smirked, resettling himself into his plush armchair. He cocked a teasing eyebrow at Potter's relaxed stance. “I'm the best thing that ever happened to you at Flamel, mate; admit it. You'd not have survived without me, certainly. Appalling gaps in your basics, our first year. One would think you'd been raised in a--"
"Mmm, dear?"
"Yeah, yeah, you said that, git," Harry muttered, waving a hand carelessly. "But what sort?"
—you tit—it's not a love potion, per se, he wants of us specifically; it's one that'll manipulate emotions. This one does that and far more efficaciously than your little Vane bint's bollocks-upped brew ever did. We're talking pure, unalloyed lust here, Harry, when it's been distillated properly—not some simpering hearts-and-flowers
"And not hurt his so-fragile heart-strings, Potter?" Draco allowed his heavy head to fall upon the Saviour's convenient shoulder with an equally weighty sigh. "What about mine, then? They don't matter in the slightest, because that sod Malfoy's a tough bastard and he won't be bothered by it?"
. A very good time, a brilliant time, the best possible time of all, in fact. Can’t think of a better one, actually.”
"Y-Yes," Draco swallowed, blinking rapidly, vaguely aware his Mum had asked of him several questions recently. What exactly they were didn't matter—he'd been too busy musing to pay heed, so he'd have to simply wing his response and hope she'd be satisfied. Because, knowing his Mum, he wasn't likely to obtain what he wanted without first making her happy. "Yes, well, it's not been particularly easy, Mum, all of this. Very—very unexpected. And, erm, yes, we've—we've engaged in a—in some mutual expression of affections—not public, mind you!—and, and truly, Mum, I must allow I do find it still a bit unbelievable that he, of all possible people, is the one—" That tumbled out of Draco's mouth, quite unexpectedly. "That I—that I, ah…have come to regard so highly."
"But…I love you."
“Fuck you too, Pans,” Draco sneered. “Like I needed to hear that.”
"Er…but."
Could be bollocks, so blue they resembled nothing so much as overly large berries; could his nostrils, saturated in eau de Draco; could be his tendons, which appeared to have loosened and tangled.
. Now go away, before I bloody well make you go. Take your poncey arse out of my face, out of my house. Because I can't stand you being here, in my home. This is mine, mine alone."
"Yeah?" He risked showing the grin, the one he'd been hiding. And was rewarded, right smart.
! Draco snorted, and viciously rearranged the drinks decanters on the polished walnut sideboard, checking for any dust the house elves had missed. There was none, but that wasn't terribly satisfactory. There was more at stake than mere housekeeping, here.
something." Harry's irritating know-it-all best friend chirped brightly at him, swooping forward in her seat suddenly and poking Draco's kneecap painfully with the tip of her wand for emphasis. "To fix it up with Harry. Take action, you gormless limpdick or, mind you, I
, Malfoy," Harry glared, tightening his grip on Draco's hand just a bit more than strictly necessary. "I like it here and Mr. Kringleshanks always has just what I'm looking for." Potter dragged him peremptorily over to a largish dusty glass case with an ancient cash register atop it, filled with an array of silver: chains, bracelets, necklets, rings and the like. Draco found his eyes zeroing in on the rings. For some reason.
Malfoy, in clear rejection of the sombre tones of his recent past, was only ever seen clad in white, and sometimes the cream, silver or very pale grey shades, but always hues of palest transparency or slight opacity that obliquely advertized his change-of-heart—and loyalties. He glided about the school like a Fallen Angel and caused all the lesser Years daily swooning sessions over his good looks, excellent manners and incredible charm. Some claimed he was Veela, his appeal was so pervasive. He might be Fallen, and perhaps even Resurrected, but in no way was he scorned.
"What the fuck?"
"I'll--I'll--I'll KILL HIM!" Lucius ordered, in a tinny little roar, but clearly enunciated. "I will!  For daring—to shame you—with this rigmarole over your Bonding! Bonds are sacred--Bonds are sacrosanct! Bonds are not the purview of rude little Gryffindor upstarts!
Lucius gibbered; Narcissa's hand could be seen turning quite white at the knuckles.
." Draco swallowed. "Please, Harry. Don't. Don't say that."
"You will, won't you?" The pleading edge to his voice—so unfamiliar and wrong—was long gone, replaced a very determined steely glint. Give a Malfoy a scant inch to run with and they'd parlay it into a lifetime. "After we matriculate, Harry, naturally. Mum will organize it for us, you know. In fact, I don't think I can stop her. She adores events such as weddings. Really, it's her forte."
Harry
Those Kneazle kittens, for example, and their adorable antics as they gamboled about on the wallpaper, playing with their painted Charmed yarn balls.
"Yeah."
Harry snorted in disbelief, his lips set in a bitter twist.
Naked skin slid deliciously across skin at every point of contact; they both felt the unusual level of slickness that coated and drenched, concentrated mostly down by their respective bits, but every-bloody-where else as well. Excepting their heads, of course; that would've been awkward…and possibly dangerous. Harry moaned as he slithered a hand up his boyfriend's slinky spinal; Draco exulted.
He was squeezed abruptly, uncomfortably tight, and had to wriggle about fretfully to gain enough leeway to be comfy again.
"So that's what happened," Draco murmured softly. "Mum was correct, then. Or her 'bird' was."
“Oh-gods-shut-the-fuck-up!”
"No, no. Not
Oh, Merlin—
Draco ignored them both, by and large. Personally, he was oblivious by then, excepting the exceptional length of Potter engorged and moving smoothly within his backside. 'Specially when, with an extra jerk and throb, the nub of Harry's willy repeatedly banged away at his prostate.
It was late in the evening and he was knackered as fuck, but all-in-all it had been a fine day's work he'd put in. The youngest Abraxans had been cooperative with short sprinting flights in their enclosure, Luna had evinced a real and solid interest in the day-to-day work of maintaining the prized Malfoy honeybee hives. Her paramour Rolf had proved a dab hand with directing the field management plan for the Home Farm; the courgettes were longer and firmer than ever before. Both of them seemed to be in the veriest pink of health and blissfully well shagged after a mere month in residence. The Manor had provided Draco a luncheon hamper of simple but hearty sandwiches and cress soup, with nary a raw oyster or champered strawberry in sight.
"You shouldn't have, really."
“Do I need to use a Silencio, then? And some Sticking Charms? I will, you know. Just keeping pushing, Nott.”
Clearly startled by Draco's interruption but beaming full-face and ever so brightly nonetheless, like a very messy-headed beacon, Potter popped up to his feet, rising like Venus on the proverbial from the mountainous miscellaney of papery ephemera, all strewn across the surface of an impressively gold-embossed leather blotter.
"I'm." Harry's fingers slid from where they'd gripped Draco's upper arms, relaxing enough to trickle and slide and grasped and found their eventual way between two close-clamped elbows, squirming through the gaps, meeting up and latching tight on the other side, where Draco's spine bowed inward. Clenched interlaced till Harry's knuckles turned white and Draco swore at the painful intensity. "I'm
“Oh-ah-aaa-eehh-eee-iiii—ohhh—youuuu!” Ron sang out. Harry gawped at him.
Draco, swimming a rosy haze of anger and anguish, decided promptly he would remove the arse's gorgeous, touchable skin in small pieces and with a sharp dagger, dip it in a highly flammable acid, toss it in hot cauldron, watch it fritter 'round the edges till it was golden-brown, and then Incendio the remainder to ashes. Then, for good measure, he'd distill those same Potter-ashes to a fine liquor and spray it all over his mother's prized blue roses as fertilizer. Just to begin with.
be a good thing, mate.”
“I’ve been, er…”
Harry rubbed his palms together, eyeing the still singing git. The glassware had began to hum in protest.
"Oh."
"Oh…well. Fine, then. Legilmens!" Harry sighed. Sighed again as the spell came whispering, creeping up. He shut off the light that was his startled, wondering eyes by simply closing them, leaving Draco in the dark. Draco closed his own, knowing the dark was better shared. Besides, he'd be dizzy in a second. "Okay—
, Harry!"
"Ahem. Harry." Draco coughed meaningfully. "Down here, Harry! Do pay attention."
, Harry. You once said you'd always, always love me, Harry. Love me till we both died. You
Draco raised his chin and rubbed fretfully at the scruffy stubble with a damp grubby palm. His eyes were red-rimmed, his immaculate self long since overlaid by a grey sort of fug, one that spoke of prolonged tension and sorrow. The flat was covered with a thin layer of dust, papers and clothing abandoned in every corner, carryaway boxes half-consumed and left ignored. It smelled. So did Draco's body, just a bit. He didn't give a fig; he deserved to smell bad.
“Infirmary,” Luna answered simply, wordlessly holding out her own mug for a top-up. She shook her head carefully, wincing as she did. “Pepper Ups and a full day’s rest, the Healer said. Poor thing.”
The voice in Harry's head was tranquil and serene. Harry grinned, for the cock quivering deeply within him was decidedly not; it took breath clean away. He could only shudder as Draco lunged up, flexing his thighs beneath Harry's bum.
“Oh,” Ron blinked, staring at Neville blankly for a moment. “Oh, right. Sorry, I’d forgotten. Want me to spell that for you?”
Draco was having no part of this. There was Courtship, and Courtship had Rules!
"Oi, Harry," Millie hailed briskly, trotting into his office with yet another heap of that last category, the ones that were only fair copies. "Incoming, mate." She dumped them unceremoniously into a spare empty rubbish bin and straightened up to grin engagingly at him, dusting off her hands. "Sorry about this lot, but it's all priority. I did my best to bump it back down to merely urgent but that elderly chap from Antwerp was insistent. You want me to bring you a bacon butty? I'm nipping out in a moment."
“Alright?” Draco scoffed, allowing himself to be seated. “It’s a bit more than alright. Picasso, mate. My Mum would die for one of those, really. Brilliant old Safavid you have laying about on the bloody floor, too. But," he sniffed, pulling a long face. "I suppose that’s the thing I really dislike most about you.”
It was mesmerizing, really, the way it gleamed like that—so changeable. He couldn’t take drag his interest away fully for the life of him, not even if his mates were individually falling to pieces over brekkers, all around him. “Huh,” he said again, softly, doubly bemused. “Maybe so. Can’t say as I mind being poetical. Maybe it’s an adult thing.”
the next bit.
Draco rolled his eyes back in his head. It was just like the Hogwarts Express, smashing some unwary Kneazle flat on the rails. Really. That fast, that shocking—that Gryffindor-batshit insane!
“Brilliant,” Harry nodded. “Peesely can piss right off, interfering old git. I like your settee better than mine anyway. Mine’s lumpy or something. Ahem. Shall we?”
A brilliantly flushed Hermione caught up her tea cup and downed the contents with an air of high dudgeon and flashing brown eyes, clearing up her issue in a trice. Then she glared at him nastily, as if Harry had insulted her by offering help.
"What did you mean, 'start right now', Draco?" Weasley asked. "Did you have something in mind for tonight? 'Cause if you do, I'll bloody well snog your feet out of gratitude, mate."
, his Mum. He fiddled with the Floo knob, instead, marking time till he could honourably escape.
"Wearing—" Weaselbee gulped hard, his eyes firmly fixed upon Draco's mussed hair, "wearing very little, mate? Is it a prank, then? Is he Imperious'd?"
"We'll need pumpkin juice, too, for the Youngers," Granger said thoughtfully, whipping out a notebook and a biro. "Patil, you need to check on the age of consent in Scotland, remember."
But ‘specially the meals. Draco could cook and would; Harry could cook but didn't particularly care for it. Neither of them were exactly keyed into eating things they should, when they should.  Veg, salads, all that. It was all a leftover habit from uni days, Draco figured, but that didn't mean it had to continue. Or perhaps it was related to their individual recent experiences navigating the sexually-themed cuisines both Grimmauld Place and the Manor had on offer. Honestly, a month or more unrelenting of eels and oysters, strawberries soaked in champers and steak tartare every single fucking meal time could radically damage a person’s appetite, Draco was fairly certain. Especially--in his own case--when it was interspersed with mashed yam, baby rice, rusks, and Bird’s Custard.
"'Kay, then."
"Of course you do, and you manage very well at it, but even so. A holiday won't kill you, son. Do as I told you and floo Harry, will you? I'm sure between the two of you you'll find some solution for the Manor's behaviour and then you'll be free to have a break."
“Alright. Hup!” Harry called out and cast, hard as he may. Draco felt it carry through Harry’s body and pass like a lightning arc over to his own, and he too cast, with as much strength as he could bring to bear.
Harry heaved an irked huff. Too much drama! He tuned it out with beetled brows and a narrow gaze trained on the sliding, rippling grace of Malfoy’s fringe. It was artfully trimmed and boasted its own set of inruguing shadows. Did a nice job highlighting the gits’ cheekbones and jawline, too. Harry raised a hand to his own hair, briefly wondering what Malfoy would say if he asked for the name of his barber.
He took a hasty gulp of his own tea, nerves skittering madly under his shaken façade; clearly, his Mum was no dummy. Possibly she was unnaturally precipient as well!
Fwwwaaawump! The spell ceased abruptly.
Amazing, however, though descriptive and apt, did not by any means confer either dignity nor oratorical skill upon a supplicant when one was placed in the peculiar position of begging one's hugely significant other to accept one's hand in marriage. But, heedful of his Mum's warnings about wasting no time in slamming that ring of Grandme're's upon Harry's finger, it was the very next evening Draco went down on one boney kneecap and proposed. To his Harry, like a proper Wizard. He made a right mash of it, naturally, but at least it was accomplished.
‘Stay.’
at least, though it'll do you no good, Potter. Not a whit!"
"Hurgh!" Draco, in the midst of swallowing the last dregs, had his tea go down the wrong tube; he coughed, grimacing horribly behind a polite palm. "You-you don't say, Mum," he gasped, startled. "Really?"
be discussing it later, Harry; don't think for a moment we won't!" the angry boy grumbled in a furious undertone. Only stopped there because Granger pinched him quite hard on the forearm, Draco noticed, wincing in unwilling sympathy. By Merlin, the Walking Library was a fierce one!
“Yeah,” Draco sighed, the little twinge of anxiety fitfully subsiding. “Okay, I sort of see your point. Though I can’t see how you’d ever think Kreacher was a better roommate than me.”
The prick overcame the fingers at last and plunged in, true to the mark. Harry was grasped and fumbled upright, a fold of wing and a spare arm encircling him in heat, till he was suspended above the hard unforgiving granite and slumping thankfully onto Draco's lap. Draco sat back on his haunches, Harry riding the slicked up skin and cartilage spine of his cock like a jockey.
“No, no, no; it’s worse than that, mate!” Ron flourished his sausage. “I think you’ve finally fallen, Harry.”
"…Draco. Draco." Harry's gaze flew swiftly, great green orbs of confusion behind the frames Hermione summarily replaced his old comfy ones with. He shoved them up his nose with the back of his hand, sniffing the air like a wary dog, his chilled fingers smoothing the velvet continuously. "Draco?"
"O-la-love! Harry, love!"
"Now,
hadn't.
…But in the meantime, they should likely Apparate home while they still could—being decent folk—and take their bloody escalating mutual passion off to a proper bed. Or so Harry's good sense said…but then, that was only a feeble, limp-wristed whisper, wasn't it? So much the better to shag out their relief –maybe in the loo, as it was handy.
! replied the Snitch—but Potter didn’t hesitate for a second!
! I know!"
"Oh, yes."
—up again, though he'd barely just let him go; hard and fast and all inclusive, practically lifting the smaller man right off his feet, burying his steaming hot face into Potter's frowsy, wild hair, "aslongasyoupromisetowearmine!"
It was so, so soft, the feel of Malfoy's mouth and yet it seared him. It left him jittery and blissed out and panicky in a good way—the best way. Sexual tension; the sort that one could hack away at with a butter knife for eons and never make a dent in: that was practically a palpable force between them, pulsing. And too, there was this godawful feeling of being left bereft when the quick, dry brush of lips withdrew, as if he'd been granted heaven for an instant, only to have it ripped away.
something about it, Harry. Don't be a wimp."
Oh, shite—who cared about some people’s apathy, anyway? Draco decided. Not
"That's not the point, Potter," Malfoy returned nastily, frowning blackly at his lap. "I'm not at all worried, thank you."
go. Inform Draco he’d like
The sky whirls away above him, the northern lights the only note of beauty, flickering in and out of Harry’s vision as he blinks slowly and concentrates, thinking steadily of Malfoy. Of Teddy. Of Ron and Hermione, of the Weasley’s.
Draco dropped his mug.

"Arrghh! I'm bushed!" And that was Harry right now, stumbling through their Floo, three hours later than he should be, and likely somewhat fly. "Heeey, Draco! Hiya!"
Harry laughed at him.
"Okay," Harry nodded eagerly. " Yes—
“Shhh!”
"Like that matters!"
Hermione, the traitor, giggled softly. Her eyes even a glazed over a bit as she watched Ron’s nimble tongue moving down the shaft of his sausage. Harry flinched miserably and turned pleading eyes to her.
"Hmm," Harry hummed, unconvinced. "Well, then what do we do? I don't want to hand this over to Slug and have it be the wrong one, Draco. We still have tomorrow morning to ask her."
What if this was just a passing interest—a fling of sorts for Harry? The Boy Who Lived was hardly the Boy Who Dated, now was he? Harry's experience had not been great when he and Draco had first come together. He wouldn't know, necessarily, when the other's persons affections were truly engaged? And—and Harry might simply think of what they'd done so far as dating. What if—what if this was all merely a flash in the pan, on his part? If Draco had misjudged the depth on both sides—if he'd guessed wrongly—
managed to get close to Harry because of Harry's naïve willingness to forgive, to make peace and let bygones be bygones. A little making up, a judicious spot of wine-plying, a snog or three in a nearby lav or a cloakroom and ultimately the 'bet'cha can't ignore
“Whoa there, sorry!” he gasped, righting himself. Instantly he took up a fighting stance, wand at the ready and other hand roughly shoving an unwary Draco behind him. "What's it?" he demanded, staring wildly about Draco's innocuously elegant foyer, his specs glinting in the morning light that poured through the transom. “What’s wrong--where is it, Malfoy? It’s not a Death Eater or something like, is it?”
"What?" Harry demanded intensely. "Are you talking about? Seriously, Draco, you're starting to frighten me now. A 'condition', you say? What does that even mean? Really, you need to rest more. I was always telling you that, back at uni, remember?"
Harry dug his fingers into Draco’s pristine sleeve, gazing up at Draco with all Earth's gravity contained in those famous green eyes, and so urgently Draco found himself not even slightly inclined to scold his friend for the wrinkles he was no doubt inflicting on the hapless fabric of his bespoke robes. Nor for the worry he'd apparently been needlessly feeling.
"Raidho
Gods, but Harry felt so greedy sometimes; it was a sin. No wonder he suffered, still; still...delightful!
"What's Kringleshank's, Potter? Another joke shop?" Draco sneered. Honestly, he appreciated a good prank as well as the next person, perhaps more, but Harry seemed unnaturally interested in them. Perhaps Potter was one of
"No—" There was nothing to do but stuff his face into Harry's throat; keep it there, where it was warm and Harry's cool voice was muffled. "Harry, no. That's not true."
Like this morning:
This is a place without honour.
“No more than you,” Draco replied equably enough. He smiled, giving a quick nod. “But go on, then. I’m all ears.”
"What's
"Nnn," Draco hedged, blushing a bit at his own lack of forethought. This was stupid;
“Ah! Ahahaha! Go for it, you little berk!” Draco cried out, oblivious of Nott and Pans slumping dispirited next to him, eyes glazed into utter boredom.
“Right, right,” Theo muttered, eyes wide. “Good, good. Ahem, whatever you say, Draco. He can fly. Potter can. This we know. Let’s leave now, alright? M’hungry.”
"No, sorry. I suppose I'm not, really, am I?"
(Incidentally, Draco had even half-mockingly cheered Harry on when a routine visit to the Ministry during Third Year for a crash-course in the inner workings of Mysteries had led to a chance meeting--and some rather spiffing shagging--with Harry's old Gryffindor Team Captain, Oliver Wood. A memorable shag which had become a repeated fling which had then morphed into an actual affair. Millicent Bulstrode, who was then attending Flamel by Owl and interning at the Mysteries Head Office meanwhile, must have been the one who kept the pointy bastard up to date on the details of Harry's on-again, off-again thing with the delectable Ollie for he never failed to tease Harry about it mercilessly. The ridiculously irritating and damnably
“About that. Supper with me at mine tonight? No time like the present, is there? Carpe diem, sieze the day, all that shite, and--and, Draco, I really could do with your help with, er, something. Ah-um,  something’s that’s cropped up since I’ve been home. To do with Grimmauld, actually.” Harry's intensely earnest stare shifted to a pointed look, a minor species of glare. "Besides. You still haven't told me what your trouble is, have you? A bloody 'condition'? What even does that even mean, anyway?"
“Ooo! I’m so frightened! What’re you going to do to me, Potterette? Wave that tiny wand of yours? Eek!”
Zabini, Harry—say it. And fuck this crap about you just wanting to shag—or show me off. That's laughable; I can't even think you'd expect me to lend that bullshit credence. Just. Harry. Whatever it was, just
"Now, now," Harry murmured, and deftly edged his rival yet closer to him by slipping an arm 'round his tense shoulders. A gentle patting did much to ease the knots in Malfoy's nape. "No need to be tetchy. I'm over that very short phase in my life—I swear."
“A Picasso? It is, yes," Potter smiled affably enough. "It was a  recent gift; thanks for asking. Grateful client, very American, you know how they are. He bestowed it upon me personally and I couldn't refuse. Not politic, right?"
a git and sometimes I really, truly hate you, Potter." Draco paused to swallow, the strangled sound loud in the ringing silence that filled Harry's ears. One of his hands came to cover Harry's, lacing tightly into the forlorn fingers that lay half-curled and abandoned from before. "You drive me spare; I never know what start you'll get up to next." He was clearly irritated with Harry's very existence; the humid sex-ridden air between them sizzled with it. The grip abruptly changed to punishing. "But I want you, all of the damned time, and I think of you when I can't see you. You're my sickness—I can't be shed of you."
"What,
“Keep mum, will you? I don't want it--them--to hear you right now, Potter! It’ll make it even worse!”
"Eeep!" Weaselbee's voice had also entered upon a higher altitude, where there was evidently far less oxygen. He sounded as though he'd huffed a great lot of that Muggle element, hydrogen. Er...helium. Or perhaps had stumbled upon a great nest of spiders. "Errrr..."
"Ma-Ma-Ma-!" Weaselbee stuttered. "Ha-Ha-Ha! H-Him? It's true, then? You're—you're—"
"Hmph!"
said," Draco dropped his head into his hands in patent despair. "To Harry. 'Dog in the manger', I said. About Blaise. I was…just kidding. Joking around. And then he left me."
"I should have expected it, really, but I didn't think…I mean I…only hoped."
Draco's internal organs twisted painfully—he gasped soundlessly, awash with pain. His ears buzzed. He'd made a grievous error, apparently, literally flinging himself at Harry's feet, pouring out his heart, offering up his trinket—he'd assumed far too much on the basis of far too little and now he'd made an absolute fool of himself.
doing merely to discuss
Harry, who just sat there, like a bloody knob, staring right back up at him, all wide-eyed, guile-less, butter-wouldn't-melt, and if he hadn’t just completely upended everything Draco knew to be true in the world. Like friendships, and expectations, and family, and, and, and--
, Harry, just some nonsense about me—and Zabini.
He smiled, a genuine grin that Potter matched instantly, and pushed himself off the wall, making his way back across the intricately woven woolen carpet.
Draco winced, subject to an entirely new surge of sheer fear. He'd assumed any number of things, recently, but….what if Potter—what if Harry really didn't feel the same as he did? He could rant and insist all he liked but if Harry wasn't in the same place as Draco was, it wouldn't matter a whit's worth, would it?
“Hmmm, Harry?” Draco hesitated, though, looking bemused. His eyes were focussed intently upon Harry’s mouth.
Harry.
Oh, oi? Had he been struck on the head recently, 'cause what was he
wasn’t bored—far from it! Potter’s arm seemed to stretch out fantastically long! Must be Magic! “Don’t let it get away from you, Potter! Catch it—
“And to be expected,” Luna chimed in, sitting back on her heels and throwing a hank of trailing blonde tresses over her shoulder. “We’ve returned home at last, there’s an upset and botheration amongst our relatives and loved ones; nothing bad, of course, but naturally. The runes would be sending messages of peace and serenity in this case, Harry.”
"Mmm," Draco couldn't quibble with that; he liked it when Harry touched him, damn it! "Still…there's no need to make up to me. You're not in hot water, you brainless dork."
"Here, then," he murmured softly, for they were close together as they could be, scrunched up on the one end of the table. The other shoppers had gone back to politely ignoring them, but for the occasional sly sideways glance of amusement. "We match."
"Mare Inlitus!" Draco exclaimed, not minding—and there
She only giggled, faintly belling sounds in the growing distance. Harry turned appalled, unbelieving eyes upon the countenance he knew so very well, it was bloody ridiculous. The familiar features were smirking at him, familiarly. Sexily—come-hither—no! Wait. Not
"Yes." He said it simply and let his fingers do what they willed, wreaking damage upon the present Draco had gotten him. Gone in a flash and crunch-crinkle was the green-and-white striped wrap, the ribbon of contrasting scarlet satin coiled uselessly round his discarded mug, tangling. "Yes—and make sure to do yours, will you? Same time as me."
, Harry? You’ve your eye on him…like that?”
They'd been lured to the refurbished Room by a slyly shy Potter, who'd promised them something big, something major—a 'special secret' he wanted to share.
It had, rather.
Those green eyes of Potter’s were bloody incandescent; Draco had no idea they could do that. Glow. Well, he did…Room of Requirement. His own parlour, too. He blinked in parted-lipped wonder at the blazing green brilliance and almost missed the shy ‘Thanks, again, mate!” that followed before Potter turned tail and hared off to his next scheduled lecture.
Harry spelled it clean and even went so far as to summon a tablecloth from the linens cupboard, shrinking it down to an appropriate size and accessorizing it with some rather fetching matching napkins Narcissa had Owled them over from Italy.
“Shut it, you flaming arse.” Draco's lip twitched. “I’m not, really. Just experiencing a very healthy and rational amount of concern at the moment, that’s all. As you should be, too, if you weren’t
For an instant, Harry's face took on an odd, adult sort of expression—rather as if he were sucking a lemon—but then that was replaced by irritated anticipation. "Look, Malfoy, we've only about a half-hour, tops, before Ron and Hermione will come looking for me. We've already missed dinner and if you want to do this—"
Harry, already in the act of stumbling and struggling to get his feet under him so he could sit up and face Malfoy like a man rather than a heap, managed to take the corner of it right to his unguarded temple. He fell back again on the plaid beneath him with a loud flop, feeling horribly dazed.
"Oh, Hermione! Heeer-miii—own—neeee!"
! Oh, Draco!"
"—and always, and always; never you worry, Harry.
"They're all connected, Harry, that 'other shit', as well—if you actually
together, you know? Me and Malfoy here: to-
He'd been blind all those years before that—deliberately so. Must've been, to not see what was so brilliantly obvious. Head up his own arse, blind.
Speaking of? Right about this time, Draco mused, leaning up against his flatmate, close enough to share body warmth, he'd wager the Manor’s current inhabitants were likely romping about the place fucking starkers. And shagging in the most unusual locations. He could confirm this because the week before he’d rather thoughtlessly dropped by his home without notice to retrieve one of his smaller lunascopes and had surprised them
"In astrology, an aspect is an angle the planets make to each other in the horoscope, also to the ascendant, midheaven, descendant, lower midheaven, and other points of astrological interest. Aspects are measured by the angular distance in degrees and minutes of ecliptic longitude between two points, as viewed from Earth. According to astrological tradition, they indicate the timing of transitions and developmental changes in the lives of people and affairs relative to the Earth."
“That’s—more—like—it, lover!” Malfoy grinned. ‘Say ‘ahhh’, now, little one! Take it! Take it all!”
"Nnh?" Harry's brows climbed higher, a skeptical dark slash above a deeply buried malachite glow. "Intrigued, are you? Hmm." His dust and ink-stained hands echoed the movements of his boyfriend's, but then went a bit further than that, fumbling down to unzip his flies on his entirely
"You don't know even what I am, Draco, who I am," he murmured, so close to Draco's ear, Draco could practically hear the words inside his brain, echoing. "And you seem to believe it's all a game with us, I swear you do. That that was all it ever was, all along. You don't see
"I think I like it," Malfoy smiled. He licked Harry's jaw, then dew back. "Yes," he announced. "Delish, Potter. C'mere, then."
Harry jumped, almost literally. "I-what?"
Draco remained tethered to Harry's side only by the spin of his wrist bones within the loosely constructed cage of Harry's sticky fingers. He could—and likely would—bolt at the drop of one more ill-considered word. It was an awful prospect to consider. Lowering.
A squabble instantly broke out; Harry retreated, fed up. Malfoy’s hair was looking better and better, over at the peaceful Slytherin table, just happily gleaming.
“Lovely, that. Brilliant, even.”
. I hate bloody meetings, even the ones I  bloody well look forward to. What's this, now?"
"Yes," he muttered, when Malfoy allowed him a chance. "Please, yes."
“So I arrive there, just as usual, and that despite seriously, consciously concentrating on getting off the bloody path it keeps sending me down and actually making it to my damned rooms and my own damned lav, right? I’m resisting and dragging my feet every step of the way but it’s like the strongest Imperius you can ever imagine. Right? Worse than the Mark.”  He laughed again, a little wildly. "Never thought I'd hear myself say that aloud in this lifetime, must admit."
with him, Merlin!” Draco babbled to himself aloud as he twirled and flailed every which way, needing to hear the sound of his own voice at least, because very little made any sense and that did, oddly enough. “Parkinson Hall--bloody Parkinson Hall,
Given the chance to move, Harry spun about, facing his tormentor full on. He leant his naked hip against the edge of the table and tapped a forefinger warningly to his pursed lips, doing his best to seem suave and dignified with his trousers about his ankles and his lips swollen from snogging.
“Hars, I am afraid it’s not going to come much clearer than this,” Millicent remarked, gathering up the most official--and thus most spiffing--set of rune stones the Department of Mysteries had available and dumping them unceremoniously back into their velvet sack. “Ansuz, Raidho, yes, all that’s here and clearly visible--”
"Sorry, sorry—say it, please?"
He reared back and stared aghast at his friend, nearly tumbling off the narrow bench seat they shared.
"Now, look here—" Hermione was at him again in that no-nonsense way of hers, rapidly scanning page after page all the while. "You're not helping your own cause, not by simply brooding over it. That's not your best choice, period. You need to get off your sorry arse and be proactive. Talk to him. Track him down and let him know you're interested, alright? Malfoy's not an idiot; he might see a decided advantage for himself, taking up with you. Give it a whirl, why don't you? You've nothing to lose but your miserable attitude."

It was their first time, really. In a bed, that was—with no possibility of someone coming round a corner unexpectedly or accidently opening a charmed door. It should be…it should be worth every Galleon Potter had paid for the ring Draco now sported on his finger; the bright silver gleam blooded with a small, faceted ruby.
"Then
gone into the office for the best part of the weekend.
Then he finally got his arse in gear, the wanker. Ceased with the infernal teasing and threw himself into shagging Harry with great good will—and a bounteous lot of sheer enthusiasm, advanced years or no.
“What?’ Draco muttered, not minding. “Oh, erm, no! Not yet, Pans. I have to watch the victory lap.”
“I see,” he said after a long and extraordinarily uncomfortable moment. “Is that what you really believe, Potter?”
Harry transferred his killer glare over to her.
“Well, I—“ Potter pinkened. “That’s very—“
"Um," Harry moaned, writhing his upper body all over Draco's, in the way that drove Draco mental. "You're
"No, really," Harry smirked, flapping a hand at him as if he were shooing a fly. "You stink. And I mean it. So. Leave me alone."
“Eihwaz, Harry,” Millie announced cheerily, trotting back into his office with the promised bacon butty and a very welcome coffee. Floating behind was another teetering stack of correspondence, however. “It’s all Eihwaz, today.”
Oh, gods, Harry—
and moving pictures of
They shouted, nearly in unison, Draco crying out 'Harry!' and Harry stuttering Muggle obscenities, and Draco went down in an exhausted heap next to his partner, gasping through his dried-out nostrils and swallowing over and over.
"Wha-whass going on?" MacMillan asked blearily. "Huh?"
! Coldly, viciously, nastily furious!
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry said automatically, and looked as though he were telling over his schedule mentally. "Wait, no—let me think for a half a sec. I've detention yet."
"Do tone it down a bit. Ease up. It's not your choice, remember? It's mine."
“Yes, of course. I’m sorry, alright?” Harry replied in a low mutter, instantly glancing off elsewhere. “Look, I just...I couldn't sleep," he informed Draco's reading lamp with a fretful scowl. "Thinking of how we rowed, literally over nothing, not a bleeding thing, and it felt hateful. Gut in knots, head aching, all that. I didn’t want you to wake up tomorrow morning and believe I was still vexed with you--or think you should be with me, either. It upset me, and the more I fretted over it, the more it did. That’s all.” He gave his head a little shake, his mop of hair shimmering blue-black in the golden light, and glanced back at Draco from beneath his ridiculous eyelashes. “Um.
, Harry. Don't go. Don't be this way. Come home with me. Don't be like this, so stubborn, so arse-headed. Come home with me, talk this out, talk to me, okay? We can fix it up—we can fix whatever it was, whatever I said; I don't even know what that was? I didn't mean it, alright? I never mean to be like tha-"
"Hmmm," Draco replied, slyly smiling. He winked, which sent Weasley blushing, just a tad. "As a matter of fact, dear Weasel, I did."
"No!" Draco made sure to confirm this. No, there was no one else. He couldn't conceive of
“Of course not, love,” his mum laughed merrily, brushing Draco’s confession aside. Her blue eyes gleamed, made eerily purple by the sparks from the spitting flames. “Now, have you floo’d Harry recently? Does he even know about this?”
“No,” Draco gestured elegantly with his stemware, sighing gustily as they took the short march down the hall and swept through another doorway. “It can’t. Be helped, that is. Not if you seriously want to advance, and apparently you have, what with that posh office.”
Anything.
The Muggles—the ones who even noticed, for they'd all business of their own to mind—chuckled along, almost without volition. It was Christmas, after all, and the first snowflakes blew brilliant through the open door. Like crystal cobwebs, cartwheeling madly—madly. And melting upon the crest of warm air that carried them, as the two men were melding together, seamless and shining.
Nothing more.
go away fast enough!
"Well—yes, Malfoy," Potter replied, quite droll, now. "That's the general idea."
Harry twisted his neck, peering between the speck that was his disappearing best mate and the looming sex-pot that was Malfoy, almost wrenching tendons in his hurry. He bravely met amused grey eyes and an intriguingly seductive half-smile. He nearly swooned at the sight of that combination.
Good sense chimed in—a paltry, feeble whisper—and lisped that Harry should let it go. That it wasn't worth it; that Draco wasn't worth it. There were easier blokes by the buckets; no one should ever have to suffer this sort of abuse. Harry didn't need to be made mockery of; he didn't require to be ignored by the man he'd handed his heart to, wholesale, no take backs.
"Ahem." And Draco nodded some more at her, at them, feebly, weakly, acknowledging his ex-lover's friends, giving him advice when they didn't need to; at his blown-away life, which had been so happy, even at the mess neglect had made of his living quarters. Bowing to the inevitable, was considering The Apology. He'd known it was coming, the grand gesture, him begging Harry to come back. He'd only gotten so far as the demands for same, though. Foolish, as Granger said.
“Of course.”
There had, Draco decided, setting his jaw, better be shagging in the offing later this evening or he really would murder Harry—for sticking him squarely in this awful position. He'd done very well thus far keeping below Father's radar. It was, Draco decided, a matter of necessary discretion. He chose peace, thanks.
“Ahah! I see how it is now."
Draco grinned at them, as far as he was able.
goblet, emitting horrid slurping noises.  Distinctly erotic noises, too, like those in a third-rate porn flick.
"No, I—" Harry sagged as Malfoy's lips touched his, ever so briefly, and pulled back. "But—what? You!"
It was rather…heartening, that. Lent Draco some additional courage, not that he needed any. He had plenty of bollocks, did Draco Malfoy. No one suffered Voldemort in his own home for that long a period without developing some sort of spiny backbone.
"No! Shut it!"
Oops! I should probably mention this is a sort of standalone sequel to another gift fic for this same do_me_veela* Fest, which you may read first, should you wish: Fear of Flying.
"Too true," Harry nodded, looking thoughtful. "I wonder if Tonks was like that, as a child? Your cousin."
white lilies, then, Mister Malfoy?" Floribunda Pinkstone jotted the order down in her book. "A matching lot of the emerald coloured rosebuds, and then all the centerpieces, boutonnières and ladies corsages in shades of green and silver, red and gold, correct? Slytherin and Gryffindor colours, alternating, you said? And, erm… you're having this event catered by...whom?" She raised a grey fluffy eyebrow at him and smiled vacuously. "Just so I may coordinate my delivery, of course."
His Mum really was terribly well suited to be the consort of one Lucius Malfoy: she was more than capable of keeping his bastard papa in check. Though perhaps by the time Draco's errant Father was released from Azkaban there'd be grandchildren in the mix. He rather hoped so; twenty years was a long time and he wanted a family to fill up the empty echoing halls of his inherited manse.

"Too right.
"Right," Harry bobbed his chin, "but getting back to

"Huh," he snorted. "Hmmm, I don't think so, Potter; I think they've more limbs than the Squid does when it comes to standing about on them and objecting to me. They've never even so much as scowled at me halfway kindly, alright? I hardly think being boinked by their Boy will change that."
Judging it truly appropriate if slightly unkind, Harry turned to his friend with a glare. He provided him a more than decent thumping across the back and shoulders to clear the daft git’s airways. He may’ve struck his twisting back and broad shoulders a few more times than necessary and perhaps a bit harder than required, but Ron did deserve it. The breakfast table was in ruins and all the assorted Gryffindors were engaged in glaring at the three of them, muttering darkly.
incredibly irritating. I don’t know why ever I put up with you.”
"Oh, god, Draco…" Harry moaned. For it was sinking in, the 'next year' bit. Molten through his very chest, nearly exploding it—that, and his brain, which duly imploded.
!" He squawked piteously, penetrated. "
Draco shrugged, sighing, staring about him pointedly. He thrust the flats of his sticky palms up.
Harry did, in fact, shut it. Cease with the mad gabble. Well, mostly. It was more a muffling than a snogging, what they ended up with. There were teeth, Harry struggled, and Draco tasted blood as well as snot and salt and saliva.
"What?" Puzzled and awed, Harry twisted his jaw, wrenching himself away from Draco's overbearing, incredibly mobile mouth. Wasn't this all exactly what he'd dreamt of? Well, maybe not the verbal abuse aspect of it, but the kisses—the tacit acceptance? What could possibly be bad about this? "What's—why're you? I really
"O...kay? It's alright to use it, then?" Draco swallowed, reluctantly accepting the little box. "You're very sure of that, Mother? One hundred percent certain it's safe?"
came, Harry Potter did; all at once with a great ejaculatory burst and bung up Draco Malfoy's willing channel like a hurricane. Draco arched his spine into receiving it as a kneazle would into a stringent petting session, practically purring even as he choked out the last of his own satisfaction.
Harry snorted, in part because Malfoy was a great long git and was crushing him and in larger part because Malfoy

He was positive it wasn't.
"Oh, Merlin—just what the fuck I need now…Hagrid being serious about his bloody job description." Harry groaned loudly and shut his eyes in despair, stuffing his head into the folds of the rug. Hermione's face, he noticed, had lit right up like a sodding Christmas tree, as she was—naturally-enormously excited about the upcoming exam. "That—that
"Bloody useless Owls we have," Draco growled and grumbled as he shrugged his shoulders, but he was proud, too. As if they were his own offsping, those owlets. For his and Harry's two silly feathered letter-carriers had found life-long mates in the company of one another, just as he and Harry had. It was all too, too soppy for words, that, but
“Umm’okay. But. What, Malfoy? What exactly did you have in mind? I don’t want a fuss, git.”

"Filch! Please! Always doubting me, Harry." One corner of his mobile mouth tilted upwards. "I have ears and eyes too, you know?
"I want this, Harry.
And…why now? In a few more months, he’d be free of the git; never have to lay eyes upon him again, really, if he didn’t choose. Excepting maybe to hear about him on the wireless, when Potter was recruited for pro Quidditch.
"C'mere, you. Come round the table."
“Yeah,” he said. At least he could agree with himself over the matter.
wasn't particularly. Not in his own skin, at least. His quest for assistance with the Manor suddenly struck him as frivolous, here in this place and seated like a supplicant before this familiar stranger.
Plotting revenge all the while, Draco was. Multitasking was something Malfoys did in their sodding
they'd been considering would have them both a good yard above the tabletop or more, likely thrashing about in plain view, and it would enable them each to penetrate the other, simultaneously. It was complicated; it was deviant—it was a bloody tremendously exciting prospect, even for the magically athletic.
potion? Or the other shit? It's all mixed up. I can't quite…I mean—"
"Yeah, what'd you have in mind, Malfoy?" Ron chimed in, sneering. "Another of your marvelous pranks?"
Draco hadn’t been actually fibbing when he’d informed his Manor he had no prospects, romantically. Draco wasn't much for the social circle even at the best of times and, besides, all his friends--and all Potter’s--were off living their own lives, two plus years on from uni. Three, really, for them. And Potter, damn his eyes, was presumably still simply off Elsewhere Undisclosed, doing Unspeakable things entirely Unspeakably. It made it rather difficult, keeping close.
The blighter would get his, when he deigned to show his Brown-lovin' nose—Draco would see to it, this time. No more of this nonsense!
Harry, however, had a pensive and earnestly thoughtful expression. He was nodding his head, very, very slowly, and he and Malfoy seemed to be holding a conversation of sorts, silently, purely via some sort of intense close-range staring contest. Finally, he raised a brow inquisitively at his longtime archenemy…and friend.
"Dating Game," Malfoy announced, and swung his mercurial gaze straight to a subdued Neville Longbottom, who was following the rapid exchange of comments like a spectator at Wimbledon. "And our Nev's nominated to be the first bachelor up for grabs."
"Your patronus looked to be shagged silly, too; did'ja notice?
she was off at a trot towards the castle and Harry was left gaping at her jaunty arse cheeks under her newly well-fitting school robes, turned pertly toward him as she made her way back to the Great Hall. She was practically skipping, Harry noted, vaguely affronted. How…weird of her.
"—Harry—"
"Shagging?" Draco prompted casually, shrugging. "Why, yes, in fact. It would be me. So sorry to burst your bubble, Granger. Did you think it was some other bloke?"
"Aft-after!" Malfoy was eating Harry's skin on his neck; chomping down by mouthfuls, leaving welts and bruises, purpling and stinging with warm wet. His voice was muffled but extraordinarily insistent. "Later! Harry!"
and the occasional porn mag Seamus snuck in. Or perhaps
feeling.
“Idiot,” Hermione muttered. “Ignore him; maybe he’ll stop.”
Gods, but that had been difficult! Too much like work, actually. He’d had to force himself to be rigidly courteous and super-polite all throughout; it was completely strange to be even be attempting it. That wasn’t how he and Potter communicated with one another, normally. It had always been raw, before, and generally bloody.
"Mmm…no, don't think so," Harry shrugged philosophically. "I'm alright, but—what a ride, yeah? Fucking
This person who was his 'other', his shadow, his rock.
Oh, yes. Malfoy had been an excessively gittish get, before. More so than Ron was now…although that was debatable. Ron on a steady diet of sex was mostly unbearable. He bounced. He cavorted. He annoyed the hell of his best mate.
Draco grabbed at him, pressed them closer, all the way down, from foreheads to chins and lips to shins and hips and shoetips. "
Neville whimpered. He covered his head with his hands protectively and hunched into the teddy bear's lap in a vain attempt to hide. "Please not Ginny, guys. Please, anyone but Ginny. She scares me."
Seizing the moment, Draco descended gracefully to his kneecaps, just inside the Great Hall's double doors. Everyone who was anyone, and even those who were not, had already been gathered; the first course served and gaily-tea toweled garbed Elves were unloading lashings of champagne on the multitude of guests. The mood was blithely ecstatic; people couldn't wait to see what Harry Potter would do next.
and that even the two strongest, most powerful of Wizards of their generation had little to no chance of halting it, of subverting its will. Some might, indeed, say that. And some might be bloody doubting wankers, too.
"She goes her own way, but she does tend to arrive," Millie stated and took a bite, albeit gingerly. Because it was Millicent Bulstrode, the pancake did not leak. Harry grinned, toasting her with his own before he crammed a goodly section into his mouth.
Potter had raised a speculative brow at him and sent a glance towards Mr. Kringleshoot, who was patiently awaiting them to bring their discussion to a finish. "'Proper', is it? Er, I suppose so. But don't think it'll always be like this, Draco. In the future—"
"To us swearing our inseparable love for each other—with this ring," Potter bellowed out at top speed, "I beseech thee—love, hold fast, handfast, Bond and commit to our earnest intent--"
In the Great Hall, no less, Potter was on his knees, abruptly—no warning. With a ring in hand and a posy of fragrant red roses in the other, resplendant and bedewed, and there was romantic music playing somehow, magically. And the eyes of all the entire school and its many, many inhabitants—available portraits, ghosts and Peeves included—were fixed upon them. Snape, too!
"Ah..." Draco hesitated, concerned. "Um."
"Granger. Potter," Malfoy nodded at them both with his usual savoir-faire. He'd crept up on cat-feet (well, rather nice half-boots) from parts unknown, though likely the Castle proper, whilst Harry had been basically blind and deaf to his surroundings, moping up a storm. "Granger, may I borrow your notes for Arithmancy? Zabini's got hold of mine but yours are likely more accurate, anyway. Would you lend me them?"
Meanings – journey (physical or spiritually), seeing the bigger picture, change, reunions, travel, represents the wagon wheel"
"Look, er—Draco?"
No, a Malfoy was a Malfoy, after all, and bright as a bloody banner waving ‘surrender!’ when it came to notoriety. Fuck, Malfoys even liked it—the Press. Clamoured after it, the gits. Even he admitted there was not a thing he could do to cover up a Malfoy and keep him hidden safely away, safely stashed for his own personal grabby-handed delectation. Not a bleeding thing.
It was a damned long time, subjectively, with not even an Owl or a floo call to break up the monotony. Very awkward, yes.
"And I you, git-for-brains," a quite gratified but somewhat disgusted Draco made sure to announce loudly, both for
serious about this, I refuse to believe it. No.
. It's the goddamned truth." He laughed shortly. Bitterly. "Though I sure wish it weren't. And you, wanker that you are, keep on proving it, over and over."
"Yes," Harry snapped back, implacable, obdurate. "I'm saying that. Everything I'm telling you is true, you know it is. You're all about you and you could care less about me, Draco Malfoy, not as a person. Don't stand there and tell me any different because I won't believe you. I've seen you in action, dot forget. All that nonsense you pulled the day I left? Bloody horrid; I don't know why I ever put up with you enough to live with you, sleep with you. And for Merlin's sake, believe me when I tell you I'll never again believe anything you say to me, not ever. You've kind of ruined that, okay? You and your friends, between you. I'm not your fucking fool, Malfoy. Now go away. Please just leave me alone."
that washed-out colour, do you? ‘Lake water’? Hmmm, mate. Dunno’, mate. If it strikes your fancy, well…well, you know, that’s bloody inspirational, your poetics. Leastways, I find it so. Malfoy’s not the only poet, then.”
Draco tapped his foot impatiently, staring about a very poor excuse for a bedroom, which was actually dominated by the bed. That piece of furniture was massive and, fortunately, not dirty in any way, but Draco still wasn't best pleased. Frankly, not much about the Shrieking Shack pleased him, other than the fact that it was indeed very private. Probably because no one in their right mind and with a smidgeon of sense would come here!
"I need to visit Scrivenshaft's, too," Draco went on, gamely, "and we've only an hour left, you realize," vainly attempting to disregard Harry's firm order to 'Just look, Malfoy' and doggedly sticking to his complaining.
, Harry. Still…”
Waiting for Harry to then assure him that none of that mattered—not a whit, not a dram—that they were still together and would always be.
“No problem.” Nev shrugged. He glared holes into Ron instead, who was stupidly grinning at him, wide enough to split his freckled face in half. “Just get a leash on him, alright?”
“Food fight!” Seamus howled instantly and tossed the entire lot of cheddar-scrambled eggs at Neville. It was, effectually, an utter melee, in an instant. “FOOD FIGHT!”
But Harry didn't want that. He could hear Draco's teeth grinding even from where he stood poised to run after; his arms flung out wide and beseeching, his miserable face stretched in a pleading rictus, his forlorn heart thumping frantically away in his chest like a drum. He didn't want that; didn't care to be that helpless and stupidlyfeeble, needing his friends to hunt his ne'er-do-well, tempestuous lover down for him.
"Oh—er?"
Very amazing, really. Astounding. Considering all that passed between them before the death of the Dark Lord.
Rather, it tumbled out of his numb fingertips, tipsily slopping tea whilst his stunned brain was grappling with the weird selection of words Harry was spewing out of his mouth. All of it in terribly slow motion. Like the progress of chilled Golden syrup, inching down over the edges of the jar. Or the ancient motions of the stars colliding in Cygnus.
"No!"
Like Hogsmeade, it was a Wizarding enclave, and the high street was bustling with students and professors, naturally, but also rather a lot of other people, and there were quite a few merchants. Harry cast a Translation Charm on himself and proceeded to purchase a few small items he was in need of immediately. He couldn’t procure gifts for his friends, of course--as an Unspeakable on active duty, it was naturally forbidden to betray his physical location at any given time--but he could acquire some replacement supplies to his Potions stores.
important was Courting Potter Properly, all in ten days or less, max. This to enact the vilest form of revenge Draco could possibly conceive of which wouldn't physically harm a hair on that spry Seeker's body of Harry's nor a single atom of that tenderly innocent Gryffindor heart of his. But still—it would be a proper Malfoy revenge and Harry would know it as exactly that, Draco swore to himself.
"Not true!" Hermione pointed to the two romping about in the garden, smiling broadly. "As you see, chaps. Am I not right?"
Ron snarled into a fist, the non-dominant one. Hermione scowled. At both of them, in turn, her brows beetling in disapproval.
?" Draco asked, instantly diverted. "That's absolutely brilliant, Harry!"
“Merlin, I hate you, sometimes,” Harry gritted tersely, glaring with all the firepower he could muster.
“You’re a bloody idiot. Just consider," he remarked. "That only means you’ll have wrinkles and grey hair well before I do, slug brain! In fact, you might end up bald as a coot! It's already looking a bin thin up top, right at the temples. Have you noticed?”
“Hmph!” Harry scowled and shifted. “Maybe. I certainly can't manage the way it is now. I suppose it’s not a bad idea. Bit passive, but I certainly can’t think of a better one just off the top of my head and believe me, I’ve been thinking so much I’ve got a permanent headache installed. Well...That could be my diet, too. It's been mostly horrid. Thank Merlin for Millicent; she keeps me alive.”
"But?" Draco could tell his partner was still bothered by Pince's desertion of duty. In the olden days Hogwart's Librarian would no more have left a student lingering after close than she'd dance naked on the High Table at supper but…things had changed. She was older, more easily distracted—and damned close to forcible retirement, any road.
Betrothal ceremony he'd scrabbled together not even two weeks past, the arse, and that was more than good enough. They needed no others.

Harry didn't mind exams so much, nowadays, as he had a great deal more time available to revise. It was who he'd be paired with, come tomorrow: Malfoy, his heart's own nemesis.
"Good man. Home, now. Feed me."
. Draco wasn't exactly Romilda Vane, was he? Not by a long shot. So, okay, no—no head games.
alright, yes?”
“I need a passport, Malfoy? Thought that was Muggle.”
Blaise poked him, hard, right where it hurt. Solar plexus. Bastard.
A whole great lot of words spewed at him, too, about Draco feeling rather anxious—concerned that Harry might possibly have believed he'd been set up, when really he hadn't been. Which was silly of Draco, because if nothing else he knew Draco very well—seven years, yeah?—and the git might prank but he absolutely wouldn't screw with his best enemy's head, not like
It resembled nothing so much as a simple, common, garden-variety daisy, drawn by his little godson. Excepting it was 2,500 years old, and radiating powerful magic in every direction.
super. More than that…and you—you're certain you're alright?"
Reality was enough of a bother; Malfoy the largest botheration of them all. Unwittingly, the bloke stuck his sensually intriguing, good-smelling self dead-centre into Harry's head like a giant road sign, waking or sleeping, and pointing straight down the path to Madness, Population: one Harry Potter.
what he was asking. "With
Harry kissed him. Square on his open mouth, shoving in tongue and stopping Draco's second gasp of outrage before it even started. Draco struggled willfully against the invasion, fury pouring through his veins—a white-hot anger of such great degree Draco quite thought he'd combust.
It is dark and frozen damp, the air still and heavy, sticking muddily in Harry’s lungs as he breathes. Luna is budged up close by his shoulder on one side, Garambeau on the other. They form one of several triads compressed into a columnar shape, each of them pointing the tips of their wands to their partnered Wizardkin standing before them at a little distance. There's perhaps three score Wizarding folk in attendance, stationed to describe the form of one of the most powerful spells they ever employ as Rune Mages, the Great Cup, or Chalice.
. Fuck, I'm dying on the vine with you not there—it's horrible. Have some fucking pity, Harry!"
“It’s not, Hermione,” Harry cut her off, scowling unhappily. “I talked it over with him already. It’s nothing to do with that case; I'd checked all the current open Auror files anyway and Imperius'd Ghouls are not Grimmauld's issue. Bill’s already confirmed it’s not any sort of Curse nor any Dark Magic. At least not for my house.” He glanced at his mate. "Draco?"
Oh, but he was
“But—but…did you at least catch that last move of Potter’s?” Draco demanded, quite unable to keep his bubbling excitement contained. “That, my friends,
He was
"Potter! Take it, you sod!" Draco ordered, scowling ferociously. This really was not how he'd ever imagined becoming engaged, but then, this was Potter, wasn't it? Enough said. Of course it was bollixed up; he'd just have to get through it. "And stop with that infernal chortling, twit! Of course I'm not pranking you, idiot," he added, snarling, "I would hardly consider this a joking matter. Merlin! I'm proposing here! To you! Take me seriously, for fuck's sake!"
Draco scowled. "No, really, Dad—you cannot just demand that I—"
don't care to speak with you, not anymore. Not ever, actually. We're over."
“Bloody Athena, she is, always being bloody rational,” Draco muttered very softly, for Harry’s ears alone. “Not that I'm disagreeing with her.”
“Grrrr!” His muffin paid the price for the indignity, instead. He crammed it into his mouth and relentlessly returned to watching Malfoy read the dailies.
What exactly
"Hmmm." Draco settled his arms 'round Harry's torso and shoulders; reeled him in. It was comforting; it was all he needed, to have Harry home again. The stomach acid that had been crawling up his esophagus for the last few hours burbled and thought seriously about subsiding, even. "Hmmm."
Harry, responding like an opium addict, cracked his jaw open as wide as he could pry it and angled his head for better access, arching his throat in silent submission. Malfoy wasted no time following his tongue with the rest of his excellently fit self; he'd pinioned Harry's wrists and was clambering to cover him in an instant, pressing Harry flat into the rug.
He halted himself all at once, planting his palms flat upon the desk and leaning far enough forward over it to nearly smudge Harry’s specs all in one gracefully threatening motion, matching Harry glare for glare.
"Ah." The pesky spectacles were dangling off one ear; all Draco could see was blaze of grass-green, a set of puzzled eyebrows. "That's—that's? All right? You're sure of this? Draco?'
He’d said ‘Fuck!’, as he recalled. And when Draco and he bumped into one another, as if by accident, after the match, he’d expounded further, thusly: ‘Fuck
Harry heard wafting through his befuddled memories, the sighing breath of it desolate.
“Well…”
pleasant experience, have you. Leasees too, for yours. No sense in letting them sit empty. You’ll likely want to find someone with children--or someone who desperately desires them. Be kinder to your homes that way; let them down softly?”
that I love you, Draco…er." Not that he didn't stumble over that bit, gasping a tad and blinking rapidly. "Cause I do." Harry-deliciously—went beet red. Draco curled his upper lips and tilted his head, awaiting the rest of it with glee. "Er...a great deal. And have, too," he added, pugnaciously. "Since before."
“This is Ancient Magic. It’s as old as your eldest of Runes, Potter, and that’s why none of the more modern spells and charms work on it. You simply have to cast your Unspeakable version of Finite or whatever it you people use to contain those wily old buggers, the Old Ones?”
"No! Hermione said to make you listen, Harry, if I must. I'm not about to Pretrificus you, so…please. Please?"
"Yessss," Malfoy hissed, and it was poison in Harry's veins—the finest kind to be brewed in any cauldron. It swamped any lingering doubts; it ripped his reserve away completely and left him open to anything Malfoy might want of him. On the gelling thought he hastily spread his legs beneath the weight of Malfoy's long ones, wriggling about madly so he was able to bring his knees up and clamp them tightly about Malfoy's narrow waist, excess cloth bunching every which way.
"Yes, Nev," Harry glanced over at him, shaking his head ruefully. "Afraid you are, really."
,” Draco said fiercely, shrugging off the scold with all the ease of a legacy Slytherin. “It’s terribly similar to what’s going on Grimmauld. In fact, the Manor’s gone and lost its freaky incorporeal mind with this bloody 'Draco-have-a-baby' business."
"I'm not a wanker!" Draco was offended. "And I'm not damned smelly, either!"
Which, for a boy of nearly seventeen, was an exceedingly long time to wait.
Pansy crocheted, or possibly knitted, whatever; it was something with wicked sticks involving creating very long rectangular swathes of interestingly-hued woolies. She claimed it was for ‘stress’ and had repeatedly tried to encourage Draco to partake. Now, he eyed the loopy skein askance and did his best to avoid her disappointed side-eyed stare, regarding the bundle of wool resting upon his lap with great intensity.
!” he chanted, in time with the rest of the plebes, and felt not the slightest regret for indulging in the incredible rush of pleasure inspired by Potter’s stupendous feat. It was—it was glorious, what Potter could do on a broom!
“You’ve noticed, I’m sure,” Pansy murmured softly, shifting closer to Theo, and speaking just below Draco’s optimal audial range, “he’s making no sense at all recently? That wasn’t even a decent comeback, Nott.”
has some quite useful definitions of the Elder Futhark Runes, including the two referenced here. To wit:
Would be a good idea to swot up on all his rival’s latest tricks in readiness for the next match, right? Draco assured himself. Perfectly reasonable, then, keeping a close eye on Potter. And nothing unusual or unnatural  about it, either. He’d done exactly that, before the Dark Lord bit the big one at Potter’s wand end; was accustomed to it. Learnt some, too. In fact, that was precisely why he’d chosen to sit in the bleak stands on a cold autumn afternoon, watching the inexpressibly lame match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Yes, he was indeed covertly observing his one true rival in life, sussing out his wicked-smart Quidditch strategies, right? That was his story and he was sticking by it, come what may. And his seat, which was the best one available for Potter-spotting. Even if it was a bit chillier than expected, this far up in the stands.
Which was exactly why Draco was interviewing him for the prospect of producing a Betrothal Cake large enough to comfortably feed a cool one thousand guests, staff, students and stray VIPs, such as Kingsley Shacklebolt and Victor Krum.
Ron—being a git and now a git with some real sexual experience under his schoolrobes—only wrapped both his arms about his own shoulders and mimicked a heated making out session with his
…And finally a last pathetic little 'creak!', as the work table's overstrained legs splintered fractionally about the joints, trickling sawdust.
“Huh. Oh, really? Is that so?” Draco turned on the sarcasm full-spigot, handing back a hard stare. “Well, I’d wager you’ve not. Because you hadn't, before. But I can fix that, you know, if you'll just--”
“’Kay, darling,” Pansy smiled, all reptilian. “Will do. No more ogling.”
"I love you and you're mine, Harry—all mine, please—please?" Draco stopped in the midst of shoving Harry's bared knees over his shoulders and grabbed at his chin. "Harry—please? It is true, right? You're not lying, are you? Having me on or anything? You wouldn't—would you?"
Ron. Don't even start. And you!" Her eyes swiveled to Draco. "And you didn't go after him? At once? You just let him pop off like that and did nothing about it? What
So what if he had to spare a bit of it to others? Needy people, like him, but so much less fortunate than he. Those drawn to the blazing inferno that was Harry Potter—all torch-bright and heady-warm and brilliant, an oasis of glorious life in a cold desert. Couldn't blame them, really—even that sorry bint Brown, who dared think to lay her little red-lacquered claws deep into
It was true fact. Day 254 was a day that would live in infamy, forever after in their lives, his and Harry's. It required only the barest mention of it by either of them to halt any spat, end any tiff, cancel out any resentment or ill-will. And Zabini never seemed to get that, though Draco was fairly certain Harry's mates did. It didn't say much for poor old Blaise, but then poor old Blaise never did manage to fall in love, not with anyone. The only counting he did was of his massive amounts of Galleons, inherited from his mum, the murderous bint.
“I...
“Yeah, sure, Draco baby,” Pansy nodded, blinking up at him. “Absolutely, yes. Potter’s the man, darling—right. Rah. Woot. But—er. I agree with Nott, here; time to go. Before we’re trampled underfoot, please.”
Harry glowered, briefly, mutinously. Earned a quick smooch on his nose tip for punishment; a narrow-eyed glance.
"Good," Potter still seemed a bit narrow-eyed and untrusting, but Draco ignored it. "It's settled then," Potter went on. "When should we meet?"
care; I care so fucking much! Come on, Harry--Harry, please!"
"Harry! Potter—you fool!"
As if hearing Draco’s voice and objecting highly to his terse command to be caught, the Snitch dodged sideways and then fell back and well below, to hover tauntingly right under Potter’s heels. Two seconds delay had Potter executing a brilliant topsy-turvy turnabout and then he was after it again, unerring.
“Oh, ho, ho…now I see how it is.” Draco smirked, lounging back and spreading his long legs out before him. He snapped his fingers, chuckling. “Oh, snap, Potty! Same as at uni, eh? I come carping to you over some tiny little issue I'm having and you go right-to and turn it about, Potter, and bloody out-do me in the drama department? I know that look, mate. What is it, then? With Grimmauld. Did you happen to come across yet another mysterious sub-basement? Or has poor Kreacher gone completely round the bend at long last, requiring the Old Elf Home? Or,” he frowned quickly, genuinely concerned, “I do hope not something more serious--? I mean, he's a right old git but I do pray he's not unwell, Harry. Is he?”
"Harry, Harry—" Malfoy panted. Never ceased moving his lips across Harry's flinching skin, never lifted them or lost contact, but his dick stilled, finally, and Harry dazedly mused that he might very have its fiery head poking at his hapless lungs next. "Harry, this doesn't end here, you know?"
"I love you, too!" Harry vowed sternly, not caring a hoot about his clothing, as his cape was safely out of the way. He blinked up at his Veela; Draco looked quite fierce—and rather pointy—Veela-ish, and very handsome indeed, bearing down upon him. It was…thrilling—in a very good way.
"You ready, Draco?"
you?”
“Hmmm…really? You think? Well, how ‘bout this coming week, maybe? Tuesday, then; we’ve DADA on Tuesdays with the Gryffs. DADA it is. They’re always paired up, those two.” That was Nott, scheming.
"Of course not!" Draco agreed, scandalized. "Those people get very shirty. I should know. I correspond with the American MagiAstronomy Association regularly."
"Hardly, Father. Potter's intentions are honourable, I'm sure, even if a little misplaced. There will be a Bonding, one day. When it's suitable."
“Fallen?”
"Talk, Draco. You're wasting my time, here. I'm bushed even if you're not."
Hermione would scold him over breakfast and the whole damned day would be shot to flinders. Disappointing from the start, really.  Bloody hell.
"Concentrate, Harry!" he ordered, through clenched teeth. "Keep it up!"
“Rudesbys.”
“M’mph. I’m a Wizard, Hermione,” Ron informed his girlfriend replied sagely, trading chomp for sip of pumpkin juice. “Spell ‘em clean again, what?”
"Urk! Mother!"

“Nothing Dark?” Harry echoed, allowing himself to be dragged along. “You’re certain?”
The things that had been told him, they were all insanity. But apparently shockingly true, even so.

, al-alright? Shut it, Weasel-please?"
If it wasn't—Harry didn't.
“Yes,” Harry replied flatly, his lips tightening. “I’ve noticed, and no, not just this morning, either. And what of it? Ron’s being a great tit and you were, too, Hermione, just now, and I don’t see why you both have to act as though it were some burning

' you say? And you’re what now? You’re not working? You told Millicent that?”
Looking about him with a derisive eye, Draco let go of Harry's hand—or tried to. "So, why here, Potter, of all places? Surely, there are shops in London you could patronize—"

Till the sounds of groaning and moaning, the small incoherent noises of shock and pleasure and amazement—

“Umm…” Harry squinted off into the the corner of their office, mentally calculating out what the Healer had told him. “Um, fifteen minutes or so, maybe? A little more? A little less?” Looking back at Draco, he quirked his lips hopefully, willing the other man to relax. “Not long, though.”
The grin that broke through Potter's undeniable anxiety was most definitely more welcome than any May morning.
Heterosexual lap sex—especially between Harry's two best mates—had to be
“Prick,” Harry muttered, eyes zeroing in on the hair in question. Damn! He’d not caught precisely how the flickering shadows threw Malfoy’s tumbling oh-so-elegantly-casual fringe into bas relief against the alabaster of his high forehead! That effect was somehow…very important—to Harry, at least.
Nor ever again, he hopes.
me, Harry. And I love you. Don't lie like that! Don't do it or I won't be responsib—oh, sod this shit, Harry! That's enough!"
“Yes, dear,” Draco laughed. “Unspeakables are known for their utter meanness and ruthless behaviour. Especially the Runes sort. It’s all due to their constant study of stone scratchings and mineral lumps--really toughens a person up, being ‘round all those rocks. Quite inflexible, your sort.”
“Of course, if you say so," Draco inclined his pale head regally, lips twitching, breathing a tiny internal sigh of relief that apparently his dear friend hadn't come completely unhinged. "Potter.”
Of course he'd literally had not a single solitary clue he’d ever be someone like that, really. He’d always fancied himself as an Auror, as soon as he’d turned eleven, gone full-on Magical and learnt what an Auror was. It wasn’t till near the end of his second year at uni, once Ron and Hermione had completed their courses of study and it was evident Malfoy was staying on to pursue a higher level in Astronomy that Harry had stumbled into what quickly became his obsession: Ancient Runes.
"Huh." Draco clamped down on the scowl he felt rising; schooled his features into blandness. "Of course, Harry. Pity—got it to spare, I do. For
“Grimmauld just spun into a downward spiral, I suppose,” Harry added. “Because of all the family strife and so on with the Wars. Then with me being gone for so very long--between uni and then my job--and Teddy not visiting at all during the last two years. Working theory is Grimmauld's been resigned to it, and mostly quiescent."
“Fine, ‘just-Harry’, then you’ve gone bleeding mental,” Draco stated harshly. “You simply--I mean--are you? Are you really, truly, honestly telling me you want children?”
“Even for a past Saviour there’s got to be some limits, you know?" Draco laughed quickly, nervously. "Ah, Circe's skivvies, is that a genuine Picasso over there?”
For Draco, perched nervously upon the opposing divan, clad in just his mostly unbuttoned shirt, it was a gruelling moment. It had taken rather a lot of persuasion on his boyfriend's part to install him thus, half-naked and waiting to take Potter's rather awesomely super-fantastic cock up his bum.
Blasted Potter! Draco would damned well
"Quit it, Ron," Harry ordered, barging between them. "I told you all about it last night—and we're
“M-Me?” Harry squeaked, allowing himself to be forcibly marched towards the staircase. “What, why me, Malfoy? It’s your bloody Manor. Don't you have control over it, as its Master?”
"I don't understand you. And I can't. I can't go. Not without you, Harry. Literally, I can't."
That meant
"I'm not mean!" Harry shot back, falling into a no-nonsense stance, almost a mirror of Draco's posture, but sharper. Harder. "Far from it, Draco. I'm sensible, is what. It wasn't working out, can't you see that? None of it—nothing. Bloody anyone could see that. Your mates certainly did, didn't they? It was time—past time, to put it to rest."
His jaw dropped in consternation. Draco rocked back on his heels, the jewelry box slipping unnoted from suddenly numb fingertips.
"But thass alrigh'," Harry added slowly, his eyelids very much stuck together. "I don' mind it."
, Harry—please?"
"No," Harry stated decidedly, shaking his head in the negative, "and no. You
“Ah! You git!  Faster! Deeper—nngh!”
“Of course there are, Draco,” Pansy said, face going stern as she returned to her stick-work and worked on a tricky bit of furling yarn this way and that. “There’s always consequences. I should know, yes? But it’s your heart you must follow. Do what you really truly want to do, Draco. Life is too bloody short not to.”

“Mmmph!”
“Ichika-san?” Luna called over to their local guide, a young Mage recently graduated from Mahoutokoro and now attending the Master’s programme at Castelobruxo. “Has UNESCO been recently? I see some minor damage but it’s likely not a concern of ours, particularly. Environmental.” She looked to Harry inquisitively. “Thoughts, Harry?”
“Rather naturally,” Harry allowed with a heavy sigh, “it follows that Wizarding homes, especially the really ancient ones, would become imbued with a quite strident sense of purpose, developing over time the goal of encouraging Wizarding folk to have as many children as they possibly could manage. Uh-huh, I see exactly what you’re saying here, Hermione. The two of us, we seem like perfect targets.”
at me, Harry. Can't you see what this has done to me, you walking out that door? How you could? And enough's enough, now. I didn't mean it; you know I didn't mean it. It was likely just me, being the way I usually am—you understand, right? And Zabini's always that way, always fucking about and you know how he is, right? He can't help it; his mum's a bloody murderess, Harry. That's what she does, murder relationships. And he's got no bloody people skills, no point of reference, thanks to his stupid old cunt of a mum. I mean, he's charming and all that but there's a wall, Harry, between him and everyone and it's only a very few of us he'll even bother wi--I mean. Blaize is, well. He just tried it on you, hoping for a rise—it was a
“Because you truly
“Nothing on,” Theo spread his palms wide, the very picture of innocence. “Nope. Nothing”
"Ooooh!" Brown squealed. "Kinky!"
Harry, likely encouraged by his audience, had got his act together meanwhile. Draco moaned over the improvements and his wails certainly weren't due to ill usage.
miserable. You look terrible, Malfoy. Like somebody died."
There was no fucking, bloody,
territory—his alone. The extremely soft underside of Draco’s jaw was also his—he wasn’t sharing.
"Harry!"
"Right, right. That one." Adrian—as he insisted upon being addressed—waved his mate off with a little smile. "Ferosh, yes. In any event, I'd have that sort of dragon, the Horny sort, all done up in magical marzipan, naturally, and then I'd have one based on your given name, Mister Malfoy—all silvery-greenish, I think, maybe with piping racing stripes on it—battling it out playfully over turrets of whipped lightly-browned meringue—"
More in his throat, like, the movement of the word ‘stay’. Or maybe it was a combination of specific lip movements, like verbal Braille. He only knew he kissed the bunch-pursed-lips-tongue-tip-to-teeth- and-open-mouth action of  that one betraying word smack dab onto the inviting plane of Draco’s shoulder, like an invisible brand—or a tattoo only he could see. The shoulder was just there; strong, cream and taut; It was there and he was compelled to kiss it, so…might as well, right? After, there was a faint smear of his lips left behind, where he’d wetted them first, licking them lasciviously over Draco.
It was the way Malfoy smelled that was
“Very, thanks,” Harry’s lips twitched faintly, "and yes, please."
"Now, Draco, love—calm down. It's only what we've just done. They're in love, yeah?"
“Fine, fine! Cheers, Hermione,” Harry allowed, lips twitching. "I wasn't, you know. Doing that. Not five, and not a spoilt brat, either. Not like some I know." He toasted her, sending Draco a teasing glance. "But still. To you too, Malfoy, for showing willing to give up the Manor. At least for a little while.”
But that fling with Oliver was long over, naturally. One didn't keep a lover when one was Journeying. Not usually, at least. It was all too exhausting enough, already.
“Oh fuck,” Harry groaned, barely under his breath. “Merlin fuck.” He twisted his fingers together all the more, and harder, setting his teeth in a physical barrier against the stupid words. He could throw off Imperius, couldn’t he? So one half-arsed Veritus from a kid who probably didn’t even know his shaving charms yet shouldn’t be a problem--should it?
. Tell me. I'll fix it, I swear!"
the introductory description, you'll see. Do you?" Harry's partner (in many things, really, not just Potions) stuck a poky finger out, pointing, nearly swiping Harry's specs off in the process. "Is it what we're searching for, though? Inducunt libidinem?"
, no matter how you've prettified it. " He darted quick eyes about, taking in to all the improvements in a glance. Harry must've had some help; he didn't know which on e the groupies would've jumped at the chance, but he damned well knew there'd have been someone—and the jealousy he felt over that was needlessly distracting. "It was your prison, wasn't it?" Draco went on, doggedly. "This house, and everything in it, back in the day? Terrible as that bloody fucking closet you grew up in, Harry—you said that, to
Harry nosed his face with its askew-spectacles carelessly about the flurry of falling white-gold hair obscuring his vision, tickling his forehead, and tilted his head toward Draco's, as any fond lover would do. Gods, but it hurt, how he did that. And
“I took your advice, you know,” his inexplicable flatmate carried on, apparently oblivious to such things as 'atmosphere', bustling about like a small dark dervish.
“Wanker,” Draco grumbled after several endlessly long minutes, glaring at the device as if it mortally offended him. "Just ignore me, why don't you?" He sniffed, loudly, and elbowed his mate's ribs in a mately fashion. “Be like that, then.”
He sent a curl of enquiry towards the soul linked to his.
"Not a chance, sorry."
Maybe it was the fact that the corridors and staircases of his perfectly renovated, completely cleansed, void of all Dark Magic, fully equipped with the latest Wizarding-adapted Muggle mod cons, bloody silly-arse ancient old fucking family mansion had taken to steering Draco's steps willy-nilly to the Nursery at least thrice daily.
It was up to six times daily now, not three, and Draco dreaded the number seven. So entirely too symbolic, that number. He could no longer reach the Apiary or the Stables without tripping, sometimes literally, over some new folderol for a child. The stairwell up to his observatory atop the North Wing apse was clogged with the scattered accoutrements of infants and quite hazardous in the dark.
"And tattooed."
"Oh, Harry!"
Still chewing methodically, Ron switched his searching gaze to his girlfriend’s mildly puzzled face.
His wings thrummed, setting up an eerie echo off the walls.
Small gestures: a quick snog in the lav, interrupted by Zach Smith barging in, whistling. The touch of fingertips tapping a jaunty tattoo on his knee under a conference table.
certainly don't."
. Still. Not agreeing with you," Harry muttered, scowling darkly down at his boot tips, but he did keep up the pace. “You sell yourself short, sometimes.”
"I don't, thanks."
“Er-ah. Um, Harry.”
"Git!" Draco snapped. He glared at his nemesis in all things furiously. "Jealous of what, exactly? Your playboy arse? That Golden Cock you like to wave about? Hardly."
“Bosh,” Harry shot back, looking terribly stern. “I adore Crup puppies and Kneazle kittens and even those animated toothpicks you like to call foals, Malfoy. Baby bloody bees! I am a known pushover for small cute animals of any sort, and Rosie will vouch for that, but that doesn't mean I can’t be a real mean bastard sometimes.”
the match, but he could still plan for all the future ones. Better to be prepared than not, right?
, Harry! That's not necessary—I mean, it's hot and all, but no! No, really-no!"
Harry halted, growling. “Fuck you, Malfoy--I wasn't going to touch you! What are you even doing--accusing me of? You’re off your nut! We’re talking here--it’s important! You can’t just leave!”
—with a little something (from the Malfoy collection, preferably, as the jewels his family claimed were all rare and very valuable and there'd hardly been a chance, had there? to stop in where his Mother usually commissioned her pieces and order something bespoke); simply as a reminder of their, er…their new-found friendship. Things happened, after all, and Potter might be interested—nay, even comforted—by having a small wearable of harking back to the time they'd spent recently,
!" Draco blushed darker still, helplessly cursing himself for it even as he rivalled a bloody red carnation, and twisted mightily in Harry's grip, forcibly spinning them 'round so he wouldn't be called upon to witness any more horrendously scarring Gryffindor sex. "Oh,
“But what?” Harry demanded grumpily after a moment. “Malfoy?”
Ron waggled his eyebrows ferociously; brilliant ginger caterpillars practically spelling out the fateful warning ‘Teasing Harry Time!’ Opened his now thankfully food-free gob wide as fuck, took a deep breath and began to softly warble, “Haaaarreeee and Malfoooooy, sitting a treeeee—Kay!“
But the closely printed pages of the Muggle Grisham's invention held no interest.
He bloody well wished to be cast a'sea. He couldn't fucking even imagine being returned to that dreary state of 'not wanting'. So dreary, so lacklustre, so benign bland and boring. Bah!
“Because,” Harry began, desperately wanting to explain exactly and in great detail all of these answers to all of Draco’s questions and knowing with all his heart it would be also precisely the wrong thing to do. He gulped, gritting his teeth. “Fuck. Just...because.”
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry replied absentmindedly. The ever-changing angle of the sun across the sky outside—as well as inside the Great Hall, painted right above them on the magical ceiling—was creating some rather interesting effects in Malfoy’s equally magical hair. “I think.”
"Oooh!" Brown squealed, scrambling up. "Like one of those Muggle game shows Professor Peesebottom was lecturing us about, Draco? Is that what you mean?"
"Owwie! Fucking
Perhaps he should borrow Dennis Creevey’s inherited camera. He needed to nail down these so-changeable details—as an Auror in training should do, right? Should be able to accurately describe any potential perps, down to the last buttonhook and tie tack! Like that Muggle Sherlock did, actually.
And, when the moment is right and proper the local Mage will call upon them, Apparating themselves to the centre of the loose, snaking circle of dancers, becoming the focal point of a profoundly old, incredibly powerful spell that always somehow reminds Harry of the Morris. At least a little, in physical motion. They will cast, that local Mage, and the chameleon shapes of Luna, of Meneer De Oude, of Master Stencil from HQ, of Chaz, of Luce and forty-odd others all shuffling and stomping, bowing and twisting and spinning about will collectively focus upon pouring every resource into the Hands-That-Are-Gentle Charm.
Harry startled and there was something bout him that seemed to presage him leaving. Just going off, if Draco did not. Draco snarled at it, fair warning, and was across the distance that separated them in a twinkling, finally breathing freely as he moved, puffing and huffing and snorting. Breathing
“Bloody hells, Harry!”
special.
“Huh.” Draco snorted softly, rocking back on his heels and sheathing his wand carelessly. He smiled at Harry but it wasn't a particular pleasant smile. “Just a ‘tiny’ Veritus Charm, Potter? You don’t say.”
This was ridiculous!
"Oh. Really?"
Draco barely noted it. He kept his eyes solely on Hermione, leveling his stare. "I am never a dog, please."
"Not buttering, 'zactly," Harry smiled, his fingers exploring in very wicked ways. "More…petting. I like touching you, prat."
Granger also squeaked; rather, she emitted the same sort of noise a terrified mouse might make.
Draco hung on for dear life to the slick sweaty skin under Harry's armpits; they and taut thighs were his anchors.
“Fine. Fuck you, too,” he sniped. “I’ll find you out later, whatever it is you’ve got on—don’t think I won’t!”
His Mum emitted a muffled sound arising from a particularly frightening species of gleeful femininity. Draco winced. He much preferred his Mum's sly matter-of-factness or her nearly preternaturally composed façade to this—this abominable effusiveness over his love life! Besides, what exactly could he say to that pronouncement? Because it did, rather—love.
"Mmm? What else, Draco?"
He'd go to the Headmaster himself, Draco vowed, pulling Potter closer, wrapping his arms around the quicksilver energy as if to contain it; lay his case before the old Wizard and promise to serve Potter's detention himself, even go so far as sign an agreement allowing them to be flanked about by all of Gryffindor House if need be
come 'round—if only there's proof. Positive proof. So, er...come on, please? Cooperate this one time?"
, you two,” Draco ordered, packing away his omniculars in their specially hand-tooled dragonhide case. Potter was well off the Pitch now; there was no point in staying any longer. “Cheeky!”
“Go, you prat!” Draco yelled, oblivious to their carping. “Put a move on it! Don’t lose it now, Potter!”
"Ron!" Granger spoke up again, her tone a whip-crack, and with its sound Weasley reluctantly subsided, grumbling under his breath. "It's alright. Look, Harry's just promised we'll talk it over later, if we feel we must. Let it go for now—he's right. Now's the time for Hogsmeade. We don't often have the chance for a little fun. I could use a spot, honestly."
"Har-
. Get out. This is my home now and I live here alone and I bloody don't want you in it any longer. Please…just…go."
“You look it,” Draco observed gently, quickly and quietly making his way round the desk to Harry’s side. “I’m sorry I shouted, Potter,” he added, laying a warm hand on Harry’s shoulder and giving it a careful squeeze. “But I really am concerned, you know. Auror business aside, Veritus Charm--even a ‘tiny’ one, cast by a minor--leaves a person vulnerable. And I value your hide, whether you realize it or not.”
“Huh. You don’t say?” Draco scoffed, grinning. “Pot, kettle, Potter. Don’t forget I’ve seen you with Teddy, all this time. Not to mention the Weasley horde. And even Pansy’s terrors--you adore them, all of them.”
"Draa-cooh," Harry coaxed. "For me?"
. Apology accepted. Now, may I please offer you a handkerchief?
Slowly, so slowly. Marriage. Children. He and Harry.
see you there," Hermione, flushing faintly under the steady gaze of their fellow NEWTS-track student and ignoring her mate's latest little accident. Harry had so many these days, it was rather a running joke between the three of them. "Ah, right…certainly I can. Yes, not a problem. Hang on a moment while I find them?"
"'Of-of course'? 'F-Fitting', you say?" Draco stuttered, his kneecaps coming together with a snap as he jolted bolt upright in his console chair. "But—Mum! I only just—we—you!" he yelped, reduced to nonsensical monosyllabic spurts. To have his mother approve his choice so easily? Unthinkable! To have his mother instantly state that Potter was 'suitable'? Completely unreal! Draco flailed internally. "Mother! It's Potter we speak of—Pot-ter!"
"You'd better," Hermione growled. "
It may have been a sodding silly thing to do, asking Potter to walk out with him under the noses of his disapproving Housemates and those of Potter's—the entire school's, really—but he'd gone and done it and now there was nothing left but to stand by what he'd done. Draco had not been raised to go back on his word. Ever.
, at least. My bloody arse, as if that's special!" Harry laughed again, bitterly, shortly, cut off abruptly as he turned accusing eyes upon his rapt audience and really got down to it, no holds barred. "You know what? Actually, you're the whore in this picture, Draco, not your bloody pal Zabini. An attention-seeking whore. You like people's notice, you seek it out, go looking. Think it's great. Think it's super. " He huffed, snapping his teeth in patent disgust. "
