He did his best to change the topic. “I think Andromeda is bringing Teddy this weekend,” he said. “For the whole weekend.”
Draco was sitting on his bed, smiling softly as Harry exited the bathroom, half dressed and hair dripping. With the water weighing it down, his hair was almost to his shoulders in length. When it was dry it was a little shorter than Draco’s own, and much more curly and unruly. He shook his hair out and laughed at the expression on Draco’s face when the water droplets hit him before coming over to sit beside him on the bed. They leaned against each other, Draco not seeming to care that Harry’s hair was getting the shoulder of his shirt wet.
“I sleep better with the baby around,” Harry responded without really thinking. He was still trying to make sense of what was going on. He had become an early riser in the Days After, mostly thanks to Teddy’s sleep schedule and Andromeda’s insistence to be up at the crack of dawn with the kettle boiling, but this seemed excessive.
How had it happened that he had been taken under the wing of a group of Slytherins that everyone hated? Why was it that everyone hated them so much? Hating Draco, he understood, maybe. Harry hadn’t been at Hogwarts the previous year – hadn’t seen what had happened, although he had heard stories about Hogwarts under the Carrows rule. Students had been forced to hurt and punish other students – until eventually some had taken up residence in the Room of Requirement.
Lost in thought as he was, he hadn’t realized that Draco had stopped walking until he was a step ahead. Harry turned around to look back and Draco was kissing him. His lips were on Harry’s, hard and almost unyielding, teeth biting at his lips, hands slipped under his shirt.
“That has got to be the least subtle way to enter or exit anywhere, ever,” Pansy sighed. Harry smirked at her, but didn’t say anything. His mind was still reeling.
The conditions of my parole are to stay within the grounds of Hogwarts and refrain from use of magic outside of class, other than small wandless spells. And to help rebuild, of course. As it turns out, I did not do much of the rebuilding part.
“If it’s your fault, it’s mine, too,” Harry said, looking at him hard. They were standing facing each other, less than an arms length apart. Harry had to tilt his head slightly to look Draco in the eye. When Draco began to protest, he continued. “I could have gone to him sooner; could have given up sooner. I should have. Less people would have died. But I was scared, so I didn’t. But you – you saved me when it counted. If it hadn’t been for you at the Manor, I would have been dead.”
Harry didn’t respond, couldn’t, around the emotion in his chest. Was it fair that he, himself, was sometimes grateful he stayed? When he was laughing with Pansy, in quiet moments with Blaise; whenever Draco was near him and the sadness was at bay. Was it fair that he didn’t hurt, in those moments? Was he allowed – could he allow himself to live in this world, fully and properly, ever again?
Briefly, Harry wanted to argue. In the Days Before he would have, woudln’t have liked the implication that he was weak or afraid. Now, though, he thought about how he posed a danger for Teddy with his outbursts. How he almost hurt Ron and Hermione, but turned the magic inward on himself instead. How he was afraid for Draco because the other boy couldn’t carry a wand.
He glanced around furtively before reaching into his jeans pocket and pulling out a cigarette and a lighter. There were charms for this, of course, but his magic had been unstable to say the least in the Days After; once he had set fire to Andromeda’s back garden, so for now he stuck to lighters.
“I know,” Draco gave him an odd sort of smile. “I would have hurt you if you hadn’t. Not all these scars are from you, anyways.”
Harry gave her a shrug. It wasn’t as though there was much in particular that he could say. It was strange, really, having so many people flock to protect him after a life spent in the Days Before being treated like an adult for so long before he was even near to being one.
“But Dumbledore-” she began, but Harry cut her off surprising even himself with the sound of his laugh.
“All right, Hermione?” He asked before he could stop himself. Before he could think better of it he moved towards her, placing a hand on her back.
The buzzing in his body slowly cooled. He was able to eat a couple bites of toast, and Draco poured him coffee that warmed him from the inside. He wasn’t feeling calm by any means, but he was present. And in the Days After that was often the best he could hope for.
“No,” Draco ground out again, supressing a shudder. He had been hurt in exchange for his refusal, been punished while he was at the Manor for Christmas, and then again for Easter.
“They’re probably your Gryffindor’s, anyway,” Blaise said when Harry turned a pleading look on him. Since it was clear that no one else was going to help him, Harry hauled himself up with a sigh, careful not to touch any of his papers strewn over the bed.
Harry bit his collar bone, none too gently. “Nothing, particularly, except for all the Gryffindor’s getting pissed off some shit rum and this being the closest place to be sick from it.”
“Isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “Tell me, when you waltzed into the castle with Potter in toe and went to find your friends, did it occur to you why it was only them locked away? Why they didn’t save any kids or Slytherins or
teaching first year history – two double periods per week, each a mixture of all the houses that had students – but he had wanted to keep it quiet until classes were underway.
Draco’s laughter followed them out of the bathroom and toward the eighth year common room. Harry privately thought he had never heard a better sound.
“The three of them, really,” Draco sighed. “It’s not as though I have a choice, and I’ll still be in my own rooms.”
“You’re all going to get to learn history this year in a way that no one else has learned it at Hogwarts since…before Professor Binns.” The class tittered at this. Bolstered, Harry continued on. “I need you all to work hard and do well, because if we all do well together that means other students will get to learn what you’re going to be learning this year. And I think it’s much more interesting than what Professor Binns is teaching,” he added with a wink. All the students laughed again.
And then Draco was pressing him against the wall and his mouth was parting Harry’s, his tongue gently prodding, his hands roaming Harry’s body as if making sure he was all in one piece. They parted slowly, Harry unable to disguise his heavy breathing. He reached out as Draco leaned back, hand going to the other boys’ hair to push it behind his ear and out of his face.
“You were having a nightmare,” she explained evenly, as though that explained everything. She stepped back to sit on Blaise’s bed – which, Harry noticed, was empty, and looked at him expectantly.
“Sorry,” Blaise said offhandedly, noting perhaps the tension on his friends faces, “but it’s true. They hurt people. Really hurt people.”
“Of course not,” she said, finally. “I saw it through the window. Also three lampreys, two trouts, and I think a Salmon, but that doesn’t really make sense because they’re supposed to live in rivers.” She was looking at him expectantly and didn’t seem to notice Blaise, who was trying to hide a laugh with a cough and Draco, smiling beside him. Harry elbowed Blaise in the ribs.
“They don’t,” Draco said with a harsh breath. Then he was pulling Harry – or Harry was pulling him, maybe – by the hand in the direction of his room.
He was shaken out of his spiralling thought process by McGonagall stepping up to the podium. Teddy had fallen asleep in his arms at some point during dinner and Harry bundled him close, reluctant to acknowledge that he’d have to let the boy go soon. Perhaps tomorrow he could speak to the Headmistress about spending some weekends at home with Teddy. Draco seemed to realize his distress, or maybe it was just good timing – he shifted on the bench so that Harry was leaning against his chest, rather than his side. Harry let himself relax into Draco as McGonagall began speaking.
“Can anyone think of any Muggles that may have been starting wars around the same time?” Harry asked once he had turned back to the class. Fewer hands went up, and this time it was easy to identify the purebloods by the uncomfortable glances they cast around the room.
“Me and Harry, Professor,” said the voice – Harry now recognized it as Ginny’s. “And Luna and Mal- Draco.”
“Oh, I’m Potter now, am I?” Harry smirked, but Draco had stubbornly turned back to his essay and wasn’t looking.
. It took a moment and then they were moving fast, colliding with force, kissing hard enough to bruise.
He felt Harry nudge him, and looked over to see him smiling slightly expectantly at Draco. “Oh yes,” Draco continued, drawling now. “And tea with Potter, how could I forget? Sometimes even tea with Potter
“She’s a muggle, I met her over the summer. Didn’t realize she’d be teaching though.” Harry couldn’t see him, but imagined he was looking very smug right now.
Harry laughed quietly. Draco stepped forward, and Harry closed his eyes. He felt the other man’s fingers ghost across his face, lips press to the scar on his forehead.
“That’s bullshit, Longbottom.” It was Pansy, voice firm but body trembling. Blaise was gripping her hand, looking grim. Harry didn’t look away from her, but he could feel Draco slide himself closer, press a knee to Harry’s leg. It was comforting in its own way.
In the Days Before, Harry would have been furious and probably argumentative. His identity had been Gryffindor through and through, moreso because he had
“You mean he’s not, now?” Harry snorted. Pansy smirked back at him, but her expression was slightly vacant.
“Stop working, then,” Harry responded, throwing a pillow at him. He was being a little bit obstinate. He had work to get done, too, but he was too nervous about the next day, Ron and Hermione arriving to do anything about it.
He would miss this. He would miss Andromeda and Teddy, the peace of the cottage. He’d miss visiting Hogwarts and Draco quietly, having tea with McGonagall. He’d miss flying with Charlie, who was going back to Romania, anyways.
She looked surprised, just a little, but hid it quickly. “Let’s not bring it back up,” she said, almost immediately. “I don’t want to think about…” She paused setting up her cauldron to rub her face. “We’re here now. That’s all.”
Draco snorted inelegantly. “No one can ever get any work done when Pansy Parkinson is around.” But he stood up from the chair and jumped onto the bed, straddling Harry at his hips. “Is this what you want?” he leaned forward, his breath in Harry’s ear, nose brushing his cheek.
Draco kissed him gently; the side of his mouth, under his jaw, then sat back, running his fingers through Harry’s wayward hair. “Don’t be sorry,” Draco said. “It’s not your fault.”
And then, Hermione, you were being hurt by Bellatrix. And I wish I could say I would hear your screams for the rest of my life, but I won’t, because that was nothing compared to what I saw at the hands of the Carrows. You are branded, though – not like I, of course. I am branded by choice, poor though it may have been. You are branded because of your birth, due to something you can’t control.
It wasn’t until she had swooped forward and wrapped him in a hug that he realized he had been crying, tear tracks tracing their way down his face and into the soft cashmere of her jumper. A wail sounded from down the hall.
“Oh please,” Ron said, finally. His face was bright red, like there was anger boiling just beneath the surface. Harry could feel the explosion coming – wished he could run, wished he would be able to yell back. In the Days Before he certainly would have been able to – yell back, at least. But in the Days After he was just struck by how desperately he wanted to sleep the world away.
“We’re hunting for fish,” Mar said, so innocently Harry had to focus to keep from laughing. Draco and Blaise were both watching from somewhere behind him – he only knew because he could distinctly hear both of them laughing.
Harry let his head rest back on his pillow, giving himself a moment to process. His magic had exploded, so – “Are they alright?” he asked, suddenly full of worry. He felt sick.
Harry hung back as Madame Pomfrey asked for directions from a tall, grumpy looking mediwizard. Harry made eye contact with the man accidentally, but his eyes only widened and then he looked away from Harry with a grimace and an eye-roll. Harry couldn’t help but smirk - it would have irked him in the Days Before, no doubt, to be looked at as if he were a piece of dirt on someone’s shoe, but now he found it preferable. A side effect of death, perhaps? Or a side effect of spending eighteen years of his life constantly in the newspapers, feeling like he had to fight for people’s favour.
He followed the crowd inside, sticking close to Draco, Parkison, and Zabini. He felt a strange kinship with them - it was definitely strange, seeing as how Pansy had all but offered him to Voldemort during the Battle. But they were subdued; he could feel the anxiety from all of them, mirroring his own. He no longer had it in him to be boisterous, not in the Days After. Maybe he truly had belonged in Slytherin all along. Or maybe, as Andromeda had said, grief had changed him.
He let his fingers trail down Dracos body, pausing at the hemline of his sweater. Draco arched up, helping Harry to pull it off him, exposing his pale skin underneath. Harry reached down and pulled his own shirt off of his head.
The eighth years followed McGonagall out of her office and down the spiralling staircase into the main body of the castle. It had been rebuilt well, a far cry from the castle’s appearance when they had all gathered for the two month anniversary of the battle. Paintings had been restored, walls rebuilt. But everywhere Harry looked, he saw flashes from the past in his mind eye; crumbling walls, curses flying, Fred falling, Colin Creevy still on the ground, Lavendar Brown’s body broken on the corridor floor.
He paused, breathing heavily, keeping his hands to himself before dropping them and letting them trail along the scars on Draco’s torso.
, Draco was quite confident he was a small step away from hyperventilating like a stupid twelve-year-old. But then Potter reached out and brushed Draco’s side again, and he could feel the tremor in his hands and – was it wrong that it made Draco feel a little bit better, to know Harry was just as worried?
“You should do Potter’s hair, Pans,” Draco said when a moment of silence got too long to be comfortable. “He wants to grow it.”
“We were wondering if we could talk,” Hermione said carefully. She was glancing past him, into their room, and Harry could feel the cold stares his friends aimed at her, even if he couldn’t see them.
that floated around the hall, especially as they passed the Gryffindor table. When they reached the eighth years’ table, Pansy’s face had softened. She and Blaise had left two seats open between them. Harry slid in beside Pansy while Draco sat on his other side, beside Blaise, who engaged him in conversation almost immediately.
“Lots of reasons,” Draco said. “At least I’d imagine. There’s the risk of exposing muggle children to magic, for one thing.”
“Don’t act like you don’t have blood on your hands because you wouldn’t use some unforgivables, you bastard. You have the blood on your hands of every person who was hurt after you left and didn’t take anyone with you, of every Slytherin child who was hurt from the first
hoping to have a full out line by the next chapter i post so that it's less drabbly more actually-has-a-story-line, not that i couldn't drabble on about pansy being a queen for ages but-
“What is it?” Harry asked. He took it and swallowed, dimly aware of Madame Pomfrey saying something before fell back into sleep.
“Would you believe he didn’t say a word to me the entire time? Frankly I’m not quite sure he’s smart enough to speak,” Draco smiled at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“It was, at that.” They both jumped at a voice behind them. It was Professor McGonagall, having clearly just exited her office, which was just around the corner. Harry felt himself blush.
You three had to continue to save me, of course. I had accepted it, with the Fiendfyre. What a stupid decision, but it was alright. If we were going to kill Harry Potter at least I would be dead, too, and the result would not matter.
Harry cast a look around him – most of the gathered students just looked confused. Hermione looked appreciative, of course. So did Pansy.
Mar squealed and gave them a jerky wave before dashing off to the Slytherin table. At almost the same moment, McGonagall appeared beside the group with their timetables.
When the Healer proceeded with the same examination the mediwtch had, humming and hawing and finally asking to speak to Madame Pomfrey in a separate room, though, that was when Harry lost it. It was possibly the first time he had felt angry since….well, since the Days Before, probably.
“Oh please,” Ron said, finally. His face was bright red, like there was anger boiling just beneath the surface. Harry could feel the explosion coming – wished he could run, wished he would be able to yell back. In the Days Before he certainly would have been able to – yell back, at least. But in the Days After he was just struck by how desperately he wanted to sleep the world away.
– Neville could have been him, could have been the one targeted by Voldemort, the one who had to die. It could have always been like this, Harry in Slytherin with Draco and Pansy and Blaise, and Neville tromping around the castle and getting into trouble with Ron and Hermione. It felt
“I don’t disagree with you,” she said after a moment. “I’ve seen it in my lifetime. I am afraid, sometimes, that war is inevitable, thought I know it is not.” She looked up at him then. It was a careful look, adult-to-adult, rather than teacher-to-student. “I do not know that we can do anything about it. We are just two people.”
All in all, it looked as though there were around twenty five eighth years returning. Harry flinched again as the floo flared and Theodore Nott stepped through, felt Dracos’ hand brush his wrist. He missed Ron and Hermione sorely in this moment, more than he had missed them yet. Something about being at Hogwarts made their absence feel profound.
“If it’s your fault, it’s mine, too,” Harry said, looking at him hard. They were standing facing each other, less than an arms length apart. Harry had to tilt his head slightly to look Draco in the eye. When Draco began to protest, he continued. “I could have gone to him sooner; could have given up sooner. I should have. Less people would have died. But I was scared, so I didn’t. But you – you saved me when it counted. If it hadn’t been for you at the Manor, I would have been dead.”
“Nothing,” Harry said emphatically. Maybe too emphatically – the small girl startled. “There’s nothing wrong with anyone liking girls or anyone liking boys.”
i'm honestly not in love with this chapter but honestly i think its because i feel like i struggle with writing dialogue a lot..legit spent all day on this one even though i had things to do!! worth tho. a plot is slowly forming in my brain...
“Must I always clean up your messes, Potter?” he sighed. There was no malice behind it, though, and Harry was able to roll his eyes back before turning around to see Mar grinning ear-to-ear at him. She was bouncing on the balls of her feet, too, but she wasn’t tapping her fingers today.
Ron tossed down a newspaper clipping in front of him, from the Daily Prophet. He could only make out a headline, dark black on the pale parchment of the newspaper.
The air carried a slight chill, as if it knew it was the first day of term. He struck off in the direction of the forest, opting to take a path beside the lake. It was peaceful here, the most peaceful place he had been in days.
“They really are trying to make sure we have the most work possible, aren’t they?” Blaise sighed. Draco smiled at him, but Harry noticed that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. He knew it was frustrating to Draco to watch his classmates get to choose professors to shadow, be assigned to rooms, help younger students, meanwhile he wasn’t even allowed to carry a wand outside of class.
It was Draco, of course, with a plate of breakfast and a concerned look on his face. “Blaise told us what happened,” he said, and it took a moment for the memories to come rushing back in. His nightmare, Lupin’s pale face, Tonks’ haunted eyes, Sirius’ anger and Colin’s despair – Bellatrix holding his friends hostage. His stomach heaved despite himself.
“What is it?” Harry asked. Neville made a vague gesture at Draco, Blaise and Pansy, but Harry shook his head. “They stay.”
Professor Stone waved them in. Harry could feel the concerned look she trained on him as he walked by, but he kept looking ahead. There were more pressing things on his mind than his breakdown – like why Ginny Weasley had shown up out of nowhere after months of anger to partner with him in potions.
“Hey,” Harry said. He reached over to grab Draco’s right hand and hold it, feeling a little bit guilty as he did so. “There’s nothing there,” he said. “There hasn’t been anything there in over a year.”
“Tomorrow morning, under a few conditions,” Madame Pomfrey said, giving him a pointed look. “The Headmistress will be here in a moment to discuss.”
“What was that for?” Harry asked finally, once his breath was back. He let Draco lead him to the bed and threw himself on top of it, utterly spent.
Then Draco was taking his shirt off slowly. Harry’s whole body was heating uncontrollably, his heart racing.
“You don’t need magic for History of Magic, so I see no reason why not,” she responded after giving him a level look. “However, if you are having difficulty catching up with your school work please inform me. Professor Binns will be able to substitute for you if you need.”
. And it was strange – they weren’t even inside the classroom yet, not even seated, but she was speaking as if they were.
“What are we learning then?” asked Mar. She looked a little bit confused – or maybe frustrated – and was sitting slightly apart than the rest of her classmates. He decided that he would definitely keep an eye on her during this class, especially. Instead of expressing his concern, though, he smiled at her.
Harry was back on him, then, Draco pliant underneath his hands. He pushed Draco down, straddling him as he lay down on his cloak, kissing anger and longing and apology across the pale scars on Draco’s chest and abdomen.
“I saw people who-” he gasped as Draco’s fingers tweaked a nipple, “-who died in the war. They blamed me.” He didn’t specify, didn’t need to, not for Draco to understand. Draco bent to kiss him again,
“Still angry, then?” he asked, despite his better judgement telling him to be quiet and just do what she said. Handling an angry Ginny was much like handling an angry Pansy – nod, agree, and do whatever she asks of you.
And Draco Malfoy, that night on the Astronomy Tower. Things could never go back to how they were, and somehow, despite everything, Harry was infinitely grateful.
Harry rolled his eyes, Draco saw it in his peripheral vision, but he refused to acknowledge it. Pansy was also rolling her eyes. All his friends were traitors.
They stood together and parted ways at the door to the Great Hall, Pansy and Blaise heading outside and Draco and Harry turning left towards the Owlrey.
“Now would you like to tell me why you’re here instead of at school? Does anyone know where you are?” Harry avoided meeting her eyes, not wanting to see the worry that was likely playing out in them.
“When will Ron and Hermione be at Hogwarts?” Andromeda directed the question at both of them, although of course Draco would have no way of knowing the answer.
“Your attention, please!” He jumped and winced as McGonagall clapped her hands to bring the group to attention. He wasn’t the only one, either. Draco’s hand that had been brushing his arm suddenly gripped his wrist hard.
As it turned out, finding Ron and Hermione was a relatively fruitless endeavour. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t find them, they were seated in the middle of the common room. It was more that they were surrounded on all sides by people who had missed them and wanted to catch up. Harry didn’t begrudge them that, not really, in the Days Before he would have joined. But now – well, no one liked him now, that was part of it. But he was also too shaken from his nightmare to handle a crowd of that size.
to find a reason to get us sent home and we don’t particularly want to give him one. Your goodie two shoes Gryffindor pals don’t seem to want to lend us a hand, either,” Harry felt as if he were a small child being spoken sternly to for misbehaving. “So we are going to leave before anyone else is up and have a cozy breakfast with the house elves.”
“Better than what, Potter?” Draco growled. “Better than getting to go places? Or see your friends? Better than being the world’s saviour?”
“This is not the first time the wizarding world – or even the muggle world has gone through something like this,” she said carefully. “People will want to be careful, now more than ever before, that we prevent the same type of war from happening again.”
They were all huddled in Blaise and Harry’s room, as usual. Harry was on his bed, lesson plans for his first years spread out around him along with their introductory essays. Pansy was at Blaise’s desk, the heavy tome open in front of her. She had some complex looking calculations on a parchment beside her that Harry didn’t have enough of an arithmancy grasp to even come close to understanding. Draco was at Harry’s desk, pretending he couldn’t hear them all in favour of his potions book. Blaise was, of course, on the floor between beds.
“Everything, really,” Harry said after a moment’s pause. “I’ve overseen two detentions so far. We’re updating curriculum-” he cut himself off. He wasn’t supposed to tell anyone this, really – except Draco, and by extension Pansy and Blaise. In fact, McGonagall had given him and Draco express permission to tell the other two, seeing as they were always together anyways.
Harry knocked on Hagrid’s door with some trepidation. The week before, Hermione had led them to Hagrid’s Hut and demanded that he return to teaching. Hagrid had taken the week off in response to Rita Skeeter’s article claiming he was a half giant. Dumbledore had the same idea, and the improvised meeting ended with Hagrid agreeing to go back to work. Right before they left, Hagrid asked Harry to come back the next weekend, as he had something he wanted to talk to him about.
He went to go sit in his favorite chair by the fire. He couldn’t believe how awful his life was right now. He had lost several friends, including his best friend, everyone else was taking every opportunity to taunt him, he was being thought of as a liar or an attention-seeking prat, and to top it all off, he was still having intimacy issues with Draco. Being with him was wonderful, and he enjoyed everything that they did together, physical or not, but every now and then, he recoiled. Draco was always understanding and always seemed to know whether to give him space or hold him close. Harry was hard on himself, however.
“Of course,” Fred said, very seriously. “You’ll always be our brother, Perce. No matter how much of a prat you are.” George nodded, just as seriously from his side.
They agreed that their Christmas presents to each other would be things to spruce up the Fortress Room. Draco had brought a vase, coasters, and a couple pillows and blankets. Harry found a muggle painting (not wanting the Hogwarts’ paintings’ inhabitants to find them), and a decorative changing screen they weren’t sure where to put.
The trio stopped and turned towards Malfoy, tensing as they did. “Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” Malfoy exclaimed. He was Malfoy with that cruel mask in place. “Listen to this!” He went on to quote the entire article, which was talking about a mistaken alarm raised by “Mad-Eye Moody” and answered by Mr. Weasley.
Draco was hesitant after one of them to do much of anything, Harry usually had to instigate things. That made him feel more in control, so it was a good thing. He was on top, and they had realized he felt more comfortable like that. He was the one that set the pace as they moved together. He was moving his hips to the same rhythm of Draco’s heartbeat. He was sucking on his pulse point on his neck and could feel it with his tongue.
He fell to his knees next to where he was lying on the floor. “What’s wrong with him?” He asked Dobby when it became apparent Draco wasn’t just sleeping. He took his hand.
“Harry, you’re going to get a horcrux, there are unknowable dangers you’re about to face. You need it more than I do.” Harry sighed, but swished the small amount around in the vial, before glaring at Draco. He put it in his mouth, under his tongue, and constricted his neck. He held out his arms, as if to ask, “happy?”
He had meant it thinking Sirius was going to threaten him, but Sirius just put his hand up to his chin, stroking slowly. “I’m not sure. Harry, what are you getting?” He was perfectly calm.
Harry stared at them, hurt. At least with their annoying looks they weren’t blatantly keeping him out of the loop. He had been feeling more and more the third wheel between the two of them as the years went on. Perhaps that was somewhat his fault. He had branched out and the two of them had gotten closer as a result, but he would never know if that would have happened anyway and he would have been left out even if he hadn’t gone off with Draco and his other friends. Eventually, he'd have to fall in love with someone, even if it hadn't been Draco, Ron and Hermione would need to accept that.
Harry sighed. “I never said I thought he was a Death Eater, I said it was weird when I saw him jump when my scar hurt. I just said I think he’s in trouble.”
Draco and Harry drew their wands, keeping their left hands together, to the other’s forehead, nonverbally spelling clear water in a trickle, signifying the purity of their intentions and deeming the other clean. They let the water stay, droplets running down their faces. Harry was rather happy to feel the refreshing coolness of the water as it helped center him quite a bit, he felt a lot of the tension leave him.
Draco sighed. Here it was, his first test as a loyal Death Eater’s son. “Aright. You caught me. My father may have implied that something would be happening soon, but I wasn’t sure what. Not a common occurrence, I assure you.”
There was a lot of information there. He already knew all the explicitly stated, but the news that Sirius Black was after him, specifically, was new. Underneath all the thinly veiled insults, Draco was being pretty obvious that he still cared about Harry. That was way more important than someone else being after him. He was used to having his life be in danger at this point.
“Ah. Dudley pushed me off a curb into the street. I caught my elbow on the concrete.” Draco took in a deep breath of air and let it out slowly. He raised the arm up to his face and kissed the scar reverently. At Harry’s attempt to reach his mouth, he turned until their lips could touch. They stayed under the spray for a long while, until their skin got wrinkly and muscles grew sore. They got dressed and meandered towards the door.
Harry didn’t send any more gifts, but sometimes he saw something in Draco’s eyes when they threw insults at each other in passing. The confrontations increased, leaving Harry to wonder if Draco was seeking him out. Harry found himself enjoying them, as unhealthy as he was sure that was. Draco had a way of crafting words into art, and he liked being able to use his sass and wit to someone who appreciated it.
Draco laughed breathlessly. “Yes,” he whispered back, and forced Harry down again, kissing him passionately.
Harry groaned. “Morning.” He still wasn’t feeling great about the night previous and didn’t really want to get up. Draco sobered immediately, as if sensing his mood. Harry was laying on his back, staring at the ceiling, and Draco curled up to him, putting his head on his chest and moving Harry’s arm around his back.
Did that make enough sense? It's like a movie trailer. I've never seen anyone do this before, but maybe I'll start a trend. You saw it first here, folks!
"Well, I have one idea," Draco whispered. He waited until Harry looked up. "Do you want to get married?"
He brought his radio from his and Draco’s room, and began swaying his hips slightly as he got lost in the music. He had been looking over the schedule he and Draco had made up of what they would be doing, but he loved the song that came on.
Draco’s eyes widened, he jumped up and started his explanation. “Madam, I just wanted to check on Harry, I was so worried about him and I couldn’t come and see him earlier!”
“Nev,” he began, trying to come up with the words to say – trying to come up with a way to fix it, a way to apologize for not being the saviour they had needed. But he was interrupted.
Harry sat heavily in the stool next to her, knowing better than to interrupt Hermione when she was angry. He didn’t fancy a flock of charmed birds flying at his head, thank you very much.
Harry ran his hand through his hair. A couple times. These were the kinds of things he needed Pansy for. Mar had started tapping her collarbone, though, like she often did. And the more he let the silence go on, the faster she tapped. He gathered himself together in a deep breath.
“We heard that you were planning on assigning two eighth years per house this year,” Pansy began after a pregnant pause. The Headmistress looked shocked – whatever she had been expecting from the two of them, it was not this.
were tortured, Weasley?” she asked, almost deathly quiet. Weasley, at least, had the sense to look abashed. Granger looked panicked. “Has the thought that Slytherins were tortured, too, never entered that thick skull of yours? You think they cared about anyone’s blood status and not just-” she cut off with a sob, Draco realized, horrified.
He had fought with Ron and Hermione of course, many times, but it was never quite like this. It never felt like it was something that might never be repaired. Never felt quite like the end of the world – a signal, if anything, that the Days Before were really behind him. Perhaps in the Days After he wasn’t friends with Ron and Hermione – perhaps it was marked by death. His own, his friendships, his old life.
I’ve started this letter too many times and I have potions work to do, so I’m not going to start over anymore.
and then you two come in from your stupid vacation with your stupid prejudices and have to ruin it. You should have said from the beginning that you’d rather spend time with Smith and his cronies than here, would have saved us all the energy of bothering to even try.”
Your wish is my command, this will be a full length fic! I don't have a plot fleshed out really, but I'm hoping it'll develop as I go along...
in the next column. Randy was quiet, Harry was fairly certain he was a half-blood or pure-blood, although he had asked none of his students about their blood status. It was clear he had never been to school before Hogwarts – he often seemed overwhelmed by the number of people in his class and the noise around the castle.
He drew four columns on the board and turned back to the class. “I think we all know at least one evil wizard that we’ll be talking about today,” he said. There were some whispers, but no one said anything out loud, so he continued on. Turning back to the chalkboard he wrote
“I am Harry Potter,” he said. A wave of shock went through the group – he did his best to tactfully ignore it. “What’s your name?”
And then it was nearing dinner, Pansy and Blaise had gone for a walk, and it was just him and Draco and the overwhelming cloud of sadness that had followed Harry all day.
I will not give you details about what I experienced in the war. It was horrendous, it was wrong. I cannot compare it to your experiences – you put yourself under great duress for the good of everyone. I put myself under great duress for the good of nobody except the Dark Lord. Sometimes, in my mind, I am irredeemable, but I try not to give into that. My choices do not define my worth, but they do decide my consequences.
Hermione put her head on the table, cradled in her hands. She didn’t shake off the tentative hand that Harry put on her shoulders.
He gasped, breath hot on Draco’s cock. A bit of precum dripped, slowly, and Harry lapped it up with his tongue. Draco’s breath was uneven, his hands tangling in Harry’s hair and pulling hard. Harry’s own hardness pressed almost painfully against his trousers.
“Did you go to your appointment at Mungo’s already?” Andy asked. He knew if he looked too closely she’d have that knowing look in her eyes - the kind of look only someone who was the mother of someone like Tonks could get.
“Sort of friends?” Draco asked. There was amusement tinging his voice, now. Part of Harry wanted to make fun of him for being jealous, but the other part of Harry knew that would, more likely than not, end in disaster.
Harry kissed Teddy on the forehead and stepped outside. The sun was beginnign to set, washing the world in pink and orange hues. As he walked, he tried not to look at the spots that held memories from the Days Before. Where he and Hagrid had crashed the motorcycle after seeing Voldemort on their way to this very cottage. Tried not to remember Moody’s death, George’s ear, Lupin and Tonks and Fred alive.
Harry laughed to himself. McGonagall had been trying to find out from him what exactly was the cause of the strange dynamic between the eighth years, but he had refused to say anything. Better it come from the mouths of the Slytherins, if they decided to tell her.
The first day of term was tomorrow. Ron and Hermione would be arriving in the morning, which Harry was uncharacteristically nervous about, given the dynamic between the eighth years right now. The rest of the school would be arriving in the evening for the Welcome Feast and Sorting, and Andromeda would be visiting with Teddy as well. They had visited already this week – Teddy had already stolen Pansy’s heart.
“As far as I know, just Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, and Goyle. I think Millicent is going to Durmstrang with Daphne Greengrass. The rest have chosen not to, or…” he trailed off, but the words remained unspoken.
Draco had filled out well over the summer and first part of the school year. He wasn’t a shell of a person anymore – neither was Harry. There was lean muscle to his arms now, his face was more than just bones, even if he was still quite aristocratic and pointy-looking. He was all angles, his hair falling in loose waves down to his chin, and there wasn’t a single thing Harry disliked.
“All right, Hermione?” He asked before he could stop himself. Before he could think better of it he moved towards her, placing a hand on her back.
As he looked around the Slytherin table, mostly vacant as students piled around Pansy and Draco, Harry noticed a group of what was definitely first years all sitting closely together, about ten of them, it seemed. With a nervous glance at Pansy, who was still engrossed with the students surrounding her, he made his way over.
“There are mean words for a lot of things, and a lot of people that there’s really nothing wrong with,” Harry tried. Mar looked confused. He tried again. “A lot of people say mean things, and that’s why there are mean words.”
“You will also become familiar with some of the eighth years as your House Guardians. You will meet them tonight in your common rooms, and in just a few moments they will also be responsible for showing the first years the way to their dormitories. You are expected to treat the House Guardians as prefects; they are able to award and remove points, even from Prefects.”
By the time he came back out, Andromeda was in the sitting room with a tea for each of them. Harry set Teddy down on his mat on the floor and Andromeda charmed some bubbles to float above him and keep him occupied. Harry settled himself in the couch and accepted the tea that Andromeda sent floating over with another wave of her wand.
For some reason Microsoft Word deleted over half the chapter so i had to rewrite it, which was not my faovurite thing in the world to do espeically since it's an actually pivotal chapter in terms of plot and the direction of this story. sigh.
“I want to get Muggle Studies out of the way,” Blaise said with a sigh. “No use in putting it until the last minute and then not being able to graduate after all this.”
“Stop,” it was Draco’s voice, quiet but commanding, clearly directed at Harry and Blaise. He glanced at Zabini, who dropped his wand, gaze remaining on the four in front of them. Harry followed suit, turned his eyes to Draco as the other boy wiped the spit off his face, rolled up his sleves to display his Mark – faded, but there.
He hadn’t told the Slytherins about the map yet, had wanted to wait until Ron and Hermione were here and had met them. He mostly was hoping that showing them after Ron and Hermione had gotten used to them would make them feel less betrayed that someone else knew the secret of the Map and his Cloak. Now, though, he wasn’t so sure they’d all ever get used to each other.
“Yes,” Harry said. Silence settled between them as Harry gathered his thoughts, trying to decide how to explain. “I suppose it’s just…even if it is in my head, that doesn’t mean it’s not real,” he said finally. “And-” he paused, not sure he wanted to voice the next part, even to Andromeda.
He didn’t begrudge them for how they acted towards him either, not really. They were right – he had been gone. Maybe being on the run wasn’t the best way to spend the year, nor the Horcruxes or Ron leaving, but it was a sight better than watching the Carrows force students to hurt each other.
Of course, you got away, Harry with my wand. The danger that put me in – suffice to say I was punished and badly. Did you know it is much harder to practice occlumency without a wand? I do, now. But it was irrelevant at that point, I had the seeds of doubt placed and I looked only to survive from then on. Make little noise, do as I was told, don’t argue. I was not allowed to go back to Hogwarts. They wanted to keep an eye on me.
Harry nuzzled his neck. “They don’t know I’m out yet,” he said, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Ron misses you,” she said angrily, as if it were somehow his fault. “And he thinks we should make up with you but you don’t - neither of you-” she let out another great gasping sob. A pit of guilt sunk in Harry’s stomach.
Harry couldn’t help it, he let out a small groan. In the bustle of getting up to start heading to the dungeons, no one seemed to hear him except Draco, who just cast him a slightly exasperated look. Maybe he was being..dramatic, but it was for good reason. He could already think of a host of reasons why he
Draco hummed in understanding against him, curled up tighter against Harry’s body. Harry shifted to his side as well – put his forehead agasint Draco’s, let Draco tangle their legs together.
Harry felt Draco lower himself onto him, his mouth never leaving Harry’s. They rocked together, breath’s coming in sharp gasps, hands quivering, bodies straining. Draco came first, with a soft keening cry. He reached his hand down, speeding up his pace against Harry’s cock until his world exploded into a blaze of light.
The common room was warm, reminding him distinctly of the Gryffindor common room. A fire was already burning in the fireplace to their right, warming the air. There was a mishmash of chairs and couches spread around it, as though the professors had simply dug up any undamaged furniture they could find in the castle. Bookshelves lined the wall opposite, and chairs and tables were scattered around. Presumably the professors expected them to get more studying done here, rather than in the library – or perhaps it was just to mimic the Ravenclaw common room. The lack of windows, however, was already making Harry feel distinctly claustrophobic.
Pansy let out a small, dark laugh. “He’s interesting,” she finally said. “His dad was a Death Eater, I’m sure you know. His mum left him when we were in second year, I think. Left Theo with his dad for the whole summer between second and third year, thought it was still important for them to bond, I think.”
“Awesome,” Jason breathed. They took off towards the exit to the common room, only Jessamine remembering to go tap some of the second years on the shoulders. After the roar of noise as they exited, the common room became strangely quiet. Harry felt more tired than he had been before.
“That’s awfully poetic, Potter,” Pansy said in response. She sniffed and looked away, as if in indifference, but Harry was fairly sure he could see a tear escape one of her eyes.
Harry pointedly ignored him. “I have twenty-eight students in my first year class. Three of them can’t write – at all. They’re eleven!” He sighed. “How does a child grow up for eleven years and not learn how to write a proper sentence?”
It was late, definitely later than usual, when Harry was woken to Pansy’s voice, shrill with anxiety beside him.
“Does it count as abuse of power if I don’t have any power to begin with?” Harry asked tiredly. Harry sat down at the table next to Draco, leaning into the other boy’s warmth. He was just too tired for this.
He propped himself above Draco, breathing shakily. Harry was keenly aware of where their bodies lined up, his as lean as Draco’s from a year starving and on the run. His mind was barely keeping track of his body, but somehow he was stretched out, hips lined up with Draco’s, hands holding Draco’s hands above his head, pinned to the stone underneath them.
You know the rest, anyhow. I hadn’t expected to be spoken for at my trial. I had expected Azkaban. I cannot say with any certainty that at the point of my trial I believed that muggles weren’t inferior. I do not know when I stopped thinking that, but I am fairly certain that I was still set in my ways.
“Yeah,” Harry choked out, resisting the urge to thrust his hips in Draco’s face. As if reading his mind, Draco let out a low chuckle. Then, his lips were on Harry’s prick, and all sense of time or thought or language left Harry’s mind altogether.
“I am Harry Potter,” he said. A wave of shock went through the group – he did his best to tactfully ignore it. “What’s your name?”
I’m sure you think of me as a monster. I think of myself as a monster, too, sometimes. I won’t be self-depreciating, but I will be honest. Perhaps by the end of the war I no longer wanted to be fighting. Not because I disagreed with all of their ideals, but because I wanted to
,” he read in a monotone voice. “That’s easy. Medicine, psychology, they’ve been to the moon! All we can do is magic. If it’s a race of who’s superior, wizards lose.”
He was gratified to hear Zabini snort in resopnse, although the other man didn’t look at him or acknowledge him in any other way. Harry didn’t exactly know why he was trying to make friends with them, even Draco had given him a bemused, although not ungrateful, look.
Blaise burst out laughing, presumably at the look on Pansy’s face. Even Harry found a small smile from within himself.
“Thank you,” said McGonagall, startling him out of his reverie. He had forgotten, for a moment, that it was supposed to be a moment of silence. Had assumed the world had dampened in his mind, as it often did. She said something else that he didn’t catch, but the hall began bustling again as the first years were led in by Professor Vector.
“No,” he said, with a rueful shake of his head. “I need help with Arithmancy, though. Maybe we could all study together after classes tomorrow?”
And then everything was exploding, straight from his hands, his chest, his head – he didn’t know. The world was electric, like lightning. Someone was screaming – it was him, he realized. He was screaming. And then there was nothing.
“You had a choice,” he said, gently. “You and Ron, from the beginning. Not like me and Draco. And I am so grateful that you chose to be my friend and to follow me even when I didn’t want you to.”
“Alright,” he said gently. “Well, the older students have a lot of studying to do. Would you be able to hunt for fish outside?”
“How do you mean?” Harry stepped away to pick Teddy up as he began to fuss. As usual, the familiar weight of Teddy on his hip was a comfort - a small piece of stability in a shifting world.
So he stood there and stroked Draco’s hair instead, clumsily kissing the side of his head until they other boy was able to straighten and look at him again.
His question was vague, but Malfoy seemed to understand. He gestured for Harry’s cigarette, and spoke only after taking a deep drag and handing it back.
“Obviously,” Draco responded, but he rolled his eyes, which Harry was grateful for. He was significantly too tired to figure out how to react to sarcasm right now.
But then Draco was kissing him, gently, tenderly on the steps, and maybe, Harry thought, maybe it didn’t matter what they were Before. Maybe it only mattered that they were better now.
By the time class was due to start and all the students were settled, Professor Binns was still nowhere in sight. Feeling nervous, but deciding he may as well give it a shot, he cleared his throat to start class.
“Stalin,” she said confidently. Harry couldn’t help but shake his head in amusement. Of course if anyone had an answer it would be Mar. He wrote down the last name and then picked up a stack of parchments from his desk, handing them out manually to each student since he couldn’t use his wand.
Of course, you got away, Harry with my wand. The danger that put me in – suffice to say I was punished and badly. Did you know it is much harder to practice occlumency without a wand? I do, now. But it was irrelevant at that point, I had the seeds of doubt placed and I looked only to survive from then on. Make little noise, do as I was told, don’t argue. I was not allowed to go back to Hogwarts. They wanted to keep an eye on me.
He glanced over at Ron and Hermione. They were both watching with unabashed curiosity. Ron still looked like he was fuming. With some effort, he turned a smile to her. “What, Mar?”
“Alright?” Draco came into the room and sat delicately beside him on the couch. Andromeda followed behind him and deposited herself into the armchair by the fire, which she lit with a lazy wave of her wand.
They had taken a rare moment, just the two of them, in Draco’s room together. Pansy was meeting with the mysterious defence professor before dinner, and Blaise was waiting for her. Harry was currently sprawled out on the bed, staring at the ceiling, while Draco worked on an essay for Slughorn at his desk. His room was small, his desk close enough to the foot of his bed that Harry could reach out with a foot and touch him. The other side of his bed housed a wardrobe, and across from the bed was a door to the room – a painting of a dog on the other side that swung outwards when you pet its head in the correct pattern.
“Is someone going to tell me what happened now?” Harry asked with a huff. Andromeda squeezed his hand in warning but McGonagall just looked at him with a soft face. Somehow, that made Harry feel worse.
Currently, Harry was in the garden with said child, doing push-ups while Teddy giggled in the grass. Andromeda had banned cigarettes from her house as soon as she had found Harry with them and had given him a good stripping down that included phrases like “ghastly muggle inventions” and “horrible for the child’s lungs”. Maybe in the Days Before, Harry would have rebelled and snuck them in anyways. He knew he hadn’t cared much for authority. In the Days After, though, Andromeda was right. It was horrible for Teddy to be around.
Instead of looking gratified, Harry noticed Draco looked significantly sick. “She should hate me,” he said. “It’s my fault her – and Teddy -”
Ginny hummed thoughtfully when he was done. “It will sort itself out,” she said finally. She gave him a pointed look. “It usually does.”
She looked surprised, just a little, but hid it quickly. “Let’s not bring it back up,” she said, almost immediately. “I don’t want to think about…” She paused setting up her cauldron to rub her face. “We’re here now. That’s all.”
“No,” Draco ground out. Even after all this time - although it hadn’t really been that long since the war, sometimes it felt like ages – the insinuation that he didn’t enjoy hurting people –
It took Harry a moment before he realized what thought had crossed his mind, and he mentally kicked himself. As if the Slytherin’s hadn’t suffered, or lost anyone to the war. As if they all hated muggles. Of course they would observe a moment of silence.
That was how he ended up curled up in bed, half asleep, at a time that was horrendously early, with Draco complaining about how he needed to take better care of himself. Harry could only really grunt in response. He was more focused on the lesson plans for the next week that he still needed to complete.
“I felt left behind,” he said, finally. “When you and Ron went to Australia. I know I could have come-” he added, when she opened her mouth indignantly, “but I couldn’t have, really. Andy needed help with Teddy and I needed…to feel stable, I guess. I didn’t realize it was so hard for you. You always seemed to be having such a good time.”
a reflection to write for their muggle studies seminar the previous evening. Perhaps Pansy would help him with that one.
He was woken, unsure of how much time had passed, to Draco shaking him. “The Welcome Feast is soon,” Draco said. “And we need to find Blaise and Pansy.”
“Isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “Tell me, when you waltzed into the castle with Potter in toe and went to find your friends, did it occur to you why it was only them locked away? Why they didn’t save any kids or Slytherins or
“Let’s get you up,” he muttered to the boy, brushing the last of his tears from his eyes before leaning into the crib and scooping Teddy up by his armpits. He moved the boy to the change table to change his nappy quickly - no matter what he said about equality and muggles, some things were just better with magic. This was one of those things.
“The look that tells me I should start insulting you before you get a big head,” Draco said with a grin. He leaned in, and Harry found his laugh captured in Draco’s lips.
Harry nodded numbly but managed to give her a small smile before his feet took him down the hall to Teddy’s room. The boy wasn’t so little anymore and he wasn’t crying anymore either - instead, he was kicking his legs in his crib, rotating his small body towards the door where Harry had entered.
“That’s bollocks and you know it,” Harry hissed. He opened his mouth to say more but was interrupted by a squeal.
He was dimly aware of their location somehwere near the Hufflepuff common rooms when Professor McGonagall stopped walking. She stood in front of a carving on the wall that looked to be the Hogwarts crest. Dimly, Harry wondered if this was on the Maurader’s Map, although he knew it wasn’t. He was torn between wanting to ask Hermione if she could change the Map to include the eighth year common room, and not wanting to touch anything his father had made.
Harry licked another stripe along Draco’s length, wrapping his hands around Draco’s thighs, feeling him shudder and lean into him. Then his mouth was on Draco, sliding impossibly far down his cock before pulling back working up a rhythm. He lost himself in the pace, he had never done this before, but if the noises Draco was making were anything to go by, then he wasn’t doing it half badly.
“The Carrows didn’t care,” Draco said quietly. “They didn’t care about blood status, they were crazy. Do you know who stood up to them, when your lot left? Pansy did.” Weasley had gone pale, and Granger had slouched back in her chair. “Hate me all you want,” Draco continued, ignoring Blaise’s sharp look in his direction. “I’m the Death Eater, and I will own that.”
“Harry,” the familiar voice sounded behind him before he even had the chance to see if she had made her way down from the table. He turned in his seat, accidentally knocking Draco’s hand off his knee as he turned.
“Probably,” he said, finally. He buried his face in Teddy’s hair and closed his eyes, focusing on the babbling of the boy in his hands.
That made him smile at her, only slightly. “I think I’m done with any favours of the death sort, honestly,” he said.
“It wouldn’t matter, you know,” Draco said finally, as they mounted the stairs to the owlrey. Harry shot him a questioning look.
The class nodded in agreement. “We’re going to learn about some muggle history, too.” He anticipated whispers, and let them have a moment of surprise before hushing them. “We’re going to learn about World War One and World War Two, mostly, and what the role of wizards were during those wars. Now, can you all take out a quill and some parchment for me?”
“Let me,” Draco whispered, before nipping his earlobe. He pressed their bodies together at the hips. Harry felt his knees go weak at the pressure. Then his tie was in Draco’s hands, but instead of undoing it Draco was pulling on it, forcing Harry to tilt his head to the side. He felt Draco’s exposed mouth on the skin of his neck, then, their bodies pressed together as Draco licked and sucked. He was sure that there would be a mark but didn’t care, not now.
Harry barely had time to slide his hands in Draco’s hair before he pulled away, breathing hard. Harry tried to follow, searching Draco’s lips out with his own, but Draco stepped back.
They didn’t work for very long. Harry could barely keep his eyes open after a couple hours of writing, but with Draco’s help he managed to finish his transfiguration essay and his muggle studies reflection. The rest of the group was planning on working through dinner, but Draco essentially dragged Harry out of the room, demanding they go rest.
“Me and Harry, Professor,” said the voice – Harry now recognized it as Ginny’s. “And Luna and Mal- Draco.”
“Then, last year, he didn’t come to school. Rumour was going around he was in hiding with his mum – she was never a Death Eater. Not many women were, though. And this year it seems he’s become pals with your lot. That’s all, really.”
Last year, though, I watched people killed in front of me. I had Lovegood and Ollivander in my cellar. No, my dungeons. What kind of person grows up in a house with dungeons? I hadn’t known they were there, not until I came home and was given the task of bringing them food and water – when the Dark Lord felt like feeding the prisoners.
There were probably healthier ways to achieve the same thing. Meditation, maybe. Occlumency, probably. But he’d never been good at either. When he smoked, at least he didn’t have to put in effort.
He caught a startled look from Draco as Andromeda wrapped him into a hug. She hadn’t been brought up to be particularly warm, Harry knew, and Draco may have expected the traditional Black aloofness in her. But she couldn’t have raised a daughter like Tonks without learning how to be warm.
They fell silent, looking at each other over the desk. Minerva was the first to break, looking down at her clasped hands and away from Harry’s face.
“That’s our cue,” Pansy sighed. “Remember to try not to make an idiot of yourself.” She cast a look at Harry specifically. He just rolled his eyes, He had learned, in the past week, that she got like this when she was nervous – angry and abrasive. Or rather, more angry and abrasive than usual.
There I go, dithering again. Anyways, that was the first time I perhaps was able to realize that what I believed and how I experienced the world was wrong. I am sorry that you had to be the person to prove that to me in such a gruesome way.
They didn’t work for very long. Harry could barely keep his eyes open after a couple hours of writing, but with Draco’s help he managed to finish his transfiguration essay and his muggle studies reflection. The rest of the group was planning on working through dinner, but Draco essentially dragged Harry out of the room, demanding they go rest.

from.” Her mouth had twisted in a line, but she looked distraught. And honestly, for someone who was supposedly the brightest witch of their age, she was being gratingly obtuse right now.
was untouchable and aloof, but it made me crave his acceptance and love more. My most cherished memories are when he would pay me attention; he would sit me on the desk in his study and speak with me as if I were a man, not a young boy. He would tell me about my legacy as a wizard, as a Malfoy. Explain to me the importance of pure blood. Why shouldn’t I have believed him?
“No arguments,” said the Headmistress firmly. “You are here at my request, and if necessary I will see you leave at my request, too.”
“We weren’t good people, any of us,” she finally said. “Except maybe Nott. And the Greengrasses, they were always wonderful. Tracey Davis was a cow, though. Actually, I probably was, too. Crabbe and Goyle were horrendous. I have it on good authority that Goyle decided not to return because he didn’t want to see what we would do to him after we found out he may have had a little too much fun being the Carrow’s sidekick.”
Ron, I deeply apologize for making you my target as well. Not only was I horrid, but classist and rude. In simple truth, you are not worth less for the quality of your clothing or the number of siblings you have (I can admit this was a sore point for me. I always wanted a sibling growing up). I had no reason to attack you except that it made me feel powerful, which is utterly wrong and inappropriate. I have no desire to do this to people anymore – not to mention no desire to act as my father did toward your father anymore. If you are amenable, I would be more than happy to see no more negativity between the Weasley and Malfoy families. Of course, this is a lot to ask if you have even read this for, but please know that I will never again treat another the way I have treated you.
After breakfast, he asked to talk to Sirius about what he had experienced that night. How he was a snake, how he had wanted to attack Dumbledore. Unfortunately, it didn’t help that much and Harry was left feeling like a freak.
Draco sighed wistfully. “Not this summer, Sweetheart. I want to live with you as soon as we graduate, though.”
Harry felt some of the tension in his shoulders release, and he wrote a quick note before he apparated straight to his bedroom.
A slightly awkward pause went by while Ginny looked to Harry, then grinned widely. “How would you like to sit with us?”
“Turn it around,” Harry said, after Draco stared at the front of it with a smile for a long moment. Despite the smile, he was hoping Draco liked it. Draco did so, and snorted. On the back read, “Harry and Draco Est. 1993,” outlined in a heart. Draco looked up over the shirt at him and promptly began removing his vest.
, his own mind betrayed him. His false plans he knew would fail would not work, but his main one, to get her out, had promise. Not much, and what was there was waning, but it was all he had.
“A long time. I had a crush on boys and girls at my grade school, so it wasn’t that hard to figure out once I realized there was a reason for it.”
Harry was enjoying the moment, the closeness, but as he looked away from Draco’s intense eyes, he caught sight of his watch. He couldn’t hide the wince. “What?” Draco asked, looking down.
Draco pulled back after a couple minutes. “I’m going to go take a shower. It’s going to take me a while to get ready, so entertain yourself for a bit, alright?”
Mr. Fortescue seemed to have calmed down considerably by the time he was done speaking. “Is that so.”
The manager looked uncomfortable, trying to balance looking at Draco and avoiding him. “Sir, I am tolerant of whatever lifestyle you may have, but this is a family restaurant and we have had complaints—”
Despite himself, he snorted and started laughing. “What am I going to do?” He said more soberly. Draco pulled him into a hug. He knew he was being a bit silly. He was lucky to have a problem such as this.
They met in the living room, and Harry reached out to take Sirius’s arm, but Sirius grinned and shook him off. “I can’t wait, you’ve got to see your present.” Harry blushed and stammered, still unused to getting presents, but Sirius led him into the garage. Draco followed, grinning.
“Harry.” Draco moved so that they were facing each other, and he reached out to take his hand. “I think we formed a Soul Bond.” Harry blinked.
“…My father, he…” Draco cleared his throat. “He made it very clear that any sort of friendship would not be tolerated. I argued at first, and refused to sever ties, and threw tantrums. I wasn’t used to not getting my way. Father quickly became angry, I’ve never seen him like that and…” This time, Harry could tell he didn’t just need time.
Draco tossed Harry a small smile. “He’s right, I’m not my father. I am very sorry for what he did to you and your family, especially your sister. It was very wrong. What’s more, what I have said and done to you over the years has been deplorable. There is no real excuse, but I did have reasons. Would you like to hear them?”
Hermione slapped her forehead. “Oh, my, I’m so stupid!” She made her grand exit. Ron and Harry shared fond but exasperated looks. They followed her at a more sedate pace.
“Harry!” A voice called out from further down the train. It was Tonks, standing near the exit, waving him over. They both jumped and rolled as the train left. Tonks was sporting the short brown hair that she had at Harry’s party and was rather depressed. Harry tried to get her to talk, but she wasn’t very forthcoming. She did heal his nose, however.
“I—” Draco whispered, and he looked completely awed. “Last night, I was so scared… We heard that you were missing, and Sirius Black, and some of them were saying you probably got killed, and I realized how much you mean to me, and how I might never get the chance to tell you how I feel. And when I saw you, I’ve never been so happy to see anyone. And I just knew I couldn’t wait anymore. Harry, I like you a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Will you…be my boyfriend?”
“Draco…I…I don’t…” He couldn’t string two thoughts together, much less come up with something to say. Just then, Draco’s face came closer to him. He was still cupping Harry’s face, meeting his eyes head on. He gave him plenty of time to back away, but Harry didn’t move an inch. There was thick tension in the air, but Draco was an embodiment of calm. He really was so sweet.
They all wanted to know about Draco, were they dating, how long had they been dating, why hadn’t they gone to the Yule Ball together, how had they started dating, why was Draco his hostage, since when had he been gay, did he want to be gay with someone else, why hadn’t they told anyone, why were they kissing, didn’t Harry know Draco was a Slytherin, why were they together, had Draco used a love potion on him, was Harry crazy?
“I liked when Hercules went into the river of death, and Hades thought he was going to die, but he didn’t, and then he stepped onto the cliff thing, and punched Hades in the face.”
Draco took it, but quickly asked, “Are we apparating? Mr. Potter, I happen to know you do not have your license.”
Still gasping, he crept away, crawling through the bushes. He had promised Draco some months ago that if he felt unsafe, he would leave, and he definitely felt in danger right now.
They would be going back tomorrow for last minute deliberations and sentencing, if there was any. Harry couldn’t bear the thought of that happening.
“Yes,” they said together, and Sarah looked stunned. Harry turned to look at Draco, trying to decide what to do. The situation was quickly becoming uncomfortable as the girl stared at them.
Seeing Draco like that, made Harry realize that he saw something in him he hadn’t recognized before. Himself. He couldn’t quite put the epiphany into words, but he found himself needing Draco in his life. He didn’t know why, just that he did.
Sirius sighed again, this time in sadness. “Well, he’s unconscious. Looks like he might have a concussion, been exposed to the cruciatus, has a couple bad cuts, and looks like he’s been beaten. Definitely not pretty. Do you know what happened?” Harry and Draco exchanged guilty glances.
He ducked, and it flew over his head, hitting a Death Eater in the distance. Voldemort was still screaming, still throwing curses, they were heading straight to Harry, and he didn’t have his wand. He dodged all of them, but that last one, whatever it was, headed at him, and there was no escape. He was going to die.
Sirius asked if they were hungry when they passed one of the in-park restaurants, but Harry and Draco were in agreement that they wanted to go on more rides. Sirius muttered that it was probably a good thing since they were obsessed with roller coasters, but they were already trying to find the next one.
Sirius hugged him for much longer than he ever had, Harry even began feeling awkward. Still, he remembered that there had been a time when no one wanted to hug him, so he wasn’t about to take any hug for granted.
“Is there anything I need to know about the difference between muggle and wizarding restaurants?” Draco asked.
“I think it was Snape.” Harry said, looking up from the letter. It read like someone who was trying to hide their snarkiness and identity but hadn’t quite managed it.
He couldn’t help the little goodbye kiss he gave Harry’s thin cheek, though he didn’t stick around to see his reaction. If Harry had a problem, he’d probably say something, and if he liked it, he’d probably encourage him.
He rounded the table and pulled Harry into a hug. Harry embraced him in relief. Draco continued pouring each of them a glass to give them a moment, eyes downcast.
Harry shook his head. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s a really depressing play, not to mention a muggle one, I’m surprised you’ve seen it.”
“It’s our room,” he called after Draco, who only glanced back at him with a sexy smile. He watched him move down the hall until he disappeared behind the corner. Sirius was smiling at him, almost sadly, a strange look in his eye.
“Yes.” She appeared a little startled. Harry wasn’t sure if it was him knowing who she was, or his appearance. “I just wanted to come by and say hi. So, I’m saying hi. Anyway, I’ll see you around, Harry.”
They walked up to each other and stood about a foot apart, neither knowing where to start. It was awkward, they hadn’t been alone since Draco’s teary confession.
Draco smirked, eyes glittering. “I told Mother I would prefer to do my school shopping with some school friends this year. She was initially hesitant, due to Black being on the loose, but Father seemed rather happy with the idea. They also gave me permission to stay at a friend’s, if that’s something you would like.”
“No.” Harry admitted, sitting down again. He really thought that this was the right thing to do, but Draco brought up some good points, and his plan would allow them to be together. That was selfish, whatever Draco said.
Ron guffawed, Hermione tried to fight a smile, but she ended up giggling. “Mrs. Weasley usually doesn’t want him doing magic for everything, but I think she threw that rule out the window today. Speaking of which, Harry, she’s been keeping us
He waited, but neither of his friends responded, so he apparated away into his living room. “Harry!” Sirius and Draco both jumped up, offering hugs, Draco got two.
“I couldn’t, what makes you think you can?” Harry gave him a wry look. “Alright, I guess it’s as good an idea as any.” They dressed, exited the room and called forth the room of lost things. Harry gaped at the mountains of possessions.
Draco looked contrite for the first time. “I knew she wouldn’t really know what it means, but did you hear what she said to me? I got angry. I had to do something, and it just slipped out.”
“Oh, Betty I had almost forgotten about that. So darling. James and Lily. Oh, I am so happy you survived what happened. I heard you did, but we never saw you again. Where did you go to live, Dear?”
“I don’t really know what the most important thing is, but I think the most important thing I want to tell you is about Sirius Black. You know who he is, right?”
Since he had returned from the Manor, Draco had been on his back, hands folded over his chest, but this morning he had been on his side, arms and legs tangled with Harry’s! He had moved during the night! That had to be a good thing, didn’t it?
Several of the female students looked disappointed, Cho and Ginny among them, but they were the odd ones out. Most were smiling and nodding at them. Zacharias rolled his eyes, but he was standing off to the side alone. The Weasley twins were standing back to back, and without looking at each other, gave Harry the thumbs up.
“OH NO YOUU DON’T, LADDIE!” Moody bellowed, and the white ferret zoomed back to the center of the large ring the crowd formed. “Did he get you?”
Harry was furious. He had to get out of there. Draco would be in the hospital wing, and he wasn’t exactly happy with him either. He was worried, as he didn’t look too good with bruises all over his face, but he couldn’t let go of that little bit of anger. They were supposed to trade insults, grab each other, then be pulled apart before things could get too serious. If they had to, they had practiced making slaps look real as the other would turn his head.
Again, he relaxed and let Draco continue with his ministrations. Draco moved his arm to rub them up and down Harry’s. Harry enjoyed that too, and whispered, “that’s nice.”
“I’ll stay under the cloak and set an alarm for early. No one will ever know I’m here, other than your godfather.”
Harry covered his mouth with his hand to prevent his laughter from escaping too loudly. After several years, he finally understood Draco’s humor. He constantly made nicknames, made derogatory remarks, generally poking fun at anyone and everyone. But it all was done in good fun, if it had been a friend saying what Draco said, it would be counted as general teasing. Draco was simply snarky and sarcastic, and Harry found it charming rather than hostile as he had his first year.
The adults seemed to be arguing about the authenticity of the document. Harry turned back as the word “arrest” was thrown about. He swallowed. He was expecting to be expelled, but arrested? Draco tensed behind him and squeezed his hand.
Harry waved at her, he had the quidditch cup in hand, and was passing it among other members of the team. She had hung back a little, finalizing her plan, so she would be the last one to hold the cup. Ginny thought about doing it later, but now was the perfect time, the best time, here in front of all their friends, to really start her relationship. Their relationship, she meant.
“Every single person in this room lost someone – whether it was a parent, a sibling, or a friend. Every single student in this room lost part of their childhood to He Who Must Not be Named. Many of you,” she nodded towards the Slytherin table as she spoke, “lost your faith in Hogwarts, and the people here who should have protected you.”
“You’re expected in the Great Hall for lunch in an hour where I will provide you more instructions for your first week here and what to expect upon the arrival of the rest of the Hogwarts students. Until then, you’ll find your room assignments posted on the far wall. I will not hear any arguments or requests to switch rooms, these are final.” With a final look at all of them, she spun with a swish of her robes and departed down the corridor.
“Your trunks have been sent ahead to your rooms, as I am sure you are all aware,” she began. “Since you are all here, I will show you to the eighth year common rooms.” A mumble of surprise went up from the group, but she quelled it with a look. “Hogwarts will not be a pleasant place for most returning this year, you all are expected to be supporting the younger years in their transition back into the castle. We have made the decision to keep the eighth years from having ties to any particular houses.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, albeit begrudgngly. He had always liked Neville, generally, but it seemed a deliberate slight that he was offering Harry help after having already stood around to watch Zacharias and his friends pull wands on him. And it didn’t escape Harry’s notice that while Neville clearly thought Harry was deserving of help, the thought did not extend to the people around him.
“Thanks,” he rolled his eyes. Tucking the parchment and quill into his pocket, he allowed her to lead him into the Common Room and into the corridor, the entryway grinding closed behind them.
The two Gryffindors scrambled towards the door. In other circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the display, so cowardly for people who were considered so brave, but he just sagged down in relief as they left. Blaise moved, coming to sit beside him on Harry’s bed.
That was, perhaps, an understatement. But Harry kept that thought to himself, at least. “Did something happen?” He asked instead.
“What is it?” Harry asked. Neville made a vague gesture at Draco, Blaise and Pansy, but Harry shook his head. “They stay.”
but as Draco dropped to his knees all coherent thought left Harry’s mind. In mere moments it was all he could do to stay on his feet, and if it weren’t for both his hands bracing on Draco’s shoulders he would have collapsed. His panting was cut off by a frustrated groan when Draco stood suddenly.
“Harry?” he looked up, startled, realizing he had been lost in thought for a few minutes and merely pushing his food around on his plate. Andromeda looked concerned, and Draco looked as though he was avoiding eye contact. “You’ll be alright, you know,” she said softly to him.
“Your room,” Harry groaned, mustering every ounce of self control to let go of Draco’s wrists and prop himself up slightly. “Let’s go there.”
“I hope it wasn’t in bed with you,” Harry responded jokingly. He felt more than a little forced, and it must have shown because Mar frowned at him in clear confusion.
“Not over the summer,” Harry said with a sigh. He tried not to let his mind wander back to the summer, it would do no good for anybody.
Andromeda tsked. She and Harry had discussed Draco and Narcissa’s situation at length many times, and he knew she didn’t approve of the treatment of her sister or her nephew. “A complete shame they’re keeping you separate,” she said, lips pursed. “As if you’d be a threat.” He saw Draco give her a small smile. “If you need anything, you write me. Understand?”
As far as Harry knew, he hadn’t visited his mother yet. Harry wasn’t sure if it was because he didn’t want to see her, didn’t want to visit the Manor where she was under house arrest, or was wary about the Aurors they had posted at the Manor every hour of the day to ensure she was complying. He hadn’t asked, and Draco hadn’t volunteered any information.
“Its good to see you taking your House Guardian duties so seriously,” she said with a bemused sort of smile at the four of them.
“I have to go send a letter to Andromeda,” Harry responded. “But I’ll see you after my meeting with McGonagall.”
“Andromeda-” he began, intending to point out how Andromeda had succesfully rescued herself, ended up on the right side, hadn’t hurt a single soul to do it.
McGonagall paused for a moment, and Harry felt the weight of it – it was a pause that held the weight of a war; perhaps the weight of two wars, the weight of the pain endured by everyone who was present here, and everyone who wasn’t present in the world any longer.
“Ron misses you,” she said angrily, as if it were somehow his fault. “And he thinks we should make up with you but you don’t - neither of you-” she let out another great gasping sob. A pit of guilt sunk in Harry’s stomach.
“Library or common room?” Pansy asked. Harry hoped it wasn’t the library – if he had to spend any more time in there his brain would start leaking out his ears, he was sure.
This was the aftermath, he realized, of a group of children left to fend for themselves. This was the aftermath of having only the older Slytherins left to protect them. The aftermath of the people who were supposed to protect them leaving them to fend for themselves. Harry was sure there was more than just this, too – more than the visible results of experiencing a war in their own school. There would be nightmares and panic, walking through the halls and seeing the ghosts of their friends – the Slytherin students would experience it just as severely as any other students.
Harry took a deep breath too. “Ok, but it’s not pretty.” He warned and lifted his shirt. Sirius gasped.
He patted the last bandage lightly before looking up at Draco. He smiled angelically and asked for help sitting up. Harry arranged an army of pillows behind him, conjuring more than was necessary, then hugged Draco into a sitting position. “Ok, now help me up,” Draco demanded. Harry laughed as he lifted Draco to his feet.
Draco snorted. “Your family is ancient, Harry. There’s no way they don’t have a vaultful of heirlooms.” Harry hummed quietly, thinking about why he didn’t know about this. “Anyway, you wouldn’t have had anything to talk to your manager about, so you wouldn’t need to. We can go on your birthday, or afterwards, and you can see it.” Harry nodded. “Do you want to wait for me in the lobby, or do some more shopping?”
“Uh-huh. Yeah.” Harry felt drunk. He knew that this was a bad idea, but his hands were acting of their own mind, gripping the sharp lines of Draco’s hips then slowly traveling up Draco’s chest.
He was cold. The couple of times he had slept with Harry, the boy had kept him warm throughout the night. That was strange. He was also laying on something hard. He wasn’t in bed with Harry. His brain felt fuzzy and slow. Nothing was making sense. Had he gotten up in the middle of the night? He couldn’t remember anything. What had happened?
Draco slowed the kisses down, pulling away to rest his forehead against Harry. “Let’s go.” He said quietly. “Go say goodbye to Hedwig, Leo and Sirius, I’ll meet you in the living room in a sec.”
“Harry, I have never heard of that happening. It’s incredibly irresponsible, considering the Heir would be able to take from the Family Vault and it would be exceedingly difficult for the Head of the Family to stop it without closing the account completely… but…” He hesitated, giving Harry a pained look. “It would make sense if the Head of the Family thought something would happen to them and wanted the Heir to have unlimited access to the full fortune.”
“Mother, I promise, I have things under control! I’m about to make another attempt on Dumbledore’s life! I have—!”
Draco glanced in his direction for a second before doing a double take. Their eyes met, Draco’s widened and his mouth opened. “Pomfrey said you weren’t going to wake up yet!”
Also, that thing where random chunks of the story just don't appear is still going on, so if you see anything missing, please let me know.
Draco blushed. “Please don’t repeat anything I said to anyone. I’d be mortified if he found out, and I don’t want to make him uncomfortable. I can trust you as a friend, can’t I?”
“It was alright. I got it done while I was waiting.” That was about as much input as he put in without Draco’s nudging. “How was your summer?”
“Well I’m gay, for the record.” Draco drawled, sitting back, his eyes shining bright, taking Harry’s hand.
Madam Pomfrey took Dumbledore by the arm out of Draco’s earshot, not that he cared to hear what they had to say. He was too busy speaking quietly to Harry. He didn’t care if Harry really could hear him or not, he just wanted Harry to be alright.
“Harry!” A voice called out from further down the train. It was Tonks, standing near the exit, waving him over. They both jumped and rolled as the train left. Tonks was sporting the short brown hair that she had at Harry’s party and was rather depressed. Harry tried to get her to talk, but she wasn’t very forthcoming. She did heal his nose, however.
Draco turned the rest of the way over, “I didn’t want to sleep in our bed alone.” Harry brought his fingers down to trace Draco’s face. “I mean, I tried for a bit, but it felt so uncomfortable. I hated our fight.”
“Oh.” Hermione said, eyebrows furrowed. “Oh. Ok, Harry.” After that, she became very giggly whenever Harry said he was going for a walk or to go study. Harry didn’t understand it at all.
“Don’t take it personally. Sirius told me that the crazy hair runs in my family. My grandfather tried to invent a hair potion, but even that didn’t work. It did work on everyone else, and that’s where the Potter fortune came from.”
Breaking their hold on each other, Harry moved his hands up to cup Draco’s face and kissed him. It was light, innocent, sweet, lasted only a moment, but there were further gasps that almost covered the start of the music beginning to play. They stared at each other for only a moment before they got back into position and started dancing a couple seconds after the other champions.
After what felt like hours, he went down to the Common Room and found Ron and Hermione sitting in front of the fireplace, presents all around them. Seeing them there, having obviously waited for him to wake up, lightened his heart enough that he made a considerable effort to play nice and slapped a smile on his face.
Harry finally pulled back and Draco began trailing kisses down his neck. He was feeling a bit panicked, but he felt like he had it under control. He just needed a second to breath and fill his lungs with air. Once he was able to get his anxiety under control, he pushed Draco back, so he was mostly on top of Draco and kissed his lips, then neck. Draco gave out little sighs that encouraged him forward.
Diggory was dealing with a centaur, who wanted to talk to him about Venus, and Diggory was too polite to tell him to stuff it. He was slowly inching away, nodding seriously, as the centaur droned on.
Draco hummed in thought. “I just want to be held by you. For a while. Then, I want to do spa day again. I think my mother would like that.” Harry nodded and kissed his head. They repositioned so Draco was in front of Harry, his back to Harry’s chest.
Humiliation burned in his eyes as he nevertheless breathed in Draco’s pattern. It was several minutes later that he finally calmed down. He had been placed on the sink by Draco, whose forehead was now resting against his own. He could not be more embarrassed.
“I’m glad you didn’t.” Draco said. “Gave us plenty of time to make sure it’s exactly what we want. There’s no rush, is there?”
Hermione stared him down, eyes narrowed before she drew herself up. “I’ll be frank, since that’s what you obviously prefer. We’re concerned, Harry. You’re receiving suspicious owls, chocolates I’m not entirely sure you did order as you claimed, and you’ve been mysteriously absent where no one can find you. You have to admit, we have cause to be concerned. If you’re in some kind of trouble, we only want to help you.”
He looked back at Draco, who was assessing the room. “I agree. This space does have potential to be a nice room. Maybe we could even decorate. But I don’t know many cleaning charms. I only know the dusting one because some of the older books I’ve read don’t have the preservation charms on them and haven’t been read in a while. Here, I’ll show you that one.”
However, one of the Slytherins, a tall boy with dark skin, got a little too close to Harry and his cloak slipped past his face. “It’s Potter!”
Seconds later, Harry’s lips were attacked by the sweetest mouth he had ever tasted. Not that he knew what other people’s mouths tasted like, but he couldn’t imagine something sweeter than Draco. Even his saliva tasted better than honey.
“Oh. How is Sally-Anne by the way?” Hermione asked slowly, watching Harry intently. Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco felt like he might start floating. He wasn’t sure what to do, what Harry wanted. Was he just returning the gesture? Were they showing friendly affection? He wondered if Harry was trying to signal that he wanted to be with Draco. He almost kissed his lips right then, but something was still holding him back. What was it?
“You should apologize! Just let them eat, you’re ruining our dinner too,” a lady in a deep blue dress and up-do said to the manager. She glared at the two offenders, and the man she was with nodded, sending sympathetic looks to Harry and Draco.
“Us? We didn’t do nothing to her. The Dark Lord, on the other hand…” Mr. Goyle trailed off quietly and suggestively.
Draco kissed the side of his neck then rested his head against Harry’s. “He does approve. I know he does. Maybe he just thinks we’re too young or something. Whatever it is, it’s not your concern.”
The drapes were closed around their bed, they had learned that lesson quick, but without the light he couldn’t see Draco at all. His head was pounding, his body felt achy, and he couldn’t remember a thing from the night before.
Draco sighed. The woman turned to look at Harry, winced, and looked back down at their table. “Oh, I’m alright. Just gave me a bit of a fright. You look so much like James Potter. But you have no idea who that is—”
An hour before they made it back to the station, Draco entered the cabin. “You’re dead, Potter.” He said, and Harry had a hard time not snorting or laughing.
They both chose beds away from Draco, who was lying still at the end of the ward. Harry ached with a want to go see him.
They made their way back up to Harry’s room with Draco under the cloak and settled on the bed. Draco had bought croissants and pastries and they were delicious. Harry moaned slightly as he bit into a Viennoiserie as Draco pronounced in flawless French. Harry tried and botched it so badly Draco laughed.
“Very well. I volunteered to give this to you, since you were found so quickly.” She handed Sirius a piece of parchment with a smile.
He was upset, and worried, and a part of him wanted to just stay down, where Draco couldn’t get upset. He really didn’t know what would happen when they surfaced. Harry did know that Draco wanted him to win, so he couldn’t stay there for much longer. He took a deep breath and began cutting away at the ropes holding Draco in place. He was relieved that Draco had worked out that the champions had to save a live hostage. He still wanted to grab the other hostages, but he was even more worried about Draco.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice cracked as well. It was rather fitting. He took as long as Draco had done to get all the words out, choking on his tears. “I take thee, Draconis Lucius Malfoy, to be my husband. In sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, in good times and in bad, through thickness and through thin, forsaking all others. I pledge my very magic on my promise to be true to you and only you. So mote it be.”
Harry sighed as he read the longest message Draco had sent him that summer. It did help calm him down, he needed to hear the ‘I love you’ in particular. His curiosity was piqued over his gift, or gifts. What could Draco have gotten him that he wouldn’t like?
He spent the rest of the day and days following getting acquainted with the magical street until he had it memorized. He would spend afternoons getting free ice cream and advice about his homework from Florean Fortescue. It was as he was walking out of the Leaky into the street one morning that he felt a pull on his arm and suddenly he was in a hidden crevice in the wall. He would have screamed if there wasn’t a hand over his mouth.
Several voices started talking at once, and McGonagall held up her hands. “Mr. Malfoy,” she decided on, “you seem to be at the center of this, what are you doing over here?”
The cool air rushing by his face was exactly what Harry needed. Draco’s arms were wrapped tightly around his waist, his head rested against Harry’s back. He had put a silencing charm around the bike so it didn’t roar into the still night. Harry let his thoughts drift, only half paying attention to where they were going, not worried about getting lost.
Draco’s fingers buried themselves in his hair, hanging on for the ride. “Harry…please.” He moaned. Harry wasn’t sure what he was begging for, but he sped up in case that was it. Draco’s much louder moan answered his question. The angle from the side wore out his jaw, so he climbed up on the table, sitting between Draco’s legs and taking him in that way.
“Are you kidding? I’ve been waiting years for this! How do you think we should do it?” They spent the rest of their time together coming up with ideas for announcing their relationship. Some were short and sweet, some were outlandish, some ridiculous, but Harry realized he didn’t care. Things were finally looking up.
“What’s that?” Harry blinked, then wondered if that was something that wizards even do, he couldn’t remember many, there was Grubbly-Plank, and Finch-Fletchley, but they very well could both be muggle names.
“Alright,” Harry said quietly. They flew a couple laps around the pitch, dancing around each other in the air.
“I think all of your suggestion’s have merit. I do quite like the idea of… Hope's Army. I thought the name up several years ago and never got the chance to use it."
“I bet you enjoyed that. How did you meet, anyway?” Harry grabbed the handle of the frying pan and shook it back and forth to make sure it was slick enough before flipping it. The pancake landed smack in the middle of the pan and Harry smiled. That was his favorite part of cooking pancakes, flipping them without a spatula; it had taken him several times and subsequent punishments to get the hang of it.
“Why don’t you talk to him, Harry?” Mr. Weasley said. “If you can put aside your differences, he might very well listen to you. If something is going on, he’s much more likely to talk to a peer than someone in an Order he sees against him.”
Harry did so, and continued unwrapping. He used his method but did pick it up a bit. They did have a party to get to.
When Sirius did finally come back in, he declared he was going to get some ice cream. Several voices told him this wasn’t a good idea, that he should wait until tomorrow, when news of him not being a criminal had spread. Sirius, however, laughed and said it would be alright.
“This is brilliant! That’s the main reason gay marriage isn’t done, but if the muggles have come up with a way to make it happen…! Harry, do you realize what this means? I can have an heir, with you! The Malfoy name will live on and be recognized by my family’s magic! I didn’t think this was possible! Oh, Harry!” He jumped on Harry and kissed him enthusiastically.
Draco placed his hand on Harry’s thigh, and asked what he felt like. “I’m still not that hungry,” Harry responded. “But I could use a drink. I think I see a beer Sirius gets I like. Do you want to split an appetizer?”
“Oh, we dated for a bit at school, broke up, and then dated for a bit after school. Maybe it’s time to start back up again.” Sirius said with no embarrassment. Remus nearly knocked his bowl over.
Harry felt a touch of something at the base of his spine. He almost regretted winning, seeing the look on Draco’s face. It was mostly blank, in the typical Slytherin mask, but Harry could see the longing on it. As he felt his own face start to fall, Draco blinked, and gave him a wide, beaming smile. It lit up his whole face, making him look more ethereal, like an angel. He was Harry’s angel.
Harry’s jaw dropped. “I would love that.” He whispered, reaching up to pull Draco’s crossed arms apart so he could hold Draco’s hand. He straightened and stood in front of him, feet planting on either side of Draco’s. Harry ended up taking both hands in his as he stared at Draco in awe. “Thank you.” No one had ever understood anyone as well as Draco understood Harry. Except, maybe how well Harry understood Draco.
Harry found himself smiling back, head tilted sideways, letting Draco see for a moment how he loved him. He knew people saw him when he got a few raised eyebrows, but most were too involved with celebrating the win to notice what he was doing.
“Good. I want to know if you are feeling anxiety at any point, no matter what we’re doing. If you ever want to stop anything we’re doing, we stop, all you have to do is say the word. You are in complete control, and I don’t want you to forget that. Agreed?”
Inside were various utensils for various things. She picked up the antique mirror and held it up, admiring her face once again before looking around suspiciously. Seeing there was still no one there, she pulled on the handle, revealing a long, thin, jewel-encrusted, silver knife.
He felt the bed dip as Draco sat after taking his potion, and he opened his eyes after a moment of Draco not saying anything. Sitting on the bed to his side were 3 presents. He found a grin and a rush of pleasure. It still surprised him when he received presents. “Are these for me?” He asked; Draco rolled his eyes.
“Does it matter? I think this proves I’m not in the safest place?” Mrs. Weasley was tearing up, covering her mouth with her hands, as were Ginny and Hermione. Everyone else was staring at him, gaping.
Draco slowly became Malfoy in his head. He wasn’t even sure when it had happened. After each time he saw fit to torment Harry, he felt his heart harden. He was sure that he would be able to get over it quicker if it wasn’t for the look of pain that sometimes crossed his face, and that he was sure was a near-permanent fixture in his eyes.
He pulled back against Draco’s low whine of protest. “Don’t you want your present?” Draco deflated, the first time he ever had when presents were mentioned. “What’s wrong?”
“I had no idea he was so loyal.” Harry said as he took his own seat, warming his hands on his tea mug. At Draco’s unbelieving raised eyebrows, Harry corrected, “to us, I mean.” Draco nodded and took a sip from his tea.
There was a mad run to the door. Harry was the last one out the door, not willing to leave anyone behind.
“They, er, were supposed to, but they didn’t handle my being friends with Draco very well. I didn’t even get a chance to tell them we were engaged at the time. Oh,” a dangerous thought entered his head. “Have they told anyone? About Draco?” Panic entered the Bond from the both of them.
Draco nodded, and began unbuttoning Harry’s shirt. “I promise.” He told Harry and pushed him backwards. “I love you so much,” He ripped Harry’s shirt off, tearing it slightly. Harry didn’t give a single fuck.
“I love you so much Harry,” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck, tightening his hold. Harry felt something wet and thought it might be a kiss. They stood there quietly, gently swaying, for a long time, then Draco quickly kissed him, was saying a goodbye, and was out the door, almost as suddenly as he had entered. Harry stared after him, confused. He knew something was wrong, and he wanted to know what.
Sixth Year is going to be hard, and definitely darker, but I hope I have written an original and likeable tale that does the original story justice. I think you can tell from that last bit in the chapter that things from here on out will not follow the plot as closely, seventh year I’m planning on being completely different. As for Draco, he is in for some hard times, his canon ark will be different, but he has Harry and we know those two can handle anything together. Who else was cheering him on when Harry tried to break up with him? I know I was! I know it’s a different reaction than Ginny had, but in my opinion, one reaction doesn’t make either of them more fitting for Harry, it’s just that it fits with a different part to his personality. I’ve kept Draco as in character as possible, at least how I see him, and I don’t think he’d ever let go of Harry. At least we’ve got that out of the way.
Is that what they were doing, living together? They shared a room, a bed, a house? Sure, there was another person living there as well, but Harry considered that he lived with Sirius. He supposed it all depended on whether or not Draco was planning on leaving. He should probably ask him. Draco had said he wanted to live with Harry after they graduated, but there was every chance he had changed his mind, or wasn’t ready, after all, they hadn’t graduated.
He allowed a small sob to escaped him, suddenly glad he was alone. He didn’t understand how everything had gone to hell, and so quickly. Everything had seemed fine at the end of last year, then just as quickly as they had seemed heavenly, they went to hell. He couldn’t imagine how they could be any worse.
His first reaction was anger and betrayal. He didn’t like what he had just heard. He also felt shamed, not ashamed, but as if they were trying to make him feel badly, even though they hadn’t known he walked up when they were talking. He didn’t consider it eavesdropping, because he hadn’t tried to listen, just heard what they were saying in Sirius’s house.
He bought several books on healing for Draco and himself, focusing on healing cuts and curses. He shrunk them and put on a feather-light charm on the bag to make carrying easier. He purchased the ingredients they would need at the apothecary.
They cuddled up and traded a couple kisses, enjoying their mixed tastes as usual. “I won.” Draco told him.
Year 7: (at time of posting) 14,164. Eh, I’ve only been on it four days, and it's one narrative day, this one is going to be looong.
The professor shook his head. “You must go to classes, Ms. Granger. I will see you after they are finished for the day.” Hermione bit her lip but looked once more at Harry before sniffling and nodding. Ron’s arm was around her shoulder as they left together."
“Yes, well, I had heard rumors. Um, where are you going?” He asked, trying to change the subject, apparently.
“Harry,” Hermione started, and Harry was startled to see tears in her eyes. The room quieted as McGonagall marched up to him.
Sirius held up his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry, Kiddo, I didn’t mean anything by it. When did you get together?”
“Sorry, I haven’t even looked at the menu,” Harry apologized. Picking it up from where it had rested on his plate.
These will be copy-and-paste excerpts of what I have so far, then, I'll do an indication that I'm making things up so you know those parts will be more likely to change.
“I thought today might be a good day, it was my idea, not Sirius’s.” Draco took up the end of the sentence. “If I was wrong, all you have to do is say so, and we can come back another time, if you want to.”
His heart was hammering in his ears, Draco’s arms were around him, his tongue down his throat. He pulled back, unable to resist a couple quick pecks. He settled his hands on Draco’s hips, Draco’s hands coming down to cup the back of his head. They were finally the same height and their foreheads rested against each other perfectly.
“Are you both excited about today?” Sirius asked, pulling them out of the staring contest they had entered. Harry shook his head to clear it of the Draco fog.
He found the sixth-year boys’ dorm easily enough; the sign was a pretty big hint. He packed Draco’s belongings carefully, making sure to fold everything neatly. Finally, he was done, and floating the trunk ahead of him.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Baby, I love you, too.” Draco rolled his eyes at the name but leaned forward to kiss Harry again.
“You know, I’m not really into the dating and strings thing either. If you ever wanted, you and I could hook up.” Harry choked on his mouthful. None of the boys had been that forward with him.
“My parents were awful,” Sirius told him much later. They had moved over to the couch, and Harry had his head on Sirius’s shoulder. “They were negligent. My mother was alright when I was a child, compared to when I was a teenager. She mostly used words. My father, on the other hand, he would hit me on occasion. It wasn’t often, and it was always a punishment. That doesn’t make it right, mind, but I never really considered it to be abuse. It was normal to me, parents punish their children and that’s just the way things are. It took me leaving, I stayed at your dad’s place when I was sixteen, and seeing him with his parents to understand that how my parents treated me wasn’t normal or ok. Once I was out of this house, I felt so free,” he looked around wistfully.
“You are so beautiful to me,” Harry said into Draco’s shoulder. Draco hugged him tighter. “You are the most beautiful person I have ever seen, by so far. I can’t even put it into words. I love you so much, Draco.”
Sirius refused to clean up the mountain of wrapping paper in the living room, instead rushing Harry outside. “I don’t know that this is a good idea.” Harry said doubtfully as he sat on his new bike.
The war and Hunt have begun. Harry dealt with nightmares, leaving Ron and Hermione to seek comfort from Draco.
Harry felt his hope, that had risen after hearing about the arrest, plummet. He bit his lip as he turned to look at Draco again. He, of course, hadn’t reacted to the news. Harry loosened the grip on his hand, hoping he hadn’t hurt him when he had squeezed so hard. He had really thought he would get Draco back soon. He wasn’t sure what he was going to do without him.
“If you decide to become an auror or join a mysterious organization that fights Voldemort, then you can focus on taking them down.” There are several snorts and rolled eyes. “What?”
Albus was very, very old. Not very many things surprised him anymore, and it had been quite a long time since he had a shock of this magnitude. Why, the last time he had been surprised had involved these two as well.
“…I am still angry.” Harry said quietly. “Give me some time and some space and I’ll think about it.” At the moment, that was the best he could do. They nodded, smiling softly and left him to it.
“We don’t want Voldemort dictating what we do. We want to get married, and we will.” Draco said, pulling Harry closer.
“This sounds a little strange, considering… well, happy birthday, Kiddo.” Harry nodded, and Sirius managed a sincere but shaking smile before he apparated away.
If he lived through this, he would stop his ways. He knew the things he did were bad, some of them, at least. He wanted to change that, if he got another chance, that was exactly what he would do.
“Yes. I did. And I’m not going to apologize for it if it keeps you alive.” They glared at each other, still standing close and breathing harshly.
Draco laid there still. The spell couldn’t force the body to do things like fall asleep, but it came close. He could lie there, not thinking about anything in particular.
“Yeah,” George said, and they walked in silence. “He insulted your mum too, Harry. Why didn’t you hit him? I gave you a shot, and instead you took me down. What gives?”
Harry sighed. “I never said I thought he was a Death Eater, I said it was weird when I saw him jump when my scar hurt. I just said I think he’s in trouble.”
Eventually they settled down and the mood became more somber. They discussed rules for their friendship and came up with several that they were both comfortable with.
There was no way in hell Draco would want to stay with him after this. He had lost Draco, just when he had gotten him back from the dead.
He ended up talking toLuna and her father, as well as Elphias Doge, who he recognized from Dumbledore’s eulogy, then Ron’s Great Aunt Muriel. Victor Krum came over, then Cedric Diggory, and when Fleur joined them, they had a reunion of the Tri-Wizard contestants.
“Of course, he was, he had just lost the match! He certainly succeeded, but that’s no excuse for fighting!”
“Granger, they’re after muggles. Do you want to show off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around… they’re moving this way. And it would give us all a laugh.” Harry could hear the underlying message, they needed to get out of here… but Harry was still confused about what was happening. Did Draco know, could he tell Harry?
It was white on top of white, and it surprised Harry. He would have thought it would be modeled like the Slytherin common room, all silver, black and green. His comforter was green, but everything else was a pristine white. It was almost too bright, and it rather hurt to look at for too long, especially in such a huge room.
“Well I do.” Then he rattled off something in French and Harry felt heat flood his face and stomach. Hearing the silky words coming from Draco’s talented mouth, he felt himself getting excited. He suddenly understood why French was known as the romance language. “Anything to say?” Draco asked, amused. Harry shook his head, and he realized his mouth was slightly open.
Hermione blinked. She glanced at Malfoy, who was glaring at her so intensely she had a feeling if looks could kill she’d be a pile of ash on the floor. She gulped. “What about earlier than recently?”
“I’m going to get some wine from the kitchen,” Draco said, when they made it back inside. Harry nodded and went to his room. He took off his shoes and started undressing. He took his shirt off and let it drop to the ground, then rolled his eyes at himself and put it in the hamper. Draco had been on him to clean up after himself. He wasn’t a slob, but he didn’t like things immaculate, he liked having a shirt slung over the back of a chair, and a book lying opened on his desk. He and Draco were still working out a compromise on how dirty their bedroom should be, but in the meantime, he could make sure his clothes were in the hamper.
“I didn’t know you could speak French; how did I not know that?” Harry asked, ignoring Sarah for the moment.
Harry nodded. He wanted to go to sleep so badly, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to. In a way, he knew he didn’t deserve the sweet oblivion.
Draco. Draco was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. It didn’t matter if he was male, female, both, or neither. He would…fancy…him regardless.
“I can do that.” Mr. Weasley finally said. “I may not be able to find who purchased what, but items sold will be simple enough.”
Draco now looked positively sick, he was leaning over his crossed arms and ever so slightly rocking himself. Harry wanted nothing more than to go over to him, comfort him, maybe take him to the hospital wing.
“A couple mont’s ago, you an’ Malfoy were sittin’ at the same table at the Three Broomsticks. We’e all been so caugh’ up in this tournament, haven’ gotten a chance ter talk to yeh. I been thinkin’ about it though. Here now, I jus’—”
“Er…what?” Harry blinked and swallowed, he had become a little passionate, but he didn’t take anything back.
“Dumbledore made it into a bit of a historical landmark. No one’s allowed inside, but you technically own it now, so the wards should recognize you if you want to go inside.” Sirius said quietly. Harry closed his eyes.
Draco shook his head. “You know me, I love surprises, and I love what you always come up with. Do you mind planning something for us?”
Harry hesitated. He wanted to ask but didn’t want to put Sirius in a bad mood. “A good relationship…” Harry started under his breath but wasn’t sure how to continue.
“Harry…” Draco said quietly. “Listen, I’m not ready to have sex, and I don’t think I will be any time soon.  I don’t want to put any pressure on you or make you think I’m waiting on you. There is no deadline and it’s not a race. I’d rather take things slow, one step at a time, at our own pace. It’ll be when we’re both ready, and not a minute sooner, do I make myself clear?”
“Get back here, you bastard!” Harry erected a shield as he made it further down the stairs. Ron’s spells clashed into his shield. It wasn’t because Ron’s aim was particularly good, but Harry had curved the shield to protect the hallways and photos on them. Harry wasn’t entirely sure what to do.
A new fountain was being built, and it did not look like it would be of the same spirit of the fountain of magical brethren. Harry winced as he took in the mangled metal being formed.
Draco shrugged. “I figured you wouldn’t want to leave with the war still going on. I was thinking we could wait to travel until the wedding ceremony, and maybe just do something special for the bonding ceremony.”
After he saw Bill and Fleur trading looks, he offered to introduce them. Bill had protested weakly while Harry ran off to grab Fleur. He was a bit surprised that Mrs. Weasley was rather sour after that, but Bill and Fleur were rather lost in each other. Maybe he was getting better at anything having to do with feelings. He had such a nice day he forgot to be scared of what he would have to do later that day.
Suddenly, he could see it written all over Harry’s face, the truth he had been unwilling to see displayed there all along. The answer to the question he had been expecting to find only in himself.
“Well, this is a most surprising and unexpected change of events.” Dumbledore commented from his seated position in his thrown-like chair. He couldn’t look less concerned if he tried. “Would anyone care for a lemon drop?”
It was a couple hours later when Draco finally entered the room again. “Hey,” Harry said, a bit distractedly when Draco greeted him. Draco chuckled and started packing again. “Do you need any help?” He asked, not looking up.
“You ok,” Draco asked as soon as they were alone. Harry nodded, and Draco scooted closer, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. It had been nice hearing that about his parents. He was offended by that last part, but he chose to focus on his father flirting with older ladies. It was a funny picture. He wondered what he had done, and told Draco to remind him to ask Sirius later.
They got quieter as they were reduced to “Do not’s” and “Do too’s” as they got closer. Breaths were held all around the room as they were silent.
“Oh, well that’s alright. We don’t get too many—” She cut herself off with a gasp as she took a good look at Harry. Harry blinked and leaned back a little. He was used to extreme reactions when people met him, but her look of horror was a bit extreme.
Draco hummed. “That is a good point, but then you wouldn’t have a go-to gift. I’m looking forward to getting a surprise present every now and then, if that’s something you’d like to do.”
Draco shook his head. “I need to go, forget you saw me, Potter!” He quickly stood from his chair, but Harry was faster. He lunged over and gripped Draco’s wrist.
“Now, now, don’t be like that, Harry. Why don’t you tell me all about your lovely girlfriend here?” Skeeter sidled up to him, grabbing his arm. Harry escaped and stepped in front of Hermione, hoping to protect her at least a little.
At the end of the day, all he cared about is having Draco with him. That was what mattered most. They would have a more traditional wedding, but he was happy with the small ceremony Draco was planning.
He grabbed the portkey he was working on and placed the homing device in the center of his bed. Hopefully, no one would move it. His hesitant plan was to get in, grab Sirius, and activate the portkey, bringing both him and his godfather back. It was similar to what had happened last year with him, Pettigrew and the Cup from the Triwizard Tournament. With any luck, Voldemort wouldn’t kill him the moment he walked into the room.
He tried to enjoy the ride, but the hand being squeezed distracted him. Thankfully, the ride wasn’t that long, and they were pulling up to the little hut where they would get off. “Are you ok,” he called to Draco, but he didn’t answer. Harry sighed internally, that was a good sign.
“I don’t know.  I think I’m getting ahead of myself, I don’t know how to start.” Draco waited patiently. “According to Dumbledore, here’s how it happened.”
“I wonder which relative it was,” Ron said as he was leaving. “It might be pretty distantly, and it’s through marriage, anyway.”
The break did come pretty quickly, and Remus quickly escorted Harry back to Grimmauld Place before taking off again. Sirius was a bundle of nerves, he asked Harry how it went several times, even after Harry had told him every detail.
“Do you mean it?” Harry asked, searching his eyes after Draco let him go. Draco nodded, meeting Harry’s eyes head on. “You really don’t blame me? I shot a spell at you when I didn’t know what it did.”
“To hex the arse off of whoever hurt you.” Harry bit out. Draco felt himself smile, warmth spreading throughout him.
He found a bathrobe and made his way out towards the deck outside. He found a space where he could lean on the wooden rails and rest his head in his hands, staring out into the most extraordinary night-time view, with the moon casting beams onto their own private lagoon.
The general consensus for the day ended up being that Harry would talk to Sirius to get more information on Regulus. Hermione had run off to get one of the books about the Black family, but it hadn’t been updated to include Regulus or Sirius.
Harry pulled the cake out, grabbed cutlery and plates, a bottle of wine, and retrieved Draco’s presents from the hollow bench in the kitchen. He floated them along in front of him, and opened their bedroom door.
Draco sniffled a small laugh and hugged Harry close. When he pulled back, he kept his arms around Harry, but moved a finger up his chest. “Harry, you remember when we went to the Prefect’s Bathroom that first time and we started talking about this?”
Happy Birthday to me! Here's my present to all of you! That's how birthdays work, right? You know what I want as presents, if you're so inclined!
“Er, yeah I guess.” He was still reeling, because when they had talked about children, and the future, it had always been in a hypothetical, very far in the future context. But he was holding something that could very well belong to his daughter one day. It made her very real.
Harry was upset that Gryffindor lost the match to Hufflepuff, even though Ginny caught the snitch. It set the tone for the next several weeks as Harry’s ecstasy after Valentine’s Day faded, though it fueled him memorably. His mood picked up when his article came out and had a whole slew of effects. Umbridge was furious and banned him from any future Hogsmeade visit, Harry was secretly pleased for the excuse. She also made it an expellable offense to have the Quibbler in possession, which ensured the whole school read it. Students were treating him like a person again, no one made fun of him. They were congratulating and praising him, which Harry didn’t love, but figured was preferable to being a pariah. The teachers all found ways of showing their support for him. Draco was a little upset that his father had been mentioned, afraid of the ramifications. Harry made it up to him until he was feeling better.
“I won’t say no to that.” He held out his hands eagerly. Harry pulled his gift out of his bag, it was wrapped a little better than his Christmas present, but not by much. Draco seemed to not care as he ripped it open.
Harry looked up to see the boy watching him carefully. “Er, no, it’s fine.” He had to force himself to recall the story he had heard just the previous night. “They were…murdered…by…er—”
Mandy noticed him the same time Harry did and left her seat to go talk to him. Harry was a bit relieved, he wasn’t that great at feelings and comforting the younger years. He calmed down as soon as Mandy started talking to him.
That was what was really bothering Harry. The little voice in the back of his head told him his fears were true, and it was all just a huge cosmic joke on him.
Harry sighed. Draco licked and sucked at his balls before putting them in his mouth, stroking his cock. After several long minutes, he switched and started sucking his cock. Harry came with a shout, it felt like Draco was sucking the cum out of his balls.
“Whatever. Why don’t you go cry about it to your pen pal? Maybe you’ll be a better friend to him than you are to me.”
Harry missed curfew by several minutes and was berated by Hermione, but he knew it was completely worth it.
“I’ll be along in a minute, I just have to check something,” Draco said to the others. He pulled the curtains down and opened his trunk and Harry sighed, getting ready to tell Draco he was there. Just as he was opening his mouth, leaning over the ledge, Draco shot up, shooting a spell in Harry’s general direction.
Draco pushed Harry to the floor, moving his robes aside to see the damage. Harry was wearing a thin t-shirt under his robes, which Draco pulled up to see the long cut along his side. Hermione appeared on Harry’s other side.
“Good,” Draco smiled when Harry removed his finger. “I wasn’t sure…Sirius told me that this is a bit of a tradition in your family to come here for at least part of a honeymoon. I wanted it to be a surprise, but maybe I should have told you…”
be ok. Still, he knew he had chosen the harder path by revealing his relationship to the world, and it went against his instincts. He just hoped he wouldn’t regret his choice too much.
“Did I just confound her?” Draco asked in amusement. “So that we could buy alcohol?” Harry nodded, and Draco looked at him adoringly. “I love you so much.” Harry blushed and looked down.
Harry sighed. “They’re hard-core Christian muggles, and they don’t like her being a witch, or gay. It was apparently too much for them.”
Harry stared at him. “Well, yeah.” He said slowly, not wanting Draco to get the wrong idea. “You mean…right now?”
“We could break it beyond repair, but that might make things worse. What will they do if they can’t fix it, or if we steal it?”
Draco looked stunned. “Not really. Maybe, honestly, I’ve looked at someone and my brain jumped to picture it. But no matter what, it’s never as good as what we have. I would never want anyone but you Harry. From what I understand, it’s a healthy thing to look on occasion. I would never betray you, but do you think it’s wrong, if my mind jumps to something without consciously thinking about it?”
He shuffled forward through an open doorway and found himself in a formal dining room. There was a dark wood table with six matching chairs with white cushions. The table had a runner as a table cloth, showing off the delicate lines of the polished wood. Each seat had a plate, bowl, and silverware laid out, as if it was just waiting for occupants to have a meal. He wondered if his parents had a formal dinner planned, or if it just always looked like that. He could see his parents, Sirius, Remus, and himself sitting at the table. Perhaps Draco would be sitting next to him or across, the first time he brought him home. There was a dresser on the wall opposite him that housed more fancy china, as well as glass figurines. The wall to his right was mostly window with beautiful white curtains that matched the table cloth runner, that showed a glimpse of the back yard.
Draco’s smile widened. “Sounds good. We’ll figure it out. Then we can have a big white wedding when the war’s over, whenever that is. I’m getting hungry, got any food?” Harry jumped up.
“I can’t believe I missed all of this!” Draco exclaimed, “I’m supposed to be the Slytherin of the two of us. I must admit, that was much more exciting than the rumors, as insane as the notion is. Though, I must admit, I’m not sure I’d want to face a basilisk, nor even an amnesiac Lockhart. I think I’ll let you do the saving. You’re much better at it.” Harry felt himself blush at the praise.
They were silent for a moment, then Sirius started leading him further into the square. A statue Harry hadn’t really taken in changed as they got closer. Harry gulped. He recognized the figures from his pictures and the one time their ghostly images had reappeared. It was his parents, and him as a baby.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I shouldn’t have ignored you. I told you I was going to spend time with you, and it was really rude of me to not pay you any attention, especially during dinner.”
Harry slowly nodded, too choked up to talk. Sirius hurried out of the room and returned minutes later.
He tried to get up at one point, but Madam Pomfrey just pushed him down again, threatening to tie him to the bed if he tried again. Ron and Hermione both told him there was nothing he could do to help Draco, and he needed to rest for longer. Harry didn’t care what happened to him, he just wanted to make sure that Draco was ok. He wanted to talk to Dumbledore.
Voldemort had been smiling in a very evil way. Now, he was demanding to know what was wrong. “The potion must be wearing off my Lord, or he is fighting it.”
“Oh, yay! I’ve been meaning to get this! Thanks, Babe!” He gave Draco a quick hug and flipped through a couple pages.
Harry startled at having to talk next. “Er, hi. I’m Harry Potter.” Pretty much everyone snickered, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, get it all out. Er, I had crushes on boys and girls in grade school, so I knew something was up, but no one else seemed to feel the way I did, until my Uncle told me that people who liked the same gender were wrong. I didn’t believe him, but it made me keep quiet about it. Then I realized it really was ok and my Uncle was just a homophobic, intolerant prick. Er, sorry, Professor.” Dumbledore shook his head, chuckling.
Harry wasn’t tired but couldn’t think of anything he would rather be doing than holding Draco close as he dreamed. “Sounds good to me. What about your massage? Can I still give you one?” Harry knew Draco was still having trouble sleeping, but Draco always seemed to sleep fine when they were together.
The day he got out of the hospital wing, a school owl delivered his cloak wrapped in thick parchment. There was no note, and Draco hadn’t visited again.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, looking closer. “It might just be the animation style they went with. This is by Disney, which is a company that first invented the style of movie-making. I’ve always wanted to see one.” He added wistfully.
Harry blushed at having been caught again. “Sorry. I guess I’m just not feeling like studying right now.”
Harry groaned, “Lazy bugger,” but got up with a smile. He placed the bag on the bed next to Draco and opened the main compartment and began pulling items out. There were lots of potion bottles, a sealed letter, several articles of clothing, a velvet box, and… “Well, who is this?” Draco blushed a dark red as Harry pulled out a stuffed silver and green dragon, worn out by time and love.
“We’re not accusing you of anything!” Hermione said quickly, and Harry felt a surge of negative emotions when he noticed her eyes tearing up. “We just don’t know what’s going on, and we need to!”
Draco gasped and covered his mouth a couple times throughout the movie. He tilted his head in confusion, and whispered to Harry how amazing this experience was. He ate the popcorn blindly, and leaned forward as if that would help him hear better.
“Oh, yeah! My father will hear about this!” Draco’s arms wrapped around his waist. “I love you, I’m going to miss you so much.”
“Mrs. Weasley, please! This isn’t about Sirius.” Harry said. Mrs. Weasley ignored him, which she had done almost exclusively all night.
“Well, to that end…can I help you become more comfortable? I have some ideas and I really think my involvement would help.”
“How do you know all this?” The conversation was turning dangerous. If he needed to, he was prepared to tell them the whole and full truth, if Draco’s life depended on it. However, he knew that Draco didn’t want them to know yet, and he wasn’t keen on the idea of it either. It could go very badly very quickly, and he didn’t need to have a major distraction when Draco was in trouble.
Then, he realized something about Draco’s letters. He had only received two, first of all, and in those two, Draco was distant with the letters themselves short. Draco had sent him multiple pages as letters before, but the two of the summer were barely a paragraph each.
When he told Draco, he didn’t react well. They had tentatively, at least to Harry, scheduled another date for that day. Draco called Harry several names and stormed off, leaving Harry alone.
“Maybe not, but he was my first friend. It was worth something to me.” Harry said a little defensively.
Draco ended up being right. A couple days before he turned seventeen, Ron wrote a letter telling him that his mum was throwing him a birthday party, since Sirius had gotten to last year. His tone was slightly apologetic, for Sirius’s sake, and that it would be better if he didn’t complain. Harry was upset, confused, and a bit annoyed. He was flattered that anyone would want to throw him a party, and he felt terrible about how ungrateful he felt he was being.
Draco was much more graceful. He raised a sculpted eyebrow. “I’m not sure that would be a good idea, Blaise.”
Draco’s eyes widened, he jumped up and started his explanation. “Madam, I just wanted to check on Harry, I was so worried about him and I couldn’t come and see him earlier!”
He laid down on the bed next to Draco’s, not bothering to find pajamas for himself. Harry looked across the small space, staring at Draco as long as he could before his eyelids finally closed, not opening again until morning."
Draco rolled his eyes. “It hardly takes away from my perfection. You haven’t answered why you’re still down there. How long are you going to keep me waiting?”
Draco sighed. “Have you considered that you are extremely lucky? Yes, you get into death-defying, dangerous situations practically all the time, but you have survived every one, and you are still an incredible person. I think you are one of the luckiest people on the planet. After me, of course.”
“Well, welcome, Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Mandy tried to get a hold of herself. “That is exactly what we are trying to do here, create a safe place where we can be ourselves, without fear of prejudice from outside forces. Hatred is a very strong power and force. It can lead to absolute devastation. But the way you fight hate is by an even stronger force: love. Love forgives, and trusts, and heals. Without it we would be nothing, and with it, we are united and strong.” She received a wave of applause for that and she looked down and blushed.
Draco raised their joint hands, bringing him out of his thoughts, and placed a kiss on the back of Harry’s hand. All the while, he was looking at Harry in fondness. Harry smiled, completely distracted, and thanked Draco with his eyes.
“Well, I thought about putting boyfriend or fiancé on it, but that wasn’t going to apply for long. Besides, I know you will be the best.”
He missed Draco, and he was so upset about their fight he couldn’t sleep. Then, he remembered the alarm that had gone off on his watch several hours ago, signaling it was time for Draco to take his potion. He had never asked if he had taken it, and Draco was so worried he might have forgotten.
There was a lot of information there, but there was even more implied information. Harry hated it when things were kept from him, but it sounded like Draco was fully intending to tell him at a later time. He didn’t like it, but he decided to trust Draco. He was distracted by the other obvious piece of information—Draco cared about Harry. Whatever else happened or didn’t happen, he was content with that knowledge.
Harry and Draco shared a smile as they did every time the topic of their marriage had come up. “The sixth. We’re actually on our honeymoon.”
He found out during the announcements. Hogwarts was to participate in a Tri-wizard tournament. Harry glanced at Draco during the explanation of what exactly that was, and Draco inclined his head while raising his eyebrows, looking suitably impressed.
Harry smiled, and leaned forward to hug Sal. Draco seemed hesitant. “I appreciate that, Ms. Perks. It would dire if anyone were to find out about us.”
When he told Draco, he didn’t react well. They had tentatively, at least to Harry, scheduled another date for that day. Draco called Harry several names and stormed off, leaving Harry wondering about them.
Harry nodded, trying not to look too pleased.  He slowly made his way vaguely towards the front doors until Ron was out of sight before making his way towards the Dungeons. He found the room they had decided on pretty easily, having paid extra attention as he was leaving.
He figured he was mostly finished with it. He had gotten the telly itself working, but the VCR had been sporadic.
The Gryffindor and Slytherin match was approaching with trepidation for Harry and Draco, eagerness for the rest of the school. It was at the last quidditch practice before the game that they found out they wouldn’t even be playing Slytherin.
Draco howled, reaching to his bag. He pulled out lube and spread a generous amount on their cocks. Harry slowed but didn’t stop completely as Draco fisted his cock for a couple strokes. He pulled them together when Draco was done, loving how his nipples felt, scraping against Draco’s skin and own nipples.
