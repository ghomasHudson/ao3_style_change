“Just making it extra pretty for you,” Draco lifted his eyebrow. He licked a teasing stripe up the tip, this time with more intent. Harry’s head fell forward with a moan.
“See,” Hermione's saying, gesturing so enthusiastically with her fork that Ron has to lean back. “I think the next step would be to have Caduceus approved as a supplier for the Ministry. That would help the exchange of information and research tremendously.”
“Alright,” Draco said, and they looked at each other, smiling. A snowball landed on Harry’s shoulder, snapping them out of their moment.
Draco watches Harry smile from the corner of his eye. The winter light catches in his dark curls and on the round lenses of his spectacles. He looks soft and at ease. Something squeezes in Draco’s chest, painful. He wishes he could trust Harry fully, the way his idiotic heart seems to be yearning for, the way he knows full well he can’t let happen.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Also, I—er, I brought something.” He rummaged inside his school bag and took out a small pouch of dried fruit and nuts, pouring some into his palm. “I thought it would be nice to have a snack until dinner time,” he added, almost apologetic. He held out his hand to Draco. “I wanted to thank you for the chocolate truffles the other day, and these always remind me of Christmas.”
In what seemed to Draco like a halo of divine light and a chorus of angels, the crowd of old schoolmates was parting.
Eventually they’d lifted themselves off the floor. Draco had grumbled he was too old for those kinds of antics, and Harry had laughed. Draco’d slid him a look and a pleased little half-smile, and had led him back to his bedroom, to his bed.
“And then...” Draco smiled slowly, “we ask your friend Hermione Granger if we’ve made the right decision.”
I couldn’t believe my eyes. You were so…” His hand slides further down Draco’s hip, the other one lifts to the side of his neck. “…so fucking beautiful, I couldn’t believe it was you, until I remembered—” Draco hears him swallow against his neck, and his own throat is tight, his breath is short, his heartbeat is thrumming in his skull, loud like static. He wants Harry to come closer,
Draco straightens. Despite his debauched state, he suddenly looks so collected. So much stronger, so much more mature than Harry feels.
“Are you all right, Potter?” Draco glared at Harry over his shoulder. “You seem to be coming down with a cold. I’d offer you a lozenge, but I only have the ones for adults.”
The atmosphere, hushed and intimate a moment ago, changes abruptly. The room feels several degrees colder, and Draco’s expression shifts from open to narrow-eyed focus. Harry has the sense to give a minute shake of his head. His heart is hammering in his chest, his body is cold, frozen on the spot. His mind rifles through the emergency instructions of the Ministry,
“Zat we were dying to see if you two finally kissed!” Gabrielle is the only one who doesn’t seem intent on teasing them until the end of time.
“Okay,” Harry says simply. Under his collected façade, his heart is beating madly. He might have pulled this off. He might start working for Draco Malfoy.
Harry lifted a quizzical eyebrow but Luna brought the Niffler to her chest, squeezing him like a plush toy.
“Shhh, Balzac, good boy,” Harry'd soothed when Balzac had whined, trying to pull his paw away from Harry’s grip. He’d cast a quick Extracto to vanish the splinter. Balzac’s paw would probably still be painful for a day or two. His breathing had been laboured, the after-effect of the Stunning spell fired at him.
Feeling uncomfortably moved, Harry fiddles with the handle of his tea mug and doesn’t say a word. Hermione makes a tiny noise in the back of her throat, as if she still cannot quite believe it’s happening — Harry wordlessly admitting that Draco is good for him.
And that was the story of how Draco had ended up standing by the drinks section of the buffet that took up the full length of the Great Hall of Hogwarts, watching Blaise and Pansy mingle and laugh with a bunch of people he’d been perfectly fine not thinking about for the past ten years, and downing his second glass of champagne as if it were a vodka shot. Merlin, he
Never ones to go without a fight, the former Quidditch players now in Eighth Year had pestered the Headmistress until she’d allowed them one hour of Quidditch practice, every Tuesday and Thursday after class, just to be left alone. Rumour had it that Weasley, Thomas, Greg and Blaise had camped in front of the stone gargoyle until McGonagall had come out in a flurry of tartan dressing gown and yelled
“Why not?” Ron’s head pops out of the kitchen door. “Oh, sorry. Because he got hurt at school? He also hurt you.” Ron nods at Harry’s bandaged arm. He's munching on a piece of cheddar, a smear of tomato sauce across his forehead, and the sight of his best friend cooking dinner for all of them, looking all soft and domestic, is too endearing for Harry to stay cross. Ron means well, after all.
He circles an arm around Malfoy’s shoulders, patting his back. It’s late, and he’s both blissfully tired and mortified to be having this conversation, and deep down Malfoy’s not wrong. Harry’s not ready to come out to the world. And least of all with Draco Malfoy — a thief, an ex-Death Eater, Harry’s old nemesis —  on his arm.
Draco clutches his chest, mock-offended. “You wound me, Pansy. Here I was, thinking you’d traveled from Paris for my pretty face and winning personality.”
“Don’t mind my wife, Harry,” Blaise says genially, following her into the house and clapping a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “She’s scared shitless that you’ll still hate her. Acting like an entitled diva is her way of avoiding uncomfortable silences.”
“Fuck…you…?” Malfoy was everywhere, all around him, a fist around both their cocks and his fast breath bathing Harry’s face, but the words he’d uttered still seemed nonsensical. How could this evening have turned out so lucky? How could this wet dream of a man offer up himself to Harry?
supposed to be doing anything?” He shook his head. “It’s fine, Potter. It’s not as though I would have expected coffee and a date after last night. Let’s get back to work.”
He steeples his fingers and focuses his attention on Greg. Greg’s steady brown eyes hold his gaze. Few people dare to these days. Then again, Greg is nothing if not stubbornly brave. He could have sorted Gryffindor, were it not for his pureblood ancestry and all the misinformed choices he would make as a teenager.
On Tuesday morning, three weeks after the charity gala at the Wizarding Chamber of Commerce, Harry receives a note from the director of the Royal Opera House. It’s a thank you card, acknowledging the sizable donation that Harry made to the organization a few days before, and lauding Harry’s unwavering support of the arts. It comes with two tickets to the premiere representation of Swan Lake on the next Saturday. Harry looks at the thick rectangles of paper, the aisle and seat numbers taking up the top left corner of the tickets in bold black font. The seats are in the back corner of a box, one floor above the stalls. The perfect spot to watch the show without being seen. It’s a Muggle show, so he’s unlikely to be cornered by paparazzi once he gets there. Definitely an added bonus.
“Yeah, you can tell it’s nearly Christmas,” Ron gave the Seventh Year girls an annoyed look before moving one of his knights. “All of you waltzing in our common room as you please.”
She sauntered away to meet her laughing girlfriend, and Draco was left to discreetly glance upward, wondering if he’d catch a glimpse of his supposedly beautiful aura.
The days following Draco’s emergency visit to the Thickey Ward have sludged by in a listless, bitter sort of stupor.
“Listen to me," Harry says, his voice low, desperate. “I can stay. I can protect you. Only you and I know… the truth about me. If you killed me,” Draco huffs a derisive laugh, “or if you fired me, the Ministry would find other ways to pursue their investigation. As long as I’m here… they can’t touch you, they can’t touch Scorpius, they can’t touch Caduceus
“What are you humming?” she said, and he jumped. Clutching the nearest shelf to catch his breath, he groaned.
The room they walk into is much larger. The atmosphere is warmer, darker; all dark wood panelling, thick rugs and a merry fire crackling in a huge fireplace on Harry’s right-hand side. There is a large, elegant mahogany desk in the middle of the room, facing two brown leather club chairs and a high-back, pearl-grey silk upholstered one; the desk and the floor around it are covered with piles and piles of sheets of parchment and leather-bound books.
Draco was surprised to find the familiar shape of Harry on the sofa facing the hearth. Curled up cosily, his legs tucked under him, he appeared to be shaking his head and shoulders in rhythm to something Draco couldn’t hear. Strange. Stranger still, he didn’t move when Draco approached him.
Neo-Wolfsbane, a modified version of Wolfsbane that further reduces the worst of the symptoms of lycanthropy.
“You were raised by utter dicks,” Draco says softly. “You had more important things to do than notice those signs. I, on the other hand, had never seen one until I’d decided what I wanted to do with my life. Of course the snakes and staff held a crucial meaning for me. I wanted to do with Caduceus what Muggles had done with medicine. Try to put everyone’s magical Healing knowledge and access on the same level.”
“And then I want you to stay inside when you come, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled in a blur, wanking himself furiously, his balls drawing up, his orgasm imminent, “You’re going to pound that fat cock of yours in me and you’re going to fill me with your hot spunk—”
“Got her, chief,” the Auror announces brightly. He takes in the state of the study before muttering: “She was almost feistier than her boss.”
“Nevermind. It was the easy thing to want to be, I guess. I wanted to be an Auror. I wanted a wife, three kids, a nice house, and a dog.”
Penelope never imparts her wisdom lightly. So when she clears her throat, you can hear a pin drop in the DLF office. Everyone is on the edge of their seats.
Draco hesitated and the Quick-Quotes Quill stilled over the parchment. “But...Luna, the series is called
“Muggles have such a vivid imagination,” he murmured. “I mean, I guess you’d have to, to come up with these lyrics. Do they really believe they could put a man on the moon?”
—Harry, this is about showing them that they’re not alone! That even their absolute hero is like them! This is about—about giving people
Draco stared at the tiny dragon in mild horror. He had to admit she was pretty, with a back adorned in shimmering moss-green scales and tiny spikes. Her webbed wings were purple, as were her snout and belly, and they glittered opalescent against the firelight while wisps of grey smoke spiralled up from her gently fluttering nostrils. Her thin green tail curled around her body and over her eyes, as though she was shielding herself from the light.
“Now that you mention it, you do look a bit grey in the face.” Harry pats him on the back, pulling him away from the Petersons. Hermione abandons her targets with a resentful sigh and her mouth open and ready to chide Ron and Harry, but then a waiter swoops in with a bottle of white wine. Ron nearly throws himself at the man in relief, and Hermione laughs and cooes at her boyfriend.
“Subtle,” Harry said eventually, a small smile quirking the corner of his mouth. Hands in his jeans pockets, he looked almost apologetic.
Harry tenses slightly. “I— I’d rather you wouldn’t,” he says. “I’m not— I’m not ready to go public.”
He only now realises how much Harry has risked for him, how much he has given up. When Draco had seen him standing there, taking in the mess Smith and his Aurors had made… He had been convinced that one word, one lift of Harry’s eyebrow, would give what they were to each other away. Harry’d had that look on his face…. It was a look that Draco remembered seeing on Harry’s face many years ago — determined to do what he must to help his friends, to save the day — and for a second Draco’s mind had flashed back to his Hogwarts years... to how much he’d wished, back then, to be the centre of Harry’s undivided, bull-headed focus. And now that he was, Draco suddenly felt utterly unworthy of it.
When he looked over at Harry, Harry was watching him, hands in his lap. His green eyes gleamed in the candlelight, and Draco wished everything was as simple as holding out his hand, not to grab a piece of dried fruit, but to touch Harry’s fingers, entwine them with his, set things in motion.
Draco gave her a smile. The muscles in his cheeks felt stiff. “Yes. Then you’re free to go.” He uncrossed his legs, leaned in, and took a breath. It was the same question he asked all his other interviewees, the one he liked to conclude on. “What is the thing people get wrong the most about you? I suppose you are confronted with a few false assumptions, given your past and your status.”
“You think you’re stronger than me, do you?” Draco pushes harder. He’s smiling, too. It looks slightly strained, though, a bit dangerous, and Harry can detect something like resentment underneath. “Just because you’re a big, bad, burly bodyguard?”
“Fuck,” Draco swore out loud. He adjusted his clothing hastily, buttoning up his trousers as the rest of the world came back into focus.
He gritted his teeth, wondering how much responsibility he bore in the crafting of that label. Feet sinking in a thick shagpile rug, he stepped into the living room, the deluge of sunlight momentarily blinding him.
“Fine,” Malfoy throws his hands up in mock-defeat. “Perfect. So we’ve established the use of given names then.
“That’s true, but…” Draco closes his eyes, the next words leaving him in a rush. “It’s also thanks to them that you landed on my doorstep in the first place.”
“Besides, he’s only a suspect on paper. Because Kingsley and Smith said so. He’s not… I think he’s innocent.”
I failed at all the missions anyone has given me. Take Voldemort’s requests. Those sure backfired with me in charge! I’ve barely–“ Realisation dawned on him. Suddenly, he felt cold. Colder than he had any right to be this close to the gaping maw of Hell.
as Quidditch Magazine had dubbed him a year into his tenure with the Epsom Eagles. Ten years later, he had risen to the rank of captain and he was leading the team of England as well. Shirtless pictures of him during training sessions or beach holidays sold for thousands of Galleons to the tabloids. Witch Weekly regularly voted him Hottest Bachelor of the Year. He’d always had his pick of women—and men, ever since he’d very publicly come out as bisexual a couple of years ago. By every standard imaginable, he’d had an incredibly successful decade.
Harry had been right, as was often the case when it came to appreciating the little pieces of beauty life had to offer. Although the view that greeted them at the top of the stairs was anything but
Malfoy, on the other end, seemed caught between embarrassment and bravado. “Shall you lead the way, then?”
Draco had given him a wide-eyed, innocent look. “If I can’t be a bit Slytherin about it, what’s the point?”
There had been no documentation on how Malfoy had dealt with that tragedy. The Auror reports had remained factual to the point of clinical. They usually did.
“What is this about, Kingsley?” he asks bluntly, wariness inexplicably flaring in the pit of his stomach.
Harry's eyes scan the documents strewn across Draco’s desk, hoping something will pop up, catch his attention in a meaningful way. Most of them are papers and parchments embossed with the Caduceus logo, tables covered with numbers and pound signs, legal documents regarding the opening of a Caduceus factory in Romania Harry’s vaguely heard Draco mention during firecalls with his legal team. As he walks towards the filing cabinets behind Draco’s desk, his sleeve catches on a pile of parchment rolls that fall to the floor. One of them unrolls, and he almost steps on it. Harry notices it: the grain of paper is different from the one Caduceus uses; it’s written in a foreign language; and the logo, a calligraphed slew of French, is decidedly not the wand and serpent he’s become so familiar with in the past month. He picks it up and reads.
“Draco. Oh, Draco,” Mephistopheles said with an ugly, carnivorous grin. “They think you’ve been off the hook long enough now. They think you can take on more responsibilities, Draco. They definitely think you–ah,
The others hooted with laughter—first of all Harry. Dean Thomas was pushing Weasley playfully, “Hey! What are you saying? I wasn't  good enough to date Ginny?” and Weasley was laughing, “You’re not the worst, but it’s not like you’re the
Harry suddenly remembers the tall, wide frame of the man standing beside Malfoy on the picture, and understanding hits him like a Bludger in the face.
“Draco... This isn’t like you. What are you even trying to do…?” Harry’s question ends in the back of his throat, high and strangled. He feels it coming before he knows to name it — the shortness of breath, the blood pumping so loudly through his skull he can’t hear anything else, the cold sweat spreading on his nape and the small of his back—
It was only after Easter, when he came back to Hogwarts after his brief but earth-shattering encounter with Potter at the Manor, that he fell out of his relationship with Pansy and Blaise. Nothing they did could Obliviate the memory of those unmistakable, bright green eyes from his mind, Potter’s body struggling against his in a fight for life where Draco had all but given up his wand to the Chosen One.
Malfoy’s answering smirk sends a wave of warmth through Harry. Malfoy holds out a pale, elegant hand, and Harry takes it.
Dropped out of law enforcement a year later (So many reasons. I didn’t like it as much as I expected. I wasn’t as good at it as I expected. It wasn't doing anything for my mental health. Even
Irrationally, Draco wanted to speak before Harry had time to say another word. Something he should have done, perhaps, months ago.
“Harry.” When Draco speaks, the Aurors stop for a second. Draco’s looking at him, his face a pale shade of grey, his eyes exhausted and hollow save for the imploring glint in them. “Please. Take care of Scorpius. Take care of him— until I’m back.” His shoulders slump and he shakes his head, looking empty again. His sneer is bitter and his tone is several degrees colder when he adds: “We’ll talk — we’ll finish this when I come back.”
There are papers and parchments thrown everywhere; books and records fallen from the shelves; still-steaming burn holes in the carpets. The unicorn and dragons chair is lying on its side, upturned. Someone put out the fire in the hearth, and the study is plunged into half-darkness. The only source of light comes from the French doors that have been thrown open; they’re letting in rays of sun and a warm, gentle breeze, completely at odds with the scene.
“Here. Months ago. I’d picked it up because it looked so out of place… The font, the foreign language… I didn’t realise why until a minute ago.”
I could have lived a happy, carefree life without the knowledge that my best mate had a thing for blond gits in goggles and white lab robes, but you
“No, but the investigation has just taken a new turn. Smith believes legal financial audits won’t be enough to uncover whatever provided Malfoy with the starting assets for
He tilted his head to take more of Harry’s cock into his mouth. He licked it on his way up, closing his lips around the tip and hollowing his cheeks to suck at Harry’s foreskin. He pressed down once more, and then Harry’s muscles clamped around his finger and he pulsed in Draco’s mouth once, twice, as he came with a ragged cry.
“This is what people get wrong the most, Draco. That even war survivors move on. It’s always there, written in our flesh, seared into our brains. But it’s not constant. There are minutes, hours, days even, when I forget. I don’t think the public will like to read this, but it’s true. I forget about the war, sometimes. My friends and I...we’re still here. Our plants keep growing, and life goes on.”
But Harry only has three days left now, and he feels his hopes grow thinner by the minute. He waits until Scorpius has climbed the last front steps and closes the door behind them.
have come here before, if he was perfectly honest with himself. But never in his hundred lives had he felt the need to cross the border.
“Hi,” Draco answered with a small smile. He felt strangely shy, uncertain about what would come next, his new heart beating madly in his chest.
The rational part of Harry tells him to go down the stairs, towards the exit. It’s the logical path. If Malfoy had Disapparated, Harry would have noticed the tell-tale crack. It only made sense, then, that Malfoy would have left the venue through the doors… but there’s been no sound of Disapparition.
Harry sits down on the carpet, his legs crossed, a few careful feet away from Draco. “Draco…?” he prompts gently.
“Just... being young. Being free. Seeing my friends be happy and safe. Seeing the world a bit. Seeing everything I never had a chance to see.”
Everything goes very quiet, except for the loud rush of Harry’s heart in his ears. Malfoy’s gone very still, Harry’s hips pinning him in place against the table. He seems to have stopped breathing altogether.
“One reason, Potter,” he snarls, grabbing Harry by the front of his hospital robes and yanking. “I asked for one reason.”
Draco nodded jerkily, ignoring the titters coming from his friends. He appreciated them, he truly did, more than he’d ever appreciated humans in the past, but... perhaps in his next life he’d try to pick friends who were actually
And then what? Harry has no idea. The only thing he’s sure of is that he doesn’t want Malfoy to fade into the night like he did last time. To leave him to wrestle with all the questions this encounter raised, and none of the answers.
“This wouldn’t have happened, though, would it?” Draco says. “If you hadn’t stayed here for so long. If you hadn’t let Zacharias Smith go rabid with the case, waiting for you to solve it.”
“All right,” Malfoy scowls. He’s still unconvinced. “Is that why I should choose you, then? Because you could have killed me and I could have killed you, and we didn’t? Seems pretty thin an argument.”
I don’t know what it means (the dictionary wasn’t clear on that). The bullies leave me alone now, though. And the scary people will never come back.) The records are categorised by colour now. The back wall like a rainbow.
The conversation stays quiet and pleasant as everybody tucks in, helping themselves out of Ernestina’s rich selection. Harry is halfway through his first serving of mash and peas when he catches Draco’s conversation with Hermione. Draco’s leaning forward and listening intently as she catches him up on her department’s most recent findings.
Draco’s knees wobbled with pleasure and anticipation. He wanted to initiate Harry in his own way; he wanted to watch him lose his mind, come undone in Draco’s hands, in Draco’s mouth—
“Thanks,” Harry murmurs. Malfoy’s invitation should register as a small victory. Instead it feels like mutual surrender.
Because…. Well, it’s only been a week, but Harry knows that Draco has nothing to hide. He feels it in his bones. He knows the Ministry has identified Draco as a suspect — and wouldn’t it be nice if he was, Harry thinks ruefully. What a nice pack of Galleons the Ministry could confiscate to add some extra padding to its vaults — and from an ex Death Eater, no less. But Harry also has enough experience in the field to trust his instincts. And his instincts are screaming to him that the Ministry is wasting everyone’s time with this case.
“I did. I had just turned seventeen. I had access to my vaults, so with my mum’s inheritance, I took a trip to Norway and Sweden. I wanted to research the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. I would have loved to be the first person to document a sighting.”
“Mephisto won’t find out,” Draco said. They were staring at each other in the semi-darkness, eye contact as intense as the stakes were high. “If he does, the ring ends up at the bottom of the Hogwarts lake.”
Draco had stayed there for long, lonely minutes after. He had contemplated the fact that he was only Harry Potter’s boyfriend, while Harry Potter was the only love of his many lives.
“So eager for me, Potter,” he murmurs against Harry’s lips. “To think I almost turned you down tonight… What would you have done if I hadn’t come here?”
“Maybe you’re alone because you want to be.” Harry ignored Draco’s jab and stalked closer, a purposeful look on his face. “Maybe you’re alone because you can’t be with the person you want. Maybe you’re an idiot and you fucked up the first time. And you regret it terribly, but since you’re a circuitous git, you can’t choose the path of least resistance. So you keep hoping that if you run into him, time and again, one day he'll look at you like he did that night. Like something was
he’d told his roomates in the inevitable ‘too much information’ moments of initial dorm room cohabitation).
They hesitated at the threshold of the cabin, its interior pitch black and unknown, but the storm made the decision for them. There was a gust of wind so violent they swayed on the spot. Snow started falling around them—a
Harry feels his stomach drop. The words had sounded like an accusation. Then he remembers: Malfoy doesn’t know about his mission. Of course not. That would be absurd. Who would Harry tell about Scorpius?
That evening, Harry walks into the Eldridge House early. Only a few guests — donors — are here, gliding from room to room and chattering in the polite, stilted way of people who’ve joined a party before it had time to warm up. A few photographers mingle among them, looking like hyenas on the prowl. Harry frowns when one of them spots him and flashes a picture.
“You know, I always thought you were terribly obnoxious when we were kids.” Draco doesn’t know where the desire to confess this comes from. They’re standing near the water, watching Scorpius and Balzac observe the ducks paddling across the pond.
“My bitterness? I’m not bitter. You’re the one who’s begging for attention. I thought you got more of that than any human alive, but I was wrong, apparently.”
Harry gives his head a slight shake. There’s no way Malfoy collects records. It’s just… darker in here, and Harry’s vision might need time to adjust.
But being naked together with Malfoy’s fingers up his arse and Malfoy’s hard prick sliding against his own was decidedly
Three days later, Harry’s at the doorstep of Draco’s Sloane Square townhouse, standing under the rain and an umbrella charm, a pathetic echo of the same morning, four months before.
Ron nods. “Between ‘Mione working with Malfoy to save the world, and you falling for him… I suppose our suspicions were misplaced.” He gives Harry a little smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Our turn to be prejudiced pricks, eh?
to say it.” He was shaking a bit. Harry took a step back. He nodded carefully, watching Draco from behind his round spectacles, and Draco’s chest ached. “I know you liked him. I didn’t, but it’s no excuse. You have to know—you
“I remember,” Draco pretends to concede with good grace. “I was bigoted, prejudiced, and spouting out whatever fucking horrible worldviews my father had fed me since I was born.”
Harry’s in bed with a book in his lap when the knock comes at the door. He puts the book down to mark his place. He’s been reading the same three sentences over and over, unable to focus. He runs a hasty hand through his hair, checks that he’s presentable, and says, “Come in!”
“Yeah. You put them in your ears to listen to music,” Harry explained. A curious sense of relief washed over Draco at the normality of their conversation. He noticed Harry had relaxed as well: he was thumbing one of the headphones, bringing it close to his face. “It’s a Muggle invention,” he continued. “I don’t think there’s a wizarding equivalent... at least not yet.”
Down on the stage, lithe women dressed in white tutus swirl around a young man with a hopeful face and a leotard that leaves nothing to the imagination. Harry wishes he could tear his eyes away from those muscled thighs and those strong, defined biceps, from the danseur’s dark, expressive eyes. But it’s been three rough, sleepless weeks for Harry. He thinks he deserves that small, guilty pleasure. So he stares at the man on the stage. He pictures his own mind like a swan, sinking in a lake of thoughts and desires that he was no control over, that he can’t explain. The danseur spins and spins, with a controlled abandon that seems to defy gravity.
to start, aren’t you? But Harry... he’s never really had a chance to plan for the future, has he? All his life—all he’s ever done was
Hannah thumps him in the back and points at Gabrielle, “Be quiet, you dirty man, there’s an innocent little thing among us!” while Gabrielle pulls at her sleeve, “What did ‘e mean? What does zat mean, ‘Annah’?”
An odd look crosses Malfoy’s face at Harry’s words. He nods, rather formally. “Yes, of course. Follow me.”
Abashed, Draco thought of the abundant fun he’d made of Neville Longbottom precisely for his love of Herbology, a subject matter his younger self didn’t deem worthy of his time and ambition.
The door had barely snapped shut behind them that Harry grabbed Draco by the front of his shirt and pushed him roughly against the door.
Drao gives him an incredulous look.“The company is under Ernestina’s name, for one. If I talk about it, she gets arrested. And secondly… I’m supposed to be a Potions master, remember? I’m supposed to represent Caduceus. I’m not… supposed to be the person who helped to create a cute, gadget-y pushchair that started a long-lasting fad. It’s a matter of company image for Caduceus… and I’ve worked
Draco rubbed his jaw. He gazed at Harry, who brought his socked feet under him on the sofa and smiled at Draco expectantly.
“My solution is anything that gets you out of your post-divorce funk—” Pansy had said, leaning forward, elbows on her knees.
Thank you so much to everyone who's read, kudo'd and commented so far. You brighten every one of my December days!
Behind him, he can hear Draco tidying the mess they’ve made. He sounds distracted when he asks, “What?”
“Let’s say we’re dying here,” Malfoy interrupted as if Harry hadn’t spoken at all. His grey eyes were glinting in the dark. Harry watched him as he spoke, the movement of his lips, of his throat. “Let’s say we’re dying here because we went chasing after a bunch of lunatics who thought it was the end of the world. As much as I hate to admit it, there’s some kind of humorous irony here, don’t you think?” He turned his face to Harry. His soft smile from a minute ago had turned into his usual smirk. “What would
Pansy had commented with a smirk. Draco had huffed and harrumphed, but he hadn't been able to deny that Pansy’s teasing remark had had a ring of truth to it. He was a screamer, wasn’t he? Though he hadn’t had much opportunity to scream, if one got his meaning, in the past year or so.
“May I—” he nods over his shoulder and points at Draco, who’s sitting at his desk, filling out Ministry forms with slashing movements of his quill. “I’d like to—”
who helped Potter with that perfect winged eyeliner he was sporting yesterday (which was — what a coincidence! — the challenge I laid down: wear black eyeliner for a full day at the Ministry).
In truth, Grimmauld Place never feels light and sunny. It never feels warm, even in the middle of the August dog days. Harry doesn’t begrudge his godfather’s house for it, not really. It’s a bloody ancient house, its windows a bit too small for the sunlight to properly get in, its tapestries a bit too dark for the rooms to ever feel sunny, its old radiators and pipes a bit too slow to conduct the warmth of the heater (which isn’t top-of-the-line, either — Harry remembers Mundungus Fletcher, disheveled and sweaty, helping an intensely disgruntled Severus Snape install the creaky old heater in the kitchen, back when he spent his summer in the Order’s headquarters). He knows Number Twelve, Grimmauld place isn’t cold and unwelcoming just to displease him. It’s just a house… but he can’t deny that being away from it is always a welcome change.
to make an impression. This whole endeavour had ‘Best Seller’ written all over it from the beginning. I mean...I managed to recruit some pretty big names for it. Who
Draco pulled out a few inches, his hands gripping Harry’s hips, then slammed back in as Harry cried out. Draco did it again and again, every thrust rougher and needier than the one before,
Draco seems unphased by Harry's jab. “Yes, it is. I live for me. For Scorpius. For my mother, for Ernestina. I live to make Caduceus better.”
Hermione beamed. “Stop it, the two of you. I can barely take a compliment from Ron, now if Draco Malfoy of all people joins in...”
Ernestina nods and sobs quietly, unable to form a word. Draco stands still for so long, Harry starts to worry that he’s going to fight the Aurors again.
Harry’s hand slid across the small space between their bodies on the sofa. It came to rest an inch from Draco’s, lying on the cushion at his side. His hand stayed there. Draco looked at Harry and broke the silence.
“Look, Draco. I’m not masochistic, either. That’s the reason why I never contacted you after Ginny and Blaise’s engagement party. Since we’re on the subject of truth...there’s something you should know.”
Then realises his feet are taking him in the opposite direction. Towards the place where he knows the intruder will be. You
“Frowned upon, yes,” Ella'd conceded with a sneer. “A backwards way of thinking of other magical creatures, if you want my opinion. But not illegal.”
As if any of it matters now, Harry. This can’t go on. What do you expect? Us walking into the Ministry hand in hand, making a happy announcement? And what would that be? That you’ve been fucking me for months while pretending you were still Shacklebolt’s spy? Or that Draco Malfoy was stupid enough to spread his legs for a Ministry mole?” His lip curls in a sarcastic sneer. “Pray tell, Harry, which one sounds better to you?”
“And you’re fine with working… for me?” Malfoy asks, looking uninterested and aloof but for the slight hesitation at the end of his question.
Harry breathed out through his mouth and nodded. “Yeah. Alright. Sorry, you... I was surprised.” He made a whiny little sound and settled his hands more firmly against the door. “Keep—keep doing it. Please.”
“I don’t know why I’m even asking you. It’s not like you understand. It’s not like you know what it’s like, do you? Mummy’s waiting for you at the Manor. Daddy’s still alive. Everyone you love, unscathed.”
“Scorpius, can you hear me?” Harry'd asked gently. Scorpius’ eyes had shifted to his — then immediately flitted up to his scar. Harry could have cried with relief. “Good, good,” he’d comforted him. “You’re brilliant, Scorpius. You’re doing really great.” He’d shown Scorpius his hand. “Can I touch you? To help you up.” Almost miraculously, the little boy had nodded. Harry had taken a skinny little shoulder in his hand and pulled Scorpius up in a sitting position. Scorpius had immediately lunged to grab a piano key that had fallen near him.
“You seem to know an awful lot about my love life, Potter, for someone who supposedly doesn’t give a shite.”
She shifted in Weasley’s arms to better look at him. Both were cuddled up on the sofa by the fire. Weasley was deep in conversation with Seamus Finnigan, also curled up around his own boyfriend at the foot of the sofa. At the other end of it, Pansy, wrapped around a Neville Longbottom who looked chuffed and terrified in equal measure by his own good luck, stared at Draco in surprise. She widened her eyes as if to say, ‘Striking up a conversation with Granger? What’s got into you?’ He lifted an defiant eyebrow at her to retort, ‘Longbottom? Now that’s new.’ She had the decency to blush lightly and look away.
Malfoy gave Harry a disbelieving glance and scoffed. “Thank Merlin, Potter. It appears we’re not going to die in a snowstorm. Perhaps we’ll die in a log cabin filled with Dark magic instead. Just brilliant.”
Try as he might, Harry hasn’t managed to forget about the heat and want that transpired between them in that cloakroom. He doesn’t care to find out what it means that he can’t. What it means that he let it happen in the first place. That he
“Look, I was only half-joking. I know the newspaper contacted you on my behalf. Several times, actually. If I could get one person to participate in the series...as much as it pains me to admit it, it would be
if you want to—” There’s the distant sound of the door rattling with each of their thrusts, Harry fucking him into the hard wood. Draco’s never lost control like this, not since he was fourteen and had soiled his pyjamas with come, one early morning in his four-poster bed, after barely bringing a hand to himself. He bucks into Harry’s grip, but Harry’s hand is still pinning his wrists to the door and no amount of squirming will make him loosen his grasp.
“You wish, Malfoy. I’m only here to help a friend.” To stress his point, Harry clapped Longbottom on the shoulder. He stalked closer to where Draco and Luna were sitting, glaring at Draco. “In fact, if I’d known you’d be here, I would have picked another day.”
Draco sighs, frustrated. “Let’s... talk about something else. Please.” He reaches for his raven feather quill across the desk and fiddles with it to avoid looking at his friend. He’s aware that he indulges himself when he lets his sullen moods take over. It’s a natural tendency of his, one he should learn to fight.
You’ve only shown me the tip of the iceberg. I want to know all of you. I want to listen to you tell me more about your life, and your future. I want to feel every inch of your skin under my fingertips. I want to listen to the sounds you make when I take you in my mouth. I want to feel the weight of you on me. Until you’re sick of me. Will I ever be sick of you? There’s no way we can predict it. But all evidence seems to prove the opposite. I’ve never really been sick of you since I was eleven. Always seeking you out, teasing you, chasing you, following you around like a lovesick fool (let’s face it, you weren’t much better).
But this was something else: it felt like hitting a wall, like something they wouldn't be able to move past. He’s spent half his life hating Draco; he’s spent the last months falling irrevocably in love with him. He never thought these two emotions could coexist until the moment Draco shut him down for being soft with him and ordered him to defile him on his office desk instead. As soon as Harry let his real feelings slip, Draco acted like those feelings never existed.
He followed Harry out of the Library. They silently walked the drafty corridor leading to the stairwell. It was a normal school night of December; the castle was quiet, save for the occasional students rushing off to join the merry fire and friendly faces of their year’s common room.
“I am,” he said. Then, because he couldn’t resist, “Considering I’m the one who came up with the idea of the series, you’d
It’s nearly half past eleven now, judging by the hands on the grandfather clock in Draco’s study. It’s raining in earnest outside, the fresh, bracing scent of wet vegetation drifting inside. Harry closes the doors to the garden before puddles start forming on the hardwood floors.
“I,” growls Malfoy over a forkful of rice, “do not need help. Not from you, not from anybody, and least of all from law enforcement.”
Kingsley glances at Ron, who nods shortly. Their collusion feels distinctly odd, and Harry’s previous sense of unease strengthens, clawing at his gut.
Dinner reaches its end in a more subdued atmosphere than it had started. Ernestina brings an enormous chocolate cake laden with small birthday candles. Someone makes a joke about it being bright enough that they don’t need the lights on. Good natured jabs about Draco’s ancient age ensue, and Draco laughs and gives his friends tit for tat. The cake disappears in less than ten minutes and is replaced with cups of tea, hot cocoa, and, in the case of Blaise, a glass of bas armagnac.
“Okay, Harry,” Scorpius tells him, and Harry is suffused with warmth. He wants to ruffle Scorpius’s hair like he would do with Teddy, but it might not be well received.
That’s how he ends up in the darkened corner of an opera box on Saturday night, an empty seat next to him.
The cupboard floor is strewn with office supplies and half-open boxes by the time Harry finally opens one to find the quill Draco was looking for. Long, black and white quills. “Stork feathers. Symbol of good luck. Not my idea — my solicitor's,” Draco had explained earlier with a wry shake of his head, as if the thought of using items for what they symbolised was more preposterous than the existence of magic.
With one last irritated glance at Harry, Malfoy slid a few inches down the bench, head resting on the wall behind them, exposing his long, pale throat.
“Not in the slightest.” Draco gave her a small smile. This time though, it was entirely genuine. “So, the Prothimioscope.”
on themselves, but not a much needed air-freshening charm in my office?” Penelope Clearwater sniffs, unimpressed. She steps in as the others make room for her. She surveys Harry and Draco with a lifted eyebrow. It barely twitches with hilarity, which Harry thinks is quite a feat of self-control, given the pretty conspicuous tableau they make.
Inside, things had become ever more cheery than the last time Draco and Harry had been there. There was an entire herd of reindeer ornaments frolicking around the imposing desk and along the bookshelves lining the walls. Floating golden baubles sprinkled enchanted glitter everywhere, and a Christmas tree had been squeezed in the corner where Dumbledore’s magical instruments used to be displayed. In this cheery decor, the hard-nosed Headmistress made for quite a startling sight.
“Yes, but you’re the one who deserves it more.” Malfoy half-climbs on top of him, hand barely slowing down. “You deserve to have good sex. You deserve to give your desires free rein. You said it yourself: you’ve repressed them for too long.” He kisses him then, an open-mouthed kiss that blends gentleness with possession. “And that’s no way to live, Potter.”
He'd thought he’d have more time to rest after his last mission. He’d come in from Shanghai only yesterday. The task—infiltrating and exposing a network of Chinese spies who posed as interns and collected information on British Unspeakables’ experiments—had taken him half a year to complete. He missed London. He missed his bed. He still feels jet-lagged and woozy from the long Portkey trip. Kingsley, however, had been adamant. So Harry'd assumed he had no choice in the matter and left Grimmauld Place that morning, resolving to ask Kingsley for double the days off next time he wanted to take a holiday.
“I’m going to miss him too.” Greg looks down at his big hands. “I told him goodnight before he went to bed. I didn’t remind him that I won’t be here tomorrow.”
“Are you joking right now?” Malfoy’s voice is barely a wisp of breath. Neither of them moves, caught in each other’s gaze, green on grey. “How can you think I…”
“Of course! You and I had just spent our first night together! I wasn’t ready to discuss any of it with my friends. I wasn’t ready to discuss it with anyone. Except perhaps with you. And the next time I saw you, you avoided me like the plague.”
He still has his charity work to keep him busy, though he’s putting his invitations to various events and theatre premieres through a more ruthless filter than before. He comes up with excuses for the former and gives out the latter to his coupled friends.
“Ah, yes, of course. And that’s easy, because there are so many people out there willing to do just that.”
Harry thinks it’s ironic that Draco Malfoy, of all people, would call Harry out on privilege and the difficulties of life. But then again, he has to admit that their situations got flipped on their heads by the end of the war. Although Harry can hardly resent that, he still feels a twinge of sympathy for Malfoy.
Fortunately, the area around Draco’s house is mainly Muggle, which keeps it under the wizarding journalists’ radar. It’s heavily protected by repellent spells and charms in case the Muggle parameter wasn’t enough, which means Harry can come and go without being bothered.
“I don’t think normal rules apply here, Hermione.” Harry tries to keep the rising irritation from his voice, but fails. Don’t they see? He’d do anything to wrap up the case.
Harry opens his mouth to speak, but Narcissa raises a pale, long-fingered hand and continues as if he hadn’t moved. “I love my son more than anything and anyone in this world. You, of all people, know how much. We are both intelligent adults. I suppose I don’t need to specify all the ways I could make the Dark Lord’s curses feel like a sweet summer breeze to you if you ever hurt Draco.”
“Hey! Don’t laugh," Hermione says. "I have a four-year-old girl and a six-month-old baby and my brain has basically turned to mush. Everyone has this pushchair here. It was designed for parents living in big cities, apparently — I can manoeuvre it everywhere in London, no matter how much dog poo or rubbish bags are blocking the pavement.”
she said, sipping her tea. She didn’t look at him, but he heard the smile in her voice. “Welcome to the club, Draco.”
The knock at the door is heavy but hesitant, and Draco looks up from the stacks of papers on his desk.
Besides, Millicent told me she’d cut my balls off and wear them as earrings if she caught me helping you again. We can’t have that. As much as I care about my balls, I think we all agree they’d make the world’s most distasteful jewelry.
Luna was gazing at him, unwavering. Draco wondered how much she knew. The girl had always had the detached, bluntly forthright quality of a Seer.
instead of ignoring him — when surely, Harry not raising to the bait would have driven Malfoy away after a while — Malfoy had sought Harry out, again and again, always throwing wordless challenges Harry’s way, like one throws tinder into fire.
Malfoy closes the book in his lap with deliberate slowness. “Ah, but you see, that was before you told me you weren’t ready to be with me. And I heard you loud and clear. I might be an outcast and a thief, but I’m not going to stick around for a man who’s ashamed of me. That’s more than I’m willing to debase myself.”
Harry wonders at the source of it all, as he watches Malfoy — Draco — take a more human shape in his mind as the days go by. What he sees leaves him strangely torn, in a way he’s never felt about suspects in a case: everything about Draco’s habits and demeanour speaks of honesty, and Harry’s at a loss to find loose ends to investigate. Despite the notes he makes for the case, there is nothing yet that lets Harry suspect dodgy activities. All Draco seems to do is work, and spend whatever free time he has with Scorpius. Harry doesn’t think there are enough hours left in the day for Draco to conduct additional business, whatever its nature. All of Draco’s trips, meetings and work hours seem devoted to Caduceus and nothing else.
He would just have to focus on that when chatting with his old classmates, and not on how unfulfilled he felt. How lonely.
“Oh, yes. Always,” said Draco. He tapped his fingers on his chin, pretending to think. “So... All is good in the human world. Child labour, starvation, disease, financial crises, general pettiness. Next to it, my minor acts of naughtiness and bullying seem a lover’s caress.”
“Are you boyfriends?” she asked, keeping her voice blessedly down. “You say you don’t know what kissing all night makes you, but it seems rather clear to me, sweetheart.”
“The Minister has so many reasons for coming after Caduceus — after you. Catching an ex-Death Eater. Adding a new catch to his wall of fame. Reminding wizarding Britain of his glory days as an Auror. Replenishing the Ministry vaults with your confiscated wealth.”
Draco leaned in and trapped the device under his palm. It stopped spinning, and he stuffed it in his pocket. “Of course not. That’s not how it works. It just indicates—”
The smile stretching Draco’s lips made it harder to kiss Harry, but Draco did it anyway. When they broke the kiss, he rested his forehead against Harry’s. He breathed in and out.
Harry must take Draco’s silence for reproach — wariness. He turns his gaze back at him. His eyes are wistful, like he knows something Draco doesn’t.
“Headmistress,” Harry continued, “I... This is a decision that belongs to me. Lately... I realised how little I had decided for myself up until now. I don’t want to rush into things anymore. I want to—to
“Oh, god— Malfoy,” Harry gasps as Malfoy’s arse twitches around his cock. He’s so tight, and Harry can’t hold back. His balls tighten, his cock aches and throbs as his own orgasm crests, and with a long grunt, he lets go. Hand digging in Malfoy’s hip, he thrusts hard, once, twice, and empties himself inside Malfoy, eyes screwed shut, balls tight against Malfoy’s.
Draco looked up. Harry was so close. He had angled his body towards Draco, one leg folded under him, the other dangling from the side of the sofa.
“Well. I suppose we ought to get going as well,” he says. Then, flashing a smile at Draco and Harry, “Best leave Draco alone with his new conquest.”
“His aura was never pretty to begin with,” she continued as though Draco’s sunny afternoon hadn’t taken a darker shade. “It was always murky and dark. Not like yours.”
“If I’m sure?” Malfoy laughs, pushing Harry’s hair out of his face. “Oh, Harry. How I’ve dreamed of it. I’ve dreamed of your long, thick cock in my arse. Bet I can feel that monster all the way to my throat.”
Harry leans his weight onto Malfoy’s back, reaching round for Malfoy’s cock and fisting it. Malfoy must have cast a lubricating spell there, too, because Harry finds the skin already slick, and— oh, so silky over the strained hardness of Malfoy’s erection.
McGonagall studied them over her cup of tea. If she was surprised by Harry’s gesture towards Draco, she didn’t let it show.
At the end of the room stands Draco, his back against the record shelves, his wand drawn and pointed at Smith. His eyes are following Smith’s movements, haughtiness and contempt written all over his face. It’s only when he sees Harry and Scorpius on the threshold that his stance falters. Unnoticed by the Aurors and Smith, Harry takes his wand out, hoping Draco can hold his own, hoping Scorpius can stay quiet.
Harry pushes his tongue in his cheek, ponders his next words. “I think… I think I just need to know.”
“Let me guess,” Draco had heard Blaise’s voice in the distance of their Parisian flat, “The most ridiculous man on earth?”
“Don’t let us keep you,” Pansy drawled. “Unless you want to help us finish him?” She looked the snowman up and down, hands on her hips. “He is bloody fit, isn’t he?”
“Since we’re supposed to help each other decide what our ideal jobs would be, may I ask you a question?”
Later, Scorpius comes back to say goodnight. He’s in his dinosaur pyjamas, Ernestina waiting for him with a cup of cocoa in her hand. The only person Scorpius kisses goodnight in the room is his father. Pansy smiles toothily and Hermione’s mouth softens in a silent ‘aww’.
At that, Potter laughed. “That leaves the socially awkward and sexually frustrated part. I knew we had things in common.”
“Part of me wishes I didn’t.” Draco lets out a rueful laugh. “But this might actually go faster if you’re here to help.”
sounds about right, Harry thinks, remembering Draco’s cleaning charm and feeling his ears go hot. After everything, then, he’s feeling shy again. Bashful. Tentative. He approaches Draco’s desk, slides two fingers over the side of the mahogany table.
Draco knew his face was probably redder than a Howler at this point, so he gave up trying to hide. He dropped his hands in his lap with a sigh.
“She was just telling me how you met,” Harry says. “I was wondering… why did you decide to come back to London?”
“I think there’s something you need to explain,” Harry says, unfolding the parchment and holding it out for Draco to see, “about this.”
Draco walks up to the Aurors, who take his wand and cast a binding spell on his wrists while Harry watches, powerless and horrified. Auror Boyle flicks her wand at Zacharias Smith’s unconscious form and mutters,
“Maybe we should let him go now!” Draco interjected, interrupting her. “The ravens are gone, he’s safe, isn’t he?”
And everyone has heard: when Draco’s eyes flick to the other guests and Harry remembers they’re not alone, he finds his friends and Draco’s watching them, their eyes a fraction wider.
“Oh, god, you like it,” Malfoy says between two panting breaths, “you like it too.” His expression is open and awestruck, unlike anything Harry’s ever seen on his face, and god, yes, Harry likes it, loves it. Loves Malfoy for it. Malfoy arches into his touch like a cat in heat. “Touch me,” he pleads, “touch my cock, I want to come with your cock in me, come on, Potter—”
“God, you’re the worst,” Potter murmured, his voice full of spite. “I forgot just how rude and self-absorbed you are.”
“And I wouldn’t have wanted you to be. Merlin, that was the fucking of the decade. Thank fuck I’m lying down, or I would have fallen off my feet.”
As required by the betting rules, she successfully made Plinius Thompson, Head of the Department of Mysteries and blandest person to ever walk this earth, sing
Harry turns to look at Malfoy, one eyebrow raised in mute inquiry. Malfoy is watching Ernestina, eyes narrowed.
Gabrielle Delacour, their nineteen year old intern, who had never declared her level of queerness, but who had come from France to London to learn English and had got on with the rest of the team like a
she calls out in the foyer. She sounds like the type of person whose speech needs every other word stressed and italicized. “Your
Draco watched Harry stroke the top of Tamara's head, a fond fatherly smile stealing on to his boyfriend's face. He rolled his eyes as Harry cooed at her and tickled her belly.
“I can,” Harry says finally. “I might be making the worst mistake of my career, but I trust you. Whatever goddamned intuition it is… I trust you. Just — let me stay with you.”
He stops, giving Harry a meaningful look that sends him back to Hogwarts — to sixth year, and a seemingly broken Vanishing Cabinet that Draco had managed to repair against all odds. “I didn’t know, back then, that it would also help me get my life in check and back on track…” He runs his hand through his hair, pushes a damp lock behind his ear. “Ernestina needed money to start the business she had dreamt of. And she needed a human to embody her project. Obviously, it was impossible for a house elf to start a Muggle business: she would have had to meet with the entire production chain — patent authorities, suppliers, production sites, shops, advertising agencies — and you can imagine how things would have gone if she’d shown up at a meeting with non-magical folk. I was the original investor in Nesting — I gave Ernestina the little money I had left, convinced Pansy, Blaise, Astoria to invest as well — and I became the company’s spokesperson. And when the business launched… Merlin, Harry. It was an overnight success. I knew Ernestina had had a brilliant idea, and our designs were solid, but I never expected it to…
Eyes wide, he stumbles to the jacket he carelessly threw across the back of a chair when he walked in. It’s the one he was wearing that day — one he’d forgotten about, what with all the developments the case brought to his life, had left hanging in his cupboard for months. He slips his hand inside the inner pocket, feels around for a folded piece of parchment, finds it.
Potter’s breath hovers over Draco’s face. Draco melts against the door. Summons the last bit of his pride.
Harry slid his gloved hand into Draco’s. “For your sake, or theirs?” He nodded toward their friends. “I think they’ve an inkling that I like you.”
“Leaving so soon?” asks Hermione, who’s just slid in the spot next to Harry. She sounds more teasing than surprised.
He’s only hit with how self-righteous he sounds when Malfoy snorts in response. “Why, I didn’t know you cared.”
When Draco arrives at the Ministry, escorted by the Aurors, they let him name a solicitor and make a firecall before they sit him down for an interrogation.
laugh. It was so unexpected that for a second it was like sitting next to an entirely different person. Malfoy never laughed with Harry. He sniggered, or gave that mocking little snort that had been the background soundtrack of every one of Harry’s Potions classes at Hogwarts. He didn’t
“That’s not it, though, is it?” She touches Harry’s elbow with gentle fingers. “Is there anything you’re not telling us, Harry?”
Head Auror Smith closed the file and rested her hand on the red cardboard cover. The air was heavy with finality. Harry squirmed in his chair. Next to him, he could feel waves of restlessness emanating from Malfoy. Malfoy’s hand was clenched around his knee to stop his leg from jiggling.
The words were so chaste when Harry’s hand was so obscene, dipping down Draco’s pants and grabbing Draco’s aching cock with already expert fingers. Draco nearly blacked out from the need to be touched like this.
Harry hadn’t been sure what to make of the Draco Malfoy he’d read about in the DMLE folders, especially as the files also contained more…
A happy bark, and Balzac barges into the foyer, skidding to a halt in front of Ernestina and wagging his tail excitedly. He runs towards Harry and jumps on him, barking some more. Harry ignores Ernestina’s disapproving scowl and laughs, scratching the dog’s ears.
In the darkness, on his knees, he felt like he could tell him anything. “I’m going to suck your thick, hard cock until you come in my mouth, Harry, and I’m going to love it. I’m going to swallow your come and I’m going to love it. Unless you want to come on my face. We can do that, if you prefer.”
“Really?” The tiny flicker in Harry’s eyes was gone, elusive like a Snitch, and Draco felt heat flare in his gut. He took a step closer, moving into Harry’s space. “Why is that, Harry? Why don’t you give a shite? Why was it that I never heard from you after—” His hands were itching to grab Harry’s collar. He let out a shaky breath. “All you wanted back then was to get fucked, was that it? One night with me, no strings attached, just the thrill of getting defiled by me, of getting your arse plowed by dirty, tainted Draco Malfoy? I bet it felt good, Harry. I bet it felt
“Down, Balzac,” Blaise is laughing, all the while holding the dog’s paw in his hand and patting his head. “I can’t believe Narcissa hasn’t found a way to poison you yet.” The dog barks and lets go of Blaise to pounce on Pansy, who lifts her hands with a screech.
“I do.” Draco lifts a hand to his face, rubs his eye again. It’s too dark for Harry to tell if he’s crying. “This is how I feel.”
“Yeah,” Ron smiled wistfully, “‘S’not like Harry had many opportunities to see the world before now.”
Harry doesn’t know the first thing about ‘the arts.’ He hadn’t been given the opportunity to learn, had he? The Dursleys’ idea of culture had been the opening credits of ‘Big Break.’ Growing up, Dudley’d had a Walkman and hundreds of cassettes, but Harry hadn’t been allowed to so much as look at them. Hogwarts hadn’t offered art classes, unless you counted Professor Trelawney’s Divination classes as an art form. And anyway, Harry had been too busy thwarting a murderous madman to worry about his lack of education in that area. Maybe that’s why Hermione had thought The Royal Opera House was a good cause to champion. She’d always had Harry’s best interests in mind, and she’d told him the ballet was a good place to start cultivating a more sophisticated mind. Ballets had stories, music, and — Hermione had added that last detail with a wink that had made Harry cringe — nice-looking ladies in tights.
Perhaps it was why he didn’t react to the news in any other way than, “Am I allowed to see you still?”
If we really only had an hour left to live.” He lifted what he hoped was a nonchalant shoulder. “Why not, you know?”
about you.” His eyes are pleading when he adds, “The rest… Having to keep yet another secret... I can work around that.”
Draco stood and wiped his chin with his sleeve. All he had to do was yank Harry’s trousers and pants further down his thighs in one swift move and settle right behind Harry. He braced his hand at Harry’s side, against the countertop. His erection caught against Harry’s crease, now slick with Draco’s own spit, and they both shivered.
Walk down the stairs, quiet, careful. Balzac limps next to me. The house is very still. Sleeping. Magic like slumber. The light in the foyer is pale white. (Lovely. Cold. Soft in my eyes.) The green scent of the hydrangeas, freshly cut. No clatters and rattles from the kitchen yet. (Nestine still asleep.)
under her breath. The pushchair lifts a few inches above the floor, barely disturbing the baby who gives Harry a placid look as his mother carries his pushchair to the kitchen.
“This is worse than the telling-off,” Harry had put his face in his hands and moaned into his bowl of soup.
Harry stood in the middle of the group, cheeks pink, eyes crinkled with lighthearted laughter, head thrown back. He was
“Why do you care about it so much?” says Malfoy. His shoulders are tense, and he doesn’t sound sleepy. It sounds brittle. A little bitter. “It’s just an old ball.”
seen the sign on Muggle pharmacies, Potter?” Draco sits next to him. His expression is suddenly unreadable, and Harry’s not sure he likes it.
Harry’s on his back, on the floor, a heap of Draco Malfoy crushing him. It technically wouldn’t be unpleasurable, if there weren’t also five women staring at them from the threshold of the DLF office, some of them gasping in shock, some others smothering giggles behind their hands.
Harry thinks. This time, thankfully, he keeps the words to himself. He just scoots his arse further down the seat, casting a nervous glance at the other guests in the darkened opera box.
“Why— do you have to be like this?” Potter says through gritted teeth. His voice is low, private, like he wished to be addressing Draco alone. Anger — good old-fashioned, Potter-triggered anger — bursts in Draco’s chest.
Ever since that first sighting at the Ministry cafeteria, Harry keeps noticing Malfoy around the Ministry. It’s uncanny, how Harry can walk into a room and know that Malfoy is there before he even sets eyes on him. He will step out of the Floo and into the Atrium and the back of his neck will prickle, and Malfoy will be there, passing by the tall fountain, chatting with one of his DLF colleagues while carrying boxes of ownerless magical objects. He’ll be washing his hands in the men’s loos and
Draco felt his cheeks pink. He cleared his throat. “This is how the Prothimioscope works in a nutshell: it spins as long as the author of the article or, in the case of an interview, their respondent, is writing or speaking of their own free will. Readers have become wary of the press. There was so much misinformation during the war—even before it, if you think about it. Today, the Prothimioscope acts like a warranty. Readers are at least assured that the people involved are fully consenting to what is written.”
“Oi!” Harry grins and grabs him by the shoulders on instinct, “what are you doing here? Trying to fight me wandless? Forgot I know Krav Maga?”
“We could have, yet when I suggested it, you whinged about rumpling your dress robes. Besides, we’re in London! And I
And Draco wouldn’t give him the pleasure to look impressed. Not until the locker room door closed behind them.
It takes Harry a while to get himself presentable again. There’s not enough tissue in the visitors bathroom of the Eldridge House, and probably not enough water in the tap either. He wets his palms and smoothes his hair back for the tenth time, leans in to examine his reflection in the mirror.
Draco looks at Harry over his shoulder. Just here to get some running clothes and go change in his rooms. He looks expectant, slightly puzzled, like it’s Draco who’s lost the plot. Like he hasn’t torn Draco’s world apart, turned it on its head. Always reminding Draco of the harsh reality of their situations, the unbridgeable gap between the Golden boy and the ex-Death Eater, the spy and the suspect, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
They both stood hurriedly, their eyes trained on the trapdoor as if it could disappear if they so much as blinked.
“Oh, bugger,” Ron whispers. “It’s the Harrows — current Directors of the Board of Hogwarts. Merlin, I’ve got to be on my best behaviour. But there’s still time for you to run.” He hands Harry his glass of wine.
Draco is quietly putting his clothes in order when Harry’s eyes fall on the parchments strewn across the floor, the rolls previously neatly stacked on the desk thrown off balance by their fucking. His mind flashes to a similar scene from months ago — Harry walking in the empty office, rolls of parchment falling to the floor, one of them catching his attention.
The last one, Harry thinks, sounds a bit far-fetched. It’s almost like the Ministry employees have a competition for the most titillating, scandalous gossip about Draco Malfoy they can find.
The back garden of the Burrow was just like the adjoining house: sundry and disordered, with pink rhododendron bushes poking out of a snow drift in one corner, ceramic garden gnomes dressed in homemade Christmas jumpers in another, beds of purple and yellow pansies trapped under a Climate charm along the fence. And just like the house, the garden seemed decked for Christmas, the freshly fallen snow glittering in the moonlight, the warm lights from the inside of the house bathing the scene with a tender, comfortable homeliness despite the cold.
Until Harry’s eyes stop on Draco’s left forearm resting against his side, the pale skin and faded Dark Mark exposed by his rolled-up sleeves. Draco hears Harry’s sharp intake of breath and freezes.
Malfoy’s face was turned to the north, his white-blond eyebrows knit together. With a sinking feeling, Harry followed his gaze.
Scorpius doesn’t move, except for the lateral movement of his fingers on the keys, back and forth, back and forth, as if he’s trying to rub them clean. There’s a frightening intensity in him, his magic rolling off him in waves like an overflowing pool. Harry wonders if this is what he looked to his aunt Petunia when he was seven — this vast unknown of a child, magic spilling around him with so little control that even Muggles felt it. Then again, he wasn’t like Scorpius… he wasn’t autistic, and he wasn’t freakishly gifted—
Malfoy leans his chin on Harry’s shoulder with all the proprietary ease of a housecat. “Yes,” he breathes, like he relishes the word. “Tell me what you want, Potter.”
Harry takes a step towards him. Lays his hand in the small of Draco’s back. The muscles underneath Draco’s shirt shiver at his touch.
Harry. Use it. Buy them a chess set, buy them a new quill, buy them cooking books. Your gifts won’t bring back the dead, but they will remind the living that you’re still here for them.”
“You’re right.” Potter set his glass down with a decisive thud. “So what have you been up to, Malfoy?”
“Oi, where you goin’?” Seamus Finnigan called from near the fireplace. A little group of Eighth Years had gathered on the sofa and chairs and were watching Ron Weasley beat Dean Thomas at Wizarding Chess. The entire common room glittered with silver and gold ornaments, enchanted snow and twinkling fairy lights. Hannah Abbott’s CD player spilled Muggle Christmas songs. Odd as they sounded, they contributed nicely to the haphazard, festive holiday cheer of the room.
Greg pushes the chair back and stands. Last week, he’d moved his things out of the attic rooms he’d occupied while under Draco’s employ. The boxes are now crowding Millicent’s flat. If Draco knows her at all, she must be thoroughly annoyed. He pictures her tapping her toe, waiting for the moment she and Greg move to Australia. Millicent starts a teaching assistant job at the Wizarding University of Melbourne at the end of the month. She’s waited for this opportunity for years.
and his whole face feels hot. Draco, though… Draco is a debauched sight to behold. Cheeks pink. Lips swollen from Harry’s bites and kisses. A small tear at the collar of his t-shirt. And his hair — his usually perfectly, artfully coiffed hair — is a mess now, fringe falling in his eyes, sweaty strands sticking to his temples, the rest of it in complete disarray. Harry can’t help the tightening of his chest when he realises it. That he did this to Draco. That Draco said he could be his.
“Goodnight, Draco, sleep well,” his mother said, kissing his cheek as she passed by his armchair. “And you too, Harry.” Astonished, Draco watched Harry stand and Narcissa lift her head to peck him on the cheek. “Happy Christmas, dear,” she told him. “Take good care of my son.”
“Mate, I don’t mind what you do,” Ron laughed and lifted his hands, leaning away from him. Draco smirked. “You do whatever you want as long as you keep Harry happy and his heart in one piece.”
“Thank you, Ernestina.” All the while, Malfoy’s appraising gaze follows his movements. At last, the little boy seems to notice Harry’s presence in the room. Eyes widening, he wraps his arms around his father’s leg and scurries around him as if to hide.
“Do you see me complaining?” Draco lifts a defiant eyebrow. “I know why you did it. I know you didn’t know what the spell did. Fucking let it go now.”
“Scorpius sat at the piano one day, and started playing. He taught himself, with a little help from me. That’s all he does. He plays the piano, he goes to school, he goes to his therapist appointments. Sometimes we go for a walk in the park. Most of the time though — he’s here, with me. Playing, always playing. For us it seems — unbelievable. For him, learning music is like learning another language. At this age, he can still do it seamlessly.”
Or at least label your explicit correspondence to your boyfriend as ‘PERSONAL’. Please remember I also read the memos. And now I’m scarred for life.
in his hundred lives had made him want to cross the border. He turned to face Harry. “I’m glad I met you, Potter.”
Leaning on one elbow, Malfoy waves his wand towards his back and mutters a rapid succession of spells. Harry only recognises one or two: he’s never needed more than a few of these in the past, he reminds himself with a thrill of anticipation. The slide of his cock between Malfoy’s cheeks is suddenly smoother. Wetter. His legs tremble with how much he wants to do this.
“Yes. And I’m sorry I had to find out the way I did, but…” Harry glances at him. “Maybe I feel the same,” he admits, barely above a whisper.
Harry met his pale grey gaze. His eyes were worried, so different from mere hours ago when they had glinted dark with passion.
Because that’s another catch, isn’t it? Ron and Hermione might stop speaking to him altogether if he tells them he’d hooked up with the person who’d spent his school years bullying them. Harry might have come to terms with it; might have seen Malfoy in another light. He might have seen the man who’d been forced into a life he had no choice over, and who regretted his actions dearly. But his friends don’t know all that. To Hermione, Malfoy is nothing but the boy who’d been relentlessly mean to her at school. To Ron, he’s the kind of pureblood git the Weasley family despises, in addition to a low-life thief the Aurors still haven't managed to catch.
After the Hogwarts Express had left them in Hogsmeade, after he had stomped on Potter’s face for being a nosy bastard, he’d found her on the platform. He felt like a raft floating to shore after the Flood. She took him in her arms and squeezed. “You never answered my owls,” she said against his jumper. “I thought it was over.”
Harry’s expression softens, and Malfoy’s eyes flash when he mistakes it for something it’s not. Pity. Condescendance. Merlin only knows how people usually react to that sort of news.
“I’m glad you’re getting to talk to all sorts of interesting people, Hermione,” Harry says. “But I’m fine being on my own.”
Harry knows better than to reply, knows better than to lash out, although he’s dying to, like a wild animal caught in a snare. He manages to find a gap between the men and their cameras, and sidles through.
“They’ve gone to visit Grandma Molly and Grandpa Arthur, actually,” Hermione tells him. “And I wanted to see you.”
“He already has a shiny thing of his own,” Luna said, examining the ring again. Jeff squirmed in her hands. He seemed to realise he had just been adopted by a human.
pining after a war hero around here.” She crossed her arms and stared expectantly. “Spill it, Draco.”
And in turn, it makes it much easier to observe the habits of the people he’s missioned to spy on. In this case, Draco and everyone in his orbit.
“I’ve come to appreciate them early on in life,” Harry says. He hopes he manages to sound earnest and not sarcastic. Next to him, Ron lets out a sound that’s equal parts cough and whimper. Harry’s going to need wine to keep his acting up to Hermione’s standards.
“She really is,” Luna added with a soft expression on her face, resting her hand on Ginny’s. Ron shook his head with a smile.
It’s just that Harry doesn’t really want to let time heal that particular wound. Because it feels too good. It burned too bright.
“You thought she was nothing but a house-elf, didn’t you?” Draco lifts an eyebrow, and it’s not a kind expression. “Most people do. They fail to remember house-elves have magic we humans can’t fathom or detect. Ernestina’s never entirely trusted you, and she convinced me I should do a little investigating of my own.”
Pansy, on the other hand, had been another kettle of fish. She’d already known why Draco was firecalling her, as she had reminded him by brandishing a copy of the
“Like zis?” Gabrielle asks with a timid bat of her lashes. She drops a hair pin, bends to grab it, and lifts back up, her curtain of golden hair elegantly swept to the side of her neck.
“I was… afraid.” Malfoy tucks a strand of hair behind his ear. “Of what would happen if I let myself fall for you.”
“Hi Harry,” Hermione smiles when she sees him. Her grin turns teasing. “Are you the butler, in addition to being the bodyguard?”
They walked down the stairs, out the main door and into the snow covered grounds. Draco glanced at the Forbidden Forest, standing as dark and eerily still as it always did. He followed Pansy’s lead down the path to the lake. Someone—Hagrid, perhaps—had cleared it of snow.
“Draco, darling, don’t forget that Potter might be there. You wouldn’t pass on a chance to see him in person, would you? Not after all these years tracking his every move and his every date in the tabloids?”
“Oh, don’t play coy, Potter.” Draco had lifted an eyebrow, clearly amused. “You know what it’s about. Granger contacted me several weeks ago. Well.
It's near impossible to dwell on Scorpius for long. The very thought of his son being hurt again steals Draco's breath — he has to stop, one hand on a tree trunk, another clutching the place where his heart beats painfully in his chest. He hopes Harry found a way to help Scorpius out of his fit, that he managed to tame his magic down enough to avoid another catastrophe. Draco can’t think of what tomorrow will be like, and the days after that. He can’t believe he let it happen — let those bastards force their way into his home, beat up his house-elf, hex his dog, and scare his little boy so badly he literally exploded the room and passed out. He takes a big, heaving gulp of air.
“Oh,” Draco covered his mouth, half-hoping to hide his horrified, delighted grin. “Oh, we did. Salazar, we’re the worst friends ever.”
Instead of stepping away in disgust, Harry grinned. “That’s okay. The ‘not best person’ part, I mean. You’re no angel, Draco, but neither am I. No matter what the newspapers may say about me.” Dumbfounded, Draco couldn’t do anything but stare. Harry had no way of knowing about his true nature, of course,but him admitting he wasn’t perfect—when he was the
Harry returns the Mediwitch’s silent question as she gathers the pieces of gauze and empty vials of potions on a silver tray, ready to let Harry get some rest. He’s already had a long visit from his friends and family today. The Healers usually don’t knock and wait. “Come in,” he says out loud, and stops short when he sees Draco walk in.
Harry walks to the bed, sits near Draco, just within reach. He doesn’t touch him, just lets him get used to his presence, to the sound of his breathing. Then he says, carefully, “You could have told me.”
“Fine. I’ll try not to be so… sensitive. About the topic. Around you. But you —” Malfoy lifts his chin, and it’s like he’s marching on Harry without moving from his spot, "—you’re going to have to watch what you say… the things you say about me. About Scorpius.”
The fact that she achieved her goal by telling him it was the incantation for a new spell she was developing makes me wish she had Sorted Slytherin. Sadly, she’s a Gryffindor through and through. Let’s just say her recklessness has its advantages on occasion.
Draco nearly tripped. It felt like swallowing a bucket of ice while simultaneously bursting into flames.
Harry’s eyes widen — his only concession to surprise. Draco has to admire his guts: the man isn’t thrown by much. “Sure,” he says, voice trailing. “I just… don’t have running clothes here.”
“No,” Draco tells him, feeling a little faint. It’s cold, and the low winter sun seems to turn the world hazy and weird, narrowing it down to Harry’s bright emerald gaze and the lip he’s worrying between his teeth, waiting for Draco’s response. “No, that’s exactly what happened,” he admits.
But the back of his hand brushed Harry’s, and he didn’t pull away. Harry smiled all the way to their destination.
she’s right because she’s always right about everything else!” Draco snaps back. Then smirks and points an accusing finger at Penelope. “Except this time!”
“They’re gone,” Malfoy says, voice rough. His stormy eyes never leave Harry’s. Harry’s hard cock glistens with saliva, an inch from his face. “Be as loud as you want.” He leans in and licks the leaking tip of Harry’s cock with a soft tongue.
if he was completely honest with himself. The very concept of Harry loving Draco forever was utterly preposterous and improbable.
“I’m sorry, I thought you’d brought me here to check that I was all right. I didn’t brace myself for an interrogation.”
Daddy said the way things started with Harry was less than auspicious. (I had to go look up the word. Now I use
Because I’m getting to know you. Because I’m starting to like you. Because my instincts scream at me that you’re innocent, and my instincts have almost never been wrong.
There was a faint line between Harry’s eyebrows, as if saying that pained him. The sight of it rankled.
They break for air, just an inch of space between their lips, foreheads pressed together — Draco’s already panting, desperate, Harry’s hot breath bathing his face.
“The Ministry is trying to build a case against you. They have for years. The supposed illegal business under the cover of Caduceus… They think the initial funds came from criminal activity, which you could possibly be the source of.”
Harry leaned in so Draco could hear him better. He was starting to suspect Harry enjoyed being close to him. The thought sent a little jolt to his gut, and humiliatingly, he felt his cock twitch in his pants at the contact of Harry’s breath on the side of his neck.
“Come here,” he said, pulling Malfoy back down and on top of him. The contact of skin against naked skin stole his breath away. He squirmed under Malfoy’s hips. “Help me out of these, will you?”
attacked me for it. There were a few articles published about how I was wasting my time and energy saving animals when there were people who had lost their homes, who had sustained grave injuries, who were missing loved ones. As if one cause was exclusive to another.” She raised her eyes to Draco, and he nodded for her to continue. “I didn’t read the articles. I’ve never paid attention to what people said about me. I see my work as part of a big picture that everyone will benefit from in the end. I can only paint a small part of it—but I can do it well, and meaningfully. That’s what kept me going. That’s what helped me push away memories of flashing curses and burnt flesh. Defining the role I wanted to play in our post-war world was my way of moving on.”
Harry falls forward, his legs still bracketing Draco’s, one hand braced next to Draco’s face, his cock hard and heavy as it hangs between his legs. He takes it in his hand and starts fisting it. His frantic breath hits Draco’s face, a soft whine on each exhale. He’s not holding back anymore, and he’s so fucking hot, Draco almost regrets coming first as he lies there, surrounded by Harry, mad with the feel of him, waiting for Harry’s orgasm to mark his body again. He turns his head, nuzzles Harry’s hand next to him. Licks the soft skin between thumb and forefinger, touches his lips to Harry’s thumb, sucks it into his mouth. Harry gasps, the strength of this breath hitting Draco’s cheek, and then his entire body goes still and he comes, the heat of it splashing across Draco’s soft cock and heaving chest, his slick fist moving over his prick for a few long seconds. Draco drinks him in, the sounds escaping Harry’s mouth, the look on his face, the tension in his shoulders just before it releases, the pumps of Harry’s hand still enclosing his spent cock. When he feels like he can move again, Draco reaches up. Wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders and brings him down against him, Harry’s trembling body covering his.
Feels, with a sense of horrible inevitability, his body go hard where Malfoy’s sharp hips cut into his.
Malfoy shakes his head with a disbelieving half-smile. “Merlin, Potter. I’m regretting my decision to hire you already.”
Luna’s pale eyes were fixed on Draco, waiting for more. He sat straighter, gazing at the spinning device.
They grip at each other, pushing each other in the small space of the cupboard, groaning and grinning like school kids. Until Harry’s back hits the door with a dull
Unsurprisingly, despite Draco’s instructions, Ernestina positively cooked a feast. The table is sagging under delicious-smelling dishes. Harry spots some of his favourite English classics, but a few plates sport continental influences — French, Spanish, possibly Italian. There’s a tray of cheeses that’s larger than Harry’s coffee table at Grimmauld Place. His mouth waters.
“I’ve no idea what I’m doing. I don’t want to hurt you,” Harry whispers, and Malfoy’s answer is a fond roll of the eyes.
Harry stares at him in the dark, chest rising and falling with his breath. “What? To say it? I don't care.”
And Draco wonders, not for the first time since Harry Potter showed up in his life again, exactly how worth it is playing this game against Harry, at the cost of endangering his heart.
“Merlin, Greg, Millicent will have your head! And mine, when she finds out you stayed late talking to me.”
Potter is rooted to the spot, his red Auror robes still swishing around him. His jaw is slack and his throat is working — and his eyes. His eyes are fixed on Draco’s arse.
Harry’s exploration of the Eldridge House leads him to a dimly-lit corridor that ends with a tall door made of beautifully carved wood. The door’s slightly ajar. It piques Harry’s curiosity: all the other exhibition rooms are wide open. He’s not sure if it means this one is private, but he sees no sign on the door that confirms it, so he pushes it open wider and steps in.
“Sorry,” he tells her quickly. “I don’t doubt it. It’s just… most house-elves I’ve known didn’t share much with their masters.”
“My Floo address,” Draco says without stopping what he’s doing. A stubborn strand of blond hair keeps falling on his forehead. He dips the comb under the tap and runs it in his hair again, leaving a wet trail in it. He looks like an ad for some sexy cologne, and Harry tells him so. Draco laughs at that, and catches Harry’s eyes in the mirror. “Thank you. And now you know how to reach me.”
Withdrawing his fingers, he settled over Harry, slicked his cock with lube with three pumps of his fist and lined it with Harry’s waiting hole. Before he pushed in, he looked up at Harry with a small smile.
Harry takes a minute to comprehend what Draco just told him. Children’s equipment. A small venture that turned into an unexpected business hit. The hints Harry had caught for months of the unlikely friendship between Draco and his house-elf.
“For what exactly, Potter?” Draco’s tone is several degrees colder than Harry's ever heard it. He’s sitting very still, and the use of his last name is worse than if he’d slapped Harry in the face. Harry represses a shiver.
with the Minister’s secretary. If Harry ever made Dewey feel like he was used for sex, the young man could make his life hell—and his visits to the Ministry ten times more unpleasant than they already are.
“More,” he asked, hoping he was still far from begging. Malfoy seemed like a relatively considerate lover, but he’d not like to give him cause to gloat if he could avoid it.
Malfoy sinks more comfortably in his seat, hands on the armrests, and returns his gaze to the dancers on stage. The music is as graceful as it is emotional and loud, mercifully drowning Harry's own cacophonous emotions. He and Malfoy lapse into silence for a while, watching the ballerinas swirl and sway like swans on dark waters.
“Please, Mother, your presence never is. Scorpius is going to be delighted, and so am I. In fact, Ernestina will go wake him up in a second, as soon as she’s finished putting breakfast together. Let me check on her.”
She doesn’t respond for a while, immersed in her task of scrambling eggs in a pan. Before long, she sets the pan of golden scrambled eggs aside, waves her hand over it as a stasis charm settles, and she turns back to Harry, wiping her hands on her apron.
bad idea. Just the practicalities alone. Dragons grow to be 20ft tall for Merlin’s sake!” Harry tried to interrupt but Draco held a stern hand up. “They eat the equivalent of three goats a day, and unless you’ve forgotten this tiny detail,
Harry crumples the pieces of parchment in his fist and sets them aflame with a furious Incendio. The ashes scatter across the floor of the lift of Caduceus and he Vanishes them with another sharp swish of his wand. He puts his hand on the wall of the lift, exhaling harshly. Under the fluorescent light of the lift, the scar on the back of his hand glows an angry, blotchy white.
He sees Hermione open her mouth just before the fire flashes green and he steps into it, disappearing into the whirling void of the Floo network.
He stopped in the middle of the corridor, facing Malfoy whose expression turned from smug to curious.
Another sudden gust of wind, ice-cold and fierce, whipped their faces. It seemed to slap Malfoy into action. He turned to look at Harry, face serious but for the tiniest smirk slowly lifting the corner of his mouth. “Last one to reach the shelter is a bag of putrescent Flobberworms?”
And Harry’s thoughts spin and spin, always landing back on the image of Malfoy’s grey eyes on him. There’s a hot, bright, pulsing ball of feelings lodged in Harry’s chest, and he can’t seem to shake it off, no matter what he does.
Malfoy obliged, sliding a second finger in on the next pump. He lowered himself on top of Harry, the breathtaking sensation of his warm skin on his, of his cock slotting against Harry’s. There was only his hand moving between them, slowly opening up his hole, preparing him for his cock.
He sets the quill in its case just as he hears movement in the cupboard. He puts a hand on his desk, lets the cool glass steady him. Then he looks up, and finds Harry on the threshold of the room, standing still, watching Draco.
Harry couldn’t help but catalogue every detail of Malfoy’s appearance: the hair (longer than he wore it at Hogwarts, cut just below his chin, a graceful white-blond sweep across his forehead); the hands (nails painted black, rings on every finger except the thumbs); the piercings (one in his left eyebrow, one in his lip, several in his ears); and the clothes… Merlin.
to go the way the day is going. Harry steps closer, Balzac moving aside to make room for him next to Scorpius’ seat. “And it doesn’t make me uncomfortable at all. So you don’t have to worry about it.”
“Alright?” he asked, as much to check that Harry had reacted in surprise and not in repulsion as to make sure he would be allowed to continue.
“I told you you had five minutes,” Penelope says, hands behind her back, walking a slow circle around them. “In my great magnanimity, I gave you ten.” She stops and studies them from above. “I assume that gave you ample time to sort your… quarrel?”
“I need to look after my son. The Healers say it’s going to take weeks for his magic to recover.” He glances at Harry. “And I need… I need time to recover, myself. I need time to ponder my options. I don’t know what to make of your honesty, Potter.”
“Hi.” Harry’s word comes out in a breath. He watches as the Mediwitch scutters away and Draco makes his way towards his hospital bed, the same circumspect stance in his body as in the tone of his voice. He settles in the chair at the foot of Harry’s bed, and Harry swings his legs back onto the bed and under the covers so he faces him. He hates that he looks tired and vulnerable in his pale green patient robes, with his left arm wrapped close to his chest. He hates that Kingsley sees it as an opportunity… something for Harry to use in order to strengthen his bond with the
Still laughing, Hermione unfolds the pushchair in one click and sits a babbling, smiling Hugo in it.
“Oh, Merlin, will you shut up!” He put his hand over her mouth, muffling her cackle. Above his palm, her eyes sparkled with glee. He narrowed his eyes at her. “Pansy. How much do you know?”
When he recovers, Draco drops a light kiss on Harry’s damp nape. “I’ll let you fix your clothing now,” he murmurs. And adds, as Harry tenses under him, “I’m just stepping away. I’m not…
Dinner was eaten in loud conversation, silverware clinking on plates and kids asking a steady stream of questions starting with
Harry gets Draco naked and pressed down into the sofa cushions and Draco barely notices how it happens. Harry buries his head in Draco’s neck, trailing slow kisses, biting, licking. Everything about it is slow, attentive, like Harry is listening, waiting for Draco’s cues to continue or stop. Draco is so entranced with the thought of Harry — impulsive, headstrong Harry — holding back for his sake, that he forgets about everything else. When the hard length of Harry’s cock slides against his thigh, hot and maddening, Draco’s breath catches. Oh, yes, he’d forgotten… about
The blue light flickered at the tip of Harry’s wand and barely took off, floating just over their heads and emitting the palest, saddest light Harry had ever seen. When his gaze returned to Malfoy, he was wearing the exasperated expression Harry expected to find on these pointy features.
Those cool grey eyes as they met Harry’s across the dancefloor. The way they widened a fraction, the way Malfoy’s pale cheeks pinked, his expressive face betraying his emotions as clearly as it had ten years ago…
“I am more than okay,” Malfoy said, his voice suddenly quiet, raspy. It sounded like the distant rumble of an earthquake, and Harry felt himself shiver in spite of himself. “I can’t
“Malfoy—” Harry warns, squirming under him. Malfoy’s erection is a hard length pressed against his own, the thin joggers leaving nothing to the imagination. That’s still too many layers of clothes between them, and Harry wants them gone. “Less talking, more undressing. Unless you want me to come from just this.”
“Yes, I’m sure I would,” Malfoy smirks, and there’s a sardonic glint in his eye. “Is that what you think of me?”
“Oh my god,” Harry mutters. “You bossy dick.” He comes closer, slaps a hand on Draco’s arse cheek, caresses it slowly, close to the crease. Draco whines again, embarrassingly loud, and Harry slips his fingers in the mess there, rubbing come and lube across Draco’s arsehole. Then he pushes two fingers in and Draco cries out against the desk, eyes wide, hand stuttering over his cock.
“Fine,” he says, happy to give up his callow grudge already. “I’m sorry I left in a huff yesterday. That was very childish of me, and I felt like an arse afterwards. I know you and Ron mean well, and… you’re probably not wrong.”
At the time, he still had hope. Perhaps Kingsley and Ron were wrong; perhaps Malfoy would refuse to meet Harry or interview him for a bodyguard job.
“Yes, you absolute berk, you brilliant idiot, I did.” Draco runs a hand through the hair at the back of his neck, his wan cheeks tinting with a light flush. “I’m authorised people, apparently.”
he thinks, the words on a wry, disillusioned loop. He’ll make sure Smith goes down in flames if it’s the last thing he does.

“And that's definitely my grandfather’s gold clasp.” Draco jabbed his finger towards the slipper but recoiled when Tamara bared her tiny pointy teeth with a high-pitched growl.
Harry pushes Malfoy off him, much more gently this time. The look that Malfoy levels on him steaks his breath. A blend of shared amusement and—
he spits, and Harry’s blood goes cold. “You won’t even tell me what you’ve been up to the last few days, when you were no doubt sucking up to your dear Minister and his auditor cronies.” He shakes his head, the same disparaging half smile on his face. “Don’t forget
“Yes. I noticed Neville right away. He was so passionate about Herbology, it was impossible not to be drawn to him.”
Hermione grabs Harry’s chin and turns his head before he can protest, exposing the side of his neck and the unmistakable love bite on it. Her jaw drops.
Merlin, it was too gorgeous a sight. The old, all-too-familiar yearning stabbed through Draco. If Potter kept smiling at him like that, he’d need far more champagne to handle the evening. He grabbed the side of the buffet for support.
And then Harry was pulling him up by the arm and pinning him against the door. There was a split second where Draco wondered if Harry would want to kiss him after what he’d just done. But Harry crashed his mouth against his, desperately licking his lips until Draco opened up under him and brushed his tongue against Draco’s, tasting the bitterness and the want.
Harry’s mind is still spinning the next day, when he knocks on the door of Ron and Hermione’s cottage in the countryside near Ottery St Catchpole.
Draco faltered, but he was going too fast. He had already started to spin. There was a split-second of mortifying realisation, then he felt himself fall. The tips of his blades caught in the ice and he landed inelegantly, his elbow hitting the cold hard surface.
“Umpff, Harry—” Draco gasped, then Harry’s lips were on his, hungry and purposeful, claiming his mouth, swallowing Draco’s moans. Draco let himself melt into Harry’s embrace. He let himself be kissed, opening his mouth at the first touch of Harry’s tongue on his bottom lip. The edge of the countertop dug into the small of his back, but he barely felt it. Harry’s soft, wet tongue was in his mouth, and suddenly it was like someone had set Draco’s blood on fire. Want rushed through him, a wave of lust so powerful his knees almost buckled, and then he was kissing Harry back. Hands in Harry’s hair, he pulled him closer and kissed him, his tongue caressing Harry’s with a slow, teasing intent that was at odds with the way his entire body screamed,
“A game of Seekers, all right,” Malfoy growled in Harry’s ear as he thrust up against him, cocks leaking against one another.
“It was brilliant. I’m so happy your assistant called me to schedule this interview.” She got up and drifted off toward the kitchen. Draco hurriedly stuffed the rolls of parchment and the quill in his satchel. He snatched the Prothimioscope from the floor and followed her.
Harry. And I apologised, again and again, for having fed gossip and false accusations to someone as morally questionable as Rita Skeeter. But maybe if you didn’t go out of your way to make sure you never heard about what I’ve been up to since the war, you’d know I’m striving, every fucking day, to become the opposite of her. To become the opposite of the little brat I was, for that matter. I’m striving to become what I think a great journalist should be. What I think a good
You’re known as a journalist and for your continuous efforts to improve the integrity of the press, more than for your role during the war. A lot was written about you since, and most of your readers probably have the impression that they know you fairly well. Do you think there’s something they don't know about you yet?
But that’s a moot point now. Malfoy left him without a word of apology or explanation, and Harry’s not prepared to admit to the mix of confusion, guilt, and hurt he’s been feeling for the deceptive git.
“Yes, you were. It sounded Muggle. It sounded like this,” she said, and started singing just loud enough for Draco to shush her in embarrassment:
“Look, mate,” Ron says, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. “I was honest, earlier. I… I had no intention of acting like the main Auror on the case tonight. Actually, I’m not going to be an Auror around Malfoy. Not anymore.”
“Just get on with it, Draco,” Penelope waves her hand, “the Lost aren’t going to find themselves.” She seems amused in spite of herself, and the team chuckles and urges Draco on, “Yes, stop teasing and show us, damnit!”
Draco studied the Niffler’s beady black eyes. He was doing his best to pretend to project a look of solicitude, but his eyes kept fleeting to Draco’s bedside table.
In the tense silence that follows, the clicking of nails in the marble corridor is unmistakable. Balzac appears in the foyer with a friendly
“All right, we’re home,” Harry tells Scorpius as he slides the key into the lock and pushes the front door of the townhouse open. The little boy scampers inside behind him. “What are the next steps now?”
“It’s been a long term for you and Harry,” his mother chimed in with the same mortifyingly knowing smile. “You need your rest.”
“Same team?” Malfoy asks, then he repeats, “Same team.” Rubs his fingers along his jaw. He takes a breath, and something settles in his face. He gives Harry an almost imperceptible nod. Once.
They climbed the stairs. Draco felt himself shiver and wrapped his winter cloak tighter around him. In the near-darkness, Harry’s eyes gleamed with humour.
lost people. We went over this already. There was a war. Everyone did shite things. People you loved died. Now, there are people who love you who are still alive, and Christmas is as good a time as any to show them you love them too. You have this... this
And Jesus, can the man take a cock. Harry can’t tear his eyes from Malfoy’s bouncing arse, the pliant line of his back, the way he arches into Harry’s thrusts and moans wantonly, like Harry’s cock is the most divine thing that’s ever happened to him… And Harry wonders, with a sense of fearful curiosity, what a cock in his arse would feel like. If Malfoy would ever agree to initiate Harry with that most foreign, forbidden of pleasures.
“Then by all means, please go,” Draco called after her as she disappeared round the corner. In the ensuing silence, he glanced at Harry, who was still standing on the other side of the kitchen. He looked distinctly uncomfortable. It somehow melted Draco’s acrimony away. He wished he could wipe the anxious look off Harry’s face, replace it with—
Draco shifted on his feet. Being in the same room as Harry reawakened the silent yearning he’d felt for years. If he remained in this room any longer, it might stay with him indefinitely, an indelible longing he’d have to carry around in his chest forever.
The calm shatters. Harry whips around. Malfoy is leaning against the doorframe of the bedroom, a small smile on his lips. He’s wearing one of those Muggle suits of his, his white-blond hair catching the sunlight pouring into the room and gleaming, clean and soft-looking. Harry feels his face heating and he has no idea why: Malfoy should be the one who’s embarrassed, coming to Harry’s room uninvited.
“Mistor!” Ernestina cries. Her arms are bound to her body with thick, magical rope. Her left eye is purple and swollen, her nose is bleeding over her neat, pretty blouse. Harry gapes at her in horror.
“I’m happy for you, mate, I really am. But I really don’t want to know,” Ron had stopped Harry before he’d even opened his mouth.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded a bit frantically and pulled him down for a kiss. Malfoy kissed him fervently, his tongue soft and insistent on Harry’s. Pulling out slightly, he slammed his cock back inside Harry again. And again, and again. Kissing and moaning into each other’s mouths, they writhed together on Harry’s Auror cloak, spread under their bodies already slick with sweat. They both found a rhythm, Malfoy fucking Harry’s arse in long, deep thrusts, Harry lifting his legs over Malfoy’s shoulders, one hand wrapped around his own aching cock, wanking himself along with Malfoy’s pounding.
Draco stifled a groan. His cock twitched at the sense memory. Lucifer, he was already hard inside his pyjamas. If he could just touch himself—just get this over with, just get it out of his system...
“You sure about this, mate?” Ron calls from behind him, but the door has already shut behind Harry, and he’s hurtling down the stairs, two at a time, magical objects clattering inside the box.
With a sigh, Draco rode a warmer downward wind current and landed a safe distance from the excited little group surrounding Harry.
Draco laughs louder now, throwing his head back, baring his teeth. It sounds almost deranged, because there’s nothing funny about the situation at all. Then he shuts his mouth and the laughing stops. He stands and closes the gap with Harry’s bed, and it’s all Harry can do not to cower. Draco’s towering over him, and Harry’s hand itches for his wand.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” he smirked and gave Harry’s cock another tug before closing his lips around it again.
After the last slice of Christmas pudding was eaten, Harry went out to the back garden with Mr Weasley. The rest of the family moved to the sitting room, the young parents carrying sleepy children on their shoulders.
And your clever little invention here,” he gestured at the Prothimioscope lying motionless against the countertop, “seems to have understood that better than you have. I don’t want my name in the papers. I’ve heard that little speech too many times, I’m afraid. Since the war...too many things were supposed to be different. Too many people claim to have changed.” He paused, then shook his head. “I’m not confident that they have.”
“Mmmpff,” Draco tried to speak. He managed to break the kiss long enough to groan, “Silencing spells, you heathen! My mother and aunt and cousin could hear us!”
book. By now, he knew that book better than if he’d written it himself. He still tried to enjoy the acting game of learning to make the potions, of asking wide-eyed questions to Slughorn, of pretending to slice Shrivelfig just this side of wrong, like a normal last year student would. He had a cover to maintain, after all. It wasn’t that bad either: the Library was always warm, the hushed atmosphere heavy with the scent of old books, wood polish and ink. Madam Pince had put up charmed Christmas decorations on the bookshelves: tiny glowing reindeers ran ahead of you to tap on the book that you were looking for, fairy lights blinked softly around the windowsills, and enchanted snow fell from the ceiling. She was obviously in a better mood than she’d ever been, relieved that the Library was one of the few places in Hogwarts to stand unscathed in the wake of the Battle.
What on earth was he nervous about? He was a professional, dammit. He had proven his worth as a journalist, hadn’t he? He was head of the Society section at the
Balzac barks and wags his tail and lets go of Harry, settling at his feet and looking up at him with soft brown eyes.
Harry steps inside. The office is indeed empty. The space is tidy, airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a breathtaking view of the skyline. It looks cool, professional, befitting of the founder of an international company. It also feels like the opposite of Draco’s study at home, warm and dimly lit and cosy. Absently, fingers touching the piles of parchment on Draco’s large glass-top desk, Harry wonders what these differences say about Draco. There's the tireless inventor and ruthless businessman he is inside these walls, when Harry escorts him to Caduceus and stands guard in front of his office; there’s the warmer version of Malfoy he becomes in the safety of his study at home, Harry sitting on the sofa and watching him work while Scorpius practices at the grand piano. Harry witnesses the transformation every day: it’s in the way Draco’s jaw sets when he’s about to unfold himself from the black Mercedes and walk to the Caduceus building; the way he straightens the lapels of his jacket in the lift; the way his voice becomes more clipped, posher, when he’s in his role.
“Okay.” Hermione Levitates the pushchair as she walks back upstairs. On the black metal frame of it, a brand name stands out in white cursive. Harry’s mind flashes back to a parchment rolling from Draco’s glass-top desk, Harry nearly stepping on it. Words written in a foreign language, topped with calligraphed words. Draco’s gaze as he gripped Harry’s shirt and pushed him up against the shelves of a supplies cupboard, teeth bared on a laugh.
“It’s true,” Hermione says, a placating hand on Ron’s knee. She turns to Harry. “I assume you did what you thought was best in those circumstances, Harry. But it sounds dangerous to carry on with your mission, if Malfoy knows why you’re there.”
“When we were expecting Scorpius…” Malfoy lets his eyes fall away from Harry’s. “It changes things, knowing you’re going to have a child. It changes your perspective. I apologise if it sounds awfully cliché. You realise things are not going to be about you anymore. That’s how Astoria and I felt. Even after living in Paris for years, we still felt very English. We wanted to raise our child in our home country. And… I don’t know. Having a child brought back all sorts of values I didn’t know I cared about anymore. I wanted to be real, for him. No more hiding behind the seemingly enchanted life I had built, away from my roots, away from who I really was.”
Harry took a step back. He couldn’t believe how close he’d come to Malfoy. Close enough to feel the heat of his body behind the cold exterior. Malfoy was like a magnet. A magnet that was far too gorgeous for Harry’s good.
“You’re right, Potter. Becoming a high-class thief wasn’t my childhood dream. I secretly wanted to be an Auror. The operative word being ‘secretly.’ My father would have gagged on his neckerchief had he known.”
Malfoy lays his elbows on the table, curry container seemingly forgotten. “Good question, Potter. A little bit of both. And also, because I need the money, so what better place to look for it than in the pockets of the rich? At least, that’s how it started. Over time, I started gathering a lot of interesting tidbits about my precious little suckers. And now I’ve made it a game. For every larceny, I also strive to steal something that would incriminate them.”
“Trust me, it’s taking all my willpower not to throw you down on the floor again and forget all about pesky things like cases and Auror careers.” Malfoy’s grey eyes darkened, and Harry laughed. “Better not test my patience for too long.” He gestured towards the trapdoor. “Open it?”
“How fun.” Draco gives him a lopsided smirk. “Well, have a brilliant time discussing the best spot to observe the Acromantulas' mating season in Britain with other fellow loonies. And make sure you make good use of the valuable piece of information I just gave you,” he adds, nodding at the parchment square Harry still holds between his fingers. “Don’t make me wait too long.”
Harry stands there, dumbstruck, as Malfoy rummages into the pockets of someone else’s coat. Harry watches as Malfoy pulls his closed fist out of the pocket, checks the contents of his palm, and with the swift sureness of a job well done, transfers them into his own pocket and moves on to the next coat on the rack.
Draco backs away a step. “It may seem harmless to you, but this is serious, Harry. I'm keeping Ernestina's secret. I'm not risking her being on trial, getting sent Merlin knows where. We are not telling anyone about Nesting!”
He’s spent so many years not knowing that that person existed, not knowing that he’s already met them, that they were within his reach. Just because he’s realised it under more than shifty circumstances doesn’t make it any less real.
“What about Neville?” Harry asked. “You reckon he was on board with Luna’s diabolical plan to have us fuck again?”
He doesn’t look very mysterious now, standing over Draco’s desk, proud and official in his Auror uniform, if only for his slightly flushed face. He looks…
Draco wondered if his heart was past the point of breaking. Dazed, numb, he listened to her tell him about Blaise, the way he’d reached out during the summer, the way he’d comforted her. The way they’d fallen in love while Draco was shut away, an inexorable series of events and choices he hadn’t made pulling him closer to a darkness he despised.
Because Malfoy had lived a fascinating life the past twelve years, and Harry realises he really knows nothing about it.
“Thank you, Head Auror,” he said. Smith shook Harry’s hand, two firm professional pumps. “Frankly, it’s been an honour to work and solve this case with Auror Malfoy.” He turned to Malfoy, keeping his expression as neutral as possible. “And thank
It was like going simultaneously blind and deaf. Harry was surrounded by disorienting darkness and silence. Only Malfoy’s breath, slightly raspy, remained, grounding him in their new reality.
“You don’t have to look so disparaging,” Harry laughed softly next to him. “He has his quirks. Doesn’t mean he’s a bad teacher.”
“I must object,” Draco said, stepping closer to Harry while the others resumed gathering snow a few feet away from them.
Harry can’t tell if the band playing old Celestina Warbeck favourites is getting louder as the night wears on, or if he’s reached the point of a mild-headache and one too many whiskies.
“Of course, Auror Potter.” Penelope lets him go, while her team smiles like benevolent sharks. “Finish your business, please.”
“It can’t be that hard, can it?” Harry said. “Draco has already done the research. And I grew up watching my aunt fill out subscription forms for
Draco watched as Harry pulled books, quills and parchment from his school bag. In the warm candlelight, he looked as any of the other students around them. Yet his magic constantly buzzed against Draco's skin, a reminder that this ordinary-looking kid was one of the most powerful wizards Draco had known.
“Of course you did. Of course you followed me around, I was your arch nemesis, that’s what you’re supposed to do—”
“Daddy?” Scorpius asks, pulling at Malfoy’s trousers fabric. Malfoy turns to look at him and the boy meets his father’s eyes briefly before looking at his shoes. “Why do you not call him Harry?”
I know. I’d be getting involved with my purported ‘employer,’ with the main suspect of an ongoing investigation. And,” Harry lifts a finger when Hermione opens her mouth, wanting to finish first, “even if Draco was neither of these, I would still be getting involved with… with
“Call me Harry,” he tells her weakly, shaking her hand. He’s rendered momentarily tongue-tied by her blatant confidence.
In that moment, her resemblance with McGonagall was so uncanny Harry had to fight down a smile. A quick glance at Malfoy confirmed that the same thought had crossed his partner’s mind. They both lifted their hands to their mouths in an attempt to stifle a laugh.
