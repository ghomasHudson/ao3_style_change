Harry groaned at his words, one hand gripped the back of his head and tilted it to the side. His lips latched onto the column of his throat and nipped on it. He gently raked his teeth at his skin and all Draco did is to moan and let go as he promised.
Harry had uncovered his, will he be able to look at his as well?
She looks so beautiful kneeling, hand steadily keeping her slow pace while the other held his abdomen and when she bent down, closing her lips on his cock’s head, he grumbled. His hand tightened around her head.
Loneliness eats him whenever Harry’s away and his insecurities come back rushing in, if he didn’t hear Harry’s voice for too long, he might end up thinking he had found another one to replace him. But he never failed. Harry never failed.
She gasped when Harry roughly pulled her into his lap and hugged her, feeling her small form to his and he groaned.
Harry sighed. Two can play, he reminded himself.
Can someone tell him why wizard teens are this fucking horny? He's been binding himself to the chair he is sitting in. He had drunk three bottles of beer trying to hold himself back from snatching Draco away from his circle of friends and just bloody return to the Malfoy Manor and rest like a good boy.
Draco pouted, letting go of his stuffie. His delicate fingers began to trace shapes and numbers in Harry's shoulder, "Miss you Daddy. Let's go sleep, already?"
He smiled at the sight, leaning down to rub his nose to her, “Sweetheart”
👀👀👀👀👀👀
“Little prongs!” Sirius’ voice came few feet away from him.
It was something she never experienced before. Simple things, simple things but thoroughly thought of. Thoroughly planned and considered. It’s nothing too fancy but definitely too touching.
“Female section” Harry said and followed the guy.
“Dray” he heard Pansy called him but his eyes were elsewhere. He was staring straight ahead, at the Gryffindor table where Harry and a slutty seventh year is sitting beside his Harry! Closer than he’d like to see and closer than what’s necessary between a person who for the love of Merlin is already taken.
“I am no Potions master. I do not get in the way of what Potions do and what happens after it’s gone. But as I’ve told you, with all my knowledge, things are fine”
"Fuck" he heard Harry cussed and he grinned. Maybe he's close to losing and just letting go.
“They won’t know, darlin’. But if they will, they’ll gonna have to face me” the change of his tone, from soft to serious have made her bit her bottom lip. Finding the voice hot and the rigid expression on his face sexy. There’s just something in Harry whenever he is this serious man who could do anything he wishes to do, a man of power and definite ability.
It was entirely something that can drive him in stupor than fully takes him away to right sensibilities.
The intense kisses they shared, sweaty foreheads, and bite marks in his body as a reminder of what Harry had claimed, the property he took from his body. There were no statements but never did Draco allowed himself to hold another man.
Daddy, harder!” he didn’t care how loud he was getting.
Wanna see Harry, wanna see him full of his cock, wanna see the expression on his eyes as he dazedly watch him take matters in his hand or in this case, his mouth.
“Interesting, Mark. I would’ve love to read an article of yours”
He sighed. That’s an issue he had not thought in the first day he met her. An issue to a man like him. Quietly walking over to her, he bent down and carefully pulled the book away from her hands. Then he brushed a hair away from her lovely face.
He sighed blissfully. He knows he can create family with her and until then, they have each other. But how could he seal it? When is the best time to seal it forever? Now, he’s giving a thought about seriously marking the omega and for him to be marked in return. Provide her the same exclusivity.
He took a deep breath, feeling the way his cock twitch at the first contact of Harry’s warm wet tongue, tentatively licking his precum before licking its slit. His fingers tightened once again around Harry’s fingers then unconsciously tugging at it.
Harry moved his hand to hold his palm, the back of Draco’s hand in view as he gave it one smooth kiss before letting go.
Harry sighed as he finished up his warding process. Inspecting the whole place, he made sure everything is in its place and secured.
Unfortunately or maybe luckily, at the mention of their father about to arrive, they all squealed in delight and if only Dracy wasn’t used to that kind of noise, she would’ve yelped in shock herself. They all jumped from their places and began to trudge to the living room, not even bothering to wash up.
“Harry—
“But don’t take too long. Kids can throw a tantrum like no other” Remus eyed Sirius who stared back in disbelief and immediately got on defensive mode.
She even chuckled.
It's early to be thinking these, he can say that, but Draco is nothing but a decisive Malfoy heir. He knows his goals and his wants with a single thought. He smirked and hummed playfully.
It was just downright messy.
He has a lot of questions. He wanted to talk about last night with him but he just had to have emergency when Draco needed his time.
“Oh. Draco snarling. That’s the Slytherin I know”
This would be the worst nightmare of history ever. Fuck.
“Chocolates for my sweet sugar! Excuse me, coming through” Harry announced just as he stepped inside his department after another exhausting meeting with Shacklebee who did not even let him give the chocolates to Draco first before literally dragging him inside that office.
Professor McGonagall tutted, “You have a small amount of a love potion ingredient in you, Mr. Malfoy. Not a love potion per se” she explained, “There’s no antidote to a potion you two accidentally brewed by combining Ashwinder eggs, horseradish, and pearl dust. But I assure you, it’s harmless but different”
Harry sighed as he poured himself a coffee the next morning. He didn't know what he was expecting but yesterday was not it.
One glass of wine turned into two to three to four until he controlled himself for the fifth one. He needs to ‘cause he cannot afford to do something so rash because his eyes suddenly decided Harry looked like a tasty loaf of bread, smells like a newly baked goods, delicious strawberry tart.
Draco raised an eyebrow, letting a small smirk appear on his lips, "You're coming"
He untangled himself and pulled away causing Draco to whine needily, hands itching to reach out to his cock and getting himself off.
He did not miss the way his boyfriend gazed at him from head to toe and visibly gulping.
"My parents will be leaving in two hours" Draco stated, "Tell me, what kind of Auror are you?"
“Don’t leave. I understand you might not want to be in the same vicinity with me so I’ll be the one to leave.”
“Hmm?” he said, slowly pumping his finger in and out before inserting another.
“You two should learn how to work together because the next time I hear an incident like this, it’ll be a month detention for the two of you” she clasped her hands together, “Anyway, you two are alright. You inhaled some of the potion you fail to brew but fortunately, it hasn’t affected either of your health”
Seems like his daddy needs some too.
He whined when Harry pulled his lips away from his but immediately latched onto his jaw down to his neck, sucking deep and hard, his hips rolling to Draco’s thigh, letting him feel that huge cock already so hard for him.
He was the angel among the strippers, the one whose name falls out of most of their customer’s mouths more often than other strippers. He had a name for his own but several others are preferred over the original.
Harry stopped but didn’t look back.
Good. That shut her up.
He wandered in the house until he got into the library and found her.
Draco felt himself leaking through his lace thong, his hole clenching and wanting to feel that sensation. Too long. It has been too long since he had someone inside him and he wants it, he wants it too much.
Dracy whined before gripping Harry’s shirt and pulling him closer.
“So, anything exciting happening?” he asked, “Other than this of course. Like an adventure or something wilder?”
Fuck. This was all to sudden. It’s not even a surprise.
“You always here, pretty?”
Draco grumbled in irritation for what he heard.
He blinked at her. Not having anything with sense to say.
Draco slid an index finger over his daddy’s cheek, all the while beginning to roll his hips in slow movements, “I am going to fuck myself, daddy. And you’re going to watch”
“Who’s your boyfriend, Draco?” he asked seriously, slightly tightening his hold, “Zayan, huh? That asshole from the party?”
After Harry paid all things, he shrunk the paper bags and have them fit in only one bag before they walked out and entered a shoe shop.
, Harry!” he sobbed when Harry thrust his erection, causing electric sensations shooting to the base of his cock, bobbing and throbbing, “Shit. Please, need you, fuck, need you so much”
She initiated to cook but Harry said he’d already ask Wily to so she wouldn’t stress herself up.
, harder!”
“Are you ready?”
Lucius raised an eyebrow tauntingly, “How about we reveal to the Ministry you’re an illegal animagus?”
Tightening his hold on hers, he lifted her up and set her down on the couch before he kneeled between her parted legs, “Let’s finish where we left off, shall we?”
Pansy matched his own smirk and leaned on her seat, “What did your husband say?”
It is its own kind of deception. One that gnaws within, caressing the hidden desires and jab at it in the right place at the right time.
Harry raised his head when he heard Ron's voice and the sound of his door opening and closing.
“I d-don’t know” she whispered so low she doubted Harry could even hear.
“So why don’t I send that cover up plans behind your back,” he paused, “Hand it to your father anonymously…” he smiled politely with the faux kindness dancing in his gaze, knuckles brushing Draco’s heating cheeks as he tried to grasp at the reality of this all.
“Welcome home, ‘arry”
“We’ve talked about how you should behave. Haven’t you learn anything?”
To say he was broken is an understatement. He’s devastated. He’s downright hurt and he doesn’t like the feeling. Endless queries run in his mind as he stared at his whiskey. He’s not even sure if Draco has an excuse to say or he naturally just doesn’t want to marry him.
The way those lips would pout, that mouth that would spew whatever it wants, that body so heavenly. Harry wished he could see his heart too.
Harry gave a particular hard suck on her nipple while his hand pinched the other and pulled on it, Dracy felt the warmth of his cum coating his jeans and she felt hazy at the goodness of it all. Dirty but was so sexy. She’d never made a man cum that fast before and the thought it was Harry was more than the best.
That rough voice with a certain thick accent he couldn't quite classify is something quite unique and Draco found himself drawn in. That sound is fucking good.
Draco turned to the book and nodded, “It’s amazing. I found this on the common room so I borrowed it. Have you read it?”
“Let’s go over your safewords, tiger” he began, “What will it be?”
Tom nodded, “To be young and in love” he smiled, “What do you guys do?”
He felt the edge of the bed dipped when Harry raised a knee and tentatively laid his palms on Draco’s back. He nearly moaned once more when he felt the heat seeped into his skin. Just those hands, merely Harry’s hands are dribbling with incredible ticklish heat that pushed him to pop his butt out and wiggle it beguilingly.
Draco drank the firewhiskey straight out of its bottle. It’s already seven in the evening and Harry didn’t come back yet. What was taking him so long?
“Hmm” Draco only hummed, “’leepy” he whined childishly.
Dracy looked up to him, hands cupping his cheeks, “C-could you. . . could you mark me?”
A complete comedy. Who’s even cat? Who’s the mouse? That they don’t know nor they stopped to know. But neither of them backed out. Losing and failure are off their own list. If there’s something the both of them could agree on, it’s that never to back down from a challenge.
After drinking his juice in one go, he stood up and made his way to the Gryffindor table, not liking what he is seeing. He squinted his eyes when the student had the foolish courage to lean his head on his daddy’s shoulder and had the though process to run that sinful hand in those biceps meant to hold Draco down and no other.
How is the situation easily reversed? And why is his body reacting even without so much of a rough touch?
“But—
“Wonderful. I’m nearing to finishing the third edition of the parenting book I am reading”
He blinked at it. It was huge and calloused. Right, he needs some lotion. But those veins, merlin look at those veins. They look rather strong and so prominent. He briefly wondered what kind of exercise he does in his time.
He screamed when he came into his panties, soaking the sheets on Harry’s bed and he panted and panted. Harry continued to finger him through his orgasm.
The purse in McGonagall’s lips tightened before she inhaled sharply. For a moment Harry thought he offended the Headmistress. He was ready to take the question back when she opened her mouth,
Jerry’s eyes widened and his lips parted, “Sir”
With his eyes covered and hands cuffed above his head, Draco felt his other senses heightening, his back arched once more, keening as Harry pulled away from the kiss, mouth hovering over his cheeks to his jawline until it reached his ear,
“You lost the title when you left. You’re a bastard” he stated harshly.
Dracy sighed, her hands coming to cup him on the cheeks again.
. It’s
“May I?” he asked and Dracy was unable to think clearly but managed to give a nod. She felt as if she was hit with a strong stupefy when Harry carefully wrapped a hand around her ankle and removed the shoes she’s wearing.
“Re” he gently called, sporting his puppy eyes. One that would ensure a delicious pounding, wanting to feel his cock inside him as he clenched around him to milk him dry. He wanted Remus all over him, under him, above him. Wanted him in the same way he desired him before, all those secret hook ups in their dorm room, in the Room of Requirement and under the forbidden forest when it’s all rainy and wet and noisy. The way his loud moans were muffled by the storm and Remus’ words singing through his whole body.
How long since she last saw a color on her face? Long suffering months before she met Harry. The person who managed to make her feel something and provided her what she cannot say.
Her hands moved and slowly went around his nape without breaking eye contact. She nibbled on her lips. She instantly noticed the way Harry’s eyes glazed with darkened desire, mesmerizing flame, and ravishing look.
He turned his back on the door and waited for another few seconds before hearing a door opening and he dropped the bathrobe. He grinned deviously when he heard a gasp and felt piercing eyes on his back. The show's on. Oh, he's so excited to show Harry what plump ass he can give him. Flavory and smooth and wrinkle free.
His parents were the one who told him what respect is but how ironic that they do not harbor any. Yes, yes, he understands this is some kind of sacrifice but it’s like basically offering him to a complete bull!
She’s just existing for men to invalidate and molest when there are no other willing pussies to fuck.
Hermione stood up. Dracy was expecting for a handshake but she gasped when Hermione hugged her and squeezed her tight, “Nice to meet you!” she pulled away and looked at her husband, “Ron?”
The handsome man is seated on the center of the crowd, alone in a table with a glass of whiskey in front of him. His right leg is crossed to the other and his left hand was resting in the vacant chair beside him, holding a cigarette between his fingers, eyes blazing like fueled fire.
The sounds going in his mind are the way Draco's ass is bouncing beneath the navy blue dress.
“You ready?”
Lucius nodded at him before they stepped inside the floo where they would be stopping by at Andromeda's before going to France.
He relished watching her this way. Fucking her fire out as her legs threatened to give up. He chuckled and gripped her waist tight, using her as a leverage to pull her closer. Her ass bumping against his v-line and his balls slapping in her thighs, wet from her juices.
Up from their spot, they can see thousand miles. The Black lake, Quidditch pitch, the Forbidden Forest. It offer a  lot of perspective, one Harry might need.
For she was saved from her dark past, it is her turn to pull him away from his cruel monsters. It wasn’t him who lacked, it was her who failed to reach out after all the things he did. But now, beginning now, she will.
Her fingers get tangled on his hair as Harry alternated between two breasts, sucking, playing and groaning into them while squeezing the other. He wouldn’t leave one unattended before his hands slid down, palms gliding down to her stomach until it reach the side of her thighs and patted them.
If he calls her now, he’s not looking like he’s gonna rush her, is she? He started from those little affections to build his way up or maybe down. He didn’t want to end up like people who had tried to rush her and forced to hike the skirt up in one meeting.
He did immediately. He kept his eyes open, watching and calculating what Harry’s next movement is going to be. One hand leaned on the car while the other held the side of his left leg, slowly sliding it up and down to his thigh, “Was that your plan?”
“Father, why would you give my hand to a muggle? Are you serious? A muggle?”
Harry nodded, “I wouldn’t want them to see us both as well”
She looked up hastily when Harry appeared in the middle of the living room through apparition. The alpha immediately approached and kneeled in front of her, “Is everything, okay? What is it, baby? Wily said it’s urgent”
Her palms glided up and down Harry’s chest, the way the muscles felt like contorting at her touch and the arousal that’s dripping on air, she knew he can smell her.
Draco groaned and tried to push him off the couch, “Get up! We have some work to do!”
Two years ago, at age eighteen, Draco is the flavor his dull life was looking for. Having no fun at all, his time buried in work, almost have no control of his life at all.
Draco cheered alongside Pansy, Hannah and Susan as they watched the others have a quidditch match against the seventh year Ravenclaw team. It was tense but challenging.
Just a little bit of sum sum and Draco is not letting him get it.
How is Harry so unintentionally hurtful?
“Are you okay?” Harry asked lowly, “Do you want to take a rest?”
He snapped his head as he stared wide eyed. What?!
little boy. He should behave like so.
See? He's still on his teens but fuck, Harry can feel his pulse fastening because the way Draco's fingers are toying with his cup is very inappropriate. He gripped his pants tight and looked away trying to retain the knowledge of the number three of the House of Potter rules.
“And that what you always do to him”
He never expected giving births in the natural way was this intense. The room was nothing but echoes of Dracy’s screams. He was in utter distress, even when he tried to soothe her and comfort her, encourage her and praise her, it didn’t work.
He glared at Harry only to be dismissed as he pointed his index finger. Following the direction, he saw it was Tom who walked out of his bar and began to walk somewhere.
But one problem she can see in this is, it’s Harry James Potter. The Alpha that’s loved by many, followed by everyone because of the known Potter Tragedy, the Alpha that’s idolized by many, and the Alpha she never expected she could ever have.
Harry’s eyes darkened when Draco’s lip parted, his chest rising up and down quickly. Draco gripped his shorts into his fist and looked back at Harry.
He’s sure the eyes were on him as they stopped, the woman raising an eyebrow and the men having surprised expressions on their faces. However, it was Harry’s face that he focused on. The smile he offered as he stood up and offered his hand to shake, “Mr. Malfoy, nice to see you here”
Dracy nodded with a smile. Her palms gliding to her tummy protectively. It has been an instinct she does for the past few weeks. She doesn’t recall when it started but she just noticed the way she would hold her stomach lovingly.
Draco nodded, “Merry Christmas, Luna”
“Come on, push a little harder, Dracy. The head’s appearing. You can do it! Push more!” Andy motivated.
“Why are you alone out here?” he asked and Draco shrugged, looking up.
Harry whispered the lubrication charm, instantly feeling the slick substance coating his fingers,
“Daddy” he sobbed, pushing the dildo in him until it bottomed up, “Aaah, fuck daddy”
Sirius blinked before huffing out a laugh. The most bizarre things really do come from Prongs’ mouth. In no way did he expect his disbelief to center around how fun it would be if they sport the same kind of magic.
"Hold tight" Harry whispered before turning the engine on and shit, Draco's hands encircled his abdomen tight and Harry nearly lost his grip when Draco leaned his front to his back and felt his nipples through their shirts.
Draco exhaled, feeling his heart getting warm by how nice Harry is being. He’s just so damn lucky. He is his.
Fuck. It was so warm and wet and so good. The sensations of his cock engulfed in that wet heat was making his breath hitch and he felt like choking on his own saliva. He groaned lowly when her tongue dipped in his slit and leaked the precum that poured out.
“You’re a playboy, right?’
“You’re staring” he heard Pansy stated beside him, a smile ghosting over her lips, “I’ve caught you like two? Four times? Is there something you’re not telling me, Dray?” it was the cunning tone in her that has him rolling his eyes.
“Then let’s talk about me” he started, his eyes hovering over her figure. Noting how much they’ll need to buy her clothes that’ll fit and clothes that are as beautiful as she is. He intends to bring her confidence back.
She whined, taking all strength she can and pulled the shirt off of her, grunting in annoyance when it stuck on her head.
Sexiest? Fuck, Harry would love to see that but there’s time for that. If they really do have time for that.
“It’s not a problem. It’s an issue. That minister betrayed us and wanted to get something from us in exchange of keeping our secret” Lucius answered.
Julia looked at her and stood up, “Sir?”
“Come on. Want to hear those pretty little whimpers for me, tiger. Want to hear my name from your lips, the noises, let me know I’m making you feel this good” Harry said roughly, his palm suddenly cupping her clothed pussy and Dracy moaned loudly, "Only
He looked down and stared the way Draco’s head is tilted, trying to look at him but cannot. His lips are parted a bit, looking so nicely debauched, the tint on his lovely cheeks. He looks so ethereal.
He stayed inside the cabinet to what felt like hours, ignoring the noises he heard that came after a while of waiting. The grumbles and shouts and the ringing of emergency alarms blaring all around the house.
“Yes, please”
But Harry? No. He’s far from weak and that is why she’s doing everything to let the man crack. It sends jostles of sensation in her core. Throbbing, beating, and desperate.
“In what way?” this time, Lily asked.
Pansy chuckled, “You mean who you want to do?”
The scars that littered on his sexy chest entice a groan out of his mouth, panting as the warm skin sent tingling sensations over his own clothed erection.
The man looked at the roses and hummed, “How much?”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. He looked at her straight in the eyes in silence for a whole minute before he spoke, “You’re distressed. You should take a rest”
It was for him undecipherable. With the music booming at the place, there’s no chance he could find evidence just by listening. But Harry seemed content in doing just that. He tried to peek inside and signaled to him that Tom was on the phone.
Sweat dribbled down on his temple as his chest heaved. His breathing gets heavier as minutes tick by and by the fourth finger, Draco gushed out more precum. The burn all more obvious now. He ignored all of them as his ears felt as if they were ringing neutral noises.
He gulped and a hoarse yelp bubbled from his throat when he tripped and fell down on the hard ground. He grumbled, his heart feeling like it’s about to jump out of his chest as his ears tried their best to listen at his surrounding. The way the wind of the night seem to add to the eerie atmosphere around him, the way his breath comes out as a smoke and his goosebumps keen on his skin.
He leaned on him, head resting on his shoulder as he takes in the silence around them. His fingers softly grazed along the petals of the flower and letting his weight on Harry’s strong musculature.
And touch him all over? What does that mean? Is he going to the nines and land his hands wherever it could reach? Grip him by his ass, manhandle him and throw him to the chair or take him against the wall?
“Harry?” he tried to call for the man in the living room but when he took a peek, Harry is also not there.
Fingers danced along the side of his cock, not enclosing in but just feeling him as Harry added another finger in his mouth. Not moving them but resting them atop of Draco’s tongue, spurring sensations across his body.
“Are these okay, kitten?” he asked as he stood before him, eyes taking in every crevice, every nook of his pale skin. Flawless, definitely well taken care of. Makes him just wanna ruin him for all men.
He’s not a least bit convinced that things are really fine but he calm his worries a bit. He was holding onto that string,
She cannot believe what she was seeing.
Denials. Denials.
“We have questions. I know we do” Harry whispered, tugging Draco’s head to level his, “A lot to be answered”
The bundle he needed to uncover and now, it's fucking here. Making him feel so good.
“Gods, I love you, darling. You know that, right?”
Draco rolled his eyes. What ridicule.
“More please” he begged, “Fuck, please, Harry”
“Iced tea? You come here and order an iced tea?”
Draco can feel his skin tingling.
“Give or take?” Harry asked. His fingers tapping at the cold wood of his office desk.
“We agreed”
he whined needily, his hands wandering at his defined abdomen, shaped by the endless workouts of being the head Auror.
“Tastes so good” he complimented and spelled her body clean.
They looked so happy.
He’s not one to dwell on what is merely stated by bunch of scumbags, he’s not one to be hurt by meaningless gossips, by people who are so desperate to get into his life. He’s not a gentleman who possess the patience to be so welcoming, to be so understanding. He’s not someone who puts a smile to face the public especially when he doesn't want to.
She gulped and tried to smile, trying not to speak because she knows her voice is going to break.
Draco is rejoicing inside him as he let the cold air hit his thighs and his arms as Harry drove into the night.
She followed what he wanted her to do. She took her dress and bra off, folded them neatly on the table. Took her shoes off and put them beside the door and kneeled in the middle of the massive bed.
Harry slammed the Daily Prophet on the table and stood up. The woman standing few feet away from his desk, head bowed and was definitely mulling over whatever chance she has to escape the current situation she found herself wrapped in.
"If you're going to go out without me, you should tell me where"
He misses this.
“Harry and Mr. Malfoy”
He winced. Did he just realize he might have some dog tags kink? If that’s even a thing?
Love is not easy. It’s not something you can just pick up from the side of the road and it’s not something you can just buy in Diagon Alley.
This pregnancy thing is not what he anticipated when he started this, this whatever it is. Impregnating an omega is surely what he doesn’t have in mind when he brought her to her house.
She whined helplessly and Harry answered in a groan. She tried to lift her head to stare at the man eating her out like a starved human and she moaned at the sight. His eyes were closed as if savoring every little bit of her taste, her pussy on his mouth.
“Ssh. It’s okay” harry murmured, one of his hands coming up to cup her by her cheek, “Take care of you now”
“I’m sorry. I promise I won’t leave like that again”
“Harry, so good. Alpha, please” she sobbed, thighs clenching together to feel sort of friction.
“Hmph!” Draco glared and turned his back to go to his room.
He waved a hand on the both of them to clean them of the residue of the naughtiness they pulled at St. Mungos . He kissed her on her forehead before pulling back completely, “Feeling better?”
“They aren’t just words. They’re words but not just words. Do you see me not smiling when you say you love me? Did you not see me cry when you told me I wasn’t worth it? Did you not see Hermione offended when I called her mudblood? Did you not see Ron angry when I called him blood traitor? Did you not see Pansy tried to sacrifice you to the dark lord just because?”
Draco was shocked when Harry instantly turned his demeanor back into being the Head Auror. No pillow talk, no post-sex kisses.
“My mom was pregnant when she was killed and w-when you told me you are, I j-just got this memories and thought a-about the sibling I s-should’ve—
Harry looked up and their eyes met and Draco pouted.
He rested his chin over his palm and waited for Ron to arrive. Fortunately enough, the man appeared within a few minutes and sat down from where Hermione sat a while ago.
Sobbing. Sobbing like a kid. Looking so traumatized and eyes reflected as if he had saw all the wars of before and the wars for the future.
"Curfew? Seriously?" she taunted and Draco shrugged easily, "It's actually good because then I will be locked up inside with him"
How long was he out by the way?
He smirked when a faint blush roused on those cheeks.
He tilted his head. Not understanding what she really means.
“I’m Harry James Potter. Who’s this angel view right here?”
He gripped Draco's arm tight and pulled him outside. "Harry" there's a slight mockery in his voice mixed with a satisfied one.
“Then don’t” she cut him off nonchalantly.
Harry is here. The kisses are here.
Harry nodded and gave her a kiss on the cheek, “How was you day?” he willed himself to ask, not wanting to open the subject of her question last night.
“Mate, calm down” Seamus shot a hand up, motioning for him to relax as he untangled himself from his boyfriend, “Breathe, Harry”
He sighed and continued to read the letter which can be a good five thousand word essay if he’s exaggerating.
“I d-did” he stammered, eyes fluttering when Harry began to gently massage the back of his head. Fingertips dragging along his scalp in a soothing manner while the other hand snaked around his waist.
She tugged her wrist, back arching, “Harry, harry. Fuck,
Harry growled as he gave a particular hard thrust and let go. Letting ropes of cum inside Draco who loved the sensation of being filled with so much, feeling the warmth of Harry’s cum.
He wanted to be at peace, live a cadence of serenity, be at ease waking up. He wanted every bit of what tranquility can give him. It isn’t much, right? Considering he just had to defeat the darkest wizard of his generation. Not by himself alone of course.
Maybe it isn’t just a round two calling. But round three, four, five, six, to ten. Everyone knows, mostly Marlene, how Remus can have the strength and stamina that can never be matched by anyone and Sirius is very eager to comply.
Remus’ eyes immediately darkened, his hands sliding down to grip his husband in his waist, “Do you know what you’re suggesting, kitten?” he asked lowly, voice between dangerous but so fucking turned on as his cock gave a twitch, not seeing the way Sirius smirked playfully.
A young man or specifically, young woman by heart isn't something Harry have any experience with. Because that's something he never thought to cross.
Harry looked up from his plate, "Curfew at eight—
“I didn’t say that” Harry stated, not really keen in talking about something so personal in his life to Hermione. He knows how Hermione can be. She’s smart and intelligent but there are times that she can be one-sided and favor what she thinks should be favored.
“That’s my round two calling. Bye daddy, bye baby boy!”
Dracy didn’t want to look at how would those eyes are staring at him but she was compelled to. So, when she turned her eyes and gaze at the handsome man, she nearly gasped for the soft smile that took its place on his lips.
“We should take extra precaution and avoid stressing the mom. No to skipping meals and make sure to eat healthy. If you think there’s a problem, owl or floo me immediately. There are chances that apparition makes the mother dizzy so if we could avoid that unless it’s a matter of urgency and emergency, we avoid”
“Fine, fine. Let’s both be sirius here. So what’s the issue? You fucked the boy and what? Obviously fuck him more”
Something Lucius Malfoy needs.
“Mon chou” Harry bowed and handed him a stem of tulips, “I hope our love continues to blossom like this flower”
It felt heavenly. The way the cock is resting in Draco’s tongue, Harry cannot even control his roughness properly which didn’t seem to be a problem because Draco is obviously enjoying it as much as he is.
He gulped, suddenly feeling unsure.
Dracy cannot stop looking at herself in the mirror. She keeps on twirling around and making sure her dress don’t have any wrinkles and she really cannot magically make sure because she doesn’t have a wand. She’s not sure whether she still can remember how to cast a simple levitating charm. She’s also not good with wandless magic even before.
“Good morning” Harry whispered, sliding down to kiss Draco on the jaw and giving him another love bite on the neck.
It didn’t take long until he felt Harry preparing him with lubed fingers, stretching him wide open, making him feel good with thick digits, prodding with slight pain but tingling pleasure. At the first touch of his sensitivity inside, he clenched around him tight.
“Daddy, feels so good” he moaned, “Feels so good. Please, daddy. More, need more”
“Stay still”
“Not a word” he repeated as he crawled above him, “Do you understand me?”
Harry sighed. That’s the issue. He doesn’t want to be promoted just because he was ‘famous’. He wanted to earn things because he worked for it. True, being privileged is nice but it only feeds on his ego.
He gulped and swallowed whatever shame and mocking he’ll get later on. He wouldn’t risk losing a game so he flag down what pride inside him. With careful movements, he raised a hand and did it. Blew some kiss over Harry’s place who lightened up and laughed.
His forehead creased, “Why? Why are you doing this?”
“As I’ve told you, it’s nothing deadly”
“Harry?” she asked, her voice felt small.
“That’s it. Fuck, that’s it, Draco. You look so pretty like this” he whispered as he started to chase his own orgasm, “So beautiful for me. All mine now”
“I like you, doll”
“I’m sorry for shouting at you” she apologized for her own mistakes as well, “Sorry for demanding things without considering how you feel”
“Is that so, tiger?” he stated more than questioned, playful and menacing. She felt the tingling in her spine and she knew then she’ll be fucked. Figuratively and literally.
“What do you think you’re doing?” he coldly asked, “Leaving again, are you? To where?”
“That’s it,” Harry agreed, “That’s it. Let ‘em out, baby. Let those pretty little noises out. Wanna hear ‘ya moaning for me. Hear the effect I have on you”
Draco giggled delightedly. He didn’t know Harry could be this cute. His hand that was caressing his beard a second ago slid down to feel Harry’s muscles above the shirt he’s wearing, the hardness contradicted his soft palm, the way it felt so good on him nearly had him moaning. His daddy is just so fucking sexy. Makes him want to roll his eyes at the back of his head.
The first dom he has in his whole life. Who would’ve expected he’ll be calling him ‘sir’? He gulped as he took his pants off as well and neatly folding them up. Down to his lace, he hesitated for a moment,
But she knows how Alphas and Omegas differ in their psychological, physical, intellectual functions. Alphas are born naturally confident and Omegas are born introduced to such things. And she was taught how to be dashingly confident which slowly diminished over time.
She blinked for several times, fingers trembling as she felt the palpitations that assaulted her being.
Harry hummed, “Good girl”
“Eager. I like that” Cockybee said.
He bit his lips at the sight. Harry’s coat hang at the back of his chair, sleeves rolled to his elbow, veins visible all for him to witness., “Hey, Senator” he waved a hand suggestively, jutting his hips to the side.
The shame, the wrath, and the confusion all written on their faces was worth it.
Harry nearly choked on his water for what Draco had answered. He cannot tell! Fuck! They cannot reveal!
” he cried out, back arching as he inserted another finger and began to earnestly finger fuck himself, making sure to stretch him wide.
He tried to shrug it off nonchalantly and quickening with his work. He slightly recoiled when an index finger grazed the back of his hand. He looked up and met the man’s mischievous gaze. His eyes traveled from the customer to the man across the room looking at their interaction.
He legs threatened to close around Harry’s waist but he somehow managed to keep them apart, determined to lay there open like he wants to. This is what he wants, to have the all too good Senator in the bed, have his way with him.
“She’s pregnant”
Harry’s eyes widened and pushed Draco away. He swore loudly. His day has already been fucked enough for what the Aurors had caused from the spying with the Russian wizards and now, Draco is ruining his evening.
“Yes. Some biker gang just tried to mess with us but nothing to worry. We got this, go see your lover boy”
But by a man who's hidden underneath those dim lights, covered in smoke and what Draco can assume to be are intentions out of fantasy turned the tables for his own gain. He called out, offered a hand without really doing so, stepped in the boundary Draco set for himself.
He laid there for a while and panted. Harry’s words sliding through his right ear and out to his left one. He bit his lips and smirked after he regained his composure.
He was aware his disappearance might lead to skeptical thoughts on the young boy’s side. He didn’t even owl him or flooed to tell him where he is. He just left.
His eyes rolled back. His mind going back to that memory. The start of their explorations, their journey.
He’s got this warm demeanor and a whole edge of kindness. He’s friendly and always so welcoming. It’s no wonder whenever people come in and go at Harry’s flower shop to buy flowers or in most cases, steal a glance of their heartthrob or in even most cases, try to have chance with the kind man.
Harry cooks for her, always making sure she eats healthy foods, makes her snacks, sometimes feeds her o his own. He would always wait until she’s fast asleep before he goes to take his own rest. His arms wrapped around her tightly, making sure she’s safe and protected even if there’s obviously no harm in the house.
“You lot need to study. The exams are coming in soon!” he grumbled in annoyance, looking around the table and actually looking petrified that he’s the only one taking things seriously.
He bit his lips, seducing and trying to draw him into giving in. But this omega right here have the strongest control Harry had ever seen in any omega he had ever met. Draco is very poised, sophisticated, liked by many bachelors in the Ministry and he did not give in to any one of them.
And as one by one, they scattered off, Draco returned his eyes on Harry who was currently smiling at him, “Thank you so much, angel. I love you”
“I’ll call Arthur or Molly, okay? Calm down. He’ll join, I know him. He’s a curious man” he kissed her by the temple and hugged her after, “Now, come along. They’ll be arriving in a minute”
“You look sexy”
Dracy’s lips parted, perplexity written all over her face, “But you’re an Alpha” her mouth spoke on its own.
He’d been taking to Pansy about Harry and the way he left him twice. She was mad but they really can’t do anything, can they?
“Come on, kitten. Fuck, clenching around me so tight. Doing so good and begging so beautiful, bunny” Harry whispered roughly, harsh breaths puffing out of his chest as he stared at the pretty sight before him. Draco’s tears wetting the blindfold followed by the moans falling from his mouth. And it was such a glorious sight.
He shrugged. He doesn’t care anyways. Shacklebee loves him. He wouldn’t fire this exuberating Alpha who has been demeaned by the rumors outside his work life. He’s just a man, right?
“Harry, Harry, I-I’m. . .” she cut herself off, unable to finish the sentence as she arched her back into the air and gushed out her orgasm, moaning at her overstimulation  as the Alpha did not pause or even slowed down with his movements.
Harry raised a hand, contemplating for a second because he never lay a hand without consent but when Draco’s lips parted and how his eyes dilated for a moment. He knows he will win soon.
“You’re just a horny alpha who can’t get his dick to shut up”
It's good that he has a closet full of lingerie and sexy outfits that he would love to wear in front of Harry. Show how fresh he is and how he would be tasty in Harry's tongue. He shuddered at the imagination of Harry's tongue licking him in places he had not let other guys to, simply because they are not a man.
He gripped his cup and continued to scowl. He hates this man. He hates this man. He fucking hate him!
She nodded in response. Thighs brushing with one another to relieve herself which Harry definitely noticed.
Harry winked and blew him a kiss he was quick to brush away, “Ew! Go away!”
Harry hummed, palm gliding up to caress his arms and consoling with honest forgiveness, “I wronged you just as much, baby. It’s okay now”
“Hmm” Dracy whimpered, tensing in his arms and Harry groaned and helped her to move her hips harder and thrusted his hips upwards to meet hers and after a few seconds, Dracy shivered and tensed.
“So Star—
Oh, shit. This is almost as good as his intense orgasm. He smiled and went to open drawers and looking through the folders stacked at the desk. He looked around for anything useful until he came across a brown envelope that has a label that came as ‘Senatorial Plans’.
Arriving by apparition perhaps is not a good idea. She nearly stumbled to the pavement for the dizziness that strike her. Good thing Harry’s reflexes quickly caught her and helped her to stand.
He is able to turn her on and the way he lapped her cum off of his fingers was hot and sexy.
“Pansy!”
“Ladies and gents, what a lovely morning”
“The potion, Professor. Back in the hospital wing you said… you said it’s harmless and we might act strange” he toyed with his fingers, “But the thing is, I’ve also been feeling strange”
Harry looked up at Draco and immediately felt his chest warming. That blissful expression he had while leaning his cheek on his palm, the smile, and that angelic beauty. How he would’ve love to take a photo out of it, put it in a frame, adorned with latin scribbling of compliments, with words of adoration, and his prowess.
Dracy fought the urge to gasp or pant or fuck, whimper.
The bartender walked over to his place and smiled. Dashing, more dashing than these lights.
Sirius shrugged, “It co-exists with your world. But hidden away from muggles. We do not want to risk our world with your hot poky stuff, right?”
“K-knot me. Knot me, please alpha” Dracy murmured and Harry growled and cussed, “Fuck fuck. Ooh”
“What the fuck?” he kicked the cabinet, doubling over in pain.
What was he so scared about?
Harry smiled and intertwined their fingers together, “Had a small talk with McGonagall” he answered, pecking a kiss on his forehead.
Smooth motherfucker. Draco tried not to roll his eyes. Words won’t get him anywhere but why is there a tingling sensation at his nape? Code black. Some serious shit is going on and Harry’s causing it!
“D-don’t you think it’s late for my forgiveness?”
Her nails dig crescent moon shapes on his back as she mewled at the lavish attention on her chest down to her pussy.
He giggled, “I do but you’re old. Tomorrow, you will have white hairs”
“I just sort of winged it. She was my bestfriend before she became anything else more. I didn’t know it was her until one day, I just looked at her and wondered why would it not be her?” she chuckled, “I don’t ask questions like you do, Harry. I don’t figure things out. That’s not how I do it. Because like you, Luna knew before I did. She’s definitely the brains in this relationship, I’m the jock” she winked.
Maybe it was a  mistake to suddenly ask Harry if he could mark her. Because now, he’s nowhere to be found. Like yesterday, the day before that, the day before that, the day before the day before that and so on.
“Thank you, Andy” she said, letting Harry guided her to sit up but wincing when she felt the heaviness of her breasts. Again. She’d been lactating nonstop and she’s wondering whether she really just have that much milk or whatever.
“Come on, baby. Finish what you started” he gave her hair a tug and she moaned.
“Exhausted expression, tensed shoulder, pursed lips, and a furrowed eyebrows. So what can be the problem, little prongs? My nephew too much energetic for your old skills?” his godfather tried to lighten the mood but Harry was too serious to even joke back.
The next day, Draco wake up with red brimmed eyes. Being alone in the house, he had a time with his thoughts. He felt guilty for running off like that.
“Fuck, oooh” he sobbed, fingers sliding down even more to tease through his sensitive perineum, giving it feathery touches and moaning loudly.
“I’m good, thanks. How are you, Professor?” he asked kindly, a tad uncomfortable when McGonagall did not even blink at him. She raised one eyebrow at him, eyes trailing down from head to toe before it settled back on his face.
There’s no way he’d appreciate that hand holding his own, fingers connected and sharing a little of his body heat to him. There’s just no way. Error. Troubleshoot needed.
Harry shook his head, looking straight at Draco's innocent eyes. The dragon buried deep inside, the dragon who was able to tame Harry's control. The one who seduced him into giving in. The one who pushed him to let go every ounce of decency two years ago and pounce on him like a desperate predator.
“Fuck Draco” Harry groaned and Draco nodded in agreement, yes, fuck Draco.
He grounded her to his hard cock and she moaned in the sensation. Her pussy quivering and throbbing, slick already wetting her knickers and when he pushed her to his covered erection again, he felt the wetness in her knickers and her arousal very visible in the air.
The man offered a hand, “Luke”
“Why don’t we sit down, hmm?”
Fuck, he too, is playing with fire.
“H-harry, please, fuck,
He tried to kick it with more force and he only stirred for a bit, “Pottery!”
He cannot seem to have enough. He wanted more but didn’t dare to act on it now. Feeling Dracy’s face buried in his neck, her lips faintly touching at his skin and the feel of the small body in his is making his Alpha try to find its way out more.
Draco looked at him and sighed, “No”
“It was Draco” they stated in unison, index fingers pointed straight at him and he looked at them scandalized. How dare these vermin!
Harry laughed and handed him the box of chocolates, “Alright, doll”
“Actually I can”
Draco nodded once again.
His actions were captivating and sultry as Harry thrusted into that wet heat and gripped Draco’s head tight to still his movements allowing Harry to face fuck the  bewitching little boy who cracked his binds.
He was left staring down at the floor, his feet dirty as he trembled. Vaguely aware if it’s from cold or from fear or maybe, both.
“Please, Re. Take me”
“So good, little one. So good” Harry whispered as he pulled out. Draco whined at the loss immediately and Harry shushed him gently. He cleaned them both with a spell as he zipped himself up.
Harry chuckled at that, "I like you, angel"
Draco sobbed.
Draco gasped and his back arched close to Harry’s chest. This wasn’t like his ex’s kisses. This wasn’t like all the kisses he got from the past.
Certainly not him who suddenly just had a growth spurt and with the help of some exercises, managed to grew some muscles and more bravery. When he stepped out of the train, he staggered a little bit as a blonde woman appeared  in front of him.
Draco can attest to that like full hundred percent. Harry is his superior, sure. Draco can respect that because everyone knows Harry is amazing at what he does. He’s excellent in hand to hand combat, level headed in investigations, rational in judgment and adding to his hero-complex, damn he could as well be the savior of everyone.
He looked away before he blacked out on the spot.
She sobbed on her hands. She doesn’t think she can afford to lose Harry. She had grown fond of him and was hoping to bond with him but she really doesn’t know now.
She pouted, “But—
“H-harry” he tried to call.
He leaned on the counter, not bothering to sit by the stool as he waved over to the bartender who knows him better than anyone in this place. The bartender immediately got to work, already knowing his order.
Tom turned to them. Eyes inspecting them for a second before it settled on the rings on their fingers, “Newly weds?”
“Relaxation will help you be at ease” he whispered lowly, bending down and stretching his hand across Harry’s clavicle, fingers digging into the skin to feel more of him, touch more of him now that he had felt how hot he can be, “I can help you, Harry”
Draco shrugged his shoulders easily and waved his hand, "Sure."
“I love you. You know that right? Don’t cry, love.” he whispered, pulling away, his thumb caressing his soft cheek.
Draco lightened up and smirked.
He smiled and looked around. He really doesn’t know where he wants to go first. There’s just a lot and as he began to walk around aimlessly, observing if he’ll catch something he’s interested in.
The sound of skin slapping echoed through the place. It was a miracle there are no people around the parking lot yet or maybe there are. Maybe they haven’t noticed it yet for how occupied they are to one another.
“Good morning, sugar!”
“Enough” Harry whispered but Dracy is not having any of it. She’s going to let it all out!
She bit her bottom lip and looked back at him before she hesitantly nodded, “I wanna go along with you. I’m going to be beside you all the time”
Luna’s a bit stranger to some people but the way she speaks as if she knows something he doesn’t put him off a bit. And with the gentle smile Luna gave him makes his heart hammer inside his chest.
Draco slightly propped himself in the table and stared at him inquisitively. Waiting for his answer and his expression displayed that he will be having endless supply of questions to amuse himself from the boredom of being left alone.
His ears began to ring as his soul felt as if it was laughing at him. He looked at his father in disbelief. Surely, he’s jesting? He gulped before turning his eyes to her mother who looked just as serious though her eyes held some sympathy.
They cheered among the crowd, faces not really visible for how dim the lights are above them but it didn’t deter him. More so, he was even motivated to give it his best like always.
Remus matched his smirk, his hands stopping at his inner thighs, “Haven’t you had enough?”
“How’s the baby doing?” Hermione asked as she gave Dracy a friendly hug.
He’s still freaking out. From the way he had been so fucking blind and so fucking enthralled that he didn’t have the strength to walk away. He’s sure his grandfather would stare at him with contempt.
“You got to have some explaining to do. Sit” Draco pointed at the guest chair in front of him before Harry noticed what he was holding.
He failed to respond to Harry’s kiss as he closed his eyes, sobbing and temporarily forgetting anything else rather than the buzzing in his ear and the groans coming out from Harry.
“Yes, please”
Their moment was disrupted when an unfamiliar owl came knocking by the window. Harry sighed. Is that work calling?
“Green, daddy. Please, please, please. I want you. Please”
His eyes drop lower, the knowledge that the omega’s nipples are only covered by that blouse, all naked underneath is driving him nuts.
“Alright beans, settle down. Why don’t you all go wash up before dinner?” Harry easily shushed their children up.
“Okay” she mumbled, “So, what are you doing here?”
The bartender sported the biggest smile ever and raised his hands, signaling his index finger as if to tell him to lean in so he could introduce himself. And he did.
His eyebrows furrowed and what a fucking sight. It’s not always Remus can prompt a confusion in that lovely face.
He stopped when he encountered another door when he rounded the right wing of the huge house. So the apartment he’s staying in must be a cover then. Of course with all those payments he saw from the drive, that man is living lavishly in secret.
Harry turned around and raised an eyebrow at him. Draco stood beside him, hands rubbing up and down Harry’s back, “Sorry. Had to finished some household chores”
“Daddy” Draco complained, opening one eye, “Lie with me” he pouted.
When they were finally gone, Harry pulled her to the kitchen and immediately got on to make her something to eat, “Would you like some cookies and pumpkin juice?” the man asked while beginning to prepare the ingredients on the kitchen counter.
Draco felt a hand wiping the sweat on his forehead as he laid there panting.
Ever since Draco and Harry have been official, they have done nothing but slow vanilla sex. Always gentle, affectionate and intimate. He’s not complaining, of course. After all, he craves that too. It makes him feel what they have is true and real.
“Why the fuck are you my husband?!” he’s just ready to faint. Faint and toss every braincell into the next century.
“Nice to meet you, Lily. I am Narcissa Malfoy and this is my husband, Lucius Malfoy”
Blaise came in after with some handcuffs and a tie. He quickly gave him a once over before gathering Tom out of the house before Pansy came swooping in.
“Hmm” Harry hummed when his baby boy was no longer in sight. He chuckled and shook his head. That was so fucking undeniably hot. He looked at his cock, still twitching with desire and lust. Fuck, he looked so touch starved.
“Sugar, I can’t read French” he whispered, hiding his face under the menu to not humiliate himself.
Fingers grasped his chin, “Can I?”
Sirius broke into a proud grin and clapped his hands excitedly, “I knew it! So did you take my advice about spicy lubricant? Did you bent him? How flexible do you think he was?”
“Let me out and I’ll show you how good I can dominate you”
Ron nodded considerably before looking at him for a minute again and Harry felt slightly put off of his scrutiny.
He avoided him like the new disease that rocked the world.
Ron nodded and studied him for a pointless moment, “Have you thought about claiming her yet?”
“No songs. The whole night”
“Fuck” Harry groaned at the title, “Let’s go to your house”
Dracy was left staring at the door Harry walked out off.
Harry didn’t waste any time until he was dragging Draco into the staffs room and locking the door.
Draco crossed his arms and sobbed.
Harry growled and wandlessly spelled his fingers some lube and within a second, he felt the smooth and soft liquid on his fingers, having it poured over to Draco’s ass to his perineum and he moaned.
She blushed and smiled, “Yes, please”
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked after giving her tummy some attention he deemed was necessary.
Oh, boy. Here we go.
And as his own mind asks his own fallen heart whenever he watches Harry leave,
“Alpha” she called softly when he pulled away, “Relax, darling”
“Calm down, doll. That’s obviously a lie. I mean, we didn’t even kiss”
“You okay?”
“Harry” Dracy called. She raised her head and looked at him and what she saw was something she never thought she’d ever see on the Alpha. Vulnerability looked so heartbreaking in him. She’d rather have the mysterious Alpha back in the day they just met and someone who may not have been so warm but surely was affectionate.
Draco bit his lips, “Like with a gun or you know, dinner?”
“Baby, come on”
But Draco is different. He’s not some pick-up wizard on the streets. No, no. He’s a jewel. A worthy person.
She gasped, “How many safe houses do you have?”
“I like you. I really do”
Harry let out million-galleon smirk, “That meeting killed me”
It’s intriguing. Why those hands can turn him on so much. How he finds that dark and husky voice appealing. He would do everything to hear it forever. Have it only and only will be directed to him.
Patience. Patience. They’re both lucky Harry had long realized he harbor an unbelievably longest stretch of patience for this particular omega. It’s one of the reasons Harry managed to handle the words he had heard from him and maybe, that sexiness too.
It was no denial that his captor was dangerously attractive, misleading and coercing. He was muscled, strong, and rigid. Cold but warm.
“C’mon” Harry interlaced their fingers distractedly as they began to follow the suspect.
Why is Tom interrogating him?! He chuckled to hide the creeping anxiousness at the back of his head and shrugged, hoping the action is as nonchalant as he aspired it to be.
Oh, he's handful alright.
The walk was a smooth sailing, Harry’s hand tightening for a fraction as they reached a black door, opened slightly ajar with a faint noise coming from inside.
Harry tilted his head to the side as he stared at those sexy feet, wearing a nice emerald heels to his exposed knees to his legs to the thighs that’s covered with a thin layer of his dress up to his lovely chest to that mouth watering beauty.
When he opened his eyes the next morning, he jolted awake and sat up quickly.
Booooring.
But the problem with this independent, strong, and resilient omegas are they know how to resist him because they are aware of how he changes every damn day.
That's something that his great great grandfather created and taught the Potter family members because his son nearly bedded a young teen.
She smiled at the idea, arms wounding around Harry’s waist. The idea to stay in Harry’s arms for the whole day excites her but she already agreed to go out with him.
"Comin', kitten"
"Or leave you here all alone? Naked and leaking like a bitch in heat?"
“I am sorry, sir. I tried to stop—
“Are you okay?”
Draco have his own shared experiences as well. Maybe not too many like Harry’s but they were enough to tell him he’s off horny Alphas. Beds different omegas night after night, lies after lies and flowery tongue after flowery tongue.
“I’m going to hand you the Whomping  Willow’s ass, Finnigan” Pansy glared.
“Love, don’t mind them” Harry whispered to his husband when he noticed the way he flinched yet still tried to keep his expressions stoic. He tightened his hold of his hand and tried to drag him to the nearest shop in Diagon Alley.
He glared down at him. Not appreciating what he said back at the dining, “Who?” he asked, his right hand gliding to Draco’s wrist upwards to his arms to his sharp collarbone.
Harry settled beside her as he pulled her close and wiping her sweat, “What does my baby girl needs, hmm?”
“Suck” he ordered, putting two fingers in front of his mouth and Sirius obliged, opening his mouth, sucking while imagining it is Remus’ thick cock he has in his mouth.
“Harry” she moaned blissfully, her eyes closing and fully aware of the soft drag of his hard cock inside her, prodding and nudging at her slick flesh and preening at the sensation the slow pace Harry opted on for tonight.
He shrugged as he smirked. He was right.
He cleared his throat. Alright, this is enough. He massaged his temples and looked at her directly in the eyes, “I know my mistakes, Hermione. But I’m pretty sure I am not entirely incompetent”
“No cumming until I say so, bunny” he reminded, his fingers playing with his perineum, his touch making his skin sensitive as it prickled through his system.
Sirius grinned deviously. Oh, he will love this, “I know the best one. But he, for sure, won’t do things for free”
His cum soaked through Harry’s shirt and his own stomach as he leaned all of his weight on his strong boyfriend, loosing all strength.
“Why did Flitwick think it’s right to ask kids,
By now, he would’ve been having fun with his friends. Buying robes and nice clothes and gifts for Nott, not this.
“Of what?” Harry asked.
He sighed. He knew he’s been cruel and he doesn’t need them rubbing it in more.
But as an equal? She didn’t know. Many people have reduced her into someone to be called like a slut, a hole to fuck. Harry had brought her for thousands of galleons from that shitty bar she used to work in and she had fully expected that she was going to be treated worse.
He sobbed.
“Shit”
Harry extended his hands, “Come on, now. Get down here, doll” he said softly, aware of the eyes that’s watching them and those phrases that very much don’t fall under appreciative ears.
Pansy’s eyes shot up and grinned joyfully, “Oh you little slut”
“Don’t thank me, darling. It’s my job to take care of my family”
He came with a cry, tears sliding down in his cheeks for the sheer force of a good fuck Harry never fails to deliver,
“Track where Draco’s phone is. He’s gone”
Draco bit his lips before he granted him of what he wanted, “I thought you’re coming back at lunch time”
Whatever the Minister meant, they don’t care. Winning is their ultimate goal.
“Dinner’s about to be cooked and we’ll go rest after that. Sounds good, love?” Harry checked in, giving a kiss to his forehead. Draco nodded and  hummed contentedly.
He, not once had commented to the topic embedded next to his name. Easily ignoring people wanting to know, wanting to prod every little detail they can in his life, to uncover that smirking exterior. Harry let them say what they want, write what they want because everyone knows how these rumors go away in a blink of an eye.
“We’ll have so much fun, baby doll”
Dracy bit her lips to prevent some moans coming out from her mouth and nodded. She really felt okay with Harry’s hands on her compared to those who tried to push their way in. Harry’s Alpha is much more tolerable, captivating, and affectionate but surely not stepping a boundary.
He grumbled and downed the whole bottle. He’s getting tipsy but he ordered Dobby to give him another bottle to get some alcohol bravery. He was about to drink another bottle of firewhiskey when he heard the familiar swoosh of the floo.
Harry was confused by the sound that he heard and he stilled. When did pillows start to talk? He doesn’t remember spelling his pillow to create a sound. Why did his pillow created a noise then?
A wild card if you may. A stop sign. A hazard in the most sexual way possible. A smile that calls, a beauty that never fails, a body to die for, and a name to be proud of. Coming from a family of politicians, he was a constant protagonist of tabloids and interviews and hounding amount of nosy journalists. He was also sometimes deemed to be the villain of his own name.
“WHAT?!”
Harry’s eyes darkened, “Have you been drinking?”
“Come. Come for me, baby. Fuck. So beautiful” Harry complimented breathlessly.
Never did once he tried to occur on his mind that he was disappointed with what happened between them. He didn’t try to think that maybe Harry felt so failed and so bad. He didn’t blame himself for what happened but when third day came, all came crushing down.
Well, maybe it can be covered by the music?
“Look at me, princess” he whispered huskily, “Open your eyes, baby. Want you to look at me”
"Please guard our son while we take care of his grandmother. We will be back as soon as possible. We really cannot just leave him be. He's still a boy"
“Harry” Draco called.
“Here in France?” she asked, lips parting.
He was confused when he found himself at the hospital wing. Memories of what happened came rushing in his mind as he nervously looked around. His hand scrambled to touch his body, from his temple to his neck down to his stomach, making sure all of his body parts are still intact from the accident.
He had woken up a monster. Apparently.
"So, what's the rules?" Draco then asked.
Dracy didn’t know how but she felt amazing. She felt so good and nice. His fingers inside her started to scissor her open, all the while fucking her. She kept on moaning, the possibility of having to see and personally experience what she’d heard from other people is exciting her.
He rolled his eyes and stepped inside, careful not to make any noise.
Draco stepped in right after and locked the door, not bothering to use silencing charms.
He sighed for several times, he tilted his head to the side and stared at the door. His fingers tapping just above his lap, mulling over his choices.
“Dracy” he called. Dracy flinched, startled with Harry’s sudden voice then looked up.
“D-daddy H-har, ohh, Harder”
"I just need to tell them I will be going home first to grab some things" Harry informed, his voice more restrained than usual.
“Merry Christmas. How are you two?” she asked.
“Always tastes good” he complimented and Sirius blushed.
“SHUT UP! It hurts!” Dracy closed her eyes and with one agonizing push, she slumped down at the same time, a baby’s cry resonated through the whole room.
He calmed himself down before sporting an innocent expression, “Coming!”
He made sure to fix his dress. It fitted him like a glove. Sexy and a little bit provoking. But that’s just what he aspires to be. Harry will get riled up and voila, it’s done. He watched from the distance as he waited for the right moment to pounce.
He nearly gave in back there. He nearly acted his dreams and nearly gave Draco what he wanted. He glared and went out of the bathroom with a towel on his waist. He was busy taking clothes out of the closet when he heard a noise from the window.
“Hmm?” he hummed, understanding why Dracy isn’t responding.
“Please, please” she cried out, shaking lightly at the sound of a growl erupting at the back of Harry’s throat. He guided her to grind her hips, allowing her to jolt from the sensations their erotic interaction through their clothes.
Harry chuckled, pulling his head away and grinning when another gasp fell in Draco’s mouth as he gripped his hair and tilted his head up, “Here are your rules, my love”
Harry laid the food tray at the bedside table before sitting down at the edge of the bed. He looked at the peaceful beauty, eyes still closed and hair mussed from sleep. She looks so serene, more so like the muggle princess Sleeping Beauty.
She knew Harry spent too much galleons on her in one trip in Diagon Alley. What they bought were five pairs of lacy bra and panties on different colors, another five in lingerie dress, and one night robe in emerald color. When she checked the price from the nearby saleslady who was fixing a rack, she had told her that one pair costs two hundred and fifty galleons.
He didn’t care how desperate he sounded as he pleaded needily. His lips parted and he mewled when Harry slid his wet finger down to his neck, to his chest before the pad of his fingers found his nipples and tugged on it above the thin cloth covering it.
“McGonagall talked to you?” Dean asked and Harry nodded.
Luke snorted, “I  have a home gym—
He cried. Unconsciously, he leaned his weight to his captor’s body, hands fisting his fitted shirt, trembling when he was close to stare at the threatening gun that can kill him in any second if his captor plans to waste a bullet on him.
“Well, this explains a lot” Harry let out a laugh, “Midnight fucking sale”
He smiled, biting his lips with the mastered innocence he learned to display on his face overtime. "Slowly but surely"
He moaned around Harry’s tongue, sucking him off and nibbling on his lower lip as he arched his torso. Needing and wanting Harry’s touch to him. He wasn’t lying when he said he wanted him too.
She took a deep breath. She know she’ll be satisfied. But this line they’re going to cross would breach a subject they both need to talk to in the future. Her pussy gushed when she felt a kiss in her ear, lips barely touching her skin but it’s there, she felt it.
"Let's continue upstairs"
He growled and was about to lift her up when Dracy pushed him away so he could lean on the counter. Harry’s eyes widened at the action as he looked at her, eyebrows raising in confusion on what the omega is planning to do.
It’s always been so easy to turn away from the boundaries being a Potter had given him. The lines that haven’t been crossed for centuries. Something that was avoided ever since his great grandfather nearly crossed the line and did something that could ruin their name into humiliation.
She walked over to Leo’s spot and offered a hand, “Let’s go see daddy, Leo”
A tone Dracy never heard from the Alpha even when that day when she entered his bedroom without permission.
He went into a rigorous Auror training only to end up falling from his bed? What the hell, right?
"You know, if you really don't want to, you can assign the job to the Auror guards, Harry" Ron kindly suggested.
“If this is your way to try to get into my skirt, you won’t have the chance” Draco mumbled but still sat down on his chair and relaxed himself on it.
Harry sighed, "They really do start late. You have two hours to be there"
Lightly, he grazed his knuckles on that soft flesh, “One day, sweet omega. One day you will bend over or maybe, even more. You know, we can’t be so sure”
Personal reasons. What could they be? It was obvious Dracy knows nothing about the Alpha. He’s too secretive of his personal life.
“Yes” Harry answered.
Draco whimpered, “Yes, yes and more”
He heard the small grunts and heavy breath from him, can feel the weight he was holding to keep himself from crushing him and with his covered eyes, staring into the abyss of darkness, Draco can almost see what is currently happening.
Where the hell is it?
“Why did you think this was a good idea, Malfoy? Centaur’s piss! What the fuck!” Harry casted several cleaning and refreshing charms on the both of them, scowling to the best of his abilities, “What the fuck!”
He swayed his hips and lowered it towards the guy's crotch. Harry glared at it severely. Holy aguamenti. House of Potter morals. He's trying to call on things to guide him through the whole process of Draco's lap dance to fucking someone.
Harry felt bad but the way Draco was speaking so admirably, so calm, collected, and the way his voice didn’t hold any malice but the honest tenderness and intimacy somehow eased his guilt away.
The unspoken arrangement goes on like that over and over again.
To have him on his bed is something that felt too impossible and yet, here they are. Kissing, moaning, writhing flesh touching rough skin.
“Daddy!” Draco cries out. He gripped Harry’s head tight.
He’d really fucked up. He knows things have changed and he had officially stepped out of bounds. The bounds that carefully kept the name Potter on its nobility.
“I’m sorry for ignoring you” he kissed her heart.
She stood before him as their surroundings faded into a blurry jade. That’s one of Harry’s mastered ability. The way he earns her attention like no other and in turn, the way he returns the fervor equally.
Harry snorted, tossing the letter aside, “Why don’t we go take a bath, baby?”
"Where are we going to apparate?" Harry asked just as got out of the Manor.
Draco nodded hesitantly.
“Alpha” she whimpered, her head kept turning left and right and for a few while, she would try to turn her head to look at the man who’s taking her from behind.
“G-green. Fuck, daddy. Fuck me, please,
He stood up abruptly and stepped away. Draco chuckled, watching him walk away with a flustered expression.
Draco did not expect to be complimented but it wasn’t unappreciated.
Love.
“Okay” he started and paused for a minute to get his attention, “I need help”
“Even if it isn't, is this so bad?” he blinked innocently, pulling his finger out with a pop and smiling at him, “I can feel you tensing in my touch. Just give in, Senator”
He pulled his hand away from his cock as he slid it down to his perineum, teasing and tickling as Draco’s body jerked with the sensation, his hips beginning to roll but Harry held him back and stared at him sternly.
"Daddy?"
So, maybe, his parents will rethink their agreement about the matter.
Harry’s hand settled on the side of her waist and squeezed tightly, offering his silent comfort.
It was Harry who proved him he wasn’t the freak he thought he was for desiring to be someone rather than be someone his birth dictated him to. He was so accustomed with sneering that he had problems smiling at Harry at first.
He clenched his jaw. He wanted to talk to Draco, wanted to demand why he rejected then ran away but Hermione had convinced him it’s best they give time to avoid the chance of adding insult to injury.
“So wet for me, Dracy” he whispered and inserted a finger which hugged him immediately and he felt the wetness and heat inside her. Her slick is dripping to his thighs and he felt the sharp throb of his cock.
A person whose name is loved by most, idolized by all, and had successfully garnered the mass media’s liking.
Harry stepped closer and stopping few inches from him. The silence was deafening and his mind stopped because the moment Harry kneeled, flower petals were being thrown at them, followed by cheers, playful whistles and encouragement.
He bit his tongue hard when Harry lifted a hand, expecting to take some blow only to feel him brushing stray hairs away from his face and tucked it behind his ear. His thumb lingering at his cheeks. A little calloused but Draco had a harder time controlling his knees from buckling down.
Harry shook his hand with the Minister right after their meeting, putting statements out to conclude the torturous hour he have to sit upright on the swivel chair, with people of different departments and talking about Merlin knows what.
His eyes looked straight at the ceiling, feeling as though he was seeing shapes as Harry laved his tongue on his sternum, fingers twisting and pulling on his nipple. It wasn’t long until his mouth took the other nipple and sucked on it harshly. Noises echoing from his throat.
He made sure he is giving Harry a nice show because he wants to tell him that his baby boy should never ever get jealous or all hell breaks loose.  He doesn’t want to be riled up like he does to his daddy because he knew he wouldn’t handle it very well.
It’s not like she doesn’t want to be with her but she was curious as to what this emergency is all about and before she could even begin to worry, Hermione would rush to her side and assure her it’s not something that would harm him or her or their child for that matter.
Merlin.
“Welcome back, Harry” she saw him removing his coat and not quite looking at her yet.
Hello! I'm very sorry for the late update. I had an emergency I needed to take care of and just wrote this an hour ago.
An hour after holding shopping bags on his hand, Harry waited on the bench as Draco excused himself to go to the restroom. He patiently stayed there for a whole fifteen minutes before he started to get a little restless.
“I’m taking a leave”
“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at somewhere.
James instantly raise his hands in mock surrender, laughing, “Ohoh. Easy there, lioness. I never did such a thing. You know how our son can be”
He took this job because it called out to him. Be as bold, as voyeuristic, as someone who moves to enchant the crowd, charm them for his  benefit, woo them with his moves, call out without a word.
"Hmm. So tell me about this Malfoy kid" Ron said, "Is he really spoiled? A brat? A handful?"
At lunch, they would eat their lunch in the dining, most times Dracy would sit on his lap, eat from the same plate and at dinner, they would simply eat on their own and have a casual talk, of their plans for the next morning.
Draco shook his heads frantically, “no, no” he whined, “Already did. Just please, put it on me”
“Be a good boy and tell me,” the man paused, brushing a stray of hair away from his sweaty forehead before gripping his nape once more, “Do you want to be punished or do you want to be mine?”
he felt back at the Great Hall.
He melt on his arms when his captor lifted him up easily, making his way towards the cabin. He was easily navigating the forest, easily knowing where’s where without trails, symbols, arrows, signs.
“Kneel, kitten”
He looked peaceful.
The whole place fell silent and Draco's grin grew but wiped it after Harry glared at him once more, replacing it with an innocent look and a pout.
His balls tightened and his legs tensed, he clenched around nothing which he did not think about this time. He pulled on Harry’s hand. He kissed his fingers one by one, feeling the way he smiled around his cock.
“Good morning”
There was just this question inert somewhere, waiting to be asked. It may not be the right time now but when is exactly? Never once did he feel something as real as this but question’s there.
Ron sighed, “We went to observe the rogue Russian wizards”
“You’re going to be begging me before the day ends, sweetheart” Harry chuckles, lips trailing down his clavicle as he pulled his thumb out. Fingers brushing his pale skin, rounding his nipples wetly, “You’re going to be so desperate for me to stuff you full”
For the next hour, Dracy was nothing but a ball of nerves. Confused and definitely curious to where Harry is taking her. The man wouldn’t even budge even when she begged him to tell her where. He stood strong even when she used her cutest doe eye ever.
“G-green! Keep, fuck, going, please” Draco answered as best as he can. His mouth hanging loosely as Harry began to fuck him with his fingers relentlessly, prodding at his prostate then avoiding it for the next minute.
She gulped when the song ended and Harry made a beeline. He tapped her dance partner in the shoulder and when he turned around to look, she felt him tensed. Of course, everyone knows Harry fucking Potter. The man who was elected Minister of Magic who fucking declined the opportunity.
“It’s the public, baby. Won’t it be too much for you?”
He cannot be having some love potion inside him! But it explains why he suddenly found himself appreciating Potter’s physique a while ago. There’s just no way he’s finding Harry handsome!
The man cleared his throat, aware of the tension between the both of them as he took a step to the side and pulled his hands away from her.
“How dare you!” before she could even stop herself, she raised a hand and slapped him! Harry’s head turned to the side with the impact, the loud smack resonating throughout the room and Dracy didn’t even feel an ounce of guilt. If ever, she felt better.
“Daddy, daddy” he chanted as Harry nudged on his prostate, his cock leaking more and he felt his lungs lacking of air as his feet began to shake even more, threatening to move from its place.
"I've noticed that your luggage is still not settled. Let me show you your room" Draco stood up and began walking. Harry had no choice but to follow him.
He sighed. Harry didn’t find himself regretting what happened but he just think it was wrong. It is wrong. Maybe not in Draco’s eyes but it is in their family. And that’s what he should make the boy understand. But how could he?
His jaw dropped as he took in his appearance. He was still wearing his usual leather jacket and jeans outfit but his hair have been styled and is he wearing some lip tint?
“Oh, please, sir. Please” he murmured, tugging on his hands, wanting to touch every bit of Harry’s skin, let it wander along his bulging muscles to his prominent v-line down to his hard cock, to his balls. Fuck, want them all.
“Kitten”
He did not listen.
“I’m craving” she nibbled on her lips, eyes looking all over at Harry’s face and lastly, staying at the beard. Who would’ve thought that a bearded Harry could be so hot?
Ron shrugged and stared at him seriously, "I know you, Harry. Whatever it is, don't dare"
Dracy blushed, “Ahm—
Harry chuckled, walking away from the wall and blindly stirring them somewhere else. His right hand skated to the bottom of his spine until it reached his nape and gripped tight.
The gossips intensified and Harry had to resist himself from lashing out. Don’t they have lives to mind at all?
“Always smells so fucking sweet” Harry murmured, kissing behind her ear before moving down to kiss at her shoulder. He held her by the hips again and guided her to step inside the bathroom.
He just needs to do something more important to comfort her. Ron will finish the dirty work for him, out of Dracy’s attention.
She moaned and sobbed as she came apart completely. Her juices gushing out of her hole and clenching around him tight. Her body grew limp as she breathed heavily, racing with oxygen.
Draco’s mouth opened in realization. He didn’t expect they’ll be broaching the subject. He thought it was just him, the thing that felt churning and twisting but painless. He thought he dreamt it or even just imagined it.
He felt the air shifted between them. He can feel Harry’s arousal and he is living for it. A cold and glaring Harry is so tempting.
Harry smiled at her even more, his hand moving and brushed a finger at her bottom lip, “I can’t say for sure”
“I need this for my lineage, doll”
“Fine. But do think about what I said” Hermione stood up and left his office.
“That’s not what I meant, doll”
He has to hold himself back. He imagined it was Harry’s cock he’s sucking on as he pulled it back, sticking his tongue out and slid his tongue all over the shaft. His other hand pushing the lace panties aside and teasing his own hard cock.
McGonagall hummed, her slender fingers tapping impatiently on her armchair. Her eyes scrutinized him for some reason, her gaze prickling deep in his face. For a bit moment, Harry was intimidated by the suddenness of her action.
She keened at the sensation of his teeth biting and lips sucking. She knew there’d be a mark, a huge one for that matter. A symbol of his claim.
They haven’t talked about it yet. Not yet decided whether he’ll go to the Burrow or stay back in Hogwarts to celebrate.
Unable to control himself, Draco stilled on his seat and lips parted for a bit. His eyes changed from pain to a soft brush of something Harry cannot describe. There’s more than sadness, more than the blues from what happened. They somehow managed to retain warmth and adoration.
Draco smiled at his friends. These two needs to get together already. After two or more minutes, they pulled away like it was nothing and Blaise flick the bottle with his wand and it began rotating again.
“Hmm?” and the way he responds like it was really his name makes Harry feel all the butterflies in his stomach.
“Don’t think I didn’t know your plan, Draco” he leaned down to level his head, his hand slid up from their position on his thighs to his hips, squeezing in warning, “Don’t think I can’t see what’s going on inside that pretty little head of yours”
“Don’t worry, Harry Potter. Hogwarts always know what to do”
“Come on! Feast’s waiting” Pansy shouted as they paraded out of the tower in their Weasley sweaters, proudly wearing it with confidence as it gave a semblance of something true and honest.
Casual, muggle like. Not very presentable but in his own way looked very beautiful.
Harry returned to the living room to see Dracy sitting properly and is just staring at her hands on her lap. He sighed. Uncovering a wallflower would be too much work. But would be pleasing to watch her bloom.
He met Ron at the entrance who looked at him and Harry sighed. Here fucking comes those scrutinizing eyes.
“You won’t get any, Parkinson. You don’t have to worry” Seamus said sarcastically, smirking when Harry laughed loudly, nearly spraying his juice in his face.
Harry is giving him a chance. The man who he expected would be overflowing with the hunger for control is giving him the decision, letting him decide even when they both knew it could easily be ripped away from him.
Then his eyes met dark, cold, emerald ones. They were lethal, sharp, jaws rigid but there was a distinct softness in his gaze that somehow made Draco feel more regret. A gnawing feeling twisted inside him as he opened his mouth, trying to talk when the man shook his head and raised his index finger to sign him to shut up.
“I’m here. Ssh, I’m here” he bent down to give her a kiss on her lips, tongue slipping inside and pulled a nice french on her before dipping his head low and went on where his mouth wanted to.
Particularly, everyone who knows what Draco harbors for Harry thinks he’s just being a childish personification of useless hating. The needle that pops a balloon and the kind of pranks that just annoys instead of making fun.
He grunted in annoyance and did what every sane man does. He waved his wands to fix the mess on his desk and stood up. He stretched himself and walked out. It’s not going to be a big deal if he’s off work an hour earlier than usual right?
Draco woke up feeling giddy.
Blaise shrugged, “Well, change can be nice”
He pouted and nibbled on his bottom lips. He wants to lay on Harry’s chest and sleep peacefully but how can he sleep serenely when he’s nothing but a set of anxious nerves?
This is the Draco that is not seen by many because they don’t possess the eyes to.
Tom smiled, eyes turning to look at Draco and suddenly, he felt as if he got the spotlight.
“Lils, we’re changing houses”
Eventually, Pansy and Blaise stopped trying to convinced him. They left an hour ago with Pansy’s warning that if his fear get in the way longer than necessary, she’ll pull him out of his shell no matter what.
him and not just beside him.
What—he—fuck!
“Cum for me, kitten. Cum for me first” he whispered, his fingers pulling back from his mouth before it slid down to his buttocks, kneading both cheeks tightly, playing with it.
He only needed to wait for a minute or two. Some customers looking out the windows and talking to one another about the arrival of the infamous bikers.
He holds his hands in public and murmurs I love you’s randomly. He makes sure he’s always okay and always comfortable. He makes Draco feel things he have not yet felt before. Things that isn’t normally seen with others for how much life have evolved and changed throughout the years.
Tom  nodded in agreement, “True, true. There’s no rush in building a family”
"And this is my room" he pointed at the door just across his and Harry hitched a breath.
“Sweetheart, I don’t go to places like that. You know I hate the smell of cigarettes and the lights make me dizzy”
“Fuck” Harry cursed and maneuvered to continuously hit on his bundle of nerves.
Evidence. It’s just what they need so Kingsley could take actions and if they get enough evidence now, the job’s done and he’ll be divorcing Harry immediately.
Dracy wasn’t able to buffer an appropriate response as Harry grabbed a jacket and left the room but before he could fully stepped out, he turned back and gave her a small smile, “Just please leave my room. I really don’t allow anyone inside for personal reasons, Dracy. I hope you understand” he respectfully stated and left. After minutes, she heard the sound of the floo roaring to life.
He ruffled his hair in need to finish all the documents then go to bed, sleep then go to the Ministry tomorrow. But something is trying to knock inside him, clawing its way out and he knows what is it.
“Come on! That’s some kind of liquid luck. Blow him some kiss, Dray. Or we lose” she threatened and before Draco could stop it, Pansy was shouting to the best of her abilities to catch Harry’s attention.
Harry scowled, not really liking the idea of having the other party propose because it should be him to do the effort. It’s just something he was taught to think of.
“Go, go”
“Padfoot” he warned before they all settled on their seat.
He cannot let himself be that sanctimonious, prideful, popularity feeding bastard that’ll hear no end from Mrs. Weasley and Hermione.
Draco eyed him weirdly, “You do realize you’re talking to your secretary?”
Dracy had vented out and believe it or not, Harry actually realized some things. One of which is that Dracy had a point. He has been ignoring him and mainly because Harry cannot find what else to do.
He tried to act nonchalant as he finished his lunch and downed his Pumpkin juice, “Nothing. Just mind your girl’s night” he rolled his eyes for the second time and stood up, eager to leave the Great Hall.
Last night when he was lying in bed, he thought of Draco staying in the other room just across the bedroom he's staying in. He wondered what Draco was doing and wondered if he was thinking him in the same sensual way Harry did. He didn't even had a good night sleep because Draco, bless the young boy, had managed to appear on his dreams and fuck, his image is so fucking good. Looking at him seductively, and those eyes that's convincing him to step closer, touch those sexy legs and have him writhing underneath.
Draco doesn’t want that. Especially when it’s not going to be something that will last long.
The music is booming, yells from people on the dance floor and bodies moving in sync. This is going to be so fun!
Harry’s jaw dropped.
What happened last night keeps on repeating back inside her mind. The way those fingers touched her intimately, fucked her just right, and tired her even when she wasn’t giving but just taking and receiving.
His body jolted as his orgasm took him by surprise, spurting streaks of cum down Harry’s throat who happily swallowed all. Not letting a bit get past his mouth. He lapped at his spent cock, pulling back before sliding his tongue all the way to the bottom to make sure he’s all cleaned before finally, letting go of his softening dick.
“Fuck, baby. Your hand already feels so good” Harry mumbled above her, eyes focused on her, planning to stare at her from start to finish, wanting the image embedded on his mind. This is the first time Dracy goes down on him and would hopefully won’t be the last.
“Are you hungry, Harry?” she asked.
“Your baby’s looking so healthy” Andy smiled, pointing at something they could look at.
"Stiff, tense, too straight"
The bartender leaned down to level his ears and spoke, “I’m Harry Potter but you can call me yours”
“No. Why would you think that?” he asked as if Ron had grown another two extra heads like Fluffy.
When Lucius and Narcissa were settled across them, Lucius shook his head at her, “Coffee will do”
“I’m happy! I’m so happy! I just annoyed Ron by calling him Wonwon! So, how are you?”
He let him ravage him in any parts of his apartment but not once in his bed. He took no offense but he took every pain in his hands. What he needed was assurance but that exactly is too much to ask for when it was obvious of what kind Harry wanted.
Their little beanie inside her, still just as small as a pea. She smiled and put a palm in her tummy, she’s excited for the day her bump will show. She will take care of the life inside her, talk to it and sing lullabies.
Yeah right. Not leaving this place. Nice. So fucking nice.
“Yes” he answered, making sure his voice is cold and not at all, helpless.
He bit his lips and impatiently waited, “D-daddy” he closed his eyes when he felt a hand touched him on his ankle, the fingers gliding smoothly around the area, gently caressing it and coaxing more mewls on his side.
“Lie back on the bed, arms up”
Every end of the week, Draco receives a personalized bouquet of flowers, carefully arranged with a sappy note of Harry's handwriting stashed inside it.
He looked back up and Dracy’s lips parted. She knows her cheeks are burning with shame, color and surprise already, “It’s nice and comfortable” she said without even really feeling how the pumps are to her feet.
He’s nowhere.
His cock is hungry for attention but declined himself to touch it as he bent back down and took Draco’s lips into his. Draco isn’t able to keep up with the kiss so he let Harry do the work as he forced his hands to hug Harry and scratch his back when he inserted another finger.
Harry pants before lifting her up for a bit and quickly unbuckling his belt and taking his hard leaking cock. He shoved her panties to the side all the while murmuring praises after praises, of how sexy she looks on her lingerie has her keening around his words.
"My head really hurts, daddy"
"Too early for the goodies, Zayan." he leaned in and kissed his cheeks.
For a stranger. Fuck, for Harry and just for this selfish night, he will. Maybe after this he can go back to being civil and do what he always do,
This is his third time getting book on the The Lounge but this is his first time getting booked for the whole night with no specific requests of what to expect from him. Normally, they would utter out what they would want from him.
Draco gulped, hands trembling from their places, inching to just reach out and take what he can because
Draco glared at him although Harry was sure there was a faint blush on those lovely cheeks. So fucking cute. What about a blush on the butt?
Draco sighed. Is it okay knowing there’s an unfixed issue between them? Before he could answer, Harry encircled an arm around him and kissed him. He did not hesitate to return with equal fervor. His hands finding their spot on his nape as he moaned into the kiss.
“Harry,
He chuckled when she tried to catch his lips as he pulled away, “Let’s go”
Speaking of which, “Where’s Ginny?”
“The thing is we’re not those people before. You aren’t my Slytherin. You’re my Phoenix. That’s what we are now, isn’t it?”
Harry grabbed some squill bulb and juiced it as he was ordered, making sure not to stare a second too long at Malfoy’s spot. He distracted himself with the squill bulb and let his hand do the work, eyes looking over to the void.
Ron observed him for a moment. From Harry's eyes, the clenching of his jaw, and the way he was massaging his temple, "There's not even a week but you look so stressed already"
Harry sighed and waved a hand before he let her slid down to the floor. She gasped by the soft sensation as her knees touched what should be a cold floor but met with a cushion feeling, comfortable and relaxing.
It’s an utter shock.
Harry blinked in bewilderment. What does that mean?
"Draco" Lucius called his name and Draco stood up, approaching him and offered his hand, "N-nice to meet you, Mr. Potter" he ignored the way he stuttered and gulped. He's still a few considerable inches away from him but he can very much see how broad and muscled he is. Can easily yank his lithe form and have him buried in his chest.
He didn’t need more words as he let himself go and he spurted his cum inside Draco’s throbbing hole.
"Bye! See you!" Draco hugged Pansy and kissed her on the cheek as they bid their own goodbyes, "Bye darling. Be careful"
However, he pulled back before the knot could form and pulled him up to sit. Harry buried his face on his neck, arms hugging him by the neck as they basked on the aftersex.
The bastard only threw in a cheeky wink, “Cheating is not my thing, sweets. And fine, fine but I bet ‘ya sweet ass ‘ya gonna come crawlin’ in my arms”
One command, one order but Draco immediately complied. He took his blouse off and tossed it to the side.
Harry stared at him, “I’m aware thank you”
Draco shook his head aggressively and proceeded to encircle his arms around Harry’s waist.
He’s always been so impossibly lovable and the more he acts like it, the more Draco hungers for what isn’t there.
“Nonsense! You’ll get a martini” Draco waved him off and ordered, “I’ll take a nice vodka”
Lily rolled her eyes. How is this man even more dramatic than she is?
She washed her hands and wiped it on her long skirts after, it was old and loose on the side. No matter how much she wanted to magically fix them, she doesn’t own a wand and she’s too ashamed to ask Harry to do it for her.
Harry smiled. He shook his head when Draco tried to cross Pansy’s statement.
They were in the process of eating their foods when Harry decided to break the amazing silence between them. One of the few times Draco has Harry really shut up but that mouth just cannot. He has to run it at all times.
Sirius scratched his nape and nodded, “Kind of”
Dracy moaned at the words as his mouth went to suck on a nipple. And just the feel of the touch had her feeling slightly better. She wouldn’t tell it to Harry but these past few days, she have grown irritable at the new sensations on her chest.
He decided to push it a little bit further and gently trace his abdomen with his forefinger. He encircled each muscle after another and pressing it firmly a few times.
“James darling, get off the table. Mama needs to prepare food”
Everything that rouses desire in her already lusty state.
He groaned when he felt the familiar tightening of his body and felt the way his whole body grew rigid and his breath rocketing.
“If I touch you now, will you feel rushed?” his fingers slid up to the back of her head, feeling the silky strands and Dracy panted and shook her head adorably.
Harry glared at everything everywhere. His tempter is skyrocketing for some unfathomable reason.
Students didn’t make fun of him. His fellow eight years teased him, questioned them things they cannot even answer. Ginny smirked at him, Seamus surprisingly fist bumped him and Neville offered him a kind smile.
He pulled him in front of the sports booth, “This is a game known as Spear’s Gamble. You get a spear, aim for those dragon balls and if you strike one, you get a reward… or an odorous liquid on your face”
“Good girl”
“Why don’t you go join your brothers and sister?”
He ran his free hand up and down his legs, feeling the way his muscles relaxed under his palms and slowly, his breathing returned to normal.
“Fuck, yes, like that, kitten. Clench around me, push me over the edge. Make me cum, kitten. Make me cum and if you’re good, I might fuck you in our balcony”
“Shut up Ron! And your plan? Harry?” Hermione began using her strict tone, prompting Harry to answer unless he wants to see a catastrophe.
For how many times since last week, he’d seen her play with them not sexually but as if she was uncomfortable of something and once in those times, he’s pretty sure he may have seen something white.
“I got you, little one. You can let go”
“Brandy” the man leaned on the counter, flicking his fingers to the bartender and turning his head to look at him, “Hi”
It was not for all of those. No.
Harry sighed and didn’t speak until they arrive at their department. The Aurors that were there perked up upon his arrival and they stood up.
Draco rutted but found himself unable to do so when Harry pressed himself harder, “Lick”
What. . . is. . . happening?
There's some angst :(
“Actually, to Siri’s nephew”
He smiled at the dazed look on her face as he gathered her juices from the corner of his lips and licking, “You okay, darling?”
Draco sat down and began to take a sip of the coffee that was already on the table. Where did Harry go? Dobby said he was in a hurry? Maybe he got an emergency?
She nodded absentmindedly. Eyes looking all around the building in front of them. St. Mungos. She’s aware of their law on confidentiality but given how her name have been the center of attention and the fact that she’s Dracy, people can be mindless and invade her like they do back when she’s still in that dirty bar working.
"There are actually lot of paintings of the Malfoy family in every walls you can see inside the Manor but Mother had them moved to a one private room when she renovated the interior"
When he woke up this morning, he was on his worst and he was sobbing like a little kid on one of his innocent pillows. He just need Harry’s presence behind him, beside him and those big hands around him. He needs to be reassured or otherwise, he will blame himself for this.
“’Mione said you’re having troubles with your rut. What happened?” Ron raised an eyebrow, “You never talk about your ‘insatiable’ rut to anyone, Harry. This must be some serious problem” he added and did a dramatic quotation over the word insatiable.
She noted the way Harry’s eyes were cold and it was where she based her expectations to. From the gossips she used to hear in the parties she attended years ago, people described Harry as nice but unkind, welcoming but not warm.
He was standing in the other side of the common room talking with Parkinson animatedly and Harry’s forehead knotted in confusion when he realized he’d been staring.
“Such a good girl” he praised. It did not miss his notice when Dracy shivered at his compliment. He smirked.
“Since your birthday is coming up, what would you like? A customized lavender broom or a customized lavender chocolate frogs?” Harry fought the urge to grin like a lunatic although he’s already feeling like a lunatic himself.
“They followed me everywhere. Wouldn’t stop even when I tried to tell them to. My room have always been the safe place for me. The tears I shed in the place, the frustrated and broken emotions it had seen out of me. All those traumatized nightmares that never went out. That’s a personal space I can be who I am. The not so s-strong Alpha everyone make me out to be”
Fuck, he loves his angel too much.
She’s scared. That’s very much acceptable because Harry may be idolized and loved by the public, but he’s an Alpha. A domineering Alpha who wouldn’t give control to anybody else just because he can. An alpha whose personal story haven’t been told since the tragedy that befell the Potter Household.
“I know, Potter. I am gorgeous” he drawled confidently, trying to brush the fact that he has a faint blush on his cheeks.
Draco beamed happily and instantly took hold of the dazzling bouquet. It’s so stunning and they are so creatively arranged. So pleasing and Draco felt so appreciated with the little gift. It may not be much but to receive something from him is such a nice feeling.
“This good?” he asked as he massaged his inner thighs while nibbling on his earlobes.
. Because it's his life and it's what he do.
Oh, fuck. Draco moaned loudly, his breaths coming in and out fast. His nails dug through Harry’s flesh and no doubt leaving marks on its wake.
“Draco?” Pansy spoke but her tone sounded as if she was asking.
Maybe because his smirk is slick-inducing. Which is not something Draco is acknowledging.
“I just don’t understand—
He blinked. What is he supposed to do?! fuck! Why can’t his mind cooperate?!
“How about both and your night as well?”
Not the traditions, the beliefs, the rules that’s holding the Potter name for what is still being followed. Not to constrict himself in these set of rules that would hold him back from being happy. He chuckled and looked beside him where Draco, his baby, is lying and using his arm as a pillow.
Draco look up surprise, “Harry! I didn’t hear you arrive!” he said joyfully and ran up to him. He immediately jumped into his arms.
The bartender leaned at the counter and stared at him and Draco had to leaned back a little so he wouldn’t be overwhelmed with those eyes and that smile and what’s that? A scar?
Harry’s mouth was back on her nipple as the words strike him with lust. She gave Harry’s cock a gentle squeeze all the while purring and whimpering as Harry alternated between her two breasts.
He walked out of the bar and apparated them both to his apartment.
“You seem tired, Senator. You have to loosen up a bit. Maybe a lunch outside will do you good. Some air” he massaged his shoulder, nearly letting out a moan from himself when he felt the muscles on his shoulder blades. It was definitely worked up enough to feel that hard.
He wasn’t one for pet names but that one specifically did nothing but ground him more with acquiescence. His throat burned for his mewls and whimpers and it did not take long until he was bursting with his orgasm.
“Why don’t you break the bonds yourself?” he grinned, biting his bottom lip as he slowly put the head of the dildo in, immediately feeling the stretch and he whimpered.
He tried his best to ignore his daddy’s husky voice because he should learn his lesson. He took hold of the dildo and while trying to build anticipation, he suck on the huge thing, doing his best to wet them as his hands trailed down lower.
He sighed, trying his hardest to drag himself off of his bed. He microwaved some leftovers he had last night and proceeded to watch crappy movies from his small television. The pub never opens until one in the afternoon and he’s having doubts about going on there right now.
She didn’t know what she expected when Wily knocked on her bedroom door and told her Harry wants her. But to feel those hands in her body was not it. His fingers are slightly calloused but gentle on its movements. She watched the hand go higher.
That woke up her completely. Going somewhere? Where are they going to? Are they going to Diagon Alley again? Because if they are, she’d prefer to stay on bed and engulfed his scent on his bed.
She stared at them knowingly but nothing too heavy on the eyes, “All I’ve seen before was the cloud in your eyes, Harry. It’s freeing now that you don’t have them, don’t you think?”
“Harry?” she called him.
Harry had to gripped his spoon and fork tight, his tight grip obvious and he felt himself getting a headache.
She ate the breakfast Harry made for her, slightly sad that he wasn’t here to join him but if it’s an emergency, she prays that everything is alright.
“I’ll leave you two for a while” she winked before shaking hands with Harry and walking off, closing the door behind her.
“I saw from the Daily Prophet you are with him”
“Feelin’ better?” he asked, his eyes sliding up to check for any signs of discomfort. But what he saw definitely was such a sight to behold. His cock hardening at the look of pure bliss on Dracy’s face. Her eyes were closed as she savored his hold and lips parted as she gasps and panted.
The date. The fucking date. It’s the end of the month.
He was so enthralled with Harry, the most amazing of man, the most lovable boyfriend. The man ignited by flames, fires, and burning wood. The man shaped by intentions, rigid muscles, and devious bedroom activities. The man with a glint of the hottest purposes and the man whose touch can melt his worries away.
It sent waves of excitement in her. She bit her lips to hide the grin in her face, “I’m sorry, Mr. Potter but I actually have plans with him”
“Are you ready to do what I asked?”
“Why, mate? Robards offered you a deal for a lifetime. Pretty sure with how ‘famous’ you are, you’ll be Head Auror in no time”
“We do this, you’re mine” he whispered, tone laced with full honesty, “There’s no going back, sweetheart. I wouldn’t let you”
“Hmm” the man hummed before catching his chin and turning it towards him, “Eyes at me, love. The gun won’t harm you” he warned,
"Please call me Harry, Draco" Harry spoke and Draco watched his adams apple bob up and down and he doesn't know why but he finds it as sexy as his body.
“I’m busy” he told him.
Harry regarded him for a minute, making sure he wasn't going anywhere. After a while, he nodded and went outside to begin his warding process.
"My head hurts too much" Draco whimpered and Harry nearly staggered on his feet.
With that said, I wonder whether the boys get the answer they want to know? 🙈
Harry sighed. He stood up from his seat and walked in front of her. Dracy looked up at him expectantly. Whatever it is those eyes are expecting, Harry didn’t try to know it but he needed to ask.
The woman he was talking to noticed him first and pointed at him. He rolled his eyes and propped his chin over his palm. Flirting in the workplace should be strictly banned  even if it’s a bar. It’s damaging to his eyes.
It’s been days. And from the reactions he sees when he kisses her in the neck, forehead, and peck her on her lips, maybe it’s time or not. He can try or once again, not.
“Sit down and eat”
It would be nice if Draco could just stab that eye with a sharp pencil.
“Don’t talk. Fuck, I miss you” Harry mumbled, lifting him into the table and pushing him down.
Cockybee chuckled before waving a hand and gesturing for them to sit down. Star smiled at Harry and well, she’s pretty so he winked at her in return.
What do you think is gonna happen next??? 🙈🤔
"Well, don't you look awful mate"
But how could he listen to his own set of rules when Draco have been so obscene, filthy and gorgeously tasty as he displayed every bit of his glory.
He turned to look at him and shook his head, "Oh no. You're not going anywhere until I finish up the wards and we've spoken about the rules"
He smirked.
She bit her lips, hands clenching on the sides of her gown. She was supposed to be teasing him, supposed to be riling him all the way, sucking him out of his proud exterior and strip him off to reveal who really is behind his restricted facade in the public.
He moaned. Merlin, those filthy words. Those filthy words just turns him on.
He waved a hand respectfully and let Harry pull him to wherever he desires. Occasionally stifling a chuckle when he remembered his reaction. He looked like he was ready to explode and even though he was hit with it as well, he found it ridiculous.
She also had contemplations to enter Harry’s bedroom especially when she notices herself to get needy but just one call of his name, he would come and take her then and there.
“Cum. Fuck, cum on my cock, clench around me, sweetheart” he ordered which she was too happy to do so. He pinched her clit before rubbing them ruthlessly, spurting her to let go.
“Hello"
Draco looked up at him mischievously, he fluttered his eyelashes then his tongue slid down the underside of his cock before mouthing his balls and Harry gripped his head tight to keep himself steady.
“I heard you got an invitation to join the Auror force” she started, “At the same time you got mine”
He looked up and let his eyes roam to take in every contour of his face and with renewed energy, grabbed him by the nape of his neck and clashed his lips to him.
“Fuck, pretty like this. Laid out for me like a good little slut that you are, baby. So beautiful, needy for me” harry whispered, pushing one finger inside and rolling it just fucking right, "Such a good boy"
“Anything for my girl”
“Always so tight, angel” Harry murmured before inserting two fingers at once and scissored him.
Thankfully, McGonagall didn’t press the subject more, “Very well. How are you adjusting to your eight year then?”
James and Lily looked to one another before a smile blossomed on her face, “It’s only fair the contract be sealed by something more binding than a piece of paper, isn’t it?”
“What the hell are you talking about, you bitch? And is it true? JAKE CHEATED?!”
He took in her appearance and was satisfied when she followed her orders. Rightfully and carefully so.
“Pleasure to meet you. I am Harry but you can call me Sir Potter”
The corner of the man’s lips lifted, the shining glint on his coal black eyes had told Harry he picked the right omega for tonight.
“So, what’s going on with you?” Draco asked particularly to no one, “Got any big event or blast some charity I could attend?”
Draco once again ignored him and Harry sighed, “I’ll leave it here” he laid the potion on the floor so Draco would get them when he wants to and he turned to leave, wanting to go to his bedroom and write a letter to Sirius or Remus instead.
“Do you remember what happened back at Yule ball, love?”
She breathed heavily, the scent of her arousal mixed with Harry’s own was making her dizzy as she tried to hold onto the bits of her sanity. She felt like combusting as his tongue did things she thought unimaginable.
Harry took a gulp before starting to speak, “He was drunk last night and begged me and I exploded and fucked him and then I freaked out and now, we’re here” he explained all in one try.
look.
He’ll be late if he’ll wait until she wakes up. He had half a mind to eat alone then go to the Ministry right after but half of his mind wanted to go knock on her door and wake her up. Folding his daily supply of Witch Weekly, he stood up and decided for the latter.
Anything they want him to be.
He closed his eyes, willing himself to relax in his arms.
“Oooh! D-daddy” he made a strangled noise when Harry easily deepthroat him.
“If you considered you ever have one to experience before—OW!”
He didn’t give him any time to adjust as Harry pounded in and out. Thrusting into the hilt, easily finding his nerves that sent tingles and jolts through his spine. His hair was tugged back as Harry grunted, cursing and flexing his muscles as he held Draco to him.
... What?
“Sir, you have a meeting with the DMLE in twenty minutes. Why don’t you go ready?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him, sliding his eyes down to look at his body, “Your tie is askew, your coat is missing, your sleeves are folded to your elbows. Make yourself decent”
“Can you believe Hermione sends me a to-do list?” he broke the silence, cupping his cheek frustratingly, “The future Minister of Magic sends me a to-do list”
Harry smirked, “Can’t promise that, doll” he whispered below his ear before he turned to waved at the bartender over.
Shock and surprised, Draco coughed. He grabbed the glass of water and raised his head to see who it was that suddenly stepped in.
Harry smiled at her and brushed a strand of hair that fell from her face, “I say so, hon”
“Please, Harry. Harder” she whimpered, “Fuck, fuck, fuck yes!”
She simply nodded and was about to close her eyes again when Harry chuckled, “Don’t sleep on me now, baby. We’re going somewhere”
"So, what do yo think of him?" Narcissa asked his son as he turned around and sat down at one of the cushions, his hands grabbing a pillow and putting it to his lap.
“Shall I buy you a mimosa? Or would you prefer—OW!” he grunted when Draco elbowed him again. Draco has got to be the person who have the sharpest elbow among all.
The man eyed them both silently, lingering to Draco the same way they lingered back at the coffee shop and if it weren’t for Harry holding him close, he might’ve excused himself already. That glance looks so terrifying. Just downright horrible. All the things he could hide beneath those stares and the darkening of his gaze was even more scary.
“Wanna have my way with you, baby” Harry whispered, lips ghosting against his ear and Draco whimpered in response.
“What?” he asked.
Okay. None of those words are appropriate. Draco shook his head as he grabbed his heels, “I’ll see you at the office”
He took a heavy sigh and turned the door open. To see her in such a state, am absolute mess but still so beautiful in the eyes caught his breath and he stood there.
Strong with his control. That's thrilling but he knows, even the strongest and the coldest of soldier melts. An ice melts in the sun. And Draco knows he's hot enough to match its power.
Harry told him to scream and he is. His hold tightened and he felt himself convulsing as he began to feel the telltale signs of his upcoming orgasm.
Dracy smiled and nodded, “Now, can I have my cupcakes?"
“Here?” His hand that’s on her waist slid down to her knees, “Is this okay?”
The feel of her pliant body above him, humping on its own accord and the hot breath he can feel in his neck, he would stake anything to see her naked on the bed, eyes rolling at the back of her head, back arching, and legs quivering.
Draco whimpered, curses flying out of his mouth but yelping in  surprise when Harry tugged on his hair.
What puts him off is the reality that this person has taken a liking on him. A simple owner of a simple pub. It sets him off, mainly because Draco was feeding on his own insecurities that he questions every little thing.
Maybe it’s just something Harry wants in life. To be well because if anything, Draco was aware how unwell was the past.
She cried out softly when Harry kissed her, deepening it right away and dominating the kiss. Harry moved his lips and Dracy let him on, his tongue found its way inside her mouth and she moaned.
Her hands began to caress Harry’s biceps as she pondered for whatever for a moment. She didn’t know what’s going to happen after this pregnancy but it’s still months away. What she needs to know is now.
He wore a black ripped jeans that's a little tight to the ass, a fitted plain black shirt, and his chelsea boots. He let his hair messy and sprayed some perfume before going out of his bedroom.
He wants daddy to know he should not make him jealous ever again.
He tilted his head, looking at the sky as they settled down the open field, waiting for the promised meteor shower to rain. He was wrapped up in Harry’s embrace, hands cased between Harry’s to give some heat. He offered his mittens to which he decline, wanting nothing more but Harry’s physical touch.
Alright. That’s a little bit predatory. Red sign number one. Harry took note. His jaw clenched for a bit as they shook hands, noticing the tight grip this cockybee right here had with Draco.
“Let’s go?” he asked and Dracy looked away. Contemplating on how to state what she wants without sounding as if she was shamelessly demanding for something.
And pretty sure, the Greengrass sisters were happy that his proposal was rejected. Those two have been trying to sneak their way in his bed and he’s just waiting for them to step a toe out of line so he’ll drop them thousand dollars and voila, they’re gone.
“Settle down, Harry. It’s just centaur’s piss” he mocked with a smirk.
Merlin. That sounded so good. Draco moaned, his arms winding around Harry’s head, his fingers gripped Harry’s hair and pulled on it. He felt Harry’s cock pressed to his own, his precome wetting his dress.
His cock can hardly wait. He wanted to be sensually touched, be kissed like the most precious, be pounded mercilessly. He wanted Harry to crush him not with his weight but by how excellent he can fuck.
“Oh, darling little one, have you seen yourself dance? I’m charmed” Harry smirked, eyes closing then a goofy smile erupted from his face. Completely different from the serious one he saw a while ago.
When they arrived at the Nott Residence, both of them can already hear the noises roaring from inside and Draco smiled.
“Fine” he responded coolly.
“Fuck,” Harry cursed as he gripped his jaw tight as he began to thrust slowly, “You’re clenching around me so tight, baby. So precious”
Harry breathed calmly before answering, "If that's what you are worried about, I can put strict wards around your Manor, Mr. Malfoy. I can put detection charms and traps for an unknown presence"
Fuck. Draco is nothing but a tease. Harry knew Draco knew he was looking not at the peach color of the floor but the fucking squishy peach in his back.
She bit her lips, taking a step in the same time Harry turned around, confused why he didn’t get an answer. He was about to open his mouth to ask when Dracy wrapped her arms around him, head burying in the crook of his lovely neck and gave a tender kiss at the spot.
He whimpered. Promises, promises.
Harry didn’t return in the Malfoy Manor for the next three days. To which frustrated and angered the other side but it did make Harry feel a bit better. It also gave him the chance to rationalize and he meant, really rationalize.
He growled as he came messily, his cum landing on Sirius’ mouth, his face and some of it on his hair.
What?
Draco whined and pouted, unbuttoning the first three buttons of Harry's sleeve and slipping a hand inside and played with the coarse hair, he leaned down and gave him a kiss in his jaw, to his neck, his tongue going in on circles, and Harry closed his eyes, tightening his arms around him and hummed appreciatively.
“So pretty, doll. Laid out for me like this. Fuck, I can just stuff you up so good. Pleasure you every minute and fuck your mouth”
Dean shook his head, “Only Parkinson and Malfoy. They’re hurdled over the end of Slytherin table. Look” he pointed at a direction and Harry turned to look discreetly.
“I am not groping you!”
Hermione turned to look at him and beamed, “Harry!”
Merlin, bless her with strength. She begins to feel her body give up standing upright at the first touch of her clit.
“Can you get Dr. Hula? I need my blood pressure taken”
Draco rolled his eyes inwardly as he began to hear footsteps approaching.
She knew she’ll love it no matter how much it would be a torture as much as it is going to be pleasure.
He stomped on the cigarette and decided to drive away.
Draco’s breath hitched before it started to get heavy. He can feel his own arousal starting to pool up inside him. He felt his cock throbbed inside him and the way his asshole clenched, trying to hold onto something that isn’t there. . .
“How’s my girl feeling?” he tucked a hair behind her ear as he stood inches away from her. He was looking down at her with a soft smile on his face.
SALUTE!!!
The point? To get things work for their benefit.
His eyes fluttered close as their combined noises filled his room. His back flexed when he pushed in harshly, nails digging at her supple skin.
Madam Pomfrey pinched the bridge of her nose, “The two of you fainted at Potions, Mr. Potter. An accident while brewing what was supposed to be Felix Felicis”
Does that mean all of these are just because of the potion and the pearl dust? Something he’s not in control of because Hogwarts is?
Harry walked towards him and took a sniff, “Firewhiskey"
Sirius bit his bottom lip. Guess he just have to drop it as if he was just asking for cup of coffee, “My cousin’s family”
“You seriously do not have any grace, do you?”
Being friends with Seamus and the others are a thing and being with Draco is another. They do not have the platonic—
Here comes Hermione’s insightful gazes that sometimes just really is borderline intrusive.
, fuck, let me cum” she begged again, body trembling from all the stimulation and let out a surprise mewl when he encircled one arm around her waist and pulled her up.
Draco smiled, tip toeing and pecking him on the lips, “I love you too, fiancée”
The day passed by into a blur. As usual, Harry’s work hours consisted of towers of papers being signed or trashed, countless visits from people of other Ministry departments, some to say something important and some to just blabber whatever nonsense they can invent.
“I don’t need your sex life, Siri”
“What is it?” Remus opened the door with a towel wrapped around his waist and Sirius gulped.
He sincerely smiled at him, “Thank you, daddy” he said and inhaled some of the pleasant smell.
“Harry” she called, hands beginning to wander along his muscled torso, trying to tell him something as she began to feel slick pool on her panties.
“Already so hard for me, kitten.”
“So perfect around me” he dipped down, sliding inch by inch, filling Draco up with his girthy and sheer size.
She nearly dropped to her knees on the dance floor.
“That smells good, omega” Harry sat down and grabbed the spoon and fork. He began to eat the foods already on his plate when he noticed her still standing and watching.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Aww. Come on! Please, doll?”
“Fuck, yes. So good, baby boy. So good”
Harry guided him to stand up after grabbing hold of the handcuffs as well. He gently pushed him to sit at the edge of the bed. He tilted his chin up to look at Harry who smiled softly.
Draco glared, “It’s different, Pans! Look at the slut who’s all over him”
She needs her alpha but he keeps on ignoring her for some unfathomable reason. If only she knows how flying kick works.
When Harry was lubed enough, Draco slid it in and began to ride him with reckless abandon.
His hands slipped down from his cheeks when he had the sudden throb in his chest. It wasn’t anything painful or heavy, it was just there beating erratically.
McGonagall gave Madam Pomfrey a look and she made herself scare, “Boys,” she started, glaring at their childish arguing, “You are no longer the bumbling baboons you were when you were kids! It was not Mr. Potter’s fault nor your fault alone, Mr. Malfoy. It was both of your fault” she emphasized.
"We need to go back to the Malfoy Manor. But don't hesitate to continue the game" Harry glared at the teen named Zayan who is fucking stupid enough to match his stare and smiled at him tauntingly and Harry cannot stop himself from threatening, "Do be careful though or you might find yourself with a cell in Azkaban"
“I just want to know where you went, Draco. What if something happened? I’m guarding you. What will happen if your parents—
Until a few seconds later, a green square hologram with black lines around it floated jut above her tummy.
Draco blinked amused. Yes, he’s gorgeous but to hear it from someone who’s as beautiful as fluffy Japanese pancakes is something more. It’s glorious. Believable and yet, disputable.
“Pa!”
His index finger grazed the tip of her nose to her cupid’s bow and lingering at her lips longer than the previous ones. It was soft and pillowy. It looked as if it was beckoning him to kiss them forever and if Harry had it its way, he knew he will.
He kissed his knuckles before intertwining their fingers together, “It’s okay”
“Hello, Harry Potter”
“They’re beautiful” she complimented.
He fidgeted with his fingers as he let his gaze stare straight ahead. He wasn’t sure if this long wait was necessary but Pansy had told him it’ll take a little bit of time to organize things and find him the one perfect for his preference.
A world doesn’t always mean the whole planet but one man. A charming, loving, and caring man.
He kicked the sofa, “Wake up!”
Oh. He's so fucked. Harry's so fucked. Just one word with two syllables managed to still him and imagine hundred ways to bend the little one with his will. He could ravish him, draw the loveliest of sounds and let everyone including Zayan know who Draco likes to call daddy. Him.
Harry chuckled, his fingers teased down to his lower abdomen and tightening his hold on his throat, "So responsive"
Being the current head of the Department of Mysteries which only increases people’s curiosity. Articles after articles which entails the same title ‘
Harry.
“Oooh” he whimpered, feeling how good they are between his fingertips, “Fuck”
“I’m not, ‘Mione. Can we drop the subject now?” he asked seriously. Not really wanted to hear Hermione’s opinion on the matter of how he should treat Dracy. He’s giving her as much as he could. If only she can open up a bit more.
“Come on, baby, Fuck, come on,
Harry hummed teasingly, meeting his eyes and shrugging, “I’m not sure I like the sound of that” he mocked and it took Draco some time to understand what he really meant.
“So, what do you want to do, daddy?” Draco fluttered his eyes at him and Harry smirked, “You”
“Let’s get you to bath, baby. Do you want that?” He asked once again and Draco didn’t answer.
Warm palm cupped his jaw and before Draco can talk himself out of it, he closed the distance and kissed him. He felt Harry grinned widely before hugging him and taking control of the kiss.
“So, you’re coming with us tomorrow?” he asked once again after a day of not talking about it. They’ve spent this day fucking all around the house as the others had fun in the pub.
"Sorry, baby, daddy needs to finish these papers first"
Harry is an exact fit, the missing one he doesn’t even recognize. A missing puzzle he didn't know he would craved for more.
Harry stood in front of them and observed how they look while Ron stood beside him. Messy, healing bruises, and a little bloody which he had concluded they had already went to St. Mungos to have their wounds healed up.
Draco’s lips tugged coyly while he kept his eyes innocent, “Nothing, Senator. Just having a little bit of fun”
“Harry!” he exclaimed, splaying his thighs wider as Harry inserted another finger and curled them in that spot and he moaned, “Fuck!”
Dinner came and the house elf that introduced himself as Dobby cooked their meals.
, touch me, please. Anything please” he moaned, still trying to move but really cannot do so.
“Well, I haven’t returned the kiss” Harry said, licking his lips, “It’s bad luck if I don’t” he winked.
Draco leaned down and bit on Harry’s neck, “You’re going to regret pulling that stunt ever again”
Oh damn.
"My bedroom, Harry. As my guard, don't you think you should see every corner of the Manor including my bedroom?"
“Good” Harry answered and drank his water.
“More. Touch me, want you to touch me” he tried to order firmly but his voice came out as a breathy moan, barely holding back a sound of plea.
“Yes, sir, please,
Harry knew if this continues, he will surely end up in hell.
He felt it and if the goosebumps that rouse at the back of his neck was any indication, Harry was pissed.
He furrowed his eyebrows together when he heard something that sounded like a pained whimper and he clenched his hands into fists. Taking a step closer, letting some of his Alpha win this.
When Dracy didn’t speak, Harry sighed. He’s nothing but patient.
“It really is. We’re happy, that’s what matters, doesn’t it?”
Draco turned his body slightly to face him, leaning all of his weight on him, “Daddy”
They stared at one another as Harry fucked him through and through. His jaw clenched at the glorious sight as he stick his tongue out, catching his tear and groaning.
Dracy felt so good. She cannot stop moaning as she writhed above Harry, her head sliding down and leaned on Harry’s shoulder.
He clenched his jaw hard. His mind constricting himself to think clearly.
“Then tell me what’s happening”
“I love this song” he murmured behind her as he began to move, guiding her to follow his sway.
“Get on, Potter. I know how horrible you are with Potions. Just hand me the ingredients, will you?” he didn’t snarl but his tone was biting enough.
. Dracy’s eyes widened and a red taint have the bravery to appear on her cheeks. She knew everyone would be having their own conclusions and no sooner than later, she’ll be the protagonist of tabloids again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dracy nodded, taking in what Andy is telling how as she stared. Baby. Their little beanie. She bit her lips. Never would she expect that she will  be here with Harry for that matter. She squeezed Harry’s hand, getting some strength from his large hand when she started to get emotional.
The en suite smelled like Harry already, able to mark the place as his. There's a laundry basket at the corner of the bathroom and he got another urge to go touch the sweatpants Harry wore this morning and pressed his face into it.
Right?
He stood just behind Draco and run his fingertips on the transparent dress he wore, feeling Draco shuddered and moaned, “Don’t you think we should remove this?” Harry whispered.
“What is that?” she asked, index finger pointing at the thing in his hands.
. And for the past two weeks that he’s been caged in that place, he wasn’t. He was bratty, whiny, a sobbing mess. Pleading the man to let him go.
But the question put him off guard. Never once did his private clients asked him of what he want to do.
“I heard Draco decided to come back as well”
“I SAID ENOUGH!”
He was coming! He nearly exploded! Why must he fell from his bed and wake the fuck up?! Really? That was the most delicious wet dream he can ever have in his life and it was cut off?!
“Well, it isn’t my style to announce my arrival to the public” he answered smoothly, “We came for a quick check up and schedule ones for the future”
“Ohh, harry” Dracy felt the quick relief that washed over her body. She loves the way Harry’s warm mouth suck on her as if he was starving and the groans from the back of his throat, obviously enjoying what he is doing.
“Get out!” he bellowed immediately. One bed! This isn’t some fucking one bed trope! No!
She cannot control herself as she let out moans after moans, her hips wanting to grind against his face but his strong grip stopped her.
“Pansy, listen! Someone said love is in the air! You better go get your mask and wear it! Don’t let yourself be infected! They’re dangerous and contagious!”
He needs to bring the House of Potter rules handbook. Read it every goddamn second to remind him that Draco is fucking off limits.
“Harry, please,
“Dressing up like a cock hungry whore. You’re practically begging for me, darlin’. Begging to have my cock shoved inside you, fucking you until you only known my name” Harry snarled, “Ruin you for all others”
Currently, before the day for the Christmas feast comes, they decided to gather around the common room to have some pre-feast fun. Hannah and Neville took some food in the kitchens and Dean and Seamus went to grab some alcohol.
“Daddy, oooh, need you now”
“Yes, yes, fuck, please, sir,
“Is this your first time?” Andy asked, “I have to ask so I could know what to recommend”
He blinked and stopped for a moment. He stood up when there was a knock again and went to open it. Harry nearly slammed the door close when he saw the face of Draco in his night robes.
He shrugged, that doesn’t sound so—
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and shook his head, “It’s for me to handle. Don’t worry yourself about it”
He knows he’s just prolonging the agony but he cannot seem to convince himself to go and talk to Harry. It’s just been last night and the memory is still fresh. He’s afraid the talk might just end up in an argument he’s sure he cannot handle.
“I am not buying you with flowers. I am simply giving you flowers” Harry leaned down and sported his puppy eyes, “Forgive this Alpha”
“Charming” Narcissa supplied for him with a gentle smile, “He’s charming. So charming”
Who does that? Obviously, only Harry Potter.
Draco shook his hands, making sure to squeeze tighter and gave him the look. The look he usually has when he’s seducing someone. But it infuriated him when it seemed to have no effect to the man.
His name?! Yeah, he’s lose it.
Which may have gambled more than they could handle. As the newly appointed Minister of Magic, Valsken Vokbin, have said to them in different occasions,
He sighed and raised his head when he heard a faint knock that came from his door.
He knows why.
“P-please. Please” Draco begged, his eyes closed and panting.
It was just. . . new.
They stare at one another, calculating and unblinking. It felt like that night again as the Great Hall felt constricting and lacks enough air for breathing.
Draco elbowed him but Harry only laughed calmly, “Good night, Draco”
Taking a deep breath and a step, he followed where Draco had gone to. He found him in their bedroom, sitting just at the foot of the bed, head bowed, hands calmly laid at his lap. He looked so lost and it broke his heart to see such view to one of the most amazing human Harry had ever known.
“Harry?” she called, eyes glued to the quilt laying innocently on the couch. It looked rather inviting and drawing her in. The only thing she wanted was to wrap it around herself.
Like she had expected, Leo winced and shook his head as if he was an adult.
He wore mom jeans like an old person.
Now, he might just have created the void for himself.
He needs him. He needs him so much now.
He hugged him back and inhaled Harry’s natural scent. It was manly and comforting. It never fails to remind him that Harry is here now, in his arms.
“I…” Dracy started, trailing off a bit to gather the voice she knew she’s losing when she’s facing Harry.
Harry sighed, nodded and offered the two of them a small decent smile, "Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, I am Head Auror and I am taking care of much more important things. I cannot just abandon my work to guard your son"
“The service here always sucks” he had a nice timbre. His voice wasn’t cold or husky like Draco had expected. There was this controlled tone in them, almost as if masked by kindness as not to give away.
Dracy smiled at her before accepting the small box of gift from here, “Little beanie’s doing good”
Harry chuckled before crashing their lips together, “I promise you, baby, one day we’ll have the answers we want”
Fuck.
Draco showed him the middle finger and straightened up. He took a deep breath to prepare himself for the inevitable physical contact for Harry to prove their
He’s dealing with the cases he didn’t assign to Ron. The dinner an hour ago went fine. They were silent and Harry didn’t bother to break it.
Tom Riddle was handsome. Clean cut hair, nice stance, may not be as muscly as Harry but elegant. Poised. Elite. Those are what Draco sees. No one would really expect this man is anything but good.
That’s what Dracy had noticed for the few days that passed since Harry learned that she’s pregnant. She’s sure that if this goes longer, she may end up on the streets. Worse than she used to be.
His mouth water at the sight of it before he tentatively lick a stripe up from the balls to the mushroom head, “There’s only one lesson for you, daddy” he murmured.
He flinched when he felt Harry intertwined his fingers with his and winked at him before pulling him towards the coffee shop Tom walked in.
“Hmm” Draco hummed, intertwining his hand around Harry hands and closing his eyes, “Thank you, daddy”
He looked around the living room and walked over to the kitchen to find her fixing up plates on the dining table. She looked at him when she notices his presence and she smiled, “Harry”
His fingers slid up to Draco’s arms, feeling the soft skin. He can feel his cock reacting to what he is doing and the way Draco tensed up and noticed the way his head tilted to the side where it nearly rested on Harry’s hand on the wall.
Dracy smiled at her. She was able to warmed up with her, one of the not too many people who’s able to show kindness even when she obviously know what happened to her family and kept her word that no one will know of her pregnancy. Though  pretty sure from their trips to Diagon Alley, people already know about her condition.
She looked to the side and weighed her thoughts. Public. It’s true. It’s the public. Diagon Alley. Basically a place where people wander, where all kinds of gossips go around and everyone would literally see them.
Those people didn’t see the man Harry knows, the person he saw beneath the thousand pain, the husband that showed more kindness than them. Those people can’t see the Draco that he is.
He was about to smack him on his head when Harry caught his wrist and kissed the back of his hand.
He didn’t answer but came out a breathy whisper of nonsense. Harry’s tone have gone husky and low, almost threatening but also seducing.
But because he's in Harry's bedroom at the moment. Inspecting his things and whatever he can know and learn about him.
He didn’t constrict him for long, didn’t edge him ruthlessly. Harry touched him with care whenever this ‘casual fuck’ comes into place. The man blew him, took him deep in his throat and never did he demanded for the favor to be returned. He was in a way in awe for the first time Harry gave him a smile while he was fingering him in the tub.
He had set the plan and was excited for it.
“You look exceptionally well-rested, Harry” she blinked, “Draco too”
. Something that looked like it was made by an angry child.
“Okay. That’s handsome” Pansy mumbled, eyes focused on the stairs and when Draco turned to inspect, his jaw dropped to the ground.
Harry needs to go out. He needs to go out. Maybe drive to nowhere or something. He’s suffocating inside the Malfoy Manor and he needs some room to breathe.
She leaned her forehead against him in defeat, “Please”
"How do you plan to get him then? I can see how strong he is with his control" she stated and leaned in the back of the chair, crossing her arms in the process.
“Mmm, yes” Dracy tried to smile up at him but was obviously too tired to do so.
It didn’t take long before she opened her eyes and immediately widened upon seeing him. She frantically stood up, blankets tossed out. Harry noticed what she was wearing and he didn’t know what is but there’s something inside his chest that felt squished, as if it was crushing him into something more than who he is now. Fuck.
When he heard a groan, he ignored it. Not wanting to talk with the reason why he’s in the hospital wing right now.
harry” she whimpered loudly, “Please”
Dracy moaned at the sight. He’s fucking huge and her head fell back. His image ingrained in her mind. The bulbous head, the veins around the side of his dick, the leaky slit and his heavy balls.
But right now, he doesn’t need to because he has one to provide his needs. He stretched out to relieve his back muscles and leaned at his chair after. Normally, he can easily control his sexual depravity—well, not depravity because it’s not. He can easily pick up omegas but he usually opts not to act on his Alpha’s urges but other times, he does.
“I love you, you know that right? I only want to protect you, baby” he murmured.
Andy giggled at their sweetness and winked at Dracy when she blushed scarlet, “Baby’s looking good as always. Keep this up so we’ll welcome your little beanie with the happiest smiles!”
But for Draco, he wasn’t. He was so much more. He was much more than what he let other people see. He was so much more than being the Head Auror, his partner, much more than the powerful man. He was much more than what his wand describes him to be, much more than those rigorous training he has to make his muscles much more reliable.
“You okay, baby?” Harry asked as he pulled out, his thumb wiping the edge of his lips.
He resumed his previous pace, palms gliding at her back to the dip in her spine down to cup her ass. Massaging them before landing a spank that has her moaning loudly. The pain mixing with her pleasure spurred her on even more.
“Don’t worry, baby. Okay?” he hummed before giving her a feathery kiss before hiking her dress back up and surely enough, his cock hardened at the sight of her damp bra. There’s was a wet patch on them and it’s the loveliest sight he had ever seen.
Silvery eyes stared at emerald ones. Intense, seductive and equally calling in. With no ounce of signs of who’s going to look away or who’s going to give up.
Confused and hungry at the same time, she turned her head to look and her heart melt at the sight of Harry leaning his cheek on her pelvis and occasionally kisses her tummy, his hands rubbing the side of her legs.
Harry shrugged easily. Ron and Hermione cannot stop asking him about Dracy and whether he thought about what she said about giving the omega a home. Truthfully he didn’t but in order to shut her up, he told her that he’s thinking about it.
“It’s one of my safe houses. Wily makes sure it’s clean and complete with supplies” Harry responded, following behind her.
Harry felt Draco come up beside him and he hastily closed the folders. "These are not for the public, Draco. These are confidential" he informed and Draco hummed in response and sat down in front of him, holding a cup of hot tea.
Harry is eating her out. The first man that ever did and she gushed out by the thought. Her hand that’s wounded around his head tightened, pushing him even more to her pussy. He growled at her action, increasing the pressure of his tongue as he began to play with her wetness. Smearing it all over her pussy before he entered her.
Harry is busy jogging around the Malfoy grounds shirtless as Draco stood at his veranda, secretly watching.
His shoulders rested into the bed while his ass was propped into the air. Harry’s left hand held his wrists behind while the other spanks him. The bed frame shook in time of Harry’s thrusts, creaking with noises as Draco’s eyes stung with tears, loving the slaps Harry was delivering into his ass, soothing them right after.
Harry pulled him into the counter to order. He made sure he is standing beside him and it did not escape his notice that Harry was kind of trying to cover him in Tom’s view. Although, Tom did not look at them, they knew he was aware of their presence.
He might agree with Seamus who proclaimed before they started the group study session he’ll blow the books up if he cannot load some information in his brain.
He gathered enough saliva and spat. Harry smirked before pumping his cock with it. He leaned Draco’s back on the car and slowly pushed inside.
He’s not handsome. He’s extremely beautiful. Emerald eyes, really
His mind raced to plans he can do to snoop around the place. He was sure there can be files hidden inside his penthouse office, ones that could be useful to his father to defeat him next election. Things that can uncover that the Harry Potter the citizens know is not really the Harry Potter inside.
Draco nodded, leaning into the touch, “I do. I do, Harry”
She perked up at the sound of that. Finishing to chew the food that’s on her mouth before she shifted all of her focus to his, “Can I come?”
Whoever made him the Head of Department of fucking Mysteries made the wrong decision. He cannot even get the omega who actually caught his interest, how can they expect him to handle a whole department?
“I don’t” Harry whispered. He stepped closer, easily crowding Draco to the wall, “I don’t regret it, little boy”
Remus smirked, summoning his wand from the bedside table, he pointed it at Sirius. He transfigured the shirt into a dress, surprising Sirius as the shirt transformed into a slutty black dress. Neckline so low, so short it cannot even fully cover his buttocks.
He inhaled sharply, gasping and panting at the same time Harry let outs noises of relaxation to help him. His soul felt like leaving his body. Merlin, he never realized this kind of softness is what he needs for their mornings. Not the roughness of the night or the intense poundings of Harry’s hips.
“You see, love darling, I fantasize bending you over that bed, let you make a mess on it as I make a mess on you” he whispered hotly, pecking kisses then and there at everywhere his lips could reach, “Just have my way with you and fuck you senseless”
Harry pulled him up after meal, brushing some strands of blonde hair away from his forehead, “Wanna go back to the common room and cuddle?”
She turned around, throwing her arms around Harry and sobbing. Fuck these hormones but fuck Harry more.
She took the snack and was about to eat it when upon taking a whiff of its smell, her stomach churned and she made a beeline towards the bathroom. Her stomach barrelled as she emptied her tummy, the energy it took her to vomit tire her out and she whined at the headache seeping in.
In a surprising spurt of renewed annoyance, Draco smacked the hell out of him because damn him for making him do this, “Wake up, you cocksucker!”
Lucius chuckled and nodded, "Yes. I do recall that vividly, Cissa. He was pouting and whining he woke up"
“This place is huge”
But as he have experienced how sweet Harry is, he found himself holding back, craving what he shouldn’t.
“yes, daddy” he murmured and his thighs trembling as he began to push in and out, one of his hands played with his nipples, stimulating him even more. Feeling how wet his panties are and the way his cock throbbed desperately.
There was shuffles of feet before Harry reappeared, “Dracy”
Harry sighed. There’s just one thing Ron doesn’t understand here. Mating and marking is a huge commitment and it wasn’t Harry’s purpose to when he got her out of that bar. His intentions were good and it maybe isn’t pure in some aspects but he believes that claiming should be consented in both sides.
Dracy gently laid the picture beside her and reached out. Merlin. This wasn’t supposed to be their morning. The morning that should happen is them angry from last night’s mess.
She smiled at Harry and the look of tenderness in his eyes before turning back to her father, “Where do you live?”
He would kiss her before he leaves and kiss her again when he arrives and sometimes, with a flower in hand. Her chores have been lessened but she still insisted to cook food for him.
“We can. I’m just a little worried” she admitted, nuzzling her cheek further for comfort. Can they just go to bed? She wants lie on the bed with Harry.
Dracy, who began to eye him with those expressions Harry refused to acknowledge, nodded breathlessly.
That sounded so good. Dracy’s heart fluttered as she looked up and smiled back dreamily. Her cheeks flushed as she leaned her cheek on Harry’s hand, “How was it?” she asked.
Parvati laughed, “No problem, Sir”
Harry yanked his jeans open and slid his hand inside, smirking when he felt the material of his panties, “I bet you look so good, baby. Wish I could see you just in it”
“I noticed he had a pretty tight security but I was able to delete the footage before he finished showering”
Draco had watched him gracefully flick his hands while calmly reciting incantations and it was something he had never seen in other Aurors. Harry is a Head Auror for a reason, he can see and feel that very well.
It is a chivalrous Harry Potter.
Things are going smooth, yes. His classmates have been friendly to each other. He also observed the way Hannah, Susan and Parvati is slowly warming up to Parkinson and vice-versa. But Malfoy still distances himself well enough, only speaking to Parkinson.
No. That sounded too serious.
“Alright but first, alcohol” Sirius winked and pulled two small bottles of firewhiskey in his pocket. He took his wand out and returned the bottles into its regular size and handed one to him. They both sat down at the ground and watched the whole view in front of them.
“Arms up” he raised his arms, watching as Harry locked his wrists on the headboard, “Good boy”
, Harry, please, fuck” he cussed as Harry gripped his cock in his palm, rough hand tugging at his erection, thumb swiping at the slit to messily scatter his precum.
“Sit, sit”
They both panted for seconds before Harry was pulling away, helping him to his feet and taking into his account in fixing and cleaning him up.
Hello! Thank you for everyone who wished me well on my exams! :)
“I can tell but in a good way or bad way?”
For the next three days, Draco and Harry busied themselves on their own work to do. Having a silent arrangement to cooperate to get somewhere, even just a little pinch of a useful evidence to throw the man in jail.
“We’re at an acquaintance’s restaurant, Jean Jacques”
He is a venom tackled into a man. He is a snake within a person. He is an animal within a human’s skin. He can vow but he can break. He can give but he can take. He collects debts with no interest but intentions. He makes no compromises as he decides.
Andy chuckled softly, “Yes, your little beanie”
He gasped when Harry pulled his fingers out, saliva following his fingers, “Fuck. Please, Harry. I want you, please, please, love. Want you in me, daddy. Please”
Harry’s eyes shone as a smirk found its way in his face. His fingers brushed a strand of hair in Draco’s face before leaning down and pecking a kiss on his lips.
“Harry!” he moaned when a third finger found its way in, scissoring them just right as a middle finger prodded at his sensitive nerves, shooting tingles up his spine and going to his cock. He whimpered and sobbed as tears gathers at the corner of his eyes.
Dracy shook her head and looked up to her father. He has the hopeful expression on his face even if his eyes were as lifeless as they could be. For a fraction, she felt bad. Because she knows, no matter what happened, she has his blood running through her veins and he is her father. She felt bad at the way she’s living such a good life while Lucius was living the consequences of his actions. Something which he obviously deserves but she wouldn’t dare wish for it.
"Mr. Potter, we need you to guard our son" Mr. Malfoy repeated his statement his tone unwavering as he look at him straight in the eye but Harry didn't falter and stared right back.
“Motherfucking assholes!” Draco shouted as he thrashed on chair he’s handcuffed on.
She tried to approach him one night, asked him if everything is alright between them and only to be cut of from an emergency owl from work. She’s doesn’t even know who’s the real Harry anymore. This cold Harry or the warm Harry.
Andy chuckled, “Any mood swings? Or pain in any part of the body?”
And who wouldn't be shocked? If you look at Harry, he looks like he wouldn't bother himself accepting jobs that aren't in his list. He looks like him being a Head Auror is reserved for things that are much more important, given how skillful Harry must be in casting offensive and defensive spells.
Harry laughed and shook his head with his antics, “Merry Christmas, Seamus” he said.
Dracy smiled, handing their little James back to Andy so she could properly check on him. With the last ounce of energy from her, cupped Harry’s cheeks and teared,
Nothing. Just nothing. They are not going anywhere in the operation but Draco surely is going somewhere with his hate for his superior.
“One of my Slytherin friends, Zayan”
Harry responded instantly. Understanding what Draco needed. His strong arms hugged him by his waist and pulled his body flushed to his. He groaned at the way their body seemed to fit one another, a complement of something, an equal of the opposite side.
Dazing. Mesmerizing.
Harry chuckled merrily, “Good sales talk. Here’s 350 galleons. He’s more than worth it”
“Seven days is enough”
“I’m not forcing you now. Go back when you’re ready” Remus added and Harry nodded once again.
The silence that followed was nothing of appreciation or understanding. His friends looked at him as if he was way out of his mind. Disbelief written on their faces as they waited for Draco to drop the bomb and tell them he was only joking.
No one could resist him. He snorted as he tried to stand up, only to be pinned down by a hand holding him by the waist. He turned his head to the side and saw Harry still sleeping. His expressions peaceful. He looks so serene, back to the polite expression he wore whenever he’s out and gone the harsh attitude he showed probably hours ago.
“Harry’s not here”
Harry removed his robes and left his self shirtless before joining the boy into the bed, he rested a hand beside Draco’s head, carrying his weight while the other touched him by the legs, slowly trailing upwards to his milky thighs to his hips, to his small waist.
Harry did not waste any more time as he held himself up with one hand while the other guided himself inside her. Once he was fully in, his hand went to hold her gently on the hip before trying to move in and out slowly to give her time to adjust and making sure they weren’t harming the life inside her.
"And very fresh, don't you think?"
The fuck did the table do? Turned around? Change its position? The hell?
“Prongs, it’s normal—
“If you want it as much as I do, say yes. If you don’t, walk away, tiger. Your call” he added, allowing her a moment to ponder on her choices because they both knew if she gives the signal, it would no longer be her in charge.
“Do you want these pair, Ma’am? They’re limited edition and I’m sure will fit you” the staff spoke and Dracy perked up. Not really wanting for anyone to notice where she was looking. She blushed even more when Harry looked at her then at the heels she’s staring at.
Once again, who could blame them? Draco can’t.
“Yes?”
When he went downstairs, he didn’t even look at Dobby when he spoke and didn’t answer when he asked if he wants anything specific for breakfast. He just took his wand and apparated away straight to Pansy’s house announced.
Sirius felt like coming but wouldn’t unless Remus tells him to. His balls tightening as his cock quivered, wanting attention, any attention but he held back, not bothering to touch himself because his husband is more than enough. His moans turned into whimpers into tears as his mouth parted into an O-shape.
“I got this. Take a rest, sweetheart”
Her eyes widened when she remembered something.
Seduction is its own dance, own rhythm, own tune, own lyrics and own song. It’s never accompanied by guitars, flutes, and drums. It is, in a way, a game that involves bodies, stirring temptation and building lust.
Kicking his shoes off, his eyes traveled to her enticing neck to her bare breasts. Her nipples were hard and his mouth watered at the view, “So gorgeous”
Harry bent down, one hand settled beside Draco’s head to hold his weight while the other held him by the hips as he pounded, hard but not too fast. He wanted to be slow but loving. Just wanted to erase Draco’s doubts and show him how amazing he is.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he could say anything, Luna stared at him, “The blibbering humdingers’ pestering you again, are they?”
He decided to take a bath, not even properly taking his time as he dressed in muggle leggings and an oversized shirt.
“Hmm” Draco hummed, “Sleepy”
“That, sweetling, is the new mission assigned to us by Kingsley. Take a look, princess”
It didn’t take long for his newly uploaded blog be flooded with reactions and comments and decided to read some of them.
“You’re beautiful” he complimented completely out of the blue. He was not really conscious of what came out of his mouth as he continued to stare that’s beginning to be borderline creepy.
"Draco malfoy? My nephew?" Sirius butted in while his hands are wrapped around Remus' torso.
“Call Dracy here”
“What is it—
“Is it really time to clarify that now?” he whispered, hands wandering all over Draco’s body before it nestled on his ass, both cheeks under each of his palms and lifting him up easily.
“I saw you in Daily Prophet and I knew I j-just have to s-see you. Tell you how sorry I am for the things I have done”
Lucius smiled at her, always fond at the way his wife never fails to comfort him. She never failed to see the reluctance behind his cold steely gaze. How fun would it be if they can cancel today’s appointment so he could just bend her over the bed like she deserves, take her apart piece by piece.
Draco found himself tensing when the hand slid down, palm gliding over the material of his dress smoothly and resting it below his spine. He fought a shiver and suppressed the action of swearing out loud.
“Poor thing” he shook his head and bent down until their faces are hovering to one another. Harry’s fingers wound up at the back of her head, gripping her blonde hair but not too hurt but just to touch, feeling the silky strands between his fingertips.
Draco smirked, “No. I hope you learned your lesson not to make me jealous daddy”
He whimpered from where he is standing. Fuck, how does Remus manages to look so innocent but so hot? So hot. All Sirius ever want to do is to fuck himself on his monster cock to oblivion, drive into the hilt, hit his bundle of nerves over and over again, make him see his own constellation with the brightest vision even in closed eyes.
Looking at it now, it maybe wasn’t so bad. She had freedom, some of it. She has the space to speak and the time to do what she wants, all the while not worrying how to pay the monthly rent, how to supply her own food, how to be out of the public’s eyes.
She nearly let out a keening noise. Nearly gave all of herself away. This was far too intimate for the public dance floor. Too many eyes, too many onlookers. But fuck, she didn’t care anymore.
He smiled seductively, swaying his hips as he tossed the sleeves to the floor, “Daddy will learn his lesson not to make me jealous”
“Grab a cushion, lay it on the floor and kneel on it. I’ll be with you in a moment, kitten”
She looked at him straight in the eyes and felt her emotions bubbling inside her for all the actions and attention he is giving her. He’s just so tender, so good, so nice, and so sweet. How is this the man the public has branded as someone good but not kind?
Draco cannot properly see his looks but he is sure how hot he can be as evidence by the gazes he’s throwing over his place at the stage, taking in his steps unblinking and unfaltering. It roused a suspicious desire in his abdomen when he noticed a movement in his rigid jaw.
He thanked himself when he didn’t forget about it the next morning. He had it in his memory bit by bit and can reminisce it in every detail.
He stomped his feet on the pavement and weighed in enough questions to what’s happening in front of him. He clearly doesn’t know why his daddy is doing this and even if he does, he doesn’t like it.
