Harry watches him incessantly. He can’t seem to stop, really. He knows that technically he’s been living with Malfoy for the last six years. But now that Harry shares a room with him, sees him fresh from the shower, and reading in bed, and working in the garden, and just
“Fuck.” Harry rolls onto his back and stares at the ceiling for a long while. Slowly, the scent of coffee filters under the door.
“You cared what I thought of you?”
incredible, and I’m not just saying that to make you feel better, or whatever rot you’ve convinced yourself of.”
“I--” Harry looks at Draco, cannot look away. “I don’t know how.”
about other things - so much so that I’m starting to think it’s not a conscious omission so much as it is a subconscious denial. So, I ask again, do you still feel that way about me? Do you want more with me than a fuck? Because, to return to your earlier sentiment, it’s impossible for me to be doing well without you as I never had you in the first!”
“Have you just come to mock me, then? Rub it in my face how well you’re doing without me?” Harry doesn’t have to look to know that Draco’s eyebrows are competing for space with his hairline. The snappish reply Harry expected doesn’t come. The silence leaves him exposed, childish, painfully aware that he is coming apart at the seams.
Draco finds him sitting at the edge of the pool.
Worst of all, Draco is fine. There hasn’t been a break in his voracious appetite for literature. He still journals the day away, content in his pocket of sunlight. He jokes with Luna and Ginny, his grin toothy, unselfconscious. He challenges Hermione on their Ancient Runes summer work, brow furrowed as he tucks his hair behind his ear. One remarkable moment, Harry watches from the couch as Draco and Ron went toe-to-toe in a four hour chess match which ended in a tie.
“I think you’re beautiful,” Draco continues. “To be perfectly blunt, I think you’re hot as hell. I think you look gorgeous when you’re aroused, and breath-taking when we have sex. I think your body looks
“You shouldn’t want to marry me.” This isn’t what Draco intends to say, but once the words have escaped him he can’t seem to stop. “I’m not-- Harry, I’m not good enough for you. Not by a hilariously long shot. You-- You aren’t going to be happy with me forever. You’ll come to your senses one morning and you’ll realize who you’re married to and then you’ll hate me, and--”
“You have to say it,” Draco says. He looks into his coffee like it might offer some clarity, some way out of this mess they’ve built around them; this grave Harry’s dug them into. “You’ll have to say you want me - want me for real. I-- I can’t be your dirty little secret. I won’t be that.”
The sugar cookie, when it comes, is warm, and small, and perfect in his hands.
Harry nods, closing his mouth and the ring box with a soft click. He places the ring box on their coffee table, then stands slowly and slips into their bedroom, closing the door with the soft groan of the hinges.
this chapter is a little short, but combining it with the next chapter made them too long. please bear with me, this is my first time splitting works into chapters! i hope you're enjoying the story so far!
“You’re right!” The words explode out of him like a cry of victory, like he’s relieved to finally have the words in the open. “This story has
Sirius rouses at the noise, his bright eyes curious and looking for Harry. But then his eyes land on Draco. He woofs softly, clambers to his feet with a deep stretch before hopping onto the couch. Draco falls asleep there, fingers clutched in Sirius’s fur.
“I’m not lying to you, Harry.”
Ron looks up from his move. “Wha’?”
Harry loses the game soon after, shame sugary and gritty on his tongue.
been about me! I’m just a prop for you to explore your sexuality with until you move onto somebody worthy of sharing your mind and heart with. You think I haven’t played this part before? I know all my lines, Potter! You’re the one that seems confused!” Draco takes a stuttered breath, clenches his teeth. “So now that we’ve established that this
“He speaks.” Then, “Yes, my hair is curly. Your eyes are green.”
He maps the line of scars from his face, down his neck, across his torso, bisecting the line of his hips, down each thigh and to each foot. He watches their color change - pale and thin on Malfoy’s face, thick and flushed pink on his torso and thighs, thinner on his calves, nearly negligible on the base of his feet. Idly, Harry counts ten fingers, ten toes.
He comes back to the present when Malfoy slips the bowl of batter into the ice box and holds a batter-covered spoon out to him. When Harry doesn’t respond, he twitches his eyebrow and shakes the spoon a bit.
“Of course I did. I still do.” Draco slides his bare feet into the water with a sigh. “I had the largest crush on you, though I couldn’t admit that to myself until…” He scrunches up his face, counting back the years. Harry wants to kiss his nose. “Fourth year? Maybe? By then Snape was grooming me, though. My path was set, the same as yours. I suppose every story needs a villain; or at least an antihero. I don’t suppose I matter enough in the grand scheme of things to have been your villain.”
The minutes pass, sticky and stubborn. Malfoy traces the grain of the table with his fingertip for a few of them, then rises to clean the dishes by hand. Harry watches, struck again by the absurdity of Draco Malfoy doing anything so domestic or plebeian as washing dishes. But there Malfoy is, clearing off measuring cups and the spoon they shared with sure stokes of a soapy sponge.
“While I appreciate your confidence that I can make up falsehoods whilst balls deep, I’m afraid you’re mistaken.” Draco huffs a little laugh and rolls onto his side.
Harry is reminded, suddenly, that Draco has never done this before. He’s never had a serious relationship to compare this to, has never faced a major disagreement and worked through it with a partner. Harry has known from the beginning that Draco’s response to most things is to leave before he can be chased away; that he feels no roots are better than torn ones. Hell, Harry has held the door open for him every step of the way, made clear that they didn't have to buy a house, or adopt two kittens and a puppy, or do
“Thanks.” If Harry expected some grand gesture, some sign that Malfoy heard the double meaning behind his thanks, he doesn’t get it. All he gets is an absent, breathy,
The next day, Harry means to tell Ron that Malfoy is a fag. He wants to float the piece of news over their game of chess, retell the story to make Malfoy into a caricature of himself, share a laugh at his expense. But the words won’t come up. Each time he tries to say it, a sliver of memory crops up, stops him dead in his tracks. The flush of Malfoy’s scars; the pale flutter of his eyelashes; the thrill of his laughter; the hollow of his cheek; the way he’d made no secret of his sexuality. There was no joke to be had when Malfoy said it, although there was an accusation:
Harry watches Malfoy make the cookie dough from scratch in a sort of stunned silence. In all the sweltering weeks they’ve been cooped up in Grimmauld Place, waiting for the world to stop it’s reeling, never has Harry seen Malfoy cook. But here he is, measuring out ingredients with a sure hand. His hair is lost in the type of twirly turban Harry’s seen Ginny make, though Malfoy is using one of Molly’s tea towels instead of a proper body towel. It’s a funny sight, though funny in a way that makes Harry’s heart achy and quiet.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Draco. Tell me what you want me to say.”
“Malfoy-- I-- I didn’t-- I’m--”
“‘M tipsy, give me some credit.” He smiles but his eyes are focused, and soon enough that smile melts into earnest concentration. “But I’m serious.”
Draco’s voice is unbearably soft. Harry closes his eyes against the tears attempting to rain down his face. Apparently, it’s Say Things That Make Harry Want to Sob Hour in the Potter-Malfoy household.
At Draco confused look, Harry’s ears burn. He’s in to deep to drop the conversation. If he’s learned anything in the time they’ve been together, it’s that Draco believes in Communication with a capital C.
Draco’s thumb strokes gentle tracks on the skin, disturbing some of the hair on Harry’s stomach. His eyes are warm but sober as he waits. Slowly, Harry’s body relaxes, inch by semi-humiliating inch, until his stomach is back at its fullest. Harry desperately wishes there were somewhere else to look as Draco takes up sweeping his fingertips in soothing, tingly circles around Harry’s belly button.
“Okay,” Drago agrees. “Can we cuddle?”
) and wrap himself around Draco, bury his face in the sleep-warm skin of Draco’s throat and feel him hum to the French radio station. But the space between them feels massive this morning, completely uncrossable. If the tension in his spine is any indication, Draco feels it too.
. Three letters.
All night, Draco has sat at this table, reheating the same cup of coffee, waiting patiently as Harry hid - first behind his cloak, then behind his silence. Draco has waited through more - years of antagonism, months of fuckin under the cover of darkness.
They sit across from one another in silence, Draco looking studiously at his food while Harry looks right at Draco.
“No buts,” Harry interrupts, squeezing the hands beneath his gently. Beneath the table, SIrius whines for scraps, sensing an opportunity for more human food now that the tension between his parents has passed.  Harry rolls his eyes and feeds the mutt a slice of sausage from his plate. Draco is fighting a smile, which Harry supposes makes it worth it.
“Harry,” Draco cuts in weakly. “You hated being married. Ginevra was perfect for you--”
Harry is helpless as he’s drawn closer to the pool and takes a seat at the outer edge of the pool’s stone border. He watches as Malfoy drops to the bottom of the pool, then comes flying up to the surface at the last moment, taking in lungfuls of cool night air and looking toward the moon. He watches each death-defying stunt with awe, even a little jealousy. Malfoy, for all his reserve and silence around the house, seems free, here, in the water under the moon.
“Marry me.”
Harry opens his eyes, blinking rapidly when a tear lips down his cheek and past his ear. Draco’s smile is warm and sober and soft and Harry frankly wants to drown in it.
to say yes. But his mind is a bit distracted by the fact that Harry Potter has just casually asked for his hand in bloody matrimony whilst three drinks deep on an otherwise random night.
Harry snaps awake, the rustle of fabric and groaning of floorboards pushing him into full alertness. Ron’s kerosene lamp, one of many mementos from their time on the run, burns low, casting long shadows and just enough light to see by. Across the room, Malfoy is rising from his bed roll near the door. Before he finishes slipping on his shirt, Harry catches sight of the scarred mess that is his torso. The thick, pink lines are darker than Harry ever imagined they’d be - darker, certainly, than the ones that cross his face and hands. He can’t stop the sharp inhale he takes. Malfoy freezes for just a moment and his eyes scan the room. But his gaze passes right over Harry, the sound shaken off with another small squeak from the floorboards.
“And it’s all about what you want, isn’t it? I’m not a prize to be won, Malfoy.”
When Harry can only gape at him like a fish, he huffs again, making an impatient gesture with his hand.
Ultimately, his eyes are drawn to Malfoy’s prick, laying soft and harmless on his belly. A familiar shame wells in Harry’s throat. He shouldn’t be looking at another man’s cock like this. Still, he can’t look away. His eyes flick helplessly to Malfoy’s face, note that his eyes are still closed, his face still slack with relaxation. After a moment to confirm that Malfoy is none the wiser, Harry lets his eyes return to Malfoy’s prick.
“I was supposed to be in Slytherin.” Malfoy is brought to a gratifying halt. “The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin but I begged for Gryffindor. I didn’t want to be in the same House as you.”
Draco swallows, looking dubiously between Harry and the ring. Then he extends his left hand slowly, palm down. “For the next thirty years, minimum, otherwise known as the foreseeable future.” he pauses, meets Harry’s eye. “Yes. I will marry you.”
?!” But he’s laughing, dabbing away his tears with such genteel motions that Harry can’t help his own laughter.
“So then what are you going to do about it?”
Draco is the first to find his composure, wiping tears away from his eyes. He shifts slightly, steps into a beam of sunshine slipping into their attic bedroom. Feeling the sun on his face, Draco closes his eyes, opens his palms and spreads his arms out like he’s feeling a personal rush of wind. His face is a palette of gold and cream, fine eyelashes clumped together, pink lips opened in a pleased sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, and
“We have plenty of time,” he said. “D’you wanna come over later tonight, after your friends leave?”
The entrance was guarded by a portrait of an enormous woman in a horrible, gaudy dress of whom Draco had heard tell but never actually seen.
Harry shook his head. His expression was difficult to read, brow creased like he was thinking hard while he studied Draco’s face. “I thought
good," Draco seethes, spinning to find the small ornate bowl on the mantel where he knows they keep their Floo powder. "God, you're engaged to a fucking —"
— it was just that he hadn’t expected it to go so
"No," Harry countered, stepping closer still. Malfoy, watching him warily, seemed to hold his breath. "We're talking about what happened."
He knocks lightly, trying to compose himself. He's known Daphne for a long time and he's more or less confident in his ability to pass for her, especially if Potter doesn't know her beyond the bedroom. Potter looks confused when he opens the door, and although it doesn't entirely disappear when he sees who it is something visibly softens.
"Obviously I didn't expect this to happen."
“I’m not hitting you, Malfoy,” Harry said softly, reaching for his Moonraker and giving Malfoy a long, searching look. He’d always hated it when Cho had cried. That was something he’d always loved so much about Ginny, that she
“Malfoy?” she said quizzically, stopping in her tracks and coming over to him. “Harry’s been … when did you get back?”
Harry smiles.
, do you know that?”
“Hermione,” he started, fingers tapping anxiously at the surface of the wooden table which was supporting Hermione’s mountain of books. She must have heard something in his voice because she looked up from her notes with a creased brow.
Up in his bedroom, Draco throws on one of Harry’s Weasley jumpers with a big ‘H’ on it that he’d stolen several weeks ago, which Harry has never protested. Draco wearing his jumper and nothing else is decidedly all right with him. He himself merely pulls off his jeans before climbing into bed with Draco and his ridiculously endearing Snitch-covered sheets. He pulls him in for a kiss immediately that keeps a slow pace like before. His toes curl and his cock twitches in interest as he feels the texture of Draco’s chapped lip and reminds himself what the back of his teeth taste like. Draco slips a hand beneath his hoodie and plays with the trail of hair he finds above Harry’s boxers.
Ron couldn’t be there — that was Harry’s one condition with himself. As much as he hated to keep a secret from him, Harry knew perfectly well that Malfoy’s name alone would make Ron irrational, and for now, while Harry still didn’t know whatever
(See the end of the chapter for
“So that’s where you disappeared to.” She looked smug. Her inch-long nails were sharpened to a point and painted a glossy black, and she drummed them against her cheek, the way a cat flicks its tail. “I’m surprised you kept it from me this whole time.”
"Yeah," he said. "If you want me to."
“I don’t plan to.”
“D’you really want me to back off?” he mumbled into Malfoy’s neck. “Because I will.”
Like in that antechamber off the Great Hall, Malfoy lifted a hand to brush away Harry’s fringe, and he knew Malfoy was again looking at his scar. It didn’t bother him the way it usually did when people stared. He watched Malfoy’s contemplative face and wondered what he was thinking.
“Yeah,” he nodded, leaning back against the wall. “I haven’t had a chance to talk to him this week, Quidditch practise kept me too busy. You — er — haven’t seen him, have you?”
“We all are,” Harry said with a nod, and in the spirit of proving himself right, tamped down on the part of himself which started to swell indignantly at the knowledge that Ron and Hermione had orchestrated something behind his back. It had, after all, turned out rather wonderfully. “I’m just trying to picture how Ron managed to corner him between lessons, y'know? And where the hell was I, by the way?”
Draco paused for a moment with the food still in his mouth, made wary by Theo’s tone of voice. He had had a feeling for about a week now that Theo was working himself up to something, he had seemed highly lost inside his thoughts a good chunk of the time, and often Draco would catch him staring off into space as though contemplating a difficult problem.
like you a whole bloody lot."
"To figure out how to navigate that stuff," says Harry, and he can feel his gaze burning into him. "Everything. Our different personalities. How to talk to each other."
It’s a transfigured step in an arbitrary staircase that first time. Draco, watching discreetly from the landing above, anticipating the satisfaction of watching the idiot put his foot through what appears to be a regular step but is actually wet cement, frowns when Potter does a clear double-take and pauses two steps down from it. Impossibly, he takes out his wand, mutters something, and Draco’s eyes go wide as he watches his own handiwork expose itself. Potter then says something to Weasley that Draco can’t hear, skips the step, and continues on his way up.
,” Hermione deadpanned, reminding him forcefully of their years at Hogwarts together. He might have blown off a Transfiguration essay for all the reproach that was soaked into her voice. “While I don’t condone this tantrum she’s thrown, I really do think you owe her an apology. That was incredibly insensitive.”
"What’s up?" he said lazily.
“I don’t
“Wait, what?” Harry said, and then, “Where are we going?”
“Well I’ve been getting my fill from Adrian, haven’t I?”
"I just wanna know this is real for you," said Harry, deliberately calm. "That's all."
yet — it was only Granger and Weasley who seemed to know, because
upset to find out for sure their friends were onto them. And that was comforting.
when he saw him coming out from behind a nearby bookshelf, having apparently ducked away to emerge from beneath the Cloak. He took the seat next to Draco’s as if nothing at all had just transpired, as if he’d only just come from a lesson with every intention in the world of studying.
"How long will you be doing this?" she asks.
Draco, losing himself entirely, moved forwards to kiss him and was both confused and mortified when Harry drew back.
Malfoy nodded but didn't look up. Just then there was the sound of a door opening from Pomfrey's office and Harry snatched his Cloak up and threw it over himself.
“You told him I was your boyfriend,” Harry whispered, pulling back only enough so their eyes could meet. He could still feel Harry’s breath ghost across his lips. “Is that what you want?”
Draco nods sleepily, mouthing at the skin near Harry’s nipple gently. “I want you to fuck me, next time.” Draco even has the nerve to say it casually, like the thought of sliding into that sweet body isn’t enough to blow a gasket in Harry’s brain. Still, so soon after release, his body can’t exactly rally another erection.
“You mattered to me.” The words hang in midair between them. Harry pushes forward, keenly aware of the blood rushing in his cheeks and his ears. “Sure, Voldemort was always there, in the back of my mind, written across my forehead, et cetera. But, I dunno. I didn’t think of him nearly as much as I thought of you.”
Malfoy, of course, is as infuriating as ever.
This somehow makes them laugh harder. Through the blur of tears, Harry can just make out Malfoy’s face, flushed and spread into a toohy, unselfconscious grin. For a swooping moment, Harry imagines diving in, pressing his lips to Malfoy’s, kissing him, tasting the moonlight and joy on his teeth.
Draco looks toward the door at Scorpius’ meow, looks almost surprised to see Harry. He attempts a smile but only manages a faint tremble of his lips, a sort of tightness around his striking grey eyes. He’s still wearing what he wore last night: sweatpants rolled up at the ankles and cinched tight around his impossible waist; hair in a single plait that moves diagonally across his head and down his shoulder; an overly large turtleneck with the sleeves rolled up just enough to expose his hands. Draco’s words return to Harry: his insistence that he would never be good enough for Harry, that Harry couldn’t possibly be happy with him forever.
In one graceful arc, Malfoy dives into the water. The light is just bright enough that Harry can make out his shape at the bottom of the pool, platinum hair floating in a cloud around his head. Harry watches, counts the seconds as Malfoy stays curled in a ball at the bottom of the pool.
“An answer, Potter. I want your answer, whatever it may be! I’ve already told you mine, but I’ll repeat it for good measure: I want you. All of you. I’ve had a crush on you, pined for you, watched you die and watched you bloody resurrect yourself again. I’ve wanted you for years, and I still want you, even when you keep me at arms length, even when you give me absolutely nothing.”
“Oh, I’m sorry.” Malfoy’s expression has morphed to something comically innocent, grey eyes wide, cheeks softened and slack with faux surprise. “I thought we were stating the obvious.” He holds the expression for only a few more heartbeats. Then they’re both giggling, punch drunk and falling over one another at the kitchen table. Malfoy holds a finger to Harry’s lips, trying to hush the honking laughs exploding out of him.
A flush has risen to the apples of Draco’s cheeks. His hands tremble against the grass. His expression, already hard, hardens further, then smooths completely to stone. “I never had you in the first,” he repeats quietly. “And now it seems I never will. I don’t know why I expected anything else.”
Harry falls to one knee in front of Draco’s chair and pries open the ring box. “Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he says, ignoring the way he’s panting slightly. “Will you marry me?”
worried about you.” Draco only has to glance at Harry before he’s laughing softly, gently, like they’re sharing an inside joke. “We aren’t talking about you behind your back or anything.” Shame rises in Harry’s throat. “We don’t even speak at all, really,” Draco continues. “But, much like you, his thoughts are written across his face. I’m starting to think it’s a Gryffindor thing.”
Beside him, Draco begins to snore.
He becomes real, somehow. He takes up space in Harry’s mind, even more than he did in years prior, and in a markedly different way. Instead of watching Malfoy laugh with his friends at the Slytherin table, he watches Malfoy read books at a speed that rivals Hermione. Instead of following Malfoy through the gothic halls of Hogwarts, he follows the line of Malfoy’s wrist as he sips his morning coffee; follows the line of his eyes, slitted with sleep and pleasure as he takes his first sip; follows the line of his lips as they curve into a satisfied smile.
“Can I touch you?”
“I understand I must have ruined… quite a few of your plans,” Draco says, voice pitched low and words carefully chosen, as they always are when he’s bracing for something bad. Confusion quickly curdles to understanding, then horror in Harry’s stomach.
“You’re drunk.” It isn’t what he should say. He should say yes. He
Draco isn’t
“You’re right! This story has never been about me! I’m just a prop for you to explore your sexuality with until you move onto somebody worthy of sharing your mind and heart with. You think I haven’t played this part before? I know all my lines, Potter! You’re the one that seems confused!” Draco takes a stuttered breath, clenches his teeth. “So now that we’ve established that this isn’t about me, we’re back to my question: what do you want?”
“This is what I get for asking,” he says quietly. “I should have contented myself with what I had when I had it. You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now.” He sways his feet gently, sending ripples through the water.
under his breath. Malfoy doesn’t contradict him. Harry hasn’t been able to stop thinking about it, about the way Malfoy’s lips had twitched upwards with Ron’s words, the hint of a wry smile as his fingers carried on their careful pattern.
Malfoy just shakes his head, presses his teeth together until Harry can see the flex of his jaw. Then, “You said what you meant, Potter.” The accusation lurking just beneath is a blow that Harry accepts without recourse.
Malfoy’s eyes fall unerringly on him. His expression is unusually unguarded, eyes fond and a little mischievous. “There you are.”
A pause.
Completely without warning, Malfoy’s eyes pop open, looking right at him. Harry flushes, looks to the grass as he should have done in the first place. What was he thinking, eyeing a man’s cock like that? It’s disgusting; indecent. He hears Malfoy swim to the edge of the pool, the water going soft and silent. Harry chances a look back. Malfoy is looking at him, eyes the most terrible, wonderful mixture of intense and playful. That half smile is painted across his lips, a challenge and invitation all at once.
“I see,” Draco sighs, dropping to a cross-legged position neatly. “We’re back to the silence.”
He flushes in embarrassment. He did nothing but lay back in the pillows the whole time; Draco had to keep checking in on him, slowing down or stopping altogether; his body jiggled in weird ways with each thrust and his face probably did monumentally stupid things. He’s pretty sure if he hadn’t bitten his lip a whole host of ugly sounds would have burst through. He pulls the covers back over his body, despite how hot he still is.
When Harry doesn’t respond, Malfoy shrugs. “Suit yourself. The water is surprisingly warm.” Then, with an artful twist in the water, he’s floating on his back. His whole, nude body is suddenly bared to Harry. He should look away. He knows he should. He should look to his hands, or the grass, find something to say to fill the silence that’s fallen between them. Harry does none of these things. Instead, he does what he always does. He watches Malfoy.
Harry sees Ginvera with tears in her eyes, and he knew he had to play the role of Harrison. He went up to her and gave her a soft hug. “It’s ok Ginerva, Cedric will be ok,” he whispered softly in her ear. Ginvera wrapped her arms around his waist squeezing it tight.
“Butter beer”
Harry was getting extremely angry at Cedric’s antics. He knocked Cedric back harder causing the brunette to veer off in a different direction. Harry and Cedric began to bump into each other trying to throw one another off. Each time the two rivals bumped harder into each other.
Harry and Draco run down the passage leaving the snuggly duckling behind them.
The class ripples with laughter as Harry laughs too while looking around to see why everyone is laughing. He stares at McGonagall’s face who gives a sneer with the teacup perched in front of her lips, something he never has seen her do before. He looks at the people in the side, then to McGonagall, he widens his eyes in realization, as he immediately stops laughing pursing his face together.
“No,” the blonde spoke before tears entered his eyes, “my...my mom used to call me her dragon, did you know?” Harry looked at Draco patiently waiting for the blonde to speak. “When my stomach growled like that...when I was 4...the great war was still going on, and the food was scarce. Sometimes we couldn’t get food, so we went to bed hungry, and the other times, my mum and dad always gave me a share of their food. Draco let out a small sigh as he wiped the stray tears in his eyes. “When my stomach growled, she used to tease that a dragon inside my tummy was the reason why I was hungry because it always ate my food.” Harry didn’t know what to say to Draco’s confession. He was surprised that Draco trusted him with such a personal experience.
*The Summerland: the name given by Theosophists, Wiccans and some earth-based contemporary pagan religions to their conceptualization of an afterlife*
“He..he is Harry Potter and is from the other world.”
Sirius laughed, “more like lost, they came out of hiding and now they are going back in.”
Harry sat in the corner of the library as he opened Hogwarts: a History. Harry skimmed through the pages and it looked similar to the one from his world. The eradication of Slytherin House: Harry gasped in delight as he began to read.
Harry could see Draco gulp before he responded with a small yet delicate voice, “yes my lord”
Harry clutched his heart, “what?? After all this, you still don’t trust me?”
“Yes my lady” Harry looked at Draco, this was the first time he heard the man speak. The voice was soft and melodic but yet it had a hint of fear. Harry knew these people practiced on the fustys…god how he hated the word.
“Something funny happened outside the library today,” Ginerva spoke out after a couple minutes of silence.
Harry felt his heart beat faster, he was sure it was going to burst out of his chest and run away in fear from Snape’s threatening tone. “I..I am serious sir,” he squeaked out sinking lower into the ground.
Lucius scoffed, “really? I’m pretty sure he has figured out a way around that.” Narcissa gently put her hand on Lucius’s shoulder rubbing is a softy, “Have you forgotten what Harrison did to Draco?” Lucius slammed his hard on the table that it shook. “What ALL OF THEM did to my son? My baby boy?” the older blonde cried out. “DRACO WAS 4!”
----------
Harry closed his eyes taking a deep breath to control his anger. Everyone he met, the f..fust… he couldn’t even say the horrible name, were all so innocent and kind. There eyes, even in pain, hurt and wonder still remained hopeful. Even when he was fighting Voldemort, the people fighting with him didn’t remain this hopefull. The anger he felt at everyone in this terrible world, everyone he believed to be good, kind, caring and especially forgiving was not. They were worse than any monster he encountered, including the death eaters.
Harry did not know what to say as he just hugged the crying witch and rubbed her back murmuring soft and comforting words in her ear. Harry looked up to see Rodolphus staring at him as he signaled him to go. Harry nodded as he gently guided Bellatrix to lay on Rodolphus who took her in open arms.
Bellatrix leans back on the chair, “and what is that?” she asks her voice low.
“Thank you,” Draco said, as he lovingly stared at the sleeping calico. “Do you think you can get more toys for her? I like the red flashlight one.”
Fred slapped his shoulder playfully, “it means the halls will be loud with the fusty’s cries of pain, won’t that be hilarious!”
Draco uses the frying pan to lift the lip off the stranger seeing his teeth. “No sharp teeth?” He mutters to himself. Something sparkly catches his eye. Draco frowns as he grabs the man's satchel and looks inside. Gasping slightly he takes the sparkly thing out. It was a big bracelet with jewels encrusted around it. Draco smiles as he puts it on his wrist, looking at Pascal who shakes his head. Maybe Pascal was right, this is not a bracelet, but Draco couldn’t figure out what it was.
“See the sun!!” Alexander squealed with delight. “Daddy says its supa yellow and weally wam!” The young child had trouble pronouncing his “r”s which everyone found adorable.
“We need to go now!” exclaimed Harry, as he grabbed Draco running towards Remus, “Please Remus, is there a back entrance.”
“I wanted to make the little princess work and suffer for a change Sirius!” Andromeda spoke loudly.
Draco looked shocked. “But...if it is 10 seconds, Harry won’t be able to help us,” he mewls softly.
Harry touched Narcissa’s arm comfortingly, “of course, Mrs. Malfoy, I won’t let anything happen to Draco.”
“Dracooooo let down your hair,” Draco winces as Bellatrix calls out for him.
Harry looked at Sirius who looked smug. “We will defeat the Knights into submission, and we will finally win the war.”
"STOP IT!” He boomed out, shocked at how he could speak. Everyone immediately looked at him as they dropped Theo to the ground who held his red burnt ear crying. “Everyone out!” Harry’s heart beat faster.
“That was awfully nice of you mate! Those bread rolls looked and smelled delicious” Harry smiled. Harry really hoped this Fred might realize the error in his ways as well as many other of his ‘friends’. Maybe they could help them fight against this terrible injustice.
“That’s good of him,” Harry finally replied. Harry wondered if Peter in this world and his world switch the conscious like him. He knew this Peter is someone his parents and godfather would have definitely been friends with.
“Ok Xavi let go of Harry now, we have to go.” Snape interrupted grinning at Alexander.
“I always suffer knowing what Draco has endured Lucius, knowing what he has suffered and I will always suffer knowing I left my godson in their hands when I should have done something, ANYTHING, even if it meant betraying myself, but I didn’t, and that will forever haunt me.” Snape spat out. “But I will tell you this, Harry Potter, not Lord Harrison James Potter, Harry Potter will protect Draco with his life.”
“Yes mother and father, I will not fail you” he spoke after finding his voice. They both smiled proudly before making their way past him. Harry’s heartbeat accelerated as he walked to the courtyard.
‘Don’t worry Theo, I will help you and your friends, I promise” Harry pulled Theo in for a hug who buried his face in harry’s chest his breathing slowing down as he fell asleep. Harry still continued to rub his back contemplating on what he is going to do to save the people he once thought were his enemies and having to fight the people he thought he loved.
Nott looked at him, “u..m people like me aren’t allowed to get h..healed my lord?” Nott asked his voice going higher at Harry’s question. Harry started to wrap a bandage around the skin as he felt Nott’s body tense up in fear. “I..I think t..this will scar” Harry stuttered out.
Dahlia instantly hardened her gaze, “Well you are a professor? Can’t you do something?”
Theo gulped with a look of sheer terror on his face quickly glancing at Draco as more tears rolled down his cheeks, ‘yes my lady” .
“It is my favorite card game too!” Harry remarks grinning at Draco who playfully glared at him.
“That’s always my favorite part of our day flower,” she says.
“I...I…” Harry stuttered out unsure of what to say. He was worried he angered the witch, and in both worlds, he didn’t want to be on the wrong side of her wand.
Theo looked at him, “I..I sure hope so my lord, what Lord Ronald does to my friend is terrible, and m..many of your friends here own my friends” Theo said softly.
“Sweet Merlin!” Theo exclaimed as he threw his hands up in defeat as Draco smiled sticking his tongue out at the brunette. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at their antics. The trio was on their 6th game of Uno. Draco won 3 times, Harry and Theo won only once.
Harry head a chorus of laughter entering the room. Harry’s heart fluttered looking at Cedric. He wanted to go up and hug the Hufflepuff boy and never let him go. Cedric’s death, in his world, still hits him hard, as he remembers the bright boy’s smile. The smile he remembers matches the Cedric in front of him now.
“I can teach you,” Harry finally said as he held his wand out to Theo. The brunette hesitantly looked at the wand and Harry smiled comfortingly, “I will teach you an easy spell, come on, hold it.”
Harry beamed, “Thank you, sir! I look forward to learning and participating in my traditions.”
Nott looked at Harry confused before letting out a small sigh. “Well it was the Great Wizarding War, in which the dark side and the light side fought.” Harry looked on gesturing for Nott to continue, “The Supreme, may he forever reign on us, defeated the evil Tom Riddle, saving our world from the destruction of m.m.my kind” Nott stuttered out the last part.
“There is no way Dumbledore would allow this right….” He whispered to himself as someone came up to him. He didn’t recognize this person. She had black hair which the ends looked burn off, dark brown eyes, tan skin covered in badly healed cuts. “How can I help you, my lord?” She asked softly.
Draco nodded as he held the kitten a little closer, “you will let me know the first thing right? When you hear from them.”
Harry felt his world crashing as he immediately stood up causing Nott to drop his chicken and immediately drop to the floor head on the ground crying out “I’m sorry my lord please forgive me” repeatedly. Harry walked around the room trying to calm his heart down. There is not way his parents were a part of this disgusting act, he would not believe it. But seeing Nott on the floor like that, compared to the Nott in his world, he knew, this world was different and he wanted to get out. His ‘friends’ he met were not his friends, and these people were definitely not his parents, the ones who believed the best in everyone and gave their life for him.
“I’m sure you can have children after the war?”
Lily nodded agreeing with James, “We cannot let those slaved putrid bloods and the escaped putrid bloods to think anything will change, this will always be a constant reminder for what they did…to muggles and especially my kind Harrison” Lily said with a dark tone making Harry shudder. “You do know what they wanted to do the Muggle-borns, muggles and those who stood by us right Harrison?”
“Um...Tom Riddle?” Harry asks his voice high in confusion, wondering why Voldemort’s prevalent nicknames weren’t known.
Snape nodded, “yes, I was, Draco, if Taylor got the snitch one second late, England would have lost.”
“What happened?” Nymphadora asked taking a bite of her filet mignon.
“But mother, I am old enough, I can handle myself!”
Harry saw his ‘parents’ waive the Gryffindor flags wildly in the stands. James had a sign with Ginevra's face that stated ‘My future daughter-in-law’. Harry never saw a more tacky and distasteful sign in his life. Even when Aunt Petunia made a sign with a horrendous picture with big, bold and bright lettering cheering Dudley at his soccer [football] match.
“Ok….Potter, you may.” Lucius said as he and wrapped his arm around Narcissa’s waist kissing the top of her head.
Harry looked in his eyes, “not without saving all of you first”,
Snape snorted at Sirius, “Don’t get too cocky Black, that’s how they get you.”
Harry finally seen him. His rival. His arch nemesis to him and his friends, much more dirtier than Theo, his hair matted with black dust and dried blood as he looked skinner than ever. Bruises covered his arms and legs and some parts of his stomach which was shown through his ripped rags. Like Theo, he had a metal collar wielded on his neck to which he assumed was the Weasley crest symbol. Draco’s eyes were cast down not looking up as he could see silent tears fall.
“And the only other family you need to know is Narcissa and Lucius,” Snape added. “They were captured along with Draco, but Peter helped them escape.”
Dumbledore waved him off, “what forces? The traitors living underground like filthy rats while letting their children suffer under us.” Tom growled as he instantly lunged at Dumbledore, only to be pushed down to the ground with a magical wave of force. “If your forces did care, they would have came a long time ago.”
Harry shivered at her threat and by no means, he wanted to betray her, “I promise I will never.”
“I thought about the Great War and what happened, students, that brought so much anger and meaning which allowed me to perform this curse,” Remus said as he eyed Harry who looked down. “Thank Merlin you students didn’t experience the war, your parents fought for all of you”.
“Theodore Nott,” Bellatrix replied, “we call him Teddy, boy little Teddy, and Draco were practically inseparable when they were infants.”
Dahlia with red eyes stared at him as she sniffed. “I...I just want to protect him...all of them.” Her teary blue eyes narrow with ambition and determination, “I will die for the children if I have too and may Morgana guide me through this war.”
Lily Evans, who when headgirl had taken points from Gryffindor house for starting a fight with Slytherin students on the rumors of them joining the death eaters, even though Lily knew it was true because she caught a glimpse of the dark mark. Lily Evans who gave everyone chances after chances because she firmly believed anyone can change, and the person who without a doubt would give her life for the people she loved.
Theo looked at Harry whose eyes are closed. “A..are you ok Harry?” he asked his voice timidly.
“I am fine Albus,” Lily laughed, “I bumped into Sec on his way over here, so I decided to tag along.”
“Of course you are Bella,” Severus teased as they both walked up to Harry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Just then Alexander came in, “AUNTIE ALLIE!” he yelled out jumping on to Alecto who squealed in delight.
“Thank you,” Harry said, as he snapped the shot of the Malfoy duo smiling tenderly into the camera. “Draco will love this,” he tells them as he looked at the picture on the screen. He was going to print it out and give it as a present to Draco.
“Watch it Snivellus,” Sirius glared at Snape as he stepped closer to the black haired man. Snape not backing down from Sirius’s actions stepped closer to Sirius, straightening his back glaring right back.
Amycus and Alecto were laughing as they both hunched over as they looked to be in tears. “Opera singing toast!” Alecto said.
Ronald inspects the teacup smirking to himself, as Harry glared at him, “What are you doing?” he asks trying to hide venom behind his voice.
Fred rolled his eyes as he waved his hand, “Nah, don’t bother, take them to your little fusty friends.” Fred paused for a moment pursing his lips like he is thinking something. “You’re food for the week.”
Harry could see Severus scared slightly, and he would have been too. “This...this Harrison...Harry is not our enemy Bella….he was acting strangely earlier...I read his mind, he is not the actual Harrison.”
“Do you want…”
Harry deeply misses his mum. The stories he heard about her from his godfather, and professors. The one who stands up for what is right even for those who wronged her. Harry distinctly remembers how Sirius told him how his mum stood up for Bellatrix Black at Hogwarts. Lily vouched for Bellatrix who was wrongly accused of hexing a really nasty curse on one of the muggle-born students, which could have caused her to get expelled. Lily knew Bellatrix didn't do it. Even though Bellatrix still bullied her, joined a cult that wanted her kind dead, Lily never regretted her choice.
George looked at Ginny…Ginerva confused. “Harrison hit his head couple day’s back, I still think he is a bit bonkers” Ronald said.
“SHOW! SHOW! SHOW!” the young happy boy yelled.
James looked at his son again, “your friends are in the courtyard practicing their curses, remember to do it right Harrison, when you become an Auror like me to track the rest of the putrid traitors we want to cast spells, fast, correct and cause pain.”
Harry smirked out before opening his mouth placing one hand to his chest and his other arm raised up as beautiful voices came out of his mouth. With each different voice, Harry changed his position acting along and laughing alongside the twins and one happy little boy.
Harry slammed the book shoving it in his bag. He was thrilled, he needed someone to talk to about continuing his plans in order to help this world and leave it to join his.
Narcissa gasped her hand going to her mouth, “I love that picture!” She sniffled, “we were at a park with Draco, and that was taken after he had a fun time on the swing set.”
Harry smiled and nodded, “Yeah, Theo I am fine,” he says grunting to he gets up. Harry looks around the room to see it clean. Blinking in surprise he asks, “Theo did you do this? You didn’t have too.”
The train halted to a stop. Harry sighed in relief, At least Hogwarts still looked the same. Harry stepped out of the train to see a plenty of Red, Yellow and Blue. Green seemed to be missing.
----------
Harry gently placed a hand on her shoulder rubbing it softly giving the grieving witch comfort as he silently waited for her to continue.
Ronald came up to Hermione Jean looking crestfallen, as his arm wrapped around her waist.
To his immense surprise, Draco leans forward and kisses the corner of his mouth. Harry catches him before he can get too far and pulls him back in for a real one. Even when their lips part and Draco’s tongue slides into his mouth it stays slow and sweet, and Harry rubs his thumb obsessively over the scar on Draco’s neck that starts just below the jaw and curves down over his throat. He used to cover it up, but Harry convinced him to stop doing it. He loves every last one of them, and they’re numerous, littering his whole torso and cutting across his right bicep in one place.
Malfoy didn't respond, returning his attention to his book. He looked small and vulnerable bundled up in a winter cloak and plain green hat that covered most of his hair, cheeks pink with the cold.
“Why are you so determined to believe that’s all this is?” he questioned softly. And what right did he have, really? Sounding so sickeningly sincere, so utterly laid out for Draco’s perusal? It was something Draco himself had never been any good at — it was perhaps the reason he’d excelled in Occlumency. Shutting down his emotions was second nature. Potter was, of course, just the opposite. He seemed not to be afraid of emotional pain, and that fact never failed to leave Draco feeling completely out of his element.
Harry laughed weakly, a thin, strained sound. Malfoy’s grip slackened.
Find me at
“Hello, Professor,” said Harry, walking inside and shutting the door behind him. “Do you have a moment?”
"Unbelievable," Malfoy muttered, returning his attention to his own essay with a shake of his head. The movement caused some of his hair to fall in his face but he didn't seem to notice, because he started writing again. Harry had a sudden, powerful urge to push it behind his ear.
“You’re very persistent, aren’t you?”
“Laugh it up,
“These,” he went on, indicating two very small scars on the inside of his forearm, and then twisting it to show identical ones on the other side, “are from the snake. It bit me when it came out of Bathilda's body. Hermione put Dittany on them, but it’s not as good as phoenix tears, of course, so they never healed all the way. I have more here and there, but those are the ones with, er ...
Harry grinned predatorily, amused to see the way Malfoy’s careful expression faltered for a moment. He moved to sit down beside him, and Malfoy reluctantly slid over to make room, uncrossing his legs and, after a moment, pulling them up to cross them. He was somehow straight-backed and composed even with a palpably tentative energy coming off of him.
He heard the shower start. He had half a mind to go in there and demand to be fucked, but decided against it in the end. Mostly it was that he didn’t want to
Ron was working with his brother at their joke shop in Diagon Alley.
“Godric’s Hollow,” said Harry. Saying the name out loud made his heart leap. “It’s where I was born.”
“It’s just very unlike her.” Setting his knife aside with the last of the beans drained of their juice, Draco set the bowl aside and turned to Blaise, unable to do anything more until the lacewing flies had been turned to powder. “Usually when she starts getting worried about exams she —”

"And since when do you smoke those filthy Muggle things in here anyway, or this frequently for that matter?" she demands. "Hermione tells me they're terrible for you."

“Malfoy, d’you wanna have a cigarette with me?” he asked suddenly. Malfoy blinked several times in succession.
"I dunno!" Daphne admits, sounding harassed. "He's ... well, he's
Draco swallows. He opens the screen and flicks the cigarette out the window and reaches for another one, but Harry stops him with a hand on his wrist.

sure, that he’s right. Draco’s been pretty happy with Kit -- bookstore fuckboy with the (confirmed) poncy hair. Sometimes they make eyes at each other and Harry stifles vomit. And devastation. Both.
They fell asleep that way, and in the early hours of the morning Ginny snuck out of his bed and went back to her dorm for the last time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinked at him again. It took him another few seconds to locate his voice.
“Sometimes,” Draco said shortly. He gave her nothing else, and it was worth the satisfaction of watching her squirm. A moment passed, and with a put-upon sigh she came over to the bed and sat down, leaving a fair amount of space between them.
“This isn’t even fucking real,” Harry told himself, and he pressed his free hand to his forehead, like he might feel a fever burning there.
“And now?”
“I’m not a girl, Potter.”
“Fine. When?” he said finally. Potter looked somewhat relieved by this response. “I’m not missing class.”

“You suppose correctly.”
"Thank you, Professor, really —"
“Yes?”
She licked her lips, looking as guilty as sin and twice as miserable. “That was … I’m not proud of that. But, Draco … what if it had been me? I mean … how would
And so maybe he was a little ruder to Potter than usual when he was forced to interact with him, but really, could he be blamed? It was Potter’s own fault.
“I’m an early-riser!” Draco said defensively.
end of the spectrum.”
, biting harshly down on his lip, Draco can feel Potter line up and start pushing inside. It's nothing like his two fingers, the stretch is significant and painful and it feels incredible. He squeezes his thighs around Potter's waist, pushing some of Daphne's long hair off his sweaty forehead and then bracing himself with his hands on Potter's broad shoulders. He can feel Potter watching him but can't find the courage to hold his stare, and anyway it feels so
He recognises Harry's voice the moment he steps out of the Floo into Ron and Hermione's flat. It's coming from the kitchen, deep and indistinct but clearly animated as he usually is around his best friends.
"Draco," he says in a voice that can only be called fatherly, coming over to him and putting a hand on his shoulder. "You love this boy and you're making up reasons not to be with him. That's exceedingly silly."
“And you’ve had
"Of course not," said the boy finally, teeth gritted. "Potter, come on, you know I'm just saying —"

“That’s, er — that’s my cousin’s son, isn’t it?” Draco said with a croaky voice, a poor attempt at covering his suddenly flared-up emotions.
Draco glares at him and Harry seems immediately to regret it, because some of the anger leaves his face.
His wrists throbbed painfully and he gritted his teeth.
There is, Harry notices, a soft blush colouring Malfoy’s cheeks and nose. It’s very endearing.
It feels like another accusation. As if Harry is intentionally drawing attention to how unsteady Draco's been since their breakup.

This was too much for Harry, and it was all he needed to know for sure he'd been right. A rage so fierce that it made his blood seem to boil beneath his skin overcame him within seconds; he barely even heard Hermione’s quiet, terrified squeak behind him before he was grabbing his wand from his pocket and pointing it at Kenny’s back.
, though.”
“You said yourself we don’t know each other, Potter. All you’ve done is shag me the last week, you can’t know you
Breaking the pregnancy news to the two of them had not been easy, and surprisingly it had been Blaise who'd taken it best. Pansy had required at least an hour to come down from hysterics. Blaise had seemed almost ... unsurprised.
“Oh, not you too,” Harry snapped, mood plummeting the instant the word ‘immature’ left her mouth. His temper was not easy to stoke these days, quite the opposite of the way he’d been before the war — although Harry supposed that might have had something to do with the fact that, in the last few years, he’d stopped taking anything all that seriously. “Like the
Draco nods.
He’d never given the jumper back, and sometimes — when the darkness was too dark, and the panic was a tight grip on his throat — he’d even wear it and let the fading smell of Potter soothe him to sleep.
The next evening Draco sat with them in the common room for the first time, and Goyle didn't join them. They captured absolutely everyone's attention, though no one actually said anything.
Over the next week Harry kept a closer eye on Malfoy, but he still made no effort to talk to him.
“I seriously doubt he’d be happy about being gawked at,” Harry said hotly, and then cleared his throat when he realised how close he’d come to growling those words. Parvati appeared taken aback. “I mean … he’s probably already uncomfortable enough as it is.”
Harry’s head fell back against his neck, eyes falling closed in frustration. This was not at all how he’d imagined this would go.
“Yes, love?”
get overly emotional about such seemingly small things.
“I’m not looking forward to the practical portion of this lesson,” Blaise said suddenly, setting his quill down on top of his parchment. “I can’t imagine why Boothby is bothering — there are full-grown wizards who can’t produce a proper Patronus. I suspect Potter and his disciples are fully prepared to show off when the time comes.”

purely) out of a desire to help, he’d been unable to escape the glaringly obvious truth of the situation, which was that he’d been counting on another chat. Everything Malfoy had said to him that night in the bathroom had resonated. Most astoundingly, it had given Harry something to think about that he wouldn’t otherwise have gleaned for himself. Even Hermione didn’t quite know how to talk to Harry and she seemed to have figured out for herself that she couldn’t help him.
, no —”
?” Harry said again, something low and dangerous in his voice. Draco shivered.
This caught Harry off guard, comprehension dawning slowly, like a light being turned on a degree at a time.
That, and watching him study with Hermione, of course.
“No idea,” he said. “I’m only twenty-three. I’ve got time to figure it out.”
“Er — hello,” she said, and Draco could only gape. “Pansy — erm — she didn’t look like she was going to come help you. I … I thought …” And to Draco’s utter astonishment, she held up what appeared to be a small cotton pad. “They’re not hard to use. The back is sticky. And they’re charmed so they’ll last longer.”
“You’ve been talking to him,” Hermione said slowly, sounding like she’d just had a theory confirmed that she hadn’t
“You know what I mean, Potter.”
Eventually they came to a wall, and once again Potter spoke Parseltongue to open it up. Draco got the uneasy feeling that what they’d come to see was just beyond, and his heart jumped.
that —”
He has his fingers in the powder when Harry finally joins them, verdant eyes finding Draco and settling there. His hands are shoved modestly into the pockets of his jeans and there's a look on his face like he knows it was audacious to come in here, yet he'd done it anyway. Draco misses him so fiercely in this moment that he allows himself a brief fantasy where he goes over there and lets Harry wrap him up in one of those big stupid bear hugs he'd always loved so much. He gets the unsettling feeling Harry knows exactly what's going on in his head just as clearly as if he'd written it out on a piece of parchment for him.
Harry and Draco were neither of those things.
"But that's just it!" she said imploringly. "I
"Thanks. See you later, Potter."
from the minute and a half you spent in his presence?”
“Where are we?” Draco asked, looking around with his eyebrows drawn and soft snow falling in his hair. Flakes stuck to his golden lashes and left a beautiful, rosy stain on his pale cheeks. If Harry had ever experienced heartache just by
When he was studying with Granger, the matter of where they sat in the library ceased to be a problem. When he was alone, however — like now, because the Golden Trio had a lesson — Draco had taken to sitting in more obscure corners of the library to avoid either confrontation or blatant staring. The staring in particular, which had gotten ten times worse since his and Harry’s relationship had gone public.
“Seriously, what’s with you?” he said, more softly now, eyes narrowing. He’d stopped at a distance of maybe a foot, and Draco could clearly see the startling green of his eyes. “Why’re you acting all jittery?”
! I won't hear another word!"
Without thinking about it first, Draco stood up from his chair while Boothby was in the middle of a sentence, horrified when he felt the back of his robes stick to his legs for a moment.
“Potter,” Draco breathed, dropping his hands from Potter’s hair down to the front of his robes, where he slipped them inside and brushed his fingers across the waistline of the slacks he was wearing underneath. He heard Potter’s breath hitch and the movement of his lips on Draco’s skin halted. He pulled back and met Draco’s gaze. His pupils were so dilated there were only thin strips of green left circling them. “Can I?”
“Maybe I just wanted to kiss you,” he said lightly. Draco frowned. “Ever think of that?”
Not to mention the inner turmoil Malfoy must have been going through without the added stress of being gawked at by everyone who walked past him.

"Oh yeah, I'm sure," says Draco scathingly. He can see Harry's jaw muscle twitch. The thing is he
“I’m just talking about your
He and Draco had dinner together every night. Sometimes with friends over (usually Ron and Hermione or Goyle and Daphne or all four at once), sometimes by themselves, often in front of the telly with his feet in Draco's lap and a container of takeout. Other than the Weasleys', he'd never known a place to feel so much like a home, and this one was
Draco had not made all that much progress with his Patronus — he couldn’t seem to muster up the extra
Normally, Hermione would have already buried her nose in a book by the time they were ten minutes out of Hogsmeade, but today, both she and Ron kept exchanging covert glances that Harry was very much aware of, but didn’t bother mentioning. He’d gotten used to this over the years — Ron and Hermione’s silent form of communication in his presence, particularly when they were preparing to broach a topic they planned to tag-team.
of everything,” Harry said firmly. And he meant it. If there was one thing he was absolutely sure about, it was that Lily and James Potter would understand better than most falling in love with someone you once hated. “Because nothing has ever been as real as this is.”
With as much control as he could muster, Harry pulled out all the way and pressed fluidly back inside, making Draco arch his back. He did it again, Draco's hands going to his arms and squeezing, and soon he'd started up a rhythm, fucking him with measured strokes that pulled exquisite noises out of him. Draco's eyes closed and he leaned his head back against the window, tempting Harry with his bared neck, and he didn't bother resisting. He sucked on his skin while he fucked him at an ever-increasing pace, Draco's damp skin creating squeaking noises against the glass where Harry's sharp thrusts made him slide against it.
“Other what?” Potter asked. He had not moved his hand from Draco’s grip.
"Stuff," said Harry, grinning. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry rolled his eyes but smiled. “Wouldn’t dream of it. So is that a yes?”
“But I’m enjoying myself so much,” he whispers, hand sliding from Draco’s hip to his lap, where he squeezes over his half-hard cock, causing him to squirm and gasp in surprise. He grabs Harry’s hand and pulls it away with pink cheeks while Harry laughs against his neck.

, and not his pain or his fear either. Harry saw everything in that moment, a Draco Malfoy stripped naked and raw and vulnerable, and it stirred up so much emotion he nearly felt sick with it.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” he whispered against his lips. Harry’s arms came up to circle around his waist. When he pulled back slightly, he saw those fervently green eyes up close and his chest ached with something too complicated for words. “I used to … I
For a reason he didn’t feel like exploring, he thought of their first train ride to Hogwarts. Potter’s rejection of his friendship, the sting of which, were he honest with himself, Draco knew had never entirely gone away.
“That’s what you want?” Potter questioned, voice low and gravelly. Draco swallowed hard and nodded. “Yeah. Go ahead, then.”
. “But I don’t know what you mean, since I
Draco whipped his head around and Harry laughed, glad to see it had worked so well as a topic-shifter.
“One of them was a locket. Hermione and I were looking for the Sword of Gryffindor at Bathilda Bagshot's house in Godric's Hollow, but it wound up being a trap. She'd already died, and Voldemort's snake, Nagini, had, like ... possessed her body. I dunno ... it was the single most fucked-up thing I've ever seen in my life, I'll tell you that much. Anyway, Nagini let Voldemort know we were there, and I guess the Horcrux must have sensed him or
“I knew it,” he says, and with what appears to be relish blocks a second jinx that Draco fires off. “It’s you who’s been fucking with me.”
“You really like tits, huh?” he said when he’d gotten his breath back, but instead of the laugh or the grin he expected, he got an expression that was almost suspicious instead.
“Fuck you, Potter!” Draco bursts out. He gets unsteadily to his feet and pushes both hands through his hair, off his sweaty forehead, and wipes the wetness away from his cheeks. He’s shutting down, repressing, going dark again. “
“To talk to him,” he said tightly. As if this whole thing wasn’t bad enough, now he had to pass a test to get past Granger the bridge troll. “I thought he told you —”
He doesn’t realize he’s crying until he’s flinching away from Harry’s palm. Harry crumbles, hand going limp midair, and Draco can only curl in on himself further. “I’m sorry,” he croaks.
This one is short, like chapter two, but I promise the next chapter is longer. I hope you're enjoying the story so far!
Draco soon returns, slipping under the sheets to lay beside Harry. His movements and body are graceful in the low light.
Draco can feel Harry’s eyes on him. He finishes reading the essay, marking preliminary notes in pencil, before turning to look at Harry. He’s glowing, a few fingers of Fire Whiskey warming the heights of his cheeks, the tips of his ears. He’s gorgeous.
“I can’t.”
“I won’t wait forever,” Draco repeats quietly. “ I’m just telling you: I won’t wait for you forever. You aren’t the only person capable of loving me, Harry. You just
“I hated being married to her because we never should have gotten married in the first place. When we got married, we’d never lived alone together, or made any major financial decisions, or even talked about what we wanted from our lives. But everyone around us was getting married without those things too, and asking us when we would tie the knot. It sounded like the right choice, or at least the obvious one.”
“Yes! Obviously, yes,” Draco says, some of his usual life and sharpness returning. “But--”
Harry freezes, mingled shock and horror caught on his face. He looks down to the ring then back at Draco. “You can’t,” he echoes. “Why not?”
Harry nods.
Draco. He wants Draco, and he wants Malfoy just as badly. There is a Draco-Malfoy-shaped nothing in his life, in his hands, on his lips, in his mouth. His day is spent navigating around this nothingness, feeling its outline and entirely unable to probe its depth.
“I came to check on you; see how you’re doing. You’ve been… off.”
Last night comes back to him in painful drips: Draco, beautiful and focused on the couch, bundled in sweats and Harry’s turtleneck, his sharp nose tucked into the cuff; the panic and pain in Draco’s eyes as he said he couldn’t marry Harry; the way he flinched when Harry reached out to comfort him.
Finally, Malfoy breaks the surface and swims to the edge of the pool. He comes just close enough to lay his arms on the stone border, lays his head down with them. “You can come out from under the cloak,” he announces to no one in particular. “I know you’re there.”
What is he saying thank you for, anyway? Thank you for seeing me, even when I am invisible? Thank you for letting me bear witness to your freedom? Thank you for letting me look at your dick? Thank you for not punching me in the face? Thank you for being a faggot?
Draco flinches, finishes his sentence in a rush. “And be ready to leave.”
Harry wakes up alone for the first time in nearly five years. The bed is cold. Even without moving he knows that the animals haven’t made their way onto the bed with him. Meaning the door wasn’t open for them to sneak in. Meaning Draco never followed him to bed.
He wants to love Draco in the sunlight.

The thought sobers him, pulls him up short. Malfoy picks up on his seriousness, follows suit quickly. His brow furrows. “Are you alright?”
“Your hair’s curly.” Harry doesn’t know why he’s said it, can’t fathom why the words have escaped his stupid lizard brain. But Malfoy doesn’t look offended or weirded out. He just looks at Harry and slowly raises an eyebrow.
As promised, a longer chapter! The next one is the finish line, friends!
Draco tips his head back and laughs into the night. He’s beautiful. Harry isn’t sure if he wants to laugh or cry. “I don’t blame you,” Draco finally says. “I was a real prick at eleven. To be honest I wasn’t worth being around until Fifth Year, and by then you hated me.”
He moves through the house like he owns it, rearranging furniture and swapping pillows as he pleases. Inevitably, the occupants of the room look to Harry, wondering when he’ll finally put a stop to Malfoy’s slow but steady refurbishment of Grimmauld Place. Harry isn’t sure how to say that, technically, Malfoy has more claim to it than he does. He isn’t sure how to admit that he likes the changes Malfoy’s made, admires his eye for colors and textures, the way his presence seems to make the walls sigh in contented pleasure. He isn’t sure how to say any of it, so he just looks back at them like that’s any sort of response and let’s Malfoy carry on.
, Draco had said with a grin when they first toured the house.
Draco snorts a laugh. “I’m flattered.”
“Draco--”
“She wasn’t,” Harry asserts slowly, fighting the impulse to shout in order to be heard, a long-standing, knee-jerk reaction to even the mention of Ginny. “She
The sun rises over the table, their coffee gone cold in their hands once again. It’s a strange thing, to see Draco in the rising light of day. So often, Harry sees him one of two ways: bathed in moonlight, or drenched in the sun. Never has he seen Malfoy at dawn. Never has he watched the sun bloom across the flush of Draco’s lips. Never has he loved Draco this much, this violently.
“What?”
Harry laughs a shade too loud for the silence. Draco lights up like the sun (or maybe the moon? Either way he’s radiant and nearly too bright to look at) and gives him a gentle shove. Harry obediently rolls onto his back to receive the pile of sharp joints and soft hair known as a sleepy Draco Malfoy. Draco slings a leg over Harry’s hip, an arm over his stomach, and nuzzles his head into Harry’s soft pec. He wiggles and shifts for long minutes, adjusting the placement of feet and elbows before Harry wraps an arm around him to hold him still.
“I’m not a faggot.” The words are out of his mouth before he can really consider them, a bitter taste rising to follow them past his lips. Malfoy’s face shutters, then rearranges into an expression Harry doesn’t recognize. He opens his mouth but clearly thinks better of it and closes his lips. Harry tries to do the same, tries to say something to fill the awful silence that’s fallen, but nothing comes out.
“Good.” The frankness in Draco’s tone startles a bark of laughter from Harry. Draco’s face is painfully serious. “I’m not joking,” he says. “I’m glad you don’t look like me. That would be immensely weird. I’m glad you look like you because you look gorgeous and I’m really into you.”
“Go get the ring and ask again, Harry! Christ.”
“I don’t get it,” Harry confesses. “You look—” Harry gives up on the sentence and runs his hand down the side of Draco’s body instead. Not an ounce of fat exists, pale skin nearly hairless and smoother than butter. His muscles are defined and firm, beautiful in the flickering light of the room. Even his scars look dignified and tasteful.“You look like a sculpture,” he finally says. “Like something someone carved out of marble, something to be put in a museum. I definitely don’t look like that.”
“We just had sex, Draco.”
Draco lays a hand directly on the roundest curve of Harry’s stomach. Harry sucks in instinctively. Intellectually, of course, he’s aware of how ridiculous it is. He wasn’t exactly sucking in when Draco was hovering over him on perfect biceps, rolling his narrow hips in the hottest pantomime of fucking ever to occur – no real reason to do it now. Still, Harry’s muscles and shame don’t seem to agree.
“You going for a dip?”

“You’re gorgeous.” The words spill out of Harry’s mouth. He has to fight not to apologize for them. Draco opens his eyes, pins Harry in their sights.
Harry thinks he ought to look away, ought to give them both the space they need to come down from this fever dream of a night. He should go back upstairs, pretend to be asleep by the time Malfoy returns to bed. But he doesn’t. He stays where he is, rooted to the chair, gripping the Invisibility Cloak folded in his lap, and watches Malfoy.
“Sorry,” he mumbled, though he
“Proposing?” he echoed, latching onto the word and ignoring the rest of Hermione’s question. “She said she thought I’d be
Snape nodded, “Yes, however, Alison and Adrian Avery are enslaved, the children of Aria and Lionel Avery.”
Draco smiles nodding, as she got up grabbing her coat.
“From what I know, the Lestranges, Bellatrix Black, Regulus Black, the Carrows, Lucius Malfoy, and I’m sure a few others and silent supporters are helping them” Theo said as he eyed the pumpkin pie. Harry smiled as he grabbed another slice putting whip cream on the side and handed it to him.
Harry smiled gently to Narcissa who gave a small smile back gently guided a distressed Lucius into a small room.
Remus sighs as his eyes water up a little, “I….I would like to find love. It’s…it’s pretty hard considering these nasty scars on my face.” Draco feels his heart break. He read many romance novels and he always believed that there is a soulmate out there for everyone.
