“I don’t agree with that, Mr. Malfoy,” Potter said. I tensed. Potter hearing this was not the best idea; it had only been by his conviction that we were reformed to which we owed our freedom and our comfortable life. “This ‘way of life’ doesn’t need to involve lording over the Muggles with the idea that they’re lesser.”
I wondered Potter and I had reached a stage in our acquaintance where I could ask. It was personal, but we had – kissed – and didn’t that give me the right?
“I’m not just looking at regular historical artifacts, father,” I said. “I’m looking at Dark Objects.  They’re dangerous and needs careful handling.” As you very well know, I wanted to add.
“I do remember there was an article published in my father’s magazine about it,” she continued slowly. “I don’t remember the details, but the gist was that there’s a secret society after it. They’re part of a conspiracy since the medieval times that seeks to influence Magical society to their pureblood agenda and will not let anyone get in their way.”
I glanced at Potter. I wasn’t sure if it were Potter’s presence or my father just felt recalcitrant today, but this approach wasn’t working.
I took out the bottled memory and set it on the table. McGonagall squinted at it with an academic’s interest.
“You’re always welcome to visit, too, Mr. Potter. How did you suddenly come by your interest in history?”
I took a deep breath and steeled myself as I touched the surface of the Pensieve. It rippled, and suddenly I was falling, falling –
“It is my house,” Potter replied mildly. Whatever shock or embarrassment that he had must have faded, and he leaned back against his chair, looking at me with a cocky expression. “Besides, you’re usually sleeping about now. Why are you up?”
“I’m not worried about that!” Potter all but exploded. He twisted the fabric of the couch in frustration. “I’m worried about your safety.”
“None, but some need a change of underpants.” Finnegan grinned at Harry. “Only two of them, sir? Surely the great Harry Potter doesn’t need our help taking only two down.”
“I can have you arrested for this, you know,” Dawlish said, lips pressed tight. “Trespassing is a crime. And you, Potter, you’ll be facing an internal review –”
Harry spat out flecks of blood. “You’re not so tough, only beating up someone who can’t fight back —”
“Of course we’re not alright, you bloody fool,” Grey Eyes snapped. “You could have killed us. Why couldn’t you have activated that car’s control chip earlier?”
“I’ll have you know my hair is perfectly fine,” Potter said with wounded pride. “Yours, on the other hand, has a leaf in it.”
“No ….” Granger looked at me, her face unreadable. “You’re making a lot of sense. But I don’t think we should be having our conversation in the middle of the hallway. Let’s move this to my office.”
I didn’t ask why, though it’s a common belief that the stronger the blood ties, the more powerful the magic was.
The irony of a historian trying to run from history … But didn’t I take up its study to impose my will on it? To shape its understanding, and in some ways, discipline myself to endure it. I inclined my head at Dennis.
Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was making fun of him again. Eleven thousand galleons was an absolute fortune, when a ranking Ministry official earned perhaps three hundred per annum and a flat in the fashionable part of central London was three thousand.
Finally, Harry said, “Let me indulge my curiosity. I promise you: if I don’t find anything suspicious in three days, I’ll close the case.”
“What do you want from me so that you’ll stop hurting Harry?” Draco asked, tamping down his revulsion.
“I’m not going to hide while you put yourself in danger,” Draco said angrily. “At the very least, let me defend myself. I don’t want to see you hurt because of me.”
It certainly looked it. The gears were cleared of the barnacles and rust that had encrusted the device when Draco last saw it, and the metal fairly shone, like it had been polished. It was still, however, the clockwork-like parts of the Decoder unmoving.
He had achieved much in this life, he freely acknowledged that. He had slowed the march of degenerates around the world through necessary means. But as always, the work of the virtuous was never complete, and it was time to step from the shadows. Secrecy and subtlety were all very well, but at times, a frontal assault was needed. A display of power.
“The audio will be off, so we won’t eavesdrop,” Riddle said, with the confidence of someone convinced he had already won. “There’s only one entrance to this room, by the way. Bella and Dolohov will be guarding it, so there’s no need to be foolish.” He called to Wormtail. “Let us go prepare the lab for Draco’s inspection.”
Dolohov froze, the instinct to pull the trigger warring with his orders to keep the Shield safe. Draco was impressed by how obedient Dolohov was to his directive.
Oh. It was my turn to flush. “It’s fine,” I said, affecting a nonchalance that clashed with a skip of my pulse. “It’s easier than me bringing them out for you to look.”
The admission coming from Harry somehow warmed Draco better than the gloves he wore, though Harry’s mouth twisted in the semblance of having tasted a lemon.
They were in a cave. It was clear that this was used as a hideout, evidently had been for some time. Draco had no idea where they were, his grip on the geography of the desert vanishing the moment he felt the gun.
My jaws clenched. But Potter seemed genuine in his sympathy. It probably was a poor display, especially compared to what he must be used to, with the Weasley and his friends. I forced myself to relax. “I should be the one to apologize to you. I didn’t expect my father would forget his manners so easily … but you being you, I suppose some leeway should be given.”
“Why couldn’t you have stayed with a museum or something instead of competing with criminals in this treasure hunt?” he had asked sourly. “I hope you know, but archaeologists don’t do adventures like these anymore. If they ever did.” Then he had made Draco promise to be careful, not do anything ridiculous or dangerous.
I rubbed my eyes blearily. So far – nothing. I knew it was early yet, but it was disheartening, particularly as I only had the faintest idea of what I should be looking for.
“And I trust you followed all the procedures, yes? Transmitted a cease order to them and tried to cut off their chip?”
“I had no idea that the Ministry would allow a family like Malfoys to hold so many important patents,” Harry mused.
“You can’t bargain with me, boy,” Greyback said, smiling that feral smile of his. “But if you get on my … good side … then I’ll consider your proposal.”
“It’s the only way I can think of.” Draco was frustrated that Harry couldn’t see the value of what Draco was doing – or even the value in saving Harry’s own life. Delay was all that they had; they were outgunned and outmanned, and there was no way to summon reinforcements.
“They live here?” Draco recognized the area they were in as one of the outlying suburbs of Greater London. Rows of semi-detached houses lined a quiet, leafy boulevard. “I thought they lived in one of those trendy, gentrifying areas somewhere in East London.”
He turned to face a gaping Draco. Harry had not changed much in all these years. Even with so much time past, the mere sight of him still left Draco’s knees weak – though this time, it was from a heady potion of anger and pain rather than desire. But that was in the mix too, an unwelcome heat rising from his belly, the urge to touch Harry again.
I can put in a request to the Bureau of Traffic in the Department of Transportation, Hedwig said. But it would likely take a few days to clear, even with high priority.
“I think you know more than you might be aware of,” Shacklebolt said, not ungently. His eyes were sympathetic, and that grated almost as much. “We’ve been monitoring this group’s communications and we’ve managed to decrypt a certain segment of it. Has your father mentioned anything about a ‘Shield of Achilles’?”
I managed to angle my wand and whispered a muttered spell. The books on the shelves behind him jumped out, attacking Cross. They were heavy volumes, in the style of Victorian doorstoppers. Some hit him on the head, others aimed for his legs and the rest of the body with a rush of pages flapping.
“There’s a file on the man’s console that I want to take a look at back at the office,” Harry said. “It’s encrypted in a way that SI can’t break easily.” That was the most surprising; despite Harry’s ribbing, Sentient Intelligence was in Harry’s experience one of the most efficient and effective cryptographers.
It was eerie to be in a lobby of glass and marble at night. The distorted reflections in the sleek surfaces shimmered like some otherworldly portal, beckoning one to look into a grotesque version of himself. Noises echoed, twisted and elongated by the sheer acoustics and by the lack of the usual chatter. It was a place where a hushed whisper stretched long and loud until it lost its own identity.
His hand came, unexpectedly, on my shoulder. I noticed just now that there was a tea set on the bedside table. Evidently Kreacher the house-elf had come and gone with it.
“That’s our Harry,” Fudge cried, clapping Harry heartily on the shoulder. Harry knew Fudge was probably thinking of ways to claim credit somehow at tomorrow’s presser. “We can definitely count on you to keep our streets safe at night.”
I touched my wand to Potter’s chest. A rush of vertigo hit me. I fought the black spots in my vision as the spell’s effect took.
“I was trying to file an incidence report with the Aurors,” I admitted. “But they told me no one was available to see me and I had to make an appointment.”
I stifled a cry – it burned – heat attacked my hand, and I felt the skin rending and curling into a crisp –
She gave a little hiccup. The look she gave me, though, was entirely too sharp for someone who was several drinks in. “It’s not my business to answer,” she said. “For both your questions.”
“What about my father’s papers?” Draco wondered what he had just agreed to. On the face of it, it didn’t seem much different than if someone invited Draco to his estate and assess the heirlooms. But uneasy nerves unsettled his stomach.
“What do you mean ‘can’t be communicated over the Web’? Our lines are the most secured out of all the Ministry.”
How did he not know about this? How was it that Draco had to find out his father was under criminal investigation from a Weasley, of all people? His father – his own father – had said nothing.
Defeated, Harry let out a huff before sinking down onto the frigid castle floor and reaching into his robes for the Marauder’s Map in one swift motion. He pulled out the still blank, folded piece of rectangular parchment. Pressing his wand so that the parchment wrinkled under his pressure, Harry muttered the familiar oath,
“Enough!” Harry shouted and the glasses that had somehow managed to remain on his face began to creep annoyingly down his hid nose bridge.
For a moment, Harry felt he ought to say something else to Malfoy, an apology, an explanation, or anything else really, but that moment passed, and he turned on his heal towards the Hospital Wing’s entrance.
Then, he was standing before the Hospital Wing. The field had disappeared along with the figure, replaced by the ordinary and comfortable corridors. After a deep and unsteady breath, he entered.
He barged clumsily into the boy’s dormitory where Ron laid casually strung across his bed, flipping through the latest edition of
“Er, hello. Look,” Harry sighed inwardly at Malfoy’s unbridled anger, “I wanted to apologize. Properly that is.”
Madam Pomfrey glanced up from where she and Hermione had been standing and fixed him with an icy stare. She lifted the skirt of her burgundy healer’s uniform and hurried over to Harry and usher him towards a freshly made bed further from the door.
and flicked his wand towards uncombed blond hair, hoping to demand answers from a restrained Malfoy, but Malfoy blocked this jinx and raised his wand for another—
“Well, along with being his usual arsehole self, he,” Harry trailed off, choosing his next words deliberately, “I think he wants me to stop him… If that makes sense.”
“Is there any truth to them?” She smirked and cocked an eyebrow, and Harry suspected she already knew the answer to that question.
In the time it took to appariate, Malfoy had reeled around into an uncompromising stance with his wand aimed at Harry. While Harry instinctively dove to his left and whipped his wand out of his pockets in a fluid motion. Malfoy’s hex landed where Harry had been standing not even a second ago, leaving an ashy mark across the stone wall. In response, Harry thought
“A hotel? They might come after us there. Not to mention we’re driving a car that’s been shot at and I have bloodstains all over me. Not mine,” Draco added hastily at the squawk on the other end of the phone.
“So come with me,” I said. “You watch my back, I’ll watch yours. But you know Granger’s right. This might be the only chance we get to see what Cross is up to.”
There was also the death of a Muggle man in a small village in Somerset that had not made Wizarding news. I only knew of it because I had caught a glimpse of the headline screaming about the goriness of it on some Sunday tabloid.
We followed each other out, biding my parents goodnight as we parted. I led Potter to the gardens through the double French door. It hit with a breeze of fresh air after being inside for so long.
“You have a lot of nerve, Mr. Malfoy, for someone who might be an informant to ask for favors.” Fletcher had not shifted from his position next to Draco.
“They have,” Metis’ voice came through the intercom. “Some more than once. Nothing stands out about their visits, however.”
Dolohov smiled at Draco. It was more chilling than any threat. “I suppose you won’t have the opportunity to repeat the information to anyone.” He glanced at Harry. “You or your friend.”
Despite the glorious day, a chill descended in the room. What he had just told me beggared all belief. To break a sacred part of yourself into bits – I turned away from Potter, appalled. To think that my family and I had been in thrall to such a man, if he could even be called a man. It was more than the megalomania, the wanton killing, the genocidal tendencies and his emphasis on blood purity. It was ….
The hallway was deserted and dusty. It reminded me in a way of the disused corridors of the Manor, with its air of dilapidated neglect. Unlike the Manor, this lacked the grandeur of bygone days. Thick carpet lined the floor and faded wallpaper covered the walls.
“My father’s reformed,” I snapped. “He’s not a Death Eater anymore.” He’s not that reformed, a voice in my head whispered. He’s just had to accept a new reality in which he no longer has the power to enact his ideals.
“We’re here, boys.” The cheerful voice of the driver cut like a blast of mortar. “Home away from home.”
“Wouldn’t that have automatically set up an alert?” Harry asked. “Access to the Underground is highly restricted.”
There was silence. Then: “Would advise against that. There are three unmarked cars in front of the house, and it appears they all have men inside. It might be innocuous but the fact that you were just shot at, and that there are three occupied vehicles where you’re planning to go can’t be a coincidence.”
They still needed to air out their issues, Draco knew, but it was a solid step on the road to reconciliation.
Blaise was regaling us with tales of his models’ ridiculous behavior and outrageous demands. He was a highly sought-after photographer now, after a successful stint as a model. I tuned in absentmindedly to a story of an up-and -coming model who demanded peacocks in his dressing room because they “were soothing to look at”. I stifled my snort. Peacocks soothing? Pah. Sounded much different from the ones I grew up with at the Manor. They were fiercely territorial; they used to chase me around the grounds when I was young until I called for the house-elves.
“Do not speak so disparaging of Godric, my young apprentice,” Slytherin said, and although his tone was light, I heard the menace. The acolyte silenced. “He was once my friend, and a powerful wizard besides. You will do well to remember that. Especially as you carry forth my plans.”
Harry and I wanted to host this partly to gauge how well our respective friends could mix. With the exception of the irate Pansy, they seemed to get along. At the very least, no fistfights had broken out. Yet.
He stood up, cracking his neck, when Harry noticed a distorted shape. It was pressed to the driver’s neck, angled so that anyone passing by the window would miss it. It was only by the good fortune of the traffic cam’s angle that Harry managed to spot it at all.
The proximity was too much – Draco leaned in, his lips making contact with Harry before Draco even registered his body was moving.
“Well,” Harry said, “I just wanted to say thank you. For running in the way you did, even though it was idiotic. And thank you for being here, for being a part of this.”
He and Harry occupied a pole to the corner. Harry spent much of the time thumbing Draco’s arse whenever the train lurched. Draco didn’t have the heart to order Harry, to stop. He tried to demonstrate his irritation, though, by pressing his own back into Harry at the earliest opportunity to push Harry’s hands away. Somehow, Harry didn’t seem to get the message.
“This place is creepier than the Forbidden forest,” Harry whispered. “I wonder what kind of creatures live in here.”
“We kept the flat off limits to everyone since we called your office,” he said. His eyes darted between the two of them. “No one has been to the flat except for me.”
“Why do you turn away from me?” He spoke quietly, his voice barely louder than a whisper, and yet it reverberated throughout the entire cave. It seemed to rock my very bones.
“Yes,” the man —  Slytherin — said. “You feel its power. It’s yours if you accept your heritage. You want it, don’t you? You crave what it offers. Not just magical power, but the sense of achievement, the recognition that will follow.”
“There’s nothing here.” I was disappointed. I had hoped for at least something – a few cursed lamps, at least. “The magical signature must have been from dark rituals or something.”
“I believe that,” Harry said. “But it’s also possible that you didn’t know who you were selling to. You said yourself that the buyer was anonymous, right?”
Seeing the unmarked book hit me with such relief that I nearly collapsed to the floor. If it had fallen into that man’s hands … I had no idea who he was, but it was obvious he wanted this book – and what I knew about it. Ironic, as it had only been yesterday since I discovered it.
Leaves crunched. His face smarted from the icy blast of wind. But Draco didn’t stop. He was almost there – if he took even a second’s break, he would lose the two men. They had answers, he had questions. He had questions ever since his parents’ crash.
“I’ll be starting with the household ledgers in the library. Then maybe the catalogues and some of the older reference books and house records. Maybe some of our ancestors’ journals.”
Draco signed. He never carried over a hundred pounds in cash. He dropped the bills in front of Fletcher.
“I’m guessing the victims you’re investigating came down here for personal reasons. Most likely, to enjoy themselves.”
What I needed was a cold shower and a hard fap when I get home. And a good cup of coffee. Maybe tonight I’ll call Blaise again. That itch needed scratching. Again.
Malfoy was impeccably coiffed and attired, his sleek blond hair reflecting the colors, and while he wasn’t dressed as formally as Harry had seen him last in evening wear, Malfoy was still in a slim suit showing off his lean build.
But maybe Harry didn’t have an undercover role. After all, he was parading around the base with nary a precaution. Draco had watched as Harry exchanged a brief joke with an officer, clapped a private comradely on the back. Harry appeared well-liked here.
I could imagine him chuckling as he slipped a finger in my hole, holding me tight so I didn’t thrash uncontrollably from the mix of pain and pleasure. I groaned. Fuck, I was close. My own erection strained hard for attention as I continued to jerk, the warm water a small recompense for the lack of warmth from another’s attention.
Or maybe Draco was being too fanciful and imagined these noises. After all, he hadn’t been able to sleep without a valium for a long time now, which he invariably forgets to pack every time he leaves London.
“He is,” Harry said. He couldn’t help but give Malfoy a fond look. “I think so too.” Harry by all accounts should be nervous, but he wasn’t. Not with Malfoy helping.
As he went off, Draco stood still. He found himself rooted to the floor, his mind buzzing too furiously to think.
“Mr. Potter, you don’t think we all use each other in some way, every day? Consciously or not, we’re all each other’s playthings. Can you say with certainty you’ve never used dear Draco over there?”
Worry displayed on the young private’s face. “We can send a team in after him, but all our available ones are on other missions right now, and the latest one of them will arrive back will be in half an hour. We have no men to go after him.”
Harry supposed it was natural that men like McLaggen, hot-blooded and eager for recognition, were drawn to this branch of the National Security Department. He couldn’t imagine McLaggen as an Unspeakable working in the Department of Mysteries, unable to boast of even the smallest success. It would be a special hell for him, Harry reflected with grim humor.
“And you think my club has something to do with it?” Malfoy raised a neat eyebrow. “Dead patrons aren’t really good for business, you know.”
Then I came, the milky seed spilling into my bathwater, and I fell back against the rim of the bathtub, my tension loosened and my headache much relieved.
“Friend ….” Malfoy echoed. His eyes were bright as they met Harry’s. “Well, ‘friend’, what are you going to do after I tell you? Run away? Let your Auror self take over? Try to save me? What happened in the past should stay in the past.”
“Thanks for the unqualified praise,” I said dryly, settling down beside him. “But in all seriousness, give me more time to think about it, okay?” He really was wearing down my resolve.
“I resent that.” Draco scowled at Harry. “I tipped very generously, I’ll have you know. Every time.”
It was slightly displeasing for Draco that Fletcher mistook him as one of these scraps, however. Pressed suits and soft hands didn’t necessarily mean a soft man; Draco wondered if this experience would impress that lesson on Fletcher.
“Listen to me,” Harry continued earnestly, “this might be related to the drug proliferation. You can’t possibly be unaware of that, can you? And the deaths of Unspeakables related to this top-secret Ministry project with our SIs – this is bigger than you or me. I know you dislike and distrust the Ministry, especially after the way it conducted itself after Voldemort’s coup, but we need your help on this.”
“Ahh … sorry about that, Commander Potter,” Goyle said, his body swaying. “I know you lot don’t drink. Aurors are so boring.”
Draco didn’t believe the first words that slipped out of his tongue were those. Harry blushed and Finnegan looked as if he might burst out laughing.
He watches them sleep, their faces so peaceful in repose. The stench of sweat and sex fill the room, and Cross cannot help but wrinkle his nose.
Harry said as much, though in a much more concerned tone than the voice which spoke to Draco in his head.
Harry fired at the car again, meeting the green beam that issued from the car. Colors clashed, warring with each other and setting off radioactive reactions that left the air scorched.
“What?” My mouth fell open. I must look like a fish. I had fantasized about it, but there was a reason why it was a fantasy.
Harry didn’t live Underground. Nor did he wish to. He had ambitions, dreams which were yet unfulfilled, and if he had to defer his personal nature, or at the very least be unobtrusive, then so be it.
She gave a startled sound as she stopped, staring at me. She remained mostly relaxed, however, eyeing me with my wand out more as an exotic sight than a threat. Undoubtedly, she had unseen Shields and other magical protection invisible to the eye around her; most high-ranking Ministry officials did nowadays, since the War.
Where was Harry in all of this? Draco’s heart hammered so loudly he was almost surprised no one heard him.
Harry moved, elbowing Bellatrix in the stomach, his other hand snatching the gun out of Dolohov’s hand.
A corner of his mouth quirked. “Hello to you too.” Then, remembering himself, he pushed his office door open. “After you.”
“We can’t pretend like we’re working for one of the banks or whatever companies that are in there,” Draco said. “We’re not even in suits.”
Goyle had been part of Draco’s little clique, both being of the same Hogwarts House and the same age. He was one of the few Draco kept in touch with, though it mostly was limited to contracting for the Manor’s repairs.
I raised my wand. Light fell on the rough trail that led deeper into the darkness. “I hope mostly squirrels,” I said, though there was no conviction in my voice. The forest was old and abandoned, and I wondered why it was so clearly marked on a Muggle map. Perhaps we should have gone to stay at a Wizarding inn. The habitues there would have had more information on this clearly magical place.
“My sympathies, Potter.” And Malfoy did appear as though he meant it. “Though in my experience, sometimes having parents isn’t the glorious experience others portray. At least from my perspective.”
“Do you really think so?” Draco’s eyes were cold. “I think you’ve gotten the impression that we’re not the kind who makes idle threats.”
Gradually, in what seemed like a lifetime, Draco untangled from the knot of terror. He still gripped Harry’s hand so fiercely it would’ve broken a lesser man’s. Harry didn’t even flinch.
“I was expecting him much earlier.” It was a simple statement with no reproach, but a shudder made its way around the room regardless.
When he came out, Granger was holding a handgun distastefully but professionally, and both Ron and Harry carried rifles. Not the type that one used in hunting, but the type soldiers carried on the battlefield. Like the ones Draco had seen not so long ago in the deserts of Afghanistan.
A soft pop sounded as a decrepit house-elf materialized, wearing a filthy dishrag for a loincloth. He bowed low to Potter.
“Ah … well, you would have done the same for me,” Draco said, embarrassed. He had moved instinctively, without considering the consequences. It wasn’t something that needed to be lauded for.
“We – we’re contacting all the experts we could find, master,” Wormtail stuttered. “We have to be careful about who we trust with the information, after what happened with Lucius. And it’s been difficult approaching these academics, since none have the cachet that the Malfoy name used to have. It’s hard to find any professors these days that want to consult for unknown projects, particularly on what they consider fringe theories.”
Everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. The alcohol was free-flowing, the food appearing from the kitchen as soon as a plate was emptied. Granger and Weasley were chatting with another one of Harry’s friends, Goyle and Millicent huddled in a corner looking as though they were the only two who existed in the world, and Blaise was flirting outrageously with a thoroughly drunk Pansy.
“We still might have gotten there faster with a military plane,” Harry said, examining the glassware. “This feels … I don’t know, but should we be doing this?”
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes and looked around the room. Everything appeared in order. There was nothing that appeared immediately out of place; Harry could spend some time exploring, but he was reluctant to be more intrusive than was necessary.
Luna cocked her head at me. “A journalist never reveals her sources, Draco. Though in this case I’m not the journalist, and I actually don’t know. But it’s a thrilling tale, isn’t it? Lost magical books, ancient societies and conspiracies, a love story blossoming. Oh! That reminds me.” She handed me a white envelope. “I wasn’t originally planning to come to the party, but this came for you, and I thought might as well enjoy some free food and booze while I make my delivery.”
“Thank you.” Draco took up the paper, placing it lightly over the Decoder. He began to trace over the imprints with the pencil.
He looked at Harry. Harry was relaxed, face ruddy from the wind. He showed no other signs of the climate affecting him. Draco guessed Harry was used to much more extreme conditions than this.
“What’s this?” I opened it. Lying on satin stained with age was a pair of platinum cufflinks set with small sapphires. I looked at Harry. He had an air of a bashful child giving his first Christmas gift. “You didn’t need to buy me anything.”
‘This is just one of the little ‘tricks’ we have left. There are more awaiting you should you find the Grimoire for us. But … you’ll have to prove yourself willing to help us too.’ The man produced another scroll. ‘Here is a list of ones we want dead. We want you to kill them for us. They will become your enemies eventually too, so another happy collaboration between us.’
He had called about the latest article in Enchantress Express, breathlessly reporting our latest escapades. This time, an intrepid photojournalist had somehow managed to slip in, and pictures of harried Harry and a sated me winking at the camera proliferated like the plague. It had done wonders for my career, the new publicity — I received more inquiries through my agent from publishers than ever. I guess sex sells, even for history books.
“Oh.” Potter fell back, disappointed. “But I take it you know about the links the Circle has with it.”
Draco made to go after them but the ladder was already out of reach. Dolohov too, had already sped away.  He didn’t even bother to look back.
“It’s not that bad,” Draco conceded. He knew that along with the filth, being in this place stirred unwelcome memories in Harry. “There’s a lot of interesting objects in here. I feel some of my coworkers at Christie’s will definitely want to pay a visit sometime.”
“It isn’t any of your business,” I said, unfathomably irritated by his fixation on Blaise. I knew he had an effect on people, and Potter was only human, but still – I had expected him to be more resistant.
“Well … I suppose an arrangement could be made,” I said slowly. “But only if you grant me unfettered access to the Grimoire. And of course, we need to discuss my compensation.”
“That’s too much of a coincidence,” Harry said. Definitely too much of a coincidence. “Is there anything else linking them? Aside from the facts that we just discussed.”
The Circle was still active, though, a voice quietly reminded me. Cross is or was not the only member. And now you’re one of the targets.
“You’re such a tease, Draco,” he said. He pushed me over, his hands twitching on my thighs as he mouthed kisses down from my neck. One hand held my hips in place as the other pulled at my erection.
“You two are possibly the worst agents I have ever encountered,” Dawlish told them. “Breaking into one of the most prestigious buildings in London in the middle of the night and getting the police to arrest you? What part of secret do you not understand?”
Draco didn’t roll his eyes, though it was a close call. “I think you know by now how stubborn I am.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “And now do you see why I came to you? I can’t match the acquisition budget of museums; my spending doesn’t come with charitable tax breaks. I need a source that’s relatively low key compared to the usual means of buying these items.”
He laughed. “No, thank you. I have a thick head, but I don’t think having a pillow thrown at me is high on a list of things I fancy.”
I shook my head. “It’s a mixed residential property. There’s a wizarding building management that I pay rent to.”
“I had,” Riddle said. “But the delay would have taken too long to find another expert to decipher the Decoder. Wormtail,” here he gave Wormtail a glare, “failed to find any other who would be able to assist us in breaking the encryption.”
“It is,” Draco confirmed. “Lots of marble statues and jewelry and coin. Oh and don’t think of selling of them illegally,” Draco said sternly. “It’s a small world; I’ll hear of it if you do.”
Potter shook his head. “I’m alright. I’ll let you rest.” Then, quick as a flash, he kissed me on the cheek.
I settled on a middle approach and said nothing further. I watched his face. It had a curious play of impassivity. I knew it was a façade – I had adopted the same one many times in the past. Curious … it suggested he knew something about it.
They had been at the office for hours now. Harry’s eyes were blurry with fatigue from staring at the screen and, next to him, Finnegan let out a loud yawn.
“Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa are waiting for the young masters Draco and Potter,” the house elf waiting for us squeaked. “If you will follow me, the dinner is in the Small Room.”
Draco was about to respond with a negative when his emotional walls broke. It had been battened since the moment he had saw the Dolohov and – what was that man’s name? Something about a worm – in his father’s study, and even more when he saw Harry again. But now the screws were coming loose and Draco didn’t know if he would be able to stem the wave of emotion threatening to overwhelm him.
It was exhilarating, to be free in the tumult above London, to look down and see the dots of figures moving, the buildings fiery with life, to watch and swoop down like an avenging angel.
“I’m not, actually.” A new idea sprang to mind. Now that Harry was here, his presence could be of some use. “We just want some information from you. I promise we will make it worth your while.”
“Yes. Lucius’ son. Draco Malfoy. He is, I believe, currently an appraiser with Christie’s, though he has some field experience as an archaeologist working with the UNESCO task force in Iraq in 2003.”
They arrived at the Manor in Harry’s car, Harry deciding it was much more secure to use that mode of transportation than taking the train.
She nodded. “So far, it’s only been rumors and conjecture. We have nothing solid yet. And there’s evidence that their network reaching deep into all parts of Wizarding society.”
“Turn right,” he said sharply when they came to a junction in the hallway. “Be quick about it. The master doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”
“Stay down,” Harry mouthed at them. He peered through the curtains. His action was met instantly by a hail of bullets that clattered against the bulletproof glass.
They looked through several more crates. Draco was struck dumb by the impressive array of artifacts. The ones in this room must have been the culmination of years of work. Once again, his self-control almost snapped. So much pillaging and looting, and it was clear that the ones who did so gave no damn. Draco saw the marks of careless handling like scars on these objects – they were only out to enrich themselves at the expense of their collective heritage. It would be one matter if these were being sold by those who would starve otherwise. But the money would be going to those who beheaded anyone that flouted their narrow views of their universe, people who used the funds raised from the sales to kill Draco’s own countrymen.
Harry’s sight changed. It now took the perspective of a single, anonymous traffic cam, on in thousands, in Covent Garden. It showed a single hovercar, old and dilapidated, one among many. The car sped along in the air, following the breakneck pace set by the traffic grid.
He glanced at Granger ruefully. “Guess you did take all precautions. I have to say I am rather impressed. You did think of all the angles. Except for one.”
He would know if there were interactions between the Death Eaters and an even more shadowy group that pulled the strings from behind. Or at least, be sensitive to whispers of it.
But my father was right; I couldn’t do as I pleased anymore. This episode had shown me that. I was the Malfoy heir, the last of my family. And tried as I did to hide from them, the responsibilities there were real – and onerous. I stared at the water running down the tiles. My parents would not be alive forever to shoulder them for me. I realized that now. I had a future that the serendipity of genes had mapped out for me.
Harry almost collided with a couple tangled in each other in his distracted state. He muttered a quick apology, trying not to notice the angry glances they threw his way. He couldn’t get the image of Malfoy lounging out of his head.
Once again, I was left wondering how long until I could wash off the stink of my past. Judging by her behavior. Life had improved tremendously for our lot, by which I meant the children of the former Death Eaters, I had to admit. And loathe was I to credit Potter and his lackeys, their actions and attitudes had made all the difference between hidden hostility and outright persecution.
“You’ve an advanced magical degree and Hermione is the cleverest witch in our generation. With your collective brainpower, I’m certain you two will find a solution in no time.”
“Oh.” Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. “You’re welcome.” He felt this was one of those moments he needed to be more expressive than that, but his foggy mind failed him.
Potter’s sympathetic expression folded in, into a mask of nonchalant cheer. It hit me with a pang at the loss of the rapport I was beginning to feel with him. I should have remembered Granger’s warning to ask gently.
“I – what – not hurt,” he stammered out. He choked air down his throat, breathing from the mouth so to not smell the blood. Belatedly, he realized his hand was sticking to the carpet. He pulled it up. It was slick and oily, the red already oxidizing into a darker color.
Leaning in as close as possible without touching, I examined it. … It was life-like, this world I entered. … Now that pain did not cloud my senses, I noticed that the book’s cover was green and emblazoned with an ouroboros, the symbol of infinity. Somewhere in the recess of my memory, a stirring ... I knew I had seen this before. Not the ouroboros — it was a common enough sight in alchemical texts — but this cover....
Simultaneously, Harry lashed out, catching the guard with a sweep that sent the man crashing to the ground. At the same time, Harry pushed himself forward, contorting to grab a small knife that Draco hadn’t noticed was on the ground before. Keeping one foot firmly on the guard’s chest, Harry cut through his bonds.
So this was fun to write. I began this as a project to practice writing consistently within a deadline. I'm proud to say I managed to stay mostly on schedule. I did post without editing or revisions, so I imagine I would need to go back later and do that. B
“Is that your usual routine? Dinner, followed by drinks and a night at a club?” Harry asked curiously. His tone suppressed an emotion Draco wasn’t sure he was able to identify properly.
Potter actually laughed at that. Growling, I grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the fireplace. “We’re going to be late. I’ll see you later, Blaise.”
“Really? Then you don’t like this?” He bit me rather sharply on the edge of my collarbone. I writhed. “Or this?” He moved his hand to pull back my hair, exposing my neck as he moved up, his erection in my face, almost thrusting in my mouth.
“Come with us, Draco,” he said. He fended off a jet of red from Potter. I strained against his Body-bind, my fingers flexing on the handle of my wand. If I could only aim it ….
“You shouldn’t doubt my competence. But my good intentions?” Malfoy barked a short, sharp laugh. “If you haven’t figured it out after thirty years of living in this world, Potter, you should realize that none of us have good intentions.”
“You know,” I said, trying to affect a nonchalant musing even as his mouth worked magic, “I always wanted to try those Auror fantasy roleplays. Something about a man in uniform—” I shuddered as his hands squeezed my cock and he bit me lightly on my earlobe.
His knowing gaze trapped me. His words struck a chord, even as I saw them for the ploy they were. The truth hits home, no matter if it is merely a lever used for manipulation.
“Nah.” Theo waved his hand. “I haven’t heard from this one until two days ago when he called out of the blue asking for a boat. ‘It’s a good thing you picked the off-season’, I told him, since it’s still kind of cold this time of year.” He gave them both a look. “This isn’t some exotic vacation you two have planned, is it?”
“Harry can help you. He taught all of us how to duel.” She gave me a small smile. “He told me you hired him.”
Rosa gave an understanding smile. “I understand. You can call your partner in, then. I’ll give what’s left of your allotted time to him.”
“What?” Draco was confused by this non sequitur as he was by the coming headache. “What about them?”
Dolohov was already passed out on the floor, with what was going to be a nasty gash on his head. In the corner, Draco saw that Riddle, too, remained unconscious. The two remaining combatants, Harry and Bellatrix, were each behind makeshift barricades: Harry having used the long table in the center and Bellatrix huddling behind one of the smaller desks.
“Roughly a dozen. No more than fifteen in my line of sight,” reported Harry, doing the same. “We should secure the back too. They won’t be so stupid to forget that.”
“Of course,” I said. I raised my wand and casted a Shield around myself. “I should be good to do that.”
“My dear friends,” he said, calm and unaffected, “I don’t think we shall be seeing each other again. You can remember today as the day you almost caught me. Don’t be upset, Granger. It’s the closest anyone’s ever come so far.” He made a sardonic now.
I nearly spat out my wine. Potter, at a sex club? I think I needed more alcohol to get me through tonight.
Harry scowled. “Well, now that we settled that, we should probably get moving. We don’t have a lot of time to waste.”
“Yes,” Shacklebolt said. “That’s why we were so delayed coming here. There was more trouble there than expected. Apparently they thought you were going to head there instead.”
A loud blast erupted and the air itself choked all the air out of my lungs. The Manor was on fire – my home was burning –
“The Blood Circle,” my father said. “That’s what they call themselves.” He raised his wand and drew a circle in the air. Green sparks formed into an ouroboros, shining, above his desk. I stared at it. That was the emblem of the Grimoire that artist depictions usually included.
“I don’t know. We didn’t see who delivered it. It’s addressed to you, though. I reckon it might be a fan letter.”
I sat in one of the wooden chairs, watching the flow of people come and go. It was unlikely that I’d be attacked in the Ministry itself. Despite this, my fingers still danced nervously as I held onto my wand under my robes.
“This is the best I can do,” Metis said. “The jammer around the man will degrade the image if we zoom.”
Draco sat behind the Humvee, choking under the fumes, his nerves scrapped raw by every gunshot, every grunt. His imagination, blocked off from the pressure valve of sight, whirled into overdrive – he tried hard to press them out, to not picture the worst scenarios –
Draco pulled up a chair and took a handlamp from the side. The etched symbols were definitely not a figment of his imagination. He relaxed slightly in his chair.
“Seems like we’re going to have a talk at the office tomorrow about your following the regulations, Harry,” he said. “Or lack of.”
And was met with air as I was stopped halfway. There was an invisible barrier around the bed that blocked me from leaving.
Harry didn’t answer. He looked out the window, at the silhouette of the Shard outlined in the setting sun.
“WE are doing nothing. YOU are going to stay somewhere safe while I try to figure this out.” Granger nodded at her men, who carried the librarian out of my flat. She glanced at Potter. “Can you keep an eye on him?”
“He’s going to miss breakfast at this rate,” I said. I did not particularly want to dwell on what my mother said. “Should we have an elf fetch him?” I did not particularly want that either, but I would be a poor host if I let my guest starve.
The Manor, true to Granger’s word, was mostly undamaged, though the smell of smoke still hung in the air, mostly thank to poor ventilation. Luckily, there were no char marks or any observable traces of the fire that Cross had caused. If I had not been there, I would have almost been unable to tell. The stacks of books I left were still there.
“Galleon for your thoughts,” Blaise murmured, sliding into the seat next to me. Across from us, Milly and Goyle were in their own little world.
“I didn’t,” he said, looking embarrassed. “I found it while I was cleaning out your room in Grimmauld Place. I thought it would look good on you. You wear suits better than I do.”
Oh, what the hell. I grabbed Harry by his lapels in for a more thorough kiss that had the half the room staring. Someone wolf-whistled.
My footsteps echoed with loud clacks on the marble floor. I had always admired women’s high heels that clicked when they walked; the sound was, to me, an audible evidence of power.
Dolohov’s head poked through. “You’re dawdling,” he said with a cold sneer. “Better hurry up. It’s pointless to delay the inevitable.”
Goyle burst out into laughter. “Really? Try multiplying that by a hundred and you might have a better sense of the population down here.”
But the Grimoire — Potter had proven that the Founders’ Heirlooms were real. Maybe this included the Grimoire.
“Oh, he never liked his greens,” my mother confided in a carrying whisper. “He always fed it to the hounds when he was young.”
“I wonder where their office will be,” Draco said thoughtfully. “Security will probably be tight, given all the multinationals headquartered here.”
“They’ll put you through a training course, most likely. I think the reason why they didn’t do it during this raid was because of the need for secrecy. But ordinarily, anyone who has a remote chance of being out on the field needs go to through it.”
Riddle stood up. He wore all black and it was like watching a shadow unfurl. He walked to the window. Through it, the Millennium Eye spun, the spokes gleaming in the night, and a little farther, Big Ben and the House of Parliament. London spread out before him, a field of gems that was ready to be plucked.
“The top is for tourists,” Draco said. “There’s a bar up there. Slightly overpriced and rather pretentious, but the view is amazing. After all, most people don’t really come here for the mixologists.”
“Well,” Draco admitted, “you do seem more prepared than you were before. Remember that trip we took to Brighton and you forgot your suitcase and we hand to turn back halfway?”
Harry rarely ever felt envious over material possessions, coming from the background he did, and understanding that the vast majority lived in circumstances far more penurious than Harry did. But Harry experienced a surge of anger that so many were starving and forced to seek shelter in the slums of Underground while men like Malfoy and Fudge pranced around in their finery.
“Oh, come on.” I said, aware I was close to whining like a child. “Give me a clue. I’m going to be dealing with the man. I need to know at least if he’s volatile and one wrong word could set him off faster than an Erumpent horn.”
“Who are you?” I managed out the words. My eyes struggled to focus; the figure wore a dark cloak that concealed his face and his entire body. The only part exposed was the outstretched hand holding the wand. Skeletal and pale, with squat fingers, it reminded me of a piece of bone.
Luna shook her head. “We scanned it beforehand. It’s clean. And I have to say, you’re getting paranoid.”
“It’s alright.” Blaise gave me a rueful grin. “I need to head out anyways. I have a shoot today. Mind if I use your shower?” He gave me an appreciative once-over. “Pity that our time’s cut short.”
“Can I ask you something personal?” Potter swirled his wine. “Why history, if you’re so afraid of the past? And why history of the dark arts? Doesn’t that field especially make it impossible to escape?”
Draco didn’t know how to respond. These men watched the Manor for five years without Draco ever noticing – nails dug into his palms at the anger of the violation. Burning in there too, was a rage at his father, for leaving yet another tangled knot of unhappiness for Draco to manage. By himself.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” said Harry, which sent Malfoy into another fit of rage as he descended upon Harry, jabbing bony fists, elbows, and knees everywhere he could reach. Of course, Harry was a bit more prepared this time, bringing his arms up to shield his head, he kicked outwards, landing one foot in Malfoy’s stomach who groaned loudly and rolled over clutching his sides.
“What else?” the girl leaned forward then slouched further backward when Harry stopped a foot or so away, “You not being able to attend today’s match stirred up quite a scandal, but you must be aware of that much. People are also gossiping about what caused your absence as well. Rather vile rumours if I do say so myself.”
“I’ve cursed Draco. I think he’s seriously hurt. Help him,” He frantically pleaded. Harry didn’t have to turn to know that Hermione was horrified by Harry’s claim. It was enough that she followed him silently towards the boy’s laboratory. Water almost completely engulfed the floor, glimmering lightly from the fire of the torches that lined the otherwise unoccupied corridor. As the pair trekked closer to the door, the water seemed to push against each step and splashes jumped in the air as they lifted their feet to take another.
Hermione sighed and carefully explained, “Look, Ron told me I had been too harsh on you, and I may have chosen my wording poorly; however, I don’t believe I was wrong.”
“Yes, sir.” Harry quickly moved to stuff a bent card to mark his progress and hurried to the door, anxious to escape the stuffy office and Snape who, along with the ever-increasing number of dead animal heads, was the obvious culprit.
“Oh, and the blonde one, I swear she was a second away from biting my head off for talking to the other one,” Harry chuckled at the memory.
Malfoy froze, his arms went limp, letting his wand slip from his weak grip, and he crumpled soundlessly to the now waterlogged floor. Harry unmoving watched Malfoy, uncertain of the true effect of the spell he had stupidly cast without first researching it. Then, he watched as dark, cranberry red liquid mixed with the water, of which Malfoy was submerged, to create wispy smoke that travelled in all directions, staining the floor with that wine-red colour.
Within the Hospital Wing, he could hear an argument break out between the two Slytherins, and while their voices grew heated, their volume remained low, most likely to not attract the attention of anyone lurking in the corridors. Harry quietly stood up and inched towards the door to better hear their conversation, curious about what topic could possibly cause infighting among the singular-minded friends. He peeked around the corner, seeing the unoccupied white beds he silently reminded him Madam Pomfrey placed Malfoy further into the room.
“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from somewhere out of sight, “Tell me what’s wrong... I can help you.”
“No, no, no, no, no, no,” Harry weakly murmured, brushing a deathly white strand of hair from Malfoy’s equally sickly face. “I didn’t mean to... I didn’t know.”
For a moment, the room had gone silent, then Harry heard footsteps hurriedly approaching where he stood still spying on the two Slytherins. Panicked and without many options, he returned to his original seat against the stone and pretended as if he had dozed off, thankfully before Pansy burst through the entryway. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Harry’s poor attempt to look as if he hadn’t been listening. Harry cracked an eye open and found Pansy glaring at him through silent tears that slipped out of the corners of her eyes.
Harry stared agape as her robes faded and bled into the dark corridor until she evaded his line of sight. He wanted to be angry, he wanted to be sad, and every emotion in between; however, Harry was just numb. Something was missing, it had to be. At last, he was alone. Alone in his own company, and within the past year it had grown to become the worst sort of company Harry could imagine. If he could choose, Harry would rather be paired off to duel with any number of Death Eaters. At the very least he could manage that task mindlessly. A pit tunnelled deep into Harry’s chest, although if he were to look down, he would see no such mark. The tunnel was cold and dark and numb and empty and devoid of everything that made him feel. It wasn’t as if all his happy memories had been stolen by the kiss of a Dementor. No, they were still very much intact, only dulled and worthless.
“Oh, my apologies,” said Malfoy in a fit of farce anger, “I was unaware we were all expected to adorn the mantel of the world’s saviour.”
Then, he was drawn from his confusing reveries when with a pathetic shudder, Malfoy raised his eyes to see his reflection in the mirror that hung cracked and dirtied above the sink. Stormy grey clashed with the brilliant green eyes of their nemesis, and Harry knew that Malfoy had finally noticed his intrusive presence.
“This is all happening,” Malfoy gestured wildly, speaking with a frantic tilt to his voice, “Given the state of things. Muggleborns—mudbloods—are a threat to us. They always have been. There’s nothing you or any—”
Hermione was waiting for him in the common room when Harry walked through the portrait hole. She looked weary in a way he had never seen her before as if she had spent a year trapped in the same room. “Oh Harry,” said Hermione, wrapping her arms around her sides in a self-soothing motion, “I won’t say ‘I told you so.”
“Which, naturally, startled you into defending yourself,” inserted Dumbledore, “However, I would hope you would retain the awareness that the use of such destructive magic is impermissible. Indeed, I had hoped to impress upon you the corrupt nature of the Dark Arts.”
Harry smiled faintly and shook his head at Seamus. Following Seamus’s invitation, Dean, Ron, and Neville glanced up and grinned broadly, obviously still caught up in whatever game they were playing. He had half-a-mind to join; however, they would be expected to attend Prefect duty soon enough, and resting before doing so sounded much more appealing. So, he continued to the boy’s dormitory.
Malfoy seemed to think over Harry’s words over. Then darted from the confines of his hospital bed, surprising Harry as a cold and bonelike hand wrapped around his wrist a pulled him back with more strength than what Malfoy should have possessed in his current state. Harry felt him pulling on it to lift himself up, palms and fingers chilled so that they felt as they had been scorched with an icy flame, and then he tugged upwards so that he was now hovering their arms in front of his face.
That is what she had said. Well, it certainly was ‘sooner.’ Too soon. He had wanted to discuss things privately with Ginny, to figure out their relationship, but it seemed Ron unknowingly would not allow them the opportunity. Many things would have been much simpler if Ron had just outright rejected any budding romance between him and Ginny. Including figuring out his own doubts.
Slowly, Hermione dramatically slogged across the red and golden carpet, and practically tackled one of the many vacant armchairs. Harry thought she had fallen asleep when Hermione responded, “I don’t want this war to go on forever. Pureblood families are intensely traditional, and I’ve always held the notion that people who cling so desperately to the concept of tradition are merely scared. Like many people, they’re scared because they were never exposed to anyone other than their immediate circle, and in this case it's muggleborns. Everyone else knows that blood lineage has no real impact on magical ability. And this stupid conflict continues because purebloods view muggleborns as outsiders, and muggleborns view purebloods as bigoted, which they definitely are. So, the proper way to do away with awful traditions is to show their scapegoat isn’t all that threatening. That’s why.”
of your schoolbooks. Do make sure to not leave any of them behind. I shall discuss your punishment with Dumbledore, and know that you’ll be lucky if I don’t—”
“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!”
“Alright then,” said Ron, eyeing the three like he had expected for a duel to commence at any second, “Try to save your fists fights until we’ve a big enough audience to wager… Though, s’pose with my lucky streak, I’d probably lose a few galleons by myself,” he rambled on, thoughtfully, “So, best separate ‘fore that happens.”
“Mister Potter, I would say I’m quite thrilled about your visit; however, next time I would like you to consider the circumstances of your visit,” She snipped, before lowering Malfoy into the sterilized hospital bed. Upon properly assessing Malfoy’s condition she swore softly rushed about, rummaging through potions cabinets, during which she spared little effort to conceal her suspicion of the two Gryffindors. “...Of course you both,” she peered at them, “will visit the Headmaster’s Officer, but right now you’re going to sit down and tell me exactly what sort of injuries Mister Malfoy, here, has been subjected to, so I will be able to treat him properly.”
Harry released a sigh of relief and stuffed his wand back in his pocket, “Just been on edge lately, that’s all.”
It was true. Tears streamed relentlessly down Harry’s face, and at that realization, Harry shielded himself with his arm and used the sleeves of his robes to wipe away any tears that persisted, which they did. Without saying anything else, Hermione pulled him into a warm hug and used her free hand to rub Harry’s back when his cries grew louder, and he began to tremble. At what, he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t the one splayed about on the tiled floor with fresh scars that marred his body. Harry despised Malfoy, but he still could not bring himself to believe that his hatred justified the harm his actions had caused.
Harry stood frozen, unsure of what to say. Ron stared back at him with a meaningful look written across his face. Harry studied his friend’s face and cursed Hermione for possibly jinxing him.
Pieces of loose parchment were floating lazily through the air when Harry groaned and raised his head to see who had gotten in his way. The girl, who had already sat up to glare daggers at Harry, but he wasn’t looking at her face because he would recognise his friend’s frizzy, unkempt hair any day. And by the wide-eyed surprise that had since replaced her anger, it was clear that she recognised Harry as well.
“You did?” Malfoy’s eyes wracked Harry up and down as if assessing whether Harry would attack him. Shifting his weight foot to foot, Harry glanced at the doorway and wondered if Hermione would be disappointed if he failed to endure another conversation with Malfoy. However, he had a feeling that enduring Malfoy’s company would be far less painful than the insufferable anguish caused by one of Hermione’s lectures if he were to go against her plan.
“I’m just surprised you didn’t go directly to the match,” said Hermione, unknowingly drawing his attention away from the architecture.
“He’s what?” Hermione shrieked from behind him where she had stopped completely with her mouth agape.
Ron sighed and reached over for the bag that sat at the foot of his bed. For what felt like an eternity in hell, Harry watched as Ron shuffled the insides of the bag until he finally pulled out his copy of
“C’mon, Hermione will give us an earful if we stay up here too long,” Ron said, turning to leave the dormitory, and Harry felt himself nodding along.
Snape looked offended by this and opened his mouth to voice this, but Dumbledore continued, oblivious of Snape’s displeasure. “Specifically, you shall accompany Miss Parkinson on her nightly patrols. Additionally, you are to attend Saturday detentions, which will be overseen by Professor Snape.”
“We don’t know what level Riddle is at,” Harry pointed out. “Imagine if we scaled to the top and find out that the office is actually on the first floor.”
“I like defying the odds,” he said. “And you keep apologizing to me. You don’t need to, you know. It’s putting me off.”
“You do realize that I have never once confirmed or denied anything, right?” The Quibbler had been one of the worst, reporting frequently – and to my vast annoyance, mostly truthful – on what had happened during my search for the Grimoire. I scowled. “My lips are sealed.”
“Book knowledge is no substitute for lived experience,” Potter said. My father’s mouth puckered. “That’s why we came to you.”
Draco’s pulse raced. Did he find it? It might sound like an average day for those unfamiliar with Lucius, but Draco understood his father well enough to know that Lucius would never front the money for anyone, not even his biggest clients. And this new investor … Draco checked the date in the stack which the sheaf came from.
“We’re not,” Harry said. “We’re going to disguise ourselves as the janitors. I have two stock uniforms in the carboot.”
“Be careful,” Draco said to Harry. “Don’t do anything stupid.” He had an inexplicable desire to go with Harry. It was ridiculous: this was Harry’s job. Draco’s job was to wait for the artifact, determine its veracity and how it fitted into his father’s death. It wasn’t Draco’s role to be in the field.
Potter laughed out loud this time. “Credit card. But you’re not off the mark.” He surveyed me. “When did you begin paying attention to Muggle money?”
“Don’t follow any attractive stranger home,” Malfoy called out, his feet propped on the table, one hand swirling a crystal goblet. “I don’t fancy coming to your rescue twice in one night.”
“It certainly sounds fantastical,” she said, “but I mean, the Founders were real people, and it’s completely possible that Slytherin had a Grimoire. Besides, there are plenty of things that people believe to be myths but are real. Like the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
“Branching out from Auror work,” he said lightly. Like me, he seemed to agree that the fewer knew about our true mission, the safer it was. “Besides, Draco here is paying exorbitantly for the pleasure of my company.”
“He’s a dangerous man, Draco, despite how comical it may be to adopt such a stupid nickname. He’s a mass murderer, someone who kills without compunction, and sometimes even without reason.”
“Good. The Americans are overconfident and distracted with the idea of terrorism.” Riddle’s face twisted. “Unlike their British counterparts, they are much less competent when it comes to dealing with us. However, they might still pose a danger. It is good that we have the opportunity to eliminate the leaks before they become threats. Anything else?”
In that instant, Harry jumped out of where he had been hunkering, running towards them. His feet sending her gun out of the room.
‘I know you can kill me, but then you’ll lose a great opportunity,’ the man said. ‘And I promise you, it’ll be a bargain that benefits both of us.’
I squeezed the tip, making a face at the pain. Blood coalesced into a droplet. I dipped my wand in it.
Malfoy mirrored Harry and stripped, in a motion more graceful and smooth than Harry’s. His body gleamed in the soft light from the lamps: smooth, slightly build, and yet none the less muscular for it.
“It was my fault,” I whispered, my throat hoarse from the effort of keeping the spell together. “I was showing Harry something and then I accidentally touched it. He just – jumped in front of me.”
Potter was sitting close enough that I could make out the individual lashes. He was unshaven, with a slight hint of stubble, and his tongue, flat and pink, peeked out of his mouth. He looked at me, his eyes a bright green that called to mind summer fields in the sun, and I moved in nearer to him …. I licked my own lips … our noses were almost touching ….
The cold nipped at their skin. Stifling the urge to sneeze, Draco pulled his jacket closer. Next to him, Harry rubbed his arms.
“Actually, they do,” Harry said. “I have an emergency radio transmitter on me at all times. It should be reinforcements. They should’ve came sooner, but I’m guessing it was all that rock that prevented them from picking up the signal.”
“Didn’t stop them from cutting me loose the minute my father’s indictment hit,” Draco said under his breath. That still smarted, how they explained with apologetic faces they couldn’t afford to take on another junior curator. It had been clear to all that the real reason was his father’s face splashed across the tabloids with ever more lurid headlines.
Draco suppressed the remark he had at the thought of going to the Burrow for dinner. Who named their home ‘the Burrow’? But even though Draco had not promised Harry to be nice, maybe he should try being more conciliatory with the Weasleys. If anything, it might bring him some karmic relief.
McLaggen’s face mottled. Harry added: “It was his idea. He thought it might cut through the layers of bureaucracy and that you have better things to do than listen to me.”
My legs were jelly and I hardly thought I would be able to claw my way up the stairs, but that was irrelevant. All I wanted was to be left alone, Potter’s comforting presence notwithstanding. I could barely take in enough air to let out the scream that bubbled inside me. All that kept it at by was a resolve to not break down in front of Potter.
“They’re the heads of past house-elves,” Potter said shortly. “We tried removing them, but they’re stuck on the wall with Permanent Sticking Charms.”
“Let me guess: a tall dark stranger awaits me, with promises of passion and exotic adventure?” Draco snorted. “I think the tall dark stranger will be in for a rude shock when I make him help me do laundry.” He eyed Harry. “You should throw out your socks, by the way. They’re kind of disgusting.”
“Just a short bit,” Harry said. “It’s a nice walk though, even with the cold.” His hand bumped Draco’s, and in the passing of the car lights, Draco saw him smile.
Cross laughed. “I own that publication, you know. How do you think I collect that all those objects of power? By the way, you lost me a very substantial collection with your raid. I think we can call it even, don’t you think?”
“Oh.” I hadn’t expected that tidbit. I filed it away, in case there was use for it later. Though I couldn’t claim to be much better with my own paperwork. “Well, if you’re taking my report, I was attacked in the middle of Hyde Park earlier. With magic.”
Over the light music playing softly from the hidden speakers, Draco tried to probe the man for more information. How did he find business? Was there an influx of Afghani artifacts, or any Middle Eastern artifacts lately in the country?
“Do we have any idea what this spell is?” Harry looked at the sight with professional interest, though not daring to approach it. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen this before. It reminds me of Fiendfyre.”
Harry held himself from comments. He had an unpleasant premonition about where Malfoy’s story was headed.
She gave me a look as we left the Head Goblin’s office. When I opened my mouth, she gave me a little shake of the head to forestall me.
True to her word, Granger had brought over piles of books from the Ministry on anything relating to memory magic. They filled one of the rooms on the second floor that I turned into a second study.
A loud clatter echoed. I winced. There was a strict no noise policy in the Reading Room, and heads were already turning to stare at me.
Potter rubbed his eyes. “There are a lot of alleyways in London, and I still have to work. I can’t watch you all day. And I can’t ask Hermione or Ron to do that either; they also have jobs.”
She grinned back. “No thank. Save all of it for Draco later. We need to go back and check the damage. Do you want to come?”
Harry’s angry recriminations burned away at the sight of that marring otherwise perfect skin. “What is that?”
“Yes.” Harry’s eyes were unflinching. “I’ve been investigating them ever since I learned the truth about my parents’ death. And when the team in charge of countering them found out, they offered me a spot.”
I looked at them fondly. It was practically a tradition by now to meet at least once a week for drinks whenever we were in the same city. We were each other’s connection with our collective past.
Harry nodded. “I think it’s still safe for you to go out, but you should minimize your exposure. And be careful with your calls. Did you use the burner phone I gave you?”
It seems too much of a coincidence for that drug to be proliferating and then someone with access to these plans dies of an overdose, Harry said. I don’t buy it.
My toes curled. It was the type of kiss I fantasized Potter would give – urgent, tender. The way he pushed me against the bench, lying on top of me … my hand found my cock and began to stroke.
“You don’t know me as well as you think you do,” I said. One hand gripped my chest, trying in vain to squeeze out the pain. My wand pointed at his face. It shook, the tremors in my body affecting my ability to hold it steady. “I would be a fool to trust you.”
“No.” In truth, I probably wouldn’t have asked her if I had not drunk so much. My headache was gone, replaced by a spinning weightlessness that I knew meant I would fall down all the harder tomorrow. But for right now, nothing seemed to matter. “It’s not terminal, is it? Or contagious?”
“I wanted to be an explorer when I was young,” I said. “Too many books, and much too vivid an imagination. I used to run around the gardens here pretending I was the hero slaying the monstrous Gryffindor griffin.”
could do could possibly be wrong, no matter who you hurt!” said Pansy angrily, “I hate you! You should’ve been expelled! Had it been anyone else they bloody would have, but
With that, Hermione shifted to face him. She looked absolutely drained, even her lively hair seemed to have deflated, possibly from the sweat that beaded her forehead. Still, she sighed and methodically stood to face Harry, “You’re crying.”
“Er,” started Harry, recounting his encounter with the odd pair, “Adalia Yaxley and Pierra… Pierra—I don’t recall a surname.”
Eventually, they arrived at the boringly pleasant still-life, and Hermione stiffly tickled the pear, which more resembled clawing, but the pear transformed into the homely green handle, nonetheless. Harry supposed he could not fault a painting for accepting a liberal definition of ‘tickling,’ and followed closely behind the massive bush of hair that currently obstructed his view of the kitchen.
Harry managed to pass another group of students, disappearing around the corner that led to the Room of Requirement. He skidded to a halt besides the blank wall that stood opposite the ugly tapestry of trolls dancing a ballet, and tightly shut his eyes, pacing along the wall.
“You think I’m a Death Eater?” Malfoy shifted further away from Harry and attempted to laugh, but the sound that escaped his mouth sounded more like an angry sob, “You’ve gone mental!”
Another second passed, though, Pierra was the one to speak up this time around, “C’mon stop giving the bloke such a hard time. Let’s spend some time in the common room before the others return,” she tugged on Adalia’s hand, which was tightly clasped around hers, then turned back to Harry, “Sorry about this. Nice meeting you, Harry.”
“There were students at school? During a quidditch match?” Hermione gasped sarcastically, “They might actually pass their classes.”
Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “Seeing as we are nearing the end of this year’s term, I believe it would be appropriate for you to fill in Mister Malfoy’s Prefect responsibilities while he is in recovery.”
“Er,” stuttered Harry. Any happiness he felt from Ginny coming to his defence had quickly diminished. A cold realization that he would not be able to play on Saturday rushed through him as if he were swimming nude across the Antarctic. He avoided her eyes, not wanting to see her disappointment at the news of his absence. “Dumbledore requires that I replace Malfoy in his Prefect duties. Also, I’ve detention with Snape every Saturday from now,” Harry lamely tacked on.
not pretend that he wasn’t the cause of all this blood that pooled around him. It would be negligent to go about his day and pretend that Malfoy would miraculously survive Harry’s wrath.
Hermione considered his question for a moment, then said carefully, “I don’t think a person’s attraction is something they can really
Hermione raised her head to look at whatever had caught his attention, and when she found nothing there, she hesitantly continued walking when Harry reached her. Thankfully, when they arrived at the portrait hole nothing else of significance had occurred, save for the occasional painting that hushed the pair.
A deafening bang brought Harry’s attention back to Malfoy and the metallic bin behind him erupted wholly into angry flames that scorched the walls and floor, which surrounded the dying fire. Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and obliterated the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who shrieked loudly and dove into the toilet’s plumbing, most likely retreating to the Prefect Bathrooms where she could barricade herself from quarrelsome students; water sprung from the destroyed cistern, flooding the floor and joining the puddle of soapy sink water that collected under the sinks lining the walls. Harry rushed forwards, planning to tackle Malfoy while the boy stood, transfixed by the ever-increasing amount of water, but slipped before he could reach his target. Malfoy’s head snapped towards Harry’s charging form, his face contorted and cried
“Ah, must’ve missed them all those times I slept at night. I’ll greet them next time around, if I’m awake that is,” quipped Harry to which Hermione rolled her eyes.
“A book. It was from the library.” Harry felt reprehensible for lying to Dumbledore of all people, but there wasn’t much he could do or say without exposing his possession of the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of
“Yes, it made quite a stir amongst the girls when they were found out,” Hermione affirmed matter-of-factly, “It didn’t help that they went about it so openly after the fact.”
A minute or an hour or possibly two days seemed to have passed before Harry spoke up again, “It’s just all been too much too quickly, and I don’t know, we—me and Ginny—haven’t exactly discussed our relationship status.”
The darkness retreated. Nothing. The corridors were vacant save for himself. Harry felt utterly foolish, even more so when several paintings awoke to scold him, though he refused to put the light out. Still trying and failing to shake the feeling of danger, Harry walked briskly through corridors, scanning his surroundings as if there were a Death Eater lurking around every corner.
Once again, an obnoxious part of him demanded that he stay. For what exactly, he could not know, which made the feeling all the more confusing. So, instead, Harry merely nodded his head, watching as a new wave of tears erupted forth from Malfoy’s eyes, and made his way, stumbling carelessly, towards the Hospital Wing’s door. When the door fell shut, Harry heard the first sob crack loudly against the silent night air. Another ugly sob ripped through the silence, holding all the pain of a person being murdered. For a moment, Harry wanted to help Malfoy in any way he could. He left instead.
Despite his haste, his uncertainty, and panic of what horrific plans Snape had conducted in his absence; Harry steps faltered and gaped at what the door had revealed. The grand room he was standing in seemed to reach for miles and the pillar stretched proudly, hoisting the cursed ceiling that he suspected was taller than the Astronomy Tower as viewed from the courtyard below. The high windows to his right let lazy trails of light bathe the room and its contents in a warm shower of sunlight that made a spark of happiness flare in his chest. Harry felt like a small presence in the cathedral-like room that did not acknowledge his presence. On closer
The common room was still pact full older students chatting lively with one another. Against the red and gold colours that adorn the room, a fire roared to life, which was currently being crowded around by several seventh and sixth-year boys tossing crumpled wads of parchment at each other, screeching whenever one hit its intended target. Meanwhile, girls of all years lounged in the padded couches and chairs that seemed to completely absorb the younger girls.
The pair walked in silence. Besides him, Hermione ruffled through her bag, pulling out several sheets of paper at once, she began flipping through them while muttering incoherently. Harry stared forward, watching the torches flicker and grow faint as they passed by. Occasionally, the inhabitants of one painting or another would watch as they passed, and others would jostle awake the good number of paintings snoring rather noticeably, then try to fall asleep themselves before the snorers resumed sleeping.
“But you shouldn’t feel guilty about it. Without the Prince’s bezoar tip,” Ron drew his finger significantly across his throat, “I wouldn’t be here, now would I? Besides, by the sounds of it, Malfoy would’ve done worse to you, and he wouldn’t have been as mopey about it.”
His tone was absent of malice. Despite his own agitation, still, Harry would describe Dumbledore’s demeanor as calm and part of him wished the expression of the ancient wizard matched his harsh words. Harry dug his thumb into the skin between the bones of his opposite wrist in a weak effort to prevent the spread of the painfully suffocating guilt that spread from his ribs that tighten and forced Harry to take tiny, tiny breaths. He hadn’t been punched, but the way his guts twisted around his stomach strained Harry’s already short breaths.
Sleeping peacefully within the confines of their dorm rooms, students snored rather loudly, shifted about lazily in their beds, and dreamt mostly of bewildering worlds that defied the laws of physics but made perfect sense all at the same time. In the Hospital Wing, a lone boy sat up in his bed staring angrily at the floor with no one to share in his discomfort. His fingers lightly traced the newly formed scars that protruded along his body, and no matter how he loathed his marred torso Malfoy could not force himself to think of anything but the boy who left the permanent scars. Once again, the boy was reminded that he would never truly escape Harry Potter’s name, the thought of which made him want to hurl. It would still be a few long hours until Madam Pomfrey tended to him, so Malfoy could do nothing but sit and wait, wallowing in his hatred of the Chosen One although every part of himself knew
you,” Harry shot her a sceptical look and Hermione amended, “Alright, well maybe I did, but Harry, I’m just really worried about, well, everything that’s happened... especially with you.”
“Shit assassin as well,” joked Harry before regaining his seriousness, “We should inform Dumbledore.”
Granger had been watching our exchange silently. “Oh, you should go, Harry. They’re quite fun sometimes. Free food and booze, and you have the pleasure to see distinguished professors making a fool out of themselves when they’re drunk.”
Potter came out. My mouth went dry. He looked more delectable than ever, tall and broad and dark. His chest had thickened since I last saw him, though still retaining his overall slim build. I suppressed a desire to touch it. Sleepy eyes looked at me through round-framed glasses, and those emerald eyes, so often filled with anger and dislike at me, were filled with curiosity. His hair still appeared as if it had never met a comb, but what looked grungy on a teenager somehow worked on an adult man.
Draco stilled his face, hoping that the bluff would work. It wasn’t out of the question; Harry had let Shacklebolt know that they were in the office, and Shacklebolt had helped with the cameras. However, from the way Harry phrased it, it was as if they had men at the corner waiting for the signal to break in.
Even more pressing than the man’s appearance was behind him, with guns pointed straight at Draco and Harry.
“What these men had been up to while they were down here.” Harry showed Malfoy the photos of the deceased Unspeakables.
He hoped Harry was able to keep up. No doubt they had a lock on his cell phone and were able to track him and Fletcher, but Draco didn’t relish the idea of being so exposed. It would be easy for someone to sneak up behind them with a knife in the back.
“Malfoy,” Potter sat me down. “I’ll make you a cup of tea and call Hermione.” I twitched as he tenderly pried my hand off. I had left nail marks.
“Right, sir. Well, the thing is, is that these seem more numerous than usual, and have been making suspicious movements, such as clearing ahead of the route Commander Potter and his men are planned to use. It’s almost as if –”
“Draco, with the Grimoire, you’ll have the power to persuade Mr. Potter here to join us. You would like that, wouldn’t you? Have him stay by your side? Without it, he’ll leave you eventually. You know he will.” Cross looked upon me with avuncular wisdom. “After all, your past and his are incompatible.”
We had been engaged once, bonding over our shared rejection of our parents’ ideals. It had been a commitment of convenience, Astoria being in love with a man completely unsuitable for her family and me having a fondness of cock too powerful to overcome. But then her beau had made a name of herself and she had apologetically though firmly tossed me aside. I couldn’t find it in me to begrudge her that — someone deserved an opportunity to be happy.
It was odd, to experience that while Draco was standing in an ordinary room – albeit one with well-furnished equipment – and it was uncomfortable, like crossing his eyes. Riddle was fixated, his face enraptured by excitement and eagerness that bordered on the obscene.
I was amused at myself. Usually, I would be very particular on the fine gradients of my concentration, afraid of the association of a former Death Eater with the Dark Arts. I suppose this was progress, of a sort, that I was no longer as concerned with others’ perception of me.
“If you tell me those plans are world domination, I will laugh in your face,” Draco said. “Nothing sounds stupider or more cliche than when a villain wants to take over the world.”
“You would have,” I said softly. “Because if there’s anything I’ve learned about you over the years, it’s that you would done what you felt was right. No matter what anyone said.”
Draco would have rolled his eyes, even in the current circumstance, but he had the feeling that his minions might not appreciate that.
I slashed out, my wand in an arc, letting loose a bright flash. The man – I was fairly certain it was a man now – raised his arm, deflecting my curse with a Shield.
“Don’t you have special agents for these types of things?” Draco asked. He couldn’t deny he was warmed by Shacklebolt’s praise. “I appraise antiquities. I don’t steal them from clandestine criminal meetings.”
“I’m telling you that you should give up,” Draco said, ignoring his racing heart, trying not to stare at Bellatrix’s gun. “I don’t want to see any one get hurt here.”
Harry glowered at Draco. He looked not unattractive, even when – especially when – he bared all that nice teeth, Draco decided. Draco forbore to share that little insight with Harry, though. Draco was a gentleman; he wouldn’t use underhanded tactics to unsettle his opponent.
“We should’ve taken a taxi or even the Tube. Spring in London is still damn cold at night.” Harry draped his suit jacket over Draco. His hand lingered on Draco’s shoulders. It was warmer than all the fabrics added together.
“My, my. Aren’t we touchy? How about a deal? If you help us, we won’t kill Mr. Potter other there. I know you have a special place in your heart for him.”
“Be careful with those.” My father peered at me over a steaming cup of coffee. It appeared I had inherited my taste for it from him. “They’re delicate and valuable. And tell Potter to not be his usual blundering self.”
“This isn’t just an ordinary artifact,” Draco said. His hands tightened on the Shield. As he did so, the glow faded, and the changes Draco had seen became undone, the scenes returning to what it was previously.
But – “Thanks,” Draco said. He stared out at the ghostly figure of trees against the backdrop of faint lights. “For the ride.”
Perhaps the pain would dull if he just moved out of the Manor. Most of the assets the government had been able to touch were frozen, but Malfoys were no fools, and much of the family wealth had been structured in a complex legal arrangement of trusts and corporate entities that made Draco’s head spin when the solicitors explained it. But it didn’t matter: the gist was that it all came to Draco anyways.
Harry was watching, though. He was seated discreetly at the bar, drinking a truly enormous tankard of beer, and keeping an eye in case he needed to intervene. Though how he would be able to stand up straight, let alone do anything after finishing his glass was truly beyond Draco.
It did mean that here he was now, freezing in the bitter cold, while trying to track down one single car, trying to find it in the crush of London’s insane traffic. It was like fishing for a needle that had dropped into the ocean.
“I was curious as to the provenance of that book, Dr. Malfoy.” There was, as expected, the curl of disdain on his use of the word “doctor.”
My face burning, I turned to face the body on the floor. It was moving now, the concealment spell still preventing his hood from falling.
“More like poison me to death.” I glared at Potter without heat. He was right; it did relax me, just a miniscule amount. But it was enough to restore most of my mental functions. “We need to inform the Ministry of what happened. Or at least Granger. And have someone go to the Manor to – to retrieve the bodies.”
“We don’t use the Dining Room anymore,” I said. “It’s where — was where we had the meetings.” A body suspended over the table, rotating ... a flash of green and it fell, heavy, with a wooden thud....
“Thanks,” Potter said. His hand caught mine as I reached over to adjust the collar. It was hot and callused against my own. His thumb traced over the crook of my hand. “I can do it.”
“Being cooperative is so much more helpful, is it not?” he cooed, crouching down. “See how easy it is to get on my good side –”
“This wand is specially designed to blend in urban environments and made specifically to counter people … well, people like you.” Malfoy waved at Harry. “People with the advantage of biomechanical enhancements and Sentient Intelligence connections. Whoever made it won’t be that easy to find, especially for Aurors. You understand the implication of what I’m telling you?”
