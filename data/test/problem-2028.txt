They went back to browsing the posters.
Sirius’s room was undeniably bigger than Harry’s. The walls were painted darker, a deep maroon coating one wall, while the others were a hazy grey. Harry knew it was from Sirius trying different shades of paint when he first bought the place. His godfathers’ bed was king sized, the header made of wood that had chipped in some places. The doona cover was a simple black and white design. A door leading to an ensuite was slightly open, showing glimpses of a white bathroom.
“No, never! I did wonder what it was like,” she beamed at Harry. “I think you make a good friend Harry.”
“Fuck, Luna. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to say… I wasn’t calling you…”
“Harry!” Sirius cried. “Your home!”
“You do that,” It wasn’t a question, just an observation.
Harry winced.
“Please don’t press charges against my relatives,” Harry spoke, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. “I’m barely making it through this court case, I don’t want to go
Silence fell over the class.
A chill ran over Harry, and goose-bumps covered his arms. It was with that reassurance that Harry nodded. The meeting continued.
“I understand if you don’t want to move in straight away, but I set a room up for you upstairs. Like I said, I know it’s not-”
He looked up in time to see Ron barrel into him, throwing his arm over the smaller boy’s shoulder. Gathering his bearings, Harry noticed Hermione trailing behind Ron, a grin on her face.
Sirius groaned, shaking his head.
As he walked up the stairs, Harry thought, if he were to let himself, he would start crying deep ugly tears. But he had never let himself cry because of the Dursleys. Not when he was six and he had spent two days straight in his cupboard. Not when he was eleven, and they had tried to keep him from attending Hogwarts. Harry wouldn’t let himself start crying now because of them.
Even at school when he was being belittled by Draco’s godfather Severus, Potter never looked frightened. There was always an air of defiance about him. There was a fight that shone deep in Potter’s eyes daring someone to try him. And Draco did. He had been fighting with Potter ever since the boy vetoed him over friendship with Weasley. He had rejected Draco’s handshake with a cold sneer and sharp words cementing what would become one of the greatest rivalries of Hogwarts.
“Harry,” Sirius tone was different to his usual cheery attitude. He leant against the kitchen sink, looking at Harry.
“You know…Like, go.”
Harry couldn’t decide if he should try and speak or not. The mere effort of talking seemed exhausting, but he hated how quite his godfather was being. In the short time he had gotten to know Sirius, he had learnt quite was never a good thing.
“Very well. We will serve dinner at 6 PM,” Lucius said as though he hadn’t heard Sirius.
Finally managed to write Remus into the story. Hope you enjoyed the chapter, there will be more of him to come!
“I don’t know. I said so many awful things last night,” Harry hung his head.
“Honestly, no wonder you and Weasley get on. Someone so much as mentions money and the other boy loses it.”
“Sirius, are you alright?” Harry asked his godfather, lifting his hand to pat the man’s arm.
“Can I help?” Sirius asked.
“Didn’t know you watched us so closely, Potter. Jealous?”
“Well, no. Dumbledore just said it was fine, but still, it was very rude of him to be late!”
Harry shrugged.
After it all, the three were emotionally and physically exhausted. Malfoy asked minimal questions and remained stoic. Sirius looked on the verge of murder and had to excuse himself into the kitchen for a breath. Harry couldn’t blame him. He had never delved into so much detail about his relatives, and the experiences were rushing back to him, causing his hands to shake.
“Your Honour, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley have not protested Mr. Potter residing with Mr. Black, either formally or informally, nor have they made any attempts to contact my client regarding the wellbeing of Mr. Potter since his absence from their care. Mr. Black has made as such clear throughout his statement.”
“Ah, yes. Your old…friend.”
overdone for the discussion being had.
He stopped. Dread filled his stomach, and his heart began racing. It sounded as though someone was hurt.
“Who are you?” He demanded.
Let me know what you think.
Sirius’s bark of laughter resonated up the street, and soon the two put their heads together, plotting against the Malfoy’s just like when they were children.
He stood beside Draco with his shoulders slumped. Dirt covered both their clothes and skin. The scratch marks on Harry’s face were bright red and his glasses were askew. Draco stared at the boy beside him. His eyes were wide, like he couldn’t believe the conversation they had walked into. From Potter’s reaction today, he knew this case was serious, but to hear discussions about pressing charges cemented everything he suspected about Potter’s relatives. It seemed all the tension expelled from Potter that afternoon had returned. The boy’s eyes were sunken, and his face was gaunt.
“How have you been, Sirius? Really.”
“What?” Draco demanded, looking incredulously at the dog.
“Give me everything you have on the case. I am not saying I will take it, but I will see if there is something I can work with.”
Harry froze. Snuffles pulled gently against him to keep going but Harry stayed rooted where he was. Malfoy, who had kept walking, noticed Harry had fallen back. He didn’t look back, instead waited for the dark-haired boy to speak.
“Well, he said that it was possible we could talk about seeing each other again, given your approval.”
Vernon looked ready to start screaming again but was held back by Petunia who gripped his arm, digging her sharp nails into his fat.
That night, as Harry lay in bed, he thought over his day with Malfoy.
“Yes sir,” his tongue felt like sand paper in his mouth.
“Well, yeah,” Harry frowned. “I mean, aren’t we?”
The dark-haired boy looked away from Draco. Instead, he focused intently on his hands as he patted the beast. Draco huffed at the boy’s refusal to answer.
Both Neville and Harry jumped, jerking around to see Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan running towards them. Dean had his bag thrown across his shoulder and a worn football tucked underneath his arm. They slowed when they reached the other two boys, grinning like madman. They had neared the classroom already, where ahead of them, most of the class was already gathered, including Ron and Hermione, and Draco who was scowling at something his friends had said.
As Draco climbed to his feet, he noticed the smirk adorning Potter’s face.
“Are you ready to go, Draco?”
“Mr. Lupin, so glad you could come,” she nodded in his direction.
“Harry, come sit.”
“It’s a surprise.”
“Look, I will tell you about it later,” Harry reached up and placed his hand over Draco’s. “We can talk after the meeting. I’m not about to combust, alright?”
“Yeah, that was my room. The cupboard under the stairs…”
“What now, Potter?”
“Very well. Get your textbooks out and turn to page 664. If you were foolish enough to have forgotten your textbook this afternoon, you will be seeing me after class.”
“Ok.”
“Is your dad really not trying to win our case?”
Sirius took a deep breathe.
“Did he get detention?” Harry asked, trying to hide the panic in his voice.
Still looking at the sky, he nodded. He heard Remus suck in another shaky breath.
“Yep, this is Harry,” Sirius said somewhat proudly, budding Harry forward by the shoulder.
They sat in silence for a moment while Harry thought over what Sirius was asking.
With that Harry nudged the other boy and climbed over the bed so he was seated back against the bed rest with his legs crossed. He stared intently at the screen and pretended not to notice as Draco resumed his position lying on his stomach.
“You’re an idiot.”
“I don’t know.”
Sirius rolled his eyes, still smiling a knowing smile.
“Heavens, no. I’m afraid I just don’t like you like that, Harry,” she looked at Harry like she was afraid she had offended him.
“So, what did he say?”
pretended to be asleep.
Harry’s stomach lurched.
Harry lent his chin on his knees that were still curled tight to his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Whatever, Draco,” Harry said, drawing out the other boy’s name.
Luna frowned at him.
“What?” Harry disbelieving.
“You know what Potter?” The words were quiet. They rang threw Harry’s ears. “Fuck you.”
“Now is not the time for your silly little conversations about whatever miserable plans you have made this summer.”
“So… you and Professor Lupin?” Harry sounded sceptical. It wasn’t something he ever thought he would ask.
Throughout that time Harry had thrown himself into the housework. He had managed to clear most of the backyard by mowing and weeding the extravagant mess. He helped Sirius find furniture for the living room, which they collected from a small op shop not far from their house. They found a nice red couch and comfortable brown armchair that Harry placed near the small fireplace. Sirius had even bought a small television, which they watched together most nights after dinner, flicking through crappy reality shows and overdone soap operas. By the end of the week, Harry had even fixed the hole in the kitchen floor while Sirius was out one day.
And Harry thought, there was almost an apology in those words. Memories of summer’s spent watching his Uncle burn letters from his friends flashed before him. All Harry could think, was how he had never imagined his Aunt would put a stop to that. A small nod was all Harry could give in response, his throat restricted for reasons he couldn’t understand. Petunia also nodded to Harry. They stared at each other for a few awkward moments, too many things unsaid between them, neither brave enough to try and talk. Petunia gave a final nod, before strutting away. The last thing Harry heard, was her thanking the female security officer who held the exit door open for Petunia.
“What the hell just happened?” Ron whispered to Hermione, who shrugged.
“The Potter boy,” he grumbled. “Of course.”
All morning things had been tense between the two of them. It was a combination of boredom, stress, and the terrible weather, and neither Harry nor Draco were known for their ability to react rationally to the other.
The change of topic was making Harry uncomfortable. Ginny Weasley’s crush on him had always made him uncomfortable, and not just because her brother was his best mate. He rubbed the back of his neck, thinking of how to change the conversation back away from him.
Sirius mouth hung open as he thought of what to say. He turned to Harry.
That summer had been the best of Harry’s life. For the first time ever, Harry had felt safe. Sirius was the perfect guardian. They ate meals together, watched tv, took Snuffles for walks, and generally Harry felt as though he could talk to his Godfather about everything. On top of that, Draco and he were able to hang out nearly every day, spending their time hanging out at the Manor playing football, or eating ice-cream at the parlour near Harry’s home. Despite his complaining, Harry knew Draco secretly loved leaving the manor to spend the day together.
“We can talk later?”
“Eh, you know. Sirius suggested I should talk to someone about everything. Like, properly talk about it with a therapist. I wasn’t too keen on the idea.”
Potter could feel Draco looking at him, waiting for more.
Laughing, the two shucked off the dog. The setting sun left the room a haze of orange. The summer heat though dissipated, was still present. Finally, Harry pulled away from Sirius, scrubbing his hands over his face. The laughter continued to bubble out of his chest, but it wasn’t long before it turned to deep, uncontrollable sobs. Harry pressed the palm of his hands into his eyes, hoping the pressure would ease the stream of tears flooding down his cheeks. He couldn’t stop sobbing.
Sirius cleared his throat.
“I don’t know, ok!” Harry threw his hands up.
“Hey buddy,” his voice was soft, and Harry felt himself relax just from hearing him speak.
“No!”
Remus shook his head and took a sip of his tea.
“Don’t fucking touch me!” Harry snapped.
“I mean, yeah.”
“Like you’re one to talk, Malfoy. Don’t think I have forgotten second year.”
With that, he began speaking with Sirius, ignoring Harry’s existence.
Sirius let out a humourless laugh.
Harry shot him a look.
Draco broke off into fit of silent mocking laughter.
Sirius rolled his eyes at Lucius choice of words. It had never been a secret Malfoy looked down on Sirius for his attraction to men. When they were kids, nobody ever talked about it. Narcissa refused to openly acknowledge any of the various sign’s her cousin was gay, though Sirius’s attraction to other men was always there when they were young. Lingering eyes struck on other boys. Posters of shirtless men kept in his room. The first ‘girlfriend’ that remained nameless. Still, it had taken a blatant screaming match with his mother, and Sirius yelling the words “I’M FUCKING GAY” at a family dinner before anyone openly acknowledge it.
Draco dropped his gaze to the floor.
“Vernon!” Petunia screeched.
“There’s subtitles, Potter. You can read, can’t you?”
“This was always going to be the case, Black. This was a guardianship hearing. Meaning, the Dursleys could demand another hearing challenging you for guardianship. We have already discussed this.”
When they left, and it was just Harry and his godfather left in the room, Sirius couldn’t keep himself from smirking at his godson. There was a mischievous glint in his eyes.
“That’s what I thought,” he ripped his arm from Harry’s grip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Except that time I broke your nose you mean, you mean.”
“Sirius, ve will stand back and let zem meet.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It didn’t break!”
“We had to chase Snuffles through some bushes. I think he saw a squirrel or something and went nuts.”
Without saying another word, the two boys started walking again, both noticing but neither talking about the spark of warmth they felt as their arms brushed against each other.
“I was doing so well!” Sirius exclaimed. “We were almost there! You’re getting the blame for this, Moony. You got me distracted!”
“Hey! I am suave, Harry! The master of flirting! There is no way I was awkward.”
“It’s fine, Ron.”
Lucius didn’t respond other than raising an eyebrow at Sirius.
“Good afternoon, Malfoy residents,” a female voice spoke.
There were other times, after that. Each time Ron had begged Harry to go to the police, had taken photos for evidence.
He pointed at Harry, rolled his shoulders, bounced his head. Harry laughed, loud and uncontrollable. Sirius strutted towards him, still singing along. He grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling him into the living room. Sirius twirled around him, still holding the scrubbing brush to his mouth singing the words. It wasn’t long before Harry joined in, singing off key and loudly. They danced and twirled around the living room, Sirius prompting Harry’s movements.
“I guess…”
“Well, why aren’t you friends with her at school? You’re her cousin, after all.”
“Hi Professor,” Harry’s voice was quiet, the words a mere squeak.
Despite the words, neither boy made any indication of moving. They stayed in their corner, Draco still holding onto Harry as the smaller boy wrapped his arms around himself.
“None of that is really my fault.”
Potter sighed and rolled his eyes.
Harry was out of breath by the time be finished, his emotions seeping out of him, leaving him a tired mess. He leant back against his bedrest, too exhausted to hold himself up.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, before trying to explain what he meant. “First, I was moving in with you, then it was the Hearing against the Dursleys. A month ago, I hated Draco Malfoy, now I’m upset with him for not saying goodbye to me yesterday! And now, you want to start dating my teacher, and I’m trying to be ok with everything that’s happening, but fuck, it’s a lot to take in, Sirius.”
“Relax. You aren’t about to break it by sitting on it, Potter. Pansy practically jumps on it each time she comes over.”
“How was your summer, Harry?”
Harry smiled, and Draco’s cheeks pinkened.
“Mr. Malfoy has compiled a number of witness statements for the hearing today,” The Judge held up a sheet of paper, which he peered at with narrowed eyes. “One in particular, written by a Mrs. Arabella Figg, states the night Mr. Potter left your care, she heard a number of disturbing noises, including you, one Mr. Dursley, calling your nephew several slurs that I won’t repeat here today.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Luna giggled softly.
“This is FUCKING ridiculous!” Vernon threw himself from his hair, pushing the table as he stood. “I took care of that freak for FOURTEEN years. I deserve COMPENSATION!”
Draco looking thoroughly confused. Draco was the one to break the silence.
“I’m aware.”
“It just, it feels like I might be,” the words were whispered, like he was struggling to admit it to himself.
Harry looked to Mr. Malfoy, who discretely nodded at him.
“Where are you two heading in such a rush, anyway?” Professor Lupin asked.
Harry left the bathroom with a stream of fog following him. He headed to his bedroom with his red towel wrapped around his waist. He made quick work opening his drawer and pulled out a pair of black jeans and a black shirt.
Harry, however, was falling back into the thoughts that had flooded him all morning. His shoulders were tense, and he sunk low in his seat, arms and chin resting on his desk. His fight with Sirius had started out so simple. A simple conversation. Then it had escalated into Harry screaming and swearing at Sirius. Why did he go off like that?
Harry rolled his eyes, too used to Draco’s commands to take offense anymore. Finally, he shut the draw’s before turning to face the other boy. Standing in front of him, Draco Malfoy held out a neatly wrapped present, topped with red and gold ribbon.
“And that’s meant to make me feel better?!” The words were said through a sharp whisper, like Remus couldn’t speak any louder. “Fuck!”
Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out his house keys, trying his hardest to keep them from jingling while he unlocked the door. It wasn’t late, but Harry didn’t know if Sirius would already be asleep. His Uncle had been notorious for sleeping early, waking at the crake of dawn, expecting him to have served breakfast. Harry had gotten good at sneaking around throughout the night.
At that, Malfoy looked up from the file he was rifling through. He raised an eyebrow.
They were a street over from home when Sirius stopped. Harry noticed a few steps afterwards, and gently tugged Snuffles to a stop as well. Patiently, Snuffles sat at Harry’s feet, his butt brushing Harry’s leg. His mouth was open, his tongue hanging out and his breathes panting.
“Yeah, she and I talked about the trouble I was having. Made me realise I was being stupid about the whole thing.”
“Thank you,” He breathed. “Thank you. I don’t, um, well didn’t have any photos of them. My Aunt and Uncle don’t like to talk about them.”
“Wait, so which one has a crush on the other? And how did you find this all out? I mean, honestly, this is just…bloody unbelievable!”
Malfoy huffed and rolled his eyes.
“Shut up, Malfoy. Who even says that anymore!”
How was this his life?
“My name is Fleur. We spoke on ze phone earlier.”
“Don’t tell him, please. I don’t want to ruin his holiday. I’ll be fine.”
Harry stopped walking. He frowned as he looked at Draco.
After everyone was settled, Dumbledore stood, and soon the entire hall fell into silence. It was like magic. The Welcoming Ceremony began as it did every year, sorting the new students based on the personality test they submitted earlier that summer.
“Letters. From my friends, I think. Aunt Petunia gave them to me, just then. I’m surprised she even kept them.”
There was something about the image of Parkinson draping herself about in Draco’s room that unsettled Harry. He shifted in his seat, slouching back, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Just pick something, Malfoy,” Harry said, after Malfoy changed the channel after two minutes of deliberation on some crappy Spanish drama.
Harry paused.
“Not that, you dunce,” Draco tutted. “You’ve looked like shit all day. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“Yes, your Honour,” Mr. Malfoy spoke with an air of authority.
Harry showered quickly enough that steam barely started to form in the bathroom. He towelled himself off, before wrapping the towel around his waist. Then, he crossed the hallway to his room in search of clothes.
“How did you imagine it would go?”
“Oh, wow. No,” Draco shook his head. “I mean, they hang around me because of our families, and like, it’s always good to have them for backup in certain situations, but no. They aren’t exactly the best at holding a conversation.”
Anyway, thank you for all the comments and Kudos, they are so lovely! I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I apologise for any spelling or grammar errors, I was in a rush to get this out for you.
Harry had heard much the same from all his teachers, but he never tired hearing about his parents, even if it was because of his own looks. It brought a true smile onto his face which in turn brought a wet laugh out of Sirius.
Sirius wrapped his arms around Harry the second he was close enough. Harry could feel the tremble in Sirius’s arms matching his own shakiness. Sirius pulled back to look at his face.
The man looked up from the books he carried. Even though he was far away, Harry could see the smile on his face as he looked to Harry and Sirius. He started to walk towards them.
“Do you believe anything he said?”
Silence followed those words. Draco couldn’t explain the sharp twinge in his stomach. It felt like he had been tripped, the jolt from missing a step leading his body to believe he would fall.
“Cissy,” Sirius said, surprised. “It’s been awhile.”
Sirius led them over to the small couch. He shoved Snuffles over, who huffed before resettling his head in Sirius’s lap. Harry stuck to his godfathers’ side, resting his head on the man shoulders. Sirius wrapped his godsons’ shoulder and ran his other hand through Snuffles fur. The family sat together like that, watching a wheel spin on the telly.
“Oh…ok. What’s it like?”
Sirius sight was caught on a small shop across the road. The small parlor was open, and Harry could see inside the shop to its vast array of ice-creams. Sirius’s smile didn’t reach his eyes and when he looked at Harry, he jerked his head in the direction of the shop.
“What the hell were you thinking?” Parkinson whisper shouted. “Telling everyone your related to her!”
The court date was issued for the following Thursday. That was six days away. Just under a week. Mr. Malfoy believed he could give them a victory within one week, max. Harry tried to believe him, but exhaustion had settled deep within him. Reality seemed far away these days, and Harry was struggling to stay afloat with the emotions washing through him.
With another quick goodbye and beautiful smile, Luna walked off, opening the car door and sliding in. The hunk of metal protested with each movement she made, before taking off with a few splutters and croaks. Luna waved them off through the open window.
“Lucky me,” Draco mumbled.
“Can I say hello to Snuffles?”
The class quickly shuffled into the room, confused looks still in place on many faces. Harry merely rolled his eyes at his teachers’ dramatics, before heading over to join Ron and Hermione, who were both heading towards the back of the room.
“How else are you going to pay for a ticket, Prongslet?” Sirius laughed.
“Mr. Malfoy will be coming around today. He wants to run through some things with you.”
“Does this make you not want to live with me, Harry?”
“I’m not a criminal, Malfoy. Like you said, there are a lot of reasons someone gets a lawyer.”
Draco Malfoy was sitting on a bench pressed against the hallway wall, his posture perfect, wearing a disinterested expression and pretending not to listen to his father who was conversing with what looked like another lawyer. Harry didn’t understand why, but the moment he saw Draco, his anxiety eased, and he felt the strangest urge to run and hug the other boy. Harry frowned his bizarre desire, unsure of where it had come from.
I’m sorry for making you worry so much, but things have been pretty full on this summer. The thing is, I haven’t been very honest with you and Hermione this year. I really am sorry, I just didn’t know how to tell you everything that was going on, and I didn’t want you to worry anymore about me than you already do.
“But still.”
“Oi!”
“You have made it quite clear throughout the statement your desire is for guardianship to be granted to Mr. Black. Is that still the case?”
He nodded and stood to meet her. Her eyes crinkled as her smile widened.
Draco crossed his arms. They were standing so close, hiding in the shadows of the corridor, Harry could feel the movement, the other boys’ arms brushing against his chest. Heat rose to his face, and he subtly tried to put some space between them, hyperaware that anyone could walk past them at any moment.
The man set his things down on the table top and shucked off his suit jacket.
“Yes. Now answer my question, Potter.”
“Oh, I know,” Harry said cheerfully. “Let’s get dinner after the movie, just us. My shout, seeing as you bought the movie tickets.”
Please don't hate me! I wrote this instead of my Sociology final. It's my final week of Uni is and shit is getting hectic lol.
Harry let out a small laugh and grabbed the box gingerly. He sat down on the couch as he started removing the gold ribbons. Sirius sat with him, far enough away so as not to crowd Harry, but close enough to see the contents of the box when Harry opened the lid.
Sirius and Mr. Malfoy walked over to Draco and Mrs. Malfoy. The four stood beside the reception desk, Sirius and Narcissa’s eyes locked, Mr. Malfoy looking between the two and
He smiled down at Harry who suddenly felt an overwhelming surge of pressure. It was such a big decision and he was beginning to worry he might choose wrong. What if he picked a dog that destroyed everything, and Sirius decided to get rid of the dog and Harry for choosing it. As the thought consumed Harry, Sirius and Fleur continued talking about the options available.
“It’s not like I don’t want to!” His eyes were stinging, like they always did when talking about James. “He is my godson. I would do anything to protect him, Remus. I just don’t want to forget James. I shouldn’t be able to take away his place as Harry’s father.”
“That’s awful!”
“I don’t know,” Potter picked some more weeds out of Snuffles hair. “I guess it was the first time I noticed your parents always come to your games.”
“What does it look like, Potter. I’m leaving.”
Draco rolled his eyes and nodded. Luna handed him back the popcorn, before flouncing off in the direction of the loo.
He missed Ron and Hermione’s frowns. The noise outside the Great Hall was only amplified inside. Harry winced, pain shooting through his temple at the cacophony.
Throughout the days Harry was doing the housework, Sirius was meeting with Mr. Malfoy about the upcoming custody hearing. A letter had arrived on the Tuesday, and although Harry hadn’t been allowed to read it, Sirius had told him a court date was set three weeks from now. On the days Sirius met with Mr. Malfoy, he came home with slumped shoulders and takeaway containers, intent to ignore Harry’s insistence that he would cook. During that week, Sirius’s eyes were permanently rimmed red from exhaustion and his hair remained frizzy and ungroomed.
“Fair.”
“Christ are you always this moody, Potter?”
“Same time, if that suits you.”
“He wasn’t a complete arse today, alright. That’s all. Besides, it was nice having someone to talk to about everything that isn’t you and Mr. Malfoy.”
“Yeah, well,” Draco took a deep breath. “The movie starts in about ten minutes. Shall we go in?”
An awkward pause of silence fell between them. Draco cleared his throat.
“Mr. Black,” The Judge moved his gaze to Sirius. “Was there an agreement made between yourself and the Dursleys regarding this change in Mr. Potter’s living arrangements?
“You fucking twat! What’s wrong with my hair?”
After a few minutes standing awkwardly in the bushes, Draco moved. He walked to the other boy, his strides confident even if his feet wobble when he stepped over the branches littering the clearings floor. When he finally stood above Potter, he stared hard at the boy. Potter looked to be preparing for a fight, his eyes narrow and his mouth pressed thin. Yet, instead of antagonising the boy, Draco simply turned and sat beside him.
“No, Mr. Potter. Just remember everything we’ve discussed, and things shall run accordingly.”
Harry hummed at him through a mouthful of cereal.
“Right!” Harry clicked his fingers. “That one. Uh, and yeah, we watched that together.”
A pang sparked in Harry’s chest at Sirius’s nickname. He couldn’t tell if it was from sadness, happiness, or a mix of both. He quickly thanked Sirius and left the kitchen, shouting a goodbye to the two men.
The lesson crept along. To the others it was probably torturously slow, but for Harry, he was quite content for the lesson to go on forever. The start of summer would mark a long, emotional trip and he was not in any race to face off against this battle. When the bell finally rang, the class speedily packed up. There were shouts of celebration and laughter of relief. Among it all, Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed behind. Harry glum mood was even felt by his two friends who refrained from joining in the celebrations.
Harry tilted his head. What. He looked at Sirius.
The Judge remained silent while he searched through more papers. Harry thought, if the next question was directed to him, he might start crying.
Harry shot a look to Sirius whose expression was unreadable. Harry shook his head slightly, unsure what to say.
“You have got to stop grabbing me, dude,” Harry breathed, heart pounding. “I swear, if I accidentally pop you in the nose, it’s on you.”
Shoulders slumped, Harry walked over to sit with Sirius on the couch, awkwardly placing himself on the edge of the cushions. The couch sunk deeply, its springs old and worn. The window was opened, and the birds chirping outside were loud and playful.
Sirius was unsure if he could leave Harry so soon after gaining guardianship of the boy. The day had been slow. The mood in the house quite and dimmed. Harry was content to stare at the tv in his Pj’s, unmoving, while Sirius pottered about the house, half-heartedly cleaning without any results. It was only when he wiped the kitchen counter for the fifth time Harry had enough.
“I’m glad things have worked out for you, Padfoot. You deserve to have a good home.”
Harry felt an excited scream develop in the back of his throat and he fought to keep it down.
“Not when that someone’s Satan’s incarnate.”
Let me know what you think. Comments are always appreciated!
He ran into his bathroom to check himself out in the mirror. The pants were long, hanging over his feet, and they needed a belt to be held up but overall, they were still better than anything Harry owned. He rolled up the legs, so they stopped above his ankle, then smiled at himself in the mirror.
“…what Hearing, Sirius?”
Luna nodded.
“Don’t you fucking knock?!” the shrill, angry voice of Draco Malfoy shocked Harry out of his fright.
He looked to Harry for an answer, who merely shrugged.
“What the fuck was that all about, Potter? Why the hell did you run off?”
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione responded. “It’s not that bad. You’re just lazy.”
Harry went back to packing his things away, oblivious to the way Draco was staring behind him. He heard some shuffling, and he ignored Draco who he bet was ruffling through more of Harry’s things. The boy had no sense of privacy, Harry had learnt.
“Now, I received statements from all parties involved, including you Mr. Potter.”
For a moment, Harry expected his name to follow, so used to the three being scolded by teachers in that very order. It took a moment for them all to realise what was happening. Applaud erupted around them, which Harry was quick to join in on, shooting his two friends a proud smile. Ron had gone pale. Hermione wide eyed. She stood first, making her way to the front of the hall to receive her badge. Harry had to haul Ron to his feet for the other to follow. Harry cheered them on as they accepted their badges, laughing at the stunned look painted on Ron’s face. He could hear Fred and George whooping in the crowd, chanting their last name over and over. The two stayed on stage while Dumbledore continued announcing the other Prefects. Harry wasn’t surprised to hear Draco’s name announced, alongside Parkinson’s.
“It’s fine!” Harry spoke. “I can go. To my room! And I can just forget this happened.”
“That sounds sick,” Dean responded. “I’m going to be around there for a bit with my family! I reckon if we get the dates right, we should be able to meet up for a few days!”
“Hey, buddy.”
The girl turned her smile to Draco. She looked him up and down.
But then Harry thought of all the things Mr. Malfoy was doing for him, to keep Harry safe and away from the Dursleys. He couldn’t just say no… could he?
“Never!” Vernon shouted.
“I knew this might be the case. I’m telling you now, so you know what to expect. I’ve got you though, Harry. No matter what, ok?”
Harry gently placed his hand on Draco’s arm. The other boy inhaled sharply, his eyes darting down to stare at Harry’s hand on his bicep.
Harry knew the second Draco spotted him. His eyes widened and he smiled a small, smug smile that Harry knew he should have despised but instead made his heart skip a beat. Harry tripped. He managed to keep himself from falling completely, but his faltered step was made obvious by the smack his shoes made as he stomped on the pavement. He looked up to check if Draco had noticed. The other boy was laughing, his hand covering his mouth. Harry felt his cheeks heat up as he rushed the last few steps to the cinema.
“Yes, we are all bloody here,” Vernon grumbled in a deep, grumbling voice.
Hermione nodded her head, her eyes looking at him with pity. She opened her mouth to say something, but Harry cut her off.
“I guarantee, Mr. Potter, you will not be going back to those people.”
Harry only shrugged.
“I understand, Harry.”
“Your never interested Malfoy. All you do is pry for something to use against me, just so you and your friends can get a kick out of my misery. You’re an egotistical fucking wanker!”
“You right, mate?” Harry jogged to catch up to him.
“That’s why your father is representing me, Malfoy. To keep me away from them!”
Something in those words caused Remus to look up at Sirius, his heartbroken expression turned sadder.
Harry sniffled.
“Oh, such a polite boy,” shuffling noises filled his ears as Mrs. Malfoy handed the phone to her son. Before Draco could say hello though, Harry heard the distant voice of his mother again. “He really is a keeper, Draco.”
“Everybody! Return to your seats please,” The Judge held up his hands, demanding order. “You too, Mrs. Dursley. This hearing is not yet finished.”
“You act like that means something. Honestly, me hanging out with her at school would mean social suicide. Pansy and Blaise would never let me live it down,” He shook his head. “I’m sorry, Potter, but we can’t all be bleeding hearts like you.”
over all of them, and his stomach felt ill.
After a lengthy sorting ceremony, Dumbledore stood once more to announce the Fifth Year Prefects. By this point in time both Harry and Ron were blissfully tuned out, staring out the window of the hall. That was, until Dumbledore announced the Prefect for Gryffindor.
Draco was standing outside the cinemas when Harry rounded the corner from the bus stop. His pale face and blonde hair were shining underneath the fluorescent lights above him. Harry watched as Draco surveyed the diminishing afternoon crowd with a disinterested look. He was tapping his foot, and he could practically hear him tsk-ing at Harry’s tardiness.
Next chapter finally has Draco in it so stay tuned.
Sirius laughed fully, opened mouthed and eyes closed. He had missed how blunt Moony could be. When Remus joined in laughing with him, it felt like everything was normal again. Like everything between them, all the years spent away from each other and the fights they had, meant nothing, and they loved each other again.
The idea he had told Malfoy of all people what was going on seemed so ridiculous to Harry. Not two weeks ago, the two had been at each other’s throat, using anything and everything against the other for whatever reaction they could illicit. And yet, today he had told Malfoy about his life with Sirius and the Dursleys. For whatever reason, Harry had trusted Malfoy. There were nerves fluttering in Harry’s chest, but he was surprised to find he did not regret his conversation with the other boy. In fact, something inside him felt lighter after talking to Malfoy.
Over her shoulder, Harry spotted a group of six Fourth Year girls, all staring at them with various degrees of disgust on their face.
“Right,” he said abruptly. “Uh, thank you, Remus, for helping Harry out. I got a bit excited, and lost track of him.”
“Does it bother you that I like other men?”
“Serves you right,” Sirius laughed. He sniffed, then looked down to himself.
He knew Hermione and Ron’s planes had both departed by now. Hermione said she would be leaving the Friday night, the time her family had found would fit perfectly for the different time zones. Ron would have left early this morning. His parents had learnt the trick to saving money on flights was to leave at times others believed humanly impossible. Ron had been complaining about it for weeks on end until Ginny had called him a crybaby after listening to ten minutes of his whining.
Luna was quick to respond to Ginny as well.
Sirius hummed, not rising to the bait. He showed Malfoy into the living room, gesturing for him to sit in the large leather brown chair. The man looked affronted at such an offer, but after a few moments, simple etiquette and manners won out and he slowly slunk himself down onto the edge of the seat.
“What if Weasley starts a fight, are you saying I can’t defend myself?”
“I think its best to decide when we get there, darling,” she responded without looking up from the form she was filling out.
Harry took a deep breath. The air in the manor had a chill, and the paintings covering the walls had eyes that followed his every move. Harry tried to walk quickly, pretending he wasn’t close to breaking out into a run to get away from the cavernous, chilling space. Reaching the staircase was like reaching the safety of Hogwarts after a chilling night at the Dursleys, filling him with unrelenting relief. Harry shook his head, berating himself for being so stupid. There was nothing about this room that was dangerous, he thought. His hammering heart slowed slightly, and after a few breaths, Harry started his assent up the twirling marble staircase.
“How did you sleep?” Harry asked anyway.
He sounded nervous, which Harry didn’t understand.
“Of course I can read! I just don’t want to watch a boring French movie.”
Malfoy and his friends snickered as Ron’s face grew red. They turned around, smirks adorning their faces. Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry shot his friend a thankful and sympathetic look.
There was a part of Harry that hoped he would, but he wasn’t about to tell Ron that.
“There,” Draco threw all the presents on Harry’s bed with a thud. “All done.”
What had they discussed? Harry racked his brains to remember everything Mr. Malfoy had told him. His breathe was becoming shallow again. Every noise in the room sounded like his uncles pounding footsteps racing towards him. Figures stalking past him reminded him of his Aunts silent presence eager to punish him.
“What did you fight about?”
I'm sorry.
“As well as any other night,” Sirius responded. “What about you?”
“I know, I know!”
“Just one more concern,” Draco said with a serious, deadpanned expression. “When are you going to do something about that disgrace you call hair, Potter? It’s a mess!”
“We all say things we don’t mean when we are upset, Harry. I suggest, you talk to him, and start with an apology. Most times, when we hurt the people that care about us, it is the best place to start.”
It was when Harry opened his mouth to a half formed thought for a sentence that he noticed his godfather had fallen behind a few steps.
“What are you doing here?”
So, one might ask why despite having the best summer of his life, three overly supportive, amazing best friends, and a loving, caring guardian Harry was in a sour mood the morning of his first day of Fifth Year? Well, he couldn’t quite figure it out himself.
“I have that meeting today,” Sirius said, used to Harry’s non answers. “I’m heading into London around nine if you want to come with.”
“Checking what the hell is wrong with you?”
Draco couldn’t help the twinge in his chest at those words, nor could he hide the concerned expression cross his face.
“Get to know ‘im. Slowly sit and gently pat Snuffles.”
“Fucking git,” Ron whispered lowly to Harry, to which he responded with a grimace.
Harry finally gave up on sleep during the early hours of the morning, his eyes scratchy, his body aching like he hadn’t rested at all. He made his way to the kitchen where Sirius was already sitting at the table. The sky outside was still dark, the faint glow of sunlight peaking just behind the horizon. The kitchen light illuminated the room. Under its glow, Sirius looked gaunt, his cheeks hollow, deep bags forming under his eyes. Snuffles laid by his side, his tail thumping once against the hard floor when he saw Harry enter the room.
“No, no! You stay Harry. I should be going,” his teacher reached to retrieve his rumpled sweater from the ground.
When they entered the small clinic, Harry noticed it smelt of sterile cleaning products. Despite not seeing any animals he could hear the chitter of barking and a resurge of excitement bubbled in his chest.
Luna nodded in understanding. Yet, her face was blank. Unreadable.
“Happy birthday,” Draco murmured.
“Harry,” Hermione said softly, hesitant.
“Would you rather I had not gotten it for you?” Draco snapped.
Harry immediately perked up.
“I see,” Remus looked at them through his hair, still bent over as he patted Snuffles. “Well, if you aren’t too busy, why don’t we go and get a cup of coffee? I would love to catch up.”
Still looking unsure, she nodded. The door swung open, and Ron stormed up to them, muttering violently under his breath. They walked to the buses side by side, listening to Ron rant about Snape and his obvious bias.
Telling them would cement everything, and Harry couldn’t cope with the reality that was coming for him.
Harry huffed. A pair of pants slumped to the floor and Harry gave Draco the side eye. Walking to the bed, Harry gathered his presents, stockpiling what he received. Then, he took the time to place each present away in his cupboards. He ignored Draco as he worked, letting the other boy inspect the room he already knew too well.
“Why do you need my approval?”
Please feel free to comment any thoughts, comments. Don't be mean :).
“Pansy and I have been friends since we were toddlers. There’s no way we could ever date. She’s like a sister.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“I’m sorry you found out about Remus and I like that. I’d planned to tell you, but everything happened so quickly. It’s no excuse, but I really hadn’t meant for you to find out like that.”
“Harry!”
“No.”
Harry paused before nodding.
At the very end of the room, in the last kennel, sat a large black dog with scruffy hair and large paws. He was large enough to be a mastiff, but he looked to have another breed mixed in him as well. He laid with his belly flat on the cold concrete floor. His eyes watched the humans in the room, but he made no move of interest towards them. Not even his ears twitched when Fleur spoke.
“Uh, Potter?”
“Mother and Father have made plans for us to travel to France again this Summer. I do love visiting our summer home there,” he said, sticking his chest out as his group gave varying degrees of responses. “What about you Blaise, Berlin again this year?”
“Oi, watch it!” The man’s deep voice yelled at him.
“Inside. Now!” Snape’s voice echoed from the room.
Ron nodded in agreement, and by the end of the week, Harry had introduced his two best mates to his new guardian. He wasn’t surprised to find they got on like a house on fire.
Malfoy remained silent. He stared at the other boy, taking in the dark bags under his eyes and his wild hair. Malfoy sat up, throwing his legs over the side of the bed.
“Crap,” Sirius swore. “I wasn’t meant to tell you that!”
“Draco! Don’t be rude,” his mother admonished. She still had not looked away from Harry’s godfather. “This is my cousin, Sirius Black.”
“What about it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, rubbing his eyes, before making his way to the bathroom.
Instead, Sirius wrapped his arms around his godson, and slowly rocked them both, hushing Harry as more tears escaped his eyes.
“You think I should adopt Harry?”
“Hello dear cousin. Your knargles are particularly fierce today.”
“You know,” Ron leaned towards Harry. “I honestly thought you would get it.”
“When do we get to meet Sirius?” Hermione asked.
The room was a mix of clean and messy. The floors had clearly been swept, but dog toys were littered through the living room. Smoke was clearing from the kitchen, and the windows had been opened, letting in a cool, end of summer breeze. The furniture was placed in its usual spots, but upon the kitchen table a batch of burnt cookies were resting. It looked like Sirius had rushed from one job to the next without even finishing the first task.
Sirius barked out a laugh.
Sirius broke out into a sharp grin, pure delight dancing in his eyes. He opened his mouth to respond.
“Why did your dad bring you with him today?”
Harry tucked his head underneath Sirius’s chin, hiding his face from view.
“Wow, Potter, excellent observation,” Draco huffed. “I don’t care. I’d rather not stay here with you.”
“Harry!”
“Hey Sirius!” He called out.
“I’m sorry, Harry.”
“Well, I’ll tell you what. I don’t think they are exactly like we were, because I highly doubt Snape ever had a crush on me,” Sirius shuddered, the thought making him want to gag.
Harry nodded. He wanted nothing more than to stay with Sirius and his hand itched to hold onto his godfathers. He refused the urge, berating himself for acting like such a child. Without a word he went to sit on the green lounge with silver trimmings set up in the corner of the room. As he sat, he watched as his godfather spoke quick words to the receptionist before making his way to the elevator.
Malfoy through up his hands in a mock surrender.
Harry made his way to the kitchen after descending the stairs. There was a small hole in the floorboards near the fridge which he avoided from habit. The window above the sink looked out into the small backyard full of overgrown grass and weeds. Harry made a mental note to get started on the yard work now that he was out of school.
The rage in Draco’s eyes pierced Harry, and he had to keep himself from flinching under its heat.
“What was it you were fighting about?”
“What do I do?” Harry asked Fleur.
“Um, nah. I’m right sitting with Luna. Thanks though.”
“Potter.”
When he was released, Harry took in his surroundings. The room was set up like it were a normal living room. Couches and chairs, a table, and toys lining shelves along the walls.
And just like that, all the worry Draco and Sirius and Remus had prevented Harry from feeling, returned. A tight, iron grip grasped Harry’s stomach, making him feel ill. All he could do was nod, bidding Sirius goodnight as the man left the room, unable to evade the anxiety coursing through his mind.
“What now, you ponce?”
The day continued with relative ease. The class had all but forgotten about Draco’s outburst. However, towards the end of the day, in-between classes, Harry had walked past Parkinson ripping into Draco over the matter. They were off to the side of the hallway, Draco surveying the students walking past, Parkinson staring at the blonde with bulging, outraged eyes. Ron and Hermione were too far into their argument to listen to the Slytherins argument.
“Call me when you can, alright,” Ron demanded, and Hermione nodded insistently next to him.
Sirius waved him off, rolling his eyes.
“Don’t worry! She didn’t say anything. And Uncle Vernon wasn’t with her.”
Harry stilled. He looked to Sirius who had gone pale at the words. He didn’t look surprised. Deep within Sirius, he knew there would be a price for Malfoy help. He had known ever since the thought of asking Malfoy for crossed his mind one desperate afternoon when Sirius knew he was losing the fight for Harry. Now, it seemed it was time to pay up. Sirius gave a single nod to Malfoy, his eyes calculating.
“Hey, it’s not like that at all!” Anger laced the words.
Malfoy stilled and for the first time since Sirius had stormed into the room, he saw a crack in Malfoys mask. Malfoy sighed.
Silence came over the table. Sirius looked into the café, hoping that the waiter would read his mind and would come out with their order at the ready. She didn’t. Instead, he remained without distraction, sitting across from his ex-boyfriend and godson.
“I’ll go order while you wait with Snuffles,” Sirius told Harry. “What flavor would you like?”
“What?” Sirius looked puzzled before a frantic expression overtook him. “No, no, it went perfectly! I have full custody of Harry, and Vernon, the asshat, well he got charged with contempt of court. Harry never has to go back to those people, Remus! Everything worked out so amazingly perfect, you have no idea how thrilled we are.”
“Harry, can you go and wait over there for me?” Sirius pointed to a couch by the corner of the room.
Her smile grew.
Harry couldn’t identify the feeling that turned over in his stomach.
The second floor consisted of three rooms. The master bedroom, which was Sirius’s room, the spare room, Harry’s, and in between them the bathroom, complete with a bath and shower. Harry made quick work showering himself, mostly using the water to wash the sleep from his face. Once he emerged, he looked in the foggy mirror and attempted to flatten his wet hair. It refused to smooth out.
Hermione patted her eyes with a tissue, nodding along to Ron’s words.
“I know,” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “I’m sorry. You guys are allowed to hate me.”
When he walked down the stairs, he could hear Sirius humming along to a pop song on the radio. The static cut the song out every few minutes, but the tune was kept up by Sirius’s deep voice. Harry stood in the archway between the living room and kitchen. He bopped his head along to the music, smiling at Sirius own movements.
Each day before he left for his meetings with Malfoy, Sirius encouraged Harry to head out, go out with friends, do anything. Each time Harry told him the standard response.
At the kitchen table, Mr. Malfoy rubbed his temples with long slender fingers. His eyes were closed.
“But-” Sirius started, before being silenced by a sharp look from Remus. He sighed. “Fine. You’re right. I’ll walk you to the door.”
Malfoy looked at him with disinterest.
“Remus,” Sirius tried to cut him off, but the man was having none of it.
“Yes, your honour.”
Harry tilted his head in thought. There had been conversations where Professor Lupin had mentioned his parents, but it had never been any different than Professor McGonagall reminiscing to him.
The whole trip there, Sirius felt like bailing, but he didn’t. That counted as a win, he thought.
The words sobered the two up. They regressed back to their sad staring until Sirius finally spoke.
He sat under an umbrella at the café Harry, Remus and he had eaten ate not so long ago unable to stop his leg from shaking. The day’s summer sun was out in full force, causing people to seek shade along the side of buildings as they walked. In front of him sat a single coffee mug. It had once been a cappuccino, which he had nervously sipped until the entire drink was consumed in under two minutes. Now, he watched the streets, waiting for the right man to approach.
They quickly came across a generic multistory building. The people entering and leaving it all wore three-piece suits of various designs. One man even wore an eye monocle, which both Harry and Sirius found amusing. Sirius ushered him into the revolving doors before Harry could comment on the place.
He sat at the table, shoveling eggs into his mouth when Sirius walked in, yawning and rubbing his eyes. His hair resembled Harry’s, the black mess fluffy and sticking up in different spots. As Sirius shuffled into the room, Harry monitored him, checking if he had stayed up too late. When he went to the cupboard to obtain the instant coffee, Harry knew he had. The man hated instant coffee.
That night Harry had been unusually quite throughout the meal. He had noticed Sirius shooting him worried looks, yet his godfather refrained from voicing his worries. Afterwards, he slunk up to his room, ignorant to the fear Sirius held in his eyes. Entering his room, Harry quietly shut his door and started pacing, careful not to step too hard to avoid making any noise. He began mumbling under his breath and gestured with his hands as he rehearsed how he would tell Sirius Snuffles needed more food. After twenty minutes, he had worked himself up to the point of peak anxiety, convinced Sirius was about to yell at him, to blame him for everything. Harry’s shoulders were tense, and his hands were clenched so hard they had turned white.
“Eh…” Harry shrugged.
Draco huffed.
Harry would deny it afterwards, but when Sirius nodded, he screamed from excitement.
Harry quickly ran into his godfathers’ room at the end of the hall, trying not to slip on the wooden floor.
Exiting a small, weathered book store, was a tall man wearing a patchy knitted jumper. His hair was ruffled by the wind, the brown locks in disarray. In his hands were three books; each varied in size.
Harry nodded, and let himself be pulled into a debate with Draco about the latest football match. Each had opposing views on who deserved to proceed to the finals. Though they argued, the heat was missing, and for the first time ever, Harry, surrounded by people he knew cared about him, didn’t care if he won or not.
“I just… you guys are like polar opposites, is all.”
Sorry for the wait, I suck, I know. I have just been through all my old chapters cleaning things up. I didn't noticed I screwed up some formatting so hopefully that's all been fixed.
Malfoy placed the phone down on his desk and ushered the woman away with a small wave of his hand. She left quickly, shutting the door behind her. Sirius’s expression remained stoic.
They shared a look and as Malfoy opened his mouth to answer, Harry cut him off.
“Sorry.”
“So weird!” Ron exclaimed. “I mean, I can see the resemblance, but for Malfoy to actually admit it. I thought hell had frozen over!”
“Damn the meeting, Harry. I’ll skip it if you need to talk.”
“What I’m saying,” Draco finally looked at him, and Harry’s chest tightened when he saw the blue eyes staring at him. “Is that we shouldn’t tell our friends. At least not until we figure out if we are going to stay friends now that your trial is over.”
“Do you think he will?” Harry asked through a mouthful of eggs. “I thought you said you didn’t get on with your family.”
“That means that if anything were to happen to them…”
Harry held up the letters inspecting them. Four in total. Three looked to be sealed, but there was one that had been open. He scanned the writing on the first letter, and saw his name written in what he knew was Ron’s handwriting.
Harry nodded slowly
“Oh,” Sirius breathed. “Harry’s not mentioned you.”
It seemed that was all it took because Sirius was walking over to him, hurried steps and stiff movements. They stood together, face to face for what felt like minutes. Harry was
Draco lowered himself back onto the couch, keeping his eyes lowered on the ground. With a huff, Harry paced over, dropping himself beside the other boy, the expensiveness of the couch completely pushed from his mind. They sat a good distance apart, each on separate ends of the large couch.
For all the sights Harry expected to see, nothing could prepare him for what faced him. Draco Malfoy was sprawled on his stomach diagonally across his king-sized bed, wearing nothing but a plain green t-shirt and black boxers. He was listening to a cassette tape with headphones, his feet dangling in the air. The canopy of the bed fell around him like he was in a photoshoot.
The room fell silent. Harry couldn’t move. His eyes were wide, staring at The Judge, waiting for him to say ‘sike!’. His grip on Sirius’s arm had only tightened, but instead of pushing him away, his godfather laid his hand over Harry’s. The pair stared with wide eyes, waiting for man to continue.
"What's so funny?" Draco said through his own breathy laughter, shaking his head.
“Well, I am serious, either way.”
“Since when has your gaydar ever been anything but terrible, Moony,” Sirius rolled his eyes. “Besides, I wasn’t sure Harry felt the same way, either. Not until about ten minutes ago.”
Before he could answer, Snuffles let out another small boof, as though agreeing with Sirius’s question. Sirius laughed and ruffled his ears.
Harry wondered what Ron and Hermione would think if they knew he was inviting Draco Malfoy to the cinemas with him.
Harry’s heart sunk.
“It’s that easy for you, is it? You just tell your friends we aren’t fighting anymore and sing kumbaya like a bunch of hippies.”
It was surreal how they went from ripping each other apart to enjoying each other’s company. Some days, Harry wondered if he was only imagining his friendship with Malfoy. Then Malfoy would say something particularly insulting, shocking Harry and cementing that this was reality.
“Luna, would you like to come and see the movie with us?” Draco asked in a droning, emotionless voice.
Sirius smirked.
They were walking down a crowded street lined with various shops when Harry lost track of Sirius.
Sirius didn’t know how to respond to that. On one hand, he knew dinner with the Malfoys was bound to end up a disaster, but on the other hand, something buried deep within him still craved the acceptance of his family, and that was something he never believed he would get.
“Of course, you take his side,” Draco scoffed, bouncing to his feet and pacing away.
When their laughter finally died out, they sat in silence regaining their breath. Potter was the first to speak.
“Are you Sirius?” She asked. She spoke with a French accent.
The chill of the night blew against Harry’s exposed skin, sending a shiver through his body. He crossed his arms and jogged the last steps to the front door. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, the memories of the night washing over him. Comments from Draco that made him laugh so hard his stomach hurt, the dumb, theatrical manner in which the other boy spoke, the tickling of his arms brushing against Harry’s as they sat on a park bench eating fried chips.
“Professor Moony!” He cackled again. “I’m telling him about that one.”
“Will you be coming this Friday, or shall I tell Narcissa to schedule another night?”
The two boys spent the rest of their time together mindlessly enjoying cartoons, and though they were teenagers, neither felt childish for allowing themselves this small reprise from the seriousness of life.
Harry’s eyes stuck on Draco, who looked puzzled at seeing him. The unfamiliar setting only threw Malfoy off for a few moments though, and it didn’t take long before his trademark smirk was being directed at Harry. Malfoy's eyes were shining with gleeful mirth and he started to open his mouth, Harry knowing he was about to make a smartarsed remake at his expense. Before the words came out though, Malfoy's father spoke.
Sirius closed his eyes and began rubbing them with the palms of his hand.
“You don’t sound very sure.”
“Of course, Harry.”
Remus hummed.
Harry’s favourite thing about Sirius’s room was the number of photos he had. Hanging on the wall was a photo of a younger Sirius, with his brother and two cousins, standing in front of a school. On top of his dresser was a framed photo of Sirius in a field, arm slung over the shoulder of Harry’s father and what he now recognised as a younger Professor Lupin. Other pictures of the group hung over the mirror as well, some even featuring Harry’s mother. Her red hair was unmistakable. Harry’s favourite though, was the framed photo of a baby Harry resting on Sirius’s hip. It was placed on his godfather’s bedside table and Harry had nearly cried the first time he saw it. It was the first baby photo he had ever seen of himself.
The laughter was back, and Potter had to hold his stomach as he threw his head back. Draco tried not to stare, but he couldn’t help but notice the other boy’s smile, his lips and his exposed neck. Something fluttered inside his chest, but Draco pushed it out of his mind, intent not to focus on his reaction to the other boy. Instead, he laughed along with the other until his stomach muscles ached, and his cheeks hurt from smiling.
“Why not, Black?”
“He hid it well, Remus… I only found out because he let me.”
“Were you not listening at all during assembly?”
“So, you aren’t upset about that?”
When they arrived at the city center, they departed from the bus, Harry thanking the driver as they passed him. Sirius walked with confident steps through the streets. Harry tried to keep up with his quick pace while watching everyone around him, dodging left and right to get out of other’s way.
Harry glanced around the room once more, noticing the golden hew streaming through the open window. It bounced off Draco’s hair like a golden halo.
The whispered words grounded Harry though. And that was when Harry noticed he was clutching the other boy’s hand. His hand was holding Malfoys. Malfoys hand was holding his. Harry was holding hands with Draco fucking Malfoy. And he wasn’t letting go.
Harry closed his eyes.
Draco’s words were halted when he found himself engulfed in a tight, warm hug. Without thinking, the blonde wrapped his arms around the thinner boy. He breathed in, suddenly filled with the scent of Harry’s shampoo. It was a sweet scent, but one he could not place.
“I am not dating Pansy!” Draco walked over and draped himself on the couch beside Harry, leaning against the side as he faced the other boy.
When he arrived at the bright office, fluorescent lights shining off the white walls, he answered a series of questions from the lady at the front desk. When she wondered where his Aunt and Uncle were, he quickly lied, telling her they wanted him to have time with his godfather by himself. He had assured her they knew he was there and, to sell his lie, told her she could call his Aunt Petunia to check. She didn’t and Harry knees nearly gave out on him. Finally, the woman let up, and Harry went to sit in the waiting room on an old lumpy couch.
Harry simply nodded, unsure what else to say. She slowly dropped her hands from her face, looking now to Remus.
They spent most of the afternoon in that clearing. Snuffles explored the area around them, revelling in the scents from all the different bushes, and the two boys talked about whatever meaningless topic they could think off. It felt surreal to them both, the fact they were enjoying the others company. It never seemed like something that would happen but as they sat together that afternoon, there was an unspoken truce. For those few hours, all their history of teasing and fighting was ignored, and they chatted like old friends.
“What?” Harry asked, shocked. “Why not?”
“Let’s get out of here, hey?”
This probably reads like a bad soap opera and I don't even care.
The first week Sirius had been understanding. Each night, once it started, his Godfather would run to Harry’s side, waking the screaming teen from his nightmare with a gentle touch and comforting words. When he finally woke, Harry was always the same. Hard faced, unwilling to talk, a mixture of embarrassment and shame washing over him.
“We are here today for a Guardianship hearing. Is that correct?”
Even though Sirius was taller than him, Harry was only slightly skinnier than his godfather. Besides, Harry was sure they would fit better than anything the Dursleys gave him.
“Hi, uh, hello, Moony,” Sirius stumbled over his words.
Harry shrugged.
Sirius stopped walking, staring at the back of Lucius head. He blonde realised he had stopped and paused, shooting an exasperated look at the other man.
Thank you for all the Kudo's and Comments!
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He didn’t look up from the floor.
Sirius tripped.
“What about your relatives, Potter?”
“I see you still can’t keep a secret, Sirius.”
Harry stared at the blonde boy, who stood impatiently waiting for an answer.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy,” he sighed. “I don’t think I need to know anything more.”
“Do you want me to?”
“I know you didn’t mean anything by it, Harry. I felt the same way you did when my dad first took me to see my doctor.”
“I believe I have you and Draco in my class first thing tomorrow,” Remus indicated to turn right. “But from what I could see today, I take it you two are keeping your friendship on the down low.”
“Well, like I said, I haven’t been sleeping, and, uh, last night Sirius wanted to talk about how bad my nightmares had gotten, which I didn’t… I don’t want to talk about,” Harry cleared his throat. “And then he said, um… he said I should see a therapist. I kind of went off after that.”
The night he first met Luna came back to him, and he remembered what Draco had said others called his cousin. Loony Lovegood. He had essentially just called her that to her face. Luna gave him a kind smile, but it did nothing to lessen Harry’s guilt.
“Yes please,” Harry muttered, staring at the ceiling.
“I’m making progress, I promise.”
Despite his experience with being lost, this was the first time he had been separated form Sirius in a crowded area. Harry could feel his breathes coming out shorter and he felt the swell of panic bubble in his chest. Due to his short stature, Harry was unable to look over the height of the adults surrounding him to spot his godfather. Harry knew the man couldn’t be far off as he had been next to Harry only a moment ago. Harry thought about calling out for Sirius but was unsure he would be loud enough over the sound of traffic and travelling footsteps.
“That’s me,” Sirius responded, sending her a charming smile.
“Where are you off to?” Sirius asked. He sat across from Professor Lupin, his hands curled around the tea mug.
Harry laughed in agreement, shaking his head at Hermione’s worries.
I am going to apologise for my terrible attempts at writing Fleurs accent, because that shit was hard and inconsistent! But I wanted to put her in there to maybe set up some stuff up for later on.
Harry though to the suit Sirius had picked up for him, hanging in his near barren wardrobe.
“Look, I appreciate you letting Luna tag along with us,” Harry mumbled, keeping a look out in case said girl appeared. “I know what its like not to have any friends and, like… I don’t know, I think this means a lot to her. Next time we can hang out by ourselves. Promise.”
Harry was struggling to make his next move. He looked over the cages and his heart swelled at the idea of leaving all the animals here. He was shaking his head, eyes wide and searching over the kennels, when he heard a small arwhooph that garnered his attention.
“Harry, come on, look at me,” soft words were being spoken in his ear. A hand was pressed to his chest, just over his heart, and instead of panicking, he found the gentle touch comforting.
Sirius blinked.
She handed the red rope out to Harry. He took it slowly.
It had been thirty minutes since Sirius had left him, and his bladder was making itself known as full. Harry shifted around in his seat but when it became apparent he would be unable to hold it any longer, he stood. He walked over the receptionist with soft footsteps, hyperaware of the soft clicks his movements made against the marble floor.
“Relax. It doesn’t come into my room. Apparently, I scare it,” he shoved the cassette player and headphones into his bedside table. “Not my fault I don’t like to be woken up at the crack of dawn on weekends.”
“The circumstances that led to Mr. Potter leaving the care of the Dursleys was detailed in Mr. Black statement, along with a varying assortment of claims and supporting evidence,” a troubled look came over The Judge. “Mr. Dursley, is it true you assaulted the child in question the night he left your care?”
“Aren’t you meant to be in a Prefect meeting?”
Harry threw his head back. He tried to keep himself from smiling, but he wasn’t completely successful. He went to the fridge and pulled out a carton of juice.
“Sorry Professor,” he mumbled, before fleeing the room.
She licked her lips, staring at the magazine cover.
Harry jumped up from his seat. He reached down and grabbed Snuffles lead, pulling him away from their table.
“Oh, um,” Harry glanced to Sirius for help.
“It wasn’t as bad as you thought it was,” Remus took a sip of water from one of the cups the waiter dropped off.
The fight left Draco along with his breath. Instead, he just grumbled to himself, cursing the branch that had tripped him. The dog flopped to the ground and curled up next to Potter, putting his head in the boy’s lap.
When Lucius Malfoy knocked on the door, Sirius all ran down the stairs, opening it after two thumps.
“Don’t ask,” Draco cut him off.
They stared at each other a little longer. Harry was beginning to feel like he was intruding so he averted his eyes from the two, studying his shoes and quirking his lips in discomfort. After a few moments, he cleared his throat, hoping it would distract the two men.
Harry thought over the words, sounding out each carefully in his mind.
“It’s a photo album, from when I was in school with your parents. I found it in storage and thought maybe you might like it.”
“Last door on the left. Remind Draco supper starts at 7pm sharp. Do not let him be late.”
Malfoy tweaked his head to the side, still smirking that irritating smirk. How Harry wanted to punch it off his face.
The words felt like a punch in the gut, and Sirius felt his chest clench. Harry still refused to look at him.
With timid steps, Draco crossed the room to Harry’s bed. He sat beside Harry, causing the bed to dip. Harry’s body leant towards him. There was space between them, but they were still closer than they had ever sat.
“Then what’s wrong?”
Harry stilled, and titled his head as he looked at Malfoy.
“Are you here with anyone, Luna?’ Draco asked.
Sirius showed Remus into the living room. The other man looked beautiful in the afternoon light that streamed through the window. A golden haze surrounded him, and the longer Sirius looked, the harder he found it to look away. He kept himself occupied by showing Remus around the house, but every time he entered a new room, Sirius noticed messes he hadn’t before. Like the stain on their second-hand couch, or the pealing wallpaper shedding down the hallway walls.
Ron stayed behind to talk to Snape and Harry and Hermione stood outside the classroom door. They watched as Professor Snape berated Ron, whose face was stained red.
Sirius licked the edge of his ice-cream, before quirking his lips. He paused at the question for a few moments.
Harry blinked at the question, feeling his face go red. His chest was doing something funny, so he simply nodded. After wiping his sweaty palms against his pants, he shook her hand.
“Well, it wouldn’t be a surprise if I told you,” Sirius practically sang. “Come on, let’s go!”
“Ok?”
“We’re friends?” Luna asked, pulling the attention of the others.
Harry was right. Draco’s mother finally looked up from what she was doing. When her eyes caught on her husband and the man next to him, her entire body stilled.
“Sirius,” she said sharply.
“How was school, Prongslet?” Sirius called from the living room.
Harry jerked his head to look at Ron.
Professor Lupin laughed softly, holding his hand over his lips. Sirius groaned, smacking his forehead.
“I mean, I guess we can come,” Sirius frowned. “I’ll have to ask Remus.”
“I was just telling Draco about something. Nothing too… serious.”
“What?” Draco huffed.
“Mr. Weasley! I said no talking. See me after class!”
“Why would I care if Professor Lupin and you meet up again?” Harry asked, head quirked to the side.
Sirius struggled to think of something to say to Remus.
Harry frowned, stunned. Draco hadn’t said his name like that since the start of the summer. Before he could ask what the other boy’s problem was, Sirius and Mr. Malfoy rounded the corner. They walked to the boys with long strides.
“Quite in the back please,” Professor Binns droned from the front of the room before continuing his lecture.
Everyone, including Malfoy’s group of Slytherins were staring at the blonde with mouths aghast and eyes wide. Parkinson looked like she was one word away from an aneurism, looking at Draco like he had slaughtered her first born. Seamus stood in shock beside Harry, spluttering for a response.
Harry spent most of maths trying to keep Professor McGonagall from catching onto his distracted mood, but he couldn’t make himself focus on the instructions given. Thankfully, the class wasn’t too difficult, and Hermione was feeling kind, letting him copy from her work most of the lesson. Still, he couldn’t shake his mood. He could feel the piercing gaze of Draco fixated on him as he slumped further and further into his seat, his jaw clenching tighter with each minute that passed.
“The fuck?”
Remus sat still, mouth open and looking at Sirius in disbelief.
Snuffles lifted his head as he heard the fumbling of his metal cage being opened. He looked at Harry and Fleur, and his tail thumped once on the concrete floor. Fleur cooed at him as she reached in to grab his collar. As she tugged gently, Snuffles got to his feet. He hung his neck low and slunk forward out of the cage. Harry stood and noticed Snuffles easily came to his waist in height. Fleur attached Snuffles to a lead and started leading the boys out of the room.
“Huh,” was the only response Harry could truly think of. The house was haunted?
“Well it must have been better than fine if you want him to come over again tomorrow.”
“What?” Draco still didn’t look at him.
“Nice car,” Harry said as the driver door groaned shut behind the teacher. A loose spring in the passenger seat dug into his lower back and it stuck of motor oil and petrol.
Snuffles had stopped to sniff a nearby bush, and Harry tugged on his lead to keep the hound moving. Not taking the hint, Snuffles continued sniffing and Harry was forced to stop. Malfoy stopped as well, only a few steps ahead of them.
“What?” Draco demanded, noticing Harry’s stare.
Remus hummed, smirking at the boy’s choice of words.
“What movie should we watch?” Harry asked.
Harry awoke to the morning sunlight streaming in through his open window. It was the kind of light that hinted at either an early morning or a rainy day, cloudy and unsure. Harry stretched in the bed, feeling the soft sheets brush against his skin.
After showering and dressing, Harry made his way to his room. He sat on his bed a little too hard, the spring sending him bounding a few times before settling. The deep-rooted exhaustion clawing through him enticed him to lay his head on the pillow, but his discarded blazer lying on the bedroom floor caught his eye. He stood up, making his way over to retrieve the letters he had momentarily forgot about, the crisp paper smooth against his fingers. The letters retrieved, he made his way back over to his bed, sitting with his back against the wall and his legs pulled to his chest. The lamp bedside his bed illuminated the room is a soft glow. He slid the rubber band free and began opening the first letter from Ron. It was dated from just two weeks ago.
Sirius clenched his hand into a fist, tightening it as hard as he could, before releasing his grip.
Harry stuttered, thinking of the excuses and apologies he could give. Of all the things Harry could have said, he was surprised he managed to pick the stupidest.
“It’s perfect.”
Sirius walked over and stood in front of Harry. With gently hands, Sirius began tying Harry’s tie. Once he had achieved the perfect knot, he brushed his hands along Harry’s shoulder, letting them rest there as he looked as his godson with sombre eyes.
Harry found the kennel to be both a joyful and exhausting experience. After saying goodbye to Professor Lupin, something which took much longer than was normal, Harry and Sirius headed up the street to a small vet clinic. The interaction between the two men was something Harry made a mental note to ask Sirius about later, but at that moment he couldn’t keep his mind off the thought of getting a dog. Harry had been buzzing the entire walk, continuously asking Sirius if this were a joke, if he was sure, and could they really get a dog.
“I never remember you saying that!”
On the Friday afternoon, Harry overheard a one-sided phone conversation between Sirius and Mr. Malfoy. Despite talking in hushed tones, Harry could hear the stress in Sirius’ voice.
“He isn’t with them anymore, Remus. I’ve had him for months now, and I’m working on making sure he never has to go back there.”
Harry’s heart clenched at the thought of Snuffles losing hope someone would take him away from this place. He thought of his cupboard and how he would be if he were still stuck in that horrendous tight space. Harry wondered if he too would have lost hope.
“Alright. How come you haven’t told Granger and Weasley about everything?” Malfoy asked.
The words trailed off to a whisper as Harry pondered the horrible things he shouted at his godfather last night. He ran his hands up his arms, digging his nails into his skin, and scratching down in a long, deep drag.
“’Ello Harry. Are you ready to come and pick ze’ puppy?” She asked Harry.
“Um, hi.”
“Dads picking me up. He should be waiting outside for me actually.”
It was a quick walk to the nearest post box. Snuffles trotted alongside Harry as he stepped quickly, two envelopes in hand. The midday sun was out full force, burning the back of his neck as he walked. When he finally reached the box, his hand refused to let go of the letters. With a deep breath, he finally let go, sending the letters tumbling into the post box.
Harry let out a frustrated groan.
“Do you hate me because of what I said last night?” He whispered.
Sirius neck tightened at the thought and his eyes narrowed at Malfoy.
“No, of course not,” Draco responded quickly. “I’ll be there.
“Are you sure?” He looked over the smaller boy. “You seem off.”
Sirius felt a wave of nausea roll over his stomach. He sat up straight as he studied Remus’s panicked face.
“Then what’s wrong?”
Harry could feel his face growing red, temper rising at the words his supposed mates were spewing. Just as he opened his mouth to rip into Dean, anther voice called out to them, spewing angry spiteful words.
Thank you everyone for the Kudos and comments!
Finally, Draco smiled back at him.
“Oh, nothing’s wrong, Harry, promise,” Sirius took a deep breath. “I just wanted to tell you how my chat with Remus went.”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “I talked to Luna about it. She really helped me and gave me some good advice.”
Shit, Harry thought. This wasn’t ok. He hadn’t expected this to go on any longer than a day. Now it was an indefinite hearing? He wanted to drive back home and crawl under the covers of his bed, taking Snuffles with him for company.
They sat for a few moments, soaking in each other’s company, before finally climbing out of the car. The humid summer air hit Harry straight away. He could feel beads of sweat form on his forehead.
“But what was the whole plotline with the stone? They didn’t even use it,” Harry threw his hands up.
“Of course, buddy. You better go get dressed. I can clean up all this.”
“No, never,” she shook her head. “Though, there is a reason I was sorted into Ravenclaw.”
Sirius threw his hands up.
Harry let the subject go, laughing along with Sirius. However, he didn’t miss the thoughtful looked that passed over his godfather the rest of the walk home.
“Yes, Harry. We know each other.”
“Have a nice trip, Potter?” Draco snickered.
The men glanced at the exhausted dog, who continued panting on the living room floor. Draco sent a surprised look at Harry, who shook his head.
“What’s wrong? What happened?” his voice was sharp, urgent, and Harry shrunk in on himself.
“Huh,” Sirius responded.
“Oh,” Draco said. “Yeah, I can come over again tomorrow.”
“My godfather is in a meeting upstairs. He told me to wait here.”
His words cut off as his throat closed up. Sirius licked his lips and looked away from the man falling apart in front of him.
“I would love to come over, but I had plans for this Friday.”
“You’re right. You aren’t crazy, Luna” Harry eventually stated.
The Judge didn’t respond right away. Instead, he sorted through more papers.
Harry, however, was trying desperately not to smile, hiding his mouth behind his hand, amusement simmering behind his eyes. Draco was staring at Seamus for a response, waited for a fight with hard eyes and thin lips. After a few more moments of silence, Draco finally surveyed the room around him. The other Slytherins still looked at him like he was an alien, the Gryffindor’s in a state of shock. His cheeks turned a faint pink, and he huffed a short sigh.
Without a word of explanation, Petunia reached into her bag, and pulled at a small, thin bundle of letters, held together by a single rubber band.
Sirius grinned at him.
“Look, I can tell Moony not to worry about any of it, if it doesn’t make you comfortable, Harry.”
Remus hummed. As he sipped the last of his hot chocolate, Sirius detected the tell-tale expression of a man plotting.
“No, your Honour.”
She blinked her large, owlish eyes before looking up at him, quirking her head to the side. She was sitting on a brick wall, facing the courtyard. Behind her was a messy garden and in front of her, an empty silver bench.
Harry looked to Draco. The other boy simply shook his head, telling him to drop it. So, Harry nodded along to whatever Luna said, letting her explain the complex ideas behind the film.
“We should really get home. Sirius and your dad probably think we’ve killed each other by now.”
“You should call him. He looked like he missed you too.”
It was late in the evening that Malfoy left, the sun sitting low in the sky. He promised to return throughout the week to get started on Harry’s statement and to meet with Sirius in preparation of the upcoming court appearance. Sirius saw him to the door. Once he was gone Harry went up to his room. He laid on his bed with tired, itchy eyes that refused to shut.
“Well then tell me what my father is representing you for, if not to keep you out of jail.”
Finally, Lucius looked at Sirius, his eyes bored, lips pressed thin, eyebrows raised.
“What did they do?”
“Sorry mate, I’m just saying.”
Harry clenched his heads and took a deep breath before looking Sirius in the eye.
Harry ran his nails along his arms, feeling the sharp sting cross his skin.
“Sirius told you.”
“I’m ok,” and Harry didn’t think that was a lie this time. He truly felt ok.
“Whoa, looking good, buddy,” Sirius said the second his godson entered the kitchen.
“That’s going to look so suspicious, Potter!”
“What is it you teach, Moony?” Sirius was surprised to find himself ask.
By the third week, Sirius was intent on talking about the issue. Harry was keen to avoid such a talk. This had resulted in their first ever fight, which occurred the night before Harry’s first day of school.
Sounds like Malfoy, Harry thought.
“Lucius thinks I should.”
She looked ethereal. The cream gown she wore was made of silk. It flowed to the ground, bundling around her heal clad feet. Her blonde hair was curled, falling past her shoulders, framing her sharp cheekbones. There was a grace about the way she held herself. Straight backed, chin high. Yet, three was a glint in her eyes warning one to be cautious.
He shook his head.
When they exited the stage, Harry couldn’t help but notice that despite his sneer, Draco didn’t say anything to the flabbergasted Ron or the bouncing Hermione. While Harry wasn’t overly impressed with his new friend, he noted it was indeed progress.
“Don’t think anything of it. Besides, you called me Draco first.”
Petunia was sitting up straight now. Vernon looked like he was in the middle of a heart attack. His face was a mess of red and purple blotches. He sneered at The Judge.
Sirius felt his heart rate increase. A sharp anger was building in his chest and his breath was coming out in short huffs.
“As graceful as ever, Black.”
“Ok,” Harry breathed.
As always, Mr. Malfoy arrived right on time. The thud of the door only cemented Harry’s bad mood, and he sunk low into his chair, resting his arms and head on the table. Sirius walked to the front door to greet the Father and son, shooting Harry a small look.
Lucius sighed.
“Hey, leave Ron out of this,” Harry whipped around, pointing a finger at Malfoy.
“I think it is best we meet every day leading up to the hearing, Black. There is no such thing as being too prepared.”
“Bit much, don’t you reckon?” Remus leaned back, taking in the enormous house.
“Wrong with me? You’re the one that grabbed me!”
Harry paced over to the couch, sitting stiffly on the edge of the cushions.
“Lily and James Potter, that’s who.”
“Well, Father cancelled our trip to France because of your case,” He wanted to stop talking and leave it at that, but he could feel Potter wanted more from him, so he continued.
The Judge banged his gavel.
“Lucius thinks we can resolve this quickly Harry, but that may not happen. This may not be the only day we have to appear before court.”
By Saturday, Harry had worn out and irritable. Each night he slept less and less due to nightmares about his Uncle and he had already spent his days cleaning everything in the house that could be cleaned.
“What do you reckon is wrong with the git?” Ron asked, flopping into his seat, slouching with his arms crossed. His uniform was already rumpled, shirt untucked, tie crooked.
I wont lie, this is not my best work. Uni has my brain fried. I hope it isn't filled with to many errors!
“My therapist told me that, in my first ever session.”
“What! No! Don’t you dare do that.”
“Rubbish!” Sirius exclaimed.
“What?” Draco sighed as he stopped and turned to Harry.
“Prove it then. Promise me you won’t tell Granger and Weasley the second they get back. That way they won’t be able to talk you out of being friends with me.”
“I get it. I mean, you’re an asshole, and an idiot, but I get it.”
“Hey, Luna!”
Potter gave him a knowing look. Draco huffed.
Draco stepped through the bushes in the direction Potter’s dog had ventured in, careful to avoid stepping on anything caked in mud. His shoes were already riddled with dirt. Damp twigs brushed against him and scratched his arms, and Draco scowled as he violently pushed them out of the way.
“Oh, hi Harry. How have you been darling?”
Sirius pointed his finger at Professor Lupin who only laughed harder, holding his hands up in surrender. The two had overcome all awkwardness, and the friendly nature between them was unmistakable. There was the same tension there as before, but now Harry knew it was not hostile.
“I would love zat, Harry. You are a very kind boy.”
Luna walked from the bathroom. As he saw her approach, Harry dropped his hand from Draco’s arm, who frowned at the movement.
“What?” Remus frowned.
After a few moments, Harry finally began his walk down the pristine hallway, pretending the creaks protruding from the house were his cause and his cause only. Never mind the one’s that were definitely coming from the empty bathroom he passed.
“I heard Malfoy was lying about vacationing in France this summer, the git,” Ron said with a pleased smirk on his face.
“Professor,” Draco nodded. “I was just going. Father’s driver will be waiting for me. I will see you both tomorrow.”
Hecould only laugh at his friends’ antics. Only Hermione would want to revise for the upcoming school year. He placed the letter on top of Ron’s and moved onto the next.
Guilt ate at Harry, turning over in his stomach and making him feel ill. His head was swimming. He took deep breaths hoping it would calm the haze of adrenaline that had washed over him. He watched as Malfoy finished tying his shoe laces. Malfoy stood and headed to the closed door. His hand was turning the handle when Harry spoke.
“Hey,” Harry said softly.
“Not quite.”
Silence fell over the table, as Remus took in Sirius’s words. Seconds blended into minutes.
“Because you won’t be stuck with me once Granger and Weasley get back.”
The look on Harry’s face, this exasperated, fond look, was one that sent a pang to Sirius’s chest. It was the same look James had adorned many times.
“Well its about human morality, of course,” Luna said.
Harry watched the whole thing happen from the top of the staircase, which was soon becoming a regular spot for his spying. His heart was pounding, and he wanted to run to his room and barricade the door. He didn’t.
“I’d rather go to jail then where I will be going if I lose this case.”
“Ronald! It was very educational, Harry,” Hermione took her seat and unpacked her books. “We went over our prefect duties and some of the additional perks of the job, like being able to take points from houses.”
“Sorry,” Harry said, not feeling at all sorry.
“I kept these for you,” she handed the letters to Harry. “I hid them from Vernon, for once.”
The last day of school followed much the same in all of Harry’s classes. He listened halfheartedly to Ron and Hermione’s summer plans. Harry knew they were trying to tone down their interesting plans for his own sake, but it still hurt to hear they would be gone all summer, leaving him alone. Hermione’s parents were going to take her to New York, somewhere she had been begging to go since Harry had met her in first year. Ron, for the first summer since Harry and he became friends, would also be gone, heading to Romania to visit his brother alongside the rest of his family. Unlike the two who would be travelling overseas, Harry would be stuck at home once again this summer. He refused to tell them his own plans.
“I just, I don’t know. She seems lonely. Does she really not have any friends?”
He looked ragged. Scars on his face from when he was young still prominent against his pale skin. His clothes ill-fitting and patchy, looked like they had outlived their make long ago, but from sheer force of will still held together. The bags under his eyes gave hint to the troubled sleep Sirius knew plagued the man. Remus Lupin was worn and tired, and he was everything Sirius had always desired.
For the first time in their conversation, Harry saw a break in Luna’s dreamy vacant stare.
“Yeah.”
And if he didn’t already feel like the shittiest person on the planet, those words were like a punch to the gut. Guilt clawed at Harry’s chest. Keeping his eyes averted to the floor, Harry simply nodded a single, slight nod, before grabbing his keys off the counter and walking out the front door.
“Oh, wow, no!” he said.
Yellow light engulfed the room. Somebody let out a yelp which was followed by a gasp. Harry watched as limbs began flailing from behind the couch. A stray shirt was plucked from the floor and thrown through the air. A whispered ‘Fuck!’ was heard. Sirius’s head whipped up from the couch, causing Harry to jump. The mans ruffled hair stood atop his hair in a teased mess, and his cheeks were flushed red.
“I said it didn’t matter if he won or not, not that he wasn’t trying to win,” Draco rolled his eyes. He didn’t like the severity of the conversation, and so he reverted to what he knew.
It was that moment that Sirius looks back on now that he hard Harry safe in his care. The quickness of Harry wanting to move in with what was basically a stranger was the first warning sign of his godson’s abuse. It would be months later, the Dursley's refusing to sign the documents, and Harry showing up on his doorstep with a black eye and bruised arm for everything to finally add up in Sirius’ mind.
“Wait, no! Don’t you dare make that pun, Sirius! You know what I meant.”
He placed more clothes into the draws.
“Oh,” Ron looked to Harry. “I didn’t know.”
“Yes, please. Tell me everything.”
“Please, Harry, you have to leave!”
The car spluttered to a stop while Remus gave way at an intersection. He tapped the steering wheel and took a deep breath.
“Flat whites mine,” Sirius smiled at the waitress as she placed the mug in front of him.
With a small smile, Harry slowly unwrapped the extravagantly wrapped present. He could tell Draco was itching for him to hurry, annoyed the wrapping wasn’t ripped away quickly. Once Harry removed all the tape, he pulled away the paper, revealing a small, leather bound book with a family crest engraved on the front. Harry ran his hand over the engraving, tracing the letter P in the centre. He frowned.
Harry’s felt a squeeze in his chest. He was reminded of primary school, and no one ever standing up to Dudley for him. He remembered how happy he felt the first time Ron yelled at Draco for being rude to him.
Sirius simply nodded as he pondered Harry’s words.
“I know, Remus. Of course, I know that,” Sirius scratched his beard. “But I need to know if you even want there to be something between us before bringing it up with him. I mean, we have talked about you and me, and he seemed fine, but… I need to know if it’s a conversation we can have before I go ahead.”
“Hey, I have never needed them to finish my fights!”
“That sounds like a splendid idea. Boys, off you go,” Mr. Malfoy said, gesturing them to the door in dismissal.
Malfoy didn’t sound as though he were asking for a favour. His back was straight, and he looked down at them both.
“Oh, fuck Sirius! You had me scared shitless!”
Harry laughed softly, which in turn pulled a chuckle out of Sirius, who once again wrapped his arms around his Godson, squeezing tightly.
Harry’s chest tightened, but he kept a smile on his face, dropping onto the bench in front of Luna. They quickly fell into light conversation. Luna told Harry about the magazine she was reading, which her father was the owner of, and Harry told her about his morning classes. He pulled the lunch Sirius had packed for him from his bag, pulling a pained face at the sight of it. He unwrapped the sandwich, hummed, then re-wrapped the sandwich before placing it beside him.
“I still can’t believe Harry and Malfoy are friendly. I feel like I’ve woken up in an alternate reality,” Remus shook his head.
“God, you can’t just leave it, can you!
Harry laughed.
“You’re that old?”
He wanted to weep and hold Harry close, never letting him go.
Remus stood in the centre of the small living room, smiling softly at Sirius.
“You’re Harry Potter.”
“Wait,” Harry looked at Sirius, his eyebrows furrowed. He ran the sentence through his head, key words dog and pick playing over and over again. “You’re not kidding? We are getting a dog.”
“You two know each other?” Harry asked, breaking the depressing staring competition the two had going on.
“Why though?” his voice was small. Nearly lost in the wind. “After everything, how could you still want to be with me?”
When Melissa stopped walking, Harry nearly ran into her, too lost in thought. She smiled; her kind eyes fixed on Harry.
“So, he wouldn’t care if we became a couple again?”
“Let’s go find a seat,” Harry dove into the crowd, decidedly not looking in Draco’s direction.
“Draco and I are going to check out the movies and see what’s on,” Harry eyes widened as he realised, he hadn’t asked Sirius if he could go out. “Is that alright?”
Sorry if it reads terribly, I currently have one brain cell.
“Someone has been positively dying to meet you, Harry,” she said, gesturing for him to follow her. “He has been all sorts of nervous.”
Sometimes, there was the odd day Potter came to school oozing misery looking for Draco with sharp words spilling from his mouth. There was always something different in Potter when he was the one starting the fights. Like his heart was not in it, and he was only looking for a distraction. And who was Draco not to comply? He shot back harsher words and violent jabs until both of them were left sore and upset, serving weeks’ worth of detention.
“Who is he calling?” Remus asked, his voice high pitched, incredulous.
It was a few weeks after his birthday, that Harry was reunited with Ron and Hermione. He was even surprised to find neither of them were overly angry at him for withholding the truth of his summer from them. That wasn’t to say they weren’t hurt.
“What?” Harry frowned.
“I promise, Mr. Potter, my son will be on his best behaviour as a guest in your house,” Mr. Malfoy said. “I believe it would be good for him to get out more and I would like that to happen someplace I can keep my eye on him. Even if just for a day.”
“As graceful as ever, Padfoot.”
The tone of his voice made it seem like a casual mention in the conversation, but the way Remus tightly gripped the steering wheel and glanced at him from the corner of his eyes told Harry otherwise. He felt like a rug had been ripped from under him.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed this emotional rollercoaster!
“The book was in our library. It’s tradition for families like ours to have a journal dedicated to the history of our lineage. That one is yours.”
“What are you doing?” Harry whisper shouted.
“I know what people call me. Loony Luna,” she smiles tightened slightly, and it was the only giveaway that she wasn’t entirely immune to the horrible name. “It’s alright, though. Because I know, just because I have a therapist, it doesn’t mean I’m crazy. I’m perfectly sane, you know.”
Here is the movie date turned not a movie date, haha sorry not sorry. I love Luna too much not to include her.
“Its not an issue,” Harry groaned, running his hands through his already unruly hair.
“It was stupid,” he murmured. At Luna’s silence, he kept speaking. “I, uh, haven’t been sleeping well. I don’t know if Draco told you about what happened, but Sirius getting custody was pretty … important. I wasn’t all that safe with my relatives.”
“Just fucking pick something!”
“Vernon Dursley, you are hereby charged with Contempt of Court on the third of July in the Family court in proceedings before me between Mr. Black v the Dursleys over the guardianship of one Harry Potter. For verbally assaulting Mr. Potter and attempted assault, you did thereby conduct yourself in a manner that had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice,” The Judge looked to the security guards. “Escort Mr. Dursley from my courtroom immediately.”
That broke Sirius out of his trance. He looked at his godson and plastered on a fake smile.
Harry chuckled. Draco spluttered.
Sirius shook his head.
“I, Judge Odgen, hereby rule that full guardianship of one Harry Potter be granted to Sirius Black, on July third. I also rule that the Dursleys hold no legal rights to the child and thereby no right to visitation,” he smacked the gavel on the desk. “Court adjourned.”
“So, a few days ago I tried to take up baking.”
The words made Sirius laugh as well, so joyed to hear his old friend cussing once more.
“Are you mad?” said Harry, his voice croaky and low. “Of course I want to leave the Dursleys. When can I move in? Do you have a house?”
“No, but you might do it if your wife knew she would receive all of the Black family’s priceless heirlooms, including the manor.”
“You know,” Luna spoke in a low, soft voice. “Sometimes, after someone experiences something bad, something traumatic, they keep their feelings hidden, even from themselves, as a way of protecting themselves. And sometimes, it’s not until they feel safe that they let themselves feel what they felt when they were hurt. This might be why your dreams are bad. It’s because you finally feel safe enough to let your guard down enough to feel what you need to feel.”
“No!” Remus gasped, his eyes wide. “You’re joking?! You can’t be serious.”
Harry smiled shyly and nodded.
“The Hearing's tomorrow. That’s why we had to get out this morning. Couldn’t sit there thinking about it anymore.”
Together, Sirius and Harry walked shoulder to shoulder up the large stairs, each step causing the anxiety to build in Harry. His stomach was twisted in knots, and he felt lightheaded. Entering the building eased the heat beating down on Harry, but it did nothing to quell the nausea building in his stomach. He was just about ready to fight his way to the closest bathroom and throw up when Harry caught sight of familiar blonde hair.
“What did Professor Lupin say?”
Harry chuckled, scrubbing his face, digging his hands into his eyes.
Malfoy rose from his seat. He opened his desk draw and pulled out a small file. He began flicking through it, content to ignore Sirius.
“That isn’t what I am saying, and you know it. I’ll keep Ron from starting shit, if you promise not to antagonise him into starting a fight,” Harry gave him a stern look. “Have we got a deal?”
“Malf- Draco doesn’t even like me. Why would he want to spend time here?” Harry asked, hoping it would get him out of the arrangement.
Movie date, anyone??
“The word is gay, Harry,” Sirius finally said. “At least for me it is.”
The summer sun had turned Draco’s cheeks pink and his hair was damp with sweat. He had long since rolled up his shirt sleeves. Passing shade granted short relief from the summer sun, but it didn’t last long. He mumbled under his breath as he walked, cursing Potter and his dog for putting him through this. Yet, regardless of his discomfort, he couldn’t keep the twinge of pain aching in his chest each time he thought about how frightened Potter had looked before he took off. Draco had never imagined seeing Potter in such a state.
“How are you going?” Harry tried to say it nonchalantly, but his voice cracked on the last word. There was no mistaking his fear.
“That’s alright, Harry. I don’t mind telling you,” she placed her apple down beside her, picking up her magazine, holding it in her lap, but not opening the front page. “When I was young, my mother died, and I was with her when it happened. I saw the whole accident. It was really quite horrible. For a while after it happened, I was fine… but after a few months I started acting out, refusing to leave the house, hiding underneath my bed. Eventually, my dad made me go see this nice man who told me what I was feeling was completely normal. He told me, despite what had happened, that I was still me.”
Harry blinked.
Harry wasn’t expecting this question from Hermione. Despite excelling at logic, Hermione usually lacked in emotional capacity, leaving most of the emotional talks in the group to be conducted by Ron. Trying his best to hide his shock from the question, and the fear and anxiety growing inside him, he strained a smile onto his face.
Harry groaned, burying his head in his hands to hide his reddening face.
“Father,” Draco exclaimed cheerfully.
“I’m looking, Potter,” Malfoy snapped back. “Free television is horrendous. I am trying to find something not completely intolerable.”
“He’s good. We went out for lunch today.”
The words were reassuring. Harry subconsciously angled his body towards Draco, brushing their shoulders together. The sweet, homely smell of the blonde hit Harry, and he found himself taking deep, slow breathes, savouring the alluring scent. If Draco noticed Harry’s odd behaviour, he didn’t mention it. Rather, he happily let the oblivious boy brush against him without any comment, trying to hide the sly smirk fighting its way onto his face.
“Honestly, Potter. How do you want me to respond to that?”
“Hello, Sirius,” his voice was hoarse. “It’s been awhile.”
“Oh, Ginny this is Luna. She is in your year, right? Do you know her?”
Petunia had grabbed her hand bag and was ready to leave with her husband. She paused at The Judge’s word, slowing sinking back into her seat, keeping her eyes on the doors. At Sirius instruction, Harry too took his seat, resting on the edge of the chair as he waited for The Judge to continue speaking.
With rushed, choked words Harry explained his worries about Snuffles food to Sirius. By the end of it, his face was bright red, and he expected his godfather to laugh at him.
Finally, she shook her head and raised her eyebrows in thought.
The stared at each other with fierce, hard faces. Harry could feel the thump of his heart pounding from the adrenaline of being grabbed. He stared petulantly at the other boy. However, it didn’t take long for Draco’s determined eyes and set jaw to win against Harry’s resolve.
“That’s fine, I guess.”
Harry didn’t immediately worry when he lost sight of Sirius in the crowd. His Aunt Petunia was known for losing track of him when she took him and Dudley grocery shopping with her. The first few times it happened, Harry had panicked and cried, but his Aunt always found him before heading home, piling bags of groceries into his arms while reprimanding him for not staying with her. It was never intentional that Harry separated himself, and before he was seven, he realized she was purposefully losing him. One less thing to worry about. Soon enough, he knew to wait for her outside whatever shop she was visiting, ready to pick up the bags she shoved in his direction. Dudley always stuck his tongue out at his cousin, chewing on whatever treat his mother had bought him while Harry struggled under the weight of all the bags.
“Harry!”
Harry was sitting at the top of the stairs hugging the railing while he listened to Sirius.
“Oh, sod off,” Draco said with no real heat.
“It’s been tough.” Sirius didn’t elaborate.
Sirius whipped his head to Lucius, who was standing behind a desk, blazer shed, looking refined in his white shirt and buttoned silver vest. His hair practically glimmered. The fact this man used to ridicule Sirius for his relationship with men whilst wearing a ribbon in his hair was truly baffling. Lucius held a file of papers, which he studied intently, not bothering to glance at Sirius.
“What are you on about, Malfoy?”
That night, Harry opened more presents then he had ever received in his entire life, thanking all the adults with stunned disbelief at the hoard of things he’d received.
“How was school?”
There was a pause as Harry narrowed his eyes at the other boy.
Hermione smiled at his words. Ron only managed a pained whine which Harry took to mean he was happy.
When Draco walked over to them, he carried two large boxes of popcorn. He still had a sour look on his face.
“Listen to me, Harry,” Sirius placed his heads on Harry’s cheeks, making the boy raise his head to look at his godfather. “You are not crazy. You are a good person, who has had terrible things happen to him. No one is expecting you to be perfectly fine after all you have been through.”
He ignored the offended look Sirius shot him.
Malfoy blinked.
He was no longer lying on a footpath. In his mind, Harry saw the inside of his cupboard, the dark room suffocating him with its stuffy, thick air. He felt the already tight walls closing in on him. He could hear his uncle yelling, spitting his words through heavy breaths. Even as the shouts got louder, ringing in his ears, Harry was unable to make out the words.
Fleur engulfed him in a tight hug, nodding at his words.
“Ok, well, when I was little, they used to lock me in my cupboard…”
Lips silenced his rambling, chapped and tasting of chocolate. It was all so familiar, and Sirius was taken back to their first kiss, 16-yeards old, underneath the night sky. Too soon, Remus pulled back.
“God bless the last day of school,” Sirius chuckled, running his hands across his face, rubbing his eyes.
“Thanks for coming out tonight,” Harry said, feet planted on the sidewalk as he hunched through the opened car door.
Lucius’s driver waited for them outside the court house, leaning on the slick black car Harry and Sirius had arrived in. They all piled into the car, Lucius taking the front seat, Harry wedged between Sirius and Draco. Light conversation was made, which Harry wouldn’t have minded, except for the fact that Draco never once spoke to him. In fact, the other boy didn’t even look at Harry. He simply stared out the window with a stoic expression, hands clasped tightly in his lap.
“I guess I don’t mind if you stayed over… but at the same time, I don’t really want you to right now. It’s bad enough that I’ve been waking up Sirius with my nightmares, I don’t want to do that to you too.”
Harry’s bottom lip wobbled. He bit it to stop himself from making any noise.
“Why would I tell you, Malfoy?” Potter sounded exhausted. “You’re just going to use it against me and tell all your friends. The whole school will be talking about what a pathetic loser I am in no time.”
“Yeah, bit much,” Harry agreed.
“How would you like a ride home?”
Harry kept his eyes on the corn flakes drowning in his bowl. His godfather sighed, exhaustion creeping through.
“You like this dog?” Fleur asked in her thick accent.
Anyway, I promise there is more wolfstar and some actual drarry to come, its just been hard setting everything up! I promise I will get to it asap!
Draco looked over to the television with a raised eyebrow.
“Well, bloody hell Hermione. If your behind, then the rest of us are surely fucked. Ain’t that right, Harry?”
“Time to go, Black,” Mr Malfoy spoke with a voice that left no room for argument.
“Oh, of course! I’ve discovered I quite like having people to talk to at lunch,” Luna beamed at the red-haired girl.
By Friday afternoon, Mr. Malfoy decided they had gotten enough from Harry for his statement. The words sparked relief in both Harry and Sirius. That week had been one of the hardest the pair had faced, and Harry’s nightmares were the worst they had ever been. He had been walking around with deep bags under his eyes, yawning constantly. Sirius was no better.
“Nature doesn’t suit you, Malfoy.”
The answer he received from Malfoy; a raised eyebrow.
“Mr. Dursley, I won’t have you speak of a child like that in my courtroom. That behaviour is unacceptable. Another outburst like that, and I will have you charged with Contempt of Court.”
Harry’s shoulders were tense, curled up around his neck. He dropped his school bag to the floor beside him to relieve some of the strain on his shoulders. His glasses dug into the back of his ears, leaving him with a dull headache.
“I might come with you, if that’s ok?”
Harry carefully pressed the numbers on the telephone, pausing between each button to check the rumpled piece of paper Draco had given him yesterday. When Harry was sure he got it right, he pressed the phone to his ear and listened as it began ringing. He twirled the cord as he waited for someone to answer.
“Why?” He choked out.
It was the day before their first court appearance and Harry felt ready to scream. Sirius had secluded himself to his bedroom where Harry knew he was still going over documents for their case. Harry was sitting at the kitchen table listening to the continuous drone of Snuffles deep barks. The dog was playing in the backyard, running around with an abundance of energy that Harry hadn’t been able to replicate. As he played, he barked and barked and barked, and Harry couldn’t help it when the irritation building in his stomach rose up through his chest and bellowed out of his mouth.
He spluttered, too shocked at his Godson’s reaction to protest when Harry stood from the couch, ignored Snuffles offended look, and headed straight to the home phone in the corridor. Sirius listened as Harry started dialling and went to inspect what was going on.
“No, not Sirius. My relatives, Malfoy. My Uncle and Aunt.”
“No culture,” Draco scoffed under his breath.
The rest of the day passed relatively quick. When the final bell rang, Ron and Hermione both headed off towards the buses, bidding goodbye to Harry who made his way to the bathroom. He muttered as he walked through the near empty halls, thinking about all the things he needed to talk to Sirius about. He was just about to walk out the entrance and onto the field, when a hand wrapped around his arm, jerking him into the corner of the corridor.
Malfoy looked like he had sucked on a lemon. Harry saw the outrage of not knowing eating at Malfoy as they walked. Harry let out another short laugh, and Malfoy’s cheeks began to tint pink.
“It is lovely to meet you Fleur.”
“I don’t get what you’re saying.”
“I guess I hadn’t thought about how much was going on for you.”
“What do you mean?”
“Be safe,” Sirius yelled out. He could hear Harry laughing as he walked away.
“I know it’s not much, but we can work on it. Fix it up, you know,” Sirius had hovered next to him, his nervousness creeping into his voice as he showed Harry into the unfurnished living room.
Harry waited for a response, holding his breath. Finally, his godfather hummed.
“What were you two talking about? That made him mention that.”
“So, where are you off to this holiday, Potter? The Bahama’s, Egypt?” Malfoy mocked; his voice laced with sarcasm.
“Mr. Black. To what do I owe the displeasure.”
It was the waiting that put Sirius on edge. The constant waiting, and thinking, and thinking and waiting. What if Remus had moved on from what they had? He hadn’t said anything when they met up last, but maybe Sirius’s tongue in his mouth had stopped Remus before he could say anything. Did he force their relationship? Did Remus regret hooking up with him after everything they had been through? What if there was another man? Woman?
“That’s what everyone calls it, Sirius.”
There was a pause. Then, Harry huffed, and all hints of nerves vanished from him.
“This is nothing. You should have seen my family Manor,” Sirius strode up the stairs without a second thought.
Silence hung between them. Then, Lucius sighed, before turning to face Sirius. His eyes looked bored, like he was about to explain to a child why it was unbecoming to throw a tantrum in public.
He took a deep breath before answering, finally making eye contact with Remus. He forgot how much he had missed those amber eyes.
Harry hummed quizzically, unsure how else to respond to Sirius’ comment.
The air outside had a faint chill. Harry could feel goose-bumps scatter across his skin, and he saw Luna cross her arms to ward against the chill. They walked a few metres up the street before Luna waved to a car; a beat up, bright orange, punch buggy. Harry snickered a little at the sight of it. It was exactly the type of car he expected for someone like Luna.
A girl with the same shade of blonde as Draco’s smiled vacantly at him. Harry noticed she was pointing to a poster full of different fantasy creatures like centaurs, elves and massive spiders standing in a forest. The title read The Forbidden Forest.
Harry nodded. The clock on the microwave chimed at the hour, the lights reading 8:00.
She walked Snuffles and the boys out of the small room and into a tiny fenced off yard. Harry and Sirius stayed a few steps behind her and Snuffles, who kept looking over his shoulder at the two, tail between his legs.
“Oh, my dear. You just have the most beautiful eyes. Just like your mothers.”
Now, however, he had no game plan. He didn’t feel up to playing football. He couldn’t spot Neville anywhere, meaning the boy was probably in the Garden Nursery helping Professor Sprout. He did see Ginny, her red hair shining in the sun, but she was surrounded by a group of girls and Harry would rather die than walk up to them right now.
He put on his usual baggy blue jeans and stained white t-shirt. Then he took them off. Harry dug to the bottom and managed to pull out a blue shirt that was relatively unstained. He put it on. He dug around some more, before finding a pair of black jeans. Harry realised when he put them on, they were hole-ridden. He took them off. He was standing in his boxers and the only unstained shirt he owned, a slight chill making him shiver, when he got an idea. He ran to the door and stuck his head out into the hallway.
The first thing Sirius did when they entered the threshold was pull Harry into a tight hug. He squeezed the boy with all the strength he possessed. Harry took a few moments to respond, but eventually he reacted with a hug just as fierce, wrapping his arms around Sirius, tucking his head into his Godfathers chest. they stayed like that, uncaring of the time that passed.
Harry shuffled, avoiding looking at his godfather.
I hope this chapter is alright, I'm a bit new to writing Wolfstar. I hope everything wasn't too rushed.
“Oh, we met at the movies this summer,” Luna stated simply.
Draco’s narrowed eyes looked him over again, assessing his every move. Harry turned to Mr. Malfoy to avoid the other boys gaze.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stood, walking with his back turned to Harry towards his walk-in wardrobe. Harry listened as Draco rummaged around. When he emerged, he was wearing a pair of black jeans. Harry couldn’t explain why the sight made his heart rate increase.
“Don’t be silly! I don’t mind if Professor Moony comes to dinner.”
Harry shrugged. He picked at his duvet, avoiding eye contact with his godfather.
As he walked out of his room and down the creaky stairs, Harry’s mind stayed on his friends. The idea of not telling them everything that had been going on with him left knots in his stomach. Especially when he thought how he had never even told them of Sirius’s existence.
Sirius nodded, and Harry mumbled a half-hearted response.
Sirius looked at him with red rimmed eyes and sighed. He stood from the chair and Harry heard his back crack several times as he stretched. He walked over to Harry with slow, deliberate steps, before putting his arms around Harry, holding him to his chest. Harry felt the man sigh as his godson wrapped his arms around Sirius’s body.
Sirius finally cleared his throat. Harry took that as his time being up, and slowly moved away, wiping his eyes with shaking hands. Before he could step to far away, Sirius reached up and helped wipe away the streaks of tears on Harry’s cheeks, and the simple movement was enough to make Harry want to cry again. But he didn’t.
Yet, rather than her usual sneer, Petunia Dursley looked at Harry with an expression that almost resembled grief. The expression was so jarring on her, Harry had to pause, quirking his head to the side.
A sharp ‘Boof!’ sounded from the kitchen, and soon the two were soon attacked by a furious cuddle monster. Snuffled leapt onto them, using his front legs to hook himself over Sirius and Harry’s shoulders. He was as tall as Harry standing on his back legs, and he took that opportunity to give the boy a long, slobbery kiss on the boy’s cheek.
“Please, Potter. I’ve been on the other end of your punches. It wouldn’t do much good.”
Harry sent him a small, nervous smile and waved.
“While it is true you are now the legal guardian of Mr. Potter, that does not mean Mr. Potter is completely free of the Dursleys. If we aren’t careful, he may end up back in their care.”
“Look, Moony, I understand if you don’t feel the same anymore. I mean, I don’t expect us to fall back together immeadiatly, if at all, but I needed you to know. You don’t have to say anything, I can just go and-”
“Well, not exactly,” Sirius paused. “We haven’t talked about that yet.”
“I swear they need buses just to get us to the front doors,” Ron whined as they reached the entry.
“Shut up! You don’t know that was Ginny.”
Hope you enjoyed this chapter, its more a filler I guess. Basically, Lucius knows his son.
Harry was shocked by the outburst. He watched as Draco held out the other box for Luna to take.
“Morning, Black. Mr. Potter.”
Thank you for all the kudos and comments!
Sirius rolled his eyes.
“Didn’t ask you to follow me, Malfoy.”
He handed out a $50 note to his son. Harry stared wide eyed at the money, but Draco didn’t hesitate to step forward and claim the money. He pocketed the note and quickly strode back through the living room to the front door.
Sirius rolled his eyes.
“What the game here, Malfoy?” He crossed his arms. “After the shit you put us through in High School, there’s no way you’ve actually became tolerant of my relationship with Remus.”
Sirius stormed up the hallway, refusing to let anyone stop him. A lady called for him to stop but he shook his head and kept travelling. Although he had told Harry about the meeting, Sirius had omitted telling his godson it was not a booked thing. He hadn’t wanted to worry his already anxious godson. Sirius had noticed the deepening bags under his eyes and the vacant stares aimed at nothing.
He had been hoping for a fight. Instead, Potter sunk even further into himself. His shoulders were hunched, and his face was still sickly pale.
Sirius stood frozen like a statue. Harry tried to gather the words to continue.
This chapter is shorter than the others, so I figured I'd post it pretty soon after the last update.
“You know, after you told me everything that had been going on, I fucking hated myself. Still do. I mean, how could I have been so blind! Harry was my student. I was trained to spot these things.”
Sirius rolled his eyes.
“Thank you,” Harry whispered in his ear, causing goose bumps to rise along his skin.
He reached over to his nightstand, brushing his fingers against the round edges of his glasses. Harry picked them up and shoved them onto his face, welcoming his sight.
Harry felt like screaming.
He stared back at her, unsure what to say. They stood in silence for a few moments before Draco spoke.
Uncle Vernon walked beside her. The suit he wore was a size too small, its sleeves hugging his arms too tightly. The shirts buttons gripped together through sheer will. Sweat marks stained through to his blazer beneath his armpits. The walrus moustache was dripping with sweat. Harry could practically feel the floor shaking with every step the overweight man took.
Harry snorted, before waving a final goodbye and slamming the car door shut. The expensive-looking black car began rolling away as Harry headed up the footpath to his home.
“Right, well, Father didn’t trust me to be in the house by myself anymore,” Draco avoided eye contact with Potter by examining the small rip marks on his pants.
The conversation paused. Harry mulled over what the other man had said, biting his nails as he thought.
“Harry, Draco,” A voice called from the hall, causing the two boys to jump apart. “What are you still doing here?”
“Harry’s home!” Sirius shouted from the living room. His shout was soon followed by deep joyous barks.
Harry looked up as he thought.
Let me know what you think!!
Harry quirked his head. He wondered what ‘that’ kind of favour was.
Harry thought no. He had enough of Malfoy at school, he didn’t want to spend any of his holidays with the boy. Surely, one of them would end up with a bloody nose within ten minutes of talking. It wouldn’t be the first time.
Harry tried hard to tune them out, but it seemed every word they said got louder and louder. Parkinson was giggling somewhat cruelly, and Malfoy’s obnoxious drawl continued throughout the class. Harry knew by now Snape could hear but was choosing to ignore them.
Remus sat with his head in his hands. His breathes were shallow. He let out a hollow, near hysterical laugh.
“Go to your meeting!”
“Let’s go, Potter.”
Snuffles came bolting from the living room, his paws skidding on the wooden floors as he streamlined for Harry. The second the boy was in his sights, he began groaning, rubbing his nose against the boy’s hand, demanding pats with gentle nudges. Eager to please, Harry dropped his bag, closed the door, and crouched to cuddle Snuffles in his arms. The large size of the dog meant Harry struggled to hold him, and he was soon nudged to the floor, sitting cross-legged while Snuffles attempted to sit in the boy’s lap.
“As if you don’t know,” Draco scoffed.
Malfoy gave one sharp nod. He paused for a couple of minutes before speaking again.
“Oh, that’s wonderful, dear. And how are you feeling about tomorrow? I know my Draco has been very worried for you. He got his good suit out today to make sure it still fits.”
Ron nodded along to Hermione’s words, before both turned to Harry for confirmation.
“Fuck,” Sirius breathed.
Remus nodded.
“It’s nothing,” Harry sniffed, hanging his head to keep Sirius from seeing his face. “I was being stupid.”
Hauling a deep breath, Harry entered the classroom, making a beeline for the backseats with Ron and Hermione. Science remained the sole class Hermione didn’t sit in the front.
Sirius looked panicked.
“Hey,” Sirius said, holding his hand against Harry’s cheek, pulling his gaze up until their eyes locked. “I promise you Harry, I will sort this out. You are never going back there. I am just making sure we have the best everything to make sure we win, ok?”
Harry simply shrugged again. His godfather sighed.
For what was one of many times, Harry silently thanked his best friends and their ability to pull himself from his own head. They walked through the gates of Hogwarts together, walking up the winding path to the castle.
“What are you on about?” Sirius demanded. “Don’t be daft, it doesn’t suit you Remus. Of course, I want you in our lives. And so does Harry. Who do you think made the call to you this morning?”
“That’s life.”
“Hey Harry,” Ginny Weasley stood behind him, looking upon Harry and Luna with a quizzical look on her face.
Sirius was getting frustrated, his volume rising.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “That is, if you want to.”
“Potter. Potter!” Malfoy whisper shouted at him, turning around in his chair.
“My dear, these things are merely a necessity, not a luxury,” Mrs. Malfoy claimed as Harry opened a present to reveal yet another set of expensive looking black jeans. “Think nothing of it.”
“Of course she did, Sirius. She was a real estate agent.”
He scouted the space he was in, counting out the doors he passed until he reached the end of the hallway. He remember Mrs. Malfoys words, and finally pinned down the room he was sure was Draco’s. Harry’s stomach with butterflies he couldn’t explain. He stalled outside the door he identified as Draco’s, swaying back and forth as he racked up the courage to knock on the door.
“I didn’t-”
“Excuse me, Winfred, I am going to have to call you back.”
“I’m not kidding, boys. You need to take this year seriously!”
“No, it’s not. I’m meant to be the adult Harry. Not some horny teenager.”
Harry stood away from them all, watching the emotions run through Sirius’s face. His eyes were trained on Mrs. Malfoy who hadn’t taken her eyes off of him.
Sirius still didn’t look comforted but nodded sharply.
“I hope that was alright,” Sirius grabbed the present, holding it out to Harry with shaking fingers.
The Judge took a deep breath. He shuffled through the papers scattered along his desk. The courtroom was silent apart from the rustling of paper and the heavy breaths of Vernon Dursley.
“So how have the Malfoys been? Completely done with you now you’re no longer paying them?”
Sirius and Remus listened as Harry shut the door behind him.
They had been sharing stories of Hogwarts. Remus was commending Harry on his school work while Harry tried to undermine his achievements. As they talked, Sirius felt clued out. He didn’t even know what kind of relationship Remus had built with Harry. When had they even met?
“ORDER! Order in my court!”
I'm sorry, I have no excuse for taking so long. Thanks for bearing with me!
Draco stopped and took a deep breath.
“Actually, I had to talk to you about something.”
By the time he heard Sirius start to descend the stairs, the eggs had finished cooking and Harry was portioning them onto two plates.
“You have not yet finished this school year, and until that bell rings and I have dismissed you, I will not here of any plans or conversation regarding the Summer holidays. You are here to learn. Is that understood?”
“I meant as in dating, Harry.”
“Yes, thank you, Mr. Malfoy,” The Judge nodded, and Mr. Malfoy returned to his seat beside Harry, unbuttoning his blazer. “Is this true, Mrs. Dursley?”
“Zat is why he is called Snuffles,” Harry heard Fleur say over the excited sniffing next to his ear.
Ron looked to Harry who shook his head.
A thumb rubbed against the back of Sirius’s hand.
Lucius gave him the Malfoy Look, that Sirius was sure sent other running. But Sirius had been impervious to his mothers Look by the time he was nine, and Malfoy’s was child play in comparison. After a few moments, Lucius caved, rolling his eyes.
Sirius frowned at him, before his eyes brightened. He let out a disbelieving laugh.
Standing in front of him in his neatly pressed uniform was non-other than Draco Malfoy. He stared at the Harry with an unamused look. A new, gleaming Prefect badge was pinned to his blazer.
“Are you hurt? What happened?”
Harry couldn’t stop his head from shaking minutely, like he couldn’t understand what Draco was saying.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the shocked, open mouthed expression Parkinson pulled at those words.
A gust of wind blew past them. Harry crossed his arms.
“I, uh, think he needs to go,” Harry said.
Harry clenched his hand around Sirius’s arms so tight, he was sure it hurt. But Sirius didn’t protest. His godfather leaned forward in anticipation. The Judge dropped the papers he was holding and surveyed those before him.
“I’m going to…” Harry gestured towards the stairs.
He walked along the street path from the school into the city. He watched as more and more people passed by him the closer he got to the city, the unmistakable smell of thick air growing stronger. The walk only took 15 minutes before he arrived at his destination.
Her gown flowed behind her as she walked, the fabric glistening in the light. Harry hung back to avoid stepping on it, conscious of the fact he was underdressed in his blue jeans and black dress shirt.
Sirius exhaled, like a punch in the gut had knocked the wind from his lungs. He closed his eyes, rubbing them with his hands, scrubbing along the stubble on his chin. The bun of hair wobbled atop his head, and soon Harry noticed his godfather was huffing short, dry chuckles.
“Why is my father representing you, Potter?”
“He isn’t going to be mad, Harry,” Draco placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Hurt, maybe, but he I doubt he’s mad at you.”
Harry’s eyes squinted, and he looked to Professor Lupin, shocked to find the man looked as lost as Sirius. Professor Lupin didn’t respond to Sirius. Instead his mouth had fallen open and looked to be struggling for words.
They continued back and forth, sniping off comments about the other purely for the reaction. From the kitchen, Lucius and Sirius watched while setting themselves up.
“I don’t care! You can’t go back to treating us the way you were. I am not saying you have to be friends with them, though that would be ideal, just that you need to stop the insults.”
“I’ve been alright. Trying to keep busy.”
Sirius felt like vomiting. His heart felt like it was being stabbed.
“I thought he might’ve borrowed your clothes all the time.”
He scrubbed the back of his neck, trying his hardest to avoid Remus’s gaze.
“Not a new Dad, Pads,” Remus said softly. “I’m not here to replace James or you.”
“That was very nice of you, cousin,” Luna spoke. “Thank you.”
“Hello Luna,” Draco said in his monotone, bored voice.
“I deny ever having part in that,” Hermione said, sticking her nose in the air.
“So, you just keep them around to finish your fights?”
“Well, he shouldn’t,” Hermione sniffed. “It was bad enough he showed up late to the meeting. He barely apologised, acting like he was doing us a favour by just being there. If I were Dumbledore, I would have given him detention.”
Thanks for reading.
As if knowing his presence was acknowledged, Snuffles let out a soft boof, wagging his tails as he sniffed the new man in front of him.
Harry scratched the back of his head.
Harry watched him as he spoke, listening as Sirius’s voice trembled slightly.
“No Sirius. I fucked up. I’ve been teaching Harry for two years. I should have noticed something, but instead I put it down to him being James’s son, being secretive because of the trouble he was getting himself into. Fuck. I should have noticed. I’m so fucking sorry I didn’t notice.”
“What do you-”
“What have you got there, Harry?” Sirius asked, glancing at the letters in Harry’s hands.
“Really? Why not?” Harry asked, although he already suspected the answer.
The two didn’t speak to each other until they were two streets over. Harry thought things were going quite well, until Malfoy opened his mouth.
Harry reached over to the coffee table, plucking an apple from the fruit display in front of him. He ran it over in his hands, surprised by the rubbery texture and hollow sounds it made. Plastic, he decided.
Anger swelled in Harry’s stomach. How dare Malfoy judge his home. Afterall, the boy was probably raised in a haunted mansion filled with dark, incriminating relics. Harry was about to politely tell Malfoy he could go fuck himself and leave when Sirius spoke.
“My problem is,” Draco crossed his arms, his expression growing dangerous and foul. “That’s my cousin your calling insane. If you have a problem with Luna, you got a problem with me, Finnigan. Call her insane again, and I will end you. Got it?”
He shook his head.
“So, like, he would be staying here?”
Harry stepped into the room, his eyes trained on Mr. Malfoy. The man looked like he had been sucking on a sour lemon, his lips pinched, and his nose scrunched slightly as he looked around the room. When he saw Harry, he stood up. The movement was sudden, and for a startling moment, thoughts of punishments and pain ran through Harry’s mind, causing him to jump back a step. Seeing his reaction caused Malfoy to still, posed in a crouch halfway between fully standing and sitting. The two stared at each other for a few moments, Harry’s eyes wide, Malfoy’s calculating, before the man slowly sat back down. He put his hands up in a gesture of peace, looking like he was trying to calm a frightened animal.
As he descended the stairs, the first thing he noticed is the two guest’s blonde hair. Like usual, Mr. Malfoy had his long hair pulled back, but unlike usual, there was no gel in the younger Malfoys hair. Instead, his hair fell normally, tousled and shining.
Sirius reached towards Harry, bumping his fist against his godsons’ leg.
“What is it?”
“Why not? They deserve to be charged after the shit they put Harry through. Vernon should be in jail!”
(See the end of the chapter for
A knock banged against their front door. Sirius jumped, his hands tightening their grip on Harry’s shoulders.
Ginny snorted.
“Your mum seems really nice.”
“I wasn’t thinking about anything!”
“Oi.”
“Yes well, I did tell everyone I was innocent,” Sirius snarked.
He chatted quietly with Luna as they waited for Draco. Harry no idea what half the things she said were, but he found himself enjoying her company. It was different to hanging out with Ron and Hermione, and even Draco. Unlike the others, Harry never felt any pressure to share with Luna as they talked. She was simply content to discuss whatever interested her, regardless of Harry’s contribution.
The longer he thought, the more he realised how much sense Sirius was making.
“The wish of Lily and James Potter for you to have custody over Mr. Potter before you became an ex-convict will hardly hold up in a court of law, Mr. Black,” he raised his chin, looking down his nose at Sirius.
Draco tilted his head. He did remember that game. He had been making fun of Potter’s lack of hygiene, claiming he had got it from his mother, when Potter threw the first punch. Draco’s father had demanded Potter be cut from the team, but Dumbledore claimed Draco was just as much at fault. Turns out, they had been in front of the teachers stands when the fight started. In the end neither of them was suspended from football. However, they each had to serve two weeks detention.
With a soft breath, Harry walked along the path to the front door, reaching into his school bag to acquire keys. The set of three jingled as he put the largest into the red door and turned. The door opened silently.
“Of course they will. Uncle Vernon is always saying he wants to get rid of me. This is perfect!”
“Alright, Potter?” Draco said it in a way that made it seem like he didn’t care, but Harry could tell otherwise, from the way the blondes eyes looked him up and down.
“Then why are you starting a fight about it?” Harry threw his hands up.
“Do you not believe one can have a change in attitude, Black?”
He made his way to the office Lucius had stalked off to, his chest tightening with each step. Sirius found the correct door, made of red-wood, and entered without knocking. The room was tight, packed with shelves filled with paper, and folders, and books. Files stacked on top of more files filled most the space. Sirius was sure this wasn’t an office of Malfoy’s and wondered which poor sack had been blackmailed into letting them use it.
“Oh.”
The second he stepped in, Harry noticed the house smelt of burnt food and vanilla.
“Don’t mention it, Potter.”
Draco Malfoy stood at the reception desk wearing a white button up shirt and a pair of slacks. His hair was gelled back in its usual style. Beside him stood a tall woman with hair as blonde as Malfoys. She wore an elegant black dress and a brown fur coat.
“We wanted to wait up for you.”
“Your cupboard?” Malfoy asked, alarmed.
Harry and Draco both looked each other up and down. Draco opened his mouth to answer when Harry cut in.
Harry patted Neville on the back, shooting him a sympathetic smile.
Remus shuffled towards the door, Sirius closely following him. While the two bid goodnight, careful of the boy near them, Harry took his chance to slip up the stairs to his room. He tried to listen carefully but was unable to decipher the whispers shared between the two men as they bid goodnight.
“That sounds great!”
“Well, I suppose…” he trailed off, looking puzzled. “I guess it doesn’t feel that quick for me. Not after 12 years in prison. I suppose it might look odd to you, but we have known each other since we were 11, so it honestly doesn’t feel quick at all.”
Harry twirled his head around, unable to keep his eyes on any one spot. Their footsteps echoed around the circular walls. Harry noticed he was falling behind and jogged to catch up with the adults before he got completely lost.
“Well, apparently Lucius was more clued in than I thought. Like I knew he thought his son liked Harry, but I didn’t think the man knew his son was a flaming homo. Honestly, the poor kid could have given me a run for my money back in the day. Anyway, turns out he worked through some shit, and now he is what the teens call ‘tolerant’.”
“Where are you going to go? It’s raining outside.”
“The boys a freak! He deserved his punishment,” Vernon shouted. “All I tried to do was make him normal!”
“No one ever sits with me at lunch. I’d be delighted to have company!”
“Boring as,” Ron replied, dodging the smack Hermione aimed at his head.
She looked back to Harry.
“Basically, this man worked through years’ worth of active homophobia and intolerance just because he really loves his son. Kind of makes you hate your own parents even more really.”
“Do you think I care what you can pay? I am the most sought-after lawyer in Britain, Black. I don’t need to take on any case for the money.”
“My, that didn’t take long. It’s been, what, a year since you left jail. Already falling back into bad habits, I see.”
They stayed together like that for what felt like minutes, neither willing to let go for fear the other would disappear. Finally, Harry pulled back. Sirius held onto him still, his hands holding his shoulders as he looked at Harry’s face.
“Moony, you don’t have to go.”
“Look, I haven’t told Ron and Hermione yet, alright,” Harry heard Draco tut, but pushed on. “In my defence, you know I haven’t even properly told them about Sirius!”
Harry groaned and turned away from Sirius in an attempt to hide his reddening cheeks.
Thank you for all the comments and Kudo's!
Draco stopped smirking at his Father’s words, and discretely dropped Harry’s hand, like he had been caught reaching into the cookie jar. Or whatever the rich person equivalent was. Draco’s mask of indifference returned, and he seamlessly turned into the Draco Malfoy Harry used to call his nemesis. Thankfully, Lucius Malfoy showed no indication he had seen the two boys as they were. Harry could understand why Draco didn’t want his father to see him holding hands with another boy. Shame burned in his own chest at the thought of other people seeing them like that. But it still hurt Harry for some reason. It wasn’t like he was about to call Malfoy out on his weird behaviour though. Harry had been the instigator of the hand holding after all. And their shoulders still brushed against each other’s, which, while a lot less comforting, was much less intimate than hand holding.
Harry thought about all the nights he had spent at Ron’s house, the other boy begging him to move in with him and his family. He thought about Hermione packing a second lunch everyday for him, always giving him any extra’s she had. He thought about how since moving in with Sirius, his friends concern had grown as he spent less days at Ron’s and started bringing his own meals. Though he assured them everything was fine, he knew they had caught on to a shift in Harry’s life. Things became harder for Harry the longer he put of telling them, and now he wasn’t sure they wouldn’t be pissed at him for the entire situation he had put them in.
With a final pat down, Sirius let of Harry, and together they made their way down the stairs and out the front door, bidding goodbye to a sulking Snuffles.
“We better get ready, Harry,” Sirius muttered.
“Stop apologising!”
“Come sit.”
“Not my fault he makes it so easy!”
Sorry for no update last week. Things got hectic!
The heat from the pavement was starting to seep into Draco’s shoes and the beast had been leading him for so long, his legs were starting to tire. They continued along a footpath that ventured away from all manmade buildings and led them into a small forest. The trees were spaced out far enough that Draco could still see around him easily enough, but there was no hint of mankind in the area. Draco could hear the calls of birds flying above and the chirp of crickets around him, but he could not hear the chatter of people, nor the familiar rush of the city.
“Yeah, he gave it to me yesterday,” Harry continued tearing the juice box. “So, you don’t mind if I use the phone? I promise I will be quick.”
Draco groaned.
Sirius nodded. Exhaustion swept over him and he sunk back down into the chair.
“Sirius, what are you talking about?” Remus frowned.
“I’m going to be late,” he muttered, picking up his schoolbag from the floor beside the table.
Remus rolled his eyes. His fingers tapped the edge of his ceramic glass as he thought.
“Figured you could use a new friend, seeing as you kept telling me Ron and Hermione were away.”
At the end of the long court hallway, stood the Dursleys. Aunt Petunia, still skinny, pale, long-nosed, wore a frumpy brown dress that probably costs a fortune but looked like a potato sack. Her lips were pursed, like she had just stepped in dog shit on the way to court. Her pinched eyes were cold.
“Shit, Remus…” Sirius breathed. He shook his head slightly. “I mean, I figured you would have noticed… you and James were the first to pick up on how my mum treated me.”
“What a…,” He paused in thought. “…charming home you have. ‘
Sirius chuckled.
“What!” Draco shrieked.
He barely had time to apologies before another body was knocking into him, sending him flying to the ground. He could feel the sting of his cut palms before he saw the red cuts. His arms began to shake violently, making it harder for him to pull himself up from the ground.
Harry was about to ask the man a question when he heard Sirius shouting his name from up the street. From the side, Harry was now able to see Sirius in the crowd. His godfather was frantically searching for him, shoving people out of the way as he looked. Harry lifted his arm up, waving slowly for his godfather to see. He could tell the moment Sirius noticed him, relief spreading across the man’s face as he threw his back and ran through the crowd to his godson.
“Oohh,” Sirius chuckled, his teeth gritted. “You really haven’t changed, Cissy.”
“Can Draco come over again tomorrow?” Harry asked. He fidgeted with the hem off his shirt as he waited for the answer.
Harry just smirked at his godfather.
When Harry and Sirius exited the car, each bid goodbye to the two Malfoy’s. Harry desperately tried to make eye contact with Draco, but his sight was stuck on whatever was outside the window. It was when Harry got to the front door, he realised Draco didn’t even say goodbye.
“Harry,” Sirius groaned, before crossing the living room to wrap his godson in a tight, warm hug. “You are not crazy, and I would never say that you were. Do you understand me?”
“Jeez, your stressed? I couldn’t tell,” Malfoy responded, rolling his eyes. “Relax, Potter, Father said he would win your case. Trust him.”
“What would you have me do, Father?” Malfoy drawled out. “I doubt there is much to do in a place such as this.”
His nodded at her words, but his stunned expression gave away his disbelief. When he finally reached his last present, an engraved silver pocketknife from Sirius, Harry was at a loss for words at the pile of things he had accumulated.
“Um,” Harry frowned. “Good.”
Instead, when Sirius called him down, he took the stairs slowly. He made no noise. Harry peaked into the living room where Sirius was setting the coffee table up with tea and biscuits. He waited at the edge of the room behind the wall.
‘Oh!”
“We’ve been fighting since we were 11, Harry.”
“I know. But you’re upset about something. I can tell. Nargles are swarming your head.”
“Uncle Vernon used to say horrible things all the time, and mostly I didn’t care, but he always used to say bad things about people like you, and how they deserved bad things, and I just used to hate it so much, but I couldn’t say anything because then he might think that I was like that and I was sure he would kill me!” Harry panted. “And I didn’t know you were like that, but now I do, and all I can think about is what he used to say he would do if he ever saw someone like you and I don’t want anyone to hurt you Sirius! I just found you.”
Harry took a moment to think about what Draco was asking him.
Anyway, hope you enjoy some Wolfstar, I hope it isn't too OOC.
Sirius hummed, nodding absentmindedly. His eyes were unfocused, and he looked lost in thought.
When Sirius failed to notice him, Harry opened his mouth to force the words out. Before he managed though, he heard a small boof, and looked down to see Snuffles spread across the couch and Sirius’s lap. He was cramped in the small space but looked in no way close to moving. He wagged his tail as he lolled his head back to look at Harry.
“Um, never. Ron is just always around to back me up. Plus, you drag him into it by harassing him until he cracks!”
The hallway was nearly deserted when he stepped out. The cheers of students echoed through the walls from the field outside. Harry tried to keep himself distracted by counting the cracks in the stone floor as he walked, his steps slow and deliberate to buy himself time before reaching the lunch grounds. He had reached a count of 36 when he was startled from his thoughts by a warm hand wrapping itself around his mouth, another gripping his arm, pulling him into an abandoned classroom.
Sirius was the first to jump out of the car, beating The Driver outside. Throwing Sirius a filthy look, The Driver walked to Harry’s door, holding it open for the boy to exit. Harry tried to smile at the man, but it closer resembled a grimace. Sirius stuck his tongue out to the driver, before opening the passenger front door with a flourished bow. A deep sigh sounded from inside the car, and Remus Lupin stepped out, wearing black slacks and a white button down. It was the nicest thing Harry had ever seen his teacher in. Rising to his full height, Remus smacked Sirius upside the head, before straightening his shirt and making his way to the stairs where Harry was standing.
“Pads, I know you didn’t ask me here to gossip about random strangers.”
“I’ll be fine Sirius.”
“No, not at all,” Fleur responded. “That lovely boy is Snuffles. He is beautiful boy but has been here a very long time. One day, he stopped getting up when we brought people in. He lost hope of adoption. It has been very sad.”
“I should get something on for dinner,” Sirius’s voice was hoarse. “You need to go clean up.”
Honestly, feels like my writing just keeps getting crappier, so sorry about that. I'd like to use the excuse I rushed the latest chapters, but you may have clued in to the fact that all my work is rushed.
“Trust me, Harry. It’ll be fine. Just hurry up and tell them before they find out some other way. It’ll be worse if you aren’t the one to tell them.”
“Hey bud.”
“We talked about a couple of things, but most importantly, the thing I wanted to bring up with you, was the possibility of me seeing Remus again.”
Sorry this was a bit rushed. Thanks for all the kudos and comments!
Malfoy stepped into the hallway, his cane thumping against the floor with each step. He looked around the home, sniffing the air.
“Nothing is ever that easy for me, Malfoy. Haven’t you noticed?” He paused for a moment.
Harry did as directed, and slowly sunk down on the grass strip next to Snuffles. He gently reached his hand over to dog’s large black head and gingerly ran his fingers over his ears. Harry repeated the movements until the dog eventually lifted his head to look at Harry.
“What? No!” Harry defended. He glanced towards the door, listening as footsteps retreated down the hallway. “…are you messing with me?”
Huh, Sirius thought. He remembered his cousin had been pregnant the same time as Lily, but he never thought much on the subject. For the first time in a long time, he felt hopeful about their situation.
“Hello, Harry,” she spoke in her dreamy, kind voice. “What’s wrong?”
“Very well. We will see you both again tomorrow,” Lucius picked up his brief case and cane. “Draco, say your goodbyes. We’re off.”
Harry’s breath was erratic, and his wide eyes looked at Malfoy in shock. He thought over all the things he had told Mr. Malfoy to help win their case, the statement he had made against his Aunt and Uncle. He tried to wrap his head around his thoughts as he realised Mr. Malfoy could have been lying to him about winning. Harry had not known what Sirius was paying and he certainly didn’t doubt Mr. Malfoy was capable of double crossing them. As the thought washed over him, Harry could feel his Uncles hands around his throat trying to wring the life out of him.
Lucius tutted.
“Shhh! Relax Potter!”
“Really?” He couldn’t keep the shock from his voice.
Harry turned his attention back to his friends, noting he was flanked either side by Ron and Hermione, who were waiting for his response with puzzled eyes. Hermione frowned like she was unaware there was even a problem to begin with. Harry blinked before looking at Ron.
Harry nodded again, slower, less convincing.
Sirius sighed, before beginning to pat down Harry.
“That’s not fair on you, Pads.”
Harry was intrigued by the dog’s attitude and walked slowly towards the cage, kneeling to get a better look at the scraggly dog.
“I mean, it’s not a bad idea.”
Potter furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco looked to Harry and felt the overwhelming need to apologize. He wasn’t even sure what he would be apologizing for. Today, for their past, for finding out why his father was representing the other boy. It all just became to much and guilt was swimming in his stomach, making him feel ill.
The bell finally rang for lunch and Harry couldn’t be more grateful. The class packed up, shoving books into bags, and scraping chairs along the stone floor.
Harry hummed.
Sirius paused, before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Soft breaths were the only noise breaking the silence of the room. Sirius’s eyes searched Harry’s form, his hunched shoulders, creased eyebrows, crossed arms. The sight of his godson’s discomfort made him want to cry.
That pulled a small huff from Potter.
“Yes please, your Honour,” Harry wrung his hands in his lap, clenching them until they turned pale.
“Do you think it’s a good idea? Getting back together with Professor Lup- Moony.”
“It’s not that I don’t want you to be happy, Sirius. This is just a lot.”
“Oh, you know Draco Malfoy. He’s in the same year as Harry.”
“Are you feeling better?” Sirius asked, rubbing a thumb over Harry’s cheek.
“Well, do you think Potter would prefer you adopt his son, or that Harry ends up back in the care of his abusive relative? Honestly, I thought even you could work it out.”
They sat in silence for a few moments. Draco pretended to be watching the television, but Harry knew he wasn’t really interested with what was playing on the screen anymore.
“You’re pale as fuck, Potter,” Draco was looking at him with a raised eyebrow. He kept his voice low to keep his Father from hearing him swear. Lucius Malfoy was much to busy to take note of his sons’ behaviour anyway.
Harry thought about leaving now and getting there early, before he looked down at his clothes. He was caked in dirt and dust from walking Snuffles through the park. He thought about how Draco always looked when they met up. Like a model in a magazine, his blonde hair done perfectly, his clothes well fitted. Harry always looked like a mess in comparison. With that thought, he ran upstairs for a shower.
“It wasn’t good though,” Harry laughed.
He patted his hair down, the half damp frizz remaining untameable. Nevertheless, he ran his fingers through the black curls for a few minutes, before giving up. He nodded at his reflection, before heading down the stairs.
Harry stood by the edge of the staircase, waiting for his chance to escape. Sirius looked to him, panic in his eyes, before looking back to Remus.
“Tell me, how did Weasley take the news? You did tell him we’ve been hanging out this summer, right?”
“Alright, Prongslet,” Sirius clapped. “Why don’t you take all this stuff up to your room while I get the cake.”
“Mr. Potter,” he stepped up to Harry holding his hand out. “My name is Lucius Malfoy. I am going to be your new lawyer.”
Harry drew his knees to his chest, leaning back into the couch.
Harry had been expecting a fight from the other boy. Harsh words that Harry could retaliate against. He hadn’t been expecting this.
“Cool.”
Harry went silent as he thought.
A week had passed since Lucius Malfoy had agreed to be Sirius and Harry’s lawyer.
“Mate, you look better. Did you sort out what was bothering you?” Ron’s question
charges against them.”
“What do you say we celebrate our newest family members adoption with some ice cream?”
Sirius couldn’t help the huff of laughter that came from him. He surged up to steal another kiss from Moony. After another chaste kiss, they sat back staring at each other once again. A quick glance into the restaurant showed that the waiter either didn’t see them, or simply didn’t care.
Draco jumped to his feet.
“The first day Lucius brought Draco over, I realised. I thought there was going to be a fist fight, I won’t lie, but then I brought it up to Lucius, and apparently, he reckons Draco has wanted to be friends with Harry since First Year. Not that the kid would ever admit it, he said,” Sirius gestured wildly with his hands. “And, to be honest, the more I saw them interact, I kind of figured why Lucius thought that.”
“No, course not. I’m proud of you, Ron.”
“There isn’t all that much to do at my house, and because it’s the school holidays there hasn’t been much to keep busy with. I already finished off our library collection and you can only practice so much Football without any opponents.”
So, Harry cries a lot in this, but like, the kid deserves it, he's been through the ringer. Canon be damned.
Fleur looked shocked, her eyes gone wide. She fumbled for her keys.
Harry shrugged. His eyes felt puffy and he wondered if there were bags under them. He had stayed up late last night, watching the light shine from Sirius room through the cracks of his closed bedroom door. He fell asleep shortly after the light finally shut off around 1 AM.
“Honestly, I agree with Harry,” Hermione conceded, mouth pinched like she had swallowed a lemon. “He hasn’t said anything to us all day, and that’s never happened. Especially to Harry.”
“What, so he wasn’t mean to you today, and you decided he’s alright?
In English, Professor Flitwick had played some sort of Shakespeare play which despite its promise of a modern setting and actors, was still just as difficult to follow. Within ten minutes Harry had given up all semblance of understanding and tuned out. Hermione, of course, followed the dialogue perfectly. Harry and Ron both knew unlike the other girls who were simply watching for the eye candy main actor, Hermione knew what was going on. She gasped when the two love interests met and patted her damp eyes when someone was shot. Harry and Ron, as well as most the boys in the class, murmured quietly between themselves, being shushed by the girls whenever they got too loud.
Sirius was incapable of talking, instead jerking his head in attempted nod. Everyone remained silent for a moment, listening to the honking of cars and shouts of pedestrians as they waited for someone to speak. Sirius had gone pale and his eyes were still bulging.
"Given the statements and evidence I have received from a number of parties, I am inclined to grant Mr. Black legal guardianship over Mr. Potter.”
He hurried his steps.
Sirius dug his nails into the palm of his hand and walked faster.
Sirius was a mess. His arms felt itchy, his hands cold despite the heat of the day making his forehead sweat, and his hair tickled his face as it fell from his messy bun. He listened as Harry and Remus made senseless small talk, flittering around any real topic. When the waiter came over, he mindlessly ordered from the menu, uncaring of what would arrive.
When he arrived back home, Sirius was sitting on the couch. He was staring at the television which was turned off.
The longer he thought, the more he realised he had seen Luna before at school. On the way to classes, eating lunch, even sitting on the grand stand watching soccer. Harry had never noticed, or most likely never cared enough to, but she had always been alone.
“Well, I teach geography as my core subject, but I take on Philosophy for the senior elective’s.”
“Yes, Draco,” Harry stood, walking over to stand in front of Draco. The other boy tried to sidestep him, but Harry grabbed his arm to keep him still. “Stop it!”
Thanks to everyone commenting and all the kudos, they are beyond beautiful.
“I’m fine. No one will believe me if I go forward, and what if they did. I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
“What like, proper dating?”
That had been the night he left home. At least the Potter’s didn’t mind who he was.
“It doesn’t matter, Malfoy. This is just about making Sirius my legal guardian. They refused to sign the paperwork, and things… escalated. Now, well, I just…I don’t…”
“Thank you so very much for letting me join you tonight,” Luna smile was bright. “Would you like a ride home?”
“But your pretty sure, right? I mean, I can see why. The attitude itself is pretty obvious.”
“So, you have no idea what he is representing me for? My god, that must be killing you.”
Harry swallowed, but his mouth was so dry it hurt.
Surprise!
“You married my cousin, Narcissa Black.”
Vernon locked his eyes on Harry. His breathes came in short, sharp pants, rumbling the folds of neck fat spilling over his tight collared shirt. Vernon shifted his feet on the carpet floor, and Harry knew his Uncle was getting ready to charge. Sirius seemed to realise this too, and jumped to his feet, throwing his arm around Harry, trying to push the boy behind him. Harry stood, and was about to bolt, spotting a window not too far from his reach, when out of nowhere, the security guards pounced on Vernon. They wrestled with the overweight man until each had a hold of his arms. Sandwiched between the two muscular men, Vernon could do no more than scream abuse at those in the courtroom.
“Alright. That sounds good.”
Draco spoke quietly, his head low as he looked to the ground. Harry felt another surge of guilt.
“Um,” Harry coughed to get their attention. “I’m over here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry put his head down. His chest had already been brimming with anxiety about the thoughts of this summer, and Malfoys words succeeded in increasing the panic within him.
Harry hadn’t. He had been so stressed out just from the thought of asking Malfoy if he wanted to hang out, he hadn’t planned this far ahead.
“Soon, alright! The longer Harry stays out of this, the better it is for him. He doesn’t need to know all the details, ok Malfoy.”
“He was living with Lily’s sister, wasn’t he? Petunia. Why is he with you now?”
The rest of the class had made their way out of the classroom already, leaving him with Professor McGonagall. The teacher finished gathering her notes from her desk. Harry tried to quickly sneak out before she noticed him.
One of the things I have always headcannoned, is Sirius being really good for Harry in the way that he lets him act his age.
“You don’t look comfortable with this, Harry,” Sirius said instead of answering the question.
The rain outside had drifted off to a simple sprinkle. Though it was impossible to tell how late in the evening it was, it was nearing the time when Draco had to leave.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled.
“Why do you care so much about them knowing?”
“I know you live with your relatives, of course, and I understand if you wanted to stay with them,” Sirius said. “But… if you ever wanted a different home … well my name has been cleared now.”
“It’s nothing,” Harry whispered. At Ron’s blank stare, he conceded. “I’ll tell you at break.”
“Harry, buddy, are you alright?” Sirius was sitting up now, looking at Harry with concern.
Sirius carried the two brown bags, smiling at his godson as they walked down the street. Despite being an enormous dog who was probably much stronger than Harry, Snuffles did not pull against Harry’s grip. Instead, he contently walked between Harry and Sirius with his head held high and his tail wagging. The walk home Harry repeatedly thanked Sirius, gushing about Snuffles and how amazing this surprise had been.
“That seems wise, Harry.”
The lobby walls were lined with movie posters. A man and a woman kissed on one poster, and Harry averted his eyes quickly. Another was a classic action movie, a still shot with explosions and cops on the cover. He saw Draco roll his eyes at it, and he knew they wouldn’t be seeing that movie. Harry kept looking.
“Mate, about the whole prefect thing. Are you sure you aren’t mad?” Ron whispered.
All things considering, the Judge seemed quite nice. His black hair was peppered with grey, and his glasses were like the pair Harry owned, round with gold rims. The robe he wore looked bizarre to Harry, but he supposed that came with the job. Overall, he didn’t seem like a bad person. Which was lucky, considering he held the fate of Harry’s future in his hands.
“I understand, Malfoy,” Sirius whispered. “Why didn’t you just send them off without you? It isn’t like they need to stay for this.”
“Alright,” Sirius looked over to the kitchen and the pages covering the table. “Looks like it might be another takeaway night.”
They didn’t live too far away from central London. If Harry wanted to go, it would only be a quick bus trip to the town.
“And we have two parties vying for Guardianship over one Harry Potter. Is that you, son?” The judge smiled at Harry.
Awkwardly, he wrapped his hands around her back and patted. Once she let go, Ron pulled him in roughly. When he let go, he ruffled Harry’s head, leaving his thick black curls even messier than before.
“Good morning, Mr. Potter,” Mr. Malfoy greeted Harry first, pulling off his jacket and placing it on a small hook Sirius had installed when they first moved in.
“I don’t mind. Whatever you get is good.”
“Fine. Deal.”
Harry knew there was no way he was getting out of this. Begrudgingly, he nodded.
“What’s it about, Harry? You need to talk to me here,” Sirius through his hands up, frustration leaking through his words.
“Good to see you, Cissy,” Sirius returned the hug. They kissed each other’s cheeks.
At the end of the Friday session, Mr. Malfoy collected the files that littered the kitchen table. He chatted to Sirius, scheduling the upcoming week meetings.
Finally, Luna’s expressionless blank face faded, and she gave Harry a small, saddening smile.
“Actually, Sirius,” Harry said, pealing the wrapper off his juice. “Would it be ok if I called Draco and asked if he wants to hang out?”
“Parkinson comes over often?”
‘Huh,” Sirius said, before shaking his head in a manner resembling a dog. “Oh, uh, yeah, I’m fine, Harry. Sorry.”
The class slowly started pulling out their books, manually flipping through pages. Hermione looked the only one pleased to be given actual work on the Friday afternoon before summer break. Even Malfoy and his crew looked like they had no intention of working, setting up in a small circle to chat. As they worked through the lesson, Malfoy started talking, quietly enough not to be heard by Snape, but loud enough for Harry to pick up.
“That’s because you’re an idiot, Potter.”
There was silence as he waited for her to say something. Instead, she just glanced curiously at Luna.
“Science, Maths and Geography,” Luna stated, smiling at Ginny.
Sirius had a mischievous grin across his face, and he glanced to Professor Lupin who was trying to hide his own amusement.
“I know that!”
“I’m alright. I just need suck it up. Now, go to your meeting.”
Harry didn’t know how long he was stuck to the footpath. He could feel footsteps walk around and over him. He was unable to move. His legs felt stiff and immovable and his arms were jello. The longer he stayed down, the surer he was that he was going to die, either from the stampede of people who were soon to get sick of stepping over him, or from suffocating.
“Well, our friends aren’t aware of us calling a truce. There is no way they are going to understand if we show up to school this year suddenly acting like friends.”
“I thought Crabbe and Goyle were your best friends?”
“It was my fault. When I went to prison, I was in a really dark place. I was mourning your parents and I was so angry at myself for being stupid enough to believe Pettigrew. I just couldn’t handle seeing Remus. The guards would tell me when he had come to visit, and I just couldn’t let him see me like that, so each time, I just refused visitation. Eventually he stopped coming.”
Harry gestured between them, backing towards the staircase.
Harry thought about how hard it would be for him to that after calling the man Professor Lupin for two years. Instead of telling Sirius that, he simply nodded.
“No way!” Harry shouted shrilly, ignoring both Sirius and Remus who chuckled at his reaction.
“Well, I did help with that.”
“Does it matter?”
Mr. Malfoy didn’t even take time to think before answering.
“Well, this is something Sirius should be talking to you about, but I feel this is something we should also discuss with one another. Your godfather and me, we were discussing the possibility of me staying over one night,” the car jerked, hopping a few beats before beginning to move again. “Now, I completely understand if that is something you don’t feel comfortable with Harry, especially if you are struggling right now. I just wanted to let you know and keep you in the loop with everything as Sirius and I progress in this relationship. If you don’t feel comfortable with me taking this step, I completely understand…”
