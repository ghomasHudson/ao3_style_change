"Are you okay?" Harry notices Draco sounds so uncharacteristically nervous and it makes his heart flutter.
"You do realise he's staring at you." She says and Harry looks back over at Malfoy. Sure enough he's looking at Harry with a very odd expression on his face and when he sees Harry looking he blushes and turns to Pansy.
"Hey." Harry smiles when he sees Draco near the entrance to the quad, walking over to him and sitting on the wall next to where he's standing.
"Yeah, maybe. Sirius used to say he was going to see a therapist at some point. Died before he could, but if he thought it would help him then it can help me." Harry says, a look of sad longing in his eyes, and McGonagall smiles.
"You don't have to play just cause Blaise is trying to cheer me up." Harry says quietly to Draco whilst Blaise is getting his broom and the snitch. Draco looks at Harry surprised.
"Did you really mean what you said last night?" Draco asks and Harry opens his eyes to look at Draco.
"I know about the book." He says, wanting to punch himself because of all the ways he could have said that he made himself sound so stupid. Draco's eyes widen slightly.
"So we're gonna run a bunch of drills, but first get into groups of which position you want to be. Chasers there, Keepers there, and Beaters there." Harry says, pointing to each place the groups should stand, and the Gryffindors divide into their desired rolls.
Harry's walking back from quidditch practice when he sees Hermione and Malfoy talking across the courtyard. At first he thought Malfoy was being a dick to Hermione as usual, but then he realises Draco is relaxed against the wall and Hermione is actually smiling at him. It almost looks like Malfoy is flirting with her. Hermione starts to walk away but when Malfoy calls "thanks Granger" after her she turns and smiles at him. She actually gives Malfoy a legit smile. And he gives her a smile back. Granted it's not as genuine as the ones he gives Harry at night but it still awakens the green eyed monster in Harrys gut.
"You saved me first." He says with a small smile and Draco tries so hard to suppress his smile but Harry still sees the corners of his lips twitch upwards.
"Harry?" Blaise asks, looking at him carefully, just in case he's dizzy and might pass out or something.
"I love you too." He says and Harry smiles, leaning forwards and pressing a kiss against Draco's flushed cheek.
"I used to love watching you play too, Draco, don't worry." He says and Draco blushes deeper and Harry remembers yet again how great it is to make Draco blush.
"For a walk." Harry says as he shoves on his converse and grabs his hoodie, not bothering with a top.
"Hey, mate." Ron says and Harry looks up as he finishes tying his lace. He nods in recognition before pulling off his jersey and pulling on a t-shirt.
"No they won't babe. You'll be under the protection of the chosen one. No one will fuck with you because if I can defeat Voldemort who knows how many times and survive the killing curse twice then I can curse a kid that hates my choice in relationships." Harry says before kissing Draco again.
Harry says the password, knowing Draco won't use it so he doesn't bother whispering, before leading a very apprehensive Draco through the hole in the wall. There's only first and second years in the common room when they enter as everyone is still in Hogsmeade. Most of them turn to see who has entered and when they see Draco a few look shocked.
"Okay, I'm gonna tell you something I've only told a handful of people. And I'm only telling you because you already know. I do love him, so much it hurts, but that's the problem, Blaise. Loving people hurts." Harry sighs again, his voice breaking at the end, and Blaise smiles sadly at him.
"So you have a tattoo?" Draco asks trying to change the subject but also curious. He's wanted to cover his dark mark with one ever since he got it, even more so when the Dark Lord was defeated, and whoever did Potters could do his.
"You also saved so many people, Harry." And it's the first time Harry has ever heard Draco call him Harry and his heart skips a beat. Harry wants to believe him but he doesn't. He just stays quiet and continues walking with Draco next to him, their little fingers still linked.
"There are 7, actually. But third year. Fred and George had a map that my dad and his friends made and it shows the secret passageways." Harry says, proud of his dad and Sirius and Remus for being more mischievous than the Weasley twins.
"I'm not sure that's a good idea, Professor." He says, not wanting to let her down but also not wanting to do it.
"Thank you, Potter." He says sincerely and Harry smiles, looking him in the eyes. Suddenly an announcement sounds to let eighth years know their curfew is in 10 minutes and Draco bites his lip.
The train arrives and Harry takes his time getting off, making sure to shove his book in the back pocket of his black skinny jeans, wanting to avoid the crowd of students. He feels the eyes of the people around him burning into him and shoves his hands in the front pocket of his hoodie that belonged to Sirius. He catches Hermione's eye as he walks towards the carriages, his heart breaking when he sees a lot more students can see the thesterals pulling them. Hermione smiles slightly at him and he takes a deep breath before walking over to her, Ron, Ginny and Luna.
Narcissa knows there's something going on that Draco hasn't told her, and it's not that he doesn't want to, it's just that it's awkward and he's worried about how she'll react. They're sat eating dinner, and Draco has barely looked up at her.
"Come on, at least come and sit in the common room rather than on this cold step." Blaise says, standing up, and Harry hesitates before standing up and following Blaise down to the common room. Blaise says the password and enters before waiting for Harry to enter after him. The common room is pretty empty save for a few students still working or chatting, and when Harry see's Draco his heart flutters slightly. He's sat by the fire and it's casting a warm glow across his face, which looks so soft and calm and serene that Harry almost doesn't want anyone to interrupt him.
"Harry?" He whispers, sitting next to him and running his hand through his hair. Harry forces his gaze onto Draco, who stops moving his hand through his hair and rests it on Harry's cheek, wiping away the tears with his thumb. He holds the spare hoodie up and pulls it over Harry's head, and he breathes in deeply, smelling nothing but Draco, before Harry leans forward and presses his forehead against Draco's, squeezing his eyes shut.
"Please Blaise. I promise I'll go to Pomfrey if I need to." Blaise looks conflicted and Harry feels bad.
"What else did she say?" He asks and Draco sighs, his nose is resting just above Harry's ear and he can smell his shampoo and it's intoxicating.
Harry flies straight towards the snitch at the same time as Draco and Blaise, and just as his fingers close around the snitch they all collide and fall off their brooms, luckily they're only a few feet off the ground, and when they land they land in a heap, all of them laughing.
"Come on, mate." He says, wrapping his arm around Harrys shoulders, and Malfoy glares at the back of Seamus' head as he leads Harry down the hallway.
Harry strips off his joggers and hoodie so he's only wearing boxers and climbs into his own bed, a thing he hasn't slept in in weeks. It feels too big without Malfoy next to him, but he doesn't really want to lie with him. That's a lie; all he ever wants to do is lie with Malfoy, but seeing him and Hermione together is an image he can't get over.
"Nothing we wont continue when you get the fuck out." Harry jokes, but he actually means it, and Draco brushes his finger across the back of Harrys waistband, so George can't see, making Harry bite the inside of his cheek.
"He's probably busy, has a big family. Don't worry about it now, we have a party to go to." Harry says, looking like he's not looking forward to it but also like he really doesn't want to talk about Ron and his other friends. Draco nods, smiles slightly as he presses a soft kiss to Harry's lips.
Also How is everyone? I complain about my life all the time but I haven't checked in on you in a while so what's going on?? How is everyone? Shit family life? Feel sick? School/work sucks? Friends are arseholes? I been through it all my dudes so I got you <3
"I'm proud of you." Draco says and Harry grins, walking over to Draco and wrapping his arms around him.
"Not now, Blaise." He says, voice solemn yet pleading, and Blaise knows that Draco can't do that and it's breaking his heart, so he lets it go.
"You seem kinda stressed. Also you're actually talking to me without punching me in the face." Draco says, referencing when she punched him years ago.
"Thank you, Ron." Draco says and Ron nods before walking out of the classroom. He still doesn't like Malfoy, but he cares about Harry and considering Malfoy actually had a conversation with him without insulting him, he must doÂ too.
Draco can't stop looking at Harry. It's been 4 days since Harry fell asleep with his head on Draco's lap. 4 Days since Draco saw the sketch book. It's all he can think about. Especially today. He saw Harry sitting in the corner of the library with the sketchbook open in front of him, and Draco is wondering whether Harry is drawing him again. Harry hasn't said anything since Monday; He's gone back to how he was when they first came back to Hogwarts. He's closed off and silent and does nothing but work and he goes on at least 3 runs a day. Draco can't help but wonder if it's because of him. Harry was getting better, and then he stopped that curse and fell asleep with Draco there and now he's like this again.
"Why was he there?" He asks and Harry looks at him with such an intense sorrow in his eyes that it breaks Draco's heart.
"Not true. You've been going on and on about Draco since first year." Ron says and Harry chuckles when Draco blushes dark red.
"So, like, when are you gonna start a DA type class but for quidditch?" Ron asks and Harry bites his lip.
Sorry I took so long! I like to have a big backlog of chapters ready to go so if I get writers block I don't need to make you wait that long, but I've only got 3 written currently and I have major writers block so I was putting off posting but I'm hoping my brain starts working again soon! Fingers crossed!
"And when I'm with you." He says after a few seconds, sounding a lot more confident than he expected he would. Dracos hand pauses in his hair for a split second before Harry feels him relax slightly against the headboard and his fingers continue threading through Harry's hair.
âNope.â He says, eyes still shut. Hermione rolls her eyes and pulls Harryâs arm so heâs forced to get up. When Harry is standing he walks to Draco's side of the bed and leans over him so he can see his face.
"I mean, until Dumbledore made them give me Dudley's second bedroom when I was 12 the cupboard was my room." Dracos jaw drops.
"I'm sure, Harry." Draco says, loving how sweet Harry is. Harry presses a kiss to Draco's forehead before pulling him into a kiss, which Draco immediately deepens. As they kiss Harry walks Draco over to the bed and pushes him onto it, not breaking their kiss as he crawls on top of him and leans on his forearms so he's touching Draco but not crushing him. Dracos legs are wrapped around Harryâs waist and his hands are running all over Harry's body whilst Harry's handsÂ in Dracos hair, loving how his usually neat hair is an absolute mess and is so soft. They stay like this for a few minutes, just kissing and feeling and loving each other, before Draco wants more.
So I know I usually post once a week and I posted a few days ago but It's my 20th birthday on Sunday (2nd June) so I thought I'd give you all a present and post a new chapter :D
During dinner Harry goes for a run, contemplating everything McGonagall spoke about and deciding that yes she's right but he's not strong enough to lose Draco, not yet, so he won't do anything about it and he'll have to deal with the fact that he's completely in love with him. Harry makes his way to the Slytherin dorm room after dinner, and his chest fills with nerves when he sees Draco sat on the sofa by the fire. He thinks again about what McGonagall said, but decides, again, that he can't do anything about his stupid feelings, so he walks over and sits down with a small sigh that he didn't think anyone would hear.
"Yeah, I finally had inspiration for a new one." Draco blushes slightly as there's a tapping on the window. Harry looks up and sees an owl, so he opens the window, takes the letter and strokes the owl before returning to the floor next to Draco. He recognises the writing as Andromeda's and frowns slightly as he opens the letter.
"Harry I know this is the least of your worries but you should eat. We have classes today." Hermione says and Harry sighs, the tears have stopped now and his eyes hurt.
"I..." He's not sure where he was going with that sentence; he doesn't think he has an ending in mind.
"It is not a problem, Mister Potter." Winky says and Harry forces a smile before taking a sip of his drink. It's still very hot and Harry can feel it burn all the way down his throat. He welcomes the heat as it slowly spreads throughout his body, along with the heavy blanket that's wrapped around him to warm him up. He stays in the kitchen for a while before sighing. He's exhausted. He know's he is. All he needs to do is go up to his dorm, fall asleep, and hopefully not dream about the war. He know's this is too much to ask, though. He can't remember the last time he actually slept without waking up gasping or sweating or crying. He drags himself out of the chair, letting the blanket fall off of him, puts his mug in the closest sink, and takes a deep breath before leaving the kitchen. He makes his way up to his dorm, dreading getting there because he has no idea where his friends are, and when he opens the portrait he finds his friends are nowhere to be seen. Harry shouldn't feel hurt or upset by this, but his heart aches nonetheless.
"I see you and Potter have decided to put your childish feud behind you." She says knowingly and Draco blushes involuntarily.
I'm sorry it's been so long since I updated this but guy's it's happened again. Writers block has taken over and I am stressing out. For some reason I have no motivation to write. I'm hoping it will go soon and I'll be able to bang out a few chapters at least, but I've currently only got half of the next chapter written. It's frustrating as hell cause I know what I want to write I just can't, you know?
"Come in." She calls and Harry opens the door to see three sixth year Ravenclaw's sat opposite her desk.
"Is he still here?" He mutters bitterly and Harry chuckles as he gets off of Dracos lap, kisses him softly, and goes to open the door.
"I wasn't going to." Harry says, voice quiet and wobbly as a tear falls from his eye. Draco reaches over and wipes it away.
"Now let that memory fill you, feel it spread from your heart to every inch of your body. Then hold out your wand and say expecto patronum." Harry says and Draco bites his lip, holds his wand out and says what he was told to, thinking of the memory. A tiny silver spark comes out of his wand but quickly vanishes and Draco sighs.
"Not really, Edgar Gaunt is here with a rather dreadful looking woman." Pansy starts, "Stephanie Burke has had a child with a half-blood and has been pretty much shunned by everyone. Oh," She smirks, "Brandon Avery is here." Draco tenses, and Harry frowns.
"I know you didn't, love." Harry whispers and Draco shuts his eyes and leans his forehead against Harrys.
"See this is the problem. I love you loads Georgie but he doesn't get that I have been in love with Draco since I was 15 and I'm not gonna be fucking you because I've got him and I love him. Does Ron really think I'm that much of a shit person that I'm gonna cheat on Draco with the brother of my best friend?" Harry sounds hurt and Dracos heart basically bursts; Harry's been in love with him since he was 15? So he did used to fuck George. Draco's gonna have to figure out a way to bring that up subtlety and ask him about it.
"You know, I do actually do work sometimes." He mutters and Hermione smiles at him, before nodding at Ron and then at Draco before raising an eyebrow. Harry just rolls his eyes at her. He hasn't officially told Ron that him and Draco are together, but he knows Ron isn't stupid and can easily put 2 and 2 together.
"I'm sure it'll be fine." He says, trying to convince himself more than he's trying to relax Draco, and Draco laughs quietly.
"5 more minutes?" He asks and Draco knows Harry needs all the sleep he can get, so he shifts closer with a dramatic sigh and an equally dramatic eye roll.
"I don't mean for forgiving me. Thank you for speaking at my mothers trial, and at mine. I know you didn't need to and honestly I didn't think for a second you would. So thank you." He says and Harry's smile grows slightly.
"Shit! Hermione can you watch Teddy?" Harry asks, already passing him to her as he and Ron run to the quidditch pitch and into the changing rooms. He forgot it was the day of the first match of the season. They hurriedly change into their quidditch robes and grab their brooms before getting ready to go onto the pitch.
"Well it's more than you said in September." He says, taking Harry's bag from him and gripping his shoulder. Harry glances at Draco long enough to see him smile in his direction before Draco and the station disappear and he's stood in front of 12 Grimmauld place. Kingsley enters the house first, something about making sure there's no one hiding there despite the countless protection charms on the house, and Harry walks in behind him. It's clean and bright and he can tell Kreacher has lit Harry's favourite candle somewhere because it smells of his white vanilla bean candle, along with the distinct waft of pie coming from the kitchen. Kingsley puts Harry's bag in the living room before turning to Harry, looking nervous to leave him on his own.
When the three of them get to the quad Harry's eyes widen when he sees three Slytherins and Ron, Seamus and Dean in a fight. Harry quickly casts a spell that wraps invisible ropes around each of their stomachs and pulls them apart from each other and they're all so surprised by the sudden interruption that they don't even struggle.
Harry decides as he drags himself out of bed that he's not even going to pretend to eat anymore. He doesn't care enough to keep up the illusion anymore. He's too exhausted to do anything and honestly what's the worst that could happen. He goes to the library and sits in the back corner. He wants to giveÂ Draco's book back to him, and thank him for it, but he's not sure how he can go about doing that. Harry sighs and rests his head in his arms on the desk. He's so damn tired, but he doesn't dare fall asleep where he is, knowing that he'll almost definitely wake up crying or screaming and he really doesn't want that to happen in a library. He hears someone sit down opposite him and someone else sits to his left, and only knows who it is because he can smell Draco. They sit in silence for a few minutes before the person opposite speaks.
"How did you find out what I told him anyway? Surely he didn't tell you." She asks and Harry blushes slightly.
"I want to cover it." He say and Harry nods. He knows Draco keeps his mark hidden, so him showing Harry his arm makes Harrys heart swell. Draco trusts him enough to show him.
"Alright what happened yesterday?" Hermione asks when Harry gets to breakfast the next day and he looks up from staring at his bowl of cereal, Teddy is sat on Ginny's lap and Harry can hear Seamus and Dean talking to some Ravenclaws on the table next to them about the rules of the tattoo pool. Harry figured they were the ones to start it.
"You know, the strangest thing happened though. Turns out someone was being thoughtful and gave him his book." Blaise says knowingly and Draco blushes slightly and looks down at his parchment.
"You look great." He says, sounding a little bit nervous but a lot in love, and Harry walks closer to him as Narcissa busies herself with going to find her bag.
"I will force that down your throat." He says and Harry breaths a laugh when Billy shouts "ooh kinky."
"You're perfect for each other." He says, voice quiet and genuine. Draco blushes, but his hand doesn't stop threading through the mess of curls on Harry's head.
Harry reluctantly walks into the great hall after 40 minutes of running. He doesn't know what to expect when he enters, so he pauses in the doorway. He sees Ron looking at him expectantly and then Rhys waves him over and he glances at the Slytherin table to see Blaise watching him carefully. Harry takes a deep breath before deciding he can't deal with this. He doesn't enter the hall, instead walking to the kitchen. He knows McGonagall will be mad if he doesn't eat and he figures eating in the kitchen again will be okay. He knows she saw him and he hopes she realises he's going to the kitchen and not skipping the meal.
âIâm having a boy! Iâm having a son! Oh my god Iâm gonna have a little boy!â James says excitedly before grabbing Lily in a hug.
"I mean... My cousin was often rebelling against pure blood ideology, however you can't deny he looked good doing so." She jokes, and Harry chuckles, nodding. He can't deny that that is true.
"Same time next week?" Harry asks. He really enjoyed talking to someone about everything that has happened, especially someone that wasn't there.
"Oh well that narrows it down." Harry mutters sarcastically and Draco rolls his eyes as there's a knock on their door. Harry debates whether or not he should get off of Dracos lap when the door opens to reveal Hermione.
"I mean probably but I don't care. If you want we can go nap in my bed or in the Slytherin common room, but if we go upstairs these first and second years are gonna make some assumptions anyway." Harry says quietly and Draco hums in agreement, already feeling himself falling asleep, what with the warm fire and Harry stroking his hair rhythmically, it's only a matter of time before Draco is asleep. He's lying on his side, facing the back of the sofa, his legs bent up so he's curled up and his face turned towards Harry's body. Harry smiles down at Draco when he notices his breathing gets even, continuing to run his hand through Draco's hair softly.
Harry hears a knock at the door and shouts for the person to come in as Teddy flies past him to get the snitch again. The door opens and Draco walks in, smiling when Teddy flies past him.
"Okay gentlemen. Take a seat." McGonagall says as she sits at her desk, and Blaise and Draco sit nervously opposite her.
"I'm fine." He mumbles quietly, knowing he's lying but not being able to make himself feel guilty. He sees Malfoy frown out of the corner of his eye and wonders what he's thinking about. However he can't exactly go and ask him so he just bites his lip and looks down. He puts his textbook in his bag and stands up, not knowing where he's going but knowing if he has to look at the worried pleading look on Hermione's face any longer he's going to break down.
"And have you eaten anything?" Harry presses his lips together and avoids the gaze of the three people around him.
I'm gonna be honest though lads, I don't have any more of this written. I've planned out each chapter and know exactly how I want them, but actually writing them seems like such a huge task right now. I'm hoping my brain gets better soon, and I'm going to try really hard to actually give you another chapter soon, but I can't promise anything â¥
Harry thinks as hard as he can and after a few moments a door begins to materialize and Harry slips inside the room quickly, noticing the group of Ravenclaw girls round the corner ahead. The room he is presented with has a sofa and a few armchairs, a fireplace, a standalone mirror in the corner and a bookshelf lining the far wall. It's warm and welcoming and cosy and he collapses onto the sofa on his back, finally stopping to catch his breath. It's a Saturday which means there's no classes but also means there's more people to stare and whisper and giggle. Harry casts a quick spell to see what time it is and see it's 10am. He's only been awake for a few hours and he's already had to escape. He decides to stay here and hide until lunch time. He keeps an eye on the Marauders map, having decided he's not going to lunch until he knows Hermione and Ron are already there.
"Er, I think he's in our common room." Harry bites his lip and runs a hand through his messy hair before looking back at the girl.
Draco falls into a shocked silence when he finishes reading and he closes the notebook with slightly shaky hands. Harry takes it from him and puts it in his bedside table drawer whilst Draco takes a deep breath. He guesses Draco needs a few minutes to actually comprehend what he just read. Draco has no idea how Harry is still a functional human after everything he's been through.
"May I have your attention please." McGonagall calls as she stands up to address the students. "I am glad to say I can finally announce who the Quidditch captains for each house are." The hall erupts into chatter and excitement and Harry shrinks down slightly so he's less visible.
"He can stay with Madam Pomfrey whilst you are in lessons." She says before adding "you will stay in the room of requirement, security charms have been cast on it for you, as there isn't enough space for him in your dormitory. All of your things as well as Teddy's are already there." She says before walking out of the hall. Harry turns to Hermione and Ron, who are looking just as baffled as Harry feels, and then down at Teddy.
âItâs not your fault, Draco.â Harry mumbles as he breathes in Dracos scent. Draco notices Harry breathing in deeply and smiles slightly.
Draco stares at the door long after Harry leaves, thinking about what he said. This mood he's in has something to do with Granger? Or Draco talking to Granger. Now Draco's the confused one. Maybe finding and talking to Granger would help? But if Harry's mad at the fact that they're talking then maybe it isn't the best idea? Either way Draco needs to ask her about what just happened.
"Hey Harry, you're very welcome. Oh, just so you know, there's a pool going about your tattoo." She says as he picks Teddy up and smiles the smile that he reserves for Teddy, and Malfoy, but he doesn't know Hermione knows that.
"That. And cause I've kind of got used to being with you every day." Understanding flashes across Draco's face.
At the end of the lesson Harry waits until the rest of the class have left before leaving the classroom. Blaise is waiting for him outside and he smiles when Harry leaves the room.
"Doesn't mean we weren't worried, mate." Dean says and Harry nods, putting his hands in his pockets.
"Shut up. Seriously..." Draco takes a deep breath. "Do you think your parents would like me?" Harry wasn't expecting it, and he can hear the nerves in his voice and he can't help but squeeze him tighter.
"That would be telling, Potter." He says and Harry rolls his eyes before walking over to pick up Teddy and put him in his crib.
Draco sees Harry lying in Grangers lap and he feels jealousy bubble up inside of him. He can't hear what they're saying but at some point the conversation turned serious, if the small frown etched onto Harrys face is anything to go by. He sees Harry walk into the castle and decides they can talk later.
"Nothing I just didn't like the way that woman was looking at you." Harry says and Draco looks past Harry before looking back at him.
"Technically ran away in third year. Thought I was gonna be expelled from here cause I used magic at home, blew up my uncles sister, so I packed up my stuff and left."
"She said you never blamed me. She said you don't think I deserve the curses people throw at me." Draco says and he smiles slightly when Harry mutters "I do now".
"Darlin did you forget who I am?" Harry jokes, grabbing Dracos hand and leading him towards the common room.
âI look great! Thanks Harry!â She grins, walking back over and sitting on the arm of the chair Harry is on.
"Harry." He mutters against the others lips and Harry pulls away slightly. He looks into Draco's eyes, looking for any sign of regret or doubt but all he sees is love and lust.
"Maybe I should get a shirt with your face on it so people understand to leave you the fuck alone." Harry says and Draco chuckles.
"Stag?" He asks and Harry smiles, yet again casting the Patronus and Teddy giggles as it gallops round the room and stops in front of him, bending down so Teddy can see its face.
"I don't go that often either, and when I do Professor McGonagall makes me go with Hermione and Ron and she makes sure Hogsmeade is full of aurors. And we can only stay there for an hour before the crowd gets too excessive." Harry says before adding, "But it's Teddy's birthday and he's my godson. And your cousin." Draco sighs.
"Not if I love you too." Draco whispers, his grip on Harry's arm tightening again, and Harry looks at him carefully, as if reading him, and after a few moments he releases a breath he didn't know he was holding.
"Oh yeah, I'll be fine." Rhys says, and Harry knows he's not going to be able to keep up with him but carries on running anyway. Harry can run for hours on end, his longest run was 5 and a half hours. It was just after the war and he kept running until he was on the verge of passing out because he just needed a distraction. He knows this is probably not normal and definitely not healthy, but there's only an hour until dinner so maybe Rhys can keep up until then.
"I miss you." He chokes, not able to say what he really thinks because it'll worry his parents and Sirius and Remus will hate it too.
"Are you okay?" Harry nods, turning back to his essay, and Draco resists the urge to roll his eyes. "Harry?" His voice is soft and Harry knows he can tell he's lying. Harry sighs, putting his quill down and sitting back in his chair, resting his head on Draco's shoulder. Draco threads their fingers together and Harry lifts their hands to press a kiss against Draco's knuckles.
Dracos gaze follows Potter as he walks into the hall and sits down, and he can't help but glare when Finnegan leans close to him. Heâs been doing that a lot lately and Draco does not like it.
âDo I still smell the same?â Draco asks, trying to cheer Harry up. Harry nods and leans back to look DracoÂ in the eyes.
"And that's why you need to eat." Draco mutters and Harry rolls his eyes as they reach the bottom of the staircase. The common room is empty except for a few students who pay Harry and Draco no attention as the two leave through the portrait hole. Harry doesn't want to face anyone at the moment so he just makes his way to the kitchen after saying goodbye to Draco. He's not hungry, so he sits in the kitchen for a while before leaving, the food Winky put on his plate untouched, and he makes his way to herbology.
"You're here!" Draco calls, and Harry looks away from Narcissa to see Draco walking over to them and Harry is fairly certain his brain has short circuited because
Harry is sat on his bed reading a book, leaning against his headboard with his legs laid out in front of him, crossed at the ankles, wearing nothing but joggers, when Draco walks in. It's been about half an hour since his talk with Hermione and Harry hasn't stopped thinking about what she said. He hopes it was all true. He looks up as Draco walks in the room and nods in acknowledgment before looking back down at his book. Draco hesitates before walking over to Harry's bed instead of his own.
McGonagall smiles when Harry accepts the food from Draco. She's always known there was some thing between the two boys, some sort of connection neither of them understood. Granted she wasn't certain what it was exactly, but she knew they were meant to be more than just childhood rivals. She doesn't believe in fate, per se, but she knew the two boys would end up together somehow. They've always been the biggest factor in the other improving themselves. Granted for the most part it was because they were determined to be better than the other, but there's something in the back of McGonagalls mind that tells her that was definitely all just a facade. She's just glad they both realised the true meaning behind their connection and have done something about it. Draco needs Harry, just as much as Harry needs him.
How is everyone? Work sucks when you've got absolutely fucking useless colleagues but you know, you just gotta keep going and hope one of these days they get fired.
"Absolutely she does." He says before looking up at Draco, admiring how pretty he looks. Draco looks down at him and notices him staring.
"Ah you're back!" Narcissa puts her book down on the table and stands up, walking over to them. "I was going to meet you in the entrance hall." Draco smiles.
"It was the least I could do." Draco says and Harry smiles. They realise it's time for dinner so they both pack away their things and walk to the great hall together, Harry holding Teddy. When they reach the hall they split off and go to their respective tables.
"Maybe he's gone for a run?" Dean asks and Ron shakes his head. He, Dean, Seamus, Hermione, Ginny and Luna are walking the halls of Hogwarts, hoping they find Harry soon. He's been missing since 7pm yesterday, when he left the hall at dinner. They're used to him going to bed after they're asleep and disappearing before they wake up, but his bed wasn't slept in and no one in Gryffindor had seen him.
"We both know I know whats going through your head right now." Harry mumbles before gathering every ounce of courage he has and pressing a soft kiss below Dracos ear. Draco swears he stops breathing for a second and he freezes before he feels Harry do it again. His heart is racing as he wraps his arms around Harrys waist and he feels Harry smile against his neck. He pulls back slightly to look into Dracos eyes and see they're full of lust, love and nerves. He's certain his are the same. Harry still can't help but tease Draco, though, so he smirks slightly.
"He, erm, he told me he loved me." Draco says, still looking at Harry. He's smiling about something but it's bittersweet.
"Harry Potter is protecting a death eater?" The boy asks and Harry shoots a death glare that makes the one speaking falter.
"Nonsense Potter, we were just finishing up." She says before turning back to the students, who look shocked at actually hearing Harry speak for the first time since he's been back. "So are we agreed that Miss Ramsey will tutor in Transfiguration, Mr Haywood in Potions, and Miss Gibson in Astronomy?" She asks and the three students nod.
"That's my goal. I'll see you tomorrow, I gotta go tell a guy I love him." Harry says, kissing her grinning cheek and leaving the hall, feeling Draco's eyes on him. He runs up to his dorm room and grabs his wand, map and invisibility cloak, stashing the wand and map in his pocket and charming the cloak so it's smaller and putting it in his pocket, before he goes out into the quad and sits on a wall facing outward, so Draco will see him as he leaves the hall but also so he can enjoy the view.
"Well I didn't want to. But I gave the twins my tri-wizard tournament winnings so they could open the shop in the first place and they insisted." Harry says as he reaches the shop. There's always a few people in the shop, even when school kids aren't in hogsmeade, because everyone loves it.
They stay and chat on the bridge for a while and Harry realises that he hasn't spoken to Ron properly in a while and it's actually nice to sit and talk to his best friend. Ron leaves after an hour or so and Harry gets off the railing and stands leaning against it instead, enjoying the view. After being alone for a few minutes he feels someone lean next to him and grins, not even looking over to see who it is; he already knows.
"She offered me some potions and stuff, but if I take them then the second they wear off everything will be twice as painful."
"Okay, congrats on making the team everyone. First we're gonna warm up so just, you know, fly laps." Harry says and he and the team mount their brooms and start flying laps. Practice lasts an hour and a half, and ends when Harry notices the Slytherin team waiting to use the pitch for their practice. He lands and calls his team over, praising them for a great first practice, then walks over to Blaise and hands him the key to the chest, trying not to look disappointed when he realises that Malfoy isn't on the team.
"You two are distracted by each other, Harry. You heard him. He knows everything about you. He knows you don't eat and he knows you've been different with us too. I didn't tell him that stuff." She says before smirking.
"I miss you." He whispers before dropping the stone into his pocket and watching as the people disappear. He wipes his face on his shirt before taking a deep breath and starting to walk back to the castle. He wanders aimlessly around the castle before sighing and making his way to the quad. He sits on the wall, leaning against one of the arches with his feet up and knees bent, and pulls out his book. He's gone through 5 of McGonagalls in the past few weeks, and he's now back to pride and prejudice. He still has no idea where it came from, and whoever gave it to him has not yet asked for it back. He opens it and scans through it again. He only read it once, and he didn't look at the pages for a clue as to who the book belongs to. There is nothing in the book that gives away where it came from, apart from small neat writing on the title page in the top right corner that reads
"It's okay. We missed you. How have you been?" She asks as they climb into a carriage. Harry just shrugs.
"Not entirely, however I am not going without you." He smiles, and Harry can't help but smile back, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
"Harry you should see his face when you're not looking. You should see him when you're asleep. You should hear him when you're not around. It's the same as how you look and sound." Harry sighs.
"Alright, to warm up you just gotta fly round the outside of the pitch and avoid the bludgers." Harry nods down to Dean, who opens the box and releases the bludgers. Harry watches and makes note of the people that have trouble flying or dodging, and after a few minutes he blows the whistle andÂ lands by Seamus and Dean, everyone following suit.
"You're the reason I'm alive too." Harry says, and he means it in more ways than one, and Draco smiles a beautiful smile that makes his eyes sparkle.
As soon as the first bite is in his mouth he realises just how hungry he is, and he all but inhales the entire plate of food. Kreacher, who had made up his own plate and was sitting opposite Harry, smiles proudly.
"No he's not." Malfoy says, glancing at Harry before looking back at Teddy. Teddy reaches out his tiny hand and grips Malfoy's thumb and Harry smiles slightly as he sees Malfoy's eyes immediately soften. Teddy looks at Malfoy for a second before letting go of his thumb and flinging his tiny arms around Malfoy's neck. Malfoy automatically places his hand on Teddy's back before looking at Harry and glaring.
"Why can't we come in?" Draco asks nervously when Madam Pomfrey refuses him and Blaise access to the hospital wing, assuming something bad had happened.
"Yeah. Yeah okay. Thanks, Kreacher." Harry reluctantly walks down the stairs and apparates to the Manor. He appears just outside the front door, and knocks quietly.
"Well can you gallivant up to your dormitory?" She asksÂ with a smirk, easily reacting to the banter with banter.
"What do you want, Weasley?" Blaise asks and Ron looks at Harry, ignoring the Slytherins either side of him.
"Thank you so much, Granger." He says before leaning against the pillar next to him and looking at her.
"Thanks Mione, you're the best!" He says before he and Ron grab their brooms and make their way to the quidditch pitch. They change and make their way outside of the changing rooms and when the whole team is ready they start practicing. Harry loves flying, it makes him feel so free. He sees Teddy sat on Hermiones lap in the stands, smiling as Hermione points him out to the toddler and he watches Harry fly around. Practice lasts about an hour and a half before they decide to call it a day. As they're getting changed Katie Bell turns to Harry.
"Could we- maybe like... Is tomorrow too soon? But it would have to be, like, after 3 ish, if that's okay? Cause I promised my team we could go to hogsmeade together." Harry stutters and Pomfrey nods with a smile.
"I almost killed you." Harry mutters, leaning back up to look Draco in the eye, hovering above his face.
"They still need work, but thanks. You too." He says, pouring the syrup into the cauldron as Blaise stirs. The liquid goes from a bright pink to a deep blue.
"I'm hurting you?" He asks, lessening his grip on Harry's arm. Harry shakes his head, as if desperately trying to make Draco understand without saying it out loud, but Draco isn't getting it and Harry needs to tell him. He needs to say the words, and he needs to pretend he isn't terrified of the reaction he'll get.
"I can't." He says and his heart is racing and all he can think about is Fred and Sirius and Lupin and Hedwig and Dobby and Colin and there's screams in his head and before Hermione can say anything else Madam Pomfrey is rushing over.
"Party in room of requirement." He says excitedly, leading Harry towards the castle, Dean throwing his arm round Harrys shoulders from the other side. Harry chuckles at the two and wraps his arms around their waists, Ginny taking his broom for him.
"But... since when?" He asks and Harry shrugs, seeming so confident that Draco's annoyed he's such a nervous mess.
"Dude, did you not get my book?" Seamus asks when Ron sits in the armchair he occupied a few minutes ago. Ron frowns for a second before realising what he was talking about.
"Good. Now get yourselves to your common room." She says with a small smile and the three students stand up and leave the room.
"You wanna come in?" Harry asks and Draco bites his lip before nodding and wow that was attractive. Harry opens the door and lets them both in before shutting it and walking over to the sofa, sitting on one end whilst Draco sits on the other. Teddy gets down but looks at Harry with wide eyes.
"Who did it?" Draco asks and Harry looks at him for a second. Everyone else would ask what or where it is, not who did it.
"I started to. It made my head spin." Harry says, which is kind of true, he can't read too much without feeling dizzy at the moment.
"I..." Harry whispers before realising he doesn't know what to say, or how to express his fear to Draco. Draco strokes Harry's cheek with his thumb and Harry sinks into the pillow.
"You know, Harry doesn't stick up for just anyone." She says quietly and Draco frowns slightly, looking over at Harry, who has his back to the table.
It's 12am the next day when Harry finally finishes reading the books and thinks he has an understanding of how the stone works. He takes a deep breath and runs his hands through his hair before standing up and picking up the books. He puts them all back on their respective shelves before leaving the library. He walks down the stairs to the entrance-way, intending on going to the forest, but runs into Rhys and Will from his team.
"Er, yeah. Okay." Draco smiles slightly as he makes Harry a cup of tea and Harry feels his heart swell because he's the one that put that smile there.
"Hi." He says, awkward because Malfoy is looking at him with slightly worried eyes and his eyes are a beautiful silvery blue and Harry doesn't want to look away.
"It's not a problem, my boy, do come in." Harry follows professor Slughorn into the class. Harry sits at his regular desk in the corner and places his bag on the table before pulling his homework out of taking it to Professor Slughorn.
Lily appears in the front room, a baby bump showing now, and sits next to James, who grabs her hand in his right and places his left on the bump.
Everything seems meaningless. He assumed he'd be dead by this point, figured he'd die before he was old enough to legally drive or drink or do anything, really. Before he was old enough to live, like his parents did. But he didn't and now he has to think about a future he never in a million years imagined he would have. He doesn't know how to plan for anything further away than a few months, because more than that has never seemed plausible. Now he knows he could have 30, 40, 50 years, he's not even sure he wants them. He's given up entirely, and he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do, so he just runs. He runs and he doesn't stop, even when the wind stings as it hits his eyes and the rain burns his freezing skin and the ground hurts his feet with every step.
"Draco." They all turn to look at the person talking, and Draco tenses when he sees who it is. Harry squeezes his hip, and Draco presses himself into Harry's side.
Harry and Draco lie down, connecting their bodies as if it's second nature to them, their legs slotting together and their arms winding round each other, fitting perfectly together as if they're pieces of the same puzzle, made to slot together. Tonight is different though, because they usually lie in a less intimate way. They always fall asleep with their foreheads pressed against each other and holding hands between them, so even though their legs are touching, there's a small gap between them. And yes, they wake up completely wrapped together, but doing it in your sleep is different. Tonight though, Harry slots his arm under Draco's neck and Draco presses himself flush against Harry's chest, his face pressed into Harry's neck. Harry wraps his arms around Draco, burying his face in his hair. Neither of them know why today is different, or why Harry suddenly had the confidence or nerve to pull Draco close or why Draco let Harry pull him close and he buried himself in Harry's chest. Neither of them notice Blaise's soft smile and eye roll as he climbs into his own bed either.
"I er, know the password... Where's the boys dorm room?" She frowns for a second before realisation crosses her face.
"Hey Harry I'm gonna run into hogsmeade real quick, you want anything?" She asks, not even acknowledging the position the two boys are sat in. Harry looks over at her and smiles.
"There you are!" Blaise says as he enters their dorm, immediately freezing when he sees Harry lying in Draco's bed. Draco carefully moves his forehead away from Harry's before turning to glare at Blaise, his fingers still buried in Harry's hair.
"I just don't see the point in prolonging the inevitable. It won't work, or it will end badly, or he doesn't love me back, or he'll get sick of me, or sick of the press, or-"
"Harry, you seem to forget just how many people you saved. Me included. More than once. And I don't think any of the people that didn't make it blame you. They would be thrilled to know you made it. You're their hero, Harry." Draco says as he's speaking so softly and Harry sighs again. "What was the other reason?" When Harry frowns in confusion Draco clarifies. "You said that was mainly the reason. Is there anything else?" Harry hesitates before nodding .
"I'm not tired, Draco." He says dismissively and before Draco can say anything else Harry is grabbing his wand off of the bedside table and leaving the room.
"Harry," Ron says, as if he want's to ask him to stay or where he's going but deciding against it, and Harry just slings his bag over his shoulder and walks out of the library, not missing the way Malfoy watches him when he walks past.
"You will continue to be 'stuck here', Mister Potter, until you learn that eating and sleeping are basic requirements for those whom want to stay alive." She says as she walks over to the Ravenclaw, who laughs. Harry rolls his eyes.
"I'm okay with it, by the way. Well, I'm working on it. He seems to care about you, like we had a 3 minute conversation and he didn't insult me once." Ron jokes and Harry smiles.
"Well, I'm gay. And I'm kind of in love with Malfoy." Harry says after taking a deep breath and he expects Ron to go mad, but he doesn't.
"I know this is a bad time, but I never hated you." Draco says nervously, a light blush spreading across his cheeks, and Harry half smiles lazily.
"Don't bring that up. How could you forgive him? And how could you tell George before me?" Ron asks angrily before standing up and walking away.
He can't stop thinking about Malfoy lately. The way the sun shines through his hair making it look like he's glowing, the way his grey/blue eyes shine, the way he was looking at Harry when he was lying in the hospital wing. Harry thinks about Malfoy for slightly too long, imagining what it would be like to kiss him, and touch him, and hold him. His hands are so soft and Harry would kill to feel those wrapped around him. Harry moves his left hand slowly down his body, imagining it was Malfoy, and when he reaches his dick he lets out a shaky breath. His hand wraps around his dick and starts to slowly stroke his length and Harry shivers despite the hot water still running down his back. He pumps his dick steadily, picturing Malfoys lips pressed against his and his body flush against his and his hands in his hair and after a few minutes Harry is gasping as he arrives, head spinning and he's not sure if it's because of the wank or because he didn't open the window and the shower is boiling and the heat is getting to him.
"Okay. I think that's enough practice for today." Blaise announces through breaths as he slowly composes himself and the two teams turn to look at Harry and Blaise.
"I'm fairly certain that 13 year old Draco would either just not believe it or jerk off." He says and Harry smirks.
"It does. However is it not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?" Harry frowns slightly and McGonagall continues, "Love usually ends in pain or sadness, Harry. But if you can have years, months, or even just weeks, full of happiness and love then surely it's worth it?"
"He told me to tell George he's watching over him. He told me to tell Charlie to marry Oliver. He told me to make sure you are okay and Ginny is coping. But he told me not to give you the stone." Harry explains, his voice steady but tears streaming down his face, and he finally looks at Ron to see he's crying too.
"Well I was. But I was going to have to go no matter what. At least now I will have Harry there to make it slightly more bearable." Narcissa smiles.
Harry walks over and sits in his usual seat next to Seamus and Draco goes and sits next to Pansy just as the bell rings.
âYour turn then.â Pansy grins and slides onto the floor in front of the chair, Harry taking her place on the seat. Pansyâs hair is a similar length to Harryâs and straight as a ruler, and heâs only ever done Hermiones before which is long and bushy, so itâs different, but he starts a single french braid in the centre of her hair that he brings back before tying it into a bun. It takes 5 minutes and his fingers move with practised ease and Blaise and Draco arenât talking anymore; theyâre both wondering when the hell Harry learnt to do hair. When Harry finishes Pansy stands up and poses dramatically.
"I was worried about you." He says, absentmindedly running his fingers over the scars from the sectumsempra curse.
When he gets to his dorm room he walks over to his bed and sighs, flomping down onto it. He sits on his bed and finishes the essays he was given as homework before sighing. He falls onto his back before rolling onto his side and he looks at his bed side table for a second before sitting up and opening the draw, pulling out a notebook and opening it. He shuffles back so he's sat against his headboard and starts to read through it, feeling the need to feel the pain all over again. In the notebook is a list. One long list of every shit thing that's ever happened to him. Hermione once said years ago that writing things down helps you get over them. it's not true. He just has physical proof that they happened.
Reunited and it feels so goooood!!! We have a Harry/Ron reunion people!!! We've gone from a code red to a code blue!!! Yes I do realise this means we have to change the light bulb ;)
"We've got half an hour til dinner. I'll meet you there." He says, patting Rhys on the shoulder before turning and continuing his run.
"Well just before herbology Seamus asked why I won't talk to them and I had a bit of a breakdown and shouted at him and I guess he told Ron." Harry explains briefly what happened and McGonagall nods.
"So why did you tell him before Ron?" Draco asks, hoping Harry tells him about what happened between the two.
"Harry they were so excited about you, and they were so happy. Harry you are so much like your father. And Sirius was there for every milestone." Draco says and Harry bites his lip. He can't help but imagine how close he would have been with Sirius had he not gone to Azkaban or died. From the memory he saw he was really close with Sirius. And his dad was so excited about him being born.
"I think it's more he doesn't trust Draco. But what's important is that you do, and that he trusts you. Being in a relationship with no trust is like being on a rowboat with no oars. You can paddle with your hands but in the end you'll not get anywhere and you'll be exhausted." Draco smiles slightly, he does trust Harry.
They spend the rest of the afternoon in the common room and after dinner Harry and Draco go up to their room.
"I just feel like I'm constantly behind on school work. And you're not the same person you used to be. You weren't rude or hateful so I had no reason to be rude to you. And I am kind of sorry about that. I feel quite bad." She says, smiling slightly and Draco chuckles.
"And then I sort of said I love you too." Draco says and he's blushing but smiling so bright and Harry's heart stutters.
"I was just about to leave but I thought I'd come say bye. You speak to Ron?" He asks and Harry goes back and sits just in front of Draco so he can lean against him, sort of how he used to sit with George.
Draco's eyes dart to Harry as he enters the hall, his hair is still a beautiful mess but his eyes are no longer red. He walks over to his friends at the Gryffindor table and sits in between Seamus and Hermione. He looks really confused and Draco wonders whether it's because of him.
"Oh so you get quidditch and we get who knows what that is in that forest?" He asks and Dean sighs, grabbing his hand and pulling him towards the forest, Luna following behind them.
When he gets to the common room he sees Hermione, Ron and, surprisingly, Draco sat on the sofa by the fireplace. Draco is the first to notice him and when he sees Harry's smile he smiles.
"Harry is something wrong?" She asks and Harry's gaze automatically snaps to the blond haired Slytherin across the hall.
"Well why would he rather talk to a snake than to us?" Harry sighs before deciding to put a stop to this. He opens the door, walks over to his bed and sits down. The room went silent when he entered, and no one speaks as Harry changes from his quidditch boots to his trainers.
"Harry I don't think you understand that, for my whole life, I have heard stories about you, listened to my father and the other followers plot against you, heard your name constantly. I've spent the last 8 years constantly aware of where you are and what you're doing." Draco whispers, keeping his eyes shut because this feels like a confession he shouldn't admit to. Harry is silent just long enough to make Draco regret it.
"What do you want from me, Ron?" Harry asks. He can't be bothered to beat around the bush, he just wants Ron to get to the point so he can read his book.
Harry praises his team, gives them tips or pointers, claps each of them on the shoulder or back as they leave the pitch, except Ginny, who is still being arsey with him, and thanks Rhys when he offers to help put the trunk of balls away. They grab a handle each, and once the chest is safely inside the storage cupboard Rhys and Harry make their way over to the pitch entrance. Harry can see Draco leaning against the entrance and presses his lips together to hide his smile. He didn't really think Draco would stay for the whole practice but he's glad he did.
"I can teach you how to cast one?" He offers and Draco smiles. He would get to learn an amazing spell and get to spend time with Harry as he does so.
"Potter, you're early." McGonagall says as Harry enters the empty class. He's only a few minutes early.
"Because it's getting worse, Mione. I dreamt about him last night, and I feel weird when I'm near him and I blame you entirely cause you said people find guys more attractive if they're good with children and let me tell you yesterday in the library he was amazing with Teddy." He says and she smiles slightly.
They wait quietly until Harry knocks on the door and pushes it open. He's wearing joggers and a hoodie and his hair is a mess as per usual. He looks between Draco and McGonagall a few times before frowning, confused. Draco smiles slightly because how could Harry not tell him he chose to room with Draco.
"Yes sir." Harry says, and Pansy grins. They spend the next half an hour talking, and at 10pm, when Draco is leaning his head against Harry's thigh again, Harry's fingers carding through his hair, and Pansy is drifting off with her head in Blaise's lap, they decide to go up to their dorms.
Draco can feel his heart racing as he looks into Harrys eyes the whole way up to the bedroom, and when they get there Harry tugs on Dracos hands and pulls him closer before wrapping his arms around Dracos waist again, neither of them caring about the fact that they're both naked.
Also for when you want to wish me a happy birthday because I'm great and you all love me my insta is @achievement.unlocked I expect a message from each of you.
He walks along the river before walking over to the whomping willow. He throws a stone at one particular part of the trunk before running towards the tree and climbing through the hole by the roots before the branches of the tree start moving again. He follows the pathway until he reaches the door to the shrieking shack and he walks straight up the stairs to the bedroom. He tidies the room with a quick spell and makes the bed decent enough to sleep in before he collapses on top of it on his back. No one will find him here, people still think it's haunted so no goes to the shrieking shack and only Ron and Hermione know about the pathway but they won't bother looking here for him. Harry climbs under the duvet and sighs. He hasn't slept alone in weeks and he misses lying next to Malfoy, but he can't see him right now. He just hugs one of the pillows and falls asleep.
At some point Harry stops rubbing his temples and instead wraps his arms around Draco's waist, his eyes drifting shut as he rests his head against Draco's back, the two of them just sitting together. Draco smiles slightly, his head still resting on his arms, and when he hears Harry's breath even out as he falls asleep behind him Draco moves one arm to rest his hand on top of Harry's. Draco doesn't let himself fall asleep because they have Herbology in half an hour, so instead he just relishes in the feeling of being hugged close to Harry's chest. He listens to Harry breathing, rubbing the back of Harry's hand softly, and he can feel the even movement of Harry's chest against him, and he needs to wake Harry up soon but he doesn't want to because he wants Harry to sleep but he also does not want to move.
"Ron it's not that big a deal though." Harry says and Ron looks at Harry for the first time since Harry said it.
"Avoiding having to watch you and Draco make out in the middle of the shop." She says smirking and Harry shrugs one shoulder before turning to Draco.
"And do you feel you can talk to mister Weasley now?" Harry thinks for a moment before looking down and shaking his head.
"And there's the added bonus that you're flustered and hard. Which is always hot." Harry says, stepping onto the same stair as Draco and pressing him against the column that goes up the center of the spiral staircase.
Firstly, it's the one year anniversary of me posting the first chapter of this fic... How crazy is that?!
He opens his curtains slightly to see everyone is still asleep in their beds and sighs. He wants to think it was just his mind making that up, but he still believes it. He watches Ron for a moment as he sleeps peacefully and knows all he has to do is look into his mind and see what he really thinks. It would take seconds, and Harry got so good at legilimency that Ron wouldn't even notice what's happening. Then again Harry isn't sure he actually wants to know.
Harry reads the letter and frowns sadly at it, he only has one more day with Teddy, but he's seeing him on his birthday which is great. Harry wonders why Draco hasn't been writing home though.
"Harry James Potter you are a pain in my arse!" Hermione calls after him, grabbing the attention of the people around them, and Harry laughs.
Guys I'm sick :(  Prey for me to get better soon please cause I feel like I've been hit by 27 busses consecutively
"You wanna talk?" Seamus asks and Harry shakes his head. Seamus sighs and squeezes Harrys shoulder tighter before leading him down the corridor on the left and up some stairs until they're in an empty classroom. Harry sighs and sits on a desk and Seamus shuts the door and sits next to him.
"When my dad was at school he and his friends used the shrieking shack because Remus needed a place to stay when it was a full moon so he didn't hurt anyone. People thought his howling was ghosts or something and assumed it was haunted. But it was just my dad and his friends." Harry explains.
"Draco, if you don't want to it's okay. I don't want you to say that just cause you think it's what I want to hear." Harry says, cupping Draco's face, his fingers brushing the bottom of Dracos hair and his thumb stroking his jaw.
"Harry, I made you seeker in first year for a reason. You are a great seeker, the youngest in a century, and the best I've ever seen. I made you captain because, not only does the team listen to you, but you are a great teacher and you help people work together. I believe you are and always will be a brilliant player and captain." McGonagall says, and Harry nods.
"I'm fine." Harry says, but it's the first thing he's said in a while and his voice doesn't sound right. Malfoy looks at him for a few seconds before shaking his head slightly.
"I'm sure he's fine, Granger." He says as the common room door opens and Harry walks in. He notices Malfoy and Hermione sat together and just looks down, walking towards the stairs that lead to his dorm room.
"Honestly what am I going to do with the pair of you?" Madam Pomfrey asks, exasperated, as she walks over to Harry.
"I might." Harry kisses him again, fingers playing with Draco's hair, splayed out on the pillow under him.
"So tell me everything!" He says excitedly and Harry shrugs, pressing a kiss against Draco's knuckles before going back to playing with Draco's fingers.
"What's wrong, Potter?" She asks, pressing her hand against his forehead before wincing. "Okay, lets get this hoodie off you." She grabs his hand and pulls him so he's sat up and Harry takes his hoodie off. He accidentally grabs his shirt in the process and pulls it off with his hoodie but he's so hot and drowsy and tired that he doesn't care. The second he's rid of his hoodie and t-shirt madam Pomfrey lays him back against the bed.
Draco watches Harry sleep for a while, admiring how fucking beautiful and peaceful he looks, before looking around the room. He's never been in Gryffindor common room before, let alone a dorm. His eyes travel to Harry's bedside table, the photo of Harry with someone Draco doesn't recognise, next to a photo of Harry and Teddy.
Harry doesn't go straight to the common room, instead deciding to wander round the castle. He quickly cuts this short, however, when he turns a corner to see Malfoy and Parkinson standing close together, Parkinson's hand gripping Malfoys arm. Harry feels his heart shatter as he rushes back round the corner before either of them notice he was there. Harry didn't hear what they were saying, (if he did he would have heard Pansy teasing Draco for how pouty he was during dinner when Harry didn't show up, and Draco threatening her and trying to shut her up. Pansy was only holding Malfoys arm so he couldn't escape her teasing) but where Harry was stood it looks like something very different. Harry feels a stab in his chest as he walks back up to the common room. He knows he has feelings for Malfoy, he's had them for years, he just hadn't realised just how bad they were. Seeing Malfoy and Parkinson together was like someone had tied Harry's windpipe in a knot and left him struggling to breathe.
"Sorry Finnegan, but I'm no longer available." Harry smirks before sitting back in his seat. Nothing would have happened between them anyway, I mean they flirt shamelessly all the time but only on the very rare occasion does anything actually happen and most of the time the flirting's harmless.
"She said you wish the curse had worked, because then you wouldn't be living with the guilt." Draco says softly into Harry's ear and tears continue to stream down Harry's face.
"Well okay then." They start making the potion, Harry just listening to what Blaise is saying, and when he adds the four fire seeds he realises that they are making the pepperup potion.
He's looking at a perfect drawing of him. Every single detail is perfect and if Draco wasn't physically holding it he would think it was a black and white picture. Draco turns the page with bated breath, and almost chokes when he sees another picture of himself. The more he flips through the book the more his feeling of love for the boy on his lap grows. Not every picture is of him, but most of them are, and every one is beautiful. Draco closes the book and puts it back before looking down at Harry again, wondering how long he's been drawing him. The first picture must have been from before summer because there were a couple of drawings of the castle after the war. Draco just looks back down at Harry and starts threading his fingers through his hair again. He would do anything to make Harry okay again, but for now he's hoping this is at least keeping nightmares at bay.
"Or what? No escape, Malfoy." Harry says daringly, his face inches away from Dracos. Dracos breath catches and he realises he literally has no escape. Harry is blocking him from all directions; and he kind of loves it.
"And are there other motives for your blooming friendship with Mr. Zabini?" McGonagall asks with a knowing smirk and Harry frowns.
"You and Draco." Blaise says and Harry takes a shaky breath in, shoving his hands in the hoodie pocket.
"I was told that everyone evil was from slytherin. I knew an evil wizard killed my parents and I didn't wanna risk going the same way Tom Riddle did." He says and Draco places his hand over Harry's heart.
"It is best if we leave him to rest for today, but hopefully he will be in his classes tomorrow so you will see him them." Draco and Blaise aren't happy about it, but they both want Harry to get better so they agree to leave him be for today before making their way to their next class.
Harry collapses onto the bench next to her, opposite Ron and Ginny, and sighs, resting his head on his arms, which are crossed on the table. Being center of attention is tiring, but avoiding being center of attention is exhausting.
"What are- what- we- you- I don't know." Draco struggles before giving up, ending with a sigh, and Harry figures what he meant to say.
"You can stay if you want." He says and Draco looks at him for a second before looking at Harry, who just shrugs and holds a hand out to him.
"I'll be right back, Harry." Blaise says and Harry nods, slumping back against the pillows. Madam Pomfrey goes to find some sort of potion and Harry realises he's alone with Draco. Draco is stood awkwardly at the end of the bed and Harry has to stop from smiling at how cute he is.
"What do you wanna do?" Harry asks Draco, knowing the trip to hogsmeade probably didn't have the best affect on Draco and he probably doesn't want to do much.
"Draco, when are you gonna tell him you love him?" A blush instantly spreads across Dracos face as he settles back down on the pillow.
"Harry are you okay?" Blaise asks and Harry bites his cheek and gives Blaise a sort of pained look that says 'no but there's people near by, including Ron and Hermione who have just left the hall, that can hear us so I won't actually say that.' Blaise seems to understand, because he nods slowly and steps slightly closer.
Okay so story time, I am so scared that you're going to hate how this happened so please let me know what you think? I had SO MANY different ideas for how I could have written this moment but I figured blurting it out mid rant in the middle of a breakdown in the Slytherin dorm room kind of perfectly fit Harry in this story and I am so hoping you all agree with me! I was literally so nervous to post this chapter so if you hate it let me know but in a nice way so I don't have a full on breakdown.
"I'll bring Draco with me." Blaise smirks before turning to walk away, leaving Harry sputtering and feeling slightly nervous.
"I know it's nothing to do with me but I figured someone should check on you." Blaise says softly and Harry looks at him, seeing genuine worry, and he sighs.
"My dragon likes you too so we're even. Maybe our dragons can be best friends." Harry jokes and Dracos eyes drift to Harrys still exposed dragon before looking back at his.
"I can't- I need to-" Harry grabs his bag and walks out of the classroom and down a corridor, sitting on a windowsill in a slightly hidden alcove, and within seconds Blaise is in front of him. His hands are shaking and his head is spinning and he is getting really fucking tired of his stupid brain being so fucking loud.
"I'll come." And the grin that Draco gives him makes all the nerves Harry felt about the party worth it.
"Alright you got me, what do you want?" He asks and she rolls her eyes before she walks over and sits next to him.
"Helping him. Looking after him..." He pauses, wondering if he should say what he was going to before deciding fuck it. "Loving him." Dracos eyes widen but the blush on his cheeks tells Ron he's right.
"Are you sure you don't need Pomfrey?" Harry nods, his hair falling across Draco's thighs, and Draco has to remind himself to breath. He doesn't really know what to do, so he figures he might as well just commit to this and he slowly starts threading his fingers through Harry's hair, hoping he's helping to calm him down. It must have worked, because after a few minutes Harry's breathing evens out and when Draco looks down at him his eyes are shut.
"I was thinking about Quidditch. Like, your captain offer." Harry starts, and McGonagall nods, not saying a word.
"Oh, I haven't told you. McGonagall said they were going to call her Iris." Harry says and he's smiling and it makes Draco's heart swell.
"Why do you sit with Harry? Like I know you're not a bad guy and all that but you don't make conversation, you just sit quietly. What made you go and sit with him the first time?" She asks and he blushes slightly.
"Why don't you eat?" Harry's hand pauses against the parchment, a drop of ink landing right next to the word he'd just written, before he sighs.
"The worst." He says but he's smiling too and Harry sees Hermione roll her eyes at them before smiling.
"Oh, it didn't look like I was that high." Harry says and the boys chuckle as they reach the room of requirement.
"There wasn't a doubt in my mind that you would be able to." He says and Draco fills with even more love for the boy in front of him. Merlin if his father could see him now he'd go ballistic.
"She said you hate the fame and the fact people still call you the chosen one. She said you have nightmares, but I knew that anyway. She said you think all the deaths are your fault and you feel guilty." Malfoy says, grabbing Harry's hand and intertwining their fingers as he takes a deep breath.
"Potter felt dizzy." Malfoy says simply and Ron stands in the doorway in silence for a few moments before frowning. Draco is expecting him to ask more questions or tell him to get out or tell him to leave Harry alone, so when Ron simply picks up a quill from the desk and walks back out of the room Draco is more than surprised. He looks back down at Harry, noticing his hand is still threading through his hair, and releases the breath he didn't realise he was holding.
"I don't see the point in pretending everything is normal. People died, Hagrid. I died. But I came back. Everyone else didn't. I can't look at anyone without feeling guilty. Every time I look at Ron I think about Fred and I just- I can't- I'm not okay. I don't understand how they are." Harry breaks. He can't keep himself together anymore. Hagrid moves to the seat next to Harry and pats his back.
"We're gallivanting." Harry says with a smirk. He respects McGonagall to no end but he can't help but sass a teacher given the chance. McGonagall tries not to smile but she can't help it, she's grown rather fond of Harry too, so much so that she knows he's keeping something from her.
"C'mon. We're gonna be late for dinner." Draco knows Harry probably wont eat, but the fact that he's the one to suggest going to a meal makes Draco turn immediately to start walking to the hall, hand linked with Harry's.
"Sooooo..." Blaise says as he sits back down at his table, smirking. Draco looks up and raises an eyebrow.
"But- It's like I'm not a person. I was only alive for the purpose of ending the war. Of ending Voldemort. Dumbledore said himself, I was raised so I could die. I was never expected to survive. I was never meant to survive. I was raised like a pig for slaughter. As long as I did what I was meant to no one cared that I was meant to die as I did it. No one cared that I was only 17, or if it hurt, or if I was alone, or if I was scared, or if I didn't want to die. I was merely a weapon to end the war, or die trying. My only purpose was to defeat Voldemort. And I did that, and I died but then I survived even though I shouldn't have. I don't have a purpose anymore, and I'm living on stolen time, time that shouldn't be mine, time that no one thought I'd have. And I'm just so tired. And maybe what's dead should stay dead." There are tears falling rapidly now, and Draco almost can't believe what he's hearing. He's grabbing Harry in a hug before he can even comprehend what he's doing, and Harry is shaking against his chest. Draco places a hand on the back on Harry's head, playing with the hair at the nape of his neck, trying to calm him down.
Harry feels rough. He's been eating, because Kreacher makes him eat, but he hasn't slept in the few days he's been home. He received a letter from Draco the day they returned home asking if he wanted to visit or if Harry wanted Draco to come see him, mentioning the fact that he told his mother and she wants to properly meet Harry. Harry replied saying he didn't want to impose, but he does want to see Draco and if his mother wants to see Harry then he will. She saved his life, after all. Draco's reply didn't take long, saying Harry won't be imposing and that both him and his mother really want him to visit the manor, so Harry accepted.
Harry leads Draco over to the sofa. He really wants to tell Draco that the constellation and dragon tattoos are for him, hence the green dragon with silver eyes.Â Also Harry literally has the constellation Draco's named after, if he hasn't got the hint he doesn't know how much more obvious he can be. Draco and Harry sit opposite each other on the sofa, their legs crossed, and Harry takes Dracos left hand in his and holds it in his lap so his dark mark is facing up. Harry takes his wand, holding it how he holds a quill, and whispers incantations as he slowly draws a dragon over Dracos dark mark and heals as he goes. He also adds the magic that makes it move, but the more he think about Draco the more he interferes with the magic, and he links himself to Dracos tattoo. It doesn't affect the tattoo looks wise but the dragon on his forearm will react to Harrys touch more than other peoples and will react to Harrys emotions towards Draco. This means if he feels anything towards Draco, like if someone is being mean to him and Harry gets mad for him, the dragon will react, and if he shows too much emotion, such as love, for him, the dragon will react. When Harry's done drawing the dragon and colouring in it's eyes he adds a few flowers around it and whispers a final healing incantation before he holds Dracos arm up, so he can have a final look at it. He smiles proudly at his work and looks up at Draco, who is looking at the tattoo with such adoration.
"It was definitely interesting, but I got my work done." Harry says before he takes a bite of his sandwich, looking down at Teddy, letting the guys chat around him, occasionally paying attention. Harry notices Teddy's hair changing from pastel green to a nice bright turquoise and wonders if Teddy knows he's doing that, but judging from the fact that his focus is completely on the bear he assumes he doesn't.
New update my lovelies! Can I just say I really love and appreciate your comments and your enthusiasm for each chapter <3 it makes me feel all warm and mushy inside :)
Harry walks straight to his usual table in the back corner of the library, and when he reaches the table he almost hesitates when he sees Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini sat at the table close to his. He considers going back to the common room, but he doesn't want to deal with his friends, so he just sits down and pulls out his sketch book. He starts to sketch his view out the window, but gives up half way through. He can tell Malfoy and his friends keep looking over at him, whether it's because they used to hate each other or because he has a dark love bite on his neck that is very visible despite his dark skin Harry isn't sure. He glances over at Malfoy to see him writing, his hair is loose and the way the sun is shining on his face makes him look so beautiful that Harry can't not draw him. He sketches Malfoy with the focused look on his face as he writes, and when Malfoy finishes his essay and is talking to his friends and Parkinson says something that makes Malfoy smile a slightly reserved smile Harry can't help but to draw him again. He takes subtle glances until he's finished the sketch, and just as he finishes adding the final touches he hears Hermione and Ron approaching. Harry quickly closes his sketchbook and shoves it in his bag before pulling out a random textbook, opening it just as Hermione and Ron reach his table.
"Any time." Harry says genuinely as McGonagall and Blaise walk into the wing. Blaise looking pleased with himself as he sits himself back down on the end of Harry's bed. Harry eyes him nervously as McGonagall walks over.
He hasn't told anyone, apart from George but they got really close after the war, about how he and Draco sleep together every night, or anything that happens in their dorm room. He quite liked the idea of it being a secret between the two of them. He knows for a fact that Draco hasn't told any of his friends, they'd have a fit or suggest Draco needs therapy.
"We have to go." He says, defeated and tired, and Draco turns around to look at the clock before sighing.
"You could look near death and I don't think Draco would mind." He says softly and Harry bites his cheek again.
"I was at the shrieking shack." He mumbles and McGonagall almost laughs because she remembers having this exact conversation with James.
"Of course not." Mrs Zabini says, but her smile is forced and Harry gets the feeling she's only saying that as to not upset or offend Narcissa. Draco squeezes Harry's hand, and Harry tries to calm down. A few more people walk over to greet Narcissa, and Harry feels relief rush through him when he sees Blaise and Pansy walking straight towards them.
"Of course. I saw your teaching skills when you created Dumbledore's army, and with the way you train your team. I would even go so far as to offer you both roles, if you would take them both." She says and Harry nods.
The next day after lunch Hermione, Teddy and Harry make their way to the entrance hall to meet Andromeda, Teddy gripping Harrys hand as if he's scared to let go. Andromeda arrives and Teddy runs to her and hugs her before Andromeda hugs Harry, thanking him for looking after Teddy and talking to Draco for a few minutes.
"Potter?" He asks, his usually snarky tone softer than normal, and Harry jumps slightly. He didn't know Draco had entered their dorm room. Harry is sat on the edge of his bed near the foot, silent tears streaming down his face and he's staring at the wall opposite him. He's been like this for a while. It's one of those days where he can't stop feeling guilty about the people they lost during the war. At least he managed to hold in the tears until he got to his dorm rather than having a complete breakdown in the great hall during lunch.
"He's gonna be fine." Blaise says and he's sure Hermione, Ron and the other Gryffindors are listening to him.
"I need more ink and maybe a new quill." Hermione says, taking a sip of her drink, meanwhile Draco is staring to feel awkward. He can see people look over at him every so often and he really just wants to go back to Hogwarts because this is the exact reason he doesn't come to Hogsmeade anymore; he hates the staring and the glares and the mutters.
"Without a doubt." He mutters back before smiling. "I can't believe I produced a corporeal patronus." He says in disbelief as he turns to look at Harry, who is looking at the wolf proudly.
"I- saw him- with- I can't-" Harry chokes, not able to say any coherent sentences, and Seamus sighs.
"You know,Â you've done a lot of stuff for the benefit of everyone else. This is the first time you're doing something purely to help you."
"That's just something my dad, my godfather, Remus and Pettigrew made when they were here. Fred and George found it in Filch's desk while they were in detention and they gave it to me third year. The cloak was also my dads." Harry explains and Draco raises his eyebrow.
"Have a seat, Potter." McGonagall says and Harry sits in the chair next to Draco, slouching slightly which makes Draco roll his eyes.
"So," Michael says, sitting in an armchair, "This first visit is just a general overview and get to know each other session."
"Fucking perfect for each other, you two." Blaise mutters under his breath, yet Harry and Draco both hear him, and he turns them both round and leads them out of the common room, the both of them blushing slightly andÂ refusing to look at each other.
"I read about potions a lot during summer and I guess I learnt something." Harry shrugs and Blaise looks at him for a second.
"Me too. But we're not going to know unless you actually try and sleep." Draco whispers with a small smile on his face and Harry laughs through his nose slightly.
"Mind if I join you?" Harry asks, sounding no where near as nervous as he feels. Draco nods, moving his bag so Harry can sit and lean against the tree next to him.
"You're observant today." Draco knows Pansy can tell something is up. He doesn't know why he hasn't told her yet about him and Harry, but he knows the second he says something she's gonna make a big deal out of it and go all 'I told you so' and probably squeal or something because she's the one he's been talking about Harry to since before Â he even knew he was crushing on him.
"Don't need to when you can warm me up, do I." He says and Draco looks at him, pleading him slightly.
"Harry I'm sorry." Ron says and Harry bites his lip. One glance in Rons eyes and he knows he's sincere, but he can't look at him for long. Ron notices this.
"Not hungry." Harry whispers, glancing round the hall. He catches Ron's eye, who smiles slightly at him making Harry force a smile back, and when Harry looks over at the teachers table he catches McGonagalls eyes. Harry quickly looks away, afraid he'll see disappointment if he doesn't, and he quickly closes his eyes again. He squeezes Draco's hand, almost subconsciously, 3 times quickly, then 3 times for longer, then 3 quick squeezes again, and Draco looks down at him with a small frown.
"Are you eating properly?" She asks and Harry sighs, picking up a slice of toast and taking a bite. It looks like Hermione's about to say something else but Professor McGonagall has stood up and is now addressing everyone.
There are around 20 Gryffindors on the pitch waiting, and Harry silently thanks McGonagall for being so specific about who she allowed to tryout.
"I could tell." Draco's joking about Harry nearly killing him, but Harry still feels awful about what he did to Draco.
"13 year old you jerked off to the thought of us together?" He asks and Draco rolls his eyes but blushes slightly.
"No but seriously, Harry. My mother never disliked you. She wasn't exactly happy about the fact that we would fight constantly, but she understood that kids fight sometimes. Besides, she couldn't hate you cause she's know I was in love with you for like 7 years." Draco says, blushing slightly at the last bit, and Harry's eyes widen.
"If you're gonna have a shower that hot you should open the window." Malfoy says, quieter, and Harry turns to look at him, noticing the way Malfoys eyes scan his exposed body.
"You wanna come to the library with me? We can talk? Or we can sit in silence if you don't want to talk." He suggests and Harry looks at the castle, now in view but still a couple of minutes walk away.
"I was instructed by Mr Black and Mr Lupin. And because 21 is the age your parents were when they died." She says and Harrys eyes widen.
Harry doesn't go to his dorm like he knows he should. He can't face Hermione's disappointment at the fact that he missed another meal, or Ron's sadness when Harry won't join in his conversations about quidditch. Quidditch. It's Wednesday, which means Harry only has 2 days to give McGonagall an answer about being Quidditch captain. Harry finds himself outside of Professor McGonagalls office and knocks on the door, hoping she's back from dinner and isn't busy.
"Course we are mate." Ron says and Teddy lets out an adorable giggle as he takes what's left of Harry's toast off of his plate and starts chewing it.
"You wouldn't have. You're not a bad person. You're a good person that bad things happened to." Draco says, quoting one of the memories that they watched the other day of Sirius and Harry at Christmas.
"Blaise! How did you not tell me that you got captain!" Draco exclaims as the two of themÂ enter the library after breakfast. Blaise just smiles.
"Prick." Draco mutters, but he presses his knee against Harry's to show him he's not actually mad, well, he is but not that much.
âOh my god babe thatâs amazing!â He says into her hair as he places a hand on her stomach, tears filling his eyes. He kisses Lily before letting her go and grabbing Sirius in a hug.
"And who is this young man?" Up until now Draco had been stood silently, watching the two chat, and when she mentions him he glances at Harry awkwardly. But Harry is looking at him with that dopey smile and those sparkling eyes.
Harry waits until the last minute to get off the train. Draco waits with him, knowing exactly why. He takes Harry's hand and squeezes it slightly.
"I-" He whimpers, and Draco runs his thumb across his cheek, preying he continues. "I don't know what to do." Harry sits up and Draco watches in confusion because Harry is definitely in the middle of some sort of emotional breakdown and Draco wants desperately to help him. Harry gets up, and Draco quickly gets up too before Harry can run out of the dorm. Draco grabs Harry's bicep with his right hand, reaching up to place his left hand on Harry's cheek, making him look him in the eyes. There are tears streaming down Harry's cheeks, and each one breaks Draco's heart.
"What's going on with you and Malfoy?" Rhys asks, half way to the entrance, and Harry frowns and glances sideways at him.
"Harry he's a good kid. He cares about you. That's all that matters to us." Remus says and Harry smiles slightly, never realising how much he would appreciate their approval until now.
"Of course, my mistake. You last name people you hate, but then you also last name a certain person that you are totally in love with."
"Merlin, Potter, how hot was your shower?" He asks in shock, and Harry shrugs, steadying himself before turning back to his clothes. He doesn't blush, it's not something he ever has done, but he knows if he did his face would mirror Malfoys right now. He's almost 100% sure Malfoy saw him naked. Malfoy drops his hand from Harry's arm and takes a step back, a bright red blush across his cheeks.
"Okay, for one, I think she's glad she saved you, she doesn't regret it. She wanted your side to win as much as you did. For two, I think her finding out you almost killed me would be less of a shock than her finding out we're together. For three, and I don't want you to worry or anything, but she already knows where and how I got these scars." Draco says, Harry chuckling at the second point and his eyes widening at the third.
"You're lying Draco." He says softly and Draco takes a deep breath. Harry is so close to him and he's topless and his muscles are perfect and how has he got such a great body even though it's covered in scars. Draco feels slightly lightheaded.
"You." He admits and a blush paints itself across Draco's cheeks and his eyes widen a fraction and his hand pauses for a second before continuing it's movements.
"I don't have much money, but boy if I did,Â I'd buy a big house where we both could live..." Harry looks up at Draco as he sings, and it takes Draco until the chorus to figure out this is a love song, and he blushes at the words Harry is singing because he's looking into his eyes and singing them to him and Draco is so bloody in love with him and he really hopes Harry feels the same way and didn't just pick this song because he likes it.
They enter the living room to see Harry curled into a ball, tears streaming down his face as he stares blankly at the wall. Draco's eyes soften and he immediately walks over to him.
"You need to stop doing that." Blaise says the second he enters the wing and Harry shrugs, not moving his gaze from the ceiling.
"I'm recruiting you for a super important top secret mission. Come with me." He whispers and she nods, standing up, obviously curious.
"How can I help him? What can I do? It's not like I can sit with him whilst he sleeps every night." Draco says, genuinely asking for ideas. Ron presses his lips together.
"You can open it, Potter. It's yours." She jokes but Harry is basically shaking. He opens it slowly to see around 250 small vials and he knows immediately what they are.
"How come?" He's stroking Harry's back out of habit and it's sending shivers down Harry's spine. Harry isn't sure he wants to say exactly why he couldn't sleep so he presses his lips together and shrugs slightly.
Harry isn't really coping well. He's spent most of the holiday so far at home on his own and he's not heard from his friends yet. Draco writes to him all the time, and they talk through the fireplace a lot, but he hasn't seen him since the day after holiday started. He's seeing him today though. And he's not sure he's entirely looking forward to it. Harry is going to Malfoy Manor so he can meet Draco and Narcissa, and they're going to head to the party together. Harry takes a deep breath, glancing at the clock. He has 3 minutes until he has to apparate over to the Malfoys, and he's starting to regret this. His stomach feels tight, and he's so worried he's going to fuck up somehow. He's standing in front of his mirror, staring at himself. He's wearing a black three piece suit, black tie, and white shirt. He looks good, and the suit fits him well, but he also isn't sure if he was meant to wear robes or not. The only robes he has are the ones he wore to the yule ball, which don't fit him anymore, and he didn't have the time or the energy to go shopping in Diagon Ally, so this was his only option.
"I was, but then I ended up writing something that could have been written by anyone..." Draco trails off and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"Yeah, I like it in here." Harry says as Draco tries to stifle a yawn. "You wanna takeÂ a nap?" Harry asks softly and Draco bites his lip before shrugging and lying down with his head resting on Harry's lap.
"Draco, will you be my boyfriend?" He asks, figuring he might as well not fuck about and just make it clear what his intentions are. No wonder Draco's confused, they snog for an hour and haven't spoken about it since. Draco's eyes widen slightly before his expression changes from one of shock to happiness.
"I was so tempted to walk over and make out with you in the hall just to shut everyone up." Harry mumbles and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"Some girls were talking about you two either making out or fighting just now." Hermione tells Harry as he sits next to her.
"It's a map of the school. It shows where every single person that is at school or on school grounds is every second of every day." Harry says, proud of his dad and his friends for making it.
"Where?" Draco asks. Now that Teddy is back with his grandmother Harry is back to living in his dorm, which means the room of requirement, though it would give them what they needed, was unnecessary.
Harry wakes up to something warm and hard under his head and something warm and soft in his hair and frowns slightly before remembering that he's lying on Draco's lap. He shifts slightly, turning his face further into Draco's thigh and takes a deep breath.
"Mate are you okay?" Ron keeps asking him every so often and Hermione keeps banging on about how "You should be taking notes, Harry, this is important." And Harry knows they mean well but he just can't bring himself to respond. He isn't okay. He knows this. He knows this because if he was okay he wouldn't constantly be thinking about all the people that died and how it should have been him. He wouldn't be regretting the fact that he chose to stay. He wouldn't be wishing that Voldemort would have just killed him in the forest, or in the graveyard, or in front of the mirror, or in his nursery when he was one and a half. He wouldn't constantly hear the screams and cries of people dying around him. He would be able to talk to his friends and sit and relax without feeling the guilt of surviving, or the burden of knowing if he'd just gone to meet Tom Riddle a few hours earlier, when he asked the first time, all of those people who died before they lived would still be alive.
"I don't know what you mean..." He says. He loves McGonagall like a mother but he hates how she can read him so easily.
âYou never told me you chose to be my roommate.â Draco says knowingly after a few moments of silence and Harry rolls his eyes, of course McGonagall told him.
"I don't see anything..." He keeps watching for a few minutes before talking again. "Oh, hang on, someone's flying."
"You look happy." Pansy says quietly so no one else at the table can hear, a small smile on her face.
"If you don't take him, Draco, I will. Just for the sole purpose of pissing everyone off." Blaise says, winking at Harry, and Harry laughs when Draco flips Blaise off and shuffles as close as possible to Harry's side.
"Are you alright?" Draco whispers, hand resting on Harry's chest. Harry nods, threading his fingers through Draco's hair.
"You tell anyone about this Potter and I'll hex your balls off." He growls and Harry grins at him, seeing an unknown emotion flash in Draco's eyes.
They stay and chat for an hour or two before deciding someone will probably realise if they both go missing for too long, so they make their way back to honeydukes and through the tunnel. They manage to make their way to their dorm room without interruption or being questioned, and when they get to their dorm Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck and pulls him into a hug.
"I know." Harry says softly, knowing there's no way Draco has a response. Draco just leans against his side and rests his head on Harry's shoulder.
Harry wasn't sure what he was expecting, but the wall of bookshelves full of both muggle and wizard books was not it. He knows Draco likes reading, but he didn't think he'd have a floor to ceiling bookshelf in his room that covers the width of the entire wall. Draco squeezes his hand again, leads him over to the bed, and they lie down together, Draco burying himself in Harry's side.
"I've known you since ye were a baby, Harry. You don't need to lie to me." Hagrid says and Harry looks up at the half giant that has been there for him for as long as he can remember.
Draco opens the door to their dorm and sees Harry lying in his own bed and he feels his heart break a little bit. What did he do to fuck this up? Harry's crying silently as to not let Malfoy know but he has some sort of radar when it comes to Harry so he immediately kicks off his shoes and walks over to Harry's bed. He lies behind Harry and Harry immediately wants to hold Draco close and never let go, but he's so confused and he needs Draco not to be here right now. "Fuck off Malfoy." Harry mutters and Malfoy responds by wrapping his arms tight around Harry and leaning close to his ear.
"Added to what?" Harry asks and he can feel Dracos eyes on him. McGonagall stands from her chair, walks over to a shelf and picks up a fairly large black leather box, like a smaller version of a trunk. She walks over and places it on the desk in front of Harry before standing to the side. On the top of the box are the letters HJP written in gold. Harry stands up, looks at it, then looks at McGonagall.
"Er, Potter." Draco says and Harry blushes harder before turning to him and letting him continue. "Is this normal?" He asks showing Harry his arm. Harry thinking about the two of them being boyfriends and stuff must have triggered the link. Dracos dragon is awake and walking slowly around his forearm, his wings stretched as if looking for something. Harry reaches out and touches it and the dragon immediately settles down.
"Alright, I'll go check with Lizzie and the others and I'll let you know at some point what time it will be." Harry says.
"I think you should leave now." He says calmly and Harry's eyes widen when Dean and Ron raise their wands. Harry immediately raises his too and a hurt look flashes across their face.
"Okay... What's that got to do with Sirius?" Harry asks, feeling his heart hurt just thinking about his godfather.
"Only 2. I want another one but haven't known what to get. Although I've recently had an idea." Harry says, standing up and turning round so Draco can see his scarred back. On the back of his shoulder blades across the top half of his back are two antlers, with vines wrapping around them and lilies placed across the antlers, the vines wind around like snakes and Draco guesses its for his mother because of the flowers. In between the antlers are a bunch of stars. They go from being just stars to having a line connecting some of them, showing 2 constellations. One is a constellation Draco knows well, as he was named after it. The other is the Canis Major constellation.
"You looked a little worried or something earlier." Draco says and Harry bites his lips again. He's never been this nervous before.
"I thought I told you to come straight to me when this happened." She says but Harry can tell she's worried about Malfoy, and now he's wondering how many times this has happened since they've been back at Hogwarts.
"Believe me, darlin, I haven't even thought about anyone since I finally got you." Harry murmurs in his ear and Dracos last remaining defense crumbles immediately.
"Draco, dear, please use proper sentences." Draco huffs because he knows that she knows what he's trying to say, she's just going to make him say it.
"Alright well come on, Ginny wants to talk to you." She says and Ron rolls his eyes before getting up and following Hermione out of the dorm.
"'M okay." He says. He's still shirtless as his fever hasn't quite gone yet and he would be quite embarrassed if it wasn't for the fact that he's so tired.
"Harry sir, It is good to have you back." Kreacher says, and Harry turns his head to the side to look at him.
The Slytherins disappear along with the crowd of students watching and as Harry is about to turn and walk back to his dorm room he feels a hand grab his forearm and drag him towards the bridge. He looks at Ron and frowns.
"Mister Weasley I am afraid I must insist that you go to your next class." McGonagall says, her voice firm, and Harry prays that Ron listens to her and goes away. He definitely wont be able to go to his classes today, since he is now dizzy and he can't see right, but now he's kind of dreading going to any of them.
Harry wakes up and opens his eyes to see Draco watching him carefully. Harry can feel Draco's soft top under his hand and Draco's arm is round his waist, tracing patterns lightly on his back.
"Stay alive and don't break a bone." Harry jokes before going off to find Lizzie Callaghan, fifth year chaser.
"Okay. But if you don't turn up for lunch I will personally drag you there." He says and he looks at Harry for a second longer before sighing again and patting Harry's leg.
"Of course." They make their way there and when the door appears and they enter the room it's a nice, cosy room. There's sofas and big armchairs facing a big grand fireplace and a coffee table and it's relaxing and calming and Harry thinks it's pretty much perfect.
"No worries, Potter." Blaise smiles and Harry nods before turning around and walking back to his table. He has no more homework to do, but he decides to read about occlumency and legilimency. He got pretty good at it but he would like to master it. He reads for an hour or so before deciding to go for a jog. He picks up his stuff and walks up to his dorm so he can drop his stuff off and get changed before taking off on a run around the grounds.
"You okay?" Draco asks and Harry shakes his head before lying down, his head resting on Draco's lap. Draco's hand immediately finds it's way to Harry's hair and he starts running his fingers through it, trying to help with whatever is wrong. Harry sighs again, melting against Draco's touch. He'd definitely rather keep his emotions to himself and keep what he has here than say something that will mess up his preexisting 'friendship' with Draco. He knows he can't live without him, literally, so anything he can do to make sure he doesn't have to try to, he'll do.
"You gonna answer any of my questions properly?" Draco asks, getting annoyed. All he wants to do is make Harry feel better and make him realise that the war wasn't his fault, but he can't do that unless Harry actually tells him what's wrong.
They hear raised voices, one belonging to the headteacher, from outside the hall after 10 minuets and everyone looks around confused before Headmaster McGonagall walks into the hall looking slightly annoyed and holding a baby with pastel green hair and bright blue eyes. Harry recognises him immediately as his two year old godson and frowns.
"Meet me on the quidditch pitch at midnight." Blaise says quietly and Harry nods just as he's called again.
"It's okay to be jealous babe, you're cute when you're like this. If you're gonna be like this whenever you're jealous I'll make it happen more often." Harry smirks and Draco lifts his head and looks him in the eye with a warning look.
Harry's not sure how long he's asleep for, but it's raining heavy when he wakes up and he walks over to the window to see a dark thundery sky. It's not late, because the sky is only dark because of the weather, not because it's night. He guesses it's somewhere around 3pm, maybe 4, but he doesn't care enough to check. He goes back over to the sofa and curls up under the blanket again.
"You standing there for a reason Draco?" Hermione asks and Draco blushes slightly before sitting on his bed and Hermione laughs.
"My book. I figured it was you, cause it was either you or Blaise and unless he's a better actor than I thought he had no idea it was here." Harry says, smiling slightly, and Dracos eyes flicker from Harry's face to the book and back again.
(Also have I made Draco realise who Harry's godfather was before this chapter or was that a different fic???)
"I know." Draco runs his thumb across Harry's cheek again and Harry reaches up and places his hand over Draco's. "But you're gonna be okay." Draco says again and Harry gets the feeling he's not just talking about having nightmares. Harry leans forward and presses his forehead against Draco's, closing his eyes as he does so, and Draco's fingers thread into the hair just above his ear, keeping their heads pressed together. Harry moves his hand off of Dracos and moves it to rest on Draco's side and Draco starts running his fingers through Harry's hair, and within minutes Harry's breath has evened out and he's fast asleep.
"Thank fuck Harry we were worried sick!" Seamus calls and Harry sighs, sitting up. He's not really in the mood to talk to people.
"He thought it was just a bit of parchment. You need a specific spell to activate the map, and there's a different spell that deactivates it, otherwise anyone could read it."
"Harry?" Luna calls cautiously. Harry is lying still and Luna can't tell if he's okay. Harry sighs before turning his head in her direction, too cold and numb to do anything else.
"Yeah. But I guess I'm glad she didn't have to go through what I did with the Dursleys." Harry says just as the door opens and Draco walks in. He smiles at Harry before noticing Ron.
"Potter?" She asks and Harry can feel Draco and Blaise staring at him so he nods, despite the fact that he feels sick thinking about having to eat every meal.
"I don't know." Harry says, keeping his gaze on the ceiling. Blaise is silent for a few seconds, watching him. Harry's eyes flicker to different spots on the ceiling and Blaise can tell he's thinking.
"You can't befriend him, Blaise! If you befriend him it will mean he notices you more which means he'll notice me more and I can't have that pressure on me!" Draco whisper yells and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"He likes you. He usually growls and breaths fire when someone other than me or Teddy touches him." Harry says, his voice gentle, and Draco smiles slightly.
"Empty threats, Draco." Harry whispers in his ear, throwing a leg over Draco so he's straddling him, not moving his arms. Harry is very much enjoying watching Draco try to stay together, but Harry is determined to break his composure. Dracos hands are itching to touch Harry, and he just wants to grab Harry and pull him closer, but he doesn't even know if Harry feels the same way he does, he could just be teasing him or trying to get him to talk.
"See you at the game." Harry winks at Draco before leaving the room and heading to the great hall. Most students are already there, including his team, so he goes and sits with them.
"No. No buts. Harry you are top of all of your classes and you are eating again, albeit reluctantly, and you accepted McGonagalls offer of a therapist, and you're talking to people. Granted it's mainly McGonagall, Pomfrey and a few Slytherins but Harry we're proud of you." Remus says and Harry looks at him with watery eyes.
"Is the whole point of me bringing Harry here so you can constantly tell him how hot he is?" He mutters, and Harry laughs quietly.
"Don't tell anyone I said this but I think I prefer the Gryffindor common room. It's a lot cosier than Slytherin." Draco says, looking into the fire.
"Try and get some sleep, Potter. I'll make sure no one else comes to see you." She says softly and Harry nods before sinking back and closing his eyes, praying the nightmares stay away.
"Do you wanna sit?" She motions to the chair Draco's stood in front of and he hesitates before sitting down, dropping his bag onto the table.
"So how and when did you figure out there's a secret passageway in the castle?" Draco asks as Harry leads him down the narrow tunnel.
"-floating in a most peculiar way. And the stars look very different today... For here am I sitting in a tin can... far above the world... planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do...Â Though I'm past one hundred thous-" Harry freezes when he hears footsteps and looks up to see Draco.
Also also... Just wanted to say thank you for sticking with me through all my bullshit <3 even my irl friends have abandoned me so thank you and I love you <3
Hermione walks into the library when the guys are finished practicing and sits in the back corner that she knows Harry sits in. She lets Teddy sit on the table to her left and play with his bear whilst she starts her potions essay. Hermione looks up when someone clears their throat and sees Malfoy stood in front of her on the other side of the table.
"You weren't bad, Draco. You kept me grounded cause god only knows most people here believed the chosen one stories. And third year was when I found out I had a godfather. He was the one that wrote to me and stuff." Harry says, his tone bittersweet.
"Nothing you ever do is tactical baby." Harry grins, leaning forward and kissing Draco on the lips. "We gotta get to class." Harry pulls away and they walk to herbology.
So I know it's been over 2 weeks since I posted and I know I apologise a lot for being like this but honestly I'm a mess so I hope you understand. No one is more annoyed at me than I am. Anyway I've been off work this week cause I had annual leave and I've done nothing but play sims because I can't make myself write. It's so frustrating!
"Dunno really. I was always close to Fred and George, and when Fred died George and I got closer. We were both kind of depressed and it was just easier to talk to him because he didn't try and cheer me up, he just let me be sad. Like you do." Harry says and Draco nods, smiling slightly to hide the fact that he knows there's more to it.
"It just hurts too much, Ron. It hurts too much to love people." And Ron doesn't know what to say to that because really, what words can hide how true that is.
"No, he just asked why I'm here then left." Harry presses his lips together and glances at Draco, meeting his gaze. Draco is watching Harry carefully, thinking about the drawings he saw and how soft Harry's hair is. Harry frowns slightly, his head tilting to the side slightly.
Harry is pacing his living room nervously, waiting for Draco to arrive via floo. He tried to look presentable, Kreacher helping him find something to wear considering he's served a pure blood family all his life and being used to things like this, so he's wearing black jeans and a black shirt. It's not exactly a suit and tie but he looks alright, save for the bags under his eyes.
Harry walks up to his room and sits Teddy on his lap facing him once he's sat down on the sofa. It's Teddy's birthday soon but Harry feels like Teddy's grandmother will be well enough to care for him soon and he will probably be back with her on his birthday. Harry accio's his present to him and Teddy grins.
"I know I do, darlin." He says and Draco decides he likes it when Harry calls him pet names, But now he's confused. They made out but they haven't spoken about it since. He doesn't know if this means Harry wants to be with him, or if he just thinks they're sort of like friends with benefits. Draco would really prefer the first one, but he would never make the first move, or initiate a conversation like that.
"I can't move in, love." Harry says softly, smiling at the suggestion because that kind of sounds great, "Besides, I'm spending the 23rd and Christmas Eve with Andromeda and Teddy."
As Seamus, Dean and Harry leave the pitch they see some Slytherins walking towards it for their tryouts. At the back of the group is Zabini and Malfoy. Harry doesn't know if Malfoy is trying out for the team or if he is helping Zabini with his captain duties, but Harry secretly hopes for the former. He goes straight to professor McGonagall so they can discuss the quidditch team, and after a half an hour conversation they have decided on a team. Harry sticks the list to the bulletin board in the Gryffindor common room and goes straight to the library so he wont have to deal with any questions from the people that didn't get onto the team.
"Yeah that's true I'm kind of surprised he hasn't noticed yet." He jokes as there's a knock on the door.
"Thank you Harry. Where did that one come from? It looks like an original copy." She says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"Harry you really shouldn't have missed breakfast." Hermione says once Harry has sat behind her, right in front of Malfoy. "You really need to eat."
"It's okay, Potter." She says and he takes a deep breath before looking over her shoulder to see Blaise and Malfoy walking in, Blaise with his arm wrapped around Malfoys middle and Malfoy wincing with every step.
"Harry?" He whispers, "Wake up." Harry groans to say he's awake and Draco smiles slightly and leans back a bit, moving his hand back to stroke Harry's cheek and Harry's eyes flutter open.
"Ah Mister Potter," Madam Pomfrey talks before Blaise can ask anything else. "I have some news." Harry frowns and sits up straighter.
A few more minutes go by in silence and then Harry realises Draco's stopped writing and is looking at his quiz, his eyebrows furrowed and the end of his quill tapping against his lip absentmindedly as he thinks. Harry looks down at his essay and reads the question he's answering.
"You realise this does mean I have to go Hogsmeade tomorrow and get him a present. So you're subjecting me to the hell that is Hogsmeade twice." Draco says and Harry smiles innocently.
"You saved me Malfoy, and so did your mum. You didn't want to do what you did. And I wasn't going to allow another innocent person go to Azkaban." Harry says and Draco smiles slightly, Harry's given him an opportunity to find out more about his godfather.
"Cause Harry is currently fast asleep and I reckon the only reason he's sleeping peacefully is cause Malfoy is rubbing his back and stroking his hair." Ron looks at Seamus for a second before sighing.
"Harry come on." Hermione says and Harrys about to open his mouth and talk but Hermione gives him a look that shuts his mouth immediately and he sighs. He gives her a look and she smiles slightly and gives him another look and Draco comes to the conclusion that they're having a silent conversation so he just watches the interaction in fascination, wishing he knew a look that would shut Harry up. Hermione gives Harry another look and he rolls his eyes before sitting up and pulling on a shirt and his converse.
Deciding this is a good idea, Harry starts walking towards the tower, following behind his friends, and he slips away undetected as they enter the hall before him. Harry makes his way to the dorm, grabbing his shower stuff and some clothes, before making his way to the 6th floor. There's a bathroom that not many people know about down a fairly unused hallway, and Harry knows he wont be interrupted. He strips out of his clothes and turns the water on as hot as it will go before stepping into the shower. The water is so hot that it almost feels cold as it hits Harrys cold skin and he winces slightly but doesn't turn it down, instead he steps fully under the shower head and winces again when the steaming hot water hits his scalp.
"People that are fine do not go missing for 11 hours." She says, her tone somehow both snappy and soft towards Seamus and Harry respectively. Harry looks down at the grass beneath his feet, wanting nothing more than to go and sleep or at least shower, however they have breakfast and then classes so he can't do either of those. Except he's not hungry so he can skip breakfast for a shower.
"Did he say he died?" Pansy whispers and Blaise nods. Draco is looking at the floor intently, wanting to hug Harry and make him feel better but knowing that he can't.
"Later." He mutters before walking over to Hermione who is looking at a table full of different snitch related items.
"So where does this one lead?" Draco asks, sensing Harry doesn't want to talk about his parents in a dark and dirty tunnel.
"You're so pretty." He says, and just like that Draco is looking at him with all the love in the world.
"Anyways, I was gonna come up with this cool or epic way to tell you all, not that it's really any of your business, although I have enjoyed seeing who you think I'm dating." Harry says, patting Seamus on the back which makes him roll his eyes.
Okay I'm still working and it's so damn busy so I know my upload schedule is non existent and the chapters are short and I'm a mess and I know I say this all the time but I know where this is going I just need to actually write it!
"You're not gonna sleep sitting up, Potter." Draco mumbles, and Harry breathes a laugh before sighing and lying down, his head on Draco's ridiculously soft pillow. Draco looks at him for a second and Harry takes a deep breath before looking up at him.
"You want tea or something?" Draco wants to say 'something more than just water' but he also doesn't want to upset him. Harry glances at the pot of tea on the table, then up at McGonagall who is looking right at him, before bringing his gaze back to Draco.
"Oh, er, quidditch." Harry says, shooting Hermione a look that tells her not to tell Ron about Draco.
"I'll see you soon." Draco whispers, grabbing Harrys hand and squeezing before biting his lip and following McGonagall down the hall and to her office.
"Seamus is first. You're just above Jason." Harry explains and Draco glares, not at Harry but at the information he just heard.
"Harry- That's... They- But- They'd lock you in a cupboard?!" Draco asks in shock and Harry nods with a slight shrug.
"Anti dizziness potion is light blue, not purple. You gave me anti dizziness potion last night." Harry says, glaring at the potion in her hand.
"Harry?" Hermione asks as she opens the door, before she looks at Harry lying on Dracos lap and Ron at the end of his bed.
Then the memory stops and Harry and Draco are in their dorm again. Draco puts the memory back in the vial and replaces the lid before putting it in the box and Harry doesnât know what to say or do. He was going to have a sister. A little sister to look after and torment and joke with, like the weasleys and Ginny. He can feel tears falling from his eyes and he doesnât know what to do about it.
"No worries, Harry. Work on my technique and try again next year, right?" She says what Harry told her to do earlier, and he nods.
"That's believable." He says, deadpan. Draco stays quiet, staring at the door opposite them as if he's debating running through it.
"Of course mister Potter sir." Winky puts a plate of food in front of him and Harry grimaces at it. It's pie. He likes pie. He just can't bring himself to eat. He takes a small amount of mash on his fork and slowly forces himself to eat it. He manages to eat almost half of the pie and a few mouthfuls of mash before putting his fork down, deciding he can't make himself eat any more. He leaves the kitchen and manages to get half way to the hospital wing when he runs into McGonagall.
"I'm joking, love, don't worry." He says before realising what he said. He panics for all of two seconds before deciding to just roll with it. He said it and they both know it, no point getting flustered about it. Draco on the other hand is blushing like mad because hearing Harry call him Draco was one thing, but hearing him call him love is completely different. They hear footsteps coming from the hallway at the bottom of the staircase and Harry steps back before grinning, getting an idea. He grabs Draco's hand and takes off up the staircase and down the corridor until he reaches the entrance to one of the secret passageways. He pulls Draco behind the statue of the one-eyed witch and Draco looks at Harry confused.
"I'm not blaming you for what happened to mister Potter. I merely want to know what happened." She says and Blaise nods.
They lie together for an hour or so, talking quietly occasionally, Draco tracing the scars on Harry's chest whilst Harry brushes his fingers over Dracos skin softly.
"You're right, we shouldn't have come." Harry laughs again, drops Draco's hand and wraps his arm around his waist.
"You wanna watch another memory? We still have an hour until transfiguration." Draco offers and Harry nods, smiling slightly.
"Brandon Avery, my dear Harry, is Draco's ex boyfriend." Blaise smirks, and Harry nods, because he knew, or at least figured, Draco had been in a relationship before him. Draco knows Harry has. He doesn't see it as a problem. He glances at Draco.
"I'm okay. I'll be fine." Harry just desperately wants to go for a run and forget about everything that's going on or has happened.
"We have a lot more in common than I thought. When Lupin told me to pick a memory that was the first one I thought of." He says and Draco smiles slightly.
"Quidditch." He mutters, taking a reluctant bite of his sandwich. Hermione looks like she want's to say something else, but doesn't want to interrupt when Harry is finally eating something, so she keeps quiet.
"Yeah. I'm totally gonna marry you one day." Harry says and Draco smirks his trademark Draco cocky smirk.
"Hey Potter did I leave my jacket in here? I can't find it." Draco asks as Harry lets him in and walks back over to the sofa.
"There's so many things wrong with me Ron. I'm so messed up. I'm broken beyond repair, and I can't deal with it. He shouldn't have to. No one else should have to."
"Oh god no, he was bi, but he actually knew who you were so he probably wouldn't have liked us together." Harry jokes and Draco frowns sadly.
"Drop it Potter." Draco says and Harry smirks, sitting up on his knees and placing his hands on the headboard either side of Draco.
"Is there something you ain't telling me, mate?" He asks and Harry bites his lip, the least he could do is tell Ron that he and Draco aren't fighting 24/7.
"How's my favorite gays?" Blaise asks as he sits at the table opposite Pansy and Draco, he looks at the two of them before grinning. "Draacooo? Why are you bluuushingg?" He practically sings and Draco blushes harder.
"I think there's some money in there." He says before leaving his left arm behind his head, bent at the elbow and lying right next to Draco's thigh.
"Well right now you all need to eat and then we have herbology." Hermione says and the boys roll their eyes before following her out of the common room.
When the trio get to herbology they go over to the table the usually sit at, with Neville and Seamus, and Seamus immediately turns to Harry.
"Remus taught me in third year. It's weird that I'm now using it to calm his child." He says and Draco watches his face as it changes to a sort of sad happiness.
"What a great idea, I don't know why I didn't think of that." He says, continuing his dinner. "I did." He adds, swallowing his food. "He didn't want to impose." Draco rolls his eyes as if he's had that conversation with Harry many times and always got the same answer, and Narcissa shakes her head with a fond smile.
"Not sure, probably. I wouldn't say no." Harry jokes and Draco glares at him so Harry grabs Dracos shoulders and pushes him down onto the bed.
"You're the worst.â He mutters but Harry just continues to smirk so Draco buries his head in Harryâs neck and takes a deep breath in, breathing the comforting smell of Harry.
"I'm so sorry, Harry." Seamus says softly as a few tears fall down Harry's cheek. Harry looks desperately at him.
"Are you coming to dinner?" Draco asks quietly. They've been sat together for 2 hours and it's 5:30 now. It's quite early still so the hall wont be busy yet and Harry figures he might get away with sitting with Draco. Harry looks at him for a second before nodding.
"I'm going to collect your homework, and then you are free to go." Professor Slughorn says and Harry sighs when he starts walking round each table, collecting rolls of parchment from the students. When he gets to Harry he frowns, noticing there is nothing on Harry's desk.
"Teddy." He calls softly and Teddy stops giggling at the birds and looks at Harry. Harry holds his arms open and Teddy runs into them, allowing him to scoop him up. They say bye to Ron and Hermione, Harry telling them he'll see them at lunch probably, and they make their way to the library.
Harry sits in the back corner of defence against the dark arts, not bothering to take any notes or parchment out of his bag. He listens, but only partly, and he doesn't take any notes throughout the class. He knows his friends keep looking over at him, but he can't bring himself to take his eyes off the table in front of him. They get given homework, obviously, and Harry makes a mental note of what it is before silently making his way to potions. The same happens in this lesson, not taking notes and only half paying attention, and in Transfiguration and history of magic. He's made a mental note of every piece of homework they're given and begrudgingly walks with Hermione, Ron, Seamus and Dean to dinner. He sits and reads through dinner, and when he can't bare the talking and the laughter and the happiness from the people around him he stands up and leaves the hall.
It looks like he began to write the word incendio before putting a neat line through it. Harry watches Malfoy for a few more seconds before deciding if Malfoy can help him with potions then he can help Malfoy with DADA.
"People aren't going to want an ex death eater on their team, Blaise." Draco says sadly and Blaise frowns.
"Draco we were both depressed and we were comforting each other and sometimes we got carried away. Baby I love you. You know that." Harry says, looking into Dracos eyes. Draco tries to hold his ground but Harry is so beautiful and he knows that's true because he overheard his conversation with George earlier and Harry looks so good in ripped skinny jeans and a tight white t-shirt.
"I dunno, he's all about pride ain't he? Probably cause he cursed me when my back was turned." Harry says shrugging and moving to sit on the rail of the bridge, his legs hanging over the edge. Ron sighs and sits next to him, one of the rails attached to the roof of the bridge in between them and Harry leans against it.
Andromeda and Teddy leave after a long goodbye consisting of Harry reassuring Teddy he'llÂ  see him in a week whilst his heart aches because saying goodbye to Teddy kills him. Once they've left Hermione turns to Harry and Draco.
Harry was definitely watching him. Draco's heart goes intoÂ overdrive and he bites his lip as Harry walks along the lake, getting closer. He wants nothing more than to sit and talk, or walk and talk, anything and talk to be honest. He just wants to be in Harry's presence. He's just about to give up, Harry walking past him slightly, when Harry stops, turns around and walks over.
"I'm glad you came back." Draco says, voice softer than Harry has ever heard it, and Harry glances at him for the first time since they started this conversation as he stops walking.
"It is just about the biggest fuck you to all of them." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow at him.
Harry wakes up at dinner time, and instead of going to the hall with his friends, he decides to go for a run. He knows his friends are going to be mad at him for missing dinner, and he knows going for a run, especially one as long as the runs Harry goes on, on an empty stomach when you're also dehydrated isn't the best idea, however he doesn't seem to care. Harry runs around the grounds of Hogwarts 3 times, and during his fourth he's stopped by Hagrid as he runs past his hut.
"Well the thought crossed my mind, many times, but no. I told you why I brought you here." Harry says, moving so his hands are on Draco's chest and he pushes him against the closest wall. He grins when Draco lets out a quiet groan and leans close to his ear.
"Brandon." There's an awkward moment where no one says anything else, Brandon staring at Draco with a look that makes all four of them feel uneasy.
"I only came back because I knew if I didn't he would have killed everyone. I couldn't let that happen." Harry whispers and Draco's right hand nudges his left as they walk and Harry links their little fingers.
"Went for a run. I ate in the kitchen, ask Winky." Harry mutters and Hermione looks at him for a second before deciding against arguing.
Harry stands Teddy up on his lap and smiles at him before whispering "That's Draco. He's sad." He whisper in his ear so Malfoy can't hear and the second he says Malfoy's sad Teddy frowns. Harry grins as Teddy climbs onto the table and closes Malfoys textbook. Malfoy looks up and raises an eyebrow at Teddy. Teddy just grins a bright smile and sits right in front of Malfoy.
"Of course I did, he's gonna be the youngest quidditch player in a, well, since me." Harry says smugly and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Thanks. Neither are you, Blaise." He says before adding, "Which I guess is a good thing considering we're not exactly gonna be able to avoid each other."
"I'm not doing this in the hopes you give me something in return, Harry." Draco whispers, and it's mostly true. A part of him is still hoping that Harry will fall in love with him though.
âYou do that.â Draco whispers and itâs become more and more clear to Harry just how similar he is to his father.
"This another one of your hidden passageways?" He asks and Harry smiles slightly but doesn't answer, instead gripping Draco's hand and leading him down the tunnel and into the living room of the shrieking shack.
"They won't hate you. If anything they'll finally realise that you aren't your father. You're forgetting how much people listen to what I say. As much as I hate being the chosen one, it may actually be useful in this situation." Harry says and Draco bites his lip.
"Good. Now I know you still have a thing for Malfoy, so you best do something about it before I haunt you too." Fred says quietly and Harry blushes but nods before turning to address everyone.
. This view, of the stars and the trees, is what keeps Harry where he is, with limbs numb from the weather and covered in goosebumps and a body aching from the solid groundÂ beneath him, until 7am the next morning. Because 7am is when his friends finally found him.
"Firstly, there's no way Blaise would let me not take part in whatever he's about to start, and secondly... I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be." He starts talking confidently, but his voice is smaller and quieter during the second half of his sentence, and Harry feels his chest warm up slightly because Draco wants to be there.
"Mione for fucks sake!" Harry shouts, not sounding that angry though, and Hermione grins, noticing the fact that they're both shirtless and, although the duvet is covering them both from the waist down, she knows what they've been up to.
They don't say much more. They talk about what they need to do during the lesson, and Blaise makes small talk that Harry doesn't have the energy to make into actual conversation, but Blaise understands and doesn't force him to. After potions Harry decides to go for a walk since he doesn't have another class until after lunch. He would go jogging, but he's in jeans, so he leaves the castle and walks around the grounds.
"Ginny sent me a letter asking for some sugar stock cause she ran out and she's going mad with the amount of work she has to do so I figured a quick visit from her favourite brother would help. So come on kiddo, why you alone?" He asks again and Harry sighs.
âJames, Iâm pregnant.â Lily says, holding up a pregnancy test. Jamesâ face holds a look of shocked joy but Remus jumps up to pull her into a hug and Sirius grins, wrapping his arm around James. Harry frowns at Jamesâ reaction, but only for a second because then James is wiping a tear from his eyes and rushing to wrap his arms around Lily.
"He'd never do that." Harry is stood outside his dorm room, listening. He heard voices coming from inside and decided to listen to what his 'friends' are saying.
"Unfortunately for me, you're a part of my life now, Harry." Draco's joking and Harry smiles slightly. "I can't enter a room without looking for you in it, subconsciously or not." Draco whispers and Harry catches his gaze and they stare at each other for a moment and Harry is searching for something and Draco doesn't know what it is but then Harry seems to find it, or not, Draco isn't sure, and Harry is raising their hands slightly and pressing a kiss to the back of Draco's hands and Draco blushes and Harry smiles slightly, resting their foreheads against each other again, eyes shut and hands connected.
"Thank you professor." He says and she smiles at the both of them before walking up the stairs to her sleeping quarters.
"You were distracted." Hermione says fondly, looking over at Draco, whose hair is yet again perfect, to see him looking at Harry and smiling subtly, probably because he's eating.
"Why is Teddy here?" Hermione asks him and Harry shrugs as McGonagall walks over to him, causing every eye in the room to be directed to him.
"Honestly some took a little more convincing than others, but Harry never blamed you. He told us how you saved him in the manor, and he knows you didn't have a choice. Harry can be very persuasive when he wants to be." She says and he smiles slightly.
"Well, that thing... Over the past few months that thing kind of turned into a... bigger thing." Narcissa smiles properly, putting her fork down to give him her full attention.
"It was there when I woke up." Harry says, realising that if Blaise didn't know about it then Draco must have brought it. Blaise must notice the same thing because his eyes widen slightly before he smirks.
"You didn't answer my question." He says softly and Harry closes his eyes, enjoying Draco running his fingers through his hair.
"Cause loving people hurts. It always hurts." McGonagall looks at him for a moment, as if contemplating what to say, before taking a breath.
Gryffindor are winning 90-40 when Harry finally catches a glimpse of the snitch, flying around the Hufflepuffs goals, which is coincidentally right in front of the stands Draco is sat in. Harry makes a beeline for the snitch and catches it easily, grinning as he feels the cold metal against his palm and he makes eye contact with Draco and winks at him as Madam Hooch declares the end of the game. Harry flies to his team mates, not before seeing a bright blush spread across Dracos face, and is immediately engulfed in a hug from Katie Bell.
"Why did you stay with them?" Draco asks after a while, voice barely above a whisper. It's been about an hour since they read Harry's diary. Draco's head is resting on Harry's shoulder, Harry's is resting on top of Draco's and he has his eyes shut.
"You should have a cup of tea or some soup or something." Draco says softly as he stops warming up Harry's hands, and Harry bites his lip and shakes his head slightly.
"Come on, Harry." Seamus says once they've packed up their bags, and the two walk side by side towards the great hall.
"Okay, just let me know." Rhys says, walking back to the castle, not even acknowledging Draco's presence.
"Shrieking shack." He says through the sobs and Ron nods, getting off the railing and helping Harry down before leading him to the shrieking shack.
"They loved you, you know. Still do." Draco says and he's not sure if it was the right thing or not but then Harry is wrapping his arm around him and pressing a kiss to Draco's hair.
"Hey, c-can I get sumfin t-to warm m-me up?" Harry asks and a mug of hot chocolate is handed to him immediately from Winky as a different house-elf wraps a blanket round his shoulders.
"You gonna stop staring at me?" Harry asks quietly with a smirk on his face and Draco doesn't know if he wants to punch him or kiss him. There's a slight pause before Draco is able to speak.
Hope you like this chapter, I've decided I'm going to continue writing this fic, but when I post chapter 50 I'll ask if you think I should continue or if you want me to end it <3
"Good job, Potter." Blaise says quietly so he doesn't interrupt Slughorn as he talks to the next pair, and Harry half smiles.
"Twice." Harry adds, a cheeky smile on his lips, and he squeezes Draco's hand. "It's gonna be fine." Harry is trying to convince himself more than he's trying to convince Draco, but know he knows Draco is actually worried about it he feels protective of him, like he'll do anything to stop people saying or doing anything that will upset him. Draco smiles, squeezes his hand, and takes a deep breath.
As long as he has Draco he doesn't mind if they are disgustingly cringey or hopeless, he waited long enough to get Draco and he isn't going to give up showing how much he loves him now.
"Why do you know how to do that? Only the most powerful wizards can use legilimency." Draco asks just as the doors open.
"You know you have a crush on him, why are you confused?" She whispers, not wanting anyone else to hear. Harry pulls his gaze from Malfoy and looks at Hermione.
"You okay?" Draco asks, voice soft and quiet. Harry isn't sure so he checks. He still feels a little bit dizzy, and he has a slight headache but the hand that is still rhythmically threading through his hair, as if unconsciously, is helping a great deal to both ease the headache and relax him.
"Harry- He's scared. He's constantly scared and he's constantly hurting and he doesn't want to involve anyone in that. Keeps saying that lo-"
"Yeah sure, why not." Harry says and he catches Malfoy's eye before winking at him when no one is looking which makes him blush.
At the end of the day, after picking Teddy up from Mrs Pomfrey after class and having dinner Harry heads to their new room. McGonagall said it would only show for Harry and people he specifies so he allows it to show for Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Malfoy, just in case he ever wants to come here which Harry doubts. The room looks similar to how it did when Harry hid here a few days ago, except it's bigger, has a double bed against the right wall and a crib next to the bed. The room is also now in Gryffindor colours and is full of not only Harry's trunk and stuff, but also clothes and toys and things for Teddy, and has a safety barrier around the fireplace. Harry puts Teddy down, letting him run over to a toy chest, and sits at the desk, finishing an essay he started for Transfiguration. At around 10pm he's lying on his bed, Teddy lying next to him with his hand gripping Harry's little finger, and a potions textbook open on Harry's chest as he struggle to keep his eyes open. Eventually he throws the book onto the desk and takes off his glasses, allowing sleep to consume him and he dreams about grey, almost silver, eyes and pale skin and a smile that could light a thousand darknesses.
"It's up to you. I'll do whatever you decide on, Draco. You're the one that's going to be dragged into the spotlight. I'm used to it, but it's not- it sucks." Draco nods, biting his lip nervously, and Harry smiles softly, brushing his thumb over Draco's lip so he releases it.
Harry manages to find Lizzie and the other members of the team, sixth year Sam Foster who is a beater, and fourth year Matthew Whitford, who is a chaser, and he decides 5pm on Wednesday will suit everyone. He lets his team know before making his way up to the library, hiding in his corner and reading his book.
Hermione and Ron are sat at the end of the long table and Harry sits next to Ron on the very end of the bench, happily tucking into the slice of steak and kidney pie on his plate; It's been a long day and if he's eating maybe people will finally stop asking him about his tattoo. Teddy, who is sat on Harrys lap eating some mash, starts to get a bit restless and Harry decides, as they're sat at the end, he can do something he knows will calm him down. Harry sits Teddy on the end of the table and casts his Patronus. A big silver stag appears and stands at the head of the table, causing many students to gasp, or jump in shock, as Harry's the only student that he knows of who can produce a Corporeal Patronus, not even Hermione can. (A/N I know he taught everyone how to in the fifth book but we're ignoring that canon cause it makes this work better). Teddy immediately stops fussing and smiles curiously, reaching his hand out to touch the stag. Harry watches as Teddy strokes the stag, occasionally taking bites of his pie but not feeling very hungry. He feels eyes on him and looks up to the teachers table to see McGonagall looking at him. She catches his eye and nods appreciatively and Harry smiles slightly before turning back to Teddy. He seems to have calmed down so Harry stops focusing on the stag and watches as it disappears. Teddy looks at him with wide eyes and Harry smiles at him as he yawns.
"Er... Oh! Grab me one of them quill things from George would ya?" Harry says before pointing at his bedside table.
"Fuck dude no wonder you're ripped." Blaise mutters, trying to hide his genuine worry behind some banter, and Harry breathes a laugh through his nose, trying to hide how not okay he is behind a fake laugh.
"I feel so betrayed!" He says and Billy laughs at his over-exaggeration again. "This is an appetite boosting potion! Madam Pomfrey I am shocked!" He gasps dramatically meanwhile Blaise and Draco are shocked an impressed that Harry can identify a potion by smelling it.
"If you don't want to talk, then that's fine. But, Potter, if you ever need anything, I'm here." She says and Harry nods.
"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asks and Harry can tell Malfoy, Pansy and Blaise are subtlety listening to their conversation and he can feel Malfoys eyes on him. Harry looks up from his book at Hermione and nods. Hermione frowns and looks desperately at Harry, who sighs.
"Professor McGonagall and I have agreed you are now allowed to go back to your dorm room tomorrow so this will be your last night here." She says and Harry bites his lip.
"Well it worked, didn't it?" She asks just as Seamus rounds the corner and freezes. He looks between the Slytherins before his eyes land on Harry, clearly asleep but not writhing around or screaming and crying like he usually is. Seamus' eyes widen slightly.
"You okay?" Harry asks. He finished his essay around 10 minutes ago and has been reading the next chapter of his textbook again.
"Mister Zabini, Mister Malfoy, if you will come with me." She says and Harry watches as Draco and Blaise leave the hospital wing, both of them looking shocked at the information Harry just told McGonagall.
"I do have a question though." Hermione adds and he looks very nervous but stays quiet indicating Hermione can continue.
"I'll get the ingredients." Harry says, figuring it's only fair since Blaise got them last time. He walks over to the cupboard, ignoring the looks Hermione and Seamus give him. Harry reaches for the scurvy grass at the same time as Malfoy and Harry notices the other boy blush when their hands touch. They both pull their hands back quickly, and when Malfoy doesn't reach for it again Harry takes the jar off the shelf and holds it out to Malfoy. Malfoy looks shocked for a second, not meeting Harry's gaze, before he takes 5 blades of grass.
"Hermione it's Malfoy!" Ron snaps quietly, and Hermione sighs when he turns to face Professor McGonagall. She gets why Ron and everyone else is so upset but it's not Harry's fault he's sad. The second transfiguration ends Hermione makes her way to the hospital wing alone.
Two hours later and Harry has eaten just under half of his dinner and is now playing exploding snap with Billy, who is sat on the end of his bed. Billy is only in the hospital wing until tomorrow morning because he was only in here until the slight affects of the potion he accidentally ingested during class are healed. They have to be careful as to not interrupt madam Pomfrey, so they're talking quietly.
"Enough of that, Potter. We both know you don't call me Professor unless you think you're in trouble." She says with a knowing smile and Harry smiles a little more.
"What's wrong?" Draco murmurs against his skin, "And don't say nothing, because you're an appalling liar."
"I jerk off to you too." He breaths sensually before standing up and starting to walk up the stairs they're sat on. After a few seconds Draco's blood returns to his head and he stands up. Harry said jerk instead of jerked as in he still does and that made all of the blood in Dracos body go straight to his dick.
"Oh, er, he said he was sorry, and I said I forgave him." He says before whispering "Hermione can we go for a walk? I need to talk to you alone?" Hermione nods and Harry takes Teddy off of Ginny before they leave the hall and head outside.
"So are you going to introduce me to your dashing friend?" Narcissa teases Draco, and he rolls his eyes but plays along. He guesses they actually haven't been properly introduced.
"What happened?" Dean asks when they convene in the boys dorm after herbology. Seamus is leaning against his chest as usual, the others spread around the dorm room. Seamus explains his conversation with Harry and what Harry said and by the end of it everyone is looking guilty.
It's Monday and HarryÂ had astronomy at 2am this morning, so he had no morning classes which is why he now has to drag himself out of bed at lunchtime so he isn't late to quidditch tryouts. He gets dressed, pulling on some joggers and a hoodie with his converses, and grabbing his bag, broomstick, and the book that hasn't left his side since he got it on Saturday before he makes his way to the pitch. He knows what to do with the people trying out, because he's done it before, he just doesn't want to think about the people that are going to watch. He walks down to the pitch with Seamus and Dean, who are there not to try out but for moral support, and they go straight into the changing room. Harry drops his stuff off before grabbing a whistle and walking onto the pitch with his broom in his hand, the whistle around his neck, and Seamus and Dean right behind him.
"You know, I don't have my broom." Harry mutters as they walk to the quidditch pitch, and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"I know who you are." He accepts the handshake, but Harry just grips his hand tight in a bone crushing hold.
"If it's that you have a thing for him then I know." Harry's gaze snaps to Blaise and Blaise rolls his eyes with a chuckle.
