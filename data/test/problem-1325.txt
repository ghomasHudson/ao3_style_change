Maybe you've noticed my placements of something throughout, maybe you haven't. Keep an eye out, because there's a common theme that will come into a culmination and hold some meaning later.
When he rang out the last chord, he became aware of the gentle tug of magic around his body, weaving into his own magic. He wasn't unfamiliar with the feeling, as he often felt this kind of tug when he had a particularly involved practice session, or after a performance. His eyes stayed shut as he allowed the field to overtake him, completely tangling with his own. He didn’t know where his own magic began and where the other ended, by the time he opened his eyes.
“Sorry. I didn’t realize that made you uncomfortable. Usually, it’s a nice feeling.” Draco turned away, looking out of the window of the room, which was cracked open. That was how Harry had heard him earlier. He crossed his arms over his chest, the heat on his neck feeling more like a burn than a warmth. He was happy he had left his hair down over his back and shoulders rather than putting it up.
“Not in this room no, but you may stay by Messr Riddle's side as he undergoes the procedure.”
The Weasleys were left bewildered at Draco’s easy submission and exit while Cassius had an anxiety attack in the alleyway.
“You are Harry Potter?” He pointed to Dudley.
His eyes suddenly blew open, “Holy Cow, Tom Riddle, Riddle, that’s Voldemort? Voldemort's my father?” He glanced at Iuhr who looked even more disappointed than he did before if that was even possible. “Jesus, oh fucking merlin shit. That is
He could feel the panic rising like a tsunami in his stomach and his throat felt tight.
“Close your eyes and breathe normally and it will go well,” Iuhr said, pulling a white cloth from his pocket and pushing up Harry’s shirt sleeve. He wiped the skin to clean it and when he was done the cloth disintegrated before their eyes.
“You always do Paper first!” Dudley laughed.

“How the hell did he know all that stuff about me?” Cassius breathed out nervously and rolled his shoulders trying to relieve the tension building up in them.
His eyes blinked slowly open as the light flicked on, glaring from the crack underneath the door. He rolled over, glaring at the dusty walls of the room, he knew that if he were to trace his finger along the wall it would come off grey. His back ached when he turned and he groaned, he was pulling at scabbed scars from the brown leather belt that Vernon Dudley proudly wore to keep his pants from dropping. He startled up, hearing footsteps near to his door,
“What happened to him?” Cassius asked curiously,
“I need some time to think about this, but I cannot return to Privet Drive. Is there anywhere I can go?” He asked Iuhr.
Harry ignored Petunia and returned to put the slices of toast on their respective plates. He reached up and pulled two mugs from the top shelf and started to make some coffee. Black coffee for Vernon, Earl Grey for Petunia and a glass of milk for Dudley, he reminded himself.
“That is… an extreme but very correct way of putting it,” Harry said, flabbergasted by the revelation.
,” before striding off haughtily.
Cassius choked a laugh and just shrugged when Dudley looked at him curiously.
Afterwards, she curled into his shirt pocket, he was still wearing one of Dudley’s hand me downs, a button-up blue denim shirt over a ratty white shirt, baggy dark blue jeans and scuffed up black tennis shoes.
“I don’t know, I don’t know,” Cassius said desperately, wringing his hands together.
Cassius reluctantly set it back on the table for Ollivander to pack up.
“Of my reliable servant is it?” Frank peered around the door and saw a man, sitting on a chair, his back turned to the door. Next to him stood a stout man, clearly very nervous and agitated. By the sitting man’s feet, a gigantic snake slithered across the floor, her sleek body reflecting the flickering fire. He sucked a breath through his teeth.
“Dude he’s been alive since way before Jesus was born,” Dudley stage whispered theatrically, he paused, “Maybe he can help me with my history papers,” he concluded with a glint of mischief in his eye.

“Whatever, we’re going to Ollivanders.”
“I agree, that boy is coming this way, he looks like he's looking for us,”
“Asshole.”
“Ready as I’ll ever be.”

“Suspicious activity?” Harry pondered.
Vernon rolled his eyes, muttering lowly under his breath about how cumbersome it was to have Harry here and what a waste of space he was. Harry grit his teeth and returned to the kitchen, drying the pan and placing it into the drawer.
“Oh Jesus, this store must specialise in snakes,” Dudley said pathetically, growing slightly pale at all the beady eyes that stared at them. Cassius looked over to make sure Dee wasn’t watching, satisfied he hissed lowly in parseltongue.
“Did you run away from me?”
“Okay, let’s do this,” Harry mumbled, apprehensively following Quhov and Iuhr as they led him down a narrow passageway on the side of the lobby. Near the end of the passageway was a red door with golden letters painted onto it, ‘1937’
“Pretty handy that I’m the size of and I quote my school nurse, ‘the size and weight of a young whale,’ she is such a bitch,” Dudley complained and allowed Cassius to hide behind Dudley while they slowly walked the opposite direction.
“Thank you for your business!”
It hissed matter-of-factly,
the small boa hissed sarcastically, lifting her head out of Cassius’ breast pocket.
“We can summon food and reconvene after one hour.” Iuhr suggested and he and Quhov walked out of the room.
“Not sure.”
Hours later Dudley walked into the room holding a scroll of parchment tied with a red ribbon, there was a light frown on his face.
explanations:
“Pfft, more like a bajillion, he talks like he watched Jesus shooting out of Mary’s vagina,” Cassius said apathetically. Dudley wheezed, grabbing onto Cassius’ shoulder for support.
Looking out the small kitchen window he could see the morning sky, racing white clouds shot through with tendrils of grey and dusty blue, and the sky was a gorgeous azure. He saw tiny red-stomached birds float through the sky on gusts of wind and a longing settled in his chest for that freedom. He hung his head as he washed the pan, willing his damp eyes to clear,
He had given the boy simple and precise instructions. ‘Do not, under any circumstance, leave his uncle and aunt's house.’, and what had he done? He crumpled the slip of paper in his fist. Where in Merlin's name had that boy head off to?
“‘Course not,” Dudley said, he opened his mouth to say more but after a slight warning glance from Harry, he shut his mouth again and shook his head lightly.
“I’m cursed,” He mumbled,
She hissed in warning but begrudgingly lay still as Cassius cast the spell with his swanky new wand.
“You’re here for a wand? You’re a bit late but no matter. The shop will find one for you.” Ollivander said disappearing to the back.
“What?” Harry teased, “Now I’ve said it three times.”
Cassius said without a moment's hesitation.
Tom Riddle?
He knew that wizarding families tended to have the habit of giving their children extravagant names if Draco and Blaise were anything to go by. But really,
“Yup, mate you should see yourself.”
“Good morning Dudders, Petunia!” Vernon greeted, he sat on his chair, it groaning under his weight. He picked up the morning paper in his stubby fingers and read through the headlines as the three started breakfast.
“Hey, Haz?” Harry sat up from his bed, he had climbed back in to sleep more.
The boys walked to their side of the dormitory, and changed into their pyjamas without much talk, due to how tired they were and fell asleep rather quickly. Harry however, didn't. He kept staring at the ceiling, feeling uneasy. He didn't forget how quiet it was when he was sorted into Slytherin, or the whispers about him being in Slytherin was unexpected. The hat told him that he had traits of two rival houses, and he wondered what the second house was. Unless... Was it Gryffindor? Was he meant to be in Gryffindor? Harry sat up, thinking. He was lost in thoughts before a tired whisper made him break his train of thought.
They again ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked. They tried helplessly to open the door.
Harry beamed as Hagrid came into his vision, "Hiya Hagrid!"
They crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. Harry wondered why Snape was going into the 3rd floor, but hearing a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet made him, Draco, and Ron turn their attention to the troll, who was making its way into the girls' bathroom.
"Wow, Weasley. Needed a girl to help you with your spells?"
Harry winced in pain and clapped a hand to his head.
"You're a lot braver now since the Professor is gone, aren't you Malfoy?"
Harry and Ron told them about their lessons, more specifically how Snape seemed to hate Harry, but like Ron, he told Harry doesn't like any student much, but Harry took note about how Hagrid couldn't seem to look him in the eyes as he told him that. Hagrid then talked to Ron about his brother, Charlie and again, Harry couldn't help but wonder if he did that on purpose. Harry then noticed a piece of paper lying of the table. He grabbed it and saw it was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:
Harry tilted his head, "But won't the school eventually find it or even worse discover it at first?"
While Diagon Alley was definitely welcoming, Harry knew as soon as they stepped into Gringotts that this place isn't really one to joke around with, especially with Hagrid explaining how goblins aren't the most friendly of sorts. He and Hagrid then were on a very odd sort of track system as they went to Harry's vault. Once there, the goblin opened up the vault and Harry could not believe his eyes: His parents left him a small fortune! Once he gotten enough for his school supplies, Harry and Hagrid left Gringotts with Harry noting Hagrid looking slightly sickly. Harry entered the robe shop alone while Hagrid went back to the Leaky Cauldron for a pick-me-up.
When Harry was brought to the back of the shop, he was placed on a stool next to a boy with a pale pointed face.
These are just few of the thing Harry heard about him. Kids would either want to get a look at him, or say nasty things about him, which he wished they didn't do either. He just wanted to get to his classes without trouble. He was able to get to his first class without much trouble, due to him being with a group of Slytherins. However, Harry got separated from that group while trying to find the bathroom.
"Sit down", Snape snapped at Hermione. "For your information Potter, Asphodel and Wormwood make a sleeping so powerful, it is known as the Draught of the Living Death. A Bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and will save you from most poisons. As for Monkshood and Wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which goes by the name Aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
Harry was taking down everything Snape was saying, so he didn't forget a single word.
Draco jumped down from the footstool and looked at Harry, "Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts Harry. Maybe we'll be sorted into Slytherin."
Harry then asked, "Ron, are you mad at me..?"
Harry yawned, "Wow... Sleeping at midnight... Wonder what that's like.."
"Or what Weasley? Gonna try and fight us"?
Harry spoke up, as polite as he can, "we got lost."
Ron and Draco looked around for anything to help Harry, but didn't find much to help.
"Another Weasley, eh? I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
"Say that again, Malfoy.", Ron said heatedly.
"Good morning class", she said.
There was an uncomfortable amount of silence before Harry spoke up.
Ron, now starting to get annoyed, just said, "We've already told him we haven't seen it". This fell on deaf ears as the girl was looking at the wand in his hand.
Harry from the corner of his eye saw Draco smirk and nod at Goyle at the mention of Slytherin.
"Oh, not to worry dear. All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between thw platforms. Best to get a running start if you're nervous. Go before Ron"
Draco looked at his hand and saw the ball was gone. He looked all around the ground, but could not find the ball. Ron was confused as well, but when he looked at Harry, Harry pulled out the Remembrall silently out of his pocket before putting it back in his pocket. Ron was stunned. When and how did Harry take it without either of them knowing? Ron was about to question Harry when Hooch came back and the class then went from fighting to back to paying attention.  When the lesson continued, it was clear to everyone that Harry was the best flyer. Everyone was a bit jealous on how good he was, especially for a first year. The lesson then ended, leaving Harry in high spirits.. Until he saw Ron and Draco fighting again.
Harry thought, "Any house. Please, just any house".
”Shut up Peeves.. please. You’ll get us thrown out.”
Draco scoffed, "Let them. They'll have to go through me if they want do try anything with you."
With a mouth full, Ron replied, "I'm Ron Weasley.
"I think he's brilliant", Harry said with some venom and coldness in his voice.
The train finally slowed down to a stop as a voice echoed through the train: "We reached Hogwarts! Please leave your luggage on the train, it'll be taken to the school separately!". Harry's nerves where at an all time high, along with Ron, who looked pale under his freckles. People pushed their way towards the door and out on a tiny dark platform. Harry shivered, not knowing if it's because he's cold or just very nervous. Then a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years over here!"
Hagrid definitely didn't meet his eyes this time.
The students all stood by the left of their broomsticks.
The mother, assumed Harry, then said "Alright Percy, you First." To which the oldest looking boy marched towards the platforms. Not wanting to miss a thing, Harry watched without blinking and just as the boy reached the dividing platforms, he vanished between them. Harry had to check behind himself to see if anyone saw that and to hos astonishment, no one did.
Harry then said, “Just because I’ve been talking to Ron doesn’t mean I stopped talking to you, you know.”
Hermione stretched her had as high as she could without leaving her seat.
Harry just answered lowly while looking down, "Just not tired..".
Just then, Neville shouted, "Trevor!" And there the toad was: by McGonagall's feet as Neville ran up the stairs to pick up Trevor. Neville then sheepishly looked up to the stern face of McGonagall, to which he blushed and sheepishly said, "Sorry" and slinked back to the group while the first years tried to hold back laugher.
"You... Alright then." Ron then cleared his throat, "sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow". With a wave of his wand.... Nothing happened. Scabbers didn't even wake up.
Harry then replied, "Maybe dangerous. Or both."
Ron nodded and the two boys left the castle and into the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forest. Harry knocked on the door, and they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several barks.
Snape then continued, "tell me, what would I get if added powdered root of Asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
"I think so? Mum's got a second cousin or something who's just an accountant", Ron answered.
Harry knew Draco would use that against him and just went quiet, so Draco continued.
As the boy sat, Harry noticed that he still had the black mark on his nose and snuck a look at his head, before looking outside the window.
"Its fine, nobody really knows what house they'll be in. Me? I hope Slytherin. All my family have been in there. Just imagine being in Hufflepuff or even worse, Gryffindor! I'd just leave, wouldn't you?"
Harry turned to see Ron and said, "Ron! Y-yeah, I'm ok. You?"
"Well, I mean.. You told me Slytherin is where bad wizards go, and I know that Slytherin and Gryffindor don't like each other for whatever reason."
Hermione, on the other hand, just signed and said, “Oh move over!” She pulled her wand out from her robes and said, “
The boy then looked at Harry, "I've heard of him. He's a servant, isn't he"?
Harry, Draco, and Ron couldn't believe it. They were awarded house points without any of them getting into more trouble. The teachers then told them all to return to their room as soon as possible. As they did, Draco said to Harry, "you do know you climbing on the troll's back was a extremely dumb thing to do, right?"
"Lee's got a giant tarantula down to the middle of the train"
Also sorry about the long wait. I would've put this up yesterday, but I was on a call with my dad with the DC fandome live stream, and oh my god... THE BATMAN, SNYDER CUT
"Hagrid, this is Ron", said Harry as Hagrid poured the water in a large teapot.
As they were being measured, the boy then said, "Hello, Hogwarts too?"
"Pleasure. You two better chance into your robes, I expect we'll be there soon."
"That's not fair! How come you get Potter??"
Ron laughed, "Hungry, are you?"
"They're... Dead..", Harry spoke little more than a whisper.
Harry looked at Hermione with interest, “Guarding something?”
Draco gave Harry a nasty look and simply said, "I'd be careful if I was you, Potter. Hanging around riffraff like Weasley and Hagrid and the likes.. It'll rub off on you. C'mon boys". The three left without futher incident.
"Fred, you next", the woman ushered the next boy.
Ron pulled out his very battered looking wand and raised it when the compartment door slid open again. It wasn't the toadless boy this time, but this time a girl with lost of bushy hair and was already in her New Hogwarts robes.
Ron then began to explain, "well, Slytherin is where all the bad wizards go. Even You-Know-Who went there!"
The student said, "Oh, that's Professor Snape. Our head of house. He teaches Potions, but everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after Quirrell's job for years."
"Oy, Fred! Get over here and help!"
All the students, mostly the first years gave confused and worried looks at each other.
Harry sighed in relief as the two walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Draco was boosting to Harry how good he was a flying and Harry just listened. Flying was the lesson he wss looking forward to the most. It seemed the most fun. Draco kept boosting to Harry as they entered the Hall, overhearing a small commotion over at the Gryffindor table.
"The kid with the round glasses?"
Harry said, "Oh, hey Draco."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry again leaned to Draco and asked, "Draco, what's a pureblood?"
"Back, Fang. Back." Hagrid opened the door and let them in. There was only one room with ham and pheasants hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle boiling on a open fire, and a bed with a patchwork quilt over it. Fang, the dog, was not as fierce as he looked as he started to lick Ron's ears.
"Oh, c'mon Harry. There's no way I'd be mad at you for that. Yeah, I'm surprised, no doubt. But mad? No way."
Draco and Ron looked at each other, unsure what to do.
Harry looked and saw Hagrid, who was holding two large ice creams, which made Harry smile and say, "That's Hagrid, he works at Hogwarts.
The three boys looked at each other, hoping the other would be the one who could explain this without being in any trouble. Then, out of left field, Hermione spoke up, "It was my fault Professor. They were looking for me. I went looking for the troll myself. I read all about them. If Harry, Ron, and Draco hadn't found me... I'd probably be dead..".
Harry looked at Ron, and began to introduce him, "Ron, this is Draco Malfoy. Draco this is-". A snicker that was poorly hidden by a cough escaped Ron, which made Draco go Red.
Now Harry had to know what was the problem the houses had with each other. Was it wizarding sports rivalry, or something deeper than that.
"Do it then, Weasley! Unless you're- what the??"
Ron looked at Harry as if he had another head, "Are you mad?! The Malfoys are the worst! Their whole family were dark wizards! You really shouldn't hang around him, he might corrupt you!"
"So?" Said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've known she's got no friends."
As if Uncle Vernon's snide comment about having a good term at school and leaving him at this train station wasn't bad enough, Harry trying to find the bloody platform 9 3/4 was a nightmare. Even the train guard thought he was trying to be funny when Harry asked. He was about to give up when he heard..
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?"
Harry then stood between Draco and Ron, "GUYS! Stop it! Look, Draco... What you said to Ron was totally uncalled for. Ron, I know you're mad about what he said.. But trying to fight before we've even made it to school? Look, Draco. Just apologize to Ron, please?"
He would fall asleep at his school desk the next day but the detention is a small price to pay compared to helping Harry.
“I’m sorry I’m such a crybaby.” Cassius sniffled, “I’m sorry you have to take care of me so much.”
“We will be leaving you now in the care of Uvui and Hevpu.” Iuhr said he and Quhov left the room abruptly leaving Cassius and Dudley standing in front of the two Goblins.
“An owl dropped this off by my room? Gave me a proper fright.” Dudley said, scratching the back of his neck. “Some big eagle owl type, glaring yellow eyes.”
"Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats?"
"What's going on here?", She said.
Ron gave Harry a comforting smile, "Relax Harry. Like I said, Fred likes to joke like that. I'm sure it won't be that bad".
"Stop, Stop. You're going to take someone's eye out". Snapped Hermione. "Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's
"Guys, c'mon...
At last, the desserts disappeared and Dumbledore rose again. The hall fell silent as he spoke, "a few words now that we are all fed. The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds, to everyone who does not wish a die a most painful death."
"The hat never makes a mistake". Draco said, "It puts you where you'll do best"
"Hey Ron"?, Harry began, "What's wrong with Slytherin?
Then Harry did something very brave and very stupid: he jumped on the club and once he was over its head, Harry let go of the club and ended up on the troll's shoulders and held on its head. The troll tried to shake Harry off, but Harry then stuck his wand up its noise. Draco, Ron, and Hermione gave a sound of disgust. The troll was having enough and grabbed Harry by the ankle and pulled him off, and hanged him upside down.
The boy just said miserably, "Yeah... Well, if you see him..." He then left.
This actually sparked some interest for Harry to try to keep the conversation going, "You mean like the Nimbus 2000?"
Hermione then got up and left the compartment.
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song while the hat bowed to each four tables and then became quite still again.
Harry sheepishly shrugged, "I wasn't... Um... Wizard raised.."
Harry shared with Ron the lot of his candy, as he never had anyone to share with before. Ron then explained what Chocolate Frogs where and how it's the cards you really want. Harry then turned his attention to a box of beans called, "Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans". To say Harry got a little taste of literal the box was would be an understatement. As the train passed by woods and rivers, their door once again a boy with a round face popped his head in.
"Want a hand?" Harry turned and saw it was one of the red haired twin boys.
Sorting happens and Harry wonders if he's in the right house. The boy who lived who stopped the darkest Wizard lord of all time sorted into the same house as him? Not a good sign.
Draco said casually, "A second is there to take over if you die." Catching the look on Harry's face, he added, "but that's only for proper duels. We won't kill each other, no matter how hard we try. And why are we doing it? To teach Weasley a lesson."
"Oh, oh, oh dear. Broken wrist. Come on. Up you get". Hooch gently picked up a whimpering Neville, making sure she didn't hurt his already broken wrist even more. She then spoke to the class, "Everyone is to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing. If I catch a signal broomstick in the air, the one riding it will be thrown out of Hogwarts before they can say Quidditch."
Harry then said, "Excuse me..?"
"Shut it, Malfoy."
The boy then had a surprised look on his face, "Oh.... I'm... Sorry", sounding genuinely sorry.
Hermione didn't show up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. Draco and Harry and the rest of the Slytherin joined the other houses in the Great Hall for the Halloween feast. Harry noticed that Hermione wasn't in with the Gryffindor group and when asked, Ron told him he overheard that she was crying in the bathroom. And even though he tried to hide it, Ron was ashamed of himself for making her cry. Once they entered the great Hall, the Halloween decorations put her out of the boys minds. The students were enjoying the Halloween feast when Quirrell came sprinting into the Hall with a terrified look on his face.
"Potter, what are you still doing up?", mumbled Draco, sitting up as well and rubbing his eyes.
The three boys were speechless. Never in a million years had they expected Hermione Granger to lie to a teacher. While McGonagall was shocked, she then said, Well -- in that case... Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own? 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment." She then looked at the three boys and said, "As for you three. I hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many First year students could take on a full grown troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points... Will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck."
"I thought he was a hero?? What's he doing in Slytherin??"
"Anything!" Shouted Harry, as he dodged another club swing. Thinking quickly, Ron pulled out his and pointed it the club. With encouragement from Hermione and Draco, Ron was able to levitate the club from the troll's hand. The troll was stunned to see the club not in his hand when it tried to swing at Harry once again. It dropped Harry, who scrambled to put some distance and watched with the other three as the troll looked up at its club and watched it fall on its head. The troll wobbled a bit, and fell down.
Harry could not believe what he was looking at and thought, "The Disney castle pales!"
"Can't believe he's a Slytherin."
McGonagall continued, "Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Triumphs will earn you points, and any rule breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, The house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
"Well..." Began Harry, "I would just... I dunno, try to fit in the best I can with any house I'm in..."
Ron had to agree, "Yeah... I really can't talk too much. This here is named Scabbers." Ron pointed at the rat sleeping on his lap. He continued, "He might be dead and you wouldn't know the difference. I tried to turn him yellow with a spell, but it didn't work. Wanna see"?
"You don't know? Well. Let's try again. Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a Bezoar?"
"Uh huh. Let's go."
To Harry, those words might as well fallen on deaf ears as he was too much in wonderment and excitement as he took in the sights of Diagon Alley. As Hagrid took him down the shops, pointing out each of them for Harry, Harry attention turned to a group of kids as they talk excitedly about a "Nimbus 2000" and how it's the fastest model yet. Shaking off his wonderment for a brief period, Harry looked at Hagrid and asked, "But Hagrid, how am I supposed to pay for all of this? I don't have any money".
She said, "when I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted. Abbott, Hannah!"
Draco fell back asleep, while Harry took a while to fall asleep. He still thought about what would happen if he was sorted into Gryffindor. His thoughts then went to Ron, who he hopped that he didn't hate Harry for being Slytherin and hoped he still would be willing his friend.
Harry asked a older Slytherin student, "Who's that talking to Professor Quirrell?"
"What?!"
Hooch then said, "Stick your right hand over the broom and say up"
The hat continued, "Any house you say?? Ok... Better be... SLYTHERIN!"
Harry spent at least a good 10 minutes trying to find find some Slytherins to help him find his way. When this didn't pan out, he reluctantly went to find some other students. He found a group of Gryffindors and shyly waved to them, hopefully that they would help him.
The girl continued, "I've tried a few simple spells". She pulled out her wand and pointed it at Harry's glasses. "For example.
Draco grumbled, "Potter, I sometimes think you got sorted into the wrong house."
The boy said, "He's not Fred, I am!"
McGonagall, however, still had her stern as ever expression, "thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I were to Transfigure Mr Potter and yourself into a pocket watch? That way, one of you might be on time."
The first week of Hogwarts didn't really start well for Harry, seeing how the perception of Slytherin wasn't good.
Harry then blushed and looked away, speaking lowly, "I WAS going to tell you back in the shop, y'know... Who's those two?"
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then". She sat down next to Ron, who looked taken back.
Ron looked confused, "What about her?"
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt, "A test??? In front of the whole school? I don't know any magic... What on earth would we have to do?"
Harry nodded, "Yeah, but why couldn't we just try it on without everyone watching?"
"I can't believe anyone can be so infuriating"!
Harry then said, "Hagrid! This break in happened on my birthday! It might've happens while we we're there!"
Draco pointed at the taller boy, "This is Goyle". Then pointed to the shorter one, "And this is Crabble"
Harry continued, "Yes, the thing is... I don't know..."
"Wow...", Ron said, not realizing he was staring at the scar.
Ron just shrugged, "Hey, where you off to?"
Hermione stood up at this, hand still raised.
Harry said, while still out of breath, "I don't think so, just knocked out."
Draco, Harry, and Ron couldn't stop talking to each other after their adventure. They grew closer as they theorized what could be under the trap door. Harry filled them what he knew already and the three of them were already looking forward to another adventure. Draco and Ron, while not friendly friendly, were on better terms than how they started. For one, they discovered they like the same Quidditch teams, but even with that they still argue about what other teams are better than the other. For Harry, he rather them argue and bicker about which is better than them actually fighting.
Ron and to Harry's surprise, Hermione was with him, looking very cross. Draco, however, was very amused.
As the boys played Exploding Snap, their conversation went back to what would be under the trap door.
Draco said, “He probably thought this door was locked.”
"Ello Harry! Right then. Firs' years follow me! Mind yer step!"
There was a bit of an uncomfortable silence for both boys before Harry found the courage to speak up.
Harry had never seen such strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that floated midair over four long table, where the rest of the students sat. The tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where sitting, to which McGonagall led the first years up there. Harry heard Hermione whisper "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History".
"Or what, Weasley???"
"Hey Erik, you should write a short Harry Potter chapter"
"Us Slytherins stick together, Harry. You'll see. Now go to bed, for Merlin's sake. We have classes and I don't fancy being tired for them".
Harry then said, "sooo... Are all your family wizards?"
Now Harry was getting a bit angry with this boy. Sure, the boy wasn't too bad at first besides some of the things he said, but now this was getting out of hand.
This made Harry pause and look down at his feet. While he didn't want to answer due to his fear that the boy might say something that will set him off, he didn't to appear rude.
Harry groaned as the class began to fight. He really wished his fellow Slytherins didn't act like this, trying to provoke the other students. Especially Gryffindor. As if things couldn't get worse, Ron marched to Draco, very mad.
Harry panted, "Yes please".
Harry just repeated, "I don't know sir.."
The moment Harry dreaded came when McGonagall called his name, and he grew even more antsy when the students, both the first years and the older ones began whispering and muttering. Once Harry sat, the hat dropped over his eyes and he thankfully couldn't see the peoole craning to get a good look at him.
"About?"
"Everyone in?", Hagrid shouted who had a boat to himself. Once he saw everyone was in, he finished, "Right then-- FOWARD!"
"Is it... Dead?"
My phone fucking deleted half of this and I had to rewrite this shit >:/\
A sudden rummaging for parchment and quills began as Snape said over the noise, "A point from Slytherin for your classmate's cheek."
Harry then said, “Hey Draco! Wait!”
The boy gave Harry an annoyed look and replied, "Yes exactly. He's a bit of a savage, isn't he? Living in a hut on the school grounds, getting drunk and setting his bed on fire.
Harry then looked and saw Draco with two other mean looking boys. Draco was looking at Harry with much more interest now.
Harry shook his head, starting to regret ever talking.
"Thanks", said Harry, pushing hair away from his eyes.
Harry walked up to them, again ready to split them apart if need be. They seemed not to notice him as they continued.
He leaned over to Draco and asked, "Is he a bit... Mad?"
The Prefect then said, "Welcome to the Slytherin common room. Boys dormitoies to your left. Girls, to your right. As before, never share the password to anyone. The password changes frequently, so they will be posted on the notice board. Do travel in pairs, as the other houses aren't on good terms with us. Now, off to bed you lot."
The boy narrowed his eyes at Harry.
The redhead then asked, "Anyone sitting in here? Everyone else is full". To which Harry shook his head and jestered at the seat across from him.
"Where?"
Hi mistake number 3, you and Harry will be getting to know each other.
"Yeah, but that was unfair. How was I supposed to know everything in that book?"
He sat back down while everyone clapped and cheered. Harry wasnt sure whether to laugh or not.
The boy continued, "Have you gotten your own broom yet?"
Harry couldn't believe it. It was just his first week and already lost a house point. He waa taught two things already; Snape clearly didn't favor him just because he was in Slytherin, and that assessment when he first saw Snape about not liking him? That was wrong because he was sure Snape hated him. The lesson didn't improve for Harry, save for Draco, who Snape clearly favored over them all. After the class, Harry was in very low spirits. He didn't even know why Snape hated him so much.
Harry couldn't help but feel some of this was his fault. True, he didn't want his friends to fight in the first place, but he didn't necessarily talk Draco out of it.
"Whatever it is", began Draco, "It's gotta be very Valuable."
"No way... It's you", the other twin said.
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought about his conversation to Draco about trying his best to fit in any house he's placed in.
Draco wanted to argue, but it was late enough already and all he wanted was to sleep. The next day, Harry, Ron, Draco, and Hermione bumped into each other while going for breakfast. There was a long, embarrassing silence before all 4 said ,"Thanks" quickly and ate at their tables. What they didn't expect, however, is that Hermione became friends with them. It seems that surviving dangers together does bring people closer together.
Draco smirked, "Wow Weasley. Never knew you had it in you to make someone cry."
Harry reached out for the letter which Dudley placed in his hand.
They only got a few blocks farther when Cassius cursed softly, Molly Weasely was standing before Florean Fortescue with 13-year-old Ginny Weasely as they bought ice cream together.
He set to work, he had to do something, anything, to distract himself. Eggs in the pan, bread in the toaster. Just keep moving, keep moving. He nearly burnt his hand when he heard the floorboards creak behind him,
“Messr Potter, you may follow me, Messr Dursley, you can sit on the bench [he gestured to a plush red bench on the side of the lobby], this will only take approximately 15 minutes if all goes well.” Dudley sent Harry a slightly frantic look at Iuhr’s last sentence and Harry sent an equally frantic look back.
“That actually explains… a lot.” Cassius said. “Thank you for your help Quhov and Iuhr, really, I’m extremely grateful.”
“Also look at my hair, it's so much less curly?”
With a gasp, Harry woke up, thrashing blankets from his body, and his chest heaving with panted breaths. He was alone, Dudley had left already after carefully placing Harry back in bed and tucking him in.
“Well if it isn’t a Weasley,” Draco’s pretentious voice snarled, “What are you doing so far from your burrow, rodent?”
“Yes,” Iuhr said before pressing the needle into Harry’s arm. Harry tensed. Surprisingly it was not painful, he just felt some uncomfortable pressure on his arm.
“Fine.”
“Christ! What an ass.” Dudley said patting Cassius’ back once they were well out of sight of the shop. “He was so creepy,”
“Fiducia?” Cassius asked curiously, not recognizing the spell.
he clenched his eyes shut.
“I don’t actually know,” Dudley said, chuckling at Cassius’ exasperated look.
Cassius groaned, and ran his hand through his hair, “Uh, we have to get me a new wand,”
Draco snorted before his eyes flickered over to the dark alleyway that Cassius and Dudley were hidden in. He smirked, before turning and walking in the direction of Cassius and Dudley, “Sure.”
“Definitely. We’ll give you a manual on everything you need to know, such as suppliers for her food and so forth. The enclosure you can purchase here,” Dee looked Cassius directly in their eye as she spoke, to signify the importance that he knows all of this information about the snake he was purchasing.
“You’re a child.”
“Oh, that’s good, she’s new, came in a few days ago. She’s a rosy boa, five years old, who came from a wizard illegally transporting wild animals from Mexico and the United States. He spells them too so most are pretty traumatised once they arrive. She’s lucky to just have been hit with a long life spell before he was busted by Aurors. Most snakes are subjected to anti-hibernation spells, anti-consumption spells, and so forth. Either way though, it’s easy for her to fall ill so you have to make sure she eats well and is kept warm. Any deviation in temperature and diet can have fatal effects on her.” Dee explained as she opened the cage door and the rosy boa compliantly slid out into her hand.
Abruptly Harry felt a lurching feeling in his stomach and Dudley clenched his arm tighter.
"Get up!" A nasal voice screeched. He rolled his eyes and stood, he walked to the door and swung it open.
Later, Dudley would sneak into his room, they would peel his shirt from his bloodsoaked body. Dudley would have a pail of water, a washcloth and soap. Harry would wince every time the soap neared too close to his wounds and he would muffle the cries and whimpers into his ratty bed sheet. Dudley would apologize repeatedly as he too struggled to keep winces and tears in. With Dudleys help they would carefully apply antibiotic cream onto his wounds, tracing patterns into the sticky layer it would leave as they tried to ignore why the cream was there in the first place.
It spoke,
“What does ‘keyed’ mean?”
He was screaming, he knew that, but he could not hear it. All he could hear was the blood pounding in his ears as hot wet tears streamed down his face and Vernon’s maniacal laughter.
“He said my name Dudley, my
“Glamour charms are placed upon a person to alter their physical attributes, and curses are placed upon a person to alter their characteristics, their mentality and in most cases their trust and loyalty.” Quhov explained simply, Dudley still looked confused but declined to comment. Quhov looked terrifying.

“Hello Harry,” Vernon said, a sneer twisting his words. Usually, he would always do this alone, in the basement, where not even the neighbours would hear. However tonight was different, he did not move forward to drag Harry down the stairs, instead he unbuckled his heavy leather belt and held it in his meaty hands threateningly as he advanced upon Harry. Harry whimpered, edging backwards.
He reacted before he heard the thudding of Vernon’s feet as they climbed up the stairs,
Dozens of hissed voices responded excitedly overlapping each other but the sentiment was the same. A speaker was amongst them.
Frank did not like policemen.
“Fine, if I win I get to go with you.”
He hissed back and then wished that he could hit his head on a wall and be dead.
“You are Harry Potter, then?” The goblin gestured to Harry who nodded. The Goblin turned around and began walking towards one of the tall desks. Harry and Dudley tensely followed him. The goblin they were following said something in a foreign tongue to the goblin sitting at the desk. The goblin at the desk climbed down and walked forward to Harry and Dudley.
“You are a prick and I’m coming with you,” Dudley said, “It’s final.”
“Best of three?” Harry sheepishly suggested. Dudley immediately protested shaking his head,
“It’s fine Dudley, go home. You can stop by tomorrow. I’ll show you Diagon Alley.” Cassius said, his words slurring together.
“Probably.”
“What? You can’t come.” Harry said with an air of finality.
“Fuck,” Cassius mutter, “Hide me, Dudley,”
name,” Cassius explained as he led them to stand in an alleyway away from the prying eyes of the one and only Molly Weasely.
‘I am 14!’ // The story takes place right after Harry’s 14th birthday.
Quhov gave him a condescending look, “It might, it might not.”
“Pretty much,” Dudley agreed, “What did that boy say? I couldn’t hear him,”
i just wanted to pop in here to apologise for the weird line spacing about halfway through the chapter, i have no idea what happened and i attempted to fix it a few times but it simply was not working
“You ready?” Harry asked Dudley,
“This needs to be full,” Iuhr said, guessing at Harry’s question.
“Why can’t you just use your old one, it was chosen for you for a reason right?”
“I understand,” Cassius said, standing up again, “How much?”
Cassius chuckled and dutifully stepped forward. Standing still under the scrutiny of the ancient wizard, he had - with the help of Iuhr - glamoured his face to hide his scar and blind eye. Iuhr feared that doing anything more might damage the body's slow healing process as it was adjusting to taking off a mask. Like a newborn babe, it had to be treated with care and resilience.
“Don’t answer questions with another question,”
He hadn’t bothered to buy new clothes but ultimately decided that purchasing new clothes would have to wait till he had the boa settled.

Harry stayed in the chair for a few moments, because of the threat of Sirius Black the Dursleys had permitted him the books he would need for summer homework but kept his wand tightly locked up. He did not bother to attempt to unlock it, it was a futile attempt that would lead to much worse repercussions in the first place. He had not started on any of the essays and exercises that he was assigned, he did not plan on it either. He would most likely end up copying Hermione’s answers on the train. He and Ron did that every year. He had managed to smuggle a book to his room, it was a simple book that Ron had given him as a joke,
He looked over apprehensively and regretted it immediately. He could see his blood run slowly through the needle and into the bowl at the other end of the tool.
.” Draco Malfoy stood in all his bloody flamingo glory at the maw of the alley.
After leaving the shop with their purchases Cassius spotted a pet shop across the street. “Let’s go there,” He said, gesturing to ‘Red’s Reptile Retail’.
Cassius peered down at the snake,
Dudley placed the placemats on the table, and went to the drawer to pull out the utensils, “Just- just promise me, if you ever get a chance, get out of here?” He said lowly. Harry frowned but nodded his head in agreement.
“What the hell was that?” Dudley whispered to Cassius, “He knows your father?”
“Ow! What the fuck!” Dudley shouted back.
“Christ, I didn’t know that you could run that fast,” Cassius complained, panting as he bent forward leaning his hands onto his knees as he struggled to regain his breath.
“Whatever Dudley, it’ll be fine,” Cassius said, swallowing his frustration back down. Merlin, everything was always difficult for him, even if he was not Harry Potter anymore. The curse still hung like a mocking mobile of doom above his head, on this particular mobile hung childish images of happy families, emerald eyes, and a curse that ruined his life.
Iuhr sits in the chair facing the door and gestured to Harry to sit in the other one. Harry does so. Quhov takes place by the door.
“Hey, Harry,”
Iuhr and Quhov // keyboard slams
“Boy!” Vernon shouted beckoning Harry over, who winced and walked up to stand just behind Vernon.
Cassius shuddered at the thought of the needle again, “You know what? Nevermind, I’m sure I can figure it out by myself. The spell is not effective anymore either way. So I will be able to determine who I was keyed to trust pretty easily.”
also, thank you all so much for the kudos I'm in awe <3
Cassius had enough, “Hey Ginger pack it up and fuck off, have you got nothing better to do?”
“It’s an illegal spell, if placed upon someone it can cause them to trust the person it is keyed blindly.” Quhov explained, “In your case it was keyed to multiple people.”
“Oh,” Dudley paused, “Oh, shit, Vol-, that guy?” Cassius nodded, “You can’t mean that turban diary guy who tried to kill you?”
“That’s what I- you know what? Nevermind.” Dudley said.
“Dude, he is like, a billion years old, he knows everything.” Dudley said, “Theory: Ollivander is God.” He continued.
“Okay, let's get out of here,” Cassius switched to English to speak to Dudley,
“That sounds like quite a predicament.” Dudley stated point-blank.
What felt like an agonizing hour later, [it was really only less than 30 seconds] Iuhr carefully removed the needle from Harry’s arm. A bandaid was magically wrapped around his arm and Harry cringed at the small dot of blood that seeped through the pristine white bandage.
He took the eggs from the pan and placed them on the toast. It sizzled slightly and Harry’s mouth watered as he stared down at the meals. He sighed softly and turned away, he poured the milk into the glass, the coffee into the mug and boiled water for tea. He stooped down to pull a teabag out from the drawer. After finding the correct bag he stood up and had to brace himself on the counter. There were black spots dancing in his vision and everything around him was swimming. He could feel bile rising in his throat. He let out a small gasp, willing the sick taste on the back of his tongue to go away. When his vision somewhat steadied he carefully brought the plates and drinks to the table. His throat was stinging and tasted acidic. He swallowed the spit in his mouth. It didn’t help.
Ollivanders popped up from behind the register, like a rubber creature in a game of whack-a-mole. Cassius briefly wished he had an oversized hammer.
knight//Parsel Tongue -> only real indicator that he is Harry Potter as Harry Potter is the only known parseltongue speaker other than voldemort
“Mate, I know, I’ve been trying not to laugh the entire time.” Cassius responded, his face splitting into a grin.
“Sorry, merlin,” Cassiuslaughed,
Cassius let out an awkward chuckle, “No?”
Cassius shrugged in response and Iuhr gave him a galleon.
As he blinked the sleep out of his eyes he bent forward pressing his forehead against his knees. A searing pain cut through his head and his eyes blurred with tears, his scar. His scar was burning.
“Firecrotch?” Dudley began laughing and Cassius gladly joined him. They quietly returned to Gringotts where Iuhr welcomed them.
“The blood examination itself does not take long, the results will take a few minutes to appear.” A thin needle-like device appears in a floating metal bowl beside Iuhr. Upon closer inspection it is a device with a syringe for the tip and a small bowl at the end.
“You two can sleep in the surgical ward, there are always free beds. I understand you are a muggle so if you want to return home we have portkeys available.”
“The shop has chosen these three wands. Try them.” Ollivander said, placing three dust-covered black boxes before them. “Your father tried these too, none of them worked for him, but I believe one will work for you. Your father was more of an optimist, despite what his fate had in store for him.”
“Harry?” Dudley said. He had been brought to the examination room by Quhov whilst Cassius was thinking.
“Maybe you should sleep some more Caz,” Dudley said, pulling Cassius’ arm over his shoulder. “You’re exhausted.”

“Dudley wanna come with me to Diagon Alley? I gotta get a new wand and-” Cassius stumbled and leant on the table.
“Maybe,” Cassius said, raising his eyebrow, Ollivander looked like the Cheshire cat if the Cheshire cat was a furless cat with glasses and wizarding robes and it was not a pleasing sight to see.
, it was an old book that he had nicked from Bill. He had doodled a lightning bolt onto the first page and written,

“You’ve been cursed, glamoured and possibly had the unforgivables used on you.” Iuhr said, analysing the paper, “This parchment contains all of you and your families properties and your vaults. Unfortunately the Potter name is not yours and thus its vault is no longer yours to access. If there is anything personal within the Potter vault you wish to retrieve, you may come and consult Quhor or me in the following week only.”
“Ooh, did I strike a nerve daffy?” Fred jeered, looking over at his twin who was starting to look slightly uncomfortable with the situation.
That was his blood, oh that is gross, he thought to himself briefly before he realised exactly what was written on the parchment.
the small boa hissed, poking her head out of Cassius’ pocket,
Dudley muttered a quick, “Good luck mate,” before strolling over to the bench and ensconcing himself onto the plush maroon cushion looking outright pleased with himself.
“How is that guy even alive anyways, he must be like a million years old,” Dudley said.
“Shit,” Dudley said, “How the fuck did he know?”
“Yes, sir?” He asked politely.
The kitchen was deserted, and Harry closed his eyes, briefly imagining a life where he would be sitting at the dining table, happily enjoying a meal with his mother and father sitting beside him. Maybe a younger sibling throwing their breakfast around. He imagined their smiles and their faces before the vision shattered as he reminded himself that that was a life he could never have.
Vernon grabbed the back of his neck and most of his hair as he shouted gleeful insults, Harry cowered away bringing his arms up to shield his face. Vernon lashed the whip across Harry’s forearms, bruising and cutting into the sore skin. Harry screamed. For a moment, Vernon stilled, just a moment, and Harry lowered his arms, his face bloomed with pain before he registered that Vernon had lashed the belt across the side of his face. Harry fell to the ground, sobbing clutching the side of his face. Smiling Vernon flogged his back repeatedly, till Harry couldn’t tell whether or not he still held the belt in the air or if it was making contact with his back.
“Unfortunately yes.”
king// ? idk haven’t thought of these yet
“Draco,” Cassius corrected softly but he knew better than to look for the blonde boy. It was better if they did not cross paths at all.
Cassius responded.
‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ ᶠʳᵉⁿᵉᵗⁱᶜ ☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙
“Uh- yeah?” He said, rubbing the drowsiness out of his eyes.
He had never wanted to work at Grunnings, he thought it was unfavourable work especially for himself. He would rather be anything but a director of a drilling company like his father but he said nothing. Vernon expected a lot from his son, and Dudley never felt he could live up to any of the expectations.
“Fuck off,” Cassius ribbed between heaving breaths.
Cherry hissed, before settling back down onto the red-haired girl's neck.
“Remember Messr Riddle, even though the spell is gone you have still trusted these people before. It may be that you are used to it and your brain will believe they are trustworthy even if they are not.” Iuhr warned Cassius.
Frank was undeterred, these ‘wizards’ as they called themselves were not allowed in the house. That was breaking and thus wholly illegal. He frowned, “I’ll report you, this is not your house.” He managed. He hoped there was no fear in his voice yet the sitting man still laughed in a croaky cry that sounded like the crackling static of a broken radio.
finally an update haha, my computer is dying as i write this so i have to make this quick, but thank you all so much for the support. i've been going through a bit of a difficult time recently and honestly writing is my personal little escape from reality. i love you all, <3

“Well, here we are,” Cassius announced, “Ollivanders.”
“And the withdrawals continue back 13 years from the last withdrawal, since the moment you came into possession of the Potter Vault. They all had the key so the goblins allowed them in but recently as you are of age we found it strange that they arrived without your accompaniment to withdraw money for who we assumed was you.”  Iuhr explained.
Cassius rolled his eyes and pushed the green door open, a jovial bell jingling to signify their entry.
“Jesus fu-”
He had just enough time to dodge before a spell was shot his way, “Christ, Dudley, I really think we should run now.” Cassius pressed a hand to his breast pocket to ensure that the boa wouldn’t fall out and he and Dudley sprinted down the alley, Fred’s loud mouth following them the entire way as George tried to usher his twin away.
Harry shrugged, “Can Dudley come with us?”
“Lemme read it,” Dudley pulled the letter out of Harry’s hand and skimmed through it.
cassius and dudley go to diagon alley, cassius gets a wand, they meet draco, cassius verbally abuses fred in an unforgivable way and a house kidnaps cassius [cassius has stockholm syndrome]
He learned nothing from the book, there was no explanation for his scar at all. Absolutely nothing. That terrified him.
“That’s a lot Haz, I mean, Caz?” Dudley paused, “Are you sure you don’t want to rest for a bit? You can sleep here and we can pick this up again after lunch. It’s nearly two and you haven’t eaten yet.”
“That’s terrible,” Dudley said, biting his lip as he listened to what Dee was saying,
Harry would fall asleep on Dudley’s shoulder emaciated and exhausted while Dudley would stay awake for hours longer making sure that Harry does not scratch his healing skin as he usually does subconsciously in his sleep.
Harry made his way back to the sink, swaying slightly. He had just managed to lean against the wooden counter when the galumphing steps of Vernon Dursely could be heard as he stumbled down the stairs.
Exactly two hours later Cassius slowly blinked awake to Dudley leaning over him a wicked smile on his face.
“It’s similar to ‘Accio’, you just say ‘Fidacio’ and then the person's full name. It’s very dark magic,” Quhov elaborated. “There’s barely any way to find out who even placed it let alone who it was keyed to.”
underneath the drawing. Harry had laughed but had read the entire book that first night, and again the next and so forth till he had memorised the book and fallen asleep in class multiple times.
“Fucking hell indeed,” He agreed passing the letter back to Harry.
“98 Galleons, in total, for both the snake and an enclosure,” Dee said she was heading to the back and pulled a glass enclosure from the back, it was of a medium size but Cassius wondered how exactly he planned on carrying it around for a few weeks. “It’s a magical enclosure, you can adjust the size as you wish. I understand that you want to travel with her at the moment so it can be made smaller. You can carry her for now.” Dee stacked a thick parchment manual above the enclosure, ‘Reds Reference to Reptiles’. “The manual costs an additional 20 sickles.” She said unapologetically.
“What, trillions of years ago?” Dudley muttered under his breath but froze as a child caught with his hand in a cookie jar when Ollivanders' enlarged eyes beneath his thick glasses flicked over to catch Dudleys. They had a staring contest for a few moments before Dudley coughed and looked away.
“‘Kay, let me know if you need anything.” Dudley gave her a thumbs up and they ambled through the store. They passed multi-coloured chameleons and gigantic Komodo dragons who hissed angrily when they passed. Along the left side of the store were dozens upon dozens of enclosures just for snakes of all colours and sizes.
“I suppose so, there is, but none of the Goblins here at Gringotts would be able to figure that out, we would need to send a sample of your blood to a magic based branch. It is unlikely that they will figure it out though.”
“I can stay right?”
“Okay, lemme see it.” Cassius said, a dreadful feeling already creeping over him.
The house seemed to understand who stood before its gates and let Cassius in, the doors groaned as they swung open slowly and the foyer burst into light as the chandelier lit up like a Christmas tree. The house welcomed his presence by showering him in phosphorescence and he had never felt more at home than in the foyer of a house that seemed to sing his name through the magic that held it together
The chair spun around and Frank stepped back aghast his body nearly convulsing with fear and horror,
“Sorry,
“Uh, duh.” Cassius said instinctively, causing the Quhov to quietly groan.
The snake reared his head, and sprung towards Frank, hissing loudly. Frank yelled out and stumbled backwards. He grunted as he felt himself being lifted from the floor, by seemingly nothing.
“You tell me,” Dudley agreed, grimacing after a wizard quite unceremoniously banged into his shoulder and cursed Dudley out with a quick, “Watch it
Harry waited with a baited breath as the blood slowly started to bleed onto the page. Instead of forming an odd-looking blob on the paper, he could start to make out words as they formed in the spirals of his blood.
Iuhr smiled and Quhovs frown only lessened slightly.
“She does not often react well to magic, she seems to be okay with simple magic, like warming spells which you must cast on her conditionally if you decide to take her out in this horrid weather,” Dee said, stroking the rosy boa's head as she spoke. It was cloudy outside with a slight biting chill to the air despite it being well into the summer vacation.
“Rock, Paper, Scissors shoot!” Dudley said,
“Pettigrew, tell me, how do you plan to do this?”
“Messr Riddle, it’s a long process to remove all these spells. It will take some time for us to carefully unweave the glamors and curses because the magic placed upon you is like an intricately woven tapestry made by a very talented weaver. We’re going to have to pick each thread loose one by one.”
‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ ᶠʳᵉⁿᵉᵗⁱᶜ ☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙
“Merlin,” Dudley mocked.
Cassius laughed weakly, “More like the son of Voldemort.”
“What will your parents say?”
Harry was unsurprisingly stuck on his name.
He carefully stepped out of his bed and reached for the wardrobe where he had hidden a stack of paper and pens. Hedwig’s cage was empty but he would send the letter when she returned. She knew by now to go through Dudley’s window.
He told them of the young boy he had seen walking past the gates but the policemen ruled it as the ramblings of a lonely man trying to escape the law.
It was merely Dudley, his cousin. He let out a sigh of relief.
The maid found them the next morning, all three of them lying on their backs, glassy-eyed and still in their dinner clothes. Her scream woke the entire village. The police conducted a search and found no evidence of foul play, the family was perfectly healthy and the papers would call it
“Well, clearly it was not for me.” Cassius said, a strange look came on his face. “They’ve been taking my, no- the Potters money without their permission since they’ve died? That’s low.”
Vernon let out a bark of laughter, “Another company, crumbled to the dust, of course, that won’t happen with you right Dudders?” He proclaimed brandishing the incriminating article before Dudley’s face. Dudley gave an awkward smile and nodded, turning back to his breakfast with a grimace on his face.
INT. the room behind the red door was illuminated by eight torches, two hung on each wall. The middle of the room held two iron chairs, next to each other but facing different directions. One to the wall with the door and the other to the farthest wall from the door. The floor had a red circle painted on it that surrounds the two chairs.
“About the ministry?” Pettigrew said, twisting his fingers into his shirt,
“Well, it seems the wand has chosen its master,” Ollivander said, a strange look on his face.
“Can I get Dudley for the process?” Cassius asked as an afterthought.
Messr // I am aware that Messrs is plural for Mr but I wanted to illustrate exactly how I believed the Goblins were saying it.
“If that’s okay with Cassius. I don’t want my parents to be suspicious.”
Cassius awkwardly tried to balance the shopping bags he was carrying on his arm while Dudley kept a wide berth from the small snake's beady eyes.
George shrugged in response to Fred’s question, “Look at the clothes, it’s obviously a
“Is it a bad time to tell you that I am terrified of needles?” Harry said fearfully.
“As we suspected,” Iuhr said, satisfaction lacing his tone, “everything in your life has been a lie.”
“Cassius, I would literally give you to Satan if you do not get me this,” Dudley said, holding up a mug, covered in tiny cats tangled in yarn. When you filled the mug with a hot liquid the tiny cats grew demon horns and tails and began strangling other cats with the yarn they were playing with.
“Oh fuck my parents.”
There was one less inhabitant in Little Hangleton that night.
“What? No. I’m coming with you, obviously.” Dudley immediately protested.
“What would they mean by that?”
his subconscious begged as he stood up by his bed, fists clenched painfully. He was not as lucky as he hoped he would be.
Cassius handed over the appropriate amount. He had sorted out his account with Quhov and nearly fainted at the sheer amount of money in the Riddle Vault. He took the packaged wand from Ollivander with a sullen smile and motioned to Dudley to get out of here as quickly as possible.
“Hey, Caz isn’t that, that, kid you always complain about?” Dudley suddenly asked.
Harry, no Cassius, maybe Tom, knew he should be listening but honestly had zoned off halfway through Iuhrs first sentence. He was unfortunately still hung up on his name. What an unfavourable name. He grimaced thinking of how he would have to tell Ron and Hermione. Ron would laugh, most likely. Then again, Hermione’s name was well, Her-my-oh-nee. Hermione. That was also a weird name. She would probably be sympathetic.
“Of course I can,” Dudley paused, “Stop saying ‘what’ you’ve said it like three times already.”
Dumbledore said nothing as he read through the letter. It was a simple letter containing only six words,
Iuhr rolled his eyes, “As I was saying before you interrupted me, do you want to go through the removal of all these spells?”

“Merlin, we’re packed like sardines here,” Cassius muttered, pushing past wizards and witches to get back to Dudley’s side.
1937 // the red door had the numbers 1937 painted on it which is unironically the same year the comedy ‘Dangerous Number’ was released so that is the symbolism behind it for those who were curious.
“Figures, it was a holly wand,” Ollivander said as if it explained it all. Cassius sniffed and picked the next one up. It seemed to work for just a moment before sparks of green flames shot out of the tip and nearly blinded him. Again.
“Hey, do you mind setting the table?” He asked, pointing to the pan he was handling.
“Cardinal,” Cassius corrected, but gratefully passed his bags over to Dudley. He flipped through the manual to find the appropriate spell. Once he was in a more comfortable area he would read through it more thoroughly.
He landed on his back staring up at the sky as the snake grumpily hissed as she slithered in his breast pocket. He supposed Dudley was not coming on this adventure with him which he secretly was glad for. He needed some time to think, this was the perfect place. Bleary-eyed and dizzy he slowly pushed himself up to look at the view.
rook// Cassius Tom Riddle -> his name, only a select few know who the Riddles are and it would take a lot of searching to figure it out if you are not one of those people
“Oh, mate, that sucks. I’m sorry,” Dudley said awkwardly, “Look, I don’t know how to react, I feel like laughing, this is a really weird moment alright.”
heavy with dialogue as per usual because i love writing people talking
“Well shit,” He said out loud, scrambling to his feet. He heard his voice echo which would be scientifically impossible however considering that this was a magical house common muggle science would not apply.
Cassius // I chose the name partially as a joke because there is another character in GoF called Cassius and I plan to use him more actively in this story and because the name Cassius means empty.
He should go by his middle name. He really should.
Cassius groaned inwardly but dug into his pockets to procure a cheque slip, Quhov had begrudgingly given a booklet to him after discovering that Cassius had never used a cheque book. The Weasely’s never spent more than they had to. [For amounts larger than 50 ʛ it was recommended to use a cheque considering it was insane to carry around more than 50 ʛ.] Once having filled it in he handed the slip to Dee, who looked it over and shooed them out of the store with a smile.
He picked the last one up and swished it around awkwardly. At first, nothing happened before he felt small slivers of warmth seep into his hand as if the wand was comforting him. A small cloud of silver fireflies showered from the tip and hovered around Cassius.
“Messrs Dursley and Riddle, this procedure to remove all the glamour charms and curses will be held in the surgical sect of Gringotts. It will be long and intricate, afterwards you will look different and possibly act differently depending on all the charms placed upon you. We will be giving you a parchment in which states what charms were placed upon you. Afterwards we will be evaluating your finances and discussing the anomalies in the Potter vault for they occurred in your time as Harry Potter.”
“Reckon the real Harry Potter is dead?” Cassius asked no one in particular.
“My eyes! Oh merlin, why is this one red and this one, grey?”
“Oh, we have a guest.” the sitting man said, his back still turned but his hand was raised. “Thank you for letting me know Nagini.” He was talking to the snake. Pettigrew recoiled and whimpered as Frank was dragged through the air.
so guess whos back, giving you anothore chapter cause i said i would <3
“We’re just looking,” Cassius said apologetically. Dee did not seem put down at all,
“Okay Caz,” Dudley laughed as he followed Iuhr and Quhov out of the office.

“Of course not,” He smiled.

“Good night Messr Riddle.” the second Goblin, Hevpu said.
knows my father.”
,” Cassius said before slapping a hand over his mouth. He could hear Dudley wheeze behind him.
“What did you call me?” Fred turned a shade to rival his hair,
Harry breathed a sharp breath in, “Yes sir.”
Harry frowned. “Rock, Paper, Scissors?”
“Excuse my manners, my name is Cardinal Red, this is my family's store. Just call me Dee. What can I do for you today?”
He stumbled slightly forward and the grin dropped off of his face in an instant, “‘m sorry.” He mumbled, rushing down the stairs. He gripped onto the bannister slightly harder than he normally would.
He bowed, “Greetings Messr Potter and Messr Dursley, I am Iuhr, I will be in charge of your blood exam today. That is Quhov, he will be joining us.” Iuhr gestured to the goblin who had brought them to Iuhr.
“Not in the blood exam room itself but he can join us afterwards for the final evaluation of results,” Iuhr said matter-of-factly.

“Cassius!” Dudley shouted out, blindly reaching for Cassius’ arm as he was nearly lost amongst the throng of people.

“May I go upstairs?” He asked quietly, his head bowed and his hands clutched behind his back.
Cassius took a moment to look at himself, “Oh… that is a big scar.”
“That’s not going to scar, is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
he repeated in his head.
“Who is Malfoy talking to?” They were interrupted by the terrible twins.
“Cardinal, I would like this one.”
“Tell me, how many days have you been here?”
“Scooch over, I want to read it too.” Dudley said, Harry shuffled to the side so that Dudley could sit sideways on the bench.
“Stand still, useless scum.” As Vernon stepped closer Harry could smell the stench of alcohol infiltrating his senses and his eyes watered.
“Ooh, did I strike a nerve fire crotch?” Cassius mocked.
Harry bit his tongue and pulled his sleeve down. During his and Quhovs short exchange Iuhr had stood and poured the contents of the tool onto a small piece of parchment and unravelled it onto the floor of the room. The chairs disappeared and Harry fell to the floor with a thump.
“How disappointing, that a muggle gardener was spying on me. Not very interesting.” The sitting man seemed amused.
“Wait till we’re finished, you do not leave the kitchen till everyone has finished eating and till you have cleaned up.” Vernon abrasively said.
Quhov extended his hand, “May we have the key to your vault?”
queen//Harry Potter -> the fact that he technically is Harry Potter
“And a muggle,” the sitting man said, and Frank dropped from the air landing with a thump on the carpet.
“Okay then.” Cassius said and he laid down on the soft cot.
?” Harry responded confused, Dudley could not come with him, Dudley was a muggle.
Cassius grimaced, he sneezed and picked up the first one, the moment he picked it up a feeling of dread immediately settled into him and he placed it back down immediately.
“I’ll remember that, thanks.” Cassius said, “Now can someone please get me a mirror, I would like to admire myself.” Dudley choked on a laugh, Quhov rolled his eyes and a small hand mirror appeared before Cassius.
harrys scar hurts, he recieves a letter from gringotts, he gets stabbed with a needle and dudley is there
“On one hand I feel like laughing and on the other I feel like sobbing for hours on end.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, he spun around lifting his hand to lightly touch his breast pocket where the tiny snake lay writhing in it. “Hey, Draco,”
good.”
Ginny scowled but moved to stand by her mother, out of seemingly nowhere the twins appeared. Their usual mischievous faces were shadowed by a dark grimace as they stared at Draco. The three were the same height, but Draco somehow managed to stare down the entire family.
“Or maybe you're just slow,” Dudley said, equally as breathless and in the same position as Cassius.
Cassius had not thought about that before Iuhr had even said it but his mind was racing a mile a minute, trying to think of what he would say to everyone, how he would explain he was the son of the very monster that they had been trying to kill even before his parents had even attended Hogwarts. No, wait, Harry’s parents. At that thought, who even was Harry Potter? If he wasn’t Harry Potter… who was?
“What?
“Dudley, I am having very mixed feelings about this.”
“It’s, uh, it’s Cassius now.” He said, anxiously pushing the parchment towards Dudley who carefully read through it.
“M-master, we can capture him with the aid of… of.” A squeaky voice stuttered.
“It’s a reed wand with a dragon heartstring, 28 centimetres, classified as rigid. Those are the hardest to cast, rigid wands, but they are powerful. That wand has been sitting in the storage room for over 300 years. It’s temperamental, you’re a very lucky wizard.” Ollivander explained as he packaged the wand. “It costs 10 Galleons,” He announced.

“Oh,” Cassius said, he was not sure why the information felt like a stab in the chest. He was sure that Ollivander was talking about his father and his father was dead, after all, Cassius had killed his father himself. Either way, a sick feeling twisted in his gut.
“That would be fucking crazy.” Cassius said, “Can you block the account? So no one can have access to it? Keep the key, I won't be needing it. I assume Dumbledore takes it from my trunk when I return to Hogwarts.” He pushed the golden key that Iuhr had left on the table back to him.
“Fucking hell,” Harry breathed out.
It rumbled and echoed and Cassius laughed.
boys, bloody poof.” Cassius didn’t like the way they were saying 'muggle', as if it were an insult.
Frank Bryce looked up from the hedge he was clipping. Usually, he would be in bed listening to the staticky radio, that his wife had bought him for his birthday before she had passed, and smoking a pipe. However, he had a gut feeling that something terrible was going to happen tonight. Frank Bryce was a superstitious man and listened to his gut, so he stayed up.
The door made a loud screeching noise when they entered and a red-haired girl appeared before them, Cassius had to stop himself from flinching out of reflex. She was a tall girl with a slim face, she smiled widely, even though there was a red snake wrapped around her neck. She grinned wider when she noticed Cassius staring, “You like her? She’s a beaut, isn’t she? Her name is Cherry, she’s a red racer snake. She’s two meters long, isn’t that incredible?” The red-haired girl said, Cherry lifted her head and hissed at Cassius,

Draco grinned broadly now, “Are you really Cassius?”
“This is the financial activity of the Potter vault for the 14 years you were in possession of it.” Iuhrs points to the numbers in a log on the side of the parchment, “This is what was withdrawn from the account and who withdrew it. We decided to report his anomaly because of the sheer amount and frequency of the withdrawals.”
Uvui and Hevpu started the procedure while a shocked but amused Dudley held Cassius’ hand the entire time.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry and practically dragged him out of the common room. Harry whined as they started to walk towards the trophy room. He really wasn't in the mood to duel, regardless of who it's between. They made their way to the third floor, without running into Filch and into the trophy room. They were the only ones there and so they waited. Harry was slowly falling back to sleep when he heard two familiar voices:
McGonagall then returned to her desk as Harry and Ron both sat at the only empty desk. They were able to finish the rest of the class without much trouble. The next class was charms, to which was taught by a Professor Flitwick, a tiny Wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of his class he took roll call, and when he reach Harry's name, he gave a excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
