in a very fundamental way.
His stomach coiled, tighter and tighter. His probation required that he complete his N.E.W.T.s
“Weasley thinks we’re boyfriends,” Malfoy says, the inflection turning it into a question.
, Draco had answered, wrong-footed, and the Headmistress smiled, said,
“Yeah,” answered Potter, unhurried.
He had moved on to the cloisters in the western wing when Potter asked him about it.
Hogwarts would be enough to undo centuries of wards.
“Sometimes I don’t think you realize you’re a wizard,” Draco said in mild disgust.
“You’re humoring me,” said Draco flatly. His chest heaved. He was breathless with the force of his own voice, the number of words he’d hammered out after the weeks of near silence. A prickle of unease dripped down his spine at the realization, and at the accompanying realization that he had subjected Potter, of all the people, to one of his bloody tirades—!
Draco raised an eyebrow in her direction, then made the mistake of looking at Potter as he turned away. Potter’s fist was resting on the desktop, still closed around the letter, an irrepressible grin stretched across his reddened face.
,” he told her, and began to cry.
Potter blinked at him. He said, disbelievingly, “You’re not sure.”
, he’d said, and Draco heard the warning in his tone and was chastised and infuriated by turn.
When he opened his eyes, Potter was still next to him and the light had moved several inches into the space between them, closer now to Potter than Draco. If the bell rang, Draco hadn’t heard it.
“Merlin and Morgana
But Astoria was sitting primly atop a desk next to Zeller and Queensbury, who was in conversation with Lovegood, of all people. And next to Lovegood, who was sitting serenely on the floor, was Potter, who straightened up when Draco walked into the room. Granger, tucked between Potter and Weasley, gave Draco a hard nod.
Office Evergreen grunted as he stood, the sound of the chair scraping backwards sending unpleasant shivers skittering down Draco’s spine. Officer Abbott-Jones checked the binding spell, and Officer Evergreen picked up the gray file with
is a bad idea.
It’s a better idea than discussing the feasibility of sneaking Malfoy into Grimmauld Place without the knowledge of its secret keeper, in any case.
Through it all, too, Draco was thinking about the wards, and the denial, and that brief explanation that was so offensive for its easy dismissal. It only made him angrier and agitated the more he thought about it. There were other ways to deal with the wards. There had to be. The wards had been in place for a long time, but that didn’t mean they were immutable features. Surely other people have figured out ways around it. Surely other places had done this before.
“Alright, you remember the drill,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, as if it had not been several months since Draco last saw her. She waved the other officer away. “Potions check, magical signature check, wand check, then interview.”
Draco’s magic whirled through him as if a blockage was released, the hair-raising tingle of it rushing across his skin. He thought
Moonlight slid quietly across the floor and walls as the night wore on, the shape of the tower becoming more and more evident. Zeller disappeared for half an hour and came back with even more Hufflepuffs and a basket of snacks, led by an exhausted looking Prefect who took one look at what was going on, pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers and said, “You know it’s nearly two in the morning, right?”
at Draco about it. It made Draco furious, and it made him more furious that he was stuffing
Harry isn’t stupid. There are things that can last, and then there’s the incoming combustion of him and Malfoy. This is something that is meant to end in acrid smoke.
, Draco thought, and laughed, brought to his knees from the pain, his forehead pressed against the damp grass.
“I’m not,” Malfoy says. He pauses, every part of him stilling; says, with frustration, “I’m not upset.”
“I don’t want to,” he said, staring hard at the anti-nausea potions as he placed them in neat rows. “I just think about it.”
“How so?” she asked, affronted, as she swept back towards him and reclaimed her teacup.
That doesn’t mean Harry can’t
He opens them when Malfoy’s touch retreats, asking, “Any others?”
“Good morning,” Baddock said, with determination reminiscent of Gryffindors.
Draco previously thought that he did not want to talk about the whole messy slew of it, the war and its aftermath and his own strangling culpability, only to find that once he’d started, he hadn’t been able to stop.
Draco felt lightheaded with a fury he hadn’t felt in a long, long while. “Well you
Astoria inhaled audibly. “Draco,” she said, very evenly, “are you actually coming, or not?”
Draco swallowed, twice, before lifting his head and saying, “I’m sorry you had to see that, Headmistress.”
Malfoy, apparently reflexively, grabs his left forearm and squeezes, hard enough that Harry imagines the bones are grinding together. He continues, in a very even voice, “I had to use an Unforgivable.”
Draco’s breathing felt a little quick. “So that’s it, is it? I’m a bit sad about it all, so we’ve moved right along to pitying me?”
Malfoy closes that small gap of space between them, his hands traveling up from Harry’s hips to his waist, overlapping each other along Harry’s spine. It’s not quite a hug. Just—a motion. A way to check that Harry is real and solid.
“Am I meant to show up by myself, then?” Draco pressed a finger to the gilded frame, its engraved vines twisting away at the touch.
Draco stopped going to classes. It was a laughably easy thing to do, easier than it felt in sixth year. When a full week went by without so much as a whisper about his lack of attendance, Draco stopped going to the Great Hall for mealtimes, too. The kitchens were a short way from Slytherin house, and he was less likely to encounter his classmates there in any case.
“Morning,” Potter said, easily, like they did this all the time. Like their relationship had never been a vicious, thorned thing, twisted into something unrecognizable that managed, still, to cut effortlessly into Draco’s side.
Draco made a vaguely offended noise at the back of his throat, hot pinpricks of
“But you’ll risk it anyways?” Harry asks, with a mixture of disbelief and wry self-awareness. It’s the same thing that led him into the ministry last year, after all. It’s the same thing that lost him Sirius, and it will be his fault this time, too, if Malfoy—
Potter leaned in. "What would have been the right thing?"
Heat ran up to Draco’s ears. “Well, you found me.”
“Mother,” he greeted, a rush of something that felt like both grief and relief flooding him.
“Don’t be barmy,” Ron snaps, with a twitch at Voldemort’s name.
Potter had responded to Draco’s gift with a piece of unevenly ripped parchment and the words
“That has absolutely nothing to do with me,” Draco pointed out, and took a final bite of the sandwich he’d grabbed from the end of one of the tables in the Great Hall. Sunlight still suffused the lawns, the wind bitterer out in the open as they were, so Draco took a few steps to the side, avoiding the wand, and kept walking past Potter to the copse of trees that lined the lake.
“I shouldn’t have,” Draco started, but couldn’t finish the thought, caught instead by the words he could hear behind him:
, because Potter didn’t have enough space in his. Who bought a schoolbag without an expansion charm woven into it?
Draco, undeterred, continued, “There are at least a half-dozen ways to temporarily undo the wards prohibiting non-magical persons from entering Hogwarts.”
There was silence for several long seconds, long enough that Draco turned fully around with the vague concern that Greg had fallen asleep mid-thought.
, except that whatever emotion was on their faces was too much like pity, too much like concern, and Draco was still too fragile from his talk with Madam Pomfrey, from the events of the day before, to feel anything other than threatened by it.
“Yeah, good afternoon,” Potter echoed. Draco was uncommonly aware of the way his Adam's apple bobbed, the feel of his lungs expanding and contracting. Potter cleared his throat; one hand fiddled with the strap of his school bag. “Look, are you—do you have a minute?”
. Or,
Professor Sinistra nodded as he spoke, face impassive. It was an atrocious idea, Draco realized as he spoke; callous, and inflammatory, and there was still too much risk of traumatizing anyone who saw it. Nobody needed to see that. Who did he think he was? Who did he think he was helping? Hadn’t he learned, by now, how prone he was to causing injury?
. As if he’d been dying to tell someone about the vanishing cabinets and Voldemort's threats, about how success and failure alike coil heavily around his neck.
This is, admittedly, the bigger problem.
The room grew quiet; just the low crackle of the fire, and the ever-present press of water outside the windows, dark and green. Draco sat in the closest armchair, pulling his knees to his chest, and thought again of Potter, saying
see the other side of the war. This is why
“I’m leaving you here.” She dropped her hand and took a damning step away from him. Draco heard each precise click of her low heels.
Draco stilled, his hand pressed against the stone archway. He turned, but only partially, a muted fear running through him. “Yes?”
He used to write lengthy letters to his parents, weekly as a first year and more sporadically as the years went on, as he grew to understand that it was a point of humor amongst his friends. Draco had always talked too much, too frequently, anxious to be seen as impressive, and clever, and funny; and the letters were proof of that and more.
Potter stepped forward, nearly onto Draco’s toes. His green eyes had always been brilliant and urgent, and Draco was pinned by them. “You like me
The last sunrays are slipping slowly and surely away, leaving them in incremental shadows when Harry says, “None that anyone else is gonna see.”
But there is a pool, and Harry is drowning, or he is being drowned. It depends on the night. Above the water, people are gathered. They’re close, always close enough that they could reach out a hand and draw him out of the water.
“As always, you may come to me with any concerns,” Professor Sinistra said, mouth frowning again. “I am your Head of House; you should come to me about any issues you may be struggling with.”
The castle could have fallen around them, and Draco would not have noticed. He was hot all over, his body feverish with it. He bent his head towards Potter, touched their foreheads lightly.
His voice cracked mortifyingly. Potter’s surprise was palpable, wiped away a moment later by an unfamiliar, almost pained expression.
“Clearly,” Potter said, with a breathless laugh. They were still pressed together, Potter’s side against Draco’s front, arms a tangle of contradictory limbs. One of Potter’s hands had landed on Draco’s forearm, pushing it away; the other still gripped Draco’s wrist, keeping him in place.
“Tell me,” Malfoy says again, softer.
“Good morning,” Draco said, because it was; the air was crisp with November chill, and the sun warm where it streamed into the Owlery. He spotted his eagle owl, Lyra, settled in one of the high rafters and called her down with a sharp whistle through his teeth.
on one side. Opposite it was a brief inscription describing the second wizarding war and its impact on Hogwarts, but Draco skipped over that, focusing instead on the pale stones inlaid around the base of the memorial with a decorative black marble square between each name. He walked a slow circle, the names of those fallen at the battle the same ones he remembered from the endless cycle of news stories that plagued those weeks right after the Battle, that short window of time before Draco was imprisoned.
It seemed impossible that there were worse things, but then a new memory would surface, or a sound, or a smell. Draco never knew how putrid the smell of decaying bodies was, but Nagini could not eat every corpse and bodies could not be vanished. They had to be moved, and buried or burned, and the stench was seared into Draco’s nostrils. He could not even stand the smell of his own sweat, sometimes; woke earlier than he’d ever done, just to scrub viciously at his body until it felt raw and red, trying to bury his own scent under cloying soaps.
is not the one who will be facing all his nightmares in two weeks. “I don’t feel like I’ve helped you at all.”
And then she was gone, towards her office without another word.
It was the same question he wanted to know from the very beginning, from that first week back to Hogwarts, when he realized he was staring at Potter across the Great Hall, that Potter was staring back with equally discomfiting uncertainty.
“The letter.” Potter finally looked away from Draco to fumble about with his robes, digging into his pockets and unearthing a mortifyingly familiar scrap of parchment.
Malfoy holds out his stupid fucking hand. He looks dazed when Harry slips their fingers together. It’s a very good fit.
?” Hermione asks, her eyes blazing when they meet Harry’s. She is not just asking about Malfoy’s change of heart, if she’s even convinced he’s had one. Hermione always wants more of an answer than Harry knows how to give.
of all people. Potter, who may have killed the Dark Lord, but who walked about with unlaced shoes and crooked ties and who Draco once saw eat a muffin that had been knocked to the floor in the flurry of breakfast. Draco had managed to not get killed by the
Draco swallowed thickly, hotness building at the back of his eyes. “Nox,” he whispered, and the light went out. He blinked a few times, to clear the afterimage, and found Potter staring at him with something like a smile half-hidden by his knee.
“No one cheated,” Baddock said, voice admirably even given the splotchy flush to his face. Zeller stood at his shoulder, eyes bright with anger. “If you would like to contest the results—”
Professor Sprout’s voice was overly cheerful, booming in from very close to Draco’s right side. “Professor Applesnap, what
Draco snapped his head towards the front of the room again, quickly, but heat crawled up the back of his neck. The sight of Potter sent a lurch of pain, acute and troubling, through Draco’s chest, one worse than the sliver of shame he felt when Theo caught his eye again, face pinched.
, he scripted, to himself, watching a clump of aquatic grass float by,
at gobstones.”
Draco’s breath shuddered out of him. “Fine,” he said, though his voice shook. Professor Sprout was showing Professor Applesnap to the door, their voices beginning to rise in an argument Draco didn’t want to hear, didn’t want to be the cause of. What she was saying was so close to what he told himself in the mornings, but it was different hearing it from someone else and not from the dark misery in his head. It was only that he’d forgotten about it during the tournament, listening to Baddock’s preparations and Shardlow’s nerves about her skills, hearing Potter’s laughter in his ears.
in his expression because his mouth tightened.
“Is it different, now?” Harry asks, coaxing Hedwig down from the highest rafters. She lands next to Malfoy, the little traitor.
” Now Creevey’s anger was directed completely at Draco. “Who else is there?
Draco took two stumbling steps forwards, angry at the fact that Potter was angry, ashamed by his own anger, and confused by the force of Potter’s anger. His voice was a muddle, petulant and defensive, when he said, “I was
“Moral support,” Potter answered earnestly. Zeller snorted, then pretended she hadn’t. “You sounded very nervous about your venture into a new sport.”
"We aren’t sure yet how long repairs will take. As such, you will be sharing dorms with the others in your year for the foreseeable future," she said. Harry's gut dropped out from beneath him; he tried, and failed, to not look in Malfoy's direction. Thankfully, Malfoy was too busy looking like he'd been recently poisoned to notice his stare.
“I’m serious. He was Marked this summer,” Harry tries. Pitching his voice a little louder, trying to get the information out, he says, “Voldemort wants him to kill Dumbledore.”
Here is a secret: Harry doesn’t think he’ll live to see the other side of the war. He’s been in mourning since he was fifteen and Dumbledore first asked what Harry planned to do, after hearing about the prophecy. It feels a lot longer ago than it was.
He let the sentence hang, fiddling with his silverware. Draco looked at him and felt his mouth turn up, just slightly. “I’m fine,” he said, and meant it. His breathing felt even and peaceful. “I’ll tell you about it later.”
He looks up, grey eyes searching Harry’s face carefully, cautiously. Waiting, Harry realizes, for him to speak.
The short of it is this: Malfoy does not want to kill Dumbledore and wants to continue under Voldemort’s employ even less. They might even be able to come up with a solution themselves, if they could keep their words civil and their knuckles to themselves.
The potential answer to this question chased itself around Draco’s head, as embarrassing and consuming an obsession as it had been when they were younger.
“I know,” Draco said, turning his head. Potter was bundled in a knobbly scarf that was the same pale blue Draco had previously seen sticking out of Granger’s bag and black knit cap that only just managed to contain his curls. He was heading straight for Draco, eating up the space between them doubtlessly.
Potter’s mouth curled upwards, small, tentative. “Okay,” he said, as if a plan had been made.
Malfoy sucks at a spot on Harry’s hip, and Harry twitches away and says,
He’d storm the Manor. He’d end the war himself. He’d carry the mourning for the rest of his life, in the same place he carries all his dead, and then urge the wind to continue in his stead.
He’d watched too long to be mistaken, too, about the fact that whatever expression had crossed Potter’s face earlier had not been a smile. It wasn’t a smile. But Draco didn’t know Potter well enough to tell what it had been.
It was such a Hermione-like statement that Harry felt an entirely inappropriate laugh rise in his chest. He squashed it down, but Malfoy could clearly see
Greg cleared his throat. Draco deemed it safe enough to look over at him. Greg said, “I didn’t know he was here.”
Portions of the forest still bore damage from the Battle, trees uprooted and the ground gouged so deeply, stone was revealed underneath. Potter stood at a nondescript portion of the treeline, like he was part of the damage, poised on the balls of his feet.
He dressed quickly as Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins—none, it seemed, wanted to be left alone with the Gryffindors—took their turn.
There’s years worth of animosity and weeks of figuring out new ways to throw their bodies at each other that testify to the terrifying undercurrent that has been there since the very beginning, before Harry even knew who Draco Malfoy
Baddock looked up at their approach, said in surprise, “Malfoy.”
“It was quite nice,” Astoria said, with an amused lilt to her voice. “She brought a crate of sweets last time.”
Harry presses the back of one hand under his nose to stem the flowing blood, scowling at the memory. “And, for the record, I
It was impossible to tell if he was surprised to see Draco sat on the ledge, watching him. The sun had begun to fall, so Potter’s face was mostly shadow, and Draco himself was likely an indistinct blur in the failing light. But he raised a hand, as if he, too, knew Draco, intuitively. He didn’t wave, just held it palm out and fingers splayed, and Draco wondered if perhaps Potter had gone mad, the sorry, sad thing, and did the same gesture back.
Panic started in Draco’s throat. “The syllabus has those for the start of next term,” he managed, wondering if what he remembered from restoring the vanishing cabinet last year would be enough to do so competently. He’d only learned enough for isolated magical objects, like the cabinet, and had no idea what Professor Flitwick might ask him to deconstruct with the charms—
Potter knocked their shoulders together, but didn’t acknowledge the statement further. “Hermione hates flying, so she’s not gonna do it. Dennis is an okay flier, but I think it’s too much for one person.”
Creevey’s mouth twisted. “I
,” Harry says, quietly but firmly, because he can see Draco getting ready to argue. “And Andromeda’s not going to hate you just because you look like your father.”
He nodded as if he knew precisely what she was talking about. He’d avoided the glowing notice in the common room for over a week, now. He wanted nothing to do with it. Part of him almost wanted the memory he’d left in the pensieve back.
This is a very Hermione question, softened only slightly when Harry reminds her of Dumbledore’s frequent disappearances, citing his last lesson as further reminder that Dumbledore is not in the mind for listening. Her mouth twists in disapproval, and twists further at Malfoy’s small scoff; Hermione doesn’t understand Harry’s continual distrust in adults, even with their shared history between them.
Harry focuses on wrapping himself in the cloak—Malfoy’s, an old one that is as heavy as Malfoy’s body against his—and putting his glasses back in place so as not to be the one to start this conversation.
“I know,” Potter said, sounding aggravated. He toed at the ground with his trainer while Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “It’s just—I mean, why come back, if you’re not even going to come to class or, or eat in the Great Hall—”
“I want to do more,” Harry mutters, thinking about the memories already stored in the pensieve and the letter he received from Andromeda, confirming their meeting.
The window for moving away felt as if it had already passed; and now Draco was frozen in the shape of a fight with Potter, but there were none of the edges that went with a fight. Potter had been laughing.
They both startled at their voices, the sounds of their footsteps approaching; the moment scattered like leaves to the wind. Draco ducked his head, abruptly anxious at the idea of being outnumbered, and mumbled indistinctly that he had better go. He turned away as he spoke, but not before he saw Potter’s mouth twist, saw the way Potter’s hand flexed; as if he meant to stop Draco from leaving by a word or a touch. It was absurd, of course. Draco recognized that once he was safely absconded in his bed, the curtains drawn so that he could pretend the reason none of his dormmates spoke to him was because he chose to have it that way. It was absurd.
shouldn’t have brought it up.”
He cut himself off again. Draco stared curiously. “Always what?”
His breathing felt like the loudest thing in the room, yet he couldn’t seem to get in enough air. The irregular hitch of his chest was painful and constricting. “I used to—I sometimes go to the Owlery, or anywhere—high,” he explained, helplessly. “I don’t know what else to do.”
“I’m not sure,” Draco repeated, trying to speak clearly through the thick mess of his head, “that I—can.”
“Who’s joking?” Malfoy sounds neutral, somehow all put together again in the time it’s taken for Harry to fall apart.
stared back, the name carved neatly in stone.
For that one, shining moment, at least, Harry might have been in love, until everything that came to pass, came to pass.
“No.” Draco swallowed, throat clicking audibly. His heart was so loud he couldn’t hear anything but the rush of it in his ears. "But I've always been very foolish, when it comes to you.”
“I was,” Malfoy confirms, unconcerned, “And I've gotten the pensieve to work.”
It didn’t mean anything, Harry told himself, even as they walked too close and stared too long at each other.
you will.” The sarcasm is thick enough for Harry to taste, when Malfoy turns on him. Malfoy and his fists, which are not furious, but maybe want to be; Malfoy and his face, which is fragile the way Malfoy never admits to being. “What could I
quit,” she said. Draco turned to look at her, surprised and maybe a tiny bit afraid. He didn’t know Hufflepuffs were capable of sounding so stern. “Or did you forget that we can’t compete without you? There’s still the spring tournaments next term!”
But there was also exploring the neighborhood his mother’s flat was located in, which was crowded and dirty and so incalculably far from the reserve of the Manor or the expanse of Hogwarts that Draco feared he may never grow used to it. His mother walked through it without an ounce of concern, however. She’d confessed that the Black’s ancestral home, whose name she could not remember, and which Draco had the faintest feeling he must have visited before, had been located in a similar neighborhood. She did not say that it was comforting, or that she enjoyed it, but Draco had walked into the open sitting area to find a dressing gown thrown over the back of the slender armchair and knew that she did.
And then the Slytherin third and fourth years had filed silently in through the portrait hole, escorted by a fifth-year prefect who had the grim look of a general at war on her face. Harry stared hard at the group of third-years, finding it unnerving to see them in the cozy red and gold of the common room. The common room, already small given the constraints of the tower, was crowded by their entry.
The other half of the room watched Draco, too, wary and distrustful for the same reason the others were betrayed and expectant. The castle held its inhabitants in a stasis charm, and so all Draco saw when he looked into the common room was the war, still waging, endless and unquenchable.
"Maybe we should all ask at the same time," Lovegood said, wandering over. Done with her part of the repairs, she looped her hair into a large bun and stuck her wand through it as she spoke. "On the count of three?"
He said his brother’s name hard, like he knew that if he didn’t spit it out, it wouldn’t come out at all. He kept clenching and unclenching his fist, eyes on the memorial behind Draco’s right shoulder.
“The—?” Draco made a choked noise, almost a laugh. He whirled around. “I’m sorry, the
, Harry thinks, as the silence stretches on and on and on.
Only when Malfoy starts speaking, it’s not at all the conversation Harry was expecting.
As the conversation began to flow, Potter turned to Draco and asked, in an undertone, “Are you okay? I saw you yesterday, but…”
, but Harry
Draco hummed, noncommittal. It had been harder to tell when he was in the middle of the room, but here, leaning against Hogwarts' old stones, Draco could feel magic pulsing earnestly around them. Finding the right words would help—the right words always helped—but Hogwarts was already responding to their wishes.
, an ever-present undercurrent to his voice. It’s the betrayal that takes the forefront, raw and unhappy. The mystery of what Malfoy is up to is abruptly very real, and very ugly; nothing at all like when they were younger and the mystery ended with deducted house points and detention.
Draco slowed as he recognized where he would be passing through if he continued walking straight on. The south cloister that held the memorial. There were usually a few people there, sitting on those stone benches or pacing the memorial stone, and he didn’t want to see anyone.
, he kept saying, a useless, broken refrain; because he was, even if it was too late, and because Madam Pomfrey was listening so carefully, even though she didn’t have to. And Madam Pomfrey led him to one of the curtained beds and asked him gently prodding questions—about his morning ablutions, and the ceaseless loop of his negative thoughts—and without Draco’s noticing, time had slipped from the late afternoon into the pale purple beginnings of early evening.
“Well,” Draco started, pulling away; but Astoria snagged his arm, said, “Oh, don’t be ridiculous. The crowd will be worse when you’re alone. Come along.”
“What for?” Zeller frowned in a way that made her look even more severe, though Draco suspected this was actually her version of concern.
to be good at that, but this,
“Because I,” Malfoy repeats, voice like thin ice cracking on impact, gaze unwavering, “didn’t know
It’s all very circumspect, because she doesn’t ask what she wants to know outright. She writes, for example,
It was also patently impossible. Zeller had been in attendance last year, and Baddock had seen Draco’s memory. There was also the fact that Draco’s face had been plastered all over the Prophet and his name mentioned repeatedly on the WWN news hour when they were running daily updates on the trials.
“Okay,” Greg answered, drawing the word out so it had several suspicious syllables.
“Erm,” Harry says, as the weight of both Malfoy and Hermione’s gaze settle at the side of his head.
“They hardly have to
; it was only that he and Lavender were dating, after all, and who else was he supposed to talk about these things with, Hermione?
His gaze drops, very casually, to the map laid out in Harry’s lap. By the time Harry has thought to lift it up, Ron is already turning to his own bed, asking, “What are you doing?” in a wary tone.
It rains halfway through quidditch practice that evening, which is just—just fucking perfect, really. He ends practice a half-hour early, then goes to stand under the shower in the locker room until the water runs cold; the mud melts off of him and tears sting at the backs of his eyes and he, stupidly, wants to press his nose into the clean skin of Malfoy’s neck and
to a litany of headline-grabbing epithets.
“I’m fine,” he told his reflection, which wavered, distorted. But he drank it anyway.
that followed after him like every nightmare he’d never be able to escape. He took a turn blindly, narrowly avoiding a fall down a flight of stairs he couldn’t remember ever being there, and then down a corridor that grew more and more familiar until he came to a panting stop right in front of the Hospital Wing.
, so what if you
"It's magic," he said, with some irritation. "You just have to mean it."
, on the marble floor of the foyer.
He wasn’t smiling, exactly, but the expression on his face was nearly friendly when Draco took a few steps into the room and said, “I apologize for being late.”
Mostly, he thought about kissing Malfoy. He thought about it quite a lot.
“What,” Draco said, again, but more forcefully; delight and horror mingled as the whole of Hogwarts spread across the parchment, moving dots and little scrolls unfurling gracefully. His eyes zeroed in on two dots,
Malfoy doesn’t have a
“Right,” Draco said, and immediately discarded the idea of just flat-out telling Greg what would be found there. Instead he said, “I think you should come with me to see it.”
“Baddock?” Astoria repeated, a little too quickly. She shook her head again, disrupting the neat waves in her hair, and tucked an arm through Draco’s the way Daphne and Pansy used to do. “I can’t go with Baddock.”
, but by that point he’d have forgotten the specifics, only aware of the thick, cloying shame coalesced into a ball high in his throat that refused to be swallowed. And that was only the mornings.
“To be clear, it was irresponsible of you to do,” she continued, and Draco nodded like a marionette—yes, yes, he knew, of course. Her face softened slightly as she spoke. “But the impulse is not wholly incorrect. The experience of sharing and contextualizing trauma is one that can foster understanding and empathy to parties beyond the perpetrator and victim.”
Immediately on the heels of that irritation, though, was a deep sense of exhaustion. It had not been long enough for Draco to forget that Potter tended to believe that he was up to something nefarious. It had not been long enough for Draco to forget that he
He spun right into Astoria.
“Yes?” Draco asked, ignoring her entirely.
,” Greg said, and suddenly he was standing, looking furious. “You never do stuff just because someone else asks unless it’s your bloody
Harry drops his hand and tangles his fingers in the hem of his jumper.
It turned out that the Hospital Wing housed a lovely brewing room, small but neat; all smooth stone and adjustable Lumos charms over the two brew stations. It felt like cheating to spend a double period hidden there, doing something as simple as brew a third-year potion to ensure that Madam Pomfrey’s Pepper-Up stock was ready for the influx of colds that pervaded at the beginning of every year.
Harry’s hands curl into fists above his head, where Malfoy’s thin hands are a vice around his wrists. Malfoy sounds like a trapped animal. He repeats it, eyes burning a defiant, inescapable silver. “
“I am perfectly acceptable at playing gobstones,” Draco said stiffly, flicking the last bits of liquid from his hair and into Potter’s face.
about meeting here?” Malfoy’s voice is very close and distinctly appalled. He’s invisible under Harry’s cloak, and Harry barely jumps when he feels the weight of Malfoy’s body press alongside Harry’s arm.
Malfoy snorted explosively. "Let the saviour sleep on the floor? I think the rest of the school would flay me if they found out."
“They hexed you?” Queensbury demanded. He’d come to breakfast about halfway through Draco’s retelling, his halo of curls coiffed meticulously.
Draco found himself crouched on the ground, his head hanging between his knees and his hands splayed protective along the back of his neck. It took him several, uneven breaths to realize the Headmistress was kneeling in front of him, that she was speaking to him, and several longer minutes before he could breathe properly.
In one of Draco’s gloved hands, Potter had placed a wrapped box.
Draco nodded obediently, taking the sour-smelling Reveal-All potion the second officer came back with, and then froze at the words
Malfoy’s fears are shaped like this: a childhood home with blood on the walls that you put there yourself. It’s the bent necks of your parents over a dining room table, and the sound of a snake that could eat you whole circling like a noose. It's a scar you will never be able to remove, no matter how many lines you run through it. It’s the twist of the words
A chilly sort of silence took over. Professor McGonagall pretended not to notice.
Draco held his next inhale until it burned, then let it out slowly. He said, with more control than he ever thought himself capable of, “That’s not true anymore.”
Draco, feeling unaccountably guilty, gathered his things for lack of anything else to do. When Potter continued to not say anything, to sit in perfect and unwavering stillness, Draco said, “You could still go. A glamour would work.”
“I was going to break into the quidditch shed,” Draco said absently. He was trying to decide if he liked how close the forest was. He was thinking he did not.
The Battle rose again as students shifted, drawing tighter around each other in the foreign land of the once familiar common room. A half-dozen arguments sounded in the echoing dungeon, wands in hand over everything from Slytherins sitting at the Hufflepuff table to the trials still being reported in the
So even though he was expecting it, Draco still felt a stab of chagrin when Potter, jaw tight, said, “I waited.”
is the part they’re both after, really.
And Draco knew; of course he knew. He still woke with smoke in his lungs and fire at his back and the dark, sweaty shape of Potter under his hands, against his chest. He still heard Vince. He always heard Vince.
Harry’s lips still feel warm from Malfoy’s kiss, and this makes him suddenly, inexplicably terrified. It’s a mundane terror; far less deadly than the other horrors that Harry has known, will know. There’s no prophecy to determine the aftermath of what Harry feels right now, with his heart a startled deer in his chest.
This was the reason he tried to be out of sight. It wasn’t their fault that no one could—could heal, or move on, when Draco and his Marked arm and probationary sentence sat right there, hindering it all.
She hadn’t known, but it was very nearly the kindest thing anyone said to him that whole year.
It was a mix of fear and shame, a certainty that he wouldn’t be welcome and that it would be wrong for him to enter the space anyways. It was, as always, the cowardice that led to deflection, to avoidance. Draco stared intently at the frame of an empty portrait, hands sweaty and lungs tightening.
Malfoy took exactly three seconds to think about this before getting under the cloak with Harry. Upon reflection, this was a truly terrible idea—Malfoy was taller than Harry, and the cloak only just covered the both of them if they crouched. But most terribly, they had to stay very, very close together to do so. Harry had no idea why he hadn't just donned the cloak and run away instead of offering Malfoy a spot underneath it.
He had been more than a little surprised to find that Malfoy really
. Potter grimaced like even he could tell how unconvincing he sounded, immediately crossing his arms across his chest. Draco had never seen Potter this flustered, and was cheered immensely by the sight. Unable to help it, Draco tipped his head back and
And it means so very much, and absolutely nothing at all.
It felt rather as if Draco had been thrown out of Azkaban and directly into Hogwarts. If he thought about it—which he didn’t, on principle—then Draco could acknowledge that a brief period had existed in between. There had been a meeting, in which his parole office said,
“I don’t…” Draco bit the inside of his lip and saw Potter’s eyes follow the movement. “It’s only,” he started, stopping again.
Harry takes a few seconds to breathe, feeling the buzz of his magic rattle the desks in their co-opted classroom. Malfoy interspersed a highly unimpressed lecture on Harry's lack of control over his magic in-between insults and non-answers, and Harry’s pretty sure one of them will end up with another broken nose if
locating the dark magic at the same time, though Potter was an annoyingly quick study behind her, slowed by his insistence on helping the students who were struggling with the charms.
“I don’t even like gobstones,” Draco said, without meaning to. He was staring at the collar of Potter’s jumper unseeingly.
“Good morning,” he said, trying very hard not to seem overwhelmed and guilty for all manner of minor things, like sneaking around after curfew to ill-advisedly repair the castle and for falling asleep on Potter’s shoulder the other evening. Aside from his regular owls with Madam Pomfrey’s magical signature signing off his service hours, Draco had not heard from his parole officer since last term.
And then he spotted the dot, coming back to the grounds:
. Draco paused in his instruction—for a third time—when Lovegood wandered into the corridor, leading another pair of students that Draco recognized vaguely from the meeting. Taking brisk stock of the situation, Lovegood rounded up those who weren’t getting the hang of either spell and instructed them on simple charms to help with the repairs—cleaning charms and reinforcing spells for the crumbling wall and spiral staircase.
McGonagall sighs, as if his lack of immediate reply means that she’s right. Harry’s shoulders tighten at the sound.
Potter turned his head away and pressed his forehead to the windowpane. He closed his eyes, mouth scrunched in a frown. “What do you need,” he began, every word careful, “to be sure?”
He didn’t mean to stutter, was not particularly prone to it, but shame tripped up the flow of his sentence. The details of Draco’s sentencing had been widely published, in print and over the Wizarding Wireless Network, but Draco hadn’t had reason to discuss them with anyone other than his mother since Officer Abbott-Jones’ visit at the beginning of the month. His face flared with a frustrated pink.
Draco looked to Baddock, who would be no help, as he was falling asleep into his tea. So Draco faced Zeller and said, “Sorry?”
Potter was right where the map said he would be, in one of the alcoves near Gryffindor Tower with a wide window facing the quidditch pitch. It was bright, sunlight pooling in the window seat that Potter was tucked into, his bag on the floor next to him.
“Malfoy,” said Baddock, with great reluctance.
Except that the number of beds stayed precisely the same. The third-year boys stood in silence for several long seconds. Harry had never before appreciated how tiny their dormitory was until this moment.
Zeller’s pale cheeks were a bright, incensed red. She stepped forward, then again, her whole body puffing up with fury. “How
. But I’ve asked everyone, and the best that I can think is some—some charm or something to counter the wards individually.”
Queensbury froze in a half-crouch next to Draco, looking perfectly hunted. He sat, very slowly, and met Draco’s gaze with that same look. “Well,” he said, after adjusting his cuffs in a distinctly fidgety manner. “You know how Professor Sinistra has been having those, uh, talking circles?”
“I’ve not done anything,” Draco muttered, abashed, but Astoria either didn’t hear him or ignored him. She led them purposefully towards the end of the table, where a group of fifth and sixth years were sitting.
She is Malfoy’s idea, stumbled onto when Harry wondered aloud what it had been like for Sirius to leave his home while the first war was on. He never asked for the details. Every day, it feels like Harry finds a new question he should have asked.
Leaving out most of the incriminating details, Harry explained about the lights from the other night, surrounding the castle. He didn’t explain how he knew they were wishes, or what he felt when he touched them.
you.”
He got ready for bed automatically, pausing to look at himself in the mirror, which he normally avoided. His hair was due for a cut, he thought critically, pushing the fringe away from his forehead; his face hadn’t yet moved past the pinched, thin look it had taken on in sixth year, though his scars—cutting up across his jaw, into the edge of his lips—were thinner and whiter than they used to be. No different, basically, from the sight that greeted him briefly in the mornings, when he forgot to look away, but Draco nevertheless felt as if there was something on his face that had to be broadcasting the incomprehensible feeling twisting up in his gut.
Draco looked at Potter. He said, “Yes,” and wasn’t sure if it was a lie.
Draco sat up, blinking hard through the sleep in his eyes. “What’s wrong?” he asked, because something had to be, for his mother to look so rattled.
Malfoy turned his head towards Harry, which was awful because it was made all the more apparent just how close they were. To Harry's mounting horror, he was close enough to see faint freckles across Malfoy's cheeks and nose, even without his glasses. Freckles! Freckles which, until this moment, he had happily associated with the Weasleys and would now forevermore associate with Malfoy as well.
Harry sucks in a startled breath that gets caught in all the soft places in his throat and belly. It makes his voice naked. “Don’t joke.”
Malfoy’s eyes snap up at that, and Harry has the sudden, startling realization that Malfoy thought he was doing this with other people.
“Nightmare?” Malfoy asks, lowering his arm. His voice is quieter; he sounds sleepless now that he's not being difficult, like he’s maybe been abusing the prefect privileges he still has to wander about the castle unbothered.
There’s no use in arguing with the past. That doesn’t mean Harry isn’t still furious with it.
there, Mr. Malfoy.”
Headmistress McGonagall sighed now, heavy and tired. Draco was halfway through his second cup of tea, which meant it was almost time to nod and say, lukewarm,
Harry’s attempt to talk with Dumbledore about Malfoy is a failure because the truth of it gets all tangled up in his throat. He just—gets a little worked up, wherever Malfoy is concerned, and Dumbledore’s inscrutable expression doesn’t help his nerves or his rising frustration. Dumbledore stares placidly, insists that Malfoy isn’t Harry’s concern and shuts the conversation down there. Harry, Dumbledore says, has other concerns to focus on.
“I don’t know.” Draco curled his hands around his nape, catching the loose hair there. Vivian used to babysit, when they were left in the Crabbe estate alone; she’d been quiet, and overweight, and was the reason Draco had taken to having his tea sweetened so heavily. She always made it too bitter, and laughed at the expression on their faces as they scrambled to dump sugar and milk in it. He hadn’t thought of her in ages. She graduated when they were in their second year, off to an apprenticeship in France and then never returned. She sent Vince a card every year for his birthday and Yule, even during seventh year.
, so who was to say that the other things he made up in his head couldn’t be real? Parents who had been kind and loving, and friends who would stand by him, and someone, somewhere, who would say his name like they
“But it still worked for you,” Draco said after a moment. It was quiet, now that he’d stopped talking; everyone with sense was at dinner, so there was only the sound of the lake lapping against the shore and the wind rustling the leaves overhead, gently. It was soothing enough for Draco to think this was merely a peculiar dream, borne of sleeplessness.
“Aside from the fact that my best friends probably think I’m mental?” Harry’s voice is muffled by the pillow, but Malfoy’s impatient, “Yes, obviously,” tells Harry that he was still understood, if not sympathized with.
The box was thin and black, stamped with a glittering diamond pattern. Inside, nestled against black velvet was a cloak pin, silver and intricate, and a folded bit of parchment in Potter’s hand that read
The Hogwarts Express pulled into the station, drowning out the rest of the conversation on the platform. Half hoping he wouldn’t be heard over its roar, feeling shamed, Draco said, “I didn’t get you anything.”
“He’s good at gobstones,” Baddock replied immediately.
Potter lifted his head, leaving a smudge on the glass. He pinned Draco with that intent gaze but didn’t say anything. At a loss, Draco asked, feeling obvious and pathetic, “Are
Draco, lungs tight with trepidation, gave a single, lurching nod. Madam Pomfrey beckoned him forward, then directed him to begin labelling the vials in the cart.
“I’m fine,” he said, even though she hadn’t asked anything.
“No, Malfoy,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, after a long pause. “Your story was verified by both Mr. Potter and the Headmistress. You should have told us, of course, but as you didn’t acquire the wand by force, it’s hardly something to send you back to Azkaban for. Though,” she added, her voice lighter, friendlier, “the next time your boyfriend wants to do something nice for you, tell him to stick to chocolates.”
Matter ostensibly settled, they shuffled off in the direction of the stands, Baddock breaking off to begin cleaning the chalk from the floor with quick, wandless cleaning spells. Draco turned back to Potter, who remained exactly where he’d been this whole time, too close and quiet.
Harry has never seen Malfoy cry. This is the expression that makes him think he might.
Hogwarts’ magic began to nudge at them, gentle turns of the stones underfoot or materializing new sconces or windows to draw their attention towards specific areas. The moon lit the stones pale and blue, and when Draco paused just under the staircase, exhaustion beginning to creep up on him, he saw that the broken wall was beginning to reassemble itself.
? Is that how you spent your evenings in sixth year?”
“Really?” Harry asks, ignoring the significant look Ron is trying to give him. In his pocket, a golden galleon burns against his thigh. “I’m sure that will be interesting.”
, murdered in cold blood like the prisoners in the Manor, and the family in the fields, and Professor Burbage, who Draco still heard in his nightmares. Baddock might have ended up in the cellars with Lovegood and Thomas, and Draco would have watched and done nothing.
Oh, but he had no idea. Draco shrugged, wondering if perhaps courage would spontaneously appear if he held still for long enough.
“—were they supposed to know it
, one Auror said as they poured through the unprotected gates, while Draco gasped at the catch of a hex at his side, burning, burning.
It's the simplest, most convoluted answer in the world.
This conclusion does not leave him angry. It doesn’t fill him with the blind fury that consumed him the day he tore through Dumbledore’s office, that horrible, horrible morning where Harry knew he was facing a world that no longer held Sirius. It’s not the sort of thing that makes Hermione flinch back from him, or Ron yell at him, or the furniture shake, and those are the only other things that Harry uses to determine whether or not he’s angry.
Draco was not versed in apology. But he found himself scripting one in his head anyways. Incomprehensible ones, incomplete and running into each other—for this afternoon with Potter, and for the gobstones tournament; for the broken nose; for the torture in the Manor. For the young girl whose name he will never know, whose blood is blackened against the Manor walls. For Granger, and for Weasley; for the Ravenclaw Astoria had snuck away from the Carrows; for Vince; for Greg; for the years before the war, and for every inaction during it.
agreed with me on that.”
home, once—is a place of sunrises, bouquets on the kitchen table and cat hair on plush couch cushions. Laughter that no one tells him to shush and plates he doesn’t have to steal from. The whole house is tender like sheets on a line, scented with sun and grass. Dream knowledge. They weren’t always together, but they ended up that way. Learned knowledge. They have known each other since the beginning. Learned knowledge.
He was shaking by the time the floo spat him out into the Headmistress’ office. He couldn’t tell whether it was from rising anger or residual fear, but it made his heart race in his chest, left his mouth dry and sour.
“You’re not even going to read all of these,” Draco scoffed, but he put his quill down.
Draco sneered and tried valiantly not to. He knew perfectly well that if Potter wanted to find him, all he had to do was open up that sodding map of his.
“Why are you here, exactly?” Draco demanded, while Shardlow let out a nervous giggle.
“Well,” Zeller said with a huff, her short, black hair held back from her face with a series of buttercup yellow clips. She had a piece of parchment, charmed to reflect the Hogwarts team’s collective score, floating in front of her and a severe frown on her face. “So long as Malcolm and Bastien win their next rounds, we should still be able to enter the national tournament.”
He was obscurely grateful that he’d already done this part of the syllabus because his concentration was shattered. He picked up his quill and wrote absolutely nothing down as he watched Professor Flitwick begin his lecture. His heart was doing something fast and unforgivable in his chest.
Baddock hesitated only for a moment before speaking. “That we’re all students again. Even them.”
Besides, Harry kind of
Draco would plant his hands on either side of that open window and lean forward, thinking, thinking, thinking. How funny, the way his stomach shrunk that year. How funny, how his grades had dropped, his prefect status stripped. How funny, that Potter spent the year stalking him and then vanished the moment he left Draco split open in six places, bleeding on cold bathroom tiles.
“Right,” Draco said. The panic deflated, replaced by something heavier. Not quite relief, not quite disappointment, but easier to breathe through.
“Of course,” said Baddock in polite disbelief. “So, what do you think?”
Much, much later, Draco contemplated breaking into the quidditch shed. He did not particularly feel like flying, but he did like the idea of sitting high in the thin air in the crisp blackness of night. He liked the idea of all that space, and of the long way down, and of the quiet pitch.
“Looks like it worked okay,” Potter said, quieter than he’d been this whole time.
This was why Draco said, his voice sounding entirely too loud, “Alright, Potter?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “No,” he bit out, not liking the question or the way Potter looked so tense asking it. It felt too close to the very conversations Draco avoided having—about the war and what it did to them, or how Draco could sometimes still find himself longing for the open air from a high place, how Potter could be caught with his eyes glued to the imposing line of the forbidden forest. They didn’t talk about those first meetings, Draco sat on the ledge of the Owlery and Potter with the forest rising over the edge of the pitch, but the shape of those interactions felt suddenly present. It left Draco feeling cornered, like Potter was about to expose a secret Draco hadn’t intended to give him. “Would it matter if I had?”
The conversation with Astoria felt like ages ago; Draco could hardly recall anything past yesterday to begin with. Stalling, Draco said, “You really held it in the Slytherin common room?”
He’d been running and re-running his recent conversations with Potter in his head and had exclaimed a rather heartfelt
It was like every time they’d ever reached for the snitch at the same time: fingers scrabbling over the back of a hand, shoulders knocking with brief, shocking impact, thighs a heavy line of solid pressure. Potter fastened his warm hand over Draco’s closed fist, tugging it below the tabletop when Flitwick looked up at the clamor. Draco let out a noisy breath through his nose, annoyed and exhilarated.
Slowly, she put down her quill. She said, “I think you need to talk to Dennis.”
Draco made a vague noise of assent, already aware that it would have to be submitted well before
Harry’s gut twists at the callous admission, sick and tired and
Potter sat up straighter, his expression flickering. “You’re—are you leaving?”
Draco lifted his head and saw that it was not an inane comment after all. Potter
Malfoy does not do that. Malfoy is lit wick reflected back at him, a tangled, unyielding mess that Harry can’t look directly at, nevermind for long enough to puzzle out where it's headed. It’s something wild and greedy, and it punches through the ice with nary a concern for the cracks in its wake.
“Bribery,” Draco said, knowingly.
“You know it’s not the same,” Draco continued, realizing that what he felt was fury, fierce and unexpected. And he wasn’t even sure

Malfoy pins Harry beneath him, chest heaving. He snarls, “Give me another option, then.”
that Harry doesn’t know how to interpret. Is it a good thing, because Malfoy hasn’t been bullying anyone in the corridors between classes? Or is it a bad thing, because he hasn’t been interacting with anyone, really, keeping himself isolated from the rest of his house and the school? Malfoy’s time is increasingly pulled to the Room of Hidden Things, where two-thirds of their not-Dumbledore plan wait for his repair.
could see where her hurt was stemming from, that was right out for sure.
until he was
The opportunity to speak with Professor McGonagall about Malfoy presents itself accidentally, after class when Harry is running late and overhearing her concerns that Malfoy hasn’t turned in some assignments.
“I see,” said Madam Pomfrey. It was early enough that most of the castle was asleep, breakfast still an hour away, but of course Madam Pomfrey was already up and bustling about. She had a cart full of potions and a businesslike gaze that flicked over Draco’s form, upright and still near the door. “How is your brewing?”
Without looking away from the group gathered in the center of the tower, Potter said, "It's already working, isn't it?"
“I,” Malfoy says, with biting mildness, “didn’t know anything.”
Draco blinked at his belongings. He had no idea when she’d put them down, or when the interview ended. His hawthorn wand was there, innocuous.
Hearing no protests, he wrote everyone's name in the air. It reminded Harry, briefly, of when Tom Riddle had done the same in the Chamber of Secrets last year, except that Zabini's letters glowed a faint silver and seemed marginally less likely to reveal the name
With that, she clapped a forceful hand against his upper arm, ignoring Draco’s splutter of faint offense.
It was one of Draco’s affirmations, reserved for the very bad days where his brain was so clouded and overfull that even getting up required too many steps. When he would clutch his pillow to his chest and methodically review his worst traits and actions until his brain was well-settled and clear again on the sources of his deserved distress:
Draco nodded; he’d been doing a lot of that. Of course, the last time he was struggling with a problem, he’d not been able to trust his Head of House—or he’d had no reason to believe he could. The information, learned in the aftermath, that Professor Snape had been a spy for Dumbledore still rang hollowly between Draco’s ribs.
She pulled back a bit, waving a ghostly hand. “You’ve been talking to her, haven’t you?”
Astoria, who had a truly terrifyingly large tome entitled
“See that you do,” Headmistress McGonagall answered, brisk. “He has class before lunch.”
, and continued, even more offended, "It's nearly one in the morning and they
“Astoria already left,” Zeller added, who was not even supposed to be in this common room.
That lump in his throat returned as he watched her put up the outerwear with a flick of her wand. A row of scarves hung carelessly on the hooks beside the doorway, which was not a sentence that would have existed when they lived in the Manor.
“Malfoy,” Potter said now, voice trembling with suppressed emotion. Draco didn’t look up to determine which one; he already knew what Potter sounded like when he was readying for a fight. “What are you talking about?”
“You don’t have to agree with me,” Creevey said, before Draco could formulate a response. “But I think once you start to realize how fucked it is that my brother died for a world that wouldn’t even let our fucking dad step into St. Mungo’s without Ministry clearance, then you’ll see why

“It’s
Harry to look away from him. “And this will be the only—
A cheer went up from all four tables, and Harry tried to smile alongside the rest of the Gryffindors. They’d have their common room and dormitories back, and wasn’t that just a relief?
Later, Harry will say, “You could always try to speak with Dumbledore yourself,” without an ounce of conviction, and Malfoy’s pretty mouth will scrunch with distaste. “Even you don’t believe that.”
But Potter just shrugged. “They don’t tell you what happens after.” He looked a bit like he had that night on the pitch; a little angry, a little uncertain. It made Draco want to reach for him again, but there was no excuse for that this time; just this gnawing need to soothe, though Draco wasn’t sure which of them was in need of it.
“The stuff you said about—you know, about thinking about what I like, or don’t, or am interested in.” Potter’s voice dropped a bit at the end, worrying one worn page between his fingers.
Draco goggled at him. “It is well into the evening,” he said, which was a polite way of pointing out that it was nearly midnight, and any possible classes to skip were well and truly over.
“We started over, right?” Without waiting for Draco’s answer, Potter continued, “So we’re still friends.”
There’s a tin of bruise paste courtesy of Hermione in Harry’s bag, nicked after his first fight with Malfoy. He retrieves it now, to use on the bruised skin around those dove-grey eyes.
Harry opened his eyes sleepily, just in time to see Malfoy's eyes close. "Night," he answered. He waited until Malfoy's breathing evened out before adding, in a whisper, "Draco."
It had been a while since Draco had experienced the rapt attention of such a large group in the Great Hall. He’d missed it, he realized, but not as what it was when he’d been younger. Then, people had hung onto his tales of cruelty and taunting, and he’d not been able to speak without that knee-jerk need to ensure that everyone
a hovering guillotine above their necks. Few things, Draco reflected, killed a conversation as quickly as the intimate knowledge of the extent to which classmates were willing to inflict hatred on each other.
Harry swallowed uncomfortably. This was going to be a long night.
Harry lingers in the empty corridor after stepping off the moving staircase, his gut churning. The idea of telling Malfoy that he failed to convince Dumbledore leaves him cold to his fingertips. But he promised to talk to Malfoy after the meeting. So instead of turning in the direction of Gryffindor Tower, Harry heads to their unofficial classroom in a disused area of the dungeon.
“Nor have I,” said Draco, and took a step back. He no longer felt like flying, if he ever had in the first place.
“Well.” Astoria smiled, silver and quick. “Potter vouched for you, of course.”
He said it in a way that suggested he did know, but before Harry could interrogate him about it, Malfoy said the password and stepped into the common room. Harry, miffed, followed after him.
Here, an arched doorway that managed, improbably, to take one straight to the top floor of the tower, bypassing the spiral staircase entirely. There, a wide, circular room with multi-colored windows that glittered red and green and yellow and blue along the pale floor. Even the spiral staircase, once narrow and claustrophobic, was regrown in an unfamiliar shape: windows with benches set into the frames, steps alternating between dark greys and layered pinks, wall sconces that held a low light that brightened with the sounds of their voices, of their wonder.
Nervously, Draco perched on one of the seats opposite her desk. The teapot filled a cup, which then nudged at his hand until he picked it up and spooned sugar into it.
Draco took it with muted thanks, and waved off her perfunctory reminder about curfew.
. A blind fury rose at the sound. “
He didn’t fill the gaps, but Draco knew what Baddock meant. Even aside from their school rivalry, there was little conceivable reason for Draco and Potter to interact given their respective statuses during and after the war.
It brought him abruptly back to that first morning after the battle, the grip of her hands in his. The way Narcissa and Lucius had pushed through the dueling bodies to reach Draco, triumphant in that if nothing else. The lie that led to it.
“There still are,” said Draco, looking up in offense. He put them up again every time he left. He wasn’t an
Pansy had wailed about that, her voice shrill and comforting by his bedside.
that easy?” he asked, wry, before catching Draco by the elbow and steering him towards the rest of the gobstones team.
“That is a very serious accusation.” Her eyes are very stern, the set of her mouth telling Harry that she’s disappointed in him. Harry falters mid-word. He’s reminded, all over again, that adults don’t listen to him. They always think he’s lying.
Draco shifted his bag to the other shoulder as he read the petition, which advocated for families to be able to visit students at Hogwarts once a month. There were a whole host of stated benefits of such an act, neatly bulleted, which included mundane things like
This resulted in a rather heated exchange. Not about Draco being a Death Eater, because that was common knowledge and not something up to debate, but about the relative righteousness of an auror hexing him at all. Voices were crescendoing around Draco, who found himself both bewildered and intrigued.
A cold, clear anger flooded Draco. He found himself striding across the hall, moving so quickly that he was caught up with Potter after only a few seconds. From the doorway, Professor Sprout had finally noticed the confrontation, and was heading towards them with a grim expression.
even in a Weasley sweater paired with sleep pants. Malfoy looked nice in his uniform, even, which was another patently unfair thing. Surely no one was meant to look
planned to have. He thought this was it: offering up information, for other people to handle.
The nearby students had gone quiet; it was a quiet that crawled over Draco’s skin, the kind that was contagious. The whole table was silenced in seconds, air dark and tense.
All said, Draco was at his wits end by the time Zeller came through with a gaggle of other yellow-clad fourth years and one very sheepish looking Shardlow.
Potter’s mouth quirked upwards, the tension falling off his shoulders. He kicked Draco back, left his foot knocked against Draco’s when he said, “Help me carry these to Madam Pince’s desk?”
Malfoy had always been something rare to him. Like a glittering jewel, sharp angles and vivid in the light. Harry reaches up, to brush knuckles across cheekbones, and is surprised that this touch no longer splits skin.
“He’s a student at Hogwarts,” Officer Abbott-Jones said mildly, while Draco struggled with the acute, cloying sense of helplessness that he hadn’t felt since the Dark Lord lived a bedroom over from him. “We could pop over to verify the story, so long as the Headmistress is agreeable.”
had resumed walking, heads bent close.
“She’ll love you,” Harry says fiercely. “She’ll get to know you and won’t even be able to help loving you.”
Malfoy seemed to have an equal amount of regret over this, though his seemed to be rooted in the ease with which he allowed Harry to pull him into rule-breaking. As soon as they’d made it out of the common room, he began an anxious strain of whisperings. This was another terrible thing, as his breath was very hot on Harry’s ear.
"Vaguely," Potter said seriously. His thumb pressed along the jutting bone at Draco's wrist, smoothed up, smoothed down. It was terribly distracting.
“Ugh, will he ever stop being
“Hm,” said Baddock, which was ominous for reasons Draco could not quite articulate until almost an hour later, when he came back from dropping his bag into his room and found the entire gobstones team waiting for him at the table near the entrance.
Lyra fluttered close, hooting lowly and preening Draco’s hair. It served as an unhappy reminder that he hadn’t cut it yet, had hardly noticed its growth when he was once so concerned with it. It seemed a habit of a completely different person.Draco batted her beak away and fussily affixed the letter to her leg, and then there was nothing for it; Draco turned.
“Mm, no, I don’t think,” Potter said. His voice was closer now; books hit the tabletop with a careful, muted thud.
Draco scrubbed a hand across his face tiredly, then stared at it. There was no soot, but it felt like there should be. Instead his hand was white and unblemished; he looked up towards the castle, and thought about the fire that might still be burning. His pulse jumped. “No.”
But she wasn’t so far when Draco finally looked up, his mouth twisted with unhappiness. Astoria caught his gaze and held it. “
Malfoy’s breathing has gone funny, the anxiety travelling into his lungs and out of his hands, which are trembling slightly as Malfoy’s chest hitches unevenly.
The impulse was still there, pressing at the back of his mind. Draco wasn’t sure it would ever go away, but it could be soothed, now; quieted by thoughts of Potter, and of Astoria, and of the gobstones team, cheering.
“You’re
“You don’t have to,” Baddock said, voice wavering. “I mean you must have also…even if you were—were—”
"The quidditch pitch," Harry said, suddenly inspired. They hadn’t headed there yet, and somehow, the idea of laying in the middle of that field felt apt.
Nightmares were a boring plague to suffer. The whole dorm took to casting silencing charms before bed, and the prefects pinned a handful of notices regarding improper use of sleeping draughts onto the notice board, underneath an encouragement to seek out Madam Pomfrey for issues, but none of that changed the fact that some evenings found most of the house up in the very early hours, unwilling to return to bed.
have agreed to this tournament had I known someone like you would be participating, Mr. Malfoy. You should be ashamed to show yourself.”
But it turned out the Headmistress hadn’t brought it up to castigate him for allowing his classmates to be imprisoned and tortured in his home. Instead, she neatly refilled his teacup and asked, “Would you like to discuss your experience, Mr. Malfoy?”
to be a dream. He'd been left with sopping bangs for his troubles. "Let me know when you find out."
The next night, Harry and Malfoy got into bed without having said a word to each other the entire day. Once the room filled with sleep sounds, they turned to look at each other before getting out of bed simultaneously.
think so,” Draco said, trying to be snide and missing it miserably. It was the quiet, he thought; it reminded him of the Manor, which once reminded him of peace. He reached for the hawthorn wand.
. Draco blew out a breath. “Because there’s something you should see.”
Maybe it
His eyes skipped over to the summary of stated reasons for the denial, and got stuck on a bit that, despite the lengthy research he’d gone over with Granger, had not come up at all in their preparations. It was the last point, the note-taker’s brevity expressing a clearer annoyance than anything else written:
Harry thinks about sharing.
It was not Monday, which was now his sole brew day for Madam Pomfrey because he was back in classes. Draco stared at the large, forbidding doors for several more breaths, caught in an uncertain sway before he finally, jerkily, pushed them open.
“I could find a way to tell you,” Malfoy says, with a faux-indifference that betrays how he must have been thinking of it for a while. There’s probably already a plan in his head, one of those furious, impossible ones, and he’s only been biding his time until it felt right to bring it up. “That I’m okay. If it would help.”
Sometimes, though, they did speak, their voices startling in the quiet. Meaningless things, thoughtless things; things about classes and quidditch and skirting around things like
Dumbledore is more memory than person, nowadays. This is inconvenient primarily because it forces Harry and Malfoy to try the conversation lark again, since their obvious solution is gone and no one can quite say when he’ll be back.
“Professor Sinistra asked me to give this to you,” Khan said, digging through her satchel and coming up with a rumpled scroll, sealed with a green ribbon.
. Harry didn’t know this until he began kissing Malfoy. When Harry kisses Malfoy, it’s all he can do to keep his heart from bursting out of his chest after him.
There’s a yearning under it that Harry understands, that reminds him terribly of his very first letters to Sirius: Malfoy wants to trust her, so completely that it hurts Harry to see it. But Malfoy’s convinced Andromeda will cease all communication if they tell her who he is before Harry meets with her in person.
The Battle at Hogwarts had been less than six months ago, and Draco could feel the hungry shadow of it in the way Jack Harper muttered, just barely audible,
“I’m not.” Harry’s response is automatic.
, Harry’s noticed; Malfoy’s body always seems to do exactly what it intends to, doesn’t jerk away when it wants to curve closer, doesn’t turn tense when it wants to melt.
wasn’t the sort of person that Potter meant; he meant Weasley and Granger, people who mattered to him. Within the past few weeks, Draco had managed to forget that he wasn’t among that number. The reminder was painful and irritating, glass caught under skin.
Baddock made a very faint, distressed noise, like he’d just witnessed Draco stick a hand into a doxy nest. Two sets of footsteps came to an abrupt stop.
” Draco cried, strangely triumphant
Draco pressed his fingers into the gilded frame again. He took a deep breath, then did the same twice more. It took thirteen steps to reach the classroom door. It took four seconds to open the door.
“Are you just—” Potter started, but was cut off as another cheer, louder than before, sounded behind them.
. It was a quiet, simmering anger, a
consider them friends, though not with the same fierce bond that Harry has with Ron and Hermione. Just enough for Malfoy to worry about what will happen to them as the war progresses, since they also have Death Eaters for fathers and Malfoy, at least, doesn’t have any illusions about children not being drafted into war.
Draco cleared his throat when he was only a few steps away, just outside the alcove, his hand on the stone archway.
“Well,” Draco said, sourly. He upended the bag of owl treats, wondering if the owls would eat his corpse quicker if he was spiced with them. Officer Abbott-Jones had petitioned for him to have full use of his magic while at school, but Draco was certain that Potter was a quicker draw. And anyways, what did it matter? If the last time they’d dueled was any indication, Draco was likely to bleed out before he even hit the ground.
Potter frowned. In the middle of the room, someone conjured a blackboard and a rather loud argument as to the specific wording was underway. Creevey’s charmed chalk made a reappearance, though it kept quivering as if overloaded.
It’s simple, suddenly. He
Malfoy doesn’t answer.
and other such stuff, which at least gave Draco’s quietly panicking brain a new thought to latch onto.
“Yes.”
The dungeon grew briefly airless. Harper, combative and red-faced, said, “He went about it wrong, we’re not saying—”
“I am not abandoning my mother, Potter.” His voice is final.
Harry was faced with the horrible reality that, for the second night in a row, Malfoy would be in his bed. Malfoy had always been distracting to Harry; something about the pointy face and pale hair and horrible habit of insulting everyone and everything Harry knew and loved meant that Malfoy was a near-constant presence in Harry's mind.
Baddock snapped out an arm, stopping both her and Queensbury in their tracks, the move so smooth as to be instinctual. Or, perhaps, learned after a year of constant danger, protecting his own from threats they might not even fully comprehend.
Draco stared at her, then pushed past her without addressing the comment. Whispering started up as Astoria made a small
idea what you’re talking about. And
Queensbury grimaced at that last bit, clutching the arm that had been possibly-fractured-probably-not-broken while he was wrangling with some ivy that had grown a malicious streak after stewing in the aftermath of a nasty curse, and ambled off with the Gryffindor prefect that had set the offending foliage on fire.
taken the wand? And how does the progression of ownership work, I practically
Malfoy’s hand was cool when Harry found it. His fingers curled tight against Harry’s.
“You could
Malfoy’s mouth twists. “I won’t die, Potter.”
And there, in the same place it had always been, was the familiar swell of crisp green ties and piping along black robes. Smaller, scattered, but there all the same at one end of the hall; Draco exhaled and felt Astoria do the same.
“No,” Draco said, drawing the word out slow and sweet. He felt out of body and impervious. “
She’d naturally already won her five rounds, with ruthless efficiency. Draco, on the other hand, had used a scouring charm on his face so many times he was certain his skin was permanently red and raw. It was pure luck that he managed to win even the one round.
Greg sort of nodded to himself. Draco stared at him, the vice around his chest loosening, loosening. Greg said, “I thought you didn’t like gobstones.”
Potter’s jaw twitched. He was beginning to look properly pissed off now, and that was satisfying in the horrible way it always had been. He said, “Can you not be a fucking arse about this?”
“Harry,” Hermione chides, like he’s being purposefully difficult. But Harry never learned how to talk about Malfoy like—like a rational fucking person. Some part of him latched onto Malfoy when they were eleven and never learned to calm down when his name came up in conversation, or when he spotted that distinctive white-blond across the Great Hall.
Draco went back to nodding, anticipating a return to the end of meeting niceties that would allow him to escape this oppressively circular room. But Headmistress McGonagall surprised him yet again by bringing up his complete lack of attendance in classes.
He hadn’t let up until Draco grunted an assurance, unable to look Theo in the eye as the words tumbled over and over in his head, damning and shameful.
the one carrying it around like an idiot.”
“No one really knows what to do about you,” she said, thoughtfully. “If nothing else, it ensures I won’t be the least liked person in the room.”
“Perhaps she was held up.” Draco paused, shouldering past a Ravenclaw who seemed incredulous at the sight of him. “Perhaps Baddock will be there.”
The library was closing in just under an hour, and Draco had stopped reading several long minutes ago in favor of watching Potter pull books at random from the shelves. They were in the long-forgotten
"Something to say, Potter?" Malfoy asked, leaning close.
Potter’s curls were everywhere, as usual, and his robes were rumpled, as usual, and Draco was ninety percent certain he’d be allowed to pull Potter towards him and kiss him again if the single, heated look they’d shared before the Headmistress had forced them all back to their respective common room was any indication. Eighty-five percent sure. His hands were so bloody
“Nothing,” Potter said, with equal force. The faint sound of rumpled parchment reached Draco’s ear; Potter took one step forwards. “I was only—why’re
, Draco thought, and held onto the hurt the thought ignited.
Draco returned to his dorm with a stack of well-thumbed
Potter snorted, then looked up quickly, checking over his shoulder—he, too, had gotten a lecture from Baddock before the tournament started. Having ascertained the coast was clear, Potter shuffled forward until his trainers were between Draco’s outstretched legs. He lowered his voice to match Draco’s. “You’re just mad because you’re not good at it.”
"How long did McGonagall say repairs would take?" Seamus—
see him, a bit suffocated, and Draco couldn’t imagine he would do anything but make that expression worse.
Recently, Harry has been learning the shape worry makes across Malfoy’s body—the stiff shoulders, the purposeful hands, the specific cadence of voice he’s hearing, right now. It’s easy to forget about the fear hidden under all the short-tempered foulness that escapes Malfoy, but it’s there and it’s weighty. Malfoy's spine bows with it.
“Shh,” she said, though Draco hadn’t made a sound. His breathing was uneven, but Draco found that he had more to say: about the gobstones team, and his old friends, and his new ones. He spoke about the repairs to the castle, and the service hours with Madam Pomfrey, and even about the scene in the common room at the beginning of the year, though he could not quite bring himself to discuss the rest of it. And all the while his mother kept her arm close around him like she used to when he was a child, listening even as the wintry sunrise crept into the room with its slow, searching fingers, drenching them both in crisp light.
Draco blinked at her, chest heaving slightly. He hadn’t even realized where he was going. “I just,” he began, his voice unsteady, “thought you may need more assistance today.”
Thestrals and birds dived in and out of the sky. The wind continued to blow, treetops swaying while Potter stood, deathly still, and Draco, legs dangling, watched. When Potter eventually turned—as he was always going to, Draco told the jumping pulse of his heart—he did not turn towards the castle. Or he did, but not towards the doors to the Entrance Hall; he turned in the direction of the Owlery and looked up.
The conclusion Harry comes to is this: he is a wick meant to be ignited and left to burn itself out. Not a candle wick, the sort of thing that can provide comfort and light. He’s the long wick of dynamite, a cartoon image taken from stolen glimpses of the morning shows Dudley used to watch. Something that leaves craters and dust.
Draco found, in that exact moment, that the part of him that was willing to gracefully accept death-by-Potter, redux, was actually quite a bit smaller than the part of him that refused, wandpoint-blank, to let himself be offed by
Greg’s chest heaved. He was too thin. He said, “I don’t know what’s true anymore,” and he sounded as lost as he had when they were children roaming the Manor.
They sat in comfortable silence after that, watching the colors fade from the sky and plunge them back into darkness. And then they sat a while longer, their hands held tightly between them, until Harry yawned so widely he felt his jaw crack. Malfoy laughed, a small huff of breath, and hauled Harry up to his feet.
Potter was staring so intently at Draco’s face that it was almost a glare. But it wasn’t. It was just attention, focused and singular, and Draco felt light-headed with it.
He was going to be sick, but he could probably make it to the loo first. Perhaps Potter would happen upon Draco there and kill him, properly this time. They were fighting again, after all. Draco sent him an awful, hasty letter the other morning, but Draco understood now the folly of that. It was arrogance. Whatever momentary madness caused those first few weeks had run its course and it was arrogance for Draco to think—
“What?” Draco asked. On Potter’s other side, Granger and Weasley were bent together, having a whispered argument and determinedly not looking in Draco’s direction.
Shardlow, behind Baddock’s shoulder, made a sharp noise of affront. It turned her voice sharper, posher. “You haven’t
“What—we’ll be late meeting her—”
When Harry sat up that evening, Malfoy was frowning hard at the ceiling. He was clearly thinking about something, and when he noticed Harry staring at him, he only frowned harder.
It didn’t take a genius to figure out that Potter was wholly uninterested in the attention people kept attempting to lavish upon him; even Draco could see that, understood that Granger and Weasley were as much as a shield as they were a comfort to Potter. It would be worse, much worse, were he to appear in Godric’s Hollow tomorrow.
“I should quit,” Draco continued. It seemed the only achievable answer. The best answer would, obviously, be to retire to the unprotected Manor, gutted and cold and still leeching dark magic, and sit upon its roof to wait for the inevitable. But he had his probation. He had his promise to his mother.
Malfoy’s touch is enigmatic, balancing the knife’s edge between Harry’s two knowns. Harry bites Malfoy’s lower lip and draws blood. Malfoy bites the pulse point in Harry’s neck and draws moans. Neither of them have gentle hands, but neither of them seem to mind the bruising. This is one of those enigmatic things.
“She’ll kick me out otherwise,” Draco told her, making a face at the slight rasp to his voice. He cleared his throat, straightened his spine. “And I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
The Battle swelled in the way Baddock, hanging back near the notice board, flinched at the slur, his face closed off. The petition had been ripped from the notice board, the torn parchment as visceral an injury as the rubble still littering the castle grounds, the unmitigated damage that greeted the students as they exited the carriages the first day back to school and realized that Hogwarts was, like them, still entrenched.
“I don’t think they wanted to know me,” Potter said after a moment, but Draco could feel the weight of his hard gaze prickling at the top of Draco’s bowed head.
Harry stays there, inhaling the scent of freshly laundered clothes and sharp cologne and the Malfoy-smell underneath. Stays there until his body stops expecting a blow that he knows, in his head if nowhere else, is not coming.
Malfoy’s hands don’t ever touch Harry like they’re terrified.
butting against
if it was actually going to be read. His father had never read the ones that came late in the day, even if they were technically still submitted within the right time frame.
Draco unrolled the parchment as he walked away from them, balking at Professor Sinistra’s unadorned
“You’re staring,” Malfoy said in a very quiet whisper, when they finally pulled away. His cheeks were pink.
The Headmistress did not appear to notice this influx of anxiety. She said,
He said, “The board of governors would never agree to undo the wards. I don’t know if anyone even knows how they were laid in the first place.”
“Which one?” Harry asks after a long moment. Realistically, he thinks he knows.
“Right.” Malfoy sounds a little cross about it all; Harry smiles weakly despite himself. “So stop being an idiot about this. It’s only two weeks.”
—after Draco stepped inside the fireplace. One SAD guard was posted at the desk in the middle of the cramped floo room, and another stood to the side of the fireplace Draco exited, fussily brushing soot off of his uniform. A humiliated red crawled up his neck and into his face; he felt ridiculous standing here in his school robes.
he upset? Harry doesn’t know. He never knows when he’s upset unless something has already broken because of it. His heart is going
Ignoring the stares of the other students, Draco turned neatly, spinning Astoria with him, and stepped determinedly towards the Great Hall.
Harry knows a thing or two about greed. The first thing he knows is this: the direct corollary to greed is a want. In order to not be greedy, you must not want anything. This is why Harry has to fold his wants into the tiniest pieces he can, because otherwise someone will notice and take even the scraps away. Learned knowledge.
—else to focus his attention on. His mother was due a response to her letter about her newly secured flat. Baddock had begun nattering on about how Draco should attend gobstones practice with the rest of the team. Astoria was keeping Draco unnecessarily abreast of the movement with the petition and the preparations for the governors’ meeting. He had quite enough on his plate without considering the quiet injuries inflicted upon him by wayward Gryffindors.
Hearing it said back to him makes Harry immediately understand how stupid it sounds, declaring their hate for each other like this. As if it matters anymore.
This certainty solidified like cold steel in Draco’s chest, the way reality tended to when he reminded himself of his shortcomings. It stung, but the thought calmed Draco nevertheless. Whatever Greg said, he would accept, because it would be true, and deserved. Whatever Greg did, he would accept, for the same reason. It was calming. It was how Draco thought he should have felt when he was sentenced, only for his trial to be derailed by his father’s interference. Someone was meant to pass judgment on Draco and his misdeeds, and if it wasn’t going to be Potter—for whatever inexplicable reason—then of course it would be Greg. Draco had ruined his life. Draco had killed his best friend. Draco was culpable. Draco had been waiting for this.
“It’s
“Who?”
Draco fled. He took the steps two at a time, faster than the charm moving them, and nearly crashed into the stone gargoyles as they slid open.
“Yeah,” Harry says, unhappily aware that
His gut twisted painfully, a vindictive, darkly satisfied spiral all the way up into Draco’s chest. The class held its collective breath and waited to see what Potter would do, but Draco already knew what Potter would do: nothing. Potter had never wanted to be Draco’s friend, not from that very first minute, and their argument had only proved the futility of any attempt otherwise. Potter would turn and sit on the Gryffindor side, and Draco would be rendered a nonentity while
Draco stared mutely at his hands, interlaced tightly. The shimmer of a binding spell blinked back at him, twisted lavender around each wrist and pressing subtly against his pulse.
They stood shoulder-to-shoulder, staring down at Vince’s stone, set along the other students as if he belonged there, as if they thought his was a memory that would be cherished and missed. Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Vince’s stone looked like at the beginning of the year; he found himself shamefully glad that he hadn’t checked earlier, certain that it would have been another thing that sent him stumbling upwards, towards the sky.
Draco nodded; it wasn’t like he would be able to go to any of the bigger tournaments with his parole requirements. “Fine,” he said, curt. He didn’t think he even had a gobstones set anymore.
“I don’t know,” he said again, and felt miserable for it. It was likely she didn’t; Crabbe had already been seventeen when he died, and only his father had been alive, at the end of the battle, to learn of his death. The ministry wouldn’t have gone farther than that. Why would they?
"I told you," Draco said, a little unsteadily. "You have to ask for the right thing."
“Did you know,” Ron says, voice pitched low, “that Mum said the Tonks’ might be stopping by for Christmas? Sounds like Order business.”
Harry doesn’t know what Malfoy’s excuse is.
“Budge over,” Draco said instead, and Potter did so, tucking his knees toward his chest. Their legs knocked and settled; one of Draco’s caught between Potter’s, and the other hanging idly over the ledge.
Creevey waved this away, already turning back to the rest of the room while Draco made his way towards Astoria. She lifted her bag from the seat behind the desk, smiling smugly, and Draco flicked the end of her ponytail when he sat down.
So here Draco was, sitting with his spine ramrod straight while a sixth-year Hufflepuff stood up, very abruptly, in the middle of dinner and said that he was going home, no, it was okay, he just really couldn’t sit here and eat or breathe and—he looked at Draco, then, his eyes an impossible blue, and Draco stared helplessly back as silence coalesced thickly around him—really, he couldn’t stand the sight of this place, he was going
With the beginnings of a solution in hand, Granger and Creevey planned another meeting to discuss the idea with the rest of the volunteers. Draco, for once, found himself memorizing the date and time with the intent of actually going when he saw it posted on the notice board.
“You’re not really thinking straight,” Malfoy chides, but there’s no heat behind it. “I’m not useful if I’m dead, and it would be more suspicious if I don’t show up. Even
,” Potter said immediately, and it was a
“Okay,” Harry says, and then doesn’t know what to do. Doesn’t know why his skin is prickling when this is usually the part where it forgets itself, or why it bothers him that Malfoy is saying that he’s not upset when he is. Harry feels stifled, suddenly. He wants to go back to before he opened his mouth, wants to get to the part where everything is reduced to pleasure and movement, but he also—doesn’t. “Fine.”
She gave him a reprimanding look, sweeping forward to press a hand to his cheek before asking after the trip and fussing at him until he was out of his cloak and hat and seated in the nearby armchair, possibly pilfered from the Manor.
is not a lesson he was ever taught. Harry knows anger. He doesn’t know much of anything else.
Draco stood. The noise in the hall ebbed and rose as he slipped from his seat and out of the heavy doors. When they closed, the noise was cut off completely, leaving Draco to hear only the strange pant of his breathing and the frantic pace of his heart, which followed him the whole way back to his bed in the Slytherin dorms, inescapable.
Draco cut him off, terror thudding loud in his ears. “I’m not sure.”
“Mad, isn’t it?” Draco snorted. They’d all broken from the meeting a short while ago, to ostensibly gain cover before all sneaking out to meet in the ruined corridor. Draco reviewed the calculations Granger had written during the meeting, and was frowning over them. “There isn’t enough time to do the repairs in one night.”
to,” Harry manages to spit out, knees buckling as he loses his balance, and there’s a burr of—worry, at the edges of his rage.
Harry would bet his broom that Malfoy had never so much as
“I will if he does,” Harry offers, copper sliding sickly down the back of his throat. His nose really does hurt; for someone with such thin wrists, Malfoy has a solid punch. A strong grip, too, but that’s learned knowledge from a different occasion.
“I’m certain you are,” she said, her disbelief ringing clear through her tone. She conjured a side table and placed the mug upon it. “Drink that before you do the day’s brewing. It had a splash of calming draught.”
Baddock wasn’t meant to look like that. Not when playing gobstones, which he loved. The war was not supposed to take this away as well.
this, you prick.”
For several frozen seconds, the only sound Harry can hear is the rapid, guilty gallop of his heart.
More nights than he’d like to admit, Harry wakes up certain of his impending death. It’s not a nightmare, exactly. It’s just knowledge that presses insistently along his skull, etching itself into the delicate bone:
“I’m going now,” Potter said again, taking a step backwards. That almost-smile was still on his mouth, and his eyes were fixed on Draco’s face as he took another step back, and then another.
would let you stay,” Myrtle said, twisting and toppling gracefully over the divider to hover at Draco’s side.
Then he lifts his head and they notice each other, so what comes out of Harry’s mouth is, “Malfoy.”
Draco tripped over Potter on his way to the shed. He went down with a surprisingly painful crash, forearms and one palm smarting from attempting to catch himself as he fell. Potter made a vaguely pained noise, then lifted his head to look at Draco, sprawled across his legs from the fall. The remnants of a warming charm emanated from him.
Grief reached its cold hands into Draco’s chest and splintered his ribcage. “Yes,” he said, and it hurt. It hurt, but he said it again, in a rush, “Yes, yes, don’t you?”
. He exhales forcefully, glaring at the outline of the pitch and Hogwarts behind Malfoy’s shoulder.
“There are worse things than disobeying your parents,” he said lightly.
Almost like he could feel Harry looking, Malfoy turned his head. His eyes were very, very bright.
All the air leaves Harry’s lungs at once. “Oh,” he whispers.
Draco’s mouth quirks up. He doesn’t quite meet Harry’s eyes when he asks, “You’re sure of that, are you?”
The words were said with relish. Draco wondered how long she’d been waiting on those words, if perhaps she’s said them before. After his sentencing, letters and howlers had flooded the Manor. Draco imagined Professor Applesnap as one of those furious letter-writers, pinning their fear and pain on Draco because he was culpable and recognizable, because he’d gotten away, because no one would stop them.
It takes another moment before Harry realizes that Hermione and Ron are not a figment of his imagination, but
,” Harry says, scandalized. Malfoy makes a noise that suggests he, too, has been subjected to a diagnostic spell. “You can’t just—you shouldn’t—”
And the oddest thing about it all is that Malfoy doesn’t even seem to mind.
Harry has a hold of Malfoy’s left forearm, nails digging mercilessly into the raised edges of the Dark Mark. As if he can claw it off Malfoy’s skin if he just presses far enough.
Draco had stood in front of that blank wall on the seventh floor and he hadn't cared what Potter was searching for. He had only wanted to find him.
"And let Black kill you without an audience?" Malfoy shot back. They argued in whispers the whole walk, only quieting when the portraits they passed started questioning aloud what the noise was.
“I don’t,” Draco said, unsure why that shameful heat built behind his eyes and at the swell of his cheeks. “I don’t—
“Harry.” Hermione stops him just outside the doors to the hospital wing, her brows furrowed. Hermione’s concern is as brisk as everything else about her, but she falters, this once. “I just—I don’t understand your obsession with him.”
Harry was left to wonder if he'd done something unspeakable in another life. Why else would he have Voldemort and crazed murderers after him
But Potter stood up, too; said, “Okay,” in a rush that had Draco looking at him askance. Potter frowned at his stupidly large pile of novels, seemingly torn as he looked between Draco and the sodding books, like he couldn’t quite figure out the steps needed to do whatever it was he needed to.
Worse, Draco was certain that any iteration of those thoughts would cause his mother concern. He didn’t want her to be concerned. He’d promised, to himself if no one else, that he wouldn’t allow her to suffer for his pain. So he stared at his blank parchment until the minutes spilled over into hours.
decision,” Draco said, scowling. “Do what you like.”
"It's easier than they think," Draco said. He turned to the side slightly, to give Potter a considering look.
Greg stopped mid-step. “Draco?”
“Well if you’d gone to the meetings, you’d know,” Astoria began, pointedly; she’d invited him last week, and Draco had instead spent the evening repairing a crumbling column at the far edge of the castle, the furthest point of damage from the Battle. “We need to submit it in advance of the meeting.”
She raised an eyebrow as if she knew what he was thinking, but her voice was more amused than anything. “I transferred to Hogwarts from Uagadou in my fifth year,” she explained. “I was sorted into Slytherin nearly the moment the hat touched my head.”
The revelation goes like this: it is September 1st. Summer is over. Harry has blood in his kiss-bruised mouth. Malfoy has a mark the shape of Harry’s teeth in the sweet spot of skin above his collarbone. A matching mark sits in the juncture of Harry’s neck. Their shirts are white flags thrown against the floor.
“—can’t tolerate that no matter what, I mean, why else was it so easy for the aurors to fall in line with Ministry once You-Know-Who rose—”
That gave Draco a brief moment of pause. “Sorry?”
Draco shifted his weight from one foot to the other. Greg watched with obvious confusion. Draco said, brisk, “I was at the memorial. The, uh. War one.”
Draco jolted at the sound, his whole body warming as he turned towards Potter. With the confusion of the past few hours, including a particularly drawn-out argument in the Slytherin common room that ate up most of Draco’s morning, he hadn’t yet seen Potter since the wards came down. Or since their kiss, which Draco was recalling with dazzling clarity as Potter stepped into the Owlery, making his hands feel clammy and overlarge.
, Malfoy will say later, while Harry is in the middle of wishing visceral harm upon him.
She blinked rather quickly. “He said you were alive.”
Harry doesn’t really understand how it can be hard at all, and says as much.
crawling all over his spine. “I wasn’t the one in danger,” he snapped, thinking of the muggles, of Lovegood and Thomas, of the young girl bitten by werewolves, of Baddock himself, who was just
He was using a very reasonable tone of voice, as if they were talking about adjusting the prefect rounds and not something alarmingly close to subterfuge of the Wizengamot. Draco explained this as crisply and derisively as possible, and still Queensbury said, as if Draco had said nothing at all, “If we don’t head out soon, we’ll all be late.”
“Oh?” Malfoy’s lips curl into a familiar, maddening smirk; Harry’s stomach flips, and he promptly loses his thread of thought. “Want to do more of
. It just means that he can’t say anything about the pretending. So he folds his hands under the cloak, to stop them from betraying him, and bites his lip, for the same reason.
A week later, Harry is stepping out of the carriages and onto the platform at Hogsmeade station, where the crimson Hogwarts Express waits for them. He tucks his nose into the thick, enchanted scarf wound around his neck—Draco’s gift to him—and lets himself be pushed onto the train and down the corridor by the flow of his friends and classmates.
Her voice was so polite it was somehow insulting. Percy puffed up his chest, and a short moment later, the Slytherins were being led up the spiral staircase while Percy lectured at the head of the line.
“Well?” he asked, but it came out more as a demand.
Professor Sprout, directing the Fat Friar and another ghost to act as guides for the guests, didn’t appear to have realized there was a problem yet.
Further complicating things was that Draco felt foolish about the earnestness last night and did not want to look Potter in the eye to see how he felt about it. Potter had returned his wand, true, and Draco was thankful, but that didn’t account for the ease with which they had spoken to each other, or the fact that they lingered in each other’s presence well beyond what politeness would dictate. If not for the cold and the silvery terrier that spoke in Weasley’s voice, threatening a search party, Draco couldn’t say which of them would have been the first to rise.
, but he remained carefully still as he listened to Professor Sinistra explain the sorts of parameters that might facilitate this. She would speak to the Headmistress, she said. She would like to speak to Mr. Baddock as well, she said. It was clear that the student body had not been given space to explore their grief, their anger, their trauma, she said. She would host a house meeting, during the weekend, in order to determine what might best help students to digest the events of the past year, she said.
“Your hands are bloody freezing,” Malfoy complains, barely moving his mouth away enough to make the words audible.
Harry should know better than to want things, is the point. But the third thing he knows is this: no matter how good of an actor you are, greed only grows.
He spent the evening convinced he was going to finally be expelled, which was less of a gratitude than it had been only a month ago; and spent the morning delivering his coursework by the armload, dropping off the potions he brewed to a surprised Professor Slughorn and sitting in Professor Flitwick’s office, tense and uncomfortable, to perform the charms on the syllabus since Charms, like potions, had practical demonstration built into its grade calculation.
Draco woke retching. He pressed his hands to his eyelids until the nausea passed, overly aware of the panic-drenched state of his sheets and the burn in his throat. His hand shook terribly when he vanished the mess, and the bathroom light was too bright when he stepped inside to rinse his mouth. Giving up sleep entirely, he wandered into the common room, pulling on a dressing gown to ward off the chills shuddering through him.
Draco stared at the unvarnished tabletop, his gaze unfocused. The door squeaked open, then shut with finality. There was no clock in the room, and no windows, and it was so thoroughly soundproofed that Draco could not hear the sounds of footsteps in the hall outside.
Draco left with the bell, even though he didn’t have classes this morning. He went to the library early, for once on the search for a distinctive head of hair that was not Potter’s.
Harry yanks Malfoy forward, their knees and chests crashing against each other gracelessly. It’s not quite a kiss, this scrape of teeth against thin lips, but that doesn’t matter. It never does, really, because the hunger is so big and so irrepressible and so
Potter mirrored him, raising an eyebrow. He said, "Getting into the Room of Requirement wasn't that simple."
"Erm," Harry said. As there was no good answer to this, his brain decided to shut itself off entirely. This was the only explanation for the next words out of his mouth being, "It's rather small, don't you think?"
Saying it aloud nearly made Draco laugh at the impossibility of it, at the danger of it. The idea was so fundamentally counter to his understanding of the world that he could only stare, suspended in a state of disbelief, when Creevey grimly nodded.
Malfoy kisses his nape after; feather-light, practically imagined if not for the very real warmth it leaves in its wake. He’s started doing this, sometimes, these tiny, tentative kisses after the urgency has fled them both. Harry thinks there’s something very sideways and backwards about the progression of it all, but that doesn’t mean he wants it to stop. Something in him will rebel, if it stops.
"It's simple," said Creevey, sounding winded. He and Ginny Weasley had touched ground some time ago, coming through a new archway that led out to the grass. "'Hogwarts, get rid of the wards, thanks!'"
“Uh huh,” said Potter, as Draco’s voice rose, and occasionally, “Mm-hm,” and at some point, Draco stopped in his pacing and ranting to throw a deep glower in Potter’s direction.
Draco broke Theo’s gaze, his throat bobbing with an unsteady swallow. Every word of his argument with Potter was blaring through his skull, as was every fumbling attempt at apology that Draco had written into a letter and sent to Potter the morning after his conversation with Greg, and all it did was make Draco feel more and more foolish and blundering.
He was certain that he could think of another half-dozen if given more time than the stalk from the Great Hall to the Library, and he was doubly certain that they could think of a permanent way to do the same.
“You lied,” Lucius had said, to Narcissa. It was the second thing Draco heard from him since the battle began. The first had been his name, shouted, exultant.
“Sorry,” Draco said, which felt equally damning, perhaps moreso.
“I bet it was hard for her,” Malfoy says, now, while Harry scribbles the last line of the letter—Andromeda has taken to asking about his studies and quidditch in between her probing—against the wall of the Owlery. It’s risky, always risky, when they linger in common areas for too long together, but the biting wind coming through the large, open windows is a deterrent for most students and Harry has his invisibility cloak tucked into his robes just in case.
And then, because this whole evening felt a frantic and impossible thing anyways, Harry took out his invisibility cloak.
Christmas break came with flurries of snow that turned to grey sludge underfoot and Potter saying, “Don’t make it weird.”
“Stuff,” Harry says vaguely, lunging for Malfoy’s blurry form and managing to grab the sleeve of his impossibly soft jumper. Malfoy lifts his hand higher in response. Harry’s irritated huff is interrupted by a yawn, which he deals with by pressing his face into Malfoy’s chest.
Potter jolted a bit, clearing his throat suddenly. “I’ll—I’ll tell you later. Just let me back into the castle, okay?”
. Those are wishes."
Draco soon learned that he was very bad at gobstones. It did not seem like the sort of thing that should be possible, because gobstones did not seem like the sort of thing that required any kind of skill set.
Potter’s answering grin was slow, a quirk of his lips that lit his whole face. He was already so close, which made it easy for Draco to tilt his face the rest of the way down and press their mouths together, tentatively. Then again, more certain, when Potter’s mouth opened under his, his hand abandoning its grip on Draco’s wrist to clutch at the front of his robes, pulling Draco closer.
“Dad couldn’t understand it,” said Creevey. He was sitting on a decorative bench near the cloisters that Draco spent the year avoiding until now, trailing reluctantly behind a surprisingly quick Granger. In the middle of the square was the memorial that sent a fresh wave of guilt into the pit of Draco’s stomach. He avoided looking right at it, thinking it was somewhat like a boggart.
The last Hogsmeade trip of the year takes place on December 14th, the sky overhead muted and insistent with either rain or snow. Harry finds himself glancing upwards during his walk through Hogsmeade, mostly because he doesn’t want to think too hard about his destination and only a little because the color reminds him of Malfoy’s eyes.
Zeller levelled an unimpressed look at him. “Shardlow gave me the password. Don’t change the subject, Malfoy. What happened?”
upset?” Malfoy asks, pretty and pink-cheeked and cross.
“I don’t know.” Potter had also closed his eyes, but he opened them now; blinked at the sight before them, then turned to blink those green eyes at Draco. “I wanted something normal, I think.”
“You didn’t lose nearly as many points as Malfoy,” Potter told her consolingly, before Zeller could. “I mean, just look at his hair.”
Draco blew out a slow breath. He had gotten more used to being back around other students now that he was back in classes, but anxiety still skimmed its fingers along his spine at the thought of a gathering that did not have the same parameters. But if the meeting was in Slytherin…
Draco did not move from his spot. “I had no idea you were such a punctual person.”
gobstones,” Draco snapped, but quietly, in case Baddock overheard. He had disturbingly sharp hearing when it came to gobstones. “It’s a juvenile game with absolutely no purpose, nevermind what Baddock has to say about it.”
Once again, Office Abbott-Jones called out the floo address—
“Sorry,” said Olivia Shardlow, a third year with a small puff of an afro, looking absolutely miserable. She, like Draco, had only won a single round. She, unlike Draco, was absolutely cut up about it.
wand, the one that had chosen him. A muted longing twisted through him. Draco wanted, desperately, to reach for it, but was afraid, too. He wasn’t sure how he would react if he found that his old wand no longer resonated with his magic.
“No,” Potter said, smiling slightly like he thought there was something very funny about the question. “But I don’t think I have to be.”
idiocy."
Harry decided to help him along. "You'd sleep next to a corpse, then. Or were you thinking of smuggling my body out without anyone noticing?" Now that Harry thought about it, could one Vanish a dead body? Couldn't anyone get away with murder that way?
“Fuck no,” Draco responded. His pulse was beating recklessly in his throat, at his wrists, along his tongue. He felt like he was getting away with something, although he didn’t know what.
that it overshadows everything else. Malfoy’s mouth opens hot and savage against Harry’s, fingers unclenching to bury themselves in Harry’s curls, tight enough to hurt.
“He’s a prefect,” Draco pointed out, unsure if he was meant to move his arm away. He’d always been a tactile person, but that was before he sullied himself on the wrong side of a war. When he tried to pull out of Astoria’s grip, she simply tightened her hold. “The gobstones bit is a bore, but he’s otherwise inoffensive. And he signed the petition; surely he’d at least consider going.”
Harry knew he was going to miss this. He was going to miss it terribly, which was why he couldn’t bring himself to say it. “It’s—it’s good, that you’ll be back in your own room.”
, let me go!”
A grimace twisted Baddock’s square face. “Just once,” he said, though it was clear that it was costing him greatly to admit it. “Otherwise we won’t have a team score on the roster. The first tournament is supposed to be in November.”
Some of it even had to be learned the Muggle way. But he only ever used what he learned on himself, or once on Luna Lovegood, and another on Dean Thomas. And even then, it was only because he recognized them.
Harry pulls his knees to his chest and presses his forehead to them. Malfoy is still holding his hand. It’s stupid, how much that means to him.
, Harry says, to himself; Malfoy says, to himself,
Draco was struck all over again by the impossibility of the night before. His heart was so loud when he thought about it. But Potter was here, and he had been waiting, and it had not been a dream.
“Because it’s important.”
Draco, however, had spent much of the past two years face to face with injuries, worse ones: prisoners with blackened mouths, eyes empty; the cracked pleading as Nagini coiled around an immobilized body; the remains of a family Greyback’s pack herded into the lonely Manor fields and mutilated, the youngest dying a month later, unable to survive her first turn under the moonlight.
, Merlin’s fucking ballsacks—
had only sort-of worked, much to her confused consternation.
Potter, clearly having noticed that Draco’s attention was elsewhere, moved closer, into Draco’s face. He still didn’t look angry, exactly. He didn’t look like anything Draco had ever seen before.
But Astoria simply tapped the parchment with her wand, a wordless spell furling it into a tight scroll, and then gave Draco an expectant look.
What Draco had

With that, she disappeared into the classroom. There was a brief roar of noise as the door opened, a voice calling a greeting over the din, and then silence as Astoria pushed the door closed.
Her shoulders jumped a little, like she really
Draco let Potter talk, attempting to reconcile the existence of a mythological object and his own passing ownership of it— “Are you seriously telling me,” Draco demanded about halfway through, outraged, “that I was cowering in my own sick when I had the most powerful wand in the world? Even
Incredulous, Draco answered, “I was something of an accessory to several murders and terrorist acts during the war. You may not have heard.”
Draco’s erratic breathing was the only anchor to his body, his instinctive recoil to the question distant, distant. “No,” he said, then, “Yes.” But his brain was blinking out into a plane of pure white.
Greg made a rough noise at the back of his throat. “D’you think they know?”
“Oh my
wanted Malfoy to come with him again. It felt like if Malfoy didn't come, then this—this not-friendship would come to a strangely final end.
“Baddock,” Greg repeated, as if he didn’t know who that was. But then he said, “He’s captain now.”
Baddock turned back to Draco, straightened his shoulders, and said, “Do you think Goyle would join?”
“Good morning, Myrtle,” he said, rubbing a hand over his face to rid it of the wetness. It was impossible for him to be irritated with Myrtle in any constructive way; he’d been mean and sharp towards her the first half of sixth year, but it had worn almost immediately into a thick, painful gratitude for her presence. Even now, he felt a curl of it, pathetic and small; she’d cared, inasmuch as was possible for a ghost fifty years gone of her humanity. “I’ve class to get to.”
"It’s not—I realize that this may be difficult to believe, but I actually had many other things on my mind at the time," Draco continued, voice gathering speed. "It was a bit of a war zone, if you remember."

Thus humbled, Draco said, “I’ve not done anything, Potter.”
“Are you going to class?” Potter called after him, nearly knocking right into Draco in his haste to catch his wrist.
Malfoy scowled at him, balancing precariously on one foot to shove his shoe—a glossy, out of place shoe—on the other foot. "And what will I say if one of the other idiotic Gryffindors notice that you're gone, hm? I assume you're all act first, think never types.
, Draco thought, helplessly.
Draco disregarded the information about the volunteer meetings but made a mental note of the date of the open governor’s board meeting before turning away.
The second is the boy, sixteen and boneless in Harry’s lap, humming his pleasure into Harry’s neck and urging Harry towards his own. This is the Malfoy he maps out with his mouth, the one who has found a hundred ways to make Harry fall apart and invented a hundred more to put him back together. This is the Malfoy that infatuates him.

His head felt crowded, his heart scrabbling against his ribs; he’d extracted one memory, and watched, hawk-eyed, over those who chose to fall into the pensieve—had been surprised when Baddock came over, asking how to extract a memory, and then watched as Baddock pulled a long strand from his temple and let it float into Zubeida Khan’s pensieve. Images flickered to the surface; a forest blurring past, spellfire catching trees, a Snatcher’s arm, a young woman with Baddock’s hair.
whispered to each other during class like always. It was inevitable. It had always been, and the part of Draco that was always seeking the sky twinged at the thought.
, because that’s his excuse: he hasn’t figured anything out, nothing at all, and Malfoy smirks and obligingly dips his head back down, and—
Harry rubs a bit of the paste on the bruised bridge of Malfoy’s nose before capping the tin. “You were working on the cabinet? All day?”
of it, his imagination spluttered out like an underwhelming patronus charm in the face of a dementor. He forgot to adjust the heating charms on the showers before stepping in, and misaligned the buttons of his shirt as he got dressed, hair still dripping coldly down his back. He couldn’t think past the question it left with him and attempts to distract himself away from the trailing thought proved fruitless. His brain was stuck on Potter as it always had been. He had a bag still stuffed with Potter’s books, and Potter’s map, and a wide, blank expanse of space where the two of them were meant to have enmity, but instead had a hollow that was quickly, terrifyingly, turning into something else entirely.
“The decision was non-appealable,” Granger said, but in the same manner one might comment on the less than ideal weather on a day they were already planning to spend inside.
“Hm?” she answered, looking over his shoulder and waving at someone. “Oh, Queensbury is here. Budge over, Malfoy, would you—good morning, Queensbury, would you mind telling Malfoy about the thing we don’t talk about?”

"It might not be that bad," Neville—
,” Malfoy argues, finally losing control of his temper. He stalks forward and Harry holds his ground, glaring as Malfoy comes right up to him and grabs his chin in one hand as if
November continued its hazy progression. There were classes Draco didn’t attend, and meals he took directly from the Great Hall to the Slytherin common room, and the hot prickle of Potter’s gaze, the nudge of his elbow, the touch of his shoulder. Sometimes, devastatingly, Draco would remember the line of Potter’s side against his chest and the sound of his laughter echoing within his ribcage. The hitch of Potter’s breath, like Halloween night, but more fatal. The memory would make Draco’s thoughts stall, cotton-headed, until he was shaken back into himself, or until someone else did the shaking for him.
Malfoy grins, wide and mischievous. He’s brilliant against the backdrop of snow and dark sky. “Is that a yes?”
Despite Harry’s persistence, Malfoy didn’t budge from his answer, finally snapping a, “Shut up, will you?” as they settled down, face to face.
Professor Sinistra eyed Draco critically. “Take the time to think about it,” she said, voice kinder than Draco was used to. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t wish to, Mr. Malfoy.”
for what we’re asking.”
, before neatly tacking it to the mental board that held all the other things he was meant to deal with later. This included a distressing number of throw-away comments by Potter, but also things like the concept of freedom, and that endless stretch of time spent in Azkaban, and the fact that in all this time, he and Potter had never once mentioned the war or the years before it.
Draco stared at her, a hot, panicked sort of hatred rising in his chest. “No.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said again, louder, because he had no respect for libraries.
This is a distraction. Harry kisses him anyways. Harry kisses Malfoy like his mouth was designed to do only that for hours and hours and hours on end. Harry

standing there, expressions of mingled alarm and confusion on their faces. In one dark hand, Hermione holds the Marauder’s map; Ron, on her other side, holds the invisibility cloak in a tight, freckled grip. Both have their wands up, clearly having expected to see—well, just about anything other than this.
Potter gave him a narrow look, like he thought Draco was making fun of him, before pushing a hand through his curls and exhaling roughly. “They hate me.”
Greg was still frowning. “Why?”
Still, Draco caught flashes of Greg in the mornings, roused from his sleep and silently shuffling towards the bathroom while Draco remained smothered in the too-hot confines of his sheets, unable to rise. Azkaban and the Ministry holding cells had hollowed Greg of everything, even the anger, and left a wisp of the boy Draco had grown up with, scrubbed raw and still open.
Harry gasps, as much from the shock of pain as from the rush of arousal, his grip going weak against Malfoy’s collar.
“I think it sounds nice,” Potter finally said, wistful and quiet. “Molly and Arthur would have come, if they could. Maybe—” He cut himself off abruptly, grief momentarily folding his face, before he shook it off and continued, “Would your parents have?”
“I don’t know,” Potter said, words still so quiet. Draco wanted to lean forward. He wanted to run fast in the opposite direction. Potter had that intent look again, and his fingers appeared between the front of the cloak, curling into the fabric, holding it close to his body like he thought Draco would try and take it away from him. The corners of his mouth lifted upwards, just slightly. “You did grab my books.”
Draco swallowed heavily. It wasn’t funny, anymore. It was hard to remember how he’d ever thought it had been.
. Surely the Headmistress knew that. Draco’s stomach plummeted. But of course she did. Didn’t they always know every awful thing Draco got himself into?
bed!— and pulling the covers up around his ears, nearly.
So long as Draco didn’t look Potter directly in the eye and avoided all potentially fatal conversational topics, it was quite easy to be Potter’s friend. It was a little like a boggart in that way; if he looked at Potter directly, their relationship would shift to reflect the fears Draco kept buried, and that was not the sort of thing one brought up out of nowhere.
that particular expression, the one that wants to be fury but isn’t.
When the war was on in earnest, several of them were dumped at the Manor because their parents were known or suspected Death Eaters; they couldn’t be used against their parents if they were also secreted away at the Manor, and so long as they were quiet and unobtrusive, nothing—no one—would remember they were there and hurt them. Draco sometimes ate with them—a slight, for his failures and reluctance, to be placed with children, but Draco always welcomed it, even as confused humiliation stung at him.
Harry starts to sit up, realizes he’s definitely still naked, and pauses. Malfoy’s hand, light on Harry’s back, twitches.
“Truly shocking,” Malfoy says, his voice suspiciously even. He holds Harry very tightly. “I hadn’t the faintest.”
He wavered again. Madam Pomfrey, unperturbed, asked, “Would it help to have something to do while you speak?”
He wanted to snatch it back a moment later, worried it was too blithe, too presumptive. They’d shared a single conversation in the Owlery, a long hour of sunlight overlooking the rubble of the campus and the jagged lines of the forest. Surely that wasn’t enough to put them on courteous greetings already.
The approach of Halloween was accompanied by crisp leaves and levitating pumpkins and Potter, still, almost daily; finding Draco in the library after dinner, or in an airy classroom during a free period, as if they had promises to keep. It was the most bizarre thing of the year thus far, and a wild, inexpressible feeling tangled in Draco’s throat every time he looked up to find Potter heading unerringly towards him or, better, seemingly waiting for him. It was causing the steadiest, sweetest destruction of Draco’s sanity.
“Good,” Potter said. On his other side, space was being made for Granger and Weasley, who were already heading over with looks of exasperation.
“Your…” Astoria made a vague gesture. “Countenance. About the war.”
“What?” Draco asked, though it came out a whisper. Any louder, and he was sure something would shatter.
Malfoy didn't even stop to shoot Harry a scathing look, though his voice very much made up for it. "Oh, pardon me. You see,
, which was how Draco knew Baddock thought the situation was dire indeed.
He wonders if an
Greg didn’t say anything for so long that Draco figured it was better to save face and get the fuck out of the common room. It wasn’t like he had a better way to follow up what was, horrifyingly, threatening to spill over: that he wanted to do better, or be better, even if he had no idea what that was meant to look like.
Draco had been halfway across the lawn, heading towards the lake, when Potter accosted him out of seemingly nowhere, without a Granger or Weasley within sight. He eyed Potter distrustfully, wondering if Potter planned this uninterrupted ambush and if he’d been carrying the wand since they last met near the kitchens, or if he’d been carrying it since before then.
Draco thought about his mother, lying to the Dark Lord; his father, charging into battle without a wand just to look for him. It was as unfathomable as it had been that first morning, but it had been real. It had been more than Draco knew what to do with.
Standing shoulder to shoulder with him as they stared at Harry’s bed proved a different and unpleasant sort of distracting. He was overly aware of Malfoy’s damp hair, and his bare feet, and the warmth radiating off of his body. He was just so
Harry, still standing, thought about this. "McGonagall didn't say the fire reached the dorms," he pointed out.
Not that Malfoy would mind it. Harry’s pretty sure that Malfoy finds it personally offensive if Harry doesn’t accidentally get caught staring at him at least once a day.
But Potter—he didn’t smile. It was too tense to be a smile. It was something that lightened his face nevertheless, and made him look less haunted. Younger.
Harry drops his gaze back to the map, to watch the tight circle Malfoy’s dot makes in his dorm room. His fingers tremble against the aged parchment, and he has to let go to ensure he doesn’t accidentally rip it.
“Well I haven’t seen you to ask about it,” Potter answered, accusing. He’d dropped his voice, but not by much, and Draco cast a hasty silencing charm when he saw Theo’s head tilt in their direction again.
"Potter," Malfoy said. He sounded very tired, suddenly, but the kind of tired that proceeded one making bad, jinx-related decisions rather than falling asleep. "Shut up and get in bed."
Then her gaze cut over to Draco, so intensely assessing that Draco curled his fingers around his wand. But she only said, “Glad to see you’re not a total tit, Malfoy. I thought Harry had finally gone barmy.”
Harry gave Malfoy a suspicious side-long look, but Malfoy was still staring upwards. Soft greens and yellows painted his profile as the wispy orbs floated overtop them, caught by the gentle breeze.
“No,” Draco said, realizing why they were waiting for them. He pointed at the both of them, then at Baddock, for instigating, and then at Queensbury, for not putting a stop to it. Draco said again, “No.”
try to expel you.”
Draco stood apart, suspended, remembering the return to the Manor after the Battle. How he’d said, “They’ll all come back here,” as he and his parents listened to more pops of apparition, more crackles of wandfire.
Harry adds a postscript:
Hermione gave him a funny look. “What do you mean?”
. It was arrogance, he thought distantly. He would have to add it to his list of affirmations, but there were so many now. He’d have to write them out. He’d have to keep a list on him, at all times, just to ensure he never forgot.
Harry’s first, far-away thought is that it makes a second person his age that has cast an Unforgivable. Him and Malfoy, alike again in the oddest of unwanted, juxtaposed ways.
, never returned, were swept off his desk and opened to the articles Baddock had helpfully highlighted with a charm.
“Would you like to know,” Draco asked, addressing the side of the room that did not understand why Draco wanted to claw the skin off his left forearm, “what the world the Dark Lord envisioned was like?”
