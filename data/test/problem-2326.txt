“Yeah,” Harry said, and cleared his throat. He glanced over at Draco (his face impassive as always) before addressing the group. “I’ve been doing really well lately. It’s er – been a good week.”
“Nothing,” Draco said back quietly. He turned his head to meet Harry’s steady gaze, the one that made Draco feel braver. “I’m going to miss sleeping next to you, even if you are like a furnace.”
"I bet you wish you'd stayed with me now. Cos if you had, your life would be so much easier."
Draco shuddered and Harry twirled his tongue around Draco’s cock, running it up and down the length of it. He slid his hands up and down Draco’s thighs, pausing to grip his arse, causing Draco to make a little noise again. He looked up into Draco’s dark eyes, who exhaled shakily and grabbed Harry’s hair.
Harry’s hand fell back down to his side. It was only then that Draco realized he was half-hard, his erection pushing uncomfortably against his trousers. He flushed and hoped Harry didn’t notice.
“I don’t think a drunken conversation makes up for years of trying to kill each other.”
Draco remained unchanged by the words and simply pushed his hair back and bit his lip; Harry’s heart threatened to burst with how cute the sight was.
He felt Harry come closer, his body heat coming off him in waves. Draco shuddered, remembering how Harry was his own personal furnace during the cold nights. He would have to get used to sleeping alone again.
Ginny came into the kitchen as Harry bent back up, his heart rate increasing monumentally. Merlin, he
Harry cringed at the nickname but otherwise ignored it. “Only with Ginny.”
He looked at Draco for a moment longer, that strange expression still on his face, before he turned and walked away.
“It’s morally wrong,” Draco explained, answering Ira’s silent question. “I’ve a duty to heal him and nothing more. It would be wrong to take advantage of him.”
“What are you laughing at?”
There was a sound of a door opening, and Harry glanced over a moment, bored. He quickly did a double-take, however, because he could hardly believe what he was seeing.
“No, mate, we’re the ones who are sorry,” Ron said lowly.
He didn’t have a chance to say anything else before both men heard someone call Draco’s name and the door creak open.
“Yes, Malfoy?”
Ginny walked closer to him, her brown eyes looking him up and down carefully.
But no, scrawled carefully on the parchment was the following;
“Yeah,” Harry said, clearly relieved. He led the way, opening the door and letting Draco pass through. “After you.”
“Morning,” Harry said, anxiety tying his chest up in knots.
Potter ignored him. “I’m just relieved to know I’m not the only one who feels this way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
close and Harry burned with wanting to finally touch him grab him kiss him –
Harry gave him an understanding grimace. “They’re good people. Just still stuck in the mindset. Hannah’s mother…”
“Thanks, Ginny,” he said softly, surprised to see that he was actually moved.
“No, tell me, Malfoy,” Harry said, leaning forwards in his seat a bit. “Why’d you scoff?”
“You may want to,” Wolff advised. “Honesty is essential to recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. They would most likely feel appreciative and reassured by your telling the truth, and some of your guilt may be alleviated. Regardless, I find it very hard to believe that Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley believe that you are undeserving of their friendship.”
"I suppose I should introduce myself," she said. "As I said, I am Doctor Wolff. I am a licensed psychiatrist and Mind-Healer in both Germany and England. I was born and raised in Köln and came to London in the mid-90s. I am also a Squib, if you were curious to know."
"If you still want to know...you can read this. I know it won't make much sense, but I can't…"
Draco glanced nervously at Granger and Weasley. They were talking amongst themselves, heads bent towards each other. Potter saw him looking, and Draco couldn’t hide the worry on his face.
“Yes you do.”
Harry nodded. “Lunch is still fine.”
Students who currently walked these halls had tortured younger students not so long ago – Draco included. And
Head pounding, Harry groaned. Maybe he
“Yeah.” He sat himself up and asked her, “What is it?”
“His head. I think he turned it a bit,” Draco said hesitantly. “He might have made a noise, too.”
“Did you see Blaise leave? Or Weasley? Because they’re both gone.”
He was embarrassed all over again and suddenly wanted to move on from the subject.
“For all I know you might have.”
Harry pulled Draco down on top of him easily; Draco gave a devious smirk as he let Harry force him down. He made himself comfortable, his lean body straddling Harry’s own, grinding against Harry’s hips and throbbing cock. Their kissing grew more heated, Harry grabbing Draco’s tight arse hard and Draco just grinding harder.
The owl fluttered its wings and took off through Draco’s window, leaving him to lean back in his chair and contemplate further.
Only Blaise sat next to him now. Pansy, too, had returned to Hogwarts, but she didn’t make it into Potions after the OWLs. Blaise was seated next to Draco, gazing at nothing in particular with a bored expression on his handsome face. Draco figured bored was better than anxious, which is what Draco was. Extremely anxious.
about eating. He isn’t the most pleasant houseguest, if you can imagine.” Draco hesitated. “It never came back, and I – I don’t mind. You said you know about being hungry, Potter, so you must know how it feels like when you’re starving. You know when you feel disconnected from reality, like you’re not even controlling your body. You’re not so…present.”
He imagined what their faces would look like if they found out. As if being a mental Death Eater wasn’t enough, he was also…
Harry Apparated to the outside of the Muggle pub they frequented – “they” being some variation of the old members of Dumbledore’s Army (something that felt like ancient history to Harry). They tried to meet up once a month; attendance had been higher immediately after the war. Over the years, only a few of them continued to come regularly.
“I love you too,” Harry said quietly as they parted, though Hermione kept a hand on his arm. “And you’re not useless. None of this is your fault.”
“Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger,” Mitchell said kindly, stepping forward a bit. “I’d just like to assure you that we’ll treat Mr. Potter to the very best of our abilities. I oversee the Plant and Potions department, and I ensure it is only staffed by the very best. I am Scarlett Mitchell, and Healer Malfoy here is the head of the Strife Feirold Ward. Though it seems you may already be acquainted…?”
“Oh, Dad has one of those somewhere. It’s supposed to do something, right? Not just sit there?”
“Come on. Group hug,” Hermione said, and when the boys didn’t move, she said again sternly, “Group hug.”
“Yes. He can be open; he just prefers to put his job first.”
They laid there a few minutes, staring at the stars above them and listening to each other breathe.
“Well, either way,” Pansy said, who was not entirely satisfied by the look of her face, “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself. You deserve some fun.”
“Could you consider letting me kiss you instead?” Harry asked, his voice hoarse as he searched Draco’s face for a clue.
“Do you have a headache?”
He thought about how Harry had told Granger and Weasley about…nearly everything, and how they had apparently reacted well. But he still couldn’t imagine telling Pansy all of his personal business. He could still barely say the words, “I’m gay” out loud. Some part of him figured that she knew already, but he was still terrified of how she’d react.
Her words were nonsense, bouncing off him. He’d heard variations of these words so many times before, but he never believed them. He nodded anyway.
Draco couldn’t even revel in the fact that Potter had broken his own rules and called him ‘Draco.’ He was barely listening to Potter. He couldn’t, not with his heart hammering in his chest and his stomach rolling.
Draco complied, and Harry said more nonsense.
Potter’s arms were crossed in front of his chest defensively. "I'm sorry too. You told me to leave you alone and I didn't. I should have respected your boundaries."
He was covered in a cold sweat and his heart was thudding loudly in his chest. Draco rubbed at his eyes a touch too aggressively, trying to make sense of his dream. They were hardly ever as vivid as that, and when they were, they veered more into nightmare territory.
back to normal. Maybe none of us have actually forgotten all about it, like we thought. The others might just be better at hiding it than we are. The war’s affected all of us in different ways, but Draco, you can’t think you’re inherently bad. You were pushed, like everyone else.”
“He spent the night,” Harry said, his face flushing as he thought back to those three blissful days. “Several nights. We talked…and…yeah.”
“D’you wanna go out for a couple of drinks for Sam’s birthday?”
When they’d left an hour later, Draco had finished a bowl of soup and had even poked a bit at some steamed vegetables and chicken. When he’d first taken a bite of the chicken, Potter looked at Draco like he’d hung the moon, which was frankly quite ridiculous since
"Just calming stuff. It’s all in my file, I reckon."
“What?”
"I know,” Harry said. He chewed on his lip before turning his gaze back to Malfoy. “I'm fine, I promise. I'm not nauseated or anything. Just a little headache."
“I – yes.” Malfoy hesitated. “I understand. I’m sorry as well.”
Me: Doesn't do anything about it
Draco half-heartedly raised his own and drank what must have been at least equal to a shot. He shuddered and coughed weakly. The rest of the Scotch seemed to be taunting him.
, so I’d just rather leave them to it.”
"Can I," Draco ground out, "Slap you, Potter?"
“That’s because I was already drunk,” Harry pointed out.
“I suppose that’s a fair point,” Draco conceded.
“Hmm?” Harry hummed and looked up at him, his lips swollen.
A smoke. That’s what he needed.
“What do
“To group,” Samuel grinned.
“Nothing.”
to gossip. The person in question was fixing themselves a cup of tea, using the leftover water in the kettle.
“I can handle it,” Harry said. “Just – please, Draco.”
He checked his watch. With a start, he realized he was fifteen minutes late. It’d taken him longer than he expected to summon the energy to get up from the couch and find clean clothes.
“Oh, so you’re saying now that the War is over, I can go back to my regular, normal,
“Ira,” Draco greeted.
“You’re so brave,” Draco said softly. Harry buried his face in Draco’s shoulder; Draco thought he might have shaken his head. “I can’t – I can’t even begin to imagine what you’ve gone through, but I’m so glad you’re here. Alive. You’re a
. If Harry was planning on keeping this up all throughout dinner, he didn’t know if he could survive. It’d been ages since he’d been shagged – the last time having been Leo – and he was already feeling antsy.
Draco followed his gaze and noticed some younger students glancing at them curiously as they walked past. Still nobody that looked like the culprit. He then realized Potter was alone.
“I have to pry it out of him,” Estrada admitted. “He hasn’t told me
Draco hardly dared to breathe, and he suddenly wished he was sober for this.
“Merlin, you’ve got it bad, don’t you?” she teased.
“Please shut up,” Harry said loudly, causing the three of them to stop talking and look at him with varying degrees of indignation. “I deserved that, alright? Thanks for the concern, Draco, and Ron, I’m still annoyed at you. And I’m fine, Hermione, I just feel like a right idiot. Where’s Ginny?”
“That’s true.”
“Sod off, Potter,” he said without any real venom.
“It…” Harry trailed off without having said anything. There had to be a line somewhere, right? His face warmed as he said as firmly as he could, “I’d rather not say.”
Draco felt like he could breathe for the first time since waking.
“We’ve a few things to do before you’re to be discharged.”
Draco had been coerced into taking a shot of that with Potter (and by Potter), and at the time, he’d hated it, but now…everything was hazy in a most pleasant way.
Harry sighed, vaguely relieved that he had gotten here. Although he didn’t remember much of the past few days, he did remember that he had really wanted (needed?) to get to St Mungo’s.
Draco Apparated outside of the Dotted Lamb at 7:58 and was wondering if he should head inside and get a table for all of them when Blaise and Ginevra appeared. They caught sight of each other quickly and congregated in a small circle.
Draco reached across the table for Harry's hand, and Harry let him take it. Draco curled his fingers around it, and Harry felt as if Draco's serenity was spreading through Harry's body. He took a deep breath and gazed evenly into Draco’s eyes.
Draco let out a short laugh. “If I...of course I want to.”
"Yes," Draco said, trying not to roll his eyes.
“Well,
“Yeah, I’m good.”
“I promise you both that I’ll do everything I can to make sure Potter’s alright.”
He did. He flushed; he didn’t know Potter had seen that. Draco nodded, wanting to get to the point.
“Is it true? Harry Potter’s here?” Ira asked calmly.
Harry worried his bottom lip, feeling guilty.
“This has happened before?”
know that you two dating was the most exciting thing to happen to St. Mungo’s staff. Most likely in the entire history of this fine establishment.”
“I’m certain you’re not referring to a perfectly innocent dream by the way your face has changed shades in just a minute’s time,” Ira said, slipping into the chair across from Draco’s with their tea, making Draco’s face even hotter. They bobbed their tea bag up and down, their pale eyes trained on it. “So my answer is no. You know I don’t see many patients anyway.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Ginny told him. “I’ll find it for you, and then you can take a stroll outside ‘round Muggle London.”
“You alright there, Potter?” Draco asked as he sat up.
“I hate you,” Harry told him, but it was hard to believe him when his breathing had picked up and his green eyes got just a little bit darker.
Where he expected to see the Dark Mark was instead a somehow delicate piece of art all in black and greys. Trees sprouted from a graceful transition of unmarked skin to a forest floor. The trees were of various heights and widths, all beautiful and elegant. In the middle of them all was the Dark Mark – it was faded compared to the fresh ink, but somehow, that made it even better. The branches and leaves seemed to move along the skull and snake, making it both the focal point and the background at once.
Should he? Harry hadn't even begun to wrap his head around it himself, and he wasn't sure if he could manage to talk about it without making something explode.
Falling back asleep was nearly impossible, so he figured he would take advantage of the quiet campus and take a walk after the fourth wakening. In his tired state, he found himself out by the Black Lake. He’d always been fond of it, but it took on a different, almost ethereal quality in the early morning.
How could Harry make him so stupid? Ever since they were children, Harry’s always incited such a visceral reaction within him, making him lose all common sense.
Out of all the things that had knocked Draco off balance that day, Harry Potter smiling at him might’ve been the most disarming.
But maybe Draco was looking at it all wrong. Maybe Draco had nothing to do with Potter’s change in mood. He
Harry finished off his drink; the last sip of it stung a bit.
“I’m glad your standards were that low,” Draco said, “Because if they weren’t, I’m not sure we could have.”
Harry laughed. He held out his arms and Draco saw what he was holding – a cup carrier with two to-go coffees and a paper bag which must have held pastries. “Could you just grab these? I want to take off my coat.”
They didn’t bother with the Invisibility Cloak this time. It was one of the last Saturday afternoons anyway, and students were either busy revising in the library or outside, ignoring the upcoming exams. Still, the prospect of being found out made Draco feel rather reckless.
His heart thudded in his ears. He wondered if Harry could hear it in the quiet of the night.
“What is this about, then?”
“Ready?”
the end of the week. It was the last thing he needed to do before leaving – the final obstacle. He wondered if he could push through without one final cup of coffee, and decided that yes, he could.
Malfoy looked pointedly at him. “
Blaise stood there with Ginny Weasley by his side. He was looking quite pleased with himself, considering he’d called her a blood traitor just a few short years ago. Weasley, however, wore a scowl on her face, clearly only there to appease Blaise.
“Come home with me afterwards?”
"Not really," Harry admitted.
when I was older helped me understand. Seeing him again made me realize it all at once, like
“I think I just want to…be alone for a bit,” Harry said when he’d made up his mind.
“Typical,” Draco said, and pulled those off too.
“You don’t understand,” Draco said. He felt childish even as he said it, but it was true. Harry
“Fine. You’ll just have something to look forward to when we get back, won’t you?”
Ron nodded, looking thoughtful as he levitated a clean dish back into the cabinet.
Draco sniffed with dignity and held onto Harry tighter. “It’s none of your concern.”
“You can’t just ask things like that and then drop it! If you don’t like the fact that I’m gay, then just say it,” Draco demanded, feeling his face go hot.
“I just know him, Mr. Potter,” he said softly. “He’s changed in the nearly two years I’ve known him. He cares about his patients, about his friends, his family. He’s become so much more compassionate; Draco’s always been an amazing Healer, but now he’s even better because he puts everything into helping his patients. Including you.”
“No!”
“Haven’t been pissed in a while,” he answered truthfully. He’d already divulged his deepest, darkest secrets to Malfoy – what was a small truth?
“Good. I would have kept coming anyway.”
They spent another forty-five minutes talking, people going around at random to talk about their week.
"I suppose, but I still live by myself. They can't be with me all the time."
Blaise raised two fingers. Pansy watched the both of them, a smile on her face.
"Harry!" she exclaimed, scandalized. “Merlin, I don’t even know what to say! Or ask. Ok…um…d’you actually know their name?”
“Budge over, you traitor,” Harry grumbled. He nodded his head at the CSI rerun playing on the TV. “Is this what was so important you had to leave me alone with Malfoy?”
“Get help!” Potter nearly bellowed, throwing an arm out angrily. Draco’s head throbbed. “Talk about it seriously to someone! It doesn’t even have to be me, it could be bloody Parkinson or Greengrass or your mother – just –“
“Can you still?”
Harry nodded once more and laid back down, the entire back of his shirt soaked in sweat. He really needed Ginny to bring him another change of clothes.
Draco seemed halfway between rolling his eyes and yelling at Harry.
"Where did you walk from?"
will be here. Hermione’s going to her parents’ home for the first bit, and then she’s going to spend the rest of the time at the Burrow.”
, and then the feast began.
“Thanks,” he mumbled, his ears redder than before.
Leonel looked at him knowingly and sighed. “You’ve thought about it, haven’t you? I’m guessing it’s a no.”
He jumped as he heard the door swing open; Harry turned and looked Malfoy straight in the eyes. They stared at each other, silent, the background noise of the pub halting the need for speech. But then the door was closed again, and it was just the two of them in the bathroom.
He dropped down onto his bed. Crossing his arms, he looked Pansy square in the eye. She was still standing and staring down at him.
Wolff was now taking notes in small notepad with a Muggle pen, he noted with interest.
He stared up at his own reflection, feeling a disconnect between it and himself. Like he wasn’t real. His gaze dropped to his pale forearm and the dark, angry mark on it. He was so used to avoiding it, averting his own gaze, but now he just stared, unfeeling.
“Good to see you, Zabini,” Astoria offered charitably.
Draco found Pansy with ease after Blaise had pointed him in the right direction. True to his word, Pansy was revising in the library with Padma Patil. He approached her with crossed arms.
Cait nodded.
“Good evening!”
He did.
“Potter.”
He looked at her through teary eyes and found he couldn’t speak.
"Would you like to tell me a bit about yourself?"
“What is it with British guys and being so
Lessons dragged on as they always did, bleeding seamlessly together in Draco’s mind.
“It’s his loss,” Daphne rolled her eyes. “And I don’t really see it lasting long anyway. You couldn’t pay me to consort with a Gryffindor.”
“Draco, I sincerely want to slap you right now,” Pansy was telling him.
“I don’t – “ He stopped, then started again. “Er, I just, this is going to sound stupid, but I guess I never really had the chance to figure out what I
“A massive one – and to hear you say that you
“Isn’t that the pot calling the kettle black or whatever?”
Potter was, he could now witness it himself. And, well, that led to all this.
“It’s none of your business,” Draco said, feeling his brows furrow.
Draco nodded.
“Brilliant! I love it! What happened next?”
Harry was struggling to stay upright; the stabbing pains in the back of his head also made it hard to focus.
Harry didn’t like the sound of that, and Wolff gave an apologetic look.
“You can touch it. Here,” Potter said, extending it even further.
Also while you read this please remember that Draco/Harry is endgame alright? It'll all be fine, I promise.
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco snapped, standing up. Potter’s gaze followed him. “What do you know about anything –“
Harry looked relieved.
Harry went on.
“Stop leering at me,” he told him, and interestingly enough, Potter became flustered and stood up, stepping back and away from Draco.
"Don't make that face," said Draco. "The mistakes I made are mine and mine alone. I'm the one who made a mess of my life."
Harry gave a light scoff.
Being friends with Harry Potter was strange.
A few seconds later, Draco was brushing himself off in Wolff's beige office. Julia Wolff sat at her desk, a calm, welcoming expression on her distinctly Germanic face. She smiled at Draco.
“Yes, darling,” she told Rose kindly. “Alright, I’ll leave you boys to it. I’m sure you still have so much to do.”
it. But me.” Draco’s hand trembled as he took a drag. “I was on the wrong fucking side. I was on
“Are you happy?”
Draco shrugged. “An unfortunate consequence of the Dark Lord taking up residence in my home, I suppose.”
Draco paused. “He did seem rather…irritated this morning, but his mood improved considerably once we’d begun talking about his discharge. By the time Ginevra Weasley arrived and he got his wand back, he seemed to be in good spirits.”
“Better,” Draco said, meeting Potter’s angry eyes. “I’m satisfied with how you’re progressing.”
“Would you prefer it if I made ugly jokes? Cos I can do that too.”
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Potter said good-naturedly, and began piling one of the plates with food. Halfway through, he looked up at Draco and nodded his head towards the plate in front of Draco. “Go on. Take whatever you can handle.”
“Course we want to,” Damien said, rolling his eyes. “Wouldn’t have asked if we didn’t.”
“But it’s not just the nightmares, is it?” Draco asked quietly. “You’ve mentioned other things. The – the abuse. Why it didn’t work with Ginny Weasley. And I remember…you said something about how you can’t get what happened out of your head. Like – you can’t forget.”
His gaze was on Potter even as he said Weasley’s name. His expression was closed off like it usually was – but perhaps a bit strained? Like something was bubbling just beneath the surface. He had said that Weasley wasn’t his girlfriend, but for all Draco knew, he could have been lying. What for, he had no idea, but it was still a possibility.
“Hermione likes it though,” Harry added thoughtfully.
“Hasn’t done anything wrong?” Pansy repeated with a scoff. “Don’t make me laugh. Your entire relationship was built on him wronging you.”
“Leave?” Malfoy repeated incredulously. “You need to stay here for two days at the very least, so we can finish treating you. Potter, I don’t think you understand how grave this situation is.”
Draco nodded. He stuck his free hand in his pocket; he felt like a fool for not having gloves or a hat or a scarf or anything else a normal person would have in this weather.
Hermione looked at Harry with something like pain on her face. Ron’s arms were dangling by his sides, as if he were unsure of what to do with them.
“Oh, I’ve waited so long for this,” Harry breathed, eyes fluttering closed as he leaned his head back against the pillow.
Harry shook his head. “My parents died when I was young. My aunt and uncle took care of me.”
Draco lifted his head and turned. Potter was standing there, looking impossibly handsome in his school robes.
"It's nearly noon," Potter responded without humor. "Did you really just wake up?"
“Wow,” Harry marveled, this fact slowly sinking in. “Wow.”
“You’re
“I bloody well hope so. It’s been a year.”
Draco watched as Potter sat in a chair, his shoulders tense, and something like affection tugged at Draco’s heart. He shook it off and returned to his task of making drinks.
“I,” Draco paused for a beat, licking his lips, “Might be considering it.”
“Mate, that’s exactly what we want for you,” Ron said.
“Then go.”
“Do you think they’d let you go outside?” asked Ginny softly after minutes of silence, their slow breaths the only sounds in the room.
“You don’t know that,” he said just as softly. “You’re still adjusting to – to everything and the feelings you have might not be real. And I know I’m not your Healer anymore, but it was only a few weeks ago that I had power and authority over you, and the power balance is still…”
Draco scoffed. “What do you mean, ‘still’? You
Malfoy’s cheeks were pink from the cold (he must have come in just before Harry), and he was wrapped up in a dark green scarf, because apparently, some things never changed. His thin, white fingers were gripping a Styrofoam cup of coffee in his lap. He looked tense, sitting rigidly in his chair as he stared a bit too intensely at nothing in particular.
“There could be – ah, people in the complex across from us,” Harry panted.
“Weasley!”
, and then his fingers slipped through Draco’s fine hair and began
, but you don’t have that sort of sway with me.”
Draco dropped his eyes down to his food, their exchange once again reminding Draco just how much Potter’s situation was impacting everyone close to him.
“Of course we are,” Harry cut in with a small smile. “Do you think I do this with all my friends?”
“Good. I’m taking this,” Draco said a second before claiming Leonel’s notepad.
“You had the final say – still do. Doesn’t really matter what anyone else does.”
Macmillan and Abbott both stared at Draco and Harry, the former squirming under their strange, Hufflepuff gaze.
She was talking quickly as she usually did when she was nervous.
Where would he even begin? How he wanted to relapse? How he’d been feeling a sense of doom for the past four days? How his heart was simultaneously heavy and pounding so loudly, so relentlessly, that Harry found it hard to focus? How he heard Malfoy and another Healer talk about fucking at their workplace? How that made Harry have a minor panic attack?
“I didn’t know why I thought that was going to work.”
“Merlin, you’re difficult. Come on,” Draco said, and he pulled Harry up.
“Your life isn’t exactly conventional, Harry.”
noise and rolled over onto his side, knocking Potter’s hand away. When his body lurched violently the second time, Draco began panicking and sat up quickly, ignoring the fiercely spinning room.
“Potter, how are you doing?” Draco asked, his voice perfectly professional, though he could tell his forehead was probably pinched.
Harry let out a watery laugh and nodded. "That's fair."
“Which means we can continue."
“I won’t buy any more drinks or potions, and I’ll bin the ones I have at home. If you don’t believe me, you can come over and do it yourselves,” Harry replied.
What the fuck kind of question was that? Potter wasn’t a bloody Mind Healer. He wasn’t even Draco’s friend. What right did he have to ask Draco that?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, bugger,” said Draco before stomping off he retrieve his wand.
Harry took Draco’s hand; Draco felt his face heat up immediately.
Ron relaxed back in his chair. "Good. Store's doing well. We're going to see my Mum and Dad after this."
Draco frowned and chose to focus on the walls instead of Leo.
"Really, Draco, you thought I'd go to the press? Who do you think I am? Someone who hasn't been attacked themselves by the media for over a bloody decade?"
“I’ve thought about it.” Harry removed his gaze from Malfoy and instead stared down at the card that sat on the bed beside him. “I think – I’ll go.”
– Harry, what the
“I’m dating Luna,” Ginny suddenly yelled, brown eyes wide as she stared at Harry, then Luna, then back at Harry.
“Lie down,” the voice said again. “You’re safe.”
“Mental, your lot. Completely mental. Who thinks it’s acceptable to just barge into somebody’s home unannounced? And then
Potter’s eyes flashed dangerously. Draco knew he had taken a gamble in calling Potter a coward, but Ginevra had told him to keep pushing him until he broke. Potter took a shaky breath and then, as Draco watched with his heart in his throat, he stood and took two steps towards Draco, who had to force himself not to back away. Standing his ground, he met Potter’s gaze and held it.
He glanced at Draco, who was still sitting there, unsure. Harry walked over, putting his palm over Draco’s cheek, smiling as Draco looked up.
Harry did. Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but he might have felt a little calmer.
“Thank you,” Harry said, clearly relieved. “So, what homework were you doing?”
"Where's your bedroom?" Draco asked, his voice low and possessive and sending shivers up Harry's spine.
“SPEW,” answered Harry irritably. “And what about it?”
“Lovely couple,” Molly had said, wiping away a few tears. “I’m so glad my children are finding love.”
As soon as Harry had arrived back to his flat, he’d yelled out Ginny’s name. She looked up from where she was lounging on the sofa, apparently watching telly and helping herself to Harry’s biscuits.
“Fuck, Malfoy, it’s just,” Potter said, speaking as if that moment didn’t just happen, “It makes me so mad that we’re back here but people don’t even care – they don’t care, Malfoy! They’re just going about their lives and I can’t. I keep remembering everything and I can’t get it out of my head, it all comes back. You know what I mean?”
“I mean, it was just like the past two weeks, really,” Harry said. “I spend time with Ginny at home, mostly.”
Harry glanced down at Draco, whose flushed face was squished against his chest.
Draco felt nauseated all over again at the thought of Potter carrying him around Hogwarts like a gigantic prat. He huffed out a short breath before taking hold of his bag and standing up slowly. He got light-headed all over again and Draco had to pause a second before looking at Potter.
“That’s alright. You’ve got loads of time,” said Hermione reassuringly.
She nodded and walked away. Harry took another deep breath, then went over to Malfoy.
around. No need to hide the fact that he was, in fact,
He looked up, Harry’s cock still in his mouth, and Harry was panting, his eyes unfocused.
Leonel stood and stripped, revealing defined abs and strong biceps. Draco watched him with hungry eyes, taking in every inch of Leonel’s body as he kicked off his trousers. God, and of
It seemed Ron had wasted no time in starting to drink.
“Haven’t you heard? He has to do with everything,” Draco scowled. She was still staring incredulously at him, so he explained, “He thought I was guilty, which to be fair, I
if you haven’t already, and if we can’t find out what it is with that, I’ll have one of you go to the Auror Department and find out what cases they were working on. And interview his partner again, just in case.”
Draco had left shortly after that, pulling on his clothes and saying that he had work the next morning. Harry watched him go, then laid in bed and stared up at the ceiling, his head still spinning from all that had happened.
"And yours isn't either?" Draco challenged.
As he sat there, breathing in the smoke evenly, he congratulated himself on remembering to dress appropriately. He wore gloves and Harry’s Gryffindor scarf, which he kept “forgetting” to return. He’d hidden the scarf beneath his robes while in the library and the Hall; he didn’t know what people would make of him wearing a Gryffindor scarf.
“Er, sorry,” Harry said meekly. So it was true. Malfoy’s gay. “I mean – er, if it helps – I like blokes too. And birds. And everyone.”
long, I’ve actually forgotten what it feels like to be happy. But Draco’s made me remember. I actually…want to live. I can picture myself alive in a few years. For once.”
Draco gave a humorless laugh.
“I’ll - “ Draco thought quickly, “I’ll never speak to you again if you tell her about this. You’d be dead to me.”
“I’m not really sure,” Harry said, his voice slightly muffled. “I mean, I was obsessed with you during sixth year, and I think your, er, appearance might’ve been part of that. But there’d been people before you…but I think what really did it was seeing Charlie during the summer. I’d met him before, but then…revisiting that feeling of
“You can’t force me,” Draco said crossly, feeling his cheeks warm when he realized just how childish he must have sounded.
"Is that why you're not wearing robes either?"
Draco simply frowned. "But how?"
Wolff blinked – it was the first time he’d seen her even a little surprised – but collected herself quickly.
didn’t do anything,” Potter said, the annoyance unmistakable in his tone. “Wizarding Britain can blame its heartbreak on Ron and Hermione. They’re the ones who are too busy for my nonsense.”
The passion in Harry’s eyes, his face, his voice was startling, mainly because it’d been so long since Draco had seen it. It was an almost everyday occurrence back at Hogwarts, him getting fired up about something, anything. It made Draco sick to his stomach – how could someone possibly
“I don’t think I’ve been this clear-headed in a long time…and I had my first appointment with a Mind Healer today and it made me realize what I was missing out on. And how I’ve been hurting you all and I’m just tired of it. I still
“Er…”
“Yeah.”
“They are. I couldn’t - I honestly wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for them.”
After lunch, Draco was dragged along to the library by Pansy, and the two of them were accompanied by the Greengrasses. This was clearly a thinly veiled attempt to keep Draco within her sight after they’d eaten, and Draco begrudgingly let it happen. He’d skip dinner to make up for it.
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
Draco looked at him in shock. He felt excitement and nerves all at once, but Harry seemed more distraught than anything.
“I can’t find my cigarettes,” Draco said, frowning. “I always have them in my pocket.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, seemingly relieved that he remembered. Draco was perplexed – he hadn’t seen Harry this nervous in ages, if ever. “So I wasn’t just curious. I mean, I was, but for, er, anyway, what I’m trying to say is I-think-I-like-blokes.”
“Is now a good time?”
“Good morning, Draco,” said Ira, smiling up at him. “We were just talking about you and Leonel.”
“You might feel better after punching Draco,” Potter said. When Granger tensed, he added quickly, “I’m kidding. No one’s punching anyone. We’re all adults, and the past is in the past, as you like to say.”
Harry leaned close again, his full lips still pulled into a smirk. “I dunno, Malfoy. Maybe I’m still figuring it out.”
about this.
Harry gave an uncomfortable laugh. Merlin, he was a rubbish friend, having sex in the loo when he was supposed to be celebrating his friend’s birthday. Wasn’t it Harry who said that the night was about Samuel, not him or Draco?
He shook him a little harder. It proved unnecessary, however, because a moment later, Weasley called out, making Draco jump.
"Fucking Pansy," Draco growled underneath his breath.
“More work for you,” Ron shrugged.
Potter’s voice became distant, sounding echoey even though Draco knew very well that the man was standing right in front of him. His eyesight dimmed, became overpowered by dark dots, and then everything was black.
Damien laughed and shook his head. “If she does, she’s in for a disappointment. That bloke’s clearly gay.”
"First step is acceptance," grumbled Draco. "I'm mentally ill, you're mentally ill...and there's no reason to be ashamed of it."
Harry opened his eyes and looked up into the face of a kind-faced white woman. He scrambled up, dusting the ash off himself.
But usually, he’d sleep at infrequent intervals, read old paperbacks, and talk to Ron and Hermione when they had time.
Harry took a deep breath.
Draco’s blood ran cold.
Draco gave him a quizzical look. “Do you think I’d be here if it wasn’t?”
“Your heart rate is a bit high as well,” Estrada said, scribbling as he spoke. “Have you been anxious?”
Draco was horrified; there was no other word for it.
Harry suddenly whipped the curtain open and got out of bed. Draco watched as he started pacing, half-naked with only boxers on. He hoped the rest of the Gryffindors were still asleep and would stay that way.
“Yeah, you too.”
“Thank you, Potter,” said McGonagall seriously.
Putting on her best Malfoy impression, Ginny read the letter aloud. Harry begrudgingly noted that her impersonation was really quite good, but he didn’t say so; he simply took the letter back from her. Ginny looked at him, brown eyes glittering.
Harry nodded, and her smile stretched even further. Kathy left, probably to make friendly conversation with the people standing by the food table.
Draco shifted again –
They glared at each other for a few more minutes, the atmosphere in the room uncomfortably tense.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair. “It’s just – hard, I dunno –“
“How I died?” Harry asked shortly.
Halloween was approaching, and the cold was coming with it. It felt like the cold was settling even deeper in Draco’s bones.
Potter made an undignified yelping sound, a hand flying to the affected area, and glared down at Draco, who was currently resting his head against Potter’s shoulder. As much as Draco wanted to deny it, Potter made a very comfortable pillow, all warm and sturdy and smelling wonderful and Draco really was quite drunk, wasn’t he?
Harry rolled his eyes. “You wouldn’t be. C’mon. Let’s go.”
Leo raised his eyebrows and shrugged. "If you say so."
“Because I need them now. I
Draco shot him a dirty look but complied, slinking to the couch as Harry pushed the tape into the VCR determinedly. Once he pressed the ‘rewind’ button, Harry grabbed the remote before joining Draco on the couch, nearly jumping onto the cushion next to him. Draco glared at him again, and Harry grinned, unable to help himself.
Draco squirmed at the thought that he was focusing so much energy on one patient; he was a Healer, for Salazar’s sake. A patient is a patient, and patients should be treated equally.
“He’s not my boy,” Malfoy said firmly, but Cait was already walking away, disappearing into the crowd.
He savored the disconnect he felt between the world and him after purging. Like he was truly untouchable. Above it all. It was his second favorite thing about the activity, after the emptying itself.
“Thanks, Draco,” Samuel smiled. “Now come on, let’s go.”
He lifted his head to look at Harry, who was staring at the floor, furrowed brows above stormy eyes. Draco gazed at the same place, still feeling rather numb.
“What?” Harry asked, perplexed by Draco’s reaction.
“Fuck,” Draco hissed.
incredibly fit.
“Or maybe you just didn’t have a good taste in humor until now.”
He opened his eyes blearily and managed a croaky
“I – I don’t know,” Draco responded, his mouth dry.
“Sure.”
Harry pondered this for a moment before catching the attention of the bartender. He told him what he wanted, trying to keep eye contact with the tall man with perfect teeth, then turned back to Malfoy.
him. Harry Potter’s arms were actually wrapped around Draco, enclosing him with his body’s warmth and his indeterminable scent. Draco felt Potter’s chest move as he breathed against him, and slowly, hesitantly, he brought his arms up from his sides and hugged Potter back.
was doing that to him.
Harry nodded, though Ginny had broken Harry’s old phone and recruited Hermione’s help to buy him a new one his first day out of St. Mungo’s.
The damp ends of Harry’s hair were sticking in curls to his forehead, and his eyes were bright as he grinned at Draco. Draco flushed deeply.
“Blaise. It’s good to see you,” Draco said. “How’s New Zealand?”
“Don’t,” he said.
Leonel lowered the vial of clear liquid he was holding and narrowed his eyes. “What did?”
“Finished,” Draco announced proudly, looking down at the newly constructed bed.
but of course she did –”
Draco pulled back from the spot and moved onto another.
“What, that bloke's bent too?"
about how alcohol was nothing compared to dreamless sleep. So it’s fine.”
less.”
that he didn’t warm up to me like he did you and Draco.”
Potter shook his head.
Draco knew her mother was much too fragile to receive news that her son was starving himself. With his father in prison, she was all alone in the Manor with only the house elves to keep her company. She would be beside herself.
"We did sort of have a three-day sleepover where we had sex and did other intimate things, so, I think so?"
“Is it…did you…?”
“I mean – it’s fine. It doesn’t matter anymore. I’m out of their lives, they’re out of mine…”
“I was jealous!” Potter roared at him. His eyes were wild behind the glasses. “Happy, Malfoy? Is that what you wanted to hear?”
Draco put out the cigarette he was smoking (he didn’t think Potter liked it) and looked at him expectantly.
Ginevra smiled at them knowingly.
Lifting her wand, Betty concentrated and exclaimed, “
“How was that for everyone? I’d love to hear your thoughts.” Her voice was making its way back to its former chirpiness.
“I don’t think so,” he finally said, looking at Draco impassively.
“What is it you want, Leo?” he asked quietly, staring into Leo’s dark eyes as he did so.
“You’re something else, Potter,” Draco said quietly, “And I mean that in the best way possible.”
Draco nodded again tightly.
“You don’t need to-“
"Must you?" Draco replied, smirked as his eyes raked over Harry's body. He ran a finger over the scar on his chest, and Harry shivered.
Draco suppressed a groan. He hated himself.
Potter frowned, then paused. “I don’t know. You’re – you’re Malfoy.”
Draco left.
"Oh, get over it, Malfoy," Harry huffed. "I'm not fragile. If I said it's fine, then it's fine. I almost prefer you mean. My arse still stings, by the way."
"I can't have Apparated - even when I'm drunk or high I have enough sense to know it would end badly."
"It's no easy feat, Harry," Wolff said firmly, looking him square in the eye. "Addiction is a disease like any other. It will be fighting you every step of the way."
“That’s also a very intimate act, isn’t it?” Luna mused. “But you shouldn’t be ashamed of that, either.”
“That’s you,” Draco said, his hands on Harry’s chest again; he couldn’t stop touching him, like he needed to believe this was real.
He did so, and the four of them looked at the floating numbers in interest. Harry thought it was a rather silly method; he knew Muggles had equipment that’d keep the numbers up instead of floating away into nothingness.
“He’s already gone down to breakfast,” Blaise answered. He finished buttoning his shirt and summoned his necktie, catching it smoothly. “I wanted to ask you something.”
“No, Potter. I don’t – we don’t need to rehash anything. It wouldn’t do any good.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked him carefully.
“Yes,” he said quickly, handing his glass to Astoria. “Thank you.”
“No, I’m here on my own volition,” answered Astoria, taking a step forward. Her arms were crossed and her blonde hair fell to her chest in careful, loose waves. “Because I’m worried about you.”
“And then,” Harry continued, more nervous than before, “That day after Potions, when I tried to get you to talk to me-“
"Malfoy."
Harry blinked, genuinely surprised at both himself and Draco. He didn’t realize it before, but yes, he really did want to spend time with Draco, Ron, and Hermione as a group.
ran through his head for what felt like the thousandth time. “Excuse me, Samuel, I was wondering if I could have a word with Harry.”
Draco hesitantly ran a hand up Harry's arm; it felt good under the layer of cloth that covered it. He gripped onto his bicep, fingers curling into the muscle there. Harry nudged open Draco’s mouth with his own and slipped his tongue inside. A thrill ran through Draco’s body. No, he definitely couldn’t get tired of this.
“Fuck off.” Leo rolled his eyes. “I’m only two years younger than you.”
, Draco.”
“Oh, of course, dear,” Molly smiled. “I understand you’ve become quite important to Harry, and I must say, he
Salazar, she really wanted to do this. She really wanted to
They hadn’t spoken since their argument two nights before. Draco had tried and failed to get her alone to talk about what had happened; Pansy would leave if it was just the two of them anywhere, not even bothering to make up an excuse. They had sat next to each other in Defense against the Dark Arts, but otherwise, it was like he didn’t even exist.
“I don’t know, to be honest. I don’t know if someplace like that exists. I’ll have to think on it. Thank you.”
good paper.”
“Ah, no. I apologize,” Malfoy said insincerely, nodding infinitesimally at Harry.
“I’m just doing my job. There’s also something I wanted to discuss with you two,” he paused. “I was wondering if I could ask you some questions regarding Potter’s history with potions.”
family could live. I wasn’t fighting to save the world. I was hurting others to save myself.”
“Right back at you, mate,” Samuel said kindly, grinning widely. “You’re cool too, even if you’re…mysterious an’ all that.”
Harry stabbed at a sausage.
“But.” Potter’s shoulders drooped. He uncrossed his arms. “I – we saved each other – we helped each other. Doesn’t that mean anything?”
The party had died down considerably an hour later. Some had retired to bed alone, and others had left with companions. When Draco realized that Blaise and the youngest Weasley had disappeared around the same time, he blanched.
hungry, but he didn’t know if that was enough to override the panic and disgust and reluctance that was already taking over him.
Once again, the warm feeling in his chest was back and all sorts of stats appeared in the air.
every last bite of dinner Pansy had forced upon him.
Draco felt as if an enormous weight had disappeared off his shoulders. He nearly collapsed into Potter, holding onto him as if he were a lifeline, and Potter hugged him back. Draco buried his face into Potter’s warm shoulder and couldn’t help the enormous shaky sigh that left him.
“Come, Betty,” said Ira, standing and placing a hand on her shoulder. When she looked up at them with confusion, they said, “We’ll go get you another drink.”
“You saw what he looked like that first day. I’d seen him in bad shape before…several times, even. But before all this, he was never a real person to me. Just an annoying pain in the arse who was too famous for his own good. And now I’m learning something new about him every day and seeing that his life is
then? Like you need them now,” Draco countered, though not unkindly. “Did she ever try to – I know her brother…”
Draco was mad now. Potter’s surprise interrogation had sent him spiraling back to earth, back to reality.
Draco smiled gratefully at her, his savior. She smirked and walked away, no doubt on her way to the dungeons.
He wanted to take Draco’s hand in his, comfort him somehow, but he feared Draco’s reaction. His eyes flickered down at it, and Draco caught him; his face grew guarded.
He watched as Draco watched 12 Grimmauld Place appear. His lips parted, his eyes enraptured as finally the old house settled in between the two Muggle ones.
Harry paused, and said slowly, "When I had the means. It wasn't too, er, often."
“Yes, I’ve noticed there’s been a lot less of ‘wasted Potter pulls again’ in the papers,” Malfoy nodded.
“Yeah,” said Harry quietly.
"She's just worried about you."
"Ooh, touchy. Go on then, make your coffee and I'll meet you there."
“He’s
“That’s because it’s a new one,” a new voice said, and both Harry and Ginny snapped up to look at Blaise, who was entering the kitchen with just a towel wrapped around his slim waist. He lounged against the counter casually, amused eyes fixed on Ginny. “What was it last year, love? Didn’t run off the tongue as smoothly as this year’s.”
“I’m sorry.” His voice was quiet, but his words were firm. “I couldn’t have been more wrong about your childhood. I feel terrible.”
“I think I fancy you.”
Did Draco make the right decision by turning Leo down?
“No, you look perfect.”
“Medicine cabinet,” said Harry glumly, nodding his head in the direction of it.
What did he ever do to deserve her?
They walked together into the kitchen, where Harry set the cup tray on the counter. Ginny had already dug out her almond croissant and taken a bite.
“I’ve
“I’ve been a bit caught up in work,” Draco said, and it wasn’t a lie. He paused. “It would be nice to see everyone again.”
“Can we go back to you calling me Harry?”
The way Potter spoke about himself boggled Draco’s mind. Ever since he was a child, it seemed like all everyone could do was care about Potter. Talk to him, talk about him, listen with bated breath to everything he had to say. Either people didn’t actually care about him (which frankly didn’t seem too likely), or Potter truly believed that he wasn’t cared for. But, well, what did Draco know?
“It wasn’t that bad,” Harry claimed. He took a sip, thinking. “And I think I also
“I want to snog you properly, Draco. When we’re in the right state of mind. If you still want to.”
Harry felt like he'd been slapped; Ginny appearing so suddenly was shock enough without her speaking so bluntly at him. Though to be truthful, he's had a lot of that in the past; it was just never about this.
“Oh, he’s
like to discuss all your emotional
“Not that I’m complaining, but we’ve just passed the Great Hall,” Draco drawled as Potter led them past the entrance.
“Yes, it’s – it’s bad,” Draco concluded weakly.
He stared at his reflection, fixating on everything that needed improvement. He was paying for overindulging yesterday. What was he thinking, eating at every meal Harry dragged him to? It was appalling just how much he’d had.
how badly he feels about everything. It wrecks him. I’ve…
“It’ll be fine,” Draco said for the tenth time that day.
Draco stopped and faced them. “What do you do when a patient fancies you?”
“Yeah,” Harry said again, and followed Johnny into his house.
"What, you're suddenly shy now? What happened to 'harder Draco, please Draco,'" Draco asked, adopting a falsetto in order to mimic Harry, whose face was now burning.
, and I didn’t even know why. I should’ve been happy there, right? Celebrating with my two best friends and spending time with good people? But I wasn’t, so I left. I gave them some weak excuse and they let me go.”
Sorry sorry sorry
“Your temperature indicates you have a fever,” she frowned as she scanned her files. She began speaking at a faster pace, her volume dropping with every word. “You were relatively normal yesterday, and this is very sudden…I don’t think Healer Malfoy will be coming in until noon…I’ll have to let Leo know…”
This made Draco feel a bit better, but not entirely.
“It’s the second match of the year, Draco,” she said, nudging his foot with her own gently. “Do you want to go?”
“Oh,” said Draco.
“It’s part of the charm,” Harry assured him. “You’ll love it.”
Draco didn’t think he could handle that; no, he was absolutely sure he couldn’t. He had gotten himself dependent on Harry again, going against all the warnings his own mind gave him. Something twisted in his stomach, making him feel sick and nervous and, oh Merlin, like this was all a huge mistake. This train of thought wasn’t what he needed.
Granger flapped a hand at him dismissively. “Of course, Harry. Take my hand, Rose.”
my ex.”
They were sat in the abandoned History of Magic classroom; Binns didn’t have any more classes for the day and had retired to his office. And, even if Binns did happen to come back inside the classroom, he wasn’t exactly the most observant professor in the school.
Harry nodded.
did you know?”
He took a deep, shuddering breath, really not wanting to start crying again, especially with Draco right in front of him, and then he felt a hand on his own. Harry looked up, startled, and locked eyes with Draco, whose pale face was set in determination. Harry barely dared to breathe as he slowly interlocked his fingers with Draco’s. Expecting to be slapped away, he was surprised when Draco tightened his own grip.
Harry’s heart stuttered. Who did this Cait think she was?”
“Brilliant. And you, Leonel?”
“Fuck, Potter, you shouldn’t,” Draco interrupted. “It doesn’t make sense. You’re mad.”
It looked like Estrada suddenly realized who he was talking to again, someone who really didn’t need examples of major events during the War, for he trailed off and went silent. Harry was equal parts appreciative and annoyed. He wasn’t
There was no denying it. He couldn’t push it down, he couldn’t ignore it, and he couldn’t wish it away. He fancied Potter. His ex-schoolboy nemesis. His patient. What was wrong with him?
“So how long will you be staying in London, Ginevra?” asked Draco, refusing to fall down that rabbit hole during dinner.
"He's still in New Zealand, but he'll join me as soon as I can," she said with a hint of defensiveness. She shifted, then added, "What, are you going to give me shit for it again?"
ed my way into the program or that I’d only become a Healer in the first place to poison innocents.”
He wanted to yell at her, tell her to get him out immediately, but they both knew that Harry had a hard time saying no to Ginny.
“Take that jacket off,” Leo commanded, and Draco complied easily, tossing it on the ground.
“Merlin. How’d that go?”
Harry watched as two women walked past him, voices low in serious conversation. He heard someone - a child, probably - crying down the hall. He saw a Mediwitch walk past speaking quickly to that Healer Harry had seen once or twice – the tall one with the white-blond hair that rivaled Malfoy's own.
“Past tense. Yeah, I’ve stopped,” Harry said, nudging Draco’s side. He didn’t look that amused. “It’s been
Johnny let out a breathless laugh as he set to work, tipping a small amount of the powder onto his coffee table. He swiped his ID from the corner of the table and began cutting it into neat lines.
Draco didn’t know what he’d done. Potter was obviously acting more coldly toward him, but Draco didn’t know why. Even when Potter was doing poorly, he’d still talk to him. Perhaps a bit more shortly, but he still spoke.
“I can still call you Healer Malfoy, if you’d like.”
“I’ve treated lots of addicts,” Draco finally continued in a low voice, “But I’d never known one so personally. And for it to be Potter…it’s just even more shocking to me. He’s thrown me off my balance and I don’t know what to do or say anymore. It used to be so easy – they were just patients. I was just their Healer. But now…”
"He said...
Draco nodded.
Draco nodded.
Harry raised an eyebrow, and Wolff smiled.
“Because you’re different,” Harry cut in. He crossed the room and stopped a foot away from Draco, who seemed to be holding his breath. “There’s something about you, something that makes me not hate living so much. It’s like…you help me see through the fog. I don’t feel so lost when I’m with you, and you actually help me.
Harry let out a tight moan, tilting his head back to allow Draco better access. Draco sucked harder, determined to mark Harry as his own (for perhaps the hundredth time).
“Harry,” Ron said, his voice strained.
“Bed,” Draco said to him.
Draco moved closer, cutting Harry off. He shuddered as Draco raised a hand, gracing Harry's cheek.
Draco nodded and followed Harry to the closest fireplace. They Flooed over to Ron and Hermione’s flat, Harry stepping out of the fire, buzzing with excitement.
“That sounds lovely, Harry,” said Luna.
"Good," Draco said, then licked a stripe over Harry's arsehole.
“I just wanted to say thanks,” he said, clearly as uncomfortable as Draco felt.
Ginny’s face went from suspicious to scared to angry in a matter of seconds, her eyes wide and mouth open.
“Potter, I’ve got quite enough going on in my life,” Draco announced, somehow managing to look down at Harry even though he was only a few inches taller than him, “So I’m certain you’ll understand my asking this: what is this to you?”
“No,” Draco said. Then it was clear. “Oh.”
"What does it look like I'm doing?" Draco countered.
“You’re acting as if I’ve challenged you to a duel.”
when the sun began to go down and both Harry’s and Ginny’s stomachs started grumbling.
“Why do you do it?” Potter’s tone wasn’t judgmental. It was simply curious.
, and he honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d been clean for this long – but he still didn’t have nearly the same amount of faith Hermione apparently had in him.
“Yikes.”
. Was Harry really willing to commit to and date an ex-Death Eater? Or was this just a short-lived fling, to be forgotten as soon as it ended - some sort of adventure for the Chosen One before he settled down for good?
Ron nodded vigorously. “We’re always here for you, mate. You know that.”
“And of course, you were in Gryffindor,” Betty went on, apparently oblivious to or ignoring his visual inspection of her. “By the time I got to Hogwarts, you were in fifth year and Umbridge was in charge. I was so disappointed – I’d heard all these wonderful things about Headmaster Dumbledore and just to have him disappear…and then…”
“I suppose,” Malfoy said, nodding slightly.
It’d been a month since Draco had started his “eighth year,” as both students and professors had taken to calling it.
Harry considered him a moment. He seemed to come to a decision, and then began patting his cloak, apparently looking for something. He withdrew something shimmery. Draco looked at it curiously, stepping closer.
“It’s fine,” Draco told Leonel (and himself). “It’s not like we were ever close.”
But who was the “real him”? Harry didn’t even know who he was without the drugs anymore. It’s been part of his life for so long that he’d forgotten what it was like to just be Harry, and not Harry the fuck-up.
Draco dabbed his quill in his inkpot as Granger prepared her words.
to speak to my patient that way, Weasley.”
“No, really. I’ll show you.”
It was all a mess.
“Wow,” Harry said, and Draco couldn’t see his face, but he could hear the awe in Harry’s voice. “It took me ages to realize that I was bi. The Dursleys – my aunt and uncle and cousin – only talked about straight and gay people. And they only ever spoke about gay people to say how horrible and disgusting they were. I didn’t even know other sexualities existed. I actually had to go to Hermione and ask her all about it.” He laughed a little. “She was happy to help, of course, but she was so flustered.”
“I know. I reckon the entire wizarding community knows.”
Potter frowned and began unwrapping his scarf. He pulled it free from his neck and held it out to Draco, who looked down at it in surprise.
It was for the best, Draco had decided. He
Memories of fire and screams flashed through his head, and he winced, losing his good posture as he thought of his own losses of the night. Potter didn’t say anything, but nodded instead.
Draco paused. “A year is the general consensus.”
Harry shot him a glare. “I can’t believe you’d insult Star Wars like that. They’re not just for children.”
“Don’t worry.”
“That’s great, Headmistress,” Potter said, making Draco jump just the slightest bit.
“I’d like to think so, yes.”
“I resent that,” Draco said. “We’re not cold or snobby. We simply like our space. And our Housemates.”
“Breaking things. Accidental magic.”
“Oh. Thanks,” Harry said awkwardly, and tried to manage a smile.
“Thank you,” Harry said, and watched the two of them leave.
“Point is, we did,” Potter said, looking at him, a playful smile on his face. “We all joked about punching you in the face and you made your formal apologies and we watched a good match, so I think it went pretty well.”
“I make everything about me, don’t I?” asked Draco from his closet, his back to Harry.
"Just thinking about how I'm fucked up," Harry said after a few tense moments of silence. "So just the usual."
After Scrivenshaft’s, they decided to go to see the Shrieking Shack. It was just as Draco had remembered, or perhaps even more dilapidated than it had been.
“You’re not so bad yourself, Potter.”
There was no choice. He just had to spit it out.
“Hello, everyone! Thanks for joining us again this week. I’m so glad to see returning members, and new ones as well. I just have a brief breathing exercise to start us off this evening, and then we can have our usual go-around. Does this sound alright with everyone?”
“I know,” replied Luna.
Betty seemed to read his mind, and asked, "Would you be able to talk about it with your friends, if not with me?"
Harry shook his head.
He felt confident that she would treat Potter like just another client and respect his privacy.
“See, if we both put in equal amounts of effort, you’d be just as sweaty as me,” said Harry.
have the gall to be surprised about what they see?”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “I tried, but no.”
“Good morning, Draco,” Potter greeted nonchalantly, and Draco stilled at the use of his name.
) and walked inside. He went to sit on his bed and waited for Malfoy to come in. A few moments later, Malfoy’s lime robes and white-blond hair came into view. Malfoy shut the door behind him, ended the charm, and fixed a stern gaze onto Harry.
No. Potter wouldn’t do that. Draco had to believe in the good in Potter, because if he didn’t, what was left?
“It was awful,” he told her.
“Ron taught me,” Harry answered with a slight frown.
Draco sputtered and glared at Ira.
Kathy’s voice had adopted a calming tone; less enthusiastic and overly cheery, more gentle and soothing. Harry followed her instructions, wondering why he had to do such a thing.
“Trust me, it was bad.”
Draco sighed. Glanced up. “Go on. You’ve got my attention.”
“I’m not happy about it either.”
*****
“Thanks.”
He kissed him once more, and Draco managed a small smile.
He shouldn’t have sat up so fast. Harry pressed his palm to his forehead and shut his eyes, trying to distract himself from the lightheadedness.
Draco had to admit that he
“I understand Healer Malfoy is attending to you with some help from the other Healers. They’ll take excellent care of you,” Mitchell said to Harry. “It has also come to my attention that you’d rather keep your stay here confidential, which, of course, is something we can do. I trust all of my employees that are in your care, and that this room will be sufficient in keeping your identity hidden. However, if you’re not comfortable enough in here, it would be no trouble to move you.”
“Bugger off,” muttered Draco through laughs.
Cait glanced at Harry and then lunged forward, grabbing Samuel’s wrist.
“Sort of,” Potter answered. He shoved his glasses back on and bit his lip. “Maybe not in so many words.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Draco replied softly.
“Harry,” he panted weakly. “I –“
wasn’t that big of a deal, Harry rationalized; it wasn’t like he was going on a bender or like he’d dropped hundreds of pounds on hard drugs. It was just Muggle prescription medication – they took it all the time!
“I’d always liked flying, I guess,” said Harry, “But I haven’t done that since…I dunno when.”
He sometimes wondered what Draco was thinking about so intensely. It was hard to tell, but Harry had to assume it was about him. Sometimes Harry just wanted to grab Draco by the shoulders and shake him, perhaps yell that he was certain about wanting to start a relationship with him and to stop bloody worrying for once. But, alas, he didn’t know how Draco would react to that and he wasn’t too keen on finding out.
a git, Potter.”
“Get some rest.”
Harry dragged Draco down, biting his neck and sucking his soft skin roughly, only interrupted by Draco pushing harshly into him.
Harry nodded. It was a little easier to breathe.
“I’m fine,” he said weakly.
Draco almost laughed at that – he never realized that Ginevra and Potter were on such similar trains of thought. Maybe that’s why they had dated for however many years it was.
Harry woke up on Monday morning filled with nervous excitement. His stomach felt dangerously unsteady and his brain was buzzing with anxiety.
“Of course.”
Pansy didn’t look happy, but she let it rest. “Fine. We’ll see you later, then.”
"Yes?" Draco responded cautiously, his voice coming out like a breathy whisper.
Ooooh some development! Finally!
It wasn’t completely different from what they had before. Sometimes he and Potter would simply meet by chance and talk about whatever was convenient at the time.
When their food was gone and their conversation had waned, Harry asked their waitress for the check. Draco made to pay, but Harry took care of it before he had the chance.
Kathy frowned at that.
He met Potter's eyes, his heart pounding rapidly in his chest. The expression on Potter's face was indiscernible as he stared intently at Draco. He shifted under Potter's intense gaze.
Draco and Betty watched as Leo gathered his things and put on his travelling cloak. He waved them goodbye and went out the door, leaving the two of them alone. Draco turned to Betty and clasped his hands together. He began without preamble.
Potter was looking at him intensely, studying him so carefully that Draco thought he might’ve started using Legilimency next.
Potter had the decency to look embarrassed. “What you said, it’s been bothering me.”
“We gave him a Nourishing Potion since he’s been vomiting so much,” added Leonel seriously. “He’s dehydrated and isn’t maintaining nutrients.”
“You don’t need to get all weepy, Potter.”
“No,” Draco said hurriedly, “I mean, that’s great, Harry. Did you just figure it out?”
“Thank you, boys,” Cait said, swiping a pint for herself.
, we really do,” replied Ginny. She frowned and tried again to unscrew the cap. “Why can’t I – ?”
“You’re unbelievable,” he told Potter for the second time that day.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen her – let alone this closely. She was beautiful as ever, though she already looked older and more mature. She wasn’t a teenage girl fighting for her life anymore; she was a woman, courageous and funny and kind and strong. Her brown eyes were sad as they studied Harry’s face. He suddenly felt conscious of how poorly he must have looked.
“All right. Well, I’ll leave you to it,” she said glumly. She patted his shoulder. “You’ll be fine, Draco.”
“I had a talk with her,” Draco said gently. “She admits she was wrong. You were right – she was just worried about me.”
All at once, an almost blinding light entered through the window, and there were two loud shouts and a bang. Potter caught the wand, and the Dark Lord fell.
“Good. How did he seem today?”
“Well, Potter,” Draco began, disliking the way Potter was avoiding his gaze, but pushing forward anyway, “This has surely been something.”
“I do,” he snapped, and left the common room.
Draco crossed his arms too. “Do you regret it?”
Potter lifted his hand to his forehead absentmindedly. His eyes were unfocused as he stared out over Draco’s shoulder.
“So do I,” Harry admitted. “I should have told you earlier that something was up…you’re my closest friends but I don’t show it enough.”
“Fine. Whatever. Old man.”
Ginny stood up out of her barstool.
“I, er, yeah.”
“Mate…he’s really changed,” Ron said slowly. “And I hated the git when we were in Hogwarts. We all did, you know that. But he’s different now. He’s a Healer – doesn’t that say something?”
The two watched as house-elves brought plates laden with all sorts of food – sandwiches, vegetables both raw and cooked, chicken, eggs, fruit – and a large pot of soup. They arranged smaller plates, bowls, and silverware in front of them, and looked up at Potter.
“Yes, yes, I had a pathetic crush on him for years, we all know,” Draco said lowly as his two friends smirked. “But who’s the one here actually getting some?”
Harry glanced at his friends; they were looking at him in the way he imagined worried parents would.
But Samuel wasn’t even looking at her. Instead, he was looking at Harry with raised eyebrows.
Harry sighed. “Look, could we stop?”
“Lemme get this straight,” Ron finally said after the four of them had suffered through stiff silence for quite some time. His ears were red. “You…and Harry…are…friends?”
“Give or take a week. Now, I should add that these are only the physical symptoms. The emotional and mental effects withdrawal has will be cared outside of St. Mungo’s. We’ve got an extensive list of verified Mind-Healers who can tend to your needs.”
is what captured people’s minds?
“He’s never listened to us before,” he said, his tone bitter. “We’ve been trying to help him for years, for all the good it’s done him. Why should this time be any different?”
“Oh,” Harry cleared his throat; his voice was rough, “Then what happened?”
“Er –” started Harry, but Malfoy cut him off.
. It was unnerving talking to Potter, of all people, about this.
Draco nodded. “Might it even make you think that the temporary relief wasn’t worth it?”
When Harry trudged into the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee, Ginny was already sat at the island in the middle of it. She watched him make a cup for himself, using the coffee Ginny had already brewed however long ago. He went to sit down across from her.
feel more comfortable around him if he knew something about the bloke other than the fact that he was American and unrealistically fit.
“Thanks.”
“What was the argument about?”
“He was actually pretty supportive,” Harry said. “But Hermione…she seemed mad. She snapped at me.”
“While we do evaluate patients on a case-by-case basis, hospital policy dictates that patients can stay for a maximum of two weeks if they aren’t in mortal danger.”
“Right here? Really?”
Relaxed, he laid back down and thought. He remembered now how Harry had insisted he just sleep there, even though Draco’s room was just a minute walk away. He’d offered Draco his bed and wouldn’t take no for an answer.
The hand resumed its stroking.
“No.”
“Still, this is -” Draco nearly laughed. “You can’t be serious. You’re drunk.”
Draco had filled out paperwork for a patient that would be discharged later that day – a young woman who’d been brought in late last night. Her friend had supposedly been “helping her” by spiking her drink Befuddlement Draught. She defended herself, saying she just wanted to push her in the right direction, though instead of a push, she’d given her friend a shove.
to see what all the fuss is about.”
And then Ginny flushed. Harry watched his money, his habit, his livelihood swirl away and disappear from sight.
“I reckon you can’t quit that soon. You’d have to drink a little bit of potion every day before you stop completely. Y’know, lower the amount a bit until it’s nothing,” Ron piped up, “Cos just cutting it out would be dangerous. But regulating it would be hard on your own.”
He felt himself getting closer and closer to the edge, felt it deep in his body and Draco opened his eyes, wanting to look at Harry and oh fuck, he was beautiful, so beautiful, sucking and licking Draco-
Draco didn’t know what to say. What could one possibly say to something like this? He thought about this cousin of Harry’s, this aunt and uncle. He felt anger rise within him; how could they be so cruel to a child, to Harry? He wanted to find them, hunt them down, make them pay for what he did. His grip on Harry’s hand tightened.
“An arse.”
Draco sagged with relief. “That would be brilliant.”
“That I
Draco felt a rush of pride as he read the article more carefully, amazed at how far Potter had come. He stared at the photograph for a couple more moments before hurrying to find a clean piece of parchment and quill.
“Who?” Draco asked, and then, “Samuel? I don’t see why he should be.”
“Er,” Harry said smartly, breaking the silence.
“Oooh,” said Ginny, waggling her eyebrows suggestively.
Was Ginny due for a visit today? Or Hermione or Ron? Would any of them let Harry leave earlier than he had planned? Would they trust him enough to not relapse immediately, especially in the state he was in? It was doubtful; none of them were complete idiots and Harry had fooled them for too long now and far too many times.
“What time is it?” Draco mumbled.
Draco wanted to kiss Harry desperately, but Astoria, let alone the entire student body, were right there. It had felt torturous having to be apart from Harry, though it hadn’t even been a while day. He hoped Harry missed him even half as much.
She stepped closer, and Harry would’ve liked nothing more than to turn and run into his room. He was frozen in place, however, his fear effectively petrifying him.
Harry didn’t respond; he was still frowning at his reflection. Draco went to stand next to him, keeping his own gaze fixed on Harry instead of the mirror.
“We put in equal effort.”
“Oh, wow,” said Samuel, looking even more nervous now. “Really, Kathy, you didn’t have to.”
“You have all the equipment?”
His use of Harry’s given name seemed to startle them both, and Draco recovered first.
“Potter.” He nodded before turning back around to gaze into the distance. Anywhere but Potter.
Potter grimaced. “Don’t remind me. They left five minutes after we’d gotten here.”
“So,” Draco repeated.
“God,” Harry said, biting his lip. “I’m so sorry.”
“Alright,” Mitchell said, her face slightly less tense. She turned back to look at Potter. “I’m sure Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger will be here soon.”
“You make it sound so easy,” Harry said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Draco nodded. Harry was watching him carefully.
had killed all those goblins and wizards in his rage at one point…
Blaise laughed as he came up behind Ginny and took his coffee and pastry.
“I don’t really know how to talk about it, either,” Harry confessed. “I never really had a chance to. Honestly…that day in group was my first time actually talking about it to someone other than Hermione and Ron. And even then…I didn’t tell them much. They just figured something was up from things I’d said.”
Malfoy gave a stiff nod, and with a final searching look, left Harry’s room.
They parted ways before entering the Hall, promising to meet up again later on. It was a Saturday, and that meant time to relax (or in their case, fuck). It made Draco feel giddy but also rather foolish – like it still wasn’t real, like it was still impossible that Harry Potter would give someone like him the time of day.
Draco hesitated this time.
“Yes, my friend and I were hoping to get a bite to eat.”
Harry closed the door behind him, letting Draco enter first. Harry went to sit on the bed, and when Draco was still standing in the middle of the room, his eyes taking it in, Harry said, "You can sit down."
“Fine,” said Harry, his eyes going back up to Malfoy’s face. “What do I have to do?”
“’S your fault.”
“Bloody disgusting,” Draco said, wishing for the taste to leave his mouth.
right now?”

Johnny nodded and produced a plastic Ziplock bag of small, pale pills.
“Potter.”
“Partly,” he admitted. “Which is ridiculous because I
“I won’t,” Ira said sincerely.
Draco walked over and Vanished the contents wordlessly, averting his gaze and trying to remind himself that Potter had a right to hate him at this moment. He shuddered to think what it would be like if the tables were turned.
“That’s alright,” Kathy said, relaxing slightly in her chair though she was still gripping her clipboard a bit too tightly. “If you’d like to step outside to work out your differences, you’re free to do so.” At the unwilling looks of both Harry and Malfoy, she added, “I’m afraid I’ll have to insist.”
“You have a nice place.”
“Er, sorry,” Harry said, grimacing down at the mess he’d made.
“God, I really don’t know,” Harry said. “I don’t.”
Harry then decided to tackle his hair, which felt greasy and matted underneath his fingers. He shampooed vigorously, and did it once more for good measure before conditioning. He rinsed off thoroughly, running water over his face and lathering it with soap. His fingers ran over his beard – he had to call it that at this point, it’d been a minute since he’d shaved. But he found that he rather liked it, and decided there was no reason to shave it off.
“I also wanted to say that while I may just be repeating myself from a few years ago, I apologize for everything I ever did to you two. My behavior was inexcusable – both the petty, childish things I’ve done and the far graver actions I committed in my later years – though they were both fueled by my own hate and prejudice. I’m filled with regret and shame and truthfully, don’t expect you to forgive me. Harry has…been exceptionally gracious and though I don’t deserve it, has shown me real kindness.”
say he wanted Potter to have another nourishment potion.
“I’d like it more if you’d actually get in there,” Harry panted.
“Why would I?”
“They told me,” Potter said matter-of-factly, eyes on his apple. “Sort of. They keep asking me about it, saying things like
It made sense, though. He’d seen snippets of Voldemort’s horrific stay at the Malfoy Manor, and he certainly didn’t envy them. He wondered how it felt to occupy the same spaces that Voldemort had – to live in the same house as Voldemort had.
He was on his own now.
Harry pushed Draco’s head down again and Draco obeyed, his fingernails digging into Harry’s thighs as he sucked earnestly. Harry moaned and he fisted Draco’s soft hair, not caring that his palms were sweaty. Draco’s mouth was tight and warm around his cock, Draco’s tongue weaving and sliding up and down it.
Harry stared blankly at him before hissing, “I waited a year for you.”
Enjoy
“That’s depressing.”
“Harry…mate…”
“Yes, well, I’ll be more impressed when I can go in my childhood bedroom without breaking down.”
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
Draco sighed and stirred his drink miserably.
He felt Harry chuckle, his arms wrapped tightly around him.
a next time.”
“No, tell me,” Harry pleaded. “Since when?”
“I slept a little longer than I meant to and had a lunch with a coworker,” Draco explained. “And then a new patient came in, so I was only able to make afternoon rounds.”
Harry nodded against Draco’s chest.
Draco snapped his head back to Potter at his voice; he was looking at Draco again. Draco shifted under his intense gaze.
“I always knew,” Harry insisted, “Some part of me, at least. It was buried underneath all the other shit I had to worry about. I just couldn’t put a name to it until two days ago.”
“You can call me Harry," he explained. "'Mr. Potter' is just...too much right now."
Harry worried his lip. He seemed to know what Draco had been thinking.
She cast the spell again and the numbers and lines came into existence once more. The American Healer – his badge simply said
"Gin-"
“Yes, I imagine it is,” Malfoy agreed.
“Go on, Harry. Use your words.”
Harry relaxed his grip and shook his head. Draco took his hand back, whisky forgotten.
it was when you used to say it in school, it drove me fucking mental.”
Instead, Malfoy simply walked past.
“Just because

“Tough. Maybe you shouldn’t have stuck your

“It’s
By eleven, Draco had checked up on his patients, had a few frank talks, been told off twice, and released one person. There was only one more thing to check off on his morning agenda: talk to Potter.
Harry frowned, unsure of the answer himself. How
Harry nodded, worrying his lip.
“Rivals?” Samuel laughed. “You make it sound so serious.”
“I don’t think anyone ever did.”
The next day in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Pansy nudged Draco with her foot.
Granger’s head turned at that.
“All right. We can walk there quickly enough, and don’t forget, they’re Muggles.”
Potter frowned. “What happened?”
“Yes please,” Harry said.
“Oh, Pansy, you would never believe what I heard about…”
Potter looked up, surprise in his face.
“Well,” Draco said, wanting a change of subject. “I see you’ve waited until Pansy left this time.”
“Pansy. Could I talk with you a moment?”
"Do I remember?" asked Ira incredulously. "He was the talk of our little St. Mungo’s town for a good few months. And what of our Savior?"
"Well, Harry - is it alright to call you by your Christian name?"
When Draco had finally written Blaise and asked about Ginevra and Potter, Blaise had simply written back, ‘why do you care, you berk.’
“I will.”
“No,” Harry said firmly, a smile growing on his face.
Granger and Weasley nodded. Mitchell’s eyebrows rose infinitesimally.
It was a sign of Ginny’s dedication to Harry that she had dropped everything and arrived at St. Mungo’s at a moment’s notice just because Harry had needed her. She was in his hospital room only two minutes later, breathless as she rushed inside, her red hair flying behind her.
“Do those ridiculous glasses not work?” Malfoy said in a bored tone of voice. He was swirling the straw in his drink rather than actually drinking it. “Pictures of your escapades have been published everywhere.”
“No, what is it?” Harry pressed.
“That’s very sweet of you,” Draco said, closing his eyes again.
Ginny came in, her face apologetic.
“God, believe me, I haven’t,” Harry said, coming ever closer. “I know you find this hard to believe, but I really like you, Draco.”
He shrugged. "I s'pose."
want to see Harry Potter’s limp body being carried in on a stretcher.
“Alright, alright. I’ll stop.”
“Somewhere between
“No, that’s alright. They can stay.”
“Good, I’ll have to pass along my congratulations. Poor boy’s been whinging about you for half our lives.”
“I know it’s not worth it. I’d take it back if I could. I’d take it all back,” Harry said, his throat thick. “I never would’ve started – started any of this if I knew where it’d take me.”
And then Harry realized that he was shirtless, wearing only pants - too panicked to put on clothing before rushing out the room.
“No!”
“Sounded to me like he said he’s fancied him for years, Betty,” Leo told her.
He was mad at himself, really. People aren’t meant to be wholly dependent on others for their source of happiness – Draco knew this, but he had latched onto Potter all the same. It was pathetic. He and Potter hardly even spoke, they didn’t have any semblance of an actual relationship, but Draco latched onto him all the same. And now that Potter was gone, there was nothing that made Draco feel like he was actually alive.
“No, I know.” Weasley frowned. “Still just trying to wrap my head around it.”
Before Harry could do more than turn and glare at Hermione, Ron interrupted.
“He was my great-uncle.”
“What smell?”
“Not me,” said Astoria from the doorframe. “They just don’t know how to handle their drink.”
“Even if that were true,” said Draco carefully, “You owe your success to yourself. No one else did that, Harry, it was all you. It could
“Jesus,” interrupted Harry impatiently. “Aren’t you tired of this? The same argument, over and over again? It’s been a year. I’m clean. I haven’t used since – since that day, and even though some days are fucking hell, I’m not planning on using again. I’m not fragile, Draco. I’m not about to break.”
too much happening right now. “He’s all yours. Good day.”
Draco kept trying to catch Harry’s eye but found that he could not; the other man was too busy talking to Weasley and Granger.
This, he could talk about this.
“Yes, Healer. I was told a few days ago by her partner that they’re in New Zealand until the end of the month,” Draco said, thinking back to the owl Blaise had just sent him.
“Harry,” Hermione said again tearfully. “We should’ve tried harder to help you.”
Draco crossed his arms, still fuming but managing to simmer down.
"What sort of special occasions?"
“Huh? Yeah, I’m fine,” Harry said unconvincingly.
Ron gave Harry a small smile.
Draco worked on his Defense Against the Dark Arts assignment for an hour before he fell asleep, the Dark Lord tainting his hazy dreams.
“I think you’re confusing me with yourself,” Draco said wryly. “You deserve the best, Leo, and I’m not it.”
"It's likely. I blacked out," Harry admitted reluctantly. He chewed on his lip. "That's usually how it goes."
“It’s endearing. No, really. And you wouldn’t be the Malfoy I know if you didn’t.”
If this was any other day, he would have fought. But he was tired, and frankly, he didn’t care enough to.
Malfoy stuck the paper back on his clipboard and made a little note on it.
“Malfoy, stop it!”
He watched as Malfoy stood up gracefully and made for the kitchen. Harry sat there for a few more seconds before standing as well.
Although social punishment didn’t do much good either. All the whispers and glares and taunts in the world couldn’t make him pay for what he’d done. And it didn’t even hurt much after a while; what could anyone say to him that he hadn’t said to himself already?
He pulled Malfoy close once again and kissed him hard, sighing contentedly at the softness of his lips. To his delight (and surprise), Malfoy kissed back, though briefly.
And Draco wouldn’t be Potter’s Healer anymore. No constraints. No boundaries to be worried about crossing. They’d be able to speak freely;
, thought Draco. This wasn’t something he thought Potter would bring up.
There was something – a near-smile. And then Potter’s expression was closed-off and thoughtful again.
"I don't think so. Potter can rile himself up with little to no difficulty. But thank you, I suppose, for defending my honor."
“How are you so calm about this?”
“Do you ever have nightmares, Malfoy?”
“Oh, Harry,” he panted with effort. “So good.”
Sprinkles in some much-needed humor
“Oh, Merlin, Harry,” Draco murmured, pleasure overtaking him. “You feel so – so good.”
“You’re not that person anymore. It’s just a mark now.”
Malfoy checked his wristwatch. “It’s one minute to ten. Are you ready?”
“It’s like the war. I can’t stop thinking about it. I wish I could. I hate when it comes back but it always does, and I try to just forget about it, to just move on, but I can’t. And it’s even worse at night, when I have nightmares about it…I can’t help what I dream, y’know?”
“Me neither,” said Potter.
“Oh, hello,” she said, her gaze sharp as she eyed the two guilty men.
“You want to know, Malfoy? You
Malfoy gave a small nod and turned to leave. His hand was on the doorknob when Harry spoke again.
Maybe he just wanted to be reckless. Maybe he wanted to feel something other than panic and anger or
Harry’s cheeks got even hotter. There was something about the way Luna said it that made Harry uncomfortable.
be interested?”
gain from driving me mad?”
“Ginevra Weasley,” Draco answered. “However, I decided not to attempt to call her as her work requires her to travel extensively.”
Harry sputtered as Ginny laughed even more.
” Ira said, and lifted their own glass. “Cheers.”
“It’s not our fault, Hermione,” Weasley said, though it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Granger. “We couldn’t have known it was this bad. You know how he is about hiding things…”
Draco stopped short, skidding to a halt in the corridor. Potter paused and glanced back at him curiously.
He sat back and waited for someone to arrive.
“Oh. I didn’t realize we’d slept that long,” said Harry.
“Shut up,” Harry said, closing his eyes.
Draco turned to face him; Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Nothing,” Draco said hurriedly.
Betty shook her head.
“Well,” Draco said because he didn’t know what else to say, “That’s…surprising.”
He handed Harry the paper; he was careful not to touch Malfoy’s hands as he took it from him.
She gazed at Potter for a second more with tired eyes, and finally nodded. Granger released Potter’s and took Weasley’s, and stood up shakily. They walked out the room together, Granger hanging onto Weasley as if for her life. Draco and Leonel glanced at each other.
hand was now on Draco's face, right where Leonel’s had been a moment ago.
in the direction of the door – no use in scaring the other patients and guests. Even Leonel looked frightened, though he was trying, unsuccessfully, to hide it from Draco.
certainly won’t be decorating it. You have terrible taste,” Draco drawled.
“I…me neither,” Draco replied, his throat suddenly dry.
“The cupboard?”
"You hungry, Draco?" asked Harry.
Harry nodded.
“Give me a few, then.”
At this point, Harry wasn’t feeling particularly picky. Whisky, calming potions, Xanax, weed, or cocaine…
“Well,” Draco began, lazily watching the fireplace now, “She
“Yes.”
Mitchell used her wand to move the two chairs closer to Potter’s bed and left the room with a brief smile. Leonel and Betty followed at her heels. Draco lingered behind, knowing he had to say something. He
Draco didn’t know what was happening. If Harry didn’t approve, wouldn’t he just tell him instead of asking all these questions and beating around the bush?
“I know what I want. For the first time in ages, I know what I want,” Harry said firmly, “And it’s you. You make me feel alive
Draco nodded. "Now hurry and read it before I lose my nerve."
“Good morning, Mr. Potter,” she greeted.
“So you see,” Draco continued, “I don’t care. I can’t, truthfully, but when I look at these,” he ran his hand over his bare chest, “I try to see them as old marks. I try not to dwell on the past. I’ve spent too long doing that, so I just…move on.”
“Cheers.”
Draco reached into his pocket and withdrew Potters shrunken files, returning them to their original size and sliding them over to Wolff. She opened the files and looked over them with interest, the light crow’s feet around her eyes crinkling.
Draco nodded. “You really can talk to me anytime. And I…honestly felt guilty that we’ve spent so much time – that
Once he’d completed his make-up year at Hogwarts, Draco had lived alone for the first time in his life. He got a small flat in the outskirts of Wizarding London and went to medical school to learn how to become a Healer. He’d since upgraded flats, but he still woke alone every morning and went to bed alone every night. There was that lovely moment of time when he’d sometimes be accompanied by Leonel, but ever since their break-up, Draco had to get used to sleeping by himself all over again.
“Yeah, I would,” he answered with a grin. “Owl me, yeah? I reckon your schedule is a bit more demanding than mine.”
“Sorry about her, she’s a bit of a bitch,” Damien said to Harry, which just surprised Harry even more.
“Anyway, sorry, what was it that you wanted to ask me?” Draco asked, breaking himself out of his reverie.
They entered the pub rubbing their frozen hands together.
Draco bowed his head. "Of course. It's just essential you understand
His curiosity getting the better of him, Harry began moving closer to the two men until he was only about a meter away from them. From this distance, he could hear what they were saying while avoiding the risk of being caught.
“No,” Draco managed to say. He cleared his throat. “I’m glad you did. I just wasn’t expecting it, what with....”
Harry gave up and followed Draco to the bathroom, where they showered quickly (though thoroughly). When they’d finished and dried off, they hurried back to Harry’s bedroom and
Harry let out the heavy breath he’d apparently been holding and wiped his palms on his jeans. What was Malfoy playing at? He’d been completely closed off this morning, not wanting to speak to Harry in the slightest, but then he’d gone and went all soft on Harry, telling him he could talk to him at any time?
“Right,” said Harry, remembering their accidental visit during fifth year, “But for natural problems…there’s nothing?”
“Harry,” said Hermione softly, placing a hand on his own. He tensed slightly at the touch but relaxed a moment later. “Do you want us with you when you leave? Or will Ginny be enough?”
“I think…I’m going to try and go back to sleep. If that’s alright..?”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Harry’d done this to him. He’d sliced him open and stood helpless as he bled everywhere. Harry traced one of the scars with a trembling finger, which ran from a collarbone down to his bellybutton. Draco watched, his hair falling in his eyes, expression indiscernible. Finally, he took Harry’s hand and lowered it, his mouth set in a frown.
“Come on, I need to ask you something,” she said to him, and then whispered exaggeratedly, “In private.”
“It’s so much shorter than before,” Betty commented after she finished.
Pansy hummed. Draco turned to look at her.
“What made you change your mind?”
“Oh, relax, Draco,” Ira said. “The Leaky is a perfectly respectable establishment.
And all this on top of a complicated rivalry that spanned over six years. Draco didn’t know what to think.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. Malfoy frowned and crossed his arms.
"Oh, thank fuck," he sighed in relief.
He was on his way to do one final check on the witch in question when one of the Healers in his department stopped him.
He took them down some stairs and led them down a corridor, stopping at a painting of a bowl of fruit. Draco squinted at it.
"So what were those thousand other things you wanted to do with me?" Draco asked when he’d regained composure, leaning in to suck the skin on Harry's collarbone.
“Just, y’know, for being my mate,” Harry explained. “For understanding and being nice and cool an’ all that…”
Draco closed his eyes and rubbed at his forehead.
“He saw me in the loo,” sighed Draco, rubbing at his eyes. “Asked me what I was doing.” He let out an empty laugh. “I fainted in front of him. I bet he loved that – I’m everything a poor little damsel in distress should be. Perfect for him –”
He couldn’t say that part though, much as he believed it. Wasn’t this happening all too fast? Wasn’t there still residual effects of Draco having been Harry’s Healer? And, not to mention, their childhoods?
"It's beautiful," Draco said softly. "Can I?"
Draco and Pansy both started at the sound of Harry’s voice; they looked up to find Harry standing there, a nervous smile on his face.
“You mean, I didn’t get to fuck
Draco’s chest was cold and tight; what was he supposed to say? He wasn’t a Mind-Healer. He wasn’t even a kind person. He didn’t know how to comfort people at this emotional level. Feeling panicked, he said the first thing that came to mind.
“You can trust them. They’re very good at their job.”
,” he yelled suddenly, and he heard – rather than saw – the window crack.
“Why?”
“Maybe four. How much?”
“Yeah, I wasn’t too sure of what to expect. I’ve never done anything like this before,” admitted Harry.
“Has no one really told you?” Draco asked, and when Selina shook her head, he was slightly surprised. “This must be the first time they’ve actually kept their bloody mouths shut. Yes, he’s here, but he’s asked us to keep his presence under wraps. No reporters, no fans, and absolutely no
to act professionally as your Healer. I couldn’t tell you that I think I feel the same way.”
“No, it’s nothing.”
“Sod off, Draco.”
It was strange not sitting with Harry at dinnertime. The Great Hall had been reverted back to its original layout; all four tables back where they should be. Draco sat with the other Slytherins at one end, and Harry with his Gryffindors were at the other. He felt vaguely lost.
get the hell out.”
“Good morning,” Draco greeted, making his presence known.
Though he was awake (well, not going back to sleep right this second), Draco was still burrowed underneath the covers, his legs tangled with Harry’s. His heart fluttered at the sight. God, he hadn’t had anyone else in this bed since Ginny, and that had been years ago. He knew he didn’t want Draco to leave, and speaking of that, why hadn’t he?
“You can’t force me to do anything, Potter,” Draco snapped at him. “This is ridiculous.”
He shot up and went straight to his closet to look for something clean.
Kathy moved on to Draco. “And what about you, Draco?”
Leo’s hand stopped.
“You know it’s just the two of us, right?”
happened. I came back expecting you to look even more skeletal than you already did, but you’ve surprised me, Draco.”
“Draco, you’ve hardly eaten,” Pansy frowned, never being one to beat around the bush.
Wolff continued to smile.
serious,” Harry said, and he looked so sincere that Draco almost believed him. “And y’know, both of these things were interconnected. I was figuring out my sexuality
Ginny gave a sharp little intake of breath.
“I still feel so…guilty. And
“If this goes badly,” Draco’s voice was hushed and his face was guarded, but he stepped closer, “I’m blaming myself.”
“I like to think I’m always mean, thank you very much.”
But instead of saying anything, he closed the distance and kissed Harry harder than he’d ever had, taking Harry’s face in his hands. Harry let out an embarrassing sort of whimper and kissed back desperately, his heart close to bursting.
“He probably thinks the same thing about you,” Harry said with a shrug. “It
God, it actually felt good. The scalding water beat down on his skin, soothing his tense muscles and washing away the sweat and dirt that had accumulated in the past…several days? Week? He scrubbed his skin raw with the provided soap, putting it out of his mind. He was showering now – that was what counted.
When he didn’t see any of them, he headed to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. Stirring and sipping absentmindedly, he leaned against the bar and people-watched. He was in the middle of watching two young witches giggling and falling over each other when he felt someone come up beside him.
Unable to help himself, Harry walked up and peered into the toilet. White powder was floating on top of the water, shifting and rocking and taunting.
“So you mean...”
Harry took this opportunity to grasp said arse. Draco rolled his eyes but smiled.
The other man had a clearly visceral reaction to Harry saying his name, and it only increased the fluttery feeling in Harry’s stomach. He looked at Harry as though it pained him and leaned away, crossing his arms across his chest.
He didn’t want to worry her. It’d hurt him to see her worried; she was one of the strongest people he knew.
“Good afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” said Betty, straightening up as she always did in his presence.
Draco took a sip of coffee, internally cursing himself for absolutely and without a doubt having feelings for Harry bloody Potter.
He was outside Ginny and Blaise’s flat half an hour later, hands full of steaming goods. Harry kicked the door twice and called out Ginny’s name, and soon the door was opening, revealing a freshly showered Ginny in a washed out top and gym shorts.
“There’s no one out there,” he told him, and began sucking on Harry’s neck.
“Thank you, Johnny. I really owe you.”
“But I
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, “Yes, like that, Draco.”
“Wanna kiss more first,” Harry mumbled, and pulled Draco close again, who didn’t fight him.
Draco raised an eyebrow, and to Harry’s relief, Hermione laughed. Ron, still flustered, put an arm around Hermione. Draco smirked, clearly pleased with himself.
Harry was so distracted by the way his first name sounded when it so casually came out of Draco’s mouth that he almost missed Samuel’s smile and ‘of course.’
Draco crossed his arms and observed his coworkers at work. Leonel was deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowed and hand on his face. Betty was nibbling her lip, her forehead pinched in concentration as she scribbled on her own notepad.
. I was a
"Oh, Harry," she finally sighed and frowned. "I hope you know you're being an idiot. When you brought him up before, I thought you just thought he was fit, not that you wanted to be snogging him exclusively."
As Slughorn walked away to examine the others’ cauldrons, Harry nudged Draco.
Draco couldn’t help but stare. He couldn’t believe someone so wholesome and good could exist in this shit world. Potter cocked his head, but Draco didn’t stop. He wanted so badly to take that beautiful face in his hands and kiss Potter right then and there, but then he would most certainly get punched.
“I look forward to it, Potter.”
“I don’t have a special activity planned for us today, so I thought we could take the entire session to just talk about our weeks. If anyone has any suggestions or requests, however, I’d be very happy to hear them.”
“Oh, Harry! And Mr. Malfoy! Come in, come in,” said Molly Weasley as she ushered them both inside.
, screamed the title. Below it was a photograph of Potter shaking hands with a pretty witch in her thirty’s, and a short article detailing how Potter had donated an impressive sum to a small, national organization called the Magical Centre for Mental Health.
Ginny made a face that very plainly meant she was sorry. Harry glowered at her.
They had Potions together tomorrow, and Draco was filled with a nervous energy. He didn’t know what to expect, but fortunately, he was more excited than anxious.
“Well,” Draco said, enjoying the way the wind felt on his face. Enjoying the way alcohol helped make everything lighter. Enjoying Potter’s company. “You aren’t. I care.”
Harry let out a moan.
Potter took his glasses off and rubbed at his eyes.
“You too, Malfoy,” she grinned. She stood on her tiptoes and looked past Malfoy, making eye contact with Harry. “Hi, Harry. Is now a good time?”
He watched as Draco’s face softened.
“Anything for you, Harry.”
He was happy. His friends were happy. And Draco was happy.
There were several things Draco wanted to address in that moment, but he blurted out, “I thought you were calling me Draco now.”
Words weren’t enough, Draco knew that. He crawled over to Harry’s side of the table, put his arm around his shoulder, and pressed a gentle kiss to his scruffy cheek.
“Excellent.”
, reminded of Dumbledore – before smiling.
And there was how he felt when he restricted. Airy, weightless. Disconnected – and in a good way. It was like he floated above it all; nothing mattered, not really. Just the distant emptiness within him.
Also I hope we all know we don't support TERFs in this house. Trans rights are human rights. 💗
“And what about you, Potter? Leaving with your Weasleys?” he asked, and if there was a hint of bitterness in his voice, well, it’s not like Draco didn’t try.
"I am. Thank you for the concern, Betty."
“I do,” George grinned.
He looked down at his watch then, and glanced towards the room only to meet Sam’s eyes. The other man raised his eyebrows and Harry gave a little shrug. He looked nervously towards Draco, whose face was impassive, and by the time Harry looked back, Sam had gone.
“I’m – I’m sorry,” Harry stammered, running a nervous hand through his hair. “Christ, I’m so sorry.”
“It’s nothing, Malfoy,” said Potter suddenly. He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye. “Just drop it.”
Ginny immediately looked more awake. Luna sat down next to her, her eyes wide.
Draco sat up, maneuvering Harry so he was sat on Draco’s lap, and kissed him impatiently, running his hands through that hair.
Draco had the decency to look ashamed. “Right.”
“Right, I get it,” Harry interrupted, causing Malfoy’s grey eyes to narrow. “When can I leave?”
your friends know that you’ve decided that I’m your new project?”
The pages she had pulled up for him varied. Some were to online bookstores that were selling self-help books. Others were online forums and communities, and there were a few to some psychologists in London. The last one she showed him was a very basic website detailing a mental illness support group that had weekly meetings a few blocks away.
“We both know I spend a ridiculous time watching you. That’s the only reason I noticed.”
“Wow,” Leo said helpfully.
He saw Harry nod.
Draco looked down at himself and back up at Harry, a sudden brightness in his eyes.
“The majority of patients that come through my department are poisoned, which tends to affect their moods. Others recognize my name and treat me accordingly. And some fall into both categories.”
“Let’s go get breakfast, Malfoy. I’m starving.”
“I never knew you were such a wuss.”
“Oh, Betty, I so look forward to drinking with you.”
“Yeah,” Potter said. He stepped closer, green eyes bright. “I realized how ridiculous it was to run away like I did. I think I was just confused – and overwhelmed. To know that someone, that you, feel like I do. Ron and Hermione and the others…they get it, of course, but it doesn’t feel the same. I don’t really understand it, Malfoy, but I feel…connected to you.”
“Good job,” Draco bit down a smile and nudged Harry with his elbow.
“Weasley isn’t even here right now.”
When he made up his mind, he said, “Follow me.”
He felt Harry’s arm wrap around him and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so safe.
“We all know,” Draco said delicately as Pansy laughed. “I can ask Harry if she’s seeing anyone.”
Draco looked down at himself, surprised, and realized belatedly that he indeed was not wearing his Healers robes - only the white-button up and trousers he usually wore underneath them. He'd forgotten to put them back on after returning from lunch. Why did no one else tell him?
He tore his gaze away from Malfoy and looked around for his glasses instead. His brain still wasn’t working as fast as he would’ve liked, and he didn’t think he’d be fully sober for another hour at the least. As he put his glasses back on, he searched for something to say.
Malfoy let out a short laugh. No menace, no cruelty - just light-hearted amusement.
“Do you call all your superiors by their first names?”
“Yeah, fine,” he said. If fucking vegetables were going to be his downfall, he was going to off himself. Harry brushed past Ginny and made for his room, avoiding eye contact. “I’m just tired.”
His gaze returned to Harry at these words, his eyebrows raised in interest. He stowed his wand away and calmly asked, “About what?”
“Er, right,” Harry said, glancing away. “Sorry.”
“You sure?”
Part of Draco wanted to leave right there – he didn’t have to take this – but part of him was just as stubborn as Harry was.
“Oh, right, ok,” Samuel said before chugging the rest of his pint, slamming it down, and allowing himself to be pulled away.
“What, you don’t call him ‘Draco,’ too?” Harry scowled, the thought of Malfoy just making his mood worse. “God, what a prat, still strutting about like he’s the best thing on earth, that ponce.”
“I got it,” Harry said, stopping the maître d’. “Thank you.”
The rest of the night came back to Draco in bits in pieces, and he felt delirious when he thought back to their kiss. The way Harry had stared at him was enough to make Draco dizzy. And what he’d said to him...maybe he was just being dramatic. It’s not like Harry had just come out and told Draco that he was fat. And the compliments that Harry had showered him with perhaps did have some effect after all.
He tore his gaze away from himself and pulled the door open. He ignored the growl of his stomach as he padded down the steps, crossing his arms and hugging them to his chest as he did so. Once he’d reached the bottom, Draco looked up, right into the bright green eyes of Potter.
Potter turned to frown at him. “They should, though. I trust you. That should be enough.”
“Fuck off.” He burrowed his face in Harry’s chest.
Draco knelt down on his knees, slowly kissing a path down Harry’s stomach and pulling his sweatpants down gently. He tasted slightly of sweat – an aftereffect of them having recently moved all of their furniture into their flat. Draco had his hands on Harry’s pants, about to pull them down to –
“No,” Harry said. “We have crisps, and erm…tea.”
He stood up, but Harry continued to lie there.
Harry winced. “
“Do you not care?”
“Why are
No one looked at him to his huge relief, and he shut the door gently before hurrying to catch up to Malfoy.
“What, a wizard?”
“Potter? Can you hear me?” he said clearly, hoping Potter was conscious enough to understand him, and better yet, communicate. This was almost unheard of, but of course, Potter was exceptional. “I would like you to drink an important potion that will help get excess chemicals out of your body. If you can hear me, please move any part of your right hand.”
“I’ll adapt quickly,” Pansy said, her eyes narrowed. She looked at them for another moment, then said, “Merlin, the way you two look at each other. Get a room, honestly.”
He looked at Harry sorrowfully, and Harry wanted to hit him. He couldn’t speak, couldn’t find the words, and when Draco made to leave, he softly said, “If you were serious about that owl, I’ll be looking forward to it,” and all Harry could do was stare blankly at his retreating back.
“Jesus Christ, Malfoy, I thought you were meant to be clever,” he nearly growled.
“I’ve gotten this far without one, haven’t I?”
“I invited
The latter turned to face Draco with a raised brow.
“Yeah, it was useful.” The person closest to Harry said. Harry turned; he hadn’t realized anyone had sat down next to him. He was a black man, his hair cropped close to his skull. “I’m the same as Sam; I feel a lot more relaxed now.”
“Oh, yes, of course,” Betty’s voice was high. “I’ll firecall her immediately.”
And it didn’t help at all that he was a hero who literally
Harry blinked, surprised by Draco's authenticity. It seemed to be authentic, anyway, by the way his eyes were earnest and how his eyebrows were pinched together in a sad sort of way. His voice was low and calming, running over Harry's rough edges and smoothing them down.
Draco was gobsmacked as Ira poured generous servings of Scotch into the two glasses.
“Thanks,” said Draco. He picked up a plate and began spooning food onto it, his mouth watering. “You’re a life-saver, Leo. I haven’t eaten since lunch.”
“Yeah.”
“I really hate you, Potter,” Draco told him without any vehemence.
The sound of blood rushed loudly and violently through Harry's ears, and he was suddenly filled with the overwhelming urge to punch Estrada in his stupid, grinning face. He was one second from grabbing him by the collar of his shirt and getting him as far away from Malfoy as possible.
“Mystery girl, actually,” Harry replied.
Harry beamed at him, taking his hand once more underneath the table. Hermione made a little sobbing noise while Ron said smilingly, “Thanks, Malfoy.”
“Fuck,” he said to the air.
“Let me.”
Draco had reached his door. He turned to face Potter, his back to the door. Potter stood a few steps below him, arms crossed and face stubborn.
of Potter with his skin glowing and flashing a smile at the camera. He seemed well; young and healthy like he had looked for a few brief months around ’99 or so.
it. The pear that Potter had tickled let out a disturbing giggle and turned into a door handle. Potter took hold of it and pulled down, and Draco gaped.
Harry’s brows furrowed together but he said nothing.
“Oh, come on,” Ira rolled their eyes. “We
“Oh, it’s no problem, Luna.”
“Oh Ron, we should have done something,” Granger said desperately. “We should have gotten him help before this happened – we could have stopped it! We’re so awful and careless…how could we have let this happen?”
), and said, “Come on.”
“Morning, Blaise,” Draco said uncertainly. He got out of bed and smoothed down his hair instinctively. “Where’s Theo?”
“Alright, no need to get all worked up.” Malfoy took a sip, smug eyes watching Harry.
Draco squinted across the room and saw him in Weasley’s bed, still sleeping.
"I want to drink," he whispered to Ginny, his voice trembling unsteadily, "So bad, Gin."
Despite Draco’s complaints, Harry pulled him over to the room and let go once they’d reached the closed door. Harry looked at Draco, who raised an eyebrow.
He’d reread his mother’s response four times once he’d gotten it early Christmas morning.
He was the only other male eighth year in Slytherin. Vincent, of course, had passed (Draco still had very conflicted and painful feelings on this subject) and Gregory had left the country with his mother (his father being in Azkaban).
“What, my face?” Harry asked, undeterred, and smiled brighter.
“Yeah, I get it,” Potter growled.
Draco rolled his eyes, already resigned to this fact.
Malfoy pressed his warm body up against Harry, his scent overpowering Harry’s senses. Harry grasped at Malfoy’s arse as he slowly began to stroke up and down. Malfoy picked up the pace, continuing to move his hand in varying motions and speeds, incredibly perceptive to what Harry liked best. Harry quivered at Malfoy’s touch, overwhelmed by just how
He closed his eyes again.
“We’re getting breakfast soon,” Weasley said from behind the curtain.
“Oh – yes, I think I saw something in the paper,” Draco said truthfully, but he
She was, though, and they made their way to a deserted section of the library. He stopped at the end of an aisle and turned to face her. Pansy stopped as well, leaning casually against one of the shelves.
“Wh-what are you doing awake? Out here? And following me?” Draco asked, taken aback.
“Is he mad?”
Harry opened his mouth, though he had no idea what to say.
“Do it right this time,” Harry continued desperately, “If you’re so hellbent on taking it slow, we’ll do it. I swear, I won’t do
“You sound like Hermione.”
Harry nodded. “Looked for them and destroyed them.”
Harry nodded, biting his lip.
Draco had to bite down the huge smile that threatened to escape, but he couldn’t stop his entire body from feeling warm and pleased.
“Yes, you smug fuck,” Draco growled, taking one of Harry’s hands and putting a finger in his hot mouth.
“You know what I mean.”
Leonel nodded and left. Draco turned to Betty, who had a troubled expression on her pale face.
“It’s all right, I’m used to it by now.”
“Thanks, Sam,” he slurred, looking up at Samuel’s amused face.
An uncomfortable silence fell over them, and a Weird Sisters song began playing.
“Harry, have you engaged with Draco?” Luna suddenly asked, and now it was Harry’s turn to be embarrassed.
“And Granger and Weasley have warmed up to it, right?”
,” Harry murmured, each word punctuated by another kiss.
“Nothing – your eyes are just a bit red,” she commented, cocking her head and giving him a sad smile. “Good session today?”
“Malfoy,” Weasley said.
“Ah, looks like I’ve finally got something in common with the great Harry Potter,” drawled Draco.
It was beautiful, he thought. Gently worn, as if it’d been passed down, but twinkling brightly in the light. It was perfect. He voiced his thoughts.
“How? Unless you killed someone, like cold-blooded murder that you did of your own volition, I can’t think of anything so bad you can’t tell me about it.”
“Yes, I figured,” Hermione said, as Ron nodded.
him just a little while ago, so if he couldn’t handle Draco’s head in his lap, then, well,
“No! We weren’t – I mean – we were just sleeping!”
“Sorry, Ron. I didn’t realize you had so much second-hand experience with this,” Hermione said quickly.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, looking up. His face was unusually expressionless; it sent a chill down Draco’s spine. “I’ll find you. Tonight.”
“I – yes, he’s always been kind to me,” Betty answered, a slight frown on her face. “He’s a great leader and very patient with everyone…he works a lot, though. Why do you ask?”
He jumped and looked up, momentarily forgetting that Draco was even there. His grey eyes were concerned, his mouth set in a frown.
“Well, as fun as this has been,” Draco managed to say, his voice wavering only slightly, “I think I’m going to go back to my room.”
“I got visions from Voldemort,” Potter explained. Draco could hear him shuffling from where he sat. “You were in some of them.”
“Stop it,” Draco snapped. “I never said – or thought – any of that.”
make you feel alive when you’ve got the Weasleys and Granger and Lovegood and –“
“You haven’t met him yet,” Malfoy said, “But I assure you that you can trust him.”
He stripped slowly, his aching body resisting standing when he’d been lying in bed for so long. He set his glasses on the sink and turned on the water, getting in only when it was steaming.
“I imagine so.”
Draco pushed Harry to the ground, where he looked up at Draco with shining eyes. Draco leaned down, his cock hard, and he kissed Harry again. His hand moved down Harry’s torso and found his cock; with a thrill he realized that Harry was just as hard as he was. Harry let out a low moan as Draco stroked it through Harry’s trousers, which reminded Draco of where they were.
“I wasn’t,” Draco lied. “I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”
"Sorry, I'm just a bit surprised. Why are you living here?"
“I might.”
“Don’t apologize,” said Draco, wanting to calm him. “Why would you need to be sorry?”
Harry frowned at him, bouncing his fork up and down in anticipation.
“Malfoy,” Potter nodded. His green eyes flitted over to Astoria and narrowed infinitesimally. “And Greengrass.”
, thought Harry. He wished he could have gotten the courage to get help when he was their age. He wished he had had the means.
When he woke the next day, however, he felt just as he had for the past month.
“You want to talk about it?”
He couldn’t argue with her, a near ghost of what she had been before the Dark Lord had wreaked havoc on the world, and in his family.
“But I want to,” Potter said.
“Healer Estrada should be finished evaluating them soon,” Draco replied.
“I'm glad you’ve decided to accept help, Potter,” he explained, voice almost gentle. Harry was borderline disturbed by it and said nothing, simply choosing to watch as Malfoy became less of a robot and more of an actual person. “I sincerely think that it will help you.”
“Harry…”
, he told himself,
Malfoy nodded again.
Harry grumbled incoherently for a moment before opening his eyes again.
"You are normal, Harry," Draco said quietly.
“I think,” Potter said once out in the corridor, breaking their silence, “That once you start calling me by my name, I’ll start calling you by yours. For good.”
Relief flooded through him. He didn’t want
Despite himself, Draco smiled. He was glad he wasn’t the only one who was immune to Potter worship. Though he wasn’t exactly sure if he could say that about himself anymore.
was the one who had made Harry’s pupils become so large they looked almost black.
“What’re you doing out here so early?”
sleeping better now – being able to fall asleep relatively quickly and be uninterrupted until he woke – but it was still very early for him. His sleep schedule was all sorts of fucked before, and for good reason too. He just wondered when the real nightmares would come back.
“Do you know when he’ll wake up?” Weasley asked anxiously.
Draco, feeling like he had missed something, hurried to catch up.
“I – what?”
Harry sighed and looked back at Malfoy. His arms were crossed again.
Draco never knew what Potter was thinking. Before, his expressions and body language were easy to read. Angry. Provoked. Smug. Those emotions were so simple. One look and Draco knew exactly what Potter was thinking, and how he could best rile him up.
“You’ve been clean for seven days, Harry. You should be proud of yourself."
“I know very well what you were planning to say,” said Draco with an apologetic frown. “It’s just…I can’t and I
“Oh.” Harry understood now.
“But that would defeat the purpose, wouldn’t it?”
Harry nodded, took a deep breath, and walked into the large green flames.
“Ugh,” groaned Draco, shutting his eyes again. “Get that away.”
Draco blushed and focused on the chess pieces in front of him. They were sat in the eighth year Common Room by the fireplace. Harry had suggested chess. Both Macmillan and Abbott were elsewhere, meaning they had the place to themselves.
She set the two large boxes down on the coffee table in front of the couch and shrugged off her coat, tossing it on the couch.
Harry gave a surprised laugh. "Are you serious?"
“Only when you make up for this most recent transgression.”
His face was still burning hot when he realized Potter was talking to him.
“Harry,” Ginny warned, not taking kindly to his hesitation, “I’ll call Ron and Hermione over and the three of us will flip this entire place over if we have to.”
Harry nodded. He was surprisingly relieved that he could stay at St Mungo’s longer. He didn’t think he could do it on his own yet.
“Hello, Harry,” Draco said, hoping he wasn’t blushing terribly.
Harry bit down a moan and screwed his eyes shut, relishing in the pain and pleasure. His nails dug into Draco’s skin.
Malfoy stepped closer and before Harry could react, cast several spells on him. There was a warm sensation in his chest and he watched as various numbers and lines rose into the air above him.
“Let them down gently,” said Ira seriously. “I’m too busy for a relationship. And anyway, it’s inapp-“ Ira stopped mid-word and their pale eyes widened. “Draco, is this…are you talking about Mr. Potter?”
“Hey, Harry,” she greeted softly, poking her head in. “How are you feeling?”
Harry grinned foolishly at him before remembering himself.
“What is it with American blokes and going to the gym?”
and grabbed at Draco’s skin, finding it to be a much better alternative to the sheets. His skin was soft and firm all at once and he reveled in sliding his hands down Draco’s back, ending at his arse and grabbing it mindlessly, wanting Draco to fuck him harder. Draco seemed to get the hint and pulled out nearly all the way before going in deep and rough. Harry gave a gasp and dug his fingernails in deep.
“Maybe they won’t notice.”
Harry shoved the glasses back on his face, opting to ignore Malfoy.
The two pairs both slowed as they approached each other, coming to a full stop a few feet away from each other. Potter was dressed warmly in what looked to be a handknit jumper with a large ‘H’ on it and a black beanie pulled over his head. Ginevra Weasley stood next to him, her arms crossed and looking ready for a fight in a thick scarf and a matching jumper marked with a ‘G.’
“You’re adorable, Harry.”
“Touché,” conceded Harry. He grinned down at his glass before looking at Draco again. “Anyway, I’m – I’m glad. That my testimony helped. And that McGonagall helped you out too. I never knew that. But, I mean, I never even knew you’d become a Healer. I think Hermione mentioned once,
at breakfast with your Weasley and Granger?”
“Yes you do. I can see it,” Harry said proudly. “You get this look in your eye for a second as you decide what borderline rude thing you’re going to say.”
"It's alright, Draco, but would you like to tell me what's going on? You look dreadful."
“Yes,” Draco swallowed tightly. “Me too.”
“C’mon,” he mumbled, taking Draco’s hand and leading him over to one of the beds. “Go ahead, I just need to put this away.”
Draco shut his eyes again; he was far too drunk to be processing all this right now.
He didn’t remember the last time someone had asked him that.
began to run through Harry’s mind, his fear confirmed. “It’s too – I shouldn’t have let you do that in the kitchen, it wasn’t right. You’re meant to focus on recovery, and I think I may be distracting you and that’s the last thing I want. This is too important and I can’t compromise it – your health, your life.
He withdrew his wand to Vanish it, and looked up to find Harry’s eyes on him.
“No, it’s not, Potter,” Draco said, narrowly avoiding rolling his eyes. Potter opened his mouth as if to argue and Draco snapped, “No. Shut up. Don’t say a deprecating word about yourself when you very well know that if a regular bloke had gone through
for every second I’m awake and I hate it but it’s also…nice in a way.
PS do British people call weed "weed"? I know spliff is used instead of joint, but what about weed itself? That said, lots more drug talk in this one! Be careful my pals
She was giving him the look he'd gotten used to over the years, the one that said, 'oh, Harry' in a patronizing way. He looked away so as to not glare at her.
“Guess who’s joining us for drinks later?”
“How did your talk with Granger and Weasley go?”
Even though winter was typically the second-hardest season for Harry (the first being summer, for obvious reasons), this winter was turning out to be pleasant.
as he shoved his glasses on. And then he saw what was causing all the commotion.
“There are other ways to make money, Harry,” Hermione said. “Draco wants to help people.”
Her voice was clipped, and Harry looked down at his lap.
“Oi!” Harry exclaimed, his voice nearly drowned out by Draco’s and Hermione’s own. He swiveled in his seat to glare at Ron, who didn’t look apologetic in the slightest. “You didn’t have to hit me!”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Er – well. I don’t -”
Draco remembered sixth year. “No.”
Pansy scoffed. “Oh please, Blaise, we all know you’d jump at the chance to shag the girl Weasley.”
“I suppose,” said Draco. He gave a great sigh. “Well, I’m finished, so we can go back to yours.”
Draco ground his teeth as he sat up, his knees aching where they had hit the floor. He looked around the nearly empty corridor but saw no one suspicious.
Harry nodded.
“Shut it, Potter.”
“Oh, it’s nothing, Harry,” Hermione smiled. She pushed a pint towards him. “I got a drink for you.”
He’d never felt quite so selfish.
“You’re leaving already, Healer?” Leonel asked amiably once he’d strode up to Draco.
Pansy said nothing, choosing instead to look at him sadly. He couldn’t stand it, how
“Excellent. I’ll let her know,” Malfoy said. He checked his watch. “I trust Trainee Healer Burke checked your vitals at seven?”
"Do you know want triggered it?" Kathy asked softly.
do something, but as your Healer –“
Harry was still watching him with a worried expression.
“You do, Harry, and the sooner you accept it, the better.”
“I hate you.”
“Pansy, I need to tell you something.”
“Who is it, if I may ask? I have someone on my mind, and I think this is the one person who would make sense. Considering you’ve already developed feelings for them.”
“Ready?”
“What – you both knew?”
you doing for the winter holidays?”
“No hiding it,” Draco murmured as Harry reached up to touch it. “If they know, they know.”
“Spell it out for me if I’m that thick, then!”
“I, well,” said Draco, embarrassed, “I don’t know about gently.”
Draco carefully set up monitory spells to watch Potter’s vitals before sitting down. However, he didn’t get to sit for too long – Scarlett Mitchell, the Healer-in-Charge of the PAPP department, walked in a moment later. Her dark dreadlocks were tied back from her face, her eyes hard. Draco stood up hurriedly, though Mitchell was paying more attention to Potter than him.
“Good evening everyone, I hope you’re all well,” she said smilingly, gazing about the group. “I thought we’d start off with a breathing exercise today.”
“The nicest rat’s nest there is,” Draco said, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Softest, too. But really. It suits you.”
“Is something wrong?” he asked quietly, rubbing circles into Harry's hand.
until you say it’s ok –“
It was an hour and a half of staring before Hermione and Ron came into the room.
Draco crawled over to him until his face was level with Harry’s pelvis. He pulled down Harry’s sweatpants with force, impatient and irritated from being interrupted twice now. He pushed down Harry’s pants – finally – and pulled them off, tossing them to the side.
“Bollocks,” said Draco. “She’s always been conniving.”
“I’m sorry - you know how I am when I get mad,” Harry said, his face apologetic. “I know you weren’t ready to let people know and I messed up, Draco.”
in response. Encouraged, Harry bit him harder. This time, Malfoy tugged on Harry’s hair and mumbled something unintelligible. Harry kissed him softly in the same place and came up to meet Malfoy’s eyes, his whole body burning with desire and nerves.
much.”
Draco could smell Potter he was so close. Draco swallowed thickly.
“Or whomever,” Draco added before he could stop himself.
“No,” said Harry, glancing sideways at Draco.
I'm back! Can you believe?
“I did,” Harry said, seeming amused by Draco’s quick defense of him. “You were right, even though I didn’t know it at the time. I wasn’t ready for a relationship – or for anything, really, but I was convinced that I was. And you were nice enough to let me down gently every time I tried something.”
Harry seemed unconvinced, and Draco didn’t blame him.
Leonel laughed.
“I don’t know about that,” Potter said doubtfully, though he gave Draco a fond little smile that made his heart skip a beat.
Draco went in further, inch by inch, driving Harry increasingly mad by the minute.
"If it's such a chore then just stop," Draco snarled. "Find someone else to help and just leave me alone."
“You don’t have to RSVP or anything, so you can take your time,” Pansy said, hands in pockets. “Just let me know.”
Zabini nodded, kissed her cheek, and left the room.
“You can keep repeating those motions and keep getting that good second,” replied Draco. “It
Ron shrugged. “He’s all right.”
“You can help yourself to whatever you’d like,” Leonel said when he’d finished opening up all of the containers.
“Well,” Potter said, stepping closer, “Can I kiss you again?”
“Yeah, we’re good,” Samuel said, returning her smile.
He peered inside the room and quickly realized that it was an enormous kitchen. There were more pots and pans than Draco could count, stacked high throughout the room. House-elves were running about, chopping and slicing and heating and washing, everywhere he looked. The smell of food sizzling and bread baking wafted towards Draco, and he wasn’t certain if he was suddenly starving or nauseated.
"I went out in the corridor and heard Malfoy and Estrada talking."
“Listen, Draco,” Harry began. “Could I, er, well, I want to tell you something.”
“Oh,” Harry seemed surprised. “That’s alright. I wasn’t trying to, er, do anything. Yet.”
Estrada's dark eyes widened slightly. "Um, what do you want to know?"
"You know I've been ready, you bastard."
“No, course not.”
“Sorry. I've been making bad jokes lately, apparently. I gave Ginny a bad combination of a heart attack and guilt trip all in one a few days ago.”
“Merlin, are all three of you completely pissed?”
“You came to tell me you’ve slept with someone,” Ginny told him helpfully.
“Is there a reason we’re meeting somewhere so common?”
“Harry! Are these yours?” Granger demanded as she approached, brandishing exactly what Draco was looking for moments ago.
“Hey, Malfoy.”
He nodded again.
“Not so disgusting now, am I?” Harry asked softly, and at Draco’s slight shake of the head, he kissed him again.
It started out gentle enough, but Draco quickly realized just how restless and stressed he’d been the past week. His hands were all over Harry soon enough - touching his face, his hair, his neck, and then he was sucking the side of Harry’s neck. Harry leaned his head back, a light moan escaping from his mouth. Draco sucked harder, determined to mark Harry as his own,
“You’re not mental.”
“If you’re sure.” Pansy seemed doubtful. Draco nodded. She gave his hand a final squeeze before letting go. “Then let’s go find Blaise. And the alcohol.”
“Right,” Potter said, and even gave a slight smile.
"It's a mark of respect. Take pride, Draco."
“Get out of here, Potter,” Draco bit out, glaring at the man opposite him.
“Hey, Malfoy,” he said tensely.
"So, that was…" Harry began before trailing off, embarrassed.
“Yes I can.”
Draco pushed his tongue eagerly into Harry’s mouth and Harry responded back in kind, feeling lightheaded in the best kind of way. Harry wanted him desperately, and being pressed up against Draco’s lean body and feeling his hot, heavy breaths against his mouth just made Harry want him more. Harry pulled away, his hand still on Draco’s face, tracing his bottom lip with his thumb.
. We won’t be heard now.”
“Po – Harry,” came Malfoy’s voice, and Harry shuddered.
“I got pizza, I hope that’s alright,” Ginny said with a grin.
“Call me a stereotypical ponce but I prefer my drinks fruity,” Malfoy was saying when Harry regained focus.
“I didn’t think you still had it,” mumbled Draco once they had parted. He was staring at his wand again. “Thank you, Harry. I can return my mother’s wand now.”
Draco nodded. “Right.”
“We’re not a ‘we’ couple!” she insisted.
Hello! A chapter, as promised. I've been struck by inspiration for the first time in ages and I'm trying to take advantage of it. Hope you all enjoy and that you're doing well. Stay safe out there <3
Draco shuddered as he remembered the way his father had grabbed his face when he was eleven and whispered threats about what would happen if Draco’s deviancy got out into the world. He didn’t even understand what his father had been talking about; all he knew was that he was terrified and had something – or
“No, I haven’t,” Harry answered sheepishly.
“Really,” Potter said. “I was just following instructions Sn- someone had written in the textbook before me. I never knew what I was doing.”
“He what?” prodded Draco.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled.
“Sorry – that was – er –”
wanted to disappear, and then we went over to Ron’s and Hermione’s for brunch.”
Draco hanging his Healers robes on Harry’s coat hanger was truly the least of his worries right now.
Students moved around him, barely blinking as they walked past.
Draco squirmed in his seat, hoping Harry would understand.
“So that’s what I propose our team to do immediately.” Leonel glanced at Draco and the others, who nodded. Reassured, Leonel went on, shifting his attention back to Granger and Weasley. “Cleansing is a fairly easy process, though it must be done over a span of several days and can be painful at times. Of course, we’ll do our best to make it as painless as possible.”
She glared disbelievingly.
Draco’s throat was dry. He nodded.
“Someone has to,” Potter said nonchalantly.
Ignoring this, Harry found his clean clothes folded neatly in the corner of an otherwise bare closet and grabbed them before heading to the shower.
Draco gave a disapproving frown. "I'll have to ask you not to speak to me in that way."
Leo looked at him with skepticism. “Well. If you say so.”
“Did you tell Healer Estrada or Trainee Healer Burke about this when they came in to check on you earlier today?”
He shut off the water and exited the shower, toweling off. He indulged in glancing at his reflection. He looked loads better. The shower couldn’t fix the dead look in his eyes or his shrunken appearance, but at least he didn’t feel so filthy.
No idea what the hell I'm doing to be honest. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
– of not eating, you’ve got to be hungry. It’s simple fact. Try again.”
“I laugh, Potter,” Draco said defensively. “It’s not my fault you’re never around to see it.”
“You also seemed to get the wrong impression from me,” Draco said hesitantly. His change in tone made Potter look him in the eye again, his expression a little less hard. “I don’t – well, that is to say, I –”
It was irritating,
Harry sat down next to Draco, setting his bag down at a free space on the table.
“Tibson’s a tit, anyone can tell he doesn’t know anything,” Pansy was saying, her shoulders relaxing as she realized Draco had stopped.
“A week and a half at this point,” Draco corrected.
– and took a shaky drag. He wondered how many drinks Potter had had. He wondered if Potter had ever been drunk before.
know about ‘what’s happened to me’?” Draco asked, wanting to be mad but instead uncomfortable under Potter’s intense gaze. He sat on his own bed, across from Potter.
They finished their meal and moved back up to Harry’s bedroom to lie about some more. This version of not doing anything was highly preferable to how he did it in the past – he
“So no one died.” Potter stuffed his hands in his pockets. “I knew we could do it.”
Potter sighed heavily; so heavily, in fact, that it seemed to be a sigh suitable for a 100-year-old wizard rather than an eighteen-year-old one. He sat on Blaise’s bed – without asking first, naturally – and looked at Draco tiredly.
“You mean before we were rudely interrupted?” Draco corrected. “I’d be happy to.”
They situated themselves on the new couch; Draco poured their wine as Leonel flicked through the channels. He settled on some type of true crime show.
“What’s that smell?”
“You’ve forgotten I’ve lived in the Muggle world for the past five years.”
“I killed Voldemort, though, so that can’t be true.”
He steeled himself outside of Potter’s door. He was still unsure of how to act around him; Potter was like a stranger to him now. He’d always sort of been one, but he was much easier to read when he was a teenager. Now that he was coming off potions and alcohol, the withdrawals were making him irritable, unstable, and moody. Most cases that came through Draco’s department were fairly straightforward, but addiction was a completely different matter.
“I do already, as a matter of fact,” Draco said truthfully. “Though I still won’t be able to finish this. Do you want it?”
“What are you, by the way?"
thought Harry as he nodded.
“Thanks,” Draco said, slightly hurt.
Malfoy led the way out of the room, Harry walking hesitantly behind him. He’d been forced to stay in this hospital room for a week now, and now that the time had finally come to leave, he wasn’t particularly feeling at ease. He stopped at the door, peering out into the hallway apprehensively. A few people were walking hurriedly down them, one of them being Malfoy. Inhaling shakily, he stepped out into the hallway, out of the safe confines of the room.
Potter grinned, and Draco’s heart fluttered.
“How did you two meet, anyway? I mean, y’know, in recent terms?” Ron asked, his ears still quite red. “Cos you never mentioned him.”
“Fine,” Harry sighed. “Malfoy just asked me to double-check the dates you gave him. When’d you talk to him?”
It was Potter. Of course. Not one of his actual friends, or someone who cared about him, but Harry Potter.
“When will your licensing exam be?”
“Ask him next time. Tell him you’d feel more comfortable around him if you were more familiar with him. Or I can talk to him for you.”
“It was still wrong of me to make wild assumptions of your life and spread them to anyone who would listen,” Malfoy said and crossed his arms.
She looked down at the carton in her hands as if she’d forgotten she was holding them, and frowned disapprovingly before handing them to Draco.
“You’re here for mood things, yeah? And substance abuse?”
“God, no.” Potter made a face. “Don’t do that.”
Harry goggled at him.
“It’s not...never mind.” Harry seemed defeated. “I really can’t convince you to eat something?”
,” Potter said, that cheeky smile still on his face, and took a drink.
“Thanks.”
Harry realized that he hadn’t seen many of them in ages, a byproduct of his poor mental health. They were understanding, however, and some of them didn’t even blink an eye – they just greeted him heartily and went on to carry a natural conversation.
“Merlin, do you ever stop being competitive? It’s tiring.”
“Fine,” she had said, her face defiant. It reminded him of their days at Hogwarts (he felt a sad twang of nostalgia at that). “But I’m sending you all of these links just in case you change your mind. What’s your email address?”
“I’m going to go now,” said Harry.
Harry took a deep breath. “I think I like blokes.”
“Thank you,” Draco said in a tight voice, and left.
“I’ve just brought her along so I could say hello to you lot. I know you’ve been suffering in my absence, so the least I could do was stop by. We won’t be joining you, don’t worry.”
“Seventeen?” Draco repeated, shocked.
“You sure?”
“Yes, I’m sorry,” Draco responded as professionally as he could.
He wrapped his lips around Harry’s cock, slowly fitting more and more of it inside his mouth. He heard Harry gasp in surprise, and out of the corner of his eye, his hands grip the sheets.
“What happened to calling me Harry?” he asked lowly.
Samuel nodded, though his eyes were trained on the floor.
“Good.”
Draco shook his head. His throat was tight and he upped his pace.
“We were all supposed to sit together.”
Draco closed his eyes for a second.
“You fucking prat.”
Draco went to sit on the corner of his bed, facing Harry. He carried a duffle bag full of his clothes, which were admittedly of a higher quality than Harry’s own.
“Of course I did,” said Harry, almost offended, at the same time Ron laughed.
Draco stood, yawning as he did so, and pulled his Healer’s robes on over his white Muggle button-up and black trousers. He walked stiffly out of his office and made his way to the employee lounge on the eastern side of the floor.
Harry nodded, breathless. Ginny released him and stood suddenly.
Should he give it to Potter now? Or should he wait until tomorrow? Draco checked his watch. It was already six. Would it be better to leave Potter to rest for the night? He knew he didn’t exactly aid Potter in relaxing – quite the opposite, really. But on the other hand, he wanted to give Potter Wolff’s contact details as soon as possible on the chance that Potter would change his mind about treatment again.
“Merlin,” he sighed. “I’m sorry. I’m going to kill her.”
Draco was wondering what to say when Harry beat him to it.
Harry looked up from where he lounged at Draco’s neat desk, surprised. He smiled.
“It’s not my fault you chose to say that sentence in the worst way possible.”
Ginny shook her head, her expression dark, and said, “Maybe we should ask Malfoy if joking about it is a good sign.”
He hoped Hermione and Ron would come and visit today. It'd been a few days since their last visit, and he thought it likely since it was the weekend. He could talk to them. Hermione would provide him with logic and Ron blunt friendship.
“Thanks.”
“Not on the best of terms, my arse,” Samuel laughed.
“Want to leave?”
Draco’s resistance to him was unnerving to Harry. Sure, he’d said he was interested in Harry, but words only meant so much. What Harry wanted was
Harry worked his lip, trying to decide whether or not he should prod further.
“I admit I’m surprised that you’re still here.”
It was. His wand of nearly seven years. He grasped it firmly, and he felt right again, like he was no longer missing a vital part of himself – something he didn’t even know he was missing. Draco goggled at it, turning it over repeatedly in his hands. He looked up at Harry, who was grimacing.
Draco proceeded to do so and wrote down his findings, pleased to see that Potter was steadily improving.
He checked his watch again as he spoke; if he left in six minutes, he would have fifteen to get ready, and five to get to the restaurant. He wondered what he would wear; he’d never been to the restaurant Potter had suggested, and he didn’t want to appear underdressed…Muggle clothing was the obvious choice, but what, exactly…
“Alright. Just send us an owl when you’re ready for us to visit. No rush, Harry,” she added quickly.
Macmillan nodded and scooted a bit, leaving more room for Potter. Draco hesitated behind him, uncertain if he’d be welcome. He scanned the faces of the students at the table, and though some were looking back at him with distrust, he didn’t see anyone with pure hatred in their expressions.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He was in awe of the man in front of him. How did he do it? How did he seemingly take everything thrown at him in stride? Did anything make him falter? Draco couldn’t help but be impressed.
“Oh,” Harry said, looking surprised. “I wasn’t sure – y’know, it being a rat’s nest and all.”
“Right, sorry,” Harry answered softly.
“Don’t be,” Draco said.
“Oh,” Harry said. He frowned. “Well, I mean, I figured we were dating.”
Potter blinked before he hurried inside, closing the door behind him as if he were afraid Draco would change his mind. Which to be fair, Draco was very close to doing so.
"Would you like to talk about it?"
“What’s happening?” Betty asked them, clearly lost.
“Thank you for handling everything so well, Betty,” Draco said to her.
“No idea, sorry.”
“Bloody hell, Harry! What are you –“
She smiled and squeezed his hand.
“Why?” he challenged, suddenly annoyed. “If I can’t joke about it, what the fuck else am I supposed to do?”
Predictably (and unfortunately), Draco’s reservations weren’t unfounded. There were many who greeted Draco with blatant surprise, while a few simply did not speak to them. Draco took this in stride, however, and remained by Harry’s side throughout the evening.
“I'm not, I'm simply –“
“Glad to see you two are talking again.”
It was strange how disappointed Draco felt at those words. He tried to not let it show on his face, tried to keep it as impassive as possible. There was a sinking feeling in his chest as he watched Potter stand up and walk over to the door. Potter hesitated and turned.
It would be so goddamn easy. He could put on the Cloak and just walk out of St. Mungo's. Maybe even sneak into fucking Malfoy's office to get his wand back so he could just Apparate home. He didn't think he could walk all the way back, and he had no money on him, Muggle or Wizarding.
, thought Harry.
“Hagrid,” Harry said.
Harry almost melted from relief when the door opened and revealed Betty with a tray of food.
He felt so pathetic. He was just a sad excuse of a person, unable to function without the help of a few substances. He didn't know how people did it without them.
So now, whenever he woke too early, he sought out the lake (and a smoke). It was preferable to lying sleepless in bed, covered in sweat.
Draco shook his head. “It was just surprising, that’s all.”
“Ugh,” said Harry.
“Really? What have you been doing?” He was fixing his own plate now, just inches away from Draco.
Unlocking the stall door, he walked out and went for the closest sink to clean himself up. He first washed his hands with soap and water before rinsing his mouth and face. He turned the tap off and stared at his own reflection. The blood vessels around his eyes were popped, leaving unsightly red squiggles that stood out against his pale skin.
“You sure? Do you want to talk about it?” she asked him, brown eyes big and sincere.
punch me, Granger,” Draco added nervously, half-serious. “I’d deserve it, after all.”
“They’re not in your cloak either?”
“Ready all?” Cait asked as she strode up, Malfoy in tow.
“I’m just curious, that’s all,” Leonel said, raising his hands in defense. “You looked pretty…lost in thought.”
“You’re biased,” Draco responded. “You want me to fuck you into the mattress no matter what.”
“Pansy,” Draco said as he walked up and sat down.
“God, Draco,” Harry managed to say as Draco continued to tease him, “I never would've thought you talked like this.”
“You made progress, Draco,” Kathy assured. “It’s not easy to face your fears like that.”
Malfoy looked up at Kathy evenly, his fingers still tight on his cup.
Harry fidgeted. ‘Difficult time’ seemed a bit of a strange thing to call an addiction, but he wasn’t about to point that out.
That day after Hermione had set off for work, leaving Ron and Harry to clear up, Harry tried again to explain what support groups were.
“Draco.”
They continued talking and teasing each other throughout breakfast. At one point, Draco realized with a jolt that this was almost normal. In fact, it might have been completely normal. They hadn’t managed to speak like this for an extended period of time since the beginning of sixth year, before everything went to hell.
They finished their drinks in comfortable silence (something he never imagined would happen with them) before leaving. Draco closed the door shut behind them and locked it once more with his wand. He turned to Potter who now stood next to him, hands in pockets.
“Well that’s no surprise,” Draco muttered.
Draco moved his arm abruptly, jerking it away from Harry, his heart pounding with sick terror.
Well, he reasoned bitterly, if he
“I’ll do all the work,” Draco promised, stroking Harry’s cheek with his thumb.
“Are you alright, Potter?”
“What? What is it?” Potter asked roughly, though he didn’t actually sound mad. Draco knew very intimately what Potter sounded like when he was mad. “Malfoy?”
Draco didn't deign to respond, instead stuck a finger inside Harry, who gasped and shuddered. After Draco took a while pumping it in and out, he added another finger, and then another.
“I can’t!” Draco cut in, his voice breaking. “Just, please. Go. I can’t talk to you right now.”
After a few more moments, he stood, studying Draco with his dark eyes.
“Is that so?”
"I think, Potter, that you and I have very different ideas of fun."
“Who is it?” she asked eagerly, leaning forward.
He crawled over to Harry and set himself down next to him, his entire body still quaking after that orgasm. He loved the sight of Harry, naked and sticky and panting, so close his scent (and the smell of sweat and sex) filled Draco’s nose.
"Lest we forget," Ira sighed. "As long as you and Mr. Potter don’t start shagging in the storage closet twice a week, we’ll all be fine."
Harry caught his shirtless reflection in the mirror and stared, transfixed. When was the last time he’d
Samuel’s dark eyes were glittering with something mixed between fascination and awe. They were standing in an isolated corner of the room during break, speaking where no one could hear them. Malfoy sat with Kathy, who was listening interestedly. Everyone else was trying to be polite and not stare
Draco looked at Potter, his heart aching for him. He'd seen many times how long and turbulent the road to recovery was and knew for a fact that there was no easy way out. Now more than ever, Draco wished that there was.
“Completely,” she said again.
“Yeah, thanks,” Weasley echoed.
“Have to keep up the tradition of being a snobby, cold Slytherin?” Harry interrupted, rolling his eyes. “No one’s forcing you.”
“Be polite, Draco,” Astoria said and nudged him in the side with her pointy elbow. “Say hello.”
He rested his folded arms against his knees and leaned his head back, staring at the ceiling above.
Harry nodded, his face feeling like it was on fire. He tried to bite down a smile and failed. He glanced over at Draco, whose face was colored a light pink. Samuel smiled as well.
She colored slightly, and Harry figured she’d heard the rumors that he had been there when Dumbledore died.
perhaps?”
“How many times have you vomited since my colleagues were here to check on you?”
“Hello, Leo,” Draco said to him.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Potter’s face lit up in surprise and he grinned at Draco, and then Draco realized his mistake.
“Well I’d just met you, hadn’t I?” Harry grinned. “I didn’t want to be anywhere near you.”
It’d been almost a year since Leonel and he had broken up, and Draco hadn’t gotten close to another person since.
Harry nearly smiled back. "It's alright."
“Splendid work,” he said. “I daresay this was the most successful class yet! But I won’t keep you any longer. Don’t forget to clean up after yourselves before you leave.”
Draco was shocked; for a long time he honestly thought he could never get back to this feeling of normalcy, of lightheartedness. And then a nasty thought occurred to him: how long would this last?
Leo nodded, gave him a sad smile, and walked away.
Harry wasn’t sure if he believed him, but he gave an affirmative hum anyway.
"Point is, he's a decent bloke and if you got to know him-”
Draco didn’t skip a beat. “I can help you with that.”
Harry wanted to kiss Malfoy again but he didn’t know if he could. But fuck it – the exhilaration, endorphins, and alcohol all culminated into him being someone he hadn’t been in a while: reckless.
When Harry offered nothing but a wry smile, Malfoy continued.
“How nice of you,” Ira smirked, taking a sip of their own tea.
Desire overtook him and he stepped forward to kiss Draco, to kiss those lips and run his hands through that silky hair. Draco made a little noise as he kissed back fervently, his hands curling around the cloth of Harry’s hoodie and pulling him in even closer.
“Just,” Draco panted, hardly able to keep himself off Harry for a second, “Just get underneath.”
“Is he alright, Malfoy?” asked Ron gruffly from behind Harry. “Physically?”
Harry woke up at a quarter past six. He had had a regular dream, or so it seemed, and woke naturally. No sweating, no shouting, no crying.
went to for
Draco’s palms became damp at the mention of Nagini. “That’s absolutely horrifying.”
That was, if he didn’t starve to death first.
Draco reacted faster, standing up and facing Granger. Weasley had caught up to them by then, wheezing slightly as he stopped at Granger’s side. Harry joined the three of them apprehensively.
He then gripped his wand and spun on the spot, becoming enveloped in the dark and spat back out in an alley. Harry let out a fortifying breath and looked around, seeing only Muggles. Relieved, he stuck his wand back in his pocket and walked out onto the sidewalk. On his left was the restaurant Malfoy had been talking about.
“Yeah,” Harry said, biting down a smile. “All right.”
“Yeah, sorry, just got back,” he said as normally as he could manage.
Saturday morning – brunch with Ron and Hermione.
“I hope you don’t go running off with him, Luna,” said Ginny, “If you like pointy so much.”
He was suddenly and effectively shook out of his haze when he heard Potter say his own name. Draco tried to pay attention to his words instead of his body (Draco groaned inwardly). But now the Dark Lord was talking, talking about wands and killing him. Oh. Wonderful. First falling in love with Potter at the worst possible time, and now this. Somehow, Draco wasn’t that worried about the latter.
“Sure you were,” said Weasley, a knowing smile on his face.
“No, she’s working night shift,” Betty said regretfully.
“And I can do it a third, watch. You’re sweet, Potter.”
“No, er, forget I ever said anything,” Harry said quickly. “I don’t – it’s just me being stupid.”
Draco had a few bites in between pushing food back and forth on his plate. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him every so often, but he didn’t say anything, thank Salazar. He honestly didn’t know if Harry was biting his tongue on Draco barely eating or his…revelation, but he was thankful nevertheless.
"All right there, Potter?"
“Thanks, Betty,” he managed to say before she hurried back out.
“I’m not, you tosser.”
He momentarily envied the relatively pleasant reaction he got from Ginny and Luna. Ron and Hermione take everything way too seriously, Harry thought bitterly, which made sense, but it got so
“Earl Grey, if that’s all right.”
“Vegetables, Harry!” she said, throwing up her arms. “That’s all I asked for! You were out for a full hour and couldn’t remember the one thing I’d asked you to get?”
"Hey, mate," said Ron, coming forward and sitting down in a chair. "How've you been?"
For a while he’d taken to visiting Muggle bars and clubs. He’d get drunk enough to forget how much he didn’t want to be alive, and he might have pick someone up along the way. He was irresponsible, he knew, and he was an inconsiderate git. He’d hardly remember having sex with whoever it was, but he’d always leave before they woke up.
“Not here,” Draco hissed. “Not anywhere, but especially not here.”
“Oh,” said Draco as Harry pulled on a grey sweatshirt. As Harry shook out some (day-or-week-old, who knew?) jeans, he heard Draco say, “Would I be welcome?”
“Later,” Draco said weakly, but he wasn’t sure if Potter had heard him over the howling wind.
“Two days?”
He maintained eye contact until Pansy gave up and turned to talk to Daphne Greengrass. Her younger sister, Astoria, sat beside her. She was a strange one. Though both Greengrasses were elegant in every possible way, Astoria was much quieter and less openly confrontational than her sister was. Where Daphne sought out gossip and reveled in spreading it (as classily as possible, of course), Astoria simply stayed where she was and listened.
“It’s still a Monday,” Draco reiterated.
“Does anyone else know?”
“Yeah, I
“Hermione looked like she wanted to disappear, Draco looked like he wanted to disappear, and I
Harry stared down at the table.
“Let’s see what’s on,” he said finally, and started for the living room without waiting for her.
“You’re fucking weird, Malfoy,” Potter finally said.
“Betty, I wanted to ask about Potter. Has he been acting differently recently?”
He took off his glasses and tossed them onto his bedside table, his cock hardening as he watched Draco take off his trousers and climb onto the bed. His erection only grew as Draco came closer self-assuredly, that gorgeous smirk on his face.
Harry peeked around Malfoy’s figure curiously, and sure enough, Ginny was standing in the doorway in a soft-looking Muggle sweater and jeans.
"Don't say that, Draco. He's still your patient."
“Draco?” he heard Harry say, reminding him of what he was supposed to be doing.
“That’s just on you, Leo,” Betty spoke up finally, smiling pleasantly.
Draco chanced a look at Potter again.
Potter grinned again and leaned back against the couch, putting his hands up behind his head. Draco tried not to stare at the little strip of skin that was now showing from underneath Potter’s jumper. And Salazar have mercy, part of the grey band of Potter’s pants were on display now too. Draco resisted the urge to snap at him to pull his damn trousers up and have some decency.
He then wondered why Leonel and he had never shagged after breaking up. Just because they grew out of their relationship didn’t mean their sex had ever gotten worse.
Harry watched with a grin as Draco loaded up two plates with the food and carried them over to where Harry was sitting. Draco set them down on the table and sat down across from Harry, looking a bit nervous.
“What is that?”
Draco felt a deep weight settle in his chest. It was his fault. Of course it was. He opened his mouth to apologize when Potter looked up eagerly.
sound?”
"Of course. It was my pleasure."
The nerve of him. Harry had an angry chug of his Old Fashioned.
He glanced over at Ginny, whose face was unreadable.
like a drink now. Calming, whisky, vodka, dreamless sleep – whatever – as long as it would help him (not) deal with this.
“Harry! And Malfoy,” Hermione said, composing herself. She stood up from the table and walked over to greet them. “So glad you could make it. Ron and I have almost finished eating, I’m sorry, but I’ve placed warming charms on the rest of the food.”
Draco admittedly had a weak understanding of robots and chose to disregard this comment. Instead, he checked Potter’s vitals, ensuring that they were unchanged.
"How'd you end up here? You're from the States, aren't you?"
"Yes, of course. You won’t be able to stay here forever, though, just so you know. Will this room be acceptable? We could move you upstairs to the more long-term -"
“Hiring pool’s thin as ever,” Blaise responded. “War can’t fix everything, it seems.”
They both nodded.
Harry pondered the question. “I used to do accidental magic all the time when I was a kid. But I hadn’t done it in a while before, well…”
A series of emotions flashed over Draco’s pale face, which did nothing to mollify Harry, but then he gave a little huff, took hold of one of the lapels on Harry’s coat, and pulled him in for a rough kiss. Harry stumbled forward into Draco’s warm chest and though startled, he kissed back fiercely, his hands coming to rest firmly on Draco’s shoulders.
“No. No need,” he said, and ushered them into a stall.
“Oh,” Potter’s frown deepened.
Draco took another drag, trying to remain calm, and wondered why Potter was here with him when he could be inside with anyone else. After some deliberation, he voiced his thoughts.
“Should we stop?”
"Draco."
Malfoy regarded him for a second, an unreadable expression on his face, before nodding slightly.
“We’ve never been keen on sharing any more than necessary in Slytherin. I just assumed it was different with you lot.”
Draco took this moment to stick his index finger in Harry, whose body stiffened for a moment before relaxing, gradually getting used to the slow, repetitive pump of Draco’s finger.
“Oh,” Leonel said, visibly relaxing. “Then what’s the matter?”
This took Draco off guard. “What? Why?”
?’ even though they both knew very well what he’d been doing.
“Git,” Draco grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists before following Harry out into the entryway.
She finally looked at him.
A deep feeling of longing coursed through him at the thought. Emptiness. Nothingness. Death.
Draco walked inside, forcing his face to be as impassive as possible. Potter stared at Draco with the same defiant look he had given him when Draco had first walked into his hospital room, daring him to say something.
He wanted to slap himself.
He saw Potter’s face harden.
Malfoy hesitated.
Just because Draco was fine with not talking about how fucked they were didn’t mean that Harry was. Though…it didn’t seem Harry was especially keen on talking about it either. But Draco hated to think that Harry was suffering alone, or that he was hiding it from Draco, or that Draco was just meant to ignore it.
As soon as Harry had stepped foot in it, he was assaulted by countless memories of being in the house and the strong smell of weed. He inhaled shakily and stuck his hands in his pockets. Apparently oblivious to Harry’s discomfort, Johnny flopped down into his armchair and gestured toward the empty sofa beside it.
Draco’s eyes were wide but he seemed adamant, mouth set in a stubborn line.
“Well, y’know, I’ve been thinking about things – a lot of things – and, er, remember how I was asking you questions about, um...”
“There’s free drinks,” she said, which was a yes.
“Right,” Draco said, clearly not buying it. He then turned to Hermione and Ron, who were looking at him reproachfully. “And I should have known you’d become a ‘we’ couple.”
He stiffened under her gaze. Surely she wouldn’t do this here in front of everyone?
Harry found him later that day, of course, but had waited until Pansy and Patil had left before showing up.
“So,” Malfoy said, finally taking a seat, “What did you get me?”
"Yeah, that one. Anyway, they were talking when...Estrada came onto Malfoy."
“- you’ve got to keep treating him, the freak.”
Draco’s insides warmed at the compliment, but he tried to keep it from showing on his face.
Draco took his coat off before joining Harry on the bed, though his mind was still elsewhere. As heated as their exchange was just ten minutes earlier, an uneasy feeling had replaced Harry’s lust, settling in Harry’s chest like a heavy stone. Draco noticed Harry watching him and colored slightly.
“I understand, of course,” Selina said. Draco motioned for her to follow, and she did, speaking quietly as they walked. “I was just so shocked when I’d stumbled upon his body! Not every day you see the Chosen One passed out on the sidewalk, is it?”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
Hermione's arms were around him then, hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. He hugged her back, holding onto her as his hands trembled and eyes filled with tears, relieved that the weight was finally off his shoulders.
Harry moaned around Draco’s cock, partly because he did in fact, like it, but mostly because he lived for Draco’s reactions to the sounds Harry made during sex.
Ron eyed him distrustfully. “Mum’s home, too.”
“I’m gonna go over to theirs’, you want to come?”
“I was just thinking that I could probably carry you, so yeah, I
Weasley’s face was troubled as he stroked her bushy hair.
It felt like a dream. Like it wasn’t real. Harry didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to break the spell, this strange place where Draco Malfoy was just standing there, staring at him without menace, the harsh lighting emphasizing his marble-like features. The high cheekbones, pointy nose, and those perfect lips. His sleeves were still pushed up, leaving that tattoo partly visible.
“And this collection,” Draco said, kneeling to examine the disorderly stacks of tapes shoved into the cabinet, “Is pitiful.”
“Good night,” Draco said flatly before turning to head up the stairs.
Draco had snuck up on Harry as he was blabbering, his steady hands now on Harry’s shoulders.
It sounded strange coming out of M-Draco’s mouth and sent an odd shiver down Harry’s spine. Emboldened by this, Harry straightened up and smiled.
Purging was getting easier. He knew he was also getting sloppier, though, if the looks Pansy gave him were anything to go by. Despite this, Draco found he didn’t care. What could she do, anyway? Glare at him? Huff and scoff and pout until he started eating properly and kept it in?
Harry was on his knees in front of him. He lifted a hand and murmured a Summoning spell; the small bottle of lube came flying from one of the boxes in the room, and Harry caught it easily. Draco watched as Harry began slicking the lube across his fingers and his cock, his entire body thrumming with want. Finally, Harry met Draco’s eyes.
the covers before lying back down.
“Was that all? I thought we were going to have another surprise therapy session.”
“Dr. Julia Wolff’s office,” Harry called out as clearly as he could manage.
Kathy chose that moment to begin the session, calling their attention over to her.
“So Wolff helped you figure all that out, then?” Potter asked finally.
At the end of the hour, Wolff shook his hand again and told him that she looked forward to seeing him again next week.
It wasn’t his fault. It was definitely Potter’s fault, with his heavy panting, chest falling and rising as his sharp green eyes glared right at the Dark Lord’s, his generally messy hair even more mussed up and slightly damp where it touched his face. How dare Potter look so
“Excellent,” Kathy said. She glanced around the room, seeing if anyone else was going to talk. When no one did, she repeated, “Excellent. Right, so it sounds like it’s been a bit of a long week for some of you. We can hop right into it and go around and talk about how you’ve been doing recently. Would anyone like to start?”
