More like a dog than a cat, or a tiger, Harry thinks, a hulking white beast of a kneazle comes slinking dangerously into the living room.
“I’m worried about Sirius,” he says, wiping his mouth.
“Don’t
Lily Potter is on her feet in an instant, with grace.  “Look at you!” she cries, enchanted.  “Look at you, look at you, look at you, Harrypop-pop!”  She draws her son into a hug, arms around his shoulders and then her hands on the back of his head.  Harry stands there like a sack of potatoes, stunned.  “Oh, you feel like sunshine, babby owl.”
Harry somehow.”
“The world is not split into goodies and baddies down the line of Gryffindor and Slytherin –”  Harry’s been trying to get this message over for years, but against the rest of wizarding society the struggle’s long felt real.  Also against Ron’s sense of humour, as much as Harry loves him.
The moment holds for one cringe-worthy second before Lupin breaks out into an obscene snort of laughter, which makes Harry blink and look up from the floorboards.  Draco owes
.  “Mr Chaudhury, then.  Have you seen him since your return?  Would you like us to – ?”
“No,” Harry tells him, not sure why he’s asking.  He and Ginny are getting divorced.  “I like to think that I could’ve done, but I never did.  I’ve never done this before,” he explains.  “I’ve never had a home with homemade jam in it.  Molly’s always made it.”
“Your father was a highly skilled politician,” Lupin points out.  “Do you mean to suggest that becoming an academic was
“Master Harry is home now,” is all Kreacher says, his small body warm.  He pats a frail hand on his.
Draco writes back, definitely flirting.  He never takes Harry out; Harry’s quite taken aback.
The final detail is a nervous tic, he admits it.
“Ah, yes, Kreacher,” Draco addresses him through the fire.  “Is everyone still up?  I apologise for the hour, but I have a guest whom I think they’ll want to see.”
“Mm,” Lily makes a sound of mock-distaste.  She’s turning back to the desk.  “Sounds like the guff on the back of a bottle of wine.”
from one of the men behind the counters.  “I, er, I was here before Easter.”  They won’t remember him, Draco thinks.  By the time they arrived in this place on that trip, their routine for each shop had been timed down to less than a minute.  And Draco had agreed that they could stop for a quick half.  “I’d like to pick out an engagement ring.”
, is what he said.  You and Neville both.  Only till the war was over, you understand,” his mum qualifies sarcastically, before tutting.  “We never told your Padfoot and Moony, but we had a downer on him after that.”
“I hate Twiglets,” Ron tells him.  “Bloody awful things.”
Ron’s munching his sandwich.  “Mm,” he says, agreeing.  “Rosie reckons he’s fair.”
“It’s not about letting you in, Gin,” Harry told her, not looking at himself as he changed.  “It’s about whether or not you’re here.”
“Because I’m a liar?” he suggests.  That’s why it was needed.
Draco always forgot the specifics of these dreams in the end, but every time he found himself trapped in the moment when his eyes blew open, when the violent pulse of his heart made him certain that he was dead or that he’d killed someone else, and it always felt the same.
“Aha!” comes Hermione’s voice behind Harry, now, and she’s entirely sober, though it’s not easy to tell.  “I’VE FOUND HIM,” she shouts back to the house, coming down to sit by his side on the lawn, six months round.  “We were wondering where you’d gone.”
“You see?” Harry’s dad tried to tell him, starry-eyed.
“Oh, it’ll be a long time yet.”  He aims for humble, meaning
“Where are you going?” Draco asks shortly.
,” is the sort of thing that she’ll say over dinner, fired up like Harry hasn’t seen her in years.  “Take us beyond this zero-sum game…”
Hermione sits down with a dangerous-sounding harrumph.  “
Harry shrugs, rubbing his exposed arm free of goosebumps and taking up his wand to conjure fresh water into the glass on the nightstand.
There’s a
At the sound of his voice, quite vividly, quite suddenly, Draco imagines Harry taking Tom Riddle’s wand and snapping it.  Surely across a fulcrum of some kind – one of the gate pillars of Hogwarts, perhaps, half of the stick beneath his hand against the stone, the other pushing harshly until the wood splintered.
The words come out clipped, not in a sneer but something scathing nonetheless, the WWN turned waspish.
The greenhouse comes out a bit wonky, but it’s in direct sun and Harry thinks that it’ll function all right.  The playframe is holding one side of it up.
He meant the paraphernalia that Draco had just vanished, which traditional apothecaries still let one refer to as sheepgut and gutoil, because it was all a very fun game.  Thankfully, Draco’s conjuration was more than up to the task, else this evening would have caught him short.
Harry,” someone was saying, groaning.  It might have been Lee Jordan.  Harry felt his face burn.  “You’re making me feel old.”
He can’t breathe.
“Oh yeah?”  Teddy’s eyes are turning Black-family grey in his rage, neither pale nor dark, stone nor smoke under his heavy curling fringe.  “And where’s your dad?  I s’pose he hates you, and that’s why he’s stuck around.”
The wards were a new addition to the house from after the war, and Draco had always assumed that they were of Granger’s design.  From the way that Harry handled their lattices, however, it was clear that their forging had at least been a joint effort, if not an individual project of Harry’s.
“What
,” Harry sneered, holding his eyes, “for someone to tell you it’s fine.”
They’re left in the conservatory, with a clear view through the windows and roof as two quidditch has-beens, one never-been and a might-be rise up into the air.  They’re throwing the quaffle between themselves, attempting to aim it through the goal hoops that have been roughly spelled with black sparks, one near the house and the other at the end of the lawn, above the shed and the cherry tree.
“Just think, Haz, that could have been you,” Neville joked to liven up the proceedings, nodding towards the couple on the dancefloor.  They were laughing their way through the first dance; a photographer was taking a picture.
Emotion doesn’t flare from Draco’s expression so much as leak out, pooling and growing and expanding until he’s standing there, when Harry looks up, livid.
he writes, not concealing his grin.  He doesn’t mention Lupin.
He didn’t die, and Draco hadn’t won, but he did fall asleep for five minutes while Draco found himself lost in thought, fingers trailing up and down the bones of Harry Potter’s spine.  Primary school, he told himself to think, rather than anything else.  It was an odd phrase, and he’d never been sent to one.  Some of his peers had been sent to a preparatory school, of which there were two or three in the country, as far as he knew.  He supposed that they must be the same thing.  Draco’s mother had wanted him at home, and Pansy’s mother had too.
It makes Sirius laugh, the sound a brilliant snigger.  “
Harry contemplates the wand in his hand, holly with a phoenix-feather core, eleven inches.
“Really?”  Sara sounded pleased, as expected, taking Amy into her arms.  The child stared at Draco with a wise, blank expression, her hair tied up in a tuft on top of her head.  For some reason he immediately felt like crying, his eyes searing hot.  “That would be wonderful.”
this?
After a moment, Harry realises that the tiny version of him has made a joke.
Draco rolls his eyes, watching Lily Potter laugh with a grungy-looking man whom he doesn’t know.  “Because this is a party for the Order of the Phoenix, organised by your mother.”
Potter was laughing as the music changed, all sweat and heavy breath, blue light failing to catch him in his shadows and his secrets.  Draco reached out a hand for the man’s shoulder but instead found the nape of his neck, his digits hidden by the lighting design.  It didn’t keep Draco from feeling it, the hot sweat and thick hair in the curls of his fingers.  He swung in close, wearing black, feeling like a different person from who he’d been five minutes before.
“Have we gone back in time?” Ron demands, laughing at him.  “I think Martin Miggs had a get-up like that in one of the annuals.”
It wasn’t especially warm, this June day, but the sun was high in the blue Wiltshire sky.  Draco rubbed his arms as they made their way out from the shade of St Thomas’s church, feeling peeved.  As the day went on, he was going to see a good number of muggles wearing hooded jumpers of their own, which wouldn’t help with this particular feeling.  At the same time, the jumpers were most often going to be teamed with overly long frayed jeans which trailed on the ground where the muggles walked, dragging in dirt.  Warming up in the sun, of which he usually saw little, Draco was going to end up feeling torn, most of all.
Sirius answers quickly enough.  Too quickly.  “Nineteen-ninety-fi–” he begins, and Harry’s heart lurches.  “Fuck,” Sirius interrupts himself, pacing and staring at the grass.  “Six.  No.  No.
, you know?”
are you doing in here?” he asks coldly.
Draco stares at him.  He drinks more wine.
Draco sighs.  “Look, I will have to take you to my flat,” he says to Lupin’s blank face.
This makes the synapses click in Harry’s head.  “Are you saying –”
, he’s certain.  “Your love of old buildings,” he can’t help but add anyway, when he thinks of it.
They end up on Malfoy’s marriage to Astoria, again, which really means that they end up on sex.  “It was barely a secret, my sexuality,” Malfoy explains, drawling and laconic.  “I couldn’t get it up.  We would lie there in bed and she might as well have been made of balloons, or fired off in a kiln.”  His energy is entirely sex, talking about his own impotence.  He’s slouching languidly into the table.
Sunday morning, Malfoy hasn’t come home from work.  Harry went to sleep late, waiting up for him, and he finds himself rising late too.  He’s surprised, for the first time, to wake up alone.  It’s not a nice surprise.
“OK,” Harry agrees.  He’s heard Teddy’s views on Hogwarts before.  “Well, I think I fancy blokes,” he explains.
Black reads his way through them again, standing in the bell of the veil.  He does this several times over the period that passes next, sending the boot away and then back.  It always returns, but it doesn’t splinch, and that is probably progress given what they plan to do.
“Mm,” agrees Gary.
and it made his life a lot easier, really.
“I’m not sure that I’ve ever said I’m sorry,” Harry reports when he returns, putting down their pints on the table.  It’s a bright day, but Harry’s glad of his scarf.  Molly knitted it in green and pale grey, proud of her Slytherin grandchild no matter that all the others are in Gryffindor.  “You know,” Harry fumbles, “about Astoria…”
This does it.  “Oh – you
Granger turns a deep pink as Ron answers cheerfully, “Not nearly enough!”
The kettle’s on, and it’s Thursday again, and Draco wants to be something different, but he isn’t.  He is Draco Malfoy, and he is very, very gay, so very queer, so very needy, so very difficult, as he has been since he knew who he was.  He’s that ghastly poof-Puff dragon that George made, for some reason, for children, which Pansy did love and which lives on and on, because it’s more like a pet than a toy and won’t die, a fuzzy nonsense of faux fur and felt with endless delusions of grandeur.  A joke.  Always a joke.  A pathetic pastiche of something grand from a world long gone.
“It’s good of you to come,” Harry said awfully, but Dudley seemed happy nonetheless.
Moony says nothing, crossing his arms and breathing with one sniff.
“I imagined how you’d blame me, for leaving him in Azkaban.  In that
“I’ll see you later,” Harry interrupts himself, as though he’s said too much.
Rolling eyes.  “Goody, goody, rah, rah, hooray,” is the last that Harry hears from Sirius, droll.
Everyone comes out in the end.  Ron sits with Hermione, lolling an arm around her shoulders and twirling his fingers into curls, more relaxed than usual – “All right, mate?”
This goes on until Draco falls asleep.
“Not to listen,” James supplies, rolling his eyes.
“One for the office –” Draco’s going on, and it’s an invitation, at least, to wrench
,” he declares, and he’ll be holding the quill with his left hand, most likely, though Harry’s sure that he’s seen him cast with his right.  “
, and on his feet, then, he disapparates.
“You could have killed yourself, you reckless fucking imbecile,” Draco continued to splutter, clenching his hand into a fist around hair and looking for any sign of splinching, looking at the back of Harry’s neck and down to his calves.  “You could have…”  He could have sent himself into nowhere, Draco thought.  He could have splinched himself into nowhere…  It still wasn’t clear whether the Nowhere Room caught every case because
for a reason.”
As ever, the party’s taking place in the Ministry atrium, the ceiling above them peacock blue with gold twinkling lights, gilded fireplaces around them and everyone in dress robes.  Instead of the Fountain of Magical Brethren, there’s its replacement, blocky and not gold – a cataloguey beige-grey stone.
Harry ordered it anyway, because he likes to try new things and the elements together sounded good.  He’s always fallen into Draco’s traps.
.  He bore no boundaries and he felt no restrictions, Harry Potter.  He simply appeared when things turned to shit, maybe made them that way, maybe saved them from turning to worse, and he always smelled like fresh rock oysters, something warm and salt.
And that’s Lily’s voice, Harry hears, coming from his own back pocket.  She sounds tearful – and she looks it, when Harry’s flipped open the case.
“No,” Draco says, looking at the ring.  They’re after something for a witch, are they not?  Roses and feathers are appropriate reference points, and this thing belongs in a fairy tale.  “But I didn’t realise that this was a wedding to celebrate school unity.”
They’re staring at each other, and again Harry wonders how they ever got away with it.  He can’t read the look that they’re sharing, but he isn’t sure that he wants to.  It’s like something from a painting.
Draco wondered what they saw, looking at him, even as Luna spoke up.  “The posters say that it’s LGBTQ night,” she declared, vaguely.  “Q for Queer.”
Swallowing, Harry looks at him harder.  There’s an edge to him, and he’s occluding something now.  “Why are you angry with me?” Harry asks him, taking a guess.
“He contributed directly –”
,” he points out, as if this matters.  “I’m always with you, but it was the only time that we’ve done it that way.”  He barrels on, “All of it together.  Sleeping through the night after doing it.  Arriving and sticking close and snogging at the end of things.  The continuity, you know?  It was nice.  It had bearings.”
As intended, this brings Teddy rattling downstairs.  He looks hastily dressed, as though just in case.  “What? What is it?  What’s the matter?”
The house feels empty, when the children go back to school, but Teddy’s there and returned to his adult self; Harry catches him tidying from time to time, and he hears him talking on the phone to his grandmother, who’s always had a landline in her house.  They don’t talk about politics, but it sounds like they talk about Teddy’s namesake granddad a bit.
“That’s not the point –”
she says, not quite looking at the man.
"I know," Harry says quickly, and then he’s on his feet.  “But sometimes I think that I’m doomed to going round in circles forever with you and that’s not what I…  Will you stand up, please?”
He bites down on his teeth, and they’re all of them silent.
, Harry thinks, so he’s only about to take it in his stride.
Liz seemed to understand him perfectly, glancing at Luna and Draco, who were talking about something else, at the time.  “I’d rather your dad than the other wankers they’re planning to put on the shortlist.”  She said it dryly, as though Harry could understand her point just as well.).
The world shifts, and they’re returned to Draco’s office, all the books and the large, dark desk.
He’s driving Harry to distraction.  “I don’t know what I want,” is what he says, on his back, flapping his arms, grabbing Draco’s warm legs just above the knees because he suddenly realises that he can
There’s giggling, but then his mother is tutting, her voice floating with good humour, musical.  “James, no one wants to hear about
“You’ve
“I’m just saying that there’s time,” Harry insists, refusing to admit fault on the presents.  He stuck to his budget, mostly, for Lily and Albus.  “You’ve both still got a year of Hogwarts, for a start.”
,” Ron says.  “You said it yourself not five minutes ago.”
Harry Potter had no right, Draco thought.  No right to be
Being falsified, the licences aren’t strictly legal, but this shouldn’t be a problem as long as Harry and Draco don’t break anything they can’t fix.  They take the keys and they find the right parking bay and they put their bags in the boot before climbing into the front.  Draco takes the seat behind the wheel.
,” his dad complains, holding the last performance broom that Ginny palmed off on Ron.  It’s in perfect shape, really; Puds U changed sponsors halfway through the season a while back.  “One of us won your hand with our skills on a broomstick…”
“Ugh,” came a voice from behind them, where the muggles had put a ramp for some reason.  “I hate it when people bring their straight mates to gay night.”  He didn’t sound like the city they were in; he was London misplaced.
Suffering from the fate that Lupin and Black recognised themselves as suffering.
“Clever,” Draco manages, his heart constricting.
The game unravels, and Potter’s buying up supplies from the Broomsticks for what becomes the greatest Gryffindor party in anyone’s memory.  Potter and Dearborn share a tearful scene of parting in front of the common-room fireplace, clutching each other’s arms and promising the world that they’ll always have Herbology.
“Stop needling me; I don’t fancy Moony!” Harry complains, hands in the air.  “You are
“Malfoy, I’m begging you,” Harry tells him now in his arms, his breath hitching.  His words are difficult to hear, muffled by Draco’s blank-slate-black towelling dressing gown.  “Please let me be something else.”
The look between them is heavy, and neither of them is flirting the way that they were flirting before, but now, if it wasn’t so quiet – now,
McGonagall steps forward –
This year, somewhere halfway through the Summer Exhibition, Harry finds himself looking at a still life.  It’s nothing special, he doesn’t think; the ones in the National are nicer, more complex.  It’s a round-bottomed, Mediterranean-blue vase containing a spray of leaves and flowers, sitting next to an orange on a sludgy brown table, against a black background.  His eyes are drawn to the flowers most of all, each a puff of long, floppy petals, white against fronds of leaf green, veined and pure.  The piece is only the size of a textbook, an unframed canvas.
“Trudging through the countryside,” complains Draco about what he’s been up to, as though it’s not a secret.  He’s always complaining; Harry’s not sure that he knows how else to talk.  “Your ex-husband is bored and his job keeps him much too much fit and active.”
Charging up the steps, Harry has no plan at all.  There’s no bell to ring, nor a knocker.  The door opens for him and an elf is just inside.
no me and Pansy.  Merlin.”  Though he misses her, the slag.  Of course he does.  He misses Goyle too, perhaps, a little bit.  From before he and Crabbe learned the Cruciatus and they both lost their sense of fun.
“It’s a simple charm, to capture a memory,” expounds Harry’s dad.  “The camera’s a rudimentary pensieve.  It’s said that you get a more accurate picture by not using your wand, but that’s nonsense, theoretically…”
This isn’t right, Harry thinks, but it’s not as though he can say anything about it.
“And I don’t know what you were talking about when you left,” Draco goes on, as though he’s spent a lot of time reflecting on it, not sounding like a toddler, thank Merlin.  “You cannot believe that the wolf doesn’t prefer you – over all of us.  He’s my responsibility,” he claims arrogantly, half-joking.  “He took a wife from the family and now he’s fucking her cousin.  He’s a Black through and through; he’s passed the test…”  Draco strokes Harry’s jaw.  “This doesn't mean we
Draco was finishing his dissertation, back in 2004, because he was not yet qualified as an unspeakable, and he worked in the Department of Mysteries only as a student.  He had not yet conceived of his project to free Sirius Black from the veil.  Instead, he was working on the Killing Curse, because no one ever had, because it was important, and because his memories provided more than enough of a dataset.
– but Teddy cuts over him, casting a spell on his butterbeer to make it foam.  Something from Hufflepuff, Harry imagines.  “No one’s dead, Dad,” he says, drinking from his bottle with enthusiasm now.  “Stop worrying.”
With a roll of his eyes, Harry slumps onto his back.  “Auntie Dromeda told me that everyone knew about Sirius.  Just not talked about it properly, you know?”
,” insists Sirius, sounding put out.  “You don’t –”
The man shrugged again, resisting.  “Did Teddy like my present?” he asked, changing the subject.  “How’s Auntie Dromeda?”
He’d have to trust his instincts, but they’re clearly on his side, in this car, and he can see how fast the other cars are moving –
But then – Longbottom takes to a knee and pulls a box from his pocket, right there in the road.  He asks Dearborn, will she marry him?  Will she throw aside Potter for a man from the Dales?
“You don’t know what you’ve…
James shrugs, as though this isn’t of interest.  “Sirius took him out drinking.”
“Merlin…”
Lupin looks at him down his crooked nose.
He tells Teddy that he’s going over to Draco’s.  He’s entirely gaslit his godson about what happened on Valentine’s Day, telling him that he, Harry, was the one who told Draco that they needed to cool things for a bit because he was going to be busy at work, no matter that there was no way Harry should have known this until the next day.  “I need to apologise and catch up, you know.”
Harry was intending to pop by Draco’s after seeing Ginny.  They haven’t made explicit plans, but this felt like what they were doing.  Instead, Harry sends Spearow to fob Draco off and settles into a fume – puts on his hat and his Barbour again to fume over a beer and his beer-making book in the Leaky, like an old man, because the house is too empty when Kreacher knows to stay out of his way.
, when they’re trying to explain why there’s no jam today.  Individuals can be all over the shop, but wizards have a tendency too, to say that someone else has the jam.  We don’t consider the past very much – wizards and
“Well, fuck it, Prongs, I hate her,” Sirius tells him, quite evenly, shrugging, vindictive.  He starts scratching at his hand again, and Harry feels urgent to move.  “I’m not glad she’s dead, because she was on our side and she was Dromeda’s and she was pleasant enough in a slightly boring, unjaundiced way…”
Moony’s grin turns almost obscene, because he’s very much definitely won.  “On occasion,” he suggests, as though he’s above it all, and he offers two patronising pats to Sirius’s knee.
,” she expands.  “You capture your audience and you make them see – you say, this isn’t
They arrive at the stile when Draco gives in.  “My mother –” he begins to explain the wards, climbing up the wooden steps and over, but –
“So,” Ron mocks him as they all sit down at a sticky wooden table, “the important stuff.”
Spotting it, Harry feels a flush of something warm, and finds his anger turning into something else.
“That’s just another word for
“You said that you hated me,” Draco tells him, before he can stop the words.
“She told me that you did.”
“He used
There’s silence again, and it’s long.
“And Scorpius’s dad told Scorpius to tell you this?” Harry asks, feeling annoyed.  He only wanted Draco not to have to sit on his own at a quidditch match, and now all this –
He loves the boy who lived, like everybody else.
Then Draco turns his head back, and Harry turns his head towards him, crooking up his elbow to prop his head on his fist.  They’re a little less than armslength away from each other, which is certainly too close, especially in company.  Neither of them pulls away.
She takes another drag on her cigarette, rolling her eyes.
This is a dig about something or other.  Kneeling on the floorboards, elbow throbbing, backpack open, Harry feels as though he’s been caught in the act.
It’s a tree that promises peace, because it’s a tree that needs peace to grow.  It’s almost self-sufficient, and it can adapt to survive many things, but it takes a good many years to settle and bear fruit.  After that, when it’s ready, it offers more than anyone could ask for: fruit and oil to last all four seasons, every year, generous and kind.
“Let’s at least get a drink with Luna at the Broomsticks.”  Harry wants to be with him where everyone can see.  Certain people anyway.  People he likes, one or two of them, while he still has the nerve.  He squeezes his legs closer to himself, against temptation.  “Ollivander’s come all this way.”
Harry’s lost somewhere unreal, a lucid dream which could easily become a nightmare.  He tries anyway, moving forward to be brushed off, shouldered back.  “All right, Dad –”
family in
“Your mum’s flooing the pubs,” James declares, as though Harry has asked, as though they’re moving on.  “She’ll have them watch out for Padfoot; she’s very persuasive.”  He leaves the spoons in the tureen and picks up a fork with his left hand, stabbing quills.
Another few seconds, and with a
“You’re such a baby –” immediately Albus retorts, still embarrassed.
If there’s a story to this, Harry thinks, he doesn’t want to know.
Both Draco and Harry were going to father children and repopulate their names.  It was two-and-a-half years since Draco’s parents had died, and they would have pointed out long ago that neither he nor Harry was going to get anywhere if they only spent parties in each other’s company – don’t make me spell it
is on his lips, and the boot vanishes away.  A reverse flick of two precise twirls would be expected to bring it back, just like every time before.  This time, however, the boot doesn’t come.
Harry’s mum rubs his back as he hiccoughs, and she’s smaller than him.
Draco’s other arm is stretched down the back of the sofa, maroon – it ends with him holding his beer.  He turns, shifting into Harry’s feet.  “And when you last enjoyed it?” he asks, his thumb pressing hard up into the reconstructed arch of Harry’s foot.
Remus interrupts, very clipped.  He doesn’t raise his voice.  He must have sent a patronus ahead for the floo to be open; he’s urgent as though he hasn’t paused for one second since sending it.  McGonagall must have been here for another meeting – it will be near the end of term.
“Go and sit things out for a bit,” Ginny tells him, forever better at whatever this is than him.  Like Neville, who’s always had it under control.  Like Matías, most likely; why not?  “Go outside and look up.”
“You’re all making a fuss over nothing,” declares Sirius.  His eyes are flat, when Harry catches them.  “Where’s your sense of humour?” he adds as though they’ve bored him.
“I won’t tell Harry about Dudley, I don’t think,” Luna said eventually, as though to herself.  “At least not for now.  It will only cause a bother.”
“Plan what?” asks Draco sullenly, hunched and alert with his wand in his hand and the atlas in his lap, his seatbelt dark beige and strange across his black muggle shirt.  He catches Harry looking, his eyes panicked and flashing.  “Keep your eyes on the road!”
ridiculous, when he says it out loud.  Harry finds himself huffing a snort.  He’s tingling with terror.
Their bare feet squelch into mud as Harry pulls them both closer, one hand twitching to bat at Draco’s thigh, closing in a fist on the cock that is waiting for him.  He locks a knee behind Draco’s and an arm behind his shoulders, while Draco lets his own hands close to fists against Harry’s scalp.  Their faces are close together, noses and tongues and noise as they kiss so much harder than before.  Harry’s muttering something, the sound running on, but it doesn’t make sense.
” Harry begs lines of silver, wanting to forget.  “Somebody has to –”
“Hermione was fine with it –”
“I promise,” he said desperately, putting a hand on Draco’s shin over the covers, just under his knee.  “You don’t understand; you used to touch me and I…”  He squeezed, working up to Draco’s kneecap and shaking his head.  “It’s all the old hate, yeah?  It’s like a reflex.  It
“We do not attend as ourselves, Harry,” Draco told him, pulling his dark green jumper over his head, sleeves scuffed up so the snake was visible on his arm.  “We attend as delegates for our children, to gather intelligence.”
“Draco…” Harry finds himself saying, as the facts of this sink in.  Draco doesn’t drop his gaze, and Harry brushes his spare hand through blond hair.  “You –”
Retreating, Harry takes the call in the lavender-purple living room upstairs – but it’s the same conversation, it turns out.
is not a good reason.
these days.
The lightbulb blows at this point, and Harry’s wand’s in his hand to cast
“You’ve always been the protagonist to me, Gin,” Neville’s saying down the way, the suave so-and-so.
Malfoy looks at him, unimpressed.  “One cannot ride a motorbike while making homemade jam,” he says, as though he thinks that Harry could pull off a motorbike all right.
“I never said that,” Harry said, shaking his head.  “I’m saying…  If we could keep them inside the house – or another one,” he suggested, tracing his fingers along the angles of Draco’s urgent face, brushing tails of hair from his eyes.  “Somewhere that I don’t have to deal with them at the same time as everything else…”
was clipped and northern – from one of the cities, not Longbottom’s North.  She had three bottles of butterbeer in her other hand, her fingers spread-eagled around their necks.  “Here you go, Draco,” she said with a smile, pushing one into his hands.
Their hotel is in the middle of nowhere, apparently, and the roads mostly find them on their own.  They’re in Champagne for the next couple of days (“Where else would we start?”); they have to spend a few minutes on the motorway to get out of Reims, but Harry doesn’t think about it.
Even as he continues to recite, as Sirius continues to draw, Sirius is giving Harry sharp instructions.  “Trace that over these before the ink dries,” he says, referring to Harry’s water and the runes.  “Remember,” he adds sophistically, and Harry’s always liked it when things are phrased this way, “you’re not tracing water to the ink; you’re tracing ink to the water.”
This earns him a huff of frustration, and Harry knows how Sirius feels.  “Well, you’re not me,” he concludes, ironic, looking at James with an odd expression on his face, raised eyebrows.  Harry can’t read it.  A smile pulls at his mouth, something almost a laugh.  Harry doesn’t know if he wants to be able to read it.  “I couldn’t give a fuck,” he says, the word coming out of him as easily as it comes out of Malfoy.  “What is it to me, the bollocks Remus tells other people?”
“Sorry,” he says.  How the fuck did this become routine?  “I mean…  Merlin.”  He sighs and starts from the beginning, attempting to sound sincere.  “Welcome to the Department of Mysteries, Ministry of Magic.  It’s 2008.  Just turned April.  The war that you remember ended, but there was another in the 1990s.  Everything is well now, and the joke is that I am on good terms with your son Harry, who should most likely hear about your return.”
“Yeah,” Harry tells him, because that’s the whole
The stag ducks its head, as though it’s interested in the grass.  The performance makes Harry snort.
“What do you mean, you did this?” Hermione insists on asking, a frown across her forehead.  “I don’t understand.”
“How long has this been going on?” Draco asks about the nightmares.
The Gryffindor-Slytherin, Slytherin-Gryffindor quidditch match takes place on a blustery Saturday towards the end of May.  The parents’ stand remains expansive, rows separated with different families sitting seats apart.  The Gryffindor and Slytherin parents are sitting as far apart as the stand will allow.  This feels familiar: it’s difficult to remember a time before social distancing laws – when the thought of such a rule was dystopian – and space has always been a luxury.   Harry’s never had much to say to the other Slytherin dads, and they’ve never mingled at the pub with the Gryffindors.  A few couples are still wearing masks, in the summer of 2021, and by this point Harry expects they always will.
He chose a cherry tree because he loved it, he thinks, that place, in blossom and fruit.  He chose a cherry tree because he hated it, and a phoenix-core wand is always made to make things burn.
Suspense in his stomach, Harry feels like he’s flying straight towards the ground and his body’s been bound, his broom jinxed.  He won’t be able to to pull up.
“Luna made me see it,” Harry tells him defiantly, pushing his face into Draco’s hand.  “You don’t know how much I wish that it had been me, but it was her.”  His words are quick and they mostly escape into Draco’s palm, which he kisses.  “She feels the same thing,” he promises, as Draco squeezes his eyes shut for a moment.  “She gets lost, and I get lost, and it only gets better when I find you.”
Mrs Figg says as little Harry dutifully takes off his shoes, wrenching at Velcro efficiently.
Today it seems that Draco’s calculations for the vanishing spell are correct, because his canary is here, trilling happily as it flits around the softly lit room.  There’s a pang in his chest as he attempts the second stage, but his wand moves unerringly, meaning to vanish the canary to the veil, possibly to its death.  It disappears to somewhere, at least, with a pop that ends its song.
“Some sort of wild cat, we thought,” Lupin explains to Harry.  “A lynx or a mountain lion.”
is nonetheless a second too late.  “Get out of there –”
They continue in silence, and Harry stews.  At times like this, his frustration is legitimate irritation, he’s sure, because that wasn’t the point of his speech and the idea that it was makes Harry sound like a dick.
He only knows about olive trees from what he’s read.  The fruit is green now, with autumn; it will turn black and soft by December.  It could be picked at any time, but will always need curing.  The roots of the tree will spread wide and shallow, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions.  It’s not a tree of its place, but it’s difficult to transport.
“Put that down, for fuck’s sake,” Draco tells him, plucking the stick from his hand with an indolent tweak.
Harry looks down at the vial again.  “Can’t I see yours first?”
.  Draco was called to the kitchens once and he can’t even imagine it now.  His mind refuses, whether through occlumency or pure self-preservation.
Draco’s looking at him.
“At its core,” Hermione now poses the question, meeting Harry’s eyes with brown, “what is a wedding but a ritual of light magic?  It’s a ritual of blessing,” she insists, “and they’re never efficient, by design.  It’s a transfer to me and Ron – our relationship – but it’s also a great release, shared by everyone who’s with us, as long as they wish us well.”
“What are you
“She wants to change back the name,” Draco says about Hermione, and Harry’s focused entirely on the sound of his voice, shivering a little even now, inside his skin.  “I don’t know what to tell her…  I refuse to share a name with
It’s a mistake.  “If you think that Ron and I sit down with Harry and have long talks about his
“Is it a sin to be intimate with one’s fiancée?  Is it a sin for two old friends –”
“Er,” Harry says, because he forgot to anticipate this question.  “Well.”  He resists the urge to say that it’s not anyone’s business (“You’re a public figure, Harry,” Hermione’s said.  “It
Draco looks at him, his grey eyes amused.  “I sent in a note to a journal two years ago.  They couldn’t replicate the result.”
” she asks, completely ignoring this cue and making Harry startle, blinking her huge dark eyes and their eyelashes – and Harry knows it’s all make-up, but it’s mesmerising.  “He came out of the womb needlessly dramatic.”  And Harry agrees that this is
“James, sit down.  You’re making a spectacle of yourself.”
“What secrets,” states Malfoy, with arrogance –
“My mother changed the family allegiance,” Draco says quickly, glancing at Lupin, because this is true, even if it’s entirely irrelevant to a conversation about merpeople.  “Reverted to type and played out a good old-fashioned Black doublecross in the final moments of the war.”
“That’s a new one on me,” Lupin tells him, a tick in his jaw as he takes another drag on his cigarette.  His slipper twitches.  “And don’t call me
With a pang, Harry’s stomach feels hollow.
She’s not wrong, Draco supposes.
She has a wand in her hand, and it’s a pale, cool brown which makes Draco think of the countryside and the year’s first outing on the water.
This interruption starts off firm from Dumbledore, but by the end he seems to find himself at a loss.
“Yeah, thanks; it’s great,” Dudley said, nodding around at all the witches and wizards.  “I like the streamers.”
“There’s something off about her, though,” Potter explained as they pushed the button for the crossing and waited.  “She’s a little toddler with her, but – I don’t think that’s it.”
“That’s fifty points from Slytherin, Mr Potter, and you can see me every night this week at seven.”  Right, Harry remembers, looking to the desk and the angry Scottish witch.  Minerva’s still here.  She’s learning how much his children swear.  “You can be sure that Professor Sinistra will hear how poorly you have represented Slytherin House.”
“You let me call you John,” dismisses Sirius, presumably lying.  “I was there when you changed your CV.”  This might be the truth.
“Blimey,” Harry says, mocking him, his voice a sing-song.  His head is warm and heavy in the crook of Draco’s shoulder, his arm resting lightly on his chest.  “Someone’s feeling cheery today.”
“It’s safe and stuff, yeah?” Harry asks her, because he didn’t get the chance to look up anything before the start of September.
Indignant, Ron defends Harry before Harry can defend himself.  “Malfoy couldn’t get it up; she’s the one who drank his hair!”  They’re all laughing, though Harry might be forcing the sound.  “I’m dead proud of you, mate,” Ron goes on, straight-faced, patting Harry patronisingly on the upper arm.
“Are you talking to Neville, Harry?” Luna asked him over the tablecloth, unimpressed.  “It doesn’t sound like you are.  You and Neville are good friends.”
They’re talking about Harry, Harry realises, when he tunes back into the conversation.
“So you are still quite capable of abstracting all significance from the action?”
He was being a dick.  He flares up when he feels threatened.  It’s a useful reaction when people who hate him are trying to kill him.
not believe in the difference between conjuration and apparition?”
Staring at him, Harry finds himself so outraged that he doesn’t know what to say.  He finds himself pulling his hat from his head and spinning the thing at Draco like a star.  “Fuck you, you fucking dick.”
plans for the manor?” he pulls out of nowhere.  “To rid it of the Dark Lord's trace?”
you?” Malfoy spits, switching his wand through the air but too controlled to let loose a spell.
Looking out into Wisteria Walk, Lupin idly buffs his nails against the palm of his other hand.  He’s listening in.  Harry’s not sure if it’s supposed to be obvious.
“Bollocks I have,” says Sirius shortly, as Buckbeak caws, dropping his head to work at the grass.  “Did you intend for your wand to explode?”  Sirius doesn’t give Harry a second to answer.  “I saw your face and Malfoy saw what happened; the answer is
And yet in the space of five minutes they seem to have forgiven each other.  “It’s a shame about Harry,” George begins again, as though the argument is nothing to remember.  The sound of his own name makes Harry start.  “Mum’s worried about him.  He’s been avoiding her; she’s got herself in a right tizz.”
“I like her,” Harry tells Teddy as he snorts, all piercings and blue.  “Why haven’t you brought her round before?”
This was the end of the negotiation.
“You won’t lose me, you know,” Draco tells him, tracing Harry’s face with his fingers.  It makes Harry shiver, so he pulls up the duvet to keep them warm.  “Anywhere I go, I’ll be hunted down and dragged back by the scruff of my neck.”
a hero, not that Harry much believes in the word.
“Of course you’re coming back with me,” Pansy tells him, without a single false note of doubt, smugly taking a drag.  “And I’m sorry, but I don’t hear the difference between the two words you’re saying…”  She smiles and Harry rolls her eyes.  “I’m here to collect you,” she insists.  “You’re going to apparate me to the front step like a gentleman, or else to the hallway like a rogue.”
“What a fucking mess, you fucking idiot,” Ron’s saying.  He tilts back in his chair and kicks Harry with the flat of his cold socked foot, which makes Harry laugh.  “It’s not funny!” he insists, but Hermione’s tittering too.  “I bet you’ve no plan at all,” he says, scratching his long nose and then gesturing.  “I had a whole list of rebounds lined up.”
.”  Potter is disgusted, Draco thinks, and bitterly angry.  It’s never been about Harry at all, has it?
“What’s the plan?” Harry mocks him, always amused by the great shame Teddy feels, to have grown up with money.  “Get a bedsit and entertain her in style?”
“I dunno why Ron hasn’t proposed yet,” Harry complained, his eyebrows high.  “It’d be such a fun wedding.”
One of Harry’s old puzzleboxes is the last thing to emerge from the backpack, from when Harry was learning runes.  A sphere of harlequin marquetry, engraved.  Kreacher wasn’t able to open it, which led Harry to decide that he was ready to start writing wards.  The box itself isn’t important – Harry’s sure that it’s an amateur effort, compared to what he could manage these days – but there are the most precious things of all hidden inside, now landing on the bed: the shard of Sirius’s mirror; his mother’s letter; the snitch from his first game at Hogwarts, which will always remind him of the exhilaration he felt at eleven, to discover freedom and the connection between him and his –
Harry gives Moony a sharp look, because he’s being obtuse.  “You can have a family and keep yourself invisible,” he says.
He did the Dark Lord’s bidding, Wormtail, and no one would
For the first time in twenty-two years, now, Harry acknowledges what he must have always known somewhere in his head, that Teddy and Malfoy are related.  This’ll be worse for Teddy’s image of his family than his grandmother, Harry thinks.  And his real middle name is Hope.
“No hyphen, though,” Hermione insists, narrowing her eyes.  “I can hear it in your voice.”
Draco shrugs, still looking at the green grass around them.  It makes sense.
“And the rest of it,” Draco says.  Not like you’re thinking, he means.  “Forgot his trainers,” Draco recalls.  “Snuck his way in, made a mess of himself, ended up curled on his side like a baby.  All for what?  Again, little more than five minutes of inane conversation.”
He forgets that he’s alone, that they’re not all going home together.  He forgets that he owns a massive house, which one day he’ll have to return to.
“Oh,” he finds himself saying, looking at it.  “Thanks, Kreacher.”
Harry nods, appreciative.  “We’d get stuck, trying to talk to each other,” Harry tells Hermione, rather drunk, he feels with a turn.  “I could tell that Gin was worried about…”  He drinks wine, shaking his head.  “But she wouldn’t
Then Harry kisses him again, hard, and it’s stupid, but Draco knows that what he’s said to Harry is true.  It always rains on the British Isles, but never for long.  Here the weather is as fickle as the seasons.
“That’s a better question,” Draco points out.  He nudges his face into Harry’s like a big cat, as though he fancies him and wants him to calm down, even if he knows better than to suggest it.  He can imagine a hundred things going wrong, Harry’s well aware.  Presumably he’s occluding them.  He occludes a lot of stuff.
This is awful, Draco thinks.  This is the most awful fucking thing that’s ever fucking happened to him.  His heart is pounding, and it’s really worked too hard today.  He can feel its pulse all over him, in his head.
“Not quite,” Potter corrects.  “In fact –”  He brightens, looking around at his audience, which is mostly constituted by Percy Weasley and his attachments plus Angelina, now a Weasley by name and by law.  “I played a crucial role in one of your father’s more romantic endeavours.  Imagine the scene…”
rumours, whenever it was, but that man you were with – he’s not…?  Of course I would never…  It’s only that my Enid will be
Instead, Harry gets up, and at Hogwarts he goes running.  His rooms are on the second floor, and they’re close to the entrance hall.  From here he makes his way down to the forest, past Hagrid’s hut, the chimney of which is often letting out its very first tendrils of smoke.
“Yeah,” Harry tells him.  He doesn’t want to take it back, he finds out.  And he can only imagine Draco’s reaction, if he’s listening, but he carries on anyway.  “As far as I’m concerned, that’s done and dusted…  I mean, you’d have to ask him if he agrees –”
“I’ve never understood gazing at the sea,” Sirius is saying, and he’s being very slow to catch on, Harry thinks.  “It’s boring as all mercy; it’s water.”
“I trust that it was to your satisfaction?” Draco asked, attempting to make a joke as he tucked his wand back under the pillow, vanishing complete.  “The bed,” he pointed out.
“I don’t know how you feel,” continues Lupin, doggedly, “but no one shops their friends of seven years and feels nothing.”  He taps ash to the decking, still looking away.  “Peter,” he says, and it’s the same name as before.  “I’m sure that he must have
“Was that the only reason you asked?” continues Malfoy forthrightly, smirking as though he already knows.  “Blissful ignorance?”
“Where’s Moony now?” Harry demands, outside the gates of Hogwarts.
“It’s not Luna I’m talking about,” Malfoy mocks him.  “It’s her wife.”
His voice has become a little short by this point.  Ron frowns at him, and he lets the rant burn out.
It hit Ginny harder than anyone would have expected, her youngest child going to Hogwarts, and her husband was only coming home to sleep.  She was embarrassed; she didn’t do being maternal, so she didn’t understand…
Harry’s always shrugged.  “I’ve got my wand with me,” he points out, letting Hagrid assume that he runs with a light.  He far prefers to let his eyes adjust, to feel it as the night becomes dawn.).
Harry grins at him, because he decided this when Draco was away and he was dreaming, and now it’s coming true.  “I love that I can take you to the DMLE do, and no one will dare say a single fucking thing.”  He should have realised this after coming out to his children.
He’s just lonely, Harry thinks to himself, once they’ve gone.  Kreacher’s gone to bed and Teddy’s still out.  He’s lonely and desperate.  He gave Ron and Hermione their hamper and they were embarrassed; it was all much too much.  Harry told them he loved them and that he always would.  Ron said that he didn’t need to prove that; they knew.  Hermione was crying from the booze.
“You did?” Draco flirts with him, pretending.  “Which one?  I’ve had a hundred.”
“The masters and mistress are recently withdrawn,” Kreacher says, “with Mr Potter.”  He’s inclining his head, bowed in attention where he stands in the parlour.  “But number 12 is always open to Mr Malfoy.”
“There’s symmetry to it,” Lupin said, as though gathering strength.  As though he wasn’t lying.  He looked up, and his expression was odd.  His eyes were red.  “Why would you change it?” he demanded, just as short as Harry.  “Go on; tell me more about how it all fits together.”
.  Also, he thought that they’d been busy with the cause of the gay liberation.  “When have you been doing that?”
Draco Malfoy –?”
,” hisses Sirius, impatient.
“Kreacher,” Harry says when he returns to number 12.  “I think we need a greenhouse.”  With a
“Mistress Hermione’s charms rise for five-thousand feet,” Kreacher says, as though he knows.
Harry stares at her.  All he can think is, “You’ve been talking to Andromeda.”  The woman who buried a muggleborn, a halfblood and a werewolf in the grave plot of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.
With a snort, Harry looks away to the overgrown whatever-it-is climbing up the garden wall’s trellis.  Neville would know.  It’s a romantic sentiment, Hermione’s, though judging by Ron’s continuing laughter, he’s confused.  Harry’s not feeling like romance today.  “I’m pretty sure that’s pansexuality,” he interrupts, because he’s been reading one of Teddy’s books.  Teddy’s gained a muggle girlfriend over the summer, who studied Sociology.  “Are you sure that’s not you instead?”
“You wear proper shirts for Malfoy?” Harry asks rhetorically, surprised.  He’s never worn one for Andromeda.
His mother continues, her sarcasm thick, her expression open and serene.  “We can be grateful that Draco’s Aunt Bella is no longer with us,” she says, adjusting her hat.  “At least for now.  Far be it from me to complain about family, but her courtesy as a house guest always left something to be desired.  Of course one is willing to host her little pets, as many as she likes, but lifting blood from the floorboards, well, when one’s elves would rather boil their heads than enter the East wing…”
is one of the reasons professional witches and wizards like to live in the city, because otherwise the owls have further to fly.  Despite himself – and he’s a senior professional; such things come with the territory – Harry tries not to wake up at five o’clock in the morning unless there’s an explicit reason why he should.  Today, Kreacher presents him with the paper and a pretence that last night Harry requested breakfast in bed.  “Before the important meeting, Master Harry.  Very early.”
Hermione is fuming, but she’ll always back him up, Harry knows.  He’d do the same for her.  There are some things that it’s impossible to go through together without eliminating all other options.
Still looking down, Harry bites, chews and swallows.  He should be doing better than this, he thinks, given the adjustment to the wards.  He can feel all four of them faintly, when they’re home, as though they’re really here.  He feels his dad in his feet and his mum in his hands, Sirius in his throat and Lupin in his teeth, weird though that is.  He feels a little like the tingle of stripped plaque.
Eventually, on sabbatical, Harry’s urge to rant fizzles out, and the first person he asks for advice is his godson, in October.  He only realises that he’s doing it when it’s done.
Lily Potter rolls her eyes.  “Well, then we had Flitters and Pomona, who spent most of their time getting squiffy, and they thought that we didn’t know.  Meanwhile, McGonagall was as soft as a teddy bear, so no one took her seriously.  Saw us all as her babbies.”
James is jumping, bright red, looking for the voice.  Cassie and the team are all laughing; one her teammates offers a high five.  Lily looks devastated, and Harry makes plans to give her a hug.
“But you don’t like to wake people up,” Ron finishes the sentence, understanding.
Lupin shoots him a look as if to ask,
“Oh, you know your father,” his mother says lightly, and it’s not reassuring.  “He’s receiving some guests at the house, and I’m loath to disturb them.”  A smile.  “One of them thinks that he’s found a Deathly Hallow,” she drops in, as though it’s of passing relevance.  “So of course they’re all plotting.”  Boys will be boys and men will be men, she might as well be saying.  “Bring back the Dark Lord, stoke the Ministry to chaos…”  She shrugs with elegant leisure.  “The world is their sickleclam.”
Lupin shakes his head, tutting as he pops his own stick back in his mouth and collapses into one of the red metal chairs, snapping the case closed once more.  “Only if you want the whole thing to go up in flames.”  He inhales, then takes the cigarette back in his hand, sighing.  “It’s an old Moodyism, not to carry lighters, but it was always a pain in the…  Think
“I don’t need to hear about any of this,” Harry complained, not even sure that he was hungry for breakfast.  A boiled egg popped onto his plate in an egg cup, because Kreacher liked to nudge him.
Harry feels his face drop.  All of him drops.  “What?” he asks before he can stop himself.
“I must go,” Draco declares.  “The veil is a hazard.  The iron boundary is insecure.”
But Malfoy doesn’t reply, Harry’s seducer.  His hands are resting at ten and two on the steering wheel, and after seconds of looking, like the tick of a watch, Harry sees them twitch.  He’s staring out of the windscreen, out beyond the car park to the road, and his expression is more distant than that.
Malfoy grins at Teddy, and Harry’s not sure that he’s ever seen such love in his expression.  He and Scorpius are both guarded when Harry sees them together.
the boy continues as if by rote, the words awkward as he says them –
Lupin laughs – a deep, rolling sort of cackle.  The feeling of it seems to have been unexpected.  He looks at Black with stark, bright affection, a glare of winter sun.
he states plainly, cutting like a knife, and Harry winces, rubbing at his eyes under his glasses, so embarrassed…
the ballad of Harry’s beloved Ron and Hermione, and Draco wonders if this is the full or real reason for the scowl on Harry’s face.
It’s terrible.  Draco can’t look the man in the eye.  “We can take the back route,” he says, cradling his nerve.  “My parents won’t know if we don’t apparate.”  He nods over Potter’s shoulder, towards the woodland at the rear of the common, which collapses into countryside eventually.  “We can pass through the trees over there.  It’s only a couple of miles.”
When he turns back to reality, Teddy’s pressing a hand to his cheek, anarchy ring on his finger.  He sighs comically.  “Don’t fuck this up, Pika-dad,” he says when he’s talking again, his expression weary and Hufflepuff, his eyebrow pierced.
Aunt Petunia doesn’t listen to this.  She rings off with a perfunctory thank you and goodbye.
His gaze is sharp, nonetheless.  The combination has long done a funny thing to Harry’s insides.  “Yeah, mirrors,” he says, not trying to be obtuse.  It comes easily.  “Two-way mirrors.  Like a less glitchy version of that thing Hermione uses to talk to her parents.”
, and if you come near him Harry Potter will –”
From the way that Potter stiffens, it’s clear that he’s understood.  The feeling in Draco’s chest.  The prospect of it all.  The location.  Draco’s
The ginger and tabby cats from before are circling near to Snowy’s side.  The white kneazle meows, and another tabby comes in from the hall.  Making Harry jump, a black-and-white patched thing comes leaping down from a cabinet in a clatter of claws – then to the mantelpiece to the television to the carpet, the sound ominous in the silence.
,” he says, as though the possibility has never crossed his mind.
” she continues, with more Old English on repeat until bright white runes wink on and off in concentric circles, chiming with the sound of bells on the floorboards beneath them.
,” he repeats.
“I should make you understand,” Draco told him, breathlessly.  Because there was no such thing as straightforward exchange.  Not for Harry Potter.
The current Puddifoot’s menu boasts every kind of coffee-shop coffee, with a long list of options for syrups and toppings.  Then there are the ridiculous cupcakes, more icing than cake by proportion, approximately half of Honeydukes littered on top of each one.
“So, you and Harry,” Longbottom says, as though they’re friends.  As though he hasn’t just been listening to a story that his parents should have told him on his mother’s knee.  “When’s the wedding?”
Draco glances at the others, trying to work out if they’re following.  Harry’s looking down and Granger’s looking away, her boyfriend looking at her.  So, yes, presumably, and it’s nothing that Draco wants to know.
“I couldn’t do that,” Harry interrupts, because he’s never used his name to threaten anyone.  Also – “He’s not some –”
“I know that she stopped loving me,” he finds himself saying nonetheless, something acid inside him; he feels tension in his leg as Draco encourages it back.  He swallows and he feels it like anger, still holding his beer with his other hand in a fist.  “She promised that she would love me forever, but she didn’t.  I know that she stopped.  She resented it –”
In the end, Harry doesn’t trust his arithmancy, even after Draco’s checked it.  Lupin and Sirius go through the main entrance on the library pass that Hermione issued months ago.  They act inconspicuous; Sirius wears some of Harry’s dad’s most boring robes (“I’ll pretend that I’m in administration.”).  Draco apparates with Harry’s mum and dad and he’s supposed to come back for Harry – but Harry grows impatient and reckons that he at least knows the way in, after all the work on the portkey, so he apparates behind them and gets shouted at for what should have been twenty minutes but is instead only a gesture and a glare and one bright burst of feeling.
,” Lupin’s commanding, shaking himself, forceful but patient, a teacher with a panicking student, and Harry recognises the tone.  Not the cigarette, which goes back in Lupin’s mouth.  He’s not sure how he feels about it.
Lee’s eyes go wide, but his grin doesn’t fall from his face.  He tosses his notes to the coffee table, and Harry can’t take it back.  “Would you?” Lee asks, curious, disbelieving, encouraging.
“Didn’t start your day in the morning either, I reckon.”  Harry’s looking at him owlishly, pushing glasses up his nose, the lenses smudged to shit.  He shakes his head.  “You’re a disaster.”
“I’ve told her,” George goes on, sounding amused.  James is drinking.  “Not that it matters now, but she could’ve stuck with any of the blokes she’s chucked over the years.  Harry’s a dead end; he’s always been a dead end.  It’s not his fault; he’s gay,” George states, as though this is entirely inconsequential.  “There’s no way to win.”
“Your grandfather wasn’t an auror,” Draco says, and it’s entirely irrelevant.  He looks confused, as though Harry should have known this, and Harry doesn’t know anything, who Draco is to talk to him so kindly.  “Fleamont Potter was a renowned potioneer.  He consulted for Alastor Moody after the employment and promotion channels –”
James Potter and Sirius Black have broken into Draco’s flat.
“I also might’ve wanted him to be my dad.”
“It’s…”  Harry shrugged, thinking of walking barely clothed by a stream and pointing out a frog, like a loser.  He didn’t feel calm; it wasn’t working.  “It’s a change in circumstance,” he came up with.
Ow, he thought.
The story really begins in 2004, four years before James Potter’s return, when Harry Potter told Draco to run.
“Three months?”  Draco knows that he’s repeating himself, but it’s so
Matías laughed, distracting.  He wasn’t interrupting.
Somewhere deep in his chest, Harry feels a great well of pity for the boy who fell in love with Lily Evans, who never had a choice in becoming an occlumens, or at least never felt as though he had one.
“Ghosts,” Draco prompted.  He crossed his arms, his robes black.  “Would you care for the full lecture series, or will the ten-minute set of soundbites suffice?”
It was something quirked and observing, in place of her wide smile.  She liked to do impressions, Ginny, to make people laugh.
“You wanna play the toyboy,” Teddy promises, nodding.  “He’ll buy you presents and call you Harrietto.”
“We’re having lunch,” Harry insists, counting them up.  He misses his children, his ex-wife, Draco Malfoy.  Dead people, who are difficult to count.  “Kreacher, do we have things in for lunch?” he asks his elf.
“You’ve brought Harry!  Have you finally made up, then?  Is it now?  I can act surprised, if you like, or outraged, perhaps?”
Lupin interjects, not helpfully.  “If we could please never use the word
He’s standing in the doorway to the living room, Moony, arms crossed over the front of his sludgy beige-green shirt.  His eyes are bright amber in colour, and Harry doesn’t know why he couldn’t ever have remembered meeting him.
“To the dead.”
“It was a long time ago,” Harry’s snapping at them all.  He moves to sit on the arm of the sofa that Draco’s never found much use for.  “Nearly ten years exactly, turns out.”
Certain that they’ll come up with something, Harry thinks about the rest of the plan for all of three seconds.  “McGonagall’s going to kill me,” he says, because there’s a full week of teaching ahead.
Harry hadn’t realised that this was something he still did.
Lupin looks at him, sharp and silent.
“Don’t fucking
“I know what you’re doing,” he says, with a nod but no preamble, his voice a deep, mellow sing-song.
When Ron comes out with things like this, Harry can’t believe that being an auror is much fun.
“You’re looking really well, Neville,” Harry manages to say, because it’s true.  He even manages to meet Neville’s kind eyes, which is something he’s not done for over a year.
” he asks out of curiosity.
Harry can only shake his head.
Auntie Dromeda’s looking at him, and Harry’s forgotten it, her reaction last week.  He wonders if Teddy’s worked it out yet, and what they should tell him.
And Tone simply titters, a grin on his face which makes him look handsome.  He’ll be Moony’s type, Harry thinks, so what’s that, a pentagon?  “We haven’t had a morning like this in years,” Tone reflects, sounding as though he’s enjoying it.
“You might be right,” Harry agrees, before letting out a short whine.  “Merlin, I was an idiot when I was fifteen,” he complains, fidgeting.  “Sirius spent most of his time staging rows, and dear old Professor Lupin had his hands full keeping the peace, when he wasn’t off…  But I should’ve seen it,” he argues.  “It was in all the staring.  And I reckon that Sirius faked those tropical birds, you know – transfigured some owls to make me laugh…  It’s the sort of thing he’d do, and he’d keep his crappy clothes in case he was caught, so no one would suspect an accomplice.  I mean, he could’ve nicked stuff from anywhere.”
Ron nods, looking down at the paper, ears fading pink, and he’s only being fair.  “Yeah, you do that,” he says, making Hermione laugh for some reason.
For the first time, Harry sees Lupin pull something from his shirt pocket and a cigarette from that.  He’s standing perfectly still, hands moving with a clatter and a click and a quick rush of flame.  He goes from not smoking to breathing in poison, lit up, in a single casual movement.  He breathes out a lungful of smoke directly at Sirius’s back, the breath streaming for what seems like too long, as though Lupin’s lost in the thought of it.
Eyes on the paper, Lily put down her coffee and patted James’s arm in a patronising, absent sort of way, which made him look aggrieved.  Sirius spared her a glance, smirking.
If Harry was going to have them making comparisons, then Draco knew that he had preferred the shagging to whatever it was that they had become.  This likely made him unfeeling and self-centred, but what else was new?  He preferred the idea of Harry fucking him without looking, with hate, because there was nothing in this bedroom worth being.  He was only a waystation for Harry; all of this was only a detour.  Better to be a fun distraction than a haunted fucking traffic island that one could hold a conversation with.
Locking the classroom to return to his office, Harry makes a mental note to tell the story to Draco, details fudged, because it’ll make his eyes light up curious and thoughtful and amused.  He’ll have an opinion, and that will help Harry sort through his emotions.  Then he remembers that he’s left him.
Malfoy stares at him, his eyes glinting wary with shock as the mirrors gleam and reflect.  Harry wants to tell him –
Harry supposes that he knows where he’d go, if he wanted something magic made out of wood.
” he offered in what was a spittingly accurate impression of the man.  “
He addresses this to Sirius, who nods shortly.
Harry was still going into the Ministry, which reminded him of Diagon Alley in the final years of the war.  Reported crime was down, at least, so he had time to take on Albus and Lily’s teaching preparation in the evenings, the early mornings; read their essays; work through wand movements and sous chef for James while he practised for Potions.  It was the most time he’d spent with the children in years.  He enjoyed it; they didn’t seem to know what to make of him.
Teddy’s looking at him as though he’s failing to acknowledge his privilege, or else as though he’s asking for the moon.
Watching him go, Harry had the odd urge to tut and call him dear, because Neville clearly didn’t mean it.  The line didn’t quite sound like Malfoy in his head.
He doesn’t say this, because he thinks that it would sound arrogant.  And he believes in practice, these days.  And he doesn’t do relationships, in general.
“Are you now?” Draco replied, startled, edging down deeper onto his back.  But of course, he thought.  He’d been telling Harry so for years.
“I can understand taking it up with your
And there’s a pang in Harry’s heart, because –
Ron and Hermione have two ginger cats, Fred and George.  George isn’t dead, the living wizard likes to point out.  Neither’s the cat, Ron likes to retort.
Reacting, Ginny’s steps another step down the stand, unconsciously establishing her distance in a way that Harry and Draco are not.  She looks flustered, as though ashamed of her dig, her jealous feelings.  Harry wants to tell her that this is the point of going out with Draco: he’ll always be more of an arsehole.
“Merlin save us if we need to be
It doesn’t matter.  The point is, Harry thinks, they need more than love to banish darkness from this world.  They need sheer bloody-mindedness, conviction and commitment.  The willingness to put on this party.  Innocence, of a kind.
, Merlin save’s.”
He sounds like a wizard long converted, at least to the pomp.  It’s oddly attractive and Harry finds himself smiling, arranging to meet.
Harry turns him around by the shoulders and pushes him towards the drawing room upstairs, managing him like he’s incompetent.  It’s an excellent excuse to follow closely behind him and think about sex, feel up his shoulders and imagine him shirtless, muscles flexing as he touches his way through a wardrobe of different-coloured cashmere jumpers.
His dad looks at him squarely, concerned, but then he nods and unstoppers the vial.  “You should know before you go in…”
In March 2006, Harry flirted with feeling Draco up while they were in company.
It’s terrible, Harry agrees about whatever’s being said, not agreeing, and Malfoy looks at him as though to judge whether Harry’s entertained or if he’s bored, changing the subject if so.  It must always be obvious, because he always gets it right.
And Harry did a lot of sleeping around, as it happens, but there was never any sleeping besides on top of Draco and it certainly wasn’t during NEWTs.
“Where –?” Draco begins, looking around, but he’s quick.  “Is this where –?”
“Well, there’s this first bit,” Harry suggests, dipping the broom slightly, just enough to make his stomach flip, and he hopes Draco’s too.
it, could he, after Moony disappeared?
” Draco mutters aloud, pointing his hawthorn wand at his palm.  His wand doesn’t like it, but then – with a chirp and the feeling of needle-like pressure on his skin, the bird returns to him, stalking sharp footsteps over his fingers and looking at him with curious eyes.
“If you weren’t you,” Draco murmurs to Harry later, when they’re hiding in shadows again, “you would have been sidelined out of this place by the age of thirty-five.”
So far, so predictable, but the important turn of the myth is how it ends.  Prince Momtin was duly glad to be alive again, enjoying a season of feasting with his family and friends.  But Veyra was not so happy.  After so much time in the black ocean depths, she found the sunlight harsh on her eyes and she spent her days longing for the shadows of Tanemoha’s kingdom.  She found her duties to the court unappealing, and she spent her nights remembering Tanemoha’s capricious games of skill.
And Harry agrees, most of the time.  “They’re still calling themselves the Wilkinses,” he says out loud, today, because Ron needs this spelled out.  He’s always had Molly and Arthur; he doesn’t know.  “They’re not interested.  I was listening in on their crap reaction to the engagement –”
“Exactly,” Harry says, looking around them, at the sun.  This beautiful place is where Gary started living, but Moony’s only here to hide.  Harry knows what hiding looks like.  “It’s rubbish.  Death’s no one’s friend.  The third brother must have ended his life a lonely old git, if he felt like Death was his.  That’s what being invisible does.”
“You mean yours and mine?”  And that’s Sirius Black.  Out of St Mungo’s, his accent has returned to the one that Draco heard in his memories: a haughty London nowhere voice, designed to take him anywhere he wants. “Sodom and Gomorrah?”
“Hermione love,” Harry’s mum is saying gently.  Firmly.  “We’re not trying to cause a fight.  We’re trying to work out what upset him.”
“Mm.”
“That doesn’t sound like Potter.”  Draco could barely imagine it, Harry Potter rejecting love.
,” he finally reaches, relieved, looking up.  “Two-thousand-and…”  He shakes his head, disbelieving.  “Eight,” he decides, his expression a question mark as he looks over to Lupin.
“Did you conjure that from downstairs?” Harry demands, looking between the two plates, which seem to be very much the same.
Lupin is still staring at his hand on Draco’s dining table.  He surely wants a cigarette.
She could still mean Sirius, couldn’t she?  This could be the summer, maybe, of 1993, even if that would make Lupin thirty-three and he doesn’t look that age at all.
(“I don’t think that I could ever be so
Gathering his nerve against trepidation, Draco doesn’t bother with theatrics: he pushes the door fully open and walks over the threshold into the drawing room’s awkward tension, which thrums in the uncanny warm light of the room.
“Your side always wins,” complains Draco, squeezing Harry close instead of clapping too.
.  He’s in the kitchen at the back of the house because it’s further away from the drawing room, on the diagonal, but that’s still not far enough; he wants to sink inside his own chest; to be turned inside out; to rip his stomach from his mouth and throw it bloody to the floor and destroy it, crush it, ruin it underneath his feet, because he’s always been so
,” he insisted, holding up a finger.
As he finishes this story, Harry’s tracing a finger over the black sigils inscribed on the shell, which wind in a dense corkscrew from the spiked tip to the hollow base along ridges and gnarls.  “Your Auntie Hermione’s helping me translate the writing,” he tells Teddy like a teacher.  “It’s a poem, we think.  The merpeople like to write in poems.”
“Er, no?”
He’s helped by Lupin, who cuts in lightly, as if offering a passing thought while eating his burger.  “It’s true,” he says.  “He should have stuck with Alice.  He spent all of seventh year in Hogsmeade fretting about whether she was going to turn up.”
Silence.  Until – “Have my way with you,” Harry mocked quietly, a small smile on his face that was infinitely, painfully kind.
, does he?”
“I did not embarrass her,” his father snaps back, short.  His teacup clinks in its saucer and his face closes tight.  “Your mother’s not one for embarrassment.  She said yes,” he insists.
“Granger.”  She
“I need to sleep.”  Draco shuts his eyes, pulling back when he finds the scent of something like the seaside in Harry’s hair.  “I spent the day transfiguring mirrors from sunlight and it’s as much of a headfuck as it sounds.”
” Hermione casts last in a mutter, pointing down at their own feet.  “
Draco didn’t want to know.  He covered his face, breathing hard as Harry Potter hesitated, touched him with dry fingers that jittered and then for some reason gave him head in a chintzy store-fresh tent.  His mouth was hot and slippery; it was enough.  When it was over, there were green eyes and concern, and Draco couldn’t think of anything to say besides, “Fuck.”
It’s suspicion, Harry thinks, in his tone.  It’s unexpected.  McGonagall looks as surprised as Harry feels, turning to Dumbledore, but she doesn’t say a word.
Harry startles at this, and Sirius smiles sadly, as though he understands, before he looks up at the moon again.
McGonagall’s asking, the lemon clacking against her teeth.
On the far side of the room, there is a desk mostly buried in tall stacks of parchment, a sneakoscope, a foeglass, a framed photo of Granger reading a book as well as a few other odds and ends.  Here sits Granger’s boyfriend.  He’s as tall as he long ago came to be, ginger as ever, and he’s hooked over a report of some kind.  His hunched shoulders have leaked blue ink from his quill onto his fingers, and his handwriting runs in a storm of uneven, ugly scratches.
He went down into the depths of the deep black ocean, once, and he bought himself an ugly divan bed.  He has no idea what reality looks like, only that it hurts his eyes, to the point that he can’t look at it, only Harry Potter’s hair, which covers the blood in his fingernails.  There are people alive, but so many dead, and his parents are dead, but he doesn’t want them back.  Not even his mother.  Because the whole thing – the whole thing of his life fucked him up, and he doesn’t remember once liking how it felt.
For his part, Harry shrugged, kicking off his shoes before he climbed to sit cross-legged by Draco’s feet.  He accepted his mead with grace.  “Easier to visualise,” he offered with a smirk.  “I just think of you sitting here like Lord Muck.”
Black asks Lupin in number 12, Grimmauld Place, not outwardly perturbed by whatever he’s remembering from school, either fourth year or fifth, maybe third.
“I don’t understand!” Lily complains, and that’ll be because Harry’s not making sense.
“He doesn’t have a name,” Harry says quickly, grateful for this point.  The bear’s eyes seem to judge him.  “He’s a hand towel,” Harry tells the thing to shut up.
It felt good, but Draco couldn’t – “Don’t talk about Hermione,” he wheezed into a gasp, dropping his forehead to the headboard.  He needed not to think, not to remember, not anything at all.  “Not now, Harry, please.”
“I’m fairly sure that it would feel like fucking my parents.”  He wrinkles his nose.
you work it out?” James Potter asks wickedly, never sounding like his son and well caught, Draco hopes, on his hook.
from primary school.  He doesn’t know the right spell; he doesn’t dare it.
“What
“I don’t care!” Harry interrupts, not moving, gritting every muscle he has and looking down at the steering wheel.
Their kisses become sloppy at this point, because Harry can’t decide between shoving his tongue in Draco’s mouth and his fingers somewhere else, and Draco’s twitching and breathing and existing is a distraction as much as it ever was.
Sara the ghost peered at his inner forearm, which Draco rubbed to raise the Dark Mark’s old colour.  Potter said nothing, and Draco couldn’t look at him.
Raking his hand through his hair, Sirius sucks in breath, and Harry knows how he feels, because he’s done the trip from Grimmauld Place to Hogwarts.  He’s never splinched off half his leg, though, so he can’t help but think that something drastic must have happened, to make Sirius take the risk.
They don’t, Harry’s certain.  Before Draco can answer and Harry can get himself in a panic, he finds himself saying quickly, “Nah.”  He stays Draco with a hand on his arm.  He doesn’t want this to become a competition.  He makes a joke.  “The idea’s now that we have them round to ours and Draco fucks them while I watch from the door.”
it was called.  It didn’t explicitly sell itself as a sex romp – it was supposed to be about whether Voldemort’s choice made Harry special, or if there was something about him himself; if Neville was useless or if he could have been the hero instead.  Harry can’t remember what the conclusion was, though he remembers an impression that the introduction was a load of trick questions and dichotomies that didn’t make sense.
“You should have been much ruder to her,” Malfoy agrees, unrepentant and wicked in Harry’s huge, empty house.  “You let her touch your shoulders and she found herself a hair.”
There’s no chance for them to talk.  The teams are emerging.  Harry’s arrived as late as he could.
Serving them both pasta, Harry’s annoyed to realise that this is another meal that Malfoy’s successfully skipped.  They were on three a day in France.  Snacks.  “It’s only rude if you don’t like yourself,” Harry says passingly, about the mirror, because he worked that out years ago.
Harry can feel his eyes burn, and he remembers a pensieve.  He remembers being sure.
in grease,” he observes, not really complaining.
“Valentine,” Harry tries to play with him, wrapping arms around his back.
” he mocks, just as James Potter bursts out laughing.  Lily slaps his chest with a smirk.
Lupin tuts, impatient or else feeling something more emphatic.  “Really, Sirius, there is no need for this –”
“Remus wasn’t straight?” Harry’s asking Teddy, surprised.
“Oof.”  Sirius rears back, and Harry moves to brace him.  “Oh, you beautiful beast,” he goes on anyway, joyful as the hippogriff preens to have its neck stroked, feathers gleaming in the moonlight, even if they are a little thin.  “So
Then he grabs the man around the back of his shoulders, a rough embrace, and he apparates them both in a mess to his office, because it’s the only route out that he knows.
“Don’t!”  Draco flinches, back in the woods.
This has been the problem all along, Draco thinks.  Three parental reunions so far and they’ve cocked up every one by not thinking ahead.  “I have a plan,” he says.
, Harrymo,” his mum says, her brows knitting, her hair in a plait.
Cutlery appears next.  A glass of pumpkin juice.  A cup for tea from the teapot.  It smells amazing, this breakfast – vegetables and pepper.
Draco yanked harder, sucking on jaw, because he meant every word.
It makes Harry so
“You have no way of knowing that,” Harry tells him, because it seems to have escaped his attention.  He feels unbearably frustrated, looking at this man, framed by the doorway and Draco’s snowy white walls, dressed in robes no matter that he isn’t going to work.  The robes are casual and informal and blue, and he wears them like jeans and a casual shirt, the way that he was born to wear them.  “You don’t know anything about it at all.”
In another house again, it could have been quiet, with Uncle Moony reading the paper and Sirius musing on the puzzles page, throwing clues at Harry while he did his summer homework, played with runes.
fucking nailed that spell – put me back in there; I’ll show you.”
It was Christmas again in no time at all, eventually, and by the afternoon Draco was surely three-quarters cut.
“Your virtue,” Moony tells him adroitly, holding out a hand, which makes Harry’s dad snort.  Gary says something too, and all three of them are laughing, further up the path.  “Come and gaze into the Med with me,” Moony softens the blow as Sirius approaches to take his hand.
For the party, Harry and Draco are flying to Wiltshire, because Draco wants to sit on the back of Harry’s broom (“Yes, I am aware of how it sounds.  Keep up.”).  It shouldn’t take long to get things ready.  Gary and Tone have been staying, and they did the logistics for the booze in two seconds.  Choona the Malfoy elf is in charge of all supplies after that, and he’s happy that he knows what he’s doing.
“Hook-up, then,” Teddy comes back with, quirking a sarcastic grin.
Andromeda’s own face tightens as she reads him and she slaps her knees in a display of something much worse than her suspicion about Harry’s intentions.  “Oh,
“Oh, it’s fucking nonsense,” Moony declares, much too loudly, for him.  He sounds exactly like Sirius.  It’s weird.  He must have had enough to drink to let down his guard.  “You set up a mirror and the charm bounces off.  Like something out of ancient Egypt.”
.  “It was my turn to host the Gryffindor mums.  Ginny stayed late and we were finishing the cocktails…”
Harry reads this postscript several times.
Looking at him, Harry checks for signs of Polyjuice.  “I thought that we agreed to stop saying
This is wonderful.  “Would you care to announce us, Kreacher?” Draco suggests, for the hell of it.
Because he’s being kissed, then, much like a bear, and he’s not focused on anything, his palms sweating with the immediate leap of his heart, Draco’s elbows sharp where he finds himself gripping them.
Well, –
Lupin nods without sense, nods and nods again.  “Hermione!  Ron,” he greets next, as if he’d had no idea that they’d be here.
, as if the whole world was a mystery.
“He…”  Lily Potter looks confused, and Draco imagines that she’s still taking in the fact that her son and his friends know so well someone whom she would have thought long forgotten.  “Sev was never very patient.”
, Harry, but these things take time…”
Not that Harry’s made a study of this.  He doesn’t have Draco’s insomnia; nothing like it.  If Harry can’t sleep, it’s only ever from nerves, or oversleeping during the day, or too much caffeine, or a combination of these three.  Waking up after he’s drunk too much.  Normal things.
of apparition, just like before, with Aunt Bella.
Always too aware of what’s going on, Draco’s not missed a beat.  “Look at it,” now he suggests, both of them trapped in cream bedclothes.
…  “We don’t have to,” Potter says, and it seems as though he’s going to be
“Yeah, yeah.”
He points the fork at Harry, and it’s in his left hand.  It doesn’t make sense, because no one told Harry that James Potter was left-handed.   He holds his wand in his right; it must make it difficult to cast.
These words nonetheless trigger an immediate reaction, producing a slew of questions about budget, carats, metals and stones.  It’s all the same stuff that Draco’s had in his ear over too much coffee this morning, but Granger’s boyfriend seems to have forgotten that he is these days a consummate expert in women’s jewellery.  He’s fumbling over the difference between an Asscher and a princess cut.
He turns away from the barbecue, his hand shaking a little as he heads to the drinks chest on the table held by the decking.  He makes it up the step and there’s a bottle of wine in ice, a supermarket Sancerre that Kreacher’s told him is excellent value according to the magazine in the Sunday Times.  “Kreacher is still looking for a Riesling, Mr Malfoy,” he said when last they spoke, and Draco hopes that he finds one soon.
“I’ve gone, I’ve gone,” Harry’s voice insists, nonsensically, his hand stroking Draco’s greasy, disgusting hair.  “I’m not here.”  He’s a dream.  It’s a dream.  It’s all right if it’s a dream.  “I’m far, far away.”
“Dad,” Harry finds himself coming out with, staring at himself.  “Dad, I used to tell Uncle Vernon to stuff it,” he promises, because that’s how it happened.
“A bed,” he repeated as he moved to Draco’s jaw and pulled away, his mouth a one-sided smirk.  The lamp hanging over them cast his face in deep shadow.  “You spoil me, Malfoy.”
Clothes taken to the recycling point, Harry finds his way to Jermyn Street, which is where he knows through osmosis or else imagination that old muggle men like to shop.  He wants a coat.  He’ll be wearing cloaks with his uniform until the day he retires, but Malfoy’s been wearing muggle coats for years to social occasions.  This clearly means that it’s acceptable to wear one in magical circles – though Malfoy might just wear his to piss off the old Slytherins; he’ll have to ask – and in any case, something with buttons or a zip down the front is more practical against the wind, and winter’s coming in.
Compared to Draco, Harry thinks, in this dream of high summer as he turns twenty-eight, compared to the grey all around them, Harry’s arms look like bronze.  His extremities glow an angry red with his blood, and his cock is already coming back to life.  He reminds himself of Greek pottery from the British Museum, all black hair and horses and helmets and wings and erections.  He’s sweating, mostly under his arms but otherwise everywhere, and he knows that he became this terrible person through choice.  This predatory, sexual person; this wolf.
There are going to be streamers screaming everywhere, tonight, and glitter, and George has plans to turn the drawing room’s floor and walls into something like a bouncy castle (“We’ve done it loads of times; the trick’s the safety charms, because you want to bubble your bouncers, but not so much that everyone ricochets…  Angelina does the arithmancy; we’ll get it sorted.”).
