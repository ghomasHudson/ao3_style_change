Harry raised an eyebrow at that. He isn't sure that's a very plausible rule. Why would a thirty year old man needs to inform an eighteen year old man where he is going?
“Do not call me Dray! You have no right, you bastard! You’re an arsehole!” he pointed at him and Harry sighed trying to control his own emotions.
He tried to school his confusion but he was sure it still came out. A lot of questions twirling through his mind as Harry brushed the sheets to the side, standing up only dressed in his boxers.
He grabbed a thong on the bed and bent down as he slowly put it on. He took his time in wearing the red thong. Making sure that the material glided on his skin softly, enticingly. He smiled when he can make out keen eyes on his back and the way Harry would be clenching his hands in a tight fist.
“Sweetheart, I don’t go to places like that. You know I hate the smell of cigarettes and the lights make me dizzy”
His left hand went to rest on Draco’s thighs, gripping it tight while maintaining his cool not to give away. He can feel his parents watching the situation and it drove his gut over the edge.
He bit his lips tight when he heard a rustle from his left side, even from a considerable distance he was well aware of that noise. The familiar heavy footsteps, a sound of nothing but a grave warning, the noise able to strike fear inside him, tremor feeding his whole being as he tried to control his breathing pattern.
He went inside and truthfully enough, saw Ron grumbling, weeping, complaining on his seat, sacrificing his own hand away for how rough he’s writing on some parchment.
He tried his best to increased his pace, even when his wrist began to feel cramped, he tried to fuck himself on the dildo earnestly. He lifted his hips up, meeting his own thrusts and arched his back, sliding his fingers up and licked on them, uselessly muffling his loud mewls.
He’s not a least bit convinced that things are really fine but he calm his worries a bit. He was holding onto that string,
Harry smiled, biting his bottom lip as they stood there, in the center of the dining room. He peppered him with kisses on his lips. Once, twice, thrice, many many times until Draco was giggling joyfully.
Her fingers began to caress his torso. Starting from those abs to that finely build chest, she looked at him straight in the eyes before slowly, she bent down and peppered him many lovely kisses. Giving him love bites and inhaled his scent that enveloped hers as if they just connected, been intertwined and formed a spark that can never be achieved with a mark on the nape.
Harry had to gripped his spoon and fork tight, his tight grip obvious and he felt himself getting a headache.
Harry nodded as he stared up into the ceiling. It’s his last night in the town before they leave again. Remembering a topic they’d already talked about at the night of his proposal being accepted, they should be able to broach it fully now.
Only to be humiliated because of how he was awfully confident before. Though at first, some of them have been adamant at his decision to marrying someone who’s not in their gang, believing that it might taint the purpose of what they do, they were still supportive.
It’s always there whenever Harry is in the same vicinity he’s in. The way the grounds felt as if they were shaking underneath them, rejoicing for something the potion had given them. But no matter how much he tries to tell himself it was the pearl dust, his mind cannot stop dreaming about the man.
“Ms. Lovegood’s been rather confusing, I know. And I assure you, she means well” she cut him off before her hands clasped to one another, “You’re not going to let this go, are you?”
Harry tilted his head, eyes darkening at the image of him biting his lips. He slid his left hand inside the pocket of his jeans and stepped closer. Slow and careful steps reaching, light but the heaviness of what’s about to come called Draco out to him.
Harry growled at the sight of the wet lacy panties as he inhaled deeply, all of his senses were assaulted by Draco’s sweet smell and Harry was so desperate to get in but Draco’s pleasure first before he tends to his own.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. My services aren’t available for tonight” he excused himself and turned to look at Draco who was standing with arms crossed.
“Come on, baby. Wanna see you come apart. Cum for me, darlin’” he whispered, biting on her collarbone and just then, Dracy cried as she gushed out around him, clenching around him tightly and prompting for him to shoot his load inside her.
Perhaps Harry really is making up to her. But truthfully, he didn’t have the need to. The night she realized things was the night she decided to reach out to him as well, get to know the Harry that the Wizarding world doesn’t know.
Harry winked at her before taking hold of the bouquet and handing it to her, “I don’t know if you love tulips but I hope you like them”
He took a deep breath and a moment to make sure he can answer smoothly, “I like orgasm denial, edging. I have a choking kink, light pet play. Blindfolds are fine, handcuffs sure, degradation  and praise kink”
“Answer when you’re spoken to, omega” he purposefully lowered his voice and made sure he was clear in making a point.
Sirius sobbed. Fuck. He is so fucking hot. He just needs a little bit of friction, just a little bit. If only Remus can give him that.
There was a low chuckle. He didn’t bother himself for it as a palm touched his cock, gently at first as not to unnerve him until it gradually locked around him. Fingers expertly moving, thumbing at his slit.
He cried out. If there’s one thing he’s not good at, that is to stay still. He bit his lips, rolling his hips tentatively before earning the sharpest glare from Remus.
He reached for her and took her shirt off as well, followed by her shorts and her panties before Harry took care of his boxers. He joined Dracy right after, lips trailing her legs, to her inner thighs, pecking a kiss to her soaked entrance, to her tummy, her breasts and taking one nipple at his mouth and entered her.
“You do enjoy riling me up, huh? You love it when you try to seduce me? You smile when you see the effect you have on me?” Harry whispered lowly. His voice had gone husky and sultry, as sultry as the Draco in his dream.
He straightened up when Harry stood up, all towering height in view, walking gracefully to stand few inches away from him. One hand slid inside his pocket while the other played with a lighter that suddenly came out of nowhere.
“This may sound so weak of me” he began and Dracy really wanted to make him stop. Doesn’t want to force his story out on his lips that kissed her with kindness but now is about to tell a story that never touched anyone’s life, “But I was traumatized”
“Come on, princess. Let’s eat?” he asked softly, hearing that nice whine from Draco, not wanting to pull away.
"Alright. Gather around everyone! We're going to play some dare games!" he heard Pansy shouted at the top of her lungs.
He’s what people call a playboy. Not so typical kind of wizard playboy. The Daily Prophet had noted his ability to spoil his current omega rotten. Shops, endless gifts, heaps of flowers, nice dates in the public but they also noted how these omegas do not last longer than a week.
“Hmm?” Harry hummed, his other hand gliding at his inner thighs before splaying them widely and bending down to gently nip at the white flesh, his tongue laving at the bite afterwards. Draco closed his eyes, enjoying and savoring his own version of nice array of sunshine, not bothering to talk or rush Harry’s spoiling because it would mean for it to end sooner.
Harry’s eyes fell into the tree few feet ahead where Draco sits down, reading a book with a shrunken blanket thrown in his lap. The blanket they used back at the common room.
The sight of her in his bed, legs open and providing him such a view of a small pink lacy panties wet with her slick. He growled deep in his throat before kneeling on the floor and grabbed her by her legs.
“Fuck!” Draco exclaimed when Harry’s hand fastened, sliding in his length then lowering them down. He toyed with his balls and Draco’s body quivered.
“Oh, love” he spoke and immediately wiped those tears away. Something he vowed should only be seen when Draco cannot contain his happiness but those people just had to be so heartless.
Oh, how she wishes it’s just that. But she wouldn’t pressure or force him into anything. They both have suffered enough. His traumatizing past had haunted him throughout the years and last thing Dracy needs to do is to rush him.
He tried to act nonchalant as he finished his lunch and downed his Pumpkin juice, “Nothing. Just mind your girl’s night” he rolled his eyes for the second time and stood up, eager to leave the Great Hall.
“Did so good, kitten. You did so good for me, so perfect” he praised, tossing the cloth aside as he laid them both onto the bed, letting the smaller man rest in his chest, "That was quite a performance, baby"
Which doesn’t prove to be a problem as they all opted to go buy gifts in Hogsmeade. When Draco thought they’ll be joining in the gift excursion, Harry chose to stay back and have the place to his selfishness, wanting to spend every bit of his time with him.
He looked around and went straight in the living room and thankfully, had found her at one of the settees, wide-eyed and startled.
The bartender turned around and he perked up. Those…those eyes, those emerald eyes. It reminded him of his sorority when he was in college, Slytherin.
Harry smiled as he rolled his tongue on his lips, having the urge to take one nipple on his mouth and unable to hold himself back, he bent down. He squeezed on her breast and he moaned as he darted his tongue out.
Harry chuckled as his hand dropped from Draco’s shoulder to his waist, faking a sip but not really taking a gulp,, “We figured we could have some fun outside. Plenty of time to make the place our home”
She parted her lips as Harry slid his index finger slowly. Not bothering to look away, Dracy suck on it enticingly, purring as she was assaulted by his scent. Now, smells even more wonderful as they connected in a way.
He discovered that Harry's bed is in utter chaos because the sheets and the blanket is not in its proper place and a pillow is in the floor. How is Harry sleeping? Eagle? Starfish?
When he arrived back from the Minister, he went straight to his department and slid the flowers to Draco’s desk, “Your Alpha playboy says sorry”
Slowly, Draco obeyed. Blinking his eyes for a few times for his sight to adjust before it settled on Harry’s emerald eyes, fighting the urge to roll his eyes and holding on to his biceps, “Daddy” he whispers lowly.
There’s no way he’d appreciate that hand holding his own, fingers connected and sharing a little of his body heat to him. There’s just no way. Error. Troubleshoot needed.
He wanted to plead, wanted to scream curses at him for not touching him where he wants to but found himself unable to do so as Harry leaned down, lips brushing at his nose to his cheeks.
“We have every styles from different brands. We also have the latest editions on display and are all limited edition” The male informed and directed them to heels Dracy found beautiful. However, one pair caught her eyes. But before she could inspect it further, Harry spoke and pointed at a pair of red pumps.
“Come on. Cum for me, doll. Cum for me, wanna feel you clench around my cock” Harry demanded, his right hand beginning to tug at Draco’s own cock.
But as quick as she felt the hair in her nape rose, the tables have turned. The man who have no problems with feisty women like her.
“Prepare this bedroom for my omega immediately” Harry pointed at the room just beside his and Wily got into his work.
She already look beautiful then but now that she doesn’t look like she’s carrying the biggest problem of all and isn’t suffering from prying eyes and hands, she looks gorgeous and not to mention, smells so calming and sweet.
He bit his lips tight, front teeth burying in it almost to draw blood as Harry’s fingers grazed through his clothed cock, lightly not enough to cause friction but enough for him to whine.
“Hmm” the man hummed before catching his chin and turning it towards him, “Eyes at me, love. The gun won’t harm you” he warned,
Draco was already nodding furiously even before Harry can finish his sentence, “Please. Please, Harry—
The petite woman simply gulped at his question, not even bothering to meet his intense gaze as her eyes were glued at the floor in front of her.
It was after quite some time, the noises died down. The eight years whose fun have lasted with wide smiles and hours long excitement became a bit more teasing happiness, sincere gazes bloomed in their faces as they peered at the tree.
She nodded and bit her lips, wiggling her hips and Harry smirked before in quicl two seconds, he slid her shorts off her body and pushed her legs open more, “Gonna eat you out”
Harry who was still looking petrified frowned, “What the fuck. I think I just lost my appetite for the next ten years. Centaur’s piss. What the fuck! No one hears this, alright? No one!”
His mouth parted open as a hand gripped his throat, gripping loosely, gradually tightening it as moans flew out of Draco’s mouth. Mumbling out scattered incoherent noises as he fought the urge not to close his eyes.
But for now, he suffers because people were liars. When they said Harry was a heartbreaker, they were lying.
He’s a changed man, you see. Eventually, he has to graduate being this playboy the public make him out to be.
The soft huffs of breaths coming from the man to the way his hands trailed to cup the back of his head to massage his hair, he knew he had lost. There’s something in him Draco cannot quite name. Something in him he longed to have and what is it is the mystery.
Furrowing his eyebrows, he looked around. There’s no cars right now. The streets are wide open and the only company he has are the street lights and the traffic lights above him.
Harry told him to scream and he is. His hold tightened and he felt himself convulsing as he began to feel the telltale signs of his upcoming orgasm.
When the check up was done, Harry guided her to the floo before they transported their selves to a specific shop in Diagon Alley.
"The Head Auror kind" he answered after a while. He looked up and he was sure there was some mischievous glint in Draco's eyes before it disappeared and was replaced by the usual innocence that would be haunting Harry to his grave.
He slumped his body in Harry and buried his head at the crook of his neck. He breathed heavily, not trusting himself to say anything.
He sighed. That’s an issue he had not thought in the first day he met her. An issue to a man like him. Quietly walking over to her, he bent down and carefully pulled the book away from her hands. Then he brushed a hair away from her lovely face.
“You’re so beautiful” Harry complimented with a low voice, his eyes glued to her face and shone like no other when Dracy blushed profoundly.
This is what Harry is talking about when he said Ron can read people. He can read them even just the back of a hand. He can read them easily and effortlessly. And Harry just got caught.
After they were both cleaned up, Harry joined her in the bed and propped himself on the elbow and faced her.
Harry pulled away, staring down at her as his finger slid up to the her lips and caressed the outline, “I like your fire” he confessed.
Dracy fidgeted with her fingers. Too shocked and surprised to say something. She is not used to affections like this, sudden affections that came utterly from nowhere. Especially from someone who have brought her as a slave because that’s what she thinks she is.
Draco gulped. For how many times this day, he didn’t know. He felt a force being pulled in him, tugging closer to the mysterious man who creep his own way in and took him out of the world he knew since birth.
His back arched, nearly collapsing on top of his husband if not for him holding him by the waist. Sirius gasped, his hands shaking. Just a little bit of friction, just wants a little bit of friction.
He tried to focus and nearly spelled himself to really focus when the first few minutes made his mind wander to that pale skin, smooth and soft, too young in his touch and foreign on his fingers but not unpleasant.
He groaned as he bucked his hips slowly, riding out his orgasm and allowing himself to take a deep breath.
She sobbed. Wanting to stand up and find him but her legs are quivering and she cannot have the strength to push herself up. So she decided to just stay in bed, enduring the pain and the wanton need of a presence of an Alpha.
Serves him right for underestimating him and them. He reached at the living room and right there on the middle of all the mess that everyone caused, Harry and Tom fighting. One to catch while the other to escape.
No sooner than later, several people popped up in the common room, wearing their own Weasley sweater and the same smiles plastered on their faces as they hugged and greeted one another. It was such a magical sight Draco found himself tearing up a bit.
Maybe it also stems as to how Harry literally owns a successful flower shop, dealing with people and assisting them of what they need.
“I’m craving” she nibbled on her lips, eyes looking all over at Harry’s face and lastly, staying at the beard. Who would’ve thought that a bearded Harry could be so hot?
“Make you scream my name” his tongue lick his cheek wetly and rather than disgust, Draco found himself liking it, feeling a wet patch gathering on his lace, “
Dracy, who began to eye him with those expressions Harry refused to acknowledge, nodded breathlessly.
“Fuck, pretty like this. Laid out for me like a good little slut that you are, baby. So beautiful, needy for me” harry whispered, pushing one finger inside and rolling it just fucking right, "Such a good boy"
Harry’s mouth was back on her nipple as the words strike him with lust. She gave Harry’s cock a gentle squeeze all the while purring and whimpering as Harry alternated between her two breasts.
But right now, he doesn’t need to because he has one to provide his needs. He stretched out to relieve his back muscles and leaned at his chair after. Normally, he can easily control his sexual depravity—well, not depravity because it’s not. He can easily pick up omegas but he usually opts not to act on his Alpha’s urges but other times, he does.
Harry removed Draco’s hands away from his waist and decided to face him. He felt bad when he saw him teary eyed and felt as if he’s having all those negative thoughts about himself which is something Harry didn’t mean to cause.
But that’s not what matters right now. What matters is Draco is with him and maybe he can and should keep it that way.
“Your lips wrapped around my huge cock, desperate for my cum and so greedy you don’t want me to let go”
“Darling, if we do not do this, we could risk our names in the muggle world which in turn may put as in danger in our world. We have to. We cannot expose who we are” his mother reasoned out.
Harry pecked a kiss on his pouty lips before starting to pull his finger in and out for a good second before pushing in another finger, nicely prodding him more open, making his thigh tremble from their place but firm not to clench them close.
Harry is an exact fit, the missing one he doesn’t even recognize. A missing puzzle he didn't know he would craved for more.
Hello! I'm very sorry for the late update. I had an emergency I needed to take care of and just wrote this an hour ago.
He breathed roughly as he ran to his room to grab a shirt and left the Malfoy Manor with his motorbike in a huff. He just needs to get away. He fucking needs to get away.
Luna’s a bit stranger to some people but the way she speaks as if she knows something he doesn’t put him off a bit. And with the gentle smile Luna gave him makes his heart hammer inside his chest.
Fucking hell. The sound resonated at the whole office as his head was then again turned to the other side. He groaned out in pain as he clutched his other cheek, “Damn. I know you hate me but I didn’t expect it would be this much”
Can someone tell him why wizard teens are this fucking horny? He's been binding himself to the chair he is sitting in. He had drunk three bottles of beer trying to hold himself back from snatching Draco away from his circle of friends and just bloody return to the Malfoy Manor and rest like a good boy.
She smiled sympathetically, “It’s okay. I take them as the creatures that they are and you can take them in any form you want”
“Here, sit here” Harry gestured and Draco did. Harry didn’t sit down but he stood sideways to Draco’s, body completely facing the omega as to make sure this gorgeous one is with him.
“I think I’d prefer you mad, Head Auror” one of the female Aurors stated and Harry smiled at her widely, “Come on, Pepper. Don’t be so bitter. Anyway, WEASLEY!”
“They followed me everywhere. Wouldn’t stop even when I tried to tell them to. My room have always been the safe place for me. The tears I shed in the place, the frustrated and broken emotions it had seen out of me. All those traumatized nightmares that never went out. That’s a personal space I can be who I am. The not so s-strong Alpha everyone make me out to be”
He looked at his wrist watch to find it’s still five in the afternoon. He’s off work by six but often, seven. These kinds of things are what make life not worth living. Especially when his source of laugh already went home.
He groaned, accepted his defeat and whatever kind of mocking he’ll get from Draco. Speaking of which, he spied him discreetly and smiling when he saw how at ease he was answering. Fluid like motions writing solutions and whatever else.
“Hmm” Draco hummed, intertwining his hand around Harry hands and closing his eyes, “Thank you, daddy”
Turning around the corner and when he saw one of the abandoned classroom, he opened the door and gestured for Harry to go in. He grinned at him mischievously as if he knows what is about to happen but nonetheless went inside.
He would walk her into her bedroom and kisses her good night. It was all good but also at times, scary. Whenever she’s alone in her room, staring up the ceiling and wandering what will happens if one day Harry realized he’s no longer okay with the set-up and would want to return her from where she used to be.
His voice soft, supple but grounding. His tone husky and hoarse but reigning. He let the ashes fall down the ground as he stretched his arm. He did not expect the order and certainly did not expect the word after.
He specifically apparated late yesterday to go buy some chocolates in France for the omega he needs to woo. He had never met an omega reject this brilliance before but Draco did that so effortlessly.
He doesn’t know why and how but all those touches and time together in the privacy of his place, he let himself fell without so much as a fight. His fierceness in their field of job didn’t quite reach to any of their shared escapades.
He didn’t give him any time to adjust as Harry pounded in and out. Thrusting into the hilt, easily finding his nerves that sent tingles and jolts through his spine. His hair was tugged back as Harry grunted, cursing and flexing his muscles as he held Draco to him.
"Stay here while I put up wards. If you really want to get to know me, listen" yes, yes. Draco will listen. He gulped and went to sit back at the couch.
But as they waited for the groceries to be packed, Harry raised a hand and wiped a sweat away from her forehead. The simple gesture of affection spurred more shock in everyone’s faces and as Dracy was becoming to grow uncomfortable, the Alpha spoke,
He sighed as he stared the woods burning through the fire, the silent noises it makes as it cracks and the slight smell of smoke waving through the air. It wasn’t even the heat from it that exasperated Harry but that confusing moment he shared with Draco in the classroom.
Maybe, he’s not so good at this. He winced. Tom might’ve found out he’d escaped already. Quick to gather whatever he could, he hid inside a cabinet he saw and opened his phone to text Harry.
Harry kissed his cheeks not long after and came inside him, filling Draco up which some of it spilled down his thighs onto the couch.
Harry gulped, thinking whether to ask McGonagall to reassign him to someone else or go with it. Rooming him with the person he did nothing but bickered with may not be a really good idea but if he’s not going to follow the arrangement, how else is he going to befriend the man and build a better relationship with him?
Harry smirked, “Can’t promise that, doll” he whispered below his ear before he turned to waved at the bartender over.
It was so sweet Harry nearly lost himself with the sensations together with every beat of Draco’s reaction and the moans, yells, whimpers. It was his new kind of music.
“That’s also the exact scenario on how did I get Re into my bed but you know, more elegant and sophisticated because I have a creative mind” Sirius chuckled. “But your troubles are I think only troubles because you’re thinking too much”
Draco sighed and looked at his bare foot. It was all wounded, bruised, and scarred. He was exhausted beyond belief and all he wanted to do was to lay down on his bed, in his own place, away from all of this.
Sirius snorted in amusement. Hiding his wand in the pocket of his jeans as he watched the amazing Potter spouses. He leaned at their wonderful settee and settled his eyes back on them. He seriously cannot believe even in marriage, these two still calls each other by last names as if Lily isn’t carrying James’ surname.
“Fuck! St. Mungos!” Harry cursed aloud. Quickly moving around as he absentmindedly grabbed the quilt and apparated away.
He’s just out there, swaying his hips with that fitted pencil cut skirt, giving everyone a nice sight of that plump butt but not letting even just Harry get a taste.
Harry halted her movements as his body grew desperate, holding her on her position, he began to fuck her throat while still keeping mind of what could happen if went too much for her to handle. The feel of him reaching her throat and the sound of her gagging followed by the slap of her balls to her chin, it was at all too sexual, stimulating, and every thrust of his cock to her mouth was something he knew he will be thinking later in the shower.
Dracy fluttered her eyes and leaned all of her weight in Harry. She’s tired and all she wanted to do is to sleep in his arms. Humming contentedly when Harry began to caressed her back, “Are you alright?”
Does that mean all of these are just because of the potion and the pearl dust? Something he’s not in control of because Hogwarts is?
Some omegas may have a kink for a man in uniform but Harry’s Alpha really do have a liking with Draco in a skirt.
“Do you want these pair, Ma’am? They’re limited edition and I’m sure will fit you” the staff spoke and Dracy perked up. Not really wanting for anyone to notice where she was looking. She blushed even more when Harry looked at her then at the heels she’s staring at.
He made sure to get her and with one promise of a wealthy ease, Dracy happily (or maybe not) accepted his offer.
Pulling away, Draco looked up the sky. Just above their heads were the beautiful fireworks, heart shaped ones with the words
Harry felt his head swirling inside his head. Dracy felt so fucking god, he wanted to taste her, bury his head between her legs, and discover how she seems to easily inflame him with fire.
“Look at you, baby. So beautiful for me, sweetheart. So beautiful laid out on my bed” Harry whispered as he rolled his hips enough to cause heavenly friction on their sex.
The guards have stationed themselves outside the restaurant, patrolling the area and given the access to question anyone they find suspicious. Not that there are dangers lurking around currently but life surprises are always just around the corner.
Sirius blinked before huffing out a laugh. The most bizarre things really do come from Prongs’ mouth. In no way did he expect his disbelief to center around how fun it would be if they sport the same kind of magic.
Harry shrugged, “The dom, the daddy, the professor, the cop. Whoever you want me to be, at your service” he tipped an imaginary hat off and smiled in return, “First time?”
“Aren’t you coming out? Astronomy’s in three minutes” he asked, not letting himself think too much at the expression he can see in Draco’s eyes— when the hell did he become Draco by the way?
He was surprise to hear such vulgar statement from the omega and his eyes instantly glinted as he smirked. He stood up with her in his arms before he began to walk towards his bedroom.
“A-alpha” she can no longer keep herself from moaning. Harry smirked and brushed her knickers aside and completely felt her. He teased her clit with his thumb while her middle finger hovered over her wet hole.
Draco crossed his arms. Ignoring the name he heard. He knows the Potters. He had heard the House Of Potter's brilliance , yes but who would actually need rumors in their lives? Not him.
Harry groaned as he felt his balls drawling up and he harshly slammed his hips to her abused hole and came. He collapsed on top of her and breathed heavily. He stayed inside her as his knot begin to form, his lips finding her nipple and he began to suck on it as they both waited for his knot to subside.
She bobbed her head up and down. Her hands pumping what she cannot take on her mouth. She hollowed her cheeks to try to accommodate him more and began to pour pressure. Harry growled at the action, feeling the throb of his cock as it chases its own orgasm. He didn’t expect oral with her could be this good despite the obvious lack of experience. But he wasn’t complaining.
“Good boy” Harry whispered, his fingers gingerly caressed his balls and Draco bit his lips. The sensations hauling his senses, pushing him over the edge between sanity and giving away. To let loose and give Harry all of the control.
The bar was nice, noisy with people dancing, reeks of the usual alcohol, cigarettes, and combined scents of guests. And most importantly, Tom is nowhere in sight.
They stared at each other’s eyes and Dracy gradually realized one more thing. She run a finger on his jawline, thinking about the man in Harry that was just let out and she was the first to see.
“We have the night, little one. We can do as much and as little, as gentle and as soft, as respective and dignified. Say the word, say whatever and I’ll grant them for you”
Draco felt his knees buckling as he took his skirt and underwear off. Moaning at the tone of his voice to the way there suddenly has no semblance of the virtuousness Harry is known for.
Her eyes are glazed with lust, her legs dripping with sweet slick Harry had a sudden urge to taste and lap it all up, her hair messy and her forehead sweaty. Her whole body was shaking with desperate need. She looks so weak but at the same time, still winning this situation that pins them both with vague choices.
His father came into view, face contorted with sarcasm. Harry rolled his eyes at him, “Hello, Pa” he hugged his father before giving his mom a kiss on the forehead.
But for Draco, he wasn’t. He was so much more. He was much more than what he let other people see. He was so much more than being the Head Auror, his partner, much more than the powerful man. He was much more than what his wand describes him to be, much more than those rigorous training he has to make his muscles much more reliable.
Draco already looking so fucked out as he continued to mumble messy pleas and being vocal of how good he’s feeling. At best if he’s overestimating.
Harry’s life have always been driving with his biker family and if Harry is willing to adjust to what Draco wanted, he will too.
“Gettin’ to know you, angel” he winked, licking his lips and Draco unconsciously followed the movement.
It didn’t take long until they arrived in front of his house and as Draco handed the helmet back, he smiled, “Thank you”
Draco nearly moaned on sight. The dark expression on Harry's face is turning him on. It's too alluring and sexy and it's making him this little whiny and needy person. He wants him too much and he didn't expect Harry to have this much control on  himself. He expected to bend and wiggle his butt enough, he'll be able to get him to his bed but not. He shouldn't really underestimated Harry's reign on himself because it really is undeniably strong.
Little by little, Harry corrupted his being like a snake, slithering in silently, making their way up with the most venomous of pleasures, the most filthy of words, but the most magical of hands.
He thanked himself when he didn’t forget about it the next morning. He had it in his memory bit by bit and can reminisce it in every detail.
When he went downstairs, he didn’t even look at Dobby when he spoke and didn’t answer when he asked if he wants anything specific for breakfast. He just took his wand and apparated away straight to Pansy’s house announced.
All of her heat before have been handled with potions to contain in symptoms and lessen the pain she can feel for not having a knot inside her and for not having an Alpha she can mate or bond with.
She chuckled sadly, “I was questioning how you can teach me how to be brave when you are anything but that”
“Such a slut,” Harry whispered as he pulled away, lips quickly attached to his jaw, “Seducing me, touching me”
“Good morning” he placed one last kiss on her tummy before sliding back up, arms on either of her face and bent down to give her a kiss on her lips.
Harry got off from him and sighed. The cloud inside his mind had evaporated and suddenly, he grew frantic. Fuck.
“Come for me, baby girl. Come on. Wanna see you clench on my hand. You’re being so good” he murmured huskily before returning on his earlier actions.
He chuckled when Draco immediately blushed at the action and tried to brush it off by clearing his throat.
Draco was a mess. His hair sticking out, his forehead sweaty and his heart at stake. He was well aware of that. But what is he doing? He let the man take him when he thinks it’s a good time. Over and over again.
“You can still sleep, baby” Harry kissed the tip of his pointed nose. He slowly removed his arm under his head. It’s beginning to feel numb and he wanted to stretch it.
“Ahh. A-alpha, please, ahh, harder” he lifted his hips up to meet Harry’s pounding as he began to feel that familiar tightening of his balls.
Lily stepped outside, walking over to his spot and suddenly gave him a hug, “It’s a pleasure to see you, Draco. Harry will be delighted”
He raked his eyes from head to toe and tried not to swoon like a kid. But it's hard because Draco's fucking appealing.
“Okay, that's what I'm talking about. Questions, questions. Look, I’m using half a Gryffindor braincell here,” she hummed, “what would you do if it isn’t him?”
He turned and glared at Seamus standing at the table, wearing the famous knitted Weasley sweater Molly gave the entire eight year class, courtesy by Ginny’s insinuation.
Draco didn't wait for any response as he began to walk and Harry followed acting like a distracted old man because he is.
He was provided with a warm cup of the tea, his palms holding the cup as he tried to held the man’s gaze. Eyes still begging, pleading not to make him suffer. He remained kneeling in front of him, as he moved to removed the gun holster around him and laying it at the table behind him. The heavy clanking nearly made him jump.
Harry laid himself on the bed, his little boy staying to rest atop him and Harry began to hum a lullaby to help him sleep.
“Hey, hey” Harry spoke, “It’s alright. Don’t worry about it” he said to wipe that guilt away from those eyes that usually held disgust but with equal amount of amusement.
He asks for consent and lets her have the chance to speak. Harry watched her pupils dilate, his fingers nearly hovering over her pussy which he’s sure is dripping of slick already. The smell even sweeter and fucking beguiling.
He turned around a corner, quick to hide behind the wall when he heard a voice, someone talking on the phone. Taking his own phone out, he opened the camera and took a video.
Draco smiled and began to walk ahead. Harry followed and once again found himself looking at the ass he's beginning to be obsessed with.
With the Great Hall waiting, it is the celebration that will open for something more. They will soon end the year with new things, moving on with better ones.
“I’m going to give you a nice massage later, baby. I’m going to make you like the queen you are and make you feel so good”
He took a deep breath and walked out of the cabinet. It felt the same when he outed himself to his family. There’s a breathe of relief and cool breeze on his body.
He shook his head, head raising when he thought he heard Harry’s voice few feet away from him on the Eight Year table others have dubbed to be the Phoenix House, one that symbolizes what they have gone through.
Tightening his hold on hers, he lifted her up and set her down on the couch before he kneeled between her parted legs, “Let’s finish where we left off, shall we?”
Neither does he love but he is dangerously sweet. Harry is neither perfect nor the best but his ways are. Thousands of ways to control and millions of ways to gift.
Harry smirked and looked at their colleagues slash friends slash annoying piece of asses. Right after the phone call, his worries have turned into fun excitement.
“No, daddy. You’re not going to touch me” he responded slyly, maintaining eye contact as he moaned wantonly, he whimpered as his cock throbbed and absently, he grind his hips.
But the problem with this independent, strong, and resilient omegas are they know how to resist him because they are aware of how he changes every damn day.
“You want me to touch you?” Harry asked but his tone sounded more like a declarative rather than asking.
It is felt and it is found. Sometimes, it comes to you itself, dressed in these various kinds of stories so you’ll have something to tell to your children, to your wedding day. It’s not just about giving. Loving is not just about giving, it’s the feeling that Harry never tried to step into. For his whole life, he always used his mind.
“Ngh” Draco whimpered, “H-harder” he moaned as if Harry was doing something sexual which in all reality, really sexual.
He admired the bruises the next morning. Letting himself fantasize of a domestic bliss he longed with him but they vanished so easily as Harry fucked it out of him, hand gripping his hard cock and sliding his palm in time of the way his cock pounded into him.
Draco smiled. His hands tightening around Harry’s own as his thighs quivered lightly. He loves those words as Harry goes by with his actions. The way it sent shivers down his groin, the way it was told in that smooth, gentle, and hush voice. It spurred him on but he didn’t sob, he smiled and moaned tenderly.
He gaped at the man who have the audacity greater than his friend, Pansy Parkinson. The man who did not bother to make himself look even presentable.
They are everything the each other needs. They may not figure it out yet, Minerva know they’ll do next day, next week, next month or maybe, next year. There's time, there will always be the right time.
Andy began to talk about the baby’s condition and which part is beginning to develop. While pointing at the hologram in front of them, easily classifying which is which while Harry and her have a hard time specifying.
Parvati turned and looked at him surprisingly and hugged him, “Harry! It’s such a surprise to see you here. How are you? Been a long time”
Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy missed to inform him that what and who he would be guarding is someone that could threaten every kingdom, someone that could crumble every disease and awake new ones, someone that could kill with a single blink.
Dracy moaned at the warm seed. She sighed heavily as they held their positions for a bit of their post-coital bliss. She felt him rub his nose at the side of her face before giving her forehead a kiss.
He lifted her up to meet his thrusts and her moans turning into sobs, tears prickling at the corner of her eyes as her hands tugged on his hair even more. He growled at the rough action, his orgasm beginning to seep into him faster than usual.
He was about to continue thinking about how to start when he heard the floo activating and he perked up.
She perked up at the sound of that. Finishing to chew the food that’s on her mouth before she shifted all of her focus to his, “Can I come?”
He took a deep breath, feeling the way his cock twitch at the first contact of Harry’s warm wet tongue, tentatively licking his precum before licking its slit. His fingers tightened once again around Harry’s fingers then unconsciously tugging at it.
He didn’t bother to get up, feeling the sting of his sole and the pain around his ankles and the exhaustion, all he wanted to do was to close his eyes and let sleep take over.
She walked out of Harry’s bedroom and went to the living room to see him reading another book about parenting.
Never did in his life his expectations failed him but yesterday. He expected to meet a spoiled brat Malfoy kid. A boy wanting nothing but luxury and would throw several temper tantrums a day. A Malfoy kid that would do nothing but buy material things and demand his parents to buy him a house or something.
She gulped, lifting her head up from his shoulder and focused straight ahead. This is what the unspoken gamble have lead them to. All those teasing and playful glances from the past few weeks have led them to conclude it now.
But his eyes stayed wide open as a shadow emerged from a huge tree, a black shirt hung around the man’s muscled torso, a holster around his waist and a sleek gun greeting him with another wave of danger.
He watched her take a deep breath before closing her eyes. As her breath evened out, Harry smiled at her, he was content to stare at the beauty beside her as he tucked themselves under the blankets. He peck a kiss on her lips before pushing his arm under her head to use as a pillow.
Harry opened a door and stepped in. When she opened her eyes to try to look, she noticed they were in her bedroom and he carefully laid her down on her comfortable bed.
He knows he’s just prolonging the agony but he cannot seem to convince himself to go and talk to Harry. It’s just been last night and the memory is still fresh. He’s afraid the talk might just end up in an argument he’s sure he cannot handle.
How lucky is he to be one gorgeous Draco Malfoy. He knew being in the Slytherin honed his confidence even more. He was so bold and so direct and Harry was so strong and full of energy and together? Oh, what a power.
Draco looked at the muscular figure and nodded while sighing gratefully. Even Pansy was shocked when they just arrived and introduced Harry to her. He visited her to inform her that his parents went to France and he'll be alone with an Auror to guard him and the Manor.
“Daddy! He groggily screamed when Harry had inserted another finger and continuously prodded at his prostate and pumped his fingers quick and hard. Able to send him in headspace where he felt himself floating and heard nothing but ringing and the sensations that sent frictions on his leaking hard cock. He felt his panties soaked with precum and the way his abdomen started to feel tight and to his balls.
He laid there for a while and panted. Harry’s words sliding through his right ear and out to his left one. He bit his lips and smirked after he regained his composure.
It didn’t take long when they arrived at the spot for the winter nighttown. Full of lights, fairies, other magical creatures that hovers in every decoration and some lovely choir singing soft Christmas tunes beside the huge Christmas tree.
His smirk didn’t falter. If ever, it only served to widen even more as he tried to provide his secretary this certain
Dracy’s left hand slid down and the next thing, Harry realized her fingers began to fondle with his balls, “Fuck, fuck, baby, oooh”
His cock sliding in and out, pumping deliciously at her, touching that place that sent jolts to her pleasurable body. But he made sure to be careful, not wanting to harm their child. The baby that could complete them.
He tilted his head to the side, teeth gnawing his bottom lip as he stared into the distance. They were currently seated at the gazebo, his parents sharing the news as if it was a mere kind of greeting. He crossed his legs, one hand cupping his cheek lazily while the other fidgeted with the black sando he is wearing.
“I’ll take an espresso and what about you, baby?” Harry turned to him and if he was butter, he would be melting on the floor.
He slid his hands down Draco’s butt and squeezed it hard. Draco moaned and curl a hand around Harry’s head.
He slid his hands up and down Draco’s back, feeling how the pillowy skin contrasted against his callous hands, the way it relaxed under the pressure of his hands, and the way it looks so good. Glistening against his dark skin. Fuck.
He chuckled and shook his head at the thought. Pretty sure if he pursue that career in poetry, all his subjects are gonna fall in two things—  Draco and his
The utter ridicule of what he heard sent his mind flaying away from inside his head. He doesn't even know if these two people are serious and if his secretary really did approve their floo call or owl to schedule a meeting with the head auror, Harry Potter himself.
“He’s accused of sex trafficking, drugs, smuggling of destructive weaponry, and running all illegal activities in this town”
He burned in anticipation when he felt his ass being pried open before a mouth pecked a kiss on his hole, fluttering and trying to woo for more. That’s it. More. He needs more.
Harry began to thrust slowly, feeling the way Draco hugged him and pulled him tight, as if he was sucking him in more and the way he felt him shuddered made Harry slightly lose control.
He turned back quickly with a clenched jaw and glared at the young boy. He then slammed him at the wall. Fuck it. Draco’s eyes widened and gasped.
Going there is something only the seventh and eight years are allowed to do with the same permission slip they needed to be signed. Although Draco believes the Headmistress bent the rules and allowed Harry without the slip.
“No, we really don’t. I’m sorry” Draco answered seriously, with his pounding headache he has enough of all the confusion, “What are you really talking about, Lovegood?”
“C’mon! It’ll be fun and besides we’re not getting anywhere so might as well have fun” he wiggled his eyebrows as he tightened his hold on him, “Come on. I know, I know you hate me, sure. But the lips says otherwise”
Draco stretched his left hand to the side as he let out an agitated noise. He was settled on the floor in his stomach and was busy holding a telescope to spy in Tom in his place. He’s been at it for an hour now and he’s beginning to feel numb.
He turned back to the man, observing his appearance. Fair skin, lovely nose and a cunning stare. He smirked, these types, from his experience, are usually kinky. Well, not like he’s complaining.
He smelled the whiff of alcohol in Harry’s breath and noticed his rosy cheeks, “You’re drunk” he stated.
Dracy smiled at the sight. The love she has for this man is overwhelming. She meant that in the best possible way.
“Harry, need you” he whispered but Harry ignored him. His tongue circled the head of his cock and tasted the precum that oozed out of its slit.
“I’m telling you now” Harry regretted even telling. He should’ve told it to Ron when they are alone but Hermione’s his great friend too. But sometimes, overreaction comes before reason with her. And that’s Harry wants to avoid after the stressful quarrel he had with the pregnant omega.
Things are carefully put in their designated places and even though it was obvious that the whole place still lacks complete supply of furniture and other necessities, Dracy was already envisioning the place to be so perfect.
, getting to know each other. All the laughter around their friends and they incessant teasing did them better than bad.
Walking over and grabbing a handful, Draco went to the counter and began his work. Harry have taught him about flower arrangements and since he’s been helping out here for a month now, Draco already got a hand for it.
His gaze shot up and fell into the man who suddenly stepped out of nowhere, smiling at him like a predator, allowing him to see a bit of darkness in his face. Shocked at the sight, Draco leaned closer to Harry and gripped is arms tight.
He wasn’t one for pet names but that one specifically did nothing but ground him more with acquiescence. His throat burned for his mewls and whimpers and it did not take long until he was bursting with his orgasm.
That’s what Dracy had noticed for the few days that passed since Harry learned that she’s pregnant. She’s sure that if this goes longer, she may end up on the streets. Worse than she used to be.
The en suite smelled like Harry already, able to mark the place as his. There's a laundry basket at the corner of the bathroom and he got another urge to go touch the sweatpants Harry wore this morning and pressed his face into it.
Draco found himself tensing when the hand slid down, palm gliding over the material of his dress smoothly and resting it below his spine. He fought a shiver and suppressed the action of swearing out loud.
Draco nodded, “I would love to, daddy” he said, loving the idea of Harry’s cock inside him all night.
“Just? Well, I’m open if you want to be more” he winked, wriggling his eyebrows playfully. Just say yes and he’ll throw him over that love seat and make love to him all night.
But he really do want to be with him today. They should be having fun, enjoying this nice sunny day, walking around the Malfoy grounds, hand in hand, or having a simple picnic at the garden, enjoying the view of those flowers dancing with his beauty.
Harry sighed and waved a hand before he let her slid down to the floor. She gasped by the soft sensation as her knees touched what should be a cold floor but met with a cushion feeling, comfortable and relaxing.
“Yes, yes. Fuck. Daddy” he whined, wandlessly murmuring a lubrication charm and inserting one finger in.
He gulped, feeling mixed up feelings at the moment as Harry smirked at him deviously, “And you’re going to be a good boy”
Harry smiled before pulling his softening cock out. His eyes darkened as he watched his cum leaked out Draco’s ass. He looks so pretty.
As Harry stares at him, he finds him beautiful. Laughing when Seamus lost another round of Wizard’s chess. Draco easily beating him with not more than ten moves. He played well.
Or is he going to prey in slowly, strutting gradually, stepping with sharp calculation as not to miss his goal? Hit the hay? Score the game? Win the game?
That sounded so good. So good. He grunted, feeling the rush of blood to his cock that’s starting to harden.
Harry went to sit at the corner and watched them with crossed arms. He kept a close eye on Draco and wished for the man holding his waist to do something out of line so he could throw him in the fucking Azkaban.
Just one look of his Moony’s intense gaze, he will know what kind Sirius needs for the day and just one blink at Remus’ direction in return, Siri would know how rough or how soft they want this to be.
She smiled at him and approached, her arms immediately encircling his waist and stood close to him, seeking warmth in his body. He put a hand around her shoulder as they both ignored the looks they were getting in their place.
He giggled as he remembered what had happened. The embrace, the kisses, and basically everything was breathtaking. He loved the way Harry was soft and hard at the same time. He didn’t hesitate to pound into him, driving into the hilt and made him a moaning mess.
“Let’s get you breakfast before getting ready” Harry helped her sit up and feed her the breakfast he brought to bed, “Don’t pout at me, baby. You’ll know soon”
He rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling, sitting up when he heard the front door opening and standing when he heard his name.
Harry lubbed his fingers and inserted a finger in, all the while his tongue fucked him, sliding as far as it could reach, feeling Draco’s hole clenching.
Her smell was filled of comforting smell, cinnamon and lavender that equally mixed just right. It was something he never smelled from other Omegas.
This time, she did hold back the gasp, her hands tightened its hold on his biceps as Dracy tried to keep her legs together.
Draco giggled as Pansy winked at him from the other side of the common room. Her eyes looked at him from head to toe, reading every detail of the simple outfit he chose for the night. Just a simple jeans, button down and coat.
Harry’s hand slid to his face, his thumb brushed over his lower lip and growling at the plush feeling. He felt his cock stirring inside his pants and if he only can, he would’ve been pounding Draco on his bike now.
It didn’t take a long time until he reached the private office, littered by his secretary and some guards patrolling the aisle. He waved the little ID he has—an indication that he has access on the floor.
Lucius look at the house, painted in colors of gray and white. The choice of color ought to be dull but he realized, it wasn’t. There were a huge parking space at the side with its own roof and own design. Several vehicles were parked, all looking luxurious and well-taken care of. Including motorbikes he knew Sirius would’ve love to own.
“How are you feeling?” he asked gently, one had cradling his waist to help him up while the other cupped his jaw and caressed his skin.
“Baby,” he let himself call him with the pet name. He cupped Draco’s nape and urge him to look. Draco rested his chin above his chest and watched, “Listen,”
He’s there. He whimpered and was about to explode for the second time when Harry pulled away. He sobbed desperately, “Please, let me cum, sir. Wanna cum, need to cum”
The chuckle went into a full on laugh and if it wasn’t the most atrocious thing he had ever heard, he doesn’t know what is. He made a noise of frustration and stood up, nearly stumbling back when he felt his numb feet slightly shaking.
Draco had thoughts both on opposite sides. His preferences being challenged the first time he met the man. He was all smiley back then, cheeky and flirty. Perhaps his trusting nature is what have brought him to where he—they are now.
"Lucius' son?" James asked, his arm wrapped around Lily's shoulders as all eyes were focused on their son.
Yes, he’s just that good and that isn’t coming from his bragging confidence. It just flows directly from his heart.
Harry nodded in agreement. Dracy really is nice. It’s a wonder how other people described her to be a spoiled brat. The woman can barely state what she wants.
“So sweet” Harry murmured adoringly as he pulled away to sit on his knees and stared at the beauty that presented herself in the simplest form possible. Harry could not explain what he’s feeling right now. Yesterday was so much of a toll on both of them but they managed to get out what was bothering them out of their system.
“Shall we get to the business, Mr. Cockybee?” Draco cut him off. Again. Like he always do when Harry starts to flirt while working. A gorgoues cockblocker.
“Deal with this too, please?” Harry gave him puppy eye and pouting his lips. Come on, kiss him like no other.
“Alright, alright. I apologize, sweet sugar omega. What’s the problem?” he willed himself to be serious and crossed his arms for the effect.
Andy smiled, “I have to say truthfully that is something I can make sure right now. But Dracy looks very healthy so the baby hopefully will be. We will monitor the growth and the baby and mommy’s health every month. By the second trimester, we will get to know the gender of the baby. That is of course if you’d like to know or if you would want it to be a surprise”
Draco’s eyes rolled back, nearly begging for his touch, getting a bit more frustrated as seconds tick by.
“Come for me, kitten” Remus whispered so low if it wasn’t for his Padfoot senses, he wouldn’t hear. His breath hitched as he came and came, his stomach covered with spurts of his come, sticky but so good. His noises got caught in the air as his legs trembled in their place on Remus’ shoulder, so wide open to accommodate not only his wide girth but his whole body too.
Draco sat down behind him and looked down. He shook his head for all the mess though he didn’t complain. Apparently, this is what the Roaring Lions have been so busy doing.
“Ssh, doll. Be a good boy” Harry whispered lowly, voice changing from that annoying one he uses when they bicker to that of a sex god that can send Draco into the moons.
Sirius laughed and laid a hand in his godson’s shoulder, “Little prongs, I don’t have a lot of anything sirius—fine, serious, to say because for me, there’s not much to think about”
Sirius, who was watching the Malfoy spouses, sighed. He sat across them, eyes perusing the way Lucius has his hands gripping his cane tightly while his wife, Narcissa, leaned her weight on his husband for support.
He stepped closer until they were inches apart, his arms encircling at Harry’s nape and tiptoed to peck him at his lips. He wanted to deepened it but Harry did not move.
He just needs to do something more important to comfort her. Ron will finish the dirty work for him, out of Dracy’s attention.
After minutes and several coughs from around, the seventh year made a smart decision to get away and he turned his attention back to his boyfriend and raised an eyebrow, “Follow me”
“You’re so adorable, sexytary” Harry leaned over. His smile turned into a smirk when Draco tried to act so tough and didn’t lean away. He met his gaze but there was that little tick of his jaw and that gulp.
Her breath hitched when Harry raised his hands, hovering just above the hemline of her dress, “I can fix them for you”
He sobbed without tears and drank again. He’s frustrated and angry and all. Why did Harry left him? Why didn’t he touch him after? Why did he leave?
“H-harry, please” he gasped. The sensations making him more needy as he felt precum wetting his skirt. He needs him in already.
“Please d-daddy. Want you so much” Draco cried and Harry inhaled sharply and cursed loudly. Hesitant lest he'll be caught acting on what Draco wants him to.
Mr. Malfoy shook his head, "I need an actual person with him all the time. The last Auror Guard we hired was of no use, Mr. Potter."
"Good morning" that young voice, angelic but a little monotonous and disoriented. He looked up and saw Draco wearing a simple silk robe that defined the beautiful form of his body. The silk giving him a smooth complexion. Harry had to clench his jaw to control any other thoughts that would wake the badness in him.
“Come on, sweetheart. I need to feel you, fuck, clench around me tightly. Yes, like that, love. Want you to cum for me, kitten. Want to feel and see you cum” Harry began to talk again, beginning to grow desperate himself.
He tried to really. Fight the urge to look down to stare at the ass that when naked is enough to obliviate him of the right morals and have his restraint blowing off but he cannot help it. Honestly, it really is just squishy and that's something he had not seen from other people his age.
Although no matter how content he is for how the things currently are, he cannot help himself but wonder what would happen if they take this a little notch higher.
He clenched his jaw. He wanted to talk to Draco, wanted to demand why he rejected then ran away but Hermione had convinced him it’s best they give time to avoid the chance of adding insult to injury.
How the fuck is he still so calm while she was already so ruined? She sobbed tearlessly. Tugging at her ties that just won’t budge.
Dracy’s eyes turned glassy and looked like she was getting emotional. The moment was overwhelming her. To hear someone ask her what she wants and needs felt like she’d been seen again but she’s still a little scared.
Omegas are known to be weak and dependent of their Alphas and Dracy doesn’t have one to lean on. There was just this particular scent that drew Harry in when he passed by at the bar she’s working on and when he went inside to look, he saw what may have been a real life painting. Straightly got from a magical brush and created the most stunning picture.
“Harry” he called, the name felt good on his tongue, moaning it like a bird chirping on early hours of the day,
“Oh, yes, definitely. That woman is brains, strength and leadership all in one. She’ll achieve anything she wants to”
Draco proceeded to rant and sobbed at the same time as he tells her what he thinks is the reason why Harry disappeared. Pansy listened at him patiently and would occasionally, squeezed his hands to relax him.
It wasn’t easy to worm his way in. Dracy Malfoy is just hard to woo. Plus the icy demeanor she seems to carry all around work seems to be too intimidating. But he rather finds it stimulating. All he wants to do right now is to get her out of this boring Ministry Gala, rip that gown off of her and have his way with her.
“Can you believe Hermione sends me a to-do list?” he broke the silence, cupping his cheek frustratingly, “The future Minister of Magic sends me a to-do list”
Dracy bucked her hips before she tried to scramble away, unable to carry on even more. Harry noticing the action, pulled back and smiled at her.
She hesitated for a moment as Harry hummed at her. She wasn’t afraid to ask but she dreaded for what his answer would be.
“Why, mate? Robards offered you a deal for a lifetime. Pretty sure with how ‘famous’ you are, you’ll be Head Auror in no time”
He sighed as he tried not to fall asleep in the middle of a Potions lecture going on about the Felix Felicis. Professor Slughorn was going on and on about how it is necessary they learn it until he decided it was enough and paired them to one another.
Because like he said, he is so much more. He is so much more than what Harry let other people see. Harry is the one he let Draco see. That much is true. For him to say the least.
He groaned when Harry pressed his body close to his, closing any distance, defying what could be referred to as close to comfort. He did nothing but moan.
He wouldn’t say he’s avoiding the talk of marking because he didn’t want to but because he wanted that conversation all between him and her only. It’s such a personal subject he wouldn’t want others trying to butt in.
Harry was left standing in the middle of the living room. Not knowing whether to let the boy be or follow him. This is harder than he expected.
Harry grabbed some squill bulb and juiced it as he was ordered, making sure not to stare a second too long at Malfoy’s spot. He distracted himself with the squill bulb and let his hand do the work, eyes looking over to the void.
The man able to humiliate and praise him at the same time. The only man Draco ever to let touch him in the most private of his areas and the only man he granted his own way in.
Harry pumped his fingers in and out, slowly, pushing and pulling as Draco clenched around the thick finger. Obscene moans drowning Harry’s heavy breathing as his mouth went back to his cock, taking him in languidly, teasing and sucking,
She let him cry all those emotions out. The reality that Harry held for so long crushed her own heart. She kissed him on the head for several times, letting some of her scent to comfort him, ease him, and hopefully, make him better.
"This will be your room, Harry." Draco gestured for him to go inside and this is not the guest room he stayed in last night.
Behind all their friends, Luna and Draco talk peacefully. Every now and then laughing at Seamus’ antics.
Harry chuckled, pulling his head away and grinning when another gasp fell in Draco’s mouth as he gripped his hair and tilted his head up, “Here are your rules, my love”
Now, he is sitting in a chair, back facing the door and drowning in the silence around him. All the noises outside, the clients waiting for their service and the new ones waiting for their appointments was silenced by the whole room.
“But do not ever think you’re not up to my standards. Because you’re even more than that, baby” he murmured, his head ducking down to suck on his neck.
He smirked as he took in the view of what he’s wearing. He had a new pair of red knickers, popping out for how pale his skin was. He just finished his bubble bath to make sure he’s as fresh as he can be.
Ron ruffled his hair annoyingly and threw him a rolled parchment. Harry easily dodged it and grinned. Sometimes, annoying Ron just makes his day but unlike before, his day has already been made by someone so strikingly enchanting. Someone darling, attractive and Harry would love to spoil to no end.
But he glared and his eyes intensified when the teens shouted because the bottle finally landed on Draco and Blaise. Blaise smirked and wriggled his eyebrows, matching the evil grin Draco is plastering in his face.
He was late for three hours to get to his pub because of the chores he needed to finish and for the minutes he sat down on his bed. He tried to prepare himself for whatever Harry is going to tell him.
Like it felt as if it was just only yesterday he needed to seduce Mayor James and now, he's trying to get a Senator around his pinky.
“It’s good to see you back again. Although I am aware not everyone decided to come back, I welcome you all like always. I hope we can bury the past in the past and not reopen wounds that are already healing” McGonagall started as she stands before them, “I hope you’ll enjoy this year fruitfully. Follow me”
He didn’t need more words as he let himself go and he spurted his cum inside Draco’s throbbing hole.
Remus smirked, summoning his wand from the bedside table, he pointed it at Sirius. He transfigured the shirt into a dress, surprising Sirius as the shirt transformed into a slutty black dress. Neckline so low, so short it cannot even fully cover his buttocks.
Once again, his hands found her chin, a finger brushing over to the corner of her lips and he murmured a spell. She immediately felt the tingling sensation of healing spell washing over her and she inhaled gratefully.
He swayed his hips and lowered it towards the guy's crotch. Harry glared at it severely. Holy aguamenti. House of Potter morals. He's trying to call on things to guide him through the whole process of Draco's lap dance to fucking someone.
“You should try it! I’ve tried that one before and let me tell you, it’s worse than those Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans,” he pushed Harry on position, “Try it! Try it, try it!”
“Headache?” Harry said and walked over to his side, Draco has to look away so he wouldn’t look at the mountain of muscles but turned his head back when he felt something on his arms. He saw a vial of potion.
Harry walked them to his bed, waving a hand to close and lock the door, turn the lights off, and turning the curtains open to let in the moonlight.
While waiting for his order, he looked around the shop. The Patil twins have some great shop and good business too. It’s been known around the Wizarding World and have been servicing the Ministry of Magic parties for flower designs. And according to the rumor Harry heard from Hermione, they might even expand the business in the Muggle world.
Her eyes blinked as her lips parted. She cannot believe her eyes! She cannot let the tears slipping out of her eyes as she stared at the beauty of what Harry was holding out for her on his knees. On is knees!
He met Harry James Potter. The man he have not met when he was still hiding who he really was. The man he didn’t know because their past years have been covered with bickering and arguments.
She didn’t know what she expected when Wily knocked on her bedroom door and told her Harry wants her. But to feel those hands in her body was not it. His fingers are slightly calloused but gentle on its movements. She watched the hand go higher.
"You know, if you really don't want to, you can assign the job to the Auror guards, Harry" Ron kindly suggested.
“I wanted us to live somewhere peaceful especially when our little beanie’s near on the way. That is why I have put the baby’s crib in my room for a while and will be transferred here soon. I know this may not be the perfect surprise and I am not really good with my words but,” he paused darting his tongue out to lick his lips.
Draco had half expected Harry to touch him when he got off, expected to lay down beside him and pull him close to his body but what he heard was a door opening and a door slammed closed loudly.
Dracy was glad the woman was able to hold herself professionally and didn’t gush with vivacious curiosity as to why a certain Dracy Malfoy is with a certain Harry Potter.
"Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy's going to France." he explained and shrunk his suitcases. He grabbed his motorcycle keys and began to leave.
His skin looked so pale almost as if there's no blood inside him at all. It's inviting and coaxing. And that fucking ass that wiggles as he moves. Fuck he would pay millions of galleons to feel those two cheeks on his palm and play with it like a stress ball. And the way he bent down to put on his fucking thong is nothing but lavishly wonderful. He had a glimpse of that pink puckered hole, it looked so tight and he would gladly loosen him up.
She bit her lips before nodding. Harry moved a bit, unpacking the foods from the basket before he gently started to feed her with pasta.
His shoulders rested into the bed while his ass was propped into the air. Harry’s left hand held his wrists behind while the other spanks him. The bed frame shook in time of Harry’s thrusts, creaking with noises as Draco’s eyes stung with tears, loving the slaps Harry was delivering into his ass, soothing them right after.
Harry who wore the same flustered expression clenched his jaw and walked away, wondering whether pearl dust really pushed it this worst. Or was it right to label it as worst?
He made a move but stopped when Draco whined, not letting him get away and he chuckled. How he loves this soft boy in the morning, needing more attention.
Draco’s head swims in wanton lust, horny and feeling his own erection poking Harry’s hard abdomen, smearing it with his precum. His fingers carded through Harry’s hair as he felt him move, slowly but with force until gradually, his pace quickened.
She cussed in her mind. That tongue, fuck that mouth on him. He was skilled as a master, all that talent focused on her. She’s not letting this go.
He was busy enjoying the beat of the sensual music, every drop entering through his ears merely as a signal of what moves he should do. His hands slid up and down the pole, cold metal hitting his warm hands as he bucked up and down.
“Silence, Draco” his father interrupted, voice cold and dark that immediately shut Draco up. He huffed and leaned on the chair, crossing his arms in the process and glared at the desk.
She whined, already sopping wet even without Harry’s fingers on her. Merlin, she’s nothing but a horny pregnant woman. She bucked into him desperately, wanting to feel Harry’s tongue on her pussy lips before teasing on her overly sensitive clit, tugging and playing with it.
He stood up silently and approached where she stood few feet away. He made sure the strong locking and silencing charms are in its place so they wouldn’t be overhead. For this time is not for the public to see. And not ever, beginning now.
He decided to take a bath, not even properly taking his time as he dressed in muggle leggings and an oversized shirt.
He took in her appearance and was satisfied when she followed her orders. Rightfully and carefully so.
Things are getting out of hand and she’s starting to grow needy. There are nights she would wish for Harry beside her and there are times she wants to punch that hell of a man. It’s irritating her how emotional she’s turning out to be all because of this pregnancy.
He only hummed and gestured for her to come closer. She crawled at the edge of the bed and looked up, tongue licking her lips at the sight of his dazed expression.
He’s pretty sure he heard that name many times now, read it in various elite magazines. Pansy is right. This man is fuck ton wealthy. Wealthy to the point of unease and problem. He’s just that rich.
“A-alpha” she whimpered, feeling her pussy letting out some slick. The need of an alpha inside him was so strong. She missed Harry’s presence, touch, kisses. She missed all of him that she begged, “Please”
The man cleared his throat, aware of the tension between the both of them as he took a step to the side and pulled his hands away from her.
What’s the use of his education if he’s not knowledgeable enough on how to avoid this kind of stuff?
“That’s it. Doing so good, little one. Doing so good” Harry whispered, pumping his hand up and down as he continued his assault in his throbbing hole.
Draco felt the signs of an upcoming smile so he hid it by clearing his throat, “Even if I’m a stripper?”
"Are you losing control?" Draco taunted and raised a hand where he slid an index finger up and down Harry's arm. He reveled the way Harry tensed so he decided to go for more.
"But daddy" Draco whined, risking to take a little risk and crossed a delicate line that could really tell him where this might really be going, in bed or in vain.
“I said strip, kitten. All of it” as if sensing his hesitation, Harry spoke without turning his back around to look at him. He was busy standing in front of the cabinet and exploring what is inside it.
The man crouched down as he gently wrapped a hand around his shoulder to lift Draco’s upper body up and let him lean on his left leg, “What have you done?”
Draco clenched his jaw hearing Harry’s husky voice— when did he become Harry? And did he just say husky voice?
Harry smiled and dipped his head low, meeting his lips halfway as they exchanged passionate kisses under the meteor shower. Not minding those around them because as they say
“Feelin’ better?” he asked, his eyes sliding up to check for any signs of discomfort. But what he saw definitely was such a sight to behold. His cock hardening at the look of pure bliss on Dracy’s face. Her eyes were closed as she savored his hold and lips parted as she gasps and panted.
“Wanna have my way with you, baby” Harry whispered, lips ghosting against his ear and Draco whimpered in response.
Looking around the eight year table, he saw the lot doing everything but study. Neville got his huge Advanced Herbology book that literally spits out poison if not properly handled (which he is currently and hardly dealing with), Dean was staring into the abyss of his Transfiguration notes— having lost all hope when he failed to turn his boyfriend into a toad.
She took the snack and was about to eat it when upon taking a whiff of its smell, her stomach churned and she made a beeline towards the bathroom. Her stomach barrelled as she emptied her tummy, the energy it took her to vomit tire her out and she whined at the headache seeping in.
He stared straight as those eyes, challenging him to touch Harry one more time and he really will curse him. Reputation be damned. If he is Harry’s, then it’s only fitting it goes the same way for him, right?
“What a damn playboy! Seriously no manners at all! A fool who can’t even read French! That nightmare of a smirk! And those ridiculous bulge! Wow! A lunatic”
She sighed. She’s feeling a slightly dizzy right now and the mood to berate even just an innocent book is trying to claw its way out on her. She’s been on the bad mood for the past few hours and it’s not helping that Harry is busy talking with Ron and Hermione at the living room.
Dracy felt her cheeks warmed. She had experience with men gawking at her in the bedroom but none were as bold and intense as Harry was doing with simple fucking words. It does all things unimaginable to her and she had the sudden desire to ride him all night.
Harry peppered kisses on his shoulder, “While in the process of doing so, I am going to tell you all the filthy little things I am going to do to you” His right hand found its way to his throat, choking him and steadying him as his knees threatened to give out from how eagerness his body seems to be reacting.
She can feel how tense the air was inside, the physical silence did nothing to mute the noises in the people’s heads. She can feel their glued stay on her back and she was beginning to feel uneasy if not for Harry squeezing her side now and then.
She heard tales of his magnificence, not just in work but also in bed. From whispering omegas in Diagon Alley and parties she used to be a part in. He’s not just good or better than others, those omegas who had successfully found their way in had claimed he’s the best.
“Mr. Malfoy, I do not think this is appropriate” he mumbled, though his voice came out a bit breathy.
Harry laid Draco down on the bed and for a second, stared at the look on the little boy’s face. Already so distracted and looking debauched even just from the kiss that Harry was instantly hard on his pants.
Sirius didn’t respond to Lily right away. The words falling alongside his tongue, his mind twirling and trying to decide how to blurt out the favor that’s not actually a favor.
“Then you don’t have anythin’ to worry ‘bout. If McGonagall doesn’t say anything, then things’ fine”
The door opened and appeared one blushing Dracy, toying with her fingers. One that Harry noticed she does whenever she’s feeling nervous, afraid, or ashamed.
Throwing his head back, he began to thrust his fingers, adding another one as Harry guided him through it with his curses and his words and his constant urging to get him out of the magical bonds.
Lifting his eyes up, all joyous mood gone, he looked at Harry and gave him a small smile, “Perhaps we could return in another day?”
“I’m just worried he didn’t like what happened between us. Although Dobby told me he left in a hurry”
he’s one step away from begging really desperately. His skin felt like it was on fire as his mind stopped supplying anything good. All he could feel was the onslaught of pleasure seeping through his skin by listening to the filthy words, his voice, his warmth.
Surprisingly, the man let him take his time. He stared and there was a hint of smile on his lips as he let Draco skim his cheeks with his fingers. The softness of his small hands have given him more desire to protect him and lock him inside the cabin. Away from everyone.
“Draco honey, it’s not that I don’t want to hear your thoughts but that issue is something you should be talking about him. Clear the stuff between you two and ask him when he arrives then tell me after”
Sexiest? Fuck, Harry would love to see that but there’s time for that. If they really do have time for that.
He can smell Harry even from where he is and he’s not saying it doesn’t have any effect on him but he’s also not going to admit it.
Draco’s body thundered with anticipation as the kind façade dropped. It was replaced by intense promises, heat tethering into a full blown madness as he looked sternly, pissed by the display of Draco’s unabashed seduction.
Parvati laughed, “Those days are golden. I’m happy too. We just opened another store in Hogsmeade. Padma’s there now, finishing up the place”
” he begged, hoping to not receive any punishment that will only traumatize him rather than to make him learn a lesson. His wrists still slightly sore from wearing handcuffs for the whole week last week when he refused to kiss the man.
“Fair play, I see. That’s enough” Harry paused, “You’re going to cook meals and clean the house. Other chores not stated are going to be done by the house elf”
Harry sighed. Guess they’re still a bit of enemies then. Was the two weeks of silence just a preparation time for the bickering to start again?
He gasped, hands harshly tugging on his wrists and ignoring the sharp stab of pain it caused. Harry’s tongue licked the head of his cock, gathering his precum on his mouth and tasting his juices.
“Ready?” Harry asked as he stood in front of him, lacing their fingers together and raising an eyebrow when he noticed he did not wear any gloves.
“I am not buying you with flowers. I am simply giving you flowers” Harry leaned down and sported his puppy eyes, “Forgive this Alpha”
She knew she’ll love it no matter how much it would be a torture as much as it is going to be pleasure.
He knows he’s an asshole in some people’s eyes. He may come off as condescending especially when they misinterpret what he’s saying but there are just some things even a strong Alpha like him never did try to cross.
He nodded instantly, moaning as Harry’s heat practically seep to his own body. The broad torso Harry displayed before his eyes was a sight to behold and Draco raked his gaze down to the obvious huge bulge on his pants, bigger than what he saw back at his office.
before rushing out to go leave. He began to plan how to rejoice in delight. And began to do his celebratory dance inside his mind as he trekked towards the door, walk away with another success of seducing another man.
Luna glanced at him and nodded, “I’m alright, Harry. I was just thinking about my father. You see, he decided to spend the Christmas in my mother’s grave”
Is there something wrong between them? Maybe there’s some issue between them that Draco wasn’t able to see?
What’s even more ridiculous was when neither of them debunked the rumors flying around. As more often than not, his eyes stare at Harry’s to his body and would blush if he gets caught. Though he claims the answering winks he gets in return were enough.
He felt the edge of the bed dipped when Harry raised a knee and tentatively laid his palms on Draco’s back. He nearly moaned once more when he felt the heat seeped into his skin. Just those hands, merely Harry’s hands are dribbling with incredible ticklish heat that pushed him to pop his butt out and wiggle it beguilingly.
“You should enjoy the day out there” Harry encouraged and offered a small smile, “C’mon. You wanna go to Hogsmeade with me?”
“You’re staring” he heard Pansy stated beside him, a smile ghosting over her lips, “I’ve caught you like two? Four times? Is there something you’re not telling me, Dray?” it was the cunning tone in her that has him rolling his eyes.
He helped him out of his clothes before Harry took his own off. He latched his lips on Draco’s collarbone and bit. Draco mewled, feeling the way his cock began to harden as Harry pawed on his nipples.
Draco tilted his head and pretended to think, “I’ll have to check my schedule first. Make sure I won’t be so busy. Thank you for the offer by the way” he pinch Harry’s leg, hiding a chuckle as he felt the man tense.
Never did once he tried to occur on his mind that he was disappointed with what happened between them. He didn’t try to think that maybe Harry felt so failed and so bad. He didn’t blame himself for what happened but when third day came, all came crushing down.
It's not too late, isn't it? He can still walk out and leave but he's here. Very much enthusiastic and willing as he gently walk towards Harry and straddle his lap.
“Is it really time to clarify that now?” he whispered, hands wandering all over Draco’s body before it nestled on his ass, both cheeks under each of his palms and lifting him up easily.
He greets her when he arrives from the Ministry, eat food in silence then that would be it. End of the day. No kisses, no hugging, no sweet anything. She had even thought of letting out her scent to entice him but it didn’t have the reaction she was aiming for and she ended up embarrassing herself.
She panted and gasped and everything she could only do given the restrictions on her part. She loved his lips, his mouth on her and her impatience was threatening to spill out from her system.
And as they both released their own orgasm. Draco on the kitchen counter and Harry inside him, they panted, chest heaving and racing to gain back the air they’ve spent. There were no words being exchanged as he winced when Harry pulled out.
The others are already waiting outside of the tower, ready to go to Hogsmeade with McGonagall’s consent. Everyone is very thrilled to try the new Hogsmeade winter nighttown, with little magical shops that just scream Christmas, fun and celebration.
As they took a step, eyes following their movements, noises getting louder, Dracy’s hands tremble lightly. Maybe it really was too much.
His gasp resonated the bedroom as Harry entered another finger, rougher than the first two and increased the pace. He began to moan louder now, holding on Harry’s words, trying to keep his eyes looking at his gorgeous Daddy, leaning his body even more as he savored the feel of Harry’s hard cock pushing on his back.
With one slow but hard thrust, she threw her head back, clenching around the cock that invaded her insides, nearly crushing her to such orgasmic state. When she adjusted to his size, she began to lift herself up before sliding back down, riding him, hands gripping him at the back of his head and tugging as she whimpered.
He wasn’t even sure whether he’s to brood, emote, cry, or punch someone he sees. It would’ve been better if he meets some asshole he can beat to vent some things out. He immediately wanted to sort things out between them but he wanted to spare himself a scratch of pride.
Draco shook his head before he leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, his left hand untangling from his nape to rub at his chest, “Always you, Harry”
“Harry” she smiled, taking his coat off his hands and laying it on the back of the couch. Harry immediately hugged her by the waist and kissed her full on the mouth, letting the woman know how much he missed her with the kiss.
Harry looked like he still had something to say but didn’t. He took a deep breath before standing up and raising a hand to cup Draco’s cheek, “You know where I’ll be if you wanna talk, angel”
When she thought she still have someone, she found herself alone. He abandoned her. He let her fend for herself. He left her with nothing to hold onto. He left her. As heartbreaking as that. As cruel like that. He just left.
It was Harry’s turn roll his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. If you ask Draco, of course he did not look. Those muscles are fake. Definitely fake.
“How was your sleep?” he asked, moving to get closer to collect her in his arms and like any other day, he pulled her to sit on his lap, sideways.
"What's he like?" Ron asked curiously and Harry shrugged. Not knowing how to really say what he's like because he can think of multiple things, words and adjectives to describe the storm that's slowly preparing itself to devastate his throne.
She let Harry order for her as she literally glued her stare at the table. The next minute that she was silent, Harry’s hand rested on top of her thighs before giving it a comforting squeeze, “Are you alright?”
Dracy’s eyes shot up and she quickly shook her head, “No, no. I’m just saying it’s enough” she whispered.
After drinking his juice in one go, he stood up and made his way to the Gryffindor table, not liking what he is seeing. He squinted his eyes when the student had the foolish courage to lean his head on his daddy’s shoulder and had the though process to run that sinful hand in those biceps meant to hold Draco down and no other.
Nope, nope. He hates this man. They can’t be. He can’t be. Draco’s like a type AB negative and Harry’s type R—really cannot be. He downed the glass and took another one.
Because little by little, a part of him dies. His weakness was what Harry targeted. He drained him of strength to pull away, to stop him of stabbing him with heartbreaking pain. As he lies in his bed at night, he wished someday he can.
Don’t blame him. There’s just something in Harry Draco cannot quite name. Like the riddle that’s pretty hard to answer and a puzzles with a missing piece like bleh.
“Ohh, harry” Dracy felt the quick relief that washed over her body. She loves the way Harry’s warm mouth suck on her as if he was starving and the groans from the back of his throat, obviously enjoying what he is doing.
He was right. Something just happened. His breathing grew quite heavy and sweat starts to form in his temple as they stare at one another.
Draco made sure of the schedule, made sure not to have a flaw on his plan. He never disappoints. Not when he was very well wounded at the lack of reaction he is getting from him.
It wasn’t the fact that someone painted with tattoos, glorious mane tied up into a messy bun, earrings, and have a casual smirk stretched on his lips that opposes the steely gaze on his eyes.
But he knew Harry will not pounce on him at the first try of his seduction techniques. Harry will not succumb to Draco by a single way. He will not touch Draco at the first attempt to play his cards. So, Draco will prepare a stack of it. Use it one by one and slowly, hopefully, he will be able to get him to his bed.
Dracy nodded. She wasn’t sure she’s understanding what Harry was saying because she was focused on remembering the blast they had yesterday. Who would have expected they could be so active?
Ingredient for a love potion. His face heated as he stared at her, “W-what do you mean, Professor? We practically have some love potion in us? Isn’t there an antidote or something?”
Not the boss like leader. But the boss boss. The man possesses the stamina Draco may have experienced now twice, thrice or who knows how many times? And well, in good days, have tried to steer the wheel in his own hands.
“Y-yes. Yes, sir” he said, unable to weigh the truthfulness and fakeness of his response. The chamomile tea truly soothed his nerves but there’s more to it.
“It’s what I see, Harry. Don’t you know what they are?” she asked, taking a step closer to inspect them.
His teeth is grazing the smooth skin and without informing him, she came. She gripped him by the wrist tightly to support herself from falling face first into the bed.
What happened last night keeps on repeating back inside her mind. The way those fingers touched her intimately, fucked her just right, and tired her even when she wasn’t giving but just taking and receiving.
“Excuse me, but where is Mr. Harry Potter? Draco would love to meet his fianceé” his father had to ask at some point. And why is he calling him his fianceé?! He isn’t his fianceé!
Draco gasped. His hands coming to touch Harry on the chest. He felt him stilled at his palm. He doesn’t understand where Harry is going with this but he wanted to. But he wanted it more to hug him because he misses him so much. And he did.
He didn’t know how he got himself here. He didn’t understand why he is where he is right now. After all, the last few bits of what happened began to be hazy, a fog digging through his memories, layering what reality is there outside of those door locked. Separating him out of the life outside.
” he cried out, back arching as he inserted another finger and began to earnestly finger fuck himself, making sure to stretch him wide.
He looked up and saw Harry already staring at him with a gentleman smile, “What are you doing, Mr. Malfoy?”
Harry shook his hand with the Minister right after their meeting, putting statements out to conclude the torturous hour he have to sit upright on the swivel chair, with people of different departments and talking about Merlin knows what.
Of course, he didn’t. Maybe he can just smother him with the cushion? Or his lips? He’s definitely losing his mind. Just one day with this man and he’s already as messy as that silly nest above Harry’s head.
Dracy bit her bottom lips which Harry thought was a huge mistake because he suddenly wanted them on his own.
There was a low light coming from the center of the ceiling and a lot cooler than outside. The office was simple with papers on the desk and a laptop.
He continued his rough pace and bruising hold. It didn’t take long before Draco was clenching hard around him. Harry moaned at the feeling of his tight hole hugging him as if it didn’t want to let go of his cock ever.
Draco cried out and tried to lift himself off to meet Harry but found he couldn’t when he had no energy to use. His mind is swirling in the certain space that had him speechless. All he wanted is for Harry to come so he could feel his juices inside.
Dracy moaned at the sight. He’s fucking huge and her head fell back. His image ingrained in her mind. The bulbous head, the veins around the side of his dick, the leaky slit and his heavy balls.
Harry smiled before magically activating the timer that could prompt the stove to turn off on its own once their dinner is cooked.
When evening came, Harry tried to busy himself with reading cases from work when they finished eating. He is on the veranda of his room, just wearing his pajama pants and half naked.
Nimble fingers tugged his silk robes open, pulling them back and letting it pool on the floor. Harry pulled back and raked an adoring glance on his body, palms sliding to his collarbone, down to his chest to his taut stomach and stopping before it reaches further down.
Draco rolled his eyes inwardly at his father's statement. Act nice there, act nice that. His father is obsessed with acting nicely, giving the right impressions and it's no wonder he's an only child. He's probably boring.
“Can’t believe you’re round with our little beanie, baby. All soft and swelling” he cannot help the chuckle that sneak its way out of his mouth at the way Dracy leaned her back to his front and looked up.
“How’s our mommy to be?” Andy smiled as she walked inside the room, looking at Dracy who’s ready for her seventh month check up.
His eyebrows furrowed and what a fucking sight. It’s not always Remus can prompt a confusion in that lovely face.
Harry extended his hands, “Come on, now. Get down here, doll” he said softly, aware of the eyes that’s watching them and those phrases that very much don’t fall under appreciative ears.
“Fuck. A-alpha, oooh” Draco sobbed out, his legs trembling as they wound around Harry’s head, caging him in and that excellent tongue and talented fingers doing everything they can to give him the most pleasure.
The man cleared his throat and said something completely flirtatious that has Draco’s insides plummeting.
But the Ministry just had to come between that. He doesn’t even know what he has to do with this. They were talking about cases involving the Romanian organization that set their footing in an illegal business.
“Oh, you’re so dramatic. You literally created your own drama in your site! Your fans are all agog!”
He walked inside, ready to throw the well known Draco Malfoy century old tantrum but stopped when he saw Harry casually leaning back on the headboard, right hand resting at the back of his head while the other held a smoke he’s nearing to finishing up.
She cried out as one of Harry’s hands slid down and played with her clit through her clothes. He pressed on it before drawing intense circles.
“I’m trying!” Harry murmured, tossing the second spear which nearly hit one, “They are very wiggly. Can I stun them?”
It baffles her to no end that Harry acted so casual back that night then it pains her when she observed that Harry had gone a little colder. He didn’t shout but he’s not talking to her anymore unless it’s something important.
“So, what do you need?” Lily questioned, her eyes watching over James who conversed with their family doctor as he began to take a small machine of some kind? Sirius didn’t know what it’s called and did not bother to learn what it is.
He smiled seductively, swaying his hips as he tossed the sleeves to the floor, “Daddy will learn his lesson not to make me jealous”
“Harry?” he called tentatively, not wanting to break the peacefulness but needing a bit of steady conversation.
Harry sighed and stared at Remus who only shrugged and laugh at him, "Be careful sweetie. I know you can guard him easily" Lily smiled at his son and Harry just nodded
Her smell is getting stronger that it makes him vulnerable. As he stepped closer until he was standing in front of the door. He can hear groans and mewls coming from inside and when he knocked, he heard his name being called.
Notwithstanding that the halls are packed of ogling third years and gushing first years, they stood well fitting.
Harry chuckled at his winsome trait as he settled his gaze at the ceiling, focusing on something that has been in his mind since his conversation with Luna. It’s been bothering him nonstop throughout the day and no matter how much he brushes it off, he cannot seem to.
His eyes immediately settled by the figure that entered the dining. All too informal with a smirk plastered on the face.
Being friends with Seamus and the others are a thing and being with Draco is another. They do not have the platonic—
She also had contemplations to enter Harry’s bedroom especially when she notices herself to get needy but just one call of his name, he would come and take her then and there.
Eventually, Pansy and Blaise stopped trying to convinced him. They left an hour ago with Pansy’s warning that if his fear get in the way longer than necessary, she’ll pull him out of his shell no matter what.
They stood by the wall and let Harry decide on the next action. Draco stared at the wall in front of him, not even bothering trying to listen to the noises inside but he could make out Tom’s voice.
“Hey, little beanie. Have a nice night” he murmured before sliding back up and sucking at her nipples for the whole minute. His hard cock painful on its confines at the taste of her milk. But no, fuck no. He could just use a cold shower later.
The usual leniency he emanated was easily replaced by something beguiling. His chest heaved as he watched Harry tossed his sleeves haphazardly to the floor, eyes washing over his nudity, stopping at his cock before going back up.
Harry smiled, “Ssh. You can, princess. You’re doing so good. Clenching around my fingers, taking me so well, you’re doing good, baby”
, more—fuck yeah” he sobbed as warm mouth took his cock, pumping his head immediately up and down his shaft, not giving him a moment of relief as he was assaulted by pleasure mixed with tinging sensation on his body, wracking him up with combined emotions.
He whimpered. He didn’t know how they got into this situation but he didn’t mind about it for now as he felt the slick oozed out from his hole.
“Harder, moony. Harder” he begged, feeling the way his thick cock pounded gayly at his prostate, milking more of his precum as it bobbed on his abdomen, not at all soft from his orgasm a second ago.
Draco glared before turning to the bartender who awaits for their order, watching with a smile, “I’ll get an iced tea”
Dracy looked away, fighting the tears welling up in her eyes. Her hands fisting the sides of the shirt she’s wearing, “They’re right. You’re a jerk”
“Mate, you did a huge step the day you made a decision to pull her out of that bar. That’s a huge step that completely changed everything. What more do you need? If you didn’t get her to mark her, then what’s the reason? Just an omega to warm your bed? And if it’s not huge step for you, then what is?”
He just happily showed them a magic to conclude all of his explanations and the revelations of who he is. James had gone paler and his aristocratic aura had been lessened to that one eating in disbelief and one blink away from fainting.
“Just so you wait until we’re back at your room, I would fuck you so hard, baby boy. Have you ride my hard cock until you’re quivering at my mercy. You’ll be so full of daddy’s cum both inside out. You’ll be so spent and so tired but still want more” he whispered sexily, his mouth latching on the skin of Draco’s throat.
Why would they care? Ron have handled the newspapers already and if their name sprouts in one of the release, he will lose his fucking shit.
Harry opened his mouth to counter her but she clicked her tongue in displeasure, “Off you go, Potter. I have a visit from the Ministry in ten minutes”
“Oh, good morning, doll” Harry said with that fucking smirk. Okay, maybe he has the hottest smirk too but Harry smirks like all the time. All the time, more than what’s necessary and it's putting Draco off.
Blessed with good heat, wetness, and distinct skills only Harry can find in the young boy. Although he sounded so fucking pedophile even if he was not. If he was anything, he is filthy.
Loneliness eats him whenever Harry’s away and his insecurities come back rushing in, if he didn’t hear Harry’s voice for too long, he might end up thinking he had found another one to replace him. But he never failed. Harry never failed.
She whined silently. She doesn’t even know what she wants right now. As she watched Andy stood up after a healer came into the room, she excused herself and rushed out. Harry immediately turned to her and smiled.
Harry didn’t answer and continued what he was doing. He kissed him on the legs and Draco opened up even more, wanting to feel his cock inside him, make him moan in ecstasy and kiss him like he’d kissed the night before, hug like he’d hugged him to sleep and touch him like he had yesterday and like how he possibly will beginning now.
“It’s a’right. You’re okay. Do you need anything?” he asked and Draco took a while to answer. Completely in awe but in question of the kindness. Not overly stepping but also not disregarding. Wow.
Dracy opened her eyes, her sight immediately coming in contact with her bedroom’s ceiling followed by feeling something soft on her stomach.
Harry clenched his jaw and walked over to her, pulling her close to his chest and kissed her on the lips before immediately burying his head at the crook of her neck.
The door opened to reveal the most spectacular executive assistant he ever had. Sexy, even more capable with dealing shits than he does, excellent performance, nice scent, everyday free show of that wonderful bum, shapey legs, and that nice blonde hair that’s actually pretty good to pull back, grip tight.
Luna smiled knowingly, once again bothering Harry’s mind. He doesn’t know if it’s for the better this time or adding more mystery to the riddle like statements she told him few days ago and those before that.
. Good luck. Rules still apply to you, students. I give no special treatment. Good night” McGonagall stated firmly, her lips set into a line as she walks away.
Just one question. One and if Draco’s determined to stand by his answer, Harry will walk and drive away from his life.
Draco grumbled in annoyance as he scanned the bookshelves, trying his hardest to look for one certain book he has to study for the upcoming quiz next Monday.
“Pansy, I refuse to die in a bar!” Draco blinked and exclaimed as they stand in front of its entrance.
"You didn't answer my question, Harry. Are you, by any chance, courting someone?" Draco repeated his questions hours earlier.
As they eat their own meals, Draco looked around the restaurant. It really is nice. Neat, elegant, and rich. They had settled on a private booth inside the place, making sure there aren’t anyone gawking at them and possibly, start a rumor if they’re spotted by a camera together.
“’arry” she whined, eyes settling on the messy hair and the white shirt that should be considered illegal. It clung to him perfectly. She stood beside the Alpha and pouted at him, “Hungry”
“What happened when you went to observe the rogue Russians?” he raised an eyebrow, tone firm and cold.
He let out a soft whine, hands moving on its own and laced with it with Harry’s left, “Harry” he tugged it away from his cock, needing and wanting something more.
She was sitting at the floor and leaning at one of the shelves with a book on her lap and eyes closed. Harry stood in the doorway for seconds just watching her. She was simply wearing a sleeveless top and a skirt and bare footed.
“Mate, calm down” Seamus shot a hand up, motioning for him to relax as he untangled himself from his boyfriend, “Breathe, Harry”
“W-what’s your name, sir?” he bravely asked, making his tone innocently sweet, trying his best to urge the man to answer. He badly needed his captor’s name. The devil of a man. But he was aware of what his parents used to say,
“Yeah, yeah. I’m distracted. I’m aware, Malfoy” Harry mumbled, crossing his arms over his chest as he gave Malfoy a once-over. He noticed the redness in his neck as he spluttered what seemed to be obscenities as he stirred the cauldron.
That squishy ass should only be his to see and feel but hell. Draco conjured a seat and Zayan sat there. The watchers are smiling and clapping and cheering on Draco's tempting figure as he began to sway his hips. That ass full on view for others to see as well and Harry felt the surge of jealousy and possessiveness boil inside him.
His eyes widened as he tried to pull back but Harry only tightened his hold on him before tucking the other side of the blanket on him, “Relax, Draco” he whispered near his ear.
“I noticed Mr. Malfoy and you are getting along quite well” she pointed out. There it is. The talk that should be talked about.
He moaned loudly as Harry inserted a finger, quickly pumping it inside, prodding and after a minute, sliding another one. He felt the slight tinge of pain mixed with his pleasure and Draco just thought of one word.
The little one looked so lost. So defeated. As if he’s carrying the heaviest of problems in the world. How can Harry make him understand?
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and pretended to act nonchalant. His strict resolve is merely holding on at the moment because Draco managed to crack it within the short time he met him.
“As you know, I should not be engaging in such acts with you. We are in a public space, if you could keep your hands to yourself, that would be deeply appreciated” he squeezed his wrist gently.
The article have been ridiculously biased. Praising him with backhanded compliments and full on bashing the omega that was seen in his arms. Reading such blatant display of condescension and awful statements of fraudulent claims, Harry all have the leverage to debunked them with a flick.
"What about the case with the rogue Russian wizards that's trying to create their secret base up in Giants' mountains? Or the illegal auction for dragons happening? Charlie's been bugging me to arrest those people" Ron shrugged, "You're needed in those highly private cases, Harry. You cannot just deploy Aurors and expect them to succeed without you accompanying them"
The door opened and stepped in a fresh looking Cedric with his friendly smile and kind demeanor. The man known to be the gentlest among the gang he belongs in and handsome too. He was followed by his girlfriend, Cho. After waving and smiling at him, they sat down by the window as a waitress asked them their order.
“It was such a nice surprise to see you here tonight. I thought you’d be more at home, trying to settle in and y’know” he wiggled his eyebrows as to suggest something and Draco fought the urge to grimace in disgust.
Then he smiled, “I see you’ve found my place. Welcome to the bar. Now that you’re here, would you like to come in?”
Harry was about to take another step when he cursed aloud when someone from the corner pulled him by the wrist.
He laughed. Okay, it’s enough. The dragon is awake. Why did he hire this sexytary again? Yeah right. Sexy, sexy baby.
“Draco, love, let’s go” he faintly heard Harry whisper, his eyes rounding to the whole area just as people stared at them in a way. Some were in awe of Harry’s presence while most of them frowned and sneered at Draco’s.
“Anyway, these are my associates, Ron Weasley, Blaise Zabini and Hermione Granger. Everyone, this is Senator Lucius’ son, Draco Malfoy”
Red sign number two. Emergency protocols are on. Harry sat up straighter. In this kinds of moments, he admits he is a playboy. And he knows a predator when he see one.
Luna, however, thought nothing of it as she sighed, “I'm not seeing wrackspurts and blibbering humdingers with you. Maybe they’ve settled down”
He cannot describe with one specific word because Harry is everything good and yet, hard. Everything that’s so nice and so sexy.
She hummed silently as she finished making Harry’s morning coffee. She set it on his usual seat whenever they eat and began to cook simple breakfast after. She’s not much of a good cook and even the simple meals she knows how to make had taken her months of practice in order to master at least a tolerable taste.
Hello! :) There will be no updates tomorrow because I have two exams and I still haven't reviewed yet lmao.
With the confidence Draco suddenly is feeling, he straightened his posture and smiled, “Are you the dom?”
Harry blinked, keeping his eyes on the man. He wanted to ask him questions, wanting and needing an answer but he’s not even sure if Malfoy would want to be at least civil with him. Are they still enemies? Are they still fighting? Is Malfoy still going to sneer at him?
. I get off from it” he smiled, letting his index finger draw shapes on Harry’s thigh, “A challenge, a risk, or maybe even gambling”
Before he could say anything, Luna stared at him, “The blibbering humdingers’ pestering you again, are they?”
"It's an amazing book. You can find five copies inside the library. And then, there's also the recreation room at the end of hall"
“It’ll be fun!” Draco tried to beg, standing on his tip toes and gave Harry a kiss on the column of his throat, “Please? We’ll just be there for an hour then we can go to my place?”
She jumped on her feet when she heard the floo activating and Harry arrived. Quickly composing herself, she walked out of her room to greet him.
He smirked behind his glass as he found the perfect one. Dressed in a handsome suit, looking wealthy and handsome. Luckily, the man was walking towards the bar counter and when their eyes met, he gave out a flirty smile.
“Jerk face!” he called and the two turned their heads at the noise, “ Not you, you snivelling creep. I’m talking to my husband. Anyway, I got the evidence before you got here. Ha! I won” he waved the laptop on the air.
They stepped inside, exploring the common room and the stairs that leads to the lavatory and bedrooms. The place was wide and spacious, it gave Harry a homey feeling. Something warm and exudes comfort.
“’Mione said you’re having troubles with your rut. What happened?” Ron raised an eyebrow, “You never talk about your ‘insatiable’ rut to anyone, Harry. This must be some serious problem” he added and did a dramatic quotation over the word insatiable.
“Fuck, look at you” Remus cursed, his eyes flashing. Something hot and soft flashed within those lingering gazes, almost as if it choke him in the same way his hand currently is.
Harry looked up and fixed the white cloth covering Dracy’s body before turning to where their bundle of joy is. Andy was cutting the umbilical cord and was cleaning their little beanie with the assistance of someone before wrapping the baby in a clean white cloth.
If only, Harry can just give in and stop pretending he’s not liking what Draco is doing to him. He's just pretending, right? He has to be.
“Shit, yes, yes. Daddy!” he mewled loudly as Harry scissored his fingers, stretching him good like he’d promised before the third finger found its way in. The pain increased and he threw his head back.
“Did Harry arrive?” he asked, praying that he did but Dobby shook his head, hesitating and slightly scared for his reaction.
” he swore as Harry pressed his front into his back, his cock pocking through his jeans to his ass. He can feel it. Draco can feel it.
Ah. He’s just going crazy. Maybe Harry spike his drink or did something to him while he was asleep. He took a deep breath and stepped out of the shower to get dressed, fingers moving on its own accord and touching his lips.
Harry made himself some coffee before sitting down at the dining chair. Draco must still be sleeping.
Harry shrugged, “It can but it’s also because I found out narcissus symbolizes inspiration, inner reflection and awareness—  which I am currently working on by the way”
There were no rumors upon their visit to St. Mungos, even from the people that saw them so she was grateful for that. Even if she’s sure that Harry will really take care of her, she wouldn’t like to be at front of gossip again. Especially when it’s just to talk bad about her and would speculate things.
Because now that he realized, Draco can very much use magic if he can't reach a cup. This has to stop. Harry's cock is reacting at the sight that managed to caught his eyes and how gorgeous Draco might be, this is fucking wrong. Wrong at House of Potter at least.
He felt it and if the goosebumps that rouse at the back of his neck was any indication, Harry was pissed.
He cried. Unconsciously, he leaned his weight to his captor’s body, hands fisting his fitted shirt, trembling when he was close to stare at the threatening gun that can kill him in any second if his captor plans to waste a bullet on him.
He threw his robe somewhere inside the room and took out his wand. He conjured a chair and made sure it’s close to the desk. He pushed Harry to sit on it, eyes looking at him with surprise.
Harry inserted a finger inside her pussy and began to fuck her with it. Dracy’s thighs tremble and threatened to close but he held it back easily.
“Blimey, you’ve grown! So, all alone? Where’s the lovebirds?” Seamus grinned, looking around the Great Hall as it settled down after the sorting and Headmistress McGonagall’s welcome speech.
“Daddy is going to stretch you good, open you with my fingers, nudge your hole until you’re softly moaning and writhing, clenching around me”
“Mr. Potter” he spoke, almost stuttering, “I believe I have some business to attend to. Excuse me” he left before Dracy can even say anything. She rolled her eyes. She hates wizards who has no bones to offer, no spine to brave. Weak.
But with the state he is in, could she afford to be angry? Especially when she knows how hard life is with them? With their name? She experienced what her father have experienced. The only difference was she have Harry beside her, who did his father have? The woman he left with?
“Sir Potter, how surprising to see you visit” she spoke kind and not judging. Somehow, it made Dracy feel a bit better.
“Your much more sexual and non-sexual obligations with me are needed when I need them and not when you want them.”
He gripped his cup and continued to scowl. He hates this man. He hates this man. He fucking hate him!
She watched Harry lifted himself off of the wall and began to approach her. He stopped inches away from her and eyed her from head to toe. It bothered her for a bit. She’s well aware how ugly she looks on the clothes she’s wearing but it was what she could only afford. Her wealth was seized and her own vault was taken by her father. How many galleons she have stashed on her purse? Five. She only has five galleons and it’s not enough to buy decent clothes that will fit her.
But even so, there’s memories to hold onto. And like Harry’s words, things are well. They are and he believes that so.
Harry felt as if the walls were crumbling. Everything. Everything kept ringing in his ears as he questioned every little wave inside his chest to the way something rumbled loudly in the back of his mind.
Harry looked at it and sighed heavily. Scratch it. The party is not going to be a disaster because the whole night is a disaster already.
“Poor thing” he shook his head and bent down until their faces are hovering to one another. Harry’s fingers wound up at the back of her head, gripping her blonde hair but not too hurt but just to touch, feeling the silky strands between his fingertips.
Draco paused for a minute and stared at his outstretched hand. His ears refused to believe he heard it right but the longer he doesn’t say anything, the more it feels true. Harry was waiting for his answer so before he could even decline, he accepted the hand.
Things are going smooth, yes. His classmates have been friendly to each other. He also observed the way Hannah, Susan and Parvati is slowly warming up to Parkinson and vice-versa. But Malfoy still distances himself well enough, only speaking to Parkinson.
His tongue playing with his nipple while his fingers played with the other. He touched Draco like he had not touched any other person and Draco was fucked in a way he wasn’t fucked before.
He leaned on him, head resting on his shoulder as he takes in the silence around them. His fingers softly grazed along the petals of the flower and letting his weight on Harry’s strong musculature.
However, with Draco’s attitude, he’s always been on the wild side. From the fraternity he used to be in to the way he visits the bar frequently like how he visits the mall. His brand of alcohol weighs in something with value of seven percent alcohol and higher.
“How’s my girl feeling?” he tucked a hair behind her ear as he stood inches away from her. He was looking down at her with a soft smile on his face.
Draco smiled. He’d forgiven Harry already. Hearing his statement, he realized he may have acted like a brat too. Demanding and pushing while forgetting to see it in Harry’s shoes but now he do.
He brushed the hair out of her face before massaging her scalp. Dracy sighed gratefully, leaning her weight more and her brain short circuiting at the way Harry’s fingers nicely massaged her.
Unlike before, he didn’t shy away from the subject. He knew this topic of conversation would come out sooner or later and he had to be ready. Especially when it’s their family that they are building together.
“Hangover potion. Take it. Bathroom is that obviously. Feel free to wash up, I’ll just go cook us our breakfast” Harry stated and Draco was quick to stand up.
He had heard the news of the mysterious disappearance of Dracy Malfoy. It was all over the The Daily Prophet and is present in every gossip he happened to pass by. The news traveled fast that she was missing. He doesn’t need to worry a little bit.
He didn’t turn his head to look when he heard the sound of a motorbike. He’s too problematic to mind something else. He needs to get checked at St. Mungos.
Clutching his left cheek to his palms, he raised an eyebrow at Draco, “Doll, your hands feel like metal. That one hurt for real”
Harry clenched his jaw, eyes wandering back to Malfoy who was already glancing at him with an unreadable expression and a slight redness in his cheeks. Harry had to ground himself when he felt the
What scares her the most is the feeling of adoration and fondness that started to appear inside her chest. The way she would feel her heart beat erratically and twice, she realized how she stared up to him with googly eyes while Harry never stares the same.
When the agonizing meeting came to an end and Cockybee and pretty little star here left, Harry let out the biggest sigh of all and turned into Draco who was casually writing something in his little notebook.
Harry pulled him to his body, letting Draco gripped his shirt to steady himself, chin tilted upwards to look at him. Taking in every little expression in his face as he grew breathless as the seconds go by.
“So pretty, doll. Laid out for me like this. Fuck, I can just stuff you up so good. Pleasure you every minute and fuck your mouth”
“Love you daddy” he murmured, still peppering his daddy with his kisses, pulling on his bottom lip now and there to tease.
But I hope you could still wait for me to come back and continue this. I would like to try to write and post but I'm afraid I will not be able to think nicely if I force myself to  :(
"Mr. Potter, we need you to guard our son" Mr. Malfoy repeated his statement his tone unwavering as he look at him straight in the eye but Harry didn't falter and stared right back.
So he let it out but when it got too weird especially when Harry did not answer to any of his calls, he began to worry.
“I’m sorry if I’m insensitive. I just d-didn’t know h-how to. . .” he trailed off, not knowing how to finish his statement.
Harry laughed, acting too naturally, “You could say that but I’m not really one to label our honeymoon as done. Every day is just as lovely as our wedding night”
He has to hold himself back. He imagined it was Harry’s cock he’s sucking on as he pulled it back, sticking his tongue out and slid his tongue all over the shaft. His other hand pushing the lace panties aside and teasing his own hard cock.
They flinched in surprise and perked up, several others cussing and choking on their boring morning coffee. Harry had felt sympathy for them. Some of them are still single and he just hopes they all find someone like he had found his. Hmm. Yes, he’s bragging.
Harry looked at her and shrugged in cluelessness. Not sure whether the question was directed with his eight year in general or something more specific. Maybe she knows what his intentions are.
He didn’t see her in any part of the house when she arrived and even Wily didn’t know where she went. He went to the library and in any part of the house where she could possibly be in but she was nowhere.
She moaned and sobbed as she came apart completely. Her juices gushing out of her hole and clenching around him tight. Her body grew limp as she breathed heavily, racing with oxygen.
Especially when he realized the way Luna stares at her girlfriend was the way he found himself staring at Draco. And her statement was nothing but an absolute eye-opener. The message in her gaze and the smile on her lips was enough to cower him into a cheesy fool.
“Maybe you were right” he paused and his smile widened, “Why don’t I take you out for lunch? Maybe to some nice Italian?”
“Sir, please, fuck” Draco begged when he felt a finger swiped the slit of his cock, wiping away the precum that pooled there and letting it slid down to the base down to his balls.
“Harry” she preened, her breath catching on her lungs as she pushed her chest to his hands. Desperation washed over her at the smell of her arousal. She knew Andy will be smelling if she is to step inside her office.
It was nothing like the past. The lightness in their expressions and the joyful excitement etched on their faces have them bubbling with complete interest. Wanting to enjoy every bit of Hogwarts fun before they face the real world.
Draco did not contradict but he tried to fight. He fought those words that drew him in, the statements that are as lethal as rose’s horns but as innocent as daisies in the field. He tried to escape when he felt his heart beating, flying like how a firebolt does. He looked away when he stared not with the fiery attitude when they’re in the field but with the blissful promise to take him apart, not for everyone to see but for him to celebrate on.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him before propping himself on the desk, “That’s the worst confession I have encountered in my life”
The sight was hot. Harry is undeniably hot and sensual. She bit her lips, trying to hold back the arousal that’s beginning to be in her system.
He sighed as he felt fingers drawing circles on his waist, dipping heavier to feel more of his skin. It feels good like always whenever they cuddle. The warmth, his body heat and the steely gentleness that prickle him deep to the bone.
Making sure all confidential files are locked in his drawer with a strong protection charms, he apparated to his house.
Draco’s mouth is a slip away from apologizing, one step away from blurting things out but fought not to risk what they have lest Harry doesn’t like the words he’ll hear. But before he could even do anything drastic, he spoke,
Draco felt his eyes flattering close at the sound of Harry’s restrained voice, hips bucking uselessly as he grunted and groaned.
He let out a throaty chuckle and darkened his gaze. He reveled in the slight hesitance that ceases her movements until she ticked her jaw and proceeded with her plans.
“Me? Fell under your heart? What do you say about that article, Potter?!” he crossed his arms as he leaned on the edge of the desk.
Currently, it’s a busy work near midnight. Customers coming in and out, drinking beer, eating chips and playing pool. Draco’s lithe frame sitting by the counter and taking money and giving change. There were some truck drivers who orders what definitely off the night menu, a coffee. Some were known regulars watching sports on the television and some were new faces just trying out and coming in for fun.
Ron observed him for a moment. From Harry's eyes, the clenching of his jaw, and the way he was massaging his temple, "There's not even a week but you look so stressed already"
He quickly went to the living room, his walk wobbly. He saw Harry there, brushing some dust on his robes and he looked pissed and exhausted.
He went to the dining and raised an eyebrow when he surprisingly found Draco already in the dining wearing an indecent silk robe and standing on his toes reaching for something in the the upper cupboard. His pale thighs into view and the squishy butt Harry unfortunately (or fortunately) dreamt off. Unintentional of course.
They’ve been at the rows of gambling their own bodies, bets of unbridled mysteries, call of the flesh has been tethering for some sort of bargain, a message to drown into throes of passion.
“Come on! That’s some kind of liquid luck. Blow him some kiss, Dray. Or we lose” she threatened and before Draco could stop it, Pansy was shouting to the best of her abilities to catch Harry’s attention.
“It’s not! You have a magic and I don’t? Do you know how fun our pranks would be if I possess the same magic as you?”
Draco’s jaw dropped. Completely out of the blue that threw him off. He sniffed, tears quickly gathering at the corner of his eyes. He fisted Harry’s shirt and buried his face in  the crook of his neck, “I’m happy with you too, Harry”
He encircled his legs tightly on him as Harry walked over to the bed and sat down. Draco smiled as Harry’s serious eyes turned gentler, his lips puckering, “You’ll hate when I have white hairs?”
Pansy was dancing with the girls and he was grateful she managed to adjust to them, letting herself be free to enjoy their last year. Ginny and Luna was in the party too, busy flirting with one another on the other side.
She cried out when Harry stopped his fingers and clicked his tongue. Fuck! She was so fucking close!
Harry is giving him a chance. The man who he expected would be overflowing with the hunger for control is giving him the decision, letting him decide even when they both knew it could easily be ripped away from him.
“Here’s your ring. I’ll just go get our bags in the room. Feel free to check around our apartment” Harry handed him a simple gold band and disappeared in the corner.
Harry growled and held his hard cock and slowly entered her, his tongue licking at her sharp collarbone.
“Flirt while your boyfriend was just behind you?” his palm grazed through the inside of his thigh that has Draco arching his back, eyes fluttering close.
They say never to do it obviously, not to overdo it, never drive up the hill in one go, never uncover instantly and most of all, never ever be too careless.
“No” Draco cut him off then met his eyes, “I will not listen to you. I don’t need your excuses. If you didn’t like what happened then suck it the fuck up!” Draco glared at him one more time before walking away to go to his bedroom.
Harry did. Tried to that is. His mind was racing with Draco, pearl dust, and something gnawing inside him. Tethering to get past what seemed like rational. Why would he think this way if it wasn’t for the potency of the potion with pearl dust in it?
“Oki! Oki! Oki!” the three sang in unison before making their way to wash up and Leo sitting down to continue his book. Their little book lover.
“M-moony” Sirius stammered, his gaze unfaltering. A smirk wanted to get past his lips but he isn’t going to break any rules tonight.
Harry leaned on his chair and scoffed. Not to Hermione herself but more like for what she said. Home. How could he give someone a home when he doesn’t even have one? He can be good for Dracy but he surely cannot be the best.
Harry was confused by the sound that he heard and he stilled. When did pillows start to talk? He doesn’t remember spelling his pillow to create a sound. Why did his pillow created a noise then?
He’d really fucked up. He knows things have changed and he had officially stepped out of bounds. The bounds that carefully kept the name Potter on its nobility.
Draco bit his lips, nearly bowing his head low but the man gripped his chin tighter, clicking his tongue in warning.
Evidence. It’s just what they need so Kingsley could take actions and if they get enough evidence now, the job’s done and he’ll be divorcing Harry immediately.
Draco watched him suck his own cum off his fingers, rolling his hips in the process and whimpering as Harry sucked hard.
What he initially thought would be the end of their beautiful story became a gateway for much more sinful things ever witness in the Malfoy household.
Listen? Is Harry serious? Listen? Really? Did this huge chuck of a wall expect him to listen just because he said so?
Harry smiled and intertwined their fingers together, “Had a small talk with McGonagall” he answered, pecking a kiss on his forehead.
Draco pulled his fingers out and smiled. He leaned down and pecked Harry on the lips, his arms hugging him by the nape.
Perhaps he could let his staffs handle for today. Especially when Harry’s gang have arrived and he haven’t ask how long they’ll be here until their next trip.
Why is Tom interrogating him?! He chuckled to hide the creeping anxiousness at the back of his head and shrugged, hoping the action is as nonchalant as he aspired it to be.
Which did everything to stir up his insides. As fucking usual. Shaking his head one more time, he approached him.
He was left staring down at the floor, his feet dirty as he trembled. Vaguely aware if it’s from cold or from fear or maybe, both.
“Everything I am going to do with you is far from platonic, sweet” Harry turned around before walking over to his desk, swiping all of the things away from it and settling Draco on to the desk, “Scream if you need to, doll. Yell my name as I make you cum again and again”
Deciding to go check the restroom, Harry stood up and walked towards it only to find the room empty. He scowled and rechecked and rechecked just in case Draco decided it was the right time to play hide and seek.
“I don’t” Harry whispered. He stepped closer, easily crowding Draco to the wall, “I don’t regret it, little boy”
But he doesn’t have to do that. For he doesn’t need to dirt his hands today. There are  more important matters to deal with.
are currently working on. It’s not only Harry who keeps on wondering and it’s taking every ounce of his strength not storm in McGonagall’s office to demand some answers himself.
He sighed and nodded at the people trying to talk to him. Excusing himself to continue to interact with the Minister.
Harry gave him a kiss on the corner of his lips, “Don’t think I don’t notice how you want me to take you hard”
Draco hummed gratefully and rested his chin atop Harry’s chest to look at him, “So, by any chance, I can acquire your services exclusively?”
When they were finally gone, Harry pulled her to the kitchen and immediately got on to make her something to eat, “Would you like some cookies and pumpkin juice?” the man asked while beginning to prepare the ingredients on the kitchen counter.
The person looking back at her had a color on her cheeks, something that she knows never disappeared since Harry had shown her little affections. Her eyes that were once too confined within its own looked to be slightly blooming. There was joyful purity that reflected within her silvery eyes.
The whole room full of moans, his noises, and whimpers. His lips parted as he arched his back. His chest heaved when he felt the third finger finding its way in, stretching them to open him up as Harry had promised, “Shit, yes, yes,
“One day, karma will knock you off. You’re awfully enjoying this, Barnes” he frowned. The only thing he can do at the moment.
His breathing slowed down and fastened as his arms gave up from where they are holding on and slumped down onto the desk, his eyes rolling back as he grind his hips up.
Draco is messing with him. Harry knows it and if Draco thinks he is to be played that easily, then he had underestimated him. He came from House of Potter where people shouldn't be diminished easily.
"Parties end at six in the evening if it's held here" Harry repeated, tone stricter this time. Draco had no choice but to agree. If he plans to seduce the man, he at least have to prove he's a good boy.
He fisted Harry’s shirt, kissing him on his covered chest and when he heard Harry groaned in appreciation, Draco purred like a kitten. How can such an exchange of intimacy co-exist in the filth they’re doing out in public right now?
Harry smiled at the look on her face before kissing her in the forehead, “We’ll take it. Do you want to go somewhere else?”
She must’ve have dozed off because when she opened her eyes, she heard the doorbell ringing. Fear filled her gut immediately. Who could that be? If it was Hermione, she’s sure she would’ve used the floo and if it was Ron, he would be with Harry. She called for Wily who immediately appeared with a smoke.
She mewled unexpectedly when Harry flick his tongue out and lick a wet striped over the side of her neck, “Hmm?”
Not having the strength to stop himself, he pulled her to him and sniffed on her neck. Dracy tensed at his action and blushed even more. What bewildered her the most was when she realized she isn’t disgusted but blushing. Blushing. She’s blushing.
Harry rolled his eyes and stopped for a moment. Sirius can really be so chatty and talkative. He chuckled. It may be the reason Remus fell for him and that genes too perhaps. He eyed the letter which was written on something like a parchment rather than just on a piece of paper.
She arched her back, pushing her ass more. She leaned her head above his shoulders, her moans muffled by the way he was choking her. Her mouth parted as she started to reach euphoria. All of her throbbing and trembling as she closed her eyes and let Harry took all the control left.
She giggled as she flattened the imaginary circles of the shirt she snatched from Harry’s hamper. The shirt is not at all dirty, she just had the sudden need to wear something that smells strongly like the man, the father of their little beanie and it’s doing things to relax her.
He stood up on his feet unsteadily. Meals felt lonely without those intense emerald eyes in front of him. Eyeing him when moves suspiciously.
Seeing the slight surprise blooming over Hermione’s eyes was quite satisfying. She turned her eyes to his desk and bit her lips uncomfortably.
This is a kind of Harry far from the Head Auror that he is. The kind of Harry only Draco can uncover. The kind of Harry no one knows even himself. The kind of Harry, he thinks he really wants to be because Draco is nothing but a boy who should be with him.
His hands slipped down from his cheeks when he had the sudden throb in his chest. It wasn’t anything painful or heavy, it was just there beating erratically.
But in moments like this where he gets to watch Harry do the things he’s passionate about, he swoons and falls harder even more. If only there’s a switch to enlist the desire to ravage rather than make love, he would gladly subscribe to it.
He whimpered feeling the stretch of his mouth as his other hand dipped into his skirt, pulling them up and showing Harry a full view of his lace panties, loving the mewl and strings of hot curses in Harry’s lips. He know he’s very hard now, streaks of precum oozing out of that wonderful slit.
But there are times she think there’s still chance. The way Harry held her and kissed her when he arrives, she would be blushing and stuttering like a lovesick fool. When the owner of the bar she used to work in told her she’s been sold to someone, she dreaded the person who did it. She didn’t stop thinking how her already nightmare-like life have been turned much worse.
It came out as a surprise when it was Harry who asked the need to do a little shopping spree for their little beanie and promised to take care of her if the public would be too much for her.
Harry is really interesting. Draco gives his father credit for that. Someone that's worth drooling for and seducing. He chuckled at the idea of seduction.
He would not deny the people of the truth of their phrases. Even he knew why they are speaking that way. Everyone knows he’s ( and something people deny to admit—was) a death eater, the evidence is in his arms forever. The memories aren’t just only inside his mind but also swirling in theirs.
He was aware his disappearance might lead to skeptical thoughts on the young boy’s side. He didn’t even owl him or flooed to tell him where he is. He just left.
If he calls her now, he’s not looking like he’s gonna rush her, is she? He started from those little affections to build his way up or maybe down. He didn’t want to end up like people who had tried to rush her and forced to hike the skirt up in one meeting.
Draco turned around again and this time, Harry made sure he was quick enough to look back up but Draco is smirking again. He is smirking as if he knows something Harry don't.
Harry began to lead the drive, the others following them behind. Turning his head one last time at the place he never once left, he teared with a good feeling.
Draco moaned, his fingers grasping at the sheets when he began to feel himself harden just by look of intensity in Harry’s eyes. They were gleaming and wonderfully apparent. So sexy. It’s amazing how Harry can easily turn Draco on.
He took a deep breath as the classes finished, his steps falling back as he noticed the way Draco slacked behind.
He reveled the way Draco’s jaw dropped before he rolled his eyes and shivered as if disgusted, “That’s so gross, Mr. Potter!”
But he realized, he doesn’t need to. He can be who he is without changing anything. Because if people have a problem with it, it’s their issue. He took what courage he have in his room and walked up to his parents, wanting to be bared by himself before others do it for him.
They turned a corner Harry had not bothered himself to inspect, "This is where the ballroom, music room, and play room is. The play room is something that used to be mine when I was a little"
He wanted to revert back to his old ways. Nag the man, argue with him, call him names and criticize everything he does but how could he be so childish and immature when he can see how much Potter have grown?
He cannot seem to have enough. He wanted more but didn’t dare to act on it now. Feeling Dracy’s face buried in his neck, her lips faintly touching at his skin and the feel of the small body in his is making his Alpha try to find its way out more.
If anything, Sirius can say he’s even more capable to fight a man than the Minister Cornelius Fudge. That man depends on his wand while James, his beloved bestfriend, is nothing but of excellence.
He chuckled silently and bent his head down to peck him on his forehead and cheeks. Draco, awakened by the action, groaned and tried to pucker his lips.
Surely, nothing’s wrong? Harry would always pop up but his absence is ticking concern inside him. Could it be that they left? But Harry always bid his goodbye and makes sure to make him feel good before he disappears.
Draco’s ear began to hear this bland static noise as his orgasm took him by surprise, spurting his own cum in Harry’s hands as his movement fastened up to chase his own orgasm, groaning at the sight of Draco’s post-orgasmic look.
“I wouldn’t want to strip you of your attitude when I could use all of it in the bedroom” he leaned close to her ear, “
Harry bent down to reach Draco’s nipples and took one on his mouth while he played the other on his fingertips. Rolling the nub between his fingers and pulling at it. Draco pants and arched his back.
and all. Something he haven’t experienced ever. Something Harry did so easily. It felt natural, not forced. Seemed good and felt good. It was just one pecked but confusion was ebbing inside him.
“Delicious?” he smiled, wiping a bit of sauce on the corner of his lips before licking it off his fingers and seeing Draco nod in agreement.
What’s the number one of the House of Potter morals? He doesn’t know and he doesn’t care. Fuck morals. His mind is clouded and he cannot brush it away. He’s blinded with the beauty offered to him.
There was hesitance on Draco’s part but he reminded himself they need this to gain information. Harry nodded for the both of them and as Tom ushered them inside, he was fast to look around the office.
She wasn’t even listening. The only thing she knows is that Harry is coming closer. Closer and closer. His steps full of intention and promises and his presence practically yelling in all corners of the venue hall.
All Draco did is to take in what Harry gives him. Noisy and loud but they both didn’t care. Harry loved the noises that came out of those pretty little mouth and Draco was happy with what he is receiving.
Harry had an enormous amount of sweat pants and black shirts, almost half of his closet is filled with those while 1/4 of it is filled with robes and muggle suit and what Draco looked at the longest are the boxers. It looked so soft and so lucky to be able to touch Harry's private parts. After staring at it for a while, he realized something. Harry doesn't wear briefs because there's none and that's sexy. Imagining Harry on his suit or auror robes without a brief is turning him on.
“So pretty. So gorgeous for me” he continued, putting slight pressure. He watched him waved a hand and the next thing Sirius realized, he’s as naked as he was born. His erection pointing upwards, precum sliding down to his length to Remus’ lower abdomen.
Harry nodded understandingly, once as any other minute, in awe of how well-spoken Draco can be. Of how insightful, perceptive, of how deep he can think. Draco is someone who just doesn’t look above the surface but also think deeper, wider, broader, and more open-minded.
He pointed to a guy in a gentleman suit as he walked towards a narrow aisle. A minute or so, they reached a black door with a security standing in front of it.
When they were done ordering, Limo walked away with the promise that their foods will be up in five.
When he was sure he is satisfied of how gorgeous he looks, he went back down to see Harry settled on the couch in the living room, several stacks of folders laid on the table infront of him. His Auror robes open and he was playing with his wand with his fingers. He looks so hot. So hot and it's making Draco's body feel hotter.
He put it back, only to be returned in his own knee a second after. He repeated it until Harry let it rest atop his legs, smiling to his associates.
Draco's eyes turned glassy as he stared over Harry's handsome face. Merlin, that beard looked so hot and he wants to feel it on his skin, the way it would slid down his torso as Harry travels down to taste all of him. He shuddered. He already really can feel it now.
His baby boy’s expression shifted almost instantly. Pupils dilating by the immediate lust that settled on his vision, his hands gripping the edge of his dress tight as his lips parted, breathing through it.
He shrugged. He’s feeling so good that he didn’t give it much thought. Standing up and stretching, he walked over to the bathroom and to have shower. When he was done he stared at his naked body in the mirror and smiled.
He hummed and pulled his head back for a second to rip her panty off. She let out a surprise yelped when Harry dived  instantly, lips closing around her clit as his fingers teased her wetness. His fingers spread across her cunt, playing with her opening, teasing with light touches as his lips nip around her sensitive clit.
He sighed before deciding to look at the beauty Luna have mentioned few times by now. It rings in his mind like a fixed tune, like a muscle memory.
Harry chuckled. Better not to disappoint his boyfriend when he gets this needy. He helped him drink his water before gulping one for his own.
He glared at Harry only to be dismissed as he pointed his index finger. Following the direction, he saw it was Tom who walked out of his bar and began to walk somewhere.
Everyone, who saw him back that day that devastated the whole of Wizarding World but also opened a new tomorrow for those who have fought for the good side, despise him to no end. Who could actually blame them?
There was silence and Draco thought Harry doesn’t have any idea what to say but then, he spoke, “I know you, dove. So, win then get what you want from me”
He’s not here for the psychology for it all. He’s not here for the logic behind. He’s not here for anything educational. He’s fucking here for the money, for the excitement, he’s here because he fucking can and has the talent to make up for his stripper name.
Okay. None of those words are appropriate. Draco shook his head as he grabbed his heels, “I’ll see you at the office”
Harry smiled at him as he tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. Not bothering to think a lot of his actions like Draco does, “Let’s go”
When Draco felt the hard cock settling themselves on the crack of his butt and he tried to grind into it, “Need you, want you. Please fill me up, Harry”
“Leave the Earth, Pottery barnes. Fuck your life” he stated for added measure. Gosh, he infuriates him!
He untangled himself and pulled away causing Draco to whine needily, hands itching to reach out to his cock and getting himself off.
He is currently inside an empty room that has nothing but the chair he’s strapped on, a table on the side and a light above him.
As soon as they were done eating, Harry had Wily clean the table as he grabbed a chocolate for his pregnant girl for dessert.
“I don’t know, alright? I don’t know if it’s the potion, pearl dust, or anything but I like this. This… this feeling. It’s comforting and blissful. I know it’s strange and shocking but things are good, right? You feel it too?”
Harry looked at the shops in Diagon Alley. Looking for that specific flower shop owned by the Patil Twins. When he spotted it, he saw Parvati Patil by the window, arranging some flowers.
He wasn’t listening, letting his mind fly outside the classroom but his attention shifted when he thought he heard another shocking thing.
Harry ignored his own hard cock, wanting nothing but taste Draco into his mouth. He bent down and lick Draco’s perineum, teasing it with feathery touches of his tongue. Draco shivered and moaned.
"Curfew? Seriously?" she taunted and Draco shrugged easily, "It's actually good because then I will be locked up inside with him"
Because Draco has never been the one to play by to what’s normal. He goes for adventures, riddle-like chaos. He goes out of his way to step in a line he always craved years before.
Lucius smiled at her, always fond at the way his wife never fails to comfort him. She never failed to see the reluctance behind his cold steely gaze. How fun would it be if they can cancel today’s appointment so he could just bend her over the bed like she deserves, take her apart piece by piece.
His hand slid up and own along his thighs, feeling the tender skin, slowly turning him on, feeling how Draco’s breathing slowly increasing as he left him marks for him to admire tomorrow.
He was about to try to mutter a word, just one to indicate he’s listening but stopped when he felt something being shoved to his hand. It was a yellow string with silver, pink and purple beads. Just random combination of colors that looked (he doesn’t want to judge that much)
Harry smiled at the sight. His little boy looks so sexy, young, and so fucking hot. His pale skin going with the white shirt and it glowed more at the moonlight peeking in at the open window of his home office.
Dracy smiled at her. She was able to warmed up with her, one of the not too many people who’s able to show kindness even when she obviously know what happened to her family and kept her word that no one will know of her pregnancy. Though  pretty sure from their trips to Diagon Alley, people already know about her condition.
Dracy was loosing her grip. All of her energy is being spent on the way she was trying to control herself from cumming. She wanted to be so good, so good for Harry. She gripped on the sheets tight, pulling on it as his cock hit all the right places.
He was rather handsome on the mornings and Draco would never admit it out loud but he’s ready to hump him on there. That sweats he wore that hung low on his hips, allowing him a peak of a little bit of his butt. Yeah, this motherfucker is as bold as Microsoft word function. And he was drooling like a toddler.
Harry shrugged and took a seat on the guest chair since Ron already took his Head Auror chair, “Nothing. Anyway, you look good in that Head Auror chair”
The day passed by into a blur. As usual, Harry’s work hours consisted of towers of papers being signed or trashed, countless visits from people of other Ministry departments, some to say something important and some to just blabber whatever nonsense they can invent.
An image he knew he’ll never get tired off. An image he’s easily growing fond off. It wasn’t just about his looks, it was about being himself.
He cannot remember what happened vividly but he’s sure of one thing. The asshole that did this ruined his fucking date with the man he hates. The kisses he’s possible to get!
The feel of her pliant body above him, humping on its own accord and the hot breath he can feel in his neck, he would stake anything to see her naked on the bed, eyes rolling at the back of her head, back arching, and legs quivering.
He’s a man. A man. He had a fair tan which did nothing to deter how he holds himself up. Even from a few feet away, Draco feels him. His presence, everything. He gulped, hands fisting the sides of his silk robe.
Those delicate and elegant fingers as he plays the piano, the music is superb. Harry admired him at first sight, dazzling images of the young boy naked entered his mind, of all things, he always dreamt of magnificently ravish him in the dining table, bed, bathroom, gazebo, ballroom, living room, and even in their pantry. Everywhere they can fit, he thought of it.
“Patience, my love. We gotta take this slow at first” harry whispered, “Then I’m going to stretch you good then fuck you out here in the open. I’ll be as rough as you want me to, as long as you want me to”
He smiled and sighed blissfully. There was a flutter inside him seeing Draco use his things. Wanting nothing but to bundle the pretty little one in his arms, craving for more than just a simple kiss in the forehead.
yes d-daddy” Draco whimpered, biting his lips harshly as he began to lose himself with how fast Harry is fucking him with those excellent fingers.
When he turned his head back, he gasped when their eyes met. The emerald shade he can see even from the distance. That height and those muscles. He’s nothing weak. He looked so strong, so powerful for a muggle. That messy long hair bundled in that messy bun, eyeglasses that did nothing to cover that magnificence of those gazes, hard muscles that are bared with the white sleeveless shirt and the tight pants he was wearing.
And Draco is your princess dairy cream. Bratty. Does nothing but roll his eyes because just the knowledge that Harry is breathing surge annoyance deep within. He can feel that pang of desire to kick the man in the face, bruise him into oblivion and maybe, maybe if he had the chance throw him into the unknown and never let him get back.
He sighed and tried to hold onto the doorframe as he continued to peek outside. His eyes not even leaving Harry's magnificence when he stopped and wiped as he wiped the sweat on his forehead. The serious look on his face leveled the seriousness of his beard. Draco doesn't even want to blink. He wants to stare at him for every second that he can until the image is stuck in his mind.
They’re outside after classes. Enjoying the day out before Christmas comes and the snow to start replacing the warm weather. It’ll be winter soon and the whole Hogwarts will be cold. But he didn’t mind, exactly thinking how he’ll get to cuddle with Draco for as long as he wants before the holidays.
“I wasn’t supposed to be here” he gazed at his nails, perfectly portraying the laid back man to cool of his anger even if it did not abate even the slightest bit.
“Fuck, baby” Harry pulled his mouth back when her palm landed on his hard cock, throbbing from its confines and desperate like her pussy was.
Ginny who slept here with her girlfriend rushed to hug Harry. Luna smiled at them before turning to Draco, “Merry Christmas, Draco”
“You’re mine, Draco” he whispered possessively, “Fucking hell. You’re so fucking tight, so beautiful. Tell me who owns you”
