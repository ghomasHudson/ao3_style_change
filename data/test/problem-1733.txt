‘It’s ok. You couldn’t have known things would happen the way they did.’ He knew Harry was right, but it didn’t mean it was easy. ‘How do you feel?’ His green eyes were boring into Draco’s with a mix of sympathy and unconcealable hopefulness and Draco’s stomach twisted uncomfortably. He had a sudden brainwave and scrabbled to pull the sleeve of his shirt back to see if his dark mark was still there and his heart plummeted when it was. Except, whilst the mark was as black and nasty, there were no longer any horrible veins underneath it.
“Pans,” he leant forward and rested his elbows on the desk, something his father would have hexed him for, “you realise anything we tell you puts you at risk?”
‘No, no. You’re right. It was a stupid idea, between your fame and my hospital stints, and my mark coming back, surely they wouldn’t- I can’t even do magic.’
“No, you’re not. There’s dittany in the bathroom, go and clean yourself up. I’ll deal with Aspen.” She hesitated, her gaze flicking to the fox still dangling in the air.
. He looked up at him and he saw the worry etched across his features as he continued to say the words Draco couldn’t understand.
The menu was whisked out of his hands and the waiter disappeared. Draco was concentrating too hard on his breathing to notice and jumped when Harry took both of his hands in his.
‘DRACO? WHAT’S GOING ON?’ Harry shouted through the door. He couldn’t reply, even if he wasn’t tongue tied, he wouldn’t know what to say. It had to be one of the times Harry forgot he was a wizard and didn’t open the door by force. He didn’t want Harry to see anyway, to see his lack of control. He’d think he was dangerous, probably, and maybe he was. This was uncharted territory for everyone involved after all.
Getting the ladder into the house and up the stairs was trouble enough, so once he’d made it up the last step, he went to take a dose of Vitamix to restore his energy. The warmth that spread through his system as the potion took effect nearly made him giggle, but he checked himself.
“You understand the charges?” The girl asked him with a squeaky voice. In all honesty it didn't much matter to Draco what the charges were.
‘Pansy!’ He said, raising his eyebrows, ‘what on earth are you doing here? More to the point, how did you get in? This is off limits to the general public.’ Pansy rolled her eyes and kissed him on both cheeks. He hoped that was witch’s lipstick and he wouldn’t have bright red-stained lip marks on his cheeks.
‘She’s the best in the hospital you know. Pots requested her specifically because she wouldn’t discriminate. With your mark coming back…we were worried it was all going to kick off again.’ Pansy’s voice had dropped to a whisper and Draco felt uneasy at the implications of what having the mark burned onto his arm again might be.
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” Pansy grinned at Granger in a maniacal way that had Granger looking at Draco with a worried expression.
‘We don’t need to go now, do we? I know you can apparate across oceans Mr The-Rules-Don’t-Apply-To-Me, but there’s no way I can side-along with you. I can get Spungen to arrange us a portkey. He’s got the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France in his back pocket, he’s so old.’
‘Draco-’ He could see Harry turn towards him in his peripheral vision, but he didn’t dare look. He couldn’t handle Harry’s sympathy face, it would kill him slowly from the inside.
‘WE ARE NOT FAMILY! WE GOT DIVORCED.’ Draco looked down at the ring Harry had given him not 24 hours ago. Yes, they did get divorced, but as far as he was concerned that didn’t matter anymore. They loved each other…didn’t they?
She let him drink a full glass of water before she tried to speak to him again. Draco had time to observe that although she was well put together wearing tailored robes trimmed with the brilliant red colour of the firm, her hair was even more frizzy than usual, and her cheeks were flushed.
‘Well, since this issue with your magic hasn’t been resolved, Pansy has stepped in and started the classes I offered you. Please don’t be offended, you’re more than welcome to take over whenever you’re feeling up to it. Anyway, it’s actually about Ella.’ Draco wasn’t surprised that things had moved on without him and to be honest, he wasn’t sure he was the best choice for those classes anyway. He was surprised that Pansy was running them, however. That seemed far too benevolent for her.
‘Don’t work yourself into the ground. You’re not getting paid to reorganise everything that went before you. Plus, you look a mess. Come here.’ He sat her down on a chair she’d uncovered and started unravelling the rest of her hair.
‘He got over it when I promised him I was skipping the session to do his stupid homework.’ Harry said nothing, although he looked like he wanted to ask Draco a hundred questions. He didn’t think it was obvious from the outside, but on this inside his stomach was knotted till kingdom come. Harry seemed to all intents and purposes to have shut down his emotion completely – at least he would have if he didn’t have the kind of eyes that blazed with his inner thoughts like giant mood beacons. He was scared, Draco could tell that much.
‘Oh, really? And I suppose you don’t count going to Gringotts and messing with my finances as lying then?’ He didn’t want to get angry again, he really didn’t, but Harry could be so full of shit sometimes.
“Don’t get any ideas,” he said absently, “it’s not a pet name. It’s the codename we gave Sirius during the war. I didn’t think to keep it up with Remus, but he could be anywhere now and maybe it’s not so safe there. Or maybe he just wanted to keep that distance.” He drank more of his tea, the sugar helping to steady his wooziness, and wondered what he should do next. It was always Hermione who came up with the plans that actually worked – well, worked better than his would have anyway. Not that any plan they’d ever made ever worked out the way they’d wanted it to.
She slammed her teacup down and he heard the clink of a hairline crack forming in the china. Luckily it wasn’t the antique set.
‘Haha, very funny. Shouldn’t I be asking you that?’ Teddy pouted adorably and Draco pulled him into a hug. ‘Are you feeling better?’
‘I was joking, Harry. It’s fine.’ He pulled himself up off the floor, dusting off as much flour as he could. He walked away from Harry and returned to his pancake mix so that Harry wouldn’t see the look on his face.
‘Wow.’ Harry stopped in his tracks to look at the structure, although Draco knew the outside wasn’t a patch on the inside. It was a pavilion of sorts – a cross between a greenhouse and an outhouse. It was a later addition to the grounds, perhaps nineteenth
‘Harry?’ Draco rushed over to him and knelt by the side of his chair. Harry held his head in his hands and Draco could see tears falling through the gaps between his fingers. ‘What’s wrong?’ Harry let out a sob and Draco put and arm around his shoulders and pulled him into his chest. It was a horrible angle – Harry leaning sideways and Draco’s knees creaking against the hard floor. It didn’t matter though, Harry needed him.
‘I panicked! I trust Ron. He’s never let me down and I knew he wouldn’t say a thing if I asked him not to. Hermione, well, Hermione’s great with secrets too but she’s so soft on you I thought she might try to tip you off. Shit, this all sounds so manipulative.’ Harry’s tone was getting more and more irate, his breathing uneven, as he tried to explain but couldn’t get his words out.
Luna took Harry’s bundled-up fox and he immediately missed the warmth of holding it close to his chest. He wasn’t the only one. The fox began screaming again, turning its head wildly as Luna carried it away. Harry hoped it was looking for him. He glanced back at Malfoy who clearly wasn’t the slightest bit interested in Harry’s presence. He watched her turn another page, her long fingers hooking under each page and lifting so that she didn’t make a single sound. He wondered if she did that on purpose.
‘I trust you!’ She said sweetly, her cute little dimples flashing when she smiled at him. He felt the familiar squeeze of apparition and he tried not to breathe until it was over. His stomach flipped a full 360 and he held Ella closer as if she would protect him from the feeling. The little girl on the other hand, had no such issues.
. It means always pure. An affectation, something to make them sound fancier than they were. It’s all for show Potter, it always has been.’ Draco was surprised to find Harry laughing.
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?” Harry yelled at the fox. He didn’t even care that Lyra might think he was crazy; she’d already seen more than enough, and he was more convinced by the second that Aspen knew exactly what was going on. Of course, the fox couldn’t answer him, but it did snap its jaws again for emphasis.
‘I see. Well, I’ll speak to my employer and let you know then.’ Draco wanted to get out of the room as quickly as possible. The tension was stifling.
Malfoy clears his throat awkwardly and Harry releases his hold of him. He turns away, embarrassed that Malfoy caught him staring and thinking about the pins and needles sensation he now has in his palm down to his fingertips. Now isn’t the time to get distracted; there are lives at stake.
‘What was that about?’ He asked him cautiously as Harry stood before him, practically shaking with rage.
“Shit!” He hissed, wiping his hand with his napkin and peering with dismay at his reddened hand. The pitfalls of highly sensitive skin.
He cards his fingers through Draco’s messy hair. It always calms him down when Harry does this, although he’s not sure anything he does will be enough this time.
‘Draco, you’re being ridiculous.’ Pansy sighed through the floo. She was used to Draco’s small fits over Harry.
‘You can tell me if you need to leave, Daddy. I know you don’t like lots of people. It’s ok, one of my friends at Hogwarts is claustrophobic and we have to look after him when there’s quidditch – he doesn’t like being in the stands. He gets that funny breathing thing you do. It’s not exactly the same, but close enough, right?’ Draco’s heart swelled with pride.
‘It was Wood you went to see, wasn’t it? And he blackmailed you again, didn’t he?’ Harry looked uncertain.
Luna brought them to a room that was somewhere between a sitting room and a vet’s examination room. It was a large space painted pale green with a metal table in the middle. There were yet more plants lined up along the wide windowsill to Harry’s left, and the walls were covered with anatomical drawings, potions recipes, and complex want movements. There was a saggy old sofa in one corner with one arm ripped to shreds, and a few cushions and dog beds stacked beside it.
‘It’s fine.’ He didn’t want Harry to worry about him for no reason, even though it really did hurt a lot. Draco watched as Harry healed his wound and cast a tergeo on the blood that was already drying. Draco remembered a time when he wouldn’t let Harry anywhere near his left arm for fear he’d remind him about his mark and run off. How the times had changed.
Nevertheless, Draco had long since assumed that all of that had been taken by the Ministry during his trial. He had no idea he had any assets to be frozen at the time. This certainly changed his plans for his move to France.
Harry waited patiently. “You can talk to me, you know. We’re friends, right? I won’t judge you.” Draco sat up and looked at him sharply. His grey eyes glittering, his hair shining so blond it was almost white. He looked ethereal like that, as if the sun that broke through the willow branches was lighting him up like a beacon so that Harry couldn’t look away even if he wanted to. Up this close Harry could see the dusting of freckles across Draco’s cheeks and nose and he desperately wanted to touch them.
He threw away the unopened mail. Anyone important knew where to find him now anyway. Next, he turned his attention to the small pile of
“Would you pass me my bag? It’s on the back of your chair.” Granger released Pansy’s hand to let her retrieve a small beaded bag. It went everywhere with Granger although Draco had never asked her what was in it. She stuck her hand in up to the elbow and Draco realised it was imbued with a sizing charm. Very clever. After a few seconds of rummaging and the occasional crash of things being knocked over, Granger pulled out a thin, shimmering length of fabric that Draco recognised instantly.
‘Morning, Helen. I do hope you’re well.’ He hadn’t been to the orphanage for a week or so, having had a bad turn which drained him more than usual.
The only problem he had was that his loan had been rejected by Gringotts. He would just have to apply for any potions related job, regardless of whether he was overqualified, and hope for the best. After all, he could always work his way up the chain like he had here.
Pansy, to his surprise, looked positively thrilled to see him as he arrived outside the chateau. He supposed that was more likely to do with the bitter cold than her enthusiasm over seeing him. He was even more surprised to find she hadn’t come alone.
Draco pulled back first, and Harry sunk further into the bed, feeling boneless and completely relaxed.
‘We should go up to bed, we can’t sleep here.’ Draco hadn’t even thought about what time it was, but he suddenly felt like lead.
“But surely they’re still checking ID? Can we even still perform magic if we’re muggles?” Draco didn’t like this idea much, but Granger didn’t seem perturbed.
Harry left the pub quickly, feeling fettled. Malfoy had the ability to strip Harry’s outer layer off like he was pealing an orange. If Harry had been less flustered, he might have noticed that the crowd of people nearby were not just the regular punters. If he had been less disconcerted by Malfoy’s display of something akin to warmth, he may have noticed the flash of a camera. As it happened, Harry noticed neither of these things. However, unbeknownst to him, Malfoy definitely had, and it would come back to bite them both later.
‘Your guess is as good as mine.’ Ginny refused to pull a cracker with him and was especially cold the entire time. Draco happened to win both the crackers he pulled and got an Irish dancer to the eye when the magical animation got to close to him. Still, he wasn’t so mean as to hoard the hat or the mini sneakoscope he technically won.
‘I should stay with Dad when he gets angry, he- he needs someone around.’ Draco frowned at him. He didn’t like the sound of that. What exactly had he been exposed to in the past few years? Draco had assumed the majority of Harry’s anger had been directed at him…
‘And why do you think it was him you saw before your accident,’ Smith pressed. How the bloody hell was Draco supposed to know that?
Later that evening the two of them were sitting in the dark watching a show Dean had recommended about an American man who kept tigers. Harry was feeling a bit like a giddy teenager because he was snuggled against Draco, his head buried in Draco’s chest, and his arms wrapped tightly around him. Draco rarely let Harry snuggle like this, so Harry took every chance he got. He was just about to doze off when Draco suddenly shifted and said:
Since his delightful stay in the Ministry holding cell, the situation had been explained to him, via Granger, who was actually a great help even if he resented her manner. A witness in the Leaky that day had come forward with a suggestion that Draco might have had something to do with Potter’s disappearance, based on claiming to have seen him slipping out of the side entrance of the Ministry near the estimated day of Potter’s disappearance – 7
Harry is fortunate in that the library is on the ground floor of the Manor, but less fortunate in that it’s at completely the opposite end from the entrance. It’s probably a good thing Malfoy won’t leave him alone with the books because four corridors down and he’s utterly lost. Finally, Malfoy leads him to a large room with only one small window, and walls and cabinets crammed to the ceiling with books. Many of them are old leather-bound prints from a century ago, but in fact many of them seem to have been created long before the invention of the printed word.
He stormed out of the kitchen in a rage and almost completely missed Teddy standing just outside the door, his Lego scattered in pieces on the floor in front of him.
“Oh you’re not a happy bunny, are you?” Luna cooed at the fox like it was a baby. “Harry, you’d better come with, obviously you two are quite attached already.”
He turned over as slowly and carefully as he could possibly do so, not knowing if his bed partner was a heavy or light sleeper. Normally, he’d have gotten straight out of bed, collected his things and gone, without a second look. This was different; he was hurting from saying his goodbyes the day before, and he’d be so alone when he left that he just wanted to soak in this feeling, even if it was fake affection. Nothing could have prepared him for the sight he saw.
‘See. Some things never change.’ Harry joked as Draco looked at him helplessly. The house smelled like roast dinner and cinnamon which was an assault on Draco’s senses but felt like true Christmas. Teddy had already run off to see his cousins and Draco sidled up to Harry for a hug before he joined the madness.
It was difficult for Draco to get to the orphanage since he could no longer apparate. It was located a few miles out of the city and many of the muggle taxi drivers refused to take fayres that far since it was out of their jurisdiction. It had taken a long time to get a floo installation approved and even then, it didn’t always work as it should. Today was one of Draco’s stronger days so he decided to risk the undulations of floo travel.
‘I’m fine, love. It’s just a lot. I’ll be fine in a minute.’ Harry kissed him softly, his worry almost radiating off him.
The view inside was beautiful, even if it didn’t quite match the ornate relief work on the outside. The one aspect that was better from the inside was the effect of the stained-glass windows.
Draco grinned at Teddy’s ability to flit from subject to subject so quickly. He remembered when he tried to write his first letters to his father, all of which he refused to respond to until he thought the style sufficiently succinct. Draco would never be like that with Teddy. He wrote a quick response, assuring Teddy that Hufflepuff was a perfect fit for him and that he was very proud of how well he was settling in. He let Eltanin rest for a while since he knew the new owl didn’t have much experience with such long-distance flights.
‘Look, I know you hate those appointments, but do you have to take it out on me? I’m just concerned.’ Draco looked up from his journal and immediately felt guilty when he saw the lost expression on his face.
Hours later and Draco still hadn’t returned home. It had long since gone dark and with the sun, the limited warmth it provided had also gone. Draco knew he shouldn’t be sat outside, not with his bad circulation, but he couldn’t face going home. He sat on the frosted ground, staring right ahead at the marble in front of him.
‘Ted?’ He questioned. Teddy had been a cuddly baby but from about three onwards he’d only ever really hugged Harry. They’d all come to accept that Teddy wasn’t a particularly affectionate person, and now by eleven he was entering his ‘I’m too cool for hugs’ phase. Teddy just stayed clinging onto Draco and he was forced to wrap his arms around the boy’s skinny frame for fear he would knock him over if he didn’t.
All in all, it was a very pleasant meal. Draco was glad turkey was saved solely for Christmas because he felt like he’d eaten a whole one on his own and that would certainly be enough to tide him over until next year, maybe even the year after. The constant talking and generally high volume around the table was a lot for him to deal with and even with four glasses of wine he shouldn’t really have drank, he was struggling to keep his calm and his energy. Harry, sensing Draco was flagging, excused them both before Molly could start dishing out dessert.
‘You could’ve just told me that instead of playing these stupid games with me.’ Draco said exasperatedly.
‘Woah, Teddy. What’s going on?’ Draco was not equipped to deal with an emotional child, this was always Harry’s thing. Draco prised Teddy’s arms off him and took him through to the living room. Back when Draco had lived with Harry, the kitchen had always been the hub of the house, where all the important conversations happened. Draco had never even seen Andromeda’s kitchen.
“Well I’m telling you now,” he says while still picturing her without her signature frizz. “Now if you’re quite done disrupting my peace and quiet…”
He hadn’t known what it would be like to see her again after their kiss. It made him hot all over to think about it even now. It wasn’t as though he had expected them to talk about it, but it was an elephant in the room. He certainly hadn’t expected her to show up on his doorstep all bright and bubbly like a kid in a sweetshop. He’d obviously seen to that quickly enough anyway.
Only he could’ve managed to sleep through the new year. He woke up feeling sore although he couldn’t think what he’d been doing. He didn’t remember going to bed actually. He glanced at the clock next to him – how had he slept until two in the afternoon? And since when was it the 2
The next time Harry went to Luna’s place the front door was locked. Luna never ever locked her front door, which meant something funny was going on. He knocked politely and when there was no reply, he made his way around the side of the house. It was absolutely bloody freezing; the shift from October to November had been fierce and even in his warmest coat Harry found himself huddling over against the arctic winds. The sky was nearly black with cloud and if he didn’t move fast, he was going to get drenched by the inevitable downpour.
‘Before you say anything. There’s something I need to tell you. There’s no need to panic, it has nothing to do with us.’ Immediately, Draco’s heartrate picked up. Harry should know by now that Draco would always panic, no matter the situation.
Draco had found him. After all this time Potter had been getting on with his life. A guttural sound escaped Draco when he realised that maybe Potter had stayed away on purpose all along… had Weasley gone with him? However, through the fox the noise came out closer to a high-pitched screech than a cry of pain. It made no sense for Draco to be there like this. Had the spell actually worked? Or was Draco so close to the edges of reality that he could no longer tell fact from fiction?
‘Hey, hey, breathe. You have to take it one step at a time.’ Draco huffed, but moved over so that Harry could sit next to him on the sofa. He pulled his blanket over Harry’s legs even though Harry was pretty much never cold. Harry gave him a gentle smile and he told himself to relax.
‘Mister Potter! How good it is to see you properly awake. I’m afraid it might not last long, you’re due Dr Ubbly’s.’ She was a middle-aged mediwitch with a kindly smile that made Draco feel a little better, until his brain caught up with what she was saying.
Teddy came out of his room in just enough time for a high-five goodbye, he’s still too cool for hugs, and Draco showed Hermione out through the front door since he didn’t have the magical ability to lift the wards Harry had set. Not that he would ever admit that in a million years.
“You would tell me, if you knew there was something wrong, wouldn’t you?” He thought about that. It was odd for her to be invested in him, the fragile new intimacy between them seemed like something he should cradle carefully in his hands. He didn’t know that he could tell her anything at all. He might be going slowly mad. But was it better to lie and save face or to tell her the truth?
‘How the hell would you know if I’m trying or not! You’re never fucking here anyway! Yesterday was the first day you actually spent more than an hour with Teddy since he came home! I get it. The kids are important. I know that, I’ve met them, I’ve spent time with them, but why are they more important than us? You have a team of people who look after them when you’re not there. Who the hell does Teddy have? Me. And a fat lot of good I’ve done him! Don’t try to tell me that you had to do paperwork on Boxing Day. Don’t take me for a fool.’ Draco was furious. He could feel the blood flooding his veins like fire.
‘I don’t think that’s the full truth.’ Draco felt like Smith was staring right into his mind and he shifted uncomfortably.
‘Thank you Draco, that was the best Christmas present ever!’ She hugged him tightly, effectively binding his legs together since she was so small. He could do little else put to pat the top of her head awkwardly since he needed at least one arm to keep his balance.
‘What was all that?’ Harry asked him. He loosened his grip on Draco’s waist and Draco’s heart dropped, but he didn’t pull away fully.
“I’m not sure that’s wise,” Remus interjected, “we don’t know where that animal came from. It could be a shapeshifter for all we know. It might lead us into danger.”
That’s how Draco found himself at the Orphanage on Boxing Day. Harry had suggested the three of them spend a quiet day in together – maybe just go for a walk. They lived in the country for a reason after all. Draco was feeling guilty about not having seen Ella though so for once it was his decision to go in. The orphanage was running on a skeleton staff over the Christmas period, and Draco knew full well some of the staff weren’t exactly perfect examples of the Christmas spirit.  Before they left, he borrowed Eltanin so send a quick owl to an old friend to ask a favour – Christmas wasn’t over just yet.
Draco let go of Harry and braced himself as he walked out the back of the house where a large tent had been constructed. Percy Weasley had once told him that it was the tent they’d bought for Bill and Fleur’s wedding which was now used for family events since there was so many of them now. Draco could well imagine that their wedding had been a far cry from his and Harry’s, but from what he’d heard it had been beautiful up until it had been destroyed by Dolohov and his lackies. At least, Draco thought it was Dolohov – it had been so long he hardly remembered.
“Please be careful. If you come back dead, I’ll bring you back to life just so I can kill you in a far more brutal and prolonged way.” The stone-cold seriousness in her tone and the blank expression on her face had him genuinely worried she might.
‘I’ll be upstairs, you talk to him.’ He mouthed. At least, that’s what Draco understood from the general shape his mouth made. Coward. Harry disappeared out the door faster than he’d seen him move in ages.
He crept into the bedroom quietly when he realised Harry was already asleep. This was one of the things Draco loved most about being home – seeing Harry so peaceful in his sleep. In their bed. He didn’t like going to sleep like this, without being able to tell him how much he loved him. He’d lost too many people in his life to ever leave things on a bad note. Still, knowing that whatever went on during the day didn’t stop them sleeping next to each other was a comfort.
‘You sweet-talker,’ Harry teased, finally opening his eyes. Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He never got over how startlingly green Harry’s eyes were, as if they held the power of his magic for all to see. It used to be an old legend among muggles, men with shining eyes who could perform miracles. They believed it was a sign of divine power, and Draco was sure they were powerful wizards like his Harry. He’d never met anyone else whose eyes shone like that.
‘Calm down Draco, it’s nothing like that. I bought an old manor house I’d like to turn into an orphanage.’ He said. Draco’s eyebrows shot up towards his hairline and it made his head ache, but it was worth it because Harry manage to elaborate. ‘I decided quite a while ago that I didn’t want to be an auror anymore,’ he began. ‘Then the Head Auror opportunity came up and I took it on as a favour to Kingsley. He didn’t have anyone else who was capable of taking on the role and I couldn’t leave him in the shit like that.’
Luna had also helped Harry research what to feed Aspen. It was straight forward as a general rule – he could feed him fruit and vegetables which he had in the flat for himself anyway. The most disgusting part for Harry was some of the insects and raw foods Luna recommended. The idea of feeding a cute and fluffy fox crickets and whole rabbits made Harry’s stomach turn, but he was trying.
‘Us.’ He said quietly, and Harry immediately felt bad. He often referred to Draco and ‘his’ baby and at first Draco had taken that to mean that Harry hadn’t wanted children but really, Harry only did it to avoid admitting how much he wanted it too. There was a hole in his heart every day that made him ache wanting to have a family with Draco and see Draco be happy. He held Draco impossibly tighter as if he might float away.
‘We should also figure out what we’re going to do when Teddy comes how. It might be a bit much if we both appear at the station. We got away with it when he left, but I’m pretty sure the
‘I think that’s a great idea Ted, you should tell Neville. I’m sure he’d love to help you figure it out.’ Draco knew it was early days for things like that, but it wouldn’t do any harm to encourage his interests. He stood up to clear the plates away after that, effectively putting an end to talk about Hogwarts, although he thought he heard the mention of ghosts over the rushing water from the tap.
‘You don’t have to be religious to know history, Harry. I didn’t even celebrate Christmas remember? You’re not the only one though. Muggles used to think they were French kings. Tried to behead them during the French Revolution. Those statues aren’t the originals, they were replaced in the 19
“Come on. There’s nothing for you in here.” Harry wasn’t known for his rational decision making, so he scooped the fox up like it was a puppy and made to carry it to the kitchen. It started snapping its jaws at him and he was convinced, as he walked down the hallway, that he was going to have his arm bitten off. He refused to let go though, so he ran his finger very carefully between the fox’s ears. Immediately the fox was quiet. Both ears returned to their regular position and as if a switch had been flicked the fox settled in his arms.
He kept touching his arm. Sometimes he didn’t even realise he was doing it. He was sure that he was probably ruining their little catch up, but he didn’t know what he could do about it. What was the alternative? Smith had mentioned his memory, maybe finding what was missing would also release the block on his magic. But how on earth would he be able to know what he’d forgotten? That was the whole point.
September was shaping up to be the worst day of Draco’s life. He stood on Platform 9 ¾ for the first time since the beginning of his seventh year of school. There were kids everywhere, shouting between carriages, pushing and shoving to get their luggage on as quickly as possible and finding someone to spend their first train journey with. There were parents laughing and crying, some doing so at exactly the same time.
If it was a dog or a cat Harry could have easily held out until morning, but from the days when Uncle Vernon made them all watch Countryfile on the television, Harry was under the impression foxes could dangerous when kept shut in. It did seem so very…calm though. Cautiously, he leant down to the fox’s level. It stopped its pawing and looked at him with its pale blue eyes. Up close Harry could see its fur was a blend of soft greys and whites. Its teeth looked sharp and menacing the way they were bared at Harry, but the fox seemed to be panting with excitement. Tentatively, Harry reached his hand out and it sunk into the thick fur.
“Then don’t get caught.” She said bluntly, as if it was as plain as the nose on her face. Draco looked to Granger, but she didn’t react.
‘I didn’t feel like I deserved you. Everywhere we went people would look at me that way, I know you know what I mean, and it didn’t matter that I knew they were wrong about me, I just knew that you could do way better than me and it wasn’t fair that you had to deal with that every time we tried to go somewhere just because of me.’ Draco refused to look anywhere near Harry throughout his little speech. He scrunched his eyes tight shut, even though the only view he had was of Harry’s bare shoulder. He felt completely exposed, and not just because of the copious skin on skin contact.
‘Because you’re absolutely miserable and I’m sick of looking at your stupid face.’ She said bluntly.
‘The tree is up! With all my stupid old decorations! It’s better when he’s home.’ Teddy said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world, but Draco noticed. Teddy thought of this place as home. Their home – all three of them together. Had he really been so blind this whole time? How different things might have been if Draco hadn’t been so stubborn. Then again, Harry hadn’t left him much option with all his stalking and his excessive anger.
‘I’ll see you in a bit.’ He said casually like he hadn’t just knocked the breath out of Draco’s lungs.
‘It’s not that simple.’ He told her. It wasn’t; they’d both lied, they’d both been angry, they’d both made mistakes, they’d both come too far to pretend like they were good for each other.
“THAT’S BECAUSE YOU ATE IT ALL!” He yelled right back, coming to investigate where the last pot went. He
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy, it’s only me. I’m not about to hex you.” Harry tries to lighten the mood but Malfoy only frowns. It makes two perfectly symmetrical eleven lined between his eyebrows that weren’t there the last time Harry saw him. For some unknown reason, Harry loves them.
He needed to get back downstairs as it was already approaching the hour mark and he needed to take the Polyjuice and more Pepper-up before he left.
He had been resigned back at the Manor, but it really hit him as he was dragged into the heart of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement that there would be no one to come for him; to pay his bail or to explain their way out of it. If he was lucky, Pansy would get him a decent lawyer, but most of the good ones wouldn’t work with the likes of him.
‘Nevermind.’ Teddy said sleepily as he helped Draco get him into his pyjamas. ‘I’m glad you came. Dad said you weren’t coming.’ He said as he slid under the covers. Draco frowned.
‘Draco! Darling! So good to see you!’ His old school friend Daphne Greengrass came waltzing over, greeting him with kisses on each cheek. She was just about the only person he knew whose accent sounded ever more pretentious than his own. She could give the Queen a run for her money.
‘There’s a small place in the grounds. I decorated it myself. I asked Spungen to maintain the charmwork but other than him, I’m the only one in the world who knows it exists. I found it one day when I was walking the grounds before the landscape designer arrived. I hid it under a disillusionment charm. It’s beautiful, and I think that’s where I’d like to be.’
‘Don’t worry about it. Look, he’s up and about and annoying us as much as ever.’ Harry ruffled Teddy’s hair and Draco scowled at him.
A few days later Draco found himself at Hermione’s, holding a very sleepy Hugo whilst Harry sat on the floor tickling a squealing Rose.
‘I told them not to contact me under any circumstances. I specifically said I was going away for a family emergency and they were to contact literally anyone else. Why can’t people just listen? Just because this whole thing was my idea doesn’t mean I know everything about everything!’ He picked up his wine glass which had been left untouched and downed it like water.
‘Really? Yes!’ She was practically jumping up and down on the spot. Draco stood and held a hand out to her.
Harry explained to him how the fox had shown up at his and Ron’s flat, how he had been learning how to take care of him with Luna’s help, how it had been weeks now and no one had shown up to claim him. They went into the kitchen and Sirius made them tea, all the while listening attentively to what Harry had to say.
‘May I please use your bathroom before I go?’ Draco thought if she was any sweeter, he might get a cavity.
To Harry’s credit, the party had been a raging success. Pansy had brought him a cake from a fancy French patisserie on her way from Dubai. Which quite frankly was the best cake Draco had ever eaten, possibly even better than his wedding cake. Ok no, nothing was better than that. Teddy was fast asleep tucked up next to Draco. His arm was going a bit numb from supporting the boy’s head and neck, but it was worth it if it meant Teddy wouldn’t be sore when he woke up. Rose and Hugo had worn him out terribly.
‘Well, it’s rather urgent actually, which is why I’m making this call myself. My auror department has been investigating a series of unfortunate cases of severed magical cores. We’ve had every specialist at St Mungo’s on the case, and no one can seem to figure out what’s causing it. I was wondering if we would be able to bring in your potions expertise to help solve the case.’ Draco was incredibly surprised.
‘Push my day back by fifteen minutes. This is important.’ He said to her. She was less than impressed, but didn’t dare question him, and began scrabbling around for random pieces of parchment. Draco knew she wouldn’t last the year out, she was clearly far too poorly organised for such a position.
‘No, I’m not.’ Teddy sniffled. ‘I’m scared of…’ Harry caught Draco’s eye as they waited for Teddy to figure out what he wanted to say. Draco’s heart was racing. This was the longest he and Harry had been in the same room together since the divorce, and Draco didn’t know how to feel. ‘I’m scared of you not being here when I come back.’
“Say no more,” he interrupted, thinking better of it. “I want plausible deniability.” Granger smirked.
‘I’m glad he’s back home, because he makes you happy too.’ Harry didn’t say anything to him, just backed out of the room and closed the door. He rested his head against the door and closed his eyes.
‘Everything said in this room stays inside this room, Draco. I wouldn’t ever repeat anything you tell me, and even if I did, I’d have my license revoked and my wand snapped no questions asked.’ That didn’t make Draco feel any better.
“Malfoy, please. People will die.” It’s manipulative of him to say it, he knows, but it’s not wrong. He can see the moment the gears start turning in Malfoy’s mind. He places the cup gently on its saucer and sets it down on the coffee table. He straightens up his shirt as he sits back up, like he means business.
‘That’s not the point, Draco. Teddy needs you. He loves you just as much as he loves Harry and children can’t have too many loving influences in their life.’ Draco knows she’s right, he knows that Teddy is the most important thing in his life at the minute, but he’s at his wit’s end.
“WELL WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THIS SOONER YOU UTTER BUFFOON. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO RAVE ABOUT MARGARET ATWOOD WITH YOU?!”
‘Why do I have to tell you where I’m going and what I’m doing every minute of the day? So what I had something to do that didn’t involve you? So shoot me for having a life outside of you!’
‘What is it? Tell me you didn’t get involved. Draco that’s the last thing I wanted, the whole point of me keeping it from you-’
‘Harry…’ Draco’s eyes pricked with hot tears as he tried to force his breathing to remain steady. His chest burned with the effort, but he refused to make a scene at Harry’s birthday.
He unconsciously held Hugo a little closer. ‘No Hermione. You know I love you but stay out of this. I appreciate everything you’ve done to find this but I’m not going to create a new bond just so I can have my magic back. Harry and I can discuss this another time.’ She was looking at him with exasperation but he hoped his tone was stern enough to discourage arguments. He felt like he and Harry had really turned a corner and he didn't want that to be ruined. He didn't need to have his magic back, but he did need to know that Harry loved him and not just because he thought it would save him. He didn't look at Harry as he left the room.
‘It must just be your all-powerful presence.’ He said seriously. Harry grinned, and Draco kissed the grin right off his face. Kissing Harry had always been his favourite past-time.
“I suppose it was a long shot.” She shouted right in his ear as the room rumbled around them. If it were to collapse, they would never make it out in time. He couldn’t find it in him to respond, he could only cling to her and wait for the shaking to stop.
was pounding in time with the beat of his heart and he was struggling to concentrate. His fingers itched to reach out to her, but he forced himself to stay where he was.
Should he confront Harry? Confront might be the wrong word. He didn’t know Harry had even done anything, all he had were easily misconstrued photographs. He should say something though, shouldn’t he? After all, if Harry had nothing to hide, he’d get a simple response and that would be that. But then, would it make Draco look paranoid? Would it make him seem even more ridiculous? What would Harry think of him if he immediately thought the worst of him when in fact, he’d done nothing at all?
“Harry what-” she wasn’t quick enough to pull her arm away before he pushed her sleeve back and exposed the creamy white, silky skin of her inner arm. Without a dark mark.
Out of interest, he pressed his hand fully to the bare wood of the ceiling beams. The effect was intense. It was as if he could feel the life of the building run right through him. He felt supercharged, like he’d just woken up from the most refreshing sleep he’d had in his life. When he took his hand away the wound was completely healed over like it had never been there before. He wanted to stay there and marvel at what he had just discovered, but he knew his window for escape was small and he didn’t want to take any chances.
Only when Draco was left alone in his cell did he allow himself to really take in what was happening. Panic washed over him like a tidal when he realised that there was no father to charge in and demand he be released and no mother waiting for him to come home. His throat clamped shut so painfully it made his eyes water and he gasped for breath. He thought about his father now, how he had been in a cell like this one and Draco had barely cared. Not the second time anyway. He remembered the summer after his fifth year when his father had been locked up after the fiasco in the Department of Mysteries. It had terrified Draco then to see a man he thought untouchable reduced to nothing but a skeleton in a small, windowless, hovel. If he had known…
Eventually, Harry’s knees become stiff. On a routine op last year, he’d been hit by a poorly aimed jinx which dislocated his right kneecap and it had never been the same since. Since he was neither use nor ornament to the research, he gets up and does a lap of the room, or a turn about the room as they would have said in the olden days. The kind of days when this room would have been considered modern.
‘No one said it was going to be easy, you know. You can’t expect everything to go right back to normal just because you take the potions they tell you to.’ Harry looked down, fiddling with the edge of the blanket. He’d always had trouble looking at people when he was talking about how he felt. ‘We’re lucky to have you at all Draco, I just want to make sure it stays that way.’
‘You won’t even read with me? I came all this way, and I know there’s a book in there you’d love to tell me about.’ There was silence. He waited. He wouldn’t rush her.
“And then all that silly business with your mother. Of course, having a gay son isn’t exactly ideal for a pureblood, but times are changing Draco. If you would just sit down and talk...” Pansy continued as Draco’s mind was elsewhere.
‘You’d never tell. Macmillian nearly chewed my ear off when he found that massive pinboard you made like that guy from
‘Good afternoon Mr Malfoy, I do apologise for interrupting your afternoon.’ Kingsley had been one of the few people to support Draco and Harry’s relationship when the first came out and Draco would be eternally grateful.
‘Draco! I wasn’t expecting to see you.’ She walked around the box she’d been packing to greet him with a hug. He was getting so many of those recently.
‘I’ve just finished Paris fashion week and I’m hanging around for a while, catching up with old faces, trying to wrangle some collab deals for next season. You know the score.’ Blaise went into modelling after Hogwarts and had taken the muggle fashion industry by storm with his cleverly tailored clothes which really were one-size-fits-all. Of course, that was because they were all charmed to adjust to the individual’s body shape, but the muggles didn’t know that. He was particularly popular among plus size and maternity demographics, because his clothes adapted with their owners. Draco was convinced that muggles couldn’t be quite that stupid, but maybe he wasn’t appreciative enough of how vain some people could be. Yes, the irony of that statement wasn’t lost on him.
Sirius sat patiently and waited for Harry to figure out what it was that he wanted. He had always known what Harry needed, even though he had been missing for so many years of Harry’s life.
‘I’m never going to abandon you, Draco. I love you.’ Draco nodded around the lump in his throat. Swallowing it down, he opened his mouth to tell him how much he knew that now.
Draco had justified not telling Harry the truth with the idea that Harry couldn’t love him as much as Draco loved Harry, but all he’d done was make Harry think Draco didn’t love him at all. He’d pushed him away, he’d made Harry feel like Draco didn’t want to be with him. Harry thought Draco acted strangely when they went out because Draco was ashamed of him. That couldn’t have been further from the truth.
‘It’s ok, I love you too.’ Draco’s breath hitched. He didn’t know what to say to that. This was so much worse than he thought it would be. He loved Harry and Harry loved him, but Draco lied through his teeth about his issues and Harry went behind Draco’s back and accused him of a potions addiction. God, this was such a mess and now that Teddy had gone to Hogwarts, there was nothing distracting them from their own issues.
“I just wanted to say, in case I don’t get the chance tomorrow, that I know I sort of forced you to do this, but I really am grateful.” Sweet lord, Granger was getting sentimental on him.
Teddy hadn’t noticed their little exchange, instead he’d gone straight for the presents under the tree. Draco couldn’t blame him – he’d waited a good chunk of the morning for this.
‘Well, you were always rolling over and taking the hits. And no, I don’t just mean with the healer training.’ Harry held up a hand to stop Draco as he opened his mouth to interrupt. ‘I just wanted you to have some faith in us. Stand up and show people they were wrong about you. I could’ve easily gone charging in and shot them all down, but I knew how much it meant to you that you worked hard and earned it. I wanted you to trust that I’d support you no matter what happened, and you didn’t have to be scared to just be you. I don’t know how that turned out so badly, but I only ever meant well.’
Today was a Tuesday. Tuesdays were Luna’s days off – she did her magizoology training on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, although she studied round the clock. A few days after Harry had first been to see her, Luna had noticed something odd about Aspen’s behaviour. Although foxes are highly strung animals, Aspen seemed more prone to anxiety than he should be. It was difficult for her to find out the reason for this since they had no way of knowing whether it was normal for Aspen or not.
But then the ground began to shake. The beam of light flickered and faded, and Draco’s hopes went out with it. Dust fell from above them, and Draco grabbed hold of Granger as she wobbled and almost fell.
‘Do you mind if I head over to the flat?’ He asked but didn’t move from his one-armed hug. Harry squeezed him closer into his side for a second.
He didn’t today. He stayed exactly where he was and burrowed back into the dip of Harry’s collarbones.
‘I’m sorry!’ She wailed. He pulled her back against his chest and let her cry it out. He could feel her tears soaking through his clothes, but he knew once she’d got it out of her system she’d probably be fine. A few minutes later, Susan knocked on the open door. She was clever, not crossing the threshold and respecting Ella’s boundaries.
‘I know, I know, you don’t have to explain.’ Harry told him quietly and for once, Draco was inclined to believe him.
‘You trashed the bathroom, Draco. That shouldn’t happen.’ She looked concerned at he tried not to get annoyed. Everyone was always so concerned about him – it would be nice to be left to just be.
‘Why do you keep looking at me like that?’ He felt naked under Harry’s eye and it was more than disconcerting.
Come to think of it, Potter had probably forgiven Pansy by now. Heaven knew Draco didn’t deserve to be forgiven but he had been, and he’d done far worse than Pansy ever had. If Potter never came back perhaps Pansy would stay partially outcast forever. It hardly mattered anyway as Draco refused to believe Potter was dead, despite all the evidence to suggest he could be. Potter had defied the laws of nature on so many occasions Draco wouldn’t put it past him to do it again. Besides, he just had this…
“It’s impressive.” Lyra said with wonder. “You might be able to undo the burns, but I don’t think you’ll be able to restore it to its original state. That’s the kind of thing you’ll need a professional for.”
“When you bloody well left without him! Honestly Potter, being partnered with you is the worst thing that’s ever happened to him. And he actually has the audacity to say you’re the best auror in the department. I swear if he’s dead I’ll kill him.” Harry avoids pointing out the flaw in that logic.
‘Sooo, you and I,’ she said, poking him in the chest, ‘are going to work together to get this damn support network set up. I’m not having magical children disappear into the abyss. Not on my watch!’ There was a glint in her eye, one he remembered from school, except now instead of looking malicious, it was more like a mad genius. He wasn’t entirely sure if that was better.
Doing his best to ignore the blinding pain in his crotch, Harry flung back the bedcovers and launched himself at the two of them, ripping the fox away from Lyra by the back of its neck. Aspen didn’t take kindly to this approach, screaming loudly and snapping his jaws, but he didn’t scratch at Harry. In his rage, Harry no longer cared about treating the refugee fox with care, instead holding the animal up to his eye level, still gripping it by its neck.
“This is Harry’s invisibility cloak. I took it from his house before the Ministry did their search. They’re very rare and I know for a fact Robards – he’s Head Auror – has been trying to get his hands on it for years. We’ll cover Harry in it to get him out. Even without it, he’s a professional sneak.” There was a wistful smile on her face and it pained Draco that all those headlines he had read about what had happened to Potter never once mentioned the people who really know him, who were truly hurt by his disappearance, not just the adoring fans who missed his charming smile and his outrageous hair.
‘Well the truth is, that isn’t what’s bothering me.’ Teddy admitted, fiddling with the ragged sleeve of his jumper. Draco frowned.
“Oh honey, you know I love how bookish you are. I just can’t keep up with you.” Harry starts rubbing at Draco’s shoulders. He’s been at this for hours and it’s a welcome relief for his aching back. Draco had thought about Harry’s ability to read quite a lot. He’s noticed how hard he has to concentrate on making sure he reads the next line instead of skipping a couple, he’s also noticed that sometimes he gets stuck on a word even though Draco knows Harry knows that word.
If someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I'd have written well over 200k of fic by now, I'd have called them mad. It just goes to show!
The song was softer than the version Harry was familiar with. Malfoy sang it slower too, like she had all the time in the world to hit each note with perfect clarity. Harry had no idea Malfoy could sing like that – her voice was soft and rich, and it floated up to the higher notes as if it took no effort at all. It was as though a summer breeze was sweeping through the room and ruffling Harry’s hair.
He slid across the bed, closing the distance between himself and Harry, and plastered himself against Harry’s bare back. He always found it amusing that Harry either slept in his boxers or completely naked no matter what time of year it was. It looked ridiculous compared to the full-length pyjamas Draco preferred in the winter. He put an arm over Harry and rested his hand against his chest, hoping his hands weren’t too cold against his skin. He pressed a kiss against his shoulder and tried his best to keep himself together. Tonight wasn’t about him.
‘Touché. Is everything ok?' Draco shrugged. He wanted to wait until he and Harry were back in the privacy of their own home to talk about it, not that he felt there was much to say. Luckily for him, Ron was never the type to ask too many questions, unlike Hermione. 'Are you sure you’re alright holding him? You can put him down you know.’ He changed the subjected and indicated towards Hugo. Draco’s arm was aching slightly, but it felt reassuring to have him there.
He felt like he’d only been asleep for a few minutes when the floo flared and through his blurry vision he could make out messy dark hair and round glasses.
‘Think about it though would you? He’s getting…incessant.’ Draco felt that in the pit of his stomach. He was doing this to Harry, he was making him suffer. He just didn’t see how going public now would help them. What if someone found out his mark was back? What if he was demonized all over again? He wasn’t sure he could handle it and he couldn’t face pushing Harry away again. Maybe he was already…
‘He hasn’t left your side the whole time you’ve been in. Slept in the chair and everything. The first week, I tried to send him home every night. By the second I realised that wasn’t going to happen.’ Draco looked to the other side, remembering the feeling against his hand.
‘She doesn’t even know my real name. I’m heading the project under an alias so that it doesn’t attract too much attention. I don’t want people to think I’m just doing it for the publicity. It’s all under the alias Albus Severus on both the muggle and the wizarding side of things.’ Draco physically winced, despite the accompanying pain.
He felt a pang of worry. ‘You’re not angry with me for asking you for this, are you? I swear I don’t want to upset you any more than I have…’ Harry finished dropping the memory into the pensive and turned to face Draco who was biting his lip with anxiousness.
Harry smiled at him. ‘I ordered you the seabass and edamame, I hope you don’t mind. I figured you needed a minute.’ For a moment he was overcome with love for the man sitting opposite him, looking like a model.
Harry opened his mouth to cut in, but Draco wouldn’t let him interrupt him now that he had started. Harry’s grip on him tightened and Draco buried his face into his shoulder before he told him the one thing he’d never told anyone else before. He knew that telling him wouldn’t fix what had broken, but if he could keep this feeling for a little longer, then nothing on earth would stop him. Harry might have been a bit of a rubbish husband, but he was a good man.
On this occasion Harry chose to say nothing; he really wasn’t in the mood to start an argument with Kreacher. Draco was supposed to have been home an hour ago and so far there’d been absolutely no sign of him. Harry had taught Draco how to cast a patronus for exactly this reason, because Draco knew Harry got worried when he was out on his own for too long.
“What’s all this about?” Harry asked him. Draco didn’t answer at first, and a knot formed in Harry’s stomach as he thought he’d said something wrong. What if this was a ‘sorry we can’t be friends’ picnic or a ‘this was a mistake and I don’t really like you’ picnic? Harry’s palms started to sweat, but he realised if it was anything like that the chances of Draco sitting with him like this would be slim.
‘Draco, I knew from the minute I drew up the agreement and found you’re still listed on the magical register as Draco L. Potter.’ Kingsley said simply.
‘He nearly died, didn’t he?’ It was really more a statement than a question, and one loaded with much more understanding than one would ever expect from an eleven-year-old.
‘Take it.’ Harry said, gesturing to the potion once again. ‘Go on.’ Draco’s mind was fogging again. He didn’t like to be put on the spot. He slid onto one of the stools at the breakfast counter before it became obvious he was crumbling again. He wouldn’t be weak, he wouldn’t. He was a grown man, he would not be reduced to a snivelling child just because someone shouted at him.
Giving into his inner sap, Draco threaded his fingers through Harry’s. The briefest flicker of a smile graced his features and Draco’s heart squeezed painfully in his chest. In the same vain that he desperately wanted to find the Harry he’d fallen in love with, he wondered how much of himself had stayed the same as the person Harry had fallen in love with. He realised that much of who he had been had nothing to do with being a supposed dark wizard or even his ability to perform magic. Throughout his teens and most of his twenties he’d walked the streets with some sense of invincibility. He had taken for granted that eventually he’d find those who liked him for who he was, even if the rest of the world didn’t care to find out. Where had that Draco gone? The one who apologised for nothing and marched to the beat of his own drum. He didn’t need magic to do those things, he just needed his confidence back.
Harry stares at him in disbelief until he realises that Malfoy is in fact joking. The eruption of laughter in a little more violent than the subtle joke warrants but once Harry has started, he sets Malfoy off too. Each time one of them manages to control the laughter the other one starts up again and so the vicious cycle goes. When their sides hurt too much to countenance even a single ‘ha’, they lapse back into silence and Malfoy goes back to his work.
“Do you think we’re doing the right thing? You know they’ve given up looking.” Her words came as a punch to his stomach. He had pinned all sense of morality on Granger being the better person of the two of them, but over the course of the past month he had discovered just how far she was willing to go.
‘I see.’ Draco sighed. ‘And where exactly are you planning on taking me?’ He asked, although he wasn’t going to agree to go anyway.
‘Oh. Really? I was never all that religious. My aunt and uncle went to church at Christmas but that was about it.’ Draco shook his head.
‘Of course. Sorry. What were we talking about?’ Draco know she knew exactly what they’d been talking about, but he took the bait anyway.
Making his way downstairs he paused outside the tapestry room. A cold shiver ran down his spine just at the atmosphere in that part of the landing, yet he was still tempted to open the door. His hand hovered over the door handle. On one hand, seeing the anomaly in the fabric might set him off again and he couldn’t handle more of the dizziness. On the other hand, with a clearer head it might confirm some of his suspicions.
‘Don’t be silly. Even if he does get mad, you tell me and I’ll jinx him into the middle of next week.’ That got a laugh out of him.
The house was out of the city, thankfully. Away from prying eyes and traffic noise. Draco had never done that well in London anyway, having grown up in the Wiltshire countryside. He picked up his coat and scarf from the wonky coat rack. He hoped it wouldn’t be too cold outside.
They turned to look at him as he entered and helped himself to a cup of tea, still piping hot. He felt a wave of nerves take over him when Blaise snorted.
‘Yeah. Just thought you should know.’ Harry said as he started rubbing his neck awkwardly again. ‘Anyway, I should be going, I have someone-somewhere to be.’ Draco heard the someone. He said nothing.
Pansy was beginning to get exasperated by Draco’s inattentiveness. He should probably be careful not to push her away too – Blaise wouldn’t even talk to him anymore because he was sick of either being ignored or hearing Draco complain about Potter, or a lack of Potter. Blaise had also taken the disappearance badly since he had a massive crush on Potter. Not that Draco had a crush of course. Draco was purely concerned about the implications of the knowledge he possessed; going to prison because of Harry
‘Grace is trying to solve the murder and this man won’t let her because she’s a girl. He’s mean.’ He grinned and her when her little brows furrowed, and her lips pursed. It was one of the cutest things he’d ever seen.
He must’ve drifted back off the sleep after that, as when he resurfaced the healer was gone and the shadows in the room had shifted dramatically with the sun. He figured it was probably sometime in the late afternoon. Harry was gone too, which made Draco feel oddly bereft.
‘Three weeks. You’re lucky Harry has the temper he does. When he realised I’d told you about Gringotts he was determined to go after you and explain. If he hadn’t, well…’ She trailed off. She placed her outer robes on the back of the spare chair in the corner of the room and stood where the healer had been when she’d checked on him before.
“Stop that!” Harry exclaimed. He tried to wrestle the orange monstrosity away from the fox, but it snarled and hissed at him as if preparing to attack him too. “I know you understand me!
By the time he’d made it to the open plan kitchen-living room, all Draco’s idea of course, he’d managed to collect his scattered belongings. He was looking around for his wand, which he must’ve dropped somewhere along the way, when a lone picture frame caught his eye. He walked over to the side table next to the sofa he had been adamant was worth the small fortune it cost and picked up a silver-guilt frame he’d never seen before. He turned the photo around and gasped when he realised that it was a photo of him he’d never known had been taken.
‘Draco?’ He asked. It was a stupid thing to ask, Harry knew it was Draco. Grimmauld Place was warded so tightly it was harder to get into than Fort Knox – Harry’d made sure of that when Draco’d had a death threat sent by owl in the week after they’d gone public with their relationship.
Sirius cleared his throat. “Yes, of course. It’s nice to see you. What brings you here?” His words seemed disjointed and too polite.
Gritting his teeth, he flung the bedsheets off and got out of bed. The clock on his bedside table read just after five in the morning and he groaned miserably. This wasn’t an opportunity he could afford to miss however, so he dragged himself downstairs, wrapping a silk dressing gown around him as he went. He had kept most of his dressing gowns as his mother embroidered his name beneath the family crest herself and they always reminded him of her, but they provided little to no warmth, especially in the early hours of the morning when the air was bitterly cold.
‘Oh. But you just got here?’ Draco didn’t have to look to know he’d upset Harry, but it wasn’t like this was easy for him.
Draco stood and wrapped his arms around him. He could feel him trembling against him, but he held him close and kissed his temple gently.
‘No, Granger. He somehow neglected to mention that in his terrible excuse for a note. How he made it through Hogwarts with that chicken scratch for handwriting, I’ll never know.’ Hermione’s smirk made Draco want to send her a nasty stinging hex, but he refrained. There were children present.
The air in the apartment was a little stale, being one of the least used parts of the chateau, but he’d cracked the windows open a tiny bit and it was slowly refreshing the place. He’d left it much as it was in terms of layout – it was obvious it was a designated area most likely for those in-laws everyone had but didn’t want to put up with. What was he talking about? He didn’t have any in-laws.
It’s very wrong of Harry to smile given the circumstances, but he does enjoy seeing Malfoy in his element again. He imagines that if Malfoy had been a muggle, he’d have made a perfect university professor. Oxbridge educated of course – a Malfoy wouldn’t stand for less.
‘Oh.’ He felt incredibly cold all of a sudden. ‘I see.’ Hermione patted his arm with sympathy before sitting down on one of the sofas and pulling her legs up underneath her. Draco would’ve winced at the creases she’d put in her dress, but he was a little preoccupied.
“Harry, I don’t think you should-” Ron’s warning died in his throat because the fox had collapsed on the floor and rolled over on its back, whining for attention. Overcoming the shock a little, Harry could only think of how bizarre the whole thing was, and for the first time wondered if perhaps he was on a bad trip from a spiked drink. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“First question.” Pansy turned her sharp eyes on Draco. “If something happens to Hermione, what are you going to do with your magic restrictions.” Her stare was piercing, and Draco swallowed thickly.
“It’s ok, Harry. I know exactly what you mean. I could try to introduce myself to him? Foxes can act similarly to dogs when they’re very young. But I mean
“You silly sausage,” he said with mild exasperation as he felt water seep through his jeans. “Can you go five minutes without making a mess, hm?”
‘I’m not here to tell you anything. I’m here to listen to what you have to say. It’s never crossed your mind why it was him? Why not Harry or your mother or one of your friends? Why you father?’
“No, no, it’s fine.” Harry kept a healthy medical supply out of habit now. Ron nodded and left to go to bed. Harry listened as his footsteps retreated down the hall and he turned back to the fox still cowering in the corner. Ignoring the sting of the scratches on his arms a while longer, he tried to coax the poor thing towards the makeshift bed. It wouldn’t budge from the corner.
Draco curled into Harry’s side feeling overwhelmingly guilty for being irritated with him. After all, communication had been one of the main reasons they’d ended up getting divorced, they shouldn’t be falling back into those bad habits now.
‘Harry, please. That’s not important right now.’ Draco said. He suddenly felt very tired, as if the adrenaline from his panic attack had left his body all at once.
It had looked like blood to begin with. A deep bluish purple which looked like a bruise. He’d taken a blood replenishing potion and that had been that. Now though, it was inky black, as deep as his dark mark had been during the war. It reached his shoulder now – a heavy weight pressing down on his chest and forcing the air out of his lungs. It felt a lot like it had when he’d first had that vision of his father, when what he now knew was poison had flooded his veins. He choked and spluttered trying to get air into his body. He supposed it was stupid to have tried to perform magic in the middle of the night having not warned Harry at all. But then, it had never quite done this before.
He sat down at his kitchen table to open the letter, which seemed far thicker than any letter he’d ever received from Gringotts before. Gringotts never contacted anyone unless to inform them of an inheritance or an outstanding debt to be paid, neither of which applied to Draco. With a strange kind of eagerness, Draco tore apart the wax seal and began reading the almost indecipherable goblin script.
Trying to avoid Draco panicking behind the wheel of a hulking great piece of metal and fuel, Harry kept his voice light and calm. “In the middle, at the front. It’s the easiest, ok? Just let it out of gear and push it forward and it’ll go right into third.” Draco actually had pretty good lane discipline and was steady enough with the accelerator, but he was having a hard time with the gears and braking.
Potter was also at the gardens, standing on his own, staring aimlessly into the distance. It was odd because Draco was sure there should be something important about Potter, but he couldn’t quite remember what. Had he been meeting him here? That wouldn’t make any sense…maybe there was some event going on he’d forgotten about. But then, what kind of event would bring he and Potter into the same circle?
‘So, Ted, tell us all about Hogwarts.’ He and Harry exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what they might hear.
He left Pansy and Blaise on the balcony of the first-floor parlour and explored the rest of the chateau alone. After taking a few wrong turns and getting lost, he eventually found what could only be described as the master suite, although it took up almost a whole floor. Draco was drawn immediately to the floor-to-ceiling white shutters – he could just imagine himself waking up in this room and drawing them slowly, letting the whole room flood with bright sunlight-
‘Of course I do, why would you even ask me that?’ Harry looked uncomfortable and Draco wondered if he’d been missing something glaringly obvious.
good terms, and Ron and I spent that evening with him and other than being a bit quiet, he seemed fine. There are no new developments on his whereabouts, and no sightings of him since 17
“What do you want me to say? I don’t know.” He said firmly. Granger looked at him with a piercing stare until she decided she was satisfied he was telling the truth. She returned to her seat and scrubbed her hands over her face in frustration and it left her looking even more tired than she had when she arrived.
‘I had some help from Aunt Molly,’ he said proudly, handing one each to Harry and Draco. Draco smiled at the name. Teddy refused to call Molly his grandma. Apparently, he didn’t want to steal her from her own grandchildren. Not that any of them would have minded if he had. Harry said he was a lot like Remus in that way. Draco and Harry exchanged glances, impressed that Teddy had managed to slip them in without either of them noticing.
“Do you need some help with that?” Ron asked him, indicating towards the livid marks, concern etched all over his face.
Draco had heard enough. There were pictures all over the page of him, looking suspicious as all hell. Of course, they managed to catch him on the one day he forgot to use either Polyjuice or a disillusionment charm.
‘Spungen brought food up a few minutes ago. He said eating would help settle you.’ Draco nodded into Harry’s neck but didn’t give any indication of moving otherwise. ‘Come on Draco. I know you don’t want to but if you won’t do it for you, at least do it for me.’ He sighed. He was warm and comfortable and if he stayed here unmoving, he wouldn’t have to face life. Why couldn’t Harry let him ignore everything? Just for a little while…
“I just feel like I should be doing something, you know?” Draco interrupted as Pansy moved on to talk about Theo’s new position as a teaching assistant at Hogwarts. “This is Potter. Surely if they could find him, they’d have done it by now? They must have every resource available looking for him…” Pansy sighed into her coffee, frustrated he had interrupted her mid-flow, placing her cup delicately back down before responding.
But he pushed these thoughts to one side as he focused on preparing for the long day ahead. First chance he got, he went down to the potion lab and grabbed a handful of Pepperups to put in pocket-sized vials for later. Pepperup was one of the few potions he could brew easily as none of the ingredients were restricted.
young.” Sirius suggested.  Harry nodded and tried to coax Aspen out from under the table, but it proved difficult. He was shaking all over again and whining loudly whenever Harry tried to manoeuvre him.
‘I see it hasn’t taken you two long to talk about me behind my back.’ Harry’s voice almost matched Draco’s in its grogginess as he appeared from behind Hermione, but it still made Draco’s heart swoop inside his chest. Or maybe that was the potions.
‘Please, don’t say anything else. I haven’t had time to prepare this at all and if you interrupt me, I think I might be sick. I want to prove to you I won’t leave again, if you’ll let me.’ Draco was about ready to start screaming at him for answers when he pulled a box from his pocket and dropped to one knee. His heart really did stop for just a second.
“What do you want, Draco?” Harry whispered. All the breath escaped Harry’s lungs when Draco shivered. It couldn’t have been from the cold.
Level nine was one of the gloomiest places Draco had ever seen, and that really was saying something. The stairs brought them out into a large circular room that was decorated floor to ceiling in black. There were doors set at regular intervals around the room, lit only by small blue flames.
Despite feigning offense at Draco’s greeting, Pansy made no effort to answer her own questions, and when they sat down at the breakfast table, he saw she was not as well turned out as he thought. The harsh morning light highlighted the dark circles under her eyes that she’d valiantly tried to layer over with make-up. He didn’t know what he should say to her.
Draco felt a little queasy as he looked at his altered appearance in the mirror. He’d Polyjuiced as one of the interns; a dark-haired, brown-eyed seventeen-year-old with non-existent cheekbones and an odd scar to the left of his mouth.
When he finally withdrew from the pensive, he was shaking and crying. Harry didn’t say a word. He hugged him tightly and waited for him to calm down. He cried so hard he hyperventilated, and if it wasn’t for Harry’s hand rubbing soothing circles in his back for him to focus on, he may well have passed out. He hiccupped and spluttered and grew more and more irate. How could he have forgotten that? He knew how much he hated his father by the end, he knew how horrible it had been to live in that house, he knew he had poor circulation because he had nerve damage. How had he managed to forget why?
‘Harry, I know I’ve been an absolute shit, but I need you to help me here, for Teddy’s sake, please.’ He begged him. Harry’s expression softened, and he nodded. He reached out and grabbed Draco’s shaking hand, holding it tightly in his own and suddenly Draco felt like he could breathe again.
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s hesitation, and he let go of his hand. Draco felt bereft for a long moment until Harry’s arm wound around him and he felt his hand resting comfortingly on the small of his back.
As soon as he crossed the threshold into Luna’s house, he felt relaxed. Stepping into her home was like walking into a tropical paradise because although Luna had begun training to be a magizoologist, her house was filled with plants to rival Neville’s obscure tastes. She never locked her door to anyone, so Harry was free to walk right through.
An hour. An hour Draco had to sit in that damn coffee shop waiting for Harry and Leggy-Blonde to be done with their little date. Draco was fuming.
‘He doesn’t hurt me because he’s not a very nice person and I only care what nice people say. But he hurts you. That’s what you and dad used to fight about isn’t it? Because you were scared to go outside because people don’t like you. But you’re not a bad person and I don’t understand why people don’t love you because you didn’t do anything wrong.’
The music was terrible and far too loud, and Draco had a buzzing in his ears that made it difficult to concentrate so he kept downing shots of Tequila until the lights blurred and he couldn’t tell his arse from his elbow. He’d lost Pansy who knows how long ago but he didn’t much care because he was having a great time. At least, he thought he was.
He could see Blaise, even now. As if he was in the dingy cell next to him, lounging languidly on one of the common room’s black settees, the green flames casting sinister shadows over his sharp bone structure even as he smiled at Draco teasingly.
‘You’re wise beyond your years, little wolf.’ Teddy bristled at the nickname then flung his arms around him. Draco stumbled a little in shock, not having expected it, but soon recovered and hugged him back.
‘But I was going to make us breakfast.’ He let Harry turn him around in the gap between him and the counter and he hooked a finger under Draco’s chin, lifting his face so he was forced to look at him.
‘Hermione,’ he said gently, taking her small hand in his large one. ‘We could sit here and shift blame all day, but it won’t change anything and it won’t make either of us feel any better. What’s done is done and all we can do is learn from it.’ She smiled at him warmly.
The heavy pub door slammed loudly when he stepped outside, having been shoved closed by the strong wind that was whistling through the alley. Other than the flickering lights of the pub, Diagon Alley was quiet. In the short time since the war there were shops that had never reopened and the street was still recovering as everything settled into normalcy. In the dark, Fred’s face loomed ominously move the Weasley joke-shop, the moonlight catching his features wrong and casting frowning shadows over him. Harry had come to think of the face of Weasley Wizard Wheezes as Fred, even though that hadn't been the original intention. It made him feel like Fred was still there with them, watching over the business and tipping his hat in greeting whenever anyone walked by. Harry had never said so aloud, but he was sure that if he did his friends would probably agree.
‘I knew you were getting too attached. Now isn't the time for this. I need to finish what I was doing and
‘Draco…’ Harry asked him tentatively, ‘are you alright? You’re very quiet…’ Harry was looking at him earnestly, his eyebrows drawn together with concern. Draco wanted to kiss his frown away, but he wasn’t ready for the fallout if there were any wizards about to spot them. A casual hand hold could be disguised but a kiss…
When he’d renovated the chateau last year, he’d had Blaise help him install a wardrobe of French fashion so that he didn’t always have to bring a ton of luggage with him. Most of what he’d brought this time had been Harry’s. He pulled out the warmest cashmere he could find. He chucked a few items Harry’s way since his nap had likely interrupted Spungen’s unpacking. He’d taken the liberty of buying a few things in Harry’s size – just in case.
He made up his mind to go to the Ministry. It wasn’t exactly a long floo trip from where he was. He had of course been told not to perform any magic unless under supervision of a medical professional which technically meant he was even further away from his goal than he had been when he started.
Harry’s eyes flicked nervously around them. The street was actually quite busy, but Draco could see anything beyond Harry. ‘Maybe. Mostly I just wanted to know you were safe. At first, Hermione didn’t tell me how long you’d been planning on going or what you were going to do here. I didn’t know if- if being around me was really so bad that you’d move across the Channel.’ He wasn’t exactly wrong, was he?
Transfiguration went on forever and Harry spent most of the class trying to think about what Draco wanted to say to him. Their friendship was less tentative than it had been, but Harry knew he had been holding back a lot. It was difficult to settle into a rhythm of friendship with Draco when Harry spent most their time together thinking about how beautiful Draco was. He didn’t really understand how it had happened but coming back for eighth year had suddenly meant he had time to actually
‘’m fine.’ He mumbled into Harry’s chest. He sighed deeply and tried to let go of the anxiety itching his skin.
He jumped when Teddy sidled up to him whilst he was doing the dishes. Harry had always done them the muggle way, even though he didn’t need to, and Draco had picked up the habit since he couldn’t spell them clean.
‘No, no you won’t. If this ever goes anywhere it’ll be seen as an admission of guilt. No, I have a way to solve this, if you’re willing to wait just a little while longer.'
Draco was laying there watching Harry sleep and pointedly ignoring quite how disgustingly ill he really felt. Something big must have happened for Harry to be here. He was in St Mungo’s too, which means whatever it was he’d been brought back to England for treatment. Harry had been here the whole time, here for Draco. Draco’s chest swelled, despite the pain, and he realised that no matter what shit had gone on between them, this was what mattered. Harry would be there. Even if he thought Draco hated him. He loved Draco as much as Draco loved him. It was a nice realisation, it made him feel like the decisions he’d made up until this point had all been worth it. He’d gotten better and he’d understood how he really felt.
‘If you keep moping around like this then yes, that’s exactly what you’ll look like.’ Sometimes, Draco really hates Pansy. She had a point though. Nothing about Draco’s life had changed at all. After the war, Pansy had gone off to Dubai to head up some fancy corporation Draco never listened to her tell him about. He needed some of Pansy’s balls.
Harry nuzzled into his neck and Draco resolutely didn’t give away that his breath tickled. ‘Yeah but those seats don’t have accompanying Draco’s.’ He made fake retching sounds at Harry’s sentimentality.
‘You really love it here, don’t you?’ Draco turned to see Harry with a gut-wrenching sadness etched across his features. Draco stood before him and smoothed out the worry lines with the pads of his thumbs.
‘Don’t be a git, it’s Christmas.’ He began scooping up the shreds of wrapping paper they’d left strewn all over the floor, but Harry stopped him.
“You know I’ve never taken a single breath without him?” He says in a small voice. Harry feels as though all the breath has been sucked out of his body. He’s never thought about it that way. “Orion is four and a half minutes older than me, so technically I’ve never known life without him.” It’s a rather dramatic statement considering the mission was over and Orion had simply missed their portkey home, but the principle is harrowing, nonetheless. Harry’s sure he would be a wreck too if he’d shared his whole life with one person that way.
He sat for a long while with the letter in his hands, wondering what might come of it. He didn’t understand it any more than anyone else did after all. He pulled back his sleeve to look at the dark mark again. He’d taken it for granted that it had almost faded, and it had never occurred to him that it might return. It wasn’t as though he’d forgotten what he’d done or who he’d been, but it was much easier to ignore it when it wasn’t emblazoned on his skin all hours of the day and night.
“You know you’re really not helping yourself here.” When he said nothing, she sighed and continued. “Pansy sent me. She’s been going spare you know, but they wouldn’t let anyone in to see you.” Draco’s blood ran cold. He knew the chances of him getting fair treatment were slim, but if this was how the Ministry were going to play it now, things could only get worse later.
‘You can tell me about it, if you want.’ Draco thought it would be hard to here, but if he wanted Harry back then they both had to be there for each other.
There was a warmth burning in Harry’s chest as her voice carried on the wind like an echo. It was a rich and sweet sound that felt like it reached into his very soul. He was once again mesmerised by the way her fingers danced over the strings. He’d forgotten since that night at the open mic just how talented a musician she was; he remembered how beautiful she had looked when she forgot anyone was watching.
‘Come on, Ted. Let’s have a chat.’ He directed Teddy through to the living room and sat him down on the sofa.
‘Oh, Draco. I didn’t expect you to still be here.’ Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
Ron looked like he wanted to argue with Harry, but managed to hold his tongue. Next came the question of how Harry was supposed to get the blighter out of the hallway and into the kitchen. It seemed quite taken with him for some reason but hoping it would simply follow was pointless.
Pansy poured her fourth cup of tea with shaking hands. She laughed bitterly as she did so. “Of course I haven’t discussed it with Hermione, what is there to say? If it was you, no force on earth would keep me from going after you. We stand by our own.” He would freely admit that when he had first found out about Pansy’s relationship, he was dubious. For the life of him he couldn’t figure out what pulled the two of them together. But now, now he saw the dedication in her. Even though it was killing her to sit by and watch, she knew Granger needed this. It broke his heart.
‘Yeah, yeah. I’m not good at packing. He made it there and back in one piece, didn’t he? I consider that an achievement.’ He nodded towards Teddy who was now rolling his eyes in a fond and all too familiar movement. They tucked into their food and Draco was, for once, filled with confidence that things would turn out just fine.
“You’re right. I’m sorry I haven’t seen you in a while. It’s been so busy with him landing on the doorstep,” Harry explained.
Even after the train disappeared, Harry kept holding onto Draco. Draco wanted desperately to say something, but he didn’t want to break the spell and remind Harry that he hated Draco. He knew he’d been an arse and he didn’t deserve for Harry to be even fake nice to him, but he was selfish, and he wanted it.
Hours and hours went by and no one came for him and it became harder to keep a level head. It shouldn’t have been surprising that he wasn’t going to be treated fairly. This was the same justice department which at one time had been under his father’s thumb. A few more hours and he would be in danger of losing his fingers, since the feeling still hadn't returned. The small space he had to wiggle his fingers in was not enough to keep his circulation flowing. He had tried banging on the thick metal door, but all it did was make his foot sore in the thin, leather-soled shoes he was wearing.
‘I can hear you thinking from all the way across the chateau.’ He jumped when Harry’s voice came from directly behind him. ‘Sorry, love. Didn’t mean to frighten you.’
‘There’s just a blank piece of paper?’ Draco looked at the familiar Marauder’s Map and remembered the time not long after the war when Harry had told him about it. He’d been fuming – he’d had an advantage over him all that time? No wonder he’d stalked him so successfully in sixth year.
He ran to his shower, desperate to get the smell of Harry’s aftershave off him. He ripped off his blue shirt and the chinos he’d chosen to wear and vanished them. He never wanted to see them again. He stepped into the shower and turned the temperature right up, as if burning a couple of layers of skin was some sort of suitable punishment.
‘I’ll leave you two to catch up.’ She said, shooting Harry a pointed look. She left without picking her robes back up from the back of the chair, so Draco assumed that it wasn’t the last he’d be seeing of her.
Behind the desk stood a tall, willowy looking witch with a full head of bright orange hair that curled oddly under her ears. She wore big jam jar glasses which clashed with her DMLE robes. She could easily have been an intern.
“It’s not ideal that you were seen arguing with Harry,” she continued. “But there is no evidence to suggest any foul play. I’ve found witnesses who say they saw you and Harry leaving separately, and on
‘Is everything ok? You’d tell me, wouldn’t you, if it wasn’t?’ Teddy didn’t say anything, just hugged him tighter. He put the plate on the draining board and tried his hands on a tea towel, so he could hug him back. He glanced behind him to see Harry pointing to the hallway.
“I’m sorry, ok? I was more concerned for your wellbeing than knowing what junk you’ve got.” The fox opened its mouth wide, exposing its sharp white teeth, and whined. Harry was confused for a second until he realised it was laughing at him.
‘There’s something else in there too.’ Harry hinted. Teddy routed around in the bottom of the box and sat there on the floor looking puzzled.
‘I’m just so confused Hermione. At the time I felt like Harry was constantly pushing me into doing things and going places that I didn’t want to go. I thought he wanted me to be someone I wasn’t, but now I’m wondering if it was all me.’ He couldn’t get the new feeling of guilt out of his mind.
What did it matter now though? Draco was still the same person. Sure, he didn’t have attacks nearly as often, and he didn’t have an overwhelming need to stay inside all the time, but those issues hadn’t changed. If anything, it would be worse for Draco to tell Harry now. Harry would never let him look after Teddy on his own if he knew how much of a mess Draco was. Not that he’d ever had an episode whilst Teddy was around. No, it absolutely wouldn’t do to go back on things that were done and dusted.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, Lord of Malfoy Manor?” Ponytail spoke with a deep and rasping voice and a faint West Country accent. The title made Draco cringe, but he kept his face impassive.
For once in who knew how long, Harry and Draco departed from King’s Cross Station as awkward and tentative friends. It was more than Draco could ask for, and far more than he deserved, but his grief at saying goodbye to his little wolf until Christmas was dulled just a little bit by the hope that he was finally about to be a mature adult and confront his relationship with his ex-husband.
Snapping the book shut and throwing it away in a fit of anger, Draco decided to walk the grounds. He was anxious for tomorrow and stir crazy looking at the rows upon rows of books all day; he needed to expend some energy.
‘I remember. And you’re right, he’d hate those.’ Instead, Draco chose a simple style, but picked one with self-cleaning charms that kept away the dust. The creepy old witch was still staring at him after he’d paid, but they both left the shop without paying her any mind.
‘There’s nothing to say.’ Draco said shortly. He didn’t want to talk about it and the middle of the work day was absolutely not the time or the place.
He also still hadn’t figured out who’d stepped in at Gringotts. He’d already owled asking for information on who was involved in the decision and as he’d expected, the goblins had been incredibly tight-lipped about the whole affair. Still, it jangled Draco’s nerves more than a little knowing someone other than Hermione had known about his departure. Hermione was a lot of things, but deceitful wasn’t one and she probably didn’t hold that kind of sway with the goblins. Kingsley, maybe? He could certainly pull strings. Would he actually be willing to do that for Draco? Again, unlikely.
“You need the Manor library,” Malfoy finished for him. They had been through a whole pot of tea and then another whilst Harry had explained to Malfoy what research he had done and what he had found so far, which was practically nothing.
‘Of course, I’m very busy but if you could see me first thing in the morning I don’t mind coming into the office early, it really is an emergency.’ Draco couldn’t turn this down, not if the minister was willing to go in early just to see Draco. Whatever it was, it must be incredibly serious.
Still, Draco lived with him. He was there when he woke up in the morning and there when he went to sleep at night. Surely, he would’ve picked up on something. And Wood, he’d seemed genuinely so surprised to think that Draco and Harry- oh. They’d tried so hard to keep it all concealed from everyone except their family, for both Draco’s sake and for Teddy’s. Yet Draco had been so annoyed to see Wood’s smug face that he’d effectively admitted he was back together with Harry. Wouldn’t that be the perfect thing for Wood to run to the press to? He was a social climber – he’d be paid well for the story, he’d get on the good side of the journalists, he’d be credited as the man with inside knowledge. But he hadn’t done any of that. Why? Because it didn’t benefit him. Because if the truth got to the papers, he’d have no leverage to blackmail Harry with. Harry would only play his games if he thought it would protect his family. Why would he do it if there was nothing left to protect?
Aspen would randomly start pacing around a room, screaming at walls and doors like he was crying; he’d start shaking and biting anyone who came too close. At first, it only happened while at Luna’s and Harry presumed that he didn’t like being moved about, but then it started happening at home too.
‘I’ll come with you! I mean, I don’t need to sleep but maybe I could stay with you? I don’t want to be too far away if something happens and uh…I think I might get lost? This place is huge.’ He turned around on the spot and took in the room around them. It wasn’t even the fanciest of the rooms in the chateau, and it was a particularly dull and wintery day which didn’t show off the room’s potential very well. The ceilings were as high as one might expect from a French architect with far too much money and not enough sense. The colour scheme was one of Draco’s favourites though. Pansy, bless her heart, had nearly bitten his head off when he’d suggested ivory and vermillion – she’d almost fainted with the prospect of Draco wanting to decorate anything remotely pertaining to Gryffindor. Draco patiently pointed out that ivory and vermillion were vastly different shades than gold and maroon.
‘Oh, that. It turned out to be no big deal in the end. Just someone being dramatic.’ Harry turned away from him, never once looking up from the bright screen, and went over to one of the few electric sockets in the house. Draco still didn’t even understand how Harry had managed to make them work with the magic, and even if he did, he’d hate them anyway. It was just another thing to drive a wedge between them.
Draco didn’t know what to say. This hadn’t been what he’d expected at all. It didn’t help the pain of knowing that Harry had slept with someone else, he wasn’t sure anything ever would, but he couldn’t blame him for being the victim or for trying to clean up the mess. However badly he’d done it.
And then there were Harry’s eyelashes. Long and thick and fluttering against the tops of his cheeks as dreamed. Harry had beautiful eyes even when they were closed, and Draco missed the way they used to look at him like he was the only thing in the world so much, that he could hardly look Harry in the eye at all now.
‘Don’t sugar coat it, Harry. It wasn’t your fault and I don’t have a bit of a problem.’ He said to the window. He heard Harry sigh from behind him and the sofa creaked slightly as Teddy shifted.
Draco stirred groggily the next morning. His head felt like a heard of Hippogriffs had trampled straight through it and he knew he was in deep shit. There was a warm weight pressed against his back and an arm slung over his waist. After every one-night stand Draco had ever had, he’d never woken up quite like this. Yes, there was often an arm slung over his waist, but it was lifeless and haphazard. This one held him tightly to the body behind him and he could feel a hand splayed over his stomach. Yes, he often woke up tangled with the person whose attention he’d caught the night before, but it was always half turned away from him. This body was pressed hard against his back, like it was desperately trying to cocoon him. He could feel hot, even breaths coasting across the side of his neck and his ear, sending a shiver down his spine. Whoever this stranger was, they held him like he really mattered.
He smoothed the paper back down on the ground, Potter face down where Draco wouldn’t be able to see him. The ache in his heart grew deeper and wider every day without him. It must have been the early hours of the morning before Draco put his head down to sleep, not that he got much of it. It seemed though, that he wasn’t the only one with insomnia in recent months. Something hot burned beneath his cheek and with a sudden burst of energy Draco scrambled for the object he’d stuffed inside his pillow.
‘I guess you’re right,’ he said quietly. Harry shifted, turning his body to face Draco who kept staring ahead at the photo of them on their wedding day on the opposite wall.
While he’s checking the shelves over again, making sure all the books are perfectly level, Harry wanders off and comes back with his laptop. Draco doesn’t use it because he doesn’t understand it and, if he’s honest, all the different buttons sort of scare him.
‘I know, I know. You keep telling me that. Heck, I think I told you that too. We’re such a mess.’ Draco let his head fall into his hands. Harry’s hand on his shoulder made him jump slightly, but he relaxed.
A lock of hair falls into Malfoy’s eyes. His plait has slowly been unravelling as the afternoon wore on. It takes serious effort not to tuck it behind his ear for him, but he finds it equally fascinating to watch Malfoy do it himself. He hasn't even been looking up from his work to speak to Harry, but he doesn't mind at all.
There was no date on the letter, and although it indicated that enough time had passed for Granger to smooth things over on her end, it didn’t give him any indication as to how long he had been out or what the current date was.
‘Do you ever wonder what it would’ve been like if we’d worked out.’ Harry asked him, lifting his head to look at him. There were slight crinkles beginning to form around his eyes – the barest hint that he was quickly approaching his thirties. Draco thought they were almost more beautiful than any other part of Harry and he couldn’t quite explain why.
‘Pansy’s pregnant!’ He shouted, his voice muffled by the sheets over his head. Harry’s head dropped, and his shoulders slumped. They’d been trying to adopt for over a year now and they were having no luck. Harry would do anything to get Draco the baby he so desperately wanted, he wasn’t even above pulling the
‘Fire me if you want.’ Draco said, his voice shaking. ‘I’ve done more to solve this case than the rest of you morons put together. Fired or hired, get the hell out of my office.’ His breathing was becoming uneven and he was twitching with the effort of restraining himself. Harry needed to get the hell away from him in the next couple of minutes or it would all go to shit all over again.
“You see this section here?” Malfoy points to a line of illegible text but Harry just nods so that he can hurry the explanation. “It refers to the Sole Repelleris curse.” Harry can see that he has also written it in his own handwriting next to the manuscript, although Malfoy pronounced it like so-lay when it’s written with an e. There’s a funny flat line over the top of the e which clearly means something to him.
He recognised the handwriting on the topmost envelope – he could spot Hermione’s neat cursive easily amongst the average chicken scratch print any day. He’d have thought Hermione would’ve floo called if there was something important to say, so he eagerly pulled open the letter to find out what might’ve convinced her epistolary communication was better. He took a seat on the nearest armchair, although it wasn’t the most comfortable.
“Well, you are in fact very stupid, congratulations on finally noticing. Quite an achievement for you.” He wanted to come up with a cutting remark, but his brain was lagging, and the moment passed. They lapsed into silence. This was the only opportunity he would have to explain to Lyra what had been going on – the dreams, the dizziness, Aspen – everything. It was the only time he might be able to say anything without everyone thinking he was mad. Poisoned, maybe. But not mad.
“What-” his question was swallowed by a sound not too dissimilar to a howl which erupted from Aspen. Harry dashed over and unbolted the shutters so that Aspen could see the early morning sky beyond. It was dull as ditch water and the street below was a sludgy mess of sleet and mud where it was lit by streetlamps. Aspen pushed up onto his hind legs and pressed his front paws against the glass, turning back to look at Harry like the answer was obvious.
She stared at him as if she was expecting him to say something else. “Hermione’s here and she wants to talk to you. It’s important.” Instantly his heartrate went through the roof.
‘Oh! Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean- well, you are beautiful. I did mean it.’ He shrugged awkwardly as Draco wondered how on earth they were going to get through this if they kept acting like that. He didn’t even know where to look. He was distracted as they were shown their table at the back of the restaurant, concealed behind an unnecessary column. Draco stopped walking and Harry didn’t notice for a few seconds, but he seemed to sense Draco’s hesitation, so he stopped and walked back towards him.
‘Gabriel said we’re welcome any time. I think he has a bit of a thing for you.’ Draco wanted to roll his eyes at Harry’s obvious jealousy, but it was too sweet. He laughed when Harry took a bite of St. Honoré cake and ended up with choux pastry stuck to the side of his mouth with a little bit of cream.
‘More than anything in the whole world!’ She said before burying her face in his neck. If Draco were a softer person, he may well have found tears welling up in his eyes, but he wasn’t like that, not at all.
‘Not much really. He said they weren’t like memory charm scars. He explained it more like my subconscious might have hidden particularly traumatising memories as a coping mechanism? He seemed to think unlocking them would ease the flow of my magic.’
He was dancing with a faceless man who was supposed to be incredibly beautiful, but Draco couldn’t really see his face properly anymore. He had amazing dark hair, was wearing the tightest jeans Draco had ever seen – which left
‘Ok so low-down. You’ve been asleep for a week and a half, they’ve been doing all manner of tests on you every day, I look hideous under these hospital lights but I’m putting up with it because let’s be honest, no one can look worse than you do right now.’ Despite himself, he cracked a smile. He loved his school friends – anyone else would be fussing over him – but not Pansy.
‘I’m ok. It’s kind of nice spending time with the kids. They have no idea what’s going on around them.’ He watched as Hugo’s small eyelashes fluttered as he dreamed. His hair was marginally less flame red than it had been last time he’d seen him, and he hoped he might inherit a little more of Hermione’s colouring. Honestly there was only so much ginger an ex-Malfoy could handle.
‘Shh, shh. I’m here, it’s me. You’re ok.’ Harry whispered in his ear as Draco tried too hard to regain control of himself. He was gasping in breaths too quickly and he was at a high risk of hyperventilating, but Harry stayed whispering in his ear, acting like an anchor for him to hold onto.
The healer passed the forms to Harry who signed them like a fan was asking for an autograph. Draco still couldn’t really feel his fingers, but he held the pen shakily and ignored the tingling pains down his arm long enough to sign his name in a wonky fashion above Harry’s.
‘You should know better than to sneak up on me.’ He said lowly. He knew it was a low blow, but he really wasn’t in the mood for this.
‘I don’t know any such thing.’ He pulled his wrist away and marched up the stairs. He didn’t look back and he didn’t falter until he got to the guest room where he shut the door calmly and quietly. He stood behind it for who knew how long before he sank to the floor, bringing his knees up to his chest, and sobbed into his hands.
‘Draco, you have to try. Please. Not for me, not for anyone else, but for yourself. I know how strong you are and how much you’ve been through. You just need to trust yourself enough.’ Harry looked so determined, so sure, so unwavering. But Draco was none of those things.
‘Never mind. Let’s head home.’ He probably shouldn’t have been flooing backwards and forwards but really what choice did he have when Harry had basically abandoned him. Ok, maybe that was a bit strong but still. Had he actually thought about the implications of him shooting off like that?
‘Leggy-Blonde? How jealous were you, Draco?’ Harry smirked. Draco flushed but he refused to be intimidated.
‘Come here.’ He held a hand out to Draco and motioned for him to join him on the other sofa. Draco took his offer and slunk down next to him. ‘Listen to me. You’re making a big step coming here and doing this, and I want to help you the best way I can. Biting my head off isn’t going to get us anywhere, so just take a deep breath and let’s talk.’ Damn Harry for being so right all the time, it made Draco’s insides crawl. And why did he have to sit there looking so beautiful when Draco just wanted to be mad at him.
The door was open, just a crack. Enough for Draco to see Harry sitting cross-legged on the end of Teddy’s bed, like they were two kids having a sleepover. He’d missed watching Harry be a parent. It wasn’t as though Draco had forgotten, but the most he’d seen of the two of them together in the past three years had been the odd occasion they got the timing wrong when they swapped over at Andromeda’s. Draco really should stop by and see her, he’d just been so busy.
It was safe to say Draco’s world got a little bit crazy after his stay in that holding cell. Outwardly, it didn’t appear that anything had changed at all. There was no word from the Ministry about Potter, or his supposed involvement, although Draco had received no apology either, and he was just starting to relax about the situation a whole two months later.
“Don’t come then,” Lyra snapped. “If it was a shapeshifter,” she said the word with notable distain, “it would have attacked one of us by now. If Harry’s right and none of this is real, what exactly do we have to lose?” She sat with perfect posture, but Harry knew her well enough by now to know that she was terrified. Her eyes couldn’t settle anywhere, and she hadn’t done anything to fix her hair which she was usually so particular about.
‘Look Daddy! Asphodel!’ Teddy ran over to a group of lilies and started examining them carefully. He got a few strange looks from people whom Draco presumed were muggles, since they didn’t appear to be accustomed to eleven year olds knowing the appropriate name for the flowers. ‘You can use these in Wiggenweld and Draught of the Living Death! But I’m not old enough to learn those yet…’ He was babbling away excitedly, and Draco felt a rush of pride that he seemed to have developed such a passion so early. He wouldn’t put pressure on him of course, but if he put as much work in as he did enthusiasm, he could go far.
‘I see,’ said Smith, ‘and that is your primary concern? What about yourself? Would Harry want you to sit in silence or would he want you to get better?’ Draco was starting to feel cornered.
A man in a giant red suit flying through the sky to deliver gifts to every believing child in the world? Impossible. Even more ludicrous that one company could single-handedly change the image of such a figure just through the sheer power of advertising. Everyone knows green is better than red.
‘Do you mind not disrupting my work for no good reason, Potter.’ Draco snapped. He was in a foul mood. He’d been over the moon yesterday when he’d officially signed a lease for an apartment just south of Paris starting in November. However, that excitement was short lived when he realised that on Thursday his little wolf would be going to Hogwarts for the first time. Draco finally understood why his own mother had wept for days before Draco’s first year. He felt like a little piece of his heart was leaving with Teddy.
“It did something at least. Are you ready?” She stepped in front of him and suddenly he felt terrified. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Granger, except… well, he didn’t trust her at all. The wild notion entered his head that this whole thing could have been an elaborate hoax to lure him into the Ministry, breaking his house arrest, just so she could see him locked up. It would be the ultimate revenge. Granger wouldn’t be that vindictive… would she?
