She paused long enough to fluidly plunge the blade she held into his left forearm. “The guard is responsible for stopping the blade form eating a hole straight through your body.” She revealed the base and guard of another blade and lovingly caressed them within Ronald’s line of sight. “See these ruins? They are responsible for holding the entire weapon together without any of the individual magic’s attacking the others. Each ruin contains nearly 300 perfect tiny emeralds and each blade has six ruins on them. The guards are formed from the shoulder bone of the Lord Stallion of a Thestral herd. It just happens to be the only substance strong enough to balance the rest of the materials.”
“I know I didn’t need the wand anymore, Thanis.” Harry seemed to have forgotten the people around him. “That isn’t the point. The point is that the old goat snapped MY WAND in front of them. And the broomstick …” Harry stopped talking, but flames started burning in his hair. “He gave it to Dudley, Thanis.”
“I have room in my class on Friday afternoons, Severus,” Filious squeaked, giggling slightly when all four people in the discussion jumped. “I have my NEWT class after my sixth years on Fridays and he can do the same in my class as he does in Minerva’s.”
“If you hadn’t said so, we never would have guessed,” Neville laughed, wincing at the elbow in the ribs he got from Blaise as Luna hugged first Vincent than Millicent.
Tobias smiled a small smile. “Of course I’ll do it. I’ll need something to do so I don’t complete the library in two days. But … how does this help with nightmares?”
“How is it my fault?’ Draco asked laughter in his eyes and voice.
Those students that could tear their eyes away from the tables and look up gasped. The ceiling had a clear view of the night sky, making those that enjoyed astronomy itch to start mapping. The only light came from tiny fae-folk that flew through the space between tables and ceiling, or rested on the leaves of the ivy plants. Those close to Tobias and Draco focussed their attention on the Headmaster, who was silently fuming in his seat.
With a sharp bite to Draco’s neck, Harry pulled back and inserted the liquid filled tubes one at a time, grinning as each container crumpled to release its precious content.
A malicious grin crossed his face. “I suggest using the curse we were discussing last night with the charm Flitwick taught us first this year.”
“I never have, and never will need Occulmancy training, nonos. I have a natural shield around my mind. It took three years of mind manipulation potions hidden in his gods-forsaken lemon drops, tea and in every liquid I drank, including the healing potions, for him to be able to put a crack into my shield. Then he got the idea for someone I trusted to do it for him.” He looked pointedly at Remus, whose face was full of shock and anger. He looked back at Severus.
“You may come in now,” he stated. “We have concluded our business.”
Draco chuckled as his attacker left him to catch the next person to slide down the passageway. Draco smiled as more people joined them. It was good that they came down when they did – he didn’t know how much longer he’d be able to keep himself away from his intended. Noting the looks he was getting from Remus and Severus, he could tell that they knew his thoughts and that they agreed on the matter.
Skoteinos – Dark
Harry glared at her, then at the hands that she and Ron had placed on his arms to prevent him from moving. “Kindly remove your hands from my arms, Miss Granger. Mr Weasley. They are unwanted,” he stated coolly. “Both of you forwent the privilege of being on friendly terms with myself the second you agreed to making the bands.”
He growled possessively when Draco let out a frustrate sob as he started playing with the chain attached to the plug. With another growl he allowed the ropes to unravel and in one smooth move, he tore the plug from its seat and thrust his cock into its place. He thrust in hard another few times, smirking each time his moment caused his Pet’s breath to hitch.
Tobias looked at Lucius on the ground and started to laugh himself, before casting a calming charm on the older blonde. By this time Severus had made his way down to them with a calming draft, just in case.
She nodded and then fled. He smirked and returned to his task with a spring in his step.
A thin man bowed shallowly from his spot on the Dias, looking out of place in his expensive – but definitely muggle – three-piece suit, tie and glaringly brilliant shirt and shoes.” And Zleva Williams.”
“Let us help you to where you need to go,” another voice stated.
“Pontikos, who gave you the stupid pills this morning?” he finally asked. “Are you or are you not the scholar of this group?”
To no one’s surprise but Achalendra’s, everyone responded in the positive except for one of his daughters.
Theo snorted n answer, making Pansy grin wider.
I don't know whether this is my favourite written chapter or if it is the one I hate the most. I put poor Sev through HELL here. I cry every time I read it. :'(
“Do you honestly think that Kyria would let me be unprepared?” he asked with a grin. “Especially since this poor excuse of a living creature threatened her Alpha and her Alpha’s cub?”
“Along with not telling the rest of our family – not that it was difficult,” Fred took over once more. “Most of the prank items are actually the failed attempts at creating the stuff we had been asked to create.”
That was how R’thir and Ruen found the two of them when they arrived with dessert. They cleaned up silently and let the two of them sleep in the comfort of each other’s arms.
“But what about that time when I was eight and chained up in the backyard?” Tobias asked in confusion. Everyone’s eyes turned ice cold.
Hope you enjoy it :3
Tobias moaned softly and hesitantly raised his head. “Promise?”
Draco looked at his intended, eyes of molten silver gleaming like mercury locked onto deep emerald pools. “Yes,” he whispered.
Like a flower blooming
“Is this acceptable to the family of the bride in question?”
“Go talk to Pateras!” Tobias snapped. “I’m trying to do something that most people take for granted!”
“Not everyone,” Tobias stated from the comfortable chair he was in. “It turns out that my colleague in this event gave one of his subordinates too much credit in believing she would read the information he have to her. If it was one of my Pack, I would tell you to continue since it was their own fault however, as the witch in question is not my responsibility, I will allow Lord Patil to decide.”
Wordlessly Draco opened his arms and just like the night before, Tobias let Draco comfort him. The Pack, knowing how important this moment was, watched as their Alpha was comforted by his Beta.
As one, The Pack rose and went to great their Pack-sisters. Everyone watched in shock as the two girls were swallowed by the crowd and nuzzled by every person. Severus blinked in surprise. He had no idea how it had happened, but the young ones had honestly formed a pack. He was just starting to think about if their animagus forms had anything to do with it when an unmistakable voice sounded.
“You do realize that that is the jumpsuit of a dead muggle singer, don’t you?” he asked.
“Whose orders?”
Algie turned green at the thought while Draco swirled his spoon through his soup, suddenly feeling much less hungry than he was before.
“Are you suggesting what I think you are suggesting Mr Malfoy-Black?”
“Yes, Drakontas. I’m just not impressed with who you are partnered with,” he sighed. “At least she is better than Granger or Weasley – but if she touches you in any way, I’ll feed her to Hagrid’s newest obsession.”
“Youse called for Blintzy?” the small elf asked timidly.
Tobias screamed his release moments before Draco howled his. Once Draco had recovered, he pulled out and pushed a small magical vibrator in the empty hole. Tobias squeaked and glared at Draco in reproach when he untied him.
Ron stared to scream the second the feminine voice started to sing, ignoring his pleas for mercy and ghostly hands reacted out and starred pulling various quantities of gold and silver from the structure above him. He squeezed his eyes tight as he felt everything slowly start to inch down the ravine. The river was so close he could see the bottom from his vantage point.
Breathing deeply, Harry opened the door and stepped confidently inside before bowing deeply at the elder man’s feet.
As in the last chapter, I would appreciate it if the Greek translations are incorrect that I am told since I am dependent on internet translation sites and they do have a habit of being wrong at times :3
“Lastly, in the event that something is found that is neither safe enough to remain in the school or has no reason to be in the school in the first place and belongs to no one – as in it has been removed from its true owners care, we are willing to have it cleaned by a house-elf before having one of the Gringotts employees deliver it to you for valuing and selling. Profits will be split sixty-forty in favour of Hogwarts with the money going back into the Hogwarts vaults.”
“We had already done them,” George said with a shrug. “NEWTs as well. We did them at the Ministry over the winter holidays. It was a clause to our contract with the Ministry.”
To the relief of everyone, the couple didn’t overly spoil the cubs unless it was an important occasion and as they grew they discovered that it was far more rewarding to get a smile, pat on the head or warming hug with a softly spoken word of encouragement, congratulations or declaration of love than obtaining all the material goods in the world. It was something that had Lucius pouting over and Narcissa proud of when they were told by a four year old Melody that her mama’s gift had been better than theirs.
“Tobias disagrees. He called it payback for you keeping him from jumping me last night.”
“Bi … What?”
“It’s no use doing that Alby-Bus,” Tobias sang out, watching with relief as the stranger who had vanished re-appeared with Draco who, while a bit unsteady, was moving on his own. “Only males who use the potion get cut open to give birth. There is no wound for you to re-open and since you openly attacked ME after taking on the visage of MY bonded, harmed one of MY PACK and threatened MY DAUGHTER in front of all these witnesses, then THIS,” Tobias curled tighter around the leg that was holding him down and grabbed just under the old man’s knee, “is self-defence.”
“And if I miss my guess,” Draco drawled scarily like his father, “Then it isn’t even signed by the Minister or Madam Bones.”
“He asked if when the bands are off, if he’ll be able to eat without throwing up.”  He looked at Lucius and noticed his paler than normal complexion. He nodded slowly.  “I believe he’s been hit with that curse.”
“He said that as long as it doesn’t kill me it is permissible, and then went on to say not to bother wasting food on me, just water me once a day. He also mentioned that if at any time any of them realised what a fine looking specimen I was and wanted it, they could have it with nothing to fear from either wizarding or muggle authorities, as I was going to die before I said anything.” He slowly brought his eyes down to lock his green eyes with Voldemort’s red ones.
“Don’t you have jobs to do?” she scowled at them, only to blink stupidly when a manicured masculine hand holding a dark blue vial appeared in her line of sight.
By the time Draco was finished the song, Harry had calmed considerably and was snuggled into his chest.  “Now Love, why don’t you explain to me what got you so upset?”
“He did it then?”
“Falling asleep are we?” Draco chuckled as he finally took note of Tobias’ behaviour.
Chapter 29
“Good Lord man!” Amelia exclaimed as she flicked through the results. “Just how many times have you been hit with the cruciatus curse?”
“SILENCE!” she snapped, surprising herself when the noise level dropped. “It has come to my attention that, like in my time in this school, it is NOT the house of Slytherin that is problematic.”
Hermione glared over at the other side of the room, hatred in her every movement. She had admitted her mistake but apparently that was good enough. She was being victimised and no one would do anything to help her. Her fellow students pretended the area she was in as though it was invisible. Her professors look at her with pity or annoyance – mostly annoyance now that they know she is fighting against being someone’s property. The Headmaster was ignoring her and her own parents were fraternizing with the person who was responsible for all of this happening to her.
“I am sick of needing to watch both my actions and my words while around people. Just because I am pregnant does not mean that I am a fucking pansy! I am hormonal yes, but that doesn’t mean that I am delicate like you told the lady watching us for our exam – yes I heard that. And while I’m on the subject of exams, how DARE you tell every instructor there that they needed to ensure that there is at least half a metre distance between Draco and me at all times! You are lucky that Fudge had already told the instructors that under NO circumstances were Draco and I to be separated while in those rooms unless absolutely necessary. Yes, I woke up that morning with Draco’s prick up my arse –“
The Pack watched horrified as one of their members gorged himself on the food before him with no regard for his usual eating manners.
Tobias sighed as he lowered his quill for the last time. He had finally completed all eighteen of his exams. The DADA ministry official had decided that he could sit the practical – as long as certain precautions had been obtained first. And here he was, waiting for Neville and Vincent to put down their quills so they could hand in their last exam together.
Neville and Luna nodded in respect to the potions master and settled onto the floor in front of their Lord’s chair. The meeting started and ended with no other interruptions.
‘My chance of becoming one of the best lawyers in the magical world has become better since I signed,’ she thought as she looked around the close knit group. ‘Without these people I would have seen only half the picture, never realising that there is a difference between dark and evil and never knowing that light doesn’t necessarily mean that they are good.’
Blintzy – Prounounced Blin-Zee
Neville stretched in the hope of relaxing the muscles in his back. He, Pansy, Blaise and Theodore had been in the Longbottom Manor Library since an hour after the evening meal. It was now just after eleven. He swore softly under his breath at the ache that now started to pound. They had been working non-stop since just after 6:30. Hissing slightly in pain, he tried to stand and failed.
“How could you put that anywhere near your mouth?” Lucius hissed in disgust.
Severus rolled his eyes and waved his wand to remove the mess.  Harry looked up and glared at the man in the doorway.
Please accept,
Lucius laughed nervously and removed the faked laws from his pocket, along with the laws currently in circulation. “Then let us do this son. I do not wish to remain in the same room as her for longer than necessary.”
“Well,” Draco announced, sounding neutral, though his eyes shone with laughter. “It seems this year, at least, is going to be interesting.”
It was Lucius and Severus’ turn to laugh. Harry just smiled.
“If you say so. How are you? Goyle really laid into you. I did try to get him and Crabbe to leave you alone. I just think that it takes Goyle longer to learn.”
Ten minutes later, Tobias removed himself from the Potions Master’s side, his face bright red. “Sorry Nonos,” he murmured. “I don’t know what got into me. I’ve never reacted like that before.” He looked at his father in confusion. “And what is he doing?”
“We will continue,” Achalendra stated, making both his daughters look at him in shock; Padma due to her Father doing the right thing and the opposite of what their mother would do and Pavarti because she had expected for the information to be given to her once again.
I feel my soul unfolding
Draco blinked himself out of his thoughts and smiled at the photo his eyes had moved to. He and Tobias were in their early sixties and looked to be in their mid-thirties. In front of Tobias was Melody, smiling alternatively between her parents and the camera. Beside her and in the gap between the chairs holding the two oldest members knelt a delicately built young man with a slightly rounding stomach who was identical to Draco except for his hands, his hair and his temperament. This was Remi; their youngest and the picture had been taken two months before he had birthed his first born.
“Severus, may I have a word?” he called before he could stop himself. He watched as Severus muttered something under his breath that he missed and was relieved when the younger man sat in the chair facing his own.
“Family meal?” Asked Neville.
“I overheard him and Dumbledore talking about it the following day.”
Tobias heard the sharp intake of breath from Severus. He continued as if he had heard nothing. “When ordered to kill them, their friends refused and were tortured into insanity. These were Frank and Alice Longbottom. The person responsible for the death and torture is going to pay – but first I need to be able to get to him.”
Harry stifled a sobbing laugh. “That has to be the only good thing about it. I’d better let you sleep. You must be exhausted.”
Tobias listened to the adults talk around him. Before they had entered the room, he had indicated to all the Weasleys and Draco that he wished to speak to them after this. They had all nodded their understanding and agreement.
The two snuggled together and fell into a deep, peaceful slumber.
“Dobby,” he called, even as he watched Neville’s progress.
“What do you find so funny son?” she whispered, catching her husband’s attention, as well as that of an irritated werewolf.
The man, now positively identified as Voldemort – hissed at the boy.
Hermione pulled her wand up and aimed it at Tobias’ retreating back, shouting, “Trarre attacco di sangue.”
“I just thought you had your own pet Ravenclaw to do the work for you, Arpakitiko.” Laughter rang through the common room for true.
“You are supposed to be asleep Alpha,” Pansy scowled.
“It’s good to see you back Severus,” Minerva smiled slightly.
“Father! How’d you feel about Grandchildren?”
“Change it to be a courting contract or changing the identity of one or both participants.”
She moaned softly as she moved her head to look at the stranger who had appeared in the entrance of the room she was in. Before she could react, a pale grey light hit her and a soothing coolness gently trickled into her skull, completely eradicating her headache.
“Hi Sev,” Tobias murmured as he searched through the organised chaos before him. “I’m organising the report for tonight’s meeting. No one in my Pack is going to be unprepared for tonight’s meeting. They are not the battle baits that generally report to Pateras and I will lock them in a room full of Dumbledore supports before they sound like them.”
“I swear it on my life, milord.”
“This is Discord. When we return to Hogwarts, she will be protection against physical attacks. Her nest mate, Chaos, will stay with me.” As he spoke, a black and yellow serpent’s tail waved from Tobias’ sleave.
“He was my Father’s best friend,” Lucius stated. “He was given the position of Uncle in my life and before he went insane, he was a stand-in Grandfather to Draco. Everyone joined knows everyone else’s reasons for joining but I am not going to tell their stories. I told mine because Wu needed a reason to do his Merlin-cursed job!”
As the class left, he caught Tobias’ eye. Did he just wink? Severus shook his head and struggled to calm down. He looked up to find Tobias standing in front of him.
“You’re eyes are dull, your skin is slack and slightly yellow. You have the look of someone who is addicted to Dreamless Sleep – and I know that you are, hence the fact that I am not giving any to you. Everyone in your pack is here for you, Bi. Just like we are. We are your family. We want to take care of you – Please let us. Tell me why you are having trouble sleeping so I can help.”
Blaise nodded with a small smile on his face. “Thank you Alpha. I do know that, but I still stand by my decision. If I should be disowned, I will be bonded to The Pack.” He looked up at the castle now looming about them. “I spent the majority of my life being terrified of being disowned. Now, however,” he shrugged, “Something in me wants them to disown me. In fact, I hope they do – this is my family right here. I don’t need anything else.”
“Or you can go down to your rooms, where you will find your Father waiting to talk to you about a letter he received from one of your pack members. While you talk with him, you will eat and after that you will either nap or sleep. Only after that will you deal with the report and talk with Miss Lovegood.”
Seeing that Draco wasn’t going to listen to reason, Severus walked to the room with a huff, only to stop at the sound of desperate sobbing. Swallowing hard, he pushed open the door, entered and closed it behind him.
A soft breath of air sent the minute amount of powdered bacterial matter into his victim’s face, where it was absorbed into his body through the damp tissue of this eyes, nose, ears and mouth.
“Nonos?” a sleep-laced voiced muttered, a slight amount of pain evident in his tone. “I need my potion. I haven’t had todays and it hurts!”
Tobias pouted. “H-how long?” he yawned. “How long will this last?”
Suppose the man should fall asleep?
Severus nodded and led him into the room. Reaching Voldemort, they bowed in unison, as if they had rehearsed it. In silence, Lucius stepped forward and rolled Harry’s left sleave to his elbow.
Draco clutched his husband closer to him as Tom backed up as far away from the couple as he could.
Dearest Drakontas
The others in the room laughed at her while internally, they all privately agreed.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think I’m falling for him, Sev. I have fallen for him. I just want to know when it happened.”
“Very nice my Dear,” he said after a while. “Now how about you eat it so our little one will grow strong inside his mummy.” Draco said softly. To everyone’s surprise Tobias nuzzled into Draco’s neck before starting on his meal.
“Of course I love the two of you. You’re my family,” he said calmly. “I was just wondering what I did wrong to have the both of you hyperactive at the same time.”
“Will need ya ‘elp fellas,” he said. “Lawd Mowfoi’s go ‘nover critter fer us. Jus’ need t’ wait fer ‘em t’ finish wiv ‘er.”
The first confrontation of only the gods know how many
Harry chuckled darkly as his hand firmly squeezed the bulged base of Draco’s cock and harshly bit Draco’s earlobe, making Draco unable to breath. “Dance for me slut. Prove to me that you are worth my time.”
“Molly loves the insipid things – why we can’t tell you.”
Tobias raised a hand and his father closed his mouth, giggling slightly. Digging around in a pouch on his hip, Tobias called for a house-elf. “I need one of the small vials from nonos rooms and hurry up about it!” He then started pulling vials of liquid from various pockets in the pouch.
“Trust me ‘Bi,” Draco whispered.
Luna beamed at the girl and grabbed her hand, pulling her from the bench. “Come on! We have to tell Alpha the good news!”
“Of course they are …. But then again they were a gift from Luna.”
They watched in silence as his eyes rolled into the back of his skull and collapsed. Lucius and Severus waited for Tobias to leave, then both grabbed for the book. After reading it, they looked at each other and sat on their chairs, thinking it might be safer to let their Lord wake up naturally.
The woman smiled softly. “We shall not be long,” she said as she and the three males with her vanished into the room behind Narcissa.
“I guess you are just lucky,” Remus stated, trying to hold in his own laughter at watching the two men snuggling into his lover.
“You are most welcome, Severus Snape,” she muttered before preparing for the next staff member to enter her little make-shift clinic.
His thoughts then turned to the male that was missing. When the girls had left, Draco had pushed everyone out of their chamber and locked them out – including him. He wanted to be angry with him – or upset at the least – but he was too comfortable to care much and before he knew it, he was fast asleep.
Ginny and Luna smacked Theo across the back of the head.
“Bi? Do you think you could sit on the seat next to me for a few minutes?” he asked softly.
Neville smiled shyly. “I understand. As twins you don’t feel completely whole without having some contact with the other.” He turned to the Minister and became even shyer. “Is there any way for them to be together, Sir? It can’t be too much trouble to arrange.”
Draco felt his heart start racing as his intended pulled the ceremonial silver dagger of the Black family from his robes. Lowering his head, Tobias raised both hands and slashed his palm, letting the blood from the wound splatter onto the main portrait.
Both girls slowly lowered their heads in both disappointment and submission.
“I think, Neogennito that the amount of hatred and magic you placed into that vow you made your father is what is making you react like this. At least until you start to act upon it. Do you know how you are going to destroy them yet?”
“Tobias is going to be fine. He isn’t supposed to shift while in his condition. It isn’t harmful to the babe since he doesn’t shift into a smaller form, but the amount of magic it takes is more than he can comfortably stand. To all extents and purposes, he is only drained magically. It’s enough to make him exhausted and to feel uncomfortable, but not life threatening to either him or the child.”
“Mr Malfoy-Black,” the man stated calmly. “I’m Healer Daniel Black – muggleborn so no relation.”
“Are all students who need to be here h present?” the stern woman asked.
Together the two boys left to prepare for their night.
The following morning when Tobias and Draco entered the Great Hall for breakfast, they laughed when they saw nine eager pack-mates, a bright-eyed potions professor and a slightly amused Remus – who was apparently there to give Dumbledore a report. Laughing, the two boys sat at the table to eat.
With another growl, Harry pulled his fingers from his Pet and positioned him back on his stomach. He attached a shorter chain to the rings in his Pet’s nipples before striding back to the head of the desk and thrusting into Draco’s mouth while shoving three fingers into his arse.
“How is Luna?” Tobias asked when he caught sight of the sleeping girl on Vince’s lap.
“What is your guardian today, ‘Bi?” Draco asked softly. Almost instantly a raven Black Panther with blue/white eyes was giving Draco a cat’s smile, then she was gone, leaving behind a sleepily smiling Tobias.
Tobias glared at the man, who paled slightly and gulped. “We need to leave because what we will release when we join will be strong enough to blow up the wards here, at Hogwarts and the Ministry with no resistance to speak of. Just what we did this morning when we woke nearly blew the wards, and that was nothing compared to what will happen tonight!”
Draco hugged him. “Come on Bi. It’s almost time to go home for our family get together. Mother and Father are expecting all of us to be there for Tea, and she will not be happy if anyone doesn’t turn up on time.”
“The reason was different to what I thought it would be. It turned out the Headmaster convinced Mr Weasley and Miss Granger to aid him in controlling Harry Potter. She gave me the full list of curses the three of them threw at him. She also told me that while he was in a drug-induced sleep, they proceeded to put bondage bands on his person.”
Meetings, meeting and more meetings.
Remus yelped when he heard Tobias’ voice behind him. Transfiguring robes for both him and Severus they both left red with embarrassment. Tobias laughed softly before leading his pack to the rooms they would be staying in for the weekend so they could all prepare for the evening meal.
A fifth year prefect from Ravenclaw stood as the transfiguration professor sat. “Remember you can also ask people in higher years and other houses for help if you are unable to – or are unwilling to – ask a teacher.”
Dumbledore sat back, slightly scared. “I’ll not start on Severus,” he mumbled to himself, moving towards the door. “I’d best start with the Slytherin’s themselves.” He left, leaving the room in a buzz of conversation as the portraits spoke about that odd meeting.
“Tobias, this is Grapplehook, my brother. Brother, this is the Little Lord I am currently working with.”
Draco chuckled softly. “No, we aren’t on a stage and our audience is leaving.” He shot them a warning look. “They were here because Father couldn’t handle seeing us in this rather lovely position.”
“The fat lump leaned it against the wall and stood on it. Then he urinated on the pieces.” Harry started to shake. “I can’t control it, Thanis. I’ve tasted blood and I want more! I need more! I need to hunt – to kill. To feel hot blood flood my throat.” Harry’s eyes flared A.K green, scaring everyone and making Thanatos squawk and vanish.
Harry stepped out of the lab, sore, hot and smiling. He’d managed to make the potion he had been set with only a small number of incidences, which he suspected were deliberately set by his Professor to test what his reactions would be. Overall, Harry felt as if he’d done a good job. Now he was to shower and dress for lunch and his visit with his Lord.
Running through the Manor to find what was wrong, they stopped outside the rooms Tobias and Draco were sharing. Opening the door, Remus paled at what he found. Yelling out to Severus to find The Pack and Draco, he hurried to do what he could for his godson, the Dark Lord on his heels.
“Why did it take so long for someone to tell us?” Pomona asked, horrified. “It is bad enough that children from differing houses snipe and snap at each other, but for students to gang up on one student from their own house is deplorable.”
Bill and Charlie nodded. “We wouldn’t miss it for the world. It’s an emergency after all.”
Epikindynos - Dangerous
Severus smirked. “Yes Lucius. He always awakens before dawn. How is the question, but he always does without fail – unless he is in the hospital wing, that is. Even with a double dose of dreamless sleep he wakes up. It is irritating to say the least.”
Three minutes later, she was shaken from her thoughts when two multi-coloured owls dropped a package and letter before Tobias. She smiled as she remembered the last thing she wanted to say and she started to write it down. She had just signed and sealed her letter when Tobias finished reading the letter and started to open the package
“What else?” Minerva asked, not at all surprised.
“The stuff you are eating is muesli, yoghurt and a mix of mango, papaya and passionfruit. Draco said he will join you in the torture and killing of your two ex-sidekicks. The thought of Weasley in my class is very frightening indeed, as is the thought of a pregnant Miss Granger. Also, the Dark Lord wishes to see you after lunch today.”
“So what are we doing?” Ginny asked.
“SHIT! He’s going into psychological and metaphysical shock!” Severus yelled, before running to Harry’s side.
“I AM THINKING OF OUR BABY YOU OVER GROWN BLONDE FLUFFBALL! THIS IS THE PIECE OF HIPPOGRIPH SHIT THAT USED A BLOOD QUILL ON FIRST YEARS FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS!”
“Do not take that tone with me, Youngster. I know what is best for you!”
Wealth beyond computing
The sound of his husband screaming his name in pleasure, combined with the tightly clenched and pulsing passage, pulled Draco’s orgasm from him in only two extra thrusts.
“Yes, we males run the bank and interact with clients while our women folk work in more important positions.”
Draco jokingly suggested letting one of them piss him off and then let his guardian of the day to deal with the two of them. No one laughed for long when Tobias pointed out that today’s guardian was not only a reptile, but also the king of the serpents itself. Since then, everyone made sure not to give Tobias too much grief. After all, nobody wanted to come face-to-face with a basilisk with Tobias’ temper.
“How was I supposed to know the Brats were bonded?” she shrieked, not noticing an enraged Narcissa or a glaring Algernon standing behind her. “For all I knew the damn kids decided to have a bit of fun and ended up in this predicament. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been called to a job involving a slut wanting the child killed or sold off for money.”
“Bill is by far the easiest Weasley to talk to, and I know I can go to him about anything that I am unsure of – just like an older brother. I can take any problems, or rituals I discover to him and ask him about them and not be terrified out of my wits if I don’t understand him the first time – particularly anything to do with Wizarding customs.”
Tobias chuckled and read it out to Draco, who was pouring drinks for them both, before downing his potion. Helping himself to a bun, Tobias had to admit that the previous night and that morning had been the best idea he’d ever had.
It seems like yesterday when I said I do
Draco felt the hands tangle into his hair and smirked to himself before biting down on the flesh beneath his lips. He untangled the hands from his hair and removed himself from the dais, leaving a whimpering Tobias there.
Draco broke the kiss, reaching for the robes that were hiding his husband’s flesh, only to have Tobias catch his hand.
“Build it up with wood and clay,
Severus struggled to look sternly at the teen. “A pre-lunch nibble then. It was not a suggestion. I believe your elf bought you a special herbed drink from the centaurs ...’ he smirked at the back of his godson’s head as he followed him from the room. He’d thought that would work.
Ten minutes later, Severus and Remus followed Tobias back into the room. No one missed the fact that the two of them were touching. Draco smiled as the two of them sat together. He smiled wider when Tobias sat beside him and started eating with relish. The crowd around them were gob-smacked when Draco stole a bloody piece of meat from Tobias’ plate and ate it. There was silence when Tobias softly licked away the juices left on Draco’s fingers and lips. Tobias smiled and snuggled into Draco’s chest and whispered something. Draco whispered back, before nodding. The two of them stood.
The fire behind Tom flared and Severus paled as Minerva McGonagall’s voice filled the room.
Draco grinned. “No, but where would the world be going if I called you ‘Harry’?”
Now all he had to do was wait. He would no longer have a spy in Voldemort’s ranks, but it would be worth it if he could get that blasted pain-in-the-arse child back under his control. Laughing to himself, he popped another sherbet lemon into his mouth, not paying any attention to the horror-stricken and sickened faced of the Headmaster portraits around him. It wasn’t as if they could do anything about it.
“You have given us nothing to disprove your belief of this,” George said, moving to stand alongside his brother. “Your bedside manner is deplorable; your skill with assuring worried family members is worse and your knowledge and skills are non-existent.”
Just as they planned, Tobias fought against leaving before any other people with young children left. AS the last child vanished, the door of the building slammed open to reveal a tall, skeletally thin, pure white man with a snake-like appearance. Everything, including time, seemed to stop.
The sixth year students shivered, remembering the ending of Tobias’ marking, earning them curious looks. Tobias smirked, taking off his robe, leaving him in a muscle top. He placed his hand over his ‘tattoo’ and placed it back into its normal position, causing everyone who wasn’t in the sixth year to gasp in realisation.
Severus paled slightly. “Draco’s also being affected?”
“What the bloody hell are you talking about Draco? Tobias is badly injured and you are acting like you couldn’t care less!” Blaise glared at him.
My Fair Lady.”
“And tell him we will bring him back after he wakes and has something to eat.”
Albus Dumbledore was not in a good mood. The past three weeks had been good. Harry (and he is Harry damn it, not whatever it is the brat was calling himself this week) and Severus weren’t talking and he hadn’t needed to do anything to cause it. Then, at breakfast this morning, the bastard of a child had to go and ruin it all by hugging the man! Now the two of them were closer than before. To make matters even worse, he had received a letter from the Ministry stating that he was to expect the officials who were going to be investigating him in the following three days. Every name on the list was against him becoming the Headmaster of the school for some reason or another and all wold jump at the chance to evict him from his rightful place. He growled in irritation: The day had started off in such a wonderful way as well.
They were rewarded by the sight of Minerva’s lips thinning in irritation. Tobias smirked in triumph. It was working just as he planned; No one had noticed the Weasley switch.
The next morning dawned bright and early, much to the annoyance of the students of the school seated in the Hall. The noise was deafening to the groggy, temperamental Tobias who had decided that the only seat comfortable enough was the one his husband was on. Draco just looked at the man on his lap and started on his breakfast to the best of his ability.
Madam Deloris Umbridge
“Why…”
The other paused and thought for a moment. “There’s only one way to find out. Draco, is there an adult in the castle that you trust explicitly?” Draco nodded. “Then can you bring them here so we can talk?”
Tobias smiled and took a sip of the water. “Then I shall enjoy it.”
“That was until Ginny stepped in. She got them to leave him alone long enough to spend three hours a day without them so he could talk to us. It was brilliant!”
The black-haired boy moaned softly at the thought of his words coming true and received an answering moan from his companion. “I know we discussed our hopes for our first time together, but you know we need to consummate our bonding at midnight.” He smiled softly. “I spoke with The Mother about it. She said that when it was midnight, the time in the Garden would stop as it senses what is going to occur this night. Do you know what that means, my Lover?” He stopped to slowly pull his very agreeable husband closer to the trunk of the Willow.
My fair lady.”
“Sure, do you know how to use it?”
She chuckled softly. “Of course not ... May I have your name?”
“I do Father. I mean every word of it. Zabini’s stand by their family and I have learnt more about family in the short time I have been in The Pack than I have from the Zabini family. A real family accepts a person for who they are, not for how well they can keep secrets or lie to people of authority. Family is there to support you, even if they know you were the one in the wrong. Family is more important than anything. You may want for me to conceal what occurred between Grandmother and Alpha, but Alpha is just that – My Alpha.”
The four adults watched the two until they fell asleep once more. Severus covered them with a blanket, a small smile on his face. When he turned to the others, his smile disappeared when he met the raised eyebrow and crossed arms of the Patil family patriarch.
Tobias stole another piece of carrot and nibbled on it, deep in thought. “I want this done because when this school was first created, there were classes in each room. Over time, many of the classes were dropped due to many things. It is a natural part of life, but since Dumbledore has been at the school, some of the more integral lessons have been cancelled and/or banned. It has also come to my attention that Dumbles is using the abandoned classrooms to hide magical artefacts – many of which do not have any business being anywhere near children, let alone actually in a school full of them.”
“Mmm ... Bi ...” Draco whimpers in his sleep.
Harry, now Tobias, is reunited with his new family for a few days for the marking ceremony of new recruits. Does Draco need to show his support for the House of Lions, or will he gain himself a slave for two weeks?
Blaise sauntered up to Tobias and reached into the container once more. “Draco.”
Draco gets some answers, Tobias shows how cheeky he can be and it is Luna and Ginny's turn to get a medical check up
“Allies?” she asked weakly.
Lucius nodded his confirmation. “Only one left was the original one set the day the Manor was complete – and even that was reduced to about sixty-five percent.”
To the surprise of many people, both teens growled at the Malfoy Lord then vanished in a flash of flame. In the resultant silence, while many students and Professors stared at the two shirts left on the now empty seat, Severus Snape’s laughter echoed loudly.
Severus chuckled just as softly. “Just be sure to be out here within 30 minutes. Tobias cannot afford to miss any meals – particularly since you do your exams today.”
Tobias sneered, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring. “Well, I’m waiting.”
Dedicated to: My Luc! She knows who she is. Love you sis, Happy Birthday and don’t think that because I finally got this posted that you can get rid of the hand-written copy I made for you. I went through nearly eight copies before I got one I was happy with!
First had been Dumbledore’s death. Many people said that his death should have taken longer or been harsher than Tobias’ way, but Draco understood where his husband was coming from when he stated that he wanted to focus more on life – specifically the life of their daughter – rather than the old man’s death, so the most manipulative man in wizard history had a very peaceful ending of being sliced vertically in half by Tobias using a samurai-type sword that Kyria had designed – though the young woman had been very put out that the Dementor blood she had added into the melted metal before its crafting hadn’t had any effect on the victim.
Tobias sighed happily when Dobby presented him with his breakfast – which looked exactly the way he had ordered it. He ignored the disgusted looks he was getting from those who didn’t belong to his pack – who had become used to his strange cravings while trapped in the ministry room. He was surprised when Sally-Anne Perks, a sixth year Ravenclaw, stopped next to him to say good morning.
Harry instantly transformed back into his human self, his face still covered in blood and his green eyes glowed in his face. He was still growling.
“Enter.”
“What am I going to do with that boy of mine?” he asked with a moan while shaking his head.
Draco smiled at the sight that greeted him when he entered the Potions Master’s private rooms. Severus was seated on his favourite armchair – a pale green fabric thing that Draco believed would be more at home in a museum dedicated to the early ‘50s rather than in the sitting room of his normally fashionable godfather. In his left hand he held one of the books he’d been given for the yule-tide holiday – the one on warding – and in his right he held a cup of tea. On his lap sat the white and caramel cat that an eight-year old Draco had found and given to him for his birthday.
“I’ll be sure to pass it along to him then,” Amelia stated, eyes slightly wider at the organisation and preparation that had gone into the plans in such a short amount of time.
“This is the official copy,” he said with a chuckle. “That gets framed and put into an office or bedroom or hallway. The one being posted is for your portfolio.”
Tobias marked and closed the book he was reading and curled up on his seat, deep in thought. Thanatos, once again, started to preen his hair – something that calmed both of them enough to think clearly.
“Um … Bi …” Sal started. “I hate to say this but … You are pregnant and you did sleep for nearly eight days.”
He opened his eyes to see a little girl of around six staring at him holding a stick that was in the right position to poke someone with. Taking a breath, he scowled at the girl. “Don’t you know not to touch other people?”
Standing, both Tobias and Draco bowed to the two new comers. The elder of the two smiled and bowed back in the way of centaurs and hippogryphs.
“Draco? What?”
At Remus’ nod, Severus, Lucius and Draco exited the room.
“You may not have touched me or mine, but you didn’t do anything to prevent something that would be classified as murder.” Everyone bar Ginny and her neighbour flew into the air upside down. Tobias looked at the other two. “If you don’t get moving, you’ll be late for class. I’ll walk with you. Don’t worry about them – I’ll send someone for them.” As they left, Tobias whispered. “Meeting tonight – Follow me three minutes after I leave the Great Hall.”
“Strong?”
Pateras – Have read and agree. Need your signature – Gios.
“Headmaster. I’d like permission to make some changes to the library,” Madam Pince asked. “I’d like some more individual work spaces around the outer edge of the space and I’d like a few group tables in the centre of study groups. I’d also like permission to re-organise the shelving.”
“Why?” Tobias asked, slightly petulant. “If both I and the cub are fine, why should I do that?”
An unknown goblin walked into the room with a large covered tray that he placed on the desk between the three of them.
Quietly The Pack split into smaller groups before pulling out the plans they had been working on in their leader’s absence and reviewing them before the meeting where they would be revealed. If anyone had cared to look into the common room at all that night, that was what they would have seen.
Tobias chuckled softly through a wince, “Nice to meet you. Thanks for going for Draco.”
“Now, back to what we were talking about before the joker appeared. This is my Beta. You will treat him with respect as he is my equal. His name is Drakontas – Dragon.” Draco felt his cowl fly back to reveal his face.
Hermione nodded slowly.
“Yes?”
He gave a short bark of laughter. “The summer I made Vernon’s sister into a helium balloon was when I let the Dragon out to play – Rage and Protection, the rules of all Dragons.” He gave a half-smirk in Draco’s direction, causing the blonde youth to blush slightly. “There has been many times in my past that I was punished for ‘acting more like a freak than usual’.” He shook his head, thinking.
She was so deep in her pity party that she didn’t notice her guest until she was lying flat on her back, pinned to her mattress looking up into the darkly handsome face of Blaise Zabini.
Daniel chuckled as he helped the man uncurl his patient.
Vince, Greg and Millicent stretched. They had just finished an exercise routine with their weapon of choice. None of them spoke, but none of them needed to. Their Alpha and his Beta would be returning to Hogwarts where they would be under the eye of the most manipulative man to be in control of the school, and they would need protecting. It was their job to protect The Pack from physical attack, so their Alpha could focus on what was important. It was a job they took very seriously, and Merlin help those who received their wrath because by the time they were finished with them, not even Beelzebub himself would be able to make them suffer more.
“This is good. Can you please change back while I tell you my idea? It should work, but if it doesn’t, you should be able to sleep without nightmares for a while.”
He pulled a packet out of his pocket and was about to light them when Tobias caught the scent of them and panicked.
Even when they had split due to the prank, Sirius had played; Severus had never stopped signing it that way. This was the first time in nearly twenty three years that it was absent and it broke his heart knowing he was the cause of it. Taking a few moments to reflect on what he had done, the consequences and what he could do to fix it, he stood from his seat and quickly made his way to his room. It was time for him to do something he should have done twenty years ago and by Merlin, he would see this through even if it killed him.
“I want to spend this morning outside as a group, if possible,” Draco stated. “Bi has been spending far too much time inside lately. It may be a bit chilly, but it looks to be a good day for a picnic in the snow.”
“Alpha is sleeping – or he was before Epikindynos and Pontikos left. Beta is making sure he is okay and Professor Snape still believes that you are going to call off the engagement, but have plans to do it face-to-face rather than through a letter,” Luna stated loud enough for the adults to hear.
Tobias shook his head, slowly and silently.
“Do you think they are alright?” Ginny asked, turning so she could look at Luna’s face without hurting her neck or sitting up.
Amelia chuckled. “I understand,” she stated as she followed them into the soon-to-be full room.
Tom glanced at the man’s coal-like eyes then looked away in shame. “I know it doesn’t mean anything, but I’m sorry for my reaction. I should have remained impartial to the entire event. I know that now and I knew it then, but I didn’t and I am sorrier than you can imagine.”
Tobias exhaled heavily in relief as Algernon walked into the room with Draco right behind him.
~I would be honoured to meet your pack, Alpha.~
“I guess you asked him then,” Lucius chuckled.
“Really?” Draco asked with an almost envious look on his face. “It’s only been around three months though.”
“Who was it from Sev?” Tobias asked, subconsciously reheating the drink in the man’s hand enough for him to notice he had some left.
“Fred and Georg exchanged looks before shrugging. “Three hundred galleons, sixteen sickles and seven knuts.”
“What are you looking at?”
Tobias watched Severus with a frown on his face as the older man stared at the still sealed letter resting on the table before him.
The Pack members present started to laugh.
“I’ll do that Severus, Thank you. I’ll go see her after I finish here. You’d best get a decent night’s sleep – it’s going to be a long few days. We got word that the investigators will be here in only a few short days.”
Blaise nodded once firmly. “It is what I wish to happen. Unlike the other members of The Pack, I have never had the desire to father a child – and even though I enjoy sex, I don’t need to love my partner to be able to do it. Also, if I am disinherited, then I will have no name, no property, no money and no family history to give to any female that I might meet. I would rather be Blaise of The Pack than just Blaise.” He smirked at a thought. “And being bonded to The Pack won’t stop me from sleeping with females who aren’t of The Pack.”
Sorry for this peeps, but update day has been moved to Thursdays on my end because the day that I work has been changed. But hey, at least you are getting an update :D Also, next week will be a no update week. I have to go up to my cousin's to look after her and her daughter while she recovers from day surgery. She is allergic to the stuff they normally use to numb the area so they have to put her under. Until then, ENJOY!
Tobias waited for everyone to arrive at the Library with a deep calmness about him. He knew he’d done a good job at cleaning the opening area and with Thanatos beside him, he’d found the entrance to the Founder’s Rooms. He couldn’t wait to show his pack and family around the Chamber. He’d even left the rooms alone to explore them with The Pack.
‘I would say that you were just that unlucky, but you have to be one of the luckiest people alive,” she said to his questioning look. “The real reason is probably that the bad ones are more numerous because they didn’t need to work for their positions. I know that mother was trying her best to get the Healers re-assessed and those who got their position due to being related to someone who was high up the chain to be put on probation until they proved they got the job on their own merit.”
Long story short, Family were visiting and now I have a very messy house and am both mentally and physically exhausted as well as physically sore. This is basically just a filler chapter I'm afraid. I will announce that there have been several reviewers who want to see what they find in the castle. I have not written that into this story as it wasn't a main focus, just supposed to show that they didn't just pull the galleons to fix the castle out there rear ends. If I have enough people like the idea I will, on top of writing the one shot series to go along side this story, write a chaptered fic about Pansy, Ginny, Harry and the Gringotts team as they clean the castle, what they find and how the Goblins and general public react to some of the things they find. Tell me in a review if you would be interested in reading it or not.
“Food first.”
Ignoring the shocked looks of her sister, the Weasley twins, and Amelia, Padma focused on the approving looks being sent her way by her father, Tobias and the Goblins.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, speeding up until he could wrap his arms around his husband. “What happened?”
A laughing Tobias interrupted the men. “S-Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you all could do with a laugh. A first year pureblood Gryffindor student completed this test.”
“He goes by Albus Dumbledore – and he is the Headmaster of this school.”
“Yes, Neogennito.”
Chapter 2
Sixth years sit for their 'practice' tests >:D
“Just a moment, Draco,” he muttered as he added finely powdered basilisk bone to the simmering potion one pinch at a time. Draco watched with interest as the potion slowly lightened from the muddy brown it was originally to a colour that reminded one of a certain sandy-haired werewolf. “Now, what is troubling you, Draco?”
“You mean to tell me that somehow Albus Dumbledore managed to escape capture from the Aurors and they only just now decided to tell the rest of the Ministry?” Tom asked incredulously.
A flash of green light drew everyone’s attention to the now re-filled doorway. Standing just inside stood Harry, head bowed to ask a blessing. Straightening up, he walked to Severus, bowed and then hugged the older man.
“Naturally,” Lucius replied. ‘Have you got the equipment we need?”
Severus sipped at the scotch he had in his hand and looked around at the other men in the room.  They had all gathered in the sitting room after tea to ask Harry about his change of heart.
Fred had married – not bonded – Angelina Johnson after a six year relationship, only for her to leave him a year later when the glamour of being married to a man of success wore off to reveal that, even though he was successful, Fred was still the same person he was while at school. The thing that everyone in the know – including Fred himself – believed to be the breaking point in their relationship was Fred’s close relationship with The Pack.
Tobias shook his head, grinning. “Not the actual killing bit, no – but I can make their lives hell.”
Grapplefang nodded and handed the paperwork – a contract – to the young man, who handed it straight to Amelia.”
“What!” Draco’s voice made the three men jump.  Turning to look at him, they saw him hurry from the room.  Following him, they watched as he floo’d into Severus’ study.  Severus and Lucius looked at each other in confusion.
Algernon really was an expert in the field of male pregnancy and it showed in the depth of detail he went into to answer Draco's questions and in the language he had used. The truth of the matter was, however, that Draco had no idea what had been said, so he had returned to his and Tobias’ rooms in frustration. It was only luck that he had been interrupted from his thoughts by the Lord of Gryffindor.
Lucius moaned in horror and turned a pale green colour. “Please don’t give him ideas.”
“Tom, Lucius, Narcissa and Remus,” he eventually said. “They apologised for their treatment of me these past three weeks, but I don’t think I can forgive them – not yet at any rate.”
Severus and Lucius threw their heads back and roared with laughter. Tobias’ face fell and he sat, sighing. Thanatos appeared and sang softly, trying to relax his human. After he had settled onto his master’s shoulder Tobias indicated those around him to gather closer.
Tobias
“Thank you for the gift, Alpha.” Tobias had bought him a book describing the different bonds between people. It covered everything, including parent/child, husband/wife, husband/husband, wife/wife, friends, siblings and master/servant. Tobias nodded, accepting his thanks.
The doors of the Great Hall were slammed open. “Minerva! Weasley! Granger! Do not dare use magic on him, it could put him in St Mungo’s for the rest of the year! Mr Potter, if you don’t calm down, you will put yourself there. You didn’t even eat before running out of the hospital wing!”
Severus bowed slightly. “Madam Ravenclaw. The gentleman behind me is Mr Riddle – Tobias’ adopted father – and beside him is Mrs Greengrass Snr – his personal healer. They are here to see Tobias, with your permission.”
The flames connecting them faded and Harry vanished; leaving a laughing Voldemort and three stunned and awed Malfoys in the room with an amused Remus Lupin
“Don’t you love me anymore Sevie?” two pouty voices asked, causing the dark-haired man to groan inwardly. He was damned if he did and damned if he didn’t.
Someone cleared their throat and Draco jumped, scared out of his thoughts. Looking up, he smiled slightly at his father.
Tobias groaned and buried his face into Draco’s chest. Draco chuckled softly. “Come on Love, we have an hour til breakfast. You go have a shower and I’ll pack the bags, and then join you, okay?”
“Not everyone has the same type of blood,” a new voce said into the room, “and I’m not talking Pure-blood, muggle-born or half-blood either.”
Ginny put the parchment back on the table and allowed Luna to pull her from the tent. As Algernon rolled up the parchment to send it to the girl’s care-giver, he winced once again when the poison green words revealed themselves once again.
Tobias snorted. “No, reborn of eternal flame.” With that, he disappeared in a flare of sapphire and onyx flames.
Zleva Williams
It appeared that, due to the immense amounts of magic the boy had been exposed to due to the releasing of the bands on his person and coming into his inheritance before that, he had developed an aversion to most foods, including egg, pork, anything cremated and all dairy – except for yoghurt, for some odd reason. He sighed again. It had been a pain trying to develop an eating plan for the brat, but he’d had to admit – if only to himself – that it had been fun. At least he had still been able to eat and drink sheep and goat’s milk and cheese. It had given him a bit more variety to play with.
“Due to the person I am to bond with,” George said. “While the Patil family is one of the most respected in both the British and Indian magical communities, Pavarti is NOT respected in the least. Since her first year at Hogwarts, she has kept company with one Lavender Brown – who has earned herself the title of Hogwarts Goodtime Girl with the reputation of being a gossip hound with not enough brain cells to rub together. While the first part of Lavender’s reputation has skipped Pavarti, the second part has not. Instead of focusing on lessons, she looks through magazines or talks about boys. If a member of the opposite sex is not rich, famous or ‘cute’,” George grimaced at the word, “they are worthless in her eyes. Her results have decreased until she is only just passing because instead of doing any of it, she spends her time doing Lavender’s hair, nails or make up while listening to her compare the however many males she was with the previous evening.”
“Harry?” Remus asked shakily. The man nodded.
Severus sat on the seat as still as he could and resisted the urge to either rub his temples or squeeze the bridge of his nose. So far they had questioned several of the students whom he had disciplined in his class about how harsh and hated he was and the illustrious Headmaster. Who knows what rubbish the next ‘witness’ would come up with when called up.
“Not this time,” he said, placing a chaste kiss to the top of her blonde head. “I have guard duty in ten minutes.”
“Bloody brats,” she hissed in her mind, thinking over all the failed attempts of the previous year. “Even now everyone is jumping over themselves to do the boys bidding. He needs to be punished, but how?”
Exploring the Chamber of Secrets
“The only person outside our contacts within the businesses’ we can discuss them with is our silent partner, and that is only because they are in charge of our finances.”
He walked out of the room happily. At the rate those two were going his private rooms would be potion ingredient free and his private and student cupboards re-stocked. ‘I wonder what I could give them as a thank-you,’ he thought as he let the class into the student lab.
“Pretty much,” Tobias said happily from his seat on Draco’s lap.
“NO!” Draco yelled, pulling away from Harry. “Don’t remove it please!” he begged. “I want to be your nasty little whore all week. I don’t want it to be removed until you come back from your first day back at work. Please, please Master.”
With another flashed smile, Luna turned to the darkest area between two large trees. “You know what to do Algranol,” she said. “Enjoy yourself!”
“Pateras? Nonos? Anadochos? What’s for breakfast?”
“You don’t have to do that,” Tobias yawned. “We should be safe here.”
“Always my dear sister,” Neville replied with a smirk, “but don’t you think you should release Dynamo first?”
“So do I,” Greg announced. “Father told me about a spell/potion/rune combination the binds weapon so only the rightful owner can cause damage with them. Others can pick them up and swing or stab with them, but the injuries they would cause doesn’t have a big effect on the recipient – more of a bruising then punctures or battering.”
Here I am (Here I am)
~ Yes, you can. I was wondering how well you understand the human tongue. ~
Once he had the robe off, Tobias gave into temptation, and ran his hands up Draco’s arms to his chest, before his mouth was claimed once more in a frantic, almost desperate, kiss.
Lucius and Severus sniggered to themselves. They knew that this was a part of the plan, but if they hadn’t, they would have been sucked into thinking that their godson didn’t want it to be announced. Lucius collected himself and cleared his throat.
Harry smiled thinly, and then grimaced as the welts that decorated his back rubbed against the sheet beneath him. Severus handed him a bottle of dreamless sleep potion.
She returned to her seat and gave her letter to Labrys with instructions to give it to her Father. Theodore’s curiosity got the better of him as Luna got to the end of her note to the twins. As soon as he found the speed he liked, Luna, Ginny, Tobias, Greg and Vincent started to sing along to it.
“Then go get ready. You have double potions, charms and then a spare – which you will be spending with me in my private lab. Albus requested that I make more Veritaserum, skele-gro and I need to make the base of Remy’s potion. I thought you’d like to help me.”
To no one’s surprise, Blaise was The Pack’s unapologetic bachelor playboy and Tobias got many complaints from those outside The Pack because he wasn’t reigning the Italian male in. Tobias always replied that as long as both parties were willing and Blaise made it very clear to his partner that it was only an exchange of physical graduation, then what made it their business what his single, therefore unattached, protector did in his free time?
“Hormones still going?” Helga asked as they approached.
Eyes like emerald chips glared at the guilty party when Vince returned with him in his grasp. The crowd grew silent as they noticed fourteen blades buried in three areas – six a hair above the groin, seven in the stomach and one very small and deadly blade buried in the hollow of his throat. Tobias smiled.
“Rise, Gios. Reveal yourself to our followers, so they know not to harm you.”
“I’m not going to hurt him, Dragon. Now behave.” Draco ducked his head in embarrassment as those around him chuckled. Once more Narcissa ran a finger over the design. “This is beautiful. Can you explain it for us?”
Both of the fifth year girls threw themselves at the dark-haired teen and squeezed him tightly while happily yammering at him and each other. When the two of them released him and started asking the Slytherin girls in the years below them if they would like to join them, Draco worriedly led his once more exhausted husband back to his seat.
“Draco!” Tobias arched into the movement, trying to get the feeling back. “More! Oh Gods, please more!” he pleaded, whimpering.
Tom, Lucius and Narcissa sat in the main sitting room in complete silence. None of the three wanted to be the first to vocalise their thoughts that were going through their heads. After several more moments, Lucius exhaled heavily and rubbed his face with both hands in a rare show of weakness.
Watching as his Neogennito’s pack wondered in deep in chatter, he blinked in surprise. Casting his eyes back to his mate, he noticed the pride in his eyes as he looked at his Slytherins. Gently placing a hand on his thigh, he continued to eat.
Draco stayed wrapped around the centre of his universe until he sensed he was ready. The Pack, to Severus’ surprise, took turns to reach out and touch their leader.
She was knocked from her thoughts by a knock at her window by an unknown owl. Standing, she pulled her wand from its sheath and opened the window. “Deposit it on the table,” she told the owl. “There is water and food at the owlery or a plain biscuit and water here if you wish.”
That, in itself, testified that the boy who was Harry Potter, no longer existed and it was Albus Dumbledore who had created this dark angel. He was suddenly relieved that he was on the boy’s good side, or he’d be worse than dead. He grinned at this thought; scaring the first year Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students more than if he’d performed an unforgivable on them. Some things, after all, were not expected on the first – or last – day at Hogwarts.
Lucius and Severus also looked around, silent with awe. They had no idea as to how he’d done it, but they could tell that not everything had been done with magic. The two of them shared a look. Here was proof of the treatment their godson had had to endure at the hands of his old family. They were surprised at the style he had – It was astonishing for a 16 year old.
Tobias nodded. “I’ll deal with the report first, then we will have lunch – I may need to talk with Pateras after eating, so I should go for a nap – so maybe we can collect the report and then head out to the Lake to eat. I’m sure that you or Epikindynos can talk the house-elves into giving you enough food for everyone and we can talk on the way there.”
Tobias beamed at Draco.
Neville lead Luna to the portrait in silence, but before it closed behind her, he couldn’t help but ask, “Why did you heal him?” As he headed to bed and a deep, dreamless sleep, her answer echoed through his mind.
The twins beamed at her.
“This is interesting, Tobias,” Narcissa said, truly finding it fascinating. “But what has this to do with you not being an animagus? Everyone in this room who doesn’t have red hair saw you go wolf a week ago.”
Lucius hid a smirk. His son had it bad. He was drawn from his thoughts with the arrival of Minerva in her best robes. Narcissa had surprised everyone by asking the transfiguration teacher to oversee the ceremony. That she accepted without hesitation surprised many more, but Draco had been thankful. All the Professors of Hogwarts bar the Headmaster were in the congregation, as were all The Pack members. It had been decided that only Tom would stay with Tobias before the ceremony.
Severus’ face paled. “You didn’t,” he whispered. Tobias, Neville and Draco just grinned at him. Severus swayed slightly, pale green coming up in his cheeks.
“I swear if I find him in here …” he muttered, glaring at the door. He opened it slowly.
He stopped in mid-stride as he took in his friend of the last 20 odd years and the man before him.  He bowed stiffly and murmured, “My Lord,” before turning to Lucius.
The twins get revenge
“Thank you for this wonderful evening Drakontas,” he murmured sleepily.
Lucius’ jaw dropped at the language his Lord was using.
Chapter 39
“You lot go ahead. I’ll deal with Lykos.” He looked at the three elder members of the group. “Are you going to do as I suggested?” At their nods, he smiled. “Good. I’d hate to need to order you to do it.” He walked towards Remus, who yanked him into an empty classroom and then pulled him into a warm, but tight, embrace.
“I promise you this Drakontas. I will be yours in every sense of the word, but not right now. I love you and I always will. Please believe me when I say I have a good reason for what I’ve done.” Tobias then left, leaving a hurt and confused Draco in the room alone.
The screams froze in everyone’s throats as the bodily remains of the former brains of Gryffindor became surrounded in pure white flame as the red-stained wolf slowly shed its fur and returned to human form. “I announce the fulfilment of the blood oath to magic against one Hermione Jan Granger. May the Mother continue her punishment in my stead. So Mote it be.”
Draco felt his throat close and his heart pound when Tobias smiled at him. He now understood where The Mother was coming from. If they had to only meditate, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop himself from touching – or tasting – his beloved.
Tobias sighed in resignation. “Duty calls, Drakontas,” he whispered to the blonde. Standing and casting a strong straightening charm at his and Draco’s clothing, he turned to face a large painting of a common room – The one they were currently standing in. In the room was a man with deep auburn hair and warm hazel eyes that were hardened towards the intruders.
Severus looked at Tom in shock.
“Then forgive me for repeating anything you may know while I explain it to everyone else,” Algernon said before turning to the others in the room. “Firstly, there is a difference between what occurs between a natural male pregnancy and one bought about by a potion. A potion pregnancy is very similar to a female pregnancy. This is because the potion is taken for a month before the man can fall pregnant and then they have to take the potion for the first trimester to ensure good health for both carrier and child. The child is then removed from the body via a cut to the lower stomach call a caesarean or c-section.
“I’ll be waiting with open arms,” Harry smiled. “Ready to whisk you away to our private place for a candle-lit dinner, dancing to slow music, a deliciously both bath and a week of such hot and steamy passion that authors of Mills and Boon books worldwide will be begging for the publication rights.”
Chapter 28
Madam Amelia Bones
Several moments passed them by in silence, all waiting for the Dark Lord to call for them. Five minutes later, Lucius arrived at the door, gesturing once for them to follow. Follow they did. First Tobias and Draco closely followed by Pansy and Neville. Each Second was walking behind their superior. In lines behind them followed Fred and George, Greg and Vince, Blaise and Ginny, Millicent and Luna ending with Bill, Theodore and Charlie. Silence surrounded them.
If Tobias’ grip on Draco’s hand tightened drastically, the blonde did nothing except squeeze back gently. It was time.
Draco sat in his usual seat at the Slytherin Table eating as though he was desperate to get somewhere. Those in the other houses watched him wearily as they took note of Tobias’ absence. Many people incorrectly believed that the medical exam on the ex-Gryffindor had discovered anther nefarious plot against the boy or the child he carried and every one of them vowed to stay out of the blonde’s way.
“I do NOT want to think of that Severus!” Lucius whined. “My son has not, will not and never will be a sexual creature. He’s sexless. That is final!”
“We know. That’s why we are giving you this opportunity,” Draco answered.
Amelia closed her eyes and rubbed her temples in an attempt to reduce the size of her headache. The last of the seventh years had just passed through the Healer’s make-shift workrooms and several of them had to be informed of the consequences of some of their actions. Three of their number had to be removed to St Mungos with letters being sent immediately to their parents due to potion addiction. Nine were on the list to visit mind healers every week and two had to set appointments with the Healers at St Mungos due to being pregnant.
Tobias stretched and grinned, thankful for the break. “It is going well, Lykos. We are all just about finished over last assignment. Would you like to join us for tea? My Pack’s parents may also join if they wish.”
“We kind of forgot about that tiny detail,” Gregory said, bringing laughter to the Alpha pair.
Draco nipped and licked his way across Tobias’ chest, with his hands starting to run slowly down the leanly muscled arms of his soon-to-be claimed spouse. When he reached his husband’s dark nipples, he stopped and gently ran his hands over them, revelling in the gasp it pulled from his husband’s throat. He stared at the nipples in interest as he kept rubbing the small nubs until they were semi-erect. Once they were semi-hard, he licked his lips and lipped one of them, causing the black-haired man to start whimpering while he arched his back and struggled to remove his hands from their ties.
“We will need to work on Occulmancy again this year, Neogennito, so he can’t get into your head. This is going to be more important than last year.”
Tobias shuddered, murmuring: “Vermin.”
“You know I don’t,” Minerva playfully scolded. “Pack up your papers and rest a while. Either I or Draco will wake you in time for morning tea.”
All of them became aware only when their fingers were wrapped around a chilled glass. Without thinking, they all took a mouthful and were bought to an immediate, spluttering awareness.
Thats raging outside
The first year nodded and then the screen changed until they watched the first year put The Packet of herbs into one of Tom’s pockets. The screen went blank and attention went back to Tobias – who was once more trembling in Draco’s lap.
Minerva waited until Hermione had returned with a few books before walking out of the Library, a very pale Madam Pince seated behind the desk. Walking to a particular door, she knocked. When the door opened, she called, “Filius, we need to talk – and it is important!”
Draco looked at him, quizzically. “Yes?”
“Excuse me, Madam Pince,” Tobias stated almost hesitantly. I hope you don’t mind me asking, but why isn’t there an area of the library set aside for groups wanting to work together?”
“Go back to sleep, dikos mou Drakontas. It is too early for anything to happen. I’m going to go start making the Chamber more acceptable.”
“Yes, I’m sure. He had …”
“Well,” Lucius said, “As you are a heardless centaur, we will leave that section blank. How long do we have to wait for the registration number to be applied?”
“My vote would be the fact that we are here and the toad-bitch whore of the Wind in the Willow’s cast is, at this very point in time, screeching worse than Crookshanks when the gnomes decided on roasting him on the spit while alive this past summer.”
“Luna is doing just fine youngster,” the overly cheerful man stated with a grin. “We got the small blood problem sorted out.”
“Did you hear?” she asked softly yet excitedly. “The brand was revealed last night by McGonagall!” She giggled in her excitement. “So was the fact that Tobias took a death oath out on her.”
Tobias nodded. “As to why I want you two girls to do this, you two are the only two I can trust to do this with the same attention to detail that I myself would dedicate to this task. I had thought Theo as well, but I figured that he’d be more interested in any scrolls, parchments, books or pieces of paper that he finds.”
“For how long?”
Draco blinked slowly and walked into the room. There, resting his head on Severus’ lap was a sleeping Tobias. “How long?”
Theodore Nott – Pontikos [Mouse] – Scholar
“However,” Tom interrupted over the Auror’s spluttering, “We will agree with having a hearing for Severus – if only so this little … misunderstanding … is not repeated in the future,” he smirked.
Lucius sighed. “I have no idea. The only thing I know is that they are trying to get Fudge to allow them to sit their NEWTs before the end of the year.”
“I think we are going to try for another two exams before calling it a night. The three awake people jumped at the sleepy voice.
“Let us just floo Remus and Narcissa. We’ll stay here for the rest of today and the evening meal. Sounds like you need all the help you can get with the boy.”
“Mother,” they murmured reverently.
Hermione curled up on the chair in the Gryffindor common room, tears rolling down her face. She had managed to write half of the assignment up before she’d broken down. She hoped with all her heart that Harry would forgive her, but deep down she knew that Harry no longer existed and that the boy who had replaced him would never accept her apology. She didn’t know how she knew, but she knew for certain that she would die by the end of the year – and there was nothing she could do about it.
“No matter how much you scream, no one will hear you,” Luna’s mystifying voice came from around the room. Neville struggled to hold hi his laughter as he stopped pulling on the ropes, satisfied that they would hold.
She looked at them, thin-lipped and nostrils flaring as she noticed the glares they were exchanging. “It looks as though there is only one way to stop you from fighting and as much as it pains me to do this; I will not be healing your injuries this time. You will need to stay here while they heal naturally and you will have no visitors for the full week!”
Wordlessly Tom handed over the parchment.
“It’s the last shed of the Chamber’s basilisk. Keep it safe,” he explained, shrinking it and handing it to Remus, once again inside its protective bag. Remus nodded. Tobias moved to the door. “Act pissed off,” he murmured before opening the door and walking off in a huff.
“But this letter,” Fred stated, shaking his hand and drawing everyone’s eyes back to the parchment he was still holding, “Calls it ‘Justice’.”
“I would if I didn’t know that they would deserve it. Mother only loses her temper when someone disregards one of her laws – or one of her guardians.”
“No, I learnt it in History of Magic – Year three, Semester Two, Term Four, two and a half weeks before the final exam. Anyone who pays attention would know that.”
Tobias stretched, making his spine crack. Unconsciously, he rubbed his lower arm, drawing Remus’ attention to it.
Pearls with the glow of the moon.
“As do we Love,” Draco murmured softly. “We just need to remember that every so often.”
“Boys,” she called out. “Your turn. Did you want to go together or separate?”
Tobias and Draco's first date :[)
“We only have Potions after this, Sir,” Draco told the man before him respectfully. “Professor Snape has assured me that he has something Tobias can do that won’t harm anyone. He’s even given him permission to use his personal lab.”
“I promise I will only work until you finish reading the letters the stop for half an hour then start again when you start your first reply then stop and repeat. This way I can get my work done, my Pack can get their homework done and we can still socialize.”
* * *
“Okay everyone!” Minister Fudge said, walking into the room full of O.W.L students. “We have to start soon, so please follow me.” Everyone stood and followed him deeper into the building.
Walking into the room the rest of The Pack laughed at the red-faced boy.
Draco nodded, fighting the urge to swoon. Who would have guessed that deep down the Slytherin Ice Prince was a romantic?  Not Draco that’s for sure. When Tobias raised the Ivy to one side of the shrub and led him to the entrance for his first glimpse of what lay behind it, Draco lost his fight.
“Serving a customer.”
After a half hour, Tobias and Draco rose. The rest of The Pack, Remus and Severus, followed them closely. Neville, Luna and Ginny remained seated in a pre-ordained wish of their Alpha’s. Ten minutes after they left, Neville made the suggesting they go to the Library to complete their session.
“Correct, Mr Black. The same is true for the opposite. Foxglove, for example, is a muggle herb that is extremely dangerous but in extremely small doses can strengthen a weakened heart. If this plant is grown in a magical environment, however, the poison inside the plant reacts to the magical properties of the fertilizers used here, as well as the magic in the air, making it safer to use. This is why Dark Age muggles found it easy to distinguish our kind from their own, as no healer worth their salt was found without it. IF you’re interested in that topic, I can arrange for Professor Sprout to talk to you about it at the end of this topic. She would be the best person to explain the …”
“To determine which potions and spells were put on or drunk by us with our consent, you remove them – this is easily done because they have a small amount of our magic present,” Fred sneered, running his wand over the potion’s list while George did the same with the spells.
Lucius nodded. “Yes, Cissa. I do believe it is his doing. He is a dangerous and most powerful wizard – but he still manages to stay innocent. He has all the qualities of the Founders, and he doesn’t lose them – Even when he was punishing Bella, he still managed to remain innocent and sweet.” Lucius shook his head in amused exasperation. “I just wish I knew how!”
Once he was satisfied with his marking – and claiming – of Tobias’ chest, he let his hands and mouth slowly wander over his stomach, marking every defined muscle after thoroughly licking and nipping it.
“Herbology, Potions and Defence,” the red-head answered with a sigh.
Chapter 4
“Grandmother,” Blaise murmured with a slight bow.
A whistle made everyone look up at where the Dark Lord was, only to see Remus removing his fingers from his mouth since he’d gotten their attention.
Much like his brother had done, George performed the spell with an almost absent-minded grace and both twins froze as they watched the paper flow from both wands.
With one last grin, Luna returned her voice to her normal dreamy tone and began to once again sing the short song.
“I know the gist of it, but I do not know the exact wording he used. Why?”
“Explain!” he ordered, making Severus sigh.
“Yes Professor.”
Tobias grinned, unashamed at his request, as both he and Draco were handed their lists.
Shaking his head, he stretched and got out of his bed. Making his way to the bathroom to complete his morning ritual, he was unaware of the sleepy silver-grey eyes of his betrothed on him. He did notice the gaze when he returned in nothing but a towel and hair still dripping from his shower. Smirking, he sauntered over to Draco and placed a gentle brush of his lips on Draco’s forehead.
“Of course I am!” Blaise exclaimed to much laughter. “I’m never trusting that innocent look every again!”
“I’m sorry,” Severus stated, “I think I am hearing things. I thought I just heard you say you wanted to end the war within the next two days.”
“But the information you are looking for is harder to find than you thought?”
The already quiet room hummed silence when Tobias, the Dark Lord and Draco entered the room. The look of betrayal in Tobias’ eyes made each person in the room – whether guilty or not – bow their heads in shame. Tobias looked over everyone in the room, face blank. In his hand was a vial of the same potion he’d made for Draco. Taking three drops of it, he handed the vial to his father with a nod of thanks. Severus turned pasty.
“You seem to be wearing too many clothes, my soon-to-be Lover.”
Tobias nodded and set up his stuff. The Professor started talking and nothing could be heard but the scratching of quill on parchment and the sound of a droning voice.
“…Elia! Amelia!”
“Narcissa put silencing charms up as we left the room,” Tindershank stated, making the youngsters jump. “She and Algernon said the babe is crowning so we shall be meeting him or her soon.”
“What’s up Tom? Starting to feel your age?” Sev grinned.
Tobias flamed into the Snake Pit feeling really annoyed. He’d had plans with his fiancé, but the old goat had summoned him to his office and had kept him there for an hour, trying to get his father’s name from him. Storming over to Draco, he straddled his lap and pulled him into a gentle – but determined – kiss.
“Now, if the sweet were to be chewed, rather than sucked,” Tobias nodded at Neville and watched as he put it into his mouth and started chewing, “The person can walk through a house fire and still be cold.” He turned his attention back to Neville, who was completely blue with purple lips. His teeth were chattering that hard that it was surprising he didn’t chip them.
“You are a disgrace to your family line,” Tobias sneered. “Not only that, but you are a disgrace to Mother magic and the world of wizardry.”
Manuel, his father, smiled at him. “The process of disowning children from the line is not a Zabini way, it is a Greengrass tradition. Your mother and I have an arranged marriage and a clause in it stated that their family belief was to be enforced and if I didn’t like it, my magic would force me to do it. I was not shown that page or I would never have signed it. I’m so proud of you for doing what is right. I am honoured to call you a member of my family. Prouder still to call you my son.”
Tobias nodded and smiled lovingly at his husband.
Chapter 18
“Eighty-nine percent of the pranks we pulled were aided by spells, potions and products that we made, created and thought up ourselves,” they chorused. At the moment we have contacts with the Ministry and Randal, as well as a few others who have requested to remain nameless.”
Lucius grit his teeth so hard that he swore he could hear them creak with the strain he was putting on them as he was forced to listen to the high-pitched girlish voice coming from the pink-clad sadistic clown before them.
Thanatos – Greek god of Death
Tobias, who had been cuddled into Draco’s side and dozing with his head nestled on his husband’s very comfortable shoulder, jumped at the unexpected noise.
Vincent smiled and ran a gentle finger over the package in his pocket. He hoped the silver-eyed female liked what he had found for her.
Soon all of the full members of The Pack had transformed and were howling a song of welcome to the young cub.
Albus sighed. He needed to get more information and he needed it now! As he couldn’t get that information now, he decided to have a bit of fun planning the destruction of Harry’s support base – and he would not call the bloody brat Tobias. He was named Harry by him and that was that! Albus rubbed his eyes, tiredly. Maybe it would have been easier for him if he had chosen Neville to be his scapegoat, but at the time, he’d needed the Potter’s dead, and the boy had so much power he could drain from.
“Goodnight, Ray. I also love you heart and soul.”
“Yes, Bi. I know that Dumbledore is a goat fucker, and I know we had plans, but I’m comfortable right here, so how about we spend tonight like this and go out tomorrow night instead?”
“Yes,” Luna hummed. “I’ll meet you all there. I’m going to Ravenclaw to get some more parchment. . My last lot was filled much too fast for my licking.”
Voldemort swallowed half of it before starting to sip at it. “Like I’ve just been pulled through a field by a Hippogriff tag-team. Why do I feel so sick? Can I have something for a headache and nausea?”
“A lucky guess,” Draco smiled, showing their colour to Blaise who tried his hardest not to laugh.
“Anything!” the twins stated.
An hour later, a pale Bill, an amused Remus and a hissing Tobias flamed into Tom’s office. Tobias started pacing, still hissing angrily. He stopped when Tom walked to his seat with Nagini – both of them laughing.
Before anyone could react, one of the boys of The Pack stood from his place and strode confidently to where the group stood. Stopping, he raised an eyebrow at the three and bowed, extending a hand.
“The resulting blade looks delicate to the point of fragility but is strong enough,” she plunged the blade into the remaining shin,” to slice through bone like it was a spoon through bread and butter pudding.”
“We have done all we can here tonight,” Achalendra said softly as he watched the young man before him and his comrade fight off the sleep he looked to desperately need. “Padma and Pavarti are going to be checked in the first group of sixth years while Misters Fred and George Weasley will be checked over tomorrow morning before the fifth years.”
“Please,” he whimpered. “Please.”
Half an hour later Dobby appeared. “Is sir liking the fruit?”
Draco entered the room he shared with Tobias slowly. He was a little afraid of what his husband would do to him since it was close to midnight and he had said – before witnesses – that he would be up as soon as he had finished eating. He sighed in relief when he successfully navigated his way to the bedroom door, hoping that the pregnant male would give him time to explain what had happened before he was punished. He opened the door; grimacing at the pins and needles he received from the hex that was on the door handle, telling him that his husband was pissed off, only to discover an empty room.
Severus nodded, still looking down and moved to the fireplace, ignoring the feeling of several spells hitting him in the back. He honestly didn’t care what the result was from the spells combining was, after all, nothing was as painful as neither of his godson’s talking to him and his mate rejecting him.
“Uncle Algie, Mr Jones. Mr Jones, this is my Uncle Algie. He’s an ex-healer from St Mungos. He’s specialized in pre-natal care of both male and female pregnancies.”
Tobias smiled and stretched. “Is everyone ready for the next two days?”
Tobias sneered at the set of four portraits and stamped his way to where he could see Remus’ laughing form walking through. Draco glared at Theo and the two portraits before following his husband.
“For example,” Fred continued, completely steam-rolling over the woman’s outraged attempts at scolding them. “The wand movement used to detect spells is a downwards slash, flick to the right and ends with a jab, like so.”
“Yes, dikos mou lykos. Have I changed that much?”  As everyone nodded, a phoenix appeared and landed on Harry’s shoulder.  Severus forced himself to breathe as he noticed it was Fawkes, but that he’d changed. He was now the colour of sapphires, emeralds and onyx, with clear silver-green eyes that made you think of the ocean after a thunderstorm.
Tindershank – Goblin; Pronounced Tin-der-shank
The forth recipient allowed the letter to fall from his horror-numbed fingers. His fiancée was hurting and he was a cause for it. After several minutes of staring into nothingness, he snatched the page up from the floor and re-read it feverishly, hoping that he hadn’t lost the one person he loved beyond all else. He almost sobbed in despair when the bottom had been signed as Severus instead of the usual sensually entwined double ‘S’ he had used since the day they had started dating in school.
The Leaky Cauldron was quiet when Tobias and his two companions appeared. Nodding a greeting to the barman, they walked out the back and into the crowded street that was Diagon Alley.
Severus squeezed the bridge of his nose as he closed the door behind the trio. “What can I do to help you?” he asked after he checked on the still sleeping students.
“Allow me, Love,” he purred before kneeling in front of Draco and slowly undoing the tiny buttons with his teeth. Once he had finished, he placed his hands so they were only a hair above the alabaster skin he loved so much and moved them up, gently removing the robe while being so close to touching the flesh he yearned for, yet not quite touching it.
I am sorry I disobeyed you when you were teaching me Occulmancy and I know I was wrong in looking into the pensieve. I apologise to you most sincerely for my behaviour towards you in the past five years.  I know you will not believe me when I say these things, so I am willing to make an unbreakable to respect you at all times and to allow you to dose me with Veritaserum, legilamency and pensieve my thoughts for you to view.
“Lovely,” Draco murmured to Tobias, only to make a face and shudder when he turned away. “We will both be brushing our teeth before our next class.”
“Just because you are a Prefect, Mr Weasley, does not mean you can take bribes to not take points from people,” he purred, laughing internally at the look on their faces. “After all, no human would willingly attach themselves to someone like you if there was nothing in it for them.” The girl – a fourth year Hufflepuff he realised – flushed with embarrassment as tears filled her eyes.
Neville smirked and held out his hand like he was going to shake someone’s hand and laughed when Ron startled as another misty hand appeared before him.
The man’s sneer vanished to be replaced by a scowl that got darker the more Tom spoke.
“I will also catch up with you,” Pansy said. “I’m going to check up on Professor Snape. He might have some things he wants investigated as well.”
“I’m holding my first followers meeting tonight at 6:45.” Tobias whispered, setting up a sound-proof shield around them. “I have been given a week’s worth of detention with Minerva and three months of detention with Filch for what happened. The old goat was practically salivating over the fact that he could use this against me after I ‘get rid of’ Pateras for him.’ Tobias rolled his eyes. “I will do them without question, but I will not apologise nor beg forgiveness of the bastard. See if you can convince Filch to give my detention as organising all his files – I’ve seen them, he needs the help.”
“He kicked,” Tobias stated, astonished. “He actually kicked.” He raised awed eyes to meet with his husband’s weary but hopeful ones.
Achalendra – the immovable, the Himalayas
“Hello yourself, Kyria,” Neville whispered back. “I thought you might like a guide in the Lion’s den. I also thought you might like someone to help control Weasley.”
Chuckling softly, Lucius handed the older man his report from the previous day and left. "Who would have thought," Lucius mumbled softly, only just loud enough for him to hear his own voice, "that the so called ‘Evil Dark Lord’ couldn’t resist lowering himself to poking an unresisting form."
Lucius nodded his agreement. “Randal isn’t his real name, but as it is unsafe to reveal his true name, that is what we refer to him as.”
“Um, I’m going to have to go asked the Minister …”
Introducing The Pack and Narcissa goes a touch bonding happy ... BONDING not BONDAGE!
“Uncle Algernon?” she whispered, not sure if what she was seeing before her was real.
“Hey Nonos! Guess what! The adoption papers came through!”
Raithia bowed deeply to him. ~ Greetings young one. You are a fit mate for the Heir. Your magical power balances his out. May your gaze kill and your venom grow stronger by the day.~
Tobias tugged on Draco’s arm softly. “Do you want some Drakontas?” he asked innocently as he put his half-eaten sandwich on his husband’s lips so he had no choice but to try some.
Zog nodded his agreement. “He’s right. As well as this, once you are integrated into the Garden’s wards, you will lose the protection we gave you as a babe. You will have the mother’s protection and will therefore no longer need ours, however, one of your guardians will remain with you while another will become your animagus form. We do not know which ones they will be, but they will probably be the two that have attached themselves to you the most.”
“Nap time?” Draco asked softly.
He didn’t hear what Draco’s response was as he fell asleep as the last word left his lips.
Once the group was settled with drinks of their choice, Remus cleared his throat. “Ok, I’m afraid there are some things we would like to know. Firstly, how did you get attached to Tobias? Second, can you explain the creature/soul bond the boy’s share? Third, why are your claws a part of the boys bonding mark? Fourth …”
“You asked for our presence, Lord?” Tobias asked in a strong, clear voice.
Two and a half hours later, Tobias put down his spoon for the last time with a sigh of happiness. “That was wonderful Draco. Thank you.”
Dedicated to: Ash. Here is your promised one shot Hun. Hope you enjoy it and here’s wishing you a very early Happy Birthday.
“I don’t know about that, Luc,” Narcissa said with a smirk. “He’d make a very good mother.”
After Tobias had finished looking over Draco to make sure none of the potion had hit him, he looked up at the female who was responsible for the accident with a hiss on his lips, which changed into laughter. Standing in Lavender’s place was a peacock stamping its feet. Hearing Tobias laugh freely was Severus’ breaking point.
Unlike the other outsiders who married into The Pack, Angelina didn’t want to join The Pack and therefore didn’t try to assimilate into what equalled as ta major part of Fred’s life. In the end, Fred was thankful when the divorce papers arrived the day after she had left. Unfortunately for him, he didn’t find a companion to bond with until he was about seventy five, so he had no cubs of his own, but he was one of the people who voluntarily submitted himself to the horror of babysitting duty and took his position of ‘Uncle Gred’ with an ease and enthusiasm that reminded everyone of a puppy with a new toy … only more disastrous.
Tobias eyed the adults critically before he handed them each a potion from his backpack. Severus bolted his without checking to see what it was. While the adults were calming down, Tobias had handed his new wand (black walnut, 13 and a half inches, slightly supple – Gossamer thread core) to Draco. He clapped his hands once, bowed his head and rubbed them together, slowly going faster.
Tobias smiled. “No, R’thir, you didn’t insult us. We very much enjoy it. May we have another glass each?” The youngster beamed and nodded, rushing to refill their glasses before leaving the pitcher between them. Ruen watched him collect the used cutlery before placing the new plates before them. Removing the covers from the plates, he bowed in the form of humans and left.
“Epikindynos, your parchment is the only one with nothing on it at this point in time. This doesn’t mean you have nothing to do. You can still aid anyone else in their duties and once Alpha agrees to it, you and I hand he will be starting on that job he wanted done – but I think that will now be left until after the cub is born.”
“Yes.  And there is only one person that has had contact with him to place it. One Albus Dumbledore.”
He reached out for his brother and Alpha through his bond with them for support. After getting a replying pulse of energy, he continued.
Harry was pleased to see Draco shake his head, even as he struggled to get enough air into his lungs through his nostrils. In a move that took a lot of practice, Harry spun Draco around while he was still imbedded in his arse and carried him to a nearby desk. At seeing where he was being taken, Draco started breathing heavier and writhing in place.
Amelia couldn’t help the soft chuckle that escaped her control at just how disgusted the young man sounded at the mere thought of being marked in such a way. “Two more things than you may go, I promise. The first is your lack of a Dark Mark, even though I know that you had one a few years ago.”
Lord Lucius Malfoy
The door opened and he felt his eyes being drawn to it. He watched in awed amusement at how The Pack walked in, protecting their Lord’s son.
Draco stifled a moan as his finger was swallowed by the hungry hole. It took all his self-control to not rip his finger from the silky warmth and sheath his cock into it to the hilt, but even he wasn’t controlled enough to prevent himself from letting out a small whimper when Tobias pushed further onto his wriggling finger. He moved up the well-marked body beneath him to claim the plump, kiss-bruised lips as he removed the finger, to replace it with two. Both men moaned.
Tobias blushed. “I didn’t think of that.”
“Gran’thor Sal,” Tobias nodded politely.
Tobias clumsily moved til his head was on Draco’s chest and both were asleep within seconds – neither noticing the bright flare of magic they were encased in, nor the slight amount of blood-mixed semen that was leaking from Tobias’ anus.
Tobias smiled at him. “Can I get you to join me here please? I need something to cuddle,” Tobias whispered. “I want my Drakontas back.”
Tobias nodded and excused himself so he could take it in private. Returning to the group, he escorted Draco to the table. Once Draco was seated, Tobias sat and Ruen set the table, including the covered plates. R’thir served the drinks – something bubbling and pink – before the covers were removed from the plates. Draco’s mouth watered at the smell coming from the plates. As the centaurs left, both humans rose respectfully to their feet. Before Ruen left, he said. “We shall be back in forty five minutes, milord. Enjoy your starter.”
Draco chuckled at the exuberant elf and shook his head as he sat once again. Beside him, Tobias slept peacefully, unaware of everything that was going on around him.
Tobias blinked stupidly at the speaker before turning back to murmur compliments to his owl. The speaker grabbed the front of his school uniform and pulled him so they were almost nose-to-nose.
After he read it, Tobias yawned and rubbed his temples. “I knew that he had reported what had occurred between Madam Greengrass and myself and I also knew about his request to be bonded to The Pack should he be disowned, but I didn’t know about the section on Granger, Weasley or Bumblewhore,” he sighed and shook his head. “I’m too tired for this,” he murmured, rubbing at his eyes. “I’m going to need to talk to Ginny and Pansy then Blaise. I might do that while waiting for my fruit salad,” he pouted sleepily resulting in Tom chuckling softly.
“Bu … bu … but …”
Tobias collapsed into his chair and rubbed his eyes and temples. “Merlin I hate creatures that can’t think for themselves.” He looked up at the people still staring at him. “What? He snapped. “Five years of being friends with Weasley has created an intense hatred of idiotic beings. And it’s not as if this is the first time I’ve lost my temper so GET OVER IT!”
“You have a point there, brother,” Fred stated.
Tom sneered at the Aurors in disgust from behind Lucius, where he was reading the papers over the blonde’s shoulder. “This load of crap isn’t even enough for him to get a hearing before the Wizengamet, let alone a one way trip to Azkaban.”
“Good man!” Tobias beamed, “Very good answer. Of course Kyria should be the first person to see her gift!”
Two of the people before him blinked in shock at the protectiveness of the man.
Lucius Malfoy – Anadochos [Godfather]
Neville and Vince exchanged looks. During their time in the room, the ministry officials, the other students and Madam Greengrass had discovered just how bad their Alpha’s morning sickness was and just how restlessly he slept. Both boys believed that their Alpha would be much more comfortable and less … excitable … in his own environment – at least, they hoped so.
“I know,” Severus responded, exhaling heavily. “It’s just … I was so hurt by what had occurred that for the first time in over twenty years, I signed my name at the end of a letter instead of my usual sign-off. What if he took it as me not wanting to be with him anymore? What if,” Severus started to hyperventilate, “What if he’s called off the engagement?”
Luna is at it once again
“Cotton candy kittens,” he said, not quite hiding his distaste for the words that were falling from his lips.
“That is wonderful,” the boy said, “Sing them for me?”
Lucius, Narcissa and Remus stepped forwards as Tobias left his father’s embrace and returned to Draco’s.
“These are Glow-worms. When eaten, they make the eater blush when a certain pre-set word is said. Each sweet has its own code word, and you don’t know what that word is until the word is said – but boy is it worth the wait!”
The Pack chuckled weakly, only to stop and pale when the food vanished and Amelia stood.
He also knew that Sev would go easy on the Gryffindor beside him because he was Tobias and Draco’s second. It had surprised everyone when he revealed that Draco wouldn’t be his second, but his equal and that his chosen second was in fact the klutz of Gryffindor. Tobias indicated that he would gather the ingredients. Neville nodded slightly and started setting up under Severus Snape’s watchful eye.
Her hair was limp and scruffy, holding more grease than the Weasley family full English breakfast; her face was even more toad-like in appearance due to the very apparent removal of any make-up she had been wearing. It was her body, however, that caught everyone unaware. Where there was originally a short, fat witch was now a fat, unco-ordinated centaur with a dull cream coat and tail the same colour as the hair on her head and just as limp, scruffy and greasy.
“What do you want?” he groaned, rubbing his eyes with the heel of his hand.
When the last Professor walked into the transfiguration room, Minerva put up her strongest privacy charm – one that included a safety net ensuring that no one who heard what was spoken could reveal it. She turned to find herself being glared at by the school’s Potions Professor.
“Try not to move, Ray,” Harry soothed as he tore something. “I’ve got to immobilize your arm so the bones won’t move. I can heal the cuts and bruises but not the bones.”
Lucius glared the annoyance down. “It didn’t occur at the school – It occurred the night after their bonding. I should know ... the aftershocks of their magic combining blew apart my wards.”
Tobias moaned softly as Draco started to rub his shoulders. “Mmmmm, more.” Draco continued, liking that he had this type of power over the raven-haired Adonis. He chuckled, as Tobias became a pile of melted goo under his hands.
“Yes Grand’Mere Helga,” Tobias said with an awed look at his stomach. “It’s just a little more than a flutter at the moment, but movement none-the-less.”
Lucius, Severus, Draco and Voldemort blinked in surprise.  How could the boy be so calm and in control, even though he was wearing not one stitch of clothing? Remus chuckled softly.
They blinked in surprise. “Um …”
Noticing all the curious faces, Algernon chuckled. “How much do you know of male pregnancies?”
Blaise stepped forwards, face slightly pale. “We can’t find Draco. He came here to tell us what was going on with Tobias, and then he vanished and we can’t find him.”
“Of course I do,” Tobias stated. “I and my Pack believe that the way wizards have treated those they classify as beneath them is atrocious. Donating our magic will mean that we aid in protecting our money, our allies and the centre of the magical half of the United Kingdom.”
Draco shook his head, reminding himself that he really, really really didn’t want to know. “I did,” he agreed, ‘An unknown number of girls from Slytherin House and The Pack are planning on having a girl’s night in the Come and Go room. Tobias and I were hoping that you know of another trustworthy house elf that can watch over them and run errands for them. Things like food, drink, getting clothes and the like.”
Just filler really
The girl hummed through a tune of a few times before starting to sing.
“I can’t believe this!” Pavarti exclaimed, staring between her father and Tobias before pointing at Tobias. “You should know better, considering your relationship with that Death Eater-in-Training and your position in all this and you,” she turned and pointed at the Weasley twins, “are aiming far above your station in life.”
Chapter 24
Harry stood and bowed slightly. “Yes Sir. I am going to need to borrow all the things to make it from you, as I don’t even have my wand. Thank you for this chance, Sir.” He walked out of the door.
Before anyone could react, the man who voiced his opinion had been surrounded by multiple species of wolf with a large black wolf creeping towards the paling man with a snarl on its lips. When the snarling creature was within pouncing distance of the offending man, it slowly changed back into the white-haired Malfoy Heir.
London Bridge is falling down,
George snorted in amusement, “I’m sure that he will get to it by afternoon tomorrow. Draco’s forbidden him use of his magic remember. If anyone here is smart, they will suddenly discover a filing cabinet full of disordered paperwork for him to disappear in. The stuff he does on a day-to-day basis won’t keep him occupied for long.”
“Do you think he knows how much stuff of his life he put in there?” Severus asked him, not answering the question.
“What the hell are you doing that is taking so long with a simple fruit salad? He snarled. “Are you waiting for the fruit to grow?”
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Tobias – the first warning sign. “And how does it affect any female that eats it?”
Draco understood why this was so important to Tobias, so he didn’t complain when he disappeared at times – Not that he could complain. It was one of those days when Tobias disappeared early in the morning that Draco found himself thinking of his dark-haired fiancé with a small smile on his face. He still had the fond smile on his lips when a pair of arms wrapped around him and a chin rested on his shoulder.
Ruen smiled at his son, gesturing for him to speak.
She rubbed the mark with her fingers as she looked at the happy group over at the Slytherin Table with a heavy heart. She could have had that had she not been so stupid. She noticed as the Italian snake jumped slightly when the Parkinson girl put her arm around him, obviously asking him how he was after his night’s adventure – if you could call it that.
Albus watched the owl fly off with a smirk on his lips. He had been struggling with finding a plan to rid himself of one of the brat’s more potent supporters. One Severus Snape. It wasn’t until the potions professor told him with a pained hiss that HE was calling that a plan formed.
“The last thing he needed to break my mind was the death of the person I was closest to – Sirius. Everything that happened last year was a part of Dumbledore’s plan to break me. My whole LIFE has been him trying to break me, but he has failed! He doesn’t know the extent that I possess Gryffindor stubbornness or Slytherin cunning.” He smirked. “He also made the mistake of introducing me to his phoenix, who knew what was occurring. Fawkes has been on my side since second year – even before the basilisk incident.”
Luna smiled. “Thanks Skoteinos.”
“Sorry to bother you Madam Bones,” the teen before he said shyly. “I just wanted to ask permission for myself and a group of friends to spend the morning down by the Lake. There are a few of us and we are from different houses, so it is difficult finding places large enough to hold us all in an area that is neutral.”
Ron glared at the two Slytherins that just ran into the potions lab. Everything was their fault. He would have been better off if he had never met that small dark-haired boy who he’d been assured was easily manipulated.
“No,” the two of them answered without hesitation. “We removed all potions that were there due to our job. That one remained.”

“I just realised something odd, Bi.”
Chapter 36

The double doors slammed open and every wand in the hall was pointed at an enraged, blood-coated Remus Lupin. He stormed to join the three standing before the newly bonded father and son.
Tobias’ laughter echoed around the room. He turned to look at Draco, his eyes widening slightly. “Drakontas! Dressing to impress, or dressed to kill?” Striding over to him, he clasped the other boy’s upper arm in a sign of friendship. Pulling him into a hug he whispered, “You look good, Drakontas.” Letting him go, he bowed deeply to his father.
“I did get if Father,” Pavarti said, not being able to lie to the head of the family. “I just … didn’t read it all the way through.” She said the last bit quietly and looked away from the stone-faced man.
“I forgive you Draco. I’ll just ask Nagini to eat him later,” Harry stated seriously as he cuddled into his husband, “Can we go to bed now, I’m sleepy.”
“That she would’ve Poppet; that she would’ve.”
“And what is that?” Tom asked in amusement.
“That is understandable ‘Bi,” she smiled as she moved her things back to her desk so she was closer to the young man. “Now that you have allowed yourself to relax – well, since you are being forced to relax – everything in your body is taking the opportunity to relieve itself of its tension and exhaustion before you have the opportunity to push it all back. You need this time to assimilate everything that has occurred in the past year.”
Tom gave a grateful sigh when someone knocked at the doorway to his study. He was starting to think about pulling his son from Hogwarts just so he could hand all of the paperwork to him. He hadn’t given into the desire – but it was a close thing.
“I’ll come with you,” Ginny grinned, standing. “I’ll help carry it.”
Amelia chuckled as she followed the Deputy Headmistress’ gaze to find Tobias and Draco in the seat that had been placed at the end of the Slytherin Table, both boys fast asleep.
Tobias sighed. “It started when I first learnt what the Dursleys were doing to me was classified as abuse. By this time I believed that I was to blame for what was occurring, as I’d been under their control for five years previously.” He smiled sadly. “They started the day I turned three. It was the first time I’d performed magic. I had managed to avoid being hit by a car – It hit the tree beside me instead. The man behind the wheel apologised, even though it wasn’t his fault. Some stupid kid had put something on the road that destroyed the car’s tires. I had managed to apparate myself to one side – just enough for him to believe that he had been able to prevent him from hitting me himself by swerving. The Dursleys were watching and my aunt and uncle knew what that meant. After that every opportunity to beat me that came up, they took. I always feared the day Vernon would take it to beyond the beatings and starving, but it never happened – Not until this summer.”
