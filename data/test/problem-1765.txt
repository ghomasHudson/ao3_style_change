Blaise stepped forwards, face slightly pale. “We can’t find Draco. He came here to tell us what was going on with Tobias, and then he vanished and we can’t find him.”
“Thirdly,” he continued when he realised that no one was speaking, “where the hell were you when the Death Eaters attacked?”
“Both sides are decided on starting from scratch,” Tobias answered. He held out a scroll that the elderly goblin retrieved. “All bar the last point have been agreed upon.”
The Pack had settled into their places when their Alpha and his Beta entered the Hall. Luna, Neville and Ginny – who were seated at the Ravenclaw table under the guise of Neville tutoring the two girls in Herbology – also slumped slightly in relief. None of them could wait for the day that they could reveal their true allegiance.
“Oh! Tom, old boy! I didn’t see you there! If you’ve come to kill me, please do so now.  As you can see,” Harry pulled up the sleeves of the shirt he was wearing to reveal his lower arms, “I tried making your job easier for you by doing it myself,” Harry snarled in anger, not seeing the distress on Remus’ face, nor the shock and surprise on everyone else’s. “But it turns out that the old bastard hit me with a suicide prevention charm before he collared me.”
Lucius held up the fang for her to see as if it were a sacrifice to a sacred deity. “This fang fit into its mouth, along with a lot of others,” he explained, fingering the snapped end. “There is about one of my hand’s lengths still embedded in the creature’s skull – and this was the smallest fang the animal had.”
“Who knows what damage you would do,” George finished. As one, the twins turned and handed their results to Amelia and turned to leave.
“Are there any changes you wish to make to the contract boundaries?” Grapplehank asked as he took over for his grandson.
Helga bounced on the spot. She approved of this polite young man and the loyalty he had in the group surrounding him. It would be so good to have youngsters in their rooms once more. If anything they would be an interesting bunch to talk to.
Tobias nodded and sat in a seat that was nearby. He waited till his pack were comfortable then started his explanations.
Tobias sighed and stretched cat-like. “You have permission, Booph. When it comes to my Pack and family, you don’t need to ask. You know that.”
“Two hours,” Severus smiled. “He convinced me to read Remus’ letter, then finished going through the file he was working on. He finished it fifteen minutes ago and decided to catch a nap before going out to spend time with you all.”
When Ron next woke, he looked around and moaned softly. “This must be another dream,” he mumbled into his hands. “There are no places that are like this in the school.”
Zog chuckled. “Okay. We were first drawn to Akzant’tra when he was on the doorstep of the muggle’s house. We were on an errand for the Mother. She had felt something was off that night and sent us. We were drawn to this small sleeping babe. He was what the Mother had felt, so we gave him a gift – The ability for his magic to protect him by connecting to any predatory animal. So that we knew the little one was safe that night, we curled around him.”
Pansy nodded and gave both rolled parchments to the girl in question. Luna took them with a serious nod before moving back to her place in the hemisphere surrounding the table.
Tobias stretched, making his spine crack. Unconsciously, he rubbed his lower arm, drawing Remus’ attention to it.
“I’ll be alright,” he said. “I’ll just take a nap now, deal with those two meetings and then go straight to bed. Wake me when the food vanishes?”
“Just because I remove the mark doesn’t mean I am removing you from our dysfunctional family,” he hastened to reassure the man. “Instead of the Mark, you will have a pendant to wear. The pendant will be made into the shape of my family’s coat-of-arms.”
“You have met The Pack. You know who they are, now know this – They answer to me, and me only. Oh ... and Mr Bulstrode, I believe I made myself perfectly clear as to what would happen should you try to harm a member of my pack.” He closed his eyes and focused on his palm where a small black flame appeared. He threw it at the man and watched him scream with a smile on his face. The same smile was mirrored on the Dark Lord’s face as he watched his son. Many Death Eater’s shuddered with fear.
Harry allowed Draco to slide down the pole a little before he added and released another set of sweets into the water-filled depths of Draco’s arse. He then pulled Draco’s upper body back to meet his own, using the chain down his spine. He chuckled darkly as Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head at the sensation of his nipples being pulled harshly and his dick and arse being forced into the unforgiving pole.
Fred and George were left speechless as the two girls turned their wands onto their parchment. When the laughter stopped, the rest of The Pack copied them and as one, they cast spells to copy, preserve, link and camouflage their parchments before handing out copies and organising the resultant mass into neatness.
“You could do much better than him, Miss Ravel. I suggest staying away from him. As a teacher, I don’t want to have to floo your parents with the news that their daughter is pregnant before her 14
“Next weekend, Love. It will all be over this time next week. Then nothing will stop me from announcing to the world that you are mine. Not Ron, not Lucius, not even the gods themselves.”
“Randal isn’t going to like this,” Lucius stated after a moment of silence. “He was against Tobias returning after Severus contacted us for help in healing the boy.”
He sighed. It was very quiet in the house. Ginny had asked for – and received – permission to go travelling with Luna and her father for the holidays. Bill and Charlie were in Egypt and Romania and due to the shop; the twins were rarely at the burrow. Percy still wasn’t talking to the family – but he had started to answer the letters Ron had been sending him. In fact, he was going to be picking him up later on in the week to spend the day with him.
It was almost dinner time when the twins arrived in the rooms under the Chamber. They sat as one on a spare seat each and sighed in relief as the welcoming magi of The Pack relaxed them of their tension.
“Lawd Mwfoi,” the man drawled with a nod of his head. “Yer sayd some’in ‘bout a nu critter t’ work ma fields?”
“They did do the work. I’m just collating the information so it is easier for everyone to read and report. I can’t expect Neville – who is reporting on the students in the school – to be able to report on his topic when he has the information on Gryffindor, Ginny has the information on Hufflepuff, Luna for Ravenclaw and Theo for Slytherin. I’m just putting all the stuff for each individual report together. It will also make it easier for Pateras to read after the meeting.”
Harry stepped out of the lab, sore, hot and smiling. He’d managed to make the potion he had been set with only a small number of incidences, which he suspected were deliberately set by his Professor to test what his reactions would be. Overall, Harry felt as if he’d done a good job. Now he was to shower and dress for lunch and his visit with his Lord.
Blaise looked at her and blinked. “Never mind,” he muttered as he turned and walked to the table, missing the amused smirk on the blonde girl’s lips.
“I never thought I would have this,” Tobias’ soft voice said, breaking Draco from his thoughts once again. “I’m glad to have shared it with you.”
The three men looked up in surprise to find a freshly showered Tobias in the doorway, blinking sleepily. The three men had to grin when they saw what he was wearing. An open robe revealed dark blue pants, feet encased in white socks and muggle sneakers. It was the shirt, however, that caught their attention.
“And when he wants a break from that, I’ll take over with getting him to teach me how to cook.” Severus and Tom looked at Lucius in disbelief. “What? I must admit that it never occurred to me to learn how to cook, but Tobias makes it look quite enjoyable and I want to give 'Cissa something special for Valentine’s Day this year.”
They were halfway through discussing their reasons when laughter that sounded like a burbling brook interrupted them.
“For a while. I enjoy it – to a point – and until I find what I really wish to do then I think I’ll be happy. I would like to see about opening a restaurant that caters to those with special eating requirements. What do you think?”
The boys laughed softly before extending their hands and revealing the identical rings. Everyone’s eyes widened when they noticed that Tobias had the more delicate ring of the two, but they said nothing, already having been told about Tobias’ preferred position.
The owl bobbed its head in answer and flew back out the window after dropping the letter on the table. Without hesitation, Minerva shot spells of detection towards it before handling it to Severus, who read it without betraying his thoughts. When he was finished, he tapped the letter against his lips.
When the class was over, she noticed a flick of white out of the corner of her eye. Stunned for a moment, she let the information that a Slytherin had sent the note she wrote for Tobias to one Neville Longbottom. She shook her head. She shouldn’t be surprised. Neville, after all, was very loyal to his friends and family. Forcing her mind back to the lad before her, she pulled out a pensive. It was going to be a long afternoon.
Blaise gazed blankly at the woman he used to call ‘Grandmother’ before blowing air forcefully out of his lungs with contempt and looking away from her. He hadn’t been lying when he had said that he didn’t need anyone in his life. He had The Pack, anyone else was a bonus.
“What the hell are you doing that is taking so long with a simple fruit salad? He snarled. “Are you waiting for the fruit to grow?”
He felt the smile on Tobias’ lips when he planted a kiss on the top of his head. “I am dangerous, Dragon, and I am powerful. I am also a hopeless romantic – but only for and towards you. You, Drakontas, are the only being I would humiliate myself willingly for. You deserve nothing but the best. Nothing will stop me from giving you the best, not even loosing respect in Pateras’ eyes. Now, let’s go down for breakfast.”
Tobias sighed happily when Dobby presented him with his breakfast – which looked exactly the way he had ordered it. He ignored the disgusted looks he was getting from those who didn’t belong to his pack – who had become used to his strange cravings while trapped in the ministry room. He was surprised when Sally-Anne Perks, a sixth year Ravenclaw, stopped next to him to say good morning.
“What schooling?” Achalendra asked coolly as he herded his daughters towards the door. “From your results and what I have heard today, you are using your school years to learn how to be the Mistress of a rich man rather than learning how to become someone to be proud of. As it is, the only thing you will be able to do on your own is to work in the adult film industry. I am hoping time with the main branch of our family will change that. If not, then there are plenty of rich men who would be interested in having a younger woman on their arm.”
“Thank you for answering ma’am,” Tobias bowed slightly. “I have been wondering that for nearly two years now-ever since the tournament. I made a few friends from both schools and they told me about their systems for tutoring.”
His eyes moved to the three-seater beside the fire-place and he felt his heart melt. Tobias had somehow managed to curl up on one cushion with his knees against his chest and his feet curled under him. His head was resting on the arm of the sofa and it was evident – at least to Draco – that his husband had fallen asleep while watching the flames in the fireplace. Without a word, Draco crossed to his sleeping Adonis and gently stretched him out so he was taking up the entire thing. As smoothly as he could, he slid himself beneath the dark-haired head and began running his fingers through the mop, silently staring into the flames.
“Yes, Neogennito. My name is Kityantropia. Hogwarts is the name of this building, but that is the name of my soul being.” Tobias nodded.
Everyone watched in silence as the door handle slowly turned and the door inched open wide enough for a single person to slip out. The door was gently closed once again before Narcissa turned around.
He stopped at the edge of the willow and took a deep breath. Snapping his eyes open – when had he closed them? – He slowly spread the branches apart. He got his first glimpse of the area enclosed in the Willow’s protective embrace and almost allowed his jaw to drop.
There are parts to this  chapter that may, can and probably will be disturbing for some readers. If you or someone close to you has lost a child, then please proceed with caution. To put the rest of you at ease, it is mentioned in a discussion of the far past, it is NOT Tobias who looses the child.
“Well, I’m happy, and bubbly, and can’t stop grinning, bouncing or talking. Food sounds good right about now and I feel like I should be angry with you, but I can’t be bothered being upset at the moment.”
“Don’t think we don’t love you because we are saying this, Hermione,” her father said. “We love you so much you wouldn’t believe it, but we also believe that you have done something that deserves punishment, and we think – with what you’ve told us about the spells and the bands – that it could be only paid for with your life."
Draco sent a smile down at his bonded as he felt more than heard him sigh in contentment. It was then that the screaming started.
Draco was interrupted by a noise from the main sitting room. He and Tobias ran to it and opened the door slowly.
“Lastly, in the event that something is found that is neither safe enough to remain in the school or has no reason to be in the school in the first place and belongs to no one – as in it has been removed from its true owners care, we are willing to have it cleaned by a house-elf before having one of the Gringotts employees deliver it to you for valuing and selling. Profits will be split sixty-forty in favour of Hogwarts with the money going back into the Hogwarts vaults.”
“We will continue,” Achalendra stated, making both his daughters look at him in shock; Padma due to her Father doing the right thing and the opposite of what their mother would do and Pavarti because she had expected for the information to be given to her once again.
Shock ran across Severus’ face while the rest of the group looked puzzled. “What did you do to her?” he asked softly.
Trembling with fear, Ron started to struggle, screaming for help, not noticing that the ropes were being pulled tighter until he couldn’t move at all.
Stopping at the entrance of the dining room, Harry crossed his wrists, placed his fingertips to his shoulders and bowed, murmuring a prayer to the room.  Walking to Voldemort, he bowed deeply, until his forehead touched the ground and murmured a blessing before sitting on his legs and looked the man in the eye.
“No, I’m sure that is just what we need now,” Draco smiled, squeezing his husband’s hand. “After all, we haven’t made sure that the time in suspended time affected the growth of our little one.”
At ten o’clock exactly, Luna, Ginny and Neville disappeared without a sound and all lights bar fourteen candles went out. The candles were numbered one through seven and had either a pink or blue flame. The students followed the candles to their rooms, smiling at the still sleeping couple as they passed them. Before the sixth year students left the room, they transfigured the lounge into a bed with warm blankets and covered the sleeping couple, not knowing that the next morning would be the first time that Tobias would not be awake before everyone else.
Chuckles answered him. “That would be because all the books we need for this assignment are here in our dorm. How else did you think we could get the grades we do without going to the library?” Blaise chuckled.
Draco nodded. “I was very lethargic, I didn’t want to leave Tobias and I couldn’t concentrate. I also couldn’t stop myself from wanting to fall asleep every time I saw Bi.”
Draco started at him in shock and surprise.  Severus swore and marched to Lucius’ study door, a dazed Draco following him.  Once there, he rapped sharply on the door and pushed it forcefully open.
“Try not to move, Ray,” Harry soothed as he tore something. “I’ve got to immobilize your arm so the bones won’t move. I can heal the cuts and bruises but not the bones.”
“That’s nice,” Tobias muttered, not really paying attention. Minerva laughed softly and transfigured one of the quills on her desk into a blanket to cover the sleeping teen with. Running a gentle hand through the teen’s hair one last time, she returned to walking around the group who were working so diligently. She shook her head in dismay when she realised that of the four houses, only her own house was not represented.
“I think we should all eat now though,” Theo announced. “What do you want Draco, Bi? I’ll get it for you so you can both just sit and relax a bit.”
“Would it not be more … beneficial … for this meeting to take place after their examination?” she asked, choosing her words carefully.
A whistle made everyone look up at where the Dark Lord was, only to see Remus removing his fingers from his mouth since he’d gotten their attention.
Draco smiled and snuggled into the warmth behind him. “My point is, you are both powerful and dangerous, but underneath it all you are just a hopeless romantic.”
Pavarti’s jaw dropped and she silently left the room followed by a stern-faced Achalendra and a blank faced Padma though, Tobias was positive that a seductively sadistic gleam was present in the younger twin’s eye.
“If you’re waiting for me to jump up, you’re going to be waiting a long time. I’m quite comfortable where I am thank you, and I’m not moving til we have to go.”
“Dumbledore’s orders. If I was to discover who the Dark Lord’s heir was, I was to kill him so that Dumbledore could focus on destroying the life of the one named Harry Potter.” Remus, Severus and Voldemort growled. Tobias grinned and looked up at the Dark Lord.
Fred and George exchanged looks and turned their smirking faces at the now scared older man. “You have no idea just how happy you just made us, Lord,” The first twin grinned.
Half an hour later, Severus walked into the classroom, followed by three green students who gave Tobias a wide berth. Tobias just smirked at them. Draco raised an eyebrow to which Tobias just grinned.
Tobias eyed the adults critically before he handed them each a potion from his backpack. Severus bolted his without checking to see what it was. While the adults were calming down, Tobias had handed his new wand (black walnut, 13 and a half inches, slightly supple – Gossamer thread core) to Draco. He clapped his hands once, bowed his head and rubbed them together, slowly going faster.
Madam Pince turned and glared at the boy, but he just retuned her look with one of slight confusion and curiosity
“Why would I bother doing either when I would be getting rid of the dratted thing I was getting out in the first place?” she sneered.
“You forget, Xing Wu, that the people in this building who are in the most danger are CHILDREN,” she snapped the last word, making a few of the members sitting close to her wince slightly. “The children most endangered are SIXTEEN! My Susan’s age. Lord Patil’s twin daughters’ age. Lord Malfoy’s son’s age. Madam Greengrass’ grandchildren’s age and, if I miss my guess, the same age your niece was when she lost her betrothed and almost lost her life due to the boy’s own idiocy.”
Tobias chuckled and left with his and Neville’s ingredients, growling a warning at Lavender on the way. Tobias didn’t see Lavender smirk at him as he settled next to Neville, but Draco, Blaise and Severus did. Sev hoped that he had enough of his strongest calming draft left to douse Tobias if the stupid idiot of a female tried anything.
When Tobias didn’t arrive in time for dinner, Draco started to worry. After eating, he rushed back to the common room, hoping he would find Tobias there. The rest of the sixth year Slytherins followed him and froze in place when they saw their leader. He was curled up on an armchair, hair still wet from the shower and fast asleep.
“You lot go ahead. I’ll deal with Lykos.” He looked at the three elder members of the group. “Are you going to do as I suggested?” At their nods, he smiled. “Good. I’d hate to need to order you to do it.” He walked towards Remus, who yanked him into an empty classroom and then pulled him into a warm, but tight, embrace.
“Well,” Ginny started, looking at everyone in the carriage. “I don’t know about you lot, but I’m thinking of turning Voyeur – That was Damn Hot!”
Severus chuckled slightly. “I wouldn’t allow him near my books when he’s like this either.” He grunted slightly when a solid body ran into his.
“There are two problems I can see,” the Healer announced eventually. “You have a few blocks on your core that will need to be removed as soon as possible. I’m sorry to say that I can’t do anything about them due to their age.”
The mother and Father shared a loving look at the obvious connection the two newlyweds had. “Please, have a seat. We have much to discuss before the night can truly begin.”
With that, the rest of them nodded agreement and began eating, secure in the knowledge that one more of their Alpha’s enemy’s had been secured and was soon to be eliminated; and they would be right beside him every step of the way.
Harry, however, said, “Remus! I wondered when you’d get here; even though I’d have appreciated it if I had been told by you that you were fu…” he paused, before changing the word he was going to use, “dating my potions professor. If you’re wondering, I approve.” He swallowed the next potion before saying to the gob-smacked man in the doorway, “don’t worry, Remy. I’m not interested in him like that.” He turned to Severus.
Draco knocked tentatively on the door to his childhood bedroom before opening the door slightly. He gasped when he saw the bandages wrapped around Tobias’ hands. Tobias opened his eyes at the sound. Draco almost ran to his side, tears once more running down his cheeks.
Eyes sparkling with malicious intent, the old man leant over his desk – parchment and quill before him, to plan his attack.
“Stop!” Harry ordered in a firm voice, standing from his seat and not even bothering to hide the fact his dick was hard enough to use as a hammer. Draco froze instantly in the position he was in, holding it with the ease of someone who had perfect musculature conditioning. Without hesitation, Harry strode to where his Pet was and inspected him thoroughly.
The next morning everyone watched in bemusement as Tobias and Draco completed their morning ritual of courtship. Voldemort had a proud smirk on his face as he watched the exchange. The Pack, with the exception of the four elder Weasley’s just ignored them, as if this was a regular occurrence.
Tobias stood up and stretched to his full height. “Well, I guess this is goodbye for now.” He looked towards his pack. “We’ll see you at King’s Cross, same time, same place – the password is Phoenix Flame and touch the green flame.” He looked at the four Weasley men. “When it is time for a meeting, Thanatos will be there to flame you in.” He bowed to Severus. “We will see you at Hogwarts.” He hugged Remus, Lucius and Narcissa. “We’ll see you next time we are home.” He turned to his father. “Goodbye, Pateras. We’ll speak to you soon – try to convince Fudge that the sooner we get our NEWTs, the sooner you can ‘kill’ me without him getting the backlash of not doing anything to prepare me.”
“One more then I’ll leave. Question: What is the worst thing that can happen in a Potion’s Lab? Answer: Getting taught by Professor Snape while working with Slytherins and needing to touch icky squishy stuff.”
On the ground not too far away, he noticed his two mist-people companions gently rocking together, the older boy taking most of his sister’s weight as she seemed to drift between reality and the land on dreams.
Tom dropped the mix of herbs in alarm as Draco leapt to Tobias’ side and began attempting to calm him. After ten minutes, Tobias had calmed enough to start giving orders.
Tobias gave his husband a sheepish smile and took a bite from the bowl before him, which looked to contain lumpy glue. He let out a small pleased hum at the slight sweet spice of it.
Tobias curled up around the foot on him and growled deeply. Nothing made him angrier than someone threatening his family. Forcing himself to breathe through the pain he was experiencing and blocking out the old bastard’s words, he triggered his side of the bond he had with his phoenix.
Vince and Greg stood side by side in grey-green dress pants and crisp white shirts. In Greg’s hand was a scroll held together with a silver ribbon. He handed this to Draco. As Draco opened it, another rose appeared in his hand, a green ribbon wrapped around it.
“If we don’t remove them today, he will die. I can sense there are spells at work, but I can’t figure them out.  He bought it to my attention when he woke.  He asked…” Here he took a shuddering breath.
Tobias smiled. “I’m going to be a Mama!” Tobias counted to three mentally and giggled when the Earth Daemon’s eyes rolled back into his head and his knees gave out on him.
Everyone gaped at the sight of fourteen wolf-turned humans bowing to a Tobias who was surrounded by black and silver flames while his wand was covered in green and white flames. No one moved as the flames combined and leapt from Tobias to Voldemort then spread to the Death Eater bodies that had been placed in a line in the middle of the street.
Albus sat back in his chair, sucking on a lemon drop in glee. He had a plan, now all he had to do was wait. The portraits exchanged worried looks. They knew the Headmaster was insane, but to plan on doing that to any person, let alone a student, was unforgivable.
“Being an – as you put it – adequate brewer of potions, you will know that potions class is the most dangerous lesson in the entire school. The slightest slip in concentration at any stage in even the simplest of potions will cause a catastrophe. Therefore a teacher should be able to maintain control over the students in class. Professor Snape has the respect of the House of Snakes and most of the House of Ravens so he can be slightly less strict toward them as he knows that they will do as he says when he says. The rest of the students do not respect him, therefore, the only way he can control them is through fear. Rather fear a man for what he could do you then end up dead, buried and decomposing.”
For the first time in his life, Godric thought before he responded. Looking into the youth’s eyes, he saw intelligence and power. He also knew that the only way Raithia would let anyone in was through a willingly given sacrifice of their own blood. He would have to answer all their questions, but he had a feeling that he would have no problem in giving his approval to the youngster.
Eventually all teams had been chosen and Tobias transfigured a large chalkboard and its necessities out of a few sticks that had been gathered for the small fire that was burning in an empty drum.
Draco caught Severus’ eye and performed a reverse legilimens, putting the memory of that morning into his mind. When it got to when Draco opened his eyes to see the rose, Severus’ eyes widened. At Draco’s slow nod, Severus fainted. Draco cast an enervate on his professor just as someone knocked on the door. Draco opened it while Severus shakily stood. Both their jaws dropped at the sight before them.
Severus walked into his classroom, only to see the one person he didn’t want to see anywhere near a cauldron.
He absent-mindedly reached for the cup of tea that the transfiguration professor handed to him and took a decent mouthful, disregarding the temperature of it.
He gently un-hooked Draco from the table and carried him into the bathroom attached to the room. Once he had the blonde undressed and in the hot water of the bath, he woke him up with an enervate.
Draco and Severus blinked in shock as Tobias lay his head back onto Severus’ shoulder and went slack, causing Severus to almost drop him due to the increase of weight.
The door opened and everyone gaped. Severus Snape stood to one side with a sulking Tobias held bridal style in his arms. On the other side of the doorway stood a man that none of the students had seen before. It was the three in the middle, however, that caught everyone’s attention. Luna Lovegood was standing – albeit shakily- -  with an arm around the shoulders of a very familiar pair of twins. Twins that were wearing pin-striped suits, shoes and hats that wouldn’t look out of place on the set of a music video for ‘Smooth Criminal’ or ‘Bad Bad Leroy Brown’.
Severus nodded, numb with shock. He started unblinking as Tom gently raised the sleave of his left arm and stroked the mark softly hissing. Within moments, the black mark disappeared leaving unmarked skin behind. Severus swallowed the lump in his throat as a thick platinum chain with a pendant that was the perfect blend of the Riddle and Slytherin coat of arms was placed in his hand.
Severus nodded and gave up on his meal as he yawned once more. He slowly made his way to his rooms, stopping to talk to a few Slytherins to inform everyone he was to be left alone until tomorrow. With a smile and nod to The Pack, he left the Hall. The letter from Remus could wait for the following day – his bed was calling for him.
Tobias and Draco stood and walked to the portrait. “Good morrow, Sir. We have much to discuss. May I request the company of your three companions to be present for this discussion?”
All of them became aware only when their fingers were wrapped around a chilled glass. Without thinking, they all took a mouthful and were bought to an immediate, spluttering awareness.
“I present to you Messer’s Fred, George, Bill, Charlie and Miss Ginevra Weasley.” As each of their names was called, they bowed or curtseyed to the man seated before them. “Friends, this is my adopted father, Tom Marvolo Riddle. I am no longer Harry James Potter. On September the first, I am legally going to be Tobias Regulas Riddle. I shall be going under the name of Black while I still attend Hogwarts or until Dumbledore, Granger and Weaselby are destroyed – whichever comes first.”
“Father. If no one can find Tobias or I tomorrow, would you be able to tell them that we are alright? We are going for a picnic in the gardens.”
Tobias hugged the man as best he could without disturbing his daughter. “Love you Pateras,” he whispered. “I’ll talk to Dobby about coming with us.”
“Incendio,” a voice hissed. Everyone stopped panicking and looked at the teen that was glaring at the man who held his Father under that curse. In one hand he held his wand and in the other was a black and silver flame and his face was one that everyone in the Pack, as well as every married man, was familiar with.
They watched in silence as his eyes rolled into the back of his skull and collapsed. Lucius and Severus waited for Tobias to leave, then both grabbed for the book. After reading it, they looked at each other and sat on their chairs, thinking it might be safer to let their Lord wake up naturally.
“Ah, there you are Minerva!” a very unwelcome voice said. “And you found two of our missing students. I’m going to assume that you will handle their punishment?”
“The reason was different to what I thought it would be. It turned out the Headmaster convinced Mr Weasley and Miss Granger to aid him in controlling Harry Potter. She gave me the full list of curses the three of them threw at him. She also told me that while he was in a drug-induced sleep, they proceeded to put bondage bands on his person.”
Hope you all enjoy this chapter. I will admit that when I originally wrote this I needed a few tissues, but that could be because I took part of it from my own experiences. Not fun at all.
Tobias screamed his release moments before Draco howled his. Once Draco had recovered, he pulled out and pushed a small magical vibrator in the empty hole. Tobias squeaked and glared at Draco in reproach when he untied him.
Severus smiled as Tobias made his way to Narcissa, bowed and kissed her hand before kneeling and hiding his face on her lap as she gently ran fingers through his hair.
Amelia had easily agreed, much to the annoyance of the Healer working with her. It took Amelia asking the woman if she was a specialist Healer in the field of male pregnancy. At the negative answer, Amelia snorted and turned away, knowing the prideful youngster fully understood what she was getting at.
“That is why Fabien and Gideon Prewitt were our top Aurors, and why they always were partnered together. When question a twin under a spell or with truth serum, we need to douse both of them because their magic splits it between the two of the evenly, making it useless if done incorrectly.” Amelia snorted. “I agree with Fred.”
The councilmen and women chuckled as they moved towards their assigned tents where the Healers waited with the remaining fifth years.
The walked for another five minutes in near silence before Draco guided him to a seat. He could barely contain his excitement – damn hormones! He fidgeted slightly as he waited for the blindfold to be removed. When it was, he stared around him in wonder. The room they were in glowed a soft pearlescent gold in the light of a thousand and one candles. The picture frames that doted the room gleamed silver and Draco’s hair seemed to be made of liquid moonbeams.
“I’ve got some information to write down for the next meeting,” Ginny said as she stretched, “then Luna and I will be spending the night having a sleep-over in the Room of Requirement. Everyone in Gryffindor refuses to talk to me and some of the girls are getting very bitchy with me – mostly muggleborn and those too young to understand what happened and why.”
He gave a short bark of laughter. “The summer I made Vernon’s sister into a helium balloon was when I let the Dragon out to play – Rage and Protection, the rules of all Dragons.” He gave a half-smirk in Draco’s direction, causing the blonde youth to blush slightly. “There has been many times in my past that I was punished for ‘acting more like a freak than usual’.” He shook his head, thinking.
“You are lucky, Rodent. You are so lucky Pateras has my sworn word that I will not harm you without permission from him. If he did not, you would be so dead right now.”
Severus stretched with a half-smile as the area behind his ear gave a small throb, reminding him of what had occurred earlier that day. He frowned, however, when he hand encountered nothing beside him. Sitting up, he blinked at the sight of the parchment on Remus’ pillow. Hesitantly, he opened it to reveal a short note that had him shaking his head with a smile on his face.
Amelia raised an eyebrow, wondering why she had been asked to remain when the teen had everything under control.
“No Honey, not at all. I only asked because the post is going to be arriving soon and Father is sending me a load of paperwork to look over about the businesses he is going to hand over to me when we graduate. Mother mentioned that she had a care package ready to send to you today and Miss Perks mentioned that her sister was sending the stuff I asked for a few days ago, so we should get that today as well. Not to mention items that your Father, Remus, the Twins and Gringotts sent to both of us on an almost daily basis, as well as the Daily Profit, the Quibbler and the muggle newspapers you asked to be supplied with. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be buried under all of that. Can you imagine Father’s reaction if Severus was to owl him saying that I had been buried under my paperwork?”
He gave a tiny half-smile. “I’ve even had a large black dog and various were-creatures. In fact, I think the only creature I haven’t yet had as a guardian is a lion. “When I suppress my need to do magic, or when I don’t use magic for a long time, I start to act like any one of the guardians.”
“Drink all of it, Harry. You need all the rest you can get to aid your body in healing itself, but drink this one first.” He handed him a potion that looked and smelt like cherry syrup.  When Harry looked at him in surprise and asked why he needed a deep numbing potion with blood replenishing and heavy duty healing and nutrient potion elements, Severus’ eyes widened in surprise. Harry grinned and downed the potions, one after the other.
Looking at his young charge, Sev faltered. “I guess you can – but I’ve got to insist on you seeing Poppy first.”
The twins drew their wands and silently sent spell after spell at the woman until she was hidden in a sparkling putrid yellow cloud that smelt of over-ripe pineapple. A high-pitched scream came from the cloud just before it dispersed to reveal the new and improved Deloris.
“They know what to look for and are exempt from the Oaths we have needed to give since they were added as a precaution,” Fred explained.
“Well, Miss Parkinson, it’s like this. My Neogennito here is rather territorial and with what happened with a house-elf forced him to eat, I’m afraid the house-elves believe they will be – how was it put? Oh yes, ‘Made into leather and sold to the highest bidding fat and sweating muggle so that he can use them to protect his testicles from being damaged the next time he decided to go to that gay club and while he’s at it make them into a nice penis and arse crack warmer just for the fun of it’. And if that didn’t work, then he’d order them to make themselves willing conspirators of S.P.E.W – some house-elf organization that the Granger girl created.”
“I see congratulations are in order,” she grinned as she spied the now sleeping bundle in Draco’s arms. “She’s beautiful.”
Smirking, Ginny explained to her brothers how she and Luna were looking for Double-tailed Xansprites in New Zealand. As the twins laughed hard enough to need the support of their older brothers, the two girls shared a look that would have made the four men shudder in fear. They had an idea for their first official victim – the way they would announce their presence. They would bring fear to the hearts of the wizarding world before bringing about peace. Things must become worse before they could become better.
Severus arrived several moments later to find a silent common room. He smiled to himself when he saw his godsons asleep in each other’s arms. He had a suspicion that neither had gotten much sleep while they were away. He cleared his throat softly so he didn’t disturb the two sleeping students.
Draco chuckled softly. “No, we aren’t on a stage and our audience is leaving.” He shot them a warning look. “They were here because Father couldn’t handle seeing us in this rather lovely position.”
“I’ll go get The Pack and see if Thanis will take us. Greg or Vince can take “Bi from you if you wish.”
“That’s true and we did get permission from the resident herd to use their image … I’m still apologising though.”
When one of the wolves had Ron’s wand in its jaws, Luna changed back and walked towards him. “I am under my own power as you know – or should know – that spells to control others don’t work when either of them is in animagus form. And I support Tobias with 100% of my own will.” She leaned in closer to him and cast a spell that blocked his ability to speak of what she was going to say.
The silence in the room acted like a malevolent presence as the parchment continued to flow from Algernon’s wand. Tobias blinked at it with no interest while Draco, Lucius and Amelia glared at it and everyone else gaped as a small mountain was formed from the – now complete – list.
“Marriage contract!” Pavarti yelped. “That’s why we are here? For a marriage contract? With them?” she pointed to the still shocked red-headed twins. “I can’t marry one of them! They aren’t cute or rich or even heirs of their family!”
Lucius nodded. “Yes, Cissa. I do believe it is his doing. He is a dangerous and most powerful wizard – but he still manages to stay innocent. He has all the qualities of the Founders, and he doesn’t lose them – Even when he was punishing Bella, he still managed to remain innocent and sweet.” Lucius shook his head in amused exasperation. “I just wish I knew how!”
Smiling at each other, they looked at their plates. Tobias licked his lips at the venison en croute with herb pancakes and side salad. Draco watched as Tobias shivered with pleasure when the first bit hit his tongue. He agreed as he’d had the same reaction.
Amelia smiled widely. “Thank you for explaining it to me, Severus. I have only one more thing to say before you can go. Mr Longbottom wishes for you to read this before you leave the room.” She handed the still sealed letter to the man and looked away politely while he read its content.
“You sure you’re not saying that due to jealousy?” Pansy teased, knowing her friend was completely asexual.
Abstract: Harry runs the wizarding world with a firm, but fair hand – it isn’t until he is safely in his own home that he can reveal just who he really is.
Booph smirked – a particularly evil look on the Shadow Daemon. “Our contracts say ‘killing’ not ‘torture’, Akzant’tra.”
No one in the Hall took any notice of the Slytherin’s after they had entered as their attention was on something … or someone … else. Their attention was caught up in the person seated between the Headmaster and the Transfiguration Professor.
Tobias felt his body tense as a huge wave of pressure flowed from the pit of his stomach, through his tightened sac and out of his extremely sensitive head.
“I’m sorry,” Severus stated, “I think I am hearing things. I thought I just heard you say you wanted to end the war within the next two days.”
“What gave us away?” Fred asked with a roll of his eyes “The multi-coloured owl, the parchment that burst into glitter, itching powder and water droplets when lit on fire or the two distinct hand writings on the envelop?”
“First time at the Manor since the wedding,” Draco explained to the questioning raised eyebrow of his godfather.
Two hours later, a pair of soft lips brushing against his woke Draco up. Smirking internally, Draco pretended to still be asleep, wanting to see what happened. The shy lips touched his once more and Draco heard a soft whimper come from Tobias’ throat. Waiting for Tobias’ lips to touch his once more, Draco pounced, grinning at the small squeak that escaped Tobias’ lips, before cutting it off with a gentle – but insistent – kiss.
“Neogennito? Your father said no more threatening to feed people to Nagini,” Remus reminded the pregnant teen, almost regretfully.
Before anyone could react, one of the boys of The Pack stood from his place and strode confidently to where the group stood. Stopping, he raised an eyebrow at the three and bowed, extending a hand.
“Excuse me, Madam Pince,” Tobias stated almost hesitantly. I hope you don’t mind me asking, but why isn’t there an area of the library set aside for groups wanting to work together?”
Lucius shook his head in amusement as he read Draco’s weekly letter. It seemed like Tobias wasn’t too far gone in his hormones that he was throwing things yet. It seemed to him that his son had lucked out on that front. The elder blonde man sighed heavily. He wished that his son and son-in-law could be removed from under the old coot’s thumb, but until the NEW results came through, but were stuck there. It didn’t mean he had to like it though.
He shook his head slightly. At first, he hadn’t believed Lucius when he’d told him about the summer, but when he had viewed the memories in the pensieve; he hadn’t been able to control his laughter.
Harry gave a grin that had the hairs on the backs of everyone’s necks stand on end. “But Pettigrew … him I NEED to kill. He broke a wizard bond. I saved his life and he repaid me by getting Sirius killed. I told him a month before the first vision of Sirius that I wanted an audience with you to discuss the possibility of me, Siri and Remy joining you, but he went against it, and I want his blood!”
‘This should do the trick,” he muttered as he pulled out a plain brown packet. He opened it to reveal a dull purple-grey powder. “I just add a little pulse of magic …” He pushed a small amount of his magic into the pinch he placed into his palm until a soft glow came from it.
Draco shook his head and snuggled back under his blankets, falling asleep almost instantly. Tobias watched him for a little while before leaving for the Snake Pit.
“Your father was sorry that he could not be here to tell you himself, but as you know it is not safe for him to be seen just yet. Due to this, he wishes for you to choose the name you wish to complete your studies under, since it is not safe for either of you for you to go under your legal name. This will be the name in all your records until neither of you are in danger from a certain psychopath.”
“Not as amazing as this will be,” Harry smiled as he started to undo the buckles on the device Draco was still wearing.
For those who are familiar with this story, the next chapter is the one many of you are probably looking forward to, for those who aren't ... You'll just have to wait for tomorrow night my time to see what I'm on about. and Ann, luv? try not to destroy any eardrums tomorrow morning XD
Before Severus knew what was happening, he was seated in the Dark Lord’s study with Remus beside him and Lucius stepping out of the floo.
Harry glanced at the Dark Lord and receiving a nod, smirked. “Well, I am the Founder’s Heir,” he drawled, sounding much like Draco. “In all points of Law, I own Hogwarts, amongst other things. I am to claim them when I return, so Hogwarts is now in our possession, without any bloodshed. I have also had a large magical boost and have some other gifts that should start making themselves noticeable once I return to my holdings. Professor? May I complete my test now?”
Draco grimaced. “I wish I was. Two days ago he had a pumpkin, asparagus and beet smoothie made on half soy milk and half chicken broth.”
The mostly asleep red head giggled as he was tickled by what his mind told him was wool as a soft woollen blanket surrounded him.
“Yes.  And there is only one person that has had contact with him to place it. One Albus Dumbledore.”
“Tell me how it reacts when you use it,” she said with a slight smile. “Once you use it, it will only respond to you.”
Nodding, the Slytherins settled around the room in silence. After a few moments, Tobias spoke again. “What are we doing this fine weekend?”
“This goes for your behaviour towards your fellow student as well,” Xing Wu stated from his spot in the line. “Each group will hold at least one student of each house. If we even suspect that someone was attacked in any way due to the house they were in or because of something equally stupid, then you will be punished by one of us. Several members of upper and lower years have already been given the times for their punishment.”
The door opened and he felt his eyes being drawn to it. He watched in awed amusement at how The Pack walked in, protecting their Lord’s son.
Tobias shook his head and closed his eyes. “It started when I started being punished for doing magic. I always believed that no one came to my cupboard because they didn’t care. Well, that was partially true.” He looked up at Severus. “What you witnessed when you found me? There is a reason he never had the chance to do that before this summer. My magic kept anyone who wished to harm me away from where I was the most vulnerable. The longer the protective magic was around me, the closer it bonded with me - not as my own magic, but as a magical entity, it developed into a guardian for me. This guardian was always a carnivorous animal, but was never the same animal two days running. Sometimes it would be a wolf, then a big cat, reptile, bird or fish. I’ve had serpents – including basilisks – Dragons, gryphons, hippogriffs.”
Someone cleared their throat and Draco jumped, scared out of his thoughts. Looking up, he smiled slightly at his father.
When the lesson had ended, Severus watched his godsons closely in case something gave him a clue as to what was going on with the blonde boy. He blinked, startled. That didn’t just happen, did it? No … No it couldn’t have … He was just imagining things. Wasn’t he? A soft cough drew his attention to the blonde boy before him.
Harry instantly transformed back into his human self, his face still covered in blood and his green eyes glowed in his face. He was still growling.
‘But nothing – NOTHING- is more terrifying than hearing a muggle nursery rhyme sun in a dreamy, innocent voice while knowing that the woman it belongs to has a mid that is made for torture,’ Neville thought as he joined into the song.
He was once more attacked by a person throwing their arms around him. “HI SEVIE!” He turned his head slightly, only to come fact-to-face with a red-eyed Demon-man. He yelped, causing everyone to laugh. The demon pouted, as did the young man on his other side.
After a few moments 12 ‘yeses’ sounded, as well as The Pack’s resounding “Yes Beta.” Draco nodded and removed his hands from his face.
“If you were here, Frank, you would be proud of him, for there is no doubt that he is your son. None at all.”
Fifteen minutes later he returned with a large plate of cold turkey and pasta salad. Ginny, Narcissa and Pansy giggled at the hum of appreciation that came from him. Remus chuckled when he noticed that Draco couldn’t keep his eyes off of his husband’s face.
Harry was pleased to see Draco shake his head, even as he struggled to get enough air into his lungs through his nostrils. In a move that took a lot of practice, Harry spun Draco around while he was still imbedded in his arse and carried him to a nearby desk. At seeing where he was being taken, Draco started breathing heavier and writhing in place.
“Who is the chosen bride?” Grapplefang asked once more, impressed that the young wizard before him understood the necessity of the ritualised form of conduct.
“Are you planning on having more?” an unknown female voice bought Tobias’ attention back to the present.
Narcissa walked calmly into the sitting room where her husband was almost bouncing, something that scared her as he never bounced – Malfoys do not bounce! “Calm down, dearest. Now, tell me this news.”
After plunging the slick muscle into his husband’s depths several more times, Draco removed it and slithered up the tanned body until he reached his husband’s ear. “Did you like that? Did you like the feeling of my tongue pushing into you?” he whispered heatedly.
Raithia bowed deeply to the blonde and the portrait opened slowly. Tobias walked in without a sound. A sharp intake of breath soon followed as the members of his pack noticed the surrounding. Tobias grinned manically as he looked around.
Theo and Pansy exchanged amused looks before moving until they were at a respectful distance from the loved-up couple.
Tom sat in his favourite chair with a cup of tea in his hand, listening to Remus, Lucius and Narcissa discuss what had to be done now that there was a baby on the way when a cold chill ran up his spine. His jaw dropped when he saw four owls with smoking red envelops heading towards his manor.
“You’re awake!” a cheerful voice called out before he could panic “It was a struggle to get the both of you into bed this morning.”
Hermione curled up on the chair in the Gryffindor common room, tears rolling down her face. She had managed to write half of the assignment up before she’d broken down. She hoped with all her heart that Harry would forgive her, but deep down she knew that Harry no longer existed and that the boy who had replaced him would never accept her apology. She didn’t know how she knew, but she knew for certain that she would die by the end of the year – and there was nothing she could do about it.
“TOBIAS!” Lucius, Severus and Minerva shouted as Draco leaped forwards and slowed the slightly younger male’s fall.
Tom stood in the doorway, watching his son. Silently he walked in and laid a hand on his shoulder. “Sickle for your thoughts?”
Tobias bowed back to the Goblin, making sure it was noticeably deeper than the one the goblin gave him. “It is us who owe you and your kin thanks Master Goblin,” the dark-haired teen responded, “for guiding us through this period at such short notice.”
“You say ‘the Light’ like you aren’t in it, Minerva,” Amelia stated. “Is there something you would like to tell us?”
Zog nodded his agreement. “He’s right. As well as this, once you are integrated into the Garden’s wards, you will lose the protection we gave you as a babe. You will have the mother’s protection and will therefore no longer need ours, however, one of your guardians will remain with you while another will become your animagus form. We do not know which ones they will be, but they will probably be the two that have attached themselves to you the most.”
A robustly built middle-aged Indian Gentleman swathed in traditional golden brown robes stepped forward, pressed his palms together and bowed slightly, murmuring something not many people managed to catch.
“He then ‘reminded’ me of the detentions I had given to the three boys, stating he would ‘find someone else to cover them’ while I ‘recovered’ form a slight dizzy spell. He also said some very … disturbing things about Tobias and the child he is carrying. I needed to know if I had been obliviated before by him due to learning something he didn’t like.”
Severus, Lucius, Remus and Narcissa hid their grins at the lecture, having been through one before, but not even they could hide their astonishment when their Lord bowed his head in shame and whispered, “Yes Alpha.”
“I have two of my Pack intending to start going through the rooms of Hogwarts from top to bottom as soon as I give the go ahead. It is vital that no magic is used in the gathering and transporting of the rooms content. That is when I will need the two manual workers: one to aid my Pack members and one to transport the content filled boxes to me from the room the boxes will be stored in.”
The Pack either smirked or rolled their eyes as Lucius gave a shallow bow with his right hand fisted over his heart.
When the Howlers were nothing but ash, the four of them gulped. They had only two days in which to gain Severus’ forgiveness before their lives were forfeit.
“People like what?” Remus asked, bringing both Professors’ attention to him, Tom, Lucius and Narcissa.
Behind Tobias and Draco stood three identical black-haired, silver eyed men who resembled their Grandpa Lucius more than their father. They were Orion, Jaxon and Domnic. Tobias had been unlucky to have fallen pregnant with triplets the year Melody had turned five and no one, not even the infamous Weasley twins, were game enough to push the pregnant man’s buttons.
Blaise nodded once firmly. “It is what I wish to happen. Unlike the other members of The Pack, I have never had the desire to father a child – and even though I enjoy sex, I don’t need to love my partner to be able to do it. Also, if I am disinherited, then I will have no name, no property, no money and no family history to give to any female that I might meet. I would rather be Blaise of The Pack than just Blaise.” He smirked at a thought. “And being bonded to The Pack won’t stop me from sleeping with females who aren’t of The Pack.”
“It comes as no surprise to me that Luna and Pansy won today,” Blaise said, shaking his head with a defeated smile. “Both are beautiful, intelligent women with a very sadistic outlook that seems to complement and build between them.”
The Snake Pit rang with a girlish giggling. “You are the charmer, young Neogennito, just like Salazar.” The voice grew serious. “I thought I should inform you that Miss Ginevra Weasley wishes to speak to you, and that the Headmaster is planning his next move. This time his target is the potions professor. He is going to try to alienate you from everyone surrounding you.”
“Then don’t look now because that ‘divine intervention’ is looking to be beginning now,” Severus said, eyes glittering with amusement.
Both Tobias and the contract glowed silver, fulfilling the last requirement of the adoption process.
Lucius hide a grimace in his nod. “I did indeed Derrin. This is her.” He waved a hand in Deloris’ direction. “Before you look her over, there are some things to go over.”
Draco sat in his usual seat at the Slytherin Table eating as though he was desperate to get somewhere. Those in the other houses watched him wearily as they took note of Tobias’ absence. Many people incorrectly believed that the medical exam on the ex-Gryffindor had discovered anther nefarious plot against the boy or the child he carried and every one of them vowed to stay out of the blonde’s way.
“WHAAAAAT!” everyone shrieked before quickly putting everything in a pile on the tables before them and running for the door. There was a new Pack member on the way and they had to be there to welcome them.
Ash drifted down over the students, the only thing left of the boy-who-lived. Draco, Severus and Lucius were rooted to the spot as the ash drifted over them as well. This wasn’t a part of the plan, as far as they knew.
Tobias’ eyes changed to chips of emerald. “And I cannot believe that the head of Slytherin house acts more like a Gryffindor first year.
Voldemort stopped dancing and released his victim, I mean dance partner. “Yes he did! Isn’t it amazing? I wouldn’t be surprised if the boy proposes soon!”
Everyone looked at the wall and watched as a very familiar redhead paid a first year to slip the herbs to Tom without him knowing.
“Fine,” “Tobias said. “I’ll have to wait until Anadochos is present before getting Draco to jump me.”
Tobias nodded once and turned to the crowded common room. “Let’s go.” The Slytherins organised themselves into their year levels and walked in an orderly fashion to the Great Hall. Tobias smirked. It wouldn’t be long before it was announced to the school of their engagement then the fun would really begin!
“He is,” a sleepy voice said from the door to Severus’ room. “He hides a lot of things from a lot of people and not all of those things are his to share.”
When they finally had handed in their work, the three boys sat at the table and nibbled on the food the Malfoy house elf and bought Tobias.
Within moments, Tobias had been reduced to a quivering pile of goo once more. If you were to ask him later how he still managed to thrust in time with Draco, he wouldn’t have been able to answer.
Both men were aware that they had the full attention of the class on them. Fighting the urge to drown himself in the potion, Tobias raised the goblet to his lips. Once the taste of it hit his tongue, Tobias lost all control and guzzled it down, red streaks of liquid running out the sides of his mouth and down his throat. This is what he needed more than anything.
“Hello yourself, Kyria,” Neville whispered back. “I thought you might like a guide in the Lion’s den. I also thought you might like someone to help control Weasley.”
Severus stopped talking and hissed slightly as his dark mark burned. He paled and strode to the front of the room. “I have someplace I have to be now. This class is dismissed for the day. For Monday, I expect you to have completed the work for this lesson, including the recipe for Monday’s double lesson. The next two chapters are to be read and you are to hand in a four and a half foot essay on what causes the differences in the types of healing potions we are going to be making with examples. Dismissed!”
“That promise stands, no matter what – even if I need to get on my hands and knees in the Great Hall in the middle of the welcoming feast and beg. And Bi?” He waits until the boy is looking at him again. “If you don’t go, you’ll never get to see me with red and gold hair.”
With a snarl of frustration, Harry watched the last of the liquid drip out, leaving his blonde-haired Pet visibly itching and vibrating with pleasure as the small metal balls stated to release the lubricant that was spreading the electric current out from its housing.
Tobias answered for him, keeping both eyes on his godfather. “Bambi is a children’s movie a wizard made for the entertainment of muggles. This wizard’s name was Walter Disney – better known as Walt Disney,” Tobias stretched, ignoring the gasps of surprise from The Pack. “Bambi is the story of a fawn … Let’s just say that it is so sweet and cutesy that it would even give Lavender Brown a toothache to watch it.”
Tom smirked and raised the glasses, revealing azure eyes. Tobias walked to him before almost throwing himself into the waiting arms of the older man.
“Come on, time to continue the meeting if the children are to be back by a decent time.” Everyone nodded and returned to their seats, ready for the next part of the meeting.
“Lykos, sit Pateras down and keep him sat! Kyria, get the smoke of the white sage surrounding him. Ateria, Ateros hit him with iced water when Kyria is finished. Nonos, I don’t care how you do it, but destroy them herbs without fire IMMEDIETLY.! Anadochos, when you leave, I want you to search every manor Pateras visits for more of them and get rid of it with the same rules as Nonos – and burn white sage in every room of each Manor – just to be certain.”
“So you do remember me!” the disembodied voice said tinged with happiness, “How wondrously delightful! I’m afraid to say it, but you won’t be seeing my beautiful knives today. I’ve had to put them away so I can sharpen them; so instead, I invited a friend along to play with us. He doesn’t say much, but he has an amazing voice. I’m sure that the two of you will get along just marvellously.”
The twins shook their heads with a grin. “No, Algernon managed to dilute everything in our blood enough that it will be flushed out of our bodies. He’s promised to give us the recipe for the potion he used so we can take it between testings.”
“I don’t know why they did it Harry. I cannot tell you why they did what they did, but I will tell you right now that you will never, ever again go through that.  You are safe here, and I will do everything I can to make sure you survive through this year.  I do not need you to make an unbreakable, but I will take you up on the offer to get inside your head,” he joked lightly.
Draco smiled warmly at his betrothed, notifying all who could see him that he believed he had someone special. Severus secretly had to agree. Maybe it was time for him to seek courtship of a certain wolf.
“Scotch,” Minerva answered in her usual no nonsense tone. “A muggle drink that is around forty percent alcohol.” The six purebloods watched in undisguised interest as Minerva swallowed her half-glass in one go without reacting to the fumes that they were sure could strip the polish – as well as most of the wood – from their wands.
The wall hiding the Snake Pit opened as he approached, allowing him entrance as the Head of House. He blinked as he entered to find … Chaos.
“Back to what we were saying. Bi has to still act as if he’s Harry, so even though he wants to be with his marked ones, it might be better if only Draco, Crabbe and Goyle search him out, as you normally do. He also requests that whatever happens tonight, just go with it and act like you’d normally do. You’d better get on the train now. We’ll see you on either the first Hogsmead weekend, or when you visit your parents for the holidays – whichever comes first.” Then they were gone.
Severus watched slack-jawed as every single teacher in the room pledged their allegiance to his godson, even knowing – or suspecting – that Tobias was in league with the dark. Wait until Tom heard about this!
Grapplefang laughed in amusement. “We don’t take offense at pregnant beings of any species. It’s safer for us that way.”
His thoughts then turned to the male that was missing. When the girls had left, Draco had pushed everyone out of their chamber and locked them out – including him. He wanted to be angry with him – or upset at the least – but he was too comfortable to care much and before he knew it, he was fast asleep.
She paused long enough to fluidly plunge the blade she held into his left forearm. “The guard is responsible for stopping the blade form eating a hole straight through your body.” She revealed the base and guard of another blade and lovingly caressed them within Ronald’s line of sight. “See these ruins? They are responsible for holding the entire weapon together without any of the individual magic’s attacking the others. Each ruin contains nearly 300 perfect tiny emeralds and each blade has six ruins on them. The guards are formed from the shoulder bone of the Lord Stallion of a Thestral herd. It just happens to be the only substance strong enough to balance the rest of the materials.”
Severus found the blonde youth in the library curled up in front of the fire. With him were Blaise, Pansy, Ginny and Neville.
Starting to move to the music, Tobias allowed himself to melt into Draco’s embrace. “This is wonderful, Draco. I think we should do stuff like this more often.”
Neville chuckled. “She’s got us there.” He shook his head in amusement. It was so easy to underestimate the young blonde girl, but she was in Ravenclaw for a reason – something the Pack normally had no trouble remembering. Neville privately blamed their forgetfulness on the revelation of just how scary a place Luna’s mind really was.
“Hold on a moment. Why is he an EX-employee of St Mungos?” Draco asked, eyes narrowed as he moved so he was between his husband and the man.
“When you have eaten all of you come by my office. I will need to check up on Miss Lovegood to see if she needs another blood replenisher a.” He looked at the awake and aware Pack members sternly, his eyes telling them to look after the blonde girl.
Tobias’ eyes changed to an intense deep burgundy. With a wave of his hand, he sent a naked Ron hanging upside down from a beam situated in the centre of the owlery. A knife appeared in Tobias’ hand. Almost absent-mindedly, he placed the tip of the blade into his mouth and sucked it.
They were rewarded by the sight of Minerva’s lips thinning in irritation. Tobias smirked in triumph. It was working just as he planned; No one had noticed the Weasley switch.
Both girls had blossomed into wonderful women, and he had noticed that both of them had caught the attention of a young male of The Pack. He smirked internally as he mentally planned out a letter and report to his father. If he had his way, his four females would be married and mated by this time next year – and the remaining males well on the way to obtaining a match.
He was shocked out of his musings by a hand landing on his shoulder, preventing him from walking into a bush. Ten minutes later, Tobias walked up to them from the Forbidden Forest. He shook both escorts’ hands before bowing and extending his arm to Draco. Smiling, Draco accepted the arm and the two of them watched Vince and Greg made their way back to the castle – and their own dinner.
People in the class that caught onto what wasn’t said stared at the dark-haired teen with horror. They couldn’t believe what they were hearing – who would do that to Harry Potter of all people?
Theo looked at the two of them with a slight frown. “Alpha? Just so they understand, I think you should show them.”
“You have our acceptance youngster. It has been far too long since someone has been able to beat him in a verbal confrontation.” She smiled. “Am I right in believing you are one of our heirs?”
Looking at the time, the happy family left the hall and headed to the Dungeons, leaving a still shocked hall behind them.
“I’m not interested in his sex life, sweetie,” Narcissa said, her voice holding the same consistency and sweetness of syrup, making the two elder men wince. “I am interested to know if my son-in-law is going to use my son’s weaknesses against him in the bedroom – and the best way for me to punish him if I find out that he has done so.”
After a half hour, Tobias and Draco rose. The rest of The Pack, Remus and Severus, followed them closely. Neville, Luna and Ginny remained seated in a pre-ordained wish of their Alpha’s. Ten minutes after they left, Neville made the suggesting they go to the Library to complete their session.
Harry swallowed an angry sigh as he was once again ambushed by a troupe of reporters all clambering for his attention as he left his office in the Ministry building the day before he started his week-long leave.
Draco rushed to his husband’s side, feeling slightly ashamed of how he had handled the situation before pushing it aside. He might not like it, but sometimes you needed to be blunt to get through his husband’s stubbornness. He silently picked his shaking husband up and carried him from the room, followed by an equally silent Pack.
“You know I don’t,” Minerva playfully scolded. “Pack up your papers and rest a while. Either I or Draco will wake you in time for morning tea.”
He clenched his eyes shut as tight as they would go in an attempt to ignore – or hide; he wasn’t sure which – the tune. He jumped and screamed when something touched him.
Ron screamed as he and the remaining bits of the gold and silver bridge plummeted down towards jagged rocks. Just before he hit the ground, Ron closed his eyes tight.
Seeing that their charge was asleep and seemed to be inclined to stay that way, the three men separated. Tom to his rooms, Severus to Snape Manor, a frantic werewolf and a sulking blonde youth and Lucius to Malfoy Manor and his wonderful wife.
“Go and eat,” the man told the group. “I’ll take him back with me to my rooms. You won’t be much good for him if you start missing meals as well,” he stated calmly as Draco opened his mouth.
“If that is the case with Tobias,” Draco said dryly, “then I beg leave of you to go find myself the materials to build a weapon that is much deadlier than a wand. Tobias is acting like an innocent being; going so far as to blush and gape when he saw me naked … and he squeaked when I hopped into the bath with him. If that is how my son or daughter is going to act, along with having a combination of my and Tobias’ looks, then we are going to have to beat suitors off with a stick.”
Tobias looked at Draco, who nodded slightly. Both boys slowly unbuttoned their shirts and pulled them off. Turning their backs on the room, they heard a deep intake of breath. In a space the size of a palm between their shoulder blades was their bonding mark. A silver dragon wrapped in a black and gold snake, holding a black green and blue phoenix all protected by an Earth Daemon’s claws.
“No, Alpha. I was just reading about the bond you and Drakontas have formed, and it appears that you have a partial creature bond with a soul mate bond.” Murmuring broke out amongst those surrounding them, but when they saw the slight smiles on the lips of both bonded, they settled down.
“It appears you missed the memo,” Tobias snarled, “It’s Tobias Regulas Malfoy-Black and you are the very annoying Holie-shorts.”
“EEEE!” Tobias squealed happily, his mind now completely on Vince’s news. “What did you get her? It had better be match what she gave to you!”
She had woken an hour ago in the Infirmary under the watchful eyes of the transfiguration professor, the potions professor and the school’s healer. She had been asked multiply questions about what she could remember about what had happened and she had answered them to the best of her ability before hesitantly asking how the Zabini boy was. All three adults had thinned their lips. She had been informed that he had a broken wrist and a dislocated jaw, but he would be alright in time for breakfast. It had been then that they had informed her of the claiming mark that rested at the base of her skull.
“When,” Charlie stated. “The Romanian Ministry is willing to send aid if – or when - The Lord requires it.”
“Good!” she snapped, making him flinch slightly. “Maybe seeing a dog pile with you on the bottom will make Tobias smile.”
I don't know whether to be happy to be finished this story or to be depressed that it is over. This was the very first story that I posted and the first one that I planned. There have been times that I have wanted to sit in a corner and weep while writing this, just as there have been times that I have wanted to throw the computer and the books I've been writing in into the corner and forget about it, but I've persevered and now ... Now I am going to find myself a corner, curl up into a little ball and bawl my eyes out because it is the end of my very first chaptered story. *sniffles* My baby has grown up and is leaving home. :'(
To Ron’s horror, the bridge he was tied to started to crumble. Slowly at first then in larger quantities and in faster time as the verse was repeated another two more times. Soon, he was screaming as he fell into the ravine, hitting the jagged sides hard enough to bruise. He gulped deeply when the stranger’s strong tenor took over the song.
Severus sat in his chair, thinking. He was starting to worry about Draco. That day the boy had been quiet; silent during both breakfast and lunch. It was now time for their potions lesson and the boy was that quiet that he wasn’t even trying to sabotage potions on the Gryffindor side of the room. When he walked to the front to hand in his sample, Severus seized his chance.
Manuel smirked. “She has no say in it as when she signed the contract for our marriage, she agreed to her withdrawal from the Greengrass family, so she has to do as I tell her. One reason why they hid the clause of their tradition being kept. The problem with that,” he smirked, “was it was broken as soon as the Greengrass family disowned one of my children.”
“Oh stop moaning,” Padma said, putting her head on his shoulder to the amusement and shock of those around them. “All it took to get everything back to normal was a simple ‘finite’ and I very much doubt anyone who wants to break into your store will think of casting a cheering charm as soon as they walk in.”
“Yes and I’m sure if asked, Severus would be willing to submit the memory of his rescue of Tobias,” she answered.
“Welcome back to the Snake-pit. I hope you all had an enjoyable break. As you all know tomorrow is our first day of the new term. All I ask of you tonight is that you get a good night’s sleep. Try not to wake the young Lord and his husband; I doubt they’ve had much sleep this past week. If they do wake before you are all in bed, please tell them I wish to see them. Lights out is at 10. Now, enjoy your evening.”
Harry nodded his understanding, and then playing with the band on his left wrist he asked, “Why did they do it, Professor? I thought they were my friends, but they betrayed me by taking away my only weapon. I know I cannot use magic out of school, but just the threat that I could lose my temper and have it escape my control scared the muggles enough for them to leave me alone.”
The four adults watched the two until they fell asleep once more. Severus covered them with a blanket, a small smile on his face. When he turned to the others, his smile disappeared when he met the raised eyebrow and crossed arms of the Patil family patriarch.
When the girls joined the group, those in wolf form returned to human and the two larger males hugged the girls.
Severus sat at the head table with a sigh. Not only had he needed to deal with the school’s medi-witch, but also the fact that Tobias had run to throw up as soon as he’d smelt the nurse’s breakfast.
“What has he done now?” Remus asked, recovering before Lucius since he was used to Sirius Black and James Potter.
“My second is Skoteinos – Dark – and Drakontas’ second is Arketa – Pretty.” Both Neville and Pansy removed their cowls. “May I introduce you all to our scholar, Pontikos – Mouse.” Theodore removed his cowl and moved to his spot behind and between Tobias and Draco. “Our weapons expert, Arpakitiko – Predator,” Blaise removed his cowl and moved to stand behind Pansy. “Our espionage specialists, Ateria – Mischief, “ Fred stepped forward, “and Ateros – Mischievous,” George stepped forward and the two of them removed their cowls together, before moving to either side of Neville and Pansy.
As soon as Draco heard that Tobias was calling for him, he jumped up and ran from the room and into the form of the Dark Lord. Bowing and making an apology, Draco took off again to get to his intended’s side. The Dark Lord remained where he was on the floor, blinking in surprise after him.
Tobias nodded. “The glass room please Lykos. We will be there once we have finished this last assignment.”
Severus snorted in amusement as he pictured his blonde friend lying on the floor throwing a temper tantrum with yelling, screaming and kicking because he didn’t get his own way.
“Go get the contracts and bring them to me,” Draco half-ordered. “Sometimes there are specific wordings in the contract that can be twisted around to give an out.” He paused for a second and asked softly. “If we can’t break it, is it so bad that the girls join our Pack? The Patil family is a good one – not just in the fact they are purebloods either. They are powerful, neutral or grey, depending on how you see it, and they have a reputation of forming close bonds with their bonded so even if they do not find a love like ours, they will still be happy.”
“This coming from the man who came from family renowned for their large families in the past,” Cornelius chuckled.
“Good work, everyone. He is even still alive. Now, why did you throw this pretty toy at me, hmm?” The man glared at the youth, keeping his lips sealed shut. “Aw, come on. If you tell me under your own power it will be a lot less painful for you – but less enjoyable for me. If not, then I will get it out of you with this little guy.” Tobias pulled a grub from a box. “He doesn’t look like much, I know, but let me explain what he does. I place him on a sensitive part of your body – the inside of your ear or the head of your dick, depending on how much I want to hear you scream – and it will squeeze itself into any hole it finds. If it cannot find a hole – let us say that I make a plug for the hole that lets air into your brain – it will make itself a new one. It will then hollow out the area surrounding it, and you will feel every ... single ... bite. Doesn’t it sound delightful?”
Leaning in, they shared their second kiss of their relationship, and this one was no less sweet, no less tender than the one they had shared the night before. They also did not hear everyone leave, mumbling about cavities rather than stay and watch something that was obviously a private moment.
Hermione beamed. “Well, Ginny and I were arguing over something and bondage bracelets and bondage bands came up. Ginny said that they were vicious, harmful and extremely dark. I said that they were not and that they were necessary for everyone’s safety.”
She blinked a few times then smiled slightly. “That is fine with me, Mr Longbottom. Sorry for not answering straight away, I didn’t recognise you at first.”
Tobias nodded slowly, as if deep in thought. “I must say I find Crucio rather boring. In fact, Bella cured me of my Crucio phase while she was begging for forgiveness after her fourth day of punishment. Such a pity she had to be released, she begged so prettily.” Tobias grinned, eyes gleaming in the firelight and almost the colour of hail clouds.
Severus remained silent through his entire examination – something that unnerved the Healer working on him to a great degree. When she was finished, she handed the results to Amelia and just about ran out of the area set aside for the patient’s privacy.
Tom blinked at the letter, then re-read it just to make sure it said what he thought it said. Slowly a grin formed on his lips.
“He kicked,” Tobias stated, astonished. “He actually kicked.” He raised awed eyes to meet with his husband’s weary but hopeful ones.
“I believe milord will be interested in starting this meeting. I suggest that everyone should get to their places,” Lucius said calmly, not allowing his anger at the idiot in their midst show itself.
“Did you learn that while looking for a way to bribe them?” Ron sneered, not noticing the potions master leaning on the door frame, seemingly relaxed.
Blinking, Severus Snape lowered the letter.  Looking at it suspiciously, he pointed his wand at the parchment and muttered two spells. When both spells reacted positively, he walked back to his potions lab, collected the healer’s bag all Potions Masters carry on themselves for emergencies and, with a crack, disappeared from the building.
“It’s no use doing that Alby-Bus,” Tobias sang out, watching with relief as the stranger who had vanished re-appeared with Draco who, while a bit unsteady, was moving on his own. “Only males who use the potion get cut open to give birth. There is no wound for you to re-open and since you openly attacked ME after taking on the visage of MY bonded, harmed one of MY PACK and threatened MY DAUGHTER in front of all these witnesses, then THIS,” Tobias curled tighter around the leg that was holding him down and grabbed just under the old man’s knee, “is self-defence.”
Tobias flamed into the dungeons only moments before Severus opened the door to the potions lab. Draco saw the look on his face and hugged him lightly. When the door did open, Tobias pulled Severus to one side and thrust his memory of the event into his mind. The man paled further than the class thought possible and left the dungeons at a run.
“Or some ingredients he wants prepared later,” Neville said. “Tell me if that is the case and I’ll be down there tonight.”
Tobias’ laughter echoed around the room. He turned to look at Draco, his eyes widening slightly. “Drakontas! Dressing to impress, or dressed to kill?” Striding over to him, he clasped the other boy’s upper arm in a sign of friendship. Pulling him into a hug he whispered, “You look good, Drakontas.” Letting him go, he bowed deeply to his father.
Tobias and Draco exchanged looks as the rest of The Pack surrounded them and slowly started to walk towards the castle Absent-mindedly, the three in the centre started to walk with them.
“Only a few,” Luna hummed, swaying to a song only she could hear. “It needs to be dark enough to hide things of nightmares, but light enough to see more than movement and I need a little bit of height. You can decide on everything else.”
The Hall was completely silent as the inhabitants struggled to comprehend everything that had occurred in the past twenty-four hours. First the Headmaster had been denied access to areas where there were students. Next the school nurse had been transported to St Mungos in hysterics when her examination discovered several obliviates, a tampered vow and a suspicious cocktail of potions in her system. Third and fourth was the truth behind why there was no longer a Golden Trio and why the boy-who-lived turned his back on the Headmaster.
“Draco! I need you to get two stomach potions, four nutrient potions and all the muscle relaxant potions you can find,” Severus ordered, removing the top sheets off the bed. Removing the robe Harry was wearing, he added, “and the potion in the blue jar I tell you to never touch!”
Concentrating on the movement of his hands, Tobias didn’t notice as the magic in the room increased. After a few moments a delicate flame appeared along the seam of his joint hands. Releasing the flame, it split into three and one of the flame balls flew to each adult to surround them. When the flames disappeared so too did the built up magic. Draco gazed in amazement at his now perfectly presentable parents. When the adults glared at him, Tobias snorted in amusement.
“The potion, however, “Fred continued, moaning softly as he sank deeper into the seat, “was not destroyed in the slightest. It was simply passing from me to George and back again, so we had a constant amount of it in both of us. This leads us to believe that the person who doused s did it to say they gave it to us while still allowing us to be unaffected by it.”
Severus squeezed the bridge of his nose as he closed the door behind the trio. “What can I do to help you?” he asked after he checked on the still sleeping students.
The blond had managed to get the younger male to focus entirely on him while the vitriol fell from the female’s lips.
Tobias rolled his eyes. “Nonos,” he stated, “I’m still going to be doing what I need in Minerva’s office. Draco is going to be with me being my loyal and willing slave and everyone else has stuff to do in the library or in the dorm, so WHY would we slack off?”
“That is true,” Tobias mused as he too returned to his breakfast, easily pushing the disturbing vision out of his mind with practiced ease. “I have faith in them,” he added softly as he rubbed his growing bump, smiling softly as he felt a slightly stronger flutter than the previous day.
Severus stepped through the fireplace with a relieved sigh. He was not looking forward to taking to Lucius or his Lord. He found them sitting in the sitting room with tea, coffee and ham and cheese sandwiches.
His voice took on a malicious glee. “I wrecked his office.  Everything I could see, I destroyed. Not even Thanatos could calm me. Not that he really tried. He wanted to see how the old goat reacted. He waited until I calmed down and told me about the prophecy.” Harry snorted.
Narcissa laughed and summoned some books over to her. “Oh, yes, plenty of time. Now then, we are going to need catering, a cake, and a celebrant – Do you want to hold it here at the Manor or somewhere else? We need decorations ...”
“Not a problem,” Cornelius chuckled, “I remember when my wife was pregnant with our first. I couldn’t get enough of feeling her move.”
Growling menacingly, he snatched the letter that floated over to him when it reached his area of space. Reading it through, he grimaced. Tobias was not impressed with him going back on his word without contacting him first. His punishment was the harshest one that could ever pass Tobias’ lips. Draco growled again and stormed out of the room, his rage urging him to find that idiotic father of his and make him suffer just as much as he was suffering himself. He had just closed his door when he saw Lucius coming up the hallway towards him.
The oddly fitted couple had a very unique relationship and though it was difficult … and oft-times impossible … to see just which one of the two wore the pants, no-one could deny that the two loved each other and their two cubs dearly.
Severus caught Remus’ eye and smirked. The group looked around in wonder at the room, all feeling more comfortable here than anywhere else in the castle.
“Please give my compliments to your brother for the meal,” Tobias said when he had finished most of it, only having his drink and snacks left. “If all meals taste this good, then I understand now why Professor Flitwick can often be heard complaining about Hogwart’s food tasting bland.”
Hermione smiled softly at her head of house. “Not really, Professor. Ginny and I got into an argument about something, and I’m looking for evidence to show her I’m right about it.”
“Some believe that the behaviour that the bearer – or mother – exhibits reveals the nature of the child. I know that in Sal’s case this was true – but in many it wasn’t.”
Remus walked out of the room.  Harry started when his stomach protested its empty state. Startled, he looked down, and then slowly raised his eyes to meet those of Severus and Lucius.  He bowed deeply to each of them.
She looked at them, thin-lipped and nostrils flaring as she noticed the glares they were exchanging. “It looks as though there is only one way to stop you from fighting and as much as it pains me to do this; I will not be healing your injuries this time. You will need to stay here while they heal naturally and you will have no visitors for the full week!”
Booph lent forward and whispered something to Zog, who lowered his head and murmured an apology. Tobias nodded his acceptance and lay his head back on Draco’s lap.
Breathing deeply, Harry followed the chain with his fingers until his suspicions were proven to be correct – the chain was attached to something that filled his Pet’s anal passage. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Harry pushed Draco back up the pole so he could get a closer look at what was under the skirt. What he found almost made him cum without any external stimulation. The devise Draco was wearing was something of Harry’s own design and was only bought out when Draco was being punished or when Draco wanted to be completely dominated.
The sandwiches appeared before them and the two girls ate tiredly. When they were finished they sat for a while to allow their meal to settle.
“Zog, may I present our family and Pack – Tom Riddle, Narcissa Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Bill and Charlie Weasley, Theodore Nott, Millicent Bulstrode, Fred and George Weasley, Greg Goyle, Vince Crabbe, Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley.”
“Oh stop being such a baby about it, Drakontas,” Tobias laughed. “I happen to like paperwork. It’s the best thing to do when you want information. No one expects the Clerk or Secretary to know, see or understand anything that’s going on and they don’t expect for you to be able to listen and write at the same time.”
“Tonight we go to Malfoy Manor. Tonight we become a pack in more than name. From tonight you do not answer to anyone but me – unless I tell you otherwise. Draco is an extension of me. If he tells you to jump, you are to respond with ‘how high’. Do I make myself clear?”
Severus continued, not seeing the horrified expressions on everyone’s faces as he relived his memories for them.
“I know I didn’t need the wand anymore, Thanis.” Harry seemed to have forgotten the people around him. “That isn’t the point. The point is that the old goat snapped MY WAND in front of them. And the broomstick …” Harry stopped talking, but flames started burning in his hair. “He gave it to Dudley, Thanis.”
Tom, who had managed to not cry during the ceremony, stared at Lucius, who nodded with a small smile on his lips. The familiar sound of a body hitting the ground interrupted Tobias and Draco. Seeing Tom on the ground, Draco raised an eyebrow in his father’s direction. Lucius just smirked, causing Draco to shake his head and pull Tobias closer to him before turning around to sign the certificate.
As it was, the families of the boys in question could refuse the girls contracts on the bases of not knowing if their son was the girl’s first experience, not believing the child is their son’s or due to the girl’s lack of modesty, integrity and intellect. It all depended on what the boys said and how they reacted to the news.
Severus shook his head ruefully. “I told Minerva that I was keeping you here for the rest of today because you were feeling over whelmed due to not having a decent rest for a person of your condition. Poppy said – albeit reluctantly - that even if you are only in your first month then you should get a decent amount of rest so it makes the later months easier on the carrier as well as the child. I’m going to suggest you have a rest now and join Minerva and myself for a mid-morning snack and you can start again after half an hour.”
“It would be easier for us to remove any magical damage from first and second years, as well as safer for them, to go through them first. Less time for the magic to settle into their core,” Lady Greengrass stated softly. “Third and fourth years are too far behind young Mr Malfoy-Black to have been too heavily dosed, if at all, and as Amelia said, none of the students in seventh year has been noticed interacting with the victim of these attacks, so it stands to reason that they would not be overly interfered with.”
The owl bobbed its head and held out a talon. Ginny carefully removed the letter and read it while Luna absent-mindedly scratched the owl’s head.
She reached the nearest bathroom only just in time to empty her stomach of the food she had managed to stomach at both breakfast and lunch. She vaguely noticed that no one had followed her from the class to make sure she was fine and she dissolved into heart-broken sobs as she realised that if she had protested his treatment or had told someone what was happening, that Harry would have followed her just to make sure she was alright. She spent the next three hours sitting on the bathroom floor crying her eyes out and not one person came looking for her.
“I don’t know,” Tom replied softly, “But whatever it is has to be more than great. Severus deserves nothing less.”
Luna gave a small flirtatious grin and vanished through the door. Neville chuckled softly and followed, knowing exactly where the blonde girl was heading.
“Thank you,” Neville chirruped, making her laugh as he walked towards a rather large group standing by the doors to the Great hall.
Tobias nodded at Severus, who gave Neville what looked to be a black banana. “And this brings us to our next sweet. We call them ‘Gons’. These are the opposite of the ‘Chatters’ and are the only way to quickly warn up someone who has eaten one, but the reverse is also true. Unlike the skiving snack boxes, these two cannot be made into the same sweet, because they cannot touch. If put together they react ... violently - and cancel out the other’s effect.”
In some odd way, he half hoped that his daughters and the Weasley twins agreed to wed – or at least court in an attempt to see if they were compatible.
Tobias smiled tiredly at the diminutive creature. “If I had the energy I would be on my feet bowing. Please forgive my rudeness in not doing so.”
Severus placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder and then sat on the mattress next to him, noticing but ignoring the slightly hesitant way his touch and presence was received.
Tobias knew he had done the wrong thing once Draco bit him and so he wasn’t surprised when Draco left him alone on the dais. Whimpering at the loss of heat from Draco’s body, he slowly put his clasped hands above his head. Once his hands were back above his head, he felt something slide around his wrists and tighten.
“Firstly, both boys are perfectly fine heath wise. Mr Gryffindor was correct in saying it was just magical drainage.”
Luna rapped the under-side of the table with her fingers when Ron, Dean and Seamus entered the room. Neville smirked at her and turned the handle a bit slower than Theo had done. Almost instantly, Luna, Neville, Ginny, Greg, Vincent and Tobias started to softly sing along with it, slowly getting a little louder with each verse, ignoring the slowly spreading silence of the hall.
“Okay. We’ll wait here,” Luna said as she guided Ginny to the food table. “If we are meditating, just place your hand on our shoulders so you don’t startle us.”
“I should torture you,” Tom hissed, eyes flashing. “I really should, but I won’t.” He smirked, making himself look much more sinister to Severus’ eyes than ever before. “After all, having one godson angry at you and the other one terrified of being anywhere near you without another three or four people being there as well is punishment enough, I guess. I also wouldn’t wish to be in your shoes when Minerva finds out.” He grinned maliciously, “And she should be getting the letter I wrote to her telling her what you had done any time now …”
Severus chuckled just as softly. “Just be sure to be out here within 30 minutes. Tobias cannot afford to miss any meals – particularly since you do your exams today.”
Tobias sighed happily. It had been a long time since he’d eaten good fish, and this fish was cooked exactly the way he liked it – grilled with the smallest amount of lemon, thyme and chilli infused oil and a sprinkling of pepper. Everything that accompanied it suited it perfectly – A slice of fresh bread with flavoured oil and a sweet and slightly spicy salad. He might not like house-elves, but he had to admit that they could cook.
“You may not have touched me or mine, but you didn’t do anything to prevent something that would be classified as murder.” Everyone bar Ginny and her neighbour flew into the air upside down. Tobias looked at the other two. “If you don’t get moving, you’ll be late for class. I’ll walk with you. Don’t worry about them – I’ll send someone for them.” As they left, Tobias whispered. “Meeting tonight – Follow me three minutes after I leave the Great Hall.”
“Draco!” Tobias arched into the movement, trying to get the feeling back. “More! Oh Gods, please more!” he pleaded, whimpering.
Running through the Manor to find what was wrong, they stopped outside the rooms Tobias and Draco were sharing. Opening the door, Remus paled at what he found. Yelling out to Severus to find The Pack and Draco, he hurried to do what he could for his godson, the Dark Lord on his heels.
Draco sighed, and then decided against restraining the two girls. How he had managed to stand and leave the Snake Pit with no one the wiser, he had no idea – but he was thankful for small miracles.
He sighed, serious again. “It took me, Luc and every potion I had six hours to remove all of the bands. I have never seen Draco run from a room so many times – nor seen him that shade of green either.” He looked up, just now remembering where he was and with whom. “I can put all my memories into a pensive if you wish.”
With another flashed smile, Luna turned to the darkest area between two large trees. “You know what to do Algranol,” she said. “Enjoy yourself!”
Neville mentally rubbed his hands together gleefully. “If someone was willing to swap rooms with either young lady, would it be possible?” he asked softly after a moment of thought.
“Bi, calm down. Draco loves you more than anything. He doesn’t need to say anything, because you can see it in his eyes and how he treats you. I don’t doubt that you will have problems. All couples do – but you will get through them together. Nothing you will do could drive him away from you. And Bi? It doesn’t matter what anyone else things, because to Draco, you – are – perfect. Always remember that you are welcome here at any time. You are still going to be my son no matter what.”
“Thank you for being honest with us Minerva,” Amelia said, wincing as she finished the last of her Scotch. “I’m afraid we have a lot of work to do before we get to retire for the night.”
The Death Eaters watched and listened in shock as the youngsters reported to the Dark Lord as if they had rehearsed it in advance. No one could miss the pride that shone in the eyes of the adults surrounding the Dark Lord. Some of the people in the black mass watched in shame as a group of school children gave their reports with more finesse and professionalism then they themselves had shown. A small group of followers watched their Lord’s son in jealousy as he sat down in the most coveted position – the throne-like seat that was placed to their Lord’s left. The majority of the crowd, however, listened to the words coming from their Lord’s heir in shock.
“I know, Sev. But by mild, I meant mild. The next step in nightmares is him killing everyone he cares about while under something like the Imperious Curse. The next one is watching as one of his family kill the rest of the family. After that is having me in Dumbledore’s pay and me only being with him because I was ordered to, followed closely by me leaving him for either Granger or Weasley. The worst on, however is where he remembers everything he went through at the muggles’ house, but it is me who is doing it to him and saying whatever that bastard said to him. Those dreams break my heart because he yells out that he loves me in his sleep, but then I say something that makes him cry. I asked him once what it was that I say and I’ve regretted it ever since.”
Everyone in the Hall watched horrified as Tobias leapt at the newly released girl, transforming into his wolf form before colliding with her. The younger years suddenly found themselves unable to see or hear anything other than the same woman who had threated Granger humming a gentle song that slowly put them to sleep.
One of the house-elves saw an opportunity and took it. Grabbing the fork, it thrust a pile of potato into Harry’s open mouth. As soon as the food touched his tongue, Harry turned an alarming shade of green and struggle to remove himself from the group of over-enthusiastic house-elves.  He didn’t make it.
Twenty minutes later, Poppy was marching purposefully back to the room she had left the boys in. She had just completed informing their heads of house where they were when the alarm for a patient out of bed sounded. She was about to storm into the room when a snarl stopped her.
Before him were three stacks of paper. One sat in a cedar box marked ‘reports’. A second sat in an oak box marked ‘Important Documents’. The third and centre pile, was the only one not in a box. On a sheet of parchment was a small note in his son’s narrow handwriting.
Luna watched the sun sink below the horizon with a satisfied smirk. It was almost time for her to get to work. Before vanishing into the castle, she looked up at the full moon. “It’s almost our time, Mother. I hope you are proud of whom I have become.” She turned and walked back into the castle without a single glance backwards.
“Merry Christmas, Love. Arketa went to Riddle Manor and collected all the presents she found from both you and Lord Tom and bought them here. I hope you enjoy your Christmas celebration.” Draco whispered, pleased that his plan had gone off without a hitch … well, that is if you don’t count the whole nearly blowing the wards through sexual activity a hitch.
“Tomorrow I am going to be starting to clean a new location for myself. I am going to be safer – and more at home – in the Chamber than I am here. When I have made myself at home, I will collect my pack and bind them to the Chamber’s magic so they can use Hogwarts to get to me. The rest of you will be getting two passwords. I will explain them to you when the time comes for you to get them. One more thing before you all head off to bed.” He waited for the shuffling to settle down.
“My advice, should you wish it, is to allow yourself this time to sort everything out. Listen to your body. If you need sleep, then sleep. If you need to scream, scream. If you need to make Lucius look like a prude, then jump Draco at dinner time.”
“Now why would I want to do that?” she asked with a giggle as she teasingly traced Vincent’s Adams apple with the sharp tip of the knife she held. “He looks so delightful like this.”
“Who is this ‘Randal’ you are talking about?” Lady Ariandra asked. “I do not believe that I have heard of him before.”
“Then how do you explain that my former lion is carrying your grandchild?” Minerva asked in a slightly teasing voice.
To Draco’s annoyance, the person who aided him the most in understanding what was happening was not Algernon, like he had thought, but Godric Gryffindor. Looking back, he should have realised that the best person to go to for advice and answers would be someone who had lived through what he was going through now. He sighed and shook his head with a disbelieving chuckle.
When Blaise, Vince, Greg and Theodore went to bed to be ready for the next morning and the first day of lessons, they all smiled inwardly at the sight that met them. Draco had climbed onto Tobias’ bed and had curled into him, his head on the dark-haired youth’s chest. He had a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. As quietly and gently as they could, Theodore and Blaise covered Draco with one of the blankets off his own bed before getting ready for bed themselves.
Tom watched as Remus paced, deep in thought. Since they had discovered the bond between Tobias and the two Daemons, Remus had spent every spare moment in the Riddle Manor Library researching all he could about the different Daemon and their cultures, as well as everything he could find on the gods they served. He had found little on the Daemon and even less of the Mother and her consort.
Chuckling softly, Neville gestured for Luna to precede him up the stairs on the far right. When they reached the correct door, Neville opened it and pointed Luna to the correct bunk. He watched as the blonde female softly blew a dull brown powder into the red-heads face.
“If that was happening to ‘The-Boy-Who-Lived,” Tobias said as sarcastically as he could, “then why would anyone care about what happened to one small, rather odd girl who accepted what fate had to throw at her as punishment for not dying with her mother?” Tobias looked at his watch and sighed tiredly. “I’ll leave the four of you to discuss action plans. I have a meeting with Madam Bones and Lord Patil. When you decide what to do, either come find me or put it into the important document pile on my desk and I will sort it out when I wake in the morning.”
“I got this for you,” Draco murmured so not to interrupt the bumbling idiot before them. In his hand was a glass of the drink the centaurs had introduced him to.
“You need to be aware, Mr Snape, that Daemon children are rare things. As such, we view all children as miracles – and this child wasn’t just any child. He had the Mother’s interest, so we sort of gave him our protection.”
“Mr Malfoy. Mr Black. It is an honour to be here. I am Ruen and this is my son, R’thir. We are in charge of your food and drink tonight. Mr Snape bids me to give you this.” He pulled Tobias’ potion from a woven bag.
“Before you open this book, Miss Granger, I want your word that you will do several things for me.” Hermione nodded eyes slightly wide at the sterner than normal look her teacher was giving her. “First, you must make an unbreakable vow, do you accept?”
Nods and groans of relief were his answers. Packing away the books they were using, the group hissed as stiffened muscles were worked.
“Mmm,” Tobias purred, opening his eyes. “Now that the talking is over,” he started, “can we have a bath?” he turned huge eyes towards his husband.
Tobias stretched and grinned, thankful for the break. “It is going well, Lykos. We are all just about finished over last assignment. Would you like to join us for tea? My Pack’s parents may also join if they wish.”
“Tobias normally naps mid-morning and mid-afternoon,” Minerva stated softly. “I think today is the first time in a while that he didn’t and it’s caught up with him.”
Something hit him on the back of the head and he turned around angrily only to shrink back at the sight of a viciously glaring youngster of around twelve.
Draco jumped when he felt a different type of wet heat on his now-not-so-flaccid dick. He looked down and groaned lustily as his eyes met those of his husband just as teeth gently scrapped up is now solid erection, he whimpered softly when a tentative tongue lapped at his dark pink head. He collapsed in pleasured pain as lips wrapped themselves lovingly around his shaft, teeth gently gripping the shaft directly beneath the mushroom-head on top of it and suction so hard it made Tobias’ cheeks cave in to caress the velvety skin on top.
Draco stood. “The information I am about to reveal is going to test everyone in this room whether they are a member of The Pack or not. The next time that Tobias is seen, he must have no fewer than three others with him until the time comes for us to leave. He is NOT to be left alone, is that clear?”
Everyone was silent as the two bounced words off the other as they walked up the centre of the tables.
Tobias sat in the middle of the sitting room, looking around in awe at what his pack had organised for him. They had all eaten breakfast in the decorated room, followed closely by large stockings filled with small wrapped presents and small packets of international wizarding sweets.
The three men jumped when a house-elf popped in. “Master told Binky to get him when young Master is finished in his work room.”
The start of the investigation and The Pack discovers that it is not a good idea to allow Luna to choose colours
To everyone bar Randal’s surprise, Lord Patil nodded and gave a shallow bow. “I will do so.” Just before the man left the room, Tobias called out to him thoughtfully.
hello once again! Wonderful evening isn't it? Hope you enjoy this chapter :) Remember, any mistakes, let me know any questions will be considered and answered if they won't give anything away, they will be answered after the review they were asked in, not in the story itself. Also, and I'm not saying that this is anyone here, but I would like to make it known that yes, the Harry/Tobias in this story is fascinated by the Greek language and therefore uses it to name those important to him and, on some occasions in the future, to insult people in a way they will not understand. People all over the world are learning more languages then just English and even we pure English speakers know some words that are not based in English, so please don't tell me that him knowing another language is illogical and impossible like one flamer said on another site.
Draco positioned himself between his husband’s legs and slowly re-entered him. “It’s not over yet, Love,” he whispered, summoning a jar of cream. “Mother gave me this for you. She said that she used this stuff religiously when she was pregnant with me. It’s to keep your skin healthy and soft.”
“Why do you automatically believe I was the one responsible?” the blonde man groused, going red with embarrassment.
“So they called in the only registered Transfiguration Master in the UK to help,” Severus finished for her with a nod of understanding. “I get the same treatment when the problem they can’t solve is potions related. My suggestion is to notify her classes that she is unavailable and give them an assignment to complete on the topic she was teaching.”
“I think you are right,” Tobias said with a soft chuckle so as to not disturb the younger students who were working on their worksheets. “Do you mind me sleeping here?”
“Grained toast with strawberry jam, banana, a really runny egg and sardines in tomato sauce,” he said after he swallowed his mouthful. “But it is missing something ,” he pouted. Man of the males around him pushed their plates away, struggling to keep whatever they had managed to eat in their stomachs. “It tastes bland. It needs something ...”
Tobias bowed to the room in general, shot his father a dark look until he left for his bed chamber and left, all of his pack following him out.
Fred and George exchanged grins that would have sent a goblin scurrying for cover if they had been on the receiving end of it. “We can’t wait!” they almost crowed.
Severus sobbed into an exasperated Remus’ shoulder as everyone else in the room glared at him. He had just finished telling the four of them what had occurred and none of them – least of all Tom – was happy with him.
While they waited, several of their school peers saw them and came over to congratulate the couple and see the small bundle for themselves. Draco acted the part of proud parent and bragged about the past two weeks with obvious joy and love.
“We know it was you who tried to terminate Tobias’ pregnancy – and we know that it was the old coot that ordered you to do it – He will get his, just as you will get yours. But until then, you are mine,” she whispered, a near malicious look in her baby blue eyes. “Let me introduce myself. My name is Luna Lovegood; otherwise known as Kyria of the Death Wolf Pack. I’m the Torture Expert, and you will be my first human specimen.” She smirked. “I’ve been told I have a very rare talent for my art.”
“You should sleep Tobias,” she said softly as she sat beside him, “Even if it is only for twenty minutes.”
The screams froze in everyone’s throats as the bodily remains of the former brains of Gryffindor became surrounded in pure white flame as the red-stained wolf slowly shed its fur and returned to human form. “I announce the fulfilment of the blood oath to magic against one Hermione Jan Granger. May the Mother continue her punishment in my stead. So Mote it be.”
He blinked at Draco in confusion as he noticed the tears rolling down his face. “Draco?” he asked plaintively, forgetting his anger at the sight of Draco’s tears. “What’s wrong? Did I do something bad?”
Tobias stopped as well and looked back at his husband. “Yes. Unless …” he felt his bottom lip wobble slightly and his eyes begin to fill with tears. “Unless you only want one child,” he whispered.
Draco slowly shook his head, moving his husband so he was held tightly against his body. “I don’t think so sweetie.”
“Thanks Kitten. Give me a bell when Gin is alone – and preferably fully clothed – and I’ll see her then. Keep an eye on the old goat, but don’t sabotage any of the plans. I’d like to see Sev when he has a spare moment, as well.”
Harry nodded and pulled the hood over his head until it covered all his features but his lower jaw. “I am ready.”
“As I was saying, the last sweet is the smallest and was named by Sev, who was unfortunately – for him – the unlucky man to discover its effect. The name is actually what he said when it happened. Neville? Are you ready?”
Tobias snorted. “No, reborn of eternal flame.” With that, he disappeared in a flare of sapphire and onyx flames.
Tobias nuzzled into the flesh behind Draco’s ear, making him giggle slightly. “Let’s go down for breakfast, Dragon.”
“Now that I have your attention once more,” Cornelius stated dryly, causing most of the hall to flush in embarrassment, “You will receive a folder from the man you go to that will hold your results, the areas you are best in, the areas you are worst in and tips on what you should focus on in reviewing.”
“Firstly, do you, Hermione Granger, promise to tell no one who gave you this book – nor the information you gain from it?”
As THE SONG CAME TO A CLOSE, Harry watched in astonishment as Draco grabbed the poles on either side of him and jumped, lifting his legs until they wrapped around the outer edge of his arms, spreading his arse cheeks so far that a small trickle of lime-scented water escaped from behind the butt plug. Before the last notes of the song had escaped into the room, Harry was between his Pet’s legs, slowly licking the sweet liquid from the pale lower back
Tobias grinned. “Just go to the front of the class and act like everything is normal. I’ll take care of everything else.” Raising his voice so everyone in the class could hear him, he said. “So using magical vegetable matter grown in a muggle environment rather than a magical one affects the outcome of the potion it is used it?”
Remus had been watching his mate ever since the dark haired man had walked into the Hall. He’d been flabbergasted when Ginny, Neville and Luna had walked in and bowed their heads minutely in Severus’ direction. He had been shocked into silence when Severus had returned the gesture.
Ron smiled groggily at the two kids and softly hummed along when the verse was sung once again. He felt himself turning to face the opposite direction from the two mist kids. He didn’t struggle and happily looked up … than froze. He let out a moaned gasp and his eyes bugged out to massive proportions as he came to understand what was happening.
“Tart?” Sally-Anne grinned while pulling an un-opened jar of pickled cabbage and one of pickled onions from her bag. “Serina sent you these for you when I told her your cravings had started. I swear on my magic that as soon as I got them I ensured they were untempered with and that no one else has touched them. I will not, however, be insulted should you wish to get a Professor to test them.”
Draco moaned as his master pulled his head back as far as it could go, using his hair as leverage. He was in for one Hell of a week.
“Yes Alpha.” Greg released his grip and moved back to his position – behind and slightly to the left of Draco. Tobias’ eyes went AK green. Remus whined and Severus and Lucius gulped.
When they had settled, she covered them with a soft, warm blanket and left, pausing at the door to look at the rivals-turned-lovers. She would keep this new development to herself, but when the boys decided to drop their act, she would support them fully – even if it meant dealing with the Devil himself.
“But what about that time when I was eight and chained up in the backyard?” Tobias asked in confusion. Everyone’s eyes turned ice cold.
Tobias giggled. “No, I just told him that I’m going to be a Mama. I’m pregnant!” Once more, he mentally counted to three and watched as the second daemon fainted. He started to laugh without stopping. Draco, after hearing the commotion appeared two minutes later with his wand drawn. After being told what had happened, he also stated laughing uncontrollably. It was the funniest thing he had ever heard.
Ron screamed louder still as the metal bridge stared to bend and warp into odd shapes. He choked on his own breathe when the bending metal started to wrap itself cage-like around him. With a loud snap, the last piece of un-warped metal snapped, sending the ensnared boy tumbling into the web and spider infested depths.
Harry stood and bowed slightly. “Yes Sir. I am going to need to borrow all the things to make it from you, as I don’t even have my wand. Thank you for this chance, Sir.” He walked out of the door.
“See you in the morning Nonos,” Tobias smiled at the thankful look Severus sent him and the nervous gulps of the two Aurors. He watched them leave with a serious look on his face.
Severus pondered this. He had experienced this child’s challenging and changing palette first hand. It wasn’t that his tastes were getting more expensive – just more … limited in what it could handle.
Enjoy peeps :3 And I was told in one review to warn of needing tissues ... I don't know why ... but there it is :)
Noticing that everyone was finished, Severus cleared his throat. “I hear that you can’t sleep at night Tobias. Is there any reason why?”
Harry smirked and gripped Draco’s dick firmly before lowering his head and softly tonguing the now extremely tight star.
Draco nodded grimly. “I’m not regretting him getting pregnant,” he said softly, “but I am regretting that it happened when it did. Even six months later and his bones would have been strong enough for him to stand by himself. This morning I swear I saw his lower legs bend under the extra weight.”
Feeling the desperation in his partner, Draco gently licked Tobias’ lips, asking for entry. True to his submissive nature, Tobias opened his mouth and let Draco plunder his mouth. Tobias mewled softly, calming down quickly. He shifted until he was curled up in Draco’s lap, oblivious to the gob-smacked expressions on everyone’s faces.
Everyone waiting outside the room winced when yet another scream tore through the air. It had been nearly two hours since they had received word of their Alpha’s labour and not one of them had moved from the area outside the infirmary room where Tobias was being kept. It surprised no-one when, an hour in, Draco had been forced from the room.
He turned to face Tobias, who had his head on Draco’s lap and his feet on Neville’s. Both Daemons’ eyes softened slightly at the look of contentment on the Raven-haired boy’s face as the pale, elegant fingers gently carded through his hair. Neither of them was surprised at the soft – almost silent – purr coming from the lad.
“There isn’t any alcohol. There is a lovely drink the centaurs sent when they heard you were with child. It is lovely. It’s water with crushed mint and some other herbs that they say will help strengthen the little one. Do you feel up to starting?”
Tobias was listening, taking Draco’s words to heart. “Is … is that why I’m angry about the fact I was forced into it, but not scared to let another touch me in that way, like muggles are?”
"It was five months, three days, twenty hours and fifteen seconds after I was initiated that the Dark Lord’s attitude changed. It was instantaneous – no warning what so ever. It was terrifying to see the change in him. Where we could once call him by name and be teased about non-existent eye-batting men and women after our bodies, we would be hit with the cruciatus cures and had to prostate ourselves before him as though we weren’t fit to lick the dragon manure off the bottom of his shoes.”
“I propose that if I, Harry James Potter, can convince at least three of the Weasleys to join the ranks of the Dark Lord voluntarily, you, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, will dye your hair Gryffindor colours for the first two weeks of the school year. If I fail at this task, I will be your servant for the same said two weeks, as long as it doesn’t interfere with my own schoolwork. So mote it be.”
Lucius chuckled softly. He’d seen the light in Tobias’ eye when he’d seen the pile of paper in Sev’s hand. When the youngster had left, he turned to Tom. “Do you know what his going to do once he leaves Hogwarts? I have the feeling that everyone in The Pack – Including Miss Weasley and Miss Lovegood – could sit for their NEWTS at the end of this year and pass them with good marks.”
Grapplefang straightened in his chair and his gaze intensified as he looked at the young man who took another few sips from his mug and nibbled on a few of the savoury snacks before him.
This was followed by the sound of leather hitting flesh and a muffled curse, like someone talking through clenched teeth.
Two hours later, Vince and Greg escorted Draco to the lake. Draco wasn’t sure if he could believe it. Neither boy had left him at any time during the two hours, except to allow him time to shower and dress. They hadn’t even left to have their own food.
Needless to say, there was no bath for two; no foot rub and more than on pot of baby tea as the younger members of The Pack celebrated a new milestone in the development of their soon-to-be Pack member.
“I do My Lord,” Lucius growled, frustrated with everything. “The Head Auror … Scrimager I think his name is … decided to use Aurors who were a part of the old man’s Order believing that they would be loyal to the Ministry first, even after it was bought to his attention that they were exceedingly close to the insufferable old man.”
“I remember when Susan’s mother was pregnant with her. Most of the family had to look away in disgust when her cravings hit. I didn’t think they were too bad if I’m honest. The worst it got was blood ice-cream with cockroach clusters mixed in.”
Pansy grinned as she and the rest of the Pack were transferred back to Hogwarts via Phoenix. Neville chuckled and shook his head in amusement as he slowly made his way to his room in the Manor.
Tobias sneered at the ridiculous creature. “You are a magical creature and can travel to other areas with the same amount of effort as one would roll out of bed in the morning. Did it not occur to you to go to another country ... Fuck this, DOBBY!”
Tom nodded in resinated thanks. He wasn’t afraid to admit that he needed help with his son. He had to admit that this was something that he was unprepared for.
Tobias was in sensory overload. He had no sight, no memory and all he could bring himself to do was whimper needily and twitch spasmodically when Draco’s wicked mouth latched onto a sensitive section of his body. When Draco reached his navel and dipped his tongue into it, Tobias cried out and arched his back.
“We thought you knew,” Neville replied from his seat on the ground where a plant had entangled him in its stems. “We got a message via Thanatos and came straight here. Draco got flamed here before we found out.”
“Once you receive your folder,” Klause cut in sternly, “You will come to me. I have a list of your names, what job you want and what jobs you are qualified for with the results you obtained.”
“Charlie is a good bloke to talk to about animals. He’s almost a walking encyclopaedia on Dragons and Romania. I’m not talking about the things you can get from a book either, Hermione. I’m talking about the experience you get only by talking to someone who is passionate about that topic and can make shovelling Dragon shit for sixteen hours a day sound like heaven. Someone who is so enamoured that they can talk for days on end about the subject.”
Tom sneered at the Aurors in disgust from behind Lucius, where he was reading the papers over the blonde’s shoulder. “This load of crap isn’t even enough for him to get a hearing before the Wizengamet, let alone a one way trip to Azkaban.”
The other Auror pulled a scroll from a pocket on the inside of his robe and handed it to the young blond. Draco read it slowly and just as he finished the doors to the Hall opened once again. He looked up to see his father, father-in-law, Remus and Cornelius Fudge. Silently he handed the scroll to his father, who read it through as thoroughly as his son had done.
The woman smiled softly. “We shall not be long,” she said as she and the three males with her vanished into the room behind Narcissa.
“This is Discord. When we return to Hogwarts, she will be protection against physical attacks. Her nest mate, Chaos, will stay with me.” As he spoke, a black and yellow serpent’s tail waved from Tobias’ sleave.
“After we leave here, we will go to the rooms you will be staying in until your schooling starts again. We will be transporting you to the train, so you have nothing to worry about, so if someone will take their things, that will be appreciated. You will have time to organise the rooms to your liking before you are taken to the Garden. There you will speak to The Mother and Father. Once that is complete, you will be led to the Sacred Lake where you will bath. Then you are given a light meal of the Mother’s choosing. Then meditation time, then it will be time for you to consummate your relationship.”
Severus watched in shocked surprise as tears sprang to Draco’s eyes as he read the invitation. Reading it over his shoulder, his jaw dropped. When Tobias started something, he made sure it was completed – and completed properly!
As Severus turned to leave, the room was filled with quiet mutterings of silencing spells as people organised chess tournaments, hob stones and exploding snap games, or else pulled out quill, parchment and books to complete or check their holiday homework. The Pack stayed seated around their Alpha and Beta as they waited for the rest of their number to appear from their dorms. No one was surprised when the three of them arrived at the same time.
Stepping inside, he allowed the branches to close behind him. Looking around, he eyes fell on his husband and he fought to breath. He walked, mesmerized, as the Adonis before him opened his eyes and his lips parted slightly.
Draco sighed. He knew that it was unfair to his husband for this to happen and even though he wanted Tobias to be kept safe more than anything else, he thought this was going way too far. “I’ll talk to Sev okay? If all else fails, I’ll send for Algie and allow him to go all Healer on Sev’s arse, then set Remus and Tom onto him.”
Twenty-five minutes later, the two of them walked into the Dining room only to find five shell-shocked adults. Both boys stopped.
“Then let’s get started on writing all this down for Tobias to put into his report for The Lord. At least someone will have good news to report at this coming meeting. I just wish it was me,” Bill chuckled.
“We of the Goblin Nation would be honoured to act as witness for the reformation of the contract between Mister Weasley and the Patil family.”
Tobias opened his eyes and pinched the candles on his alter out. “What have you got there, dikos mou Drakontas?” He stood and stretched, the tendons and ligaments in his arms and legs snapping. Moving to sit on the bed beside Draco, he smirked at the photo. “Aw, isn’t that just adorable.” He smiled at the real Draco as photo Draco snuggled deeper into the pillow he had wrapped his entire body around.
Ginny and Luna looked around the Great Hall nervously. That morning had come with the announcement that only the fifth and sixth year students hadn’t been seen by the Healers and now the two girls were, once again, separated from the rest of their Pack. Unconsciously, they reached out to each other and held the other’s hand tightly.
Tobias chuckled, not in the least bit intimidated by the fierce woman. He made his way to the entrance. “I do believe you came to see the Chamber and the basilisk skeleton just waiting for harvesting?” The three adults looked at him, surprised to hear his amusement. “And don’t worry, Nona. I would only use his weaknesses against him in the bedroom to get him well and truly riled up.” He grinned sardonically. “I so love a dominant top.” Winking at the shell-shocked adults, he left the Snake Pit. The three adults looked at each other, silenced efficiently.
Everyone in the Hall stared in shock at the prone form of Luna Lovegood as invisible knives sliced into every bit of skin they could see and a large pool of blood quickly formed around her.
The Minister looked at Neville thoughtfully. “Yes, I believe that will work …” he was interrupted by two squeals of delight.
While they had been there, they had spoken about anything and everything. Tom had admitted to no longer knowing what he wanted for the wizarding world, while Tobias had discussed his plans for after the bonding. Tom had been ecstatic when he discovered that Tobias was going to hyphenate his name so he could keep the Riddle name. He and Draco had discussed it and Draco was fine with it – going as far as to suggest that he also hyphenate his name. Neither Tom not Tobias knew that Draco had spoken about it with his parents and that Lucius had given his blessing.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “We will do so Sir,” he said, smiling indulgently as Tobias piled a large spoonful of both jars onto his sandwich before biting into it and moaning in pleasure at the taste. “We have to write to thank her for the gifts anyway. Maybe she will be able to get us more of them – I will give her the money for it.” He turned to the Ravenclaw still before them. “Thank you. You didn’t need to do any of this.”
Draco nodded his understanding, even though he felt like he was dying inside. Tobias smiled at him and walked to the door before looking back at him.
The Hall went silent with the exception of the soft whispering that was coming from Draco as he attempted to sooth his temperamental husband.
He stood tall and bowed deeply to Tobias. “May I request the presence of George Fabian Weasley for a trip to the homeland of my family at the end of Padma’s seventh year? And may I request that Padma remain with you and your Pack this summer?”
“I’m sorry I asked,” Lucius moaned as he sank into his seat and placed his head between his knees. Tom, Severus and Narcissa laughed.
Draco smiled. “For listening to me last night and for trusting me enough to fall asleep on me. I really enjoyed last night, Bi. Thank you.”
Tobias laughed, “No I don’t think you are fluent in that yet. What I meant was ‘it makes me happy when I see my family in relationships that make them as happy as I am with Draco.”
Draco smiled and nodded. “Well, half the reason. You’ll get the rest of it later. I contacted the Malfoy house-elves and ordered a special celebratory dinner for the two of us.” He smiled charmingly. “We haven’t yet celebrated your pregnancy and I thought that we should do so tonight.”
A/N read if you wish, but if you can’t be bothered, then don’t complain : - I know that there are many things that are not possible in rl in this fic, but that’s what this is – a work of fiction in which magic is the norm rather than the exception. I’m sure that if there is a potion that can regrow bones and one that can turn you into another person, then there are potions for all types of things – including bedroom games.
Severus looked at Harry shrewdly for a moment. “Alright, Mr Potter. I expect you to be in my lab in thirty minutes. You will have your practical this morning and your theory test after your meeting with our Lord. The practical will consist of a potion you will not be familiar with, so I shall allow you to use the book it is in, and give you a half hour to read what you can of the potion and its usage.”
His gaze wandered to The Pack to find them all on their knees, bowing to the magnificent pale-skinned, black haired woman that was holding back the enraged form of one Tobias Regulas Riddle.
“I find myself asking why you are fighting so hard. It couldn’t be for devotion to my Alpha – if it was then you wouldn’t have done what it was you did to him. It could have been pride, but I ruled that out since you have never taken pride in anything but your schoolwork before, and thank Merlin for that or we would have had someone worse than Brown in the school. It also couldn’t have anything to do with the Weasel since he has been spending all of his time trying to seduce younger female students into his bed. So that leaves only one option. You are doing it for the Estimable Headmaster.”
“We can do that,” Pansy said, determination evident in the set of her mouth and deep in her eyes. “How long do we have to do this? And do you want the hallways done as well?”
Before she could get two deeply into her thoughts, she was guided – read ‘man-handled’ – into a chair. She pouted as every one of her ideas was shot down. Seems they didn’t see the beauty of deep red blood glistening in the moonlight. Pity … it was such a wondrous sight.
Minerva sighed. “Right: everyone back to bed. I’ll sort this out. No use for all of us to be tired later on in the day.” She turned to the girl and put a hand on her shoulder to gain her attention. “What Happened, Miss Granger?”
“You will stay here until this is resolved,” Madam Greengrass snapped at the pouting teen. “What anyone saw in you is beyond me. You are nothing but a spoilt little snot-nosed bra …”
Half an hour later, Poppy walked quietly into the room to find both boys on one narrow bed in what had to be the most uncomfortable position. Silently, she scanned both boys and healed the injuries that remained before enlarging the bed to accommodate them both. She watched as Harry moved to the centre of the bed, pulling Draco with him. She smiled as Harry curled around Draco, who had his face nestled into the centre of Harry’s chest and his legs tangled with the sheets and with Harry’s legs.
Draco was in heaven. His husband was pinned under him in the throes of passion, and his hair was being tugged on spasmodically every time the god beneath him begged for more. He had sped up til he was pounding into the depths of his husband’s body and he could feel the tell-tale signs that indicated his climax was building. The continual chant of “Yes! Oh Gods yes!” from beneath him, revealed that Tobias’ was building as well. Continuing with his thrusting, he moved the legs that were around his waist back to his shoulders and thrust harder.
“If you do not like our rules, feel free to write to Minister Fudge: he needs more useless parchment to use as a fire-starter in his office fireplace. Now MOVE!” She watched as everyone moved to do as she had ordered except for her niece, her niece’s friends and The Pack – who had already done as she had ordered.
Narcissa watched the scene on the bed with soft eyes as Algernon cast spell after spell at her exhausted son-in-law to clean him up. Draco had seated himself behind Tobias and was holding the younger male close to him while gazing down at the small being that was greedily guzzling the formula that had been quickly thrown together once the baby had been cleaned.
Draco growled softly in agreement. He wanted to taste his husband again, and this was the perfect excuse to. Tobias shivered in agreement as Draco pulled him onto his lap. No one in the room missed the flame of magic burning in both of their eyes.
“I didn’t believe my Grandson when he said our client could charm one of our warrior’s if he so wished,” the goblin cackled, “but I see now he was being truthful. I am Grapplehank. Welcome to my domain.”
Lucius, Severus, Draco and Voldemort blinked in surprise.  How could the boy be so calm and in control, even though he was wearing not one stitch of clothing? Remus chuckled softly.
Lucius and Severus were seated in Lucius’ study nursing a glass of scotch each, both deep in thought.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Amelia began, “What are the consequences of one party breaking the contract?”
Tobias paled drastically and slumped to the ground, hands on his stomach, eyes wide. It was only the fast thinking of George – who had tossed a ball of twine at the swooning figure before he fell and transfigured it into a large cushion.
Blaise nodded with a small smile on his face. “Thank you Alpha. I do know that, but I still stand by my decision. If I should be disowned, I will be bonded to The Pack.” He looked up at the castle now looming about them. “I spent the majority of my life being terrified of being disowned. Now, however,” he shrugged, “Something in me wants them to disown me. In fact, I hope they do – this is my family right here. I don’t need anything else.”
Albus sighed again, this time with regret. He could not drain the child just yet, he had to wait for him to defeat Voldemort – he only hoped that he could withstand the temptation having the boy in the school.
Cornelius Fudge checked his watch once more. It was almost five minutes past nine and not all of the students were ready. The Slytherins hadn’t even turned up!
Rising, Neville shook his head in disgust at the rest of the school. Did they honestly believe that a Ravenclaw would need tutoring?  If anyone question it they had an answer for them, but just the thought of a Ravenclaw needing help with their studies was preposterous!
Professor Jugdley – the DADA professor for that year – frowned at her sixth year N.E.W.T. class. She had a problem and she didn’t know how to solve it. She sighed. “Today we are going to learn how to block the cutting curse. The first half of the lesson will be theory, then the second will be practical. Mr Pot ... Mr Malfoy-Black. You will be sitting behind my desk for the second half of the lesson so no accidents occur.”
“What about tying their partner to the bed with school scarves, tasting – or should that be teasing – their way down their partner’s chest while they are still asleep before torturing them for two hours before the ties loosen enough for their partner to take charge?”
He pulled a packet out of his pocket and was about to light them when Tobias caught the scent of them and panicked.
Everyone had eaten at supper while they watched Harry slowly eat a small bowl of noodles in broth, then a small piece of grilled fish with a small side salad.  He had refused all liquid bar water and pumpkin juice, much to the amusement of all around him.  Moving to the sitting room, Severus once more offered him a glass of alcohol – a good scotch this time, and once more he refused.
Standing on either side of the now very pale Gryffindor were two very familiar and very angry daemons. Prowling around her feet was a shimmering pale blue panther, hungrily licking her lips as her eyes never left the slightly shaking form of the trapped girl.
Tom visibly shrank and the three people behind him slumped slightly. “They don’t want to see us?” Tom whispered.
Tom glared at the grinning devils before him with as much heat as he could muster. He sighed in resignation when he realised they weren’t affected by it.
Tobias swallowed his mouthful. “Do you want a job Dobby? I need an elf I can trust as my own cook while I’m with child.”
“All right. Now that I’m in this house, Old Bumblefuck up there is going to be more interested in the students here, particularly those of the sixth and seventh years. Be prepared for anything, and I mean anything - Bribes, threats, extra days out of the castle, fewer detentions and the like. First through sixth years, you are to say nothing but the fact that you are loyal to Draco. Not me, not my father. Understand?”
“The cravings – well, what can I say about the cravings. To begin with there’s the food cravings. These are the most frequent of the cravings felt by the carrier. After vomiting for a few days, the cravings set in. Those of us who work with male pregnancies believe it is caused by both the lack of nutrients due to the sickness and the hormones playing ticks on the carrier’s mind and tastebuds. The second most frequent craving is for sex.”
Only six of the seven were in the room as one of them had suddenly remembered that she had to send off a report. None of them minded all that much, considering that it was only the pink annoyance, but after hearing what was in the letter and then the viewing of the memory, the six remaining members had gone into shock. It was worse than what they had been expecting.
“These are the two rooms we have set up for you all. One day in the rooms is the same as an hour in the real world, so by the time you leave here at four this afternoon, you will have been here for a week. We have places where you can sleep when you are tired and food for when you are hungry. You can work at your own pace and once you have finished the written part, you will have a private practical in individual rooms with your own instructor. Now, please stand in your houses – Ravenclaw and Slytherin to my right, Hufflepuff and Gryffindor to my left …”
Tobias yawned and sipped at the herbed water beside him. “I want everything possible in the report – down to where there was dust and how thick it was. I also want all sketches, pictures, graphs, diagrams, tables and lists to be included in the report as well as descriptions, accidents, damage that was found or happened while you were there, creatures that were present – dead or alive. If you can, keep all creatures you find, regardless of their state of living. I want the reports to be so detailed that Weasley would be able to see the room in his minds’ eye.”
She had also made a necklace, earrings and two watches in the same pattern. If her chosen mate agreed to her courting request, then he would be obtaining the masculine watch as well. If not, then the cufflinks would return to her.
“Touchy,” someone else muttered, only to be on the receiving end of an over strengthened tickling charm.
Minerva smiled sadly at the girl. “But it was you yourself that allowed this to happen,” she said, shocking the girl into silence. “The thing about the brand you have is that it does not take hold unless your magic accepts it as punishment for what you did wrong. You already know that your punishment for your part in what happened to Harry that led him to become Tobias is death. Your magic accepted the brand in the hopes that it will not be a long, slow, painful death.”
Amelia watched Tobias as he held three conversations at once and marvelled at how well he was doing. A glance to her left bought her attention to the amused visage of the goblin envoy that had been in the room with them previously.
“Now, I suggest both of you go back to your dors immediately. Mr Weasley, you first, and I will know if you don’t get there.” He waited until he was positive the Weasel was no longer in hearing before turning to the girl.
“Thank you, Lucius. You may rise.” Lucius stood, bowed and returned to his place at his Lord’s side. Once Lucius was in his rightfully place, The Pack of fifteen stepped forward and bowed as one. Tobias smirked internally. His pack had been trained well by the dream drifters.
“No, I’m fi-“ Draco yawned, “fine.” He glared cutely at Harry who had chuckled. “Maybe I am a bit tired, but … stay? Please?”
A beam of light shot towards Tobias as he removed the Sorting Hat. When it hit him, he let out an ear-splitting scream of pain as he burst into white-edged blue and green flames. Phoenix song filled the hall moments before Thanatos flamed to his master’s side. Without hesitation, the flame-bird wrapped his wings around the boy and, once more, triggered his burning reflex.
“No, in fact, it should be able to be added to that potion in the morning with no side effects – but I’ll talk to Severus later to make sure. Now, I do believe that it is time for the two of you to eat.” Algernon laughed. “The two of you and Severus slept through lunch. There is still two and a half hours until supper, but I have something here that will hold you over until then.”
Severus sent a level look at the teen, who grinned as he hand the letters to Luna, who skipped out of the room happily.
Deloris screamed as a loud sizzling came from where the metal touched and the scent of burning hair filled the room.
“Always my dear sister,” Neville replied with a smirk, “but don’t you think you should release Dynamo first?”
Severus sighed. “No Neogennito. As far as I know, your father is still sending you a portkey next weekend. I also think he is as intrigued about your pack mark as Remus, Lucius, Narcissa and I are. Do you think you’d be able to discuss it with us?”
