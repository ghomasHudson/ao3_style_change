"I've never danced before," he confessed, blushing a bit.
"Please Harry." He said.
And a few minutes later they came down there hair and clothes a mess. "And what were you two doing?" Ms. Wealsy said.
"Of course." Mrs. Weasley said.
"What am I supposed to say? I mean I don't even know how to date a boy. And what about sex? How do I have sex with a boy?" Ron said.
I ran from Harry. I can not believe I just kissed him. And now I'm running! What is wrong with me. I should have faced him like a man. But to late now.
"So what are you doing?" He asked blocking the path.
We apeariated to the Leaky Cauldron and the Weasleys are there with Hermione.
When we found the others we got surrounded by death-eaters.
"A defense club." I said and Draco smiled.
"Hello Draco," Harry said and got closer to me. I noticed that he is wearing the normal boy uniform.
I sat down and Crabbe asked. "Why do you look so hopeful?"
"I don't know. I was just sitting in the u-bend when some one came and threw a book at me." She said.
"That would be fun. Where are we going?" Harry asked, bouncing a bit.
I followed the other champions to the room that Dumbledore told us to go to.
"See. Not so bad." I soothed him, rubbing his shoulders.
"Fine. I'm mad at you anyways." I said getting off him.
At the end of the day, we went back to our common room but there is a crowd. "What's going on?" I asked Draco staying close to me.
He then took him to the hospital wing. I said bye to Buckbeak and Draco, Ron and I went back to the castle.
At lunch I saw him again and we sat with the slythren. I pulled him into my lap and we ate.
The adults sent us out to do something so they can talk. Ron led me Harry and Hermione to his room. "Are you alright Harry?" I asked as we sat on the bed.
"So tonight and tomorrow I have detention. I wonder what will happen." Harry said.
Everyone ran out except me, Ron, Hermione, Draco and Neville since he can't leave.
"You may now all partner up and get to the dancing." McGonagall said.
"And if not him the basilisk." Ron added.
"Morning Harry. How did you sleep?" I asked.
"Wait aren't you going to help me?" I asked.
"Harry your boyfreind is threatening my Scabbers," Ron complained.
The owl flew onto a ledge beside me and made a strange sound.
"I just hope we find him. Then we can yell at him for disappearing on us like that." I said, getting a little mad at him.
He gave me a quick kiss. "Just wait a little longer love." He said.
I uncapped the bottle and drank all the potion that is left down.
Harry p.o.v
"Well i will have to eventually." I said and winked.
I started scratching my arm, so Draco moved my hand away. "Why are you scratching your wrist?" He asked, moving my hand.
I moved to where I am beside Harry and hugged him to my chest. "I'm sowwy my wittle Harry."
"Why do I keep getting called an idiot?" Ron grumbled, getting up to go find Blaise.
"Oi! Stupid Dog!"Ron yelled as a blond wolf came running over to us.
So after defense Harry stayed behind and I walked out.
Then there is voldimort. Who is my enamy. And I don't want him to see anything in my head. Excspesaly. The ones I care about.
"I'm fine. Sorry I woke you." He said looking down and sat back down on the couch.
"Wow, Harry you know you do look nice in a dress," Pansy said.
"Yes." Harry said.
I looked at my hands and said, "Yes." He just shrugged in response.
"I love you. I'm sorry that I did not spend much time with you this year, I wanted to. I'm sorry." He said and began crying. "I know you were upset." He added.
We then went to bed and fell asleep.
"Don't worry about it Draco." Harry said.
"Okay. Well, I was wondering when you would like for me to mark you?" I said.
"Good. Could have been better." Hermione answerd.
At home, I layed in bed. Potter said a childish word, and hugged a stuffie. At least I think it was a stuffie. May not be.
"Draco I'm hungry, can we go to dinner now?" I asked.
I can't belive this. I'm being so weak in front of Draco. I bet he thinks this is horrible. "Harry stay here. I will be right back." Draco said, sitting me down and walking to the bathroom.
When we got there we sat down on our sides as class began.
"Why? Is it because of all the pink?" Pansy asked.
"Yes. When I was not with you over the summer. And that night that your godfathers did not want us to sleep together." He said. "Well are you going to?" Draco asked.
Harry p.o.v
He walked out. "Harry you are not a bad mate and I love you. Please tell me why you would do such a thing to yourself. You don't deserve it." I got up and hugged him because he was going to cry. "You are my beautiful angel and you are to beautiful to cry." I said.
"They said they would be ecstatic for you to live with us. Especially mother." Draco said, wrapping an arm around my shoulder.
I looked over at Ginny who was being held in place by her arm by Ron.
"What does it look like?" Was Lockheart answer.
"Now we're ya hear that?" He asked.
"I still don't like it." Hermione said.
"What happened?" I asked sitting next to them.
Me and Draco are sitting on the Weasley's couch as Narcissa and Mrs Weasley are cooking dinner. Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Hermione, and Ron are trying to cheer me up. I still can not get the dream out of my head.
"When I said get a room I did not actually think you would." Blaise said.
"Well it was a little funny when he got scared of Lucif and fell into your arms." Draco said and mimicked Ron passing out. A little like when he mimicked mine in third year.
"Well I don't care. Please Draco just leave me alone." He said, curling into a ball.
"I guess that makes sense. So what is the plan?" Ron said.
"Harry it's not his fault. I'm sure he has a perfect explanation for us." Draco said and kissed the top of my head.
Draco p.o.v
We all drew wands and I said, "why did you attack Ron, you traitor."
"Dragons is the first task. It's so scary Draco!" Harry said hugging me.
That night I decided to take a walk since I was unable to sleep. Mainly because Harry is still on my mind. He does not seem mad or discusted. He mostly seemed. Flustered? Embarrassed? Eather was cute.
Hermione released the balls and we started the game. Me and Harry started circling the pich as the adults and ones not playing sat in the stands. Harry started staring at me and slowly coming to me.
Ron and Hermione sat down and Pansy said, "hi I am Pansy I'm sure you all know Blaise, Crabbe, and Goyle."
I got up and said, "I am done with this." And walked out.
Time skip to Deathly Hallows.
"Yea. Wonder why I did not see them in the first place. I mean I must have seen my parents die." He said, cuddling into me more.
We laughed and it is time to go. Pansy went to the Slythren room.
"Yeah. Let's go Ron." Blaise said and dragged Ron out of the room. Hermione decided to go to the library and Pansy went with, leaving me and Draco.
"Goes well with the outfit. You should wear that more." Draco said smiling.
"Oh. So I'm a werewolf."  Blaise said.
Draco groaned and got up. I did the same and we got dressed. Me feeling like a girl today, I put on the girl uniform along with a pair of high heels. When Draco came and stood next to me I was just as tall as him. He looked at me and laughed. "Happy to be tall?" he asked.
"Alright let's go Draco." Harry said and we ran off to Dumbledores office.
He nodded so I got ready for bed and we fell asleep.
Now I'm digging my grave. Draco growled at me as I just smiled.
"Then we have the right to treat you like an innocent girl," Hermione explained.
I sighed and went home.
I laughed and said, "they are great friends. Though they act like I'm an innocent little girl."
I began laughing at him and he glared at me. The wall then opened behind him drawing our attention. We both got in front of it. Both Harry and I touched it. We both got sucked in.
Harry p.o.v
"Hermione asked what took me and Harry so long. I answerd. How about you two?" Draco replied.
I smirked. "Yes." I said then ran off with Draco following.
"Morning Harry," Draco said and hugged me.
"Yes." I answered.
"We need to be back in time for when the two other schools come." Hermione said.
"It's okay. It's almost breakfast time anyways. What's wrong? Do you want to talk about it?" I said.
"Hey boys. Why took you so long?" Hermione asked.
"Oh okay. Well let's get going." I said, getting up with Draco.
He looked at me with a 'really?' look. "Simple. Talk to him and apologize for your actions towards him." He smirked before turning back to what he was doing at his desk.
There is a white and pink rose, treacle tart and chocolate. Ron gave me a raised eyebrow and I shrugged. I read the letter and it said:
Draco sat next to me. "Yes. But I think he is hot." Draco said, smirking.
"I missed you to." Harry replied.
"But. Mione. Malfoy is acting weird." Ron said.
When the car parked, still floating, the windows rolled down and the twins and Ron are looking back at me.
"I'm fat." I said and felt some tears fall.
I looked at the paper and see that I have just written his name over and over.
I decided to ignore him so I began eating again.
When we finished we took the portkey back to Hogwarts.
"Your cute." I said and pulled him on my lap and kissed his neck.
"I'm fine. I love you." I said, pulling him closer.
I think I lost a lot of blood, because there is a flying car coming straight to this house.
"And you are a prefect so you are going to have a lot of work Draco." Hermione said.
Hagrid looked first surprised, then scared. "Oh. Er... How did yeh b'come one?" He asked.
"Ow Hermione that wounded me." I said, putting my hand on my heart.
I looked at my hands. "I believe you. I'm sorry for not trusting you. I'm a horrible mate." I said and started crying harder.
"Want to take an shower together? It will be faster." I said, smirking.
"Hello kids. Lemon drop?" He greeted.
Me and Draco nodded and I blushed. "I did not know Draco wanted to date me."
Draco p.o.v
"What took you two so long to get up?" Blaise asked.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked.
The next day I woke up early feeling all the depressed feelings hit me like a wave. I truly do not want to take the potion.
"A evil cloaked figure that sucks all the happiness from you." I explained.
I stood up and held out my hand to Harry. "May I have this dance?" I asked.
I rolled my eyes and said, "the sorting hat originally  wanted me in Slytherin."
•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•
"I am aware. It's just kind of fun to be a kid, and it helps relieves stress." I explained, and looked up.
The next day, when I woke up. I just cuddled up more to Draco, wanting to make up for lost time.
"And you called her a lier?" She asked.
She rolled her eye and said, "because we have classes so, you need to eat and we would need to go. "After eating, we went to our classes.
Harry looked upset but played it off as fine.
His head shot up his eyes going wide. "w-what are you doing h-here?" He replied.
"I don't care where we do it just as long as we are alone and I'm with you." He said and picked me up bridle style.
"Wanna play with some stuffies?!" Ginny asked changing the subject.
"What have you two done?" Harry asked.
"It's fine love. I'll make sure you won't get killed." I said, sitting down next to him.
I stood in front of him and put both hands at the side of his head and leaned forward. "You should have remembered." I said and bit his neck leaving a bruise.
He ran into an abandoned class room and I followed behind. "Harry. You okay?" I asked, sitting at a desk with him and putting an arm around his waist.
"I-I'm sorry." He sobbed.
I looked at myself in the mirror, frowning. I am fat. I don't see how Draco can even look at me. Draco came behind me and wrapped his arms around me. "What's wrong Harry?" He asked.
"I was wondering if you came to your senses yet, chose me, and left that mutt." She slowly answered ,fluttering her eyelashes adding to the 'desired' effect of a decapitated rodent.
"So I guess they were just at the wrong place at the wrong time," Snape said cooly.
"Harry please. I'm sorry for making you sleep. How about you let me show you how sorry I am." I said seductively.
"Hm no." I said and pinned him to the couch and began kissing him.
"What's a muggle?" He asked.
"Ask what?" Ron asked.
"We are going to Hagrids. I should probably go get changed though." He said, indicating his clothes.
"But Blaise is a boy," Ron pointed out.
After the man said the words and we said our vows, we gave eachother the rings and kissed.
"It's okay you are doing great," I said smiling.
When we got there we sat down and a few minutes later Hermione came in as well.
Then, Hermione, Ron and Colin walked up.
"Alright I'm out." Harry said and walked out.
"Yes Draco. Why would I not?" He said.
A few years later we adopted a boy named Scorpio Albus Malfoy Potter. Of course he is a wizard. Since he was muggle born he was kicked out, his family scared of him. So now we have him and he was grown up loved and cared for.
Now we are watching the two other schools leave. Me, Ron, Hermione, and Draco are standing near the entrance.
"Yes." I replied.
Pansy was trying to calm me down, but I couldn't see Harry or the dragon.
We began walking along the gardens, which were beautiful at night. We caught a glimpse of some people making out. And we saw Hagrid with the Beuxbaton head master, though we left them alone. Finally, we got a good place to sit and relax.
When we finished our homework, I was burning like the logs in the fireplace. Draco has not even laid a finger on me since we have gotten back and if he does not I may spontaneously combust.
"Okay. I-I'm gay and gender fluid," I said.
"Hermione? Ron? Help." I said while they all laughed. Though Ginny is scowling.
The next day we both got up and got ready for the day. "So Harry I was thinking about taking you on a date." I said as we walked to the great hall, putting an arm around his waist.
"So are you two going to go to the room of requirement again or sleep here?" Blaise asked.
Ron p.o.v
The pages started flipping. Then suddenly stoped and said, fifty years ago. The spine started to glow. Then i was pulled in
Sorry for the short chapter.
"So my Harry why did Lucif try and kill Ron?" Draco asked as we went to the great hall.
Harry nodded and hugged me to him. We decided that we should get ready for bed, so we did then got into bed cuddling. "Draco." Harry said, quitely as every one came in.
"Hermione you are the most amazing friend." Ron said.
"That would be great Draco." Remus said.
When we finally got to the gate we got our portkey and left to the Weasleys.
"No! What would make you think we would do such a thing!" I ask offended.
I huffed and got up and walked out sassly like Draco normally does. I just wish that I had long hair so I could sassly flip it. But oh well.
I pulled away and he said and pouted. "can you help me with my homework Draco?"
He moaned and tried moving, but I'm not let him. So, I pulled away from him and said, "Harry, come on. This is not hard."
"Come on Harry." Draco said and led me to the kitchen.
"I'm sorry for waking you." He said.
Right now me and Draco are cuddling in my bed at Grimuald place. "Harry?"
"Sorry Sirius." I said.
When that class was over; we went to our next one which is potions.
"What about me?" Ginny asked a glimmer of hope in her eyes.
Hermione shook her head and said, "no. I have no one I want to date."
When we walked in the room Hermione jumped up. "Harry what happened?" She asked. I just stood there looking at the ground.
"I did not ask you I asked Draco. Draco help meeeeeee," I said and sat onto his lap cuddling him.
We all turned and Viktor is coming up. "Hello, Harry. I just wanted to tell you that in order to figure out the next task you have to put the egg under water." Viktor said smiling at me.
He laid on the bed and said, "feeling little better now. Idk why I threw up."
"Harry pleas don't die on me. I love you so much." I said.
"I think we should just all do it now." Hermione reprimanded.
"Ron Blaise is right it's not your foult. It's Greyback foult." Draco said.
Harry said something that sounded like "I'll kill you all."
We then made a plan.
I looked at Hermione and motioned for her to go ahead and explain, "It's his name. When we say his name they come. That's why every one fears his name. That's how they did it in the past." Hermione explained.
I stopped for a minute then looked at him. "Why do you ask?" I asked, not wanting to answer. Not with every one listening.
I went back to sit with my friends, who smiled knowingly at me.
"Draco are you even listening!?" Hermione practically yelled.
"Your father will hear about this!" Ron said mocking me.Me and Harry laughed.
As soon as I was done I sent it off to my father. Then I went back down stairs and pulled Harry onto my lap. "How long do you think it will take till he does something?" Harry asked.
"If you read you will find out why. Now get out you blood-sucking leech, you're distracting them." Hermione said.
"Draco." Ron said making Draco look at him. "If you get Harry pregnat before he is ready I'll fucking casarate you."
"Poor Ron-"
But I just kept walking.
when we both came Draco collapsed beside me and held me close. "I love you Harry." he said.
"The seventh years may put their names in the goblet, no one under. This tournament has a fatal history as I have said in the past, it is not to be taken lightly. That will be all. Tuck in." He said and sat down at the teacher's table as the food appeared.
He woke up and smiled at me. "So Harry what are your plans for today?" Draco said.
"Yeah. I don't think he is my type." She said and walked away.
"Hello, Draco and Hermione. Lemon drop?" He said.
"But I have no need for a bra. I have nothing." I said motioning to my chest.
"I don't care Harry. You are like my brother I'm supposed to worry about stuff like this." Ron said smiling.
I went down to the kitchen and Harry is eating a cookie.
"Don't know. We have to go. see ya later ron." I said.
"Oh. Her name's Snow." I said bashfully.
"Well he lived over a thousand years ago. For all, we know you could be," I pointed out. Then I added slyly, "though I have heard that Parcelmouths are really good with their mouths." That made Harry blush, Hermione rolled her eyes, and Ron made a gagging noise.
I frowned, guessing that his last dose has wore off. "I'll never leave you." I said and handed him the potion.
"Great your both awake let's get breakfast." Hermione said slamming her book shut.
I sighed and said, "okay, fine."
"I did not expect a dementor. I thought you would have had the Dark Lord or something." Professor Lupin said.
As soon as we walked in, we sat down and Snape is late. "What took you two so long?" Hermione asked.
"Fine. You really want to know? Me and Harry had sex. Happy." I said, making Harry bury his head on his arms.
We then went to our common room. Blaise and Ron is not there and Hermione and Pansy are talking.
"Witch was very rude of you weaslbee." Draco said glaring at him.
"Well it's the beginning of the weekend so I want to spend some alone time with my boyfreind." I said and sat him on the couch.
"But Hermione I was being a good friend and waking them. And making sure that they get here in time." Ron whined.
Draco p.o.v
Ginny and I pouted, but Hermione just walked out,dragging Ron with her.
"Yes, I am. Now, how about instead of complaining like a girl you go ask him out!" I said.
I gave Harry a 'I told you so!' look. He just rolls his eyes, then we go back to cuddling.
"DRACO, HARRY GET UP!" We heard Blaise and Ron yell through the curtains.
We got up and got dressed. I also gave Harry his potion.
We all got up and went to the hospital wing, Ginny and dad going home.
"Actually most owners give them a place to sleep and food. The cloth that they were is just a symble to there working. I am sure that they can get a new one. They would just have to make a new one. Dobby one time did." Draco explained.
"Uh. No." I said. "Why do you ask?"
"Or else what?" He asked.
I grabbed Harry's arm and dragged him up stairs.
The last couple days has been depressing on every one. We had the funeral and Dumbledore told us how Cedric died.
"I don't find or put myself in danger. Danger finds me and puts me in it." I said defensively.
"Aww thank you, Harry. You're comfortable too."  I said.
He then turned around and started to go the opposite way close to the wall. He then started to run and yelled: "It's going to kill!" And we followed.
Harry p.o.v
When we got there Snape spoke up. "Alright. This year I will be assigning partners. They will be: Mr. Malfoy with Mr. Potter, Ms. Granger with Ms. Parkinson, Mr. Weasley with Mr. Zabini...." I stopped listening as me and Draco sat down. "This will be your seat for the rest of the year. No complaints. Today we are making Amortentia. Can anyone tell me what it is and it's distinctive features?" Snape asked walking around. Hermione raised her hand. "Miss Granger?" He said.
"Oh merlin what Happened?" Hermione said.
So that night Draco went out and I got into bed and silently cried. Of course the potion has been working less and less great, but I am not letting Draco know. I don't need to worry him.
"What happened?" Hermione asked.
"Why are you kissing me?" Harry asked.
"Harry it's okay. Your just a child. You can only do so much. You will be fine." He said, hugging me.
"Oh, but draco. I love you." She said and just as the door opened, she kissed me. I heard a sob as I got Hermione off.
"I don't care. I am sure our mate bond will help me find him." I said, walking out of the common room.
Hermione woke me up a bit before we got to Hogwarts, yelling at Ron, and I, to get changed. We both ran out, after putting James and Simba in the trunk of course, and got changed into our robes.
We shrugged and said, "Maybe."
"Well Ginny is going to be expelled. Let's go visit Harry." Dumbledore said.
"I hope that happens. I mean. I would be nothing without you. And u really mean it if a soulmate dies the other would go into deep depression and eventually go crazy." Draco said a little in a joking tone but I know it's Sirius.
"But that takes time away from you. I need you my Harry." I said, hugging him and stopping us from walking.
I just followed what it says and surprisingly finished before Draco. "Draco is this right?" I asked.
We looked at her and Ron felt her head and said, "are you okay?"
"Actually I feel like a girl today." Harry said.
"Yes but you do to. And it's your turn." I said.
"I'm going to miss him." Harry said.
"I think it's beautiful," I said and put it on.
"Hey Harry." He said.
She sighed and closed her book. "Well you know what Harry likes and you have given him some presents, and you are nicer. Have you tried to like.. actually spend time with them?" She asked.
"That is correct. You will all be making this. You may begin." He said and sat down at his desk.
Once we got there Harry was happy. I placed the food out and we began eating.
I was sitting in the common room with Ron. "I swear something is off with Malfoy." I started
I allowed my fangs to grow and I bit into my wrist drawing blood. I held it up to Harry and he drank. I smiled at how good it felt.
He looked at me and said, "But you don't love me. I hurt you." He said.
"Good idea. He needs it." Draco said, putting an arm around my waist.
Near the end of the day, Dumbledore called me to his office. So, I went to the office, Draco stayed behind with my friends, since Dumbledore asked for me to be alone.
"Why is my friend gay?" Ron asked.
We got up scared that hermione would walk in.  I got free in a dress today feeling feminine.
I cuddled to my new husband glad I finally have alone time with him. I cuddled up to him and we just sat in silence enjoying each other's presence. Then we fell asleep.
He chuckled and picked me up bridle style. I laughed a little as he carried me to the bath and set me in and turned on the water. He then climbed in behind me. When the water was all full, he turned it off and began to scrub shampoo and conditioner into my hair, massaging my head.
"I'm the Slytherin Quidditch captain." Draco said.
"Alright. What happened? Why is Harry tied to a bed?" Ron said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
He turned over to me and shook his head, then held his arms out to me, like a child asking to be picked up. I got into the bed and cuddled him. "I miss Dumbldore. The school won't be the same without him." Harry said.
Harry giggled and said, "he kissed me." And continued to giggle.
"May you give it to us?" Hermione asked.
"Draco who is Sirius Black?" Harry asked.
I got up and opened the door. Ron, Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise are standing there.
I nodded and pulled Harry to were he is faceing me and kissed him.
I began kissing and bighting his neck and he allowed it.
"Well?" He said.
"He is. Has been treating me like a prince since we got back together." I said.
dream
"But Harry is so comfortable," I said and began cuddling him.
"Okay. If you ever need to talk to me, talk to me. Let's get ready for going to my parents for christmas. Tomorrow we are going to Hogsmeade, then the day after to my parents." Draco said.
"You want to know something good?" Draco asked. I nodded and he said, "today is Saturday."
We all sat back in comfortable silence and looked out at the scenery around us.
"Just seemed to good to be true. I mean you know that my aunt and uncle are mean." I replied.
"Aww. Was that all?" I asked.
I smiled as I started to fall asleep. "Are you tired love?" Draco asked.
Harry slowly bowed not taking his eyes off the hippogriff. Since the hippogriff did nothing, Hagrid told Harry to get back but he just bowed lower and looked down. It bowed back and Harry went up to pet it. He looked back at us smiling.
"Do you have any homework Draco?" Hermione asked.
"Feel better Draco?" He asked.
"And not only that, but Sirius and Remus are going to be super mad." Hermione added.
"We probable would have all been dead because of Quill." Hermione said, we of course agreed with her.
"Thank you for proposing, Draco, I love you." Harry said, and kissed my chest.
"What did I tell you yesterday. Make your move before someone else is lucky enough to. JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!" I yelled and walked away.
He rubbed my back and kissed my forehead.
Draco p.o.v
When we walked out Ron is holding onto Blaise who is holding Ron. "We are sorry Ron, but you should really knock." Draco said.
"We only get in trouble if we get caught. Other then that it's breaking the rules." Harry said, smiling.
"I'm not sure. Maybe we can have the wedding here and do everything else at your manor." Harry replied.
"Also I will need to for full moons and there is one tonight. I'll have to leave you alone tonight. You can go to the Gryffindor tower if you want." I said.
Harry walked out smiling happily. "What is going on?" I asked pulling him to me.
He healed me, then we were sent back as Snape talked to Dumbledore.
Every one else is awake to watching.
"No. Plus I will not date him." I said.
I frowned and said, "im sure it's not that bad. It's just detintion. I'm sure I can talk to my father and be can get you back on the team and out of detention."
He sighed and said. "Dumbledore is having me look at memories about Tom Riddle."
The last day of school we got onto the train, sharing a compartment. As we left, some Slytherins came and apologized for the way they acted to Blaise and Draco.
She went over then she came back and said, "Because he does not want to talk to a bad friend. That is what he said."
"Are you calling me fat?" He said.
"We are not. You muggles are weird." I said.
"Im fine profeser." I yawned.
"Did you say thank you?" I asked just to be sure. He nodded. "Okay. You were still speaking in snake." I added.
He did the same and we all put them back in the cage. "I think that we should leave two out for Lockheart," Draco suggested putting two on the desk.
Around midnight I carefully got out of Draco's arms and went down to the abandoned bathroom. I took out my wand and used the cutting spell a few times.
"But Hermione I don't want to. And i need to find names for the bunnies." Harry whinned.
I looked at Harry who is just nibbling on bread and tried to think of a way to make him better.
"Impero," I said.
"I'm fine. Why?" I said.
"I don't know. I just ran. Then Dean and Seamus found me. What can you do Harry? I can never show my face again!" Ron said.
"I don't know... Maybe? I just didn't want Harry hurt." Ron said.
"Well he was in my bed." Ron said.
"Hey Potter." I heard an all too familiar voice say behind me.
"Yes I do. I love you." I said and put the potion back.
I smiled as we began looking through the menu.
He glanced at me and hid his hand from view.
"And is there something wrong with that?" I asked.
"I did not. Though I wanted to. I wanted to so badly Draco. Please help me." I said, feeling  the tears come back.
"I think your cute." I said and the girls awwed again.
"Then why are the Weasley twins on the table?" He asked.
Draco p.o.v
Harry came into the common room looking flustered and scared. "are you okay?" I asked.
They nodded and Blaise said, "yep. I guess that we should just accept that we are going to prank her."
"Not sure." He said and started to feed me again.
When that class is over I asked Harry to wait for me out side of the room and went up to talk to Snape.
"So I and you are sharing a room?" Harry asked.
We sit down and begin eating. "So tomorrow we are going to be going to the Weasleys' for a wedding, Draco will be there to," Remus said.
I turned to the voice and it was Hermione. "Yes Hermione?" I said.
Once we got there, we went to the robe shop, passing Fred and George's joke shop. Over the summer the twins wanted to bring some light to these dark times, so they made a joke shop, I helped by giving them the money I won from the tri-wizard tournement.
A few minutes later he fell asleep and I did shortly after.
Then we began our search.
Dumbldore stood up. "Today students I have brung an old teacher back. He will teach defense till I find a new teacher. May you all give a hand to....."
I ran out, picking up his sent. I followed it all the way... to a dead end. It's a wall. How can Harry disappear in a wall?
I leaned down to his ear and whispered, "don't listen to him. The answer is yes."
"But it's blank." He said.
His eyes teared up. "At least don't make me sleep again. I don't want it." He said.
I blushed and he kissed my ear making me give a quite moan. He then sat up and took off mine and his night pants, and he took off his night shirt. I ran my hands down his chest as he slowly took off my boxers. I winners making him look at me then took them off completely. He sat there for a moment looking at my now completely naked body. He leaned down and began sucking my penis, I let out a loud moan and hoped I did not wake Ron and Blais.
"No its alright. I'll meet you there." Harry said and walked off.
"Wait, what do you mean by everyone?" I asked.
After we were done the potion was a violet color and it smelled like Draco. I looked at him and his eyes were yellow. "You alright Draco?" I asked.
"And I bet Ron's is red." I said, not sure if he seen his room.
"Yes." I said and happily skipped to his side.
Ron asked me if it really is a good idea. But I told him not to worry no way will Simba get hurt or any one find him.
We decided to go to Dumbldore since Harry began talking about hurting Mr. Weasly.
"You okay Harry?" I asked.
"But Draco-"
I glared at him as we all went to breakfast. Ginny happy skipping next to us. "So Draco what do you think of Harry?' Ginny asked.
"Ron!" We all yelled.
We then fell asleep. Now not as boyfriends, but as fiances.
I took the coin and looked at it. On one side is a snake and the other a lion. "This is cool Hermione how did you think of this?" I asked.
"Good." Sirius replied.
"No I don't want to." Harry said.
"Come on Dray we need to get to McGonagall." He said.
"The heir to Slytherin wearing a dress." One of the twins said making Harry look down.
"Come on Harry it's lunch time." I said, shaking him.
"Great so it's alright if I kiss you?" Draco said.
Ah. Umbitch. Just as ugly as I remember. I looked over to Harry who is staring at her in disgust. Kind of cute.
"Then we hex the living daylights out of him," Ron said.
So we ran for our lives.
"So Harry I heard you are going to get an Animigus license. How is that going for you?" Ron said, ignoring how Draco is glaring at his sister.
"I just wanted to walk outside."I said.
"What?" I said and walked back in.
"Why is Malfoy staring at you?" Ron asked.
"I feel a little bad for teasing you. So I'm going to make it up to you." He said, straddling my waist and leaning over me.
When I got to the great hall Harry is not sitting with Ron. I went over with Pansy and Blaise. Blaise told me he would go and talk to Ron. So it's just me, Hermione, Pansy, and Harry, who is wearing the boy's uniform.
"We could get it from Snape after breakfast." Hermione said.
Me and Harry are shaken awake. Harry turned over to see Ron. "Bloody Hell Harry. Why do you have bruises all over you?" Ron asked.
We then walked out and went back to the Slytherin common room. Just to find our friends gone.
"Hello, Potter, Hermione, and Weasley," I said, joining them.
Draco p.o.v
"No your not. You are wonderful. But why did you think I don't love you?" I asked.
I shrugged and saw the lady looking at us. Draco looked over and glared. "I don't like her." Draco said as she came over.
"Hey Mason." I said and turned around.
" Aww. Are you two are on a date?" Pansy asked, coming over.
"Alright, I have to go bye Harry," Colin said taking one last picture and leaving.
I then sat on the couch and began crying.
When it's was time for dinner Draco fed me again then we went to sleep Draco making me cuddle with him. though I am not complaining.
"But it's not like I really wanted it. And plus, he has only been dating this boy for a month. This is not right!" I yelled drawing attention to myself.
Draco looked at me and said, "well Harry do you want to date?"
Harry's P.O.V.*
The next day Mason and I ate breakfast and since it's the weekend got more prepared for the wedding. "I can't believe that it's only in three days." Mason said.
I grinned and git up. "Are you ready for the wedding?" I asked.
"Sorry." I said, getting a new piece of paper.
When we got to the great hall Dumbledore had the first years sorted and introduced the new teacher and told every one Snape is now the DADA teacher.
We walked inside. "Come on Harry. We can put our stuff in my room." I said.
"I love you to. I was so scared. There were two people. I dont know who they were." I said and curled up to Draco.
"Fine." I said quietly before going to get parchment, ink ,and quill. We did our homework that night.
"In a treasure chest?" I asked.
"I'm fine Draco. What happened who won?" He asked.
"Oh, 'morning Harry!" Sirius said, and Remus going back to making pancakes.
"Fine. Harry love wake up." I said, shaking him a bit.
"He said he would like an owl." I said.
"Yeah. I have been missing Draco." Harry said, moving impossibly closer to me.
I nodded and went to my room.
Then Blaise said, "So what are you going to do?"
"You wizards and weird words. How long did it take for you to figure it all out?" Mason asked.
"Its fine and over with." I said, staring at the food now.
"How did you get there? I top not you." He said and Ron gagged.
"Yes. Do you not want to?" I asked worriedly.
Draco p.o.v
"No. I just wanted to make him wear something. He could have said no." I said.
"Mad. He just wants to be alone." I said and began crying. "It's all my fault. If I just paid more attention to him I would have known." I said.
"Ron, spider!" I yelled.
"Harry you promised me something," I said.
"What does that mean?" Draco asked, worried.
We walked in and  sat on the couch. We can finally relax. No wedding no children. Just me and draco for a month.
"I hid in a closet." Harry replied.
"You can go home and see if he is at your house." Hermione said go Mason.
"You wizards are weird." Mason said also laughing.
"What?" We all said.
Draco p.o.v
I mean. Is it to mutch to ask for to live happy with my mate and have no trubles.
The girls and Harry decided that it's time to go to breakfast. Blaise fallowed and I stood in the doorway looking at Draco who also got up. "You okay?" I asked.
But we then went to class learning that Ron and Blaise had sex Ron bottoming again. Wich made me and Harry laugh.
"I think that's a good idea. What about you Oliver?" The Slytherin captain asked.
"Me to." Harry said.
Once done we went back to camp.
Draco p.o.v
The wolf growled at Ginny who backed away and looked at me. The wolf sat down, and a minute later Draco was sitting there, crouched down.
"You two are so cute together. I ship it." Pansy said.
"Yes. My wittle puppy." Harry said, nuzzling his head in my chest.
Pansy shrugged and Ron said,  "maybe we can go to hogsmead." Blaise said.
"But your my ickle Dracy poo." He said, pouting.
"But-"
"Stay in and cuddle?" He asked.
"I have been good. Though I wish that Harry can stay with me longer." I said.
"Yes. Sleep more my Harry." Draco said.
"Okay, thank you. I think I'm going to take a nap now." I said, laying down.
He got checked up and then we went to have lunch.
Draco p.o.v
"Thank you Harry it's adorable." I said smiling sincerely.
"Harry, what happened?" Dumbledore said.
And now the moment you have all been waiting for..........
"It's not really. His walls are mostly coverd in Quidditch pictures." Harry said sitting on my bed.
I looked at the door and saw the Malfoys - senior and junior. I hid in a wardrobe and thought: Ha, back into the closet.
"Well, it would be nice for you to come tell us," Ron said.
When we got there, we began to walk around and get our items. When we were about done, and ready to go get ice cream, when Ginny came over and said, "Harry, I saw a new shop that has kids stuff. Would you like a new stuffie?"
Then we got up and went to classes.
"I mean really Harry, you just don't get it." Ron said with a hopeless look on his face.
"Oww Draco. Why did you do that?" I asked.
"But Harry we want to help. If you don't tell us we can't help." Pansy said, frowning.
"Dumbledore. Do you think we can stay so we can make sure Harry is okay?" Sirius asked.
"Draco he. He." Harry shook his head and sat on the couch.
"Sorry Draco I am sure that you will be alright with sharing a room with Ron Harry and Blaise right?" Sirius asked.
"It will be fine with them. How do you use muggle money?" Draco asked.
"Harry love, I just want to. Is it so bad?" Draco asked. No it's just... I don't want you to always spend money on me." I said.
"Morning Draco. And I'm not sure." I said.
I woke up and Harry is not here. Everyone else is awake also except for Ron and Blaise. I woke them up and they detected my worry. "What is wrong Draco?" Blaise asked.
But, since this has been going on for a week, Draco took me to the nurse. She had me lay on a bed and she waved her wand over my stomach, and the tip turned green.
"But that does not mean you try and kill him in his sleep." I said and set Lucif on my bed.
"No problem, Harry, I love you." I said and kissed the top of his head.
I looked at Hermione, worried.
"Get a different one?" I said.
"You are an idiot. That curse is Unforgivable for a reason, which is why you should not have agreed to let him try it on you." Draco said.
"I don't know what you are talking about." I drawled, a wave of unease rushing over my body.
Ron and Blaise then both came in.
After breakfast Harry went to the bathroom, telling us to go ahead and that he will catch up. So we went, me having a bad feeling about it. But I still ignored it.
"You know Harry, you squeal like a girl. Then again you are the girl in your relationship." Ron said
"Okay. I will meet you at the library after classes." I sighed not wanting to leave Harry so soon after marking him.
"Thanks. Your parents are alright with us?" I asked him.
"Oh okay. Let's dance Harry." I said and took him over to dance.
I smiled and lightly kissed him and pulled away. "Ah yes. That was where." He said and kissed me hard.
I sat there in shock wondering how he found out. Since he has been my mate I quit the cutting and been eating more, but I still did think about it. "I used to hurt myself, but I quit. I do still have some depression stuff, but I quit hurting myself. I also used to starve myself, But it stopped." I said.
"Easy for you to say. You have a soulmate and before that you were gay." Ron said sounding a little annoyed.
"I'm sure she is not that stupid." Blaise said.
We then helped set every thing up and made sure that everyone and everything is ready.
Also, Malfoy is staring at me.
I quickly landed and ran to the hospital wing.
"I was just having fun." He said.
"I know just try. For me." I said and kissed his head.
"Harry." Draco said, nudging me a bit.
I heard a growl and looked at Draco. "Did he growl at me?" Remus said.
"They abused me. In all ways." I said. Draco growled.
When we went to dinner I told them about what happened with the egg.
When we got there we got into carriges Ron and Blaise joining us hickeys on there neck and cloths and hair a mess.
"I don't need a babysitter, Ron. I can do what I want without telling you." I said and rolled my eyes.
"I believe you. But when I asked you who he was you could have told me."
"Okay, why is Snow in there?" He asked.
I'm feeling fearless right now. "All the way." I said and I kissed his neck.
" What were you two doing in there?" Hermione asked.
I got up and put my hands in my pockets and I felt cool metal in one of them.
I looked at Draco and he seems conflicted. "Harry I'm sorry but I guess there is nothing that can be done," Draco said and hugged me.
The door opened and closed and I felt the weight of the bed shift and arms wrap around me. "It's okay Draco." I heard Pansy say. "You don't need him."
He gave a light moan as I put my tongue in his mouth.
Draco then got up and done the same. "Morning my Harry. What would you like to do today?" He asked.
"Harry please I need you Harry. Don't marry this muggle. I can't live without you." Draco said getting on his knees.
"I killed no one!" The spider said.
He got on top of me and looked at me. "What are you doing?" I asked him.
"Okay Harry. If you ever want to talk about anything Harry you can talk to me." Draco said.
I saw the others come as I am trying to get Ginny away.
I puted and said, "but... But dwaco. Pweas."
"I love you to. Now let's go to the station.
"Well too bad he is my mate I could do as I wish with him," Draco said and kissed my cheek.
I got up and walked out. Then Draco showed up. Oh, joy.
The next day we got up and Harry has been quite all the way to breakfast. He did not even complain about taking the potion.
"It means that by doing what Narcissa said I could make you do what I want." Harry said sitting next to me.
I thought about it and said, "Moaning Myrtle's bathroom."
She nodded and dismissed us. I dragged Harry to the room of requirement deciding to finish what we started.
"He who shall not be named went to them and they joined him. They asked me to also, but I said no and they disowned me. We need a shorter name for him." He answered.
I then got back to my room,right on time, and got ready for bed.
"Because the clothes you have are too big for you and sometimes show to much skin of yours. That is not for every one to see. Only for me." Draco said.
"Yes the first time I met Ron, Harry and Ron was sitting in one of the train compartments and I got jealous and made a bad impression." I said, frowning at that memory.
"Where is the real Mad-Eye?" Snape demanded.
Dobby came up and said, "The great Harry Potter that you said is 'the best' and you're always talking about?" Dobby asked.
"I would stop moving if I were you." He said dangerously. So I stopped moving. "I just want to have a little fun. Nothing to bad."  He said and started kissing me.
When we got there we asked to see Tom Riddle and she led us to his room. We walked in. "Hello. I'm Tom Riddle. Who are you? I have never seen you before or do I just not remeber. I don't remeber a lot." He said.
"Guess that means that we should all go. Night." Pansy said and walked out.
I did not even realize I was. "Nothing. It's fine. Just nothing." I said, and hugged Blaise tight.
"Good. Pansy will be here tomorrow with her parents. Oh and Draco, do you know who will be are teacher this year?" Ron said.
Draco fallowed and said, "oh come on Harry it's not that bad."
"Later Harry. Let's go before Hermione and Pansy think I dragged you to the common room and tied you to the bed." He said. So we walked out, Draco fixing his hair and me fixing my robes.
"Sorry but we can't hear it over the screeching." I said sarcastically and Harry jabbed me in the ribs for being mean.
He whimpered as I got out a bottle of lube and put some on my cock and fingers. I began placing my fingers inside Harry and he moaned. Harry wiggled his butt as I pushed my fingers deeper in. Then I pulled them out and thrust my dick into him. I began thrusting in and out of him, making him gasp and moan.
Blaise and I are back in the Leaky Cauldron just drinking. I thought back to the great times that Harry and I had. And all the times we would talk about the future. Having kids getting married where we will live. But none of that has happened. All because I was an idiot.
"What does that mean?"
"Of course Draco," I said. He pushed me onto my back and got on top. He smiled at me and kissed my neck. He then bit and I felt a slight pain that quickly turned to pleasure. After a few minutes, he finished and licked the bight helping it close.
Then we sat down. "I have no clue why I dumped that potion out. I like being happy. Happy is much more nicer." He said.
"Come on Harry your all skin and bones. Plus you are going to need it for the next task." Mom said.
After classes me, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Pansy went to the common room and Harry is looking through his potions book.
"It is not funny." Draco said.
"It's in few books." Mad eye said.
"No. He is our friend." Ron said.
I smiled so happy that I finially had sex with my Harry.
"Draco get off your crushing me!" I yelled.
"I'll don't want potion." I said, glaring at the book.
"Well you missed breakfast." Hermione said.
"Yeah, I have no clue how they found us." I said, realizing that we need to also change clothes.
"But Draco it's done and over with." Blaise said.
After the wedding Draco was not able to convince anyone to let me stay longer with him. And I have been lonely.
I pulled Harry close and kissed his cheek. "What happened love?" I asked him.
"My poor Scabbers," Ron said petting the rat and keeping it close.
She glared at us. "I just want what is mine. Harry please don't let them do this to me. I love you. More than that mutt ever can." She said.
So me and Harry just cuddled for the rest of the day. Not finishing our sexy time.
"Hermione! I would never leave Harry! He is like a brother to me! It's just. This was unexpected I mean. I will never leave Harry no matter what. He is my brother and if he ends up with Draco. I will be by his side" Ron answerd.
"He tastes good." I answerd.
"Please Harry." Draco said.
Draco p.o.v
The adults, then made us board the train and we found a compartment, with our friends following us in. We sat on one bench, Draco sitting me on his lap. Hermione sat next to us, Blaise and Ron sit next to each other, on the other side, and Pansy sits next to them.
"Whatever. I still don't like him." Ron said.
"Actually my mother will be getting us. By the way, you know the Weasleys have custody over you." I said.
"How did she find out?" He said and started crying.
After classes, we went to the library and began studying. Then when it was time for dinner we went to the Great Hall. Dumbledore went up to the podium and said, "tomorrow is the last task. I am sure you all have had a nice break since the second task. Now you may tuck in." And the food appeared.
"Let's open presents." Narcissa said happily.
I have also promised Harry that if he does not cut all summer, then I will get him a present. I have been checking his whole body for cuts.
I went back to the position that we were in. I looked at his arm that I am holding and saw some cut marks. I decided to talk to him about it tomorrow, because I don't want to ruin his night, and just danced. "How are ya Harry?" I asked.
After words me and Harry went home and got ready for going to the train tomorrow.
She is having some trouble swimming, so I helped her get to the deck.
Ms. Weasly filled our plates and Sirius said, "well today we are going to digon ally. So we can get the things we need for Hogwarts."
But luckily today is Saturday, so we have no lessons and Harry does not have his Occlumency. Plus we can go to hogsmeade
"But Draco." I whinned.
I shook Ron and said, "get up it's important."
"Is it dragons?" I asked backing away.
Draco pulled me close cuddling me. Ron then said to Draco, "I can not believe you had sex with my friend."
I just walked out. If I need something done right I must do so myself.
"Why not? Harry love you have to." I said.
"Mason. I want to Marry you. I love you. But what am I going to do about Malfoy?" I said.
So after class when he wants to talk to Harry I need to let him no matter what. When Harry finally came out I hugged her to me and said, "Are you okay Harry?"
Scorpio p.o.v
"Dean and Seamus are our friends and Ron is your brother and Harry is practically our brother to. What would your mother say about this?" Hermione scolded.
"Not sure. After school I know that much." I said looking over at my wonderful Harry who is eating silantly.
I blushed and Draco pulled me onto his lap and started feeding me. I giggled and booped his nose. Then he kissed my nose.
Her smile falters for a moment and said, "don't lie. Voldimort is not back. And he did not kill Cedric."
Harry p.o.v
When Harry came back he seemed mad. "Harry what's wrong?" I asked.
I laughed. "It's just a little pinch." I said.
I smiled. "Hungry." I said.
Draco p.o.v
"Love you to Harry." He replied.
We got ready and went down stairs.
She nodded so we walked down stairs to find my friends waiting. "Ha. Harry it's looks like you have boobs." Ron said and laughed.
"Where is Harry?" I asked.
"So let's go!" Ron yelled already walking down the hallway.
"Hello mom and dad. This is, as you know, Harry. My mate." I said.
Once finished, Draco told me that I can take the potion and empty it as he puts the ingredients away.
"You know, with our luck he may have your horrible eye sight." Draco said and laughed.
It eased the pain, but did not stop it. So I passed out.
He then pushed me to the bed and got on top of me taking off my shirt. He began kissing and nipping my chest and sucking my nipples.
"Would you two just get a room?" Blaise asked.
"Let's not worry about her. She can not do anything. I will always love my Dracy poo no matter what." I said.
Pansy and Hermione sat on either side of me and tried to comfort me. "I'm sure it's not your fault." Hermione said.
I clapped my hands together. "let's go get breakfast." I said, quickly changing the subject.
I just smiled and said, "you."
Harry is laying down with Draco sitting next to him.
We got up and dressed then went to Diagon Alley. Ron came over and said, "you seem fine. You didn't sleep in the same room as him, did you?"
"Okay. Well we will go now. By Myrtle." I said and walked away.
I hesitated, yes I trusted them, but still this was a lot of new information; the identity of my mate would likely drive them over the edge. "That does not concern you." I spoke unfaltering, trying not to be too rude about it. After a little more talking we went to get changed and Pansy kept up her guessing of who my mate was, slowly but surely rambling off every student in Hogwarts till the last three were left.
"Well why not?" Hermione asked.
"The title says 'the Boy That Is Gay and Genderfluid.' Worst title ever." Blaise said putting it aside. "It needs to be catchier."
Hagrid then led a bird horse up and said, "this is a hippogriff. They are proud creatures and if you insult them that would be the last thing you do. Now, who would like to come up and pet him?"
I smiled. "Did not really think of it." I said.
I cuddled to Draco just smelling him. He actually smells really good. I wander if he taste good. So. I licked him.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Can we please stop talking about it." I said hiding my face with Draco's chest.
"I'm not sure. I just want to be with you." Harry said and kissed me.
"You want me. To wank off?" I said.
"Wow. I thought he would give us detention or something." Ron said.
He kissed back and I slipped my tongue into his mouth. He moaned and I began moving my hands up and down his sides.
"Do you know the password?" He asked
The next day Harry woke up so me Hermione and pansy ran to the hospital wing. Blaise and Ron are both alseep in Ron's bed and Harry is awake looking around the room.
I sighed and rolled over seeing Draco looking down at me. "Can't sleep?" He asked.
"But I want to spend time with Dray." I whined and cuddled up to Draco, laying my head on his chest.
His face imeadtly turned from angery to sad and worried. "No no I do love you. What would ever make you think I don't."
Me and Draco cuddled in bed warm and comfortable. Then Draco pushed me onto my back and nuzzled my neck. "Can I have some blood?" Draco asked nibbling my neck.
"What did you talk to him about?" Ron asked.
I paced, thinking over and over that I want to find Harry. A door appeared on the wall and I walked in. Harry is passed out naked and tied to a bed with a gag in his mouth. I looked around and found another me in the corner of the room.
"My team will have Pansy as the keeper, Crabe and Goyle beaters, and Blais a chaser. What will yours be Harry?" I asked.
"Alright. It's dinner time so let's go. We'll talk more about this later." He said. We went to the Great Hall.
"So tell us about the new teacher Harry. Why we are getting one?" Ron said.
"Because he is submissive," I said.
I looked at his arm that has a bad cut in it. "And you were doing so good." I said and helped him up.
"I don't know." Draco said and had me cuddle him as we ate.
We all said no and sat down.
"Technically you kissed me. Now fetch. Please." He said.
He glared at me." That is not nice Dracy poo." He whined.
I smiled and bit him right where I said it would be. I could feel him slightly tending against me. I slowly pulled away, not wanting to leave his embrace nor wanting to hurt him. There was a bite mark where I bit him and I could see it immediately healing over.
"I was wondering if you would like to date me?" Ron asked, poking at his food.
and Draco continued were he left off.
"Eww." Both Ron and Harry said, but both for different reasons.
I have felt cutting on my legs last night. It's a full moon so I had to wait.
He cuddled into my side, smiling.
"What is so bad about cuddling. My Draco is so comfortable." Harry said.
I ran after Harry past some people that weren't inside.
Harry ran into Moaning Myrtles bathroom and locked the door.
I glared at Draco who laughed at me. Ron and Blaise also began laughing at me. "Well Blaise how can you laugh when I see some bites on your neck." I teased.
"Dray is allowing me to move into his room." I said, just as I got done packing.
When we got back home everything was dark, the lights came on, and people jumped out yelling suprised!
"Yes. They want to meet you. How about instead of going to those muggles you come live with us." Draco said. "But they won't like that." I said. "Please Harry. With what you told me you should." Draco said. "Fine. I'll live with you if your parents say it's okay." I said. "Alright. let's go to my room." Draco said. We went to his room. He wrote to his parents and we stayed inside for the rest of the day.
I looked at Mason and he said. "You can go Harry."
"We are going to put our name in that Goblet-"
Ron and Blaise got into Ron's bed closing their curtains as I laid Harry down and took off his glasses and shoes. And placed his wand on the dresser.
"I was wondering if I can take Harry out on a date this Saturday," I said.
"Oh hell ya." Harry said laughing.
After breakfast we went to potions again and we went through the same routine. Harry zoning off and scratching his arm.
When we walked in everyone is already in bed so we quickly got ready and went to Harry's bed.
"I don't know," Harry answered.
"There are some left Ron. You just need to find them." Harry said for the fifth time.
"It's just. I think it was a little to far. I mean. he did not hurt us." I said.
"I am so sorry that I ruined your wedding and broke up with you." I said and hugged Harry.
"Painful. I don't know if it is worth it or not," Harry said as we walked into the common room.
"I don't care. He annoyed me." Draco said and began eating.
So I sat down and began writing.
"That's boring." I said and cuddled into Draco.
He looked at me and said, "I see. So, what does that mean by 'I am your mate'?"
"Sorry Remus." I said and got off Harry.
And we apeareated go Grimuald place.
It started to move and tried biting Harry. Harry screamed and backed away I closed it then retied it.
I handed him over to the doctors and let them do what they have to.
"I don't know." She said.
Remus came over and asked me how I am and I told him good. He then went to the teacher table.
I got the bath ready and made sure the water is a perfect tempeture. Then I went back and picked Harry up who just cuddled to me wrapping his arms around me.
Me and Harry went into ours and it has both our house colors and the same size as a normal dorm with two beds and a door leading to the bathroom. Me and Harry put the beds together and got ready for bed. Then we fell asleep in each others embrace.
After eating we went down to the lake and relaxed. "So you ready for the next task coming up Harry?" Ron asked.
"It's is fine. We have only been together for two days. We have all summer and next year. We have time." Pansy said smiling.
I moved to lay on top of Draco and said, "when ever your ready. I'm sorry we were not able to. With the war and all."
When I found the Weasleys, I said bye to Hagrid and went over to them.
Everyone was whispering about it, some glaring. Lot of girls were squeeling and giggling, which I found weird, and other girls seemed jealous.
I just can't wait till this school year is over. Bet the next one will be better.
"Anything that can kill Harry is dead and the arouras are getting all roaug death eaters." I said positive this year will be better than the others.
It's breakfast and I am in my uniform.
I layed on my bed and held the stuffed dragon. "Draco?" Pansy said sitting next to me.
She glared at me the best she could as some more Auror's came and took Ginny. I took out her wand, snapped it, and threw it in the fire place.
That's nothing new from that bathroom but it does not sound like Mertls crying. So I walked in to find Harry curled up by the sinks crying. A little bit of blood trickling from his arm.
I'll be going with Draco for half the year then Sirius and Remus the rest. Draco will probably join for the rest.
"Whats in the letter?" Blaise asked.
"I'm fine Draco. He just wanted to know if I am prepared for the next task. Which I thought was strange because we can't be. But he then meant mentally which I am not sure about." Harry explained to me.
"But- But I love her." Ron said with a sad look on his face, leaning back against the tree.
"Children, lunch is done!" Narcissa said.
"No. You broke my heart and in getting married. I used to love you Malfoy. I trusted you. Then you broke me. Now I am with someone who will love me forever. Unlike you." I said and walked out. I looked back for a moment and saw Draco at his desk his head in his hands crying.
"I know. What kind of snake are you." I asked in parseltongue as I pet his head.
"I'm Fred that's George. So my gender confused friend I heard you attacked another." The same twin said.
"Well we will see you all next school year." Pansy said, smiling.
"Same." Blaise said.
"I asked Nevill out. And now we are dating." Ginny said smiling.
"Okay. It was an accident with the Floo." I explained and he nodded in understanding.
"What is wrong with us men?" I asked.
He handed me some clothes. "I think this is enough." I said and paid the lady.
I got up and helped Harry up. "Well come on we could go and look around," I said.
When we got to his hut Hagrid led us little ways into the forbidden forest and he told us to turn to a page. "And how do you expect us to do that?" I asked.
I could tell that he is my mate just by the smell.
I felt tears run down my face and started to cut myself. Then I wrapped them up and went to bed. I hope Draco does not find out or see my cuts.
"You okay Harry?" I asked, touching his shoulder.
"Do to." Ron replied.
"We will need to get new dress robes though." Ron said, frowning a bit.
Ron's p.o.v
"No it's not done. Now stuff this into the bra." Ginny said taking out some round things.
I rolled my eyes and walked over to pick it up and gave it back to Harry. " I don't understand this game." I said.
I am drinking Draco's blood and it actually tastes better than I thought. I looked at him and he seems to like it.
"Thanks." I said and took a bread roll. I started nibbling on it and Draco looked at me strange.
"Fred, George leave," Ron said coming over with Hermione.
"Okay harry." Hermione said.
Then snap stopped. "Come on Potter try harder." Snap said.
"And why not?" He asked.
Some weird little things are starting to bite me and drag me down. I pushed Draco and the girl up so they could reach the surface, while I find out what to do.
"He is doing good. Hedwig is getting jealous though." He answered, petting his owl through the cage.
Ron and I got ready. Ron in his terrible dress robes, and me in mine. When I walked out of the bathroom Ron looked at me and said, "what are those?"
When we got there, Dumbledore had just begun a speech. "Tomorrow, all the champions shall get their wands checked and get an interview with Rita Skeeter. It shall be after lunch. That will be all." He said.
"Can you pleas teach Harry occlomencey again. He needs it. I know what he done was wrong but. He needs it." I pleaded to my godfather.
"No." I replied.
That night Pansy, Blaise, and me went with Harry and his friends to the Gryffindor common room since the Slytherins still hate me for being on the light and their parents on the dark.
I blushed and said, "well. Um. You left me to go to sleep horny. It's your foult."
He then hugged me and pecked my lips. "It's okay. Your alive and that is all that matters. How are you feeling?" Draco said in a much softer tone.
I looked at the marauders map and saw the tunnel and that there is no deatheaters. I nodded and we went. Draco first and Blaise last.
"It's okay my Draco." Harry said cuddling me.
Hermione p.o.v
So now we are leading our son to the Express. A barn owl in his cage with all that he needs.
"Yes nice to officially meet you," Hermione said but Ron just nodded.
We shook our heads then Pansy said, "maybe kreacher will have something?"
We walked out and went to the headmistress office and sat down as McGonagall came in and sat across from us. "Hello Harry. I am really glad you are back." She said, smiling.
Blais is flirting with Ron who is oblivious. Draco and I are talking with Hermione.
"Come on get up well be late and we need to meet the Malfoys," Hermione said. She then closed the door and Ron and I got up. I got some jeans and a red girl shirt I went to the bathroom and got changed.
"....Okay. So what should we do?" I said trying to understand.
"Alright. I guess I will go with you." I said.
"I'm fine my head just hurts. What was that thing in the sky anyway?" Harry said.
I immediately felt the effects as Draco grabbed me from behind and Lupin stepped in front of me and the dementor turned into a floating white orb. Which he turned into a balloon and put it in the wardrobe.
In the morning we both woke up and got dressed. Harry though is looking at his trunk blankly. "you okay Harry?" I asked.
We then got ready for bed and went to sleep.
"Im fine, just got shocked. I mean how can you get pregnant and have kids? Especially if you have male parts still." I asked.
Harry p.o.v
I turned into my wolf and ran to my dorm. I got changed then went to the Great Hall.
Once we finished eating we said goodbye to Remus and Sirius, me promising that I will protect Harry. Them we went back to the forest. With our first real horcrox.
"Now that you all are done playing around we need to get to our next class," Hermione said and got up.
Me and Draco then left the hospital wing and went to our room.
The commentator called him into the arena, so I kissed him on the lips. "I love you mate." I quickly kissed him again and let him go.
"Good." He said.
Durning the break Harry did not speak to anyone. He is just sitting quietly. He barely even talked about his gifts.
"Because that may mean that you are...um...In heat." Hermione said not looking directly at us.
We all sat, and ate, talking about what happened. Though Ron seems hesitant, and I can tell he's leaving things out. Harry just seemed thoughtfully on the patronus.
"Well, it's completely normal. Me being a vampire," I snapped, annoyed at Ron. Wishing I can drain him.
I looked at him quickly, thinking that Harry is right. There is something different.
We sat and thought for a moment. What can Voldemort use as a horcrux? "Maybe Nagani?" I asked.
"I'll be a keeper Harry." Ginny said.
"In the ROR having fun." Draco answerd.
I wrapped an arm around his waist. "Yes because then I could have more fun like last night." I said.
"But I can't. I was supposed to be the one he loved. The one he married." I said.
"You have? Well, I find it good for when the mind is...Stretched. I always come here, trying to find out where I went wrong. What has your faimly used it for?" Dumbledore asked.
I lightly kissed him and said, "don't worry Harry. I'm sure it will be fine. I mean. Snape I am sure is prepared for the worse."
I turned into my wolf, which helped. I jumped over and in front of Harry, who ran into my side, and we fell.
"Men." Pansy and Hermione said together, shaking their heads.
"Why are you trying to get back with me Malfoy?" I asked.
Harry p.o.v
They nodded. "I written to my mom. She has not replied yet." Ron said.
I grabbed a handful of powder and stepped into the fireplace. "Diagonally," I said and threw down the powder.
She tossed it to me so I just took off my shirt and put it on."okay now what?" I asked picking up my shirt.
I heard the doors open and close, so I turned around. "Sirius. Remus." Dumbledore said.
"Harry are you feeling hot?" Hermione asked Harry as I was trying to make my arousal go away.
When we got to his hut Draco seemed more nervous than before. I knocked on the door and Fang started to bark. "I'm comin'." He opened the door. "Hello Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I see yeh brought Draco along. Why's he here?" Hagrid asked.
Harry's P.O.V
"Harry it's fine. Would you like to skip class today?" I asked.
"I mostly just hung out with faimly." Hermione replied rolling her eyes. After conversating about our summer, we sat in comfortable silence.
So we got up and went back to our rooms to relax. Good thing it's Sunday so no school.
Me and Draco spent the rest of our day in my room and accidentally fell asleep. It was not bad. At least I'm with Draco.
"Wow. You do sound like a girl." Blaise said.
Hermione looked at me, then started talking to Ron and motioning to us.
I looked around and touched some kind of skeleton hand. It grabbed my wrist and I frantically pried it off.
"Draco you do love me, right?" I asked.
"I'd rather have the detentions then study." Ron said.
"Harry!" I heard some one yell.
"I have a feeling that I will never have a normal year. And that we are going to end up in the library no matter what." I said as Hermione set down three, thick books.
"Cool." I said standing next to harry.
Harry looked in the direction of Rons bed and said, "Ron is in the room. Plus. What if every one notices somthing difrent?"
Pansy took off the spell and said, "Don't worry, Harry, he means well. He's just looking out for you."
And Harry and I spent the rest of our lives happy and loved.
It was the next day and Ron still hadn't asked a girl. He said he couldn't.
I don't even know what class I'm in our what's going on. So I went back to day dreaming about Harry.
"It's okay. I overreacted." I said and hugged onto him tight.
"But Draco you cant just leave if you have no idea were he is." Pansy said.
"You ready to get up or do you want to wait a minute?" Draco asked, rubbing his fingers through my hair.
I leaned against him and said, "okay Draco I love you."
Draco grinned and said, "you and Ron can. Me and Harry are going to have alone time." And he wiggled his eyebrows suductuvely.
"Have Narcissa take care of her." He suggested. "Maybe?"
"I told Ron I won't around him," I said.
"Hey look, there's Hermione." I said.
After classes we went back to our dorm and started doing our home work.
"Draco did you know Sirius was my Godfather?" I asked standing in front of him. He looked shocked and shook his head. I could tell he was lying and stormed up to our dorm.
"Always." Draco said.
"Boys." We turned around and Ms. McGonagall is here. "May you please come with me." She asked.
"What?" I asked annoyed.
I finished and put them all in just as Draco came in. "You ready to go harry?" Draco asked.
"Alright alright have him." Ron said, putting his hands up and sitting down.
I frowned and got into bed hoping it will all be better in the morning.
"We did not have sex I promis." They said.
I gave him a 'really' look and tugged at his sleevs. He moved his arm away and I saw bandages. I nudged his arm and took off the bandage on that one and licked it. "I'm sorry. I'm a bad mate."He said, his eyes tearing up a little. I whined and licked his face. I jumped onto the bed and gave a small bark, wanting Harry to come over. He cuddled up to me and fell asleep after saying sorry again.
"Well I was going to, but Hermione made me leave because they were looking stuff up in the library," I said sitting up looking at her.
"Draco, why are you wet?" Pansy asked.
He gave a soft moan as I drank down some blood.
"Okay. We have a few minutes. Is there any thing you want to do?" He asked.
As the day went on I tried getting his attention but nothing really worked. Does he not really like me? Was he just showing no hard feelings? I guess he does not want me. I mean. Who would? I'm just a freaky burden.
He took out his wand and touched the surface. Then we both fell in.
"You okay?" Draco asked.
"No bitch." I said, then used the binding spell on her. She fell to the ground and I told Harry to go get professer McGonagall. I looked down at Ginny. "I hope you die bitch." I spat at her.
"Me. Now put one arm on my wast and hold the other hand like this. Follow my lead." She demonstrated the dancing and the Weasley twins started catcalling and whistling.
I kissed his lips and pulled his shirt over his head, getting mine off to. I began grinding my hips into Harry's, making us both very aroused.
"You locked your Cousin in a cage?" Lucius said.
I signalled for them to be quite and said, "yes we are here and we need help. Just tell us what's going on,"
"Yes master potter?" He practically spat.
"Yes, there was. Besides the fact that he was flirting with you." Ron said and Hermione nodded.
"Why do you have to make having a werewolf boyfriend boring?" I asked, laughing lightly.
"What?" I said confused.
The next day we went to breakfast and that day was mailday. I got both my annual Daily Prophet and a note from Sirius. "Harry look at Rita Skeeter's page." Hermione said.
Harry got off the bed and Hermione held out his stuffed lion. Harry ran over and hot it hugging it to him. I looked over at Draco and saw that he is looking at his lap grinning and blushing.
I turned and said, "Oh no I killed Harry Potter. Draco is going to kill me!"
Draco p.o.v
"Then who is?" She asked, her gaze softening after my explanation, less upset than before. Unlike what most people think, she could really be a very kind and understanding person, when need be.
"Don't be ridiculous. Draco will be so focused on my hot body that he will not even notice you." I said smiling.
"I want to accept." I stated confidently. It was silent for a few moments before Hermione squeaked, clapping her hands excitedly, and soon everyone but Ginny had snapped out of their shock and joined in and a few loud whistles could be heard.
I don't know which one is worse.
I pulled away then sat next to him. "Draco stop doing that." He whined, rubbing his neck.
Me and Harry got ready and went to sleep.
"I locked him away." He answered.
I put the coin in my pocket and cuddled up to Draco. "You okay harry?" He asked, wrapping his arms around me.
"Not long. About a year. Just had to keep reminding myself it's not a dream." I said and laughed.
When I pulled away I am smiling like and idior and Harry still seems confused. "What wrong Harry"?
After we bought what we needed, we got back to the Manor and it is dinner time. We started eating and Lucius poke up. "Harry, Draco told me you could speak to snakes. Is that true?" He asked.
He kissed my cheek. "I swear you two kiss like every two minutes." Ron said.
"Mr. Malfoy!" I yelled as I caught up.
"Are you okay what happened?" She said.
He smiled and blushed even more. He took my hand. "Yes, yes you may." He said.
He must think I am weak. Why else would he ask about skipping?
We then put on Harry's cloak and walked out.
After I have gotten pretty hard he stopped, then placed himself inside of me.
Harry p.o.v
In a few minutes it will be Harry's turn and Draco isn't in the stands. I went over to Rita. "Hey. Do you want to know who Harry is secretly dating?" I asked. She nodded. "Follow me." I said and led her to the tent.
"Sorry Harry did not want Simba to be alone."
"Have your boyfriend fighting for you now?" I teased.
"The people I live with are cruel and they don't let me be with them during celebrations." I said, looking at the floor.
"So what should we get Ron?" Draco asked.
"No but we know a better place to look." Hermione said.
Draco p.o.v
"I don't think anyone minds us being together." Draco said.
"Nothing much. Just the usual." Harry said smiling.
Then when I walked up I thought of Voldemort but he was never that scary. Plus I defeated him three times now. Once as a baby. But then I thought of how I felt with the dementor. So then there it was in all its glory. A dementor.
I went to the front of the school and strangely felt anger coming from Harry. Three minutes later I felt sadness. I went into the castle and started looking for Harry.
I nodded and said, "why don't they. Go to Dumbledore."
They went out and I said, "So Harry, do you really want to be my mate?"
Draco nodded and said, " yah me and Harry just slept. We are not at that stage yet."
We went to the hospital wing, upon Draco's demand. Dumbledore showed up with Snape.
I nodded and continued. Once we finished me and Harry went up to the room of requirement, leaving our friends to do what they want. The room made itself looked like a common room with both house colors. Harry and I sat on the couch and relaxed. "So are you enjoying classes Harry?" I asked.
Harry p.o.v
The rest of the Weasley's came with the same greeting as Ginny.
"Checking on you two." Draco said.
So I said, "Good point."
"It's alright Harry. You will be fine." I said, hugging him tighter.
"Yeah they are fun. Is something wrong Draco? I am noticing that you are looking at me a lot. Not that it is a bad thing." Harry said.
"Okay, well, let's go." She said as we got with an adult so we could apparate.
"The Weasley twins." I said. "Mischief managed." I said, putting the tip of my wand on the map and it all disappeard. "And this is my Invisibility Cloak." I said, standing up, and putting the cloak around myself.
"Well I'm sorry for being such a bad player." Harry said.
Harry and I went to Dumbledore's office to talk but there is a meeting inside. We were about to knock but Mad-Eye opened the door for us.
I woken up to Draco straddling me glaring down at me. "You were very mean to me Harry." Draco said.
Mom and father came in and father said, "why did Harry scream?"
"Nope," Hermione said and walked out.
Blaise smiled a little and said, "I am sure they will be fine."
"Umbitch." Draco growled out.
"Oh come on Harry. I bet it'll be cool. I mean it must be different wearing girl clothes then boy's." Blaise said.
"There is nothing there. It's pulling itself like always." Hermione said.
"What are you two so happy about?" Hermione asked.
"Well there is a slight chance, but I'm sure it will be fine." Pansy said.
Me and Harry went to our house with Hermione, Pansy,Blaise, and Ron. I took out some fire whisky and poured us some glasses. "So we finally have time away from the kids." I said.
So we went to the great hall, but I felt fear come from Harry and the ring burned as if he was in danger.
"Night my Draco." I said cuddling to him.
Today we got on the express to go back. Blaise and Ron got there own apartment and Blaise is going to live with Ron. So it's just me, Draco, Hermione, and Pansy.
We ate and Mr. Weasley asked me about muggle objects.
"Sorry. He just...smells different. But...Really good." I said.
"Aww come on Hermione look at him. Just let him have one." Ron said smiling at me.
"Yes. I told you Draco was going to make me."
"Let's go, Harry," I said and led him into the village with him under the cloak.
"May we meet him sir?" Harry asked.
"That means nothing. Yes I ask if your alright, but that's because I need to know. I worry about you because it's instinct. I don't think your weak. Now you know for sure I love you,  so your not going to beat yourself up about this right?" I said, making him look me in the eye.
I smelled death on Ginny. "She killed the Arours." I said. Harry then sent a patronus saying that Ginny is back. "I am really getting tired of you bitch." I said.
"Well Dumbledore has cancelled classes for today so we can celebrate in our own way. He asked for us to go to his office after we eat." Ron said and stuffed his face.
I looked at him about to answer but Snape lightly tapped me with a book and forces Ron to look at his paper.
Draco and I spent the rest of the day cuddling and making out.
"Well I couldn't help myself. Plus, Harry allowed me to." I retorted feeling slightly offset and defensive.
"I'm glad to hear that have a nice day." She said and flew away.
"Maybe he was the only one to ask?" Draco asked.
"I don't know what her problem is. We were brought up to believe that you can love who you want and not care the gender or anything." Ron said.
They entered and Lucius said, "Don't touch anything Draco." He nodded as his father went to the counter.
*Neville's P.O.V.*
It tastes horrible and the change hurts. When it is over I have webbed feet and hands along with gills. I started swimming and started to worry about Draco. What if he thinks I am going to fail and does not want to be seen around me? Was I to clingy and he found his chance to leave me? I heard something pass me in the weeds and looked around.
"Me too but I guess that she has had stranger reservation names," I said smiling at him.
Harry p.o.v
When we walked in Ron said, "how dare you not tell us you're a Parcelmouth?"
"May I mark you?"
I went back to kissing his lips and then stopped. I laid next to him. "Why did you stop?" He asked.
I nodded and we began eating. The stare of Malfoy on me as usual.
"That will be good. Have a nice day ma'am." Mason said.
We went to lunch. "Harry. Would you like to talk about what happened this morning?"
"It's okay Draco you will be fine," Hermione said.
"I'll see you buddy." I said hugging Scorpio tight.
I got dressed and we went down to the great hall.
"Yes we should have. But it's like he was never here. Gone without a trace." Draco said.
"No. There was nothing." Harry said, leaning against my side.
"I had a crush on you since I first met you." Draco said.
"Yes I have. Draco has been making sure. He has even forced me to eat a few times when I say I am not hungry." Harry answerd her as we sat down.
He moaned loudly so I quickly cast a silencing charm. I then stripped us of our close and healed the wound. He looked up at me lust in his eyes. I captured his lips on a kiss again and continued to rub myself against him.
"Well, one book is better than none." Harry said, opening it.
"I'm sorry Hagrid," I said upset that this is happening.
But he just nodded and said, "Okay. Don't worry Voldy was threatening you." Harry said.
"We do, don't we?" Harry said, slightly embarrassed.
Harry moaned and rubs back against me.
Draco had looked at me and I saw him mouth saying something, but I was unsure of what he said. "Those look like werewolf eyes, but that can't be! Malfoys aren't known to have any werewolf blood. hmm...I wonder if he got bit." Hermione pondered as Malfoy strode away.
"That you called her a ugly pink toad and belongs in the bottom of the lake?"
Maybe the mudblood can get me information. "Okay. I'll do that." I said.
Harry p.o.v
Draco came back over. "She was sent to Azkaban." I nodded and Snape came in.
Ron laughed and said, "so you guys kissed twice and did not even start dating."
The next day I woke up and nudged Draco. He woke up and got on top of me. I noticed his eyes have gotten bits of red and I said, "do you need blood Draco?"
"He was a big supporter of the Dark Lord. He killed a big group of muggles and his friend. There was nothing left of his friend but a finger." I said.
We agreed and we went to our rooms.
I looked at the closed blinds and locked door, nodding.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Hermione asked.
"They're gorgeous don't you think so Harry?" Ron said dreamily.
So the conversation ended. Draco and I just cuddled as Lucif wrapped himslef around my shoulders in a hug.
"For real mate. And I want an honest answer. Are you gay?" He asked.
I frowned and Hermione said, "don't worry Draco. Harry will be fine. He is just upset."
"Honestly I shouldn't be surprised.Ill give you a pass and also you all should hurry to your first class." Snape drawled raising an eyebrow.
"What would you like to ask me?" Blaise asked him.
He started looking me up and down, blushing slightly. I then remembered I was just wearing night pants.
"Cousin?" I asked, confused.
"I'm not sure. Seems pretty cool though. I just want the next task to come and get over with." Draco replied.
He smiled sheepishly still blushing. "S-sure." He stuttered.
I looked at Harry, who walked stiffly to the room where the other champions went. "I'm sorry Draco." Pansy said, rubbing my shoulder.
Blaise gave Draco the amazing idea that for now on I can not go into bathrooms alone.
He cut me off and said, "you know what I mean."
"Let's go to our next class love." Draco said.
Harry p.o.v
"That is correct. Now, who would like to name one? Mr. Malfoy?" He said.
The next day nothing happened tell the end of the day. We got ready then tooken the port key to the same place that I taken Harry.
"I'll get it." He said and got it.
When Harry finished he cuddled to my side and relaxed.
My familiar came over and wrapped itself around my neck. "Your mate is strange." Lucif said.
"Well I think i could do what I want Harry. So what should I do?" Ron asked, sitting down next to Hermione.
"Okay." I said simply and went back to staring at the food on my plate.
I sat up and Draco grabbed me and put me on his lap. "Merlin are you alright Harry I was so worried you passed out and that dementor attacked you. Are you okay do you want Father to sue the train. What do you want me to do Harry." He was about to say more but I put my hand over his mouth.
So he kissed me and pulled away. "Is that better my Harry?" He asked.
After work and I went home I saw a letter with Malfoys  owl.
"In there room probably snogging." Pansy said.
We nodded and looked back at the couple asleep in the ground. Then Ginny took a quill out of her pocket got some ink on it and walked over to the couple. She kneeled down and drew mustaches on their faces. She took another picture and said, "well my job is done here. I'll see you all later. Tell me there reaction for when they wake up." She said and walked away.
"One second Harry. Ill be right back." I said and allowed him to go in as I went to find a potion so Harry can not get pregnant. Though him with my children is a nice thought.
"Oh come one pansy we shipped it before it was even a thing." Hermioen said and laughed.
Poor Ron. Wonder if that's how Simba ever feels. Ginny and I just laughed as we ran into the kitchen and began searching for cookies.
Draco stayed near me the whole time touching me in some way. His hand on my back, holding my hand, his arm around me.
We sat for a moment thinking about what to do.
"Alright let's go." I said and we left for the pet shop.
I held onto the bird tight as he started to fly. After a few moments, I sat up and looked around. I smiled liking this. It's almost as good as the broom.
"Now the last announcement before you all are dismissed is that only seventh years are allowed to play." Every one complained though the twins are the loudest to me, them shouting "that's rubbish!"
*Harry's P.O.V*
I woke up and my first thought is that I'm not in my room. Then I remember that I slept with Draco. I turned over and looked at my sleeping little Draco.
"I should have gone with her. It should have been me." Ron said.
"We can go to our next class. I'm sure that i will be good by the time we get there." I said, barely sobbing any more.
I pet Hedwig who cooed disapprovingly.
"Now the last one.." He said as Neville went to sit back down. "Avada kadarva." He said killing the spider. "No one has survived this curse except one." He said looking right at Harry.
Harry laughed. "Almost every time I play I get attacked in some way. Even if you try to let me win it should be impossible." Harry said.
"Well Harry sure as Hell is not going next," I said.
We then went to the common room and began our homework.
"It's fine. I've been wondering.How did the other Gryffindorks find out you are gay?" I asked.
"So he just died on his own accord? Your the lier here not me!" I said glaring at her.
I snuggled into him as our friends rolled there eyes. They probly now know that I was doing this just to get thing out of it. But I don't care.
"You're helping him?" Ron asked.
"It was great Hermione. Best date I have ever been on." I said smiling brightly.
"I'm too depressed to eat." I said.
Harry p.o.v
"Well I think that I still want to be a Auror." I said. Draco, Ron, and Blaise said that they want to do the same thing.
"I'm sorry. We can come back later." Harry said.
"Draco, it's fine," Hermione said.
We nodded, and get up. "Good news. They won't be born tell after school." Draco said, smiling a bit, as we walk out of the hospital wing.
"Oh. Why did I disappear?" Tom asked.
"But... I don't want him to see it... Draco." Harry said nuzzling my neck.
Dumbldore told us to be quite and aslo said that classes are cancelled for a week tell he finds a new teacher. Making us cheer all the more.
"What's wrong with Harry?" Ron said accusingly to me.
We denied and I noticed that Cho Chang and Fleur's sister is here. "So today you all are going to be saved by the champions. May you follow me to the lake?" Dumbledore said.
"Well it's time for dinner." Ron said.
Draco came up to me and asked, "Harry, what do you mean?"
Me, Ron and Hermione laughed. "No promises." I said.
He looked at the time. "Well it's time to get up anyways. Plus, it's okay if you wake me." Draco said.
"No he is coming with us." Ron said as we walked into the hall.
It's creepy right? He sat back down. "So do you remember nothing?" I asked.
I want him as far away as possible from Mad-Eye.
Mom is trying to calm me down, but it still hurts.
"You better." Draco said as we got into the room and sat down.
"Now Harry, I'm going to need to ask some questions. I know it may be hard to answer, but please try your best. I just want to know what you remeber." McGonagall said, frowning.
He pouted but said no more as I leaned down and began kissing him again. He kissed back as I took off our close and grinding against him.
Then Luna came over. "Hello every one. I heard that there are nargles around. You better be careful." She said walked away.
"I was warm, said I wanted to stay with Draco." I replied.
Draco p.o.v
After eating Hermione decided to drag us to the library. "But hermione! I don't want to." Ron whined slamming his head on to the table as we read.
"Oh, Ron, I'll show you bad hair." Then I took my wand and turned his hair pink.
Hermione looked at me like she daring me to say somthing bad. "Um. Hey Draco look the rats are playing jump rope with there tails." I said.
"Yes. I showed Harry one before." I said.
"They have to let me do it. There's no way out. Oh Draco, I'm so scared." He said.
I just looked back down at my Harry and kissed the top of his head.
We then found a room with a bunch of names on the walls. Some burnt out. "I see you found my fainly tree." Sirius said walking in.
I signed walking by the abandoned bathroom to hear sniffling and crying.
I turned over, pinning him under me. I started kissing him, rubbing my body against him. He moaned into my mouth and began rubbing his hips against mine. I heard footsteps outside the door. Someone started banging on the door. "I said don't do anything. Now come on we are meeting the Weasley's and Hermione at Diagon ally." Remus said.
Time skip to fith book.
"He may go to a close friend, his mind will force him to, and it will satisfy him. Then, two weeks after the child is born, he will start drinking from you, again." Madam Pomfrey said.
"Should not be to long. There is nothing to worry about my Harry." I said and patted his head.
"You know Voldemort and the graveyard," Mad-Eye replied.
"She is just upset that Harry doesn't love her back." Blaise said.
When we were done we got ready for bed and I hid the knife in my trunk and fell asleep. At least Draco did. I just laid there staring at him, not sure if he really loves me or just is leading me on so he won't die.
We decided to go back to our common room and me and Draco cuddled on the couch.
I got closer to him and whispered in his ear, "Good, because you're mine now, beautiful."
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Wow Ron that sounded really gay," Harry said.
Once we got back to the boys dormatory I dragged Harry to the bed and pushed him onto it. I closed the curtains and placed a silencing charm. I began kissing Harry and taking off his cloths. He then helped take mine of and I began rubbing against him. He moaned and rubbed back. I then took a bottle of lube and prepared myself and put some on my fingers. I looked down at Harry and placed one in him. Then two more and moved them around. Once I thought it is good enough I pulled them out and pushed myself inside of him. He groaned and pushed against me. I then began to slowly move in and out of him, I leaned down and kissed him, on his lips and jawline down to his neck. I bit into him gaining a gasp and moan as I sucked on the wound getting blood. And drinking blood while having sex makes the blood taste much sweeter. I pulled away and licked the wound closed. I then began to push in and out faster. I grabbed his dick and and moved it in time with my thrust. "D-draco. I. I have to. Draco!" He said and came into my hand. I came inside of him.
"I'll try. But you know me. I always get into an unsafe situation." Harry replied.
"Yes, I do." I said remembering the pink toad lady that baby sat me once.
We went to the dinning hall and began to eat Breakfast. The rest of our friends came down, though for some reason something felt off. I looked around at all the students. They seemed normal. Then what is it?
"Is he asleep?" Hermione asked.
I looked at Umbrige who is stuffing her fat toad like face. I hate that bitch.
That morning when I got up I felt like a boy so I dressed up in a t-shirt and jeans since it's the weekend.
"How can you take all these? Most of them are at the same time." Harry said handing it back.
Me and Draco walked our son, Scorpio James Malfoy-Potter, to the Hogwarts Express. We then saw Blaise and Ron with there adopted son, Hugo Dame Zabini-Weasley.
We then went down to the great hall. "Draco why did you punch ron?" Blaise asked angerly Hermione giving Draco a disapproving look.
We then went to Breakfast, Harry skipping next to me and Ron making comments about how that is girly.
So Draco moved away. "Sorry sir!" Draco yelled.
"No." He said, walking into our room and grabbing clothes.
"Don't worry I'm sure we will find him and it will all be explaind in time." Draco said, smiling.
We accepted the apology and went home.
Blaise glared at Ron. "You said that its not noticeable!" Blaise yelled.
Ron got up. "Let's all just calm down. Ginny how about you go because I'm sure Draco is about to kill you." Ron said.
We then ran all the way to Hagrids hut and Harry knocked on the door.
"I said out," she said, pointing at the door.
As soon as we sat down, Harry just stared at the plate as I filled it with food. He slowly ate and did not complain as normal.
As we border the Hogwarts Express we talked about our plans. Draco is going to be a healer as I am going to be an Auror with Ron. Hermione is going to work at Hogwarts, as Pansy and Blaise are going to be working some where in the ministry.
"He's alright." I said shrugging.
"Of course." Ron said.
Draco p.o.v
I read the note from Sirius. "Harry, I'm glad you are with some one you love. I don't mind you being with Draco. I am sure your parents wouldn't either. Be careful in the tournament, many have died. Have fun my cub.
The next morning I woke up in Draco's room. I don't feel like getting up. Though Hermione said that Professor McGonagall and Snape is holding a special class for us.
"Okay okay." I said and kissed him.
"Got it. And you can call me Hermione." I said and walked out.
"No. I sleep much better with you." I said and hugged him and kissed him.
"Harry please. If something is bothering you then you need help." I said, pulling him closer to me.
