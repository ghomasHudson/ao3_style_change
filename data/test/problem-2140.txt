But then I wake up.
"People with inheritances scent differently. Plus you can tell whether a creature is dom or sub by their scent. Well you guys can't. Other creatures can."
"Apparently she was a bitten wolf, like Re, and the bite changes your DNA or something, so bitten wolves can have inherited wolf kids. It's confusing gene stuff."
"Sure thing, Potter." He holds his hand out, and I shake it.
"Draco, I'm bringing Potter up to the dorm to see you."
"Millie!" Someone yells from across the room, and Romilda swivels in her chair and waves.
The voice sounds like it's simultaneously far away and very close. I whirl around, looking for its source.
"Let's start tomorrow. You should have some time to get used to the idea of being a sub. We'll start with posture and stances, okay?"
"I love you too."
"What are your names?" she asks.
Stick to the edges of the forest, that's where the non-magical creatures are, the stuff you'll be hunting. Deeper in there's stuff... stuff that'll bite back.
Yeah, I'm sorry, it was just all too much. Can you, uh, not tell my mother it's you? I don't want her to worry.
"Thank you." The thestrals began to move, and soon enough I was sitting between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table. I barely listened to the sorting or McGonagall's speech, rather I scoured the table for anyone who might be my mate. It turns out Romilda Vane was the only Gryffindor apart from me and Neville to get an inheritance, which isn't entirely surprising. Our year is the only one who would have creatures in it so far, as we're the only ones old enough. A few might start cropping up in the seventh year, but until then, it's just us, and we have a small year compared to the others, although lots of us are actually purebloods, it's only ancient pureblood families with a history of inheritances that get them. Vane appears to be a submissive dryad by her scent. But one look at her, and I can tell she's not my mate. One more look down the Gryffindor table and I can tell there's no one else in my house with an inheritance, and I know I wont be able to find anyone else in the Great Hall; the scents and noises are too much; and even if I did, I wouldn't be able to catch their eye. I sigh, and realise everyone has already started eating.
I begrudgingly acknowledge that you're right. Fine. I guess I'll be meeting my uncle shortly.
"Wait, I thought you were Draco Malfoy?" the pureblood girl asks, confused.
The picture you paint... I can't help but yearn for it. I shake my head. What am I thinking! Of course I don't want that! I want to be the strong, capable one, I want to protect my mate and chicks. Of course I do. I do. That's what I want. It is. I want that.
"I understand why you think you do, but trust me. He... for his whole life, he was so sure he would be a dom. He never started sub training until the summer." And I'm guessing he didn't put in as many hours as I did. "He's the most, well, submissive sub I've ever encountered. I think he's scared doms will abuse that, especially since you used to... argue so much." I feel a growl rumble in my chest. How dare he suggest I would do such a thing! "I don't mean to say you would," he continues quickly. "It's just... Draco's scared. I know you want to help, I do too, but the best way to do that is just let him have his space until he gets used to it." I sigh. I don't like it, but he's right.
Hey, Harry, careful. Don't scare her.
"Mateo. I'll be back soon." At that, he leaves. I exhale deeply. Thank Merlin for Blaise, and Mateo. I didn't know I had become so reliant on my uncle's dominant nature during the summer, and how much I needed a dominant's presence in my life. Once again, I feel my mood drop as I realise how much I want my mate, but can never have them. I get back in bed, not before adjusting my pillows and comforter into the vague shape of a nest, and curl up, clutching a pillow to my chest.
Just wait a while longer, Eli. Let him finish. Then we can spend a forever in it.
"We're good." I turn to Neville. "Are you okay?" His head is ducked, arms folded around him. I must've scared him, bringing out his sub side. He nods, taking a deep breath. I sit next to him. "Relax, Nev, it's okay. I'm not nor was I ever mad at you. I'm sorry for losing control. I won't let anything hurt you." I sense him relax slightly, and he looks up at me.
"What do you mean?"
"Now many of you may think you know a lot about Veelas, but your information is most likely incorrect. There are actually three kinds of Veelas. Do we have any in the room?" Blaise grumbles behind me, but begrudgingly stands up. I'm unsure whether I should or not.
C/W: panic/anxiety
"Sh, sh, it's okay, you're okay. I'm not mad, I promise, I understand, I've got you, you're okay. You're so good, my mate, my sub, so good. I've got you, you're okay. Everything's alright, mate mine. Everything's alright." I take a shaky breath, willing myself to stop crying, and once my mate realises I'm calming down he pulls me into his lap, against his chest, and I let myself relax against it, ignoring the voice in the back of my mind telling me I can't get too close. Instead I inhale deep lungfuls of his scent, nuzzling my face against the scent gland in his neck, and let him stroke my hair.
"Come with me, I'll show you what you look like." I know she's trying to distract me, and I try not to fall for it but fail miserably. I want to see what I really look like! I've been waiting to feel comfortable with what I see in the mirror for years, ever since I realised that uncomfortable feeling was a disconnect. That wasn't my body, but this is! I'll ask her what she meant afterwards.
"He probably needs some space. Leave it for a bit, let him cool down."
"Why not?"
No, Eli.
"Forest." Didn't you say the forest was dangerous? There are harmful beasts, could hurt mate?
I proceed to clean up the wounds on his chest and shoulder as best I can, before moving to his wings. I don't quite know how to address them. I can tell just by running my finger through the feathers that a lot are loose, and are making the wings a lot heavier than they need to be. A lot are also matted with blood, and I think the only thing for that would be to take a bath. But I can at least remove the old ones. I groom his wings with my fingers, and sure enough more feathers than I expected come loose and fall away. I realise the ones that do are a much darker colour and look a lot messier and duller. It takes a while to do the whole of his wings, them being so big, but the motions are relaxing, and to be honest, I would give anything to simply be touching my mate. Once I'm done, what is probably hours later, his wings are more delicate-looking, softer, and shinier. They were beautiful before, but now they're so much more. I can barely take my eyes away. That's probably why I don't notice immediately when he wakes up. When I finally pull my eyes away, it's to his eyelids fluttering, breath more irregular.
Harry furrows his brow, tuning Draco out, he reaches further into the depths of the refrigerator. He knows there's got to be something in here somewhere. It had been his turn to host taco night this past week. A tradition Hermione had insisted upon as they’ve gotten older. Everyone was getting busier and busier so having a standing date every week ensured their little family some much-needed time for catching up.
Well, ok maybe he could. And sure maybe he
“Really?” Draco replies sounding doubtful.
“I just figured I’d put mine away for later and we can both share the butter chicken. Nice and even. No more spice wars. ‘Sides I reckon there’s plenty of time for us to build up your tolerance.”
"I love you more than anything. I love her very much, but in a very different way."
Harry clutches at his sides and folds in on himself with uproarious laughter. Never in a million years did Harry think he’d ever have Draco Malfoy in his flat. Even if he did he would never have guessed it would be because they were on a date. On top of all that to see the refined, elegant heir to the Malfoy’s so disheveled and hoovering sour cream into his mouth as if his life depended on it? It was all too much.
“Oh Draco, we never wanted you to see this."
“What if he doesn't want to come for tea, Pansy? Not everyone likes tea."
“Not ruined,” Harry agreed, cheeks warming a bit. Why was this soft comforting back and forth making him so much more nervous than all of the blatant flirting? “Actually I’d say this went better than I ever thought our first date would go.” He says with a laugh.
“Well…I don't have any bread... You could wait for me to make you some plain rice. That’d take about thirty minutes or so. This will stop the burn right now.” Harry waves the spoon back and forth in front of Draco, careful not to spill any on the floor between them.
“I know!” Draco shrieks cutting Pansy off. His grey eyes were lit up with a sort of manic intensity. “Why would I ever start dating that absolute nutter when I had been dating Potter? As if I would ever leave him once I finally got him!”
"Oh, enough boys! Draco sit! You’re not doing yourself any favors by getting all worked up.”
Who would have guessed that a mere three years later would find them entangled on Harry’s couch pawing at each other like overeager 6th years? Again, something Draco may or may not have dreamt about before.
“Now that you're feeling a bit better let me ask you a serious question-,” he lowers his voice to just above a whisper, “You're not embarrassed to be seen with me, are you? Looking as disheveled as I do?”
They were exactly one fortnight away from the big day and at this point, it was too late to do anything about it. His mother had been very insistent that they get his robes from a Parisian shop currently run by the well-known robemaker Aurélien Rousseau. The Rousseaus had been creating wedding robes for the Malfoy family for nearly 800 years. When Aurélien had heard that Draco would be getting married and no less to the boy who lived, he had paid a personal visit to Narcissa ensuring the tradition continued. Beyond charmed by the man, she simply couldn't refuse and had pestered Draco until he gave in. He had offered to break from tradition and to make Harry’s robes as well but after meeting the renowned robemaker Harry declined due to him being “a pompous half-wit”.
“I was going to say blood,” she feigns the most innocent look she can muster.
. I’ll have you know I’m a good lad. Pure of heart, body, and soul!”
Harry taps the spoon against the lid and declares, “This will help.”
“A full fortnight of ‘workouts’ just from one more sundae?”
“I know these are your favorite so how about we come here right after the wedding so you can have one before we leave for Italy?”
! I’m not eating a spoonful of sour cream.” He spits out as if it was the worst fate he could possibly face.
That particular memory coupled with Potter’s loaded stare made all the nonchalance Draco had managed up to this point practically fly out of the window right onto the Quidditch pitch. He feels a warm unpleasantness creep over his face. Almost of their own accord his hands lift to cup his cheeks confirming just how flushed he was becoming. Green eyes twinkled with amusement and a knowing smirk crept onto Potter’s lips.
“Well, I didn't.” Draco counters.
Though, he was willing to admit now, that Potter might not be the only stupid one.
—works and I’m finished off—
. Spotting his friends across the chamber he strides over and throws the parchment down in a huff. “What
Harry wipes the tears from his eyes and looks over to see Draco gently running his fingers up and down his throat, his head tilted back, eyes closed in pure bliss. He’s softly whispering to himself in a low calming tone. Harry sits up a bit straighter. How could someone with bogies covering half their face still be so attractive?
“Very.”
His face is flushed a deep red that Harry reckons would match one of his Gryffindor jumpers quite nicely. His face is also very
“I’m crass?
—me die, have you? Come to make sure your vile plan—
It also meant that Harry had certain ingredients that he normally would never keep in his fridge. Lucky for Draco.
Draco Malfoy would have never dreamt he'd find himself in his current position.
“Way past that stage for you now, huh?"
Harry fights the urge to roll his eyes all the way into the back of his head. As calmly as he can muster he repeats, “This will help.” He holds up the container so Draco can see.
prominent family had numerous antiques stolen from their Manor. Most of the antiques that had been stolen had been very rare and very old. Not so bad in and of itself. So, what was making this case tougher than most? Most of the spellbooks that had been taken were finding their way into muggle London. Old magic was typically too powerful to handle for the average magical person. So, in the hands of muggles, the books had been wreaking havoc. They were lucky only one muggle had been severely hurt so far.
“Well, I never thought that once I had you alone in here—all to myself—” Draco leans himself even closer. “—that mucus would be the first bodily fluid I would get to come out of you.”
Stupid, stupid Potter.
much delight in you looking like an indecent filthy little mess.” Draco puts his hand atop Harry’s and guides it a bit more towards the inner curve of his thigh.
“I know that Zabini. Don't get smart with me! I meant what is written
“The band? How about all the pathetic wannabe vampire crap?” Pansy counters.
—into this mess. Harry had been working a particularly tough case. A very,
“Yes...well…thank you.”
“Draco—”
Draco grabs a napkin off the table and dabs at the corners of his mouth in an overly exaggerated dainty manner, “What a pair we make.”
Harry opened his mouth to counter but Draco cuts him off, “Now, outside of clothing, I assure you I very,
—I put it back in—
“Wait, are you already together?”
“Yes, Professor. It won't happen again,” Draco sheepishly mumbled while the class erupted into quiet giggles.
A delicate, familiar hand starts to rub his back in a soothing up and down motion, “You’ll be fine and if anyone tries to take the piss out of you I’ll hex them into oblivion.”
A delicate pink hue blooms across Draco’s cheeks and he looks down at Harry’s hand. Tawny golden skin flushed with a warm glow; a stark contrast to his own cool, rosy pallor. So obviously different but upon closer inspection, there were more similarities to be found. Deep down they were so alike and it just worked. It more than worked-it was perfect. They were perfect.
“Sometimes I think you love Mother more than you do me.”
‘I’m being too hard on Potter’ was what Draco had meant to say. Alas, his mind took all of his jumbled inner monologue and with a very unfortunate slip of the tongue he announced - “I’m hard for Potter!”
“Potter...”, shallow breathing causes Draco’s voice to be lighter, softer, barely managing a whisper. He hardly recognizes it as his own.
“My mouth…?” Hary questions absently bringing his fingers up to his lips.
—going black. Tell my mother I said farewell. I shall—
“It. Will. Help. Stop being a child.”
So, where did that leave them? Was this supposed to be a one-off thing blamed on hormones and secret pining? Not that Draco had been doing any of said pining, thank you very much. That sounded like something a stupid childish git would be up too. Right up Potter’s alley.
Blaise nods his head in agreement.
“I was.”
Draco smirks and turns his shoulders slightly so it’s not as awkward for him to reach with his unoccupied hand for, what Harry assumes, is going to be his cheek. He closes his eyes to await his well-earned prize of finally getting Draco to forget about those damn robes and let loose a bit. Draco so rarely allowed the ‘vulgarity of expressing the physical aspect of love in public’, as he so charmingly put it, so who was Harry to refuse?
Draco’s eyes widen and he lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s once more. His eyebrows were drawn together and his lips were turned down into a small frown. His eyes were dull and humorless gone was the glittering merriment that had lit them up just moments before. Draco felt like a mountain troll had ripped his heart out of his chest and stomped it into oblivion. He hated seeing Harry anything but the happiest he deserved to be. Especially when it was his own smart mouth that had caused the grief (which he had been working on but old, snarky habits die hard).
—no!”
His little confession is met with blank stares on both of his friend’s faces. They sit for what feels like an eternity (though Draco knows it must have only been about 30 seconds) before both exploding into hysterics.
“I thought…” he nods towards the half-packed away meal.
“End of last term. At least.” Blaise chimes in.
Harry, taking advantage of Draco’s quiet introspection, lets his hands begin their exploration anew. The hand between bony shoulder blades slides upwards stopping to give a firm squeeze to the back of Draco’s neck before continuing up to stroke through silky white-blond locks. Harry lifts the other to Draco’s chest letting it rest tenderly just over where his heart lay in his chest.
—the kitchen—
He feels around blindly for another minute before his palm connects with a cylindrical container. He pulls it out towards him and adjusts his glasses as his eyes shift over the label.
“I think a perfect pair.” Harry grabs for one of Draco’s hands kissing the backside of it. “Say, there was less than half of that left,” he gestures with their still clasped hands towards what's left of the half-melted sundae, ”want me to grab another?”
“How long is ages,
He waits, eyes closed lips puckered ever so slightly, ready to receive Draco’s kiss. He waits to feel that delicate, pale hand to gently caress his cheek. He waits... and waits until he finally feels Draco turn his face completely away and that lovely hand reach right past him. Curious (and slightly disappointed) Harry cracks his eyes open just in time to see Draco cradling his sundae in one hand and shoveling the biggest scoop of ice cream he can manage into his mouth with the other.
"What are you going to do? Tell your father?" Blaise quips although his tone is playful.
Draco crosses his arms tighter around himself and slumps down a little further into his seat not caring at the moment how childish he might appear.
“It’s—
“Yes, I read it. I’m a nosy little gossip. Of course, I’m going to read something in full when I see my own name. Acting surprised at me fancying Potter? Really? That’s only insulting your powers of observation, I’m not at all that subtle. No, we are not together already. Why would I be here with you when I could be cozied up with him someplace nice and secluded? In a perfect world, I will win him over yet. Yes, I would like to formally announce it. It’s the pureblood in me—I do so love an announcement. Pansy, please don't fret. I assure you when I have successfully wooed that idiot we will most definitely partake in a lovely afternoon tea.”
love then?” Blaise teases.
Draco looks away and picks at the sofa for a minute before quietly asking, “Do you have a towel or something…?” He gestures vaguely at his face.
Blaise shares a sly glance with Pansy, "This is a better reaction than we had prepared for. Much calmer." He's not able to hide the amusement on his face now.
somehow. Harry quite liked that as a concept. He and Draco being a
“Good! That's the spirit!,” Harry exclaims while giving a hearty slap to Draco’s thigh just above the knee. “You happy now, Your Majesty?”
If Draco kept indulging every time he wanted sweets, the very tight, currently very flattering waist, would only highlight his lack of self-control.
A hushed silence filled the room and Draco opened his eyes to find every student’s gaze fixed upon him. Curiously enough most of the faces staring back did not seem surprised by his declaration but displayed various degrees of amusement.
Speaking of his Majesty - had Draco’s little outburst had any effect on him? Feeling it was too late for discretion at this point Draco threw all caution to the wind and glanced back over in Potter’s direction.
“Seduce you?
Well, when you put it like that how can I refuse?”
“And just what else have you thought about when concerning us?” Draco drops his voice to a soft husky whisper causing Harry to lean in. To hear better is all…
For Draco, it was comforting to know he would have more than lonely nights filled with wistful dreams to keep him company from now on.
Draco Malfoy doesn't think anything should be quite so difficult. Especially a boy. Except this particular boy does happen to be a git. Of epic proportions. He glances up from his Transfiguration notes to observe his new difficult problem.
It was Harry’s turn to blush now. “Is that so? Prefer me naked do you?”
“Because-,” Harry leans in even closer invading all that was left of Draco’s personal space his voice dipping lower into a seductively husky whisper, “you didn't seem to mind me looking so
With a triumphant grin, he reaches into the drawer to his left and rifles around until he feels a spoon and pulls it out. He returns to his living room to find Draco still slumped down in defeat clutching at his throat quietly moaning to himself.
“Complete ridiculousness!”
Draco hesitates a bit before answering, “Not a lot of it. I skimmed through mostly, enough to notice that I was mentioned. Once or twice—I think...,” his voice trails off and he turns his head away avoiding eye contact.
In the end, dealing with the capricious man had been well worth it in Draco’s opinion. He now was lucky enough to be in possession of the most breathtaking set of robes he had ever had the privilege to call his own. Rich black velvet and dark forest green silks accented by delicate silver details throughout draped perfectly over his figure. The focal point of the ensemble was an extravagant, glittering brooch holding a silk sash together at his slender waist. Stunning as he looked that was where his problem had arisen from. One did not have an Aurélien Rousseau made to fit them, one must fit into the design Aurélien gifted upon them.  Every robe purchased from the illustrious shop has an enchantment placed upon it so you cannot change a thing about the creator's vision. Which meant no expanding the fabric to accommodate pre-wedding treats. Even if they happen to be very, very good treats that you wait for all year.
—going? Am I to be left here all alone? To—
“What have you—
“Ok,” Draco’s lip curls upwards into a small smile, “I will then. I’ll eat so many I’ll never fit into robes made by high-strung French blighters ever again!”
“Alright, have it your way then. My poor mother will have to deal with the humiliation of having to see her one and only darling son walk down the aisle with all his bits hanging out-”
"You knew about this—this…monstrosity?!" Draco accuses, struggling with what exactly to call the offending object in question.
As he’s feeling about he thinks back over how they—
Harry chooses to ignore his date for the moment as he makes his way over to his fridge. He opens the door and starts to rummage around looking for something to help with the spice. As he roots around he is graced with more of Draco’s bellyaching from the couch.
Lucius--or more likely the person he had paid to do it for him--had done their research on the Dursley family well, and had sent four tickets with Harry included in the invite. Vernon and Petunia couldn’t think of a good enough reason to leave Harry behind without it looking bad on them, so they’d reluctantly allowed him along.
Despite his orgasm, Harry was already thinking of going again. If Draco could destroy him with pleasure like that every time, then Harry would gladly give his life.
Draco shot him back a smirk. “What kind of manor would we have been if we
"Cocky, much?"
Draco’ brows furrowed in confusion--there shouldn’t be any pain from the potion, unless he’d messed up the quantities of ingredients somehow--but worries of bad potion making flew out of his head at the sound of Harry’s delicious whimper as Draco’s finger grazed his prostate. So what if Harry hurt a bit? Fucking him hard would ease it.
if I wanted to go out, so it's only fair I get to choose where we go," Draco said. "Besides, I'm around straight people all day; I don't want to be around them all night, too."
“You feel so big,” Harry purred, and it wasn’t an exaggeration. Draco’s cock felt hot and heavy in his hands, and silky smooth. “I want to worship every inch of your cock.”
“I don’t deny it,” Draco admitted. “But all of this behaviour could be the work of a poltergeist. You’ll have to work a lot harder to convince me it’s a demon.”
“Oh, don’t take my insults to mean I dislike you,” Draco said, still smiling. “Since leaving school you’ve become far less irritating, and you’re tolerable on most days, but there is something I like about seeing your eyes flash with anger.”
As much as the idea of working for
That, Harry could agree on.
“Remember that potions smuggler we brought in?” Draco said. “His lawyer is claiming we mishandled evidence, so Robards needs us to go to every little detail of the file to prove that we didn’t.”
He flipped a switch which blasted light in the upstairs corridor before it was promptly turned off.
“Truthfully, the first time was an accident,” Draco murmured. “Then I saw your reaction to it, and I knew I wanted to see it again. I must admit I’ve been teasing you by getting you worked up in inappropriate places, but that doesn’t lessen my desire for you, and frankly, what else can we do while we wait for backup, if not finally give in to what we both want?”
Harry’s blush deepened. “As if I’d be scared of you.
Draco ignored it, running towards Harry and drawing him into his arms. Harry melted against the warm body as Draco kissed him soundly. Draco grasped him tightly as though he was afraid to ever let Harry go, and Harry realised just how much he loved being in Draco’s arms.
Harry supposed he’d always recognised Draco as attractive in a vague sort of way. He was tall, lean, blond, and handsome in a pointy sort of way--there wasn’t anything
“Thank you, Dudley,” Luna said, turning her smile towards the other man. “Come through to my office. I’ll transfigure you a chair. I can see you’re uncomfortable using a bean bag, though they really are fun chairs. I can’t promise how good they are for your posture, but I think I’d rather be happy than have good posture. Can I get you a drink? I have hemp juice in my office, but I can send Dudley for tea or coffee if you prefer.”
“I’d like that. Like you say, who knows when we might get wiped out by a volcano.”
Draco turned to Potter, heart pounding in his chest. Potter bit his lip nervously and glanced away, before forcing his fiery gaze back on Draco.
“I don’t know, I didn’t have anything to do with the booking,” Draco snapped. Realising he was on the defensive, he shot Harry a shaky grin.
—it seemed like he was maybe on his way up, and maybe he needed to embrace that to keep the momentum going. Or he could keep his feelings to himself and avoid rejection; he hadn’t quite decided yet.
“What?” Harry snapped, finally fed up of not knowing what Ginny was up to.
“How big are you?”
“Yes,” Harry agreed, smiling. “I am.”
“Is it?” Draco gasped and held a hand to his chest. “I never knew. If I call you by your name, you’ll have to call me by mine.”
Dobby put the last suitcase in the boot of the car, and Harry felt like there was an hourglass counting down to his fate, and the last grain of sand had finally fallen. His heart felt heavy, and his legs were like lead as he dragged himself over to the car miserably.
“You start on the outside and work your way in, it’s really not that complicated,” Draco said. “I suppose your experience of dining comes from the Weasleys, and they certainly have no concept of fine dining.”
Draco’s stomach was in knots, feeling like it was frozen and burning all at once. It felt like he was in some kind of twisted nightmare, where things just kept getting worse and worse.
“Why do you keep staring at my crotch?”
He hurried out into the cold stone corridor, wand in hand as he hurried to the staff room. Like at Durmstrang, Hogwarts had a special alarm only the professors could hear in emergency, but this was the first time Harry had ever heard in a non-drill capacity.
Draco was pensieve for a moment. “Well let’s make the most of the time we have while you’re still here. I’m going to make sure that you’re happy for every last moment you’re here.”
She smiled at them brightly until it came to checking their booking, at which point her demeanour changed at once and she all but threw the key across the front desk at them.
“I work in a coffee shop,” Harry said.
Visiting a cemetery was morbid, but Harry wasn’t exactly squeamish.
hunt, we’ll have a day of playing tourist. We can’t splash around for any more days in the sun, though, so don’t get your hopes up.”
Harry glanced at the watch on his wrist, scrubbing the paint off the face so he could read the time. It was four in the afternoon, and last time Harry had checked it had been early morning.
He was grateful that Draco was there to lean on, otherwise he was sure his legs would have given way by now. He’d never come by someone else’s hand before, and though the sensations were the same, the mental awareness it was someone else only made his orgasm more intense.
“But,” Astoria continued, disregarding Draco’s interruption, “if I do, then Pansy will come up, and she’ll hex you out of here. Daphne has some good news for you, which I think you’ll be really pleased to hear.”
“It does exist, though,” Potter said before he pulled away. “I’ll prove it to you.”
for you, Harry. If, Merlin forbid, I'm not the only lover you ever have, I know at least that I'll have been the best."
Harry finally reached for his neglected cock, his orgasm tearing through and over him almost at once. He cried out Draco’s name as his body seized up before it melted bonelessly against the desk, shuddering as waves of pleasures continued to wash over him as Draco rode out his own orgasm. His hands gripped Harry’s hips tightly, a strangled cry falling from his lips as he released inside Harry.
“Needed a lie-in, did you?” Dobby teased. “The others have gone to Bergamo. Narcissa tried to wake you, but you were dead to the world.”
“Hello, I’m Harry and this is Draco. Can you say our names back to us?”
"That'll be my friend," Harry said, jumping up to grab a deck of tarot cards off the shelf. "I know this is only one thing, but how about I buy you dinner tomorrow night to make up for the second thing?"
He trailed off as figures appeared behind Malfoy's shoulders, tall figures, one with flaming red hair and the other with jet black.
Draco’s face was too harsh and sharp to be considered conventionally attractive--though Harry thought that Draco carried the pointiness rather well--but his body was like that of the gods. His chest was chiseled, and his abs had a well defined six-pack. Draco’s thighs were lean but well-muscled, and hanging between them was the most magnificent cock that Harry had ever seen. Even soft it was long and thick, and Harry hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it since.
Draco grinned. "Come sit round the counter with me, Harry. Have you ever used tarot cards before?"
Grey eyes follow the spoon and thin blond brows furrow in contemplation. As he’s sitting there trying to decide snot begins flowing from his nose anew. With a horrified look, from the snot, or from having to give in to the desperation of eating a heaping spoonful of plain sour cream, slender fingers rip the spoon from Harry’s grasp. In one smooth motion, Draco swallows the sour cream and deftly grabs the tub from Harry, scooping himself another generous portion just to be sure.
Harry had been more than a little surprised when the expert they had brought in to help with the case had been none other than Draco Malfoy himself. Draco, it turned out, had become quite the rare book authority after Hogwarts. Being a scholarly man, having obscene amounts of disposable money and plenty of free time were all things that had led him to the illustrious hobby of rare book collecting. He had amassed the largest collection in Britain.The second in all of Europe.
"Love you as well. Now accompany me for my stroll you, strumpet, you.”
“Yes, well, some of us don't have the luxury of allowing indulgences. Some of us have to keep our appearance in mind. Not everyone can go about their business in such … disheveled attire,” Draco snaps scrunching up his nose in distaste.
Draco Malfoy could never remember being as livid as he was at this very moment. With a flash of renewed irritation, he clenches the piece of parchment held in his left fist tighter. His footsteps echo harshly through the empty corridors as he hastily returns to the safe refuge of the Slytherin common room. To think that this
surprising. If he was being honest then maybe somewhere in some dusty corner of his mind that sat untouched for years he had always wanted to flirt openly with Draco. Those were thoughts for another day, however. He’s got a more urgent Draco dilemma to occupy him at the present.
Pansy sashays over to Draco’s side and grabs for his hand. Intertwining their fingers she sways them gently to and fro. A habit they had shared since they were first years.
“It was in there—”
"I waited all year for this. Of course, I could eat another. But I really shouldn't…," Draco's voice trails off with soft longing.
“Yes! Vampire Potter, please! I would suck his—”
“Yes, well, some of us could have gotten regular robes from a regular shop. Some of us didn't have to let their mum’s bully them into expensive new ones from the most exclusive robe shop in Paris from bloody nutters. Then some of us could be enjoying their day out with their fiancé instead of being insufferable.” Harry countered taking another large bite of his ice cream for emphasis.
“I suppose I did make quite the scene. I don't blame you for wanting to end the night here. I’ll take my leave once I look a bit more presentable—if you don't mind.” Draco laments softly as he rubs the soft cloth over his face.
“Gimme a minute.” Before getting up Harry grabs the tub of sour cream and the spoon he had brought in and disappeared into the kitchen once more. He returns with a bowl of warm water and a washcloth. Placing it gently down in front of Draco he turns to start packing up the pork vindaloo.
“How far have you gone?”
“Thanks Pans-” Before Draco could even finish the thought she reaches across him with her other hand, palm up, ready to take the coins Blaise was waiting to give her.
“No, I don't think so.”
“Oh, so it
“No, no! The best part, by far, was Draco and Potter! Or should I say Vampire. Why would—”
“Yeah, loads,” Harry matches Draco's smile with a dazzling one of his own breaking out across his handsome features. He settles himself back onto the coffee table between Draco’s knees.
—going black? I think everything is—
“You know… there is a fortnight until you have to fit into them. If you were to give in and have another, I can think of a couple of ways we can work off the extra calories,” Harry voice drops into a hushed whisper once more.
are trying to seduce
Shucking his usual elegance, Draco falls into a boneless heap onto a chair opposite of his friends. He crosses his arms and scrunches his nose in distaste at having one of his closest friends chastise him.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Yes, yes,” he stands and moves towards his kitchen.
Seemingly satisfied with the reaction he had caused from Draco, Potter winks before turning himself back toward the windows. The short interaction sends a pleasant hum of anticipation throughout Draco’s body.
“Really?”
Pansy reaches out to take a glance at the offending piece of paper. After scanning the first few lines her lips turn downwards and her plucked-to-perfection brows become furrowed.
Harry had prepared for the most unpleasant time of his life working together but Draco had been surprisingly...un-git like. Not at all the annoying twat he remembered Draco being at Hogwarts. Draco had been very eager and most gracious to extend his help and vast knowledge in any and every way he could to the Ministry. The relationship started out with both of them keeping a polite, sterile, professional distance from one another. As time went on they both warmed up and formed an easier-going rapport. That rapport soon flourished into a friendship. The friendship, however, quickly turned into outright flirting. Harry resolved when the case was solved that he would throw all caution to the wind and ask for a date. When that fated day had arrived Draco had beaten him to the punch and insisted Harry take him out.
“Who could’ve written this? I can’t recall anyone at Hogwarts called Tara Gilesbie.” Draco questions and hopes his subtle shift in direction will go unnoticed.
What was really the absolutely most maddeningly stupid thing Potter had done was strutted into class, walked right past, and gave him no acknowledgement whatsoever. As if last night never happened. How stupid could one person be?
Harry felt his face flush; had Malfoy seen all the furtive glances Harry had been sending his way? "Do you want...? I mean, are you—?"
Draco blinked, surprised that Potter was actually asking his opinion. “Haggis is nice. This is because you were Muggle-raised; they’re afraid of food that comes from all parts of the animal. Our kind don’t have such reservations.”
“Don’t you just burn in the sun? You’re so pale,” Potter laughed. “And yes, after we’ve finished with our
“Yes, I’m beautiful, we all know that,” Draco said, waving a hand airily. “However I am an ex-Death Eater who bullied the hell out of him and his friends in school. His overly-large heart might have forgiven me enough for us to become friends, but I’m not going to open my heart to Harry just to have him reject me.”
“Please! Malfoys don’t get drunk. As soon as I was thirteen, my father had me drinking good wine and good whiskey, and taught me how to drink it like a gentleman.”
"I assure you, you won't be doubting my abilities once we're done," Draco said as he pushed Harry gently until he was on his back. He spread Harry's legs and slid between them so they could kiss again.
. Various trinkets dangled from the ceiling over the waiting area: dream catchers, beaded threads, lines of corkscrews, and flower chains.
“Ah, he’s here.”
in them," Draco said and grinned. "You're a pretty shitty singer, though."
Draco shook his head and smirked. “No, Blaise doesn’t care who’s there as long as he gets alcohol and sex as soon as he can. Get ready now because we’re leaving soon. Oh, by the way, Harry; your book is upside down. Nice attempt at a save though.”
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. “I don’t know. Are we?”
Francesco led Harry over to the dancefloor by the hand. The song that had just been playing ended, and Aha’s
And tried not to think too hard about the fact his stomach fluttered every time he saw Draco smile.
Fucking Draco, Harry thought again.
Ava stepped forwards and stumbled, and Harry caught her easily in his arms. "I just wanted to be happy," she sobbed.
“Very funny, Potter,” Draco said dryly, but Harry looked too surprised for it to be fake.
Draco looked back at Potter, who was angled towards Draco and looking at him intently. He looked confused, no doubt lost about what was going on—either that, or he was wondering how he could have failed to find the Loch Ness Monster.
Draco stepped close behind Harry, his wand at the ready. Harry clearly hadn’t factored in the possibility of being attacked by a wild animal, but Draco certainly had. He could almost imagine some sharp-toothed coyote leaping out at Harry, only to be stopped by Draco’s spell. Harry would swoon, and cry, “
“So where have you been around the world?” Harry asked after deflecting Draco’s attempt to get him to order himself a latte--Hermione had forewarned Harry that ordering a latte would only get him milk, rather than the coffee the British were used to.
Lucius and Narcissa had spent much of the meal boasting of Draco’s many achievements throughout his life, so at least it wouldn’t look odd that Harry was keeping his attention focused on him.
“Good morning, Sleeping Beauty,” Draco said, without looking away from the page he was on. “Didn’t anyone teach you sun safety?”
It was impossible to deny that Draco was attractive, with his tall, lean form, and his icy hair and eyes, but the bloke was still a prat and sharing a bed with a prat overruled the idea of sharing a bed with an attractive man.
They were finally playing music together, but Harry couldn’t have guessed he’d have such a strong reaction to watching Draco play the piano. But here Harry was, half-hard and utterly transfixed.
Draco certainly didn’t see any appeal to the screeching, leathery scraps of animal, and he definitely hated having to clean up their waste, and the Merlin-awful scent that clung to Draco long after he left for home.
"Well," Harry said, grinning, as he took a seat on the edge of Draco's desk. "Maybe you shouldn't offer to do my work for me.I am quite capable, you know."
Ava shook her head, her dark hair falling lankly around her face. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to drag you here. The Mirror of Erised was so wonderful and showed me all my dreams—I thought living inside it would make them all come true."
Draco and Pansy rolled their eyes simultaneously.
Harry sank to his knees, teasing his fingers along the edge of Draco’s boxers as he looked up at him pleadingly.
“Are you part of an international goat smuggling ring?” Draco asked, raising a brow. “I’ll not assist you with that; I’ve had my share of illegal clubs.”
The planchette moved to the ‘yes’ again.
Draco turned so he was sat opposite Harry, and as their knees brushed Harry shivered. “Do what you want to do, Harry. You’re safe here.”
Potter nodded grimly. “He didn’t give me much of a choice. And thank you; you look ridiculous too.  Didn’t you even want to wear fancy dress for one night?”
Draco reached towards Harry and curled his fingers against Harry’s cheek. They both froze, gazes meeting.
“I don’t want to go home,” Harry said quietly. “I want everyday to be like this, but I have to go back to England and my crappy life there.”
“And be stuck in the crowds of tourists?” Draco scoffed. “Not likely. Get up; we’re going as soon as you’re dressed.”
"Because," Draco huffed. "I can beat Weasley any time I like, and I'm trying to be a good boyfriend by helping you beat him too."
Harry grinned. “That sounds a fair trade.”
“That might be the most ridculous reason to fuck that I’ve ever heard, but I’d be a fool to turn it down. Now turn over and I’ll fuck you into oblivion before the demon sends us there himself.”
Maybe he ought to just drown himself in the lake to save dealing with his rapidly-getting-out-of-hand-crush. But first, Harry had to get his own back on Draco by showing him just how fast he could be when he wanted to be.
“Of course you will,” Blaise said. “I’ll ask mother’s new lover to pay the cost, so feel free to go somewhere expensive. Oh, don’t look so scared, Harry; just dance like I taught you too. Draco, just...look less like a stuffy old Pureblood and act your age for once.”
As soon as Malfoy cast the spell, the sound of static crackling played from the mirror, loud enough that it felt like they standing right in the source of the noise. The crackling became distorted every few seconds, but Harry could begin to hear distant footsteps amongst the static.
Draco’s nose crinkled as he lowered himself to the slightly worn carpet, mirroring Harry’s cross-legged position. The board had the letters of the alphabet scattered across the centre of it, with the words ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ written in the corners.
Harry huffed, and tossed and turned on his bed, before hurrying back to fetch the speedos. His prick was aching for attention, and Harry was going to give it what it wanted.
“Fuck you too, Draco,” Pansy called back mildly. “Ginny and I will just have sex on your bed while you’re gone.”
hoped to impress, he was pretending he was Harry’s biggest supporter.
By the time they reached the bottom of the steps, Vernon was red-faced and sweating, and he glared at Harry as if it was his fault. He hustled Harry, Petunia, and Dudley into Milan Airport, where they went through the rigmarole of passport and security checks, followed by waiting for their suitcases. Finally everything was sorted and they were able to make their way into the entrance lounge, where a man in a suit was waiting for them with a sign reading ‘
“This moment might end, but the feelings it created don’t have to,” Draco said. “And if you’re willing to give up so easily, you’re not the Harry Potter I thought you were.”
“My sanity is only wavering if you’re a non-believer,” Potter said wisely, tapping his hand against the text on his t-shirt. “The truth is out there, Malfoy.”
Draco turned to look at him then, the black of his pupils blown wide. His gaze dropped to Harry’s mouth as he licked his own lips hungrily.
“The cut of the fabric in Blaise’s ivory dress was stunning, don’t you think?” Pansy was saying. “I’m perhaps too busty to wear such a thing, but Daphne pulled it off beautifully.”
Dobby didn’t jump, or stop his dancing. “Thank you, Harry. We’re having spaghetti carbonara tonight, and the dough for the garlic bread is proving as we speak.”
“Stop being a brat and turn around,” Draco said, dumping his rucksack on the ground.
“I’ll see you tomorrow night, yeah?” Harry asked after they pulled apart, giving Draco a soft, kind smile.
Lucius made an announcement that the Malfoy corporation and Grunnings had settled on their business terms and officially formed a partnership. Vernon and Petunia looked both pleased and smug, and neither of them noticed the wicked gleam in Lucius’ eyes.
Draco turned in horror, but Dudley was already disappearing into Luna’s office, the coward.
Harry exchanged a glance with Malfoy and they both nodded.
Draco was entirely focused on the music, his face serene and calm. His long fingers moved deftly across the ivory keys--fingers that had brought Harry to new heights of pleasure--and the tune he was playing was utterly enchanting. It was a piece perfectly suited to be the backdrop of a glorious, magical, fantasy world, and Draco had chosen it because he said he knew Harry would like it.
Draco ignored him. “I thought you could paint on the go, and I could do more photography because I rather enjoyed that. I need to develop the photos I took in Italy still, and I thought you could perhaps help me with that. We could get a campervan of our own, stack it out with good wine, then we have all we need.”
"And who better to find an angsty teen, than someone who themselves was once an angsty teen," Malfoy added, shooting Harry a wicked grin. "Which is why I would also like to offer my services for the search."
“I play guitar,” Harry said, aware all at once of Draco’s steely grey gaze that was focused intently on him now. “I taught myself how to play a few years ago.”
Personally, Harry had no problem with campervans. He’d certainly slept in worse places over the course of his life.
“Nice to know you trust me with lasting memories of your holiday,” Draco said. “Sure hope you don’t regret it.”
He finally found him right at the end of the orchard, laying at the spot where the grass faded into the lake. Across the water were rocky hills dotted with terracotta houses. The lake water made a gentle splashing sound as it rocked onto the shore, carrying tiny pebbles with it.
“Er…”
“Hi,” Harry said half-heartedly. “Sorry, I don’t speak Italian.”
He and Draco had done surprisingly well sharing a bed. They had an unspoken agreement to sleep on their own respective edges of the bed, and hadn’t fought over blankets, or kicked each other in their sleep.
Harry didn’t think he’d ever been so hard in his life, and he wondered if it would be possible to come from just a tongue up his arse. Before he could figure that out, however, Draco’s tongue left him. Harry’s whine of disappointment turned into a yelp of rapture as both of Draco’s fingers pressed deep inside him and hit his prostate, sending jolts of scorching pleasure through him.
It was absolutely stunning, the colours of the artwork vibrant and beautiful. Harry cast his gaze towards the ceiling, and felt small, unimportant, and blessed all at once. He couldn’t tear his gaze away, and felt so serene looking up at the art.
While he appreciated the fact that the professors got their own viewing stand for Quidditch matches, he wished they'd made it a bit roomier. It was the first match of the season, which meant that despite the dark clouds, and cold, dreary weather, almost all of the professors and several of the school governors had come out to watch.
“You two would definitely make a hot couple,” Astoria added. “Does he fancy you back?”
They were also far too interested in Harry’s work for his liking, mainly because they listened to tales of his fantasy creatures with rapt attention and seemed to be siding with Harry’s perspective that those creatures actually existed.
“Harry! Going back inside to do more yoga?”
Harry felt his face flush in embarrassment. “Did Draco go too?”
“Besides,” Ginny added quietly as Pansy and Draco walked away to collect their Portkey. “I’m pretty sure Draco has a crush on you, so you can thank me later.”
“You have a point there,” Harry said with a grin. “When we get back to England, I’ll have to take you out for a McDonalds or something. They have them in Italy, too, I think, but I’m not going to pass up good Italian food while I’m here.”
“There are eyewitness accounts of the Chupacabra,” Potter defended hotly. “It lived undiscovered for so long that there’s not been much opportunity to take photos of it.”
He gave Potter a slow look up and down, savouring the sight of Potter’s slender, shapely thighs showcased nicely in tight leather, and his lithe torso wrapped up like a present ready to be undone. This close, Draco could see the kohl lining Potter’s eyes, which made the vibrant green shade pop even more.
“He's ‘eager for some action,’” Draco said, quoting Blaise. “Surely you must know that means he’s going to try and get Daphne into bed with him tonight.”
“Gorgeous, isn’t it?” Draco murmured, placing a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “The Greeks have the best olives in the world, they say.”
Harry shut Draco up by pressing their lips together, kissing him hungrily. Draco made a noise of surprise, but soon returned the kiss with equal ferocity. Draco’s tongue prodded at Harry’s lips, begging for entrance, and Harry parted his lips obligingly.
“And you’re okay with that?!” Draco exclaimed. “I wouldn’t consider someone much of a boyfriend if they wanted to have sex with someone else.”
Draco could scarcely believe that the big man out at the front was related to Potter, both so different in looks and temperament. He also couldn’t believe he’d had a proper interaction with a Muggle for the first time and not even realised it.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, quickly averting his gaze. "Er, should I move or...?"
Draco brushed his thumb over Harry’s forehead, and Harry froze at the soft touch. Draco, seemingly realised what he was doing in that moment, too, because he also froze, leaving them mere inches apart.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he took a sip of his wine and immediately shuddered. “What is this?!”
Harry swallowed heavily, the blacks of his eyes swallowing up the green with his desire. “I’d like that very much. So, your place?”
, if you'd bothered to tell me, then you'd have saved time staring at it wondering what to do, because while you were off playing the brave but dumb hero, I was finding us a charm which would help us immensely. But if you don't think I'm worth being included..."
“Excellent, excellent,”  Lucius declared as the song came to an end.
After they arrived at some rural farmland and Harry pulled a goat out of the case, Draco didn’t know whether or not he was pleased not to have asked for more information.
Draco scoffed. “They’d only be Mr Malfoy if their own surname wasn’t strong enough to double-barrel it. But no, there’s no future Mr Malfoy in my world right now. And you must realise that it makes you sound rather interested when you ask questions like that, don’t you, Potter? I don’t think Blaise would like that very much.”
“Just call me Harry; there’s no need to call me ‘sir’. But I was curious as to how you got the name Dobby. It’s not a name I’ve heard before.”
Besides, it was only a little extra alcohol; it wasn't like Draco was trying to poison Harry.
“I can do that,” Draco said, and Harry could almost hear the smirk in his voice. “One second.”
Harry rolled his eyes but shifted so that Draco could slide onto the chair beside him. "Are you sure I can't tempt you away from the chessboard and into that dark corner over there?"
He pushed the gate open to the restricted section, the metal creaking loudly in the silence of the library. He froze, half expecting Madam Pince to come running, when he remembered not only did he have every right to be there, Madam Pince had retired a couple of years previously.
“I like the idea of that a lot,” Harry said, stepping towards Draco to pull him into a kiss. “Where should we go first?”
“What else would I put in a hip flask? Milk?” Draco raised an elegant brow. “Relax, Potter, it’s only a little bit of whiskey; barely enough to get even partially drunk on. Just take a sip.”
“I really hate when you talk sense, Pansy,” Draco said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
feeling guilty that his uncle was potentially going to get ripped off.
“It’s not a ghost, didn’t you read the parchment properly?” Harry asked.
Dobby smiled and shook his head. “No, he chose to stay behind. He’s in a private orchard by the lake, if you want to find him. I’ll give you directions.”
Luna’s smile grew. “Nothing.”
“It sounds ridiculous,” Draco said bluntly, but found his cold exterior melting at Harry’s eager, amused expression. “But fine, I’ll try it with you even if just to prove it’s nonsense.”
“So did I,” Dudley said.
Good things didn’t happen to Draco, but somehow in the last few months he’d been gifted with an eccentric and reckless, but brilliant partner, alongside an unusual but enjoyable and well-paid job. Strangest of all, Draco was beginning to feel like he truly deserved all of it; or at any rate, he was going to fight to keep what he had now.
“Do you still paint?” Draco asked. He idly licked crumbs off his fingers, and Harry found himself transfixed watching him.
Watching Draco eat a peach was positively indecent, the way the juices dripped over his fingers and chin, and the way his tongue darted out of his perfect red lips to lick it clean.
The hotel clearly wasn’t anything special, with only the basic necessities, but it was brighter than the one in Loch Ness. The sun shining through the hallway windows was also a nice touch.
“That’s not a bad idea, actually,” Potter said thoughtfully. “With Gillyweed or the Bubble-Head Charm, we could get a better look than Muggles could.”
"Are you sure? I'm happy to do what we have been doing, Harry. You don't need to do anything you dont-"
The plane bounced as it landed on the runway, and Vernon let out a grunt of discomfort. Harry felt almost sad that they were back on land now and wondered idly if he should look into becoming a pilot--as if he could ever afford the training.
“Draco,” Harry urged breathlessly, and his eyes fluttered shut as Draco’s mouth began to suck at the sensitive skin on his neck. “Please…”
He brushed his hair out of his eyes, no doubt leaving a streak of green paint on his skin. Harry always felt most refreshed after painting when he was covered in almost as much colour as his canvases were.
“No,” Draco said. “But it seems like you do.”
“They’re perfectly safe,” Pansy said. “The Muggles use them all the time, and travelling like Muggles is en vogue right now.”
They placed their fingertips on the planchette before Harry spoke. “Hello, are there any spirits here who wish to communicate with us?”
“Do you want to go for a walk into the country?” Draco asked, fanning his face idly with a Spanish fan.
“Draco,” Harry breathed, not knowing if he dared ask him for more; for what he really wanted.
Draco blinked down at him, his plump, bruised lips moving soundlessly. It wasn't the reaction Harry had expected, and he was about the apologise when Draco finally snapped out of his stupor.
Harry was grateful that he was finally going on holiday, and not just being left behind with batty old Mrs Figg, but his family were definitely at the bottom of his list of people he’d choose to go on holiday with.
Ava shot Malfoy a glare, brushing bodily past him as her heels clicked on the library floor.
He scowled as Draco stood over him with a now-empty glass, looking far too pleased with himself.
Harry groaned into the kiss as Draco pressed down, his hard cock rubbing enticingly against Harry's thigh.
“I wasn’t eavesdropping,” Harry said quickly. “I was doing yoga and using the door for balance. Thanks for ruining that and knocking me to the floor, by the way.”
He had been dating Draco for a couple of months now, and they'd done plenty of kissing and sharing hand jobs and blow jobs, but they'd never had full-on sex. Harry had never had sex with anyone before, in fact, and the thought of having a cock up his arse was as daunting as it was enticing.
With that in mind, Harry knew he had to go and talk to Malfoy now, while he was still reeling on the high of rescuing Ava, and before he and Malfoy fell back into the easy routine of ignoring one another.
Draco rolled his eyes and snatched the money Harry was offering him. "Should I be concerned about how convincing you are at acting like a ditz? Oh right, it's not an act; my apologies."
If Harry could point out something he’d done wrong then he wouldn’t have minded so much that Draco was upset with him, but Harry didn’t think he’d done anything wrong at all. The only thing Harry could think was that Draco had only ever considered Harry a casual fling and was annoyed at Harry getting too attached.
after we've been."
Harry’s cheeks flushed hotly. He caught Draco’s eye, and they both looked away hastily.
Draco caught his eyes and gave him a knowing smirk, and Harry felt his face flush.
Harry shook his head, and walked beside Draco as he was told the many suitable pairings for certain kinds of wine, and foods that should never be mixed with certain types of wine, under any circumstance.
Harry turned to look at Malfoy with wild eyes, not having expected to have to face him so early in the term. Malfoy was entirely ruining Harry's carefully planned avoidance.
Harry couldn’t even bring himself to be amused by the idea of his uncle getting ripped off. Draco had promised to make Harry’s last days in Italy meaningful and happy, and instead he had left Harry feeling utterly miserable.
They made their way down the beach, and stepped gingerly into the sea. Despite the warmth of the sun, the sea still had a chilly bite to it, and Harry shivered as he slowly immersed himself in the water.
"Do you remember that day I caught Ava in the Restricted Section, while you strolled on by obliviously?" Draco asked. Harry scowled but nodded. "Well I went to the library records to see which restricted books had been taken out around that time and nearly all of them about other realms, and travelling to and from them."
Harry shook his leg to knock Draco's hand away. "We can't, Draco. We're not allowed."
Harry chose to take a seat under an oak tree, resting his back against the trunk. The leaves gave a pleasant amount of shade and carried a warm breeze.
,” Harry mouthed at Draco, as he tugged protectively at Gertrude’s leash.
Harry’s luck was up, it seemed.
“Well fuck him, quite frankly,” Draco said, harsher than intended. “He’s stuck in some kind of purgatory, and you’re out here in the world of the living. I think he ruined both of our lives enough when he was alive, and who are we to let him ruin it from beyond the grave? I—”
He took off his own t-shirt, hiding in the soft fabric as long as he could without seeming weird, and let it flutter down to their picnic blanket without a care for the sand that could blown into it.
Ron pretended to gag. "Let me wreck Weasley, then we can make out all you like."
His words were cut off as Harry’s lips descended on his, soft and warm, and so fast Draco was certain he’d imagined it for a second.
his type. “I’m pretty sure my cousin fancies her though, if she’s after a younger man.”
know that Kelpies are real, so Muggles aren’t too far off the truth. What else do you think Nessie might eat? I have cheese and meat, too.”
Harry was woken up by a blaring alarm going off in his room. He jumped out of bed, alert at once, a sparing glance at the clock telling him it was three in the morning.
Daphne grimaced and shook her head. “No, go now.”
“I thought you wanted to go somewhere expensive for dinner,” Harry said as a way of greeting as he slid into the rubbed-seated booth opposite Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes and mouth back, “
Draco opened his mouth to argue, and then thought better of it because Potter probably had a point.
Harry nodded, and swallowed heavily. He pressed up on the balls of his feet, his mouth hovering just inches over Malfoy’s. His heart pulsed with anxiety and excitement, and he could feel his fingers trembling; he pushed them against Malfoy’s side to ease their shaking.
and…would you like to go out? On a proper date sometime, I mean.”
“I thought as much,” Ginny said, rolling her eyes. “Come on, I’ll get you something to eat.”
“Deal,” Harry said. “Oh, do you-?”
Draco let out a bark of laughter. “Hardly. Some people would even say I bullied him.”
Draco’s hand slipped lower, sliding below his shorts and boxers until his fingers reached Harry’s cock. Harry let out a gasp as Draco’s fingers brushed against his prick, and his breath hitched when those fingers curled around his length.
Still, he waited with bated breath as Draco flipped through the pages, his expression unreadable. Harry couldn’t explain why Draco’s approval was so important to him.
Harry took the potion, followed by the water, and gave Draco a grateful smile.
Draco jumped up and stood by the fireplace almost as soon as it flared to life. Harry gave him a confused look as he stumbled out of the green flames.
Draco wondered if he’d be seeing more of Potter now that he was Blaise’s bed pet, at least for the next month or so. He hoped Potter knew of Blaise’s tendency to throw his toys away once he was bored of them. Draco had never understood Blaise’s harsh attitudes towards his partners; in Draco’s mind, a partner should be cherished and courted with serious intentions.
Harry nodded. Ginny and Pansy had gone off to do their own thing, as usual, and he and Draco had already been sat in comfortable silence, drinking rich coffee, for a while.
He made his way to Harry’s office, frowning when he heard voices he didn’t recognise coming from within. The accents were distinctly American sounding, and he couldn’t recall Harry ever saying he knew Americans.
“My mum and dad don’t even know I’m back in touch with Harry, or that I’m dating Luna. I think if I ever introduced them to Luna, they’d both have heart attacks.”
“Sadly, you aren’t being paid to sunbathe,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “And these creatures aren’t imaginary.”
"Cool," Harry said aloud to nobody in particular. He'd never been in a magic shop before, but he'd alays been fascinated by books and movies set in fantasy worlds.
Harry dropped his own bag before doing as Draco said, and immediately gasped when he saw the view. From this high on the hill he could see the entirely of Lake Como and its sparkling, deep blue waters surrounded by tall trees covered in lush green trees. A pretty terracotta villages were dotted around the lake.
“Me neither,” Dudley said, clambering to his feet. “Uh, I need to get off now anyway. I have, uh, something to pick up for Mum. See you later, Harry, Draco.”
Luna and Dudley were in Luna’s office when Draco and Harry returned to the
Draco stopped walking abruptly, and Harry almost tripped over his own feet to stop from colliding with him.
“We’re outnumbered,” he mouthed, using his grip on Harry’s arm to haul him into the nearest closet.
"What is this place?" Malfoy snarled.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “I mean, scientists have said that the photos are either hoaxes, or something other than a monster, but they could just be covering up the truth because that would mean admitting to something beyond their imaginations! Muggles are great at ignoring signs of our world, so it could happen in their world too!”
“But,” Potter continued, ignoring Draco’s comment, “I think you’re really going to enjoy working here. We’re going to be searching for all kinds of creatures that supposedly exist in the Muggle world. You won’t need to write anything, but you can take photos and make notes while we’re on our search, and proof-reading will come in really handy because I’m hopeless at grammar.”
“You’re positively smitten, Draco!” Blaise was saying. “It’s disgusting, really. I thought you were better than that.”
"Is everything alright, Ava?" he asked with concern. "You don't seem to be enjoying the class, and I wondered if you were having difficulty with the subject, or is there something else bothering you?"
Potter rolled his eyes. “I never knew I could be attracted to such a prat, but all your ridiculous insults get me hot under the collar. But would you? Like to go on a date, sometime, I mean?”
Harry worked the lower end of Draco’s erection with his hand, moving his fingers in gentle circling motions while his mouth bobbed up and down the top half. His lips weren’t even touching his fingers, a true testament to Draco’s size. He resisted the urge to palm at his own cock, not wanting to even consider coming until he had Draco fully inside of him.
The room fell silent but for the sound of their panting as they caught their breath. Harry winced slightly as Draco carefully pulled out of him, his arse still sensitive.
Harry lifted his head from its slumped position on his arms, not sure if he’d heard Draco correctly or if his fantasy of Draco screwing him senseless underneath the stands at the Quidditch World Cup had seeped into reality.
Harry stabbed angrily at his scrambled eggs, and spent the rest of the meal grumpy, and Draco-less.
There were also several photos of Potter with various friends, Granger and Weasley featured most often. A little boy with bright blue hair also appeared in a lot, and Luna and Dudley waved at Draco from a couple of frames, too.
Draco slapped his arse. “Get a move on, Potter.”
“What’s wrong? I heard from Daphne, who heard from Luna, that you seem to be really liking your new job,” Astoria said.
Draco blinked and snapped his attention to Harry. He hadn't realised he'd been preoccupied with fantasies of Harry...again.
“That’s friendly of you to say,” Harry said. “I’m turning off the Spirit Box now, thanks for speaking to us.”
will do a much better job."
The grey of Draco's eyes was only a tiny rim around his blown pupils. He swiped his lower lip with his tongue as he looked down at Harry with a new hunger.
He was very pleased that he was an expert in wearing a formal mask in public, otherwise he’d have jumped when he turned back to Pansy, only to find her smiling up at Blaise and Potter who’d appeared.
The air was already beginning to cool as the afternoon dawned on, and he just about ready to ride around yelling Draco’s name, when he spied a familiar bike chained to a rustic gate.
Harry leaned backwards, pressing his body against Draco’s arm, delightfully warm.
“Muggles know about poltergeists,” Harry said. “Not to say they all believe in them, but they’re not unknown by any means.”
“Just one glass won’t do any harm,” said Draco breezily. “Besides, I think we’re going to need a boost if we want to get through the case of two squabbling grandmothers.”
“No stopping until we’re at the top,” Draco called back. “You can rest if you want; I’ll wait for you at the end.” He looked back and shot Harry a satisfied grin.
He was well into his reading when he became aware of a figure standing over him. He glanced up, and instantly felt his breath hitch in his throat at the sight of the handsome stranger.
“There, much better,” Draco stammered, snapping himself out of his stupor and removing his thumb. “Thank goodness I’m here, or you’d look a mess. Then again, what’s new?”
“Shall we go out for lunch somewhere?” Potter suggested.
“Pansy and I are planning a holiday, and we’d like to invite you along. I think it would be good for you to get out of the house and enjoy some sun and relaxation.”
“Oh, we survived,” Draco said sharply. The truth was, sharing a bed with Harry had been more than pleasant. Waking up in the night to see Harry’s peaceful slumbering face had been nothing short of bliss, but that was for him to know and no one else to find out. “However, twin beds would have been far more preferable, as I’m sure you can understand.”
Draco felt a stab of jealousy as he looked at the photos. Potter looked so carefree and easy-going with his friends, smiling brightly from ear to ear. He had glimpsed for himself how stunning Potter’s smile was, and he’d only been graced with the sight a small number of times.
Petunia huffed and handed over some Italian coins to him, before leaving without another word. Harry had no idea how to get to the village, so he supposed he’d have to ask one of the Malfoys or one of their staff for directions. He wasn’t stupid enough to hitchhike alone in a foreign country, so he hoped the walk wouldn’t take too long.
When their food arrived, Draco could feel Potter’s gaze flickering to his haggis every so often.
“Why do you call me that?” Harry asked. Their mouths were mere inches away, and Harry wondered what it would be like to kiss Draco, there and then.
"No! No!" Harry cried. With what looked like a forced smile, Harry got up, abruptly enough that he spilt his drink. Draco hissed as his legs got splashed with the cold liquid. "You're my
“I really need a bell above my door,” he muttered, turning to face Draco who was leaning idly in the doorway. “I didn’t think you wanted to see my anymore.”
Dudley’s mouth fell open in shock, though the action appeared too forced to be natural. “You were only given one bed? I bet that must have been awful for you both.”
“Three hours it’s taken us to get to this point,” Draco grumbled, stepping on Harry’s foot as someone attempted to barge past them. Personally, Harry didn’t know why they even bothered, seeing as they were all packed into the narrow corridor like a tin of sardines.
Draco’s voice wiped away all images of Ron and Hermione, and replaced it with thoughts of Draco bending him over and pounding into him.
“Merlin, you’re dense,” Draco said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Yes, I like you very much, and my affections run deep for you. Please don’t make me say it again.”
For a moment, Draco thought he was still dreaming. There was no way that Harry could really be snuggled up with him in bed, but then he shifted his leg and winced as the beginnings of a cramp shot through his calf.
"There's the bossy you I know," Harry teased, as Draco pushed his thighs further apart so his fingers could reach his hole.
Rapid change of subject must be a Malfoy speciality. Harry went along with it anyway, to ignore the gnawing guilt he felt for
“Hello, kitty,” Harry murmured softly, crouching down and offering two fingers to the cat who eagerly rubbed its face against them. “You’re a pretty thing, aren’t you?”
“I assume your taste in music is questionable too,” Draco said, shooting Harry a smirk.
“Only so I wouldn’t have to be alone with Pansy and Ginevra; can you imagine
Draco’s hand left Harry’s back, and travelled round to the waistband of Harry’s shorts.
"Where's your coat?" he asked, eyes narrowing as if he was trying to decide whether Harry was stupid or just insane. "It's freezing out there!"
“Pansy said this place does great food,” Draco lied, studying his menu intently. He’d never heard of
He stood up gingerly and padded across the floor until he could press his ear against the door which adjoined their rooms. He’d been caught the last time he had done this, so Harry made sure to try and keep himself as still and silent as possible.
Normally Harry would have been fine with that, only Ava never actually read her books. Her eyes would glaze as they stared down at the page unmoving, idly flipping to the next page to keep up the pretence. Harry had faked reading enough in his own youth to appease Hermione to know the signs.
He had never flown before, but Harry found he quite enjoyed it. The jolt in his stomach when the plane had first left the ground at Gatwick had been thrilling, and looking down at the tiny world below had made him feel like he a god admiring his creation. It was truly a shame that humans weren’t able to fly unaided.
Harry sighed. “I’ll get us some coffee.”
“Very funny,” Harry said dryly, flicking the switch again to no avail, no matter how many times he pressed it.
So maybe not
"I'd really love your mouth around your cock right now," Draco said breathlessly as they broke apart from the kiss. "God, Harry, do you feel how hard I am for you?"
“I thought your wine bit was just pure snobbery, but you’re actually onto something,” Harry said. “I mean, it’s still snobby, but it’s actually meaningful.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, this time like a whine. “I want...but I can’t...Please, Draco, help me.”
“Can you let go of me now?”
He would be returning home the following afternoon, and it truly hurt that Draco had disappeared without a word to Harry. Harry had believed Draco’s excuses about having a migraine, and having to do his work, but now it just seemed like Draco was avoiding him altogether.
“I didn’t know that. I knew your godfather was, but…”
“Hey there, Sweetheart,” came a feminine voice from the doorway.
“I know,” Draco said softly. “You’re too much of a goody goody for that,” he added with a smirk.
Harry heard the shouting as the song ended, so he pressed pause on his walkman and turned to face his glaring aunt.
“Oh, you’re still here,” Potter said. “I’d expected you to have climbed out of the window and done a runner.”
"Are you ready to go?"
Draco’s blood ran cold, suddenly aware of what had shocked Harry so much.
a marathon in heels. Enjoy dinner without my company tonight; I’m sure my parents will bore you with some needless brag.”
Harry’s lips quirked. “Believe it or not, I don’t subscribe to
“No! Merlin, no!” Draco exclaimed, drawing looks from a couple of tables around them. He lowered his voice, and leaned in closer to Harry. Harry looked back at him, concern etched in his features. Nobody had ever really looked at him like that before, other than his parents. “I thought you needed to know...I’m transgender. I’m a trans man.”
Potter raised his own glass and clinked it against Draco’s. “Ditto.”
Harry found himself helplessly bucking against the desk, his prick desperate for attention despite Harry’s best efforts to ignore it.
It wasn’t that Pansy and Astoria made him feel like that, because they were more than supportive of him. It wasn’t even that he felt as undeserving of their kindness as he once had. No, now that he was actually working and had somehow made friends—good, honest, incredibly weird friends—with Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood, he still couldn’t even manage to survive on his own.
belong to.”
Draco felt instantly affronted at the stony welcome, and plastered on a sneer.
“So needy,” Draco tutted, slapping Harry’s arse. He took a moment to cast the spell which had Harry stretched and lubricated, before sliding two fingers inside him. Harry moaned at the touch, backing into Draco for me. “I love how your whole body is just begging for my cock. You’re so
“What about the peacocks? What were they for?”
Harry shook his head in amusement, and moved over to give Draco enough room to climb up onto their bed. Thankfully, magic made the bed much roomier than it was ever designed to be by Muggles, and sharing it hadn’t been as horrific as both of them had feared.
“What?” he asked them.
Harry shook his head. “Like mermaids, but humanoid and with the power to lure men to their deaths at sea by singing.”
Draco’s lips quirked. “Time off work means more time I’m left alone with my thoughts. Although you’ve proven to be a pretty good distraction. Just as an example, currently I’m thinking about whether I could push you into the crater and get away with it.”
Harry frowned. "Other realms? I didn't know there were any, besides the world of the living and the world of the dead."
"You simply need to think of a question as you move your hand over the deck, and choose the card you feel drawn to," Draco explained. "Of course this is the most simple of methods, but I'd be happy to show you all the ways you can use tarot cards some time, perhaps over a glass of wine at mine."
“Yeah, I really don’t think you need to be afraid of Potter rejecting you,” Blaise added. “And if he does turn out to be a transphobic piece of trash then we’ll hex him to within an inch of his life, won’t we, Pansy?”
“I’m not wasting my orgasm in your mouth,” Draco said, regretting now that he hadn’t thought to give himself a stamina potion. “Can I fuck you? You want that, I know it. Now you’ve had a taste, you can’t get enough.”
“I kind of did,” Potter said, holding his thumb and finger out in front of him, slightly spaced apart. “I’m glad you’re coming tonight, though; it should be fun.”
Harry shot a glance at Malfoy.
Harry flushed regardless. “I guess you’re growing on me. I haven’t wanted to jinx you for a good couple of days, at any rate.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “On anyone else I wouldn’t find this obliviousness endearing, yet on you I do. But yes, Potter, I meant as a date. Merlin knows why, but I’m very attracted to you and I don’t particularly want to wait another fifteen years to see you again before I can ask.”
“I have to-” Harry began, but Draco cut him off before he could finish.
Thus Harry had found himself staring at Draco’s crotch whenever he got the chance, both impressed and annoyed that Draco’s trousers were able to hide the beast that lay within them.
Blaise didn’t look offended, far used to Draco’s blunt opinions by now. In fact, Blaise only seemed amused by his response.
, it’s a group holiday, not a couple’s one. You’re not the first person we’ve asked, so you don’t have to worry about feeling like a third wheel. We’re going to tour Italy, starting in the south and travelling up north.”
"It has become apparent tonight that the seventh-year Ravenclaw, Miss Ava William, has gone missing," McGonagall said. Harry felt his blood turn to ice. "Her dorm-mates raised the alarm, and per protocol I had to get an Auror's statement before I could declare anything to you. The Aurors found nothing suspicious, and given Miss William's issues with anxiety and depression, they believe it is simply a case of a runaway teenager." McGonagall sniffed." I for one, feel confident Miss William has not crossed the school borders, unless she somehow managed to beat security designed to keep out the Darkest of wizards. But the Aurors insist on focusing their search outside of Hogwarts, which means I must ask if any of you are willing to search the castle. I know the winter holidays start tomorrow and you have families to go home to but—"
“Blaise and I are going into town for drinks tonight,” Draco said, leaning against the doorframe with an elegant grace. “Would you like to join us?”
Harry nodded, and Malfoy raised his wand towards the mirror. "
Potter was lowering the metal box into the water attached to a smaller device, which Potter held in his hands.
Petunia flattened her hair idly, and Vernon puffed out his chest.
“More,” Harry urged breathlessly. “Draco, more, please. I need it. Please, Draco, it hurts; I need more.”
“Malfoys don’t glare,” Draco scoffed. “Did you know that they were dating? Blaise and Potter, I mean.”
“Hmm, legends of the Chupacabra come from Puerto Rico, and that’s a place with good weather. I mean, tales of the Chupacabra have spread, but Puerto Rico is where it originates so that seems like the best place to try.”
"I do want this," Harry cut in. "I keep thinking about how it would feel having you buried inside me, and I don't want to wait anymore."
“Is that why you’re taller than me?” Harry asked with a grin. “If it is, you’re not allowed to mock me for my height anymore.”
Draco looked pleased. “Excellent. I look forward to it.”
“Fancy a dip?” Harry asked, grinning.
“Fuck off,” Draco snarled at his door, not in the mood to deal with anyone right now.
Harry frowned in confusion. “Have you, Dudley? What have you been doing?”
He Apparated back to his apartment, eager to get started on the bottle of wine that he had waiting for him. He had planned on saving it for something good, but it didn’t seem like good things would be coming his way anytime soon.
Harry smiled despite himself. “I can’t be irritating you too much, then, if you’re already inviting me on another holiday with you.”
“That’s excellent logic, Po-Harry,” Draco said with a smirk. “And I am very much in favour. Do you have a desk? If I remember correctly, Blaise said you had fantasies of me fucking you over one.”
"I didn't say I was one of those people. Merlin, you're sensitive, Potter. But as I was saying, most witches and wizards don't even believe in a realm for the dead, never mind any others. However they do exist, but the magic involved is considered very Dark and dangerous, so the Ministry encourages the ignorance."
“Yes, well, I’m not very good at it,” Harry huffed.
Harry groaned. “Can’t we just stop here?”
As had become custom, he fell into step beside Draco as Ginny and Pansy strode just ahead of them, Ginny guiding them by means of magically-self-directing map.
He was so desperate to get just another glimpse of Draco’s cock though, just to see if it was really as big as he remembered. Even just the outline of it through his trousers would be enough to satisfy Harry, and as a result he couldn’t stop looking at Draco’s crotch whenever he got the opportunity to do so.  He was pretty sure Draco had noticed, but Harry had been able to play it off as him being lost in a daydream. He wasn’t nearly as spacey as Draco liked to tease him about being, but it sure helped him in not getting called out as a pervert.
"Sorry," he said, hastily sliding into the space. The blush on his face grew as he realised it was Malfoy's lap he had half-landed in.
Potter gave him a small smile as his cheeks began to flush; he must be a lightweight when it came to alcohol.
“Who is this?” Harry asked sharply, his tone far more wary than Draco had heard it in a long while.
Even with that theory, Harry still couldn’t bring himself to be angry with Draco. Harry’s hurt was entirely rooted in sadness, and made his heart ache. The loss of Draco was heavy on his very soul, and he didn’t know how he’d fallen in love with Draco without realising.
"Boys!" They both jumped as a hand landed on each of their shoulders. "Am I going to have to separate you?"
“Sure,” he said, then grinned. “But you can come with me to the modern art museum afterwards.”
,” Draco continued as though Harry had never spoken. “Even if you can’t draw faces or trees, you can evoke a lot of emotion with colours and patterns. This is clever work, Potter, and you know I wouldn’t sugarcoat it if I thought your art was shit.”
"I did have a coat," Harry answered. "And a scarf and gloves, but there was a homeless man on the street with nothing but a ratty blanket, and I couldn't just walk by and let him freeze to death."
"I'm just looking for research," Ava hissed. "I thought you teachers were supposed to support us studying for the exams."
“So there’s absolutely no valid proof, and only reported sightings without anything to back them up?” Draco clarified. “I wish you luck in your hunt, Potter. Can you swim? Perhaps you ought to get into the water and have a good look yourself.”
“I orgasm just fine on my own, thank you,” Draco said coldly. “Now alcohol, on the other hand, sounds like it would be a blessing. Fuck off downstairs so I can change, unless you’re a bigger pervert than I thought you were.”
“Nine inches,” Harry answered, his own prick twitching at the memory of that night. The bloke who’d gifted him with that experience turned out to have an even bigger dick in his personality, but it had been the best sex of his life.
Harry rolled his eyes affectionately. "I asked if you wanted to grab a drink later. Seems like you could do with one.
"I tried as hard as I could to make it painless, but there'll still be a sting."
to have a hard body beneath his. He rested his hands against Draco’s chest, breathing in deeply as he felt the study thrum of Draco’s heartbeat against his fingers.
“Talking from experience there, Potter?” Draco grinned wickedly back. “And no, I scarcely have time to relax after work, less make a fool out of myself.”
“I’ll have to take you to the Malfoy vineyard in France sometime, and show you the best wine in the world. Italian wines are impressive, yes, but they’re nothing compared to the French.”
Dudley feigned a look of innocence. “Who, me?”
Then Harry opened the door to their room, and his heart dropped into his stomach.
"A dangerous mirror, yes, but it's so much more than that," Dumbledore said. "Of course these are only rumours, but it is said that some witches and wizards who've been driven insane by longing in the Mirror of Erised ending up disappearing, and many believe they went inside of the mirror. Of course nobody has ever managed to confirm this theory, leading me to believe travel inside the mirror is far easier than getting out."
He plonked down onto the first empty space he came across, his eagerness to sit down causing him to overshoot and land half on someone's thigh.
Even as he moved amongst the pretty dolls, handsome soldiers, wild dragons, and sleek trains, Harry could barely focus on the toys. He could appreciate the beauty in their detail, and the hard work that clearly went into every single one, but it was hard to concentrate on them while he could feel Malfoy’s eyes intently focused on him.
“What? Why?” he demanded. “I’ve never had a day off, never been late—”
“Yeah,” Harry retorted, stepping up on the front doorstep so that his face was level with Draco’s. “But this gives me one last chance to kiss you until I see you again.”
"Touche." Draco closed his book and tossed it idly onto the floor, before turning onto his side. He leered down at Harry. "But all those sidekicks and goons are gone for now, which means I can ravish you all I like."
“Fucking Italian drivers!” Ginny shouted below them. “This bloody thing’s doing the speed limit.”
about Muggle magic, and all the myths and legends that come with it. It won’t be long until he’s in, and then he’ll be able to tell you more about it and what he needs your assistance with. Does that sound good to you?”
It was Draco’s turn to shiver.
“So, what do you think we should look for next?” Potter asked, ignoring Draco’s last comment. “If you decide now we can get Dudders to organise the trip while I write the article on Nessie.”
But Draco yearned for more than friendship. Admittedly, while the idea of dating, holding hands, and all that cutesy stuff was well and good, he mainly just wanted Harry in bed keeping Draco's cock warm, and keeping Harry happy was a way of making him more receptive to Draco's advances. Harry certainly didn't have a problem flirting with Draco, but he'd yet to advance beyond that, and it was frustrating to both Draco's mind and prick.
"Draco!"
“Nice love bite you have there,” Ginny said with a grin, and Harry slapped his hand to his neck in alarm.
He smirked, but Harry could tell that both that and the insult had been forced.
But the mystery of whether Harry’s fantasy creatures actually existed, would always remain
And for the first time in a long while, Harry cried himself to sleep.
He bit his lip to stop himself crying out as he felt the pressure building. When Draco’s mouth began to caress Harry’s neck again, Harry couldn’t stop himself. He bucked his hips as he came, fucking into Draco’s fist until he was entirely spent.
It was Draco’s turn to be confused. “But you were hanging all over each other, and you called him
As much as Harry loved Ginny, even he wouldn’t want to be left alone with just the two of them. Pansy, he imagined, would treat Harry as some kind of dress-up doll.
“We’re going to get them, Sweetheart.There’s no use to have a sulk over it.”
Harry flushed, wishing harder than ever that he wasn’t in such a tightly confined space with Draco. While Draco called Robards for back-up, Harry desperately tried to will away his lustful thoughts, but having Draco’s warm body inches away from his was only increasing his desire.
That caught the clerk's attention, and he finally looked up with a striking grey gaze.
Harry grinned, but it quickly turned to a grimace as someone jostled him from behind. “If we both get sent to Azkaban at the same time, do you think we’ll get cells next to each other?”
“I can’t let you go back and waste your life with those awful cretins for call relatives. You’re so talented, and you deserve to have the world. I can give you that, Harry, if you stay with me. I know I’m being selfish wanting you to stay, but I also know how much better your life will be if you do.”
"I won't. I just wanted to see how you looked in women's clothing, and I know now you look
Draco shook his head. “No, Pansy just said there was a group of us going and that I wouldn’t be a third wheel.”
“Good for you,” Harry grumbled, wiping water off his face. “Why does that need you to wake me up so rudely?”
Smiling pointedly at Parvati Patil, the current Divination teacher and his table neighbour, Harry made his way over to the professor's table without a second glance over at the left side. He was in the midst of polite conversation with Parvati when a man cleared his throat behind him.
“You should meet Andromeda sometime,” Harry said. “She looks almost the spitting image of Bellatrix, only without the murderous gleam in her eyes. She’s lovely, too; I bet she would love to have you over.”
“I heard this was the best place to buy wooden toys,” Harry said, all too aware of the fixated gaze that Malfoy had on him. “I need to get something for my godson; he’s five.”
“Yeah, but I am. So I’ll ask you again; what are you doing?”
Draco wasn’t supposed to be at work, admittedly. He’d simply grown bored of sitting around, and decided he might as well go and bother Harry for something to do. Maybe he’d even flirt a little, or maybe not. He still couldn’t decide what he wanted to do, and the conflicting feelings had been keeping him up at night.
Draco shot him a wicked grin. “No, I imagine he’ll go along with the deal because your uncle is cheap. Only my father will knock the offer down even further, and try and rip him off more along the way. He didn’t get so rich by playing kindly with others. You play guitar very well.”
It was Harry's turn to pull a face. "But the floor there is sticky, and I find glitter
He waved the back of his hand towards Draco, showing him the
Dobby was loading their luggage into the boot of the car, while Petunia and Vernon tutted and tapped their feet impatiently, while refusing to lift a finger to help.
"Malfoy? What's going on?"
"That's because--ahh--because you're teasing me so much," Harry stammered, fisting his fingers in his bed covers as Draco's fingers danced across his prostate.
“People like you, you mean?” Potter quipped. “If believing there’s magic everywhere makes me insane, then so be it. I really hope we find concrete proof of Nessie, and then maybe you can join me in my eccentric camp.”
“Fuck yes,” Draco ground out breathlessly, his eyes falling shut momentarily as Harry lowered the final barrier between them.
Harry looked at Draco before answering. “Greece. We’re going to look for sirens.”
“Buonasera, bellissimo,” a voice said beside Harry. Harry looked to see an admittedly attractive man, with tan skin, deep chocolate eyes, and an athletic figure.
He jumped when a loud knock sounded on his door.
Harry smiled. "You have me now."
Harry felt his face flush, and had to fight the urge not to lie and say he had in fact allowed Ava to browse the restricted section in the dead of night.
He closed the gap between them, his lips meeting Draco’s at last. He kissed him slowly, tentatively, tasting Draco’s sweetness with his tongue. Draco allowed Harry to explore for a few moments before he began kissing back with fierceness, gnawing at Harry’s lower lip. Harry gasped, allowing Draco’s tongue to enter his mouth.
“I don’t know-” Harry began, but Ginny cut him off before he could finish.
Unfortunately, he kept glancing over at Potter, with his flushed cheeks, and his eyes lit up with joy. Each time he did, he was reminded of just how damn cute Potter was being. It was selfish of him, really, and it was his fault that Draco couldn’t keep his eyes away.
“Yet we’re enjoying a perfectly civil coffee together,” Harry pointed out, raising a brow.
“Huh?” Harry’s gaze instinctively jumped to Draco’s crotch, before he remembered his manners and forced his eyes to meet Dracos’ steely grey ones.
"I've wanted this for so long," Malfoy breathed against Harry's lips.
As soon as Harry got the key he gestured for Draco to follow him, taking him into a lift that only went up or down—a very basic version of the ones at the Ministry of Magic.
“Never become an actor, Potter,” came Draco’s voice. “I know you’re awake.”
He did a little bit of swimming, not wanting to venture too far into the lake, before turning onto his back and floating on top of the water. Draco came up beside him, mimicking Harry’s position. His hair was damp and sticking to his face, and he raised a wet hand to brush it away. In doing so water dripped down his face, and Harry’s gaze followed it down sharp cheekbones to rosy red lips.
Draco didn’t offer his hand, but Harry clambered to his feet anyway so that he didn’t appear rude. He barely came up to Draco’s shoulder, and Harry didn’t consider himself short by any means.
“I can tell you’re nervous, but you look eager too,” Malfoy said, sounding faintly amused. “I think I know what your answer is going to be, but I’ll let you find it out for yourself.”
Unlike Harry, Draco wasn't a virgin, but he'd been nothing but supportive of Harry's desire to wait. Part of Harry was embarrassed of doing something wrong, but the more they kissed and touched one another the more Harry wanted to jump right in and do it regardless of his nerves. And with the rest of their year-group out of the picture for the time being, it was the perfect time to go for it.
Pansy lived in London in a posh townhouse that the Ministry hadn’t known about when they seized the rest of the Parkinson properties. The Malfoys weren’t as lucky and were left with nothing.
Harry’s mouth went dry, not sure he had heard Draco correctly. He opened his mouth to speak, and only a squeak came out. Draco’s smirk deepened.
Draco grinned devilishly. “Yeah, let’s go back to mine.”
Draco and Narcissa quirked their brows, no doubt remembering that Harry had announced himself self-taught just a couple of night’s prior. Vernon, as custom, clearly hadn’t listened to Harry that night.
The fantasy was so cringe-worthy that Draco inwardly winced.
Harry was so fixated on the hungry look in Draco’s eyes that he jumped when something heavy hit his desk with a thud. He looked down, finding a bulging file with bits of parchment haphazardly sticking out of the sides.
"Turns out the older students are just as bratty here as they are in France," Malfoy muttered. "Should have known you'd try and be the friendly teacher that everyone loves."
“Great, thanks,” Harry said, and hurried off to find Dobby.
. His ice white hair was styled impeccably, coiffed on top and framing the sharp, sleek lines of his face. His tall frame was clad in a form fitting black jumper and skin-tight black jeans which clung to shapely thighs. Harry bit his lip, his stomach twisting at the sight in that confusing way which he’d grown accustomed to.
Harry sucked cock like was was born to do it, working Draco’s length expertly. There was no apprehension or tentativeness, just urgent, frantic movements of Harry’s mouth up and down, like Draco’s cock was the only thing to satisfy his craving.
Potter smiled, making Draco’s stomach flip over. Before he went out for dinner, he’d have to go home and have a sulk over the way Potter made him feel. And then maybe a wank—yes, that sounded good.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Draco said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco retreated to their shared bathroom, but didn’t shut the door behind him. The sight of Draco’s firm arse as he took off his pyjama bottoms was certainly enough to put Harry in a better mood. Although he was still in no hurry to move, at least not until Draco had pulled his swimming briefs.
“It doesn’t even taste bad, it’s just the
The touch went straight to Draco’s prick, the memory of Harry’s fingers around it the night before still vivid in his mind.
Harry couldn’t contain the shiver that ran through him.
There was a lot of flour on the counter, with a well in the centre which Dobby was cracking eggs into--cracking them with one hand, Harry noticed with impressiveness.
Narcissa wasn’t fazed. “It’s about time he settle down. Draco’s invested so much energy into his research that he’s neglected his own happiness in other regards. Still, what would I know? I’m only his mother. Mm, dinner smells delicious, Dobby. Perhaps after we’ve eaten you could play guitar for us, Harry?”
Harry had gone to fill Robards in on what had happened, and grabbed a quick chat with Ron at the water cooler, before returning to the office he shared with Draco, comfortably under the impression that he had given Draco plenty of time to get changed.
“Where’s the fun in that?” Ginny pretended to pout. “But really, Harry, I’m sure you two have a future outside of Italy. Malfoy is a workaholic, but I’m sure you’d be able to tear him away from that office of his. And it will give you an opportunity to get out of the house, too! That’s what Pansy and I wanted for you both.”
Draco laughed out loud, the sound turning into a moan when Harry sucked on a particularly sensitive spot.
Ginny stood in the doorway looking rather amused, and Harry shot her a sheepish grin as he put the Weird Sisters on pause.
Draco made a noise of agreement, and gestured towards Harry’s sketchpad. “Can I look?”
Draco decided he rather liked it when Harry called him by his given name. It would probably sound even better being called out in bed.
“Merlin, you two!” came Blaise’s voice, who’d reappeared with a smirking Daphne hanging onto his side. How Blaise moved so fast, Draco didn’t know. “Draco, everyone who knows you knows that you have a thing for Harry, and Harry has a thing for you too! It’s hard to be a matchmaker when I’m dealing with such an oblivious and awkward pair!”
“What would your office look like if you were based off your mind, then?” Potter retorted. “Lots of stormy clouds I imagine.”
“So what’s this news you have for me?” Draco asked sharply. “Are you engaged or knocked up? No offence, but I’m really not in the mood to hear about other people’s good fortune when my own life has gone to shit.”
Not that he believed that a demon was in the house, of course. Poltergeists could do all the things that they’d experienced so far, and poltergeists were known for being mischievous. Whatever spirit they were dealing with seemed more annoying than anything else.
Harry huffed but fell silent, and Draco strained his ears. Leaves from the nearby woodland were rustling, and a low, guttural sort of growling noise could just be heard.
“Please do, but take the food off the heat before you do, for Ginevra’s sake. Well, Harry, shall we?”
“Oh, I’m sure it will be,” Draco said. “The Sistine Chapel is famous, even in our world. I just didn’t realise it came with the temptation to do something worthy of Azkaban before we get inside.”
Harry had fingered himself before, so the sensation itself wasn’t too strange, but Draco’s fingers were longer than his, and pushed deeper inside him than Harry could ever hope to reach. A second finger slid inside him the other side of Draco’s tongue, just the tip of it, and he used them to hold Harry open as he moved his tongue as deep as he could inside Harry.
Some kind of fake birds squawked as he opened the door into what at first appeared to be a rainforest, with large, lush green leaves hanging from the ceiling and around the entryway. To the right of the reception area was a stone fountain with water trickling down into a pool. It was filled with unusual fish, some of which were vibrant pink or purple, while others had wings, and Draco even spied one which had three eyes.
Harry’s fingers trembled in excitement as he lowered his shorts down his thighs. Draco started to stroke Harry then, his pace almost torturously slow. Harry was glad for it though, as he was already close and it would have been embarrassing to come almost instantly.
“Draco, please...I can’t stand it. I need your cock in me. I need it so badly.
That was definitely true.
“No?” Harry asked, hoping he didn’t look too pleased when Draco moved to take the seat beside him.
“You’re so gorgeous,” Harry murmured softly. “I can’t believe you actually wanted to kiss me.”
Dobby stifled a snort of laughter.
Harry shuffled awkwardly past the row of teachers, trying his best not to trip over anyone's feet and fall into their lap.
He didn’t know what he had to expect making such a decision on a whim, but with Draco by his side, it could only be a good thing.
“Sorry, Aunt Petunia, I had headphones in,” Harry said, pulling them out of his ears so Petunia would be able to see.
“Fine. And my name’s Harry, you know.”
a weirdo, but somehow that makes me care for him even more.”
, and Luna ‘graciously’ thought it would be nice for Draco to do all of his assistant duties from home. And because Draco was a diligent worker, he’d ended up finishing all his jobs within three days and had found himself with nothing to do.
Ginny looked like she was on Draco’s side, but clearly wasn’t to fight with Pansy over it, so Draco turned to Harry instead.
The large, high-ceilinged nightclub Blaise had commandeered for the event was bathed in bright coloured lights which danced through the otherwise dark room. A mass of writhing bodies danced together in the lowered center of the room, waving their arms above their heads to the sound of guttural, industrial music.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “You wanted us happy, or you wanted us together?”
Draco left to fetch Harry the pain relieving potion. As his reached for the vial in his potions storage room, his eyes fell on the potion he’d concocted for tonight. There was still some left, enough for another dose, Draco reasoned.
The weather was too hot for Harry to be able to concentrate on the pages properly, though, and he felt his eyes glazing over. He sighed again and closed his eyes, allowing himself to just
“I don’t know about Greek wine, but they make good ouzo, too. I got us a bottle when we stopped at that store.”
Currently he was sat with Ginny, who kept shooting him amused and smug looks. Pansy and Draco had gone to some high-end fashion shops, which Ginny and Harry had precisely zero interest in between them. It was nice to spend time with just Ginny, though, even if she kept giving him those strange looks.
“They’re supposed to be! It’s exciting to be able to escape from the real world and lose yourself in a world of magic and wonder. Oh, what are you reading then?”
“It’s alright.” Draco shrugged, and shot Blaise a smirk. “A little raunchy for my tastes, but I suppose it’s not
? Did you just say we’ll sleep in it? Potter! Potter!””
Draco squeezed Harry's thigh. "Have you ever thought about us maybe being
Harry’s cock twitched at Draco’s words and send a jolt of thrill through his stomach. He wanted more of Draco’s praise.
Harry grinned. “They’re definitely not.”
Draco, it seemed, had similar ideas, as he pulled at Harry’s hair with a reluctant groan.
“I was born in France to a French-English family, lived between France, Britain, Italy, Russia, and Hong Kong as a child, but settled in Britain as a teenager when I was sent to boarding school.”
Harry had dusky pink nipples, and a trail of dark hair leading down from his belly button into the waistband of his swimming trunks. Draco wanted to lick every inch of him, and he could barely think about anything else. He was trying to read, but his gaze kept leaving the page to roam over Harry’s body.
“What?”
Harry’s lips went dry, and he darted his tongue out to wet them. “What do you want to do to me, then?”
"What's so good about this mirror?" Malfoy asked, pushing past Harry to look into the glass. "Is it enchanted or something? All I can see in it is me and you."
He opened the door to his room, freezing as the object of his desires appeared right in front of him. Malfoy froze too, his fist still raised from where he was about to knock on Harry's door.
Harry was drawn out of his reverie when Draco stopped playing at once, and for a moment Harry thought he must have been off-key as a result of focusing on Draco too much. Draco wasn’t looking at Harry though, and was instead sat as still as a marble statue at the piano, fingers still hovering over the keys.
Draco couldn’t quite believe what was happening. He was keeping his own touch as light as possible on the planchette because he’d wanted to prove a point, but he trusted that Harry wasn’t messing with him—his reactions were far too natural.
Harry tilted his head, confused at the reason for the question.
Malfoy followed Harry's gaze. "Wise choice. I'm sure she shouldn't be treating us like her students now we're professors."
Luna and Potter both seemed rather disorganised, or at least existed in some kind of organised chaos that only made sense to them, so Draco wasn’t surprised he hadn’t been told much more than to pack for Scottish weather. The least effort Draco had to put into this hunt for make-believe creatures, the better.
“You can’t be good at everything, though you may think otherwise looking at me.”
“Rude,” Blaise muttered. “Wait, did you think Harry and I were...oh, Draco. I would never touch the boy you’ve been obsessed with for years. I’m a good friend like that, you see, and an excellent matchmaker. So when I found out Harry wanted you to bend him over a table and fuck him senseless, I knew I’d have to find a way to actually get you both together.”
“Hey,” Harry said, turning his attention back to his book.
’ on it.
“So very open-minded of you,” Harry said, shaking his head in exasperation. “Oh, do you hear that?”
"I thought a good boyfriend would accept Harry's friends and play fairly with them," Ron pointed out, looking at Harry and Draco with eyebrows raised. While Ron had been completely supportive when Harry had come out as bisexual, he hadn't been so happy when he and Draco started dating. But now Ron and Draco could manage a somewhat friendly conversation.
“Same could be said for other things too, not just prison,” Draco said. “University, for example, or holidays. Oh, we’re being allowed in.”
Draco didn't know what the future would bring, and all he could ask to whoever was listening, was to never take Harry away from him; he didn't think his heart could take it. Now he knew love, he didn't want to lose it.
“Fuck, Harry, of course not!” Draco cried, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I just...God, normally I’m a selfish lover so I’ve never had this problem before. It’s just that I don’t want to take advantage of you, or pressure you into something you’re not quite ready for. I keep thinking you’ll go home, meet someone your own age, and regret having your first time with an older man.”
He knocked on the door, waiting only a few short seconds before Pansy answered, looking surprised to see him.
It looked like Harry was going to Italy.
A few seconds later a door clicked--probably Blaise leaving--and then the handle of the door Harry was leaning against began to rattle.
Not that Potter needed any favours; he hadn’t been placed in the top three of  Witch Weekly’s Hottest Bachelors list the last five years for no reason. His personality had vastly improved too, as far as Draco could tell. They didn’t travel in the same circles, but they occasionally ran into one another at the Ministry and an unspoken agreement between them had formed to be socially polite to one another.
He watched as Harry spoke to the receptionist, amused by the fact that to him, Harry was speaking in English and the receptionist in Spanish, yet the two of them were conversing easily. Draco also couldn’t help but notice the delicious curve of Harry’s arse as he leaned slightly over the counter, displaying his pert bum as if just for Draco.
Harry looked back at his scowling aunt and uncle, then back at Draco’s beaming, hopeful face, and the terracotta villa behind him which gleamed in the sunlight.
"Hello?" Ava's voice called back. "Is someone there?"
Harry could have never imagined being so happy or free, but Draco--stubborn, arrogant, snobby Draco--had brought such glorious light to Harry’s life.
“You should, it’s good for the soul.” Luna gave him a serene smile, her wide, silvery eyes looking at him intently. “As I’m sure Daphne told you, we’re taking you on as an assistant journalist. Not to me, because Dudley helps me with that, but with our other writer. He’s working on a new section of
, and Draco was nothing if not a good potions master. So let Harry get groped in the bathroom tonight, or whatever he had wandered off to do. In only a few short days, Harry would be his.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him. He admired every line of Draco’s body; the sharp bones in his cheek, the pointed chin, the long, elegant fingers. Draco was so refinidely cut, all over sleek. He was the perfect image of the handsome, rich, aristocrat.
His good mood was probably also because Pansy had also treated them to a trip to a spa in the Spanish Walls of Milan. Harry had come out feeling more refreshed and peaceful than he had ever done in his life, and questioned why he’d never gone to a spa before.
When he’d left the campervan for a walk, Pansy had just been starting on dinner. Now he’d returned, and it was to the tangy smell of burned food and an odd mix of spices which really didn’t blend well together.
“We were both touch-starved as children so we don’t mind getting each other a little handsy with each other,” Potter said, shrugging. “And his grandmother calls Blaise ‘bambino’ and he found it embarrassing that I overhead, so naturally I like to call him that frequently. Plus he’s been helping me try to get some action going for myself.”
"You can add a second finger," he advised, now he'd got used to the sensation. Draco had been overly generous with lube so the single finger was barely noticeable, but as the second one pressed in he could feel the slightest hint of a burn around his rim.
Harry tried to strip as quickly as he could, which was difficult with how much his fingers were trembling. Draco's hand closed over one of his, trapping it against the bed.
Harry followed Ginny out of the attic and down two flights of stairs to the kitchen. He washed his hands and face in the sink while Ginny clattered about in the pantry, and by the time he sat down, a plate filled with peanut butter and jam sandwiches were waiting.
Harry couldn’t believe he was so deeply in love with such a prick, but love him he did.
the same direction as Draco’s.
“Wow, you’re horrible at flirting,” Draco said bluntly, even though his heart was beating a million miles an hour in his chest. “It’s a good job I like you regardless.”
Harry had been so frantic packing things up at the office that he hadn’t even excitedly talked about why they were coming. The frenzied intensity of his packing had concerned Draco somewhat, and more concerning if they had only come to see a spirit of a little girl in a Muggle house.
Hot tears stung at Draco’s eyes, and he angrily swiped them away before they could fall. He’d been lucky to find that job, and he doubted he was going to find another one anytime soon. Nobody wanted to hire an ex-Death Eater. Even down Knockturn Alley, they would refuse him, but that was not because they had anything against associates of the Dark Lord. Rather, a Death Eater employee meant the Ministry was more likely to be keeping an eye on them.
