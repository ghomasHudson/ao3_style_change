Harry held up his hands and bit back a grin. “I haven’t even said yes, ‘Mione!” When she turned back to the book, he mouthed to Ron ‘Not right now’. He nodded, sighed and turned back to the book.
While Severus was quiet, Draco frowned, trying to find out what in Merlin’s name was going on! Finally, his godfather decided to speak up: “Well, if you’re concerned about getting a name…” He hesitated, before getting up and walking over to his bookshelf, grabbing a few papers. “I was thinking about giving you a name back. I know the Snapes aren’t as pureblood as the Malfoys and that the amount of money will probably never be the same again, but…”
Harry froze as he looked towards the person walking towards them. Minerva McGonagall?! That was Draco’s idea of help? He wasn’t ready to tell her what had happened. Even the thought of having to tell Neville and another Auror in front of her what happened in order to press charges was making him puke.
Potter snorted and shook his head. There was a smirk on his lips which Draco liked a little bit, even though he tried not to get too much attached to anything. Not after everything had been ripped away from him. After the Ministry was done with the Malfoys, the only thing he had left was quite literally the clothes he had on that day and his name. If it hadn’t been for the kindness of strangers and acquaintances, he would have never even been able to come back to Hogwarts to finish his education, he was sure. He was also sure that one of these acquaintances was none other than Harry Potter even though the man himself had never openly confirmed that he had spoken at their trial to all witches and wizards and was pretty much the only thing keeping him from Azkaban. Well, at least these were the rumors.
“Yeah” Draco said and watched as Harry climbed off of him and sat back down with crossed legs next to his body. Harry could feel his intensive stare on him as he settled back down on the covers of the bed.
“About a decade” Harry gave a one-sided smirk, before he started to laugh from all these surprised expressions. Not even Neville knew that they had been married for so long. Blaise seemed to have guessed something like that or Draco had actually told him the truth, whatever it was, he smirked as he grabbed some bacon and winked at Harry.
Draco carefully placed his hand on Harry’s cheek. Harry smiled and was sure that Draco would say another love confession, when he only shrugged. “Well, I can’t move anyway.”
The Healer chuckled softly. “Well, congratulations then – a little late. You too still seem so in love.”
As if this hadn’t been enough, Harry had apparently decided to add insult to injury: “At least Draco listens to me when I tell him I have a nightmare and I want someone to talk me through it.”
Harry laughed and shook his head. He handed Draco the last cup and cleaned the sink. “You’re still a Slytherin, my darling.”
“So what do you do now?” Neville asked Harry. “Do you already have a room with the Slytherins? If not, I would feel no shame in hosting you in our old room for a night! You know nostalgia and stuff like that!”
“Pansy still gets her childhood summer home back. Everybody needs a little bit of happiness in their life.”
“You better hope next time you’re cheating on me there’s not an actual bomb hiding under the bed or under a chair, because if you do…!” He left the sentence unfinished, just as a threat and almost giggled over how much venom was in his voice, how much hatred seemed to slip out of his body. If he hadn’t known how utterly and deeply in love he was with this Slytherin, he would have been scared himself that he really did feel something bad towards him.
Alamar smirked. “They’re all terrible. The second rumour was that they both fell in love with the same man and tried to fight over who could keep him. Even once the man had died.”
Before he could continue, Draco turned to McGonagall. There was something far more important that he needed to discuss than whatever it was, the Aurors needed to know. “Headmistress, where’s Harry?” He should have been with Ginny, but the Gryffindor was now here and there was no sight of his ward...
Chuckling, Draco got up, went over to the TV he had hidden in the corner and placed his favorite movie in there. When he turned around, Harry held a bowl of popcorn up. “I figured you’d want to watch your favorite movie, so I brought snacks.”
Pansy narrowed her eyes in thought. “What do you want to do in the future? I mean, don’t you want to move in with your Gryffindor friends?”
Draco looked at him very concerned, though still followed him through the hallways, as the guard brought him to the apparition spot. The air was ice cold and from the looks of the terrified prisoners and young guards, the Dementors had probably just passed here. Harry would have liked to felt a little pity for them, though he really couldn’t master any feelings right now.
Sighing, Harry lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. “Did you not see how I… enjoyed harming Narcissa? I looked like a maniac!”
Draco was too deep in his reading. He had studied some very ancient texts and the language there took him at least an hour to get used to. He had come across an ancient spell that seemed right at first, however, the more he read about this weird curse, the less sense it made. He was sure that this curse was either completely made up or long forgotten. Even if some pureblood with a long line of purebloods and a crazy family library had had access to this book and this curse… it would make no sense to pick it.
Hermione chuckled. She motioned over to Charlie, who was playing with some children next to the Christmas tree. “I know for a fact that Charlie has created a highly sought-after event for dragon interested and other magical creatures. He offered Ron a few tickets, but we’re not really...” she shrugged her shoulders. “The children would probably either run after the dragons or have nightmares for weeks.”
Turning back to his husband, he entered the kitchen again. Eric had already cleaned up everything and shrunken all their possessions down to place them into their small travel bag. The only things lying on the floor were a few smaller knives, Eric’s magical bow and arrows and Alamar’s vampire protection.
The honeymoon is taking longer than expected. Neville decided those two weeks weren’t enough and we’re going to visit a few of his family in France. Which I can do as well, so we’re gone for another two weeks as least. And we're also visiting Mil! I've just heard that she's engaged and I just want to see that man! Apparently, he's from Morroco, I'll tell you more once I've met him.
Draco sighed and closed the book. He needed a break of this: it was all just so disheartening. Harry was really going to die, wasn’t he?
“We do, yes” Harry rolled his eyes. “He was in Azkaban for a month. Though, I don’t really know how it’s changed him, since I had to kind of deal with my own shit after the curse.”
“These two have been good friends ever since Sirius had first come here” she pointed to Potter and the other man. “His name is Lucas Kelly by the way. You shouldn’t be scared that something was going on between the two of them.”
Before Draco could make himself known, someone knocked at the door and Potter opened it, cold air rushing the warm pub. He stepped back wordlessly and an older man entered. He looked at Potter closely and sighed.
“Oh my god, Draco! Stop it with these stupid jokes!” Harry – overly dramatic – rolled his eyes again and stood up.
Smiling at Draco, Harry walked out of the door and forced Lucius with him, even though he clearly didn’t want to go. Draco smirked and closed the door, picking up their daughter again.
Severus chuckled. “I don’t think in the past eight years I’ve ever heard you say that. So formal”, he stated, though his eyes were sparkling. “In that case, good evening Mr. Snape, Miss Parkinson. Would you like to join us this evening?”
Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “Vanessa might be able to help. Maybe if she tells the matchmaker that she has a desperate friend – which let’s face it, you are – the company might want to help. And I also have a lot of influence, you know.” She smirked, while Jason rolled his eyes, though pressed a kiss on her cheek.
Slightly trembling, he turned to look at Draco and found the truest, softest eyes he had ever seen. “I…” Harry couldn’t find any words.
Potter held out a hand to stop him from talking. “Don’t worry you’re pretty arse off, mate. You can stay here until you know where you want to go next. Maybe I’ll ask you for help sometime, but don’t expect me to make you do everything around here.”
The old addition of the newspaper where Eric had written their address was hidden in Minerva’s desk. Grabbing the paper, Minerva transfigured her necklace into the original form of the decoder and quickly wrote the address. And with a whistle, her dark brown owl appeared at her window and she gave him a treat as an apology for what she was going to ask of him. Flying to Russia was probably going to take a few days.
Potter grabbed his waist and pulled him closer. “I wouldn’t say that” he whispered and kissed him, which in the end did wipe the smug grin off Draco’s face.
Harry placed his hand in his husband’s and they silently walked the rest to the entrance, where Padfoot started running around in the moonlight. When his dog was playing so wildly, Harry usually wondered whether or not he could have been a werewolf-dog. He was never so wild during a normal moon, only started going wild during a full moon.
“I...” Harry looked at Neville for a second, before he smirked. “Absolutely. How about drinks in the Leaky on Wednesday?”
Not even half an hour in and Draco had carefully added some dried Unicorn blood, when a loud noise – sounding almost ten times worse than when a house elf would appear – made everyone look back and see Finnegan staring at his potion. In the dim light of the dungeon’s light source, the Gryffindor looked as if he had seen a ghost for the first time in his life.
Draco chuckled as quietly as he could, turned back to his cauldron and started adding the Thestral hair one by one. He caught Pansy walking over to Theodore and asking somewhat loudly for another Thestral hair, since she apparently ‘hadn’t gotten one’.
All three men (well, two men and a baby) were quietly working on their projects and at the end of the lesson, Draco had successfully finished three potions, while Severus was probably already half done with his essays and Potter… he had productively mixed different colored water and showed Severus his now dark grey mix.
Nodding, Harry turned away. “If you need me, I’ll be available on my phone. Just give me an hour or two.” He walked out to see Maria giving him a sad look. She also seemed to know more than he wanted her to know. She was like a mother to him and to see her like this somehow really hurt him. Much more than the thought of having to deal with Malfoy again.
When they saw the little family, Hermione smiled sheepishly. “We won't be here for long, sorry for the intrusion.”
During these last eleven years, he had never ever slept alone. The four nights were Draco had to work on emergencies or just something had come up and he wasn’t able to make it home, Harry had stayed awake until the morning sun. When Draco finally returned and fell to bed – next to Harry.
He walked through the halls, when a constant picking at the window, made him stop and look at it. There was a black owl sitting at the window, looking at him rather expectantly. And he quickly also realized what was going on with this owl. It was his mother’s owl.
Shaking his head, he smiled weakly. “I will absolutely not think that having Severus as my dad is a bad thing! You’ve met my actual… former parents. Severus is a huge improvement!”
“I don’t like this at all” Harry commented right when a man walked out of the living room. He widened his eyes: This could have been him! He had the same dark curly hair, his facial features were there and even the way he walked seemed similar. The man was a little taller, though, and he didn’t have glasses.
“Oh, but I do!” Draco called, bursting out laughing. He pressed a kiss on Harry’s temple. “Now go, love. Get Olaf and let’s finish this circus on a high, before we end this charade once and for all.”
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “Frankly, I have no idea. You seemed to be in need of some…thing. So, I’ve decided to stay here for a bit.”
Hermione, whose baby bump was only slightly bigger than Draco’s, found little Willow pretty quickly and she crossed the room to sit down as close to Harry as possible. “She’s so cute! I’ve seen her so many times, but I can’t get enough of her!”
As she looked at them, Draco shrugged his shoulders and grinned, looking up at Harry who also couldn’t keep his expressions under control. It would have surprised him, if she hadn’t been confused. Getting such a letter and then coming to such a session and finding the two people who were supposed to hate each other in such a close embrace – Draco was almost sitting on Harry’s lap; he was so close snuggled into his side and his feet were up on the couch.
Luckily, nobody thought of looking at Draco, as everyone turned to their walking encyclopedia, and Theodore sighed. “I don’t know very much about it, my family was never intentionally into Dark Arts. I just know that a Horcrux is a dark object where the wizard casting the spell hides a part of their soul to stay or become immortal.”
Draco rolled his eyes, as he turned to Neville’s wife. “Hannah, please. Don’t buy everything he’s telling you. There is no strawberry inside and nothing close to berries. It’s wine for Merlin’s sake!”
“Tea, actually. From Hermione. I figured she’d more than likely not agree with throwing Amortentia into my food.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair and looked at Ginny, who only shrugged her shoulders. He was sure that she wanted him to tell them about what was going on. So he sighed and leaned back.
There, baby Potter was enjoying the early snow with Pansy (who had been in the Common Room faster and already gotten Potter from Lovegood’s care) and while the witch was forming snowballs, Potter threw them at Theodore and Blaise who tried (or at least pretended) to get out of the way from them. But they were hit a lot and Potter laughed loudly and threw a few more.
“What?!” Draco stopped as well and immediately shook his head. “Why would you think that, bear? If I could I would adopt you, you’re the sweetest boy I know!”
Anyway, I also have an old Transfigurations book around here. It’s a smart move to ask me (not because I know a lot about it), since James and Sirius were both incredibly smart and figured out how to transfigure themselves in third year. I have always admired that. I’ll send it to you with the original notes from both James and Sirius. Maybe once you’re out of Hogwarts, Harry might like to keep it – that’s perfectly okay.
Potter rolled his eyes, quite obviously annoyed. “I honestly don’t think that is any of your business.” Draco was not going to accept Potter avoiding his questions. He raised his eyebrows and stayed quiet, until Potter finally broke. “I don’t need to eat. I can live for a long time without food.”
Draco frowned at her and shook his head unable to believe that there was in fact something he could potentially do! “What?”
The only person slightly out of his comfort zone was Weasley, who just sat there, staring at Potter wide-eyed, as if he wasn’t sure whether he was dreaming or not.
“Bear, don’t you worry, it’s fine. I’m not going to hurt you.” This wasn’t working. How could he bring his ward out of his hiding place and into his arms?
The second time, Ian had walked into the pub, Draco was sitting on the bar again, eating spaghetti with pesto and quietly listening to a CD, Potter had bought a few days ago. Since Potter wasn’t in the room, Ian probably felt stronger and decided to talk to him.
Pansy’s suspicious look to both of them didn’t seem to stop Draco from shrugging his shoulders and grinning. As if she had figured out what was going on, she laughed and shook her head, before she walked into the kitchen.
“I’ll be right with you, guys” he smiled and nodded at Harry, who managed a small, tired smile, before he followed Millicent, once Pansy put her arm around him.
Draco smiled, when they passed them and he caught Pansy’s eyes and she winked at him. Yes, these idiots they were most definitely his family. And it felt so comfortable, so intimate here.
That made his husband laugh and he nodded. “One of the plus points, yeah.” He smirked at Harry, leaning forward. “So what color were you thinking?”
“To be honest, I’ve always wanted to be a Herbology professor here.” Dean blushed and shrugged his shoulders again. “Everything I did was to one day get that job. I was going to write an application for next year’s job offer – I heard Professor Sprout will be leaving with McGonagall and then… Blaise said he got the job just by asking you…”
Madam Pomfrey accepted the parchment again and smiled at Draco. “I should congratulate you now, Mr. Malfoy. As it looks for now, he will be ageing faster. The next year will take two weeks and after that week by week. I would like for you to come by every week. This parchment is slightly alerting. Should there be other injuries it’s best to look at them and maybe heal them magically.”
He was met with the most beautiful grey eyes he had ever seen and so much happiness and pure love under the surface. “Thank you, love. We should head back – it’s most likely after midnight already.”
Laughing, Harry turned to Draco, pressed a soft kiss on his cheek and turned to Pansy. “There. Now I’m going to bed see you tomorrow.”
“Sirius Evans” Potter answered and nodded. “I like your name, by the way. Your parents must have been proud that they found a name matching the first letter of your last name.”
“But Aunt Bella tried to kill… all of them! She tortured Granger for Salazar’s sake!” Draco remembered the screams in the Manor, echoing through the halls and the whole house actually. He had wanted to run then. He had wanted to free Potter and his friends and make a run for his own freedom. But he couldn’t. There had been Death Eaters everywhere and his father had known him too well. Positioning him in his room and he stood at the door, checking up on him.
“I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking the last six months were but a dream. That was confusing.” Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “Other than that, it was a rather nice night.”
“That is a scary thought” Draco added, trying to work with this as well. The door was luckily not that big and it would have never fitted through there, but still… What if someone had accidentally found the door?
When he turned back to Draco, he saw him smirking and he took another sip of the aromatic tea. “So, Harry.” He tilted his head a little. “What were you thinking about before I came here?”
That made Minerva laugh and she nodded. “Maybe if Albus had been Headmaster it would have gone that way. I believe in at least a little guidance once in a while. If that’s alright with you.”
Draco smirked and sat up, crossing his legs on the couch. “Yes.” The sight of Harry’s wet hair was doing all kinds of things to him. Who would have known? In fact, who would have known that the two of them would meet again five years after Hogwarts in a work outing, have a few drinks together, spend a night and then a whole weekend in Draco’s flat and suddenly start dating for three months already.
“Oh yes, they have a huge employee turn-over rate. I believe after eight months I was the one who had been here the longest. So, since I knew how most things worked, I got to be the boss here” Neville explained and grinned. “It’s boring though. I’m looking for something new as well. I’m just staying because I know everyone else is completely unusable.”
Draco scoffed. “That wouldn't be beneath her.” He sighed. “Last question: What happens to this magic, if you take someone's name? Couldn't she just take her part of the family magic back?”
What had he done?! He was not ready to fight in this war! It was the wrong side anyway! Harry had the real good side. Why was he here?
Cesar had returned in the middle of the night, probably as a revenge for having woken up Remus, and woke him up as well. They had been welcomed over at nine and no one was awake this early on Saturday, right?
As they entered the Common Room, it was nearly empty. Harry yawned and walked to their secret spot, while Draco followed. Maybe now was a good question to ask what he was always doing with Severus?
Draco had almost burst out laughing. Potter, a snob? That was the most amazing thing he had heard in a while.
Neville chuckled and leaned back in his chair. “It will be fun though.” With seeing Harry’s raised eyebrows, he continued half laughing: “I mean, seeing how everyone is teaching their children. I heard Nott has a baby girl as well.”
“It’s really weird. I can’t imagine living without Harry. He lights up every room he’s in. Plus, he already has things he does all the time. Scaring Theo, being stupid with Pans…” Draco rubbed his forehead. He had wanted to add something else, when his former godfather interrupted him.
Draco frowned slightly. “Is it possible that maybe he’s not achieving all the skills he should be able to have at this age?”
Slowly, Harry rose to his feet and walked over to Draco, who wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do now.
Sighing, Draco rubbed his temples. “I could lose everything! Harry will hate me once he realizes that I’m into him! I don’t even know if he’s gay!” Draco slumped in his chair. “I think it would be better to just pretend I’m something I’m not.”
Yawning, Draco turned on his side, not removing the arm he had over his ward, to keep him safe, and grinned at his childhood best friend. “Alright, Pans. Next time he comes looking for me after a nightmare I’ll send him to you.”
They headed to their Common Room, where they had a short break of about thirty minutes before the classes would start again. Inside, the door to their secret garden was open and Draco frowned when he looked outside to see Severus.
“I’ll let you two out and play together when we’re in the Great Hall or Common Room, depending on where everyone is right now” Harry explained to Olaf and Padfoot, as if they could understand him.
“Probably” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “It’s the first time where I feel free. Last summer, I’ve talked to Severus about it a lot. And… talking helps. I don’t know if it ever gets easier or normal.”
“I don’t care what you say, Draco, I want to celebrate his second year birthday. He’s the cutest baby there is and I will be celebrating that he’s around here! I don’t care what you think about it” Pansy turned back to her planning while Draco threw his hands into the air.
“She’s the best woman in town!” the middle aged man next to Draco practically yelled and Potter smirked when he caught eye of a slightly scared Draco.
“Neither am I, actually” Millicent snorted and tried to avoid whatever jinxes Pansy was throwing at her.
“Well, this stupid class reunion thing is going to end tomorrow. I wouldn’t mind coming by in the afternoon. Does that work for… you?” Harry offered, grinning over how bad this call must sound to the two Slytherins in the Common Room.
Potter smiled broadly and pointed at the horse he had been drawing. It was huge and winged and generally looked like a made-up thing. However, when he spoke up, Draco widened his eyes, not sure he was hearing it correctly.
He wanted to walk by Ginny, who blocked his way, shaking her head. “I highly doubt that you don’t want to hear that. And I think it’s in Harry’s wishes that I tell you.”
He had a life before Harry had come to live with him! There was going to be a time – in two months basically on the point – where he had to continue his life without him. With every step, this thought seemed to settle into his brain. Harry being around him was just for a few months.
“Tell me what you find, love. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep before you’re both back.” Eric sighed. “And be careful. Aurora wouldn’t walk with you if it’s safe.”
“Hey mate, where were you? We had a meeting with Kingsley first thing today.” Ron tilted his head and shook a strain of hair out of his face that seemed to bother him.
He groaned as Luna helped him getting to his feet and after the first step towards the kitchen, he finally answered. “I don’t remember, Luna. Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t.”
“Of course, whatever you say” Pansy once again winked at Harry, who started to giggle slightly uncontrollable.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. He had heard this story a few thousand times. Not only from Hermione but from Ginny as well.
Harry rubbed his temples and looked down at his book. Was there even an option for asking his friends? They would probably hate him for even thinking of wanting to date Malfoy. And who else could he ask? There was basically nobody here to help him.
The war has certainly had its toll on everyone, especially you. I am sorry if the trust you had in your family was buried once your father invited the Dark Lord into this house. So, I am hoping we could meet and maybe have our relationship back to a somewhat normal mother-son-relationship.
“What?” Harry frowned and looked up. He rolled his eyes, once he found Draco with a smirk on his face. “You know, if a certain someone would stop hiding my Auror robes near damn every night, I would be done much faster!”
Harry nodded. “From what I’ve heard, I think someone in my family line actually figured out the Skele-Grow and I’m pretty sure I’ve got the patent for the Pepperup Potion somewhere.”
No winners. Just survivors. He had survived a lot: The Injury Parchment was proof of that. But what did he experience while he was being hunted? This boy was such a strong fighter! Ever since he had seen the light of the world: parents killed when he wasn’t even two years old, abused by his relatives, fought throughout all the hardships happening at Hogwarts and ended up winning...
“They gave me a love potion!” Draco explained and smirked. He looked over to Harry as if waiting for him to help out though Harry was quite frankly not in any state to argue with someone. His mind was still filled with pictures upon pictures of what
That he could go with. “Well, I worked in a police station, but my job became boring over time. It’s always the same and no matter how many bad guys you catch, there will always be more of them.”
“I don’t remember, Mr. Parker. I’ve never been able to sleep through the night” Potter explained, while the doctor checked a few things. Draco really didn’t want to eavesdrop, but walking up the wooden stairs would have made a lot of noise, so he simply hoped not to be too obvious.
They sat in a sort of comfortable silence after that, listening to the wind howling through the room, the waves crashing against the window and the lightning (followed by thunder) crashing into whatever it could find.
Mirjam nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe.” She turned her attention back to the parchment and asked: “Are you satisfied with your intimacy?”
Draco tried really hard to suppress rolling his eyes and grabbed his tea instead. “Thank you, Severus” he said, a little too annoyed, before he took a sip of his tea. It tasked weird somehow and he looked down into the cup. However, Severus wasn’t reacting and he also hadn’t said what kind of tea it was, so maybe...
Potter chuckled and there was a special light in his eyes, as if this store was his happy place, which Draco would believe quite quickly.
Since he wasn’t saying anything, the Headmistress continued. “Professor Snape will be handling your private Potion’s lessons as well as Charms. I will be giving you some private lessons in Transfigurations as well as Herbology. That should cover everything. Is there something else you’d like to learn or is that everything for now?”
With shaking hands, he opened the letter, looked over to insure that Pansy kept a good look on Potter and after confirming that she did, he sighed and turned to the writing.
“Harry!” Hermione stepped towards him and placed a calming hand on his shoulder. At least Harry thought it was supposed to be calm, as he really didn’t feel angry on the inside. “Maybe talking to each other would help somehow?”
He felt the Slytherin move next to him they were almost pushed together by the walls. Harry put his hands down and shook his head over the moving walls.
Looking up, his boyfriend smirked. “We’re going to find you another favorite movie again, Dray! I know you like romance movies with strong independent characters, maybe a little humor as well. So…” he motioned at all the movies around him. “We’re going to watch as many movies as we can here and continue when we’re out of Hogwarts until we find one you love as much as you loved that other one.”
I’m not going back. I know I shouldn’t be alone for there could be something happening any second, but I don’t trust the mediwitches anymore. Also, I’m probably not going to be alone any longer. Today, I’m freeing Draco. I’ve got everything under control. I took my pain medication, Nora is with me (at least at the beginning), it should be fine. I hope.
The sound coming alive under his fingertips and travelling through the strings into the wooden instrument body had always amazed Draco. Just a touch and the whole piano was humming with joy. A smile played on his face, as he closed his eyes, letting his fingers dance on the black and white keys. There was a rather quick base while the higher notes jumped around with an air of ignorance and happiness.
Draco saw Harry nodding, slightly relieved.  Even though he wanted the vault gone… he still seemed to want something from it. Well, apparently, there weren’t that many personal items around, since most stuff actually was about pranks and other stuff the three Gryffindors had done at school.
Harry watched Dean, Seamus, Anthony and Ernest walking off towards the sweets shop. Susan, Hannah, Padma and Millicent headed towards the cafe where Harry had had his fucked up date in fifth year with Cho. He should have realized by that time already that he wasn’t really into girls.
“We’ll check the upper floors, you do the things down here” Nott said and grabbed Ron. Harry’s friend widened his eyes and was just about to struggle against the Slytherin, when he already pulled him up the stairs.
Harry ran his hand through Draco’s red hair and murmured against his lips: “You’re a love-struck fool, my handsome snake.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “It’s not that! Well, not only.” He took a sip of his wine and sighed. “A few months ago I would have laughed my arse off if someone would have told me I would be sad once Harry reached his actual age again. And now… here I am.”
My son shall receive the contents of vault 10777. Its documents include Harry’s birth certificate, a few birthday presents that were too fragile to keep around a toddler. There are also a few other valuable items in there, including some of the Potter’s patents and everything else which could be helpful to my son. There is also an unsigned magical marriage document so that should my son desire to marry with his parents blessing, the document will give our statement. Harry, I know you might not want to find out whether or not we approve of your partner choice – you do not have to do something like this.
Padma agreed and laughed lightly. “My grandfather said that the day he voted ‘yes for women voting power’ my gran said that if he was voting no, he would find all his things outside in the horse’s stable and he dare talk to her again. She had the divorce papers ready and already signed when he left that day.”
Draco shook his head and knelt down in front of Teddy, even though he was now taller.  “That’s just because I’m the one making your godfather happy. If there was another person, they would be the house’s favorite person.”
Smirking, he grabbed his husband’s hand. “I’m glad you’re the one to make this suggestion, since I was actually thinking of how to best make this offer.”
This made Pansy laugh loudly and she shook her head. “Draco honestly, when we found him at the lake, he greeted all of us. Except you. He didn’t know how to. And during the party, he couldn’t keep his eyes off of you. He’s absolutely into you.”
“Nothing” Harry held his hands up. “I just can’t believe we’re sitting here all so civilized at one table talking.”
“I see how you treat him. I haven’t seen him so relaxed in quite a long time. I think it would be nice for him to have a home. And I think you would be the perfect person for him to heal from his wounds.”
Well, while Harry was just as happy as always (a little more talkative as usual), Draco was actually really nervous. Even if Weasley’s mother had been nothing but nice to him, sending him all kinds of things and little tips, it was different to meet someone on person who had… actually destroyed his aunt. It wasn’t that he was scared of her, but… she was a scary woman.
Sitting up on the hill, where he had first met Potter, he took out his phone – not after looking around for people to overhear him – and dialled the number of Quentin King, his boss.
Draco shook his head. “Unlikely.” He didn't want his hopes crushed. And this Gryffindor probably knew everything about Harry. What if she wanted to tell him that he should stop with figuring out whether or not Harry was gay? He wasn't ready to give up... Or maybe he had already given up? Draco sighed. Everything was so confusing.
In his isolation, he had read thousands of books about mist magic. It was a special kind of magic used for children with trauma and even PTSD. The magic had a healing component and was also calming them down along with giving comfort. Draco was sure that had Harry grown up in a wizard environment this magic would have been used on him.
“You also prefer to speak through your eyes, but nothing could take away your voice. And you prefer big actions, like hugs and laughter, than small eye contacts” Harry continued. “You tried to be a, what they call true Slytherin, cold and collected. But deep down” Harry placed his hand on Draco’s knee and squeezed slightly. “You love physical contact. Which is why Pansy is your best friend, she’s a rather physical friend.”
“Nothing... We just don’t go there...” Draco shrugged his shoulders. "Or we just hang out with our friends."
“Bad guys can still take good care of children” Draco reminded her and raised his eyebrows. He buried his own memories of his father, trying hard not to think about the way he had ended up.
“A lot, to be honest.” It was best to stick with the truth... or some version of the truth. “However, since Harry already lived with them and is now basically over eighteen... what’s the reason to kill them now?”
Ginny shrugged her shoulders. “Tell them you married Draco and you’ve lived together in a flat in Muggle London for pretty much ten years. That explains everything so perfectly.”
“No.” Hannah frowned and snorted then. “Alright, I have no idea what I was thinking.” She turned back to her knitting, frowning as she carefully looked over the last thing she did.
“Your family’s back, Cocoa Puff. We better get you home, before they realize you’re gone” he said and got up.
“Not even close. I’m oblivious as well. Pansy told me this morning I should finally go and talk to you instead of staring at you.” Malfoy frowned slightly. “I wasn’t aware it was
“His memory is coming back whenever he’s in a specific age” Draco explained and Remus looked at him thoughtfully, before he smiled.
“Thou art h'reby officially did charge as a homosexual in a relationship with Assad M’rton. Thou art did arrest for ign'ring the nature's calleth and treason upon Mrs. Pott'r. Putteth the quill down!” the lead Auror said, taking out his wand.
Snorting, Harry leaned down and kissed Draco’s forehead. “I blame your sex drive. You’ve always gone wild when there was someone telling you not to do something with me.”
“However, I like this one much more.” Pansy placed a picture on the desk and Draco turned to it, seeing Harry looking straight at him. He had a one-sided smirk and winked at the camera. His eyes were so full of light and happiness. “You do realize he wasn’t looking at the camera, right?”
Since the last time they had been here, it actually looked rather nice. The garden had been cleaned and even though it was still far too early to plant anything, Remus seemed to have started to plan things out.
“You are the worst husband-to-be!” Pansy declared and glared at him, though Harry caught a smirk on her lips. She clearly wasn’t that mad about it.
Shrugging, Neville copied her action and sighed then. “Not really. My grandmother wants me to join the Aurors.”
Actually, after the hour was up, Draco had not only managed to finish the Astronomy essay, he had also proofread the essay for the Study of Ancient Runes and done his homework in Potions and Transfigurations. It was surprising what one could accomplish if the correct mindset was in place.
Potter beamed when he recognized his favorite book about Mama Bear and he started naming a few objects in the drawings. Finally, at the end, he pointed at Mama Bear and beamed at Draco. “Bear!”
Dwarfbart nodded. “I can’t take away all of it right now. But I can minimize his influence and with that it will go away naturally with Harry using his magic regularly.”
“Yeah, don’t be so negative! Everything I do, you think I’m doing because I have a hidden reason for it. I don’t!”
Dean giggled and it echoed from the walls so that his husband hushed him quickly. “I’m being the adult in this relationship, apparently. What if we drown?!”
“Very well, here’s the parchment of what happened.” Draco pointed to the paper and was delighted to find Harry actually reading it. Pansy and Blaise had done very well! He sat down next to his ward and continued: “Now, what do you think should happen next?”
“You too, Alamar.” With that she transformed back into a cat and when Alamar opened the door slightly, she raced outside and was gone in a matter of seconds.
Draco decided to interrupt this, he knew where this was going. Jeremia didn’t make it. He needed to ask Pansy to stop reading dramatic stories or fairy tales. And yes, this book was in French and Pansy probably read it to him so he could train his language.
“Pansy taught him a few words, such as ‘promise’ and she’s been trying to make him say ‘may I have’ instead of… well nothing. Didn’t really stick, now, did it?” Mil winked at Potter who actually snorted.
Severus laughed. “I know, Draco. I also hadn’t bought this house with the intent of once housing two additional adults here. It was just going to be me.”
He was right. Draco looked at Harry closely. He simply looked back with all his innocence. If he were to receive all his memories... This innocence was surely gone. Draco really wanted to contain it, however, if he did nothing, he was also getting his memory back. It didn’t really matter what he was going to do.
Draco looked up to see Weaslette standing at the door, next to Lovegood. Frowning slightly, Draco tried to remember whether or not he had invited more than two people for this play date. He was sure that he had only told Weasley and Granger to come and meet him and Potter. Too many people made it harder for him to see and keep track of his ward.
“I would love to, but...” Pansy looked at Draco, contemplating silently whether or not she should follow her and get something to drink.
Hermione hit both of them with a parchment over their heads. “Quit playing around and go back to studying. It’s important to our marks in our N.E.W.T.s.”
Harry chuckled and nodded. “I know. So, are they dead? I couldn’t really figure it out. The rumors range from them dying immediately over them running away to being in St. Mungo’s?”
The kitchen was huge! And almost completely round. In the middle was the stove with pots and pans above it hanging down. The ceiling was so high that Draco’s steps echoed from the walls. And the windows were so huge that there was so much natural light in here, there was absolutely no need for any light.
Draco quickly held up his hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, I’ll stop.” He was not going to let his best friend since childhood tell Harry some of his most embarrassing moments. She did know quite a lot of these...
“That’s what I thought as well.” Oliver grinned, pulling Harry into a hug. “And hey, it’s not like they don’t like me already. I’m pretty sure Fred thinks we’re already dating anyway.”
Before Draco could say that Harry was getting a little dark there, Pansy had already pulled him into her half-hug and she grinned at Draco’s ward. “Don’t be overly dramatic; it doesn’t suit you, darling.”
The moment he entered his office and looked at everything, he knew what to do. Walking around the desk, he sat down, quickly writing a letter to Kingsley and the Head Auror. He then shrunk down all of his belongings and put them into a small bag. The paperwork, he looked through and finished the ones that were the fastest.
Year 5 is a little difficult for me, I love the book (except for one specific person we all know), but I am devestated by Sirius. Anyway, I have decided not to spend too much in this age, since I think Harry has a lot of difficult emotions running through his mind. The next chapter goes a little deeper into that. For now, I have decided to stay on the fluff side, while diving only a little into the other thing.
“So, where’s this secret door you’ve mentioned?” Harry’s voice brought him back from all his memories and he pointed at the opposite wall of the table, where in the dark wood, you could actually see something that looked like a door.
Chuckling softly, Draco carefully brushed a strain of hair out of Harry’s face and smiled lovingly. “You just want us to be here. Alone in each other’s company.”
Draco agreed. “How do I know if he’s going through this time in his life?” he asked, looking at Potter. The Gryffindor had lost interest in his teddy bear and was crawling around the edge of his ‘prison’ either looking for something interesting outside or actively trying to get out of it. Draco was somehow sure it was the latter.
When Madam Pomfrey handed him the sleeping baby Harry, Draco could see Severus narrowing his eyes. As he left the Hospital Wing, he knew that his godfather was following him. Sure enough, as he turned around, Severus stood there, frowning at him.
Most fun I’ve had today! Although, everything about this reunion is incredible fun! I’m just slightly sad that I can’t be openly in love with you. But this is fun as well.
“She did” Potter chuckled. He looked up and grinned. “I’ll send you an owl with the address of my company, when I’ve found my top three picks for you.” He slid a small parchment over the table. “I just need you to fill in the questions here and then I’ll leave you in peace again.”
“We both are” his husbands said between kisses. “And to be honest” he continued after sitting back down and finish eating. “You have gotten much better at not being such a show-off. So, in some ways, there only is one thing that’s really pissing me off.”
“This is the most wholesome picture I’ve ever had. Where’s Pansy when you need her camera?” Harry asked and closed the door, before Merlin could realize it was open to begin with.
“How could I be mad, Dray? You guys were such better parents than they were by far. And they’re double the age! I mean, I’m slightly disappointed that I couldn’t have been the one to cast the spell, but” he shrugged his shoulders, implicating that everything was fine.
As he finally made it into the Common Room, surprisingly without losing anything, he found all the arrivals sitting around the biggest table, just discussing life. Even Draco sat there at the same table as Ron and Hermione. That was definitely interesting.
“I think I agree” Harry answered thoughtfully. “But I also want to know what you think about this. You know the whole Wizarding World will have their own thoughts about that. And they might not be positive.”
Thank you for being part of this journey, it was amazing to read all your comments. I'm glad I've started this idea.
Don’t tell anyone you’ve gotten this from me. If anyone wanted to tell the Aurors what’s going on, this might be useful. He made the same mistakes twice in a row. He was in St. Mungo’s for drinking on the job three times and the files attached are just what I’ve found on the surface. Let me know what you want to do with the files. Maybe I can help you further?
Harry nodded. “Yes, the Ravenclaw diadem and Nagini. The only living creature next to me with a dark object inside it. I should feel honored.”
“You don’t have to add your names, they’re already here” Minerva said, politely ignoring the past issue.
“If you were asking someone out, how would you do it?” This question came easier than Harry had originally thought.
to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not going there” Millicent explained and called out: “Harry, we know you’re here!”
Harry wiped tears off his face and chuckled again. He cleared his throat and tried to say something, when he started to laugh again.
Still, the cologne reminded him of their honeymoon, where Draco had basically abducted him to a tour of France, Switzerland and Italy before changing the continent and travelling through almost all of South America. The cologne, he had found in France and he wore it all the time during their honeymoon. Harry knew that he usually wore it when he felt a little uneasy or just to enjoy a nice evening together.
Boy caught a twinkle in his eyes which made him smile and he took another sip of his amazing hot chocolate. It was so much better than all that packaged stuff Aunt Petunia would give Dudley, which he occasionally stole just to try.
Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “I think I might just continue standing here, watching you and Merlin. It’s quite the sight, you know.”
Harry nodded and grabbed his own wand. He could still feel where Malfoy had touched him and pulled him downstairs. It was weird, but warm somehow. Well, never mind that, he had no time to think about that.
Finally, Madam Pomfrey walked out of her office, smiling at Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, welcome back. I wasn’t sure whether or not you’d remember our meeting. Well then, let’s check on your ward, shall we?”
Draco snorted and moved to lay closer to him. “Daphne would say that, yes. And Pansy, if she knew that we were happily married.”
Looking to his husband, Harry smiled softly. There were a few books around the bed and the nearest one had a bookmark almost half through it. So the Slytherin had found a way to keep himself busy while he was asleep. “Why didn’t you wake me?”
Before he could reach her, Charlie held his hand back. “Don’t touch him! It’s another sense that could mess him up right now. You need to let the magic do its work.”
“First, we should take apart the basilisk, then we can clean up the water” Theodore started and after a few moments, he had already started the action plan. After dinner, they were going to show this room to the other Slytherins, and while Draco would show Harry how to work with dissecting the snake, the others were supposed to clean rocks and rubble form the main room and close the other entrances, so that nobody could accidentally stumble upon their room and they wouldn’t get lost.
Hermione seemed not to have realized the little interaction between Draco and Harry, as she squeezed Harry’s arm and smiled softly. “I’m also looking forward to the end of this tour.”
It was silent for a few moments, in which Draco wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do now. Then Harry turned his head again. “You didn’t make a fool out of me, Draco. I knew you were Benjamin the second week you were here.”
Pansy nodded her approval. “Also, you’ve been hunting him ever since you came to Hogwarts, so I completely agree.” She grabbed more bacon and got the last piece before Theodore did. He glared at her, even though the plate refilled itself almost immediately.
Old people had a certain style and even though Draco couldn’t really pin down what kind of a style they had, Mrs. Williams’ house matched all the other houses perfectly. She told him to sit down at the small kitchen table and presented him with a cake.
In fact, he had been right. Aaron stopped a few feet away from him. “Hello Benjamin. Could I have a minute of your time?”
Some of you may have seen that I added the finished amount of chapters. This si what I have planned, it could vary slighty (towards more chapters), depending on whether or not I think I moved to fast, but the later chapters will have alot of things happening and for my planning it doesn't have enough fluff in there. Well, I haven't written them yet, so maybe it'll all change.
Eric couldn’t quite answer that and so he turned to Alamar who sighed and nodded. “I’ve never seen so much magic in a home. It was everywhere. It wouldn’t surprise me if Dumbledore placed something on Harry as well, just to keep track of what he was doing.”
There was an uncomfortable silence in the air, before Harry got up from his couch and sat down next to Draco rather scared. Draco frowned; he had thought that he had calmed down his ward. However, he looked as if something was killing him on the inside.
Maybe she had even taken him away once old Mrs Figg died. However, that couldn’t be true, since she hadn’t been gone in so long and if Harry Potter had been in his castle, he would have known it. He had knowledge over everything that happened in here.
– had told him from the beginning to take Padfoot with him. He just hadn’t wanted to listen. Six days wasn’t going to break him, right? Well, Padfoot knew better and somehow, Harry was glad to have his dog around him again. He really had missed him.
How’s the wedding? Did the bride destroy her dress? Did you have to stop a fist fight between all the groomsmen or did the cake fall and you had to bake another one?
“One more guest, guys. Only one more.” Blaise grinned, but stopped dead in his tracks as soon as he had set one foot inside their home. He stared at everything wide eyed, as if he wasn’t able to believe what he was seeing here. “You
Aaron chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. He then turned back to Draco, eyes sparkling. “You must excuse my friend, she hasn’t learnt proper manners yet and...” He couldn’t finish his sentence, as Olivia attacked him with her scarf, which Aaron caught rather quickly.
Rolling her eyes, Millicent smiled weakly. “He found my favorite pen! I thought I’d lost it, but it was just under my bed. Anyway… Pansy?”
“That’s because it wasn’t a catch up dinner!” Draco growled and touched the burnt up Malfoy crest tie around his neck. Only a little bit was left and it reminded him of what had happened a few moments prior to him apparating the hell out of that house.
were the worst names Draco had ever seen. Harry was not going to name his wifi that. Then again, would he actually try to re-name it or just leave it as it was?
Shaking his head, Harry took a sip of his tea, before he decided to empty the cup. It smelled like hot water to him, why on earth did he drink that? “Thank you so much for pointing out that my family died, while you saved yours and sent them to Australia. We both know that I could have gone to Remus, he would have accepted me as his cub, most likely. But
“Sure, but why Milos?” Malfoy frowned and looked at him, before he turned back to cleaning his camera. “You could have chosen any other name?”
Anyway, about this chapter: I'd like to think that Remus has become sort of a father figure for Draco as well :)
Seamus and Dean looked at each other as if the other man was a ghost. Maybe they thought that all of that was a shared dream or hallucination. Ernest was actually pinching himself and Susan and Millicent looked as if they had something in their eyes, blinking in such a rapid pace.
?!” he snarled. “How dare he come here with someone who hasn’t been at Hogwarts!? Is that even a wizard?!”
His godfather looked at him with his neutral mask perfectly stable, when he nodded and they both made their way into the Potion Master’s office. Everything looked the same: neutral, clean, neat… Except for one thing. Draco was caught off guard by a playpen standing in the corner of the room.
Harry quirked his eyebrows and grinned. “I was unaware that I was invited to join you.” He bit into his favorite sweet, satisfied with his answer, while Ron struggled with another threat.
“Sure.” Harry smiled and felt a weird kind of pain in his heart. This must have been the feeling of seeing his ex moving on and getting another relationship, while he was still trying to find someone.
They took the plates and Theodore spoke up. “Where’s your plate, Harry?” He asked and looked at the child, as he seemed to realize that there were only five plates and there were six of them.
“Yes, why on earth did you use Amortentia to walk around the castle? You have enough admirers as it is, now don’t you?”
He walked over to Malfoy, sensing how Hermione and Ron frowned after him in clear confusion. “Hey, Malfoy, interested in a date?”
“Be my guest” Draco answered and grinned. It was astonishing so see how different he was from the first time he had seen him. He looked so healthy and almost happy.
“Exactly” McGonagall said, though clearly she had heard this information for the first time today. “Madam Pomfrey will need to have him checked regularly; she’ll tell you when you have to be back with your ward. For now, I have enlarged your room and tasked the elves with putting a crib in there. Maybe you should spend a little time with your ward and try to get to know him.”
The blanket was pulled away and Pansy raised her eyebrows at him. Draco sighed defeated and yawned, before he sat up, rubbing the sleepiness from his eyes. “Yes, Pansy, why is that letter so important?” he deadpanned.
Once again, Theodore was asking the questions: “So, when you went to the Ministry, you were looking for a Horcrux there?”
Draco had read a lot of when he was in sixth year. Something about the Dark Lord and him loving the dark studies inside. Draco had in all honesty forgotten what it was about except dark curses.
“Ay ay, mama” Blaise said, which earned him a glaring look from Pansy and a laugh from everyone else, including Potter, who was clearly just laughing because everyone else was.
Ron walked in front of him and placed his arms on his hips. “Yeah, but you’re one to talk, Harry. You and Malfoy are the same kind of stupid people! Please, for Merlin’s tits, go to couples therapy or something!”
These two still had the same weird relationship, even stronger than before, and Draco really wanted to find out what was going on. He had already tried to talk to Severus about it, but he wasn’t going to say anything. Maybe Harry would?
Draco chuckled and got up. “Of course, baby. Come with me. We’ll make ice tea for everyone. Maybe there's some left when Aunt 'Mione and Uncle Ron come by.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and they made their way into the Common Room, where Blaise widened his eyes when he saw Potter dressed in his bear suit. The Golden Boy himself grinned and clapped his hands excitedly. For the past two days, Blaise had actually started reading him stories in French.
Harry chuckled, kissed Draco and got up. “I doubt it’s him. I took the memory of where we live. That would be rather smart of him.”
Ginny opened her mouth to say something, when Kingsley came back into the kitchen. “Looks like he’s not here. Sorry to interrupt your day, I hope you get better soon.” With that, Kingsley bid goodbye and Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry looked at his best mate and frowned. Ron had a huge family, right? If he asked him about how to approach asking someone out, he could use his knowledge of how others in his family had done it and maybe this would help him?
Potter nodded silently, before shrugging his shoulders. “Don’t worry, Benjamin. I’m not falling in love with you. I’m just a fairly happy person. People tend to think it’s love.”
Harry chuckled and lovingly stroked a few loose strains of hair out of Draco’s face. Draco closed his eyes and felt the tiredness overcoming him again, coupled with the loving caress of his boyfriend, he was about to go back through the door to the sleeping world.
McGonagall took the parchment and frowned at it as well now. “I’ve seen his cousin, when I observed them a few days prior to Harry being placed there. He didn’t seem older than Harry himself.”
Harry sighed and shook his head. “I think fifth year is going to suck. And I’m constantly afraid that people ignore me for some reason.”
A few hours later, Harry sat half lying on the couch, feet on top of the small table, a book about a Muggle romance in his hands and he kept reading as if his life depended on that. Draco was lying on his side, leaning against his chest, eyes closed, almost sleeping with one hand on Harry’s stomach, feeling the soft effects of his constant calming breathing.
Harry grinned when he opened the door to his office, balancing the coffee on the other hand, and placed his phone back in his pocket. Last day was a lot of work with cleaning up everything and getting a feedback from the bride and groom. He didn’t even have time to write back Ginny, not that she would have been mad at him for that. Today was finally going to be a normal day again.
Longbottom had this sudden shocked expression on his face. “What? But I have a date in Hogsmeade this evening!”
There was a big old piano in the Common Room. It was rarely looked at and even more rarely played. The house elves kept it in check though, so if you accidentally stumbled upon it, you could start playing without any problem. It was rumoured to have belonged to Salazar Slytherin himself. And there was another rumour that if you’d play a certain set of keys and a specific melody, they greatest wizards and witches of all time would appear in front of you and you could ask them any things for ten minutes. It was just a rumour. But then again, it was just an old piano and it stood there since the beginning of time, nobody knew where it came from and who brought it exactly.
“Harry asked me what it’s like to be in love. How am I supposed to answer that?!” Draco shook his head and grinned. “So I told him he needed to ask Hermione or…” He pointed at her, implying to what had happened.
If his father would see him right now, he would probably kill him. First of all, house elves were supposed to clean, secondly, magic should be used for all housework and how dare he listen to Muggle songs. Additionally, he was living in a Muggle home, only Muggle neighbors… his father would absolutely tell him that he must have lost his mind.
Harry rubbed his eyes and looked up at Draco through his tears. Some were still running down the side of his face into his hair. “Why is my life so fucked up?”
Looking up, Hermione laughed and shook her head. “Come here, you old idiot, nice to see you!” She hugged him and nodded at Blaise. “It’s also nice to have you around, Blaise. Harry keeps talking about you.”
Actually, now that Draco was looking closer, he could see the scar stretching over his whole face. It started at the top right and was the most visible there, however, just like a lightning bolt, it spread over his face, dividing it into a lot of different areas.
“Ron, I’ve made my choice. So could you please stop with everything?! I like being up here! Every morning I can sleep in and go on a stroll around the village and up the hill, breathe in the air and feel like myself again.”
“That’s entirely different, Harry” Draco snorted. “The very first reaction to the curse is the most pure reaction. Right now, your body is trying to fight the curse and there’s a lot of things coming out. If I had a piece of the first vomit, I could…”
Every note was intertwined into a rather complex and upbeat jazz piece, his free foot moving to the sound and before long, his whole body was somehow dancing to the melody-free song that he basically created on the spot.
Harry shook his head and couldn’t contain a smirk creeping to his face. “Ron? What happened to you? Never mind my constant Paparazzi problem. Why do you have a black eye?”
“Oh no” the words escaped Harry’s mouth. Malfoy had said that the Wizarding world didn’t like homosexuals, so if this woman actually got the Aurors because she found out that could mean something bad.
Kingsley shook his head. “No. For a long time that was what people believed, but in reality, I could take everyone’s name here – theoretically speaking.”
“Sure, come in. It’s your room as well, so…” he shrugged his shoulders and smiled at him. Padfoot lay on the floor, playing quietly with his teddy bear, which Harry had actually wanted to film and send to Draco, though… now that they had to hate each other publicly, that would probably not have been such a good idea. He could just imagine Draco squealing over how cute Padfoot was, which would probably attract a lot of eyes and their secret would once again be gone… not the first time though.
Or maybe... Maybe he had forgiven Harry the moment he had turned to a baby and he had been chosen to be his Magical Guardian. Frankly, he had no resentment left, so somehow he must have lost it on the way...
“Bring this to Mr. Rogers” she said quietly, hoping that the open window wasn’t giving Albus another way to listen to what was going on in her office. Toffee hooted and pelted through the open window as if he knew exactly how important this letter was going to be.
“Don’t even start” Dwarfbart rolled his eyes. “It’s always Dumbledore, right now. His newest thing is trying to talk people out of their power. He’s trying to take over quite a few seats the Potter family has had in their century of ruling, as a matter of fact.”
When Draco opened the door, nothing had prepared him for who he was going to find in front of it. Lucius Malfoy. His father of another life.
Draco had destroyed Potter’s trust. He was sure that King or anyone had told him already that Draco was the one that led the Aurors to him. Or maybe Ian was going to accept it as his mistake; however, it was so much easier to give someone else the blame.
When he looked over his shoulders, he could see Draco shaking his head, though he seemed to be more in his own thoughts. They were silent for a while, during which Harry continued to cook the pasta and check up on the newest addition to this household from time to time.
“That’s funny; I cannot understand how you Gryffindors could even like the windy and cold towers of Gryffindor!” Draco answered, fully realising that Harry somehow was incredibly interested in their playful stabs. Who would have thought that he would be talking to a Gryffindor like that...?
Weasley snorted. “Harry and a boyfriend in Canada? Nah. He said something about having found true love in Scotland, though I highly doubt that. He went back there, probably hoping he can repair whatever mess he had caused.”
Draco frowned at the movie. Everything was different now. Despite the weird film logic about taking a flight twenty minutes later and having to get through London traffic, there was something else that was bothering him and never really had. Until now.
Draco quickly made the excess coffee, hitting the table, disappear. Pansy was clearly shocked and unable to react. Only after a few more moments, she turned to Harry with wide eyes. “Well, first of all, you just ruined a good cup of coffee, but secondly, you are such a nice Slytherin prince!”
Pansy looked at Draco’s new father and smiled. “No, thank you, professor. I might join on another occasion.”
Finally, after about ten minutes of tense silence and only baby Potter’s weird inhuman-like noises and Severus’ irrational chuckles, McGonagall entered the room, followed by Professor Sprout and Madam Pomfrey.
Shaking his head, Harry grinned and leaned against his husband’s strong chest. “I love you” he whispered quietly, though Draco still caught it – or he just correctly assumed what Harry had said.
There was a small tug on Draco’s lips, which Harry was sure only he saw. “Really?” he asked and turned to him. “Who’s the girl? Come on, Potter, it would be so much easier for you if you’d tell us!”
“No, it's a magical adoption” Draco calmed her down and smiled. “Since one of us is the actual father of the child, we can just magically adopt them and they then might get some of the other's traits as well and might lose some of the mother's DNA.” He motioned at Lily and smirked. “I'm still waiting for her to get untameable hair like Harry.”
Rumours were just made for anxious people to scare them even more. He knew that the Dark Lord used this tactic more than once and it had always worked in his favour. So... Rumours were nothing more than that: empty words believed by people without proper ideas.
Harry turned to look at his husband and silently rolled his eyes. This again? They just couldn’t let the two of them suffer in peace. Draco smirked and shrugged his shoulders. He seemed to enjoy this conversation much more than Harry. He leaned closer, ghosting a kiss on his temple, which made Harry smile softly.
Harry rolled his eyes, annoyed. “I won’t forget it, don’t worry, Theodore.” He whistled for Padfoot and walked out of the Common Room.
“You were right, Mr. Malfoy” Madam Pomfrey said as she looked at the parchment. “He’s just reached his fifteenth month.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. “Sorry Oskar. I’m not going to transfer. I do kind of like my job.”
Smiling softly, Draco checked his watch. He had just had an amazing idea and he needed to find out whether or not he could actually do it. Well, since it was in the morning and the shop would close over lunch, they needed to wait. Draco’s favourite clothes shop was very small and only three people worked in it. It was a family business. So, they closed then, especially on Saturday.
“Why is there a ferret?” she asked, aghast, as if she couldn’t believe the amount of work Harry had gone through to make his husband suffer. She apparently still thought that they were going through a divorce, even though she should have known that the two of them were so happy together that she usually hated to be around them alone.
She smirked and apparently decided to leave it at that, as she winked at him and got up to leave. Draco was too confused and flabbergasted and yes, hopeful, to say anything against that.
They didn’t have to go far, as McGonagall stopped next to the entrance to the castle. There were about a hundred golden plaques with names, dates and roles. Teachers, students, fighters.
Draco smirked, wondering how Harry was doing so well. And also why he was cooking right now. “You’re making pancakes for dinner?”
Harry walked back from Minerva’s office where he had just received a list of practically every professor leaving Hogwarts. The only one remaining was the new creature professor and of course Charlie who had confirmed to Minerva that he would like to continue teaching every other semester. Harry really had nothing against that – he liked Charlie very much and if he continued flying in on dragons, that was surely going to interest the students a lot. Everyone else, including Madam Pomfrey was leaving Hogwarts together with Minerva. It wasn’t really surprising, Harry mused, as they all had been through so much together. They were probably only sticking around because Minerva was still there.
He seemed rather amused by their discussion. “Well, I mean if I won the lottery I’d buy Manor and rebuilt it into either a day school for children with magical parents or I’d turn it into an animal friendly environment for people who go on holiday and don’t want to leave their animals home alone. I haven’t decided yet.” He shrugged his shoulders and grinned.
Draco had decided to ask for some help from the Gryffindor’s study group in the library and he understood Transfiguration now a tiny bit better, though it would probably still be easier to learn Arabic.
“Why?” Harry asked. He still stepped towards it and touched the metal. It didn’t do anything special, just stayed exactly the same as before.
“How so?” Blaise asked as they made their way to Potions, where Severus had hinted a few days prior that he was going to make them brew a very complicated and abstract potion – whatever that meant.
“The best. They finally found a way remove the transformation entirely. They’re doing a few test runs, but the medicine could be ready in a year” Remus explained and while he said it his eyes were full of joy and Draco could even see a glint of hope.
“Am I being punished?” Harry asked, eyes wide open and he held his teddy bear tight to his chest. He was really scared and Draco hated himself for talking loudly.
“Pansy, you don’t have to be so harsh to him! Neville also hasn’t been over for the last week, has he?” Draco asked when they followed him into the kitchen.
Potter had avoided talking to him for an entire two days. On day three, Draco woke up to some music again. He sighed and got dressed to finally catch a glance of Potter after two days. He didn’t know why it was important to him, but when he walked down the stairs, he saw him dancing around the room, slowly. The broom was in his hands, the music was slow and sad.
Before she could say something, McGonagall came out of the shadows and at the same time, Pansy appeared. Harry saw her and jumped out of the mud and ran at her... throwing mud at her as well. Draco’s best friend screeched and ran away from Harry only to slip on the mud man he had built and landing directly on top of Draco, before sliding into the mud herself.
Draco snorted and laughed while he turned away from them, just when the bell sounded and Pansy jumped up, almost running through the apartment and opening the door. Harry shared an amused look with Draco and he placed the food onto the table, though not before casting an invisibly wall around the table… just in case.
” Harry called out laughing and dramatically threw his hands into the air. “He’s too young. And his older brothers all go to school and he has to stay at home with Mama Penguin.”
I could think of a thousand names before I would give my lovely baby Harry to Dumbledore as a Magical Guardian, even though he tried to persuade me. I know he’s planning something – a mother knows things like this – but… that has nothing to do with what I’m supposed to write in here.
Draco noticed that the Gryffindor looked at him for a little help and so he bent down and whispered (loud enough for Theodore to hear) “James.”
“Yes, I think it would help my ward to be looking after an owl. And to be honest, hearing about his story, it matches his rather well.”
I can’t believe this song apparently doesn’t exist in English? I couldn’t find the exact translation of it. Well, it means: “There between the ox and the grey donkey” and is a sort of sleeping Christmas song (it’s so beautiful!) I love Christmas music xD
Thousands of thoughts raced through his head, when Hermione turned to Kingsley. “I took more, because I messed up the first batch! I’m usually so good in everything, but this... I just... I couldn’t do it the first time...”
Please let me know, I would like to come by as long as Harry’s memories are still fresh. While you would be talking, I’m very happy to play babysitter and look after Teddy, the picture you’ve sent me is adorable and I had to keep it away from Pansy, because I am sure she would have floo’d right over and tried to abduct him.
And the Gryffindor also didn’t look any better. His hair was much more chaotic than ever and there was an unknown fear in his eyes. Even though his clothes looked normal, Draco knew that there was something wrong.
“Absolutely.” Nicolai followed, though he stopped at the kitchen door. When they passed Kevin’s office, Harry caught him looking at them suspiciously. Before he could say something, though, his former boyfriend started talking again: “So, are you not going to ask me why I came to look for you?”
“Go ahead, scream without a voice! See how far that get’s you!” Pansy joked, taking her wand out of her pocket. She did it, hiding it from Madam Pomfrey, probably just in case she thought they were actually threatening Harry.
Harry nodded and he led them through the tunnels to a huge room. It had a few snake heads on the side and at the back there was a statue and…
Malfoy stepped next to him and took out his own wand as well. “You’re really good at de-escalating whatever these two are doing right now.” He kneeled in front of the door as well, pointing his wand at the lock.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Don’t care.” Before he could add more, however, Theodore came into the room and raised his eyebrows.
Harry knew well enough that his lovely husband tended to go a little crazy with his hair if he didn’t have time to comb it through inch by inch and check for something. So, he did feel rather guilty – especially after he had seen him running his hand through his hair so many times over the course of the day. Now, at least he could make up for it.
Sighing, Minerva looked over the parchments and found another three detention slips for her Gryffindors. She placed them to another pile and glanced back at it. A dragon in potion’s class? This boy was slowly going crazy. She needed to talk to him about these animals, especially with the new laws about to come out. Dragons were quickly becoming part of illegal magical animals. Maybe he could help these animals in some way or another.
His husband winked and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s one more day to go. We should be able to keep it together then, right? I promise, tomorrow night, I’d spend it in your bed, since we’re going back to normal on Friday. Deal?”
Harry frowned, though he still turned and walked down the steps, even if he was a little careful. “You found the potions laboratory in the library?”
Daphne coughed, though Harry thought she was hiding a giggle, laughter or chuckle. Her expression was absolutely giving it away. Draco bit his lips, apparently trying his hardest to keep calm. Harry could see how he was fighting with himself.
“Draco can you help me with something?” Harry asked, once they were back at Hogwarts walking down towards the dungeon.
Draco only nodded. He hadn’t heard much of what his godfather had done whenever he was gone, but he knew that he was working as a spy for Voldemort and for Dumbledore. That was actually the ultimate move, being a spy for the two sides. However, he would have never been able to pull it off.
“That’s great to hear, because I found something. Well, Heinrich showed me something you might like.” Draco smiled and Harry frowned at him. They had seen a lot of secret rooms and object over the five years living here, however, he had thought that they had seen all of it. Apparently, he hadn’t.
Draco snorted and frowned at the jumper he wanted to knit. “I think he was testing whether or not she’s a real human being. That boy is definitely a Ravenclaw if I have seen one.”
“You’re not” Draco answered and chuckled. “But maybe they had to deal with you being a child and the only way was to move closer together.”
Draco widened his eyes. He gaped his mouth, as if he wasn’t sure what to say. Finally, he leaned back and shook his head. “Shit. I’m sorry to hear that.”
“We could do it together” Harry offered. “I mean, three powerful wizards are probably too much for a Boggart that hasn’t seen any magic for quite some time.”
However, looking at the happily squealing baby made it really hard to be mad at him. Well, Draco could still try.
Draco sighed and nodded. “Let’s just get this year over, Pans. I can’t wait for us finally graduating!” And leaving this place, where he had just too many memories of either him hurting Harry or the little Gryffindor playing and joking around. Well, he didn’t say that last part our loud, but he was sure Pansy knew exactly what he thought.
“Well, I am happy you’re here. You know, I think I need you to take a few weeks off. At least until summer break” Albus chuckled when he found Severus’ surprised look.
Anyway, we've passed the middle of the story and in my stats this story is actually the second highest in all categories. So, I want to thank you very much for your love of this story! It means a lot to me and I'm glad that you like it as well! :D
Elsewhere, a car just arrived and a half-cut couple left the car giggling and complementing each other that they had made it home without any problem, even though only one of them had been driving. They entered their own home, illuminating another living room window, before they fell onto the floor, laughing and quite probably getting something else to drink as well.
“Ah, you know all about modesty, now do you Malfoy?” Harry smirked and grabbed some snow again. “So, are you going to tell your father about this?”
Harry threw his hands into the air. “How did you know that all the time?! We should have gone and visited you while we tried to figure out what they were and how Voldemort made them.” There was a small grin on his face, which made Draco once again frown.
Laughing softly, Harry shook his head. “I can almost imagine it, little Draco walking around asking people if they want to hear something about stars! It’s adorable!”
“I like, when you make me feel good, Draco” Harry finally said when they left their hiding spot and walked up towards the headmistress’ office. “But I prefer it not to happen when just a thin curtain is separating us from other people.”
Draco was his last chance. If he couldn’t help him or at least find out something that would make his life more livable, he wasn’t going to continue. This curse was killing him anyway. What was the big difference between him just deciding to end it early than to just wait it out? Then again, there was so much he had wanted to do in his life.
It was pretty clear to Draco that he needed to expect the worst. And… yes. The small, almost six years old Harry Potter entered, sporting a rainbow of colors on his head. It seemed as if he couldn’t decide what color to go with, so he took them all on different strains of hair.
Before Harry could say anything against that, he heard a bark and a tall German Sheppard ran into the kitchen. Draco had just had enough time to jump out of the way and grab Teddy, otherwise the two of them would have been ran down by a dirty monster.
Nevertheless, Harry couldn’t resist sending him a quick smile, before he downed his coffee and got up. “I’m by the lake until we’re having the Hogwarts tour” he announced. Hoping that only one person would come looking for him, but knowing full well that it was more than likely that Hermione and Ron would be faster than Draco.
Harry frowned at the information he had heard and seemed to realise that he was stared at. Malfoy actually stood there, crossed arms frowning at him.
“Of course, Harry.” Draco smiled and put an arm around his ward’s shoulders. He wanted to prove Harry that he had absolutely no reason in being afraid to ask for something.
He sighed as his feet found the ground and he got up, carefully. No blackouts, so that was still good. He could even make a few steps without breaking down. How surprising, seeing as he had walked much more today than he had done in probably the last few months. He did have a few sore muscles, though that could have been because of a few different reasons.
Blaise laughed and held his hand out to Merlin who sniffled at it, before rubbing his head on it. “I heard you had a crazy Kneazel at home. How did you even get to own him?”
Before Alamar could say anything else, he realised that Eric fell asleep right there and then. He chuckled softly, placed a kiss on his husband’s temple and slowly got up. With what little magic he had left, he made Eric float up the stairs behind him and they went to bed in their new home. He really needed to sleep for as long as he could. Hopefully, Harry was going to sleep in for as long as possible.
“Yes, sure...” Draco sighed. He was extremely worried about his ward! There were some really bad memories which he was sure nobody actually knew...
“Watch it Harry” his ex turned to him, looking way too relaxed and actually even slightly dangerous. “I’m an Auror. An official Ministry worker. You wouldn’t want to start a war again, would you?” He raised his eyebrows slightly and huffed in a superior way, which was just too much for Harry.
Harry stared at the midnight black hole in the middle of the room. He couldn’t even see the first step of the ladder. His whole body was paralyzed from fear: All his childhood memories came rushing back. How had he been so carefree in his youth? If that were at Hogwarts, he would have been down there already, but now… he couldn’t even move a finger.
Draco shook his head. “Yeah, no. That is clearly not the case, we hated each other. I would have done anything a few weeks back to humiliate him. Why would he trust me? Why would he trust me more than his best friends?!”
Right? That was perfectly okay! He had never been friends with him, they had hated each other for years and in the end...
“No” Draco sighed. “They snapped it when I was thrown into Azkaban. They told me if I ever got out, I needed to get a new one.” The memory of his wand being snapped in half was still a little painful. Even if it hadn’t been his original one, he still had used it a lot and had finally gotten the hang of how it worked.
“Of course he did” Potter shook his head, though he didn’t seem upset. “Who else knows about that? No, let me rephrase that, who
Sticking to their plan, Harry held back his hands and rolled his eyes. “Fine. But I’m not done with this discussion. So even if you were around me for the next twenty-four hours, until this reunion is over, I will be throwing shit at him.”
He heard footsteps behind him and turned around to see Potter walking closer. He should tell him right now... He should tell him that he wasn’t Benjamin Brown, that he was trying to make him come back for another trial and that he was in love with him.
Ron huffed and smiled weakly. “Nice of you to say, but I know I did some bad things.” He looked over to Draco and quickly pressed his lips together, before he sighed. “Which brings me to my next apology. I am sorry, Draco. Not only did you do a much better job, when Harry came asking for help, I…” he shrugged his shoulders, clearly talking about the time where the eleven year old Harry had gone to wake him up due to a nightmare. “I didn’t think about what a child would need. And I’m sorry for not helping you or Harry. I want to apologize to everyone here, for thinking that I was better than you and not believing you had Harry’s best interest at heart.”
As if it recognized a familiar magical core, it gave a few puffs of light. Draco smiled and looked up at Harry, who returned the smile and then walked over to his bed, Nora right beside him. As he got in, fully clothed, the dog jumped up and rolled to a ball right next to him.
“Are you sure, Harry?” Daphne asked and smirked, though she had her expression under control, when Hermione turned to her.
“You can’t blame me for being enchanted by this handsome snake in front of me” Harry said, feeling the need to justify himself. “But of course… If I have overstepped some boundaries, do tell me and I won’t ever do that again.”
“Not really. Well” Draco frowned. “Purebloods have to play instruments, so most choose piano, since almost every family has one in their house and you can use this skill in parties. But violins and guitars or the flute is just as adored.”
A second later, as if he had realized that he was being watched, he looked up and smiled. “Hey, I made breakfast, if you’re interested.”
Harry snuggled into Draco’s hug and rubbed his eyes. “I did tell Ron! But he just said I need to go back to sleep. It’s just a dream.” It was barely a whisper at the end.
“It is?” Harry asked in a weak and trembling voice. He turned to look at Draco who put both his arms around him again, hugging him tightly.
“Sounds scary.” Draco frowned and felt the arms around him tighten as if to show that he was safe now.
Draco knew exactly what he meant... Internally, he was trying to figure out if Benjamin would ask more. He was saved however, by Potter.
“’Mione, what are you even trying to prove anymore? That you’re the smartest witch around Hogwarts? We know that already” Ron started his rant and while he followed his girlfriend trough the almost hip high snow, Harry turned back to Malfoy.
“I do” Blaise said and stuck out his tongue, when Pansy glared at him. “You know I was joking, right? I just don’t want to be left alone with baby Potter.”
Should he ask Neville... he would probably either find a plant to give him the motivation and courage to ask someone our or he would... who knows? Tell him to go for it?
Eric chuckled. “To be honest, I’ve never seen someone fighting more reckless than you do. Last time we fought together I saw you sneak up on a wizard until you basically stood behind him to fight. No one would have done that!”
They stayed quiet for a few moments, until the twin with an F walked into the room, frowning. “Hey, have you seen Harry? We’ve been looking for him for a while now. No one has seen him. We... we can't seem to find him.”
“Potter” Draco spat and his eyes twinkled for just a second. Harry knew he enjoyed this so much, he would have loved to laugh loudly, dance his adrenaline away and kiss him square on the face.
“Of course I had something to do with that!” Harry frowned, before he smirked. “Skeeter said I had the Dark Mark on me, she threw together some weird picture which was clearly faked and then had the audacity to tell the public that I had ‘finally turned against all that was holy in the Wizarding World’. How was I supposed to just let her continue with that?”
“It’s his fourth year, Severus. He’s having quite a few bad nightmares. All about the cemetery, Diggory dying and all the other things surrounding the Triwizard Tournament” Draco explained and sighed.
“It’s the Potter family tree” Malfoy remarked and brushed even more names out of the dust. Harry almost couldn’t tear his eyes away from the movement the Slytherin was doing.
While Harry threw a glare at her, Draco walked into the room with the cutlery, looking a little surprised. Harry jumped up and took a few knives which were about to fall down out of his hands.
“I think I will be escorting you to our living room, then” Ron winked at her and then turned to Harry. “Anything you need from me tonight?”
“It’s Luna, Ron. I’m sure she manages to get in wherever she wants. She knows all kinds of secret passages” Hermione explained, giving him a pointed look, since he hadn’t gotten back to reading the book. She then turned to Harry about to say something, when once again, she was interrupted by someone. This time, it was her boyfriend.
While Harry looked around the room, he heard Ron growling. “Hermione, this doesn’t make sense! Why would they start a law against whatever these blood potions are, when they haven’t even been tested by that time?!”
“If you treat our owls with respect, loyalty is a given.” The worker sounded extremely bored. That was not what Draco remembered his visits being. Most workers were extremely careful and loving with their animals. For this man, it just seemed to be another job to get money. “We can offer you very intelligent owls, or maybe you’d appreciate social ones more? It’s really whatever you want.”
Daphne grinned. “There must be other things, right Draco? He’s your husband; you should know a lot of things about him?”
It had rained shortly after Harry had run away from the group. He knew that very well as he had used one of the very few remaining secret entrances to the castle to get in without being seen and he had managed to stay dry luckily. However, the way he had said it… basically everyone at the table would know that he hadn’t stayed in the forest until the club meetings had started.
“I fear that people only see me as the things I have done in the past. Not the person I am. The person I became because of everything that I did” he said quietly. Harry looked up at him and nodded.
I miss thou so much - the house is so quiet without thou. The days canst not end quick enough for me and I dream of thou 'i mine arms. I sit under the willow trees, looking up at the birds, flying free, being themselves. I would this could be us. Flying aroint from our homes. Alas, it canst not be - not now. Thou are still on mine mind, mine stunning Flower. I shall hast to wait with all mine love till we meet again. Prithee join back at Christmas, mine issue doesn't hast any suspicions for now. Father and Mother are out most of the day and we could be together again.
Draco scoffed and shook his head, snuggling once again into Harry’s side. “Wake me for something important” he murmured.
And once again, Harry interrupted him, this time he seemed almost angry. “I know what you think, Draco! But the reality is that everything was my mistake!
“It was beautiful! She lit up almost the whole pitch with wind resistant candles!” Luna said and had almost half closed eyes as if she could see it right now again.
Daphne had serious trouble keeping a straight face and Draco also needed a few moments to restrain himself. Harry felt his hand on his leg squeezing, most likely telling him that he was going to hear a shit storm once they were alone.
“I’m also happy to be back.” Remus looked over the lake that was today exceptionally beautiful. He did quickly turn back to Harry and Draco, smirking at the latter. “How is your studying going? Transfiguration?”
Draco couldn’t suppress a grin. For whatever reason – maybe because Evan was here and he needed to seem happy. “That’s no problem. I completely understand why you didn’t do that.”
“Some people use the silence of the night as a creative outlet.” Severus chuckled and beckoned him into the room.
Draco shook his head, slightly grinning. Pansy was the one to speak up next. She chuckled and greeted the woman. “Good evening, Miss Soames, it’s also nice to finally meet you!”
Harry shivered and pulled his jacked closer while he looked to his left, where Draco was walking. His eyes were so attentive to every small detail, which were probably all the lights in the small Muggle village a few miles away from the Weasley home. He should have definitely apparated closer, but he just wanted to see Draco’s expressions. Yesterday in the Christmas market had been the same awe-struck expressions at all the lights.
Yeah, he couldn’t do that with everyone sitting around and listening in on their conversation. Ron and Hermione who had been sitting closest to him already looked very intrigued. Harry smiled and walked over to his friends.
“I don’t know.” Draco said and shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “It’s a magical scar, you can’t fix those.”
“Oh my… He really is a baby!” she exclaimed and walked over slowly. Weasley shook his head and followed his girlfriend, while Lovegood smiled.
Harry really seemed to have them all figured out. He had named them all. Except for him. Harry sat up and looked at Draco. They were exactly opposite from each other and Draco felt himself breathing faster.
“Apparently” he answered. To which Harry turned back to their professor who wrote down the spell on the blackboard.
Their professor turned back to the class and said loudly “Class dismissed. Leave now!” He cast a protective spell over each cauldron and motioned them all to leave. Draco shrugged his shoulders and followed his friends to their Common Room. Since it was their last lesson of the day, they could now wait for dinner to arrive.
This day had taken a lot of concentration and energy. This was probably the best way to relax, at least in Harry’s head. He hummed and started massaging Draco’s head. He shampooed his hair, cleaned it extra good and made sure to check each and every spot for nonexistent beans and sauce. Draco had already showered at least three times, so there really wasn’t anything left than his own paranoia.
Before he could say something, McGonagall sighed, as she turned to the two of them. “Gentlemen, is there not one single meal where we can have some peace between you two. I
“Anytime. Enjoy breakfast” she said with a hint of anticipation in her eyes. She was most certainly waiting for Draco to arrive and for the whole situation to end in utter and complete chaos.
Harry was quiet and watched Severus, before he nodded. “Thank you!” He suddenly turned to look at Draco and Pansy. “Hey! I made a potion!”
Draco shook his head. “No! Why aren’t you home? I had quite a hard day and I was actually looking forward to snuggle with someone and then you’re not there. It’s almost eleven!”
Draco closed the door and walked back to the Common Room, where he found Pansy already sitting in their favorite place. She seemed to have spotted him, since she looked up and grinned broadly.
Harry nodded. This situation needed patience more than anything else. Hermione really had messed with their relationship – with their trust in each other. He smiled at his husband softly and shrugged his shoulders. “I can stop any time I want to. I can stop right now, if you’d prefer that.”
“They have his scar!” the witch said and she narrowed her eyes as if she believed Hermione was the one who should have known that.
The third person in this room seemed to confuse the Malfoy patriarch quite a lot. “I’m not… Mr. Potter, what are you doing here?”
He then rubbed his ward’s back in circles and tried to calm him down this way. Harry fell back in his bed and started crying, even though he tried his hardest to keep it inside. Draco held his shoulder and vanished the bucket, before sitting down closer to his ward.
Hearing this, Draco almost tore up and he quickly cleared his throat. “I have a little problem. You know how I wanted this matchmaker thing for the Ball only?” He stopped, actively waiting for Harry to answer this question.
Shaking his head, Potter lifted himself up into a sitting position. He groaned and rubbed his temples. “He’s not big on wine. He prefers beer.”
“Quite a bit, yeah” she answered and grinned. “I’m still a little confused by what are memories and what isn’t, but all in all, we’re on a road to recovery.”
Draco Malfoy agreed and rolled his eyes. “It’s almost as if they want to scare us into fearing for our lives, since most Slytherins hadn’t felt extreme fear during the war.”
Draco shook his head; it hurt him seeing his ward like that. And Harry was making himself responsible for his godfather’s death? “Harry, that’s not true! He would have…”
On the bar sat another younger man. He had black hair, almost as black as Potter’s himself and was in the middle of a story talking to the Gryffindor who kept interrupting him to through around some mildly amusing comments.
However with time, Draco had figured out why he had it bad for these movies: It was the small movements that got him. The male character slightly looking up, lopsided grin on his face, when he turned back to whatever he was doing and the female character catching this grin.
“Don’t mention it. I’m glad you enjoyed it” Draco smirked, when Potter rolled his eyes, but couldn’t stop himself from giggling.
Groaning, he fell on his back and stared at the clouds, rushing through the gray sky. He placed his hands over his face and breathed in the cold autumn air, hoping to know what to do once it had filled his lungs completely. Of course it didn’t happen.
“Thank you Professor Snape” Harry answered grinning, clearly mocking politeness. “Please come back as soon as you can, Mr. Snape!”
His godson nodded and the head vanished again. Harry smirked and went back inside, leaving the door open. The fresh morning breeze filled up the air and the soft wind that invaded the space seemed to play with the roses on the living room table. The two wizards in the picture – which Draco had finally figured out where Assad and William – waved as Harry walked by and he waved back, grinningly.
Harry waved as Hermione and Ron made their way to the dormitories. Sighing, he opened the door to the Common Room and stood face to face with a blond wizard. He smirked and tilted his head slightly, when Draco grabbed his shirt and pulled him out of the room.
“I’ll make sure to tell him that he doesn’t have to hide anymore from the Slytherin gang” Neville added and put an arm around his girlfriend. Pansy snickered and shook her head.
Harry was gobsmacked and stared at Eric, when he found his pointy ears again. It really did look like the man escaped a fairy tale book. “Is Alamar also a fairy?” he asked.
Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “That’s just practical knowledge, Theo. When you’re on the run you can’t really take huge things with you, so we shrunk everything. Most things, actually, not everything.”
Looking at Draco, Harry moved his hand up to his cheek. “Darling” he said softly and moved to a kneeling position. “You do not have to be afraid of that.”
Nott shook his head. “No. I tried to get through, but only objects could pass the magical barrier. So our clothes, basically.”
Hermione chuckled and nodded. “It’s actually easy. Remember ‘adult’. Acacia, Dahlia leaves, Umbrella Pines, Lantana and Thyme. You’ll need some more things but these are the main ingredients.”
Harry shook his head, while he continued petting Aurora who rolled into a ball as well, lying in the little boy’s lap, purring happily. “This is my bedroom. It’s close to the kitchen, so I can start breakfast easier.”
“Don’t look so skeptical, Draco. I’ve taught you the same tricks. Your parent’s only never wanted them to be put to test. Purebred owls and things like that” he rolled his eyes. He actually rolled his eyes.
It took about ten minutes, until his ward started panting heavily and he tore the blindfold from his eyes, turning to his side and started puking onto the floor. Draco had just had enough time to jump out of his reach and looked at his ward cautiously.
Nodding, Harry fell back into the chair and shrugged. Luna took the plates and cast a spell that started cleaning everything. From the hallway, Harry heard a sudden familiar deep voice talking next to Ginny’s.
“Neville, that’s awesome! With a little time, you could be an amazing teacher! I know it!” Harry smiled broadly. He was really happy that Neville had found something that was clearly giving him some joy.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Hell no, Draco. Your monologue didn’t need me. You were awesome!”
As predicted, the worker seemed genuinely upset. “You don’t understand: He’s unable to show trust or even to let someone close to him. We have to feed him by throwing his food at him…” He threw his hands in the air, though stopped in the middle of doing so.
A whole pile of snow fell down onto the twins (just a little revenge for having lost sight of Harry). The room was filled with muffled screams from under the snow and after a second, there was a huge fit of laughter following out of the cupboard.
“They’re about Harry.” She smirked, while Draco widened his eyes. That couldn’t be true, right? He had only taken four or five of him… “You took some amazingly beautiful pictures, but look at that!” She presented him both piles and Draco bit his lower lip. They were exactly the same size. He made exactly as many pictures of Harry alone than he did with everybody.
“What?” Draco asked and stood there, half through the door. Half his face was hidden in the shadows and with his dark blue button up shirt and his slightly wild hair, Harry could almost feel his knees weaken. He looked so damn good! So freaking handsome… He looked quite intrigued, when the doorbell sounded again, this time even knocks could be heard.
Harry sat down on the piano stool. He opened the fallboard and placed his fingers on the keys. Before he played anything, he looked back at Draco and took his hands away.
Their daughter walked back and hugged Harry as well. She beamed at him. “Can I be a happy memory as well, Dad?”
“This is crazy!” Dean said, shaking his head. “How did we not see that?! You played us all like a piano, like Daphne said!”
The mediwitch smiled at him and let them go. Before they left however, she made Draco promise that he would give the nutrition potion once every other day to his ward as a precaution. And well, Draco agreed. Seeing the Injury Parchment, Draco was sure that there were a lot of other foodless days.
Nicolai shrugged his shoulders. “Surprise me.” He smirked quickly. “But I will be taking this as a sign for what our future might hold. So choose wisely.”
Smirking, Draco followed how Harry showed incredible elegance, jumping over things, slithering under a table, changing directions with only minor problems. Blaise had after two minutes had enough and he stopped, panting, in the middle of the court.
Opening the door, he smiled and walked through. Padfoot looked carefully at the Headmistress, having only seen her once. Harry was sure he could smell that she was a cat Animagus. “Profe….ah, I am so sorry, Minerva. I don’t think I’ll ever grow out of calling you Professor McGonagall” Harry chuckled and shook his head.
“But this is so perfect!” Draco complained, looking up at Harry with a dark expression. At least he hoped it was a dark expression.
“If we knew where you were we could talk about which owl to send. But also, my mother sent Errol” Draco heard Weasley talk. Potter grinned and rolled his eyes.
The best thing he could come up with was rolling his eyes. “Oh that” he snorted. “That’s just some random color. Don’t worry about it.” He was delighted in seeing Ron’s suspicious glance at him, before he narrowed his eyes and looked at the red color again.
“You Gryffindors have no idea how to protect yourself in this snow” Malfoy commented and made Harry laugh slightly. The Slytherin held out his hand for Hermione and helped her get up again. It was still a miracle to Harry how quickly Malfoy had gotten rid of his ‘evil persona’ after Azkaban. And now, even Hermione didn’t seem bothered by him being around them. Though Harry did realize she didn’t seem to care at all. Not like him, who was still somewhat looking on how to bump into Malfoy and pretend that he hadn’t stalked him on the Marauder’s Map all evening long.
His ward giggled and ran towards Pansy. Draco got to his feet, clapped his hands and pretended to run after Potter as fast as he could.
Neville chuckled and shook his head, kissing the top of Pansy’s head. Draco watched Harry smile weakly and then turning back to his other friends. There was something in his eyes, something like… jealousy? How had he never seen something like that?! Maybe Harry was just too tired to hide his true emotions… Or maybe Draco was just interpreting everything wrongly!
Chuckling, Severus shook his head. “You do not have to take them until you die. Well, if you continue to eat healthy. This potion is going to be less strong
Pansy nodded. “My friend Vanessa signed up for it, because she was always unlucky and within thirty days they found a match and” she shrugged her shoulders, “they have some ritual where they do whatever, but in the end, they actually got married. Yesterday to be exact.” She hesitated for a second and shrugged her shoulders again, as if there had been more she wanted to say, but didn't.
Harry sighed and winced slightly. “I can’t sleep. Well, no I’ve slept, but I had nightmares. I… I think I want to talk about them.” Harry stopped talking and turned to look at him, slightly flustered. “Sorry for waking you up. I have been sitting here for literally twenty minutes, debating whether or not I should wake you up and…”
Harry looked up and carefully held his hand towards the animal. It purred again, rubbing its owl head on his hand. “What’s that? It looks like a cat and an owl.”
Once he was finally done, he walked behind another guard who had such a slow pace that Harry was almost about to push him forward. Just because he wasn’t feeling all too well, didn’t mean that he couldn’t walk a normal pace. Though… he was slightly glad he wasn’t running. And he had seriously underestimated the amount of walking. Azkaban was already draining all magic from his core... at least the little amount he had left anymore.
“Thank you. I’m actually here to talk to...” Before he could finish what he had wanted to say, Weasley interrupted him.
As if he had seen a boat in the middle of an ocean, Harry raced out of bed and down the stairs to find Draco sitting on a sofa with a blanket over his lap. As soon as he entered, the Slytherin looked up and got up as well. He manoeuvred Harry to sit down and kneeled before him.
His friend stopped at the doorframe and leaned on it, shrugging his shoulders again. “Still not an answer. Do you want me to ask you again?”
She smiled broadly and took Harry’s hand, leading him over to Merlin. Draco got up from the floor and sat down on the couch, watching his small family, while checking up on Caellum as well. Lily had gotten hold of a magical mouse toy and made it run across the floor while Merlin raced after it. Harry helped along with some magic, though it was clear that their daughter had quite a lot of magic at her disposal.
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked worriedly. He ignored Pansy’s triumphant looks into his direction. He was well aware that he had lost his fight with trying to pretend he didn’t care about Harry.
Laughing over this surprise, George shook his head. “I cannot believe it! Harry Potter! In my shop! I need to call the newspaper!”
Brushing the sauce from his face and using a cleaning charm on his shirt, Harry couldn’t stop giggling from what he had just done. Breakfast had just turned into almost a theater for the others. Well, for Theodore, Hannah, Pansy and Megan. The others had still been asleep and sadly missed out on the picture perfect theater piece Draco and he had put on.
Harry frowned and Draco thought he had seen an idea pop into his head. “I thought only people of the same family could take someone’s name?” What was he up to?
Harry walked around the corner, heading to the Great Hall for breakfast, and was immediately yanked behind a portrait. He almost yelled something, when Draco held his mouth closed. The Slytherin smirked and shook his head. Harry was happy that he had told Hermione and Ron to go ahead, they would have immediately jumped after him, had they see that happening.
“These are my students you’re talking about!” Harry couldn’t keep a straight face and started laughing.
All he received was loud laughter and Harry rubbed his forehead, still incredibly ashamed of Toby having witnessed something that clearly wasn’t meant for him. He needed to tell Draco as soon as possible, just to have this horrible feeling off his chest. And maybe Draco would come up with some evil plan as well.
Nodding, Draco crawled to the edge of the bed, kissing Harry softly, before he released him again. “That’s why purebloods used to keep an eye on potions like these and if you took it and the person who should have been your mate, decided not to go through with it, your family had to imprison you, literally tie you down for seven days.”
Potter grinned and held his hands out for Draco. He did notice how surprised Pansy looked, when he smiled fondly at his ward and lifted him from the ground and put him onto his lap. “You’ve been awake for some time, haven’t you, Potter?”
inhibition of magical control, hindrance in eye sight, containment of animal language (exception: snakes), food surveillance, disdain mechanism against Slytherins
From the corner of his eyes, he could see Minerva chuckling quietly, while Hannah placed the board down, seemingly deciding to give up and start doing the club meetings. Harry grinned at the cards in his hands, enjoying the little chaos he was creating. Draco needed to step up his game, if he wanted to be seen as an active participant rather than the victim. He was not going to stand by and let the victim-card be his calling-card. Draco was surely going to figure out something in time for the Quidditch game at four. Harry couldn’t
“Holy shit, Weasley! That was one hell of an apology! I don’t think anyone could apologize better than that! Of course we forgive you!” she laughed.
The Saviour sat down again and Aaron joined their table. He looked a little lost and rubbed his temples, when Potter finally asked what was haunting him. The young man sighed heavily and shook his head. “My father is fighting for my custody. He thinks I’m not happy here, just because he hasn’t been happy here. I told him that in two weeks I’d be of age, but he’s trying to get me to live in London, so I’d be closer to the university, but I haven’t even decided which one I want to attend. And I’m not sure I even want to go to London.”
After lunch which Ginny and Luna cooked together, while Harry sat at the table reading a booklet Ginny had printed to get people to fund research on what Luna saw, a loud knock on the front door made everyone look up.
“What happened to your old house?” Draco frowned, unsure of what to think. Harry owned this awesome apartment? They could – theoretically – live here?
His damn jealousy was back. For some reason, he wanted Potter all to himself. The way he beamed at him and his happiness was all he needed. Especially right now. However, he couldn’t just take him away from his friends even though he didn’t know them very well now. Well, it had never stopped Potter from talking or playing with them.
Pansy smirked. “Which is why I’m going to ask him today.” With that she walked out and it took Draco about five seconds, before he realized what that meant. Widening his eyes, he raced out of his room, almost crashing into Theodore, before evading him at the last second.
“Hermione Jean Weasley!” he called through the room. When Hermione looked at him, clearly trying to be innocent, he raised his eyebrows. “I know what your magic feels like! Why would you do that?”
The man chuckled and looked around. His soft laugh was so warm and welcoming as if he was hugging Boy only through his vocal cords alone. When he finally looked back at Boy, he still had a soft and honest smile. “Well, I’ve seen you working, ever since we moved into that house” he pointed at Mrs. Figg’s old house. “And I think I saw your family drive away and leave you outside. So, I wanted to ask: Are you okay?”
“You suck, Ze!” Draco rolled his eyes, though couldn’t keep himself from smirking while he did so. Besides Blaise asking stupid questions, it felt good being with them. They did know him pretty well.
While he held onto the corner stones, Harry slithered around the corner and continued running up the stairs to the entrance area. When Draco, Blaise and Pansy followed, Draco had seen Hermione standing around the entrance and he was sure she had started to follow them as well once they all passed her.
He turned around and walked back into the Common Room, where Pansy placed her ten books about the new Muggle laws into a neat pile, and shook his head. “Pans, have you seen Harry in the last few hours?”
Harry smirked. If they would have listened or talked with each other, they would have realized that he had gone to repair a machine, however, apparently, they had other ideas. Could Draco and he really get away with pretending that Harry went to a lover?
“She will continue to do this until we’re out of here, isn’t she?” Harry asked, though his annoyed voice did not match his amused expression.
“Well, it might not happen, Ze.” Theodore rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “I think what might happen is Harry freaking out over being in Slytherin, him racing up the Gryffindor Common Room and hiding there until he’s in his normal age again.”
Kira bowed mockingly. “Then I believe I need to tell you my full name as well, huh? I’m Kyreena Harmony Radella Rogers. Not married, so no other last name. I think my three first names are quite enough.”
Rolling his eyes, Potter sighed. “And you came by at one in the morning just to tell me that? I’m actually way too tired to deal with your crap right now.”
“Listen Pansy, I am hereby officially sorry for not writing, not calling and whatever else I didn’t do that I could have done. I had a lot to work on with my vaults and stuff and the Ministry was really going hard with the ‘do not contact anybody while you’re training’ shit they’re doing right now.” Harry rolled his eyes, also quite annoyed by what had happened.
Pansy glared at him. “How did nobody do anything against this? He was being abused! He’s only two years old and already had twice as many life events and injuries on his parchment… Did you see the bullet point before the broken arm? He’s living
“Very funny, Draco” Harry rolled his eyes, though he seemingly couldn’t bite back a smirk. “No, McGonagall said she’s already eaten and the other visions have left already.”
Draco smirked and after a short shower, he was back with his ward, who sat at his desk, reading some books about Transfiguration. McGonagall had allowed him to go and see whether or not he would understand the lessons, since they were rather difficult, he had the option of going to other levels should he not understand them. But well, he was rather focused on understanding everything.
Draco shook from all his crying and Harry made sure to kiss his earlobe, continuing to whisper all the things he loved about him, how much he loved him, how safe he was with him. Nobody could do anything to him right now. Harry would fight Death himself to keep Draco safe tonight. And he knew with Padfoot close, there was absolutely nothing that could hurt him.
Before he headed to the Leaky, Harry walked back to his office to place the folder in his archive and celebrate that they had once again gotten two people together. Once again, he decided to apparate and almost fell onto Kevin, who had just entered his office.
Now Olivia and James were laughing and the girl almost spilt her coke, while Potter smirked at them. Draco wondered if he had ever seen the Saviour more relaxed than now. It looked like he was in his element.
Listening with wide eyes and the attention of a lioness about to strike, Harry had almost forgotten his real life, when shortly after the end, he heard a car driving by and Eric looked up.
“Oh yeah, Toby’s the boss in our pizzeria. We usually call each other around twice a month or just whenever there’s a problem.” Harry smirked. “Or when he wants you guys to think that I’m having an affair behind my husband’s back. Come one, guys, why would I ever? I love Draco!”
“I just wanted to know how you would ask someone out, if you liked them?” Strange how easy it was to ask that question...
Finally, he heard Toby chuckle. “What are you doing, Harry? We both know you are too much in love with Draco to be flirting with me. And we also know that I’m neither gay not bi, so… what are you doing?”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know. Maybe it was why everything here is in a mess? The person writing this must have been in a sudden fight and had to flee or was taken away before they could finish this letter.”
He hurried over to the stairs, checking for something and while there wasn’t a cupboard under the stairs, there was a hatch in the walls, quite possibly leading to a storage room. Draco softly knocked at the door and carefully opened it. The door definitely needed to be oiled, since it opened with a loud creaking noise.
“And without Dumbledore realising that, right?” Eric asked and leaned back in his chair. It was quiet for a few moments, before a malicious smirk appeared on his lips. “Alright, challenge accepted.”
Maybe he could get a Time Turner from somewhere and re-do this whole situation. Deducing from Neville’s grin, he had probably realized what Harry was thinking of. Harry simply shook his head and sighed quietly.
They weren’t the only ones there: Luna Lovegood sat in a chair, Ginny next to her and even Longbottom placed himself on the other side of the table. He caught Pansy’s eye and smiled at her. Draco found that it was a rather nice and trustworthy smile – even though it hadn’t been for him.
“DADA to Ron, Arithmancy to Susan, Herbology to Blaise… no to Dean and Potions to Blaise. That’s all so far. Who knows what comes next. Maybe I’ll just hire my whole year.”
“Right” Pansy said for the second time this morning. And once again, Harry felt as if she knew exactly what was going on here.
“That I figured out a long time ago, Potter” the Slytherin grinned. “At precisely the moment, when Wilson was outed by this idiot Roberts and you just nonchalantly outed yourself. That moment was epic.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. “There are some logical mistakes in that sentence, love. I’ll tell you what: I’m going to see Severus, Madam Pomfrey and even McGonagall. Once I did all of that, I’ll come back into your arms. How does that sound?”
“I…” Harry stared at Draco. As crazy as it seemed to say these words after their first… well second kiss, he knew exactly what Draco felt. He felt the same. “I love you too, Draco. Very much so.”
Draco chuckled. “If you don’t mind, I have quite a few papers to get ready for Friday. Would it be okay, if I came back in an hour to grab Harry?”
Draco got up and grabbed the plates. “I’ll clean up, while you get the door” he offered and Potter nodded. Sighing, Draco closed the kitchen door and leaned against it. How could he say ‘by the way, I’m Draco Malfoy and I’m trying to get you back to London for another Death Eater trial’... without telling it like that.
Nights like this, where even one step out of the house would result in one being soaked with rain, punished by a cold unfeeling wind and hurt by the sound of a close lightning and thunder crashing towards the earth and creating chaos upon the living creatures. And no, he didn’t like it because of all of this. He actually hated the uncomfortable feeling of damp clothes on his skin, the unforgiving wind changing one’s body into an ice cube and the earsplitting sound emerging from the sky with every bolt.
“Definitely!” Pansy answered and winked at her Gryffindor. Neville shook his head, though the smirk on his face revealed that he had only been joking, right alongside Harry and Pansy.
“Truth be told, Draco: I’m not straight, I’m very much bisexual. Lily figured it out quicker than I did.” Severus had once again an uncharacteristically soft smile on his face. “She didn’t push me away, but embraced me and we went out to hunt for our partners.”
“I don’t like these stories” Harry admitted and they walked down the final flight of stairs, where Harry once again, concentrated on all the portraits along the walls. All of these people were looking old and almost tired.
Nodding weakly, Draco traced Harry’s cheekbone, making him look at him again. “True. You did look a little evil, but she had it coming. And it’s not as if you’re running around torturing everyone you see. You had a good reason to do so.”
Sighing, Draco nodded. “Of course, Mother.” He had seen this coming ever since he had seen how elegant his mother had been dressed and even though he had tried to be somewhat elegant with his black clothes… it wasn’t a real surprise to him. He walked through the Manor, while his emotions changed between an unsurprising kind of disappointment and the strong feeling of being angry. He still wasn’t enough for his mother, no matter how he presented himself.
A lot of voices called through the house. Everyone was looking for the little boy. Lovegood checked behind the Christmas tree, the twins systematically looked into all of the rooms, Molly even prepared a spell that could locate Draco’s ward. By now, even Granger and Weasel had come out and helped looking through all the rooms. Weaslette stayed in the kitchen, looking at all of the cupboards and…
How are you doing? You haven’t answered my last text and if you’re not going to answer this one, I’ll be coming by and see for myself how you are.
Shrugging his shoulder, Harry cleared his throat. “I don’t know. But I won’t be back immediately. My pizzeria has a little problem, where I need to go check something quickly.”
that, Malfoy! You were and still are an idiot, a pussy and a stupid, little shit! You think just because you and your family once were the height of society, that you still deserve…”
Before Draco could answer, the door was opened and Pansy walked into the garden, three apples already ready as well as a tomato mozzarella salad. Potter squealed and ran towards her, which she somehow hadn’t anticipated, as the salad flew into the air.
At dinner, neither Potter nor Severus showed up. Neither did McGonagall or Madam Pomfrey. The staff table looked a little empty that way, though Draco didn’t care much. The food was delicious, the company fine and not having to see Potter during dinner made him grin widely. Most Slytherins were just talking about stupid things and Draco only listened with one ear when Severus suddenly stood in front of him.
Draco shook his head, bringing Harry back to what was going on right now. “I’m sure everyone there would have liked someone else to be with you?”
The nightmares had continued, though not as vicious as that one night, though still bad. Draco had woken up that last night to find Harry hiding under the covers, crying. And even though he had told him, that he could always come and wake him up, Harry had apparently decided not to disturb him. That would be fine, but not with how disturbed and scared Harry was right then.
, Harry thought and braced himself for impact as Susan literally jumped over the table which made some of the professors at the other table look up surprised and Harry was sure he heard Professor Sinistra clapping.
Before Draco could say something, Harry actually pulled him onto his lap and slightly looked up at him. After the first surprise, Draco grinned, leaning in and softly touching Harry’s lips with his own.
“And what am I then?” Draco asked and smirked. “Am I not real?” He touched his arm and pretended to be looking at himself, while little Harry actually showed a ghost of a smile. “Do you think I’m a ghost?” Draco asked, touching his arm again.
Draco smiled softly and turned to look at Harry. How was he the one lucky enough to have the literal Savior as a husband when so many women and men had tried to get him?! Well, yes, they had nothing on him, Draco knew that. Harry and he had played such a long term cat and mouse game; it was basically inevitable for them not to end up together.
“Why?” Harry looked at Padfoot. That was probably a weird question to ask if someone told him they were looking for him.
“You’re just saying that because I’m here and you’d rather be in my arms than study for school” Harry explained and Draco shrugged his shoulders.
Frowning, he got up and followed his godfather’s quick paste towards the Hospital Wing. “Severus, what’s going on?” he asked curiously. He never received an answer and he also hadn’t thought that his godfather would be answering him. He seemed somehow deep in thought.
“Lost?” someone suddenly asked and Draco turned around and was faced with none other than Harry Potter.
“Thinking back, we should have just let the Hat put us there!” Fred turned to his brother who rolled his eyes and hit his brother with some paper over the head. As soon as the paper touched his head, it exploded in a huge glitter bomb.
She crossed her arms over her chest and finally shook her head. “I cannot believe that you prioritized Draco and Harry’s relationship over me, Mr. future Head Auror!”
His husband sighed, though it was all in dramatics, as Draco was sure he liked it as much as he did. “I could go for some pizza, now. Just forget everything.”
“I’m just thinking of the next five horrendous days upon us” Harry answered and sighed. Draco grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the sofa, where the Slytherin then sat down next to him. Their silver rings lit up for a second.
“Yeah, I don’t know where that came from.” She hugged him still with the wine glasses and the bottle in her hands and motioned him to follow her into the kitchen. “How’s the class reunion?”
However, in order to avoid looking at Draco completely love-struck even in public, Harry had not even said goodbye and simply walked out, whistling for Padfoot to follow him and he headed to the water. For some reason, when he sat down by the lake, he started to cry. For the life of him, he couldn’t figure out why thousands of tears ran down his cheek, since he was neither frustrated, nor sad. Was it possible to cry out of pure happiness, pure bliss?
Ian came back twice the next day. Once, during the morning, when Potter had his door opened for Connor and Evelyn, who was selling some fish, and once for something to eat in the afternoon.
Lovegood smiled, handing Weaslette the last few toys that were scattered around the floor, before she turned to Draco. “Through the Magical Guardian’s Test you create a sort of bond between two beings. If he chose you through the test it means that he trusts you. Unconditionally.”
“Hmm” Harry said narrowing his eyes. Draco could tell there was a lot of stuff going on in his head. “So, I already am your son?”
Severus chuckled and nodded. “Pansy Parkinson said that?” he asked as if he didn’t believe it to be true.
Holy shit, Harry, whatever you do…. DO NOT DRINK COFFEE TODAY! Do not accept anything from Pansy or actually anybody! I just caught her pouring Amortentia into a cup and telling Blaise to hand it to you when you’re coming down for breakfast. Be cautious of anything today!
“That guy Draco went to the Quidditch match with was Raphaél and he works for me in the book store. He’s part of the international research team” Harry explained and winked at Daphne. “And he’s always up for a little game. Though he told Draco that he won’t continue playing his boyfriend, as there were too many hostile people around Hogwarts.”
He hadn’t been alone for even two hours, when the door to the office opened again. This time however, Harry hadn’t really heard it. He was still studying a profile which could match one of the other customers and whistling to the new Christmas song on the radio.
“I think it’s from Professor Lupin” she said, while Harry sat down on the sofa telling Millicent and Theodore all about his adventure with the Patronus. Draco was sure that Millicent quickly pushed a tear out of her face when he talked about what he was thinking about.
Draco turned to Harry, his eyes glaring darkly. He probably placed all the hatred and annoyance he was feeling towards Hermione into this glare. “This has to stop, you fucking
Pansy had a blanket in her arms, Theodore carried a tray full of hot chocolate and Millicent was bringing a Muggle TV out, while Blaise had his arms full with food and on top of that a few snacks. It warmed his heart to see his friends so caring and by his side, even though this was something he had to go through alone, pretty much.
Blaise turned to Draco and the new arrivals and quickly told them what Harry had said before. “So, we only need to figure out who his wife is.”
His friend rolled her eyes. “Come on, Draco. You know I’ve always wanted a big family. I like children and I cannot pretend that Potter is an ugly baby or” she stopped, looked at him and smiled then weakly, “… or an unhappy child. I mean, look how constantly happy he is.”
“How so?” Draco asked, since he knew that even though he would never ask Potter about it, Benjamin probably would. He was also interested in the answer the Golden Boy would give an apparent Muggle.
“I have heard what you did to the Slytherins” his voice was hard and unforgiving. Draco had only heard him talk like that when he had talked to the Dark Lord. “I want to speak on their behalf.”
Frowning, Harry took another sip and nodded. That actually made sense in a way that it was just interesting on how people thought about what topics. Will the Slytherins still have a lot of pride in their pureblood thing or will they be more welcoming towards Muggleborn witches and wizards.
Millicent and Theodore bid goodbye the fastest. Pansy hugged Harry as well. “Make sure to survive the night, Harry!”
” he was by now really calm and almost seemed as if he had come to peace with what he was saying. However, it sounded also dangerously close to an actual explosion, “that Sirius died.”
Ginny smirked at him and shook her head. While Molly rushed to the kitchen to get something to drink and Hermione followed her mother-in-law, she put an arm around Harry’s shoulders. “So, what else have you two been up to? I heard a rumour that the Golden Boy has decided to adopt a little boy?”
Sighing, Harry stirred the pot with the pasta again and turned down the gas for the meat and sauce. He walked over to Draco and carefully sat on the opposite side of him. “We were looking for a dark cult which was abducting Muggles. When we found it, this one guy was running away and I went after him together with three other Aurors. He apparated away and I just about caught his ankle. So it was just me and him.” Harry shook his head, when he remembered this evil grin on his face, as if he had wanted this to happen. “Luckily, I had a trace going on myself and the Aurors found me. But it was already too late – he cursed me right when one of the other Aurors cast the death curse.”
It was also nearly curfew and Draco really wanted Harry to be back as soon as possible, so that he could – potentially – snuggle with him in his room until he would fall asleep. What had the world come to?
They separated and grinned at each other. Harry was just about to say something in return, when they heard whispers and quick steps through the dark. Widening his eyes, Harry looked over his shoulder, when Draco pulled him into a door entrance which was giving them enough darkness – well as long as the people didn’t have a very strong light spell.
Draco chuckled and they made their way back through the tunnel into the Common Room. There, Pansy brought him a letter which hadn’t been sent with the usual morning post.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Malfoy.” Maria smiled and nodded. “The Christmas times are always stressful and sometimes we just need a little break.”
Harry raised his eyes at this action, though decided not to comment, when his dog just turned so he now had his arse against Ron’s feet. Shrugging, Harry looked over to the other side, where Draco seemed to be far too pleased with the outcome of this small action and also discussing something – most like Padfoot – with Parvati, while Hermione had narrowed eyes and looked up at Harry. Luckily, he already had a certain annoyance in his face, though mostly because of Ron not acknowledging his dog, so that worked out fine.
Looking up from the drink, Harry smirked. “Well, Mr. Malfoy.” He was clearly mocking the Malfoy patriarch, even though neither of Draco’s parents were realizing it. “I wasn’t aware of the fact that I had to stay polite while you could be aggressive. Is that pureblood behavior?” He asked so innocently, yet Draco could see his eyes lighting up. He was glad that he hadn’t needed to be alone here.
The tall man smiled at him and held the roses towards him. “These are for you. It’s our anniversary!”
Draco smirked a little and decided to watch. That was, until Potter turned around and looked at him. He simply mouthed ‘help’, before turning back to his cook. Still smirking, Draco walked next to the strong woman.
Draco still wasn’t sure if he should say anything. He had met with Aaron a few more times and gotten to hear more stories about Ian, the idiot. Apparently, this man had used everyone and only once he was gone had everyone realised the graveness of the situation – especially for Potter. So, him falling in love with Benjamin was probably just... Potter trying to move on somehow.
“Okay, there’s the new Care of Magical Creatures Professor and whenever he’s outside, he brings me something. Last week, he made a dream catcher out of Thestral hairs and it looks like the head of a horse.”
“We should go down and see what we can use to get out of here” Ron said and sighed as he walked past Harry. He created light, put his wand between his teeth and started to climb down.
Harry got up and brushed the snow from his robes, though it was a stupid task as with the thick snowflakes the amount of snow on his robe was endless. So instead, he shrugged at his former school nemesis. “I believe I didn’t understand anything, except for my name.”
Pansy threw her feet over the edge of the bed. “Why did you do that?” She frowned and explained what she meant. “I don’t want to hear that you did it because you felt bad for me or because that’s what best friends do. Why did you do it?”
He didn’t have time to finish, as Weasley stood right in front of him, hands outstretched towards baby Potter. Panic rushed through Draco’s body and he jumped up, hugging Potter and held out a hand to stop the other Gryffindor.
He couldn’t let Draco sleep in another room – not in this state. And it was nice having his husband so close to him again. His amazingly masculine smell, his soft hair and skin. He needed Draco close tonight and he knew that his husband was in no state tonight to fall asleep right now.
“Why did you let me make a match if you’re telling me right now that…” Harry threw his hands in the air and slammed them on his kitchen table.
“Don’t trust what he says” Alamar whispered and winked at Harry. “He’s got a personal trunk full of my letters and he keeps re-reading them almost every other day.” His laughter was so warm and clearly in love.
Evan nodded and turned to him. “I know! You said it again and again. And I thought about it and I decided that this wasn’t good enough. Your reason isn’t good enough for me. I want us to be in a relationship and what better time to get back together than right now! Christmas time is best celebrated as a couple and we’ve always made a perfect duo.”
Draco thanked him and he left again, with Harry following him closely. Once they stood outside on the steps of the bank, Harry shook his head. “I forgot how creepy they were.”
Hermione linked arms with Harry and pulled him towards the Three Broomsticks, following Ron, Neville, Blaise and Pansy. He followed willingly, happy to be around his friends. However, he did look around to see where his lovely husband was off to.
“My point is... how can anybody like the lonely and dark dungeons?!” He asked, throwing his hands into the air, while water drops almost created a rainbow. Harry giggled at this.
A rather huge goblin walked up to him and tried to put his arms around his waist, though he didn’t quite manage. “Dwarfbart, how are you?”
Looking like he had just come from a make-out session – or even more – he walked into the Great Hall. There were so many eyes on him that he almost couldn’t keep a straight face. Well, Minerva sure as hell couldn’t, though luckily nobody looked at her, as his appearance seemed to be the most important thing on this Earth. Whispers broke out and even a few angry stares from mostly Slytherin and a few Ravenclaws came his way, though Harry smiled at all of them as if he didn’t know what was wrong with him.
Harry smirked. “That is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Once we’re through, it’ll close again.”
Draco stared at the page. His mother had been released? He felt jealousy bubble up to the surface as he looked at the writing. While she hadn’t officially been a Death Eater, she had also been in bed with them. The Dark Lord had trusted her very much, especially for a Non-Death Eater.
Baby Potter looked at her, squealed shortly, before saying something sounding like ‘mama’ and got up with some difficulties and walked over to her, holding himself at the table. Pansy smiled broadly, lifted him up and placed him in her lap, before accio’ing the teddy Potter seemed to love so dearly. “You are an amazing baby boy!”
Nigel placed a booklet on the kitchen table and grabbed one of Aurora’s meat balls before he headed out again. Aurora just tapped into the kitchen when Nigel left and she looked at her food as if she knew exactly what had happened to it.
Potter closed the door and slowly walked up the stairs, basically dragging an extremely tired Draco behind him. This time, Draco was realizing how the Gryffindor brought him to the Saviour’s room, but he couldn’t even care about it.
He turned away and walked around the corner to the boarded up windows, hoping he could get a small glance into the house. As luck would have it, he was actually able to spot a board that was only half closing the window. And so he looked through it and found an almost empty looking living room. The yellow couch had probably once been white and the table and chairs had so much dust on them, that it was impossible to see what color they were. A huge picture of a small looking ship was hanging on the opposite wall, with two men standing on board, waving. It seemed to be a magical picture, since they were actually moving.
Sitting up on his chair, Harry looked at Draco, before he got up and grabbed some wine from a cupboard. He knew the house elves were hiding wine and whiskey in there for the professors. Draco and him had found that in their last year, when they had snuck around with the Invisibility Cloak and one of the thousands of DADA professors had taken some while they had been hiding in the kitchen.
No, no, no! Nothing fit what Draco was looking for. Harry groaned and placed the last profile he had laying around on the ‘no’ pile. There was nobody in their data base that matched what he had seen in his newest client the days he had followed him around.
“What?” Harry widened his eyes. He really had hoped that William had been able to get away, find Assad and run away together, marry and live happily until they both died of old age.
White, red, pink and yellow flowers were everywhere, some more common than others, some seemingly incredibly rare and all of them protected in different ways, depending on what the flower seemed to need to most. It was beautiful and Draco almost didn’t want to leave. However, he needed to pick a flower and bring it back to the ritual. He was suddenly drawn to a beautiful deep red flower with a white middle. It looked so happy and strong… Next to it was a flower with deep yellow trumped shaped tepals and a white core. This one was also something he would have liked.
“I didn’t talk about that. To be perfectly honest, I was hoping there was nothing else happening” Pansy said and shrugged her shoulders. She was lying on a couch, her knees bent and feet resting on the sofa – not really pureblood like behavior.
“No wonder they hate each other” Alamar whispered and sighed when he found a tracker on the picture as well. He couldn’t take away the spell without notifying whoever had placed it there. Well, honestly, who else could have put it there but Dumbledore?! “Sorry, Aurora, I can’t take it away. You need to ignore it.”
Did she maybe know more? She couldn’t, right? They had hidden it well enough during school and even now they tried not to make it that obvious.
Opening the door to his ward’s room, he found Harry moving around, as if he was in pain. He seemed to want to get out of a prison or just anything that was holding him back. He kept trying to punch the air and after a few seconds of watching that, Draco decided to forego sleep and helping his ward.
“What? I…” Draco had no way of talking more, trying to get out of this, when he was being dragged off by a clearly excited Harry. Half way to their former professor, Draco started laughing over this ridiculous level of excitement, but he didn’t say anything.
She looked at him carefully. “Then why do I get the feeling that there is something going on between the two of you?”
Harry got up and opened the door just in time to see Draco with a raised hand looking at him with wide eyes.
Since Harry was so secretive, Draco frowned at him. “Death Eaters?” he offered and even Pansy frowned, putting her legs onto the couch as well.
As if the landscape had wanted to show Harry that what he had seen wasn’t gorgeous enough, he saw the most stunning scenery ever. The green grass looked almost juicy and the dark blue lake reached towards the sky at the horizon. There were birds flying at the sky, fishes swam around the center of the lake and there, close to the lake, with a sandy beach almost at the front yard, sat a dandelion yellowy house. Its two stories looked so innocent and the chimney on top seemed to have its own secrets –since magical houses barely had normal working fireplaces.
Draco laughed humorlessly. “Yes, because I have so many friends who I can ask for help. And in all these Christmas love stories you continuously made me watch, an idea like that never went awry.” He made a point in raising his eyebrows, like Pansy usually did. His sarcasm was truely showing.
Finally, Draco got up, pressed one last kiss on his cheek and winked at him. “I’ve got to head back. Now that we pretend that we’re going through a divorce, we
Night came quickly and with that, Draco went to the Room of Requirement to get Potter from the care of Lovegood and Weaslette. Draco suspected that they had also heard about the injury parchment, since they had come by rather early and asked to have some time with his ward, so he could have a free day. It was rather nice, being able to do some work without being interrupted by a toddler who wanted to be entertained.
She looked up with raised eyebrows. “Alright, that’s it!” Even though it seemed harsh, her wide grin showed that she actually wasn’t as mad as she sounded. “Get down here, right now!”
The people around them roared and bellowed and Harry thought it to be the perfect reason to leave this crazy mess of former students and he headed into the castle, checking his watch. If he walked slowly up to the headmistress’ office, he would be there with about ten minutes to spare. He should be able to do that, right?
He turned to his minion and placed a smile on his face. “You see, Severus, I’m trusting you with some very important information.” He grabbed his wand under the table and started another incantation on the potions master. In all honesty, he had lost count of how many spells he had placed on him. Nevertheless, there was no limit of spells on people. “I have found Harry Potter right after his parents had died and I had placed him in a safe house. Now it seems as if someone has taking him away from my protection. We really need to find him, wouldn’t you agree?”
Neither boy was saying anything and Draco finally decided to tell Harry a real fear. He needed to know that Draco wasn’t this superhero kind of person his ward thought he was.
He carefully pressed the door handle and realized that the wood was easily opened. When he peeked into the room, he found an old storage room. There was no other room anywhere, so it must still belong to the magical house the Blacks had created so long ago.
Draco wondered whether or not she made herself responsible for him walking back to Slytherin during the night, since it actually looked that way. Harry shrugged his shoulders and smiled.
When they – finally - entered McGonagall’s office, after having climbed so many stairs that his ward had sat down after a little over half and refused to climb any more for a solid five minutes – he saw her sitting behind her desk. Well, she looked up, before she smiled at them. “Malfoy, be sure to be back before curfew.”
Draco hummed and his fingers moved down from his hair and traced his husband’s features. As he moved over his nose, Harry turned away and opened his eyes to glare at him. Draco chuckled and pulled him into a kiss, before he could say anything. Harry placed his arms around him and pulled him close. He felt him inhale deeply, after they had broken the kiss, and placed a soft peck onto the Savior’s scar.
A look over to Draco made him see that his lovely husband had probably the same need, seeing as Pansy and Blaise were so openly happy and engaged. Draco caught his look and rolled his eyes, though there was a small smirk on his lips.
No mother should be writing this letter knowing that the possibility of anything happening is almost one hundred percent. We don’t know what happened to the Longbottoms, but we hope they’re as safe as we are. We haven’t heard anything from them and I know that they had a baby, which matches Dumbledore’s descriptions as well.
Draco frowned and turned to look at the ceiling, unable to form any clear thoughts. Harry looked at him and smiled, brushing a strain of hair out of his face softly. This loving action made him face his boyfriend again.
Maria laughed as Harry closed the door. He looked around the hallway and decided to just apparate to an alley close to Anita’s Italian restaurant. Turning around, he quickly felt the familiar push and was soon outside in the freezing cold.
“Okay.” Draco frowned and motioned outside, where he just saw a very familiar man. “Then what is Father doing here?”
“See you later, Harry. Sleep tight now.” Alamar smiled and placed a soft charm on Harry’s mattress, so he could sleep well and also a memory charm not to forget their meeting at two. Before Alamar had even closed the door again, Harry was fast asleep.
Harry had also written down a list of all the illegal potions he was getting and once again, he wrote down all the side-effects and problems with the potions. None seemed to work.
“It just... it was an obligation. I didn’t enjoy it anymore.” Harry shrugged his shoulders. Again. “Stay true to yourself, you know.”
“He laughs all the time” Millicent said and rolled her eyes. She clearly hadn’t been caught by the Savior’s spell yet. Draco knew that time would show her that this baby Potter was a very special person. He had hated him until a few days ago as well and now he honestly wanted to be around him all the time and protect him from everything.
“No, I have a receptionist.” Potter smirked. “We got help, when too many people asked for our help and we just couldn’t do it anymore. I found Maria online and asked her to join our office. And she’s basically the manager of everything.”
Harry beamed at him and offered him a hand, so they strolled down the hill towards the village. Draco leaned at Harry’s shoulder and sighed. “When I came here, I was actually lost. You showed me the way back, Harry.”
He was brought back to reality a few minutes later, when Pansy sat down next to him again and nodded, as if to say that Blaise was okay with their plan. Draco smiled gratefully.
His husband ignored his question, hands wandering over his chest and stomach as he pushed him harder against the wall. Harry exhaled shakily and gave his husband more access to his neck, unwilling to stop this attack.
Draco raised his eyebrows, the hatred leaving his eyes and the quick smirk betraying his still annoyed appearance – at least for anybody else. Harry knew that there was a game starting an he couldn’t wait for the number of scared classmates they were going to have – scared that they might actually divorce now, though Harry couldn’t believe nobody else but Neville and by default Blaise had figured it out.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy. I was absolutely happy as well to not have to see your face every day when we graduated. I never thought that you were actually the elixir I needed to figure out what my life was supposed to be. You have showed me so much in these few years we’ve been together and I cannot understand how I haven’t seen this when we were children. Anyway” he quickly cleared his throat, probably realising that he had started to rant. Draco smirked, when Harry rolled his eyes and wet his lips again. “From this moment on, Draco, I will promise you to be your best friend for life. Hardships and uplifting moments may come and go, but I will stand by you for as long as I shall live and have the privilege to call you my husband. With every beat of my broken, hurt and mended heart, I will love you. Until it beats for the final time.”
Draco felt his heart tighten as he watched his ward’s scared eyes glance at him. “No, bear, no!” he felt himself about to tear up and swallowed heavily. “Don’t worry, Harry. I promise I’m not going to punish you! You did nothing wrong.”
“You never know. Slughorn might revolutionize the marking system.” Hermione grinned at Harry’s and Ron’s widened eyes.
That must have been true, Harry mused. Neville with his Auror eyes must have picked up on a lot of tells and quick looks they were throwing each other. Maybe they should have hidden it better – they really should have done this coloring somewhere else not that he thought of it. Then again, Draco should have thought about that as well unless he had wanted to play a little dangerous game.
Harry smirked. “Good evening, Lucius. Long time, no see. Listen, I have no idea how you found us and why on earth you’d think it’s a good idea to ask Draco,
Without trying to overthink it, Draco decided to ask: “Harry, I’ve been trying to figure this out for the better part of eighth year now and I still have no idea: Why is Severus behaving so differently when it comes to you? He’s not torturing you and it looks as if he cares quite a bit about you…”
“I don’t know, Pansy. Ever since I woke up when I was eighteen and realized I was a Slytherin… They seem to have gone from a trio to a duo.” Harry sighed. Draco thought he had seen a little sadness in his eyes. However, if that was the case, Harry expertly hid it again, when he smiled at them. “I mean, I am happy for them, but I felt a little alone. And I also wondered whether or not I’m that easily replaceable or forgettable?”
Chuckling, Eric shrugged his shoulders. “Time is rather irrelevant when you live for a few hundred years, Dwarfbart, we both know that. So, I do believe we’ll see each other soon. Whatever that might mean.”
How did she get all these information? He stood there for a little too long for it to be an easy discussion. Draco wasn’t sure what to do. Lovegood was clearly crazy. However, she seemed to care about Potter. And maybe she had a free lesson, when he needed to go to the Studies of Ancient Runes. Why would he trust her more than Potter’s actual friends?
Shaking his head, Draco chuckled. “I couldn’t hate your guts, Harry. I, however, hate Weasley’s guts. So… just a warning.”
It was quiet and only the crackling of wood in the intense heat of death along with pages being turned and the scribbling of quills, nothing could be heard. If there hadn’t been a intense period of time in front of the people sitting in this Common Room, they would have definitely relaxed or played a game or two. Well, as there was indeed a complicated lesson waiting for them the next day, nobody could think about relaxing today.
Harry frowned over his shoulder and shook his head. “I’m not going to kill you, Malfoy. Why on earth would you think that? Not everyone’s after you.”
“I do feel honored by that. Anyway, let’s forget all this and have fun tonight? We’re having a party to start out busy study season. Pansy’s been planning for days, I think.” Harry grabbed is hand and pulled him out of his room.
Draco sat down on another chair, just because he wasn’t feeling comfortable with sitting somewhere where Vision-McGonagall was apparently sitting. “So, what did you talk about with your visions?”
“That’s stupid. She can’t do that! You’re still our Draco Ma…aa...” Blaise had serious trouble saying Draco’s former last name. His head turned red with his frantic trying. He finally shook his head. “Shit.”
Charlie and Pansy entered the room. The witch checked up on Harry by performing some kind of spell and smiled. “Everything seems fine! However, just to make sure, you should visit your healer and check up on Harry again. It’s best to have two or more people see what’s going on.”
While the Minister drew a lot of looks, Harry walked back to the door where he had stood guard and grabbed his microphone. “Release the rose pedals.” That was surely going to take back the attention to how beautifully and now clearly over the top this wedding was.
“Alright” Harry smirked and nodded. “Go get your handsome man to join this spiel of fake relationships and divorces. I’m sure nothing can go wrong” he added sarcastically.
Severus coughed, grabbed the stack of papers and walked out, while Albus rolled his eyes. At least now, someone was looking into it. That man wasn’t his favourite puppet, but he could just send him away without problems. He had nobody to stay with and the students hated him, he surely wasn’t going to be missed.
“Yes, bear, how can I help you?” Draco smiled softly. There was a very weak, almost suppressed ‘aww’-sound from Pansy, when Potter’s grin turned broader as is he seemed to realize what Draco’s actual name was (besides Potter calling him ‘dada’). Also, for some reason, Potter had managed to say ‘r’ for the very first time.
Draco groaned and pulled the blanked over his head, drowning out Pansy. He should have known better than to ignore her, as his blanked vanished and he glared at his best friend.
Kevin raised his eyebrows. “I can also just tell him to leave. I honestly don’t know how he found out you worked here and…”
Harry shrugged his shoulders, grinning from ear to ear. “I think it’s helping me a lot that you’ve helped me with the Patronus. Sometimes, I see Dementors everywhere I go. And I just get my Patronus and it tells me, no: I’m safe. So, I’m feeling quite okay.”
They bid goodbye with the promise of coming back next Sunday. “I can’t wait to see you next Sunday” Ginny hugged him. When Luna waved and walked out of the house to wait in front of the house, Ginny turned to him. “I’m asking Luna to marry me tomorrow, that’s why I didn’t have time. I hope that’s okay with you.”
All it took was these seven words and Harry’s slightly stressed face softened instantly. The spark in his eyes seemed to widen and he leaned forwards, capturing his lips in a kiss. “I love you too, Dray. I would do anything for you.”
“Which is exactly why Theodore didn't come. He's my second alibi. You see, I was spending time with you, but he then offered to teach me more about Charms and since I've spent almost my whole eighth year as a child, I accepted the extra study time.” Harry winked at him. “Also, Pansy saw us studying in the Common Room.”
“Hmm.” Harry rubbed his forehead and tilted his head slightly while he thought. “I think Ravo wants to go after his brothers, but because he’s small, he can’t keep up with them and... he is lost in a forest.”
“Hey!” Harry laughed. “I asked all of you what you thought of the name Merlin! Everyone though it was an amazing name!” He grinned and petted Merlin who tried to escape Neville’s clutches to get to the tuna.
Draco walked in and looked at it. It was just as big as everything else. Pansy walked out rather dazed, as if she had just fallen in love with this thing.
Deciding to act quickly, less his courage would fail him again; Harry walked up to Malfoy and looked him into his eyes. “Are you still looking for a partner in Muggle Studies? I could help you introduce you to some leisure activities the Muggles usually do?”
Draco chuckled. “I love you too, you idiot! I want to be with you until I can’t remember my own name anymore.”
“You’re talking about Potter” Draco interrupted her, before she would get any more inappropriate. Baby Potter had started to draw something on the parchment with a grey crayon, eyes wide. Draco shook his head and turned back to the discussion happening right now.
Millicent once again was the first to speak up: “You… what?! You lost your name? How is that even still possible? The last witch who had lost her name was three hundred years ago!”
, should at least know that you can kill a child without using magic… Throw me out the window and done.”
Minerva chuckled. “I had a feeling it was because of that game. Well, I’m glad you’re having fun; that was all I had intended.”
“That’s a stupid thought and I don’t think they’d ever do that. You’re their friend. Why in Merlin’s name would they let you die alone?!”
Nott shrugged his shoulders and they silently walked to the Apparating Chamber, everyone with their bag and probably a silent wish that this mission was going to be over as soon as possible. At the AC, the four Aurors showed their badge and were led into a black room. Once everyone was inside and the ddoor firmly shut, the magical flow surrounded all of them and they were sucked up as if they had been standing in front of a vacuum cleaner.
Harry frowned once again, but before he could ask something, he yawned again. “How come you know so much about the people here, but I am the one who’s lived here longer?”
Harry snorted and shook his head, when Ron ran after him, almost trying to get away from the house as fast as he could. He looked at Draco and placed a kiss on his temple.
Draco was unsure of what to do. Harry looked so helpless and he wanted to help. Yet, how far was he allowed to go? When would Harry fall back into his own memories and believe that he was just a jerk – which admittedly he was – but he had changed. And which memories did he have already?
