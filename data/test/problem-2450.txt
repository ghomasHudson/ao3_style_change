Draco huffs, still peering into the room. “Of course I am and I’m going to have Albus help me. Tomorrow is the last day of school for him, there’s no harm in having a little fun. Even I pranked my Charm School tutor on my last day.” He smiles. Those were good times.
. One that Malfoy immediately returns.
Good thing he won’t ever have to know.
He doesn’t know how Astoria continues to.
Scorpius trills his tongue. “That sucks because Mr. Potter is really funny when you actually get to know him.”
Potter rolls his eyes. “Well, here’s something that might pique your interest. Look at that.” He points to the winter horizon just as they reach the top of the circular ride.
“But,” Ginny interrupts pointedly, “we all came to a consensus not to meddle in your relationship with Malfoy. And we
He mutters wonderingly under his breath, utterly perplexed by this new development in his son’s life. How, between focusing on work and worrying about Scorpius’s adjustments, had he overlooked the fact that he managed to make a new friend? In less than a week nonetheless.
“No, that was you only telling me that he hates you. You never got into the why.”
He does take that nap afterwards. Harry was right, he did need it.
Ginny sighs, negating her anger to reach out and card a hand through James’ hair. “Oh sweetie, I left your father. It was a mutual agreement. I can’t help that I love Luna more than he can help that he loves Draco.” He wrangles himself from out of her reach, his piercing glare still fixed on Harry from across the table.
His pale hand yanks away from the jar and he scowls darkly at him. “And so what if it is?” Harry squints and notices for the first time the light coat of mascara on Malfoy’s lashes and the pink stain of blush on his cheeks.
Another three minutes go by and Draco’s foot
After years of practice, the spell comes naturally to him. “How do you feel?” He hardly even needs to ask because he can feel Harry’s body tensing under his fingers.
Draco shrugs. “Three chocolate frogs per hour.”
“I want you to really think about what you just said.”
A tall, plump woman is exiting room 3326, getting her small children in a straight line before releasing them out into the hallway. She’s pretty, with sleek auburn hair, a faint blush on her rounded cheeks, and a yellow sundress brushing past her ankles.
Startled, Draco turns and sees half of Scorpius’ body is out onto the rooftop. He quickly Vanishes the gillyweed, holding out a hand to help him up. Though the cold shock had been good for his system, Draco casts a heating charm around them to circumvent the cold atmosphere.
Comments and kudos are and will always be appreciated and loved!
Albus steps up and places a chubby hand on his arm. “Come on Scorp, I’m fine, see?” He waves his plastered arms around for emphasis. “I’m not mad at you. I could never be mad at you.”
Albus and Scorpius rush from behind them, each smiling as Molly fusses over them and pinches their cheeks. They lap up the attention like puppy dogs, especially Scorpius, who glows as Molly Weasley gloats over how much of a handsome young wizard he was while chiding Draco for not bringing him over sooner.
, but a
Harry nods dumbly, still taking it all in. “I see that.” He gingerly touches Draco’s cheek. It was really him, all angular features and pale definition. His fingers trace the path from his temple down to the cut of his cheekbones, to the curve of Cupid’s bow before finally settling on the handsome point of his chin. “Am I the first person who’s seen you like this?” He hopes so. He wants to be the first person to see Draco Malfoy’s handsome face after over a month of living without it.
“Side effect?” Her eyes grow wide and she laughs, loud and hollow. He winces. “Sure Potter, I'll give you the password.”
Draco, was lying on top of him.
,” Blaise and Pansy say together, wagging their eyebrows in unison. Draco wrinkles his nose. He and Harry were definitely
Draco presses his lips together at his bluntness. Oh dear Merlin, he just may have a Gryffindor on his hands. Either that or Albus’ nonexistent manners have been rubbing off on him.
After lunch, he watches as Parkinson and Zabini walk together arm in arm from the Great Hall. Harry raises a brow. They sure seemed…
He’ll die believing that too.
“Parkinson gave me the password.”
He’s moving a bit too fast and Harry slows him down. “Hey,” Harry clamps a hand on his shoulder, “I love you.”
He moves in front of him, swiftly stopping his fast-paced walking. “Want to know your future?” His pudgy hand palms his breast pocket where Draco knows he keeps his tarot cards. “Geminis are predicted to have a good week, maybe you’ll get lucky?” His smile is brighter than his obscenely orange hair and Draco feels his insides churn. It was worse than Weasley’s and that was saying something.
He may be right. The most hated statements are usually embedded with truths, his mother says. He may never be as vulnerable or as empathetic or as brave as Harry deserves.
Harry just stands up and yanks him into a hug. “I’m proud of you.”
Scorpius ponders this, rolling his bottom lip between his teeth in much the same fashion as Draco does. He comes to a conclusion by the time they reach the Apparition point. “No, you’re just mean. Grandma calls it being witty, but I think you just like being mean.”
“There are so many things about you I love that I’ve lost count,” Draco admits, a welling in his chest that would have felt constricting had it not all been caused by Harry.
“Arsehole!”
“This is disgusting,” Draco chides breathily in his ear, “Shagging on your desk.”
No, he hasn’t noticed. Mainly because he was too focused on glaring or trying to best Potter.
When his hands start to shake, Harry’s words twirl around in his mind, distracting him. He should have never gone to him. Harry Potter, like always, is a distraction filling his head with nonsensical problems.
“No, it is not!” Malfoy protests. “I’m a guy. Guys don’t have periods.”
“That’s actually the problem,” says Draco. “We recently discovered that Scorpius needs glasses and as you can see he’s not taken too kindly to having them.” His mouth tightens in warning at his son when he hisses under his breath. Scorpius was really testing his patience this morning. “So I just wanted to inform you that he is to wear his glasses at all times unless given special permission to remove them. And furthermore, if there are any behavioral issues as a result, please do not hesitate to contact me.” He smiles charmingly at Ana. “You have my email.”
With a quick treat and a scratch on the head, Draco sends him off, stewing in the realization that in a few days, he is going to be forced into a cramped dinner table to play nice with Weasel and Granger.
He hears a groan and Neville leans up from behind him, whispering sharply. “Come on, Harry, if you keep letting Malfoy get to you, you’ll get all of our house points taken away!”
Harry takes out his pocketed wand, relinquishing it to Draco without hesitation. The wand hums, unaccustomed to the unfamiliar magic gripping it. Draco takes out his own wand, giving Harry's a tap with his and handing it back to him. “Tell me how it feels now as you hold it.”
For the sake of his future friendship with Malfoy, Harry wisely decides not to snap at her to mind her business.
Draco sighs, double checking that Ana was gone before casting a
today?” His face turns up at the memory and it makes Harry want to do nothing more than to
Draco opens his mouth to reply with some snarky comment that he wouldn’t compliment him if he was the last man on earth, but then he quickly closes it. It wasn’t true, was it? He could pretend all he wants that Potter’s little performance wasn’t incredible, but it wouldn’t do either of them any good to lie.
to say to his son before he’s gone forever. No, not forever. He could see him again in eight hours. Eight. Long. Hours. Sweet Salazar Slytherin,
When he pulls away, Ginny raises her brows, stunned. “Well… wow, that’s great Harry! I had this whole speech ready to tell you and what not but you figured it out yourself. Congrats.”
“Sod off,” Harry retorts, his eyes still glued to Draco’s hard cock. “It’s just… Ron and I used to joke back in school that you were a dick because you were trying to… well, make up for your dick. Clearly we were wrong.” He licks his lips. “Very wrong.”
Just a very short, fluffy epilogue to make up for all that angst.
“All I see is strength.”
“Malfoy.”
is the equivalent of a fluffy Kneazle when he’s mad. Don’t worry I got this.” Harry snorts to himself. There must be another Draco at Hogwarts because the Draco Malfoy he knew was a firestorm when he was angry. She turns to him, wand raised in warning. “This is a one time thing, Potter. If I see you hocking around the dungeons outside of this, you’ll be as ball-less as Draco is.”
Speech fails him when he tries to talk, his voice too ragged and sore for him to utter an intelligible word. The urge to hack up a cough is suppressed only by sheer will. If he starts coughing now then he fears that he’ll never stop.
Harry pulls away from him, gripping him by the shoulders. “Nothing. Don’t blame yourself for others' misconceptions about you. I’ve seen your work Draco—you’re brilliant.”
“I knew we should have never gotten involved with that family. One’s in jail, one’s a deviant.”
His unheard goodbye is left on his lips and Draco felt a piece of his heart crack like glass as he watched his son run away from him.
“Boo!” Albus cries, his little face wrinkled in disgust. “You’re awful, Dad!”
“Are you okay? Your eyes look a little…I dunno, cloudy?” Harry’s fingers lightly tilts his head towards him. Burns stands in front of the room and starts his threatening warnings about talking or mischief during the presentation.
“James and I do not—” Harry begins, literally choking on his words, unable to finish the lie he was about to say. George raises his hands as he proves his point. “This isn’t the appropriate time to do this.”
“You care about my friends. In your own, eccentric, snarky-arsed way.” He pokes his cheek and Draco growls threateningly. He had one more time doing that before he hexed all of that pretty hair off. “Admit it.”
Harry’s face is ruddy and he’s clearly trying to deflect from the truth by the way he kept pawing at Draco’s hair. Finally, he says in a small, gruff voice, “I may have a bit of a thing for your singing.”
An odd look crosses his face when Draco doesn’t sit up front with him but instead joins the children on the carpet. A boy that has an uncanny resemblance to Scorpius offers him a little wave when Draco ends up sitting next to him. He waves back.
Jaspers hums. “Leo…I’ll remember that.” He waves at Draco. “See you mate!”
Draco sniffs, “It's alright.” For some reason, his Slytherin-bred instinct to deny outwardly loving something kicked it.
“Albus Potter,” Burns growls. “What is your issue?”
Draco takes a sniff of Harry’s lemonade. Nothing smelled out of the ordinary, but then again, if George had spiked with Veritaserum, or something similar, there shouldn’t be anything unusual about the drink’s odor. He watches with careful eyes as Molly and Arthur throw blunt words at each other about each other's odor.
“What did I say about playing your cards right Potter? I can be
“You’re a pervert Malfoy.”
“That gender roles are utterly meaningless.” He twirls Harry again, as if to prove his point.
He doesn’t quite know how to respond to Harry’s openness that he specifically asked for. He focuses on finding the brightest star he can to avoid answering. Every time he says the word ‘PTSD’ he feels a little part of him cringe.
Draco’s never hurried out of a place so quickly in his entire life.
Draco reaches into his back trouser pocket, waving the papers he digs out in between his two fingers. “I’m not trying to keep Astoria away from Scorpius. However, legally, I can if I choose to.”
Harry holds up a finger and summons his bag from across the room. He pulls out several sheets from the classes Malfoy missed today and handed it to him. “Like your schoolwork. I went to your classes and picked up your work for today.”
He thought that it was the last thing that he wanted to do and that his day couldn’t possibly get any worse. But, like always, Draco Malfoy was there to prove him wrong once again.
“Prat.”
Draco turns and sees his son, all wind-blown silver-blonde hair and redden cheeks sprinting towards him with his arms outstretched. Draco smiled and opened his arms to catch him. Scorpius was a little too big to be picked up and coddled anymore but Draco didn’t care. He was planning on picking him up for as long as he could.
He nods and she slides her hand over, tentatively wrapping her dainty fingers around his hand. After a moment’s hesitation, he squeezes back.
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Her hormones are all over the place. I didn’t know it was possible to get baby fever when you were already pregnant.”
His next fear is that it’s Harry coming to tell him that it was over, to enjoy his suffering by himself since that’s clearly what he wants. He didn’t mean to be so harsh to him, but he couldn’t think with him in his ear like that. Couldn’t breathe with him hovering over him and trying to convince him not to be worried for his son.
Draco grunts from the sharp pain, grinding his teeth and hissing obscenities under his breath. Ana chides him with a stern mouth, reminding him that some point system was still in effect regardless that it was the end of the day, but the child only flashes her a brief, apologetic smile as he plunges through the metal doors that lead out to the play area.
“Air,” Harry gasps.
Draco practiced that in the mirror last night and this morning. No parent is ever willing to admit it, but sometimes a rehearsed speech is necessary to stand your ground. He already has a speech planned if he ever catches Scorpius sneaking out of the house and a very good one planned if Merin-forbid he ever says anything derogatory about Muggles or Muggleborns.
“Of course,” Draco echoes, smiling. He doesn’t quite know where he fits into this. Meeting with Ron and Hermione was one thing, but meeting the entire Weasley clan during a clearly sacred holiday? No thanks.
The old floors squeak as he walks to the yellow kitchen and Draco softens his footfalls, careful not to make too much noise in a space that wasn’t meant for him.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles.
They cross a busy interaction, leading them to the Apparition point behind an abandoned warehouse. Muggles zip past on foot, in cars, on those odd-looking contraptions with two wheels. Despite the whirlwind of energy and movement around him, Draco’s attention remained solely on his son.
Harry’s fingers play with the soft tail of his braid. “So why do it?”
“Got it love.”
“Shut up. You’re fucking average Potter.”
Scorpius throws his head back and whines, sounding all the more like the younger version of himself. It was easy to forget from his witty retorts and polite exterior that Scorpius was only ten and was prone to temper tantrums just like any other ten year old.
In this universe, Draco watches helplessly, counting down each second he makes it not exploding into tiny, celibate pieces.
the one who has to prove herself, not you. Say you tell him and she just ends up disappointing him again. Then what?”
Harry moans into the floor, waving his hand away. “I think I’m going to stay down here for now.” Wincing, Draco backs away in understanding. He really needed to get used to sleeping in a bed with another person. “At least you didn’t kick me in the crotch again.”
Draco gives him a faint smile, his watery grey eyes looking back to the steel door of the school entrance.
He can’t get enough of it, personally. Everything makes sense on this wall; his research, his son’s needs, his life. It was the most brilliant thing he had invented to date and probably the one place that he knows has all of the answers.
He feels himself deflate. Literally. But of course. He was a good
“I’ll talk to Neville and Ron,” Harry assures him. It was going to be the most awkward talk he had ever had with them but he’ll do it if it’ll make Malfoy feel more comfortable.
“Alright then,” Potter starts. Draco waits for him to pull out a children’s book and begin reading from it, but he does no such thing. Instead, Potter gives them all a content half-smile, basking in the anxious eagerness of the children and Draco. What was he up to?
Potter crosses his arms and watches as Ana helps Scorpius settle into her room. He tsks disappointingly. “Glasses aren’t
“Fuck,” he gasps, gripping onto Harry’s arms. They were definitely going to try that once they had a proper bed underneath them.
Ron pats him on the back. “That was a one-time occurrence. Prepare yourself for a lot more sabotaging from now on mate.”
Harry every so often gives him a thumbs up from in between an intense game of exploding snap with George’s son and Draco smiles back, peeling his potatoes and content with being alone as he does. This wasn’t so bad, as long as he stayed out of the way. Scorpius was doing good enough for the both of them. They could get through this yet if they both played their parts.
“Is there?” Draco asks, scowling as he bites his red bottom lip. His eyes fall to the ground, looking far too disappointed with himself for Harry’s liking.
He scoffed, puffing up like one of his parents’ offended peacocks at the suggestion. “Scorpius, why
He means it too. But for now, the only thing he needs is the space to figure things out. The
Harry furrows his brows. “Who?”
“James, I know this hasn’t been—”
If he ever does of course. He’s still probably getting ready at this very moment.
“Scorpius, what would you think if I did this?” He holds the pamphlet up for him to read, making sure to note if Scorpius has to squint to read the text only a few feet away. For all the time he’s made fun of Potter’s thick-rimmed glasses, his own son seems to need them now. “Answer honestly… and chew your food first.”
He can practically feel Potter thinking as they finished their respective meals in silence. His brows were screwed together and his eyes had that far off, wandering look to them. He’s tempted to offer a Knut for his thoughts, but he decides to settle with silence instead. Silence can be good too, with the right people. Or person.
They laugh, except for Ginny, whose eyes are transfixed on something behind Harry’s shoulder. “I don’t know about you Ron, but I would hex you to pieces if you try to mess up my relationship with
Either a squirrel was feeling particularly cheeky today or someone was in the tree and was ungraciously hinting at him to find his own tree to daydream under.
She gives him a watery smile. “Thank you. I’ll see you soon.”
“Are you okay Malfoy?”
“Why did you get divorced?”
“Sod off Potter.”
discussed this Ronald!” She hisses threateningly. Harry’s heart lurches when he sees long blonde hair swing into view, then it subsequently falls when a tanned Hufflepuff turns around.
Yet, deep down he knows she wouldn’t say anything. Now if it had been Kacia… Draco may have had to try his hand at Obliviating a Muggle.
It never comes.
She sniffs the air with a disgusted face. “It smells like a bar in here.” Picking up an empty bottle and shaking the remaining contents around, she sighs into the air. “And I can see why. Look, do you want to tell me what’s going on or do I have to force Veritaserum down your throat for you to be truthful?”
“Like?”
The universe was giving him all the signs and yet he chose to ignore it like the ignorant sod he was. And now, Potter’s here, teaching his son Merlin knows what and controlling his education for the next year.
He supposes stranger things have happened. Like kissing the warm lips of a man who had died and came back to life.
The fire cracks, Harry’s fingers run over the hairs of his eyebrow, and Draco fails to swallow the truth sitting on his tongue.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek, his arms swinging loosely around his body. “I can burn them for you if you want?” Just like his father, he too has a talent for burning literature.
They work really well together, Draco surmises as he goes to place the photo on his desk for later. Next he’ll have to figure just
are alright. Not the stars or space aliens or whatever.”
His jaw aches when he unclenches it. He needs to stop doing that.
Right?” He’s a bit miffed that Harry was inclined to brush off his warnings simply because they seemed a little odd. It’s not like he’s screaming his head off about nargles and wrackspurts.
what if Scorpius and Albus need us? What if something happens and we’re stuck? What if—”
“Of the long distance flirting.”
“You’re probably right, but that still won’t stop me from asking though. I mean it when I say you’re my friend Malfoy. Friends don’t let other friends suffer in silence.”
He can’t help but think that he’s being tested in some perverse, twisted way.
Draco feels his face burn. Another thing Harry will be forbidden from doing: saying unexpectedly sweet things about him in front of Weasels.
The words hit him like a slap across the face. That’s what it was! No wonder why he felt like he was going to crawl out his skin. Granted, he still should probably take those potions, but nevermind that. St. Mungos was bound to see an uptick of hospital cases from wizards and witches performing simple heating and cooling charms.
“No,” he replies curtly.
“Not my fault you tried to kill everyone with paprika. I can still taste it.”
His heart is nearly bursting with guilt and it explodes once the Auror steps out to his floor. “Fuck Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot that we’ll be—”
He knows this, yet Draco’s panting by the time he makes it into the school.
He sits in the back of the room with Harry, smirking as he whispers to him his prank.
Draco wills the heat crawling up his cheeks to leave. “Happy is a strong word…” Scorpius looks unconvinced. “It doesn’t matter much does it? Potter’s not interested and I have to respect that. I’m not either by the way.” He adds the last bit quickly, looking away as he does.
From the corner of his eyes he sees his neighbor Miss Norrison staring at him with wide eyes as she waters her grass with one of those long snake-like things.
“Right, right,” she concedes, a barmy smile on her face. “You can’t blame me for trying though. I mean, if you’re fucking Harry Potter I want a teacher of my own to shag.” She holds up a finger to silence his protests. “And before you start raving to me about how you’re not sleeping with Potter, let me just point out that you should. And you definitely want to.”
Next to him, the bowl of eggs Harry was whisking stops stirring.
He doesn’t pull away.
“Er…” Shite, how did straight blokes talk about women again? He should know this, he acted as one for twelve years.
Draco comes to a sudden halt. They were almost at the abandoned Apparition point but he can hardly believe his ears. “Get to know— when did you…?”
The children squirm eagerly. Draco finds himself leaning forward too.
Harry shouldn’t be the one to apologize. He leans too far onto Harry’s body, nearly toppling them both over. “Sorry. I am so tired,” he mumbles. Between the tiredness that usually comes from a panic attack and from the large amounts of alcohol he consumed yesterday, all of the fight is drained from his body. Draco wanted nothing more than to fall asleep on the couch with Harry and forget about his problems for a few hours. Preferably, in Harry’s arms.
“Potter.” Blaise’s voice is gruff with disinterest. “You’re calling, again.” His dim expression comically brightens when he sees Draco. “Draco! Hey, you need to talk to Scorp?”
He still doesn’t like animals.
“Sorry,” Harry winces.
Wow I can’t believe this is the last official chapter. It feels like just yesterday I was neglecting my Astronomy homework to write this (pls think twice before taking Astronomy, especially in college, worst shit I’ve ever taken). Thank you all for being such wonderful readers and continually making my day with your comments, kudos, etc. I always had a fear of posting my work online and y’all have exceeded my expectations for this story. And if you’re wondering, yes, there will be an epilogue posted soon :)
Malfoy bites his lip. “Yeah.”
at the pile of ash, just to give his magic something to take his anger out on. The flames evaporate themselves in the air with a crisp
Draco places Harry’s necklace on for him, adjusting the crystallized amulet so that it sits at the center of his chest. It glows bright pink when it touches his skin and Draco places a discreet kiss on it because an extra bit of protection never hurt anybody.
Stupid Potter. Stupid PTA.
“Better?” Draco asks. He hardly hears Scorpius’ murmured yes over his friend’s cheering and loud applause.
Oh, what joy Rita Skeeter and the Daily Prophet readers would have if they could see him now. He could just visualize the headline,
After several moments of chewing the inside of her cheek and huffing, she finally gives in. “Fine. But if this behavior continues into the Sunday dinner, best believe me and that young man will have a long talk.” She turns, her eyes focusing on something at the side of the couch. “Oh and Harry?”
She turns, her entire being lifting as she takes a hesitant breath. “Yes, Draco?”
did you Potter?” He holds out the crook of his arm and guides Harry to the crowded floor. The whispers and shocked gasps grow louder. “Can you even imagine me in one of those frilly get-ups, prancing around like a wayward trollop?” He just so happens to stomp past a group fourth year witches decked out in fulsomely frilly dresses. Harry shoots them an apologetic look in response to their screwed glares.
“Vermin,” Draco corrects. “Pesky, nasty little buggers.” He gives in and smiles back, losing himself in memorizing the tiny freckles scattered across Potter’s nose when he remembers that his hand was still in his, still warm and pulsing under his fingers. It hardly felt unnatural.
“Stop it!” He hissed, moving the Puff away from his wall. Several papers fall to the ground and he sighs, remembering to restick them on the wall once he puts Princess back in his cage.
“It’s not for another playdate.”
Draco’s breath hitches. With all of the disappointment from today, he had forgotten that it was the first day of spring. His favorite season. How Harry knows this or had known to get his favorite flowers is a mystery his brain can’t work out. His breath audibly catches in his throat once more.
He and Scorpius spent their first Christmas from Paris tip-toeing around the fact that they were missing another person of their family this year. Somehow, their unwritten rule to not sugarcoat anything falls flat when it comes to Astoria. She is the exception to everything.
Draco pulls back.
He doesn’t answer, sweeping him around the building and letting him gawk at the vivid pictures of constellations and nebulae at his leisure. Stars, galaxies, planets. Some of them that he’s spent years researching and some that he hadn’t even known existed.
He should have gone to his mother's first. She wouldn’t have cornered him like this.
It’s a rare, cloudless and sunny day in England—people’s smiles are brighter, the Draco constellation will be especially visible in two weeks, and Harry Potter wants to talk about things that are not real. “I’m not discussing this anymore Potter,” he spits. “Not now, not ever. So stop bringing it up.”
He shoots her a grateful smile. He feels himself already liking this woman.
Harry pushes him onto his back on the table, the forceful action causing a dull ache in his head when it hits the wooden desk unexpectedly. He’s about to curse him for being such a buggering brute when Harry’s warm mouth engulfs him inch by inch and immediately all is forgiven.
, batting their eyelashes in Scorpius’ direction. Unfortunately for them, he was too busy watching Albus’ eyes widen in wonder to notice. Salazar, Draco is raising a heartbreaker.
Malfoy shrugs and unwraps it, sucking at the candy on top with his pouty, pink lips. Harry looks away, feeling uncomfortable watching Malfoy suck at the lollipop with such an avid determination. It was almost worse than the case of the fellated sausage.
She doesn’t even grunt in response.
Draco stills, his smile fading. This feels a lot like…flirting, actually. Not at all like their usual verbal sparring.
Draco’s swollen eyes fly open. Maybe he too was just as easy to read.
She moans. “Keep talking like that and I might just come right here and now.”
Draco would say that having an email made him feel like a real adult, but it only makes him realize how little he actually knows about the Muggle world. What other secret Muggle things was he missing out on? He leaves the library with a new determination to learn every gadget and gidget and widget Muggles use these days. An email was a start, but as Draco enters the school that Friday for the first PTA meeting, he wonders if he should get that book of faces thing as well. Who knows, it might help Scorpius.
Potter should know. He got them dropped. Yet he doesn’t say anything, just flicks his finger off his mouth and stares at Draco like he was trying to decide best what to do with him.
Beside him, Ron and Hermione both gag in repulsion.
“I’m sorry.” His face is pinched as if the effects of the Veritaserum are still coursing through his veins. James runs his hand through his hair much like Harry does, sighing all the way. Sensing a father-son moment about to occur, Draco slowly backs away, preparing to give them their space to talk. “Wait! Mr. Malfoy!”
“Not my fault…” Harry slurs tiredly. “Not usually…you’re too good…”
Blaise Zabini slams his palm on the table and gleefully declares in a voice far too reminiscent of a certain former headmaster, “A 100 points to Slytherin!” The other Slytherins laugh and Malfoy blows Harry a pouty-lipped air kiss. Harry seethes silently, the spoon in his fist threatening to bend.
“A braid?” Harry gasps, scandalized.
Draco quickly gathers his things, shrinking the box so that it fits in his cloak pocket. He bows, glaring at them all, his rejection letter crumpled in his hand. “Thank you for your time.”
Dumbfounded, he stares at her, his interest in Malfoy momentarily lost. “I— what?” The truth? What truth?
Draco’s dealt with far worse, yet no one ever made a fuss about his mental health when he was tasked with killing Dumbledore or made to watch Voldemort torture Muggles or dealt with the death of the man who healed his scarred chest. Yet, everyone has an opinion on what he should do just because his hands shake every once and awhile. It was all so fucked—no one cared when actually traumatizing events occurred in his life.
Oh he was going to be sick all over these scuffed floors. Of all the nice Muggle kids in this sodding school, his son befriended a Potter? And not just any Potter, but one that was an exact replica of Harry Potter?
He shakes his head again. “No, I just thought they were just really good friends,” he admits. Now that he thought about it, they were awfully handsy with each other…
“I love you,” He kisses the top of his sweaty forehead. “And in case you need to hear it in a different language—
Loss for words, Draco only manages to nod numbly in reply.
Five minutes after he gets off the phone with Ana, Draco’s walking towards the receptionist with determined steps.
“Tell me, has anyone ever heard the tale,
“You think I’m irresponsible don’t you?” He hardly sounds threatening given how awfully he slurred the word ‘irresponsible’. But he had a point to make, slurring or not. “Scorpius is with Blaise and Pansy, thank you. I have some sense, y’know. He…” he sighs tiredly. “He doesn’t need to see this,” Draco mutters darkly, lifting the bottle of Firewhiskey to his lips again.
She’s charming. Also, she knows how to pronounce Scorpius’ name. Not a bad first impression. Not bad at all.
“I think it’s best just to wait until he leaves for Hogwarts, yeah?” He points his own wand to the pile of ash and Vanishes it away with several flicks, the only evidence of Draco’s fury being the smoking, burnt grass underneath.
,” Jaspers whispers loudly in his ear.
Draco teaches him about the stars and the universe; Harry teaches him about sex.
How dare he assume that Draco hadn’t learned
His voice is small when he asks, “The stupid one?”
Draco laughed when he pulled out the Draco constellation Harry drew. The thing looked like a crooked sperm for Salazar’s sake. Good god, it was awful. But it was Harry’s and Draco would most definitely be hanging this up on his wall next to Scorpius’ drawings.
“Scorpius,” he hisses, “
“Draco!”
“I said goodbye Potter! Merlin, for such a goddamn hero you sure are thick in the head.”
“I just wanted to remind you that today is Thursday, we have our paired reading for the afterschool kids.”
Taking his eyes off of his best friend, he shakes his head. “Nah, she’ll only assign me another text to read and I’d rather not be guilted into reading a three-hundred paged book again.”
The fingers around his elbow refuse to let go. Draco gives Potter an irritated look.
Draco’s face crumples into a sneer. Waiting for his answer, Potter looks down on him and he wishes that the sodding prat would just sit down so that he isn’t reduced to being loomed over by everyone’s favorite Gryffindor. Death is a better reality than being in a submissive position to Harry Potter.
A little boy raises his hand. “How much do you make?”
Draco swivels around in the small chair, fixing him with a dangerous glare. “I beg your pardon?” He and Potter instinctively freeze when one of the children yawns, relaxing only when the little boy sighs softly and goes back to sleep.
He takes a breath, shuddering slightly as he releases it as a white cloud in the wintery air. “You…you like men, don’t you Dad?”
“Ice cream,” Lily echoes tiredly, her voice a tiny squeak around her suckled thumb. Draco won’t deny his affection for Albus, but there was something so adorably pure about Lily. He’s always wanted a little girl to spoil.
Draco smiles fondly, feeling the excitement bubbling under his sternum and up his throat. “Because it’s beautiful, that’s why! What other entity do you know can control whether the Earth can sustain life or not? Or control the other billions of galaxies in the universe? Not the Ministry, or Voldemort or blood supremacists, that’s for sure. The universe is limitless—no amount of money, magic, or convincing can allow anyone to thoroughly understand it or control it. It is, the one thing that is entirely unattainable.”
He begins to shake his head like a guilty five year old before remembering to use his words. “No, ma’am.”
“I know you did!”
Her fair features crumpled in weariness. “Okay Draco.” She rubs her bare arm bashfully, letting silence fill the room until she admits in a quiet voice, “I have been. Getting help, that is. It’s not so bad or so shameful once you just do it.”
“Come on Draco, just look at your wall!” Harry gestures over to the twelve foot wall with parchment papers held up on it with sticking charms. There are so many papers stuck to the wall that it’s a bit of a shock remembering that underneath the rows of parchment, the wall was actually painted a gorgeous olive green color. His lists, including reminders about upcoming astronomical cycles and events, were plastered in meticulously neat rows. So he was a bit of a neat freak? That wasn’t too weird, right?
Draco swears Pansy can smell the gillyweed on his washed skin when she arrives through the Floo the next day, her narrow eyes narrowing further as she looks him up and down.
He doesn’t have to guess for long, because the screen comes to life above them, and amongst the sea of twinkling stars on the ceiling, there’s one constellation shining just a bit brighter than the rest of the stars.
He hardly listens to the rest of the parents as they share their job descriptions. He’s done it. He’s spoken to a large crowd without freaking out. Maybe this was overkill, but Draco thinks he deserves a nice, long shag for today. He smiles at Harry, who gives him a tight-lipped smile in return.
It’s funny because Draco keeps waiting for his stars to align without realizing they already have.
He’s just stalking the Quidditch pitch for him when his legs start to cramp up from the constant movement. His body can survive an entire war and a fight against Voldemort, but it draws the line at desperate searches for Draco Malfoy.
He kicks again, his muddled mind too hazy to recognize that he wasn’t kicking a

Shaking legs carry him to the closed metal doors of the conference room, and for a moment he actually is shaking with jealousy. And fear. Mainly fear.
After Potions. That’s when he tells himself he’ll do it. Malfoy almost always stays behind to drag further information from Snape about the potion work. He truly was the male version of Hermione, only Snape didn’t seem to mind going into the theoretical aspects of each brew with Malfoy as he did for Hermione.
They’re just finishing up a previous presentation when Draco and Jaspers enter. Galatea’s mouth twisted in contempt, her blue eyes narrowing at the sight of him sitting down patiently in one of the seats. Draco sits up in the same poised manner his Charm School tutors taught him. He wanted to make a good… fifth impression today.
This morning was awful. Breakfast was spent with him worrying himself to death about Albus, who had been given detention already for speaking too loudly in class. Harry simply laughed it off, stating that he doesn’t know how in the hell he had managed to get himself sorted into Slytherin with his tactlessness. Draco doesn’t find it as humorous, nervous that his professors may hold a grudge against him like his history teacher had.
“You look good like this.”
“Where is Pot—Harry?” His tongue feels disgustingly fuzzy speaking his given name. “Doesn’t he like work here or something?” Slacking on the job? How very unusual for the Golden Prat.
“I don’t think I am. But can I ask what prompted you to ask me this?”
Shite. He regrets investing in the Muggle phone Blaise recommended as every person in the room stops and stares for the source of the buzzing. He fumbles the phone terribly, his shaking hands causing the thing to slide through his fingers and clatter against the floor.
Harry awkwardly pats his shoulder. “Yeah… you kind of did. At least it’s over, right? I had a feeling you were one stuttering sentence away from admitting that Malfoy now has the best arse in school.”
Or better yet, like a
A ball of tension wells up in his chest, and Draco can sense what’s about to happen from the way his left eye twitches and a rush of heat floods his nose. His nerves are hot, as his mother would call it, sending prickly pockets of pain to his hands and feet.
“Well for one because he is Draco bloody Malfoy! Who cares how attractive he looks; he’s the same blonde demon that endangered everyone we love by letting Death Eaters and Greyback into the school.”
Malfoy bristles. “
The Malfoy ring. In his haste to leave France he had forgotten all about it until now. It was such an important amulet passed down from generation to generation, that he can’t believe he had forgotten about it. He can just see it now, the metal ring that had been lying on his bedside table for months, collecting dust as he cultivated a life here with Scorpius and Harry, forgetting entirely about it till this very moment.
Unamused by the most unsexy thing walking into the room, Draco silently snarls at the back of Boot’s head when he turns his back to him. He butts Draco out of the way in his quest to get to Harry fucking Potter.
“There’s nothing wrong with loving or being excited about something other people find odd,” Harry wisely points out, sounding exactly how Draco imagined him sounding in the classroom. “It’s important to be passionate about what you do, otherwise what’s the point of doing it?”
Scorpius shrugs. “Did you know that he once rode a dragon Dad? Like, a real dragon?” He grins, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “That’s so cool! Have
“Here.” Draco steps into view, feeling a bit like a celebrity when Albus claps at his presence.
Draco’s face burns. He hates being laughed at for his irrationalities. In his head, his worries were completely justified.
“Are you sure, because I can—”
From the look on Harry’s face, Draco wonders if he should stop speaking before the sushi makes a reappearance. “I think I’m having a… fuck, what are those crises called?”
“Sorry girl,” He flips the owl a treat when he’s done tying. She eats it with unblinking eyes before flying off, her talons rudely scratching his window and leaving a long claw mark on the glass. Draco simmers. “Well fuck you too then!”
Though it’s hardly surprising, Draco is excellent at everything, from waltzing to dipping to simply embodying the elegance the dance calls for. His body is lithe and feline-like, moving with a graceful fluidity that Harry couldn’t acquire no matter how much he practiced.
Scorpius bites his lip, unable to prevent the laughing grin from showing on his glistening face. “Well, if I could say it like it is… maybe it’s because you're being so aggressive about it?” Draco gasps, offended that his own child was mislabeling his Slytherin bred ambition as aggression. He was
The redness on his face must be a combination of the sex, his embarrassment, and his anger at George. It was one of the five things on this earth Draco will admit was absolutely adorable.
There's more. Much more. “I know I shouldn’t drink as much as I do, but I’ve taken the potions before and I couldn’t get out of bed for weeks because of it. I don’t take them because Scorpius doesn’t deserve two neglectful parents.”
could happen. That’s what scared him the most.
in Potter’s bathroom.
He’d never known a simple touch would make such a stark difference. All of Astoria’s touches felt like obligations.
do? I only served drinks to everyone.”
The newspaper dangles from his fingers. “I doubt his theory applies to a horoscope in the—” he looks at the cover sporting a busty blonde and one of those Muggle Princes that was always in the news for something, “
A loud explosion and high pitched scream capture their attention. He looks over to see Ginevra picking the glass of her lilac teacup out of her hair and bloodied freckled skin. She gives them a pained smile. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you were right Malfoy.” She hisses in pain, “I think I need to go to the Healer’s.” She picks herself up, eyes aimed at Harry pleadingly. “Come with?”
“Pansy!” Draco hisses, “I think he gets it.”
A familiar looking wry grin appears on Scorpius’ face as he twirls his spaghetti noodles into a large circle around his fork. He holds up a forkful and stares at it with an unimpressed expression, very similar to the one he wears whenever he smells red sauce and noodles coming from the kitchen. “Says the dad who only made spaghetti for the past ten days. I think we all have our flaws.”
,” Draco groans after a minute. What the hell was taking him so long?
before.”
A flock of crows swoops overhead of the school, their presence and the grey sky above not helping to contradict the school’s ominous aura. Sensing his magic, they ferociously caw at him from their place on the roof, reminding Draco that no matter how many books he reads or the type of clothes he wears, he will never truly belong here.
Well, not for Potter per se, but rather for a gift for the children that he could use. He may or may not have overheard Potter talking to Ana about how he still has yet to find a book based on constellations for the children in his class to read for next term. And he knew just the perfect book.
Scorpius squeals suddenly and a heavily pregnant Pansy steps into view, tickling Scorpius on his belly.
She isn’t exactly the devilish, emotionless figure from his tainted memories. Nor is she the same, easy-going woman she was those years before Scorpius was born and when she served as the only remedy for Draco’s misdirected anger at the world. They were no longer those people, so he can’t expect her to act like that woman anymore either.
The resounding snort from Harry reverberates around the dark room. “Scorpius is one of my best students. The only student who fails my exams is Albus. Why?”
But he can be soft. He can be that, for Harry.
“Oh great,
He looked good, but only if he could get rid of that sodding braid.
He looks up at Harry, still in the throes of his nearing orgasm. He shakes his head vigorously. “Nope, nothing.” He no not so subtly pushes his hips forward, rudely shoving his wettened cock in Draco’s face.
“Ah, and speaking of my cock,” Malfoy starts, laying back into the bed with a serene expression on his face. “It truly was a sight to behold. The perfect specimen: well-groomed, long, and thick. Made for the perfect fu—”
Pansy’s glare is lethal. “Yes now and yes on your bloody floor! Bloody fuck, someone Floo us to St. Mungo’s before I birth a baby here!” Her shaking hands fly to her stomach as if trying to will the baby to not make its grand entrance on Draco’s very expensive and very polished floors.
“Yeah,” says a bright-eyed Scorpius, “Like last week, I failed his exam!”
“Let’s maybe try storming away to get shagged when you’re sober, yeah?” Blaise grunts out as he places Draco’s limp body back into his seat.
Today had great potential to be a good day, Draco’s sure of it. The Earth’s tilt is getting in line for the Autumnal Equinox occurring in two months, the Scorpius constellation will be especially luminous tonight, and the Moon is waxing into a gorgeous iridescent crescent; all of this creating the perfect combination for a wonderful twenty-four hours.
Oh, he knows. If he didn’t know before he knew now.
“I’m over it. Who cares about that when Astoria and Finley want to take Scorpius back to Paris? I can never relax as it is, now I have to worry about them wanting to take my son away from me?” He shakes his head; Harry’s priorities were messed up. “I’m not discussing this fictional mental illness shite anymore, I need to move onto what matters.”
He cocks his head when Harry doesn’t respond. “So answer me. What are you avoiding?”
Draco blinks in surprise. Usually when people see Harry, they don’t immediately place him under the title as his boyfriend. Usually they shove Draco out of the way and gush over Harry Potter,
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy!” Albus shouts as if he wasn’t a mere two feet away from him. Draco tries not to wince. This kid will never be allowed in Madam Pince’s library if he doesn’t learn how to use his inside voice. “Can you
how Potter gave prep-talks? Merlin, he already knew this, but Gryffindors really did have no sense of tact about them.
“I’m just confused,” Ginny admits, nibbling at her pink bottom lip. “What exactly does this thing do again?”
“So one,” he says, “Both on our first date and at that time I was an arse and forced you to stand in front of the PTA group.” At least he admitted it. Draco doesn’t so much as bat an eyelash. “On the date, I thought you were just bored or annoyed by me, but you kept shaking every so often and fidgeting. You’re a bloody fidgeter you know that?”
He wants to protest how unfair it all was, but knowing Snape, he’ll probably take 20 points from his house. So he forces himself to shut his mouth and slumps back into his seat with his head bowed. “Yes sir, Professor Snape,” he grumbles under his breath.
“I won’t.”
The words come out as an urgent breath. “Don’t let anyone mispronounce your name!”
“Nothing. Goodnight.” He pauses, tests the waters before saying quietly, “I… I care about you. A lot.” It’s not quite a proclamation of love, but it’s there, so close to what he will say one day to him.
watch him quite consistently. But for good reason, because he was Malfoy and everyone knows that Draco Malfoy was always up to something.
“Maybe… maybe you should cut him some slack, Ron. He’s not doing anything and he can’t help it if, well, er… you know.” He makes an awkward motion to his chest and flushes. He lowered his voice, suddenly worried that Malfoy may have unnaturally sharp ears and could hear every word he was saying. “This is exactly the type of thing Hermione is mad at you for.”
“If you say superstitious, I will hex your eyebrows off.”
“But Merlin was it worth it,” he sighs in awe. “You could go to the peaks of Chile and still not find a sky as clear as this.” No, only his little slice of the sky is this clear and this perfect.
A strangled noise of embarrassment and anxiety squeezed the life out of his lungs, all while he was standing there smiling like a fool under Ana’s patient gaze. His hands started doing weird motions in the air as he tried to articulate a well-scripted lie that didn’t make him out to sound like a complete nutter.
to have a pint right now. Tell me, does alcohol still taste the same?”
” She points over behind him and the man of the night finally in attendance.
“I heard that!” Draco folds his arms over his chest. He may have to protect himself from his own son tomorrow. He, Harry, and Albus ought to learn to be grateful for his sense. Never mind the amulet, but Draco makes sure every morning to give them each reminders of the astronomical occurrences happening that day, just so they’re all well prepared. Only Lily seems to appreciate his efforts. She was currently squealing over how pretty the condensed brew is. The amulet looks much like a glittering pink crystal when finished and Draco knew that out of everyone, she would find the beauty in it.
Draco clutches at his chest once they’re outside, the night’s winds not strong enough to blow away tonight’s failure. He doesn’t know whether the hyperventilating begins before or after Ron and Hermione say their goodbyes to them. All he knows is that it took everything in him to put on a fake smile and choke out a parting goodbye before he’s hunched over with his hand on his heart, breathing out far more air than he’s inhaling.
They set off towards the school, hand in hand as they usually do, but this time shrouded in an air of silent uneasiness between them.
Even Ron, who still wasn’t Draco’s biggest fan, is enamored with his son, teaching him chess moves with an easy patience Draco has never seen from him.
“Oh,” he breathes. “Okay.” He looks down at his joined hands. The question is stuck in his throat and he doesn’t know how to ask it without sounding like a fool.
Still not understanding what the difference was, Draco shakes his head, remembering that he doesn’t have room to question the peculiar ways of this family that graciously let him in for dinner. After several attempts he finally gets the hang of cutting, doing them slowly and precisely, not wanting to make any mistakes if carrot cutting was this big of a deal to Molly Weasley.
Blaise and Draco help bring Pansy over to Floo, her hands still clutching her stomach. “You’re the only responsible person in this house, twerp,” she groans out to Scorpius, patting him on the cheek as she and Blaise disappear into the flames.
Malfoy places his hand on his hip and sneers. “You look rather flushed. Is everything alright?”
has to learn how to cook something else), looks at him with intrigued eyes. He chews, pointing his mouth then to the pamphlet, in a silent reiteration of his previous question.
“Yes but—”
When Malfoy finally drags himself up off the ground, the cheers from the noblest of Gryffindor students are drowned out by the overwhelming laughter from both houses. Throwing the Snitch down, Harry nearly swallows his tongue at the sight of Malfoy’s dripping arms held tightly across his chest and his normally pale cheeks bursting with color. He looks so startled, so young and vulnerable as he stands trying to cover his soaked chest from the leers and wolf-whistles. Several Gryffindor blokes are openly drooling at him like wild animals while the Slytherins opt for sly smirks and cheeky cackles.
“Are you shy? ‘Cause I was shy when I met Al but then he turned out to be pretty cool.”
Ana sticks up her chin determinedly. “Then I’ll be there for him.” She sounds so sure of herself for a woman that’s only known his son for a week. Perhaps that’s all it takes for normal people, people not named
Draco rubs his temples when Kacia comes to talk his head off about how
“But wait, how do I know you didn’t just magick my wand into doing that?”
She disappears and he’s alone again, watching the moth continue its revolution around his wand.
Draco rears his head back in shock. “What?” Why wasn’t he agreeing with him? Why wasn’t he berating him for leaving his son at his friends’ house and stumbling around Diagon Alley pissed out of his mind?
Harry snorts childishly. “Well then in that case I guess I shouldn’t apologize for having a huge cock either.”
Sighing, he heads over to the study to rest his eyes for several minutes before he has to return to work. He’s grateful that he had his mother to watch over Scorpius while he was stuck in his office all afternoon. Scorpius didn’t require much attention and he was fairly good at entertaining himself at this age, but it never sat right with Draco to leave him unattended for long periods of time.
Pansy’s eyes widen and she nods slowly in understanding. “Ah, I see. So… how did he take to… you know,” she coughs, “
“Malfoy, mind staying back for a minute?”
Harry’s breathing steadies, and for a moment, Draco’s nervous that Harry may fall asleep on top of him like this. He wouldn’t mind if they weren’t on top of Harry’s desk and in the middle of a children’s classroom with their cocks out.
it feels good. From what he remembers, kissing is
“I’m sorry for leaving you.”
instead. “Well, first of all, that bloke sounds like a right prick.”
It was on the last day of August when Draco decided to be a better father than Harry Potter.
Potter puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder and gives it a little shake. His natural reaction is to growl indignantly. He hasn’t seen Potter since the trials, since Draco was paraded around the wizarding world as nothing more than a vicious war criminal. He can’t just touch him so casually as if they don’t have a shared history. As if nothing even matters and they’re just two wizards navigating the Muggle world together.
But Harry and Draco? He thinks they have a real shot. However, he doesn’t think sitting in stuffy sushi restaurants and fake smiling at each other was the way to get there.
Harry ignores Ron’s concerned,

are appropriate to bring in for Show and Tell.”
He had a point. An annoying but logical point.
Thank you to Ewilan16 who very graciously corrected my screwed up French on the last chapter.
An unpleasant sting in his nose travels up to his eyes. He covers them with the palms of his hands. “I don’t try to be irrational; I don’t want to be. It just…the irrational thoughts always make sense, it always makes sense in my head.”
Potter comes down the creaky backyard steps, stopping until he was a mere foot away from him. He’s still visibly shaken by Draco’s sudden outburst of flames and he looks on the verge of violently sneezing from the smell of burnt grass and paper in the air, but his voice is strong. “Don’t look so surprised. I think it’s clear that we’ve both matured enough to admit that the other person isn’t as mad as we thought they were. Don’t you agree?”
“Agreed.” Like any good best friend, Blaise Vanishes the liquor in Draco’s drink and casts several unfortunate jinxes on the bottle of liquor so that Draco won’t be tempted to touch the bottle again. Draco slumps down into his seat, hiccuping as he watches Blaise return the bottles onto a very high shelf that neither a drunk man nor a pregnant woman could reach.
Potter’s face looks wonderfully surprised and he actually jumps a little in shock. “Malfoy you don’t have to I mean, geez Al is a great kid and all but Merlin his singing—”
Draco snorts under his breath and gives Albus a secretive wink. “Later,” he promises. Potter’s face screws upwards. He may not have been able to beat him to the Snitch, but he could defy his authority as a parent.
She smiles sweetly. “Get over yourself.”
He’s in none of his usual spots and when he asks, Parkinson stiffly claims that he didn’t go back to Slytherin either. It’s like he’s vanished.
He looks up, his blue eyes widening when he realizes the four board members glaring at him. Galatea mutters a comment about moronic astrologists far too loudly and Draco shoots a glare at her. He may not be Jaspers’ number one fan, but that seemed to be taking it a bit too far.
In a voice thick with tears he asks, “Are you done?”
It was, in Draco’s humble opinion, a perfectly valid and salient reminder. His name requires the full command of the tongue and he should be proud of that. Not everyone has a name as celestial and highly as Scorpius. Some, he shudders, have
Harry squeezes back. They’ll get there.
He laughs at Harry’s lopsided smile before hissing in pain. “Hello Harry.”
The sternness in her mouth relaxes and Ana nods her head in quiet understanding. “Ah, I see. Scorpius is a bit on the shy side, but I think Al is helping him open up more to the others.” Her mouth curls into an amused smirk. “And wouldn’t you just love to know who Albus is?”
Though Draco would still hex him blind for daring to enter into his home with his son in the house, he’s glad the bastard was doing something useful with his life.
The Malfoy rule to say it like it is when necessary can be extended to Potter, but for only this one time.
It’s times like this where Draco really, really wishes he were straight.
Draco smacks him lightly on the shoulder, sitting his wine glass to the side and boldly taking his place in the crook of Harry’s outstretched arm. Not prepared for the sudden closeness, Harry startles in surprise before recovering to wrap his arms around him. “Shove it Potter.” The words are supposed to sound far harsher than they do, instead they come out as a content sigh.
“Shhh, less talking. More of this—” he guides Harry’s cock towards his hole, a moan settling into his throat as Harry pushes further into him. Harry was right, it hurt and God he loves it.
“And?” Harry drawls, refusing to take such a simple response as an answer. “I know there has to be some other reason. You never were the type of person to dedicate yourself to something unless you were very passionate about it.”
to do so all those unfortunate months ago.
Draco yanks the door open and Potter’s alarmed face is staring back at him, his glasses slightly askew but looking much more well-rested for a man who just let his sworn childhood enemy sleep in his home. In comparison, he must look like a stray crup with a severe alcohol problem.
Harry rolls his eyes as he goes behind his desk. “Pfft. We’re the same age.
Obligation. Such an ugly, manipulative word. Pureblood children know it by name like an old enemy.
Draco lowers his eyes. “Then make something up.” Scorpius pouts and he waves him off. “Go on, scram.”
His eyes dart around the room. “See what?”
“This isn’t over.”
She sighs again. “He’s in the middle of a crying fit right now, I’m not asking you to drop everything and come—”
Besides, even if there was any validity to the horoscope didn’t matter much. Harry Potter was extremely annoying, but he was simultaneously the most compassionate person Draco knew. So showing grace won’t be an issue for him, regardless of the situation.
Harry lets him drag him around, listening to Draco geek out about every single star or galaxy they pass, and doing his best not to look as confused as Draco knew he was whenever he spouted random facts. For Harry’s sake, Draco begrudgingly steers them away from the section dedicated to black holes because existential crises were a bitch, and this place was full of them.
” Scorpius fires, waving his hands around as if there was a loud explosion. “That’s my Dad’s favorite. He uses it when he’s mad.”
His voice is another murmured purr and Harry can feel his sweetly-scented breaths on his cheek. “Projection, projection,” he croons in his ear. The closer he gets, the harder it was for Harry to tell whether it was his breath or his body that smelled so invitingly sweet. Whatever it was, it was making it hard for him to concentrate on pretending to look busy.
When he doesn’t move, Potter takes it upon himself to heave Draco off the ground and onto his feet. Though when he tries to walk on his own, he nearly ends up falling flat on his face and into the gravel ocean below.
“Oh! I’m so very—” he chokes, “Potter?!”
Boot is the personification of his surname. He stomps in between Potter and Draco, easily pushing Draco out with his large frame, disregarding him like a piece of dust. Draco snarls at both Boot and Potter from behind his back. Potter’s all smiles as he talks to him, clapping him on his broad back as the two migrate to the front of the room, chatting, forgetting him.
Harry’s nose twitches. Maybe a gratifying
“Though have I told you that I love your eyes too? And that little mole in the hollow of your collarbone? And how much you care about Scorpius?”
Draco smiles, shrugging secretively. “Maybe a little.” No one else in all of London has the privilege of seeing the stars and moon as clear as Draco does. Of course he used magic and lots of it, in fact.
The closer he gets, he realizes that it’s not an animal wailing. It’s Harry.
Malfoy reddens and wraps his arms closer around his curved body. “Yeah. I’m gay.” His eyes stay fixed on the ground. “Only a few people know and now you do too. So like, don’t go around telling people alright?”
“Lesson plan my arse! It was completely tone deaf and Scorpius will not be answering it!”
She kisses him twice on his forehead, her finger tracing his dragon earring. Then, like the Slytherin she was, she pulls his hair back and whispers in his ear everything he needs to know about how to keep what was his.
Potter gives him an unexpectedly blinding smile. When did he own that? “Take it from me, kids are a disease,” he laughs knowingly, shaking his head an amused sort of disbelief.
“Draco… Draco,” Blaise says calmly, breathing in and out demonstratively to soothe Draco’s nerves. “Take a breath.” He does, feeling no better than he did before. Why does his heart pound and his hands shake over even the simplest of things? Must be the liquor. “Now tell me in plain words what the issue is. Keyword:
Harry shakes his head, not understanding Ron’s annoyance. Particularly when

Draco.”
Sensing his disapproval, Ana assures him, “He’s actually a really good boy Mr. Mal— Draco. Sorry.” Draco twists his lip up, unconvinced. People who smile like that never lead to anything good for him. They were too charming, too good, to open that people are always far too blind to see their true intentions.
happened.
He hums again, ignoring him as he checks the tea for the fifth time. Draco narrows his eyes. It’s been too long since Harry’s remembered that they used to be enemies for a reason. If he wasn’t so head over heels for this stupid Gryffindor, he would have hexed him in half. He does not do well being ignored.
Potter’s look is smoldering, even in the darkness. “Up Malfoy. Now.” Merlin, now he was using his parenting look on him like he was a child.
The Floo whooshes her and Marcéline away when Draco turns to look at Harry’s terror-stricken face. Oh Merlin. “What did she say to you that’s gotten you so frazzled?”

Draco casts the proper cleaning and protective charms, hissing at the cooling sting. It’s been years since he’s had to do either of those charms and it seems as though the discomfort never ceases to go away.
He snaps his head around and glares viciously at him. “Bloody—
“I... I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—” He does as his Charm School tutor always told him to do and pushes his pride down his throat, realizing that regardless of his curiosity, this was none of his business. “Sorry.”
“I’ll give it back, just hold on.” Harry captured Malfoy’s curious gaze. Harry wiggles to the orange in his hand to show him that two can play this game. The open juices flow down his wrist in a sticky trail of tangy flavor.
“Draco?”
He tunes them out, his gaze trained on Malfoy as the blonde watches with an open mouth and red cheeks nearly the same color of his fancy lipstick. Revenge literally never tasted so sweet. He sticks two fingers into the fruit and sucks them clean as he smirks cheekily. The sausage on Malfoy’s fork falls off into his plate with perfect comedic timing and Harry laughs, wiping the juices from his mouth with the back of his hand and tries to give the orange half back to Ron.
Maybe, it was time to show Potter a different side of himself as well.
“Speak now or forever hold your peace,” he trills.
He turns sharply to the left to reach for a quill and whips Harry in the face with his long braid for the
“Oh, nothing Harry. I think it’s best to let you figure it out for yourself, regardless of what Hermione thinks.” She leans up on her toes and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Good luck.”

“For Merlin’s sake Malfoy, can’t you get control of that thing?” Harry hisses, looking around to make sure Snape didn’t hear him.
Despite what his dreadfully confusing nightly wank sessions tell him, Malfoy wouldn’t be interested in him as anything more than a friend— if he even agreed to that. It was harder to keep his priorities in line as he watched Malfoy’s finely pressed green skirt sway around his thighs. First talk to him, then try to be his friend. Right.
He waves him off. “I know. But let me just show you. And if I prove myself to you, then I believe I’ll be in for some recompensation.” He cocks his head upwards. “Please?”
Suffice to say, Draco looked bloody good.
Scorpius takes his hand in his and bounces with it like Draco used to do with his own mother. “C’mon Dad, everyone does it!” His voice was on the thin line between reasoning and begging. Draco hated beggars.
Muggle or not, his grandmother would be appalled knowing that Scorpius wasn’t paying due respect to his educator. Narcissa Malfoy felt very strongly about manners.
“I said no,” he defiantly crosses his arms over his chest. Malfoy looks murderous. “You’re my friend Malfoy and friends don’t let other friends cry in trees by themselves.” Maybe if he called Malfoy his friend enough times, it may actually become true.
Draco smiles, hesitant and unsure if he’s allowed to do so. “I bet that was quite a shock.” His younger self is sneering in delight that Harry actually does have an Achilles Heel, but his older, smarter self remembers that he doesn’t need to be aching with spiteful elation, they weren’t in competition anymore. Unless there was another biscuit sale.
Before or after he had his toenail stomped off?
“Very normal, in fact.”
Harry’s jaw drops slightly at the sight of the previously calmly spinning water fountain and soft ripples transformed into a bowl full of high, violent tides. High tides are natural for a Full Moon and by the look on Harry’s face, he knows this too.
“Shove it, Potter. For whatever reason, Pureblood children were expected to be proficient in some aspect of music. I choose to sing and although she’ll deny it to the end of time, Pansy is quite excellent at the harp.” Looking back on it, Charm School was truly an odd place, even odder when he realizes that he hadn’t learned about fascinating subjects like Scorpius is now. Like photosynthesis.
Hermione inspects her amulet with a closer eye, the pink rock gleaming in the morning sunlight. “What’s it made out of?”
“Hm?”
Yet it would be even better if Draco could get his ever-increasing anxiety under control.
casted around them.
Harry winces, already envisioning the blowback of what he was about to ask for. “Okay, just hear me out but I need a really big favor from you.” He waits for her reaction but she only gives him a bored blink. Here goes nothing. “I need the Slytherin password.”
Screeches the train conductor. Draco can hear the engine revving up below the earth and he knows it won’t be long until the train is off for good.
” he whispers in his ear as Ron and Hermione chat with Ginny and Scorpius.
No one is supposed to be this aware of their own breathing. But Draco is, and he misses Hermione’s question as a result.
She rolls her eyes, sitting down next to him on the stands. “I said hello, Harry.” Her brow already sweaty from playing most of the afternoon. Harry smiles at her, resisting the twitch in his hands that whispers for him to reach out and touch her by the waist like he did when they were together. He wasn’t her’s anymore, they were friends and friends don’t grab each other by the waist and place their head on the other’s shoulders.
much for me to do that.”
Draco fidgets in place, ravenous for something that Boot and his insidious cock-blocking jabbering couldn't provide. His eyes ever so often drift towards Harry’s muscled torso, the outlines of his shoulder blades and spine flexing as he turns talks to Boot with animated hand gestures.
,” he whines.
He draws back on to his heels when the flames turn orange and Harry’s face is gone from the fireplace. “Fuck.”
Harry’s name spoken aloud only makes him curl up further into himself with regret.
No, no. The git was a snake, he had to remember that. Who cares what his arse looked like or what was underneath his poncy skirt?
Wall or desk?
Draco snarls, whipping around and successfully hitting Jaspers in the face with his hair from the way he was rubbing his round, pink cheek. He looms over Jaspers, his height and piercing glare speaking for itself. The sunlight coming from the large windows beside them was hurting his eyes, but he didn’t care, his unblinking stare earning him a quiet whimper from Jaspers.
He can hardly continue walking in a straight line when he sees Harry’s best friends seated in a booth near the window. They look decent, surprisingly. His face is still too freckled and her hair is still incredibly bushy but they seem to have grown into their looks with age.
“I can’t…
“Don’t care.”
The Calming Draught was wearing off, he can feel it from the way his heart was beating a bit too fast to be comfortable in his chest, but all he has to do is answer this one last question. Just one. He can do this.
“Isn’t this dangerous anyway? Sending kids out onto the streets and asking strangers to buy food from them?” He swore that this had to be breaking at least three Muggle laws. “Potter’s trying to get tiny children kidnapped!”
“Scorpius is an interesting character.”
Nuzzling against the soft fabric of Harry’s jumper he smells the earthy scent of woods on his skin and embedding in the stitches of his clothing.
The next meeting is, in Draco's humble opinion, completely unnecessary. Potter’s grand idea to ‘better improve student-parent relations’ is to engage in a reading session every afternoon for those in something called ‘afterschool’. Draco watched with disbelieving eyes from his seat in the back of the room as Potter explained that they’ll be with five year olds. Five year olds!
“I wasn’t snogging anybody,” he clears up. The thought of snogging a Slytherin, let alone Slytherin Prefect Draco Malfoy…
Maybe that is the change his falsely poetic horoscope foresaw. If so, he thinks he can live with that.
is nothing like the Manor. There’s history here, though not in the same pretentious fashion as the Manor’s portraits glaring down from the walls and the fancy antiques that mean virtually nothing when there are a hundred more just as valuable items in a single room. No, this history is different. Draco can see it in the walls, the chipped paint on the house, the tree trunk littered with tic marks and corresponding names engraved in the bark. He can taste April in the air, intertwined with the sweet Chamomile flowers planted neatly along the sides of the home.
Draco rolls his eyes digging his hands into his perfectly plaited hair. “It’s not because of the sodding chopsticks. It’s just…” he shakes his head, trying to articulate his words carefully lest they have another misunderstanding like the infamous ferris wheel ride. How can he accurately tell Harry that the intensity between them has somehow grown stale in the few hours since they were snogging like teenagers in Harry’s kitchen?
“Pansy! Will you shut the—” He coughs, noticing Marcéline in Pansy’s arms. “...heck up.” Bloody hell, Pansy knew exactly how to tame him.
Harry rolls his eyes. Prick. “Fine, I swear on my magic and on my ‘stupid scar’ that I won’t go blabbering about whatever ridiculous secret you’re about to tell me.”
“So other than them who are the other two blokes you mentioned?”
“Don’t!” He panicked. Then pauses, realizing that he was very rudely commanding Potter to not come into his own room. Or guest room, he supposes. Draco rubs his forehead. This was just getting worse and worse by the second. “No, just uh, just hold on a second. Please.” He trips over his feet to grab his wand that was laid carefully on the bedside table, right next to a vial of Hangover Potion Potter must have left for him.
odor of the Doxycide.
Draco looks at her. “What?” His voice is still raw but far better than it was twenty minutes ago.
His breathless ‘yes’ is buried under Lily’s squealing about the young couple and from the talking of the other riders. He hopes to Merlin that he didn’t just imagine it. Because if his ears serve him correctly, and he thinks they do, then he was positive that Harry Potter just asked him on a date. One
No, instead he was put on trial and publicly shamed for it all. In the spirit of saying it like it is, mental health was a joke. Only Hermione seemed to somewhat understand his frustration.
And yet, like the hapless fool he was, the first page Draco flips to every morning is the horoscope one.
“Excuse me?” Potter waves an envelope in between his two fingers. “Give me that,” he snatches the paper out of Potter’s grip.
“Who in their right minds would let
“Uhh…” He looks at the half empty bottle of wine. He’ll need more to get through the rest of this. His Mark feels unusually itchy.
It matters what sort of perceptions a child is shown. How do you think I—”
All in all, the last person he expects to see staring down at him with a raised brow and pursed lips, is Hermione Granger.
“Nurse’s?”
Ana leaps up in front of him and claps her hands together loudly. “And with that, let’s kick it off with Mrs. Yeon!”
Potter snickers. “So does that mean I can request your singing whenever I’m feeling sad?”
Potter peers over to look at Draco’s watch. “Sure,” he shrugs, “We have a few more minutes to kill.”
“You know you’re not nearly as scary as you think Malfoy.”
“They can and they did.”
(See the end of the chapter for
” There’s giggling on the second floor and Draco climbs up the stairs. “Albus?”
“I’m in if you are.”
Draco can honestly say that he’s never quite been the type of person to fall into obsession or to be addicted to something, but Merlin does Harry make him lose all pretense of his former self when his tongue is so deep inside him. Or when he’s on his knees, staring up at Harry as his teeth glide along the soft skin of his cock to remind him just who it was that was making him feel like this.
He sits down on his knees next to Harry and he doesn’t hesitate to kiss him after a long night. Their sons give various exaggerated groans of disgust, with only Lily aww-ing in approval.
“Don’t you and Mr. Potter ever get tired?”
Green eyes cut over to the pile of sleeping children pointedly. “Watch it,” Potter hisses, “Don’t wake the kids over a simple question.”
“Dad.”
It must be nice, being a moth. Having no worries except for finding the light in pitch darkness. Such a simple, elementary task to be given.
“Good afternoon everyone,” Harry says with that same disarmingly charming smile of his. Draco forces down a grin. Very fit indeed. “As you all know, the school will be holding its annual anti-bullying campaign next week. Areum, why don’t you share the ideas you sent me for the event?”
“Agreed,” he replies in a croaky voice.
The chatty blonde woman with awfully thin blonde eyebrows and an even thinner mouth claps cheerily for him and it’s not long before the rest of the group is clapping in unison. People move out of the way, an invitation for him to move forward in the crowd and stand up in front of the classroom.
“Why what?” Draco asks innocently. If he was going to ask personal questions he should have the good grace to ask them properly.
“What exactly are you asking, Harry?”
“That’s Mr. Potter’s owl,” Scorpius informs his friends, ignoring Draco’s pleading look to
eccentric. I am completely normal and frankly, rather offended that you would think any differently.”
Thank y'all for all of the kind words! Y'all really don't know how much I appreciate them.
Draco growls, “Yes, you—!” He pinches his nose. Despite the Eclipse occurring today, there was no risk of a detrimental magical occurrence or astronomical reason for why he shouldn’t let his emotions run wild and consume him. But there was a moral one. Letting his anger and frustration out on Harry would not do either of them any good.
She pushes past the throng of leaving parents and siblings, her feet kicking up some of the centuries old dirt on the platform. Draco tenses. She’s not going to make it. The train is going to leave and Scorpius will be gone, never knowing that his mother was calling for him.
When he’s done, his efforts are rewarded with a thick, expensive piece of parchment paper handed to him by Crass’ aged dotted fingers. His rejection letter. This one will go nicely with the other four he has collecting dust in his office.
Draco looks away and mentally creates a list of all the reasons why kids were terrible pests and certainly
It’s like he does this on purpose. Tempting him.
His thumbs twiddle nervously. “Sometimes my Dad gets nervous. Like, really, really nervous. I don’t know why but his hands will like, shake ‘nd stuff.” Scorpius lays his head on his hands, blowing a breath into the flames. “It’s weird. I never know what to do.”
Secretly, he’s ecstatic that Potter was making a fuss over it. But, like always, Draco would never give him the satisfaction of telling him so. He had much better things to do. Like child-proofing everything in his home before Saturday.
Draco is reduced to a muttering mess as Harry slowly works him open. It’s been so long since anyone has touched him this way that he nearly forgot just how good it was.
Luna comes later, bringing flowers, kisses, and light for Ginny with an extra long hug for Draco. Ginny seemed to pick up on her ex-husbands’ fascination with hair as well, constantly carding her fingers through Luna’s wavy blonde hair. Only, she’s extra careful not to muse up the bright sunflowers entangled in Luna’s luminous locks.
Though Eighth years weren’t permitted to play for their house, no one could stop him from playing a quick pick up game. Unfortunately, today’s match would be against Malfoy and the Slytherins. He can only hope that a Bludger knocks Malfoy out for long enough for the anti-potion to be brewed and for everything to return to normal.
He hands the note to Harry. “I don’t think you’re dreaming.”
In a smooth, steady voice, Potter recounts the story of a lonely princess trapped in a tower with her trusty terrier and stubborn steed. She devotes all her time to learning and reading books from the vast library in the castle, only to one day notice that the abundance of books in her library isn’t so abundant anymore and that every day, a new book disappears.
The waitress comes by to refill his water for the fourth time. “Merlin Malfoy,” Ron mutters, cutting Hermione off mid-soliloquy, “thirsty much?”
For a horrid little terror, Draco is beginning to think that the kid wasn’t half bad. Then again, he tends to like anyone who can get under Potter’s skin these days. His father scowls disapprovingly at him and sucks his teeth before turning his attention on a still sniffling Scorpius.
“It means Parent Teacher Association. Basically, I’ll be helping out around your school and doing… stuff. Important stuff, I’m sure.” He doesn’t exactly know what a ‘booster club’ was but hopefully it was better than that god awful Slug Club?
“I know I said this before but I truly am sorry for fighting you the other day. And for…you know….” He flushes, remembering the embarrassment on Malfoy’s face when he looked down at his soaked shirt.
“Draco!” Draco abruptly stops walking, rolling his neck and taking a deep breath.
Draco lifts his nose in the air derisively. “I can’t quite say the same for you.”
“Can we hurry this up? Some of us have N.E.W.T.s to study for,” snaps Bulstrode, her irritation directed mainly towards her pseudo-shagging Slytherins than the Gryffindor team. Harry never took her as the studying type or even the flying type but if it straightens Malfoy and Parkinson and gets this game starting sooner, then he’ll take it.
It’s ridiculous, because this was his first kiss in twelve years. And it was interrupted by a tattling seven year old girl.
knew you were a sodding ponce in school,” Harry reminisces matter-of-factly. “It’s not that hard to figure out.”
stares back at him, and the memory of first reading his favorite childhood book rushes back to him in a stream of nostalgia and buried anger. You don’t forget your first favorite book, and this one has aged well in his memories.
He's in way too deep, because he now lets Harry Potter distract him in ways that would have been unimaginable before.
Without warning a wild-haired, tanned child with a jungle of dark hair, suddenly breezes in between the two adults, in a race to the playing area, running like he’s about to miss the Hogwarts Express. Draco briefly recalls that it’s the same dark-haired child that runs into the school building every morning. It’s almost endearing that the boy enthusiastically races everywhere.
He scoots closer to Draco, his arms wrapped around his body; the cold seeping through the fabric of his thin jumper. Draco wraps his arms around him. He presses his nose into his son’s soft, lemon-scented hair. This was okay. He’s never needed anyone, not really. Not Astoria, or his father, or Potter. All he needs is Scorpius. If he was the only gift the universe ever decided to bestow upon him, Draco would gladly live with that.
the school and not away from it. “You look fine,” he insists. And he really does; glasses fit his face perfectly. “You are far more handsome than me when I was your age. A pair of glasses doesn’t change that.”
Potter’s lips thinned into a disappointed line. Whatever, not like he cared. “Pity. I was rather looking forward to it.”
“Someone’s hungry,” he notes with a quirked smile.
“You want to know what I really think?” Malfoy nods. Harry takes a deep breath and crosses his arms. “I still think of you as the pointy faced ferret as before. And definitely as the most annoying bloke in Hogwarts.”
“Out. I’m leaving Harry.”
The gift basket falls into a crumpled heap on the grassy backyard when Draco violently tosses it out the door. The comics spill out onto the grass, the cover image of Martin Miggs smiling moronically up to the grey sky. He’s never been happier to have a fence around his backyard because his Muggle neighbors will not appreciate what he’s about to do.
Harry raises a brow. “No offense, but he should have known that you didn’t like women. I mean… look at you.”
“No, you manchild. I’m taking your drunk arse home.”
He didn’t understand what the fascination was with informing him about magical grasses until he mentioned it to Ginny while they were studying together in the common room. He told her about the mix up between Goosegrass and Knotgrass the day of the potions accident, Malfoy’s insistent ranting about the grasses in Slytherin, and his odd fixation with the cherry lollipops Hermione gifts to him. When he was finished, she shut her textbook and rolled her eyes so hard it looked like it hurt.
Harry’s blood-filled thumb digs into the space between his knuckles. He’s just about to melt from his own fear when she pokes him sharply in the ribs with her spatula.
The watch on his hand ticks disapprovingly at this suggested new adventure. It was 4:50 already, and the boys will be wondering where they were off to if they’re not back by five. Draco took punctuality very, very seriously.
Harry shakes his head vigorously. “No, I
.” He gives a bow deeper than a house elf’s and laughs at Malfoy’s unamused face.
Tears threaten to spill over onto his hands again but he forces them back, his bitten lip aching from effort. Potter places a comforting hand on his ankle and the words fall out of his mouth, snowballing into an avalanche of his insecurities.
“Yes. I know.”
“You spiked them with Veritaserum,” Hermione says. “What exactly were you planning on accomplishing by doing so?”
He ends up buying all 100 boxes of the biscuits himself, his stubbornness refusing to let a Potter best him in anything, even a ridiculous school sale. At least the boxes didn’t entirely go to waste though. Pansy was particularly grateful for Draco’s donation to her pregnancy craving list and took all 100 without complaint.
Ginevra rolls her eyes, flipping the page of the paper with a flick of her finger. “I’m sorry, were you two
Harry puffs his cheeks like a fish, looking like Scorpius when he gets caught doing something naughty. “Ah, you got me there,” he admits, scratching gruffly at his beard. Draco is unimpressed by his humor and he lowers his eyes in embarrassment, his entire body deflating. “Look, I didn’t want to try anything with you until Ginny and I’s divorce was finalized.”
“This is useless,” he groans. “No one wants to buy anything.”
“I think it’s sweet,” Hermione states firmly over her wine glass. “Don’t be upset because your cooking is rubbish.”
Quidditch, money, work, politics— that’s what he and Blaise discuss. They discuss sex too, but not
His jaw aches with something morbidly cruel he has stored in the hollow of his cheek, but the charmed potion keeps it there.
The next three months are something short of a fantasy.
She still looks as if she’ll give up a quid of Muggle money rather than continuing listening to him speak, but at least his voice isn’t wavering.
A Hufflepuff whose name he can only recall with the help of a Pensieve.
“Oh bloody fuck!” Tears spring into his eyes and Draco wraps his thick braid around his mouth to avoid shouting more expletives. He hadn’t cast the strongest silencing charms beforehand, his eagerness affecting his spellwork. It didn’t help he did it wandless either.
He’s lying.
Harry gives him a small, teasing smile which Malfoy returns with a scowl. “Oh, since when did Saint Potter become an expert on the cisgender female anatomy?” He asks, his voice dripping in sarcasm.
“Not my fault you’re a sexual deviant.” Draco fixes his clothes back into their proper position. He’s always having to do that around him. “And I think I’m a bit too old for surprises.”
Albus groans loudly. “Do we have to wear this? It’s pink!” He slumps down in his chair. “I
He doesn’t quite know if he deserves an apology from a boy that was only telling the truth. He was a war criminal and in the spirit of saying it like it is, Draco’s fairly certain that he will never be more than that. At least, not when he was in England. Plus from the way James was fuming, he doubts he’ll ever get that formal apology. Luna should though. Her forearm is clean.
“—for the book but I must be on my way.” He wrings himself out of her grasp and sprints to the Floo. “Bye! Love you!”
She smirks. “Nice save dumbarse.” She shifts Marcéline in her arms. The little girl was surprisingly calm in the face of her mother’s squawking. Poor baby must be used to it. “I need to talk to you.”
“Thank you,” he breathes.
“You’re a good dad Malfoy. I’ll see you on Friday for the meeting, yeah?” He turns into the room to collect his pretend werewolf son before Draco could react to his unprecedented praise.
“Did you finish those carrots yet?”
Harry presses his body closer to Draco’s. Fuck, if he kept moaning his name in his ear like that, this may be over before it even started.
“Harry Potter,” he responses through gritted teeth. Just saying his name produces a schoolboyish sneer on his face. She gently brushes his cheek up and down with the smooth edge of her thumb, scratching the skin lightly with her manicured nail. “Apparently, Scorpius thinks he’s a real hoot.”
“Potter,” he says slowly, breathing deeply as he chooses his words carefully. If he didn’t know any better, he’ll say that Malfoy was nervous. “Would you perhaps like to go to the Yule—”
“He did,” Draco says gravelly. “A certain someone is going to have a very unsightly wardrobe malfunction in a few minutes and I’ll need your help to point it out to the rest of the room as loudly as you can. Do you think you can do that?”
Tapping her thin pink lips, she muses, “There has to be
“Merlin you’re beautiful.” Draco scowls and thumps him on the nose. “Sorry,
He still thought about the way Malfoy’s body felt pressed against him or the feeling of his breath on his face as he snarled at him. Harry wondered if Malfoy was aware that his new, er…
“It does for me,” James snarls under his breath. Draco adverts his eyes.
“What?” Squinting, he looks up and is met with a freckled face framed by thick, fiery locks of hair.
Draco tsks softly, rubbing his cheek with the curve of his thumb soothingly. Albus is still beside himself with laughter and Scorpius looks as though he may fall ill soon. “At least it’s a funny one, right?”
“Are you… are you on your period?”
Catching both Harry and Ron’s eyes in the crowd, he brings a skewed sausage on a fork up to his wet, smirking lips and flicks his tongue around it teasingly, causing an uproar of boisterous laughter from Parkinson and the rest of his goons. Harry wrinkles his nose in disgust as Malfoy puts the rest of it in his mouth; his eyes rolling back in mock pleasure as he pretends to gag on the piece of meat. Harry swore he could even hear him
“Scorpius!”
Ron’s eyes widened. “Yeah?” Merlin, was he drooling?
they casted around them is strong and Draco twiddles his fingers anxiously as he waits. In the name of professionalism, he says put in his spot at the front of the room, not going over to Harry and gripping his hand as he waits for their decision. His hand grips onto his wand, because it’s real. His braid, because that’s real too.
“Harry?”
He pokes his cheek. “How about singing?”
Draco blinks up at him. “Are you done yet?”
The headboard knocks as Harry thrusts into him. “And that is?”
“Never.”
There had been people before Harry, of course.
Albus pipes in, “Yeah, remember when I accidentally turned Dad’s teeth blue before his class?” Scorpius nods into Draco’s shirt. Albus snickers deviantly, “Then I did it again on purpose.” Draco smirks when Potter regards him with a cross expression.
His mother had told him to either do something about Potter or leave him be. So Draco, as the natural enemy of Harry Potter and hater of all people that hail from House Gryffindor, decided simply to best him in everything. That included beating him in ridiculous PTA events like the annual biscuit sale.
Draco blinks in bewilderment, looking at Harry for support. He only shrugs. “Oh. Okay. So do I just uh…” He awkwardly bumps his fist against James’. “Boom,” he lets it explode once they bumped.
“It changes everything!”
“Forget it Potter,” Parkinson waves him off. “I’m just here to get my
Not bothering to read the note, he jumps straight to the name signed at the bottom of the parchment.
But it’s what’s at the bottom of the basket that ignites him. Scorpius’ name is printed on several new copies of Martin the Mad Muggle comics.
“Only if you persist in acting like one Malfoy.”
He hears Potter’s breathing next to him when he says, “Scorpius blames himself for our separation. No matter how many times I try to explain to him that none of it was his fault, he just can’t seem to comprehend that when Astoria has made no effort to contact him since we left Paris.”
Smartarse. That’s certainly a trait he got from Draco.
The dragon constellation twinkles in response to Harry’s awed whisper. “Did you do this yourself?” His fingers twitch, as if they were ready to reach out and try to grab one of the twinkling faux stars above.
He doesn’t quite know how to explain that it was because he was terrified of being
Draco massages the pulsing pressure point at the juncture of his neck.
The witch at the reception desk for the Ministry purses her lips at his appearance, too upset by his presence to notice Harry standing behind him. He grabs onto Harry’s sleeve when a sudden bout of worry grips him. “How do I look? Do I look Death Eater-ish? Should I take out my dragon earring?”
them to me. Even Greg…”
Obligation his arse.
Draco snarls, yanking his hand away at the insulting implication. “Don’t be daft Potter. I’ll always come back for you.”
He finds himself a seat in the back, far away from the other parents talking amongst themselves and especially far away from Potter and Boot laughing together at the front of the room. Draco taps his foot impatiently and checks his watch. 5:05. The meeting was supposed to start five minutes ago. Where the hell was the sodding leader of this group?
Only he can hardly focus from the sound of giggling and laughter floating up to the third floor. After half an hour and with hardly two sentences written, Draco’s considering whether it was worth casting a silencing charm when Potter bursts into his office. He opens his mouth to chew him out for not knocking, a skill that even Scorpius had mastered, when he noticed a woven gift basket in his hand.
Harry raises a brow. Okay fine, maybe Malfoy wasn’t always planning some devious plot to take down Hogwarts from the inside. He couldn’t be doing much just sitting in the Library and studying for his N.E.W.T.s. He glances over at the Slytherin, watching as he takes meticulous notes from the History of Potions book.
Draco begins to snort in amusement before remembering that this was Potter he was talking about. His Weasel spawn aren’t cute or adorable, no matter how similar they may act like his own son.
“Wass dat?” Scorpius asks through a full mouth of noodles. Draco wrinkles his nose. He usually isn’t such a messy eater, but spaghetti has a way of bringing out the grubby side of any ten year old.
When he’s older and making the same mistakes that Draco is now, he’ll make sure to warn him about finding the unavailable so alluring like he does. He’ll tell him that not even a Malfoy can have it all, that some things, regardless of their attractiveness, were not meant to be had.
He flexes his foot. Barmy little arsehole.
“And that is?” His wife fumes next to him, exchanging cross looks with Hermione and Ginny. He turns to Harry, his face unusually serious. “I’m tired of seeing you two ignore each other as if the other doesn’t exist. This won’t end unless we stop hiding from each other. Fred and I never ignore each other even on our worst days…”
“You know, I thought Harry had gone barking mad when he said that he was teaching your son,” Ron recounts through a mouth stuffed full of the fancy little appetizers the waitress sat in front of them. “Still think he is.”
It’s freezing on his roof, but Draco would rather deal with the piercing winter winds than return to his office. It’s the only place he can think clearly these days.
“I try to listen, but how can I when you keep pushing me away?”
“Sing for me again?”
Whoever invented the idea of a play date should be hexed senseless.
to do anything. But I’ll hope that you’ll try to be honest.”
s by a comedic amount, though this seems to spur on Malfoy even more. The Snitch in sight and he’s readying himself to reach his hand down and grab it when Malfoy rams into his broom, forcing him to grip onto the handle for dear life or risk sending himself back into Madam Pomfrey’s care. They’re mere feet off the ground now, both beginning to bottom out to catch the Snitch before the other.
She draws one leg up to her chest. Hermione laughs, low and soft. “See? We’re more alike than I had originally thought.” She sounds as though she still couldn’t believe it herself. “Of course I was still in denial at the time. I was trying to be supportive and I was coming around to the idea of you two together, but not by much.”
As easy as making spaghetti.
I don't know if anyone here watches She-Ra and the Princess of Powers... but I just finished binge-watching the last season and I think I'm dying??? But like, in a good way??
“Pssst, Mr. Malfoy?” Albus whispers as if he was talking in the middle of a play to the stage actors. “Don’t forget the words.”
? “It truly is disturbing how awful men treat women. I’m sorry for not realizing it earlier. And I’m sorry for how terrible I’ve treated you before. Now that I’m a girl on the outside, I figured it wouldn’t do me any good to fight with my fellow witches. So what do you say, friends?”
His own wand is strapped onto his thigh, the length of holly begging for him to brandish it and hex Malfoy off his broom.
Harry’s there at the entrance of the kitchen, clinging onto the door frame as his tired eyes scan the shattered mess of tea, glass, and fresh blood Draco was sitting in.
The hand on his neck stops, the owner sucking in an anxious breath in his ear.
“Same thing.” He stands up, ready to drink his sorrows away in his office. No, smoke them away. That’s what he’ll do. “Get whatever you want.”
Draco stares at the picture of Marcéline, Pansy and Blaise’s gorgeous newborn daughter wrapped up in a dark green blanket, trying to decide where he should place the photo. The wall was a prime place to put any important artifacts such as this one, but his desk was far more intimate and closer to him while he’s working.
“It went well. It went very well Scorpius.”
“So I’ll ask you again; where is Scorpius?”
He shakes his head, reminding himself that he doesn’t care about the romantic afflictions of Slytherins and follows a healthy distance behind them until they’re in a relatively quiet area.
It’s a Waxing Gibbous, and he knows better than to Apparate anywhere in a rush during this time. He
It’s so bad that Draco actually
She says something he can’t hear, something that makes Scorpius laugh and reach his hand out for hers.
“I’ve tried to play nice with you Draco.” Finley looms over him, being one of the few people who were taller than him. As intimidating as he tries to be, Draco knows from experience that there are far scarier things then Finley Greengrass. His tea-scented breaths puff out onto his cheek as he snarls, “But clearly, we’re beyond nice at this point.”
—" the word rolls off his tongue and he snorts in amusement, “Who taught you that one? Granger?”
Scorpius is.
Call it paranoia, but Draco swears Potter gives him the faintest hint of a wink when he finishes his introduction.
Draco snickers. “That’s not true,” mutters Harry in his ear.
“Actually, nevermind,” he says, holding out his arm to Side Along. “Come with me, I know just the place.”
“Out. On Saturday’s Ginny takes them to her Quidditch game so they won’t be back until later. Sit.” He motions to the table before them.
His skin feels like it's being pricked by a thousand tiny needles wielding themselves into his pores. Harry was right, he does deserve better than what he’s giving himself. “I’ll go. To the Mind Healer again.” He takes a breath, his nails clawing into his folded arms. “And I’ll consider taking the potions.”
With a raised brow, Draco asks, “Jaspers, why do you keep talking to me? Everyone else here ignores me.”
Harry looks at his hand. Then at the door. Then at Draco’s hand again.
From across the table, Draco and Scorpius share a pained look. Without Harry by his side, it had become unbearably noticeable how much they did not fit into this red-haired, freckled family.
better, hell, he wrote the guidelines for why it was important
Draco thinks that he should have known better, all those months ago when he was preparing to leave for a conference for Apparition safety and he was shaking with nerves for weeks about the thought of leaving Scorpius in Astoria’s care. He never worried when leaving Scorpius with his mother, or Pansy and Blaise, yet he couldn’t help but fear the worst when he was whisked away for a week-long conference.
Potter kisses the crown of her red hair softly. “Sounds like a plan.”
Saturday you’ll be available?”
“Christ Malfoy, can you not be crude for just one moment?” Harry has never been more grateful for his school robes before. Malfoy’s description of his cock was far more exciting than he cared to admit. “Can’t we just talk about something else?”
And full of loathing.
Does his home address count?
“Astronomy, yes! Um, yes, I do astronomy. I mean.. I
Muggle friend; Potter can fuck all the way off.
Ginny twirls her broom in her hands. “If you say so, Harry.” She stands up, lifting his chin with the hilt of her broomstick like it was a wand. “And by the way, when I said Malfoy looks good, I meant his
on his head. He looks down. An acorn.
She’s gone before he can respond. He’s tempted to follow her and ask what it is that he needs to figure out, what in world did Hermione have an opinion about, and why in Merlin’s name would he need good luck for. But he doesn’t, because when he looks up, not a single pair of grey eyes are staring at him and Parkinson is nowhere to be found as well.
“Yeah Mr. Malfoy, the rides are back that ‘way!”
Draco melts again from the sight, though not in quite the same way as before.
” He doesn’t mean to be so blunt but it was such a shock. Draco Malfoy was gay? Gay as in he liked blokes?
“I feel weak,” he admits, burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck where no one could ever judge him for being so vulnerable.
His hands are everywhere, on Draco’s hips, in his hair, on the left side of his breast. Revealing the soft, creamy skin underneath the gorgeous robes was his goal. His hands tug gently at the white bowtie around his neck.
He can’t afford any more mistakes. If evenly cut carrots is his way of making up for some of his sins, so be it.
“Is that why you quit the Aurors?”
The metal chairs everyone is sitting in squeaks and groans whenever a person shifts in their seat, and he’s wondering if he’ll be able to cast a subtle
“James,” Ginny says to the scowling boy, “this is your father’s boyfriend Mr. Malfoy and his son, Scorpius. They are very excited to meet you.” There’s a strange glint in her eye and the infliction of her tone goes up one octave as she speaks to James. Draco has a feeling that if this goes sour, Ginny Weasley may awaken the pits of Hell with her fury.
They don't.
“Yes?”
Yet watching Harry attempt to sing songs to Scorpius, Albus, and Lily’s amused faces made him realize that he cared for him far deeper than he realized.
-ing every basket he gets.
Another completely self-indulgent fic finished!
Draco bites his lip to keep from laughing prematurely. Whatever Albus said must have been hilarious. He had to give it to him—the kid was supremely funny. “What did he say?”
“His name is Scorpius. Not Scorpion.” He ought to feel guilty for returning to his schoolboy ways, yet Draco can’t help but to lift his nose in the air and snobbishly announce in his poshest voice, “He is named after a constellation, much like I am.”
-ing away as she waits for an answer.
and Snape with another one of his dark glares, but Malfoy persists in provoking him with his childish taunts.
He pulls the lollipop out of his mouth, the red candy glistening with saliva. “Well, where do I start?” He taps his chin in thought. “I guess I’ll say that the tits are fine, for the most part. Bras are uncomfortable little fuckers, but worth it since they make my tits look so bloody good.”
Bloody fuck.
Pansy and Blaise’s owl was a gorgeous pure black hue, not white. His mother preferred to Floo him than deal with the birds. His eyes scan the stamped address at the bottom of the envelope. “North Sea?” His stomach drops. Azkaban. His father.
Harry stiffens beside him. “Erm, what?” He laughs nervously and runs a hand through his hair. “Who says that this is for going to therapy and the potions? Pfft, come on, please it’s not—”
Making a point to chew widely and swallowing loudly, Scorpius shrugs. “I guess. What’s a PT… is that an ‘A’?”
Draco doesn’t know how he managed to live in this house for so long.
Harry’s cock was wonderfully thick and heavy in his hands and he moaned appreciatively at the thought of it inside him. Or Draco inside of him. He doesn’t think he cared either way as long as
He smiles. “Yes.”
Draco opens his mouth to say that he wasn’t quite sure Pygmy Puffs should be fed overcooked spaghetti noodles, but it was already said and done. Princess could probably eat a Snitch and still be up and rolling around the next day. If not, there were plenty of other purple Pygmy Puffs for sale.
Ron drums his fingers on the table for several minutes, staring at Draco with an intensity that makes his stomach tie into knots. He leans back into the booth, his face giving away nothing.
“I’m so sorry Al. I’m really sorry Mr. Potter,” Draco smoothed his hair down when his cries intensified, this time for real. “I’m just really, really sorry.”
“—Malfoy,” Hermione guesses coolly.
“You’ll get used to it,” Harry assures him.
Not now. He doesn’t think he has the emotional capacity to handle Jaspers right now.
What an excellent start to his morning.
Draco’s heard that in some parts of the world, there were strangely high populations of wizards and witches, but he never quite considered London to be one of them. Looking around, he wondered just how many of these children were actually aware of the wizarding world or were magic themselves.
He sighs. “Neither did I.”
He doesn’t quite fancy the idea of placing the first photo of his goddaughter in the middle of a bunch of nonsensical looking calculations either.
When she said it like that, it actually
Draco can tell they’re trying their hardest not to let their eyes linger doubtfully for too long. He bets if they shift their perspective just a degree differently, they’ll see Harry and Draco, not Potter and Malfoy in front of them.
The room feels like it's filled with a thousand Full Moons as he waits.
Harry squeaks then blushes beet red. Oh, right. He rubs the back of his neck and gives him an awkward smile. “Ah well, that’s a bit convenient then eh?” He chuckles nervously, internally kicking himself for his timidity.
She gives him a pretty, slightly confused smile. “Yes, I’ll need your email address.” Her tone is patient but it only increases his nervousness further. He could just hear the seconds on his watch
“What I’m saying is, you’ve done whatever you’ve wanted to Potter for years; I don’t know why you’re acting so shy now?”
Draco nods, though his body feels cold all over. This wasn’t about him. This was about Scorpius. And if Scorpius was okay, then he would learn to be as well.
Ana is locking up her classroom for the day when they exit the room, hand in hand. Her smile is wider than usual, and she’s eyeing the bouquet, looking almost as if someone’s gifted her the cherry blossoms. She wiggles her fingers at them, keys jingling. “Have a good afternoon you two.” A sly wink is sent Harry’s way.
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s normal.” He rubs Malfoy’s back in what he hopes is a soothing gesture. Though it wasn’t particularly pleasant, Harry was thankful that it wasn’t some weird side effect of the potion. This at least was manageable. And non-magical.
Dark circles that adorn his pale face.
There’s something beautifully intimate about being able to laugh with a person while you’re both stark naked. Draco begins to care less about orgasming, something that he knew was going to happen anyway, and more about those moments when Harry absentmindedly runs his fingers up and down the expanse of skin. Or those endearingly small moans Harry makes when Draco rides him. Or better yet, the laughs from both of them when Harry tries (and fails) to talk dirty.
Sometimes, it feels like he hasn’t got much of his sanity left and Potter’s dangling the little bit he does have in his face with his smirking.
“Don’t apologize for something that isn’t your fault.”
If he’s being honest, something about the dark, bruising circles under her eyes and the directionless air about her chills him to the bone. That could be him. If he keeps pushing away everyone’s advice and his options, he would be doomed to dig himself out a hole just like she was.
He feels it in the ridge movements of his fingers when he casts a spell, in his legs as he stomps up the stairs into his office, even in his braid, which had been swinging in twitchy whip-like motions all day.
Ginny’s on him like a hawk, swooping down from the air with practiced ease. “Harry! What did you do?!”
“Scared to be beaten by a girl, Scarhead?” Yells Malfoy over the wind.
The fox twitches its ear and he takes a deep breath of the sweet spring air.
“Harry’s.” He nods decidedly, “We’ll ask Harry.”
“I think,” Hermione says after the waitress places their tabs on the table, “If Harry’s managed to move on, then perhaps we can too. Agreed?”
“Dad, are you okay?”
Unexpectedly, Harry laughs loud and deep in his ear. “Scared Malfoy?”
Harry grinds his teeth.
“I never said I didn’t like it,” Harry purrs. Draco licks his lips, enjoying Harry’s predatory gaze on his body. “In fact, I fucking love it.”
“I’m okay Harry.”
He presses a quick kiss on his son’s head and lays him down gently onto the bed, promising to return after he speaks with Ana.
Malfoy’s girlish cackles tickle his ears once Snape’s left to go harass another poor soul. He crosses one smooth leg over the other and flips his hair. “That’s what you get for using big words you don’t know Potter,” he trills in a singsong voice, playing with the curled end of his braid. “I mean seriously.
Draco pushes him away, even though his arms feel like noodles as he rams into Potter’s hard chest. “Don’t pretend you care about my son,” he spits. Stumbling away, he finds a nice spot on the ground to sit on, resting his head on what must be the cool glass of a shop window.
He slowly backs away from the blonde lady before she can make him her next victim, bumping into a solid back as he does.
The silence is stretched on long enough to be considered oddly comfortable when she says, “You know I read somewhere that some species of moths don’t have mouths.”
