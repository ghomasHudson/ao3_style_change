“Yes! He’s a Metamorphmagus and he changes hair-colour all the time,” Mrs Andrews said. “But Draco Malfoy is his guardian. When Mr Malfoy finds out I lost his son… I mean nephew in the ministry, my reputation is gone!”
Disbelieving and still a little shocked he looked after her. The Jarvey sat on her shoulder again and evilly grinned back at Draco.
But Robards slowly shook his head and put a hand down on Draco’s shoulder, “No, it’s fine. We’ll handle all of this tomorrow. Just go home and take care of your son for now.”
“Sorry,” Ackles chuckled and held her hand out towards the Jarvey, that climbed back up onto her shoulder. “I didn’t know where you were, so I asked Spike to find you. He’s like a blood hound.”
Harry came home a little late today. When he entered, a delicious smell filled his nose. Kelly came running to the door and greeted him with loud meows.
The old man nodded and told him about a bunch of souvenirs he had gotten for his wife at home. Nothing was as extraordinary as an owl though.
Her gaze fell on Teddy and back to Draco’s pile of work. The boy was quietly doing his homework, now having a satisfied smile on his lips.
Draco’s surprise was clearly visible but Hermione’s sudden shout out had attracted anyone’s attention and they gathered around them to look at the ring and congratulated them.
“For example that you’ll be back before Harry’s birthday and you can give away all the preparation work,” she said.
“No!” shouted the boy, almost crying, “Not Kelly! Let her stay with me! Take away all my stuffed animals and all my toys, but let Kelly stay with me!”
Ms Ackles giggled and stroke over her Jarvey’s pelt, that dozed in a small basket, “I’m just trying to make small talk. I for one am single, live alone and my brother Sammy is getting married next week to a beautiful lady. I have two younger brothers by the way. And you? You’re engaged and have a son. How old is he?”
Tylor smiled and replied, “My dad wants to meet with you for tea when he drops me off. Is that okay?”
“A… Dragon…” muttered Draco and just remembered to well Harry’s fight with a Horntail during the triwizard tournament.
The girl with uneven pigtails and stains of paint all over her school uniform nodded seriously and showed them the way to a small lounge that had a couple of bookcases and cushions thrown around the place. The Gryffindor grabbed the struggling house-elf and carried her there while Draco was casting a barrage of privacy spells in the room.
I've updated the last paragraph of the previous chapter for this one to make sense. Go back and check it out before reading.
“Aren’t you a bit zealous?” Draco exhaled lifting his hands to show that he was indeed unarmed. “The Aurors are forbidden to use lethal force at the apprehension… don’t forget that…”
Fear crept up his spine… What if somebody from Gryffindor noticed them. He couldn’t go Obliviating half the school because he didn’t know how to act around Malfoy without it resulting in some completely insane behavior.
“Me too,” Harry smiled, hugging him tightly with his healthy hand and feeling the strong steady rhythm of his heart under the fingertips. He was there, it wasn’t his imagination playing tricks on him.
"Why are you back in London? You faked your death. Why not just fuck off somewhere?" Weasley continued.
“And how many times have the Ministry and your Precious Order failed?” Draco accused, “They couldn’t even keep my father out of harm's way when he was in their custody… They all have turncoats and Death Eaters in their midst! Are you seriously that naive to believe that anyone would help me… even if you ask!”
And to make matters worse he was now surrounded by thoroughly annoyed Aurors who were itching to just beat the truth out of him. Harry being a Savior of the Wizarding World had saved him from being thrown into the ministry’s holding cell and interrogated part but he didn’t know how much longer he would have to drag out the inevitable if Kingsley didn’t show.
“Why does it sound like a read, coming from you?” she laughed and sipped a bit of tea from her cup. “I saw Mills at the bar with some little fella, who is that?”
“Right, imagine the bloody news titles,” Harry laughed a little and gave her a friendly pat on the shoulder.
Draco shook his head and began talking about parts of his time in Hogwarts, his life during and after the war and how he became Teddy’s guardian. A big dreamy smile appeared on his face as he remembered his first meeting with Harry after those four years.
Harry smiled and kissed Draco again. He was right. Five years ago all this would have been nothing more than a really bad joke. A bad joke that today looked like the conclusion of a crazy story and the beginning of a beautiful new life.
Barns sighed loudly, mumbled something about having to find out how the dragon got in the middle of the city undetected and walked off.
After the fourth time he finally was able to make out an animal, formed out of the light. Draco was stunned.
“W-wait” he said, “you are as old as me and already the head of all the Aurors of a whole state? How!?”
Harry’s tea-making had improved a lot since they had started dating and this Sunday-morning tea was delicious.
-phoenix feather. The colour is somewhat burned into the skin afterwards and that is a little painful,” she answered.
On Monday, Draco had to do a lot of work. Some fanatic apparently was planing an attack on the Palace of Westminster and countless Aurors had to be assigned to protect the city and avoid the exposer of magic to muggle. Because of all that work, Draco had picked up Teddy from school quite quickly to return to his office. Teddy sat in a corner of the office and did his homework. The boy was sad because of the separation from Kelly, but he had learned from his mistake last week. Then it knocked on the door and Hermione walked in. She had a pile of papers with her and a pretty, tricoloured cat. Loud meowing and shouting Kelly entered the office and jumped onto Draco’s work. She bumpered her had against Draco’s and jumped down to Teddy the second she noticed him. Like she was saying, “Appreciate me!” she threw herself onto his homework. The boy squeaked of happiness, when he saw his cat and immediately started cuddling her.
Crying tears of joy he asked, “You, the great Draco Malfoy, is working as an assistant?! I can’t believe it! How’d that happened? He gave you his daughter to work for him? No, wait, I forgot. You’re Draco ‘
“We just pay a visit to the Tatoo Artist in the next few days and see,” he said. “Don’t worry. Everything will work out, my Angel.”
At first Draco had wanted to remove those wild flowers that had probably came from another garden. Not only because they ruined the aesthetic of his carefully cultivated flowerbed, but also because those types of lilies were poisonous for cats.
About an hour later he started to prepare dinner. His cooking skills had improved since he lived here. He didn’t have house-elves, for Harry didn’t want any enslaved creatures in his house and he only used magic if it was necessary or if he was too lazy. Draco had used a lot of magic in the house in the beginning but had used less and less over the time. Most household chores, like cooking and redecorating, were quite fun and he had found out that self-cooked food tasted much better than food that was done with magic.
The minute hand of her watch jumping to 30, Josephine reached the fountain and looked around for Draco.
He was interrupted by a hasty knock in the door and a woman that just stormed in, “Commissioner Ackles! Have you found my son yet!?”
“So, Mr Malfoy” Mrs Andrews began, “Teddy had to write a text about what he has done wrong today. The thing is, that he only wrote that he walked off and caused worry. Also he wrote you threatened to take away Kelly,” She handed Draco Teddy’s text and said, “I’m afraid he didn’t really understand what could have happened.”
“Non of this is my fault, alright?” he interrupted her. “I’ve used a spell to see what he was dreaming about. Something you could have done too, by the way. When he took away my wand during the war, he felt guilty for that. And for some reason that haunted him.”
He let his friends come in and they walked through to the dinning room. Hermione had just finished giving out cake and Teddy was about to dig in.
Having really nothing better to do with his time, Draco spend most of his evenings with Josephine, who showed him the city, the best restaurants – magic and no-maj – and even took him to a night club twice. Even though Draco usually never went to such mundane places like night clubs, he enjoyed it. The club was purely for wizards and witches and it was refreshing to
After dinner the mood became comfortable in the burrow. Charlie had a blast playing with Teddy and entertaining him.
She chuckled and thanked him. Draco just repeated his question and for Teddy it was hard to decide on one. But in the end he picked the third one as well, saying that it looked most like Draco.
After changing in very casual cloths he returned in to garden. Harry and their guests had taken their seat around the table and waited for the person of honour.
Harry thought about something else. Something that could spice up a normal day and make a romantic day even better.
On Monday, Draco worked only in the morning and Harry still had some free days left after his Sweden -mission. Next week, when he would have to start working again, he would have to attend a lot of courses and advanced trainings to be prepared for his new job as an Auror instructor.
Josephine was absolutely stunned about the old and classic yet modern appearance of the Atrium. The floor was polished dark wood, the ceiling was peacock blue with golden symbols of all kind moving across it.
“America’s not that special,” Harry answered. “For example wizards and witches have only been allowed to marry muggles there for like the last 40 years.”
birthday and the celebration they had had this year. In 2004 they had celebrated Teddy’s first day in school as well as Draco’s biggest Christmas so far with all of the Weasleys and the Grangers. Even Andromeda and Narcissa had been invited and smiled on the big family-photo. Another photo from that Christmas showed Draco wearing his new Weasley-sweater for the first time. On the picture next to this one were Harry, Draco and Teddy, all wearing their sweaters. Harry’s dark blue one with the yellow H, Draco’s green one with the white D and Teddy’s yellow one with the black T. Teddy had been confused in the beginning why his sweater had a T on it and not E, considering his name was Edward but Molly had argued that everyone called him Teddy anyway and an E would have confused a lot more people. This Christmas had also been the Christmas at which George had learned that Teddy wasn’t named Teddy or Ted but Edward.
It’s been forever that he had held a baby. When he had gotten Teddy, the boy had already been two months old, but considering that babies could hold their head only at an age of 19 to 20 weeks, he knew how to handle an even younger kid.
. And who’s Surname would we take? I mean Harry certainly won’t take Malfoy and I’m not a hundred per cent fine with Potter either. I mean, Draco Potter?”
“By the way,” muttered Harry and shuffled around in his pocket, “Draco and I got something, we wanna show you.”
They moved to the laboratory and the young Commissioner called out for Doctor Fowler. A middle aged, stressed looking man with a lab-coat appeared around a corner.
“So…” she tried to open another conversation, “you’re the personal assistant of the Auror Commissioner. I don’t have an assistant. Quite unfair.”
Draco smiled brightly and said, “Well, as for the unicorn… I practised the Patronus charm and it worked. And my Patronus… well, it’s a unicorn.”
“Harry is family. Are you really still jealous that you lost your boyfriend to Malfoy?” Ron asked sarcasticly.
“Yes, contrary to Harry and Ron I actually listen when you tell us about your science experiments. Thank you very much for your help, Hermione,” he said, about to hang up.
As he carefully opened the ribbon and unpacked the box, Teddy almost exploded on the spot of excitement.
In the afternoon Draco sat on the couch, reading a book. Suddenly he heard the growling of a stomach. Teddy stood on the staircase and looked like a beaten puppy. His hair was white, his eyes red from sobbing.
“Lets say, if it wasn’t for Harry, I would be different today,” he said. “In a lot of ways actually. It was his fault I did a lot of stupid things, but he also helped me to change to the better, especially ever since he re-entered my life.”
“Out of the way, Sir!” Draco screamed, grabbed Robards jacket and his wand and pulled the old man away from the burning building to the other side of the road.
“Can you keep her with you until the celebration on Sunday?” Draco asked. “I can’t exactly hide a living creature in a closet for a whole day.”
of October. Tomorrow was the anniversary of the Potters’ death and therefore Harry and Draco wanted to travel to Godric’s Hollow and put some flowers down for them by their memorial in the village’s centre. Afterwards, they would meet Hermione and Ron for coffee and tea. Last Wednesday on the 26
Teddys smile became bigger and he buried his face in Harrys shoulder. But only for a second before he realised how much he had to tell his second dad.
Draco nodded, “Yes. I meet Andromeda for brunch and we pick up Teddy together. Otherwise the school would haul me over the coals. They’re so suspicious.”
birthday,” he gazed over to his pal and said jokingly. “Now you’re the baby of the group again, Harry.”
“Oh just some germicide,” she explained. “The tattooing may have not hurt, but the colour is under your skin non the less and it is something like an open wound right now. The magic finishing will close up the wound a little but I give you a lotion to put on the tattoo for a week. After a week the tattoo is fully healed.”
“He wanted to hurt me and Teddy,” he told himself to put away the stupid idea of forgiving his father.
Their staring-contest got interrupted by President Quahog knocking onto Ackles’ back and wishing them a nice day and that they would meet again for Dinner.
Draco nodded, but all he could think of was the pain he felt every time someone noticed him and blamed him for his past. He always brushed it off and played it cool. He didn’t like to appear weak.
“I let you keep this thing, but you’re only using it in your room and during recess, understood?” he said warningly.
Draco carried the sorted files to Robards’ office. He knocked and stepped in afterwards. The old man with the grey hair sat behind his desk, writing a letter.
She just sighed. “Shut up, Fowler! That’s Mr Malfoy one of the Brits. We need your lab for a moment.”
Draco sighed loud, closed his eyes and let his head sink against Harry’s chest, “I know two weeks aren’t much but…”
of February hadn’t been very romantic either. Teddy had fallen sick with chickenpox and had to stay at home for a week. But this year it had to be special. Andromeda had agreed to take Teddy from Monday to Tuesday. This way they would have the house just to themselves.
Draco turned to Hermione and said, “I very much appreciate your work, Hermione, but isn’t this a bit much? Mainly the wedding-stuff?”
Monday rolled around and Draco and Harry didn’t have sex during the weekend. Draco had just returned from Teddy’s school and put down his coat when Kelly ran into the hallway and meowed very loud and demanding.
“I know, I know,” Hermione replied. “And that’s fine. Is the Commissioner back already? We would need the DNA now.”
Blaise stared at him for a moment to figure out if he was joking or not. Then he started to laugh, so loud and exuberant that people were looking and even the owl in the cage gave a confused hoot.
of April 2005. Hesitating he grabbed the photo. Before he turned it around he took another look at Hermione and the bottle. On the label stood the name of the champagne as well as the word non-alcoholic. He turned the photograph and saw a black-white picture.
“Yes,” agreed Draco. “We know basically all the teachers working there. Just be glad you can keep the name Lupin. Otherwise McGonagall would probably retire the second she reads your name out loud.”
“Here this has never been a problem or a topic to debate over,” Draco added. “Americans think they know it all but they’re just slower than the rest of the word.”
For Draco it was a mystery why the Weasley girl was even here. She pretty much had a hate-boner for her ex and even though she was part of this family, Draco wouldn't have come, when he had been in her shoes.
He dropped his keys into the bowl on the small table and entered the living room. Draco leaned on the kitchen island, nibbling on an apple slice. Teddy sat on a stool at the island and read a book.
She chuckled, “Since you became,” she threw a quick glance at Robards, who talked with Peasegood, “his assistant, he’s much more organised and I get my documents back much faster. Don’t ever think you pencil-pushers are less worth than the ones doing the action. I gotta go. Robards!” she said louder and waved before walking away. “My assistant brings you the report from today tomorrow. I want it back the same day.”
“If it wasn’t for Teddy, I would have kicked Harry out the moment he had set foot in the manor,” he explained and lowered his gaze to the ring. He breathed out loud and stepped to the door, opening it, “I hope you can move on now.”
“So what?” he asked. “Teddy is my everything. I don’t want him to ever feel around me the way I always felt around my father.”
“My mom is already knitting a hat and tiny socks for the baby,” Ron said. “She asked about our feeling with the baby and a colour, because she just couldn’t wait.”
The boy stood in the door, his blue hair and pyjamas messy. In his hand he held a stuffed black dog and Kelly stood next to him.
He wanted to start reading the backs of the books, when he noticed Draco’s look out of the corner of his eye. A little confused he gazed over to him.
“Har, har. You are so funny, Zabini,” Draco retorted. “I’ve worked my way up, fair and square. Also, all of Robards children are like 30 already. Not really what I’m after.”
“Yes and no,” Harry said. “It’ll be just us, Hermione and Ron tomorrow. We wanted to celebrate early. Molly has planned something big for Sunday, though. I just couldn’t talk her out of it.”
The boy giggled, jumped off the bed and handed Harry a tie in the same colour as Kelly’s, “Can you help me bind it? I can do bow-ties but ties confuse me.”
Draco thought about giving back a snarly, sarcastic answer but felt not like it, “Her name is Cassiopeia and she’ll be Harry’s birthday present. What do you think of her?”
“Double the imposition you wanted to give him and another lecture if you have to,” Draco said, “I am sorry, that he ran off.”
His soon-to-be husband had already finished dressing. The white, tailored suit looked simply gorgeous, his hair was beautifully braided tied with a golden ribbon.
This time successful he jumped off his chair and stared at the young woman, “Bloody hell! What was that about?”
Ron pressed away a laughter, “Of course. Thanks for telling me. Grab a seat. We’ll start eating in a minute.”
A moment later a young boy with black hair grabbed the sleeve of her leather jacket and tugged on it a little.
The head of the Auror-Department looked confused at Draco for a moment than nodded, “Of course. I don’t have any other appointments today, have I?”
As they reached 2002, the first photographs with Harry came and the handwriting changed from Narcissa’s to Harry’s. In some of them Draco looked flustered and almost like back in school, young, snarly and energetic. But he smiled more and even laughed on those. In 2003 Andromeda, Hermione and Ron started to appear more often. A whole page was dedicated to Harry’s 23
“Yes, how are you doing? We haven’t talked in ages,” his former friend asked. As his eyes fell onto the cage he became really excited, “Is that an American screech owl? She’s gorgeous.”
Before Harry could be slapped by his fiancé, he jumped out of bed and picked Teddy up, “Let’s get you back to bed, buddy.”
“Yes, Teddy, the boy we had with us last time,” he explained. “He’s my dead cousins son and I take care of him.”
Andromeda smiled, “It’s gonna work out. I visited Narcissa only last week at the Manor and your father was quite calm almost like in the good old days.”
. They had seen that film almost a dozen times at this point. It was one of Draco’s favourites on rainy days. That was one of reasons why
“What about,” he moved closer to Draco and stroked away a wisp of blond angel hair, “I treat you like the prince you are. In bed. We can make it all about you.”
“Honestly I couldn't care less about America and their overly complicated MACUSA system and their shitty muggle politics and-”
“In eleven days,” Draco answered. “But he and his team call in tomorrow and after school I tell you everything. Okay?”
“It’s only getting better when they are about two,” commented Draco. “But I guess, it’ll be only truly better, when… probably never. Parents always worry their children.”
He moved on to a small bed with a small group of Ice Kings, a beautiful kind of narcissus with creamy-white petals that still were a little yellow in the middle. The narcissus’ would soon wither. But for now the puffy blossoms were still pretty.
“You’re welcome,” she replied. “Have a nice stay, alright? And maybe I can talk with Proudfoot, to widen out the beta test to the US.”
A small smile appeared on Draco’s face, “A family brunch. Sounds nice. At the burrow or at Hermione’s place?”
Ron asked to see one of the mugs and Draco handed him one of them. Hermione looked at it as well and complemented how crafty the boy was.
Then she chuckled and explained herself, “I was there then. It had been my forth year when the war began and the battle of Hogwarts took place. I saw you running over the battlefield. Surprised all of us.”
The young man with the platinum blond hair and the grey eyes smiled friendly and welcoming as he opened the door, wearing dark blue jeans and a white shirt with curled up sleeves. On his left forearm, Alexander immediately noticed the deatheater’s mark that he had seen in the newspapers so many times, but this one looked different.
Harry chuckled and replied that he didn’t take it personal. Silvia talked a little about her divorced husband, who had left her for a younger woman and Hope just said, she was happy how everything played out.
“Harry Potter,” said Mr Granger as he greeted him. “It’s a pleasure to see you again after all that time. How are you?”
“Oh! My! Gosh!” she gasped. “You haven’t?!” She took away Draco’s glass again and looked on the ring, “Harry, you have finally asked him?! I’m so happy for you guys.”
She hugged everyone for a moment and told them that the brunch would start soon and that the only one still missing was George. She rushed away as fast as she had come when Fleur called from the kitchen.
“And it’s been two and a half years,” added the blond man. “I really don’t want to meet this person again.”
Harry hunkered down and lifted the boy high in the air as he reached him. It was so good to have Teddy back. It were those rather long travels and missions on which he realised how incredibly much he loved not only Draco but also Teddy. He pressed the boy to his chest and Teddy hugged back with all the might he had.
“You… wanted to protect me this way?” he asked disbelieving, “And you pushed me into his arms later anyway?”
It took Draco a moment to realise what the other man had said, then muttered, “Right… Really? Is it already the fifth?”
“Yeah, the united states of America have 50 states,” she explained. “But the congress only cares about 48. Alaska is part of Canada’s purview and Hawaii wanted to stay independent from us.”
Turning around they saw a big black man, with broad shoulders, a muscular body, no hair on the head or in the face, and black eyes. The man wore a navy-blue suit with a white shirt, a golden tie and a golden handkerchief. Next to him stood two women. One was black as well, her darkhair braided to countless braids and pulled back into a tight bun. She too wore a suit in navy-blue with white shirt and golden tie. She also had big round glasses and held a folder under her arm.
The box was empty now, so he put it down, placing the book where the box had been. This time Teddy said nothing, just hopped onto Harry’s lap. Very curious Draco opened the book. On the first page was a self-drawn picture from Teddy, showing himself, Harry, Draco and Kelly. Underneath was written ‘
As the blond pulled the cloak away, Cassiopeia became more active. She flapped her wings a little and gave out a soft hoot.
Teddy came back holding a big box at least the size of Kelly. The cat herself carried a small box herself in the mouth and gave it to Harry.
It took Draco only about ten minutes to get ready. As to be expected he looked fabulous, with the black shirt, white and golden west, may-green tie and black trousers. Over his arm hung a long black coat. His platinum blond hair was tied back to a high ponytail with a small black ribbon.
“Alright,” he muttered. “Then let’s finish this quickly. I have to pick up my nephew from school and before that I have to prepare lunch.”
“Yes, it will be a birthday present and family pet,” he explained. “Would you please just do what I ask of you?”
’ however it suits you best,” Draco said and looked up to Harry again, who still stood next to him, half leaned on to his chair. “What are you even doing here? Don’t you still have lessons to attend to?”
“In his bed,” answered Harry and switched on the light. “He’s sleeping. Except your scream just woke him up.” Harry rubbed his eyes and put a hand on Draco’s back, “What happened?”
“Where is your class?” Draco asked, with a mixture of worry and anger. “Does your teacher know you’re here?”
The man behind the security stand looked unfriendly at her and she was just glad when she could leave again.
Harry gazed out of a window down to the garden. He felt so nervous, his heart in his mouth. Today. Today was the day. They had planned this day for over a year. And today on the 21
Inside the barrier the Aurors were busy cleaning up. While some repaired the House of Parliament on the outside, others took care of the inside and yet others fixed the clock tower.
Around four o’clock everything was done and prepared, except for the food. Should he start now? But then anything would be done way too early. On the other hand, he
“Thanks, very considerate of you,” he said and looked over to Hermione and Ron. “How is everything going for you with the pregnancy?”
He picked the cat up and walked down the hallway to open the door. In front of him stood Andromeda, the tall, slender woman with the light brown hair and a face that looked so much like his mother’s.
Harry wanted to kiss Draco on the cheek, but the blond had vanished faster inside the closet to change than he had a change to get to him. So he left the bedroom and opened Teddy’s door. The boy sat on his bed and fixed Kelly’s green bow-tie. Teddy was already finished dressing. He, too, wore black trousers, a white shirt and a matching west. His hair was blue and combed back.
“Stop dreaming,” Draco chided him, stepped closer and quickly fixed the bow-tie that hung undone around Harry’s neck. “The ceremony starts in ten minutes.”
“Hello everybody,” she said. “It is a pleasure to have you all here. I guess all of you wonder why we invited you today. It’s not a late Easter brunch or anything,” she said and everyone giggled. “No. I… We have something to tell you all.”
“I can’t talk to my father,” Draco breathed. “I can’t. And I have to get rid of this gruesome reminder of my past.”
He winked at the girl and with a small smile she waved him goodbye while he left. Out of reach from the muggle he sighed loud and loosened his tie a little. He should have known that the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes would be here too. The Aurors from his Department all knew the memory charm, but no-one did the obliviation better than the obliviatiors that were specially trained for these kind of happenings.
The tattoo artist flushed on her side, “Oh, sorry. Guess I was a little overhasty there. But congratulation non the less.”
“About becoming an instructor,” Harry explained. “I wouldn’t have to go on missions any more. I could spent more time with you and Teddy and I would even earn a little more money.”
“Amanda Proudfoot, yes,” he agreed. “She is a very great woman. I watched her career since I began working in the ministry. When I started she was still an Auror.”
“But I like organising stuff,” he pouted and sat up right again. “Change of subject. You have an idea? I really can’t figure out anything because he always claims to have anything he wants.”
“You have a son?” she asked confused and noticed the ring on his hand, “And married. Alright. Wouldn't have thought so. But I guess that’s what’s expected from the heir of the pureblood family Malfoy.”
“With the quill I’ll add this special colour to…” she stopped and it was visibly for everyone to see how her braincells were working. “You’re not allergic to any kind of organic pigments are you? Flowers, petals, leaves?”
Harry agreed and Draco continued with the second half of his explanation. He told about the meeting with his parents and the surprising reaction from his father. Due to this, he had decided to follow Teddy’s wish to visit the manor this weekend for teatime.
“You hold it, say the name of the person it’s connected to and said person will appear on the stone. Using this you can triangulate their position using the tracking spells. Avensegium works quite nicely. One can
She sighed put her passport away and other documents the clerk had pushed over the counter. She flourished her empty bottle of coke around and talked something about having impressed the higher-ups and being at the right place at the right time.
’. Draco turned the page and found out that the book was photo-album, filled in chronological order.
Harry’s and Draco’s bedroom had taken Draco the longest. First he had to convince Harry to change the wall colour. The white was too boring for him. Draco also wanted a new bed frame and closet. Harry had asked him harshly if he didn’t like the style he had furnished his place. Draco quickly denied that and said, he wanted to make this their place and not just his.
“What about those?” Harry suggested and pointed to the three different types of flowers in front of them. “Roses because they are your favourite, narcissus’ for your mom and lilies-”
Draco sat down at the head of the table and held his teacup over to Harry, asking nicely for a refill. After a quick singing of ‘
It hadn’t taken them long to decide on what to wear on their wedding in general. They both wanted white suits but they still weren’t sure about the exact style they would prefer.
Teddy yawned, cuddled into the pillows and closed his eyes. Harry walked out the room and quietly closed the door. Back in the master bedroom, he found Draco petting Kelly. The calico-cat laid curled up in front of him and purred. Harry laid down on his side of the bed, took off the glasses and switched off the lights. He slid closer to Draco and put his arms around him.
The secretary smiled and left again. As soon as she was out, Draco started cursing. No free weekend. After he had let off some steam he sat back down and started working. ‘
Giving her a displeased look he just continued, “Somewhere in the building with the… president. It would take way longer than if I just called you.”
Harry stepped closer to Draco and offered to hug him. Draco didn’t hesitate long and looped his one free arm – with which he wasn’t holding up Kelly – around the black haired man.
“Apparently,” she had replied. “The saddest thing about today though is, that I was asked like ten times, what my ‘
“Again? It’s like this woman is incapable of having a long-time relationship,” Draco mumbled while casting a spell, that made the wedding stuff float onto a shelf.
“T-thank you,” Draco answered. “But I didn’t do anything, really. I… was just here. Doing paper work.”
Draco looked it up in his pocket-calender and shook his head, “No, Sir. But it’s very likely that either today or tomorrow minister Shacklebolt wants to talk with you about today. I can drop back in later. In about two hours to do some organisations.”
Flabbergasted she stared at him before laughing wholeheartedly, “I guess so. Everyone in my family, except for my brother Jared were in the Horned Serpent. He’s a Wampus. You’re an only child right?”
Draco just chuckled and took Harry’s hand again, saying, “He’s the most famous. They even know him in America.”
The blond had to hold back a chuckle, “Well, I do not fill the leader position myself. I work as the personal assistant of Gawain Robards.”
His gaze fell on Draco. He wore a white apron and one of Harry’s band-shirts that were a little to big for him. His hair was tight back, but some wisps had fallen out of the ponytail.
The finely combed back, black hair became longer and longer as he stroked it back and it turned platinum blond. Having finished his move his hair looked just like Draco’s.
, he thought. He turned around when soft music started to play and Draco came back into the room. His hair was combed and braided. The band-shirt was replaced by a white shirt, a black vest and a red tie. The jeans were still the same.
Narcissa turned around to the two men. Draco’s hair was open and he held Harry’s hand. They stopped in front of the table and Draco put down the cat. He pulled out his wand and pointed it forward to his father.
Harry put his arms around Draco and pulled him closer. He buried his nose in the blond hair and tried to comfort him.
Alexander Barns owned a small shop in Diagon Alley. Today he would bring his son Tylor to his friend Teddy. That was exciting for Alexander because Teddy lived with the famous Harry Potter. When Potter had joined Hogwarts, Alexander had been in his sixth year and a great Quidditch fan, having played himself as chaser until the year before.
The weather in London today was grey with drizzling rain and strong winds. But in Wiltshire the weather was beautiful, warm and sunny. The sun shone from the clear blue sky, the gardens bloomed in all colours, the flowers filled the air with sweet odours and the manor throned majestically at the end of the long driveway.
Hermione was really impressed and asked if they had already modified them to have signal everywhere and being able to even call to crystal balls or mirrors.
He leaned back on the chair until the witch pulled back her wand and turned to the small desk beside her. Curiously, he looked at his arm. The dark mark looked much different now. Probably the most comforting to see was that the snakes head was almost completely gone. Only weak outlines were still to make out.
He started with the crème brûlée. He put cream, sugar, milk, yolk and vanilla in a bowl and stirred everything. After that he put it in small bowls and put it into the fridge. He started preparing the tomato soup by cutting onions and pepper balls. With a little garlic and oil he roasted it in a pot. He peeled the tomatoes and cut them into the pot to the other ingredients. Stirring everything, he added some water and broth and let it cook. He wanted to thicken it by boiling and looked after the crème brûlée. The crème nearly had the right stiffness.
Kelly meowed again and sat down right in front of Draco, waiting patiently. After he had taken off the shoes he walked to the kitchen, Kelly with her tail upraised by his side.
Noticing Harry and Draco enter the winter-garden again, Teddy ruffled through his hair and stroked it back one more time. Now it was short and black again.
Draco smiled satisfied. This was exactly what he had hoped for. Josephine bit her lower lip, trying not to burst out in laughter.
Draco muttered around why he couldn't stand America and the American magical government and how he despised his boss for just taking him along on this ‘mission’.
“Mr Malfoy, one last thing,” Robards called him back. As Draco looked back at him he asked, “The ring you wear. It’s an engagement ring, isn’t it. Who’s the lucky fella?”
“I don’t know,” admitted the Blond. “We have the dinner, the house to ourselves… What else do you wanna do?”
“24 years tomorrow,” Draco muttered and put a hand on his fiancé’s back. “Harry, I’ve made a decision.”
“This just came in from the personnel office,” she said. “It’s the usual. Some transfer applications, the records of the new hired Aurors and the most interesting job-applications Robards should take a look at.”
Teddy nodded. Draco made a gesture and invited the kid to him. Teddy came and hesitatingly climbed on Draco’s lap. He leaned on his chest and clawed into his shirt.
“Of course,” he replied. “I love you. If you want to talk out everything with your father, I’m with you,” he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the little box with the ring, “Forever if you want.”
For a moment they sat in silent before she said, “Hey, why don’t we drop the serious talk? I’m Josephine.”
He closed his hand like he wanted to claw deeper into his arm. But instead of his own arm he clawed into Harry’s hand until he heard his partners painful hiss. Confused, he looked down to his hand and let go.
“First, he has the memory of a goldfish and has to write everything down. He does not remember it. Second, he is somewhere in this freakishly big Ministry building-”
“No, of course not,” Draco denied. “I was in American due to a business trip and I bought her as a present for my fiancé.”
“Her name is Narcissa and she has, like me, hair that is a delicate mixture of white and gold,” he explained. “She’s very dear to me and had been my only ally during hard times.”
As Ron looked down at the – currently – blond boy, he said, “Ginny dropped her glass and it broke. Can you clean it up?”
This ridiculous question amused Draco and he answered, “Each flower has a meaning for me. Roses are my favourite, the white ones standing for purity, innocents and loyalty, as well as sweet goodbyes. The small white and yellow ones are a kind of narcissus, symbolising my mother.”
Josephine wanted to meet with Draco at the fountain. Coming closer she saw the group of golden statues on top of it and was able to identify them as a witch, a wizard, a centaur, a goblin and interestingly enough a house-elf. All of them spouting water into the surrounding pool.
“They can do that at about four to five months,” Draco said. “But even though it’ll seem endless right now, you’ll miss the simple times where you have not to worry about where they’re going.”
She gently took his hand and even before she could ask where Draco was, the blond aristocrat appeared by Harry’s side.
“Harry’s in Sweden on a mission,” he explained smiling. “And I just wanted to wait for the right moment.”
Harry smiled, “Sounds good. I’ll ask Draco tonight. He’ll surely say yes. I mean, it worked last Christmas.”
“Mr Malfoy,” she said. “Good thing you’re here. Can we talk for a moment with Teddy about what happened today?”
“Yes, we are,” answered Hermione’s mother. “I’m Jean, that’s Richard. But… Draco Malfoy… Honey, doesn’t this name sound familiar?”
Harry was changing in front of the open closet. His toned body attracted Draco and he hugged him from behind kissing him between the shoulder blades.
With the last sentence Lucius’ emotionless expression cracked up, “Marry? Harry Potter? What in the name of Salazar Slytherin are you thinking?”
Smiling Harry put his hand on Draco’s and kissed the inside of his wrist, “Yes, I understand. I’m very proud of you. My beautiful, brave Angel.”
“I… am, yeah,” she replied and it immediately came to her, from where she knew the name and looked at the man, “Then you must be-”
After picking up Teddy from school Harry and Draco met at the Tatoo Artist in Diagon Alley. Ms Grindal was just talking to a young woman. On the woman’s arm was a fresh tattoo visible, showing a horned serpent. The way it was drawn reminded Harry of the crests of the Ilvermorny school of witchcraft and wizardry.
His wife gave him an annoyed look, “You are definitely fan-boying too much over him. He’s just an Auror. Like your brother and my aunt.”
“I will never leave you,” Harry whispered. “I was just talking to Hermione today, about changing my field. I talked with Robards about it as well.”
“Teddy, you have to understand that your uncle as well as I were very worried about you,” Mrs Andrews tried to explain to him in a friendly and caring tone. “We do not punish you because we like to do it. This is for your own good, so you learn from it. Okay?”
“I just tell no-one that you are my dads,” Teddy decided. “By the way, Tylor has told me, that his dad doesn’t have to sleep on the couch any more. That’s good, isn’t it?”
On Sunday morning Harry, Draco, Teddy and Kelly stood in front of Hermione’s and Ron’s door. Teddy wore his finest clothes, a black jeans, a blue flannel shirt and a black west over it. His hair was platinum blond like Draco’s and his eyes were piercing green like Harry’s. It was his favourite combination, apart from blue hair and golden eyes. In hands he held a box of pralines. Draco wore similar clothes to Teddy, black trousers, a white shirt, with a dark green tie and a black vest, the chin long blond hair, tied back to a ponytail. Harry was as always the odd one out in the matter of clothing, just because Draco couldn’t order him what to wear. So he wore bluejeans and a grey flannel shirt. Even Kelly had a green bow-tie.
“You mean the man who tried to kill me?” asked Draco sarcastically. “The man who claimed to not have a son any more? You mean that person?”
So it broke out of her, “Oh Draco, I’m so happy to hear that!” She hugged her son and finally noticed the ring on his left hand, “So beautiful. Where is Harry? Since when are you engaged? Why haven’t you told me immediately? You could have called or sent an owl.”
Very confused the young parents looked at the blond, who they thought was the last likely person to ever get attached to muggle-technology.
Draco was a little surprised. He knew that Blaise worked in Hogsmeade and that Pansy had moved to Scotland some years ago, but he hadn’t known that they worked together.
Narcissa nodded with a smile and explained, “Yes, we debated long about this. The reason you went to Hogwarts in the end, was that it was the most convenient.”
The table in the winter-garden was set and Lucius was already there, waiting for the guests. Harry felt uncomfortable standing in front of the old wizard again. He had… a lot of bad memories to Lucius Malfoy.
Ollivander and Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Proudly Teddy showed off his new screaming yo-yo which he wanted to show his friends in school tomorrow.
“Understood, Ma’am,” Fowler said, handing the phone back to Draco. “Don’t touch my stuff, otherwise what do you need?”
“It is a magic cover-up,” she repeated, and continued explaining. “A normal tattoo would be done in half an hour. A normal magical would take me between forty and sixty minutes. All calculated for the size of your tattoo of course. A usual cover-up would take me about an hour to one and a half, depending on the size of the old tattoo and yours, a magical cover-up, takes well about two hours. A muggle tattoo artist would need up to five hours to do this.”
’ The first thing he did was sorting job-application, Auror records and transfer applications. One of the transfer applications caught his special attention.
Harry smiled and walked upstairs to say good night to Teddy. Draco stretched out on the sofa and put his thoughts about the dinner away for a moment. ‘
Ron glanced very surprised at Draco and asked him, if he really meant that. The blond just smiled knowingly and nodded.
“Wouldn’t you be?” Draco asked sarcastically and sucked in a heavy breath. “I-I mean… for the first time in ten or twelve years he tells me that he initially wanted to protect me from… everything. But in the end he… didn’t do anything. He let everything happen, drove me into Voldemort’s arms, forced me to smuggle Deatheaters into Hogwarts and even made me murder Dumbledore. He pushed me away after the war and… tried to kill Teddy and me as soon as he heard we were together.”
“Now, shall we eat?” Draco asked and gently grabbed Cassiopeia from below so that she jumped into his hands and from there she easily walked up to his shoulder.
Krista pressed the bell-button. The excitement in Alexander grew as he heard steps coming closer and the door actually opened. To his surprise though it wasn’t Potter, but someone else he remembered from Hogwarts. Someone way less pleasant.
“Kelly, look. Draco and I planted this rosebush,” he said and pointed to a bush with white roses, “Draco and Granny Dromeda said, white roses were mom’s favourite flowers.”
-pile. After that he skimmed over the other documents one by one. He found another application from Weasley, Ronald Bilius for a promotion to become head tactician and strategy-plotter for all Auror Teams. He put it to Harry’s file. Skimming the document of a job-application he heard how his office door opened. He looked up to see no-one at first. On second look he notices a blue hairdo.
“This is not against you, Harry,” Krista said, “but marrying a Gryffindor was the greatest mistake of my life.”
Draco blushed a little and looked away but Harry just chuckled and replied, “We’re not married yet. Only engaged. The wedding will be… probably around autumn, or what do you say, Draco?”
Hermione put the champagne bottle on the table and placed a photograph next to it, the back upside down. Harry saw the date on the back. 4
She stormed through the men to the counter and slapped her passport onto it, “Josephine Ackles, I’ve booked a portkey to London, Ministry of Magic.”
“Patrick Glithac,” she said and just as Draco had explained it, the moving picture of the young wizard appeared. “That’s him,” she hummed and repeated yelling of joy, “That’s him! Amazing! I have to get my team! Here!” she pulled out her valet and forced it into his hands before running back to the Auror-Department. “Go drink a coffee or tea or whatever! I’ll get to you later after this is done!”
The other woman reminded Draco a little of the late Nymphadora. Her hair was white and cut short, she wore a bomber-jacket and ripped jeans. Her silvery eyes were rouged with hard black eyeliner and eyeshadow. The resemblance to Nymphadora was really subtle. On the woman’s shoulder sat a big, overgrown ferret, with a long bushy tail and brown fur. Draco recognised this ferret as a Jarvey, a talking ferret.
Draco thought about playing a little longer, gazing at the slender and elegant ring that meant so much to him.
The great clock had just struck 15.30 when a giggling and barking ferret jumped onto Draco’s lap and put his paws onto his chest. Draco let out a scared, high pitched squeal, dropped his book and almost fell backwards off his chair.
“Yeah, it’s awesome,” said Teddy joyful. “I’m gonna take my book to Granny Dromeda and show her all my drawings. And my workbook from school. She’ll be amazed by my writing skills.”
They walked down to the great hall and met Hermione and Teddy there. The young woman wore a stunningly beautiful dress in light blue, a golden ribbon around her waist fitting it. Her hair was braided and decorated with Amaryllis’ such as both grooms wore them. Teddy was dressed in a black suit with a white shirt and golden tie, his hair and eyes had his favourite colours, that incidently fitted perfectly to the colour scheme of the wedding, blue and gold. He held a small pillow on which the wedding rings laid. Those were elegant and simple silvery rings made of platinum. On the inside their initials were engraved, as well as today’s date and the outside was blank.
The pain didn’t seize. It got worse with every second. Draco started to lose the feeling in his hands and feet. He hoped to finally pass out or to die, just to escape this torture. And suddenly it stopped. Draco opened his eyes to see the ceiling of the manor.
Ms Grindal smiled and took the bouquet from Harry, “Then I say thank you in advance and I would call you… I mean sent you an owl when the sketch is ready,” she sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose, “God damn it, why have wizard no phones?”
Upon seeing Ackles he sharply sucked in air, “Ackles!? What the fuck!? Why are there two of you and why is one dressed much better?!”
The blond looked up and saw his beloved. Without really realizing it he started smiling as Harry came running towards him. He sat up and greeted Harry with a kiss.
The shrieking noise the yo-yo made was incredibly annoying and Draco asked in a very low, very dangerous voice, “Why’d you get him something like that? Do you hate me?”
Hermione just giggled, “Yes, she’s very inpatient. We told her green. Now she’s just waiting for the initials to put on.”
Draco was immediately put off by this woman’s behaviour. The way she stood, the way she was dressed. The only thing missing was the… chewing gum, she was blowing a bubble with just now.
“Don’t stress yourself too much,” he begged her. “You have to think of the child. Babies are very vulnerable.”
Teddy pushed through his parents and said, “Draco wanna take Harry’s name and I want cake. Come on Kelly.”
It was similar all Saturday long. The child didn’t eat much of his breakfast and vanished back to his room after. Draco was certain that the kid would be starving in the evening.
“London,” Harry continued, “the muggle part mind you, has countless tattoo artists and studios. When Ms Grindal refuses to do the cover-up, we can go to a muggle artist any time.”
“It is, but I had to come to tell you,” she answered. “Ron and I already celebrated and I’m sorry if I interrupt your work.”
“Shh…” Harry shut him up, “Relax. We don’t have to marry tomorrow. We have time. All the time you need. We can start planing the wedding one by one as soon as I’m back from Sweden.”
Draco nodded, “Sweden. Two weeks. I tried to give the mission to a different team, but Robards wanted you to do it.”
“Oh my gosh, thank you, Detective, for finding my daughter,” she said. “And… this terrorist and the bomb threat? Is that really under control?”
He knew the mothers of these kids. When they met for play dates, Draco usually had a cup of tea with the mothers. Tyler’s mom Krista had been a little suspicious at first, but had quickly warmed up after realizing that both of them had been in Slytherin. With Mora’s mom Hope it had been a little different. Hope had been a Hufflepuff and when she had seen Draco for the first time, the only thing she had asked was ‘coffee or tea’ followed by the question about his favourite sort of cake. A little later, but only after being asked about it, she had stated that she didn’t care about the whole Deatheater thing. The way she had seen him act around the children had convinced her that he was a good man.
Harry slid closer and gently gripped Draco’s hand, pulling it way from the arm. Even without his glasses he saw the bloody marks Draco’s nails had left in his flesh.
Draco was left a little dumbfounded. Confused yet curious he checked the contents of the valet. It held about 50 American dollars and a bunch of coins, which he identified upon further inspection as Dragots and Sprinks, the American wizard currency. Going through the coins he found some whole Dragots, but mostly halves and some quarters. All in all it was about eight Dragots. Doing a little math he figured they were worth about two galleons.
Absody Grindal grinned and noticed the silver rings they both wore, “I didn’t know you two were married. Congrats.”
Harry lowered his arm a little and the owl eyed the boy. Very carefully he stroke over the soft feathers.
“Similar to you, Sir,” Draco answered. “I have to say, the American department is much better organised and taken care of than I would have thought.”
In her new, serious, authoritarian and a little British looking attire she now stood next to President Quahog. Her white hair was down, beautifully framing her face and she wore a black suit, the jacket open, no tie and the two highest buttons were unbuttoned. Only the sneakers had been a thing she hadn’t agreed to change. Draco had tried it with stilettos, pumps and even bootees but Josephine had stayed persistent, arguing that if
In the end the nine days went by faster than expected. The missing peoples’ case could actually be solved thanks to the Mirror-stone-potion. That started a whole conversation about the unwillingness of England to share information with the rest of the world and especially America. Draco was a little confused about the point, because the potion was currently tested in different countries all over Europe. But apparently, and Josephine had confirmed it, the Americans immediately felt left out and mistreated as soon as anything wasn’t immediately shared with them.
Checking her time she saw that she still had five minutes to go. Her watch still showed 9.25aminstead of 2:25pm. Quickly she stashed the bottle away and ran over to the security stand. Getting the registration for her 10 inch acacia wand with the horned serpent horn core wasn’t that difficult.
He plucked Teddy from his waist and walked back upstairs. He had reacted very firmly just now, mainly because he was still to tired to comprehend all of what just had happened. But he felt really happy. This was going to be a good day, he just felt it in his guts.
Shocked, he sat up to see the young boy. His hair was blue and he wore jeans and t-shirt, the same clothes he had worn in the morning when Draco had dropped him at school. The boy was standing in front of Lucius, the hawthorn wand pointed at his throat.
With a soft laughter Harry embraced and kissed him. Teddy tugged on their coats, trying to separate them, because their smooching in the open was super embarrassing. Instead of letting Draco go, he lifted the kid up onto his arm and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
Draco was doing his work in his office. It was Friday morning and most of his week’s work was already done. He would have a free weekend, that was if, Robards wouldn’t bring him new work.
Getting closer to the teacher and her class, Draco heard what exactly Mrs Andrews was saying, “How many times do I have to tell you? Edward Lupin, called Teddy, about this tall, blue hair, probably,”
“The pleasure is on my side,” Robards said. “Gawain Robards, Head of Auror-Department Ministry of Magic London. This is my personal assistant Mr Draco Malfoy.”
“Oh, Krista’s husband is one of those people,” Draco answered and sat down next to Harry who immediately put an arm around his beloved’s shoulder.
Through the cage’s bares he gently stroke over the owl’s brown feathers. She closed her black eyes and let out a cute cooing sound.
That moment the door opened and Ginny looked at them. Her friendly smile immediately dropped as she saw the two men.
Draco quickly looked to Harry, who just smiled and they sat back down. Then Draco started to tell about the now captured fanatic, the attack onto the House of Parliament and even about Hermione and her pregnancy.
Draco looked at his luggage, a big brown suitcase and Cassiopeia’s cage. He knew Harry’s schedule well. He would be busy with his courses for about another hour, giving Draco more than enough time to roam around the Ministry and doing everything he had to do.
Already seeing the desk at which she could get her portkey to London, a glimpse of hope came to her. She really couldn't be late for her meeting. Brits didn’t take it well when one was not on time. Punctuality and politeness were the base of British society. Not being on time was basically an insult. Or at least that was the picture Josephine had gotten from the British from what she saw on TV and particularly Draco’s behaviour.
He smiled gently and left. As he thought about the reaction Harry would have, when he saw the owl, he became all excited. Humming a joyful melody he returned to the Atrium and went to the small café. Blaise sat on a table in the small outside section. The cage he had with him held a giant, dark brown and black eagle owl.
Harry emptied his glass and muttered, “Maybe I should change my job as well. Auror-instructor for example.”
Taking off the box’s cover he found a blanket he had been looking for, for days now. At least this secret was solved. Underneath the blanket he found a big book, a small set of apparently self-tinkered mugs and a beautifully designed picture frame with a family-photo inside. Amazed Draco picked up the frame first and eyed the picture in it. The photo wasn’t old, only about two months. They had taken it on Teddy’s birthday. The frame was coloured in light green and pretty stones and silver sparkling glitter was glued onto it.
Draco seemingly became more uncomfortable with the situation and handed Harry the bouquet of flowers to turn up his sleeve.
Draco smiled proud with his work, “It’s fine. Just credit Mrs Hermione Weasley. This is all her merit.”
The witch seemed surprise, “I didn’t know famous Mr Potter was a muggle-born using muggle technology.”
It had took Harry and Teddy hours to convince him to keep the flowers. The deal in the end had been that the lilies could stay as long as they wouldn't endanger his roses.
Then she recognised a shining new thing on his hand. Her eyes immediately widened and she inhaled loudly.
Draco smiled and smelled the flowers, “They’re wonderful. Let me freshen up. We can eat in a second.”
Draco would have loved to slam his head against a wall or his desk, but he had to hold onto his dignity.
Harry shrugged and said, “Well, last year we went out and your birthday being on a Sunday this year, I thought a breakfast with friends would be just fine, especially if you don’t have to organise anything. You’ve been so stressed lately.”
“We’re very busy here, Mr Malfoy,” Mr Barns shouted. “We have to capture a dragon in Westminster Palace.”
“No. That’s why I only do it when he’s not around,” he answered and petted the small, round head, “I leave it up to him.”
Just when Alexander wanted to say something else, Tylor jumped in, “Relax, dad, Teddy’s dads are both super friendly and really awesome. Just don’t make yourself look dumb.”
Gazing into the birds black eyes he immediately felt connected to it. He had felt that once before, when he had first met Hedwig.
He followed her orders, saying the spell. The clear liquid hardened to a stone, the size of a palm with a damp downside and a mirroring upside.
There was a white pavilion, decorated with red and white roses and beautiful chairs for all the guests.
“I know,” the boy muttered. “But the lights confused me. I wanted to see what was going on and so did Kelly.”
Draco just agreed with her and Teddy didn’t really get the point of the conversation right now. He threw down his yo-yo and it came back to him with a loud whining sound. Immediately he felt Draco’s gaze.
“Her name is Cassiopeia,” explained Draco. “I know how much you loved Hedwig and after almost eight years… She’s not supposed to replace Hedwig. More like succeed to her. You like her?” This last question sounded insecure, as if he was afraid of having made a terrible mistake.
“I can and I will!” she interrupted her brother. “Do you really think I would listen to you two? I’m going! And I’m late already!”
“There… is quite a lot I have to do before I can marry you,” he answered. “You know, so I can wholeheartedly enjoy it.”
“Yes,” answered Harry. “And the Grangers will come as well. Hermione said they’re about 20 people so far.”
Harry let out a dry laughter. He had always been the youngest and Ron made sure every year that he wouldn’t forget it. And in September, on Hermione’s birthday, Ron would officially announce the ‘
“Well, as you know I was in Sweden the past two weeks. It was very educational,” he said. “I’m thinking of taking Draco and Teddy to a holiday there.”
Harry opened the champagne bottle, let two glasses appear and poured the champagne. They clinked the glasses and took a sip.
Draco asked about the three possible appointments in the following week, but non of those were compatible with his schedule. Thus they made an appointment in three weeks on Wednesday for ten in the morning. It was a free day for Draco.
The wedding ceremony happened at the Malfoy Manor. Molly and Narcissa had decorated the whole manor with flowers, colours and one of the gardens as the ceremonies location.
The witch smiled very bright now, “Oh, that is such a nice story. I guess I was just confused, because the boy looked like Mr Potter.”
Ron, who had came to the door with Hermione, nodded and patted Draco on the back, “It is, mate. Thus happy 25
of February 2005. Only four days left to Valentine’s Day. Draco was nervous. Harry was not. It would be the third Valentine’s Day they spend together. Draco wanted to do something special this year. Two years ago, Harry had to go on a Mission and last year the 14
Draco was incredibly relieved about his father’s reaction and sighed loudly. With a gentle smile Hermione came to him.
But Robards called him back, “As soon as you’re done with that, I want you to meet me at the scene of action, understood?”
Draco held back a laughter, his cheeks turning lightly pink, “Idiot… Of course not. Today is a day I would have never even dreamed about happening. If anyone would have told me five years ago I would one day marry the great Harry Potter, I probably would have called them insane. This is everything I never knew I needed.”
“No muggle-born,” Draco corrected her, “He is a half-blood, coming from the old and once respectable Potter family.”
Screaming, Draco sat up panting in the dark, soaked by sweat, his hair sticking to his wet forehead.
Teddy’s school had finished almost an hour ago. He hadn’t realised the passing of time. Everything had been so fast today.
As usual Teddy stopped on the stairs for a moment to make out Draco’s position. But today his uncle was nowhere to be found. Instead another face, with kind green eyes, messy black hair and round glasses caught his attention.
“One moment please,” she said and used the accio-charm to summon her pocket-calender. She skimmed through the pages and put her finger down on one before looking up, “Well, this week is packed. I have only three free spots next week and the one after that is already closed too. But in three weeks there is almost everything still free.”
“Oh gosh, he’s going to be master of sarcasm when he gets into Hogwarts. McGonagall sure is going to retire if she has to deal with him,” Hermione joked.
The curse hit Draco unprepared. It was like thousand knifes cutting and stabbing him. He had felt that pain only once before. How did his father knew this curse? Before he was able to react, another Cruciatus curse hit him and the immense pain started again.
“Oh very well,” she said. “I make my colours myself, with self-raised plants that are very reactive with magic, so magical tattoos can even happen. I have to ask about allergies so no-one falls sick, you know.”
“You look beautiful,” he said and walked up to him. He kissed him on the cheek and gave him the flowers. “I also got some chocolate.”
“Merlin, no,” he said. “Teddy’s father was a very good friend to Harry’s parents and something like a guardian to Harry. Harry is Teddy’s godfather and I am, like I said, his uncle. Teddy’s parents died in the war and the ministry reached out to me, asking if I would like to take care of the boy to rebuilt my reputation and clear the name Malfoy. Not at last thanks to Teddy I have a very good job in the ministry today. And a great family, too, of course.”
The Saturday started slowly. Yesterday Draco had told them very little about his trip, only the basic information. What they did, a little about Josephine, and the structure of the MACUSA. He also gave them the small souvenirs he had bought for them. A key-chain with an eagle for Harry and a T-shirt for Teddy that simply said ‘NYC’.
On the way there Draco explained Teddy again, why it was bad and not very clever to run away from the class.
“Alright Mr Malfoy,” she said. “I quickly explain what will happen next. For the tattooing I have this magic quill from the tail feathers of a rainbow crow. Naturally the tattooing shouldn’t hurt. If so tell me immediately. A minority of people is allergic to rainbow crows. In case you’re allergic, I have a fire-phoenix feather to draw with.”
“A… a tracking spell?!” she whisper-screamed sarcastically, “Do you really think we have not tried any tracking spell known to us!?”
“What are politicians good for on a wedding?” Teddy asked, who got lost in Hermione’s changes of topics.
Robards looked up and smiled, “Wonderful, Mr Malfoy. It’s been a while that I had an assistant as reliable as you are. Have a relaxing weekend.”
The visitors were curious and eyed the blond Lady but she just looked at her husband with a knowing look.
He walked quickly toward the department of Law Enforcement and knocked onto the office door of the deputy head. Luckily, Hermione was in and he could enter. The young woman sat at her desk, going through some forms. She was stunned to see her friend again, much earlier than she had expected and got up to greet him. When she was standing her belly was already good to see. When Draco remembered it correctly, the due date was at the end of October. So barely two months were left.
Draco kneeled in front of his rose bush in the garden. Disapprovingly, he eyed at the tall tiger lily that had planted itself last year. These lilies were late bloomers, usually blooming mid to late summer but this flower just seemed not to care about what other lilies did and the first of the big orange and black blossoms were already contending with Draco’s white roses for his attention.
Harry felt that nothing was fine. Draco wasn’t fine. But he obviously didn’t want to talk about it in front of Teddy.
Running towards Robards Draco got a good look at the Hungarian Horntail. It’s scales were black and bronze horns and spikes covered its body.
“I would say you’re overdoing the whole Valentine’s-thing,” said Harry, “but after the fiascos of the last two years it’s understandable.”
“I work as an owl breeder,” Blaise explained. “Pansy is in accounting. And you? You work here in the ministry, don’t you? What are you doing? Who are you pushing around?”
At half past two Andromeda and Draco apparated to Teddy’s school and picked him up. The boy was happy to see his uncle and grandma. After asking Draco several times if anything he had packed was at Andromeda’s place he went with the old lady and they apparated away. Draco returned home and started to prepare everything for the evening. He put up candles and told Kelly five times not to kick anything down and every time he remembered that the cat was with Teddy. He was so used to Kelly being around him when he was alone at home.
It was Wednesday and everything in the Auror-Department was upside down. The secretaries, assistants and tacticians, together with everyone who had something to say in whatever matter ran from one meeting to the next. The Aurors had lost track of the fanatic and the profilers were certain that he would attack Westminster Palace today. All active Aurors from the office had been sent to centre London to observe and protect the citizens.
She shook her had, “Nope. Gonna do it this weekend. Ron is organizing a big family brunch for Sunday. We’d love for you, Draco and Teddy to come, too,” she invited him. “The more the merrier.”
“Then would you like to follow me around the congress while your assistant goes with Ms Ackles?” suggested Quahog.
Very curious Ron and Hermione leaned forward, while Teddy just uninterested continued to eat his cake, dropping cream for Kelly now and then. With a proud smile Harry put a silver flip phone with a red and golden band and a small lion figure, on the table. Draco pulled out a phone of the same built and it too had a band but in the Slytherin colours and with a small silver snake.
He led her to the dining table, put Kelly down and they sat down. Andromeda complimented the big variety on the table.
“Hm…” Harry gave some thoughts to the question. “I could organize a new film. Or we could go out. Dancing for example.”
“I could really use a coffee right now, what about you, Mr Malfoy?” Ms Ackles asked and her eyes fell onto the tattoo.
Draco and Harry were all in on that idea and the witch promised to give the phones to her colleague tomorrow. They could get them back around noon.
He swung his wand and a strong, silvery string of light came from the tip, circled around the coffee table and formed a great unicorn, which stepped between Draco and his parents. It stood there for a moment, then vanished.
Curiously she had gazed at him. The cluelessness she had shown him had spawned a luxurious shopping trip the next day.
Ever since he had graduated he had watched the career of Harry Potter, how he had partaken in the triwizard tournament and how he had gained victory over Voldemort.
Teddy pushed his empty plate back and muttered, “It’s the first time you’re gone, Draco. Until now it has always been Harry. I wish I could go to America too.”
of June came faster than Draco had realised it. As he awoke on this Sunday morning he found his bed empty. Everything was flooded by light, the curtains and windows were open and warm summer air and the tweeting and singing of birds filled the room.
“Thank you, Mr Malfoy,” Robards muttered and signed the letter he was writing. “Please bring this letter to the owlery and send it for me.”
“Of course, Ms Grindal. Have a nice day,” the young blond woman said and passed Harry and Draco with a kind smile.
Draco had no interest in fighting about something so irrelevant and therefore said, “Well, books are always nice.”
“I’ve got you something that goes with the pin,” Draco said ominously, confusing Harry even more. “Close your eyes. And don’t peek.”
They entered the classroom and Mrs Andrews closed the door behind them. Draco sat down on a tiny chair next to Teddy. The boy was very quiet and his hair was almost white.
“Just take a seat, I tell Hermione you’re here and she’ll be right with you,” Molly said and vanished in the group of Weasley family members.
“That’s fitting,” she agreed. “You’re a great teacher. I just remember the thing in fifth year, with Dumbledore’s army.”
“Mr Potter, it is… a pleasure to see you again,” Lucius greeted him, “Draco. And you must be Edward Lupin, Teddy, am I right?”
A month passed and Harry and Draco began with the wedding preparations. Draco had organised a ring similar to his own for Harry and both of them had started to visit and inspect some possible wedding locations.
“Thanks that you make it sound as if my dad has ruined our family name,” Harry replied sarcastically.
He had looked over the yard as they had stepped out, searching for Harry, but who he saw made him way more happy.
“Consider it done, Mr Robards,” Draco replied. “I’m going to finish work after that. I have to pick up Teddy from school.”
being recognised. He felt like he could get out of his skin a little. He was also surprised how appealing the strict British pureblood aristocratic type seemed to be. At the end of his first night out Draco had collected about 20 phone numbers, four from women and the rest from men. He would never call any of those numbers but the fact alone that he had gotten them was like the greatest compliment to his good looks.
The guest room was no-more. It now was a boy’s room through and through. Toys laid around everywhere in the house and Draco had to tell Teddy twice a day to tidy up his stuff. Half the time it worked but after a day it was a mess again.
The celebration with the Weasley family was big and joyful as always. Molly had cooked up an amazing menu with some of her daughters-in-law and Harry had received at least one present from every Weasley. Ginny had been the only one to not give him anything, except the silent treatment.
“Right, because of time difference,” she remember. “It’s five hours forward, right? So it’s about half past five now in England.”
Draco chuckled and turned around to his nephew, “What do you think, Teddy? Wanna spend the afternoon with Hermione and she brings you home in the evening?”
He sat up and looked for the remote control. When he didn’t find it he took his wand and switched the channel with magic. He zapped around until he found a film worth watching. After approximately 20 minutes Harry came back downstairs. He asked what Draco was watching and he answered ‘
“You know what you can do?” asked Harry and Teddy shook his head. “Draw her a picture and write a letter. She will treasure it forever, I bet.”
“Something great, Mr Malfoy,” Robards replied. “You’ll accompany me on a trip to the American Ministry of Magic, the MACUSA, were I’m going to meet my American colleague.”
Draco carefully handed Rose back to her mother and Hermione carried her over to the living room, placing her in a cradle.
Recognising her visitors, the woman began to smile even brighter, “Merlin, blow me down! Famous Mr Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. To what do I owe the honour of your visit.”
Draco kneeled in the garden before his flowerbed and caressed the beautiful irises that bloomed next to his rose bush. The tiger lily was long gone at this time of year.
They stared silently at each other until the drinks came. The ferret now sat in Ackles’ lap and got petted by it’s owner.
Had he missed the end of school? Was it two o’clock already? No. The clock showed 10.34 am. Draco stood up and hunkered down in front of his nephew. He had his school-bag with him as well as a tag around his neck saying his name and that he was part of the ‘
the, quote, memory from the mirror-stone into a neutral tracking device. You just have to be quick enough to follow it around,” he explained.
On her arm she held her baby, that was dressed in a red romper with a yellow ‘R’ on it. She greeted her friends happily and presented the few days old baby.
Draco frowned and eyed the dark green tie he had given the other man. The white shirt and the dark green west made of finest new wool with the discreet floral print, which was shimmering lightly on the darker ground made him look incredibly good. His hair was combed and styled and made him look like a real adult for a change. The black trousers had a crease and the black Oxford-shoes were shining. On the bed laid the matching jacket to the trousers.
Teddy’s face darkened and he angrily gazed at Harry, “You said you would talk to him, so he would be good by tomorrow again.”
In the second picture bloomed three roses in the middle and a big bunch of narcissus’ covered up the snakes head. A big tiger lily covered half the skull on the right side and this lily had a long stem and a leave. The last sketch still showed most of the snake’s body. As in the first drawing, a tiger lily covered the serpent’s head and another blossomed just under the skull. A pretty, far opened rose looking to the left was placed between the lilies. Between the rose and the bigger, lower placed lily bloomed some of narcissus’. As in the second sketch the right side of the skull was covered in flowers. But this time it were narcissus’ even coming out of the right eye-socket. The upper left part of the dark mark was completely untouched, but it wasn’t uncomfortable, rather it made it… more elegant. Compared to the first two, the third sketch had very little flowers on it.
Draco almost spit out his tea again, “Oh my… I said you wouldn't guess, not the most impossible thing to ever happen.”
Before more questions could be asked Hermione sounded off again, “Alright, I’m back. Proudfoot says it’s fine if I give the formula to you. Wanna write it down or prepare it right away?”
Draco clawed in his left arm on which the dark mark was. The colour was faded. The mark was just a tattoo now.
She showed him a big box of luxurious chocolate truffles wrapped in a golden ribbon. The pathologist paused for a moment, eyeing the confectioneries greedily.
The man looked offended. He wheeled the metal shelf with a body bag back inside the cold storage, closed the heavy door, and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
“Oh, you wish, Potter!” Draco huffed, stumping the cigarette butt with fervor, “And that was my line anyway.
“Mister Potter, Irish for you, I presume,” she smirked gesturing for him to sit down. “Trying to keep a low profile these days, aren’t you? It was quite a feat trying to reach you… Sir.”
“Whoa, 27? Are you planning some sort of fancy dress party? Or have you finally found someone willing to impersonate Potter so you can get your prick wet for once?” another crafty grin danced on the lad’s face.
“Let’s get straight to the point,” Harry said irritably. “You wrote that there was some new development on the Malfoy’s case.”
This time Harry came first, letting out one more strangled cry and squeezing his muscles almost painfully. He was gasping something incomprehensible, his arms clinging to Draco’s neck as the blonde thrust into him a couple more times before losing himself in his own pleasure.
The brunette wriggled around in his tight embrace so they were nose to nose. From up close he could see his fair, almost translucent eyelashes, just barely visible traces of blonde stubble on his jaw and tiny specks of freckles on his nose and cheeks, so unlike a Malfoy persona the boy always aspired to possess. His thin lips were quivering in the sleep and his eyebrows furrowed as though he was dreaming of something unpleasant. He once again marveled at how inexplicably beautiful Draco was. In those stolen washed-out muggle jeans and a cheap polyester sweater, with his fringe falling in his eyes, he looked so human, so approachable, so tender almost. It made Harry’s heartbeat treacherously fast.
They lapsed into silence, watching the snow leisurely fall to the ground around them. In the distance, Hogwarts was a grey and lonely shape amidst all the white.
He knew that it was futile to bribe a vampire with money. He clearly was working at the muggle hospital, not for the large salary. The uninhibited access to blood was his main reason, but he probably needed to ration it to avoid suspicion. Hospitals have always had blood shortages without their employees nicking a few bags here and there.
“Even better, nobody will try looking for us here,” there was that mischievous glint in Potter’s eyes that would have sorted him right into Slytherin.
“Luckily, she isn’t… What is going on! Why are you… and the ferret… Were you going behind my sister’s back all this time?!” ginger’s voice was getting higher with every sentence he screamed.
He opened the envelope. There was an official letter stating that Malfoy’s probation officer was reassigned to Auror Williamson and that Narcissa Malfoy was discharged from Saint Mungo’s after her mental collapse that followed Lucius’ funeral.
"Curious, very curious," Auntie exclaimed, unperturbed by the damage the boy had done to her room."It is likely we are dealing with an Obscurial. Mr. Malfoy, I think it is too dangerous for you to be around this child."
“Mister Potter has asked to speak to you in person. You will meet with him and you will behave!” the Auror said in frustration.
“You should be! You need to fix it! And don’t ask for my help until you do!” she exclaimed and went away to the girls’ dormitories.
“I am going to need a lot of explanation from you, Harry,” he said before stepping out into the fireplace. “And you, Malfoy… you are lucky there is a maniac on the loose after your head and not my sister!”
“Don’t bother, he’s a stubborn one… Just send the Patronus already, or we’ll be here all day!” he barked. “I wish you would cooperate, Potter. We are all on your side, for once…”
“Alright…” and then he really needed not to worry about anything, the only thing he was worried is not too come straight away like a bloody amateur that he was.
Auntie let out a shriek and folded her enormous wings, she fell to the floor and started writhing in pain. Her bird-like appearance was quickly fading away into human features as the curse was making her body suffer through excruciating pain.
Harry glanced into the drawing-room making sure that the muggle worker didn’t get into any trouble and wandered upstairs to the library. The books there were mostly old Black heirlooms, many of them cursed and seeping with dark magic. However, his eyes wandered toward a small leather-bound book on the second shelf to the left. It was oddly out of place there and it looked like it had been touched more often than the others. He thoughtlessly reached out to touch it and barely put his index finger on the spine of the book, when the shelves moved to the side, uncovering a secret passage.
“Are you trying to tell me that they just let it all be like it is… And what about the kids?” Harry sat up in his bed, running his hands through his hair anxiously.
They were on the run and it would only be a matter of time until the DMLE would trace their magical signatures to that lousy muggle abode. He dreaded the moment when he would inevitably end up in Azkaban and never able to see Potter again. There was a slim chance that the Gryffindor would have liked to see him in the first place after he had betrayed his trust and stole his potions. But Draco wanted to pretend that somewhere Harry was still waiting for him and there was some future for them. He would have sworn he saw a silver shadow of a Patronus pass the dirty window before his mother insisted on putting up all the wards and shutting the curtains tight so as not to attract unwanted attention.
A white queen was dragging his poor knight to haul off the chessboard. Harry was distracted all evening, losing to Ron miserably. Ginny was working on her essay at the library and Hermione went off to check on the Potions’ project, so it was only boys that were sitting around the fireplace in Gryffindor common room.
He was already so close to coming but he wanted more, he wanted to feel Draco inside him, he wanted to discover what was it like to be taken by the person whom he really desired.
“Hold still”, he ordered and Harry felt like the wounds on his neck and cheek started to pull themselves together.
He needed extra dose fast, just to stop ruminating over something that shouldn’t have happened. Draco was determined to sneak into Slughorn’s storage once again, he wasn’t sure there would be the Philtre itself, but maybe if he found enough right ingredients.
Draco entered the party with his mother in hand. It was a masquerade so a mask of silver and black suede was firmly on his face, Narcissa was wearing a veiled hat adorned with a small flock of taxidermied birds holding ash berries in their beaks and talons. He was trying not to fix his dark green robes too much. There was a silver dragon embroidered on the fabric in silk and it moved around curling and uncurling its paws and sending rivulets of threaded fire on the sleeves or the back. Those robes were amazing and under different circumstances, Draco would boast and parade around in them, but that night they felt too heavy and uncomfortable and too loose in some places and too constricting in the others.
Draco was about to leave for the dungeons when he heard Potter call his name. He was alone, Weasley must have left already.
He realized that he probably needed to deescalate the situation, however, his bloody mouth just wasn’t listening. Something was amusing in the way that female Auror was terrified of a big bad Death Eater who was just barely of age.
“What I want is simple: you have something that my uncle would like to have. Vials with memories… does that ring any bells?”
“So what do you expect me to do? Tell him I know he’d fancied me or something?!” Harry shouted after her.
"I am a wizard after all…" Draco shrugged and proceeded inside the house to the parlor where her father usually spent his time.
How could someone involved with Corban Yaxley so closely be trustworthy after all? The bastard was in Voldemort’s inner circle and was responsible for taking over the government in the first place.
… a familiar sterile corridor with uncomfortable benches is filled with people… middle-aged women in colorful scrubs... a flock of distracted looking youths with notebooks in their hands and fear in their eyes… old women are complaining to the nurses about the waiting time… further into the corridor… some silhouettes caught his attention…  two men in crimson jackets stand out from the crowd of patients and medical staff… they approach the old man who is sipping the same vile coffee from the paper cup…
“At least the Wizarding Symphonic Orchestra had donated a lot of galleons to St. Barbara’s,” Luna waltzed from the Ravenclaw table and gave him a sympathetic smile. “My father interviewed the conductor and he was moved by Draco’s performance.’
Lucius Malfoy was lying in the coffin and looking surprisingly very much like himself and as though he was merely sleeping. It seemed muggles had their own sort of magic.
“I didn’t mean to get you involved,” she said. “I’ve made a promise to keep my father safe, to smuggle him out of the country before the DMLE gets to him. But he decided it was more important to find the leverage on his former associates.” She glared at the priest. “To stage another coup, so I had to stop him from knowing what I know.”
“Mister Duddley, this orphanage wasn’t founded by a wizard,” Auntie corrected him, “Marius Black was a squib, who had been disowned by his pureblood family. He tried his best to create a refuge for those who were unjustly abused by the sorts like Mr. Malfoy’s parents, no offense,” she smiled sweetly to Draco and something uncanny was in that grin. “You will find that most pupils here actually have a guardian on the outside, but we deem them completely unfit to raise those children. So the Ministry takes them away and they become our wards.”
“We’re terribly sorry, sir. However, on Saturday night we were still in Scotland. I was accompanying Potter at Hogwarts,” Kawahara was lying through her teeth with the most sullen and concerned expression on her face.
“Harry, I just need to nick some extra books from the library, that’s all!” Hermione was acting strange at that moment when she asked to borrow his Invisibility Cloak, so naturally Harry followed her using the Marauder’s map and a couple of disillusioning charms.
“Long story. Nott was plotting something against Malfoy and it was… somehow related to me as well,” Harry threw a successful offensive jinx at Ron, while he was distracted.
The sun was slowly settling down over the seashore and the sky was suddenly painted in brilliant shades of pink and orange. Wayward seagulls were quarreling somewhere in the distance. The waves were leisurely rolling onto the abandoned beach and ebbing away just barely touching his bare feet.
It has been almost two weeks since his mother and him were released on probation, Potter had kept his word and the cases did not even go to trial. There was enough evidence presented at the preliminary hearing and the Wizengamot had reluctantly settled off court. They still had to pay the reparations, so the estate in Wiltshire would be auctioned off soon, his mother would have to live in a small apartment issued by the Ministry and do her community service. And he had to go back to Hogwarts to sit his N.E.W.T.S. Draco was to have a meeting with his probation officer scheduled every month. He was not looking forward to it.
Draco was holding his head in his hands and shaking a little, the adrenaline rush was wearing off and the only thing he felt was utter despair. There was another wizard in the middle of muggle Florida, and that didn’t mean anything good for him. He might be some goon sent by Merlin-knows-who to spy after him.
“It is because of Malfoy, isn’t it?” Ginny asked. “He made you like that, he… that sleazy, disgusting serpent…”
“And how do we get there?” the Slytherin asked.  “I cannot Apparate... they’ll know where I am and I will get arrested!”
Harry remembered how Draco had helped him in the bathroom, he was angry and completely out of sorts but he managed to assist nevertheless, taking a no-nonsense approach and doing his job fast and efficiently. He had been wondering how many times the blonde had to treat his injuries to become that used to it, the thought had been quite disturbing.
She handed him a simple brown envelope with a familiar phrase written across the seal: “Tibi et Igni”.
The crowd erupted in cheers and applause as the plump girl from the meeting sashayed onto the stage, dressed in even more sparkly robes. The projector illuminated her face and the gems shimmered in her tall updo. Next to her a grand piano appeared and a tall young man sat there. He slicked back his platinum blonde fringe with one elegant move before starting the melody for the first song.
“Fine!” Malfoy snapped. “ Do as you wish, Potter. But I contacted Granger and she is here to pick you up, so explain all of that to her. I do not wish to remain next to a delusional prick who is a danger to himself and others for that matter!”
On the fourth day Draco wandered into the room he hadn’t seen before, it was another parlor, that must have been a ballroom too, judging by the size of it. The upholstery on the walls was original arsenic green and dark wood, the floor was re-varnished and there was an old piano by the window. He sat down at it, cast a spell to unlock the cover, and tried a couple of keys. The sound was a bit dull and rusty, the strings were probably out of tune and dried-up. He started playing nevertheless. The melody sounded twangy and off-pitch, but it was one of his favorites.
“Shouldn’t you be mind-raping your eyewitness then, instead of me.” gritted Draco through clenched teeth. He felt dizzy and nauseous and completely drained, their little tea-break didn’t help one bit.
“All of them, I guess,” Ginny snickered. “I know you can become one hell of an Auror, and if those bastards start at it again, I swear I will...”
Draco felt he was just given a bigger cell. He stepped out of the car and into his mother’s tight embrace, the Auror reluctantly returned his wand and a box of his measly possessions and after the wizards cast a few necessary spells the Ministry vehicle was gone.
“As much amusing as it is to listen to your thoughts, Mister Potter. I would prefer we discuss it… with words.” Auror Baelish passed him a small cup of Irish coffee and Harry was grateful for the bit of alcohol in it.
“How about we go to the Knockturn Alley one day, and I get you a wand?” Draco suggested softly, parting now smoothed hair into manageable pieces.
The sharp smell of ammonia hit his nostrils, then there was a slap on his cheeks and Harry saw blurry Kevin’s face in front of him. The chamber he was in did not look like a hospital room, the ceiling was too high and the furniture was way too expensive. He tried to move but his arms and legs were bound by magical ropes and he could feel the tip of the wand pressed to his throat.
He refused to do any more public events, giving the piano lessons at The Orphanage instead. Every weekend he would go to Saint Barbara’s and spend his time going over simple scales and chords with the children. His unofficial fan club of girls following him like the lovesick female classmates would follow Potter.
“Of course they would be uninformative since your lot keeps on reading them,” Malfoy retorted glaring at the Auror.
“If you hate Aurors that much, why do you want to be one of them?” Potter asked after a while. “You signed up for the Training Programme.”
A lonely seagull made a line in the air, not even fluttering its wings, catching the wind on its feathers, and soaring across the gray sky effortlessly. The sun was slowly emerging on the horizon, lighting the heavy clouds and murky water. There were a few visitors on the Brighton beach this early in the morning. An old lady was walking her poodle and some jogger was stretching before a refreshing run. They did not expect to see a vintage Mercedes-Benz roll onto the wooden pier.
“Everything is ready.” the funeral director, Mister Smith, announced and ushered them into the viewing room, decorated lavishly with all sorts of fresh flowers and black ribbons.
“Just bear with it for a bit, it’s not like I have enough Polyjuice to last you the whole day,” Amanda gave him another annoyed glance and sent a barrage of spells towards a curious undertaker who was bored waiting so instead he decided to eavesdrop.
She was obviously mocking his disheveled appearance, he still smelled of hangover potion and muggle toothpaste and some old aftershave he’d found in Sirius’ cabinets when trying to mask his foul odor. It must have been very amusing for the Auror to see The Boy Who Lived in such a sorry state. Well she asked him to be there, she might as well deal with it.
“One cannot make a person gay, Gin… Don’t be ridiculous! I knew that before, I just refused to acknowledge it and thought it would go away… It didn’t and I am sorry that I’ve hurt you.”
He tried not to seem too suspicious about what Draco had been smoking. But then he remembered about not hiding away his potions before and just wanted to make sure.
“Martha, Hailey! Take the others and barricade somewhere safe! Don’t get out of there under any circumstances!” the blonde barked at the girls and they quickly darted out of the room, serious faces, and no complaining.
“I would like you to handle the meeting by yourself this time,” Fumihiro gave him a fatherly pat on the shoulder.“This person wanted to discuss a few personal requests with you as well. Please make sure that the deal goes as smoothly as possible. We would really appreciate his help in the future.”
The events of their lucky escape were still replaying in his head, Williamson must have been bewitched or it wasn’t the Auror after all. They were not a bad team, he and Malfoy when their wands were not pointed at each other. They fought together in the same rhythm, the choice of spell was completely different, but the way both of them had some inexplicable understanding what to do next was exhilarating. Maybe if they got into the Auror training together they might make a nice team.
“I don’t have much of a choice,” the girl replied, “But you know, at least you seem like a decent person. Unlike my previous suitor.”
“You have no idea how much work we have actually done,” said Hermione, and she went on to ponder over the blueprints with the muggle, chattering away about measurements and budget and electrical wiring.
Harry watched as Nott’s eyes became vacant and his strained expression relaxed into an oblivious sort of smile. This lasted for about five minutes, and then Draco stood up, brushing off his knees and nodded to Hermione.
Granger came to his holding cell one day, she brought some of his normal clothes and muggle books and even tea and biscuits. She sat next to him on the shaky bunk and looked at him pityingly.
” Draco shouted and the werewolf’s deteriorating body was pushed away from the dark-haired boy with an incredible force.
“Morning, Mione….” he croaked and sat up in his bed, taking one medicine after another without complaints.
“Hm, you sound like that chap, Vernon… some or other,” the blonde looked at him attentively. Potter blushed and Draco’s suspicions were confirmed.
“It’s ridiculous how many free drinks you would get if you’re the Savior of the Wizarding World,” Kawahara added.
“You don’t know what you’re asking for, Potter.” the Slytherin said simply, “It’s not something you give up that easily.”
Harry decided to cast a Patronus to notify Andromeda and Narcissa that they were fine, he pronounced the familiar incantation but something strange happened: instead of a silvery stag his wand produced some small animal, it looked like a coyote or a fox of some sort. He watched the creature bouncing around the drawing-room in a slight stupor.
“What?! Granger, are you completely barmy… let a man rest, will ya?!” the blonde huffed, burying his head under the covers.
“I am sorry... for hurting you then,” the Gryffindor whispered and reached out to trace the biggest scar on Malfoy’s chest with his trembling fingers.
“Us?” Harry glanced at him incredulously, he didn’t look at all surprised to see all those muggle machines attached to him, probably because he knew what the hospital looked like before, “You’re the one they want… so you should go… I will stay, I wanted to talk to Kingsley and explain to him that it was all my fault and that you are innocent anyway.”
The dark-haired boy gasped and started rubbing Draco’s cock through his trousers more determinedly. It was too little friction and yet Draco felt his hips thrust upward into Potter’s palm. Shortly the Gryfindor opened the zipper and slid a cold hand over his erection, making the blonde shiver and kiss him passionately.  He was determined to do the same and soon they were both stroking each other, foreheads touching, hot breaths leaving the clouds of steam in the air.
The brunette opened his eyes and looked at the Slytherin with so much emotion that it took just a few strokes to bring him over the edge as well. They looked at each other like for the first time and a small smile appeared on Potter’s face.
“I sure fucking hope I heard that wrong, McLaggen,” Ron gritted, standing up and taking out his wand.
It had been the third day in a row that they met in this very interrogation room and Draco had a splitting headache almost every time those brown eyes drilled into him demanding the truth. He was embarrassed at first, this girl looked like a complete rookie, she was breaking protocol, smuggling tea and biscuits for her suspect and talking too keenly to a Death Eater scum that he was. Something in her demeanor reminded him of Potter, and that was very unnerving since it felt like it was him Draco was confessing to.
“Why are you defending him, Harry! He looked like he was about to curse you!” the girl screeched, crossing her arms and glaring at stunned Draco.
"Malfoy, is that you?" The man called out to him from his hideout. The voice was too familiar for Draco to ignore.
“Your innocence, you don’t just let people take it… it’s supposed to be… important,” Draco explained looking very serious.
“Mister Malfoy?! What in Merlin’s name is happening here? Why are you bothering my elf?!” the matron came into the lounge, Oliver Williamson standing behind her in his crimson uniform looking menacing.
“I am,” the girl agreed. “You know, Malfoy… We can still be friends even though we don’t work on the same project together.”
What could he know about the war? That man was probably an Auror or a journalist waiting to take a salacious story of Lucius Malfoy’s muggle funeral to print. How come neither Andromeda nor his mother hadn’t noticed anything off about him. Maybe he had bewitched the poor woman.
He shook his head and looked at Ron who avoided his gaze altogether. He had ruined their friendship with his stupid crush on Malfoy and it was painful to acknowledge.
“What about the memory of Father?! How could you do it to him?!” Draco shouted, anger sizzling inside him like a nasty acid, poisoning his mind.
“I will make sure to tell you then…” Harry said, moving closer to the blonde and running his hand lightly over his abdomen.
“Potter… Harry… I am sorry” Draco whispered carefully, taking him into his arms and trying to calm him down. The Savior of the wizarding word shouldn’t be doing that, he should be brave and courageous and not consumed by self-loathing and guilt, and he probably shouldn’t be queer either, but there they were.
“Remind me again, why did we switch them?” he asked breathlessly, trying to figure out if Williamson was still behind them.
They were leaving the West End, going over the bridge and blending in with the other cars, that were busy to get home before sundown, when Harry was happy to say that they'd lost the tail. The vehicle stopped in a deserted alleyway between two muggle building and they could finally catch their breaths.
“Potter!” Draco put his hands on the git’s shoulders and shook him into clarity. He was a good inch and half shorter and looked at him almost tenderly with those glossy eyes. “You have to sleep that off! You have issues… Look at you! You’ve already gotten completely pissed at four in the bloody afternoon! And you definitely don’t need to talk to anyone. Not me, for sure!”
“I think so… maybe we will even have a matching bruise,” Baelish laughed. “But that’s not the worst now, is it? Dying?”
It still felt as though she knew more than she let on and was talking about two nights of the full moon ahead of him and not the Anniversary commemoration. He had decided to floo Hermione once he returned to the Grimmauld place to share his suspicions.
The girl nodded obediently but pulled a face at Draco when Kawahara senior wasn’t looking and left the room.
