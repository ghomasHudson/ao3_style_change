“Are you really ill?” Harry asked gentler than earlier. But Draco shook his head.
Not ten minutes later Harry wrapped up his detailed recounting of his dream and watched his friends expectantly. Ron just stared at him in that flabbergasted way and Hermione looked at him with only concern in her eyes.
“Alright. Thanks, Saint Potter.”
Harry grinned. “What do you think about getting something to drink to warm us up?”
Harry’s heart dropped. “You did what?” Harry gasped shocked.
"Oh yeah? You walk around like you've got a stick up your arse anyway. I bet a cock up there wouldn't be something new to you."
Draco closed his eyes relaxing while leaning his head back against a shelf. “Are you planning on raiding the kitchens again?”
More or less convinced by that attitude, Harry finally looked up and almost instantly found him. Draco was pulling a taunting face at something Goyle had just said and shook his head. Theo seemed to have replied to it making Draco laugh. A little mean but his eyes still glinted with that happy spark that Harry had noticed more often now.
“Yes, I had a headache. Madam Pomfrey gave me some medicine, perhaps they put me out. Sorry but I have to go in now,” Draco replied hurriedly. Harry didn’t know what to say and so stepped aside and let the blonde pass. Then he entered the classroom himself and sat begrudgingly down next to Seamus who was the only one without a partner.
“Potter!” he called out. It almost sounded like a warning to his friends but Harry couldn’t tell for sure. The rest of the group now also turned towards him and eyed him curiously. Draco stood a little behind them so Harry could barely see him.
“Shut up, Weasel.”
Harry still tried to struggle out of the hold. “Don’t make me laugh. For the best?! You have no fucking idea!” Harry heard himself yell after him.
Draco opened his eyes and looked back at Harry. “What?”
Harry frowned. He was supposed to play Quidditch with Draco? And not only Draco but also with his friends? Harry nervously ran a hand through his hair while the gentle press of Draco’s hand against his calmed him some.
Draco grimaced. “Don’t you dare act like we are friends, Potter.”
“I think you should go to Madam Pomfrey. Or at least talk to Professor Slughorn,” Hermione announced decidedly.
Harry tried to recall last night’s dream. He remembered the anxiety and uncertainty. Draco didn’t seem like the anxious kind. And also, not really like the uncertain one. Harry observed how Blaise noticed him looking and whispered something to Draco before continuing his fight with Pansy. Draco looked up meeting Harry’s eyes. He furrowed his brows but then his look darkened and he attended back to his pumpkin juice. Harry turned away too and just now noticed that both his best friends were also staring at Draco. No wonder the change in demeanour.
“Then ignore it. Show him that it’s not important to you and that he shouldn’t be ashamed of it,” Hermione said insistently.
It was a morning like any other after the restoration of Hogwarts. The students were sitting at their respective house tables talking about the weather, school related topics or the latest gossip. Draco tried to ignore the busy chatter to the best of his abilities. His friends were just as much part of the typical mornings at Hogwarts so they were not helping at all as they tried to involve him in their meaningless conversations.
Instead of apologizing, I want to thank you all for your patience. I hope you enjoy this chapter <3 I'm currently working on chapter 8 and hope to finish it by tonight or tomorrow!
Hermione nodded in understanding. “Your-,” she hesitated a little. “friendship meant a lot to you, didn’t it?” She finished.
Harry eyed Draco thoroughly. In the dream his perception was a bit fuzzy but now he could observe every detail about the blonde boy. Between the already almost platinum blonde hair you could spot a few grey hairs if you looked close enough. And Draco’s eyes had a slight blue tint to them but only when the light hit them just right.
He cleared his throat and sat up. “Since the incident I’ve been having strange dreams.” Harry tried keeping his explanation as broad as possible. To confess in front of Draco that he was dreaming about him was even more awkward than he thought.
“Malfoy and Ron. In the entrance hall,” was the only thing he managed to gasp out. Harry reacted instantly and started to sprint without second thought. The entrance hall wasn’t very far but since Neville didn’t give any details, Harry wasn’t sure how serious the situation was. Harry’s heart hammered quickly in his chest making him ignore the students he nearly ran into. Not even Peeves could stop him right now.
“I am definitely not explaining this again,” Harry said and tried to tune out the following explanation from his friends to the best of his abilities. He just hoped that Seamus would keep his mouth shut about this.
“Fuck, Harry, why didn’t you tell us?” Ron asked still flabbergasted.
Harry eyed Draco worriedly. “Will you stop taking it?” he asked hopefully.
He sighed out in relief. The Room of Requirement. As he opened the door and got in, the first thing he noticed, was the large king-sized bed in the middle of the room. He sighed again and stripped down to his pants before he climbed in under the black satin-cover.
“Don’t tell me, you’re not a romantic? Despite the hand-holding fetish?” Draco asked challenging.
Oof looks like it's been a month. I would apologize if it were for any other reason so instead I want to thank you all for your patience, especially Sam. You are truly a sweetheart.
Draco’s fingertips started tingling and heat rushed to his face. He turned to Harry dangerously slow.
The following day turned out to be just as monotonous as every other one before that. The professors ignored yet again the fact that they were not the only ones that assigned homework and so, Harry was already overwhelmed before the week had even properly begun. Hermione disappeared every free minute she had into the library which consequently meant that Ron had to hang around Harry alone which didn’t really bother either of them, though. If Malfoy wasn’t brought up, there were no issues whatsoever communicating.
Hermione put her chin on her knee looking pensive. “What kind of dream was it?”
“Just wake him up,” Harry heard Hermione’s voice against his ear.
He felt the wet snow against his skin making him shiver. His heart was beating furiously out of anger. He couldn’t and would not understand why Ron didn’t even consider supporting him. Especially since Harry had made such an effort to keep his friendship with Draco separate from his friendship with others. Harry pulled his knees closer to his body letting the butterbeers fall into the snow next to him and hid his face in his hands.
Harry fidgeted impatiently during the whole breakfast. His leg kept bouncing throughout and kept making everyone around him just as nervous. Draco just didn’t seem to want to show up. Not even his friends did. Besides Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson who barely ate something for five minutes before leaving again. Even though Harry wasn’t particularly hungry he forced himself to eat at least a little. Ron just annoyed him more by giving him looks and also being in a bad mood so Harry started making his way to class earlier than usual.
“Go on.” Ron’s voice sounded strangely empty but neither accusing nor judging why Harry felt brave enough.
“Graceful, Potter,” Draco replied drily but he walked by the Gryffindor and to a chair to sit down. Harry followed but stood still in front of him.
Harry sighed and then slowly nodded. “He was just suddenly a different person. I don’t know if I should be angry, disappointed or sad. Most of all, it just confuses me.”
“What Ron is trying to say is that maybe it’s not the smartest idea to mention certain memories to Malfoy. After all you cannot know how he will react. I can imagine that he is already quite tense from the Howler he received from his parents.” Hermione tried to argue. Harry sighed. She did have a point but he couldn’t imagine it escalating. Not after the other night. Besides that, he wanted to talk about it really badly, no matter how inappropriate it might be.
“What are you doing here?” Hermione asked almost reproachfully as she came to a halt in front of Harry.
A little too late Harry stepped into the potions classroom. Slughorn nervously scoured a book while Draco waited impatiently tapping his quill tip against the table. With a soft apology Harry sat down next to Draco. Slughorn closed the book and slowly turned towards the two wizards.
“It happened again! I dreamed through his eyes again!”
“But-,” Harry started as he spotted the main role of their conversation enter the Great Hall with his friends behind him. Harry nearly blushed as he noticed Blaise. The Slytherins made their way to their usual seats as confident as ever.
Harry smiled stupidly. He was glad that Draco had liked that. Then they sat down on their robes in place of a blanket and Draco got a huge pile of books.
Ron stared at his best friend as if he had lost it. “Mate, you are in this predicament because Malfoy threw boiling hot liquid in your face. That was just a week ago. Are you sure you didn’t become a victim of his brainwashing?”
Harry shook his head his heart still hammering away. “What kind of joke?”
Draco nodded and Harry made his way through Draco’s friends down the hall. Just away. He thought he heard a lilted “see you” but ignored it. Merlin, that was awkward. It was obvious that Draco had told his friends about the dream. Harry felt a bit better as he had told his friends as well but he really didn’t need something like this happening again.
Ron’s eyes were still on Harry, unrelenting. “Are you actually studying with him?” It suddenly came from him a little to calmly.
Harry’s heart dropped. “I know,” Harry began. Theodore who had stopped in front of him furrowed his brows. “I know what Ron said to him. I have to talk to him.”
Draco smirked. “I am good for something after all, alright, Potter, I see how it is.”
Harry shot Draco a mock-offended look. “Of course not. But the break-up could definitely have been a bit less stressful,” Harry started observing his fingers again. “It was a decision we made together which was why we moved on quickly to being friends again. But her family didn’t take it as well. They kept doing sit-downs ‘to clear everything’ or others didn’t want to understand why, how, what, who, where. It was nerve-racking. By now everyone has mostly moved on but it wasn’t great to disappoint the only family I could call my own because I wasn’t in love anymore. Ginny probably felt similar things.” Harry sighed and looked back at Draco who was looking at him calmly.
“Don’t even think about running away.” Ron took out his wand out of habit. Malfoy wanted to do the same but he was carrying a couple of books so he stayed still.
Something must have woken him considering that he usually didn’t wake up between his and Draco’s dreams. Harry groaned and turned in bed before reaching under his mattress to grab the Marauder’s Map. He activated it hurriedly and feverishly searched for Draco’s name in the Slytherin dorms. He didn’t find him anywhere in the dungeons, instead it appeared that Draco was slowly but surely moving to the astronomy tower.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Harry breathed still taken aback.
But Draco didn’t appear at breakfast. Harry chewed his cereal nervously until he gave up half-way through. At least, Neville had the decency to ask if everything was alright but Harry simply shook him off with a poor excuse. He couldn’t arrive fast enough for Potions class. Harry doubted that Draco would miss this class even if he had to show up with pneumonia.
Ron groaned again and rubbed his hand over his eyes. Then he gave in. “Alright, fine but only if you get Mione to forgive me.”
Harry nodded slowly but didn’t pry any further. Uncertain if he should talk about the war with Draco now, he stayed quiet. He couldn’t quite tell how far he was allowed to go. Without feeling Draco’s emotions, it was much harder to avoid misunderstandings. Especially with difficult topics talking in a dream was really helpful.
“So? What is up with the golden trio tonight?”
“Of course, in the dream!” Hermione replied instead of Harry, as if she could not believe that Ron had asked that.
Harry just shook his head and got up. “Nothing special. I’m heading upstairs. Goodnight.” He was smart enough to give Ron and Hermione a few hours to themselves each day.
What was a friendship between him and an arch-enemy without a little drama.
Harry looked at Luna who was shamelessly staring at Draco. “Maybe he does have a conscience,” Harry said, rather jokingly, but Luna didn’t laugh. She gave Harry a serious expression.
“Maybe he didn’t want you to find out,” Ron considered out loud.
“As far as we know Harry is able to access Malfoy’s dreams and therefore also his memories. What we don’t know is how this even came to be and more importantly how it affects Malfoy,” Hermione summarised more for herself than them.
And he was right. Draco used that opportunity to stretch out and lean back holding himself up on his elbows. He let his head fall back and enjoyed the sunshine on his face. Harry stayed sitting and let his eyes wander over the lake. The sun made the small waves shimmer.
Draco snorted angrily. “Watch me.”
Harry nodded. “Maybe it shouldn’t.”
“If they don’t bring back Quidditch soon, Hogwarts will fall apart quicker than the rebuild,” said Gregory Goyle getting a grunt of protest from Pansy Parkinson in response.
Instead of making a biting remark over Potter’s lacking Potions expertise, Draco bit his tongue and ignored Harry’s question.
Ron patted Harry’s shoulder comfortingly. “That’s why I’m saying that it might just be your subconscious trying to make sense of it all,” he explained calmly.
“Damn it, Potter!” Draco grunted while he steadied the wobbly cauldron. Harry poured in the Flobberworm slime with a quiet “Sorry” and straightened up again. Draco gave Harry a quick dumbfounded look but let go of the kettle then.
Ron shut the book closed in shock. “You did WHAT?!” Harry shrugged.
Harry waited in front of the classroom fidgeting while his other classmates went in one after the other. He didn’t even mind Ron and Hermione and pretended to tie his shoes. Shortly before class was about to begin, Harry finally saw a dark-clothed figure with blonde hair walking towards Potions class. Draco slowed down for a moment as he noticed Harry but then fastened his pace even more. Harry had to cut him off unless he wanted him to walk by him.
“Thanks, you really saved me in there,” Harry said and handed back the scrunched-up paper.
A relieved sigh released the tense atmosphere and Harry let himself fall back into the couch. He knew that he couldn’t just forgive Ron but Ron probably felt the same way so this was the best solution for now.
“Could you tell Slughorn that I got sick or something?”
“Alright,” Draco rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. “You will give me the ingredients exactly when I tell you to, understood?”
“Potter, we have to go meet Slughorn,” Draco announced clipped. Harry noticed Ron and Hermione exchanging a look.
“Hey, do not forget that I am living through this as well. I almost fell out of my bed. Dream about Quidditch again,” Draco hissed.
Draco was fuming and wanted to show Potter just how much of a top he was but he was not going to give that Gryffindor the satisfaction of being able to rile him up. So he just laughed and rolled his eyes.
Harry tried to come up with ideas on how to get Draco to talk to him for the whole morning. Without detention they only shared the potions’ class and that was two days away. A dream-meeting was obviously not going to happen. Harry nervously kneaded his hands. He simply wanted to know what was going on. Maybe Draco really was ill and it was just coincidence that they’ve barely seen each other for three whole days. For Harry it was almost like withdrawal considering they spent some of the day and the whole night together. For every damned day. That the dreams had disappeared were what was worrying him the most. It felt wrong in a way. If Harry had done something wrong, he’d like to know about it. Harry was losing his mind trying to figure out what he could’ve done wrong. That Draco might’ve found out about his little snogging dream was something Harry didn’t even want to think about.
“Calm down, it’s not like I proposed to you or anything,” Harry quickly said flustered as he felt his cheeks redden slightly.
Harry nodded. “And how do I do that?”
“Nothing. We just talked. No curses, no injuries.” Harry smiled weakly.
“Surely, you both have learned from last week and will now work very productively with each other,” he replied self-assuredly. “Please go over the questions together that you had difficulties with on the test. I’ll be back in an hour.” With that the potions professor escaped the room. Draco groaned in annoyance. Harry could guess why. He was surely not the most competent study buddy. This would be a rather one-sided study session.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. “No, it’s not about what you did. It was kind that you even-,”
Draco looked up his eyes challenging. “They were breathing down my neck.”
Harry groaned annoyed. “Please don’t.”
“Could you explain that?” Slughorn questioned further.
“You will not believe this!” Harry prefaced before telling Ron all about what he just experienced.
Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott and Blaise fucking Zabini were walking towards them. Harry turned quickly to Draco to say goodbye but his friends had already noticed him.
“Well, yeah. But it is damn strange to suddenly see oneself standing in front of them.”
“It is not like I can hide much from you when you are haunting around in my head and then also feel my emotions.” Well, that was an explanation for Draco being so open with him. “Maybe you should explain to me rather why you keep dreaming about your ex.”
A shrill sound emanating from Seamus’ alarm clock ripped Harry out of sleep the next morning. Confused, Harry tried to remember the last night but there was nothing but dark emptiness. Harry was now a little worried. If this had to do with Draco’s affliction, he would like to know what it was. He definitely had to talk to the Slytherin.
Harry grinned to himself as he stabbed up a bit of egg lifting it up to his mouth and stilled. Hermione’s intense gaze was on him and did not stop as Harry tried to ignore the blush creeping up his neck and kept eating.
This time Harry did look at him. He couldn’t help it. Blaise looked definitely older than in the dream. He didn’t seem as uncontrolled but that must be the sobriety. He was a bit taller than Harry and damn it, he didn’t look bad at all. Maybe Harry could understand why Draco kissed him. Harry must’ve stared a bit too long because Blaise furrowed his brows confused.
Harry furrowed his brows surprised. Draco was sick? “Do you know what he’s caught, professor?” Harry asked but Slughorn denied.
Harry ignored the demanding tone and grinned cheekily looking back.
“Just wait,” Harry said looking almost disappointed.
“He always did. It was his only weakness and that is what kept you-know-who from gaining him as another loyal death eater.” Then she stood up and walked down the aisle to sit down with a few other Ravenclaws. Harry stared after her in fascination. He shot another look over his shoulder and noticed Draco looking at him questioningly. Harry just shook his head and turned back to his meal. Hermione and Ron hadn’t noticed the exchange as they were deeply invested in their own conversation. Harry sighed but continued eating his mashed potatoes. He didn’t want any more confusing thoughts so he just accepted Luna’s words for what they were.
Draco stayed silent for a moment before he relieved Harry with a light smile. “Yes, fine, silly. As long as your honourable best friend doesn’t attack me, I’m fine with that.”
“Ron is right. This is nothing more than ridiculous!” Harry spoke up again.
And with that Harry grabbed Draco’s hand without hesitation. He had a feeling that Draco had wanted to pull away for a moment but then he relaxed and clasped their hands. Harry’s skin began to prickle and his heart beat loudly against his ribcage.
“And my parents?” Draco asked slowly. Harry hesitated. Family topics were not really his area, unsurprisingly.
Before Hermione or Ron could reply to that, Neville joined them to ask them if they wanted to come for a walk and picnic later at the lake. The snow had melted away completely within the last week and gave the students at Hogwarts again a chance for an autumnal trip. Ron and Hermione agreed for Harry too.
“Oh, and Harry, any enlightening dreams you want to share?” Hermione asked casually. Harry wasn’t really sure how to reply to that. Of course, he would like to share every detail of last night with his friends but on the other hand, he did not feel like arguing over leaving the dorms at night. And maybe Draco’s dream was also a bit too private for him to just tell everyone about it.
“I do not believe so, professor, otherwise it would have illuminated Potter’s mind and he would have realized that this was his own fault!”
Harry watched him conspicuously inconspicuous. Malfoy does have quite nice body, Harry had to admit to himself. Not like. Uh. Like if one was into that kind of guy. Which Harry totally wasn't.
Harry was tired to his bones and too drunk to party anymore. He wanted to sleep, to rest. But he knew he couldn't do that in the dorms as some others took the partying to under the sheets.
“Fuck,” was the only thing Harry could think of.
Draco shot Harry a heated look while leering at him. “I will leave that to your imagination but it isn’t as demure as Madam Puddifoot’s Café.”
Hermione didn’t look at Ron any less reproachful. “Has it crossed your mind that perhaps
They pulled away from each other looking flushed and breathing heavily.
“You didn’t look very alone earlier,” Seamus stated then. Harry felt the blood in his veins freeze immediately. He shook it off. He could do whatever he wished to, by Merlin!
“That’s enough! Detention for both of you! And now get out of my class!” Slughorn ended the show.
“You don’t want to hear this but I’m walking you in case those two Hufflepuffs show up again.”
They started working focused. Harry lost interest quite quickly, although and packed out their dinner.
“Ron?” Harry asked nervously which got him to react.
“I think we’ll catch up later,” Harry answered.
Draco pensively rolled his wand between his fingers back and forth. Then he lifted his wand, pointed it at Harry and before he could react he heard Draco say “Somnium Lucidum”.
“Do you maybe want to tell us now what happened last night?” she whispered trying not to catch Seamus’ attention but Seamus would not be Seamus if he didn’t hear them still.
Ron paused. “Mione and I went on a walk with Malfoy?”
The insults had stopped but Draco was now furiously glaring at Harry instead of Ron, although he couldn’t completely hide his surprise at Harry’s arrival. Harry took a step closer to Draco, so close that the tip of Draco’s wand was lightly touching his throat. He heard distantly Ron saying something but he ignored it.
“Alright, that enough training?” Harry asked almost pleading. His head was hurting a bit. If that was from the dream excursion or the fall, he wasn’t quite sure. Draco nodded which Harry took as invitation to relax and put his feet up on the table. Draco observed him disapprovingly.
“Wouldn’t surprise me with Luna,” Harry considered out loud completely ignoring the fact that they all could see ghosts here. “But she’s right. You are nicer otherwise you wouldn’t have had this conversation with me today.”
“Why then?”
“No, I’m not dreaming about him! Well, I am. But not like usually. Not that I dream about him usually- What I mean is that I dream out of Malfoy’s perspective,” Harry managed to say not very gloriously. Draco’s hand was still at his forehead and he didn’t look like he was moving anytime soon.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t believe him. Something must’ve happened. Maybe his parents threatened to disinherit him or something. I can’t imagine why he would do this to himself out of his own free will.”
Harry slowly shook his head. “I know it’s none of my business,” Harry began staring directly at Draco.
“The problem is not his fucking name! My problem is that my best friend is acting like an utter idiot, lying to me and then even assuming I don’t notice these things!”
“Perhaps,” Harry admitted.
He was angry. Furious. What were his friends thinking to assume to know anything about what was going on with him? He had told them more than enough for them to know that a compromise with his parents was NEVER a compromise because the only one suffering would be him. Perhaps they should not have become criminals if they feared the Ministry this much.
Keeping the Map on his person, Harry quickly pulled on a sweater, a pair of shoes and hurried also to the seventh floor where the flight of winding stairs leads up to the viewing deck of the tower. He didn’t know why but he was somewhat worried. And that was definitely a new kind of emotion in relation to Draco. The dreams made Draco’s feelings seem so real and with that he felt and understood Draco’s feelings of powerlessness and despair. He still felt the Slytherin’s bitter wish for death in his veins. It was only logical that his empathy would spike
Harry sighed dramatically. „Too bad really, I would have loved to find out.”
Harry shook his head. An awkward silence fell over them. Draco looked at Harry again. Harry preferred looking nervously at a spot behind Draco’s head.
Harry groaned. “I know that. And I don’t want either that he-,”
Before Draco could reply with something arrogant, Harry joined the conversation. “Alright, I think that’s enough for now. See you later.” And with that he pushed Draco’s arm a little and they started making their way a bit further away from the group.
“A whole damned month?” Ron asked and just about managed to keep it to a whisper.
“I don’t expect you to accept this but I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to you.” Ron stumbled over his words and cleared his throat to procrastinate. “You know, for the threats n stuff,” Ron ended his less than masterful apology.
Then Harry paled. Oh Merlin. Did he and Malfoy...? No! No way was he that drunk! But... he was wearing only his pants. And Malfoy too.
Sleep didn't wait long to take over.
“I can show you how to get to the kitchen, then you can let the Elves make you a sandwich,” Harry offered.
“Harry, I don’t think you know what you’re saying here,” Hermione started slowly.
Ron crossed his arms in front of his chest, which Hermione observed concerned. “But do you have to talk to him between classes too? Or greet him in the mornings when you see each other even if it’s just a stupid grin? Or do you really have to call him by his first name? Is that all part of this ‘detention’ as well?”
“Well, I believe I’ve been dreaming about pieces of his memories,” Harry said. Now Slughorn looked over to Draco who was fidgeting in his seat.
“The night of Friday to Saturday,” Harry started slowly. “I woke up in the middle of the night from one of his dreams. He went to the astronomy tower. And I followed him.”
“Potter, you have to turn left here,” Draco remarked as Harry kept walking along with Draco.
“That’s not- I don’t like him, I’m just beginning to understand him!” Ron and Hermione exchanged a meaningful look. “Don’t look like that, at least I’m telling you now.” Harry had no idea how to get out of this.
Harry sighed but he accepted the sandwich. “Sounds like a solid plan.”
As if summoned, Slughorn appeared at their table. “Well that doesn’t look half ba-,” Slughorn who just dipped the ladle into the brew stopped suddenly as he noticed the brew changing colour.
Bloody hell, what was that? Could some medical potions just steal someone’s dreams? Probably. He was probably worrying over nothing and instead of giving Draco get well wishes, he acted completely paranoid. Everything was fine so there was no reason for Draco to act distant towards Harry. The Gryffindor caught himself glancing over at Draco every few moments until Seamus bumped his shoulder and told him he’d cut himself if he didn’t work more focused. So, Harry tried to calm down and accepted Draco’s statement as truth.
“So,” Harry started slowly. “Was that a memory?”
“Do you want to go to the tower?” Neville asked calmly.
“Have I been in them?” Ron asked suspiciously.
“Ah, mate…” Ron shook his head.
“Hm this could turn out to be a long night. Your friends are surely going to worry,” Draco said sympathetically still not sparing Harry a glance.
This time Harry paused for a bit longer. He nervously ran a hand though his hair. He had not the slightest clue how he got the idea to tell this following part which not even he was sure about why it happened. “I fell asleep, he was awake, so I was alone. I dreamed about him, everything was normal but then we sort of…,” Harry didn’t even dare to say it out loud and desperately looked up at Ron who was looking back surprisingly collected.
Neville nodded in understanding while Seamus and Dean exchanged meaningful looks. Harry ignored those dully. It was as if he had used up all of his emotions for the day already. Harry got up with the other three. His legs felt numb but Harry ignored it as he slowly walked to the entrance hall with Neville at his side. The students that had been gawking earlier had luckily returned to minding their own business.
“Forget about it, mate. Malfoy is just a bad omen, nothin' you can do about it,” Ron tried assuring Harry.
“I am telling you for the possibly 100th time: go to Slughorn, you idiot!” Hermione butted in. The Gryffindor has had enough of not being listened to. Harry sighed and glanced about. The other Gryffindors around them seemed to be all too invested in their own conversations to notice the trio. The perks of breakfast chatter.
Alright, that's it. Thank you to those who did read this and now I hope you enjoy this next chapter <3
Harry found it curious how Draco treated his friends. He seemed to have the perfect poker face which his friends just accepted and ignored. So, when Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance Blaise would just add even more excruciatingly boring details to the story rather than finish it. Maybe that was their way to tease Draco a little.
“Ah, Mr. Potter. You’re on time.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised. “That’s not it, Professor. I think, just… well you see- what do you think would be the consequences if one had happened to ingest some of that brew?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, then leaned a bit forward and started plucking grass out of Harry’s hair. “Oh, good. 8PM really is a bit early. That’s when the fun stuff just begins.” The blonde said a bit too casually.
Harry nearly threw the butterbeers onto the ground but stopped himself. “If you weren’t so sensitive regarding everything Draco, maybe I would have told you more!” Harry defended himself.
“Mate… I dunno. It could have just been another dumb dream. Maybe we talked about it too much and your subconscious reacted to it…” Ron said thoughtfully. Hermione sighed playing with her hair.
Harry spent his Sunday avoiding Ron by, for example, sitting demonstratively far away from his usual place at the Gryffindor table. Besides that, he forced himself to study and noticed that all of his friends were acting rather distant. Probably to avoid drama but it did make Harry feel a bit abandoned. Luna was the only one not interested in all that and accompanied him every now and then.
The conversation got abruptly cut off by McGonagall who separated the two without leaving room for arguments so they could focus on the topic at hand in class.
“Maybe it is somehow related to the potions… event yesterday,” mused Hermione out loud.
Harry looked at them. “Could someone here explain to me what the hell was going on?” Harry asked and sounded more threatening than he had intended.
“Alright, we’ll get going then,” Ron ended the conversation. Hermione helped him get the rest of the group to start moving again.
“My parents,” Draco tried but Harry didn’t believe him.
Slughorn deemed it a good idea to do a surprise test explaining that it was a good way to find out for themselves how well they were doing. Hermione was actually happy about it while Ron and Harry groaned in annoyance. The other students sat down and took out their quills. Harry who was sitting in the front row – not by choice, mind you – next to Ron, who just sat there to copy off of Hermione, suddenly felt a paper ball hit the back of his head. Surprised, he turned around and was greeted by Draco’s satisfied smirk.
Harry furrowed his brows. “He won’t attack you. I’ll speak to him. But maybe you should sleep first, we’ll talk tonight, alright?”
“You are right. It is none of your business,” Draco replied. He did not need to hear it from Potter too after getting lectured by his friends for the whole day.
“But I am not here because of the dream,” Draco gave it another try to get rid of Harry but that one just got more curious.
Harry smiled at Draco and then gave him a questioning look. Draco motioned over at Slughorn with a slender finger, making a talking gesture and tapped against a non-existent watch on his wrist. He cocked an eyebrow but Harry understood. Slughorn seemed to have news. Hermione who had watched the whole interaction gave Harry a confused look. He just shrugged.
Harry's eyes widened. "W- What? No! I wasn't-"
Harry quickly said a quiet prayer that he would fall over dead but since he was still alive, he slowly turned around to face Draco Malfoy. He stood there with crossed arms and with Blaise at his side. Both looked fairly amused.
“Look, Draco,” Harry began patiently. “I understand that it won’t be easy to explain. I don’t even want to guarantee that this will work and that we become best mates forever but I feel like I’m starting to like you and to not try it at least would be cowardly.”
“Uh, Malfoy,” Ron started finally while he sat up a bit awkwardly next to his girlfriend. Everyone’s eyes moved expectantly over to Ron while Draco tensed up.
“Hello?! Earth to Potter?” Draco ripped Harry out of his spiralling thoughts looking annoyed.
The rest of the students lingering about didn’t seem to care much for the both of them so Harry did sit down. Draco observed him unimpressed.
He actually did spot him but Draco didn’t look very happy. He had his head in his hand and was nervously tapping with the other on the table in front of him and looked just... Tired. His friends seemed to be trying to involve him in conversation but Draco was more focused on his lunch. He didn’t look back at Harry.
The two young wizards slept contently in the bed, neither of them aware of the other one...
The door to the boys’ dorms flew open and Seamus walked in. He strolled in easily with Neville in tow until he suddenly noticed Harry and Hermione.
If Harry wasn’t despairing trying to get his feelings under control, he probably would’ve laughed but right now he just about managed a half-hearted smile. “I think I have a lot of thinking to do,” Harry said dully.
But Draco just sighed. “I vote that we rather do some dream training.”
Fifteen minutes later Slughorn decided to leave them to probably go have dinner himself and warned them to keep on working diligently or else.
Harry fell back into his pillow. All that he knew was that Draco had kissed another man in his dream. In a not so sober state of mind. That meant nothing. Right? Well, it was hard not to notice Draco’s very obvious erection - pun not intended. Was that normal? Harry tried to clear his mind. He didn’t even know if that had actually happened. Although all of Draco’s dreams had been memories so far… what did he know? Harry played with the thought of seeking Draco out on the Marauders’ Map but quickly decided against it feeling dumb and closed his eyes to go back to sleep.
“Deal?” Harry held out his hand to Draco, who eyed it dismissively for a bit, but gave in and shook it. Harry’s skin tingled slightly, it felt different than in the dream, not less good, just different. “Mad,” Harry mumbled not letting go of Draco’s hand.
“Do you maybe want to come in?”
Theo, who just sat down too, cleared his throat awkwardly and gave the students near-by a look signalising them to go back to minding their own business.
“Then fuck you.” Harry didn’t mean to say it but now it was too late. He turned around and angrily walked away. He heard a “Fuck yourself or better, go fuck Malfoy” from Ron and then a quieter Hermione saying something to probably calm Ron down. Harry ignored it walking back the way he came with Draco and instantly sank down onto the ground against a wall.
“So that means it will be back by next year? And of course, this happens during our last year.” Draco almost made a snide remark over Goyle’s non-existent sincerity.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.” Harry managed to say and leaned back in his armchair looking out of it.
“Do not dare to put this on me now! Just because you do not give a fuck about your academic performance, does not mean everyone else is like that!” hissed Draco pulling out his wand. Harry followed suit.
Harry couldn’t help but keep his eyes on his hands. He fought the urge to hide behind a pillow. It was out now. He would’ve died if he had kept that in any longer. He didn’t even want to linger on the meaning of the dream, he just wanted to say it out loud so the pressure on his chest would loosen up. But it didn’t lessen, and Ron was already quiet for a dangerously long time. Harry finally dared to look up. Ron looked a little pale around his nose but other than that he didn’t seem angry at least.
“I won’t kill him or anything,” Draco shot back drily. Just loud enough so Seamus would hear it.
Draco’s look got a bit softer. “Fine but you will do exactly as I say. If you start complaining, you can do it alone.”
“Do you… well, do you feel me too?” Harry asked. The question was a bit uncomfortable for him as he did not know which emotions Draco felt from him.
The rest of the day went on forever, Hermione spent most of it scolding them for their messed-up Potions tests. Malfoy didn’t show up at lunch but it gave Harry a chance to do some small talk with Ginny which was nice. Seamus asked Harry later on that day if he was still “dreaming about Draco” which Harry answered with a small stinging hex Seamus’ way. Ron offered bringing him some food for dinner because apparently, he was not eating enough. Harry declined thankfully and got the sandwiches from the elves again instead. The elves insisted he take two muffins with him as well. After a bit of arguing Harry gave in and headed to the potion’s classroom with the food in his bag. Draco was even already there this time so Harry sat down next to him at his table without asking. Slughorn gave them the assignment and went about his evening after a few minutes as usual.
“I can’t! Because I was in your damn head and it wasn’t funny.”
Draco cocked a perfectly shaped eyebrow. “Do not test my patience or I might have to tell your beloved Weasel that you snogged him in your dream.”
The day passed very slowly and stretched out like gum. Without Ron and Hermione Harry got almost bored but he tried to remind himself that he didn’t listen to most of their conversations anyway.
“Is he not coming over?” Luna asked watching Draco slowing down the closer he got seemingly having noticed the attention being on him now.
Harry stood, as did the other two wizards, grabbed his bag and followed Draco back to class. Their classmates were giving them curious looks until Slughorn demanded their attention and started instructing them on something. Harry glanced at Draco to gauge his reaction and instantly regretted it. If Draco’s usual demeanour was perceived as unfriendly, seeing this look would send them screaming. Harry hurriedly moved away before the Slytherin’s anger could reach him and scurried to Ron and Hermione, who send him questioning looks. Harry shook his head and mouthed “later”. He watched how Draco stomped over to Blaise Zabini’s table and sat down. He spent the rest of the class looking bitter while ignoring those that were lucky and trying to stab the rest to death with his venomous glares.
A quiet sound of movement drew his attention and Harry looked up. It was Draco, who lowered himself rather gracelessly next to him. Harry didn’t say anything and looked straight ahead. He already regretted half of the things he said to Ron, even though he was still angry that Ron had so quickly decided to stand against him. Draco stayed quiet as well but he felt Draco’s warmth against his side which was calming in itself.
Harry groaned in frustration. Naturally, Draco would use this to question everything again.
Harry frowned. “I’m not making them spend time with you. The rest is going to work out in time.” Even for Harry that was a pretty idealistic view of the world, he knew that, but he couldn’t think of anything else.
Hermione sighed now as well. “And how do you know that? You have to share dreams at least for a couple more days for sure so it would be smarter to leave this be and keep your conversations as shallow as possible.” Harry knew that Hermione was right but it was too late now.
A few hours later Harry was finally finished with the last of his assignments and put the last scroll in his bag. Hermione walked off along the shelves of the library searching for some book again. Ron was sitting on the floor between a bunch of books and scrolls, scratching his forehead despairingly with the end of his quill. Harry grinned amusedly pushing his books away to stretch out contently.
Harry smiled nervously until a shocking idea came to his mind: What if Draco had also dreamed those dreams? What if he knew? Or even worse, what if he knew about Harry’s dreams?
“Thank you,” the Slytherin replied a few seconds later and he turned back to his assignment. Harry himself stared at his own sandwich and wondered why he was such an idiot.
And that was it. No apologies or long speeches. Hermione looked almost disappointed but was also just glad that there was peace among the Trio again. And then his best friends sat on his bed and they just talked. Harry told them about the missing dreams and Draco’s change of demeanour. His friends stayed quiet which Harry actually preferred to a judging comment. Then they let Harry be and went to their last class of the week. Harry was happy on one hand that he and Ron were on good terms again, even if there wasn’t a very insightful conversation, but on the other hand, he was still feeling down about Draco.
Harry nodded and when he looked up he noticed the other students eyeing him. He was certain that everyone had heard about Harry throwing a fit. Harry’s gaze wandered to Ron who looked back nervously. Harry could guess that his best friend wasn’t looking forward to getting attacked again. But instead of getting angry, Harry walked towards Ron calmly, which lead to Dean and Seamus getting up and scurrying off. Harry sat down slowly across from Ron and focused on not letting the disappointment take over.
Draco looked down. “So, Draco, huh?” Harry furrowed his brows. He had indeed called Malfoy Draco just now.
Again, Harry cleared his throat abashedly. “It’s about what happened on Tuesday, Professor Slughorn,” Harry began slowly.
“Everything alright with you two or do we need to mediate?” Seamus called out to them. Harry’s group of friends were heading back and were just passing them. They were standing a few metres away and had been watching the whole ordeal.
“You think so?” Harry asked surprised.
“Okay, so, you know that we get along well.”
Thank you so much for reading! And thank you to everyone who leaves encouraging comments down below, it means the world to me and motivates me like nothing else :)
“And what did you do?” Ron probed as he smeared honey onto his buttered toast.
“The fuck,” Blaise hissed at Draco and ran his hand through his hair getting out some scrambled eggs.
Harry shook his head in protest. “He’s really not as bad as he used to be, maybe it’s not wrong to be a fan of change.”
“What?” Harry hissed rubbing the back of his head. Blaise who was sitting next to Draco very obviously listened in on them but pretended not to by busying himself with his bag.
Harry nodded.
“You could’ve hold onto me, you know?” Harry suggested while he put his chair upright again and sat down in it.
The next morning started off very normal for a Sunday and Harry was actually right. Neville convinced his friends to make up for the planned picnic today. The weather was merciful and the sun warmed the cool wintery wind with its’ last bit of energy. Along with the usual Gryffindor group, Ginny and Luna joined them as well.
“Potter, are you actually pitying me?” Draco asked suddenly. Harry looked up in surprise. Draco’s expression told him that he didn’t like that idea but also, that he couldn’t think of any other explanation for Harry’s behaviour.
“Don’t be silly, Ronald. Harry, just show him that he has nothing to be ashamed of. Malfoy has a lot to feel shame about but not for kissing a boy, understood?” Hermione left no room for discussion so Harry simply nodded.
“I wish I could say that this surprises me.”
“Fine with me.”
Harry eyed Seamus but he seemed like he really was just joking so Harry smiled slightly. “Will do,” he mumbled.
“Yep, absolutely sure,” Harry said but this time with a reassuring smile on his lips. Neville didn’t seem to plan on moving and just kept giving Harry that doubtful look.
Harry went silent again. But he could not think of any plausible reason for Draco to keep this whole thing a secret considering he loved to complain about everything. Suddenly he remembered something.
Ron eyed him still nervously. “Harry, I-,” Ron started but Harry held up a hand stopping him mid-sentence.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “You’ll have a lot of work to catch up on.”
“I jus’ asked if it was lonely without a lion on a leash.”
Harry rolled his eyes annoyed and exchanged a meaningful look with Ron, working at the table next to them, who shook his head in sympathy. Draco noticing the exchange cleared his throat impatiently drawing Harry’s attention back to the task at hand and was surprised to see that Harry even got the ingredient ready then.
Harry shut his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall behind him. He tried to rationalize things and calm down. This wasn’t the end of the world. Ron said some things, he said some others. Now they knew and could maybe talk about it all later in a proper way. Harry wished he knew why he even let himself get pulled into that fight. The right to a friendship with just someone couldn’t be it. Was it Draco? Maybe. He really did like him, even if it was difficult to admit to his friends.
Draco looked up and met Harry’s eyes. “What if Granger or Weasley don’t agree?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, uncertain if he wanted to know the answer.
After they were free from Voldemort, they had to bury their loved ones who they had lost during the war. Then they partied - well, if you can call it partying that is. Most of them got drunk in attempt to forget the grief or, the other few ones, to celebrate their victory. It was too loud, sad and filled with hysterical laughter.
He heard a gasp, a crash and suddenly a burning hot liquid hit his face making him stumble. Distantly he could hear Slughorn’s voice taking off points of both of their houses and reprimanding them for their behaviour.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was not going to jump…?” Draco finally said slowly. Harry actually felt like Draco was being sincere which is why he let out a breath of relief.
“I’m at least catching you up in all the other classes. But don’t you dare not keep up next week with your studies or I will have to beat it into your brain again,” Draco said and Harry sighed.
“How likely is it that he’ll kill you?” Ron asked glancing at the Slytherin-table where Draco was spending his time glaring at Harry.
“You fight dirty, Malfoy!” Harry let the Slytherin know while trying to catch his breath.
Draco stayed quiet for a moment. “Yes, they have to.” Oh, thank you. That answer was absolutely no help at all. “They won’t eat you alive,” Draco added as he noticed Harry hesitating. “You just have to be prepared to lose against a few Slytherins.”
Angst, Drama and more! Enjoy!
A warm feeling of anticipation spread out in Harry as he headed towards the dorms. The Gryffindors had spent the rest of the evening with magical chess matches. It got quite late but it was a lot of fun. Seamus even joked about Harry going to meet Malfoy now but Harry chose to simply ignore him. He really was looking forward to it and couldn’t wait to fall asleep.
Then he looked up. Every single student and teacher that were still in the Great Hall this late stared at him dumbfounded. This included Potter and his friends that were openly gaping at him. Draco fought with everything in him not to blush and sat back down as elegantly as possible. He knew that this was the lesser of two evil. To get yelled at by his parents in front of the whole school would probably have killed him of embarrassment.
Harry eyed Draco thoughtfully. “Step for step, it would. We’re just becoming friends. It’s not as if another war will break out. Technically speaking this is should only concern us anyway.” Harry wasn’t even sure why he was getting this heated about the flourishing friendship. He didn’t know where this would go and he was just getting to know Draco.
unsorted on every possible surface, minus the desk, which was in the middle of the room. Draco and Harry sat down across from Slughorn and looked at him expectantly.
“I thought that if he took that strange potion, he wouldn’t be able to manipulate you anymore!”
“You’ve been spending an awful lot of time with that ferret lately,” he stated.
Silence fell over them. Harry played impatiently with his quill but didn’t want to keep writing purely out of pettiness. Draco went back to his previous position bracing his head in his hands. A couple minutes passed.
As the door shut closed, Harry snapped out of his stupor. A grin slowly appeared on his face. He kissed Malfoy. And it was not awful! Actually it was pretty amazing. Harry sighed happily letting himself fall back into the bed that still smelled of Malfoy.
(Narrator)
The rest of the afternoon and evening was spent going over all the material Harry had missed and worked a bit more on certain topics when needed. Since it got dark quite early, a Lumos spell gave them a better source of light. Draco only allowed them to head back once they were finished with all the work. It had gotten cold. The wind whipped around them and made it easier for Harry to convince Draco to go back to the castle. No sooner had they put the books away, they already started walking back leisurely.
Draco stared at Harry doubtfully. Then he eyed the sandwich. “You did not put poison in it now, did you?” he muttered half-heartedly.
“If this is some weird trick to get me to-,” Draco started drily.
“Then you are dismissed. We will push back detention to after dinner considering the circumstances.” And with that Slughorn ended their meeting.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, as sorry as I feel, that’s something you will have to solve on your own.”
“You were gone for an eternity, I didn’t know you would just suddenly fall over,” Draco explained himself, still amused.
Draco smiled back amused. “Everyone has their baggage to carry. Yours is Weasel’s family. I can live with that.”
“Why are you all even here? I thought you were going to the Three Broomsticks?” Harry tried changing the topic.
“So, you’re dreaming about Mr. Malfoy and deduce from that that you’ve ingested a failed potion?” Slughorn asked slowly.
“He just looked over,” Ron commented confused.
Draco looked down at his hands before he replied. “Well, you did dream of some of them.”
“What in the-,” started Draco taken aback but Slughorn interrupted him.
He raised an eyebrow. “Ron will be here soon and I believe he’ll kill you if you talk to Harry right now.”
Harry looked at his ex doubtfully. “Is that good?” he asked slowly.
Dean noticed Draco apparently at the same time since he immediately turned to Harry. “Harry, your favourite Malfoy is walking towards us.”
Seamus just about managed to hide his burst of laughter and Ginny just rubbed her forehead shaking her head.
“Could you explain to me why you and Ron are fighting again?” a familiar voice said next to him.
Harry’s breathing stopped for a moment.
Harry shook his head. “You’re having too much fun with this. I also don’t want you to see that. Especially because you’re confusing me with your emotions.”
Everything around him went blurry. He was overwhelmed by all the emotions and stumbled finally back. He heard how Neville told his friends to lead Harry outside. Without much struggle Harry let himself be dragged out. He noticed through his blurry vision some other students who had witnessed the whole spectacle and were still staring at him in shock. Harry was sure that he must look like insane but he couldn’t be bothered. He was just so damned angry and disappointed in Ron. That his best friend would betray him like this wasn’t something Harry had ever imagined. He felt himself be put down on a patch of grass and pushed into a sitting position.
Harry shook his head again. “I felt what you felt, I’m not leaving you alone right now.”
Draco chortled. “Besides that Gryffindor won, you do not just dream about Quidditch. It is quite interesting to know that you and the Weasley are not an item anymore but I really did not need to know that you have this weird threesome thing with the Weasel in your head.” Harry gaped. “That wasn’t a damn memory. I only ever feel your damn feelings of disgust and my brain was just trying to make sense of it. Ron is like a brother that’s-,” Harry stopped and shuddered.
Draco nodded satisfied and finished his work by thoroughly tousling Harry’s hair once. “That’s what I thought.”
Harry glanced to the teacher’s table where Slughorn was having an animated conversation with Professor Sprout who was smiling at him too brightly.
“I asked a person who had spoken to Malfoy in the dream and they did confirm that the conversation had happened,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
Harry furrowed his brows.
“Is everything other than this alright, Mr. Potter?” The headmistress asked shortly.
Secondly, I'm quite aware of the things JKR has said and I actually had her blocked for quite a while now. I think it's important to know who the author is to a series that is beloved to many and it is important to know how her views have affected her work. It surely did affect my relationship to the original material and I do love it less than I used to, partly because of her and I welcome that. I will still write fanfictions for HP and do HP cosplays but I will not support her financially in any way. I'm also ready to move on to better literary works with authors that share my views on human rights and include better representation IN their works instead of twitter.
Draco shook his head. “She must be seeing ghosts.”
He opened the door and made his way inside with some difficulty. He was in a cozy room with a large king-sized bed in the middle of it. It had black satin covers - fancy - and looked just so inviting with the many fluffy pillows. Harry quickly - and clumsily - got out of his clothes until he was only dressed in his pants and climbed into the large, comfortable bed.
In Slughorn’s office they were met with McGonagall who had her hands folded in front of her and was standing next to Slughorn who was sitting at a table eyeing the arriving wizards impatiently. Draco and Harry quickly sat down in front of them and watched their professors expectantly.
“That’s what I just told you!” Harry replied still a bit frantic.
“A rubbish idea! Do you know how dangerous that could be? And do you really believe that dreams would hold up in the ministry as evidence? Ron, that is madness!” Hermione yelled. She then turned back to Harry, probably to sternly remind him again of Slughorn’s existence, but paused instead staring at a spot behind Harry. “Malfoy is watching you.”
Draco met Harry’s look challengingly, grabbed his own handful of grass and threw it towards Harry. Before Harry had time to get worked up about it, a passionate war of grass-throwing erupted between the two wizards. Harry could sense his victory coming when Draco grabbed his wand for help and Harry nearly fell backwards at the force of green stuff landing on him. Before Draco could claim victory, Harry threw himself onto the Slytherin with a war cry.
“Why the long face?” Harry asked teasingly.
“Maybe we should head back,” Harry tried saving the situation. He would really like to end his night-time conversation without any fighting. Especially because he noticed how much Draco had let himself relax. Draco nodded slowly but didn’t allow himself another smile.
“Are you certain that you are able to not be curious for a minute?” Draco asked, still drily, but Harry saw a slow smirk build on Draco’s lips.
“Hey!” Harry interrupted. “What the hell am I supposed to do now?” His friends gave him matching looks of sympathy.
Theodore slowly moved towards Harry. “I think he doesn’t want to see you right now.”
Harry looked after Draco’s hand a bit disappointed.
Harry witnessed with a bleeding heart how Draco finished breakfast with his friends and then got up to head to wherever. Hermione tried her best to make Harry feel better but she failed as miserably as Ron.
Harry wanted to grab the blonde and shake him but the pain in his chest kept him still.
“Mr. Potter just explained to me that he had ingested some of the potion on Tuesday,” Slughorn replied while Harry would’ve loved for the ground to open up and just swallow him.
Harry cuddled a little closer to his warm, huggable pillow. So warm and comfy.
are the reason for that and not Malfoy?” Ron’s eyes widened at his girlfriend’s accusation.
“Because we’re missing dinner,” Harry explained slowly.
Hermione sighed, nodded and stood up. Harry wanted to protest. Ron could be as angry as he wanted to be. Hermione was his friend too but he knew it would be smarter to wait out Ron’s anger. After that they could talk to him again.
“That is mad!” Ron replied after Harry had recounted the story of his dream at the breakfast table. Hermione furrowed her brows in concern and seemed to be thinking intensively about the meaning of all of this.
This finally got through to Neville, he nodded quickly and hurried back to their friends. Harry shot Draco a reprehensive look. “You don’t have to be mean.”
“Done.”
Ron smiled reassuringly. “Not too much though! When you see him next time and want to kiss him, you’ll know.”
The Slytherin eyed Harry intensely, then he sighed. “I don’t know, Harry. He said a few things… Maybe they aren’t that wrong.”
Harry scoffed. “That isn’t even romantic.”
“Would that be possible?” he asked tentatively.
Harry almost let his quill fall out of anger and turned towards his taken aback friend. “I’m trying my best here to get along with him. I’m just glad he is also trying. So how about you stay out of this?”
Ginny groaned annoyed. “Does it have to do with Malfoy?” she asked impatiently.
“Harry, I think you should stop by the medical wing. This is getting creepy,” Draco suggested as he tried to pull his hand back. But Harry’s grip only tightened at the mention of his first name. Draco, who just seemed to have noticed as well, looked panicked into Harry’s eyes for a moment, then pulled his hand back and stood up.
“All right. I will speak to Professor McGonagall today and we will work on finding a solution for this. Mr. Malfoy, we will have to notice your parents about this. Mr. Potter, do you want me inform anyone for you?” Slughorn asked woodenly. Harry watched how Draco slumped even more in chair if that was even possible.
Harry grinned satisfied. Studying with Malfoy was something he couldn’t have imagined in his wildest dreams.
“Should he not wait with that? I mean this is a stellar opportunity to get some dirt on that ferret.” Hermione glared at Ron for that comment.
Harry stared intensely into the entrance where none other than Pansy Parkinson followed by Theodore Nott appeared and made their way out of the Slytherin common room. As soon as they noticed Harry they stopped as if they had been struck with a Petrificus Totalus. Before they could turn away again, Harry mustered up some courage.
Draco noticed the look and cocked his eyebrow leaning back and crossing his arms. “What?” Harry shrugged. “Nothing. I would have just assumed you would want to hurry up so you could go have dinner after.”
“What are you doing this weekend?” Harry asked casually. Draco accepted the change of topic without comment.
“Ginny,” Harry stated unnecessarily. The Gryffindor who had just sat down next him kept looking at him curiously. “Why don’t you ask him?” Harry asked drily and pushed away his barely touched food. Ginny frowned.
“Are you certain that he is nice when you two are alone?” she asked again to make sure. Harry nodded and let the rest of the conversation fade out. His headache got actually better after he downed about a litre of tea. Then he and his friends made their way to Potions class. Harry felt less inclined to go to class considering he almost spent each evening there copying useless book pages but he still dragged himself there.
Draco opened his eyes and gave Harry a questioning look.
Harry leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “But why does it then? You can’t just claim something doesn’t work when it does work just fine!”
Theo’s expression barely shifted but it showed that he was thinking. Then he turned towards Pansy. “Let him know.” Pansy opened her mouth to protest but Theo cut her off. “Just do it by Merlin!” Pansy stared at Theo annoyed for a bit but did turn around. As soon as she was gone so was the opening.
“I just meant you look tired,” Harry said quickly.
Satisfied, he handed in his exam and left the room. Ron shot him an envious look as he left. To his surprise Draco was standing outside leaning against the wall. Harry hesitated at first, but then walked over to the Slytherin.
“Or did you want someone else to tell you what you feel because you’re too stubborn to see it yourself?” Ron asked infinitely calm that it almost made Harry angry.
“This fight is stupid and would like to bury the hatchet,” Ron stumbled over his words while he held the sandwich out to Harry. Harry noticed Hermione looking proudly at Ron out of his peripheral.
“You really think I wouldn’t do it?” Draco asked quietly, still furious. Harry couldn’t help but eye the Slytherin for a few seconds. He didn’t only look completely drained but also like he was holding on to his last nerve. The consequences of the Dreamless Sleep potion were obviously taking a toll on him.
Hermione nodded and changed the subject.
“I never planned on doing that if that helps,” Harry said quietly.
“I hope you are aware that this has to end with an apology from your side.”
“Why would he do that?” Harry asked confused.
Draco’s poker face started crumbling dangerously as he held his head in his hands. “But your friends, my friends and my family… It would never work.”
“By Merlin, what were you thinking?!”
“You said you’d rather die than come back here. It didn’t really sound like a joke and then I woke up. I usually never wake before morning,” Harry tried to explain himself while he walked over to the Slytherin. Draco fought the desire to move away and kept eyeing him. Harry was certain that even a blind person could notice his serious concern but for Draco this all seemed to be rather strange than comforting.
Harry sighed annoyed. “He accused me of purposely sabotaging his work. I just defended myself!”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, thank you for your patience,” Slughorn interrupted Harry and came up next to Draco. “After talking to your parents, Mr. Malfoy, we’ve decided not to involve the Ministry and to work this out with the options available to us. We have managed to find a cure but it has a preparation time of a month as we need to grow some specific ingredients. Professor Sprout is already on it. And again, I’ll remind you that you are allowed to take the Dreamless Sleep potion whenever you want to.” Harry had an inclination that that last statement was meant for Draco. “That would be all. Get to your classes now.” With that the potions professor disappeared again.
“Well, it was a dream. Surely it isn’t that strange, right?” Harry asked uncertainly.
It looked just as dirty and poorly lit inside as he remembered seeing it every year before this. Harry greeted Aberforth in a friendly manner, even entertained a little small talk but quickly ended the conversation before the topic of school grades could come up. Aberforth handed him the two ordered butterbeers in the usual dusty bottles and wished Harry a nice weekend. Harry thanked him and left the Inn with the bottles in hand.
Harry shook his head like he was paralyzed. This couldn’t be true. This
Harry shook his head. “I have to talk to Draco.”
“How long are you meaning to wait until you continue the assignment?” Draco broke the silence not looking up.
“I was me. But in Draco’s body. And I could see me through his eyes,” Harry explained patiently.
I had planned on updating this before I went on a little vacation but life happened so yeah. But I hope you enjoy this chapter and the next one should be done soon too ^-^
“Very well, even. I know it’s difficult to comprehend but he has really changed. Or well, he’s doing his best to right his wrongs. To make better decisions, things like that. It was quite enlightening to be in his head, you know. There he couldn’t hide himself and his feelings.” Harry hesitated for a moment, but Ron was just watching him expectantly. “He was afraid. The same fear we also had. Only difference was that he stood on the other side of the field. This feeling, feeling so alone and being helpless to change it… It was so real. It was basically impossible to not understand his actions.”
“I found a book about lucid dreaming. I knew I’ve read about it somewhere before. I can show you later. Just don’t let Potter know or else he will try to do the same to your dreams.”
Harry was probably just making a bigger deal out of this than it really was and his actual problem was the damned homework that threatened to suffocate him. Hermione didn’t see any reason to help Harry with it and preferred to study alone in the library during lunchtime. Therefore, Ron and Harry got together and disappeared to a quiet corner in the Gryffindor common room - if that was even possible - to fight themselves through a couple books.
Harry quickly turned to Draco who was giving him an apologetic look. “See you tomorrow.”
Both wizards got ready to brew the potion back to being focused again. Draco counted every second and every stir just so he could get the timing perfectly right. He wasn’t going to put his Outstanding at risk by messing up such a simple potion.
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, I must ask you to postpone your conversation. Or are two weeks of detention not enough yet?” Slughorn interrupted them. Harry quickly turned around but noticed all the curious glances he got especially those from his friends. Ron threw him a questioning look but Harry decided to leave it unanswered for now.
Harry looked up and went still. “You are the only one without a partner so do not give me that look,” hissed Draco letting his bag fall next to him and eyed Harry warily. Harry shot a pleading look to his right where his best friends were discussing some ingredients. They didn’t notice the distress exuding of their friend from their left.
Ok, so, what is my excuse this time for leaving everyone - especially Sam - hanging? Well, I got covid ^^" It was bad lol. But I got better! Which meant lots of uni stuff to catch up on and exams to write. I still got 2 papers left but I'm slowly getting everything in order. I am incredibly sorry for making you all wait and I hope to upload the next few chapters soon. Thank you so much for you guys' understanding and support <3 Enjoy!
And? Did you like their not-date date? xP Let me know what you think in the comments! <3
Hermione sighed. “Maybe we should let the topic be. You will survive detention just fine and, in the future, you just won’t work with Malfoy again.”
“I have to study.” Harry nearly laughed. If one of them didn’t need to study, that would be Draco. “I heard that you’re going to Hogsmeade.” Harry looked at Draco surprised, who answered with a shrug. “I think you Gryffindors aren’t quite aware of your volume when speaking.” Harry laughed. His friends didn’t in fact argue quietly.
“You’re going to start drooling soon,” Ron hissed to bring him back to reality. Harry looked away from Draco confused. “Guess you have your answer then,” Ron said quietly but that answer only left Harry confused and just got him wondering, while stirring his soup again, why he was so dim-witted.
On the night from Sunday to Monday Draco showed Harry an old vacation spot he pulled from his memories and they went on a walk, talking, along a blurry image of a beautiful beach. Everything seemed like it would be okay. Ron couldn’t stay angry forever.
Draco laughed. “Slowly, I understand Granger scolding you all the time. Merlin, you’re insufferable. Go now!” With those words Draco pushed Harry’s arms away from under him so that Harry’s head nearly slammed into the table. Harry just made a disgruntled sound and got up to make his way to Transfiguration.
“This question might sound strange but could it be that I can feel your emotions when I’m dreaming?” Draco glanced at Harry but before he could reply they turned a corner and noticed a couple of Ravenclaws walking towards them. They eyed them thoroughly before instantly starting to whisper to each other. Harry frowned.
Harry shot up in his bed. He looked around nervously and tried to sort through his thoughts. He was in the Gryffindor dorms. In the bed next to him was Ron snoring softly. The sun just went up bathing the room in warm, red tones. Harry confusedly rubbed his forehead. He had dreamed of playing Quidditch. That wasn’t really unusual. The dream before that was strange. He was stuck in Draco’s body and had dreamed of Voldemort. However, it was quickly clear to him that he was dreaming. He couldn’t control it but he was just as lucid as he was now. Very different from the Quidditch one. That that one was a dream was only clear to him at the end of it.
“They’ll survive. Regardless, they know I’m only here because of you.”
Ginny seemed to think for a bit. “Maybe you could try to explain it. And then I’ll tell you if it’s understandable or not.”
“Potter, take your hand off there.”
“I want to be honest with you,” he started calmly. “I already marked both of your tests and I’m convinced that you would profit immensely if you studied together.” Harry stared at his professor taken aback.
“And you’re certain that this is not dangerous for you?” Hermione asked, thoughtfully munching on a spoonful of cornflakes.
“I was about to-,” Harry began, praying internally, that they would simply let him leave.
“Ronald!” Harry heard Hermione yell sounding upset.
Draco’s expression didn’t change but he slowly put down his quill. “I threw burning hot brew in your face but you are apologizing?” Draco asked as if this situation was very hard to grasp.
“Well, you don’t have to decide now. You can go to the medical wing if you decide to take the draught,” McGonagall assured relaxing the tense atmosphere.
“So, Slughorn has got news?” Harry asked slowly.
“Well, it is completely irrelevant now that we don’t have a team this year anyway!” hissed Theo before Draco could reply. Pansy looked miffed but didn’t comment any further.
“And how do we stop this?” Draco asked immediately.
“Difficult to say,” Harry thought out loud.
Draco shot him an evil look. “Not like you asked me.” Harry looked down at his hands and wondered whether he should be ashamed of his dreams or if it was all the same to Draco.
“Mate, what is going on with you?! You barely tell us about his dreams anymore and now you suddenly want to talk to him all the time,” Ron let out crossing his arms and looking doubtful.
Draco’s “no” came with no hesitation. Then he shot Harry a look that was almost seeking for help who just watched the whole interaction amused.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. He could be just as stubborn as Ron. “No, damn it! The only thing that is a joke here is your reaction to me calling him by his damned first name!” Harry saw out of his peripheral how Hermione tried to step in but without success as Ron moved furiously closer to Harry.
The others stayed quiet. Seamus and Dean were suddenly very interested in their shoes but Ron didn’t look like he had calmed down yet.
Ron shot Seamus an evil look at that. “I’m never tellin’ you anythin’ again.” Which just earned him a mock-innocent look from Seamus.
“Holy shit!” Harry shot up in his bed and looked around confusedly. It was the middle of the night. Draco must have woken up and therefore kicked Harry out of his dream. Harry rubbed his eyes still out of it. What did he just witness? Blaise and Draco? Draco and another bloke? He wasn’t sure which surprised him more. And the worst part was he could feel his own erection demanding his attention.
The ones that had somebody left, clung to them because they were there. They hadn't lost them. At least not them.
“I’m just taking a small break, I’m practically on my way back,” Harry explained quickly. His friends eyed him curiously and a little confused.
Harry got saved from answering by Neville who was hurrying over from the professors’ table to ask him to the Potions classroom in Slughorn’s place. Harry made his way out without hesitation and watched Draco do the same following him. Just as he left the Great Hall he stopped and waited for Draco. He didn’t feel like getting hexed from behind just because Draco was having a bad day. The Slytherin almost missed Harry but stopped looking surprised as he did notice him.
“I think we shouldn’t overwhelm him,” Hermione said rationally.
“I don’t know exactly what he said to you,” Harry tried again. “But no matter what it was, I don’t want you to keep taking that potion. And I want to be able to talk to you. I want us to be friends again.” Harry nervously bit his lip doubting if that was enough to change Draco’s mind.
“Slughorn wants to talk.”
“We’ll just quickly go by the Hog’s Head, grab a butterbeer and come back right away,” Harry suggested. Draco’s expression stayed unreadable so Harry kept talking. “Just to get a little fresh air. After that we can study until midnight for all I care.”
Harry chuckled nervously kneading his hands before nodding slowly. “I am afraid so, yes, Sir.”
“It’ll be okay,” Ginny encouraged him, got up and pressed a kiss onto the top of his head. Harry was surprised at the loving gesture but not in a bad way. Ginny then disappeared again but got followed by evil looks from Ron. Harry glanced again to Draco who was now full-on staring at him. Harry thought he saw a question in Draco’s look and considered gesticulating an explanation but Draco turned away again to his friends.
“Well I don’t know,” Harry admitted honestly but tried to smile to make it look like a joke.
Harry noticed that Draco hadn’t said anything for a while now which made him nervous. Hopefully, the Slytherin didn’t interpret something more into the simple gesture. Harry considered letting go again when Draco finally spoke up.
Harry furrowed his brows. “What is so horrible about it? I mean, everything’s going fine now.”
“You want to cancel on your friends to study with me?” Draco asked again doubtfully.
Oh, how he hated it when they spoke simultaneously.
“You are just a typical Gryffindor and try to get me to yell at someone or to step into random dark rooms. Merlin, how is it even possible to be that curious?” Draco shouted smiling a little. Harry smiled back until he suddenly noticed how Draco’s grin vanished. Harry awkwardly looked down at his feet. This friendly banter was a bit strange.
Draco nearly gaped. “Fuck you! You have no damn idea,” Draco got up with that and left the Great Hall head held high.
Harry threw her a doubtful look but decided then to tell her the truth. He just needed somebody to talk to.
“But only because Ron owes it to me as well,” hissed Harry in Dean’s direction who exchanged satisfied looks with Seamus.
Harry nodded and the anticipation made itself known again. “And you?”
“I’m always on your side, Draco, but ignoring your parents is only going to worsen things,” Pansy decided to add too which was the last straw for Draco.
The tiredness made his movements slower so he ended up needing two hours for the assignment. Slughorn arrived just before that und looked like he had already forgotten about them. Almost at the same time both students handed in their scrolls and made their way to their separate dorms. Harry watched Draco disappear around the corner. Having to do this whole process for two weeks again and again was going to be tedious.
“Anything else?”
Draco’s grip on the railing tightened so much you could see his knuckles turn white. “That does not matter to father. I turned you into a major witness right now and he cannot do anything to stop it. The worst part is, I do not know if it is worse to have you in my head without anyone knowing or to be hated by my father for it.” Harry bit his lip pensively. He wished he was better with words so he could comfort Draco. Indecisively, he looked again at Draco’s hand. Draco noticed the look and put his hand in his pocket reactively. Harry was a bit annoyed at himself.
Harry grinned satisfied and got up to go look for his other best friend. Hermione was, as expected, in the library where she tried to calm down by studying. Harry talked to her for a whole hour but the Gryffindor was only convinced to speak to Ron again after Harry told her that Ron would apologize to Draco in return. And then she forced Harry to study too and didn’t let him go until evening.
Harry nodded.
Harry frustratedly whined inside while he kept staring at Draco’s profile. “We’re only fighting because you’re avoiding me and taking that stupid potion without telling me anything about it. And besides that, fighting is also a part of it!”
At that Harry’s pride made itself known which is why he immediately protested. “Alright, I’m in but I actually have no idea how to lose.” Harry said confidently. It couldn’t be that hard.
Draco smirked. “Since when do you care for school, Potter?” Harry couldn’t even really get defensive since Draco was right. Recently, he just had other things occupying his mind.
“It won’t be as bad as you think,” was the only reply he could offer.
Draco opened his mouth to reply as a voice spoke up down the hall.
Silently he followed both of the Slytherins out of the library and realized quickly that they were heading to the dungeons. He listened in to the conversation between the two wizards while they were walking. Blaise was going on about some Charms essay he had to write and seemingly ignored the fact that Draco was paying him no mind.
“I have to point out that we cannot exclude the possibility of the brew having dangerous side effects. After you said to me that you hadn’t taken in any of the potion on Tuesday, I had it thrown away. But it shouldn’t be impossible to recreate it. Only then I can tell you for sure what effects and side effects the potion has and of course, if a cure will be necessary,” Slughorn explained calmly and decidedly.
“It’ll be alright,” Harry tried it with optimism.
“We are not done yet!” Draco said in protest.
Harry nearly laughed. “Well, I think it’s working just fine.”
Harry shook his head. “Hopeless case. He keeps saying that they’re working on it but I think they have no clue which cure would work and hope that we will not complain too much.”
“Ron would’ve been against it either way. And every time I even mentioned him, you made some snide remark.”
“Or…,” Ron began thoughtfully fiddling with his shirt sleeves. “If you’re able to access Malfoy’s memories, you could maybe get information on his father. Ginny went on about him getting off easy because of his money non-stop. That the dirtbag got to walk free is anything but fair.” Harry and Hermione just stared at Ron matching shock on their faces. Ron raised his arms in defence. “Was jus’ an idea.”
“Why?” Harry asked almost a bit disappointed.
Hermione nervously played with a strand of hair. “Harry, I want you to know that-,”
“Lucidum,” replied Harry and moved his open Potions book over to Draco so he could see it better.
“And you’re not? I can decide for myself if I want to write or not.”
“Ron! Get up! I have to talk to you!” Harry shook Ron’s shoulder not minding the other Gryffindor boys.
Goyle was one of many Slytherins that had been – for a lack of a better word – forced by the Ministry to go back to Hogwarts for their finals. Most of them weren’t exactly looking forward to returning. And most of the other students shared that sentiment and decided to show their dissatisfaction through malicious comments or simple disregard. Draco was quite glad that him and his friends were more feared than hated which kept them out of a lot of trouble but they were still cautious to not wander around alone in case they were to run into a group of students that had lost loved ones in the war.
Draco took the advice and the both of them left the room to head back to their own rooms. Harry couldn’t help but grin the whole way back to the Gryffindor tower. To get along with Draco again had been surprisingly easy and surprisingly fulfilling.
The words cut into Harry’s heart like a sharp knife while he kept beating himself up over it.
Already after dinner, Harry watched his two best friends being all lovey-dovey with each other again. Harry was happy that it had worked out and that they both were on good terms again. No matter how angry he was with Ron, he knew very well how good Hermione and Ron were for each other. Draco didn’t show up for dinner but a friendly nod from Theo let Harry draw the conclusion that Draco was probably actually getting some sleep.
Ron seemed to fight himself to not reply with something condescending. “I wanted to talk to you anyway,” he tried again. Harry knew that he was being unfair to Ron but he hated the world a little too much right now to not hate Ron a little too.
“Have you calmed down?” He heard Dean’s voice. Harry’s heart was still racing but the anger was dissipating quickly while his disappointment grew. So, he nodded. Seamus and Dean let go of him which had Harry slumping down into himself. Neville carefully kneeled down in front of Harry and shot the other two Gryffindors a look seeking for help so they also sat down next to Harry.
Slughorn furrowed his brows. “Mr. Potter, could you be a little more precise?”
“I have no idea how you do it. There have been much more interesting things happening, lately,” Harry said honestly.
“Well,” Slughorn began a little hesitantly. “Of course, we are working tirelessly on various ways to undo this all. A simple cure would have been possible, was there not Mr. Potter’s spell. The potion in combination with the spell complicates the process a bit. But we assure you that we are doing everything we can.” Draco wasn’t able to hold back a sigh.
“You look like you’re seeing a human for the first time.”
“You know, even if I did that, you shouldn’t give a shit about it,” Harry replied. He had no intention of losing this playful debate.
“Eh look at that! Harry Potter is skipping tutoring lessons?” he said mock-shocked. The rest of the group now spotted him as well and made their way over to him. Harry laughed nervously and tried to look around for Draco as inconspicuously as possible because it looked like he had completely vanished.
“Not funny. I thought today morning I was going to die, again.” Harry replied quietly. He noticed out of his periphery how Ron’s attention turned to them as well.
“Ron told me,” Harry began and sounded somewhat stressed out by it. Draco tensed up immediately. “I don’t know what I should say. I’m just so incredibly sorry. You don’t know how damned angry I am with him…” Harry cut off weakly.
The Gryffindors had reacted with no understanding as Harry explained that he was not going to join their trip because he was planning on studying with Draco. As he said that Slughorn had ordered them to do it, Hermione sided with him and the rest started accepting his decision unhappily.
“So, she really confirmed having had that conversation with him?” Ron asked for the third time now slowly getting on Harry’s nerves.
“No but late if we keep standing around here,” Draco replied which got Harry moving aside so Draco and Blaise could move past them with matching grins on their lips. Harry turned back to his friends.
“A break won’t hurt.”
Ron was lying on the ground mumbling incoherent things and Hermione wasn't better off. She was sprawled over Ron's body covering his face with kisses.
Harry wasn’t even half bad as Draco’s partner. He was smart enough to not get in Draco’s way and got all the necessary ingredients ready. The water was already boiling in the cauldron when they were done with the preparations.
Harry swallowed and lowered his eyes to look at his shoes. “Not only that. Regarding the dream- “
Draco shrugged. “That should not really matter to you,” he remarked half-heartedly.
Harry spent the hours leading up to dinner ignoring any and all thought revolving around Malfoy. He played, or rather, lost against Ron in chess, chatted a bit with Dean and Seamus about the newest Quidditch results and discussed their last Charms essay with Ginny and Ron. Hermione ended the debate by offering them the correct answer.
“Maybe,” Harry shot back.
So, in the afternoon the three friends made their way to Potions class. They were a bit early, which Hermione thought of as the perfect opportunity, as Slughorn was already making himself busy sorting some books and therefore had time for Harry’s confession.
“Do you want to head back?” Harry heard himself say suddenly. His voice sounded raw as if he had cried for hours on end. Draco glanced at Harry, then nodded slowly. The two wizards got up and brushed carelessly the snow off their cloaks. The wet cold had completely soaked through. To Harry’s disappointment, Draco let go of his hand but he accepted it. He accepted the quiet that fell over them as well. He knew that Draco was waiting for him to talk about it. But Harry rather not think about anything so he embraced the silence.
“Why?” Draco asked and looked at Harry as if he lost his mind.
“This whole thing seems more than suspicious, Harry,” said Hermione honestly and eyed him with concern in her eyes again. Harry shrugged it off and let his thoughts go on about how awfully boring this school day would be.
Harry stood still. He glanced suspiciously at the other Gryffindor. “Why would I?”
“Do it then,” Harry replied just as quietly. He didn’t plan on defending himself. He wanted to finally know if Draco really hated him. And then he wanted to feel it so he could stop grieving about losing him. He wanted to hate Draco back. But for that he needed a damned reason first. Harry felt his throat closing up but blinked the traitorous tears decidedly away.  Out of his peripheral he saw Draco’s friends exchanging uncertain looks. They seemed to be waiting for a sign from Draco.
“Okay, this shouldn’t be too difficult when we’re practicing together. Simply think of disconnecting from my body but not my mind, otherwise we will both wake up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron shook decidedly his head. “The potion wasn’t even brewed correctly so even if it had an effect, it would definitely not be safe and Harry would be lying in the hospital wing by now.” Harry grimaced at that thought.
“The bloke’s not sick, he’s lonely. Give him his lunch and then talk to him or so help me-!”, Hermione scolded annoyed. Harry who didn’t want to hear the argument continue pulled the curtains loudly open.
Draco nodded thankfully as he heard the familiar screeching of the owls which weren’t that many on a Sunday. Because of that Draco noticed the eagle owl making calmly it’s way to him instantly.
“Where were you anyway?” Harry asked curiously.
“On Wednesday my friends and I wanted to play a bit Quidditch.”
Harry tilted his head pensively while he watched Draco closer. That the Slytherin was attractive was obvious but was he attractive enough for Harry to want to kiss him? His lips did look quite enticing. Harry couldn’t help but imagine how they would feel. They looked damned soft so Harry knew that they had to feel good. The fluttering in his stomach increased just like the pressure on his chest.
Harry started kneading his hands nervously. “I can’t talk about this with anyone else but I have to talk to someone because otherwise I just feel even worse.”
“And what will you do now?” Ron asked not even bothering to pretend as if he was paying attention.
“I-,” Draco started overwhelmed but stopped again. Harry now eyed Draco back. He had also put on a sweater and shoes but also a scarf which was a bit too green for the otherwise completely black outfit. Draco was grabbing the railing with one hand while the other one was hidden in his pocket. Harry had the sudden urge to put his hand over Draco’s to show him that everything would be alright but quickly pushed away that thought when he realized how strange that was. Draco was still Draco. Even if Harry was feeling pity for him right now.
Harry hesitated and started kneading his hands nervously.
Draco gave him a questioning look. “Everything alright?”
But Draco got interrupted. “Do you want a sandwich, Malfoy?”
Harry was bursting at the seams at the insinuation. To avoid any and all sexual thoughts around Draco seemed to be not working very well. “Madam Puddifoot’s Café is pure torture anyway,” Harry tried to change the subject.
“Well because I want to talk to him.” Harry didn’t quite understand the problem here.
“Sit down,” the Professor ordered both of them and sat down himself on a slightly dusty chair behind the office desk. The office didn’t look like it was really used at all. A few glasses with ingredients for potions were placed on the shelves but otherwise there were files laying around
Draco looked almost a bit sheepish. “Even for a Gryffindor you are quite dumb, Potter.” Harry opened his mouth in offence but closed it again.
Draco couldn’t help the smile. “Alright, fine. Just don’t run around and yell about us being friends to everyone or something. And if I know anything about you, that would definitely be something you’d do.”
Around midday, they picked a spot at the lake and got comfortable before happily devouring the sandwiches they brought. Harry was listening to Neville who was going on about a certain plant he was trying to grow with Professor Sprout when he noticed the blonde Slytherin slowly making his way towards them.
“How are you?” she asked in that clear voice.
"Well, me too!" Harry replied annoyed.
Harry smiled slightly at Draco. “Do you perhaps know a good tutor?”
“Ronald?!” he heard Hermione yelp a few octaves too high.
Harry opened the door to the Potions classroom yawning and was met with Slughorn as per usual.
“Malfoy,” Ron heard himself say condescendingly. But Malfoy didn’t say anything and instead looked around searchingly. He probably wanted to run away again. He was not a whit better than his damned father.
Yeah, he wasn't planning on witnessing any of that.
“I would flip out! What did Slughorn say about the cure?” Ron asked who had already finished his breakfast and was considering getting some more.
“Draco, please,” Harry heard himself say quietly. He wanted to step towards the blonde. Plead with him to talk to him again, to stop taking that potion and then hold his bloody hand. Instead, Harry stood still and grey eyes looked into green ones until Harry felt like time stood still as well. Then he felt the slight pressure against his throat fall away as Draco lowered his wand. His expression had gone from angry to hurt which Harry just managed to catch before the Slytherin already turned away and walked decidedly towards a corridor leading back into Hogwarts.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, thanks though. I have to go back to study.”
"I was sleeping here."
“Draco would definitely have been the Seeker again!” Draco tilted his head hearing his name being dropped.
Draco left the table a bit earlier than his friends and made his way to the library to return a book just before their first class would begin. As long as everyone was still at breakfast in the Great Hall, he was safe to walk around alone in the castle. He stayed in the library waiting patiently for most of the students to be in their classrooms before he rushed to his Potions class. Tardiness was definitely not helping his reputation but as it was his strongest subject, he thought he could indulge in a little tardiness every now and then.
Neville eyed Harry uncertainly. “Are you sure? You aren’t really studying anymore,” he asked again to be safe.
Harry nearly let out a surprised sound as he read what was written on the paper. Messily, a few potion ingredients were scribbled on it. Next to them were numbers to indicate which questions they were the answers for. Harry’s heartbeat made a weird little jump as he fixed his answers. His test still wasn’t perfect but at least it’d safe him from a Dreadful or even what could’ve been a Troll.
“He wouldn’t be this relaxed if that was the case,” answered Harry.
The hours leading up to lunchtime passed today much faster than usual. At lunch Harry tried again to get Hermione to reconsider but she showed no remorse and instead scolded him about taking responsibility for oneself. Ron kept mostly quiet. He was probably glad not to be on the receiving end this time.
Harry had been chewing on a piece of steak for the past five minutes now and observed the busy chatter in the Great Hall. The atmosphere was light, the excitement over lunch was big, Harry looked down the Gryffindor table where Hermione was massaging her temples and Ron talking insistently to her. Harry looked away again and searched for Draco on the Slytherin table.
Hermione nodded in understanding.
“Harry, damn it! I just wanted what was best for you!” Ron said outraged which was the last straw for Harry. He tried violently to escape the hold Seamus and Dean had on him while he repeated “the best?!” incredulously over and over again. Ron finally realized that now certainly wasn’t a time to talk so he followed Hermione’s advice and left in tow with her.
“Oh, and what are those interesting things?”
“Harry…,” Neville began hesitantly. But Harry shook his head. He pulled his knee close to his chest to lay his forehead on it. He focused on breathing in and out. The anger had taken completely over him, that hadn’t happened to him for a very long time. He tried to not think of Ron, not to think of Draco. Only about the cool air tousling his hair, the wet grass beneath him, the bright sun that would blind him if he looked up. It worked and Harry actually calmed down. He still felt the pain in his chest but at least he had some control over it.
“Are you going to join us, Harry?” Luna asked in her innocent voice.
“Tell me you weren’t going to jump!” Harry gasped not very tactfully. Draco eyed him dubiously. Harry wasn’t sure if those were tears in his eyes that he saw or if it was just eyes watering from the wind.
Harry nearly jumped at the question. Now or never. “Uh… that was also kind of an apology, I guess.”
Finally, Draco let out a sigh. “Very well, but if anybody spots us, it is all on you.”
A few seconds later the burning pain on his face subsided. Draco thought he tasted something salty. Draco looked around not able to process what had happened. The cauldron which he had thrown over was lying somewhere between all the staring students, Harry just got up and cleaned his glasses of a purple-coloured liquid and Slughorn waved his wand over another cauldron. The liquid, which turned out to be the potion Draco and Harry had just brewed, flew over and landed blubbering into the cauldron.
Harry stayed a bit longer in the Great Hall and waited patiently for most of his friends and other students to leave. Draco did the same. No sooner had most of the Slytherins left, Harry got up and casually walked over to the Slytherin table. He came to a halt across from Draco and considered sitting down.
Harry waited more or less patiently until Draco finally left the Great Hall with his friends in tow and instantly followed him not caring about the increasing murmurs around him. The groups of Slytherins weren’t very fast so Harry caught up quickly to them. Feeling a little awkward, Harry wondered how to catch their attention but Blaise was already a step ahead.
Harry grinned. “I thought you didn’t want to see Gryffindor wi-”
He startled a bit as his pillow moved and then... it groaned? What? Did he fall asleep on some weird hexed pillow? Before he could finish his thoughts though, his pillow squeaked like a teenage girl and fell out of bed.
“And he really threw a potion at you? Isn’t that sort of dangerous?”
“Of cou-,” Harry began but was interrupted by Hermione.
Ron’s eyes were filled with disappointment but his anger was stronger. “And what if I don’t accept it?” he asked challengingly.
One of Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “How come you think that that is important to me?”
