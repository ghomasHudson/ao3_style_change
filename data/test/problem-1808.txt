No… Harry wasn’t there. He was in the study. Draco and Ron were still staring expectantly at him. Cautiously, he dropped his gaze back down, poised to move away in an instant if necessary.
But Ron was still talking. “That doesn’t matter now though. They’ve managed to view enough specific memories of… stuff that I wasn’t clear about why I did. Or
As he focussed on his goal, Harry heard a crackle and a faint gasp from Malfoy above him. Centred on his task though he was, Harry also listened intently to ensure that Malfoy was still breathing normally and hadn't been affected other than possible startlement from Harry’s magic. Harry could hear Malfoy’s breaths, could smell him, felt his reliable presence, and was reassured.
The shock of the question raised Harry’s gaze. Malfoy seemed to be examining every part of him with interest, eyes shifting over Harry’s body from head to toe.
Feeling hopeful, Harry leaned forward in his seat to seek a comforting kiss, gratified when Malfoy’s mouth opened slightly to receive him. Harry was just settling in, deepening their contact and enjoying the flexible length of Draco’s tongue against his own when he heard a discouragingly familiar chirping from directly above his head. Knowing from experience that memos only became more insistent if he tried to ignore them, he pulled back reluctantly from Draco and looked up. As expected, a paper bird had popped into existence and now that he’d acknowledged it, fluttered down gracefully into his lap. Sighing, he plucked it up and unfolded it, apprehensive about the possible contents. But nevertheless, he began to read:
by himself. The surveillance wasn’t intended to spy; recordings would only be looked at in the event of the spell detecting something illegal. And even then, it had to be above a certain level of wrongdoing before the spell would alert the Auror department. The Wizengamot had been aware of that. Harry didn’t care if people were nicking supplies from their offices or other such misdemeanours. He’d only wanted to keep people safe from anything that would harm them. The Unforgivables were at the top of that list. And the Wizengamot had deliberately left people exposed after Harry had assured those people that they’d be safe.
“Ron’s coming over to meet us at the Manor this afternoon, anyway. I’ll speak to him then,” said Harry.
being a disobedient whore today. But we can discuss your punishment for this infringement at a later time.”
. How strange it felt to be offered something so huge. Draco hoped Potter’s faith in him wasn’t misguided.
, and not to come. Failure to orgasm in those circumstances wasn’t actually too difficult for Harry. Topping had always felt uncomfortable to him. He’d never liked it very much and sometimes he’d needed to concentrate
Harry shifted as directed, dug the fingers of both hands deep into his crack and separated his buttocks as wide as he could while still moving his hips against the table.
“Hmm… I’m not sure that punishment is appropriate though,” Draco whispered. Harry frowned, about to assure Draco that it most certainly
“But,” Harry started to object, but it occurred to him that he’d done the same thing for Draco a little while ago.
Harry snuggled Draco back into his chest and waved his hand at the discarded duvet to settle it back over them both.
“Spit in my palm.” Eyes widening, Harry gasped. “This is your only chance.” Harry paused, unsure. Dirtying Malfoy’s skin seemed disrespectful. “I won’t offer again. You have until the count of three. One, two…” Somehow, Harry managed to desperately gather enough saliva to spit in Malfoy’s palm during the last second. It didn’t look very much. The hand cupped and retreated.
“Umm… Draco… since you’ve sold the Manor now… how do you feel about me breaking the Anti-Apparation wards? ‘Cos I am butt naked here.”
Connected. He felt connected to the wood and to the sliver of plant within it. Like there was a direct link from Harry, through the wood and straight down the core. He wasn’t sure how to describe it, but it was strong, balanced, secure.
. But to Harry’s horror, the mattress bounced slightly beneath him, obviously due to Draco standing up.
Draco wouldn’t trust himself to cast a first-year spell with that mouth poised inches above his jutting penis; merely breathing, waiting… for permission, encouragement or Draco to lose his mind, Draco wasn’t sure which.
But although life felt more settled now, Harry didn’t believe for a second that Draco had forgotten what Harry had told him. And the essential piece of information which Harry still hadn’t confirmed.
Harry was a fair person; he’d tried to approach Ron several times after that conversation, but Ron was angry. Ron had been hoping that Harry and Michael’s relationship was going to last, and Harry had
But Draco still needed to put his own needs firmly first, so, it was time to try with Potter again. Draco’s act of protecting the Saviour had rendered him somehow worthy of acceptance into the pack but hadn’t changed Potter’s view of him.
Without relinquishing his position, Draco grappled blindly to locate his wand, hoping that it wasn’t already too late. His incantation was slightly marred by another moan as Potter’s hand took hold of his cock again, but the magic should be good enough. An impenetrable barrier charm would also be a wise addition, but that was beyond Draco’s current ability.
Harry liked it when Malfoy smiled. The relaxed curve of that mouth almost distracted him from the proposed destination. Almost. Malfoy had never been to Harry’s home. Harry had been very careful
To offset his tone, or maybe to emphasise it, Harry gripped the back of Draco’s neck and dragged Draco down to his mouth. Harry poured the love he couldn’t verbalise into other movements of his lips and tongue: soft caresses, slow tastes and familiar explorations, deepening as Draco’s tongue met his.
is a valid possibility, I think. Or… it might be ridiculous, but I’m wondering if Ron asked me to help Michael, knowing what would happen. If he might’ve done it on purpose.”
The ‘betrayal’ part remained to be determined. The bathroom thing was… valid. They’d left Luna sitting by herself for slightly too long, not that she’d appeared to mind. Or be surprised. It was now several days after her suggestion that Harry work in Ollivanders and he was seriously considering the prospect, although Harry still didn’t know how useful he’d be. But that was something to think about after he’d managed to get some proper rest. If he managed to do that.
Reviewing his many observations of Potter, Draco wasn’t so sure. Still worried but unwilling to admit it, he cast a surreptitious, wandless health scan of Potter’s body to check for any physical damage, but thankfully located nothing of concern. Just a small area of skin slightly traumatised by the impact. No concussion or other internal issues. Might give rise to a light bruise.
“No, of course not. But they’re concerned about you. And angry,” she added. Harry felt his eyes widen as he contemplated facing their justified anger. “Not angry with
“Okay,” Malfoy sounded unsure. “I’m sorry. I thought it’d be a fun thing to try. Clearly not, though.”
That belief eased some of Harry’s trepidation. “Then… umm, I should… you do seem ready,” Harry murmured.
slippery area of his crack, he still hadn’t lined them up successfully. Face beginning to burn with the humiliation of looming failure, he bowed his head and tried to hide. Harry tutted quietly in growing frustration, bit his lip to calm a threatening sense of distress, and reluctantly relinquished one of Draco’s wrists. Draco didn’t comment as Harry reached his right hand behind him to find Draco’s shaft, guiding the wet tip to where he needed it.
was an overstatement. Draco was taking an infuriating amount of time to instigate actual sex. Apparently, there was absolutely
the same when Draco pulled the fabric down to Harry’s ankles, prised off Harry’s trainers and urged him to step out of his jeans. At one point, Harry needed to flail out a hand onto Draco’s shoulder for balance. But Harry
. I thought the Chief Warlock was going to shit himself, you looked that fucking frightening. I’ve never seen anyone back down from an argument so fast.”
Luna was seated at her huge worktable, hunched over while she stared intently at an array of materials used for wand cores through the pair of huge, thick-lensed magnifying glasses which Harry was now accustomed to her wearing while she created her wands. Harry saw feathers, hairs, bones, plant stems and a host of other things that he had no hope of identifying.
, because Harry was incapable of ever doing the right thing. “I didn’t,” he admitted. He still couldn’t look at Draco. “I’m sorry.” Harry didn’t have an excuse other than his own pathetic fear of nudging Draco in the right direction. “It wasn’t Ron.” Something occurred to Harry. “You didn’t… the reason Ron withdrew, that wasn’t because of anything you did, was it?”
A blink, just one. That’s all that Draco’s righteous anger warranted from Potter. Draco waited, clinging to the last remnants of his patience, while privately resolving that if Potter didn’t offer him a more worthy sign of acknowledgement very shortly, then Draco was going to toss him out of the nearest window and do his best to ignore the urge to save him.
As they rapidly left the building, all Harry’s attempts to speak to Malfoy or reclaim his wrist were ignored. Not that Harry was putting much effort into it. They were treated to a couple of incredulous looks as Malfoy dragged him through the corridors, but this wasn’t the strangest thing people had witnessed from Malfoy.
Draco sighed with contentment. “Oh. I still owe you a punishment,” he yawned. “For your shameful but entirely appropriate disobedience.”
Harry’s erection had previously found a lovely balance between excitement and peaceful expectancy, but as the tremors increased, that equilibrium threatened to tip. The length of his cock filled to capacity again in response to the unusual form of busyness in his arsehole.
Potter’s amazement was disturbingly endearing, and his beaming smile was crushingly handsome. “Then, we’re even.”
Michael stepped forwards, bringing the length of their bodies flush together. The additional contact caused Harry’s breath to stutter in his chest with panic, and with a gasp, Harry threw off the curse.
Malfoy held the base of Harry’s cock between his thumb and index finger, pointing it proudly upright as Malfoy bowed his head and the tip of Harry’s erection passed between soft lips, the crown sliding into warmth. Despite his eagerness, Harry’s first instinct to that sensation was
fun,” Potter said. For a second, Draco thought Potter was referring to their sexual activities until he added, “Snape’s even more of a git when he’s teaching on a one-to-one basis. But… I’d be long dead if it wasn’t for him. Even after the war.”
He watched from under heavy-lidded eyes as Malfoy pushed himself up to all fours and crawled forwards over Harry’s prone body.
Resigned to the fact that burrowing was probably not the bravest solution, Harry aimed himself in the direction of the chair and crawled until he was in front of Draco, where he sat back on his heels again and tried not to die of shame.
Yup, that was pretty much it. All Harry could manage was a nod. He focussed his gaze back to his glass. Beside him, Malfoy lapsed into silence. Harry’s lungs felt constricted as he waited to see what Malfoy would do. What he would say to stamp Harry’s self-worth into the ground. It might never recover.
“Narcissistic, is the word you’re looking for. And yes, it’s been there a while. Since I was about seven, I think. Bastard loved to admire himself as he wrote his missives of blackmail and other evil deeds.” At least Draco didn’t seem bothered about Harry’s treatment of his family. “What did he say to you?”
“About three seconds before I rescued you.” Harry could feel his own cheeks heating at the thought that he’d required rescuing. “I’m an excellent Personal Assistant, Potter. I anticipated your needs.”
Malfoy rose to locate the scroll in the pocket of Harry’s robe. It did look a bit worse for wear. Harry wringing it between his fists as he left the meeting probably hadn’t helped to preserve its pristineness. Not to mention the cascade of hot caffeinated liquid that it had been treated to soon after. Malfoy sat again and unrolled the scroll delicately with his slim, nimble fingers. It apparently took him a while to find what he was looking for, as his gaze didn’t leave the long expanse of parchment for several minutes.
The next morning, his meeting with Potter was notable in two distinct ways. One: Potter wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Two: for the first time in months, Potter did not invite Draco to join the Gryffindors for breakfast.
“Keep up, Potter. I’m not going to wait while you cringe like a virgin.” As always, the derision only increased Harry’s excitement, and now it also helped to ease his nerves. “I’m going to give you directions and you will carefully listen and follow them. And your hands will remain where they are unless I give you permission to move them. Do you understand?”
Aware of how important the Floo call had been, Harry wondered whether he should ask if it’d been successful. That negotiation was intended to be the culmination of Draco’s hard work. He decided to wait until he and Draco were alone. It was astounding enough to Harry that Draco had accepted Ron’s presence in the Manor; he didn’t want to rock that boat by discussing possibly sensitive topics regarding the disposal of Draco’s heritage in front of him.
Potter shrugged his lack of committal. “If you want. But I like it out here. Not so many people.” Potter glanced around them. “
Harry did as he was directed. As he flattened himself against the cool wood, he congratulated himself on a wise choice of furniture: the ideal height to bend over easily, with a wide square surface upon which to rest his torso and head. He was curling his fingers around the opposite edge when Malfoy next spoke.
Draco wondered if he’d have better luck with the name Potter had asked him to use. “Harry, we need to discuss that.”
“Okay. Let’s go home,” Harry announced as he pushed himself to his feet. He’d offered a hand to Draco and assisted him up before something occurred to him. “Unless you’d like to stay for a while longer.”
… that was good. Thicker and deeper than fingers could be, and so satisfying as Harry was slowly filled.
have something to apologise for. A lot of things. He started to say that when Molly interrupted him.
No, Draco didn’t. He was entirely unconcerned about Potter, strange personality flips included. Draco let himself focus on Potter’s attentions again but it was no use denying the truth for long.
Fluttering his eyelids shut, Harry allowed a tiny whimper to escape his lips, hoping for the thrill of a reprimand.
There wasn’t a sensible reply to explain the inner workings of Ron’s mind, so Harry offered a shrug. Draco remained motionless above him, and Harry listened intently until he heard the whoosh of the Floo activating in the next room.
. And after I’m done with the buggering, I’m going to find that thing and melt it down. If anyone takes a ruddy huge vibrator up their rectum, it’ll be
It wasn’t necessary to ask what ‘that’ was, but Harry would be surprised if Michael didn’t understand
“So, what should I do n -” Harry jumped as the smoke abruptly reversed its route, drew back into the wand, and had entirely vanished within seconds.
“Ron’s been… confused and conflicted about you for a long while,” Molly continued. “And now I might be beginning to suspect why,” she said with a glower which was unnerving on her usually friendly face.
“That’s… not a solution,” Harry blurted out, wondering if he could discreetly manoeuvre a cushion over his crotch. But Malfoy wasn’t blind; there was no possibility that he hadn’t already noticed the tenting of Harry’s trousers during his examination.
Immersing himself in his task, Harry worked slowly, carefully, cautiously… diligently referring to his written notes before each step, despite Luna’s claim that he didn’t need them.
Draco’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Good. That’s good. Not the panicking thing, the other, the important
“Actually, yes.” Draco looked sceptical, so Harry continued, “Just restless. Maybe I’m nervous about this thing with Ron and Hermione tomorrow. Feels like a double date or something.”
The time that Harry had initially saved by kicking his pile of clothes untidily onto the floor had already been repaid many times over. He fought to resist the urge to roll his eyes since his last display of that expression was what had prompted the lecture. If Harry did it again, he’d probably be left here unshagged all night.
Harry took a pause and glanced up. Malfoy was gaping at him in rare shock at the fate of his beloved paperwork. “They set it on
“They’ve been trying to get in here for a while, actually,” Harry mumbled, thinking of the alarm he’d been ignoring.
“Good. We’ll use it again.” Not wanting to dissuade Draco from that intention, Harry remained silent. “Weasley’s not as thick as I’d thought. And apparently, brothers talk when one of them gives a free sex toy to partners of family members. Weasley told
? Or whatever the fuck that thing was made of. Not a chance in Hell. If Malfoy was hungry, he could get off his lazy butt and feed himself.
winding you up. But yes. I do have a vibrator. Haven’t used it though. To be honest, I bought it for your insatiable arse. Seemed like something you’d enjoy.”
Through his inhales and exhales, Harry could still feel it; the pressure hovering millimetres from the surface of his skin that was desperately pushing against his efforts to contain it, tingling, buzzing, wanting to be
Draco’s throat felt like it was constricting. Honesty from Potter, honesty from himself, too many disclosures, and then this gnawing fear that Potter might do something terrible. But Potter wouldn’t. Because Draco wouldn’t fucking
As they both began to descend the stairs, Harry grinned as he listened to Ron’s shocked squeals and Draco’s stifled laughter.
It might, but Harry didn’t want that on his conscience. “Please don’t do that. We don’t need to… embark on a quest for vengeance.”
Hands still behind his back where Malfoy had left them, Harry felt fingers curl around his right wrist and lift his hand, tugging it lower, directing it towards his crack.
“She’s fine,” Harry assured as the pink ball headed towards the open bedroom door. “She’ll go off and hunt for bugs, then come back.”
Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen Potter look more affronted. But he waited again, certain that Potter would rise to the challenge.
loyalty wasn’t the purpose of the exercise. It was about the… transference of ownership. My father willingly giving the last thing he had to offer to the Dark Lord.”
. You’ve done enough. Let the world fend for themselves, it’s about time they did.” Harry would try, but the guilt still gnawed at him. He nodded, attempting to appear more confident than he felt. But Malfoy wasn’t fooled. “
Harry speculated whether he should feel guilty about scaring the Warlock as well. “I might’ve been… upset that day.”
“Please… try,” gasped Harry, worried after the latter word had left his mouth that it could be perceived as an instruction beyond his current station. He hadn’t meant it to be.
Feeling uncomfortably exposed by the abruptness, Harry gaped. He was very accustomed to being naked around Draco, but Draco usually took the time to undress him, or instruct Harry to disrobe. It was part of the experience, the build-up, even when Harry was submitting.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair as he replied, “Attention to detail. I told you, it’s the
“Well, it’s trying… but I think you’re going to need to wait,” Malfoy declared as he moved off Harry to lie beside him.
“Don’t blame my paperwork, it was perfect.” Harry noticed that Malfoy hadn’t replaced his wand in his sleeve. Instead, he held it within a white-knuckled grip. “The handwriting alone was a work of art. And I’m still mourning its tragic demise.”
“One more to go.” Fingers squeezed the flesh of Harry’s left arse cheek. Malfoy chuckled as Harry hissed. “Best make this one count.”
“Uhuh. I suppose.” Harry was worried though, that this might give the wrong impression. “I don’t want to do more than… I did there.”
wasn’t looking at him. In his submissive role, Harry often wasn’t expected to look directly at Draco, but Draco
“Yeah. I’ll… work up to it.” Harry would put that on his list of things to do. Very soon. “Umm… you mentioned… several things that you did?”
“Okay,” Harry sighed. Draco was beginning to look confused, maybe panicked, so Harry felt the urge to say more. “You know… this isn’t

interested. In perhaps more than friendship or expulsion. Curious, Draco decided that an experiment might be of benefit.
Although, in this instance, a stray thought prompted Harry to hope that Draco also knew how long he could leave the pan sizzling on the hob before it would burn. Draco’s attentiveness didn’t often extend to cooking. Somehow, the sight of Harry preparing breakfast had inspired Draco to become interested in other, more carnal pursuits and Harry had eagerly allowed himself to become distracted from his task. Or rather, Harry had been ordered down to the floor by a rumbling growl in his ear, instructed to crawl to the far corner of the kitchen and wait until his services were required. Harry hadn’t felt compelled to argue.
Draco was poised at the edge of the mattress, but his curiosity was overriding the urge to leave. “Why would you think that? That they don’t want you there?”
“Yes,” Draco answered, after he’d forced himself to remember what Potter had asked him. “Of course, I still want that. But Potter, you -”
At ten minutes past the hour, Draco still hadn’t entered the room. It’d taken only two passes before the door had appeared but finding the courage to enter was taking him much longer.
Harry was naked while Draco hadn’t bothered to undress at all. Malfoy had simply unfastened his belt and trousers, shoved them down to his thighs with his briefs and demanded that the impromptu lesson begin.
Potter’s heel slid in the mud as he stumbled backwards, but he regained balance before he fell. “You would’ve that first night, if I’d been more… sure about things. And now you’ve dragged me out here, just to
“Well, I don’t think we were previously playing Aurors and Dark Wizards, but we… could. If… you’d like to.” The grin on Draco’s face faltered, then started to fall. “No pressure. I won’t push you to have sex.
Draco nodded, but he didn’t look convinced. Harry thought it would probably take time. After all, Harry’s guilt complex wasn’t vanishing overnight.
Frantic at the continuing lack of his experienced employer’s appearance and worried about customer safety, Harry decided that he needed to do
Harry sighed. He was doing a lot of that today. “I dunno… attitudes, the way people expect me to be. What they expect me to do. What they think I should want.”
He tried to determine what it was that he was afraid of. It wasn’t the unknown magic, he realised. Harry had faced down plenty of unknown magic in his life. Not that this had turned out be unknown at all.
Malfoy’s hand stroked the curve once more, before leaving Harry’s arse and immediately returning with force.
A line of bafflement creased between Potter’s eyebrows. “And who decides what you’re allowed to have?”
It felt like everything was slowing down, his thoughts becoming muddy and dull. And Harry’s arms were tingling. How strange. As he assessed this sensation, he gradually realised that his hands were sore. This fact was slightly confusing to him until he registered the redness of his skin, and the first signs of smudged blisters rising from his palms and fingers.
“Do you need some instruction?” Draco interjected, not sure why he was goading Potter when a renewed twitch in his groin suggested that it’d be a much better idea to be shedding clothes and/or writhing in seductive encouragement.
“It’s fine. It’s just Ron.” He was still astounded by Draco’s nonchalance though. “But how are you not
“It’s okay, Draco. I expect you to be honest,” he added, in case Draco was feeling reluctant to be open about Harry’s performance.
Harry’s breath huffed out of his lungs as the flat of Malfoy’s hand reconnected with his arse. The smack sounded very loud in the quiet of the room and Harry’s right hand skidded out of position with the shock, almost unbalancing him before he yanked it back to where it had been. Oh,
The smile on Oliver’s face was causing a heavy, sinking feeling to settle in Harry’s stomach. Publicly known as Harry’s latest attempt at a boyfriend, Harry imagined that Oliver had been welcomed through security with open arms. The people must ensure that their Saviour was happily paired off, after all, even after only three weeks. Harry didn’t want a fourth. And he was certain that he’d informed Oliver of that last night.
As Harry turned in that direction, Molly said from behind him, “I like seeing you happy, Harry dear.”
Harry breathed until his mind began to clear again. And of course, his reaction to the submissive position had a predicable result. During his panic, his cock had softened, but it filled again now as he was enclosed within a safe space.
Immediately, Draco’s gaze snapped into focus and finally met Harry’s eyes. Draco moved his erection quickly away, released Harry’s wrists to support himself on the rug instead and shifted onto all fours above Harry’s body. No part of Draco was touching Harry anymore. Draco blinked down in alarm. This was only the second instance during their relationship when Harry had felt the need to use his safe word, and it was no less effective than the first time at ceasing all activity.
know anything more than the basics about the magical mechanics of wands but assisting Luna in the shop could be interesting. He would think about it, but Harry had a lot of estate stuff to help Draco with first. And Draco had been in the little boy’s room long enough. If Draco wasn’t back by the time Luna returned to the table with drinks, Harry was going in to ‘rescue’ him.
. Malfoy knew how to land a blow. Not that Harry had been in any doubt of that; he’d experienced Malfoy’s physical strength many times, before and after the beginning of their relationship. Not quite like this though.
The world where he’d once felt secure was gone. Instead, Draco felt like he was navigating dangerous terrain strewn with hidden pitfalls and obvious traps, all carefully set to swallow him whole if he dared to set a foot out of line.
Malfoy held him in place, making use of Harry’s body at a rhythm and pace of Malfoy’s choosing, and Harry moaned with the sheer pleasure of it.
Harry badly hoped that he wouldn’t need to set anything else on fire today. It was starting to become fairly distressing. But now wasn’t a time for allowing himself to give into distress, he needed to make sure that Draco was all right.
Still not looking up at Draco, Harry tried to speak of something he hadn’t told anyone. “A few…” Harry faltered as his throat closed. He coughed and tried again. “A few years ago, not long before the election, I was in a new relationship. But it turned out… badly. They all turned out badly I suppose, but this one was… worse.”
Draco contemplated various methods to rid himself of this nuisance, none of which were plausible. Hexing would obviously be a very bad move, and physical violence would be equally frowned upon by both the school and the Ministry.
“You don’t need to protect Winkleprick from the evil Wizengamot. He’s a big boy. He can take care of himself.”
The refusal spiked Harry’s enjoyment even further. He wouldn’t beg; hadn’t been given permission to. Instead, he released his lip and resorted to open-mouthed gasps as he hung on to his control.
Ah. Slightly reassured that Malfoy might not be much more experienced than him in these things if he was only reading about it, Harry panted with excitement and nerves. But he did have a word, although he’d never used it. Harry recalled it now.
“Apparently, that didn’t matter. Whatever you want, you shall receive,” Draco said, decorating the words with one of his best smirks. “The world is
Potter bent forward, curled legs and torso together, and buried his face into his blanket-draped knees.
Feeling emboldened and spurred on by the needs of his neglected cock, Harry tried to move events along. “Please. I need you to fuck me.”
His knees and thighs were beginning to ache by the time he heard Malfoy again. A soft, unintelligible whisper preceded the distinct sound of a hand moving over a lubricated cock; it was unmistakable.
Harry was abandoned beside the worktable without a clue why Luna had considered his complete guess to be ‘good’ or whether he was now expected to take some sort of action. Placing the piece of wood and handkerchief carefully back onto the table, he decided that it’d be a safer bet to go home to Draco.
After a hesitation that seemed to Harry to last a lifetime, Malfoy slowly said, “I’m… sure you’ll be a… very good boy.” He sounded alarmingly intrigued.
Immediately, Harry lost the tentative grip he had on his control, his entire body seemed to clench and spasm, and he
to do that. There was a specific spell which Luna had taught him to use when inserting a core and he’d ignored it in favour of an instinctual action.
Harry was soon guided through various rooms, attentive as Malfoy briefly but merrily disparaged his family’s taste in décor.
Malfoy tilted his head, peering at Harry with slitted eyes. “What’s wrong with you? You’re being even more useless than usual.”
“Please get an umbrella for Draco too,” Harry added as she stood, merely to see the affronted look on Draco’s face when he saw his drink.
“I know we haven’t… spoken for a while,” Ron said over Harry’s silence. “And things have been… awkward, but I miss you, Harry.”
Catching it, Draco tutted in disapproval before he placed the t-shirt atop his tidy pile of clothes on a nearby chair. “I remember when you used to fold your clothes neatly for me.”
It was strange how much more vulnerable Harry felt without the protection of Draco’s body above him, but there was no-one else here but the two of them to witness him in his exposed state. Harry shuffled further down Draco’s thighs to hopefully give the clear impression that this adjustment of their positions was not leading to sex. Not that either of their cocks were particularly perky now.
Harry lost sight of Malfoy as he moved behind him. Malfoy’s position was soon confirmed though as Harry felt what surely had to be the tip of the plug press against his abused hole. The silicone was slightly cool and very wet, perhaps Harry had finally earned lubricant again. Or perhaps Malfoy’s semen was coating it. He gritted his teeth as the plug nudged inwards. Although his anus felt well loosened from its previous use, it still didn’t seem quite relaxed enough to take this. But Malfoy was persistent as he patiently twisted the object and altered its angle in careful movements, easing it inside and approaching what Harry hoped was the widest point. Harry’s dangerous level of arousal had again started to become an issue. This thing was so
Harry had. And although he was understanding better now what Malfoy had been trying to do, this was still a step too far for him. If he hadn’t experienced so much fulfilling sex with Malfoy, then he might’ve done it. That was what Harry
automatically puts me in good standing. Gringotts owled to offer me a position a few weeks ago. Banking though… ugh. My father would’ve loved that. Not me.” Draco’s shoulders shuddered, reminding Harry just how different from his father Draco was. Not that Harry needed any convincing.
“Now, Potter. All you need to do is lie there like the pretty whore you are and let me use you. You are still not permitted to come.”
Over the last week and a half, much of their limited spare time had been spent exploring interesting aspects and possibilities of their new sex life together. Harry merely needed to allow Malfoy to take control and they could slip easily into roles which both of them enjoyed. But half as sleep as he was at the moment, Harry’s cock was responding quicker than his brain.
Harry took a deep breath. “I do… feel that for you.” Speaking the specific words aloud was still beyond him, so he added, “I really do. But I… don’t ask for help.” Draco nodded. Draco knew that; he’d just
“Crawl here to Daddy,” Draco instructed, as if referring to Malfoy as ‘Daddy’ was a perfectly normal occurrence for either of them.
his life. Okay, fair enough. Harry was giving that a go, so he asked, “Did you have a particular service in mind, sir?”
. When he felt composed enough to raise his eyelids, he was greeted by the sight of a motionless, quiet Potter kneeling above him, chin tucked into his chest and eyes flicking to the left of Draco’s bed, obviously calculating his route to freedom.
Making sure he had a good grasp of his own hands, Harry attempted to recreate the manoeuvre. The uneven mattress didn’t make it any easier.
Suddenly, Malfoy’s hands were on both of Harry’s hips, moving Harry down before he was ready and pulling an alarmed squeal from his mouth as Malfoy’s cock began to breach his arsehole. But the push, the
Draco looked confused. Harry watched his expression, trying to decide whether it would be a good plan at this point to speak. He decided not to, instead moving his arms down from around Draco’s shoulders. Resting his hands on Draco’s waist to give the impression of a less desperate grasp, Harry waited as he fiddled with the hem of Draco’s jumper.
And to his father, as Lucius’ battering on the edge of his frame appeared to indicate. It was a silent battering, but most of the insults were simple enough to lip read. When Harry had selected the library to work in today, Draco had cheerfully retrieved the portrait and hung it by the door.
, not then.” Despite Draco’s assurances, Harry was still worried. “You look like you’re about to ask me if I’m okay.” Harry had been. “No,” Draco whispered. “I’m not okay. But,” he sighed, “I will be. I
Not for the first time, Harry wondered if maybe he needed to seek other… help. Someone to talk to whom Harry wouldn’t feel so dreadful about burdening. Maybe. He’d think about it.
with each of Malfoy’s thrusts, the fist tightened even more in Harry’s hair, his neck and shoulders ached from their pulled-back position, his legs trembled from maintaining their spread stance, and his cock
Harry was contemplating the value of mentally counting McGonagall’s possible collection of cosy thermal underwear as one of the unsexiest things he could think of when a quiet shuffle from his left caught his attention. Turning his head in the direction of the sound, he was certain that an imprint of the cuff would be etched into his forehead beside his scar.
“What has?” Draco asked. The answer was at least partially obvious, but Draco wanted to keep Potter talking now that the subject had been breached.
Potter’s smile was an expression which could become damaging to Draco’s resolve. “Then you could teach me. To protect your delicate body from harm.”
direct. “Sex. Shagging. You give me a blowjob and I might ram my cock up your arse. It must surely sound like a familiar concept, even if you haven’t done it before.”
Potter’s eyes flicked up, shining with sudden mischief. “So, you’re saying that I should do whatever I want to?”
“One day, if you like,” Malfoy said, turning Harry’s quip into something more serious. “But I think that might be more than you need just now. And I haven’t done that. I'm not sure how to go about it, to be honest. Could be an interesting experiment though.”
“Yeah, I did read that. Was kind of hoping you hadn’t though. Well, how about doing your duties extraordinarily badly? Until they’re practically pushing you out the door. Incompetence is not regarded as harshly as negligence of duty within your contract.”
Draco shrugged. It wasn’t like him not to be verbose, but Harry didn’t get a chance to ask before Luna walked out of the back room carrying a tall, unstable pile of wand boxes which she could hardly see around.
When Draco awoke from a fitful sleep the following morning, he followed his habitual practice of rising before the Gryffindors, trying to pretend while he dressed that he wasn’t listening for any sign of movement from Potter’s bed.
Keen though Harry was to leave, the available exit processes of walking out of the Manor or using the Floo didn’t have their usual appeal. He supposed he could conjure something to make do but wasn’t sure what he’d end up with or if he’d trust them not to disappear at an inopportune moment. And the few items left in the building were not meant to be transfigured.
Draco needed to abandon this ridiculous line of reasoning; it was going to make him crazy. The notion of either Snape or Weasley as sexually active would be enough to scar any poor soul for life, and yet the pictures which his imagination had conjured were reluctant to disappear.
Harry breathed out slowly, aware of their audience and keen to minimise the damage. In his peripheral vision, he could see Malfoy sitting very still, eagerly watching the exchange. He considered again the benefits of closing the connecting door, but that would leave him alone with Oliver. That was unappealing.
Holding Harry within a tender and protective embrace, Draco rocked them. Not sufficiently to shift the chair, but moving their torsos together in a gentle sway, back and forth, a motion which also created small changes in the positions of their hips and groins, and repeatedly slid the length of Harry’s cock against Draco’s.
Watching Malfoy’s appreciative gaze roam over the shelves and books which lined all the walls, floor to ceiling, Harry was pleased that at least something here apparently made Draco happy.
, but Harry felt drained. Pressing himself close to Draco, he enjoyed a slow slide of tongue, careful to keep it to a shop-appropriate level of intimacy. It wouldn’t do to get carried away; Luna was incorrigible enough. As he stepped back, he paused as his hand brushed against a round protrusion in Draco’s front right pocket which he didn’t think had resulted from excitement. He could’ve sworn it
Harry was speeding up when a sudden tug on his left hand indicated that Draco wanted his wrist free. Harry had suspected that Draco’s submission might only go so far. More than happy to oblige, Harry released that wrist and rested his hand on Draco’s chest, startled but thrilled when Draco’s hand went directly to Harry’s cock.
Work the problem. Fix it. Find a way around it. Malfoy had given him clear instructions. And Harry needed to remember that nothing made him feel more secure than doing what Malfoy told him to. He only had to allow himself to
Oliver’s smile wavered, but held as he walked towards Harry. “We could get out and do something fun. And we’d have a chance to talk after,” he whispered, leaning too close.
He was seriously considering an affronted objection when Malfoy leaned close, broke character for several delightful seconds of gentle kissing, then spun him around to face the table.
Gaping, Harry took a step in reverse, raising himself back to the stair which he had just descended. Further retreat was stopped by Draco’s body behind him. The soft touch of a hand to the small of his back helped to calm Harry’s thudding heartbeat.
“It’s a Pensieve. It’ll… actively find bad memories and erase them. Store them in there, I think. I don’t even
Potter squirmed against Draco’s back, causing soft hair to tickle his shoulder. What felt suspiciously like lips on Draco’s skin preceded Potter’s next whisper. “Yup. But your bed looked better. And yeah, I definitely have a wand.”
“You will be. And I shall selflessly allow you to practice on my equipment to help you hone your skills. After all, you assisted me with my project.”
Gaze clearly monitoring Harry’s level of discomfort, Draco replied, “Yes. For whatever reason, he seems discontent with his current PA.”
The rocking was a different level of torment now, still pushing Harry’s arse into the mattress and consequently shifting the vibrating length within him, but combined with the slide of cock against cock, it was becoming too much stimulation. The precum which had been copiously leaking from Harry’s tip created an easy glide, and all together, it was
,” Harry repeated. They wouldn’t; surely Ron was proof of that. It wasn’t going to happen. Harry ran a hand through his hair and changed the subject. “What’re you working on?” he asked, gesturing to the drawer Draco had been bent over before.
When the shove on his right shoulder was repeated, Harry ignored it, but he suspected he wouldn’t get away with that for long. He was proven right as Malfoy tugged at the duvet around Harry and asked, “Do you kiss the nation’s babies with that mouth, Minister?”
Harry’s whine broke into a needy sob. The centre of his thoughts was becoming a mix of wanting to be fucked forever, wanting to come, and wanting to not disobey. Malfoy’s weight pinned him to the table, fingernails bit into his hips and the relentless cock battered his arse; a combination that made Harry feel safer and more desired than he had in years. This wasn’t wrong. Submission allowed Harry to exist within a position much more to his liking and was so bloody fucking
“I’ll give you the Apparation co-ordinates,” Draco offered helpfully. Although he inwardly squirmed, Harry didn’t object. Harry wasn’t the only one who needed to proceed using their own small steps.
want is for you to open your mouth, sit still, and take everything that I’m generously bestowing on you. Do you think you can be good enough to manage that
And with that, Draco diverted his attention to breakfast. He had happily handed the next move to Potter, just to see what he would do with it. At the moment, whatever Potter had planned did not seem to include the imminent removal of his hand from Draco’s body.
Thoughts becoming muddled, Harry shook himself out of it. He couldn’t sit here in indecisive pondering. That wasn’t going to get either of them shagged. And Draco was starting to look worried again. No, Harry couldn’t do…
. It was not his responsibility to lift Potter’s spirits; that was the task of Potter’s friends. People who were surely more practised in the art of cheerfulness or compassion than Draco could ever hope to be. It wasn’t Draco’s business if Potter wanted to wallow in a sea of self-pity, Draco had enough of his own to wallow in. Also, much as Draco detested admitting any shortcomings, he had no idea how to pull Potter from his depression, and more importantly, didn’t know why he even felt compelled to.
“Potter… stop,” Draco mumbled against Potter’s tongue. Busy with the task of melting Draco’s brain and thickening Draco’s cock, Potter didn’t appear to have heard. “
“You’ve never been interested in me like that before. You’re just taking the piss,” Harry scoffed, trying to sound more confident than he felt.
“If you’re sure,” Draco said as he brought the Puff briefly to his cheek for a nuzzle, betraying his true intentions before he returned it to his pocket.
But as he heard a voice from along the corridor a short distance away, he knew some things would never change. Resisting the urge to stride quickly in the opposite direction, Draco squared his shoulders, found what remained of his centre of superior indifference and stood where he was, waiting.
“No,” Harry lied. There wasn’t any point in revealing who it had been. Harry couldn’t imagine any way that would end well. And it didn’t matter. Harry had avoided him ever since.
“Yes, you do. Or you at least suspect.” Malfoy turned slightly towards Harry, very deliberately resting his knee against Harry’s thigh. “Do you want to give up control to someone else? To
be. It was never what any man had hoped for. He could usually be entertaining and erase the dissatisfaction from the eyes of his partners if they managed to manoeuvre him to where they wanted, but it tended to return quickly in the aftermath. And their discontent inevitably increased the next time that they had to push him back on top. Harry was dithering now, and if he hesitated too long like this, if he backed away… if he said no, then he could be made to do it anyway. It didn’t
. I went through this thing with a fine toothcomb before I compiled that paperwork, Potter. And I was looking
Of course. That’s what was really bothering Draco. While Harry had been occupied with creating his first wand in Ollivanders today, Draco had been finalising the sale of his family heritage. Harry had planned on asking about it, but Draco had made sure that Harry was distracted from the moment they’d arrived home. It’d probably been a deliberate action until Draco was ready to talk about it.
Draco’s deliverance came quickly, spurting over his and Harry’s stomachs and chests as Draco tensed and roared above him. Harry still loved that trademark roar. Assertive, strong,
Draco’s brow furrowed. Harry was a little frightened that this was when the mocking would begin, but Draco maintained his supportive embrace as he asked, “Why is that so hard to believe?”
His latest attempt at honesty had gone especially badly. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d thought it might be different. He’d frequently tried to shift positions of sex more in his favour, but men were either oblivious to his hints or obstinately ignoring them, Harry wasn’t sure which. They wanted to be under their Saviour, surrounded by his strength. Held in Harry’s care or moulded to his will. The few times that Harry had abandoned the concept of hinting and explained what he’d enjoy, the looks of sheer disappointment on his partners’ faces had soon prompted him to just fuck them and be done with it.
He considered what he was currently witnessing and attempted to view it through Draco’s eyes. Harry had blamed himself for the loss of Ron’s friendship and had left him in peace. But Ron… Ron hadn’t wanted to help Harry. Hadn’t cared to listen. And now, here was Ron after all these years… trying to persuade Harry to do something which Ron
“I arrested Michael this morning. He’s in custody. What you told Mum and Dad was the last straw. I’d been holding off… hoping I was wrong, not wanting to launch an investigation against a friend. But that was it, for me. I decided to take all of my suspicions into the department and find out if I was right. And I
“No, it wouldn’t,” Harry answered quickly. Too quickly maybe, judging by the suspicious narrowing of Draco’s eyes again. Everyone was far too bloody observant today. Harry tried to move them away from the topic. “But it’s not important. None of my business anymore who the Ministry hires. We’ve got better things to think about. Loads still to sort through in here.”
Harry had somehow managed to earn another kiss to his forehead. That was one of Harry’s favourite things, and he was sure Draco was aware.
“Hold this.” Luna thrust a light blue silk handkerchief into his left hand. “It belongs to Mr Plonkengarret.” At Harry’s questioning gaze, she added, “Personal belongings gather a little of their owner’s individual magical signatures. It helps to create something tailored to their needs.”
Harry felt a sudden sharp smack against his bare arse cheek under the covers, not particularly hard but it emphasised the point.
There was an alarming gap in the drapes around the bed, and a very red and astonished Weasley stood where thick fabric should’ve been.
Before Draco could roll onto his back again, Harry shifted himself forward onto his right side to bring his chest flush with Draco’s back, raising his left arm to wrap around Draco’s torso, suddenly wishing that they were wearing briefs. He tried not to let that deter him. It was often convenient that neither of them bothered with clothes in bed but in this instance, Harry felt safer keeping a narrow and deliberate distance between their lower bodies.
“I have nothing to be embarrassed about. My body is splendid, and my partner is well satisfied.” Forgoing underwear, Draco stepped into trousers which he’d retrieved from his own pile of clothing. Enthralled at the notion of Draco dangling loose in his trousers while entertaining company, even if it was just Ron, Harry couldn’t think of a reply. “You
want you to do anything out of some weird, warped sense of obligation, just because you’ve had your fingers up my arse. Believe me, the fingering was
Potter tentatively reached out towards Draco’s arm. It wasn’t a quick movement, Draco had plenty of time to retreat, but instead he stood motionless and allowed Potter to grasp his wrist, peeling it away from Draco’s chest.
Potter didn’t dawdle this time. The back of Draco’s head had barely hit the pillow before Potter’s lips wrapped around the tip of Draco’s cock, moving downwards with shocking rapidity.
Too impatient to bother with preparation after their aborted session earlier, Harry closed his eyes and tried to recreate a previous magical accident.
“Potter,” he started, but a particularly nice tongue-probe broke his concentration again. It seemed that Potter hadn’t moved far at all.
That’d been a typical act of Malfoy retaliation; Draco had evidently not forgotten the sight of Ron’s tongue either.
Potter had done what the world had asked him to: killed a Dark Lord, especially for them. But changing the world was a task beyond even Potter. Draco suspected that the knowledge had hit him hard. Perhaps Potter hadn’t
This wasn’t the school that Draco had once known. So many things were different after the rebuild. The classrooms were overly organised, the corridors smelt of sterility and the eyes of many of the students were a little bit darker than before. It seemed that the atmosphere had irreparably altered Hogwarts into an unfamiliar world which would prefer that Draco was nowhere near it.
For horribly long seconds, Potter didn’t answer. Fighting his growing panic, Draco tried to utilise logic and recall if he knew a resuscitating spell. And whether it was wise to move someone who was unconscious. It’d been a short fall, but harm could’ve been done. Potter could have a concussion; he could’ve broken his
ask Draco to do something he didn’t want to. And he didn’t want Draco to agree just to please Harry.
but not regarding the issue of a possible career for Draco. Harry’s mouth had gone dry though. And it was becoming difficult to swallow. He closed his eyes, inwardly battling to force the memory away before it could consume his thoughts.
Luna blinked owlishly at him. “Need? I don’t need anything, Harry. But like I said, I do have a question. But I’m being rude. Would you like to ask yours first?”
The upright stance of Draco’s penis seemed keen to do otherwise. And Harry didn’t want to fail it. Or the rest of the man it was attached to. Due to his conflict, Harry’s own cock had lost its rampant eagerness but amazingly to Harry, it was far from down.
“No,” Harry exhaled, worried that he might’ve overstepped in his enthusiasm. “I’m not any of your concern.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco snapped. “But when… when you realise that I’m not a good person. Or good enough for
Harry was comprehending many things about himself. “I understand that it’s not my decision whether or not you fuck me. Or… use me in any way.”
“St Mungo’s,” Potter answered bluntly. “Mind Healers. Medical folk. My friends. Teachers. Snape.” Potter scoffed before he added, “Hermione.”
“Yes. I’ll stay here for as long as you want me to.” And it was true; Harry couldn’t think of anywhere better to be.
Shit. Maybe Harry should’ve put less effort into that. If he’d been rubbish, Draco would likely have just hugged him supportively and neither of them would’ve needed to mention it ever again.
‘Iffy’ could mean a lot of things with Luna. Anything from a miniscule, almost undetectable delay with the magic travelling through a wand to accidentally blowing up a shed.
“Yup. Still need to listen to her though,” Harry yawned, tangling his legs with Malfoy’s, getting comfortable. “I’ll sort it out. Then I’ll get to the rest. I always do.”
But the quiet stalking was much preferable to the times when Potter decided to talk to him. Ignoring Potter outwith the strict requirements of the sponsorship continued to be ineffective as a deterrent. Insults, as much as Draco dared, didn’t work either. In fact, Draco’s well-crafted invectives only spurred Potter on. Despite Draco’s refusals, Potter continued to invite him for meals, requested study time together, offered Draco sweets and chocolates, and strolled alongside him in the corridors, conducting spontaneous bouts of chattering along the way.
Draco couldn’t find the words. It’d all seemed so clear while he was chasing after Potter, but now… now it was becoming complicated again.
Draco had recently been taking too many valuable cues from Ron’s effectively blunt methods of dealing with Harry’s lingering guilt. But Harry reluctantly acknowledged that might be a good thing.
All Draco was obliged to do was give the Ministry this one year of co-operation, then his official penance would be served, and he could go. Back to his father. Draco didn’t even know why he was bothering, except that pesky reality of having no alternative. A year’s reprieve from his father was better than nothing.
Potter’s shoulder visibly stiffened. “If I’m going to put your cock in my mouth, then you’ll call me Harry.”
to play; the rest of Harry was still reeling from this abrupt turn of events and didn’t quite know what it wanted. Predictably, his cock won out. Harry nodded, and Draco settled himself comfortably back against the chair.
“It was entirely my pleasure, Potter. Look at me.” As Harry raised his head, he saw Malfoy gesturing in an upward motion. “Kneel up higher.”
Fuming, Harry turned and strode around his desk towards the door which connected his office to the corridor. He arrived within a few long, incensed paces and threw it wide open to hit the wall.
“So…” Harry started, unsure where his sentence was going. “I think… we have some stuff to talk about. If you want to,” he directed at Ron.
. But,” Malfoy paused again, longer this time. “But I’m thinking that there must be a reason why that specific… position, action, whatever… is a hard no for you. I understand about preferences, but the
“You didn’t see the light?” Harry asked, bewildered as to why he kept seeing things that no-one else could. It was disconcerting.
Shaking his head, Harry took a step back, folded his arms over his chest and contemplated the use of a silencing charm. Harry would’ve felt much more sympathetic if he hadn’t repeatedly warned Ron about touching
Potter sucked in his bottom lip, and Draco mourned his beautiful plan. Draco’s own lips were still too wet from the kiss to think clearly, and Potter’s alarmingly appealing rumpledness wasn’t helping to alleviate Draco’s confusion. Torn between the urge to pick up from where he’d stopped them and the impulse to scream in frustration, Draco managed to reason that the sensible option would be to leave. Or at least shag Potter into the mattress and
He received a full-blown laugh from Draco for that, even if it had a desperate edge to it. But a dullness soon fell over Draco’s eyes again.
“Yes,” nodded Malfoy, crossing his arms over his puffed-out chest. “And it’s not like you need the money either. I could leave you to it though. Am I to presume that you no longer require my services?”
He needed Draco. Needed the security that Malfoy’s presence provided during times like this. But Harry didn’t want to be reliant on another person to steady him; he should be able to do it
“The lack of his wand,” Ron added, “posed a challenge for proving his casting of the curse. Although it did make it
to have his own cock sucked. And he was beginning to feel confident that Draco could achieve that for him.
“For fucks sake, Senior Auror Weasley… you need a ruddy minder. It’ll let you go by itself shortly.”
Draco wasn’t buying that; the heat in this room was stifling. But it wouldn’t likely benefit him to point out that fact, so instead he asked, “Don’t you have blankets over there? And a
Choosing Malfoy as a sexual partner could be a disaster, but Harry had tried sex with people he liked, it wasn’t working out. Maybe it was time for a different approach. And he’d known for a while that he liked Malfoy at least a little. A
He was apparently not in the correct place. “Kneel here.” Malfoy pointed to the floor immediately to the right side of his legs. Harry corrected his location.
The reason for the disturbance of his well-earned slumber was quickly revealed when something roughly shoved Harry forwards and a voice instructed from behind him, “Wake up.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Good. Umm… I’d prefer if you didn’t tell him any of it in the future though. It’s
He clenched and released the inner muscles of his rectum, becoming accustomed to the foreign object inside him. The vibrator didn’t have a narrow neck for his rim to contract and wrap around to prevent its exit like the plug which Harry was still fond of, but it wasn’t sliding out. It firmly remained exactly where Draco had left it. The charm, Harry realised, might be keeping it secure.
“Okay, but if you regret this, don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Draco fell into step beside Potter but stopped short after a few paces. “Wait… Granger told you to come out here?” Potter nodded. Draco suddenly had a vision of a hoard of Gryffindors lying in wait for their return. “Why?”
That was not going to brighten his upcoming day. His father could be vicious with the written word, artfully beating Draco down from hundreds of miles away.
With the absence of further distractions, Harry quickly conducted his requirements in the bathroom. When he wandered back into the bedroom with a towel slung low over his hips, it was obvious that Draco hadn’t heeded his own advice about sleeping.
Harry laughed as he re-joined Draco in bed. Or rather, as he was yanked back under the duvet and tucked into Draco’s chest. Reflecting on how quickly Draco could pull him out of a slump, he considered that he may be overthinking his issues, complicated though they were.
At least Ron’s unexpected casual comradery had resulted in a shocked and speechless Draco, rather than one about to commence a rampage. And Harry wasn’t fairing much better with speech.
Harry bowed his head, dropped his gaze to the rug underneath him and tried to ignore the sudden urge to cry. This whole day had gone to
Their descent back to the floor seemed the natural thing to do as Harry tugged Malfoy down with him, kissing as they moved. Hands still fervently staking their claim, Harry kept their chests flush as he shifted to lie on his back. He spread his legs wide and Malfoy slotted into the gap, settling weight upon Harry, pressing him into the floor.
then consequently by fear, he could’ve prevented so much misery. Not just to himself, but to Ron who Harry’s cowardice might’ve allowed Michael to manipulate. To the rest of the Weasleys who’d believed they could trust Michael. To Draco, who by extension of being with Harry felt obliged to deal with Harry’s pathetic shit. And to countless other people who Harry would probably never know how much his inaction had inadvertently harmed. If Harry could’ve been who Michael had
Harry stormed into his office, taking pleasure in swinging the door shut behind him and the resounding thud as it slammed back into the frame. He hoped it’d cracked the wood. Striding forward, he walked quickly around his desk, eyes searching for the file required for the next item on his never-ending agenda.
“I’m not going to be… fun. You’ll get sick of being around me,” Potter sighed. “And you don’t need to… as long as we keep doing the meetings thing until the end of the year, just for… appearances. You’re not under any other obligation.”
But all of Harry’s insecurities weren’t going to vanish. “It’s… not right. Oliver said… others haven’t liked -”
So was Harry. He couldn’t believe it, but Harry was going to come on Draco’s arse and Draco was going to come in Harry’s fist, and Harry had done this of his own accord without any sign of manipulation.
Draco’s bout of uncharacteristic, spontaneous heroism changed things in both disturbing and surprising ways during the following week, word of his actions spreading like wildfire throughout the school.
. Like the other box in the sense that it would passively gather information, but he didn’t think that it’d give back whatever it collected.
Even within this context, Malfoy was going to set rules. It astounded Harry sometimes, just how much he loved this man.
. And steadily warming to his body temperature. He altered the angle of his spine, just enough to test the object without being accused of changing his position. The softness of Harry’s body flexed but unsurprisingly the glass offered no yield. It was a solid invader, stretching Harry to his limits, but placid in its presence.
It quickly became a pitiful performance of stamina from Harry. Lost in the rhythm, Harry dimly realised that not only was he not attempting to withhold his orgasm, for once no restraint had been demanded of him. Malfoy's hands were in Harry’s hair, not gripping, but almost caressing the strands as he kissed Harry and they both rocked towards completion.
Harry should leave people in peace. In trying to be honest, he’d imploded a part of Molly and Arthur’s life. They’d been happier before Harry had told them the truth. And if Harry went away, then Draco could find someone who wasn’t so irreparably broken. Someone worth the bother. Someone who could express a sentiment as simple as the fact that they loved him. Someone who was better than -”
“Time to go,” announced Draco. “Maybe we could continue… this,” he leant in to brush his bottom lip with Harry’s, “in private.”
that, Draco. I… I…” Even now, when Harry felt that the declaration was essential, he couldn’t spit it out. Harry wanted to tell Draco how much he loved him, but the word got caught in his throat. “…care about you,” Harry finished lamely, feeling like a failure when Draco needed him most.
The pressure was certainly building, but slowly, slowly. Harry suspected that just the right words from Draco would bring him over the edge, but Draco remained silent except for his deepening breaths.
Draco didn’t slow his pace until he’d descended the preposterously excessive number of stairs and reached the main door to the castle. He stood just inside the large open doorway, panting slightly from exertion and irritation but resolutely looking forward, watching rolling grey clouds as he waited again.
“You’re clearly listening too closely to me,” chortled Draco. There was scarce humour in that sound, but it
Registering Malfoy’s expression, Harry froze. Malfoy was still seated, his mouth open but emitting no sound. And his eyes were wider than Harry thought he'd ever seen them.
upset. Or disappointed. This wasn’t affection, it was something else. Draco just hadn’t figured it out yet.

about you. If your job hadn’t been so publicly visible, if we hadn’t been able to see that you weren’t hurt, we would’ve been more insistent. But… I suppose we
Harry raised his head. Draco was smiling. There was not a trace of the sneer or smirk that Harry adored, nor any hint of mocking. What Harry saw was a sort of tender, open supportiveness. Curious expectation, perhaps. And all Harry could manage in return was to blink upwards in befuddled awe at how rapidly Malfoy’s demeanour had changed.
if it’d be okay for Draco. Since the beginning of their relationship, it’d been understood that Harry was a bottom and Draco was a top. What if Draco
Potter took his time, clearly contemplating his reply. When it came, it was shocking in its effectiveness. “I think you’d like me to fuck you, Malfoy.”
Harry wasn’t involved in the business though. He was content to leave George to it. And to refuse any repayment. “I’m just a silent partner.”
Bringing the wood closer to his face so he could better examine it, Harry silently acquiesced that it did look dry. But it didn’t
will ever be Master of you.” Harry watched as Draco removed his briefs, the last remaining garment, and crawled back onto the bed. Draco smiled. “But we have more fun things to be thinking about just now.”
As his embarrassment threatened to return, Harry buried his face into Draco’s neck. Exhausted, Harry was content to hide, resting his torso on the rise and fall of Draco’s chest. He would dearly love to avoid the uncomfortable conversation he predicted might be coming.
Draco could feel Potter stirring lazily, beginning to wake. Draco helped the stirring along by stabbing an elbow into Potter’s ribs, and Potter shifted away enough for Draco to roll onto his back. The look on Potter’s face when he woke sufficiently to register the situation would’ve been more comical if Draco hadn’t been involved.
Watching Harry with wary eyes, Ron spoke again. “And I’ve been wanting to ask you something. It’s… important. About the Head of MLE position. We think it’s going not too badly, but the other applicants might be more… favoured than Michael.”
Harry couldn’t remember how he’d managed to repel that boggart. Afterwards, he’d recognized that it hadn’t portrayed the way the real event had happened. Harry had
Not that Harry had any desire to go anywhere else at this moment. Instead, he was happy to watch as Draco lovingly tended to the beautiful monstrosity which Harry hoped would be very shortly shoved up his arse.
Harry took a breath, about to try reassuring words, when Draco slid his left hand lower, gripped Harry’s buttock and yanked him closer, pressing their groins together at what felt like the same moment that Draco’s other hand sank into Harry’s hair, claiming a fistful of strands at the back of his head.
“More of an old one,” she said. “I hadn’t seen a lot of him for a while either. He’s been busy as well. All my friends… busy, busy, busy,” she teased. “But it’s been good. Sometimes I think we’re utterly incompatible, but he makes the effort worth it. He can do a wicked thing with his… but you don’t want to hear about the intimate details,” she laughed.
Still worried, but attempting honesty as requested, Harry answered, “I want to be taken care of by you.”
“Did you even bring your books?” Draco asked, pointedly eyeing Potter’s empty arms while hoping that Potter wouldn’t burst a blood vessel. Or perhaps hoping that he would.
. Everything Harry had always longed for in a lover. The sound of it nearly tipped Harry over the edge, but he bit down harder and held it back through sheer force of will. He absently wondered if his lip was bleeding.
Beginning to shake with the exertion he was expending, sweat ran down from his hairline and forehead into his eyes. Harry was praying that Malfoy’s excitement might cause him to lose count when Malfoy shuddered beneath him, a loud groan signalling Harry’s success.
The flame that was Harry’s face intensified. It wasn’t helping his level of mortification that his erection’s efforts to escape his jeans had also increased substantially.
Harry couldn’t recall any incident of Ron trying to talk to him since Harry’s failed attempt at telling Ron about Michael.
Again, Malfoy didn’t seem to be in a hurry. The waiting was unbearable. Malfoy’s hand wasn’t resting on Harry’s bum, and not being able to see when the smack was coming made it impossible to properly prepare for it.
“Yes,” Harry nodded, rising and grabbing his robe from the hook behind him. Malfoy had donned his own, strode into Harry’s office and was waiting expectantly outside in the corridor, having given Oliver a shunt out of the way in the process. Harry had always admired how fast the git could move. “Gotta go.”
It was hours later when Harry wandered into the hall on his way to the toilet. He had a foot on the bottom rung of the stairs when he heard the front door open behind him.
strategy, and vaguely wondered what had happened to it. He needed to get back on track, he couldn’t do this if he wasn’t properly in control of the situation, he wanted so
to do that, and now someone was being punished for his shortcomings. Harry was the one who should’ve been punished. The contents of the letter had made it explicitly clear that if Harry had just listened, done what he was
“Two… thank you,” Harry gasped out as his arse cheeks began to burn with the sting. He was sure their colour would soon more than rival the blush of mortification emanating from his face.
that. Draco had clearly not been snogging the right people. Not that he’d been snogging anyone for a while.
Harry immersed himself within the sounds and the rhythm of his breathing until the buzzing sensation on his skin began to gradually diminish.
“I’m fine, Draco. It takes more than that to break me,” replied Potter, beginning to re-install himself into the bed.
As they stood together, watching each other in silence, palm to palm, Harry gradually let himself accept Draco’s anger for the concern that it truly was. And a part of him began to doubt if he’d
Malfoy spoke softly, as if he was trying to soothe a wild animal before it attacked. “You don't seem in a particularly submissive mindset right now.”
“Maybe I’m rushing things with the ramming. Don’t fret, we can work up to that another time. But if we’re going to do this, then I’m at least expecting a hand job.”
As if Draco needed the reminder. He was past Potter and halfway up the stairs towards the dormitory before he deigned to reply. “No, I
“Bugger yourself,” directed Draco. “And, fuck it all… yes… rub yourself off on the table if you want to. I’d like to watch that.”
Harry clasped his hands together upon the mattress above his head. Once he’d craned his neck back to fix his gaze on the wooden headboard, he no longer had a clear view of Malfoy. But the bed between his legs dipped promisingly.
Harry didn’t know how long it took him to feel calmer, but he let himself rest his head on soft, warm fabric and concentrated on the man holding him as his breaths slowly regulated to match the rise and fall of Draco’s chest.
“I’m clearly going to need to try harder.” Draco rose from the chair and moved to stand beside the bed, tantalisingly close to Harry. “Hmm… let’s see.”
Draco sat curled in the corner of an annoyingly squashy chair in the darkest corner of the Gryffindor common room. He would’ve preferred to study in the peace of the dormitory, hidden behind the curtains of his bed, but experience had taught him that squirreling himself away only provoked Potter to come and fetch him. Consequently, Draco had eventually consented to working amid the pack, and attempted to block out the rabble around him.
But if the programme wasn’t the Ministry’s… another possible truth occurred to Draco. He wasn’t sure whether to ask. If it was true, then it might be foolhardy to voice it. But Draco had been doing a lot of foolish things lately. And he
“It’s… not my favourite,” Harry settled on instead of the litany of other less polite descriptions that came to mind.
“Open your mouth and take me in,” Malfoy instructed. “Just let my cock lie on your tongue.” Harry parted his lips to encase Malfoy’s spent cock in the wetness of his mouth, not sucking, aware that he had strangely not been instructed to do that. Careful not to let his teeth graze the flesh, he relaxed into this different sense of reassuring fullness. Harry breathed through his nose, inhaling Malfoy’s musky scent and resting calmly with the soft mouthful, the slight pressure of balls against his chin and wiry hair tickling his skin.
Harry could use some himself. He scanned the menu, made a selection and soon both Hermione and he were sipping frothy and creamy coffee concoctions which Draco would’ve declared to be sacrilegious.
“This is nice,” he commented, examining the carved wooden surface of the handsome bureau as he ignored Lucius’ barrage of colourful insults and the echoing knocks as Lucius attempted to use the cane to batter his way out of the frame. Harry was no expert, but the bureau might be mahogany.
“To mock me?” Draco gritted through his clenched teeth. “Of course, it would. Fabulously entertaining.”
Harry used the time following Draco’s orgasm to attempt to regather himself, listening to Draco’s panting breaths and trying to ignore the ever-shimmying presence in his arse. The spunk spreading wetly on his skin wasn’t helping. He wanted to see it, run his fingers through it,
“Okay,” Draco whispered. Harry raised his hips to distract Draco from his needless concern. As he felt an answering press, it seemed to have worked.
“The Mark I saw on Snape’s arm… and on other Death Eaters, was darker, more pronounced. Blacker. Even after Voldemort was dead.” Potter peered closer. “Yours seems lighter… greyer.”
of her smiles, “Ooh… white spontaneously erupting from the tip of a rigid shaft. The nargles tell me that Draco will be fond of that one. I wonder if all the wands in your loving care will respond so positively.”
Nearly a week later, Harry peered into the large window in front of him, amused by the child-sized handprints on the glass near the bottom. After about half an hour of listening to Draco and the shopkeeper with the unpronounceable name barter over prices of not only fifty-four inkwells but also a wide assortment of other stationary items which weren’t holding Harry’s attention, Harry had reached his limit of patience. He would’ve been content to browse inside, but the aroma within the shop was overwhelming; how Draco could stand so proudly and pretend he didn’t smell it was a mystery to Harry. Seeking fresh air but assuring Draco that he didn’t need to rush, Harry had wandered outside to peruse the window display.
Pulling open the appropriate drawer within the cabinet, Harry shuffled to the side to make room for Luna.
restrictions on his life. It wouldn’t be enough to be back under his father’s control, the Ministry would do its best to suck the rest of the will to live out of him.
Biting his lip, Harry tried to stifle his moans. Had he been ordered into silence? He couldn’t remember anymore. He knew he wasn’t supposed to
“Did you… tell them?” Harry whispered. Harry had wanted to himself but telling Molly and Arthur had been… difficult. Maybe the most difficult task he’d ever undertaken, so he’d accepted Molly’s offer to inform the rest of the family and Hermione. He’d been so ashamed to admit what he’d allowed Michael to do when Harry had let him down so badly, and how afterwards Harry had hidden from everything surrounding Michael.
this was an open invitation to come whenever he liked, but it was presented in a world of constant comfort with no change of pace, pressure or angle. Just this continuous rock and slide.
Thankfully, furniture was not Harry’s only partner. Draco’s arms came to the rescue, encircling Harry from behind and ceasing his fall. Appreciative of the assistance, Harry allowed Draco to tug him back upright onto both feet. Once Harry was more stable, he turned around to face Draco.
,” Draco continued. “I felt… close to you.” A faint blush was blooming on Draco’s cheeks. “I’m glad I could do that. Glad that you
“Good to see that your batty boss gives you the weekends off, Harry,” said Ron from directly across the table. Hermione sat to Ron’s left, Draco to Harry’s right, all cradling their chosen doses of caffeine while they waited for their food to arrive.
When their lips parted, Harry rested his head in the nook of Malfoy's neck and inhaled the scent that had come to mean ‘home' to him far more than the building they were currently within. He’d been a fool to refuse himself the discovery of what Malfoy could be to him for so long. But he often also debated what Malfoy saw in
you,” Draco said, and then tried to tone down the hideous admission with, “Sometimes… when you’re not being such an
During his mini rant, Potter had moved to stand very close, perhaps a foot away. It struck Draco that he hadn’t previously appreciated how transparent white shirts became when wet.
Harry smelled burning and realised that Draco had set the lower left corner of the frame on fire. Lucius frantically grabbed the artist’s impression of a vase which usually sat on a shelf towards the right side of the scene, roughly extracted the flowers, and attempted to pour painted water over the flames. As if
Satisfied that no harm had occurred, Harry waved his hand at the box. Immediately, the blue light vanished.
Draco briefly closed his eyes, and the flames were extinguished with a flick of Draco’s wand. And at Draco’s nod, Harry lifted his hand, intending to shut the portrait up.
When Malfoy’s bare feet eventually lowered from the mattress to the carpet in front of Harry, he kept his head lowered and watched their progress as they walked over to the comfy armchair that Harry kept in the corner of his bedroom. From Harry’s vantage point, he could just still spy the feet in his peripheral vision. It seemed that Malfoy had sat on the front edge of the seat cushion.
The confused look on Malfoy’s face indicated that he didn’t quite know what to do with Harry’s new approach to the concept of sexual submission.
Letting out a long breath against Draco’s neck, Harry rocked his hips again. Back and forward, reassuring himself that he could cease at any time if he didn’t like it. Draco wouldn’t force him to continue; Harry was almost sure of that. No, Harry was
But humiliation didn’t dampen Harry’s arousal, it was the fuel that intensified it. Rock hard between Malfoy’s thighs, he panted towards the floor as he steeled himself for the next strike.
Draco replaced his hands on Harry’s hips and tugged lightly, encouraging him to walk forward and straddle Draco’s thighs. As always, when presented with an apparent suggestion that he was being manoeuvred into a position which suggested that he take control, Harry hesitated. But Draco didn’t allow him to worry.
“It is, for most people.” Draco might not be revelling in happiness, but the general masses were. “And obviously for you.”
important was the way that Malfoy had expertly lined up their erections, enabling the rough glide of hardness against hardness. It was essential to note how the intensity of their kiss hadn’t waned. It was
“That’s nice for you,” Harry replied, inwardly cringing at the sarcasm in his reply. He’d been working with Malfoy for too long if he was starting to adopt the bastard’s tone.
“Umm,” Malfoy began, but immediately quietened. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy anxiously bite his bottom lip before. He usually looked more assured, even when he was wrong. That was worrying. After a long interval of lip gnawing, Malfoy said, “I’m… not sure if I should ask this.”
The large painting high on the wall in front of Harry was an artist’s depiction of the same room in which Harry currently stood. Lucius was seated behind the desk, leaning back in the leather chair, hands clasped over his chest and looking down his nose at Harry in that special
Potter was bluffing, that had to be it. It wasn’t possible to be as inexperienced as Potter had previously portrayed and provide that performance. But that was fine, Draco’s bluffing skills were surpassed by none.
to be anything more. Pitiful. All you desire is to stay wherever I put you and take my cock like the whore you are.”
After too long spent staring in silence, Potter enquired, “So, do I need to ask what you did last night?”
“And one of your pensioners…” continued Draco, “The one with the squirrel on her hat, she owns a racing broom company and she’s looking for a Product Tester. She keeps asking me. Very persistent. I don’t trust that one though… I think she might be attempting to dispose of me in a tragic flying accident and leave the path clear to you.”
If the snarl was an accurate indication, Potter was unimpressed. “Just because you want it, doesn’t mean you can have it. You told me that as well.”
Gnawing his bottom lip between his teeth, Harry frowned at the worktable and tried to pretend that he was more competent than he felt.
“Umm, I don’t think… that is, I mean.” Potter looked appalled. “Ram your? I - I mean, of course I have. I just don’t know -”
Harry, and afraid that Draco would tell them the truth. But, Harry tried to rationalise, Draco wouldn’t do that. “Do you… want to go?”
Harry was willing to bet that Malfoy knew how to roar. But that was not a thought for sane people to consider. As he opened his mouth to respond, he inhaled the scent of a familiar cologne. Oh.
Harry’s whole body was soon trembling with both the physical effort of his motions and the will not to climax, and although Malfoy’s commentary was quieting as his breaths became louder, he showed no sign of an imminent orgasm even after Harry had been thrusting for a while.
The incredulous expression on Malfoy’s face was almost amusing. If Harry didn’t feel so much like crying.
Realising that he was standing partially in front of the entrance, Draco stepped to the side, mystified as to why Snape couldn’t have used the three-quarters of unblocked doorway. As Draco moved, Potter’s eyes met Snape’s and it might have been a product of Draco’s imagination, but something… some unspoken understanding seemed to pass between them. A silent exchange which lowered Snape’s scowl to a deeper glower. Draco steeled himself for a confrontation, but with an accentuated flick of his robes, Snape passed them to enter the Hall.
you, Draco. But shift,” Harry lifted a leg to nudge Draco with his foot. “I want some room to get naked.” In truth, Harry didn’t want to wait for Draco to undress him in case he had too much time to lose his nerve.
needed a rest? Harry was sore and exhausted, and probably had to get ready soon to run a ruddy country.
on someone as lovely and innocent as Luna and the brutal retribution he would seek for her, until he realised that not having a wand would likely prohibit Michael from doing that. But still…
“I’m admitting to nothing,” Malfoy replied. After a few moments of silence, he asked in a voice that sounded tentative, “Are you really complaining?”
“Mum would still like the sugar, if either of you have a hand spare,” commented Ron, brushing a smudge of flour off his red Auror robe with one hand and pointing to the shelf beside Harry’s shoulder with the other.
Standing alone by the door to the Great Hall, Draco debated how much longer he should wait. The dinner rabble had dwindled to an occasional trickle of departing, sated students, but as he scanned the corridor yet again, there was still no sign of an approaching Potter. Draco was unfailingly punctual; therefore, he was certain that he hadn’t missed his sponsor entering the Hall. And he was equally positive that Potter wouldn’t have gone in without adhering to his responsibility first, but Draco examined the interior to be sure. No Potter.
Harry arrived in a room which he thought might be on the second floor of Malfoy Manor. Draco stood about six feet away and looked like he’d been inspecting the contents of a drawer before the pop of Harry’s Apparation had startled him.
coerced. Although I am… without clothing within a building where all the wardrobes and their contents have been removed.”
Oliver was not looking deterred by Harry’s rejection. He was a pleasant bloke, but that was the trouble. Unwilling to sound overly hospitable, Harry waited for Oliver to explain the reason for infiltrating his space.
Malfoy tutted. “You’re looking far too chuffed with yourself.” Harry attempted to appear less eager. “I’ve changed my mind. Here, have your pillow back.”
As requested, Draco didn’t come any closer. Instead, he took two careful steps away. Harry felt guilty about that too.
“I met them,” Draco said simply. “Properly, I mean. Without my parents relentlessly informing me about all the many unjustified reasons why I shouldn’t associate with that kind of person. They’re nice. Molly Weasley makes fantastic lemon cake. Anyone who makes cake of that quality and allows me to eat two slices
Interesting. If Draco was careful, this might be useful. It hadn’t occurred to Draco that Potter could be gay. Draco himself was unashamedly so, but he hadn’t seen any indication of that preference from Potter. Maybe Potter hadn’t fully explored the possibility himself. Now,
Solving this problem wouldn’t mean that Draco cared; it would merely indicate that he wanted to be comfortable in his surroundings. And actually remain in them. Of course, the notion of ever being completely at ease within this dysfunctional pack was probably expecting too much, but it didn’t mean that Draco couldn’t try.
until Draco latched his teeth onto Harry’s neck, growled low vibrations against the skin there, and emptied himself into Harry’s arse with a shudder.
," Harry said, the admission painful but necessary. “Scared of disappointing people, scared of them finding out what kind of person I was, scared of not being good enough because
He landed hard on his face amongst a pile of papers, quills and the wood that had been his desk. And the stupid marble quill holder was now digging into his ribs.
Malfoy leaned across the back of his chair slightly, mouth curving in what he might’ve hoped was a placating smile. It didn’t placate Harry. “We need to have a chat about this, Ha – Potter. We could -”
But Draco was intrigued by the sudden reintroduction of chatty Potter, so he resisted the urge to disturb the flow of conversation with an accusation. “What weird thing?”
Harry gasped, twitching in the motionless grasp. If Draco kept saying that, Harry was going to come before he’d heard the rules, friction or not. And Harry was now far too curious to want to miss out.
Harry watched as Draco walked back towards the bed. When Draco reached the edge of the mattress, he extended a hand which Harry couldn’t see the destination of, but it became clear when the toy inside him halted its thrusts after an in stroke, then slowly rotated. Harry shuddered, breathing deep through his barely controlled lust.
. Draco might’ve been right; this might not be what Harry needed. Not in this precise moment, anyway. But Harry didn’t
“Umm… connected,” he mumbled, embarrassed at how lame that sounded. “It feels… strong. And ermm… balanced, somehow?”
“I know.” Harry stepped away from Malfoy, raising his chin in defiance of the memories. “But it’s only a house, right? I’m not going to back down from it.”
Michael looked like he was battling to find the right response. Draco looked like he was battling not to stomp Michael’s face into the ground.
Harry rolled his eyes before bestowing the portrait with his own wave. Draco wasn’t so skilled at pretending that Harry couldn’t see through the cracks in his defences. But Harry was hardly one to judge about having defences.
Standing behind the counter with his back to the entrance, Harry groaned quietly when the bell above the door jangled cheerily. Urgh. Although he loved his job, Harry was approaching his limit of amiable helpfulness today. Fixing a welcoming smile on his face, he turned in the direction of the noise, and the smile became a genuine grin as he recognised the man sauntering towards him.
Potter preceded the question with what was apparently meant to be a hopeful, amiable smile. “Are you coming in for breakfast? You could sit with us.”
The thrill was steadily building as Harry waited for Malfoy to acknowledge him. Harry was currently alone; fully dressed, head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. He hadn’t been touched, but the subservience had already caused his cock to harden in his jeans.
“Potter, we need to go.” Harry jumped a little as the scrape of a chair against floor accompanied Malfoy’s sudden rising from his seat.
“I do like him. He’s fun. But… we’re not,” Harry’s voice reduced to a mumble as he continued, “compatible.”
from me. Money that he made me believe that I’d paid my taxes with, so I wouldn’t miss it. I mean… what the
The tone brooked no argument. Draco knew Harry well enough to be aware of his limits, but Harry suspected that he was often concerned that Harry wouldn’t speak up when he needed to.
Crafty bugger. Harry involuntarily huffed out a tiny laugh. Only Draco could turn dominance and submission into an impromptu therapy session. And valuable though that lesson possibly was, Harry hoped it wasn’t all he was getting today.
Ron sighed again. “I know. Whenever you did… it was like the irrational anger surged up again. Then, afterwards… I’d calm down, feel terrible about how I’d treated you and try to speak to you again… then I’d be… convinced that I
Harry hadn’t been staring at anything. Well, not for long. Probably. He grumbled an inarticulate reply, lowered his head over his pretence of work and thought back to the real issue at hand: he didn’t want to be in charge. Not in the bedroom, anyway. Or on the floor, on a couch, over a table… there were so many lovely places where he could be not in control, but it really wasn’t working out for him.
“You know that I only worked with you because I liked the decoration in your office, Harry. I’ve told you that before.”
But this morning, Potter wasn’t moving away to enter the Hall when his prattle ended. Instead, he was hovering, as if an awkward question was imminent. Draco steeled himself.
Harry wondered if it was a bad thing that he was still viewing this act as a technical process. He supposed he’d developed the attitude over the years as a defence mechanism. Or a coping strategy, perhaps. Whatever the difference was. But the intended outcome had always been the same: get it done. And do it
talented at that curse, Harry. He leaves… lingering impressions in people’s minds. I… know that’s a lot to believe, but I have proof now.”
“And I know you won't want to hear this,” Draco paused and visibly swallowed, and Harry knew what his suggestion would be before he spoke it. “But I think it would help if you told Granger. Or the rest of the Weasleys. They’re your family. They won’t all reject you, they’d want to know why -”
Released from Malfoy’s hold on his cock, Harry raised his torso as much as his tired muscles would allow and elected to shakily slide backwards over Malfoy’s legs until his knees reached the carpet. Belatedly, Harry noted that this manoeuvre left a trail of semen over Malfoy’s right leg. Inwardly cringing, he wondered if he was going to be in even more trouble for repeating much the same transgression as before. Not to mention the mess Harry could see dripping from between Malfoy’s thighs.
Quickly getting into a rhythm with the enjoyable and slightly ridiculous experience of table-humping, he realised that this wasn’t going to take long either.
Harry held his breath, anxiety rising as he thought of how intensely important the act of topping Draco had been to him. He still couldn’t quite believe that he’d voluntarily done that.
Draco was getting restless again. Harry could sense him not buying into any of this and itching to interject; Harry hoped he wouldn’t.
Harry felt his face grow cold. The sensation shivered down his arms, across his chest, all the way down to his toes. Fear, Harry recognised. He needed to move. Needed
“Quiet, whore,” Malfoy snarled, and Harry's entire body shuddered with the increased depth of his arousal.
“They are.” Harry batted his eyelids with false innocence. “Put your fluffy pink Puff somewhere it’ll be safe while you duel and debauch me with your undefeatable wand, Mr Malfoy. I need to feel the power of your magical wood.”
Hearing Luna describe the perilous problem which had plagued Harry as ‘the Voldemort thingy’ was refreshing enough to pull an unmanly giggle from him. But he tried to focus on the relevant topic.
And that was possibly also the reason why Hermione had been annoyed with him. Harry suddenly needed to
But Potter didn’t laugh. He sighed, a familiar sound which Draco was beginning to associate with him. “Yes, they do. I just asked them not to.”
