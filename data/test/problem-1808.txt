“I thought I was your favourite,” Harry said, nudging his knee.
Harry coughed on his breath.  “What?!”
He stepped out into the Atrium, taking a deep breath, and made his way towards to lifts, hoping to get to his office before his annoying office mate, Drumpkin, or better yet, Pansy.  He knew she could read him like a book and didn’t know if he could handle her analyzing him right now.  He managed to get a lift to himself and closed his eyes as he descended to his level.
“Fuck, Draco!”
Hermione, too, realised, and her eyes grew wide.  “Oh, Harry.  Really?”
“Hmmm…” Draco hummed.  “
Hermione gave him an appraising look, but the look that Ron gave him seemed to say ‘who are you and what have you done with Harry?’
“We didn’t know how much longer you two would be, and the natives were getting restless,” Draco said with a nod to Ted.  He had the decency to look sheepish.
“Who says Father Christmas is going to bring you a broom?”
Draco stopped mid-step, turning to look at her.  “Really?  Today?  But it’s already mid November!  I just figured they’d wait until next year, in order to get more publicising done.”
With his arms still wrapped around Draco, he leaned towards his boyfriend and kissed him.  “We are celebrating the fact that I told Kingsley and Robards that I refuse to go on anymore secret missions that take me away from you for more than a couple of days.”
“Yep, I think that’s right.  Andromeda and Ted will be at the Manor, too, right?”
As he made his way up the stairs, he heard voices coming from inside the tower.  Getting towards the top, he realized that it was Seamus, Dean, and Justin.  As soon as he walked in, they all stopped talking and looked directly at Harry.
“Nuh uh.  That’s mine.”  He grabbed Draco’s wrists, holding them above Draco’s head with one hand.
Draco smiled sadly as he wrapped his hand around Harry’s waist. Harry slowly ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, and waited patiently for Draco to continue.
“Agree to disagree.”
Draco moaned a muffled “Harry!” into his mouth.  He threw his head back, rutting up into Harry, as he screamed, “I’m coming!  I’m coming!  I’m co--!”  He thrust his hips off of the bed as he started coming, white stripes painting both of their chests.  “Oh my gods above!”
Narcissa smiled sadly, and then turned back to Harry.  He took that as his cue, and walked back out.  When they were on the steps headed toward the entryway, Draco whispered in his mother’s ear.
They stood there talking a bit more with Hagrid, but the snow was beginning to pick up more, so they said their goodbyes, and continued walking down the lane.
Draco stared up at the white ceiling, trying to remember what had caused him to be in the state that he found himself.
“Why don’t we make a day of it, then?”
After the war, while they were renovating the house, Harry had turned the old garden shed into a shed sort of like Arthur’s.  He would call the man over, and they would spend hours in that tiny room, playing with muggle items, giving both of them something else to think about for a time.
Prompt:
“Well, because we all thought you were?  You two were mighty close towards the end of term.  And, well, I saw the way he was playing with your hair during the game, on Thursday,” Ron said, cheeks flaming.
The look on Teddy’s face was priceless.  He looked around in wonderment and awe at all of the vendors and shops.  “Where’s the skating?”
“Wow.  I—I don’t know what to say.”
terms, so that he could reiterate over and over to Harry, and to himself, that he understood that it was
He smiled to himself at how upset Hermione and Ron were for him.  Just as Ron had said, if someone had told him 15 years ago that he would be best mates with Weasley and Granger, he would have had them shipped off the St. Mungo’s.  Now, though, spending time with them was as natural as breathing.  And he was so thankful for their friendship.
Draco cocked his head and thought about it.  “You’re right.  We will definitely have to change that.”
“You ready?” she asked him.
Harry began thrusting with abandon.  He could feel his release growing, and knew from the sounds coming from Draco, his was imminent, too.
Draco gave Harry a quick smirk before he moved up and captured Harry’s lips with his own.  Harry instantly reciprocated, pulling one hand up into Draco’s hair, moving the other down to cup his arse, causing their groins to smash together.  Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth.  Harry moved his hand up under Draco’s shirt, scratching lightly up and down the pale skin.  This caused Draco to moan even louder.
“Yes, well, I can look good doing about anything.  Holding a baby isn’t any different.  Anyway, what were you saying about tile?”
~*~*~*~*~
“And you said yes?”
“I…” Draco stared at Harry, mouth open as if he was going to say something, but after a few moments, he just closed his mouth, and, sighing, looked down at the floor.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
“He didn’t tell you?” Ron tilted his head in question.
“Is everything all right in here?” Harry cautiously asked the men.
“Great, you're together!  You will never believe what just happened,” he said loudly, receiving a ‘Shhh!’  from Madam Pince.  Quieter, he went on, “We were all sitting in the common room when all of a sudden, a Patronus came zooming into the room! It was Slughorn’s, saying that he was going to have to cancel our class for this afternoon, which means our weekend starts early! How brilliant is that?”
“Get a room, you two!”
Harry was laying in the middle of the bed, with his head facing the side closest to the door.
“No, holding
He only had to wait a second before her eyes widened larger than he had yet to see them.  “And you figured it out?”  She breathed the question.
Dun dun duuuuun!
They ripped apart, however, when they suddenly heard, “Harry?  What happened to the cheese pla—”
Wahoo!  Only a month-ish in between chapters!  I'm trying, people, I promise!
Harry internally rolled his eyes.  Was he that obvious?  Wait—of course he was.  Anymore, he ignored all of his friends, sitting glumly and avoiding conversation, until a certain blond walked in.  Then, he was animated, conversing with everyone, and having a grand time.
“No, we’re almost back to the resort,” he said, nodding towards the near distance, where they could see the stables where they had left from.
Harry gasped, before quietly moaning.  “Draco, we can’t.”
After over three years of being together, Harry knew exactly what to do to make this brilliant for them both.
The rest fell in line, hugging each other and saying congratulations, and then they one-by-one stepped into the floo.
He went up to his room, deciding to change his clothes.  It was still fairly early, so Harry pulled his book bag onto his bed and decided that in the quiet of his room, he should finish his Potions essay that was due the next day.
“You’d be surprised,” Draco said, giving her a look.
“Too right.  What time is it?  I’m ready for everyone to get here.  Where’s your ring?”
“Really?”
“That would be Mrs Walburga Black, your great aunt.”  Harry couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the blond’s face at that information.  “I wish I could get rid of her, believe me.  We’ve tried everything we can think of, to no avail.”
Not for the first time, he thought to himself,
Harry nodded and Draco carefully put the dragon back in the box and opened the other one.  He lifted the lid and smiled wide.  “The set.  They’re perfect together.”  He pulled out a stag, large antlers and one of the front paws raised as if it was pawing at the ground.
“I can barely move, I’m so full,” Draco whined, leaning into Harry as they made their way towards to shopping stores.
“We’ve since discovered that while we each can use our own wands, we can just as easily interchange and use each others.”
“No more than he has you.  That kid will never want for anything with us around, don’t you think?”
“I’m sure they’ve been holding some of them back from being published until we either broke up, or got engaged, whichever came first.”
“No, I’m eating breakfast!  Kreacher brought it to me.”  He pointed to the side table, which had a tray with juice, coffee, fruit, and bacon sandwiches.  Harry smiled as he walked over to pour them cups of coffee.
“Ah, you've discovered my dastardly plan. Make it so you have no choice but to allow me to take up your space.”
“Wait,” Harry said, reaching out for Draco’s arm.
Harry leaned up, bringing their lips together once more.  Draco opened his mouth, issuing a silent plea for Harry to invade it.  Harry took a quick swipe with his tongue, then pulled Draco’s tongue into his mouth.  Their tongue’s danced in their mouths for a few moments, and then Draco’s head jumped back, causing them both to breath hard.
“Ruddy Slytherin’s,” Harry grumbled.
~*~*~
Millicent, Michael, and Ernie were helping with the final bits of renovations to the potions dungeons with Professor Slughorn.
The foursome sat in contemplative silence for a beat, before McGonagall changed the subject, saying, “Well, Harry, from what I can see here, I am very impressed by your renovating skills.”  She swept her eyes across the sitting room.
Harry smirked and still looking at Draco, flicked his wrist.  He knew he had succeeded by the wide-eyed look Draco had on his face.  He turned his head and saw a small, ornate, green teapot, with a silver trim sitting on the carpet where the table had been moments before.
It was such an odd feeling, and a tad uncomfortable, but it was worth it when things were moving quickly.
“I don’t want to be alone,” Draco whispered.
They sat in silence for a few moments, before Hermione spoke again, saying, “I should probably be going.”
Her face lit up as she quickly said yes, and the pair went down into the room.
He stepped into the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror.  I’m getting married, today, he thought to himself.  Merlin, he couldn’t wait.  It had only taken a few months of actually being with Draco for him to realize that this was his long-term goal.  He knew that he could never live without him in his life, so in the end, it would have to be all or nothing.
“Yes. Harry is worried about the house not getting finished before Christmas, and I asked if you were helping him this weekend.”
“No, love, go back to sleep,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and trying to get him to curl back up to his side.
They both looked around the room, avoiding looking at each other.  Finally, Draco said, “Well, I should probably go.  Um, if you want any more help with anything, let me know.  I’ll talk with my mother about looking at the furniture.”
get caught up in work?  Just be able to enjoy yourself?”  He smiled as he gripped Draco’s hips.
“Bloody hell,” Ron whispered, as he helped Harry carefully pull Draco into the house.
“I want to show you all what I’ve envisioned down here.  I sketched out the plans earlier.”
“Just have to run back upstairs and make sure I’ve got everything, and then we can go.”
“Is that right?”  Draco nodded with a sultry look in his eyes.  “Well, in that case, let me change, and tell me why everyone is here.”
“Morning, ‘Mione,” he said, pecking her on the cheek.
Ron had stood up from his place on his bed and stepped towards the door, face turning red.  “I’m going to pop by yours and have a little chat with my best mate.”
Harry gave him a look, but went ahead and grabbed Draco’s hand, twisting away in apparition.  They landed in the exact same alleyway that they always did, but this time, it felt different.
“I’m glad to see that you both had a wonderful time,” Narcissa said.
Harry walked back into the room, causing Draco to sit up.  “They understand.  Bill said to lay low for the day, and he’ll hopefully see you tomorrow.”
Even after all these years, and no matter how many times he begged, his photo was on the front page of the
Harry, looking absolutely bewildered, kept looking back and forth between the two.  “Excuse me?”
Prompt:
“No stag party.”
“No, I showered last night.  Just going to shave.”
“Let’s go to the dining room.  Then, we can see what else they have planned for this afternoon.”
Harry just nodded, moving over and laying his head on Draco’s chest.
The leaned in for another kiss, until they were interrupted by a loud, “UNCLE HARRY!  UNCLE DRACO!  COME ON!”
Flitwick’s wand waving around the room brought Harry back to the present.  “I am giving each of you a feather.  Please practice levitation, summoning, engorgement, and shrinking spells, silently and wandlessly.  You may begin.”
Harry laughed at that, and took one more look at Dumbledore.
Draco sighed as he finished the last gift he had in front of him.  “I don’t know what to do.  That sounds like the perfect mixture of your style and my style.  And I still like the thought of May or June.  Flowers blooming, green grass.  Oh, Harry!  How do I tell my mother no?”
He pulled back, and smiled.  He wrapped an arm around Draco, who smiled at her.
“Just in time for the holidays, too.  I’m sure Draco is very happy to have you back.”
He slowed down, pulling nearly all the way out and then slowly pushing back in, which caused Draco to growl in warning and grip his legs tighter around Harry.
Their lips separated for a moment, as Draco reared up and ripped off his shirt.  Harry’s breath caught as he took in the pale chest.  Without thinking, he lifted his hands to run over the blond’s smooth stomach.
“Johnson?”  Receiving a nod, Harry smiled.
“Almost a year?  We had been thinking May or June, though.”
“Agreed.
“And then I went and did even more horrible things after coming out of that room alive.  I wish I could take it all back.  I wish—I wish…”  He broke down into more sobs.
Hermione sat next to him, with Ron on her other side.  She leaned over to Harry and whispered, “I’ll talk to him” in his ear.  Harry tightly smiled at her.
Teddy turned to look at his godfather.  “You didn’t know?”
Harry had never tasted anything as perfect as that.  Yes, it was salty and bitter, but it was
“When my parents died, Dumbledore took me to my mum’s sister’s house, my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon’s house.  I have a cousin named Dudley.
“Okay.  Let me walk you out.”
“Oh, Circe!  You're right!  There's so much to do!  I don't even know where to start!”
Fluff, sexy times, and angst await you in this chapter.  I know, I'm cruel!
"Me, too.  Ooh, yes!  Definitely have wanted you for a while now," Draco gasped, pushing his hips towards Harry.
“So you keep saying,” Harry muttered.
A feeling he had never experienced before welled up in his stomach.  It was part nostalgia, part sadness, part love, and part hope.
“Yeah, I suppose.”
“Mum hasn’t figured out that Ginny is no longer a baby.”
“My assistant is making the order, and it will pop in when it’s ready.  Now, again, thank you for allowing me to hear your side of things, Mr Malfoy.”
“Well, mine is for…” Ron threw his head towards Hermione, indicating that he was needing to go shopping for her.
Harry managed to quickly come over and pull the curtains shut before she spouted anything more out of her mouth, and then turned to help Malfoy up.
“Err…” Harry ran his hand through his hair.
“Show off,” Draco smirked, silver eyes filled with lust.
“The first couple were me, but that last one was Draco,” Harry said between laughter.
Draco woke with a start, sitting straight up in bed, heart pounding out of his chest.  He blearily looked around his magically enlargened bed, and realized that Harry was not beside him anymore.
Don’t get him wrong, he still spent time with his old Slytherin cronies, but he now had a weekly gossip lunch with Hermione, Luna, Pansy, Astoria, and Ginny (when she can make it), a bi-weekly chess match with either Ron or Blaise, and Sunday dinner with all the Weasley’s.  His life was completely different than how he had ever imagined it would be, and he was grateful for it.
It was now Draco’s turn to stop as he came to a halt in the middle of the street they were crossing, causing Harry to walk past him a few steps before realising he was alone.
Draco felt his stomach twist at the mention on Harry, but quickly disregarded it to give his best friend a scathing look.  “And what is that supposed to mean?”
Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy this story!
“You.”
Harry turned back to look at him, smiling.  “
“Yep, we sure are.  Let’s get in line to get our skates.”
Harry’s anger loosened the tiniest bit as he had a flash-back of Ron saying something similar to that nearly a year ago.
He skated away from them before turning back and gaining some speed before he jumped into the air, spinning a few times, and then landed gracefully back down on the ice.  He circled back, slowly skating back towards them.  He saw the awe in Teddy’s eyes, smiling as he clapped and whooped loudly.  He then chanced a glance up at Harry and saw something that he hadn’t seen in what felt like forever; pure lust.
Draco quickly looked up at him, and with a nervous look, stood up and followed Harry out of the dorm and then out of the common room.  Once they were on the stairs, he finally spoke.  “Bet you are ready for the other students to get here.”
“See you in the morning.”
“I’ll show you later,” Hermione whispered to Draco, making him smile.
He unwrapped it, and rolled his eyes, small smile gracing his face.
~*~*~*~*~
Teddy’s giggle at how they said it in sync.  He turned back to go sit at the table, but before he could, he was picked up from behind by Harry, who started squeezing him in a hug.  Draco picked his feet up, and together they started tickling and kissing him.
“Harry! I didn't think you were going to be able to join us this evening?” Molly asked, standing up from her seat beside Arthur.
Draco reached out for a spare chair, before sliding into the booth next to Harry, and asking Nott to go get them drinks.
They were all sitting at breakfast, going over last minute reviews, when Harry heard the unmistakable sound of the owls sweeping into the Great Hall.  Harry wasn’t expecting any mail, so was shocked when a tawny barn owl landed in front of him.  The owl automatically stuck its leg out, seeming bored with its mission.  Harry barely had released the letter from the creature, before it lifted itself back up into the air.
“Of course.  She is more than welcome, whenever she wants to.”
“Come on, we might be able to get back to the castle before lunch begins.  Now that this is over, I’m starved.”
They turned to face each other, both looking back behind them to see their loved ones.  Hermione, Ron, Pansy, and Blaise stepped up to circle them, all turning to face Minerva.
Harry turned again to go up the stairs, and again Hermione grabbed his wrist, but he just pulled her along, Ron following in their wake.  Once they were up in his bedroom, Harry waved his wand, silencing charm falling in place around the door.
Harry summoned the new plates that he had bought for the occasion, starting to set the table.  Ron was placing glasses on the table when he broke the silence.
His eyes moved to Seamus and Dean’s table.  Dean was reading his Charms book, but Seamus was twiddling his feather in his fingers.  Getting an idea, Harry smirked to himself and carefully put his hand out like his was going to do a spell on his own feather, but then twisted his palm and cast towards his friend’s.  Seamus was still holding his feather in his fingers when it suddenly became three sizes bigger.  He gasped loudly, quickly dropping the feather on the table.  Harry quickly looked back down at his own feather, just as Seamus turned his head, looking around at his classmates to see who was messing with him.
Draco screamed and slammed his feet onto the bed, causing Harry’s fingers to slip in even farther.  “FUCK!”
Harry sat stunned a moment, trying to process what Draco had told him.  Suddenly, the first part of the conversation came to the fore-front of his mind.
he was talking about.  What should he care what happened to the git?  Seven years of fighting and snide comments, and now he was worried about the ferret?  Something must be wrong with his head.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh.  “I told you!  I don’t know how he did it!  There were several pictures that were of random witches and wizards in Diagon, so I figure he was just taking pictures randomly.”
“Two weeks.”
“What in the hell was that?!” Malfoy exclaimed, standing and dusting himself off.  “How can you live with that thing in your house?”
“It’ll be ready.  Looking forward to seeing you again, Mr. Potter!”
“Ah.  Well, how about this?  Hermione, why don’t we go shopping Wednesday in Diagon in the morning, and then Ron can meet us, and I can go off with him?  Does that work for you both?”
They looked at each other a moment before Harry smiled, rolling his eyes.
Harry paused a moment, and then nodded his head.  “Alright then.  Don’t worry, I’ve got an idea.”
The group laughed as Harry flipped him the V’s, continuing speaking as if he hadn’t been interrupted.  “If everyone didn’t already have plans for New Year’s Eve, maybe we could have a party at mine?  I’m nearly done with the majority of renovations, and thought it could be fun,” he said with a shrug.
“No,” Harry spat, as the anger he had been repressing suddenly flooded his mind.  Just as suddenly, though, a distinct hurt echoed through him, and he said, barely above a whisper, “No, we’re not.”
Ron put his hands up.  “I’m just saying.”  He stood back up, grabbing his things.  “I think I’m going to head back to the Burrow.  I’ll see you?”
Hermione smiled at him, looking over as Ginny started laughing at something George had said.
“I love you more.”
?  About the kiss?  He didn’t want to open Pandora’s Box, so he decided against it.  He took a deep breath, not just because of the long tale he was about to say, but also because of the memories it would delve up from the last weekend.
“Me, too.”
“I give up,” Hermione said with a roll of her eyes, throwing her hands in the air.  “So, what is for supper?  I’m hungry.”
Draco frowned slightly.  “You did?  Why?  Do you really think he’ll care?
Harry chuckled as he threw his leg back over the bike, walking back towards where Draco was standing beside it.
Harry smirked as he slid back down the bed, pulling Draco down with him to lay face to face.  “And me?”
They awoke early the next morning, barely saying anything to each other as they showered and finished packing their things; they were both still emotionally exhausted from their talk the night before.
“I’m sorry.”
“Would you—.”  He was cut off by Hermione standing up and tapping Harry on the shoulder.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry looked down at his watch and saw that it read 6:45pm.
“Do you—do you speak with her?”
“Well, it’s like real electricity, but it works with magic.  So, I can plug in things, like muggle lamps.” He walked over to the bedside table and showed them the lamp turning on and off, manually.  “And I can get muggle appliances for the kitchen.  But, then I can also use magic on them.”  With that, he waved his wand and the lamp turned on.
They finished the tour in the formal dining room, where Harry explained that that was where they were going to have Christmas dinner, and he was thinking of getting a tree for in there, as well as the sitting room.
Kingsley sighed as Clarice gave him all the information she had.  Harry smiled as he waved to Kingsley, and quickly exited the office.  He had already heard rumours that people were hoping that he would one day be minister, but after spending just a little bit of time with Kingsley, he knew that that was not something he would be too keen to do.
has changed.  I’ll be the first to admit that Draco has changed the most, too.  He has his moments, of course.  We all do.  But he’s not the arrogant, smug, pompous Pureblood that we’ve known since first year.”
Thursday morning found the students of Hogwarts looking weary.  Their last exams of the term were that day, and the upper years were definitely feeling the pressure.  Hermione’s hair was frizzier than Harry had seen it in a while, and even Ron was looking paler than normal.
“But I was talking to my Mind Healer this week, and the gift came up; she thinks it would be a good idea for us to get away.  I know, you’ve got the Market going until the new year, so it doesn’t have to be right now, but I just thought that may—”
“Wait, what?”  Draco shook his head, trying to comprehend what Harry was saying.
The five women looked at each other, and then went towards their dorm.
“Have a good nap?”
“I do hope you two aren’t angry with me.”
“Might as well.  I think everyone that is coming is here.”
Teddy held still just long enough for Harry to pull his hat over his head and slip the gloves on before he bounded over to the brick wall.  “Come on! Let’s go!”
Harry moaned at the sight.  He caressed Draco’s legs, starting at his ankle and working up to the middle of his thighs.  As he did this, he leant in and mouthed Draco’s swell, kissing it and licking the silk.  Draco thrashed underneath him.
“Thank you,” he said shyly.
“Ron and I had a chat the other day,” he said, staring at their clasped hands.  “I didn’t realise…”
He looked back over at his aunt, who had nearly the exact same look on her face as his mother.  “Cissa,” she whispered.
He walked back into the room, moving to stand beside Narcissa, and could hear Draco making his way down the steps.  As he turned the corner, everyone yelled, “Surprise! Happy Birthday!” and the look on Draco’s face was pure astonishment and joy.  Harry didn’t know if he had ever seen a bigger grin grace that pale face.
The rest of the evening was spent talking, snacking on the many leftovers, and with Harry giving tours of the house.  Harry could tell that Professor McGonagall was impressed with all that he had done.  He was pleased that he could show her all that he had learned.
Draco was right.  He’d been so busy getting everything ready for the Market, working with the foreign committee members to get everything ready for opening day, he’d not had a single spare moment to think about Harry.  That’s not to say that he hadn’t seen him, nor spoken to him, but he had spent several nights sleeping on the couch in his office, or just collapsing on the sofa in their living room, never making it to their bed.
“Actually, that could be a lot of fun.”
“Come on, babe! Come for me! You have to come! I can’t hold out much longer! Dra—Draco! Gods! I love you!”
Harry sighed as he perched onto the edge of the desk.  “And how do you suppose we do that?  Draco’s mother has already half-planned an October wedding.”  He rubbed his face under his glasses.  “I don’t know what we’re going to do.”
Draco was finally able to rip his eyes away from his hand when Harry took hold of it, and he found Harry’s staring at him, hope and fear shining in them.  “Harry, it’s beautiful.  It’s our birth stones.  It’s perfect.”
Harry tried to focus on the conversations around him as they continued to rib on Neville and Hannah, but his eyes kept flicking to the door at every slight movement.  He laughed along with Blaise when Ron belched loudly.  He smiled when he caught Hermione’s eyes, too.  But, he was beginning to get antsy.
Seeing the look on Harry’s face, Draco became slightly concerned.  “What’s that?”
“Maybe.  But like I said, this has been going on for months.  Sometimes he just gets up and leaves, sometimes without saying anything, sometimes telling me he’s going for a walk, and then comes back hours later.”  He sat there, and then suddenly had an idea; one he was sure had always been in the back of his mind but had never wanted to really think about until now.
Draco could only nod, gripping the headboard behind his head.
“So, I owled your Mother, asking if I could come and speak with her and your father.  She invited me for dinner the next day—remember that night that Pansy had dragged you out for dinner and dancing?  That was when I went to the Manor.
“Oh, nothing.  Don’t worry about it.  I’ll see you up in the common room.”
He had to be cheating on him.  That was truly the only explanation, as Harry had always been a very hands-on lover.  At times, while they were dating, Draco had almost felt suffocated because Harry was always right by his side, or laying on top of him, or had his head on his shoulder.
It's party time and they tell their families and friends of their engagement.
“Follow my lead, okay?”
Draco searched his face, trying to find any evidence of betrayal, but instead saw nothing but fear and sorrow.  He scooted back on the bench so he could see Harry clearly, and nodded his head.
“Oh! Of course!”
“You’re not the only one in this, Harry.  I… I was afraid I was the only one that really wanted this.”
“How old is he?”
Draco pulled back far too soon for Harry’s liking, but when he looked into those grey eyes, he smiled.
“Salazar, you’re right!  What was I thinking?  We have to have a stag night!”
He placed Teddy down on the changing table.  He pulled Teddy’s clothes off, quickly changing his diaper.  Pulling out the bag that Andromeda gave him, he unshrunk it and pulled out pyjamas.  After Teddy was dressed, Harry sat down in the rocking chair.  Teddy was continuing to yawn, but it took a few minutes of rocking for him to finally fall asleep.  Harry looked down at his godson, suddenly wondering if Sirius had ever done this with him.
Draco pressed back into Harry, pressing his forehead to Harry’s.  “I should go.”
“Get on the bed.”
owl.  He almost felt as if they had imprinted on each other. When the animal bent its head and nipped on Harry’s finger, he had a flash memory of Hedwig, doing the same. It was at that point that he knew he was taking the owl home.
“Hello, Beverly,” Draco said, stepping around Harry to greet her.  He pulled her gently in for a hug, and kissed her cheek.  “Thank you for coming.”
Harry nodded as he said, “Yeah. When I received the owl from Pansy asking if Greg and Theo could come last night, I pulled out a few photos for each of them.”
Harry walked over to them, looking at Draco.  “Do you want to hold him as we walk, or do you want me to?”
“I lied.  We are celebrating tonight.”
Draco looked at the four sets of eyes staring at him.  “I don’t know.  I can remember leaving the Leaky, and getting on the Knight Bus.  I gave Harry’s address, and then went to the second level.  I…”
“Who?”
“What about if we take some of the wall down, too?”
“Er… thanks?”
John the cheese man hurried over. “Oh, that’s a real pity. Still, we can’t leave it lying around like this.” Before Draco really knew what was happening, the shards were being swept up and binned, and someone had thrust a polystyrene cup of hot, sweet tea into his hands. He stared at it. The weight was all wrong, and he couldn’t feel the burning tingle of the tea through the sides like he could with one of Henry’s cups.
As usual, falling into the memory was unnerving. Warm golden light filled the bedroom: a setting sun, casting long shadows across the room. The bright white lines of Draco’s body were clear, as were the fuzzier dark lines of Harry’s. They sat on the bed, fingers tracing each other’s bodies. Not the first time they had been naked together, but the first time they’d taken their time like this. Really looked at each other.
“You can’t Apparate.”
They sat in a small sitting room at the front of the house, and Draco was surprised yet again when a wizened old house-elf appeared and bowed deeply. A whirling sensation filled his body; Draco couldn’t quite work out where he was. By the time tea arrived, his stomach had settled a little, and Draco was able to sip his tea without the cup and saucer trembling too noticeably.
“Oh. Um, sorry to hear that.” Harry felt they were veering too close to dangerous territory, and he didn’t want Malfoy’s parents coming into the space they’d made, together, in the Room. However different their Christmases had been, now they were together again - even without knowing what to do next - there was a sense of excitement, in what could be.
Pansy made an undignified noise as her tea went down the wrong way. “Sorry; did you just say ‘Potter’?”
“Really?” Talking about other people was safer, and Harry was grateful for the way out it offered. “But we’ve all been calling her Millicent for months! Why didn’t she say something?”
Harry sat down. “I didn’t know you were still having treatment,” he said, trying to swallow down his sense of guilt with a sip of tea.
“It’s the old sitting room. I don’t use it anymore. You can have a look if you want though; there’s nothing interesting in there.”
“So. Inkledrum then. What do you think?”
This wasn’t news to Harry, but Ron looked puzzled. “For Muggles?”
“Draco’s been really helpful with more than just the cooking,” Ron said. “He helps clean the loo, too.”
“You know I’ve changed, Potter,” Malfoy said, “You wouldn’t be here with me otherwise.” The distance between them shrank again.
“I wouldn’t be asking if the need wasn’t great. And I know the old Black house; you still have room.”
“You think I don’t think they matter? Of course they matter.” Malfoy spoke through clenched teeth. “It’s why I– I need to do this. To be a better person. And it hasn’t come for free. Do you really think I’ve got any friends? You’re probably the only here could actually understand anything of who I am.”
“I’m thinking of you as
With relief Harry left his broom on the side. His hands were sore, and he suspected he’d have blisters to deal with. More than that though his chest, arms and back were all aching; he would be feeling the effects of this exertion for days to come.
A strange feeling of possession passed through Harry at the sight, and he moved his thumb again and was rewarded by another intake of breath. But then Malfoy opened his eyes, and looked directly at Harry, and the atmosphere in the room changed. There was fire in his eyes, and something else. Something… predatory. Harry felt trapped, and he began to tremble, suddenly unsure about what would happen next.
Luna stood perfectly still, her face pale and her eyes wide. She gave Harry a sideward glance and a nervous smile. “I can see that.”
Draco flicked open the catches holding the Snitches in the box, and watched as they sprang to life. Wings unfurled, they darted around the room. Like small golden birds, they filled the air.
"Yes, I do. I'm Teddy's godfather," said Harry. He knew that Andromeda never mentioned the Malfoys: when she spoke of her family she always meant the people she had lost, Teddy, and now Harry too.
“A perfect mouthful,” Malfoy said, and both Harrys blushed at his words and the way his mouth had wrapped around them in unmistakeable suggestion.
“Er, Draco’s got hot feet.” Harry avoided Hermione’s gaze.
He squeezed her hand, feeling its strength. “I don’t want to live with ghosts anymore,” he said.
“I can’t. Can’t have any magic interfering with the charms on the Snitches.”
“Have you ever sold anything before?”
“You won’t,” Draco said, but Harry still looked fearful. “I won’t let you.”
Harry’s hands ached, feeling bruised where he had pushed against the broom, over and over again. He wanted to be able to trust Malfoy, wanted to believe what Malfoy said, but it was hard.
Rather like the tiny cogs laid out on the worn felt lining the workbench, Draco laid out the information he had and tried to make sense of it. Potter, mercifully, kept quiet, while Draco pondered this.
“Paintings? Oh. No; it sells arts supplies. Shh.” Henry moved in front of Draco as a portly witch emerged from the back.
“Oh yes?”
As he strode out into the busier street beyond, warm honeyed sunlight fell across his face, and Draco felt his shoulders lighten. Perhaps this wasn’t so bad a way to pursue his apprenticeship, after all.
“Bollocks. You’re hurt.”
“And it might have been because of the Horcrux,” Hermione said. “Like your knowing Parseltongue.”
“Mione’s probably pumping him for info on house-elves. She’s thrilled you’ve shacked up with a load of snooty old purebloods—”
Draco found a small hillock, and made himself comfortable. He opened his notebook, then tried to focus on the movements of the small golden birds flying around him, their wings ablur. Potter seemed to understand his need for quiet, and wandered off.
Potter nodded, his fingers curling as though remembering holing a Snitch himself. “Yes. No wonder the collectors like that: it makes it theirs alone.”
“I am not,” Malfoy said frostily. The room quieted, and Harry felt all eyes on Malfoy. He also felt Malfoy squirm under the scrutiny, felt him stiffen up.
"Good, because I’m hot enough not to care today, but I don’t want to come down with some horrible illness." Especially not considering Potter’s outhouse set-up.
Remembering the affability of Nearly Headless Nick, Harry wondered if ghosts might have been easier to bear than memories. At the bottom of the stairs Harry pushed the kitchen door open, to find, as usual, Kreacher standing at the stove. Kreacher turned, his tea-towel loincloth firmly knotted, and the lines of his face seeming as dust-filled and worn-looking as the rest of the house.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Vanishing Spells had worked for them, but only after some Muggle-style sweeping.
"But it’s not something that can be taught," Draco finished, having heard this before. "I know."
“In that case, I’ll be pleased to help you. If I can.”
Pansy swept in, wafting the cloying scent of her disgustingly expensive perfume behind her.
Harry patted the book on his lap. It was only now that Draco spotted the title:
“Good luck,” Padma said darkly.
"Thanks." Potter shifted at Draco’s side as he returned his wand to within the folds of his clothing. "I’ve been tinkering with it, trying to work out how to get it to spread more slowly."
After the fourth or sixth drink, things stopped feeling so strange. It was just a party, and every party was the same, regardless of the strangeness of its setting. Quidditch players doing more shots in the kitchen. Hermione relaxed enough to lecture a nodding Hannah. A group of Ravenclaw girls giggling at a portrait, with the ancient Malfoy inside glaring back in offense. Neville magically sorting through someone’s weed for salvageable seeds to germinate. His friends turned the manor into a common room, and he’d missed them all.
Harry shrugged, not arguing when he thought about the half-blood prince and Occlumency and the terrible things that Harry was good at. Draco seemed to expect an argument, though, and he watched Harry for another moment before he stood, wiping his hands off and handing the basket over.
“She hates everyone equally,” Draco assured him. It was strange again, how much they had in common, how non-strange it felt. They swapped a few more Grimmauld stories, and Harry found himself wondering aloud at how to fix each separate horror. Sure, the portraits were bitter and the spiders had taken over the attic, but after Malfoy Manor Harry was starting to think that it wouldn’t be such a hard fix, after all.
“What?”
“Alright, be careful,” Ron advised unhelpfully, and stood to go. “And if you come, put a shirt on. Gin’ll get the wrong idea.”
“And a trophy,” Ron groused, leaning all the way back until his chair squealed in protest. “A bloody huge one.”
“Oh, that’s not good at all,” she said, biting her lip. “Okay, well, I’ll go look it up. But I think you really should stay, then. I
and Harry let his hand fall back to the side.
“You will be okay, won’t you?” Hermione was saying, clutching her endless bag, now filled with sunscreen and her childhood photos. “Harry?”
“So, er.” Draco turned toward him expectantly, and Harry found he had nothing to say. He didn’t want to talk about anything heavy, not really, and tackling the unsolved matter of Malfoy’s continued existence seemed like it would take more than coffee. In the face of Draco’s mild grey stare, he only found himself able to say, “what are you up to today?”
Draco nodded, but then hesitated and pulled his own wand out. “Can I?”
Wizarding homes weren’t passed over with a key. Malfoy couldn’t own it in absentia — his magical signature had to stay present in the home to control it, woven in the spells, offering claim of ownership. As the days ticked away, the Manor was presumed to be falling further away from wizarding control, and Harry had gotten the Floo call two days ago.
“Thank you,” Hermiome said softly. “I’m sorry you lost your parents.” Ron cast a sideways look at her, and then nodded reluctantly.
Ron looked over his shoulder, and apparently seeing that Hermione was gone, turned back to Harry and lowered his voice. “Are you going mad over there? I would. Luna was saying you need to check for hinkypunks, she reckons they might try to kill you on the grounds sometime.”
been hiding. Part of him had just thought that Draco had wanted him there.
If they took Draco in before the paperwork was filed, the Manor would stay in Harry’s possession until after the Ministry had decided what to do with Draco, which would remove all possibility of house arrest and make parole impossible. If they waited too long, Draco would be arrested by unsympathetic, fully-fledged Aurors who would doubtless do their worst. If Harry released entire ownership of the home to Draco, the Ministry might try to force a sale or seizure as reparations. Every angle of it was tetchy, and there was only one way to do things right. Pansy and Ron would be an essential part — they were meant to tell the Ministry that they had tracked Draco to France and brought him back home, where he had come willingly. Harry wasn’t sure how he was supposed to explain why he would sign half home over, but Hermione reckoned it would help Draco’s case to have proof that Harry Potter had welcomed Draco back to the Manor in good faith, yet with caution. She was hopeful that it would guarantee him a spot on the witness stand, where he could throw his weight behind Draco’s character reference.
“Why aren’t you dead?” Harry asked instead, although he couldn’t be sure Draco wasn’t, really. He was ghost-pale, suspended in some brackish water that seemed everywhere, weightless.
Harry Apparated to Grimmauld Place and walked the halls. He felt like a ghost in his own house most days, too emotionally strung out to change a single peel of moulding wallpaper. How the fuck was he supposed to take on another place? Harry Potter, the Boy Who Inherited Properties He Couldn’t Keep Up With?
They had a secret now, for the least of things. And it was probably illegal in some way — either Harry was squatting, or Draco was. He longed to call Ron and Hermione, but he wasn’t convinced they wouldn’t just say he was seeing things. He was inclined to believe he’d finally cracked, himself, but then there was the handshake, and the solid feeling of everything having shifted.
“Fine,” Harry spat, his anger now merging with his magic until it hurt his chest. “Go on. Run home. Waste away in the walls again. Die in there like a rat, if that’s what you want so badly.”
Now that he was alone, he set off to investigate. First the tapestry. He approached it carefully, pulling one corner as carefully as if it were a monster book of monsters. Nothing there. He checked the cupboards; nothing but stashes of cauldrons, jumbled sets of fireplace tools, a leather case filled with Quaffles whose spells had worn down.
“Okay,” she said, voice back to normal. “But let me know if you need any help to figure something out. I hate to see you alone in that house, wasting your life.”
He shifted, carefully trying to angle himself up and out of the bed so that he could clean up. The statues had fallen asleep in front of the fire, and he gave them a wide berth on the way to the door.
It was insanity, plummeting sharply downward with the wind everywhere but his lungs, jerking the broom back up and just barely clamping in with his knees. He climbed back up in the air, jerky and still breathless, a shot of joy stabbed through him. He’d been flying on his own here, but it hadn’t felt like this.
“Oi!” Without a second though, Harry gave chase.
And then, like always, he pushed his luck.
It ended with pieces on the floor, tea on the table, and a silence that was more comfortable than the one they’d been in before.
“Says someone so inbred they’ve never seen
Harry climbed upstairs, seeing at once that Draco’s bedroom had disappeared again. He sighed and knocked on the wallpaper where the door had been. It shimmered reluctantly. “Draco?”
“Perfect.” Ron looked relieved to be excused. Harry didn’t blame him: he had a girlfriend to go back to, Molly’s leftovers, a place that was simply dirty instead of possibly evil. “Well, good luck.”
“I mean, sympathize, yes…” Hermione slowed folding, then stopped, putting down Ron’s Cannons jersey to give him her full attention. “But empathize? Harry, have you had any thoughts about death?” It was dark now, and they hadn’t put enough lights on past Ron and Hermione’s bedroom, so the halls were dark and the windows were dark and the lonely amber light of the room made Harry feel as though they were cocooned with their secrets.
“Oh, no, I actually died,” Harry corrected, feeling embarrassed for some reason. The people who knew had treated him like some kind of reborn superhero, and he didn’t know what he’d do if Malfoy reacted the same way. He felt like telling the truth here, though.
“Go and find some wine,” Draco suggested. He turned back around and began cutting the sandwich, putting both halves in the same plate before he wrinkled his nose and reached for a second plate to better separate his meal from Harry’s saucy mess. “You mongrel.”
“I was wrong, you have gone mad,” Draco told him, and stood up. “I’m going to bed.”
The morning Harry was moving out.
“Yes, shut up,” Hermione said absentmindedly, and Ron shot Harry an apologetic look before helping her pile the things neatly. She’d brought a change of clothes, some new socks and underwear, a coat that had been left draped over his chair. And there was a box, that for months had lived under the worn-out old drawers the Dursleys used to give him, containing Draco Malfoy’s wand. “I think you should try to use it. It might help to link you to the Malfoy magic that the Manor’s been running on. You’re its master, so I think that should help.” She cast a quick spell over everything and shoved it all into the fire before he could respond. Harry dragged everything out quickly, still not used to seeing things burning without trying to snatch them from the flames.
“Your birthday was more than a week ago. Granger was right, you need to get out more.”
“Great, they helped everyone keep an eye out for me,” Harry groused, wiping crumbs from his mouth, while Draco laughed at the headline
Harry nodded. And then Draco reached out, letting his thumb slide over the scar on Harry’s forehead. Harry shut his eyes and fought a shiver at the touch, the strange sensation and the loaded sentiment locked into his skin. He’d once seen it as a sign of hatred, a battle scar borne from before he could remember. But now he only saw it as a mark of love, and feeling Draco’s feather=light touch, he knew that to be true.
“I know.” Draco brushed his fingers across Harry’s knee, which made him start until he realized that Draco was reaching for the bottle. He handed it over. “I meant we’re both idiots.”
Harry searched every room in the Manor, taking care to pound the walls where he thought rooms had been swallowed. Was the ghost in there? Was it trapped? “Draco!”
“Hmm,” was all Draco said in response, before he turned and bolted toward the stairs.
Harry hesitated, feeling his resolve to hate Pansy fading away fast. He couldn’t imagine losing Draco already, and he’d only truly known him for a few months. “He couldn’t have reached out to you, he was so scared he almost died here. He would have, if he could, I’m sure. I just… was here. It was lucky.”
“Fucking Potter,” he mumbled, but he didn’t sound upset. “Always fucking Potter.”
He woke up in the middle of the night to the warm cramp of a body beside his. “Draco?” he whispered blearily, patting around. Someone had removed his glasses in his sleep, and he patted the sheets until he found Draco’s shoulder. “Draco?”
“Oh, you can burn someone off a family tapestry, but you can’t undo blood rights,” Ron asserted, seemingly pleased to know something. “Let us know if you get the house, yeah? We can burn the fucker down.”
Draco leaned back, just a hitch, slight enough that Harry doubted he’d done it on purpose. “Or you put me under Imperius, since you’re so good at it.”
“Exactly.” Malfoy brushed his hands against each other smartly. “Now, I believe you mentioned more War Stars.”
Most of the desks were empty, but they could hear voices right away. A cluster of the desk workers were gathered near the back of the room talking to each other, parallel to one of the rooms. It was clear they were waiting to hear what was happening inside, and Ron wasn’t among them, which meant…
Quickly, Harry pulled his hands away, trying to school his face into something stern and competent. Hermione took his hand and hustled him toward the elevators. He hadn’t been to see Ron at work yet, not wanting to give the department ideas about him joining, and also unwilling to spend more time here than absolutely necessary. The cold marble and the bustling ministry workers around them made him even more anxious as they passed through. He didn’t know how Ron could stand to come here every day, but maybe he had memories of visiting his dad at work that had nothing to do with Harry’s memories of desperate plans and endless trials.
“Of course there are, this is an alder grove.” Draco gestured to the trees as if they meant something. “Wand wood. Really good for non-verbal spells.”
“I hate it like this,” Draco admitted, his voice soft and his eyes near-clear, nearly endless. “It just feels the most formal because of all the stupid parties I had to attend growing up. Dress robes and not a hair out of place.”
Draco laughed, and Harry turned back to the mirror fully. He was a sandy blond now, and not pulling it off at all. “Sorry, I guess only I can be blond.” It clashed horribly against Harry’s skin, but at least it had kept its usual wild tufts and tangles.
do, Hermione corrected. “We have a good plan, we just have to adapt it when we know more. It will be okay, Harry, it will.”
Pansy found Harry in the hallway before she left. They’d had a strange lunch, of sorts, where everyone but Ron barely touched their food, and the talk had all been tense and strategic. Harry weighed in where he had to, but mostly picked at his food and tried unsuccessfully to catch Draco’s eye again.
“Enough for you to
“Draco… what do you know about the muggle world?”
He cleared his throat and turned back once he was redressed, meaning to go back  to Draco’s lap, but Draco was already standing. It was full dark now, the peacocks crying eerily to one another before they settled in for the night. Betty White-slash-Spalva would try to sneak in to sleep in bed again: she had taken the most to the privilege, and liked to exercise it, if a door was open.
Of course, no one could avoid the War forever. Seamus got too drunk and started to cry a little, toasting to Colin, and then everyone had to make a toast. Harry stood swaying in the doorway, buffered on one side by Hermione, listening to the toasts and the cheers as they got rowdier and rowdier with each name on the too-long list.
“You think I’m expecting so much,” Harry interrupted, annoyed now at all the begging he was doing. “You think I’ll make you go back to Hogwarts and I’ll go for head Auror and I’ll want to put your photo on front of the
He sent a Patronus to Luna, scaring the peacocks, and tracked her to Neville’s.
He’d developed a routine. He woke with first light, a habit ingrained from those months on the run. He’d take a broom off the wall and go flying first, covering another corner of the grounds each morning. Everywhere was something new to discover: a garden filled with bees, buzzing around eternally-blooming flowers of impossible colors. A tidy little labyrinth, whose path from the air showed the shape of an M in the middle, its other paths shifting daily. A small ruins, though whether they were real or some sort of modern folly, he couldn’t be sure. But it had a stone bench and quiet moss and a cool black pond in the center of its little courtyard, and Harry liked it either way.
,” Harry said, shocked.
“Relationship?” Pansy echoed, sounding faint. Her eyes had snapped to Draco as though he were magnetic, and the next noise she made was a sob. Draco went from leaning over Hermione behind the couch to the center of the room in an instant, and she crashed into him there, moving forward so quickly that Harry could hear their collision from across the room.
“Don’t you want me to? You’ve said you don’t want to be reliant on me, and you never asked me to move in. We haven’t even been dating long enough to live together.” The word
“Fucking Merlin,” Draco said to the ceiling, before he forced a charming smile in Ron’s direction. “I mean, thanks ever so.”
So he told her the truth, though he hadn’t realized it was the truth until right then. “Of course I’ve thought about death. I died. I’ve been thinking a lot about it. I don’t… I don’t think I want to go back there, though, not yet. Don’t worry.”
much?” Harry teased, and began looking for more things to throw off the roof. He wound up pitching pebbles into the air, Draco aiming his wand at each one. He missed the last one, and it shot backwards, smashing into a shield that Draco slipped in front of Harry at the last second.
“That’s an insensitive thing to say about yourself,” she said mildly, and dropped some Floo Powder before stepping through the fire.
A few desperate minutes of all-out war broke out, each of them scuffling for an upper ground that didn’t exist in the world of food fights. There was something incredibly satisfying about flinging a handful of sliced pepperoni right into Malfoy’s bright, stupid face, and an exhilaration in the way he had to duck Malfoy’s reach after that, in the sharp bank of pain that came when he slammed his elbow into the counter while evading.
“Am I going crazy?” he whispered to himself, jeans soaking through, waters rushing like the blood in his ears.
“—but then, what if you, you
They picked up their brooms, and went.
He helped straighten up and went back to what he had: the Manor.
to touch was so new that Harry was hardly sure he was doing it correctly. Maybe there wasn’t an incorrect way and he was getting too nervous, but he wanted to know all the ways that Draco preferred, and he wanted to get started on learning them right away.
“Sorry, Harry,” Luna added. “I only told Neville. But we think it’s nice. Draco’s been so lonely. Even when I was staying there and his parents were still about, I could tell he was lonely then, too.”
“Fuck
“Can’t fuck ghosts,” he murmured to himself, fiddling with the box. It popped open, and the wand dropped onto the floor, rolling until it was stopped by the cast-iron, House Elf-sized fireplace tools. It was thin and long, made of hawthorn. He thought maybe it had unicorn hair or something, which seemed a little strange, thinking of Draco as an innocent. He was maybe more innocent than Harry had thought as a kid, though. Or at least a little less culpable.
Hermione swore as she kicked a box open. Clothes spilled out, and she Accioed jeans and Keds. She didn’t waste time with modesty, instead stripping down to a cotton bralette and clashing panties, catching the t-shirt Harry unearthed to toss at her. She was dressed in seconds, the backs of her shoes flattened under her sockless heels, her shirt declaring her a St. Mungo’s Donor in flashing cartoon letters. And then she grabbed Harry’s hand, and they Apparated away.
He caught up halfway up the second landing, knocking Draco’s slim shoulder aside to pass. They scrambled together through the door of the Quidditch room. Draco tried to shove Harry sideways into the doorframe. Harry stumbled, then dove after him, grasping for Draco’s Firebolt a second after Draco plucked it off the wall. Harry barked out a breath that was half-laugh and found an old Nimbus, its lines familiar under his hand.
“It’s natural that you would both be nervous about the plan. This is always the hardest phase, the waiting. Thinking of all the ways that could go wrong, you know?“
A home that felt magical, and Draco Malfoy even moreso.
dating. So. I hope that’s not a problem.”
The next morning was a riot of pancakes and Pepperup potion, a small army of hungover friends pouring coffees and righting spilled bottles. Harry clapped shoulders and received cheek kisses and one by one, everyone went back to their jobs and their lives.
“Home,” Harry whispered, but Draco blazed on —
It felt too honest to say, but then, they were in the dark. Draco was quiet for a moment, then cleared his throat and said the last thing Harry would have expected. “I talked to Luna.”
. “We’re not sleeping. We’re staying up all night planning a party.”
“It fucking should be.” She kissed him again, and this time he felt the good-bye in it. “Ron and them, they might not get it. But you do, I think.”
“She yells at you, too?” Harry was surprised. “I thought she just didn’t like me for being muggleborn.”
They appeared in the alleyway outside the Ministry, Harry swearing angrily as he threw the phone booth open wandlessly, violently enough to slam against the frame. He punched the numbers in too fast, messing it up the first time. Hermione took over, and he put his hands over his face as the booth spun them into the Ministry hallway.
“Well the famous Harry Potter laid that glass down, so start bragging about that instead.” He opened the jar of jam, ignoring Draco’s indignant noise.
“Potions?” Harry asked, gesturing with his chin at the spiralled plant Draco was plucking leaves off of now.
Underneath their feet, fish flitted back and forth, chasing each other from the coffee table to the squashy armchair. “Do you want to watch something else?” Harry asked. He was curious, suddenly, about what Draco would pick.
“You gave them all female names.” Draco was walking ahead of him now, but Harry could practically
He left Hermione an hour later. She was yawning as he Apparated away, having tired herself out with her favorite distraction from life’s pains — learning. Harry was tired himself, but the moment he cracked back into the Manor’s foyer, guilt and anxiety spiked into him like a shot of espresso.
“Wait,” he demanded in return, half-stumbling forward to kneel on the plush Tabriz carpet in front of him. “Just wait.” He gripped Draco’s thighs, silently willing him to shut up, so he could lean up and forward to kiss him.
Draco dropped it on his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
.” Harry sat all the way down on the floor. He picked up a shirt at random — it looked like a souvenir from the World Cup, and it felt like another world in which they’d both gone, Lucius and Fred alive beside them. “I’m not going anywhere and I’m not going to let that happen.”
Harry clambered into the windowsill and looked back down. Below, one of the fountains was bubbling away, its tiles shifting through mythological mosaics.
“My ancestors’ marriages were carefully curated to prevent inbreeding, you berk. You really know nothing about being pureblood, for someone with strong enough lineage for the house to recognize. Look at what you did to the formal dining room.” He didn’t sound mad, though. He almost sounded impressed.
They sat. The water was fresh and cool and it came up higher than Harry had expected, so it leached into the fabric of his jeans, darkening them up to his knees. From the ground, the manor rose up all the higher, its towers and tiles gleaming in the bright light.
“You could have stopped to send an Owl.”
“It’s okay to lose it sometimes,” she assured him. “And it’s okay to hide sometimes.”
“Well, Plan B was temporary housing of some sort.” Ron knocked the scone stack off-balance and sighed, then grabbed a fork to eat the resulting mess. “Like when Durmstrang stayed on their ship. But again, perimeter… something something.”
“I’m not going into Muggle London dressed like this.”
She took a drag, watching him again, and then began coughing. Harry rolled his eyes and plucked the cigarette out of her hand, Summoning a glass and filling it with water. “I told you.”
“What’s that?”
“Here I am,” Malfoy agreed, raising the bottle. “And here you are. The Great Potter. I’m actually relieved you know the Unforgivables, I was so sure you’d take down the Dark Lord with Expelliarmus and friendship.”
And if he let Draco run ahead to see more of the way those pants were fitting, he didn’t say anything either.
He tried not to blink as Pansy studied him. “I don’t understand,” she said finally. “But you’re right, we both want the same thing. So.” She stuck her hand out, clearly reluctantly, and when he took it she barely squeezed before turning to go. “Tell Draco I’ll be back after work.”
“No,” he said quickly, imagining how badly that would upset the koi. “But Ginny’s going away, right? We could do her party there? Or is that weird?”
“Hey, do you remember toasting Malfoy at your birthday?” Neville asked, hours later, when they’d smoked most of a joint and gone to dim sum and talked about everything else in the world, all  while Harry steadfastedly ignored the hours ticking. Pansy was almost certainly at the Manor with Draco now, and he didn’t want to think about that. Luna was laying on the couch playing some Muggle video game and eating homemade kimchi out of a jar while Harry and and Neville watched, passing the second half of the joint back and forth. Neville charmed the soil he grew his weed in for a buoyancy that felt light and warm, grown with St. John’s Wort for an uplifting sweetness.
had moved? Maybe?
“What does it look like?” Draco sat back down on the floor. He was wearing charcoal trousers and a white undershirt now, and Harry had assumed that he was picking through the clothing to find a shirt to wear with it. But as he watched, Draco dug through the pockets of a winter coat, using his wand to lift every scrap of lint to his eyes for inspection.
“Maybe we don’t go in, then.” He nodded past Draco at the sidewalk they’d just come down. “Head that way?”
He sat on the front steps of the manor, bowl nestled in his lap and bottle at his side. It was getting dark, but strange little lights were starting to dance along the garden, and statues and follies in the distance were beginning to glow as the sun disappeared. It was like some fanciful park ground, everything timed to turn on and off. He wondered if the lights had been going on and off, the pantry replacing old food, all without anyone there to oversee it. If the Manor had been left to fall down, could someone come back in a hundred years to its ruins, and still see lights coming on in the gardens at sundown?
“Us,” Draco muses. Both of his hands slid up and down Harry’s thighs now, back and forth from his hips in a motion that no longer seems unconscious. “How curious.”
idiot.”
“What ugly fucker?” Harry asked, the picture of nonchalance, as the gargoyle shattered into a million stone pieces.
“The powers that be asked us to check in with you. Recruitment sign-ups open this weekend. Weasley has been dropping by for weeks already.”
“Actually, Harry, I don’t know that he is.”
Not quite an army, but Harry understood how rumors travelled. “Not the ideal tenants, then?”
“I’m sure they have multiple dining rooms,” Harry said, tired of arguing. “‘Mione, help me here.”
“Protego structūra theory,” Hermione supplied, and took her fresh cup of tea from the air. She smiled at Ron over the top of it, and he aimed his jammy grin at her. “Anyway, Plan C was renting student flats in Hogsmeade. I’ll be sharing a place with the other returning Gryffindor girls.”
“Why didn’t you take your room?” Harry broke the silence on purpose. Draco seemed uncharacteristically predisposed toward silence now, and he’d been hogging the bottle, as well.
“You died anyway,” Draco grumbled, and followed him down the stairs.
“That’s something,” Ron said dubiously. He was laying on his back at Grimmauld, facing Harry upside-down through the flames. “Reckon you can leave yet? We’re going down the pub with everyone.”
He led Draco to the Screen on the Green, a janky old movie theater that belched the scent of stale popcorn onto the street every time someone stepped in under its neon sign. He tried his best to explain film crews and California on the way, but Draco didn’t understand two out of three nouns, and he point blank refused to accept that film cameras weren’t just magical photo cameras.
“I’m okay right now. Maybe after Quidditch.” Harry stretched his legs out, pointing his toes and wiggling them before he sent the mug flying back into the kitchen and stood himself.
“Is everyone ready?” Hermione fretted, looking around at them. It was a Sunday night, with an early-morning Portkey waiting to  take Ginny and Dean to New York in the morning. Hermione’s bags were packed as well, for her new commute to and from Hogwarts.
Sticky globs of dough were cemented to the marble counter, a riot of flour dusting the floors underneath. A butter dish had been smashed and half-heartedly repaired, and the drawers and cabinets sat open at dangerous angles. Draco yanked his wrist back, his face pink and miserable.
After a few hours he’d stewed himself into a right strop. Besides, he was sweating again, a sticky level of grime forming on top of his already-cooled sweat. He started stripping down in the middle of the doorway, sick of feeling gross and trapped and prodded at, kicking his trainers into the decorative panels of rich wood in the hallway. He slammed the door shut, delighting in the alarming noise the glass inserts made from the impact.
Ron wasn’t speaking much by the end, but he bobbed in place, remaining upright at the kitchen table. Harry and Hermione and Hannah Abbott were the only ones still talking, everyone else having crept off or gone home or passed out right in the sitting room. Grimmauld was nowhere near as finished and polished as the Malfoy Manor, but it felt a thousand times homier, packed with friends as it was now.
“I know I can!” he shouted instead, meeting his confusing feelings with anger the way he always had. “I want
“It is.” Draco rapped on the floor that bordered the runner they sat on. A fish came up to his knuckles, hopefully brushing along the underside of the glass.
Harry Apparated to the front gate, feeling like a walk after a night of abusing his poor body. From the iron arcs of the entrance, the place was vast and beautiful, twinkling like a jewelry box set up on a hill.
The wand helped, Harry thought, but in weird ways. For one thing the food supply had changed, shifting to a collection of fanciful sweets, French breads, and exotic fruits that Harry wasn’t going to argue with, although he wondered at their appearance. When he used the wand to freshen up the warming spells that had been failing hourly, they sank into every cushion and comforter with ferocity, making his butt sweat every time he sat down until he could adjust the temperature.
Draco stared at him for a moment, then stood. “
This time Draco squeezed back.
“It’s his life, Ron,” she pointed out, and both Harry and Ron scoffed at the same time.
Hermione sighed. “It’s the property. He’s the last Malfoy now, right? So if no one can find him, no one will be able to claim ownership of the house. It’s a whole thing, ownership of magical homes are tied to blood if no sale is made. Actually, Harry…” she fixed him with a suddenly-keen look. “You’re the closest Black heir.”
“But what about meals?” Ron asked, a little desperately now. “You can’t eat at the same table You-Know-Who—”
Just past that door, was Draco.
“You don’t know they’ll do that,” Harry lied.
Draco released his breath and turned back, his face wan and hesitant. “It doesn’t hurt.”
“Mmm,” she nodded, and followed Harry’s nod to the plate cabinet, setting them out on the table while she thought, her focus shifted off of Harry now. Harry was relieved to have been released, and he set to serving everyone. Draco and Hermione sat down together, pointing at one thing or another as they rumbled over each other, bent inward, and Harry set to eating in silence. He didn’t mind — it was strange, to see the two of them, their hair nearly white and nearly black, brushing as they bickered. He thought he liked it.
“I think they’ll take extracurricular experience,” Savage chirped, confident again in his joke.
They went back inside, and Harry tried his best to be distracting from the buzzing, humming thoughts that he could see through Draco’s pale eyes. It worked, for a while, and their bodies moved together in a way that had begun to feel familiar. While their fingers brushed and while Draco’s mouth opened on Harry’s neck and while Harry felt his balls tighten and twitch, everything disappeared but sensation and skin. He even drifted off in a tangle with Draco, all sore muscles and warm blankets, but when he blinked his eyes open again, Draco was at his desk, his nose in a law book and his back to Harry.
Draco had watched without speaking, not reacting to the floors or the fishes’ sudden appearance. The entire first floor looked down on them now. Harry had looked between his feet at the eerie, beautiful lights, the ancient fish, and sat down right on the floor.
Draco’s head snapped up so quickly that he caught Harry in a surprising wash of eye contact. An instant of intimacy, of understanding, and then it was over.
Harry‘s lip quirked up. “What else do you and Ron say when you talk about me?” he asked, curious about the answer even if he didn’t have much faith in getting a real one. “Poor old Harry, he’s gone funny at the manor and is having a trauma-based gay crisis?”
He still didn’t know why he felt so rocked by the last ten minutes. The whole walk over he’d been sorting through each frenzied second, trying to make sense of it all together. Most surprising was that he felt any shock, that he hadn’t seen this coming. If he had been honest with himself a month ago, he would have known already the way he felt about Malfoy. If he had been smart for one fucking second, he would have remembered that they had always hated each other. Somehow both had gone ignored, both had gotten confused, and both things now hurt him equally.
“Why haven’t you already?” Draco shot at him. “I thought I could trust you, but you clearly can’t wait to be rid of me.”
Onscreen, Rick and Renault were wrapping up their lines. In the theater, Harry reached for Draco’s hand again.
Long, cool fingers wound through Harry’s hair, tugging and feeling and running through each snarl as though to figure it out. Harry wondered, briefly, how long Draco had been wanting to touch it.
Now that Draco wasn’t looking at him, Harry felt free to lay back. It felt a little strange to lay in Draco’s bed with him there, but it had been a long day. “Ron’s brother tried to kill himself. And- I stayed longer than I thought.”
“Is that how you’re going to talk me into things from now on?” Draco shook his head at his own reflection. “I won’t allow it.”
“Is that where we landed?” Harry felt like he’d swallowed something rotten, something that scratched at his throat from the inside like his memories of the night before, Draco’s fears laid out and Harry’s love all but admitted. It seemed impossible to breathe through, no matter how far away he went now.
“Sorry, I know it’s a secret,” Neville amended, and Luna nodded solemnly beside him. “I haven’t told anyone.”
It swung open, to his surprise, a seam in the wainscoting reaching upward to split the wallpaper in two, and Hermione disappeared inside, the blue and gold toile folding seamlessly shut behind her as her muffled voice joined Draco’s.
“Ready?” Draco was matching the smile Harry could feel on his own face. They hovered beside the wall of the house, facing each other.
“It’s an all-House party,” Hermione protested, picking up one weakly-yodeling garland before dropping it back into the box.
Before he knew it, it was full dark. The sky was a bruised purple, and he could only see stars if he looked up directly. Next to him Malfoy was so milk-white that he almost glowed in the dark, standing out against the black of the trees. It was the most most time outside Draco had gotten in who knew how long, Harry realized, and it was the first time he’d been in a forest since dying. It was nice just to sit, smelling the loam and the wet earth, no Snatchers, no giant spiders, no Voldemort. Just a surprisingly amiable quiet, and the crrk-crrk-crrk of the bowtruckles and a deep, heavy drunkenness that blended it all together into one blur of Draco’s white hair and the tickle of tiny feet and a strange sort of peace.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They ought to,” Draco insisted. “I may as well stay here. At least I’m choosing my own sentence. At least I can be with my things, and the grounds, and… you know.”
“Recognizing me?”
Harry frowned. “But…”
“I think he’s always been the way he seems now, a bit scared and a bit mean but very smart and... quite determined.”
“I don’t think he’s ever hated you, Harry,” Hermione said, squeezing his hand one more time before letting it go as the doors opened.
“He’s got me,” Harry said stubbornly, and Pansy threw her hands up.
. “Get off my leg, though, you’re an utter oaf.”
Both Order of the Phoenix members looked at him, and Draco shrugged, as though he hadn’t meant to react.
Ron sighed and leaned his head against Harry’s chest, though Harry was shorter than the both of them. He met Hermione’s eyes over Ron’s messy red hair.
to leave the Manor, no matter how the house frustrated him.
“How does it look worse like that?” Draco met him at the bottom of the stairwell, where they were face-to-face with Harry on the bottom step. Draco reached up to mess with Harry’s hair again, and Harry bore it patiently, studying the face in front of him. Draco looked strained but healthier than ever — his teeth dug gently into into his lip, and his brow was furrowed, but his skin was clear and his eyes were bright, and when he took his hands away with a huff of frustration, Harry leaned in to kiss him.
Harry could feel his hackles rising again. “You should be glad. I got rid of those guys.”
Hermione hesitated. Hary tensed up: the answer wasn’t good. “Well, of course the aurors might be able to get you in. They did before! And you still have the best legal claim, of course, it’s just… sometimes…”
“Don’t smile at me, it’s a manner of speech. Of course you wouldn’t know that. Did you even have any education before Hogwarts, or did Dumbledore have to teach you to wash yourself?”
“Not so bad.” Harry shredded the last piece of scone with his thumb, ignoring the look Hermione was now giving him.
“Panicked,” Draco shrugged, not meeting his eyes. “I grabbed them in the dark, then didn’t know how to put yours back. I didn’t know you could do wandless magic.”
They stayed in the cupboard for a little longer, sitting together but alone in their thoughts. Eventually Harry remembered the leftovers, and Draco stood when he mentioned them. He looked down at Harry, clearly hesitating, and then stuck out a hand to help him up. “Harry?”
“I want to believe you,” Draco admitted. Harry took a step closer to the bed.
It also started rearranging the house. He lost a bathroom, and then a cupboard. He wasn’t sure about the sitting room, as there seemed to be four or five, but one day he went upstairs and had lost the master bedroom. He thought maybe the house was making room for him — it had, after all, provided a microwave one morning, although it seemed dubiously made, and had buttons with gilded cauldrons and other mysterious settings. One filled the kitchen with a fragrant smoke, one Transfigured anything inside into popcorn, and one didn’t seem to do anything - until he tasted the meal he’d made and discovered that it tasted exactly like a Big Mac.
hit. “I thought I’d practice with a bludger and when it got me I realized there was no point running Quidditch drills without Ron, anyway. Plus you could have saved my nose.”
And Draco, finally, answered “no.”
He explored the upstairs afterward. For some reason he’d thought there would only be bedrooms up there, but there were other rooms as well — little studies, opulent restrooms and saunas and some kind of observatory. There was an owlery in a corner tower room, empty now, and a room that seemed like a sort of homespun Quidditch museum. Harry recognized Draco’s broom, with a jolt. He hadn’t ever thought he would recognize it, and there it was, displayed on the wall like a relic from someone long-dead.
Draco blinked at their surroundings. Harry had Side-Alonged him to the telephone booths outside Angel Station, and they were squashed in close. Behind Draco’s head, a red bus rattled down Islington High Street. He followed Harry onto the pavement, brushing against him without comment, then stopped to look around. Harry wondered how it looked to him, a pharmacy and a Pret and an HSBC. But all he asked was “where are we?”
Harry laughed at that and tilted his face to the side, where Draco was smirking. “Don’t act like I’m the weird one for taking my clothes off when I thought I was alone, but you’re not the weird one for spying on me.”
“Probably.” Harry reached for the bottle, and Draco passed it over. They’d given up on glasses a long time ago, and now the moisture of Draco’s mouth on the lip of the bottle was a part of the ritual.
Draco stood up and approached him. For a moment they were standing a foot apart, studying each other steadily. Harry remembered, suddenly, the first moment he’d seen Draco across from him in the manor, how it felt like a ghost dream. It didn’t feel any more real now.
“Playing hard to get, more likely.”
He was leaving a trail behind him now, pillows tossed to the floor, chairs knocked over as he searched under desks. Somewhere, there had to be some proof
“You will.”
But he simply couldn’t be dead. For whatever reason, some instinct Harry couldn’t explain, he would have bet his magic on it.
“Harry never questions his gut,” Hermione said gently, and Harry didn’t argue, because it was true. “He’s usually right, but ah, his judgement may not be entirely… let’s say objective.”
“War makes strange bedfellows,” she agreed.
he mouthed at her.
“There’s no one to tell,” Draco snarled, throwing his hands up. He still had his wand in one hand, and Harry stood up, cautious. “You fucking loon. Just leave before the house decides it’s yours now, and don’t tell anyone I’m here.”
Two flights up he heard the water. Part of him sagged with relief and a little embarrassment - he’d just caught them in the bath, of course he had - but it was still hard to shake his awful feeling. He would just check in, he told himself. Knock and say he’d been by and offer to come back later.
Harry blew them a kiss, and they popped into nothingness. The summer air rushed to fill the space they’d been, a hot gust brushing past Harry’s cheek like the touch of someone’s fingers.
One of the peacocks shrieked. It split the air like a real scream for an instant, and all three of their heads snapped up at once.
“No one doubts you,” Williamson assured him. “I’ll be straight with you, Potter.”
Harry turned hot and red and angry, turning uselessly away to leave them their moment. He hated himself for being jealous, but he was, the morning’s peace stolen away from him in another cramp of anxiety. He was happy for Draco, and couldn’t imagine being kept away from Hermione, but it had meant everything to him, being Draco’s confidant
“The house likes you,” Luna said, hours later, when they had decorated the hallway with garlands and eaten a quick stir-fry. “It’s giving you popcorn, and it didn’t move this room back after you changed things.”
Good old Ron. Without a Horcrux weighing on him, he could always set his anger aside in favor of his loving side. He was more of a Molly than an Arthur, although Harry would never tell him that. He glanced at Hermione, who raised her eyebrows.
Harry couldn’t stop laughing, now that he’d been found out. Tears were leaking from the corners of his eyes as he wheezed for breath, even as Draco’s foot lashed out and found his shin under the table. “If you’re not… cheating… you’re not…. oh my god.” He kicked back, and then the board did get knocked over as they were drawn into an entirely immature battle.
“Whatever you want,” Harry assured him, his chest seizing with something he’d never known before. “You name it.”
Something twisted in Harry, that same familiar ache. He loved Ginny, and he loved Dean, and he was happy for them both. Part of him wondered if he was just jealous that they’d been together at Hogwarts while a locket seared his chest in the Forest of Dean. It made him feel a little foolish, thinking that everyone down to Malfoy had seen it happening. “I felt bad leaving Hermione tonight,” he said instead. It was nice to confide in someone, even if it was only Malfoy. It wasn’t like Malfoy would tell anyone.
“Now do you believe me?” Draco asked, quiet.
“Shh, no,” he whispered, tugging Draco down into a seat with him. The theater was near-empty, and onscreen a woman was selling her diamonds at Rick's Cafe Americain. “This is old. It’s before they figured out how to use color and it takes place during World War 2. In Morocco.”
Because he’d been about to say, “I’m not going to let Draco’s ghost disappear.”
“Bring whiskey next time and I’ll be more careful,” Ron grumbled in response, and Dean laughed, his eyes squinting into slits. Dean was so handsome, really, so comparatively uncomplicated, and Harry didn’t — couldn’t — blame Ginny one bit.
Writing this is sooooo self-indulgent for me! I'm sorry if it's slow going.
“Looks like you’ve been brawling with Malfoy,” Ron added, popping in with what looked like an entire turkey leg in his hand. “Cor, do you ever wish that fucker was still alive just so you could punch him again?”
“First off, she’s not just your girlfriend, she’s also my best friend, so shut the fuck up.” The washing-up clattered into the sink behind them as Molly retreated to the far side of the house, and the suds splashed Harry’s jumper. He flicked the bubbles at Ron. “And so are you, this isn’t about that.”
Instead he said “Okay.”
“Er, hello.” He was sure he would have remembered the new Auror if they’d met, but Hermione had warned Harry a thousand times that it was rude to ask people if you’ve met them before. It had been part of a common Hermione-lecture about learning how to live in the public eye. He rather thought she hadn’t meant hiding out at Malfoy Manor, but at least he could smile and nod at this Auror.
Harry agreed. He did hate being recognized, but more so, he wanted Draco to feel comfortably anonymous, especially if being seen with Harry Potter wasn’t a part of that. Draco’s wand felt warm on his scalp, and when it was drawn away, he had to try not to shiver. “Okay?”
“So you did.” Hermione sent all of Ron’s things flying back into his drawers and Levitated his suitcase onto the dresser to await further clothes-sending. Then she dipped into her bedside table and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.
“Just stay here,” Ron continued, as though Harry hadn’t argued. “Mate. Just go over there to work on the place or whatever — or hire professionals, honestly — and sleep here. This is your real house, come on. ”
“They like me more than you,” Harry insisted, and considered the temptation to drop Malfoy’s leaves. He imagined them being scattered across the ground, and then thought of the hair stuck to Malfoy’s cheek, and kept walking.
“Good, good,” the blond repeated. Williamson stepped inside with him, giving Harry an apologetic half-smile.
“You’re so
“Oh no.” Draco’s black shirt was twisted and stretched from Harry’s hand. It was getting dark outside now, twilight coloring everything differently than they had looked a few charmed hours ago. It was a colder light, matched by the cooling air, the ice cold flint of Draco’s most Malfoyesque expression. “It’s hilarious.”
. What was he even thinking about?
At one point Harry looked over and Draco was crying, silent tears just barely escaping his lower eyelashes to his underfull cheeks.
“You good?” she asked, and shifted Harry over to help, taking over the pan where he’d been babysitting a cooking roti. She flipped over the one that was sizzling into solidity, adjusted it, started forming another. Harry nodded and relaxed, though he hadn’t realized he was tense, the cool buzz of her magic familiar beside him.
Draco nodded once, then again, more decisively. “Okay.” He still looked fearful, but determined, and Harry wondered how many childhood rules he was breaking by agreeing. “Okay, let’s go.”
“What about what I want?”
“But would I?” Ron mused, and grinned when Harry elbowed him. “I could come over there to fly, I suppose. Or we could just go to the Burrow, I know it’s your space or whatever.”
The guilt set in two days later, right before the Gryffindors descended upon Malfoy Manor.
“And sister,” Harry said absently. He got up to cast a Lumos, turning on the porch light so the delivery man would have a chance at delivering to their address. They would think they were dropping the bag at an abandoned house, but Harry was willing to take that risk for his eggrolls.
Harry put the bottle down — very carefully. “Is that a Bowtruckle?”
At least not anything but “Last one in is a Flobberworm.”
“If you don’t get fired.” Harry pulled out the container of chicken and dumplings, which was blessedly full under its stasis charm.
“They would have kicked out Voldemort and started family counseling? Draco, you did what you could. I think they were probably scared, too. None of you wanted to lose each other, and I don’t blame you for that.”
He was already worried about him, missed him, wanted to chase him back to the manor and shout at the walls that he was sorry. But he’d meant everything he’d said. Everything he’d done. And as much as he wished he could take back the memory of their brief, frantic kiss, it was already too precious to ever let go of. No matter how Draco had reacted.
“That’s more like it,” she admonished, and tossed a lump of something from her pile into the flames. Harry snatched it out, dusting off his nearly-clean Weasley sweater. “Give that a Scourgify and we’ll see you about five.”
“It’s not up to you,” Robards snapped. “I want to talk to everyone in this room individually."
“Do you think I’m hiding?” he asked, surprised, but she just shrugged at him in her Luna way before departing, a bottle of antique wine in each hand.
“It’s a hamburger. Like a hot sandwich with a beef patty.”
It felt good to touch. He pushed his hair back in time to feel his nose crunch under the base of Draco’s palm, to see the split lip that he’d somehow already caused. He swore, and Draco smiled, his savage grin dripping blood.
“You were cooking?” Harry picked his foot up, saw flour on it, then sought out Draco’s eyes. They were darting about, looking for an escape, but then the words burst out of him, hurried after hours of keeping his head down out of his freezing fear.
The bell jingled behind him again on the way out, but this time it unsettled him. The world was cruel, he knew that, but it did truly seem like no one cared about Malfoy being alive. Except him — only no, did Harry actually
“Harry, you let the birds
Harry jerked up. “Accio glasses,” he whispered, willing them into his hands and shoving them onto his face before looking around. Fuck. Here he was, no pants, no wand, caught throwing a tantrum in front of… who? Whoever had stolen the wand in the first place? One portrait dozed, another pretended not to notice his nudity. There was no one else there.
“It’s not that stupid,” Harry argued, mostly out of habit this time. Hermione and Ron had returned with the Grangers a couple weeks back, and had stayed with them for a week before spending another week with the Weasleys. They were finally settling in at Grimmauld, though, and Hermione’s last few boxes had been brought over that morning.
“I’m not-” Harry almost said
had just died.
“I wouldn’t have believed it could get worse if I hadn’t tried myself,” Draco agreed, and gave the hovering tangles one last pat. “Now make some food please.”
“We talked about this, I’m very persuasive.” From now on? Harry’s heart hurt with fondness. He was still convinced that Draco would turn cold on him — truly cold, and not the prickly wariness he’d grown used to. But despite his ranting, Draco still let him get up and approach him, walking forward until he had his chest pressed up against Draco’s back, their reflections utterly unmatched in the mirror. It was becoming second nature to do this, to form himself against Draco’s body, to marvel at the fit.
Harry frowned. Lucius and Narcissa had clearly loved each other, it was true, but it was odd to compare them to Ron and Hermione. And did Draco mean they had left him out of their bond? He’d always thought the Malfoys were a trio. Either way, it was sad that Draco didn’t have them anymore, either to complete the trio or to welcome him in.
Instead he went all the way downstairs and flooded the dungeons.
he came back?
to him, to stalk and shadow him year after year. Hermione’s words about obsession echoed in Harry’s head, just hours old, and here was the proof. Harry ran his fingertips along the jagged, pale lines that looked like something had ripped out from inside of Draco, cutting him open in a way that even Snape hadn’t been able to heal.
“Take this,” Hermione said, reappearing. She was holding a bundle of his things to her chest, and Harry was distracted as soon as he spotted the contents of her armload.
“I think it was worth it,” he said finally, deciding for the deceased Malfoys. “You’re here, aren’t you?”
Harry held on tight, the tenseness between them transformed, Draco’s jaw cracking when his mouth opened wider. Harry ground down, experimentally, the off-balance cramp of his knees nothing compared to the hard, thrilling heat below him. Draco made a dark sound he’d never made before, one he didn’t seem likely to have made on purpose, and Harry repeated his seeking motion.
Immediately Harry tensed, stale adrenaline picking up where it had left off in his body. A million possibilities sped through his mind as he went up the stairs, pulling his wand out without taking his eyes off what was above him as he climbed. He passed a book on the floor, and then another. A hole in the wall he hadn’t seen before.
“You weren’t doing well without me,” Harry pointed out, wounded.
Ron glanced away, and Harry didn’t let his eyes go to him.
Together they creaked down the hall and stepped outside the grand doors, leaving them ajar, light following them onto the wide marble porch. Draco reached out with one hand and snagged the narcissus as they passed, the flowers tumbling through his curled fingers and before springing free.
And now he had it, his hips meeting Draco’s tensed-up thighs, his dick wrapped almost painfully within the strength of Draco’s body. Draco’s eyes were still open, and they met Harry’s steadily when he managed to look away from the meeting of their bodies. Harry stretched over him slowly, shifting bit by bit until Draco raised his eyebrows, discomfort and demand at war on his face. “Well?” he asked, squirming in a way that gave away the discomfort that his words didn’t.
Draco sighed and kissed him back slowly, and the brush of their foreheads together made Harry want to cry. It felt like a culmination, no matter how many fights were in their future. He let his hand slide down from Draco’s cheek to his neck, and then pulled back, letting them both breathe.
“I was right,” Luna said. “That
“And me?”
“The ones I have don’t seem to mind. But, truthfully speaking, there aren’t many. A few old school friends. My favourite ones though, are the ones married to Muggles. They like that I can offer both magical and Muggle approaches, especially for their children.”
“I know you don't, you sappy fool,” Draco said.
A bright pink seahorse regarded Draco from the nearest painting. It was, as far as Draco could see, a nonmagical painting, and yet as he walked across the room it seemed to follow him with his eyes. He turned his back to it.
Draco hesitated. “I suppose so. Harry.”
"What?" said Malfoy, his attention snapping towards his robes. He frowned and began to unbutton them, but Harry placed a stilling hand over his fingers.
“Sometimes I think that Muggles are capable of a little magic of their own.”
“There’s always one of them here.” Harry walked over to the window, trying to avoid the driving rain but getting wet anyway. “Actually, this one’s new.” He checked it for messages, but it bore none. Its feathers were very ruffled, as though it had flown through a storm. It hopped onto Harry’s finger when he held his hand out, the sharp talons making Harry wince. But then it looked up at him with its big black eyes. “Hello, lovely,” he said.
“That’s ridiculous,” Harry said, but then he saw the twinkle in Zabini’s eye and realised he was teasing them, and laughed.
to himself. The others might think he was mad for insisting she had her own room, but it was his house, and he could do what he wanted in it.
“I’m not scared of you.”
“Yes, but what I want to say is that I’ve changed my mind about him. He’s not as uptight as I thought, and he’s done so much for Hermione’s confidence about cooking. I can’t believe she’s making the Christmas meal this year.”
Draco hated to admit it, but as he’d woken early they were finished tending to the vegetables sooner than usual, leaving plenty of time to spend in and out of the water.
“No. More of a sideways movement before the upward flick.” Draco motioned with his hand as he spoke. Harry had a go but Draco  shook his head. “Look, like this,” he said, bringing his hand to Harry’s arm.
"Just help him," came Malfoy's terse reply.
Harry’s world narrowed down to the throbbing in his trousers, the hand on his back, and every movement in front of him. He saw the way that Draco touched him, the tenderness with which he brushed Harry’s hair away from his eyes. He watched as Harry reached up to grab Draco for a messy, hungry kiss. He groaned himself as they moved on the bed so that Draco could wrap his long fingers around Harry’s red, hard cock. When Harry came, and then Draco, Harry was near to coming himself. Draco’s hand had stopped moving on his back. He glanced over and saw parted lips and widened eyes, and cheeks, hot and flushed. Draco’s head turned, and he met Harry’s gaze.
Pale skin and pink nipples: it felt intimate enough seeing Malfoy reveal himself like this, but then Harry saw the silver lines on Malfoy’s chest. He reached as though to touch them, then paused. Malfoy didn’t move, his hands holding his shirt open, and his gaze direct. Slowly Harry’s hand inched forward, and then he touched Malfoy’s skin, his finger tracing one of the scars.
“Ah, Kreacher, thank you.”
His sweat stung in the cut on his arm, and Draco’s skin felt almost raw and prickly in the heat, but he focused on hauling himself up. If he could only get a little higher, he would be able to see above the forest canopy, and maybe work out where he was. He moved his foot to the next branch up, pushed up, and twisted his body so that his thighs ached and his side pulled but he could finally see past the top of the tree.
“I’m getting my wand.” Harry got out of bed and felt his way to the dresser where he’d left his wand when he’d got ready for bed. He cast a Silencing Charm and the muffled sounds of shouting ceased.
And then there were the rules of society. Courtship – Draco blushed and mumbled slightly when talking about this – welcoming a new baby, even the selection of schools seemed to be built on a set of rules that had previously been completely hidden from Harry.
“Yes please to the tea,” said Potter. “And I think… we can use the best tea service.”
“Cake. Right.” Draco sounded uncertain. “Look, I’m sorry if this ruins your Saturday—”
“Yes, that too.” Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm and steered him towards the bar. “Two pints, please, Tom.”
Potter waved his hand. “Illegal sales. Knockturn Alley.”
“Corruption, cheating, revenge: this could be due to any one of a number of reasons.” Potter sighed and stared morosely at his cup of tea. “Five Stadiums. All the ground staff. And that’s not even the players or officials! This is going to take ages to sort, isn’t it?”
With this resolution to steady him, Harry took a drink and made an effort to join in a bit more.
“But at Henley’s it would be possible to take them off,” Potter pointed out. “Anything could happen in those rooms.”
“You’re putting a lot of faith in my abilities.” Harry frowned as a new thought occurred to him. “You didn’t just say yes because it was a chance to go out with your own personal bodyguard, did you?”
“I disagree. Let’s get a cup of tea – and some cake – and we can talk about what we know so far.”
“Let’s look at the bedrooms!” Ernie said. “Come on.” It was as though his words gave permission to everyone in the room to move. Harry, who was nearest the door on the left, turned the knob and held it open.
"One of your ever-so-charming relatives," said Harry. "Or at least her portrait. It's stuck up there with some kind of Permanent Sticking Charm, and er, well, just draw back the curtain to see why she's usually hidden." Malfoy regarded him with eyebrows raised, before turning and pulling back the threadbare velvet curtains with a flourish.
“We drink our tea. And don’t complain, that mug’s not even chipped.”
“I’m sure you’re not up to anything at all,” said Harry, also wriggling into a more comfortable position. He yawned; he was beginning to feel a little drowsy.
“Yes. Why don’t you get them? They should have cooled by now.”
“That reminds me: Dudley has a nickname for him. Calls him ‘Dick’.” Harry grinned. “It’s short for ‘dickhead’.”
"Thought I'd be a bit of knob, didn't you?" asked Harry with a smile. Malfoy looked up, his eyes lit with amusement.
A feeling was growing in Draco, a hard, tight sensation in his chest. He was, he realised, fucking livid. “You bastard!” He poked Henry in the chest, shoving him backwards. “I fucking hate my job! You made me work as a fucking servant, a house-elf!”
“Let’s eat,” George said. “We can have some of my nearly-as-good-as-mum’s roast potatoes, and the rest. After pudding I’ll show you.”
Beyond his mother’s head, Draco could see a glimpse of the colourful blooms of the garden. He didn’t ask after it, for this year it had finally passed onto the list of things not to mention. The roses climbed wild, fallen petals littering weed-filled grass. When he left the Manor later that afternoon, Draco took care to avoid the old rose garden.
Malfoy nodded. He held his wand aloft, and closed his eyes. His mouth became a thin line, and there was a pause before he said, “
“You’re only jealous because you’d like the medal for doing Harry’s hair,” Millicent said to Zabini. It amused Harry to see Zabini touch his own hair; he obviously thought a lot of his own skills. “Maybe you could help him with his clothes instead.”
"I did."
“I know,” Malfoy said. “If I don’t get a chance to poke at you a bit it doesn’t feel right.” He was still smiling, looking younger as a result. “Come on.”
himself again. “You do. Gigantic, pureblood stick” He grinned. “I would say you always have, but I think you’ve got worse. You’ve added
“You really have some issues with Malfoy, don’t you?” Ron said, once they’d settled down with their butterbeers. Harry sighed. He’d thought that his friends would avoid talking about it, but he’d obviously been wrong.
“I’ll just clear you some space in the wardrobe, then I’ll let you settle in.”
He felt it with every touch-starved hormonal part of his body.
Malfoy didn’t answer, but Harry noticed how pale his hands were as they clutched the Butterbeer.
“Well, you’re here now. You and half a field. You also smell.”
“It’s just… twenty-four memories is rather a lot,” Harry said, as gently as he could. “I don’t think I can just sit here and watch them all, especially with you… worrying away next to me.”
"Yes! No... I don't know," said Harry. He gave an experimental stretch, and there was still a dull ache, but it was nothing like it had been before. "To be honest... I think that my house is trying to kill me."
He didn’t realise that the broom was sinking through the air until the first brush of a branch against his calf. Draco opened his eyes in alarm: he was sinking fast into the trees. He grabbed hold of the broom righted himself, then swung back up to see where he was. A glint of light caught his attention: deep in a rocky gorge, a rock pool, bigger than a cabin and fed by three waterfalls.
“Seeker’s games.” Draco stared out onto the moor. “I realised that I’ve been spending all these years making Snitches, watching Snidgets, but I don’t even watch Quidditch anymore, let alone play.” Draco turned back to Harry, bringing out the broomsticks he’d shrunk and put in his pocket. He returned them to their full size, and held one out.
“No, it’s nothing like that.” Malfoy pushed the hair out of his eyes. “No one told me to do it. I… I haven’t been welcome in the wizarding world. So I decided I should try to live as a Muggle. Not just with Muggles, but as one.”
That night seemed both clear and jumbled in Harry’s memory: Dumbledore drinking that foul potion in the cave, his cursed arm, Malfoy on the tower, Snape and Dumbledore. The swell of complicated feelings that arose whenever Harry thought of his role in Dumbledore’s death - the lake, the potion, the fake locket, all of it - and then Snape, who had loved his mother always but who had been so cruel to him and his friends, washed through him. It left him saddened, as it always did. He forced it all away, not wanting to share any of it - not even a sigh - with Malfoy.
Draco felt himself preen at the idea that he was one of the special people who did, as though he were fifteen not nearly thirty. A smidgeon of shame fluttered across his awareness that he was, again, acting like a teenager around Potter, but one glance at Potter’s big stupid open face, full of enthusiasm, and he decided it didn’t matter. Bloody Gryffindors, this was how they got you in the end: their boundless energy and earnestness.
“I was angry, at my daughter, at her husband, for a long time after they died. How could they leave their little baby like that? How could she leave me like that?” A fierceness broke through in Andromeda’s voice, and for a moment Harry could see how she had stood alongside her sisters in her youth. “But time… it doesn’t change things, exactly. I've got a Dora-shaped hole in my life, and I always will. But I’ve also got Teddy, with his jokes and his love of brooms, and his warm hugs at the end of each day.” She stood, and walked to the window, peering through the dirty panes. “The view looks the same,” she said, “as it did when I was a child. Except the trees are taller.”
"She says she’s coming, on Sunday—"
“Oh.” Harry shifted in his seat. “I am sorry about that. I was—”
Draco attempted to sit up, and unlike the day before, it was possible without too much grunting.
“It’s all very new, then,” she said, a look of understanding crossing her face. “Oh, Harry.”
Draco looked up at the door, noting that it was firmly shut before continuing with the article. It was a tale of woe from one of Potter’s rejects. This time, a woman. As usual it was a compelling mixture of prurient detail – massages, this time – and disgusting self-pity: ‘I thought it was love’. The line about the massages drew Draco’s attention. He
“Cooking? Cleaning? I’m afraid I don’t really have any experience of either of those.”
"Yes?"
“Reduced to tears,” Blaise said in his sonorous whisper.
As they staggered to the toilets at the back of the pub, a loud group of people came through the main doors.
The trees swayed in a light breeze as they walked through the park, and Draco hugged his coat a little closer. Draco’s hands were sensitive to cold weather, probably due to the amount of time they spent getting hot and sweaty while he worked, but still he regretted that it wasn’t a little cooler. It would have been… interesting to check Potter’s reactions to his other pairs of gloves.
Draco looked rather as though he wanted to sink into the floor, but Harry kept a tight grip on his hand.
He cleared his throat. “Anyway, they were fine with it. And… I also told them that I liked you, and you liked me back.”
When Pansy put the glass down on the side table, her eyes snapped up.
As Draco worked he was aware of Potter in the room, first standing, then finding a stool to his left and sitting down. Draco’s focus on his work remained tight, yet Potter was always there, like a shadow at the edge of his line of sight. No, not a shadow – a pair of eyes, watching him. The back of Draco’s neck grew tight under Potter’s scrutiny, and a fine layer of sweat built on his brow as he tapped away.
In the morning, he walked into the living room dreading what he would find. Draco was sat at the dining table, pale, pinched, arms crossed, and the box of index cards in front of him. The crumpled green card sat beside it. It reminded Harry, painfully, of how Draco had looked the first morning when he’d gone through the house rules. Had everything that had passed since then come undone?
He felt rather than saw Harry shake his head, and the shuddering in his breath as he did so.
She smiled proudly. “Caramel and Gherkin.”
“I don’t know if you understand what it means to me, to have this, here, with you,” Draco said. “But for the first time, maybe ever, I feel I can be a more honest version of myself.”
“You don’t think I’m a crazy-owl-man, do you?” Harry asked Bertie, the long-eared owl. Bertie raised his ear tufts in horror at the suggestion, then hooted and sidled over to the Eddie on the floor, who was playing with the jellied mice. He snatched one up, then flew up to the top of the wardrobe, looking pleased with himself. Beside him Maureen slept on, her heart-shaped face looking peaceful. Her arrival had brought the number of owls in Harry’s attic rooms up to five.
“When I first came here I found myself wanting to reach out and catch them,” Draco admitted, a little ruefully.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy said. “I think we needed to get as much together as possible first.” He took aim at one of the piles he had made, and grinned as he Vanished it. “Plus I don’t think I would have appreciated it as much if I hadn’t done all that sweeping first.”
"Why do I feel so sad?"
Instead of diving in, Harry made the effort to quickly communicate exactly where they’d look. They both had their wands out, making sure they covered themselves and each other. They knew from experience just how fond all their instructors were of Stunners.
“But what if I fall?” Harry said. “I don’t want to injure anything else.”
Harry laughed. “She’s only trying to look after you.”
Granger appeared, a broom in her hand and twigs in her hair. Draco wondered whether there was a tree out there with a Granger-shaped hole in it. "I got separated from Ron, I can never remember which bit we’re supposed to land in, and my legs were all stiff after being on the broom so long, but never mind, I’m sure Ron will find us s—"
Malfoy was breathing heavily by now, and turned away as if to collect himself. Or quell an erection, Harry suddenly thought, and the idea of Malfoy aroused, no matter how unlikely, shot like a bolt of lightning straight to Harry's trousers. His own snake perked up at the thought. Harry decided to give Malfoy his moment, as he was in need of his own, and touched his hand to the door to reenter the drawing room. Before he could grasp the knob, the door clicked and swung open. It seemed the snake knew him now.
Kreacher, bless his little tea-towel toga, had left Harry a vial of hangover potion along with a pot of tea and some toast. It almost made up for the monstrosity of an alarm clock which he insisted on setting for Harry on work days. Most days Harry didn’t mind, but that morning he had tried to Vanish it. Unfortunately, one of the Blacks had laid a complex set of charms on the stupid contraption, and it could not be destroyed. Harry should know: he had tried, on several occasions.
Harry tried to give a reassuring smile. He couldn’t mention the Stunner, it would send Draco into a tailspin.
“What did you see?”
“I know,” said Malfoy, cutting him off.
“You never mean for it happen, Harry. And yet here we are again. You're lucky that Draco isn't more seriously injured. I can't explain away your actions. You know that we can't treat you any differently—”
The two main rooms on the ground floor had been knocked together, bay windows and a marble-framed fireplace in the front half, and narrow French windows onto a shaded garden to the back. The wooden floorboards had all been painted black - many times judging by the patchy, flaky look of them - but the walls were smudgy white. Doors, window frames and skirting board were all painted grey. Overall the effect was one of dull, monochrome light. In what seemed an effort at cheerfulness, a line of cacti lined the top of the mantelpiece, and a tube map was framed on the wall. The sofa facing the fireplace looked squishy and comfortable, but the small sofa and armchair by the window looked as though they’d been pulled from a skip. Harry eyed the small TV set in the corner with greedy eyes; it had been years since he’d watched any television. A small round table and chairs and a blank space where a fireplace would once have been were all that were in the back half, making it a dining room of sorts.
"Prick," said Harry, but then he caught Malfoy's eye, and they both laughed. "Let's just get back to Grimmauld Place," he said.
“Sorry; more stairs,” he whispered, before a young wizard with slicked-back hair answered the door. Draco felt, rather than saw, Potter’s amused glance in his direction. If the wizard’s hair were fair rather than dark, he would be the spitting image of Draco at school.
“There are three wizards living here.”
Harry didn’t want to be talking to Ron about Draco. A large part of him wanted to rush off and find Draco, and… and… his mind drew one of its blanks at what would happen next.
“Do you have any idea what you are like? A big group of noisy marauders, all of you on the right side, none of you having to watch what you say, or question everything - or anything - about who you are?”
“Yes, Miss Granger.”
, and Mum doesn’t know what to do with it. She keeps trying to teach her to cook, and Hermione lectures her on the ideal temperatures for roasting different types of meat, or on the theory behind why potatoes have to be parboiled before you roast them. Mum doesn’t know whether it’s a compliment or not.”
"And there's something else," said Malfoy, slowing to a halt. Harry nodded for him to continue. "I think that I'm going to need some outside help, some advice."
“At school, all I wanted was for it to fly far and high.” Potter glanced over at Draco. “I didn’t want beating you to be
Draco smiled at Ollivander, and it hit him that what he felt in the room, what he felt for Ollivander, and what Ollivander felt for him, was a type of love, too.
“Nonsense. I do this all the time.” Henry shucked his t-shirt, then began to undo his trouser fastenings. A warm glow from the setting sun painted his skin gold. Draco stared, his mind hazy and drink-fuzzed, at Henry’s neat nipples, his dark chest hair, and a small scar above his heart. Henry’s arms were thick and strong, and so was the rest of him. Draco imagined resting a hand on Henry’s torso: it would radiate heat and be solid beneath his fingers. When he’d first seen Henry, singing outside his window and dressed in rags, he would never have thought that beneath it all he looked like this.
“I assure, I know nothing of its current whereabouts. The last time I saw it was when I dropped it off with Potter for minor restoration work.” And Potter had played, and music had filled Draco’s dreams all night as a result.
Harry nodded. Now he’d thought of it, he wanted it more than he could say. He’d half imagined living with the Weasleys after school was over, but the thought of he and Draco with Grimmauld Place to themselves… he laughed.
“As if you’d pass up the chance to take on an extra class,” Ron said, and pulled her into a hug.
“There’s only one way you can find out what he wants you to see, you know that, right? He must have gone to a lot of trouble to organise this. And knowing Draco, he’s put a lot of thought into which memories he’s chosen.”
“Three months?” The minstrel frowned.
Draco’s hand stopped again, and he gave Harry a gentle push. He didn’t resume rubbing, but left his hand resting on lightly on Harry’s arm. Harry was still having trouble with his breathing for some reason.
“I want to go home.”
“No point asking me, I can never understand those clues,” Harry said. “Anyway, I want to show you something.”
"You… I was surprised when Hermione said you were here. I’ve seen you, around Diagon."
"Perhaps," said Malfoy. "Or it could be any one of a number of things. These matters are clouded by the age of the house, and the fact that you weren't born a Black. We need to go back, and take a closer look at your wards. And maybe we can find a way to talk to the house, too..." he trailed off, and frowned. Harry was intrigued by this last statement, but didn't dare interrupt Malfoy when he was so obviously thinking through all the possibilities. They sat in silence, eating their food and interrupted by the odd word escaping Malfoy, who didn't eat much, instead chewing on his lip and narrowing his eyes as he thought it all through.
“You can’t know how I’m feeling.”
“Yes, well, I wasn’t really encouraged to spend time outdoors. Father had very particular views on what a child should learn.”
,” said Draco.
Henry grinned. How dare a man look so charming with dark stubble and clay in his hair like that? Draco swallowed, and turned back to the river. His days might be grim, but these evenings with Henry…
“Don’t be an idiot, Potter, I don’t have time for it today.” Draco’s face was pinched, as though he had a headache. He wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes.
“Go on.”
In the brightness of the day, the blue sky grew above Harry’s head until it threatened to blot out the rest of the world. It bled into the stones of the castle, into the newly-budded trees in the grounds, into the faces of his friends. It was close, too close, to the white peace he’d experienced after death. But how could he explain that to his friends? That he didn’t like the sunshine, as it reminded him of the true peace, true quiet, that he would not know until he died again? How could he explain that it was the memory of the forest floor beneath his cheek, the ground damp and rough, the heady scent of half-rotted leaves and the mulch of earthworms that kept him grounded, that made him feel alive?
“Come on, you’re the hero of the wizarding world. What’s one measly little bit of Transfiguration to you?”
“Ooh, just like the bad old days? Were you in a fight?” She removed her coat and hung it on a stand painted like a giraffe.
His aimless wandering had so far involved walking from one grim high street to another, with long roads of houses all the same in between. This particular high street in south London looked like all the others: pound shops with their wares displayed outside, mops and buckets, stacks of plastic bowls and boxes in every size; chicken shops selling greasy strips of fried chicken; and the odd pub belching out the stench of smoke and stale beer from its etched-glass doors.
“More kissing, I hope,” Draco said. He raised his eyebrows. “A return visit to the Prefects’ bathroom.”
“You do?”
"You were right: you clearly do think highly of yourself," said Malfoy. Harry's cheeks were burning again, but not with embarrassment. Malfoy just didn't make anything easy.
“I’ve done my time in Arthur’s shed.”
again. He was sure there was something in it about false omens. He had scrawled the words ‘When I dream of life without the Dark Lord, does it mean it is a possible future?’ next to the chapter on dreams. Draco traced the letters with a sad smile. Such desperation. He read a section he’d underlined as a teenager.
Ron looked thoughtful. “I’m glad to see you happy, mate. And, er, well you and Draco have always had something going on, haven’t you?”
“My room?” He stood there, his mouth hanging open for a second. “Oh, right.” He turned as though to leave, but stopped with his hand on the doorknob. “Sorry, but what the fuck is going on?”
They had all worked hard this year, he realised, all repairing bits of the castle and themselves as they went. So much had changed, he wondered what life would look like in another year.
"Is that really what you thought? I don’t even know where to start." Harry took a deep breath and sighed. "I haven’t been able to be with them like that in years, and it was all because of
“Yes, I know. Ron reminds me every five minutes. I– I don’t know. He’s not a killer, I know that—“, Harry’s eyes met Hermione’s, pleading with her to understand. It was just all so
Any half-remembered… fascinations, or whatever had driven that need to follow Malfoy around, would have to stay in the past. The reality of Malfoy was that he was impossible to know, impossible to live with. Harry would just keep himself to himself, and leave it at that.
Harry let himself out of her office, and slumped down once he had shut the door. The rest of the year partnered with Malfoy? But as he stood there, he remembered not the punch, but the kiss and the heat that had mingled with his anger. Harry groaned. Maybe he didn't want to be an Auror, after all. This was going to make it too hard: he’d never manage another three months. Not without going mad or killing the bastard.
"Since we are stuck with each other, I suppose I could help you. Enough for you to hear the trees a little, maybe."
Draco exhaled, a little shakily. “You know what I mean.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to laugh. “It was a bit. And we haven’t got to the summer term yet, that’s when it always went a bit pear-shaped.”
"I've checked the whole house for Dark intent, every stick of furniture for curses, and there is nothing present to explain these accidents," said Malfoy.
“What the—”
"I’m… I’m sorry I cut you with that spell."
“You’re stuck to me now,” said Harry. “For the next two hours.” He didn’t have time for pleasantries. “And, er, I’m sorry but you need to put your tea down and come with me. I need to go…” He nodded in the direction of the neat ‘Wizards’ sign on the door opposite.
Harry shoved Draco. “You never.”
He waltzed them to the edge of the room. As the music ended, they bowed at each other, then Harry grabbed Draco’s hand – which trembled a little, he noticed – and pulled him out of the room. The corridor had gazed doors that opened onto a balcony, and Harry and Draco stepped out into the freezing night air.
“Sometimes I think that Hercules here is the only sane person in this house.”
When he came downstairs, he found Malfoy sitting in the garden, staring at the Japanese anemones.
He wrote a few more sentences on his parchment, barely paying any attention to the words. Ink splattered and the nib of his quill broke, and Harry swore. Stupid Draco. He stared at the mess of his work, and pushed it away, suspecting that any attempt to fix it would only make it worse. Instead, he looked over at the Pensieve.
Granger shrugged.  “I’m not sure yet.” She shuffled her feet. “You’re just going to have to be patient while I try to figure this out. And I’m sorry, but I’ve got to go now – I’m supposed to meet Harry at the teashop.”
Draco’s tea was still too hot to drink, so he reached for the nearest patient file instead. Before he could even close his hands over the folder, a chain of events began to unfold in his mind. In his mind’s eye, a chance encounter led to Potter managing to look shy while hinting at his interest with a lick of the lips. A flash of skin, warm beneath Draco’s fingers. A wet mouth on his neck, licking, kissing—
It occurred to Draco that he’d thought Potter’s many walks out among the trees were aimless, but maybe Potter had been collecting wood at the same time. It was possible that Potter lived more purposefully than Draco had originally assumed.
“She’s OK,” said Ron. “But the others…”
He dug his chin into his knees and stared at the flames. "There’s nothing else to give. I’ve tried. I give up."
“Me, either,” Blaise said.
He had gotten to the other corner and was preparing to slice it from the edges of the wall with his wand, when he felt a presence beside him.  Glancing up, he saw the look of determination in Draco’s eyes.  “What?  I may be a pretty face, but if you can be a strong man and do hard labour, then so can I.”
As he stepped off the last step, he looked up and was startled to see a pair of grey eyes staring at him with absolute intensity.  Dread grew in his stomach as he asked quietly, “How much did you hear?”
“Hmm,” he hummed.
“Eh, I’m sure she’s sick of seeing him.  Was over every Sunday whilst you were gone, wasn’t he?”
He read back over the letter still clutched in his hand, and made a split-second decision.
“I didn’t feel like going back to the Burrow, and it was still too early for me to go to Wheezes, so I decided to walk around your neighbourhood.  I’ve never really gone into Muggle London, as you well know, but I conquered my fears and went for a walk.”
“Of course you did,” Draco mumbled.  “I’m ready for the days when he becomes a lazy teenager, and doesn’t wake up until noon.”
Draco smiled, pulling him farther in.  “There are shops over there, food on that side, and the skating rink is towards the back.  There are also some muggle-type carnival rides, by way of the Germans.  Where would you like to start?”
“Well, it appears that we weren’t followed last night.  Nothing at all about us eating out or getting engaged, or anything.  Thank Merlin for that.”
“Fine.  Great.  Wonderful.”  He pulled on his traveling cloak before he grabbed the gifts that he had sat on the coffee table and walked quickly towards the front door.  As he grabbed the handle, Harry spoke up.
Harry drew in a ragged breath, turning to look into Draco’s eyes.  “You counted, too?” he asked in a small voice.
“Are you going to tell me what is going on, now?” Draco asked, putting his hands on his hips.
“Oi, you lot!  Let’s get out of here and let Harry have his house back!”
He quickly shaved and then got dressed.  Before he knew it, he and Draco were standing by the front door waiting on McGonagall.  At exactly 8:30, she stepped out of the Great Hall, with a stack of toast on a plate in her hands.
Rolling his eyes, Harry went to turn around to chastise him, but before he could, Draco had walked up behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
Floating between two buildings, smack in the middle of the main road, was a giant angel, completely lit up with fairy lights.  It was breath-takingly beautiful, and both of them couldn’t take their eyes off it and they walked closer to where it was hung.
“Merlin, will you two just get a room, already?  I’m so tired of watching the foreplay!”
Harry could feel the tension radiating off of Draco as he leaned forward and asked, “Yes?”
“Yeah, yeah.  I missed you, too.  Just ask mother.”
Harry felt lighter than air as he lead the group of his friends up the stairs.  Draco had come back,
Harry sighed, as he wondered the same thing for the thousandth time in the past few days.  “I haven’t heard anything from him.  I…honestly don’t know if I want him to show or not.”
“No, thankfully.  Although, there are still some things to go through, so it’s still a possibility,” he said with a slight shudder.
Harry took a breath and whispered, “I am in love with you.”
Harry smiled at him, pulling Draco towards him.  “Is that right?”  He leant in to give Draco a chaste kiss on the lips.
“All of this to say, I knew you both would want your families and friends to be here for this special moment.”
Harry was quick to duck when Ron threw another pillow at him as he walked towards the doorway.  The trio laughed as they made their way down into the kitchen, where the rest of the family was seated around the table.
“Oh, yes, how was Sweden?”
“Okay, last one.” He reached behind them, picking up the package and setting it in Draco’s hands.
Draco looked up at him and smiled.  “I love you, too.”
Climbing the steps up to the front door, Harry finally released Draco’s hand so that he could take off his glove to open the door.
Draco took a breath, leaning in to lightly kiss Harry.  He blinked slowly, then said, “I’m sorry.  No, it’s fine.  I’ll be right back.”  Draco smoothly removed himself from the bed, leaving Harry and Kreacher in the bedroom.
“Is that…?”
“Yeah, does the Leaky sound okay at, say, 12:30?”
Kreacher appeared with more bottles of champagne, refilling glasses.  Everyone began mingling around the terrace, some moving towards the edges to see the streets below.
“I had no idea.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh as Draco took off his coat, shrunk it and put it in his pocket.  He then unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt, and started rolling up his sleeves.  Harry’s smile slowly slid of his face as the Dark Mark came into view.  Hearing Harry’s small gasp, Draco turned to look at Harry.
“Harry it is.  Draco said you were renovating this house.  I dare say it was in dire need of it the last time I was here, when I was a young girl.  I applaud you for making it a home.”
Hermione sent a look to Ron, which Harry was unable to decipher, before she turned back to Harry and sighing, said, “Very well.”
“Enough.  I just—why?  Why would you say all of that?”
He grabbed Draco’s hand, and pulled him out of the room.  “Come on, let’s go ice skating!”
Draco turned around, quickly kissing Harry, who had wrapped his arms around his middle.  “No, I just got in, myself.  There was a small problem at the Market that I had to take care of.  What do you want to eat?  I can’t decide.”
“Oh, no.”
Draco’s eyes showed confusion before realisation kicked in and his eyes grew wide.  “Shit!”
Once through, they walked to the apparition point.
Harry was thrown off guard as Draco pushed him back to lie down on the bed, Draco straddling his waist.
“Oh, yeah?  I’ll have to file that one for later.”
Harry and Andromeda had made a deal after the war, that she would have him full time, but Harry could come and get him at any time, and he would spend at least one weekend a month with him.  Harry had wanted to make sure that Teddy knew he was loved, and that Harry would always be there for him.
“Is this real life?” Harry asked.
“I still don’t know why that is, but McGonagall was adamant in her letters that the ‘8
“How do you do that?”  Draco’s breath tickled Harry’s neck as the question was whispered close to his ear.
After a few minutes of joking around, Draco squeezed Harry’s hand and then moved around the circle to stand between Hermione and Ron, whispering something to them.  They both nodded and turned to step off to the side of the terrace.
“He drew a hard bargain, but it’s ours!  He said that we can finish our shopping, and he will get it prepared.”
“Absolutely! If she wants to, I’d love for her to have some of it.  I’ve already talked to Andromeda about it, in the off chance that she remembered something from her childhood that she might want, but she was adamant that she wanted nothing to do with it.  So, if your mother wants to come look, I’d be more than happy to get it off my hands.”
She smiled as she looked between them.  “I am truly happy for the both of you.  I am so pleased and honoured to have been witness to it all, and am beyond blessed to have been asked to perform this bonding ceremony.
“What?”
Harry lay in the dark, watching his boyfriend sleep.  A street lamp shone in through the curtains, letting him see a mop of messy blond hair.
“I don't know.  As soon as he left, I came here.” He ran his fingers through his hair, again, resuming his pacing  “Why did I think it could ever work between us?  I mean, this is Malfoy we are talking about.  Malfoy and Potter?  Those names together have always caused people to flinch and look for somewhere to hide, so as not to get in the line of fire.”
“You are so damn beautiful.  Look at the way your hole flutters as I pull this out.  I just…”  He leaned in and licked the skin around the toy.  “Fuck!  I’d almost forgotten how damned good you taste!”
of you were an integral part of the end of the war, and so I feel it is right that you be an integral part of putting together the final touches.”  She looked at all of the students in front of her, but took extra care to notice the four former Slytherins, all looking down at the ground, rosy cheeks adorning their faces.  “I mean it when I say all of you.
Draco started down the stairs again, even more sure of what he needed to do tonight.  He paused again at the bottom of the steps, however, when he realized that the portrait of his great-aunt was visible, seemingly screaming words to anyone that walked past, but entirely silent.  He smiled to himself, impressed with whoever had finally managed to shut her up.
He knew it was his turn to ask, so he glanced around the room, and, leaning over Ginny, locked eyes with Neville.
“It’s nothing fancy, but it’s also definitely not appropriate for polite company.”
~*~*~*~*~
Kreacher came and took their dirty laundry, and they unpacked and laid out all of the gift that they had purchased on their trip.  Draco summoned the rest that he had hidden (sans Harry’s) and placed them with the rest.  He then brought out the beautiful wrapping paper he had bought on his last trip to Diagon, and showed Harry.
After several more minutes of hugs and well wishes, Harry heard a pop and looked up to see Kreacher.  “Supper is served, master.”
“Fucking McKee decided that I looked at him wrong, and he hexed me.  Luckily, McGonagall was turning the corner when he did it, so I don’t think I will have to worry about him any time soon.”  He looked down at his arm and the large, red welt.  It was on his right arm, so it was going to be interesting trying to cast a healing charm.  He never could get anything to work right with his non-dominate hand.
They started walking down the street, towards the closet apparition point.  Coming to the alley, Harry stepped in and stuck out his arm to Draco.  A split second hesitation, and then he was gripping Harry’s arm.  Turning on the spot, they were both twisted away.
Draco took a sip of his coffee, nodding appreciatively.  “No, thank you for coming.  To be honest, I feel more comfortable speaking with you than them.  What exactly did they say?”
He could hear the clunk of Harry taking off his shoes, and them him walking down the stairs.
The day before had been a whirlwind of gathering everything he would need to take to Hogwarts, packing it all into his trunk, and then trying to come up with a name for his new owl.  So far, nothing had seemed right for the majestic animal.  He had found Hedwig’s name in
“You’re going to need a coat, love.  Want to know why?  Because, ‘baby, it’s cold outside.’”  He swayed his hips as he sang the next line, grin across his face.
He took a swig of his drink, letting it slowly flow down until it warmed his stomach.
“Wonderful!  Why don’t we call in some lunch, and we can all sit in one of the conference rooms upstairs.  Being Minister does have some perks,” he said with a wink.  He gestured to them to follow him, as they stepped through a doorway that seemed to appear out of nowhere.  “This will also keep you from having to walk past the journos, which I’m sure you appreciate.”
He stared at Harry for a moment before saying, “I’m sorry.”
“Great.  Then we’ll be off.”  He shrunk the bag again, placing it in his pocket.  “You two can stay as long as you wish.  Kreacher will gladly get you anything you desire, as well.”  He turned to Narcissa.  “And the attic door is unlocked, so you can come and go as you please.”
Harry scooted over just a bit so that he was leaning against the arm of the couch, but his shoulder and Draco’s knee were touching.  If Harry was to tip his head to the side, it would be lying on Draco’s thigh.
“We’re down here!”
“So, what do you want to do this evening?  Go down to the dining room for supper?”
“Are you sure?”
Draco felt a tear slide down his face.  He slid his thumb under is eye to catch it, and then stared at his wet thumb.  He let the tears flow as he tried to figure out what to do next.  Confrontation? Go to a Couples Mind Healer? Just…leave?
They talked a bit about the mission that Harry had been on, and then Draco regaled Harry with tales of the curses that Bill and Draco were chosen to break at the muggle Queen’s palace.
He gently waved back, relief flooding him as he realized she was telling him where Harry was. Mouthing a “thank you” towards her with a nod, he turned and moved towards the stairs.
“Can I call for Nipsy?”
A few minutes later, Ron and Hermione came in.  Seeing Harry seated near Draco, Ron made to walk to the other end of the table.  Hermione sent Harry a pleading look, but he just shook his head and looked back at his plate.  He did not feel like getting into it again with Ron.
“Salazar, yes.  Give me just a moment, and I’ll tell you all that absolutely nothing happened, except they all decided to pled guilty, they got 30 days in Azkaban, and 5 years probation.”
Harry grinned as he nodded quickly.  “Brilliantly!  Thank you for telling me about it!”
“I’m glad.  And I added all of these pillows, which I knew you would love, too.”
“You’d better.”  He stood and pulled Harry to stand.  “I love you so much,” he said hugging Harry to his chest.
The shirt, however was the colour of Draco’s eyes.  Harry knew it as soon as he looked at himself.  From afar, it was just a slate grey, but on closer inspection, one could see streaks of pale blue interwoven in the fabric.  He smiled to himself.  “I love it.  Thank you Mitsy.”  The elf bowed and popped away.
“I can't believe it is almost Christmas,” Harry said.  “I've still got so much to do on the house before then.  This weekend is going to break me.”
“It is.  Are you sure it’s a lump?”
“Uncle Harrrry,” Teddy whined.  “I’m not tired!  It’s time to get up!”
“Really? Oh, that’s so romantic!”  Pansy squealed, as she clapped her hands.
“Indeed.”  He sighed.  “I truly don’t know where to even start.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “Oh, you poor deprived thing,” he said sarcastically.  “You think you had it bad?  With you gone, I had to stay at the Manor.  Do you think I had a spare moment to even dream of a wank?  Not likely.”
“So—.”
He gripped Draco’s hand as they passed his bedroom and opened the door to the attic.  He turned to smile at Draco, noticing the confused look on his, Ron’s, and Hermione’s faces, who were in front of te group.
“Draco, please repeat after me.”
Harry stopped and looked at Draco.  He could see the worry in his eyes.  “Really, baby.  I’m wonderful.  I’ve been taking my potions, I’ve been journaling every night, and occasionally during the day when a stray thought crosses my mind.  I—I even fire-called the Mind Healer a few days ago.”
Harry pulled open another box, and took out the paper and straw that were protecting the five glass bulbs that he had specially made a few years ago.  Draco sat his shoe-box sized box down on the coffee table, and stepped over to Harry, wrapping an arm around his middle.  Harry smiled at him as he picked up the first two.  He stared down at them, gently turning them in his hands.  One had the image of a stag, the other a doe.  They were simple ornaments to anyone that didn’t know what they represented, but if one did, they would see that they shone like Patronuses.
“You’ve got to be kidding!”
“Next step?”
Dean glanced over at his friend, laughing at the befuddled look on Seamus’s face.  Before Seamus could make it bigger, though, another spell was cast at the feather, which grew and grew until it was taking up nearly half the length of the table Seamus and Dean were sitting at.  Dean was lightly snorting, nudging Seamus, trying to keep his laughter in check.  Seamus was again looking at their classmates, trying to see who was doing it.
It was around 2 o’clock when Harry and Draco were finally alone again.
Draco looked down at the book in his hands and then looked back up at Harry.  “I don’t need to read this, love.  I know that I don’t know what you’ve been dealing with, but I know that you are getting better, and that you
Just then a car honked its horn, causing Draco to jump, and hurriedly continue walking.  Reaching the alleyway, Harry pulled Draco into his arms.
“Alright, I’m going.  Thank you so much for doing this, Harry.  I don’t know what we’d do without you.”
Harry nodded, clutched onto Draco, and apparated away on the spot.
“Harry, we just want you to be happy.”
“Please, do call me Narcissa.  Draco has told me about your new-found friendship, and I hope that will extend to me, as well.”
“The only thing you need to do is to sit at the table and be your charming self.”
“Well, who’s ready for presents?”  Arthur had stood, clapping his hands.  Everyone smiled as they stood up, too.  Harry walked around to pick Teddy up out of his chair, calling for Kreacher to clear the table.
In my defense, though, I was sitting on an airplane, waiting to take off, and knew that if I didn't post the chapter right then, I'd forget by the time I finally got home.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, I love you more than life itself.  It took eight years for me to get over my stubborn self and befriend you.  It took three years after that for me to realise that I was in love with you, and then it took three years after that for me to realise that I don’t want to spend another day of my life without you by my side.  Will you do me the honour and privilege of being mine forever and always?  Will you marry me?”
Harry returns after nearly 5 months away on a mission.  He reminisces how he and Draco got to this point.
“Where are you going, mate?”
He finished his essay with a flourish of his quill, and then, after packing his things back in his bag, strode across the room towards their dorm.  As he passed behind Harry, he lightly brushed his fingers across Harry’s shoulders.
Harry had to admit, he liked having Teddy with him.  As he put him in clean clothes, he wondered idly if Andromeda would allow him to have Teddy for an entire weekend at some point.
Harry couldn’t disagree.  It was plush, but didn’t completely sink when sat upon.  It was wide, so he knew he could curl up, and wouldn’t have his extremities hanging off.  It was also really long, so it would be perfect to take a nap on.
“What?”
Draco hummed as he kissed Harry once more before grabbing a pinch of powder and stepping into the fireplace.  “See you later,” he said with a sweet smile, before swishing away in green flames.
Harry walked back into the Great Hall, going to tell McGonagall he was going.  He hadn't told his friends what he was working on just yet, so as he stepped away from the staff table, Hermione came over to him.
“She gave me a week of detention, in which I were to write ‘
were leaving
wanted to live it, and with whomever he wanted, too.
“We’re going to go, but I’m so happy for you both.  We will see you in the morning?”
Looking into his godson’s eyes, Harry realized the infant had changed his eye color to match Harry’s.  He gasped a little, and looked quickly at Andromeda as she walked into the room with a tray of tea and biscuits.  Seeing Harry’s face, she put the tray down and quickly walked over.  Looking between the two pairs of eyes now looking at her, she gasped as well.
“Draco, babe, n-ooohhhhh!” Harry had reached for Draco’s hips to stop him, but he started groaning as he felt the tight heat of Draco’s channel surround him.  He felt a bit light headed as all of his blood fled south, filling his cock as Draco lifted off him a bit and then sat back down, little by little, taking his time until he was completely seated on Harry.
~*~*~
“Okay.  I hope I have everything.”
would have happened if it wasn’t for you.
“Nothing is wrong,” he immediately replied, glancing down the hall as a loud noise descended onto the floor, several of his coworkers stepping out of another lift.
“And why, pray tell, are you watching the telly?”  He takes a deep breath, trying to rein in his anger.  “We are supposed to be at The Burrow in fifteen minutes!”
Both Ron’s and Hermione’s eyes widened as he mentioned Fiendfyre.
“Er, Draco?  Where did this come from?”
Draco wrapped his hands around Harry’s head, pulling him towards himself. As their lips touched, Draco felt as if everything was right with the world.
“What do you mean?”
They skated for what seemed like hours.  They saw several of their school mates, and at one point Hermione and Ron joined them.  After some time, Teddy started to grow restless.  He started whining about being tired, so Ron and Hermione took him to go sit down at a bench, giving Harry and Draco some time to skate alone.
They walked down to the sitting room.  Harry walked over to grab the floo powder, but turned back around towards Draco.
Standing, Harry bent over to check the price tag.  It was just about what he had expected to spend, so he decided that it would be perfect.  Draco had stood, too, leaning over to see what Harry was looking at.
They looked at each other, smiling.  Harry went over to the wizard that was working the booth, asking about the tree.  Draco stood back, admiring the tree, and imagining it set up in the sitting room, with the ornaments that Harry had purchased his first Christmas at Grimmauld, and the ones that Draco had acquired the past few months in the hope that Harry would be back home in time for the Holiday.
“Me, too,” Draco said, placing the picture behind him with the others, and then turning to sit facing Harry. He paused a split second before pulling his hand from Harry’s and placing it on his cheek. He whispered a soft, “Thank you,” before leaning forward and kissing Harry.
Draco hugged Harry back, sniffling.
“I am, too,” Draco whispered against his finger, causing Harry to smile.  “Very much.”  He took a breath.  “About last night…”
Before he reached Draco’s lips, however, Draco had slipped from underneath Harry and gotten off of the bed.  Harry sat stunned for a moment as he saw Draco quickly getting dressed.  Had he done something wrong?
Harry laughed loudly before asking, “And, where are we going? What are we doing? Do I have to cook?”
Harry gently kissed Draco, as he lightly scratched his back.
“Your thoughts are loud, you know that?”
Harry was stunned silent for a moment.  What in the hell was going on?
“You promise?”
They quickly descended the stairs.  Walking into the sitting room, Draco noticing McGonagall and Narcissa were sitting in the two chairs beside the fire, which just left the sofa for the two men to sit on.
Hardy nodded, taking the cup and saucer that was slid across the wood surface.
Harry tilted his head slightly, watching as the man walked away, but turned to smile at Draco with a shake of his head. He then turned back to the crowd and started speaking.
Actually, it appeared as if they both had had plans compiled for quite some time.  Narcissa had brought over a notebook a few days after the party that was full of colour palettes, flower ideas, wizarding venues, and so much more.
He grabbed a big, white, fluffy towel, quickly drying off.  He wrapped it around his waist before he held out his hand to Draco, who slowly took it and climbed out of the tub.  “What’s wrong?” he asked.
Draco groaned as he turned over.  “What time is it,” he groggily asked.
“Potter, I don’t—”
He took another sip of his firewhiskey, and continued to scan the room, taking in all of the friendships that had formed in the few months since the war.
Harry just smiled at him.  “How did you get in my bed without anyone seeing you, by the way?”
“It looks even more amazing than I could have ever dreamed!  She’s going to love it!  Thank you, sir!”  Ron was grinning from ear to ear.
Casting a charm on them to float behind him, he made his way up the stairs to the study, grabbing several pieces of parchment, and a couple ballpoint pens.  He had been so glad when they had finished Hogwart’s and he could introduce a few muggle inventions to his friends.
“Harry, we know you.  We know that look.  This is
“Er, well, okay, that would be great.  Um, there’s just one thing.”
“Oh, yes, Ron did mention that you had become friends.  I’m so glad.  I know his father has done some terrible things, and he was forced into a lot of it as well, but he was just a boy.  You all were.”  She sighed, turning back to the stove.  “I’m proud of you for letting bygones be bygones, and moving forward with your lives, though.  Will he and his mother be joining us today?  There will be plenty of food.”  She glanced back at Harry.
“Harry asked her to bring you?”  Draco was dumbfounded.  Harry knew enough about him to realized he would want his mother there?
“You got us something?”
“Reassurance for what?”
“Do you remember our very first day at Hogwarts, when you refused to shake my hand?  That was the day that I decided to make your life hell.”  Draco looked down at the table.  “The great Harry Potter didn’t want to be friends with
“Good morning, indeed.  Merlin, I’d like to wake up like that every day for the rest of time, if you please.”  He pulled him down into a deep kiss, tasting himself on his tongue.
The next morning, they woke up and called for room service.  They took their time in eating, enjoying the immense pancakes that they had ordered.
“A protection spell.  No one will be able to desecrate this place ever again.”
.  And besides, there are so many Weasley’s, it would get confusing.”
“No worries, mate.  I’m going to send Draco on home, though.  I’ll send him through one of the emergency floo’s.  Here, I’ll let him talk to you.”
“Well, I painted them.  We went on a trip, and got to paint cups and plates and stuff.  I painted a vase for Nana for her flowers, too.”
“I wouldn't dream of it.”
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m SO FREAKING SORRY!!
“I was secretly hoping that people would just let us be.  Blind optimism, I suppose.  I don’t really want to know what those say.  I know what people think of me.”
Harry, who was just finishing up his last Charms assignment, thought that once he was done, he would go down and send a letter to Molly.
Harry pulled a piece of parchment out of his shopping bags, and wrote down the address.  “Um, please memorize this, and then I can destroy it.  I have a Fidelius charm on the house.”
Once he knew Harry had him, Draco lifted himself, wrapping his legs around Harry’s back, forcing his pelvis into Harry’s.  They frotted against each other for several minutes, groaning around each other’s mouths, cursing, and grabbing anything and everything they could reach.
up at him.  Draco looked back at him, and gave him small smile.  Harry decided then that he was going to apologize veraciously the next time they were alone.
“Harry?  It’s time to get up.”
They leant their heads together, breathing each other’s breaths.  They sat there quietly, holding each other.  Finally, Draco pulled back and sighed.
“Love, I’m okay, I promise,” were Draco’s first words, as he answered.
Harry cast a quick healing spell, and pulled him onto the bottom step.  “Well, so much for thinking the article and letters would be the easy part, eh?”
“Yes, she gave you some books, didn’t she?”
Harry readily agreed, and Teddy was immediately sent through the floo.
“Right.”  Harry stood, reaching for the ornaments, and stepped over to the tree, placing them all in the middle of the tree, so they could be seen from all angles.  “We will leave you to it.”  He reached for Draco’s hand, and pulled him up the stairs.
The next afternoon, they prepared for the next three days.  They each packed a bag, and then packed up the rest of the presents.  Draco was never more glad for magic than when he saw a stack of several dozen gifts, and with just a wave of his wand, they all shrunk and fit into a small sack.
Harry leaned over to his boyfriend, (Boyfriend? Is that what they were? They'd have to talk about that at some point) and grinning, chastely kissed him.
He pulled his sketch book out of his pocket, and showed it to the three others.  Draco took a quick look at it, and then scanned the room.
~*~*~*~*~
“I’m too tired to go into it.  Later.”
Hermione nodded, gently pushing Harry out the door.  “Of course.  We’ll meet you there in just a bit.  GO.”
“You, too.”
Harry wrapped his arm around her, pulling her into a side-hug.  “I’m sorry to hear that.  I was looking forward to seeing them again.”
“Shh shh.  Come on love, please.  I hate this.  I hate seeing you like this.  Shhh.”
doing? Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”
“Babe, we can’t have a quickie while our mates are downstairs.”
“Me, too.  Come on, we have just a few minutes until the portkey activates.  Is everything good upstairs?”
Harry took a glass, passed it to Draco, and then took one for himself before pulling Draco with him out of the room.
“It appears that you and Mr Malfoy have a connection.  Without looking at the wand itself, I am not positive as to what extent it is.  However, it appears, from what you have told me happened, that the two of you are linked.  Bonded, if you will.  This means that yes, you can still use his wand completely, but this also means that he can use your wand completely.
Harry loved the size, because he had secretly hoped that one day, he would have someone to share a bath with.  And he’d found that person in Draco.
“I would, but Kreacher was going to cook.  Thank you, though.  I’ll just go see Arthur before I leave.”  Getting up, Harry walked around the table and gave Molly a quick kiss on the cheek.  “See you Friday, Ron.”
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Hermione asked.
Harry dug in his bag, pulling out his journal.  “I need you to know something.”
Harry smirked, gripping his hips and picking up speed once again, which caused Draco to moan.
He was shocked when, as he sat down next to Narcissa, she greeted him with a smile and a small kiss on the cheek.  He quickly reciprocated the kiss, and then turned to face the front, catching Draco’s wide eyes and small smile.  He minutely shrugged his shoulders, nodding for Draco to sit down.
Draco gave him another look, but Harry just winked and picked up one of the trays of drinks, walking back towards their friends.
“You dumped a lot of information on me, Tuesday.  While I still wish you had told me everything when it happened, now that I’ve had a bit of time to think about it, I guess I kind of understand why you didn’t.  I’m sorry I got angry.”
“I’m sorry?”  McGonagall gave him a questioning look.
Harry squeezed his fingers, bringing Draco back to the present.  He squeezed Harry’s fingers in return.
“Piss off!  I just saw the two-seater, and know that while you didn’t get a lot of practice in while you were a child, you did learn how to ride one, and thought that it would be… fun?”
~*~*~
He flicked his wrist, summoning the pile of parcels to sit on the ground in front of him.
“True, but their new seeker will never be able to play as well as the person she replaced,” Harry said with a slight blush.
“Perfect.  I’ll see you later.”  Ron stood, leaning over to kiss Hermione again, and then headed back out into the mayhem.
“Wow.”
Once ready, they shrunk their bags and, after checking to make sure that they hadn’t left anything, they made their way down to the dining room for a quick breakfast before they checked out and met for their portkey home.
He tugged his cloak closer around him, and then waited to be maneuvered wherever they were going.  Who he thought was Hermione took his hand, and he was tugged down what felt like a dirt road.  He felt a hand on his back, guiding him forward.  They walked what he imagined was a several hundred meters, and then was stopped.  He heard metal scraping and people whispering, but couldn’t make out who was talking, or what was said.  He was walked a little way more and then stopped again.
