Persephone thought of that—she could believe that.
Flitwick had her excused from half of Charms class to practice her vocals. She felt everyday she went to bed, her vocals had been torn to shreds for how badly they hurt. She had to visit the hospital wing thrice now for it but there was nothing Madame Pomphrey could do but give her a throat relaxer. It was an endless and cruel cycle.

Fantastic; the conversation was to continue. Draco let his eyes drift up to the rafters. He’d made his apology and was, to his mind, no longer obligated to stick around. The judging stares of the other owls seemed far more bearable than a heart-to-heart with Potter. Especially when Draco was in a form where he might be expected to participate in the baring of souls that Gryffindors surely expected.

tempting. Potter had learned well just how to tickle Draco’s fancy in these months together. He vacillated, though, between feeling flattered at the effort Potter was going through, the logical arguments being crafted—and irritated at being so blatantly patronised. They weren’t children, not anymore. Potter wasn’t going on holiday and looking for a travelling companion. This was the Boy Saviour, darling of the wizarding world, about to make his way into proper society, and he certainly didn’t need the scandal of a Malfoy standing at his side while he did so.

Weasley’s mother, a round, apple-cheeked woman who clearly thought of Potter as one of her own brood, seemed delighted with Potter’s new ‘pet’, hastily wiping her hands on her apron when he entered the kitchen with Draco on his arm. She bustled over and cooed at Draco warmly, calling him a

Draco’s mind was still reeling, too confused to know up from down, and was Potter even speaking English right now? His little bird heart felt like it was about to explode, and something hurt, but he thought—hoped—it might just be strained muscles or bruising. His wings were still spread, flopping about as Potter clutched him to his chest in a mockery of a hug, and this close, with the owl’s keen senses, he could hear Potter’s heart, itself racing.

“…I think I didn’t know how to feel about you. I wanted you to notice me, I suppose. Focus on me. If I couldn’t have you doing that positively, I’d take negatively. It was still you, obsessed with me. And when you didn’t notice me, not the way I wanted you to at least, I told myself I never wanted you anyway, that you were obviously not worth my time if you saw fit to hang about with the sorts you did. Werewolves and convicted felons and—Muggleborns.” He grew very quiet. “I didn’t know how else I could feel, so I decided to feel hate. I’m not proud of it—”
Even his own bedroom seemed somehow too big, too open to the elements. The balcony window he would leave thrown open during summers he now kept shut, locked tight with a bolt and five different warding spells. Three days into the holidays, he found himself wishing he were back at Hogwarts already, tucked away safe in the bowels of the castle with only the peeping eyes of the merfolk peering in through the thick glass windows in the Common Room to worry about.

Somehow more useless than Trelawney, this thing was.
,” he corrected. “Plus I didn’t mean with school, necessarily. I was more wondering about, like…” Harry shrugged. “Life, in general.”
And true enough, as soon as he’d broken the low, dreary cloud cover that blanketed the countryside around Ottery St Catchpole, he felt the same odd shifting of the air around him, his wings parting the breeze with ease and carrying him with a preternatural speed he couldn’t claim to understand. It was difficult to tell how much time had passed, but when an innate tug urged him down through the clouds once more, the landscape had brightened to a dull mid-morning, revealing Wiltshire and, in the distance, the sprawling, snow-mottled grounds of Malfoy Manor.

careful about planting Luna’s gift anywhere near where Draco might go wandering when transformed.
“Asking me not to be ridiculous is a tall order.” He hopped to his feet, pacing the room and its contents. It seemed so…
It being the polite thing to do, he asked Draco, “Fancy a drink? I’m still a little—I dunno, all over the place, from that speech. I think I’ve got the frayed nerves of a ninety-year-old after the year I’ve had…” When Draco didn’t answer, Harry turned back—only to find him standing, stock still, in the doorway. “Draco?”
His bladder made itself known with urgency, so he carefully slid out of bed, making sure he didn’t disturb his partner, and stumbled into the bathroom. He winced as he waddled, sorer than he had expected, considering he’d done relatively little of the hard work the previous night.
Harry winced, wishing he hadn’t been feeling in quite such a giving mood and wanting to reassure Draco that he wasn’t beholden to Harry in any way, something he knew Draco despised. “Er, I sup—”
“Right.” Potter gave a relieved sigh and straightened up. “Everything seems to be in order.” He turned back toward the window, but kept his eye on Draco, gesturing to the now-empty sill. “Did you…just pop in for a visit? Or did you eat a drunk mouse and lose your way back to the Owlery?”

Draco released an angry snort of smoke but did as instructed, awkwardly manoeuvring in the space. He had to practically dance in place, as the holding cell was still too tight for him to pace out a full circle, but he managed it in the end, and Bragge clapped in delight. “Excellent! That’s ‘Understands commands in transformation’ down, then!”
Harry flushed, cutting him a dark look. “That was

Harry drew his pillow from under his head and hit Draco across the face with it, receiving a sharp squawk for his efforts. They tussled for a bit—which led to kissing, which led to hands wandering where they really shouldn’t, unless they wanted to wind up with new aches and pains come morning.

“Right! Right, sorry. And obviously I didn’t mean a
Unfortunately, Draco was about to take aim and drop a wet, sopping dollop of owl shit squarely on his plan.
He took off, keeping his distance so as not to spook the Snitch into fleeing. He would have to hit it on a straightaway dive—it was the only hope he had of gaining the speed necessary to catch the damn thing.
Draco did not want to ‘pop in’, but there was always the promise of more treats if he deigned to favour Potter with his presence, so another evening keeping Potter from tumbling out the window to his untimely (or was it overdue?) death it would be. It was certainly a more enjoyable way to pass the time than listening to Pansy and Blaise bicker back and forth about who was the more promiscuous, a fierce competition they’d been embroiled in since Third Year.

Draco took a step back and shoved his hands in the pockets of his robes. His face still felt hot with anger, and he could feel his blood boiling in his veins. He knew he ought to be angry with
He was startled from one of these naps late one morning when an excited fluffball of an owl dive-bombed him from out of nowhere, missing Draco by a mile and tumbling end over head into the tower. Shortly, it scrambled back up to roost beside Draco, hooting merrily and shifting from one foot to the other with a manic rhythm. Draco eyed it warily, then shuffled to the other side of the tower, hoping to give it space until it decided to move along on its way.
Potter was leaned over, hands on his knees to put himself at eye level with Draco, and behind his glasses, his eyes loomed large and did, at least, seem contrite. “…Are you hurt? If I try and touch you, will you scratch my eyes out?” Draco didn’t honestly know
Potter, for his part, managed to restrain the offence that usually manifested when they had a row and instead just looked absolutely

Draco blinked, frowning. “What?”

as fun when it didn’t really rile Potter up the way he might have hoped it would, but there was still a certain sort of satisfaction, watching Potter’s shoulders slump, or his head droop, or his lips twist into a frustrated moue and knowing it was all Draco’s doing.

He fished the potatoes out from the pantry and gave them a good rinse before going through the kitchen drawers in search of a peeler. When he came up empty, he supposed he’d been meant to use magic for the task (he really needed to learn that Peeling Charm) and instead grabbed a paring knife to get to work.
…Nothing to do but chance it. He took a bracing breath, then focused on keeping a tight leash on the transformation, ready to pull himself back into the owl’s body at the first sign the band wasn’t going to give—

They crawled under the covers still naked, and the sheets were comfortably cool against Harry’s still-flushed skin. He drew up tight against Draco, crotch-to-arse, and Draco threw him a warning look over his shoulder. “If I wake up with your cock poking me in the arse, you won’t appreciate it.”
A cool female voice—the same, Harry reflected, as in the Ministry lifts—chimed at them, “
Potter’s shoulders slumped a bit, and he seemed to grow smaller, fitting back into his Potter-shaped shell instead of the visage of an avenging angel he adopted when he meant to see justice meted out. Draco wasn’t sure which Potter he preferred—the Boy Who Lived, or just the boy. “…I guess I can see that.” He wrinkled his nose. “…What made you go back at all? Why not give it up to the Ministry, after all the nasty shit that happened there? I mean, I get it’s your home, ancestral lands and all that, but…no offence, I always assumed you had, like, three other homes.”
She was dangling, over fifty feet up in the air, with only one small, weak hand to hold her up.
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
A few sniffles later, she asked once more, “Are you dying?”
Persephone tried hard to keep her mind focused on the end of year exams. She was spending lots of time in the library, away from everyone, even Susan, Daphne and Hermione. She liked being alone in the library, but she still kept herself up at night with Hermione and Ron, way after everyone else had left the common room. She was very well off in charms, potions and just in general spells and such. What she needed to work on was remembering dates and keeping herself focused on her work.
But, she didn’t blame him for his worries—the Quidditch season had begun.
She sat on the end of his bed as he sat forward. He looked at his own pile of gifts before he noticed the sweaters, “Oh no.”
“Okay but the bars—”
“Professor McGonagall is brilliant! Only people who don’t understand the proprieties of Transfiguration magic would think of her as anything other than that!” Hermione scolded.
“We have a lot in common then,” She said, “With our names.”
‘Like what secrets?’ She thought as Lockhart walked into the room, clearing his throat loudly.
She was a metamorphmagus, she can change the way she looks but she liked the way she looked. Did she like the way she looked because everyone around her was pleased with how she looked? Pale skin, light eyes? Would she be miserable if she did look more like her father did, with his olive skin, dark eyes and hair? Would she not be pretty? Is that how girls like Hermione, Lavender, Parvati and Diana always felt? Persephone felt sick to her stomach.
The four Gryffindors sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following or if he’d caught Malfoy—they didn’t care for the latter, anyway. They swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Persephone in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going—they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was

“I can’t either but I know what must be done, Georgie…” He cast a long, faux glance filled with heartbreak that quickly turned into determination before they trotted off, leaving a lot of people confused.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
His father, Henry Potter, her great-grandfather was a member of the Wizengamot. He apparently caused a minor controversy by publicly condemning the Minister of Magic of the time about the decision to forbid the wizarding community from helping out in the First World War. He was very pro-Muggle, which took the Potters off something called the Sacred Twenty-Eight. His father’s brother was Charlus Potter, the man who married Dorea Black, the woman Hades had once talked to her about.
Most of the things aunt Petunia made her do bothered her—she enjoyed the ability to do these things, that she could have this tiny piece of independence of being able to cook for herself—but the way she always worded it…
A loud, strange bird like scream started and made Persephone jump, only to find it was another baby, coming forth for attention as well. This time she smiled.
When he left, Ron finally looked at her. She simply smiled and took a bite of her dinner. He stared at her and finally said, “Malfoy fancies you.”
"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" Ron asked, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must have cost you a fortune.”
“Aren’t you two close?” Fred said cautiously.
“Uh, Freddie, I’m named after the god of spring and flowers—it’s in my blood,” She told him. He rolled his eyes.
drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
"Oh, fer sure! Gringotts, the one and only. Run by goblins."
They paused by the balcony, deciding it would look less suspicious if they were five minutes apart. Persephone went first, looking very lowkey as she wandered down the stairs. She recognized the Greengrass family—Estelle and William Greengrass. She smiled as she approached them, “Hello.”
Draco shuddered. “And give my parents

The silence that followed was deafening, more so because Pansy interrupted it with an offended huff of, “
“Lovely dinner last night, wasn’t it?” Hermione said, to fill the awkward silence, and set a plate of toast topped with fluffy scrambled eggs in front of Harry. Draco was already digging into a bowl of his favoured porridge that had been sitting under a Stasis Charm. Harry wondered if stuffing them full of food was her way of warding off any uncomfortable discussions they might need to have now concerning engaging in amorous activities while flatmates were in residence.
Carefully—still wary this was all some sort of a setup—Draco reached for the file and brought it to his lap, opening to the topsheet.
do it?” He looked back to his parchment, then scratched through several lines. “‘In conclusion…while wandless casting…might be more useful in a pinch…nonverbal casting…is easier…for the unstudied witch or wizard…to master.’” He glanced down at Draco, waiting for a reprimand. None was coming; it was a fine enough conclusion, and Draco was not here to do Potter’s homework for him.
“Because it’s going to take us that long to wade through the sea of your fawning sycophants, just to find our table.” Harry would have cuffed him if he wasn’t still shielding his cock. Draco made a shooing motion. “Go on, then. And grab a new pair of pants—not those ratty boxers you’ve probably been wearing since you were twelve.”
“You’re barking,” Harry laughed. “My birthday’s not a
He took a deep breath and eased to his feet—then shifted, whirling down into his little bird body that, just now, felt impossibly fragile and vulnerable. There would be no shitting his way out of this one, if things turned sour.
Draco snorted softly. “At least my reputation can’t possibly sink any lower.”
Harry slipped away, as quietly as possible, and half-jogged to the kitchen. He couldn’t listen to any more—it was

“Harry, watch the milk! Don’t let it burn!” Hermione said, pointing her wand at the burner over which Harry had been absently tending a sauce pan. The flame shrank to a bare flicker.

, but Draco was having none of it and so kept well away. He delivered no more packages for Potter, made no more visits to Gryffindor Tower, and no longer spied on Potter and his pals during their pick-up Quidditch games. He was practically a ghost these days, only out of his room for as long as strictly necessary.
“What’s in those?”
“Watch it,” Draco groused. “Hasn’t there been enough bloodshed here?”
“No, you aren’t,” Draco sighed. “You’re a Gryffindor, which is ever so much worse.”

Potter had spotted him gliding in, though, and was ready—easily snatching up the Snitch the moment it fell within reach. Draco took a long loop around the hall, eyes trained on Potter as he made his way back to the skylight. Huddled amongst the Gryffindor scrum below, Potter held the Snitch close, frowning at the little note threaded through the ribbon Draco had used to tie down the wings when it wouldn’t stop flapping.

Potter leaned back against the tower wall, keeping clear of a white line of owl shit streaking down the stones. “So: why’d you do it?”
was almost clever.
Draco weighed his options—sit around the Burrow all day, with nowhere to go and nothing to do except perhaps try to find Potter’s room and rifle through his things (tempting!) or at least get out and see a bit of civilisation, even if he had to do so as an owl and pretend to be Potter’s stupid pet the entire time. It was a difficult decision indeed, but Potter sweetened the deal with a reminder that Eeylops was having a holiday sale—3 scoops of their Merry Mix treats for 10 Sickles—so he resigned himself to an afternoon veritably stitched to Potter’s shoulder.
Draco released a laughing huff that didn’t sound all that tickled. “Trust you to come at me with the big spells first…” He rubbed a hand over his face, then ran his fingers through his hair—nervous habit, Harry had learned—before climbing into bed.
“Here we go again,” Draco sighed, snapping Harry out of his thoughts.
“Well you’d better learn to want to—else I’m never going to get dressed.”
“And where is

But people would continue to want to express their gratitude, look to him for ill-sought guidance, and there was little he could do about it. He didn’t want to be anyone’s paragon of virtue—look how far Dumbledore had fallen, after all, when people built him up to be more than he’d truly been in life, turning on him viciously at the first sign he’d not been all he was cracked up to be. He just wanted to be
“The shop?”
“Are you going back, then? To the manor.”
Something poked his shoulder, though, and he swivelled his head around, locking eyes with Potter, who gave him a weak wave. “Thanks for keeping me company. And if it’s all the same to you, I don’t think I’ll credit you on my essay. Flitwick would probably want to know who ‘Alabastard’ was, and my sanity’s always been a tenuous thing at this school.”
Lunch with the Malfoys was lunch with the Malfoys, and Harry was willing to bet all the gold in his Gringotts vault that the only reason it was an intimate meal for four rather than an extravagant affair in the ballroom with glitz and glam and a string quartet was because Draco had threatened to cut ties with them altogether if they dared invite another soul. Lucius seemed thrilled for the excuse to focus all his attention on his son, ignoring Harry’s presence altogether, and gifted him a handsome watch. Harry thought it seemed a bit stuffy for a gift, until he recognised the piece as something similar to the one Mr. Weasley had given Ron when he’d come of age—and the one Harry had received from Mrs. Weasley to the same end. Of course; with Lucius rotting in Azkaban for Draco’s seventeenth birthday—and Draco not much better off, drowning in his Animagus studies and fearful for his and his parents’ lives—there’d been no opportunity for traditional coming-of-age birthday gifts.

asked any questions, at least not for a full ten minutes while Thomassen sat, engrossed in a file, so long that Draco wondered if he had perhaps forgotten he’d summoned Draco at all.
The pitch hadn’t seen any fighting, per se, but it still showed signs of the recent battle; the Hufflepuff stands had been demolished by a tree trunk, likely thrown by one of Voldemort’s giants, and the sod on the field had been turned over in long, wicked furrows by wild spellfire. It would need to be retilled and seeded anew before any games could be held, as many of the Curses that had struck the ground had been Dark, killing the grass.
the one out of his mind…”
And then Draco was off, winging his way quick as he could back through the courtyard and headed for the Dungeon—but not before his keen hearing picked up the faint strains of Weasley, sleep-drunk and raspy, asking, “...Did you just smuggle an owl into our room?”
, and for once in his life, comfortable in the weight of experience, Draco wasn’t worried about embarrassing himself in front of Potter. Nor, though, was he preoccupied with the urge to outshine him, to lord his superiority over Potter with a porcelain sneer carved to a fine shine over many a generation.
“I don’t think people care as much about the content,” Hermione said, “as the fact you’re speaking at all. You have…” She shrugged. “I’m not sure. A presence, I suppose. People have always felt better after you said something, even if it was just to tell them they were doing a good job on a spell they were practising in the DA.”
“Hey!” Ron smiled. “Dad’s old haunt!”
Draco was already waving him off. “Good gad, no. No, thank you. That would…only make things worse, I’m sure.” Whoever had tipped off the
Jumping into the trees had bought him precious seconds of time, but he’d also necessarily had to slow down to ensure he didn’t break his neck slamming into a branch, so everything about evened out, and Potter was still gaining on him steadily. He had one final card to play, one last weapon in his arsenal to deploy, and he felt it was time. With a quick glance behind himself, locking eyes with Potter through the thick goggles he wore, he took aim—
‘The likes of Zabini’. Well
He could feel Draco staring at him in the darkness, and then reaching over, gently tilting Harry’s head to face him. Draco lifted up onto his elbows, leaning forward to move his lips over Harry’s, and together they melted. Harry snaked an arm around Draco, drawing them chest to chest, and imagined he could feel the roaring inferno swirling within Draco as a real, physical heat, letting it sear him and reduce him to ash.

Now, it hadn’t been his idea to come back to Hogwarts in the first place; had he had any choice in the matter, he might have sought a discreet transfer to Durmstrang or even Beauxbatons to finish up any remaining coursework, and even with the restrictions placed on his movements, he felt confident enough in his grasp of the curriculum he could have managed at least Es on any N.E.W.T.s he chose to sit through self-study.

And all right, he had something of a point—but to Draco’s knowledge, none of them had been
working toward something, and while he didn’t have anything in particular he was ‘dreaming of doing’, he still had drive and ambition. The urge to prove himself, to be something more than the very worst parts of his family name. He wanted, really he did, to tell Potter he was taking more N.E.W.T.s than even Potter was, just to show he wasn’t this beaten down pathetic carcass, that he still had some fucking
He would wager Draco performed more physical labour in the next eight hours than he had in his entire life. When he tired of mixing mortar for the brick-layers and Scourgifying the flagstones in the corridors that had seen fighting, he shifted into the dragon and fired the forges for the metalwork and helped Hagrid haul loads of heavy stone from the Courtyard into the Great Hall to repair the sundered walls.
And Harry wanted to tell them, he did, but he wanted it to be on his own terms—and he wanted Draco to be on board with it as well. He wanted this to be another

get tired of the thrill that preceded a leap from such great heights, mind awhirl with the knowledge that all that stood between himself and a broken bag of blood and bones strewn across the ground was his own two wings.
And that set something off inside Draco, hot and acidic, and he nearly ground his teeth down to dust as he bit out, “
He’d prodded Hermione into getting a bit creative with the interior, as this one wouldn’t be moving about from site to site and so could support a stable environment within. It had taken some thought, deciding what this Sanctuary should look like, but given the wondering look on Draco’s face, smoothly replaced by a smile of dawning realisation, he felt he’d chosen wisely.
Draco heard the teasing in his voice, though only because he thought to listen for it. Clearly Potter’s Latin studies had failed him, as he hadn’t yet learned it wasn’t wise to tickle a dragon. “…For a while, at least. And then I’m meant to be back. I told Mother I’d return before Christmas Eve.”

“I don’t give a fig how the damn thing sees it. At any rate, I’ll be ready the next time it tries something.” He’d only been taken by surprise this time, that was all. If Granger’s cat wanted to try and maul him again…well, she’d need to find a new pet for next term.
He was struck how, at every turn, his friends had done nothing but attempt to guide and support him as he navigated the tricky business of his relationship—whatever form it took—with Draco Malfoy over the years. They’d had his back when barbs had been traded during classes, blithely tolerated his obsession in Sixth Year, gone grudgingly along with most every bad decision he’d made during their Horcrux hunt (if only to make sure he didn’t get himself killed), and were now at the point where Ron was mostly concerned he was sleeping with

but he hated the Owlery as a human. It reeked, you always came out covered in down or birdshit or both, and these days it felt like all the owls were watching him. They’d always given him a wide berth before, sensing he wasn’t quite one of them, but now when their eyes fell on him he sensed sneering judgement in their gazes, as if they’d read the
“A wise move for someone keen to keep his remaining ear,” Draco drawled, and George flicked him a rude gesture.
“Up to something,” Draco said, rolling the words around in his mouth, as if he’d been sneaking extra dessert from the Kitchens or trying to recover contraband from Filch’s stash. “…You’re being awfully casual about my murdering our former Headmaster.”
It was funny. He’d always thought the Weasley twins an abject embarrassment, a waste of good pure wizarding blood—but he’d now come to appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit and generally clever ideas. They’d seen a niche and filled it, and they hadn’t given a fig who thought they belonged there. Then there was Mother Weasley, who’d called him a ‘handsome fellow’ (well, his owl form at least) and probably looked the other way while Potter pilfered leftovers for Draco’s meals. Like Draco was just another of her herd of children in need of stuffing with good, filling food.
Draco drew his wings in tight to his body, angling down and shooting like a bullet, talons outstretched.
There was a beat of silence, and then Potter sputtered, “I…I didn’t do anything. I don’t think?”
“Maybe,” Harry said, voice gone a bit husky. He wasn’t about to be cowed by Draco’s casual use of such lewd language—he did that sort of thing to distract, Harry was learning. “Don’t think I haven’t considered it—what different choices I might’ve made, where that might’ve put us.” Draco’s eyes had a hooded quality to them, and he seemed unsteady on his feet. Harry softened his features. “You haven’t changed either, I see that now. I just started to look at you from a different angle. It’s not that there’s things about you now I love that weren’t there before; I just never noticed them. Or I outright ignored them.” He knew he sounded wistful, and he didn’t care. “Makes me sad it took so long.”
“I’m only saying: the Library’s warm, quiet, and the worst thing you’re going to smell in the stacks is Madam Pince’s hair spray.”
And of course it had.
“It was nothing, Mrs. Weasley—”
“Thomassen?” Draco shrugged in an
“Like you said,” Harry smiled as Draco looped a tie the same smoky grey as his eyes around Harry’s neck, “After the banquet.”
They were still atrociously early when they finally Apparated into Hogsmeade, but this did not stop Draco from chivvying them up the drive from the village to the castle’s front gates, which had been thrown open wide and decorated with twining vines and summer blossoms. If not for a liberal application of Cooling Charms, they would have both been drenched in sweat, their lovely new robes ruined, by the time they reached the sturdy stone steps.

Draco was clearly intrigued—and hating himself for it. “…What?”
Hermione, predictably, bought him a book—one filled with sumptuous dessert recipes. Draco, legs thrown over Harry’s lap, was quick to point out the tabbed pages. “I’ve already highlighted my favourites, so get to practising.”
And part of Harry—a rather obvious part—thought that sounded like a

letters, because he didn’t bother making small talk, only offering a curt, “Delivery, if you don’t mind,” before yanking at Draco’s leg like he was a Christmas goose.

Once in his room, he relieved Pig of the letter he’d come bearing and tossed him onto the bed, where he landed with a plop, rolling around merrily on the fine duvet. “Shit on my bed, and I’ll feed you to the Venomous Tentacula.” Pig didn’t seem remotely fazed by the threat, and Draco sighed as he slid into his desk chair, unrolling the letter to see what Potter could possibly want with him now.
“Yeah, I know.” Draco leered. “Still didn’t think you’d do it.”

“And I hope that includes you lot as well,” McGonagall said, just as Harry and the others were bidding their farewells after a sumptuous dinner in the Great Hall; Kreacher had made sure that Harry’s beloved treacle tart had been on the menu this evening, and he’d had half a mind to beg the old elf to come back to Grimmauld Place, Hermione’s probable protests be damned.
Harry didn’t know what that meant, and he didn’t really care. His mind was a white fog of confusion, and all his senses had drilled down to just the precious points of contact: lips, noses, fingers, and if he canted his hips,
best shot.
Draco closed the window behind himself, then turned to the owl. “…Right, I don’t have a response. You can go back now.” The owl cocked its head at him, looking somehow dejected, and Draco felt a curious little tug of discomfort in his midsection that he belatedly recognised as guilt. “I haven’t got any letters for you. If you want to do something for me, go back and shit on his head. He likes that sort of thing, finds it terribly amusing.” It nearly turned its head upside down in confusion, and he shooed it away. “Go on,

“Less discussion of orgies, more warming of milk!” Hermione huffed. “I’m doing the hard part getting the tart moulds ready.”
Potter gave a nod that was just this side of patronising. “Well… I mean, lots of us didn’t act the way we might usually during the war, so…” He shrugged. “I wasn’t going to judge.” He took another sip of his tea, then paused, brows knitting in confusion. “Wait, if you’ll be friends with the likes of
Blaise gave an inelegant yelp, arms pinwheeling as he nearly toppled into the iced-over pond on their opposite side. Draco snapped a hand out to grab him by the collar and yank him back onto steady feet, and Blaise reached up to shove him hard across the chest, barking, “Don’t
Potter brought his arm down level with the bed, and Draco waddled across the plush bedding that nearly swallowed him whole until his talons found purchase on the cabled yarn. He dug in, hoping for a wince that said the material wasn’t quite as thick as Potter had imagined, but no such luck, and he shortly found himself hoisted into the air. Potter held Draco at an angle that had their heads level, which Draco thought was both very brave and very stupid (Gryffindor through and through, this one), and he barely reined in the urge to bite his nose.
way she might react to hearing he would be throwing in with a force that might do his social standing more harm than good in the end.
The little owl cocked its head at him, gazing up with big brown eyes, and then held one leg out, awkwardly balancing on the other. It was only now Draco realised there was a scroll tied to it, itself almost as large as the owl delivering it, and his arm dropped, shoulders slumping.

Dinner was, as expected, delicious, with the elves in the kitchen having quite outdone themselves. Tucking in, Harry couldn’t help but recall each and every one of the meals he’d shared at this table with friends—and now more than friends—and a knot that had taken root in his chest the moment they had walked through the sturdy wooden doors fronting the Entrance Hall began to grow, throbbing painfully, because god,

Draco opened his mouth to ask where the boy’s parents were, but the sad sort of twinge to Potter’s smiles, and the way he spoke of these people in the past tense, said he shouldn’t. Then again: they weren’t friends, and not-friends didn’t trod on eggshells around one another, so he asked anyway. “His parents?”

“…I suppose I miss having a pet. Not that I ever really thought of Hedwig as a pet—she was just Hedwig. She could be a little moody at times, kind of like you—but mostly only when I deserved it. So not like you at all, really.” Draco clicked his beak in warning, and Potter snorted softly—then the fond smile on his lips tightened, and his gaze went a bit distant. “…Animals are great, though. They never judge you—not the way humans do at least. They just know if you’re a good sort, or a bad sort. That’s all they usually care about.” He trailed off in thought, staring down at Draco but not really
boy! Throwing yourself between our Fred and that curse! You can’t know how—” She choked herself up, shaking him like a rag doll, before she finally released him, holding him at arm’s length to get a good look at him. “Goodness, you’re skin and bones! Ronald Weasley, you haven’t been ‘losing’ the pies and casseroles I’ve been sending around, have you?”
Draco made a grand show of thinking the offer over before slowly, carefully picking his way back down the branch, closing the gap between himself and Potter’s open palm. He perused the proffered sweets, leaning forward as if to get a better look, then locked his soulless black eyes with Potter’s and promptly bit the shit out of the nearest finger he could find.
“My eyes, ‘Mione! I can’t—I can’t control them!” She hissed, glancing up at Hermione, who gasped and pulled her wand out.
“Everyone’s told me about you—how you escaped death and how you have the scar to prove it!” he said excitedly.
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best," he said in a gloomy voice.
“Who is he to decide who I am?! It’s—it’s wrong!” She cried out, “I am my own person! His being headmaster has nothing to do with who I am and where I belong!”
She was reminded of something the next morning while sitting in Defence Against the Dark Arts. They were copying down different ways to treat a werewolf bite—and unfortunately, there were not many—when she remembered suddenly about Ben.
“I’m going to kill myself.”
She silently moved up the tree, squinting through the leaves. Below her was a dark clearing, where the silhouette of Snape was evident in his tall and towering figure. Quirrell was there, much to her own surprise.
Her middle name, Lilith, surprised her by having a similar story. Lilith was the first wife of Adam, as in Adam and Eve, and she rebelled against the belief that she was to be his inferior. She was kicked out of the Garden of Eden and cast into biblical Hell, where she was made to be the mother of demons and monsters. Upon further inspection, Persephone learned that she was not cast away but simply left Adam when he acted like her superior and found that she was very dangerous, in some myths. She mothered demons—and some say she was related to the first stories about vampires.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
amount of sense.
Persephone raised a brow, “I’m sorry?”
"Both of you, shhh!” She whispered, “I heard something."
She grabbed her ready packed bag and basically ran down the stairs, making her way through the common room, passed all the hungover seventh years from the party the night before. She wished them luck with the headache she had heard was promised with morning afters and exited the portrait.
“Girl! What was that! That thing!” He hissed to her as she stood. The pudding in her hand was incredibly heavy all of a sudden so she slid it onto the kitchen table.
She walked in almost a trance like state to the Gryffindor common room, with the book in hand, trying to understand what had just occurred and how. She climbed the stairs up to the portrait of the Fat Lady.
A dark silhouette brushed to her, crouching by her, “She’s been injured—broken leg and what looks like a terrible force trauma to both hands.”
“Lily?” Fred asked.
She did as she was told and he gestured for her to move her hand carefully over all the boxes. She did so, once too quickly which he called her out on. She did it once more, not understand what was happening, and then, like her hand was a magnet, the box in the middle had move. Freezing, looking up to Mr. Ollivander to find his eyes alight with excitement, the box’s lid shuttered once more, flying off with a lot of force for a feather to fly up to her palm. Jumping, she withdrew her hand only for the feather to fly right at her and poke her in the eyes.

Home, such as it was, was rather dreary this year. Certainly not as bad as the previous year, but at least then they’d all been together. A broken, beaten family—but still a family. This year, though, there were no tasteful but festive decorations in the entry hall, no evenings nursing hot toddies by the ancient crackling fireplace in the parlour listening to the paintings tell stories of Christmases past, no Boxing Day luncheons with his friends spent bragging about what extravagant gifts their doting parents had bestowed upon them.

But these Slytherins certainly weren’t going to make it easy—and what was he waiting for, an engraved invitation by Owl?

“No—I mean, yeah, I guess it had…” He nodded, forcing a smile. “Thanks, I’ll talk to Draco about it.”
“And where exactly are we supposed to keep it?”
Mrs. Weasley insisted on having a big to-do at the Burrow, and while Harry would have been happy just having a few friends over at Grimmauld Place for something a bit less of a hassle, he’d never been able to turn Molly down.
It wasn’t all bad, of course. The Wizengamot hadn’t gone so far as to say which classes he was obliged to take, so he’d enrolled himself only in courses he could have passed with his eyes closed—which he often did, catching naps in the far back corners of his classrooms while the professors delivered droning lectures, generally being a bother to absolutely no one. He didn’t want to excel. He didn’t want to stand out. He only wanted to survive long enough to escape this castle and all its occupants—after which his future was wide open. Some might call it ‘empty’, but Draco liked to think he was only still considering his absolute

Hermione tapped the bricks with her wand, and the wall melted away to reveal Diagon Alley, already bustling with shoppers. It was as busy as Harry had ever seen it, and he felt something warm blossom in his chest. He’d feared things might never feel

“Um.”
“No indeed,” she sighed, pushing her mash around her plate absently. “I’ve left them the address of an Owl Post Box if they want to get in touch with me, though. Perhaps a bit of cooling off time is just the ticket.”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Potter muttered—though he made sure not to turn his back to Draco, even as he shuffled from the Owlery after sending the Scops off on its delivery. “See you ‘round, tosser,” he said before he slipped out the door, showing Draco a couple of fingers (once more fresh and unbandaged; Draco would have to do something about that when the inevitable next time came around).

place, really—with lots of people. Many of whom weren’t at all fond of Draco, despite his service during the war.
curious about what had Potter so worked up. What could be so urgent that he would risk further maiming by what Draco was quite confident was the most ill-tempered (but best bred) bird in the Owlery?
about to chance leaving the roosting room to hunt for mice or voles or maybe even some of the garden gnomes that surely populated the property when Potter appeared with a plate of leftovers from what looked to have been a sumptuous dinner.
“Er—sure, Pansy. All’s forgiven. How about I put in a good word for you with Draco, hm? If you’ll—just—remove yourself—?”
and raced across the room, throwing open another wardrobe and digging through it until he drew out a moth-eaten knitted jumper in a faded red. “It’s too small for him anyway, and Mrs Weasley knits us new ones each Christmas—he won’t mind.”
His mother, drat it all, was still in the parlour when he came back down. He ignored her, pretending to be in a hurry, and marched for the Floo.

Potter’s expression went stiff. “An Auror? Surely they weren’t—” But Draco waved him down before he worked himself into a sanctimonious snit.
, ‘cause it’s a time-sensitive kind of thing, and well—” He waved a hand at the empty roosts. “All the school owls are in use, and Pig’s already off making a delivery, so could you…could you
“Why?”
Draco shrugged. “Passable, for Harry Potter.” He glanced around. “And clearly your sycophants are lapping it up.”
Harry had grumbled his displeasure, though it had mostly been for show; he was honestly relieved to have a bit of quiet time to himself before the event, to compose his thoughts, if nothing else. He was still feeling uncomfortable—and a tiny bit nauseated—with the idea of having to march up in front of the crowd and deliver a speech, but he settled his nerves with a reminder that if he’d survived the Killing Curse (twice!), he could surely handle a bit of public speaking.
Potter gave a half-shrug. “…All right, fair point.”
“Now, don’t tell anyone,” Potter warned, placing a finger over his lips, “but it’s got an Undetectable Extension Charm on it, so there’s probably more owl treats in there than you could eat in your entire lifetime.” Oh but Draco
Potter, perhaps sensing the same, used the guise of giving him toe-curling scritches under his chin to whisper, “…Are you heading back home in the morning?” Draco bobbed his head. “Well. Say ‘hi’ to Zabini for me.” What an odd thing to ask; Draco turned his head nearly upside down in confusion. “It’s a figure of speech. I’m being civil, see?” Draco cuffed him with a wing, and Potter blocked it, tutting softly under his breath. When Draco began to pick at the band on his leg again, Potter sighed. “Yeah, I know. I’ll send Pig with a message when we’re heading back to Diagon, yeah? We’ll be going back to stock up on supplies for the new term a few days before we head back to Hogwarts. You can meet me there, and then we’ll get Eeylops to remove it.”
Draco shrugged, as if to say
“Minister for Magic?” Potter looked like his head was about to turn upside down, brows bunched together. “I haven’t seen Kingsley since—” He seemed to consider. “My birthday, I guess?

He’d started off placing one as what could only be a peace offering atop a knot carved into one of the lower roosting branches, and Draco had purposefully ignored it until Potter had done his business and fucked off. He’d thought they might be poisoned at first—it certainly wouldn’t have come as any surprise—so he’d let one of the other owls have at it. When his poison-tester had failed to promptly keel over in a dead faint, he supposed the little bit of kibble must

But if Draco could humour him when Harry asked him to dress down, then Harry could do the same and dress up when occasion called, and he had to admit, he couldn’t exactly go marching into something with the word ‘banquet’ in the name dressed in trainers, jeans, and an oversized faded t-shirt.
The 2nd of August was upon them in no time, and with the Survivors’ Remembrance Banquet scheduled to start promptly at five that evening, Draco had himself and Harry well into preparations by just after noon. When asked why they had to start getting ready so early, Draco only gestured to himself with a sniffed, “You think this just
people to fuck off—he didn’t get told to fuck off himself! That was just absurd.
Draco sighed, breath coming in a steamy puff of fog. “…The Greenhouses.”
God, Harry loved him. As much as he’d ever loathed him, he fucking loved Draco now. He was funny and sexy and stubborn and proud, and everything that drove Harry mad about him drove him wild as well. Dragonflame roaring beneath a prickly, icy exterior—and he wanted to share it with
“You could always look into working at the Ministry yourself to balance things out?” Draco gave him

of Potter Disapparating had faded. The hilt had been warm, and her fingers so cold and trembling.
“Very. Too much.” Draco kissed him, soft and slow and full of apology. “Next time. I promise.”
Bragge mopped his forehead, chuckling nervously. “No, I dare say he wouldn’t! Do forgive me, my boy. I must simply make a few assessments of your magical stability before I can sign off on these forms you’ve brought me.” He directed his attention to Draco, his voice soft and melodically soothing; Harry wondered if this sort of tack usually worked on dragons, or if Bragge was just playing it by ear. “This being a unique situation involving a Dangerous Creature, I’ll be handling the job your case manager usually would—which includes an evaluation of your transformational capabilities, your mental fortitude, that sort of thing.”
It was just, giving Draco a new Sanctuary had been so
It was time.
“Yes, Headmistress.” If he kept his responses succinct, maybe he wouldn’t come off like ‘a patronising little wanker’, as Potter had informed him he often sounded—and as Blaise and Pansy had both confirmed. He’d never really liked McGonagall—she’d had it out for Draco (and Slytherin by proxy) since the moment she’d placed the Sorting Hat on his head—but he needed her on his side if he was to make anything of these final few months of schooling before he was chucked out on his arse.

And all right, he had a point. “…Well we’ll try it the other way next time. I told you—I’d rather take it slow.”
the magic, at least.” He was certain he wasn’t getting his point across, and he could feel his frustration overtaking his arousal, wilting his cock. “It’s not…it’s not about the doing. For me. It’s—god, the whole thing’s meant to be an experience. Isn’t it?” It was why it had taken him so long to get to this point to begin with; he hadn’t been joking when he’d said he wanted to ‘savour’ it. What was the point in going to a ludicrously expensive restaurant for dinner, and then skipping the appetisers altogether? “Do whatever you need, really—just let me share it with you?”
He rejoined their kiss, having nothing more to say but still so much more to express, and eased Draco’s briefs down until he could palm his cock, tugging with a ruthless languidity. He’d neglected to put up any Silencing Charms and didn’t want to waste the breath to do so now, but he was still conscious of Ron and Hermione sleeping only one floor below. Draco fumbled with the ties to his bottoms to get his hand on Harry’s cock and rushed to catch up. They lost themselves in the warm, close darkness, biting back breathy sighs and swallowing moans until they came with silent screams.

“Why are you so violent?” She asked. “Dance is so much fun, maybe you’ll benefit from it! Get all anger out!” She said cheerfully while he glared at her.
“What are you reading?” She asked, noticing the strange looking at the magazine in her hands.
“This dimwitted girl most certainly does not belong in my house!” Another, more pompous voice called up.
They sniffed a laugh before Hermione handed Persephone the bottle. She took her own bottle in hand.
“You don’t know?” Both her perfect brows raised, “Young lady, I may have to suggest you put on some more confident before one of your teachers before I decide Miss Parkinson will do a better job at winning this championship.”
“Bill got twelve and he isn’t like Percy at all and he gloated—he’ll be head boy next year for sure, which will make mum all the more pressuring to have us made prefect, which makes no sense because there is only one of us who can be a prefect…” George sighed, staring up at the sky. He was sitting on his broomstick, one foot on the handle, so he could lean his arm against his knee.

Despite being advised to dress down, it was still another half hour of dithering before Draco finally decided on an outfit and looped his arm through Harry’s, letting himself be dragged into spinning darkness with a sharp
“Hey!” Potter cheered. “That’s brilliant, then!”

Blaise shrugged. “Thereabouts. Pans has mentioned something about enrolling in a wizarding cosmetics program in Uppsala, and we’re thinking of flatting together.” Draco arched a brow, and Blaise gave a barked laugh. “Oh, not like

Between schedules that kept them out of each other’s lives (and fields of view) and the fact that House alignments were as strong as ever, the bonds forged in the war weakening once again as everyone returned to their proper corners, Draco didn’t really have to interact with Potter at all as a human.
Harry sighed.
As a group, they Flooed to the public fireplaces near Gringotts, from which they made their way along the cobblestone path to visit the remaining twin Weasley at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
,” announced the disembodied voice in the lift), and the carriage rattled onward and upward.
Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, but it was…somehow exactly how he had imagined it would be: curious and scandalous and terrifying all at once. Flash and flimflam and pure unadulterated fun, as was written in bold letterhead on a sign hanging over the register. His head was whirling with such snapping vigour, he worried it might pop off as he tried to take everything in, and he found himself wishing, with a twinge of regret, that he could come back in human form and browse the shelves at his leisure—though he doubted he’d be welcome.
Draco ignored him, but his fist started moving faster over his cock, a slick, squelching blur. When he released a soft, shuddering gasp that Harry well recognised, he ratcheted his thrusts up another octave, trying to fuck right
But Gryffindor Tower still showed obvious signs of wear—including remnants of the damage from Draco’s own wild attack over a year earlier—and the Quidditch pitch had yet to be reseeded, though carpentry appeared to have been started on the demolished stands. There was a fair bit of work yet to go before the castle was returned to its former glory—but McGonagall remained confident they would reopen on schedule, welcoming students old and new into the sturdy stone halls.
to his human tastebuds, but the craving was there all the same and—of late—unquenchable.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
"Urgh—troll boogers."
"Potter!" Snape said so suddenly that she jumped in her seat. He was not looking at her. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Behind her, she could hear some of the Slytherins sniggering.
"Makes sense why we couldn’t find him in any of the books,” Persephone commented when their high faltered. “He isn’t recent, being six hundred and sixty five, is he?”
"We'll just have to—" Persephone began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
“You!” Ron said excitedly. “A seeker!”
Tom was very good at explaining magic to her. Early that day he’d given her a list of books to check out of the library to be prepared for his lessons. He explained things that made sense to her in Charms, and never spoke in echoing the text books. He was brilliant, but this—
“The other four schools in participation are as followed; Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Institution of Magia, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry—” Persephone zoned out for the rest of the list, snapping her eyes at Hades. His eyes had widened and he suddenly had stiffened up. She saw his hands tighten at his sides. Suspicion coiled inside of her—what could lead to this reaction? She had been under the impression that he had enjoyed his time at Ilvermorny.
Her hands felt sticky and she looked down, distressed to find blood in both of them. George was quick to tell her it was his blood, not hers, but this only made her worse—he had been holding both her hands and she had squeezed them so hard, too hard, that they broke skin and were now bleeding profusely.
“My…right?”
She started singing. She’d always thought her voice was soft and subtle, not very powerful but sweet instead. It had an effect on people—she usually looked up as she sang, so to avoid onlookers. When she finished the very short song, she looked back to the crowd.
"So…” Persephone trailed off. “So you’re entire family are magic?” How interesting to view the non-magical world as she viewed the magical world!
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Persephone shivering behind him.
Persephone followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. She breathed in deeply and resisted the urge to fling herself into the ocean. She’d never been close to the ocean—and it was gorgeous now that she could see it properly.
"How's your arm?" Persephone asked.
“Ah, the Messrs. Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs," George sighed. “We owe them so much. They have helped bring us up into the men we are today,” He nodded fondly and Persephone rolled her eyes in amusement.
Persephone asked Ron to teach her to play wizard chess—it was a lot like non-magical chess, if it had not been for the fact that the figures had minds of their own. They looked like they were alive and moved on their own, with their own small limbs. It looked like they were directing troops into battle.
She mumbled something she was sure was too low for him to hear but he laughed as if he heard it, and he laughed loudly. So loudly that he leant backwards and fell. She cried out but he only swung from his legs, still laughing.
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"
So the day was turning around for the good. Malfoy was humiliated, she found out there was a drama club (and dance club and choir club that would cooperating for a play) and she was going to audition for a musical. The day got really sweet when Ron and Persephone walked up the stairs, only to be stopped by Persephone, who nearly fell into Ron from laughing at the sight of Mrs. Norris, a violent shade of red dye covering her body. When she pointed this out to him, Ron also doubled over in fits of hysterical laughter.
“What year are you taking your exams with?” She asked.
It was undetailed that for a moment, she needed to go over these words. The next moment, she was examining the room—and then the cup of water inside the cage of a mice, with a mice next to it. Okay. She glanced at Professor McGonagall, who was watching, before she approached the glass of water. It was sat on an old looking stool. She pursed her lips before examining underneath the stool. Key. She grinned.
She very faintly remembered that Tom was speaking to her, “An accomplice?”
“No bars on the window, no seven or so locks on the door and no one discriminating against each other,” She smiled a brilliant smile. “This is the best place I’ve ever been.”
"He saved his life."
“Did Moaning Myrtle flood a toilet again?”
She decided not to apologize after all, having seen what sort of teacher he was. He ignored her for the remainder of the class and only looked at her as she packed up her things, trying to be quick to follow Ron’s angry leaving. Just as she left her table, Snape looked at her.
. So, undeniably boring that she half wished Voldemort would come rushing in to kill her, as she’d been worrying all through all her exams.
“Percy!” Someone called to her.
Finally freed from her icy stare, Persephone let a breath she didn’t know she was holding out and clamped her clammy hands into fists.
“I trust you would be,” She nodded, not knowing what that meant. “What is a wizard’s duel anyway?” She asked absentmindedly. “Sounds stupid.”
"No,” Persephone shook her head. “Other than in potions, it’s supposed to be extremely rare.”
They bought parchment and ink and Persephone made a note to stock up on pens. Maybe she could start selling them. Then the twins dragged them off to Gambol and Japes, the local joke shop, where they stocked up Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks.
A little passageway opened up at the bottom of the room, just in the corner where the two walls met. The bricks move and opened and Persephone held her breath and started counting the seconds when she let go of the right bricks and made a run for it. She slid into the passage and darkness enveloped her.
“Actually, it’s taught in American schools,” Amanda piped up. “I read about it.”
She exited the bathroom and found all the girls piled on Lavender and Renee’s bed. Hermione, who looked uncomfortable for being forced to be there, pleaded with Persephone through her eyes. Persephone took the seat in between Lavender and Hermione.
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.
Something about this woke her right up—all of the castle was unlocked. She was free to roam the darkened halls as she pleased, explore every nook and cranny. No one who could get her in trouble would ever know.
"I-I don't know what you—”
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.
“She’s never traveled by Floo powder,” Ron said suddenly, looking apologetically at Persephone. “Sorry, Lils, I forgot.”
It seemed everyone was getting into the harsh spirits of exams—Persephone didn’t think it too strange that Ben had disappeared so suddenly, he was famously known for it. She forgot him as she focused on pulling herself through exams. The resolution to keep herself focused on exams was going well, until the week before exams were due to start.
He narrowed his eyes, “Who?”
. Now,
Persephone looked up and smiled at Gary, who was staring. “You want to join us? We’re going swimming.”
His face blanked, “Yeah, well—I mean, a professor—for a club.”
“Right,” He set her down and she grimaced down at her attire. Covered in sea water and sand, her eyes were burning with tears. “We should head back now.”
Amongst the dense, dark trees, she could make out the shape of something…something strange. It was like a horse, but…more dead. More skeletal. Its eyes shone in the dark, expressionless and white. Persephone could make out what looked like bat-like wings. They looked more leathery, with no feathers of any sort. It was completely black.
Something clicked in the back of her mind and her mind blanked. She wondered what her face betrayed as her mind reeled backwards in time, remembering all the times he’d ever commented on sirens and her similarities, on every time she’d tried to brush these things off—because she wasn’t a siren. Because she was just an ordinary girl, an ordinary witch. She did not—she did not grow a tail!
"Non-magical, for one,” she smiled. “And, well,
“We?”
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin."
They walked down the hall quietly, until a set of running footsteps followed them, "I'm coming with you," she said.
There was a knock on the office door and Snape opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.
"Always wanted to shake your hand—I'm all of a flutter."
She tried her best to keep that strut Pansy always pulled off, trying not to trip over her own feet. No one found this out of order, though she was the only person moving against the crowds of students walking into the Great Hall.
About her wand: It's completely my doing, just because wand making is so interesting to me that I wanted to add it in.
Hermione hesitated and asked, “I was just wondering—because last night…you weren’t?”
“Brilliant thinking, Lils,” Fred commented and they snuck out the portrait hole.
“Probably has,” Ron added and Persephone almost smiled at the sneer that appeared on Malfoy’s face.
Persephone skipped from the Great Hall that evening after nearly inhaling her dinner in less than five minutes. She headed to the library, nervously looking behind her back. She suddenly felt like this wasn’t such a good idea. How many times had she gotten out of trouble this week alone? She was most definitely pushing her luck.
She eyed him back, and he jumped, nearly off the footstool, when he realized he’d been caught.
She was worried and distracted for the remainder of the day. She was worried about Daphne thinking she cheated to be with Hades—but how could she have done that? If it was all based off chemistry, then how could someone cheat? Was she really mad because she thought she’d cheated? But then, wouldn’t she know that Hades and Persephone were close? Closer than him and Daphne? What even made up chemistry?
“HAhahaha!” She laughed hysterically, “Right…”
“Brilliant! Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years—”
I wrote to her when I first got here,” She said in confusion, looking at Ron.
“Oh,” She flushed, “We’re barely friends…he’s tutoring me.”
The cold texture had abruptly changed into a softer one and she looked down. Instead of brick, she found the dark spine of a book, camouflaged perfectly amongst the brick. Frowning, she bent down and pushed it. It moved, quite easily.
She made a move to move down the street but Hagrid stopped her, “Listen ‘ere,, what was that you did back there?”
That did not sound fun. “And do they know where you are? Won’t they get worried by your absence?”
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering down at Persephone, "is this—can this be—?"
“Did you bring him?”
Persephone, panicking, tried to lead the elf to the bench. He looked like a very ugly doll, hiccoughing and sniffing big green boogers. Thankfully, he was able to control himself enough to sit and star up at her with great big green eyes, filled with tears and adoration.
, and
“What do you want?” She asked.
Maybe if she looked into it before he could, she could find where it was hidden! She could only assume Quirrell did not know how the mirror worked so she started to edge to the left, to get a clear view of the glass, but the ropes only tightened. She fell over.
Was Neville okay? She couldn’t ask, as she’d covered her mouth with her hand. “But I bounced—all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here—they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."
“And frankly, I’m offended you’d think we need magic for this,” George grinned at her. She cracked a smile.
“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” Dudley held out an exaggerated arm for an invisible woman to take.
his fault.”
“Well, then learn Italian, they are very similar languages, with all the verbs. All connected, all just remixes of Latin—which is also very useful, you should learn that too. You have strong eyebrows, you know?” She said, distracted. “Or you could go to Italy—we’re going next summer, my parents wanted me to invite you along.” She smiled. “Adoptive parents, if you’re wondering.”
Persephone couldn’t believe the level of a
Persephone wasn’t sure of what she meant but she stroked her hair, keeping the bowl of candy from tipping over.
Dance class proceeded like so; everyone got into a big circle, sitting with the legs crossed Indian style and they all closed their eyes and meditated. Persephone was one of four who could not do so properly and kept opening her eyes and shifting her legs.
"What are you doing?" a voice from the corner of the room made them all jump. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.
She huffed, “They’re third years and they seem to love being around you—what did you do? Give them a love potion?”
“I want Draco Malfoy to
“So…why have you been asking about me?” He finally asked.
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
She watched, again, at the students around her. It was when she glanced at Neville, who was on her desk, that she gasped—he was dropping the porcupine quills into his cauldron while it was still over the fire, “Neville no—!” She tried but it was too late.
“Alchemy? Why on earth would you want to learn alchemy?” Mindi asked, scolding. “It’s barely a moving subject, much less taught at any school in Europe.”
“Where did you learn that?” Percy asked, impressed, as the mattress floated forward.
“Well, now, I said I would get you back, didn’t I?” She sighed. “And I do remember you two saying you were the best pranksters Hogwarts has ever seen…”
She snorted, “Me? It seems like you were the one avoiding me.”
"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me—I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
Ron gasped, “We can fly the car!”
He stared for a moment longer, “You’re crazy—I’m sending up sparks.”
She turned and silently approached Ron. He looked up, seeing right through her, until she pushed him and he gave a yell.
She sprung up, and she jumped him, quite literally, clinging onto his arm. He screamed and tried to throw Persephone off as Persephone’s own pain grew with his. She could barely see and all that she could hear over the ringing that had progressively grown in her ears was Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HER! KILL HER!”
"Double Potions
She was still full of dilemma that Wednesday night with Hermione. She’d suffered through several full moons and still was more stressed about the upcoming holiday. It had been a stressful month already—she had to worry about April first, not only April fools but the twin’s birthday which obviously gave them more motivation to get her back finally, and she had to worry about studying and lessons and she had to worry about this godforsaken dragon situation and Malfoy, every two seconds. And now—now she might be…what? What was the word for liking girls?
About her uniform: think Chilling Adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, episode nine, what the weird sisters were wearing. That's the inspiration for the dress I'm referring to.
When the end of the trip came, she was very sad to leave. She wouldn’t forget, of course, and the things she’d seen would remain with her forever, she thought—another thing stuck with her. She had to go back to the Durlseys.
She returned the Remembrall to Neville, and caught McGonagall’s approving eyes. Even Percy had noticed the scene and told her if she were to keep it up, she’d be on her way to being a prefect. This made Hermione jump violently and stare up at them in shock. She’d been one of the ones who thought loudly in the girl’s dorm how ridiculous it was to edge a bully on. Yikes.
“A bit of old parchment!” Fred grimaced, closing his eyes as though she had just offended him and everyone who came before him, “Explain, brother.”
She blinked and then smiled, “Right.” Her smile fell a tad, “We both auditioned for the play, though.”
"Come on, run, run!" Fred yelled at them, grabbing Persephone’s hand to drag them but the girls were frozen, staring at the troll as it started for Ron.
"Excuse me? My parents are famous?” She raised a critical brow, “Is that why they abandoned me?”
Hermione hesitated for a moment, pursing her lips, before asking, “Are you alright?”
She had a strange feeling this wouldn’t be the worse rule she’d be breaking but she marched in further and joined him, refusing to meet his eye. “Let’s just hurry up, please.”
“Doesn’t everyone?”
The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.
She shook her head, pushing this aside for later, "Sir—the stone?”
“Doesn’t really count if it isn’t my doing,” She said again.
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
Doris Crockford shook Persephone’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
It was a wonder of how Persephone didn’t catch a cold. Getting on her broom and soaring up high into the cold air while being sweaty should have gotten her a bad cold by now. They did laps on the broom and then finally, it was each their own. The Chasers, Beaters and Keeper played games while Persephone, the seeker, was left to fly around in search for a practice snitch. Oliver warned her that no matter how quickly she was able to find and capture the snitch, it would be ten times as hard in an actual game of Quidditch, because the Snitch in those games are never been used before.
Persephone frowned, “You break laws.”
She ate her food without speaking—this was the first actual meal she’d had that wasn’t a part of a dinner charade. Mrs. Weasley smiled at her compliment and offered her more, to which Persephone had to tell her, “Oh, I’m not sure I’m able to…I’m not used to eating a full plate, is all.” She was blushing now. “My aunt is very serious about my physique because of dance.”
She stepped over the rope carefully after having navigated the school carefully, keeping her eyes on the map. It was amazing! She had dodged Filch twice and he had no idea! Under the protection of the Invisibility Cloak, with the Marauder’s Map as a navigator and her metamorphmagus powers as a backup should she get caught, she was invincible. If she got caught, she’ll just morph into some random person and give a fake name. Easy done.
The twins behind her were laughing, and not quietly and Hades, too, was staring at her in shock, with the start of a smile playing on his lips. She waited, staring at Lucius Malfoy.
Her mind drifted to the conversation Percy Weasley and Hermione were having on lessons, ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult -- "; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing—").
“Letter from Dance Company that I auditioned for in January—came in last week.”
“Er…” Persephone grimaced.
Daphne stepped in, sensing Persephone’s discomfort, “And what’s that you’ve got there, Colin Creevey?”
Unable to hold her smile away, she passed the note over to Ron, whose jaw dropped to the floor in amazement, before eyeing the package almost enviously.
Persephone shrugged, “Let Filch catch him. It’s what he deserves after today,” Persephone stared over to the pursed her lips, thinking suddenly of the Weasley twins. “Hm…actually, I do feel in the mood to bake…And wouldn’t it be nice to team up with my arch nemesis to assert some justice to someone who actually deserves it?”
Despite the blurriness, she picked out several books and sat opposite to him. She followed his lead and took notes on whatever she deemed important. He had the manners to conjure water into the jug every ten minutes. She dipped her hand in the water to rub her eyes in every few minutes. The seventh time he cast the charm, she looked up and stared at him. Her vision was returning.
“This can’t be the wrong wall, can it?” Persephone hissed to Ron, who was panicked.
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Persephone’s forehead with a long, white finger.
They sat in silence, each trying to find the strength to stand. When they did, they didn’t say anything. Persephone headed off to the Gryffindor tower and Ben headed off to wherever he went. She died halfway up the stairs to her dorm. However, once she showered and had the water hit her, she felt good enough to dress for the day. But then she was all dry and she felt terrible.
She shrugged, looking away. She met his eye again and he looked concerned. She sighed, grabbing the letter and opening it. After briefly skimming through the lines, she shoved the letter back into her bag. He waited patiently, and wondered aloud, “You didn’t get in?”
The second unbelievable thing that had happened that summer was that she was
"Nah—can't spell it. All right—Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered.
"Well—I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
“By the way, got you a note from McGonagall, ” George said, waving a paper in his hand. “Not to use magic outside of school—”
"Are you sure that's a real spell?" the girl asked skeptically. "Well, it's not very good, is it? The spells I’ve tried have all worked for me—granted they were simple and just for practice, but it was rather grand, since nobody in my family’s magic at all. It was ever such a big surprise to us when I got my letter—but I’m rather pleased, I’ve heard Hogwarts is the very best school of witchcraft there is, as I've heard—I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough—oh, and I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
It was strange, to dance without eyes. Cho kicked Richard straight in the mouth in one of her pirouettes, which she was told afterwards. Richard was bleeding from the attack and Cho’s ankle suffered greatly. Sammy was a good dancer but too short for when he and Daphne ended up bumping into each other. He never stood a chance with her spins. Lydia was a softer dancer, moving barely an inch from her original spot but she tired quickly.
“I guess,” She sighed. “I’m starved.” She jumped down from the ledge and underestimated the height. She fell on her knees and Hades laughed.
“Oh, Draco, be nice,” Daphne chided in, sounding rather cross for someone Persephone’s age.
Persephone pulled at her hands nervously, “I just—how can—okay, I am, I am not qualified to be—I’ve never even played Quidditch, how can Oliver—or anyone expect I won’t mess this up? That I won’t literally lose so badly—”
“Two minutes in this house and you already make a mess, cause a ruckus already—” Hedwig squawked loudly, “And that bloody bird! You’re lucky I allow you back in this house!”
She waited, and waited and waited, chanting to herself that if she were in Slytherin, she would be the one to set a new example of what a Slytherin was—and she would punch Draco in the face.
Persephone’s mouth dried and she nodded fervently, feeling cold all over. Narcissa’s chin raised and she nodded. Persephone wanted so badly to excuse herself but she was currently terrified, frozen in her place.
“I—I don’t know.”
destroyed my planting pot—”
Hermione's lip trembled and her eyes filled with tears. For a moment, they stare at each other in woe, but then Hermione dashed forward to throw her arms around Persephone, sobbing once into her shoulder, “You’re…you’re a brilliant witch, Persephone, really. A brilliant person…” She was shaking.
"You've got to eat some breakfast."
“Well—I have been looking for you actually,” He said. “You’re impossible to find, you know.”
“Why?” Persephone asked.
“What does the moon have to do with any of this?” She spat out. “You’re the werewolf, not me,” She told him.
“I don’t remember learning that,” Persephone remarked. Hermione gave her a look.
As she washed her hands, she was staring at the spot through the mirror, inattentive to what she was doing in the sink, until suddenly the water no longer came down on her hands. Smiling, she said, “I am the daughter of Poseidon, and Sally Jackson!” She made an opening palm movement with her hand and then the water stretched with her.
Each bed came with a dresser and desk with a chair. The bed was in the middle by a set of tall, curved windows, with the same red velvet drapes imprinted with gold detailing that their bed curtains had. She felt like they were in medieval royalty, with the thick atmosphere of it all, what with stone walls and wooden floors. There was a centrally located fire roaring that she was sure they could roast marshmallows over, if wizards knew what marshmallows are.
And then appeared the familiar sneer. He was still holding Gary’s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice, “Here, boy—take your book—it’s the best your father can give you—”
,” Persephone read, “
Persephone grumbled up the stairs—where was modern feminism when she needed it? What sort of world was it that girls had to shave for the reason that
She couldn’t move.
“Errol?”
It wasn’t just the Quidditch practice that kept her busy—it was play rehearsals. And, more specifically, it was Pansy Parkinson.
Finally, the first-years piled in, led by Professor McGonagall. They all looked nervous and small, fidgeting here and there. Persephone had to feel bad—she was once one of them. From the group, she could easily spot Gary, with his fiery red hair.
She dodged another Bludger, which spun over her head, and in the moment that she did, her broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.  She thought for a moment she was going to fall right off and with this in mind, her hands tightened and she crossed her ankles underneath the broom, as to keep a hold on it.  She definitely never felt that before.
They shrank to the side, staring ahead as two dark silhouettes started coming towards them. A lamp flared and Persephone saw the most unlikely of duos: Professor McGonagall dressed in a tartan bathrobe with a hair net and Malfoy, who she had by the ear.
“You were trying to kill me!” Fang barked at Malfoy’s suddenly loud words.
"I don’t remember it,” She pursed her lips, the air turning more and more awkward. “But yes, apparently, that’s where he…” She drew a breath in, shrugging. “All I remember is just green light, and that’s pretty much it, so…”
The castle was quiet, unlike the usual noise that came with September 1
“Go away,” Percy snapped.
A magic wand... this was what Persephone had been really looking forward to.
"Nothing," Persephone lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Persephone found herself smiling at the discovery of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, she finally found the courage to ask, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"
Uncle Vernon did not look much too different from when she last saw him. He was still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of his freak of a niece. He cast a glance at the owl she carried in her cage, as if trying to decide if he regretted coming to get her.
He waved his wand and she fell away from the tree, landing in his arms. He steadied her and he looked around, “We should go.”
“To know why you’re mad.” He said without missing a beat.
Persephone stared. Was he coming to her asking for help? She could not help. How could she? “Is there anything I could do?”
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it is—they're really rare, and really valuable."
"No."
She, once more, pointed her wand and wordlessly did the spell and here was a pretty snuffbox. She glanced between the water and the snuffbox. Simple enough—she placed her wand behind her ear once more and, ignoring the disapproving look from McGonagall, she concentrated hard for a moment, feeling her fingers tingling for a moment, almost as if she could feel the blood moving through her, and then the water flowed with her will.
“You’ll need a few things extra, but less things if you plan on having him be an outdoor cat—” She was persuaded to buy her some food and a bowl, a little collar that had his name on it and that was enchanted to have him answer her calls. She decided on the name Salem, because it was a black cat usually and witches have black cats and the salem witchs trials—get it?
The world spun for Persephone and she had to sit down. What was going on?
She had run out of her medication and she felt like sending a letter back to the Durlseys would be an immediate way of getting herself kicked out. Because of this, her ADHD was acting up so severely, she could not focus for the life of her. Time either passed very quickly or insanely slowly and she was losing points to her suddenly being late to class. The simple instructions from the professors were impossible to remember and her understanding of the concepts of magic were slipping.
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. Or perhaps, it was the use of Voldemort’s name. "How do you know—?" she spluttered.
Knowing Hades would be there made her morning worse.
“Right,” She rolled her eyes.
She smiled shyly, “I should write Cedric a letter, and figure it out. And thank you, again, Mrs. Weasley.”
“Wait!” Hermione cried, running to her own bed. She pulled a thick, ancient looking book out from under her pillow and threw it onto Persephone’s bed, bouncing next to it, pushing the chocolate frogs away.
She opened the door and slid inside, catching a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. She took her spot amongst her Gryffindor and Hufflepuff friends, listening to what Professor Sprout was saying. There were about twenty different colored ear muffs lying on the bench that Professor Sprout was standing behind in the center of the greenhouse.
Quirrell rounded on Persephone. She stared up helplessly.
“Butterbeer? Like…beer?”
And then she was outside of the common room, locked out until she could recall the password.
“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes—”
There's nothing hidden in your head
“Documenter,” He corrected her. “You got my note?”
Hermione dropped her hands in shock, “
—think that he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."
“You thought wrong,” Snape said a few moments later, “I gave Miss Potter permission, as is written on this form. I do not see the reason as to why you pulled me out of my business for this.”
“Dobby, miss. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” the creature said.
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger, as she offered her hand.
“I cannot say that I am surprised. I infected you with a craving for publicity and now you’re acting out for attention. I can see it a mile away—and pulling a stunt like you did, why it was so clear to me. Flying a car to Hogwarts!
“Man’s mad, isn’t he?” Ron said. “And I guess we aren’t allowed to know about Fluffy or the Stone, so that’ll definitely get Hagrid in trouble…”
“We can…we can set them back up,” Hermione’s small voice rung in her head. “See, the snitch is fine—and look, the lilies aren’t damaged at all! It just your…scarf….Look, I’ll come with you, and we’ll put it back together, okay?”
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Persephone shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored while Persephone stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering whether or not she could buy Privet Drive 4 yet.
When she raised her head once more, she met the eyes of a ghost.
The lock clicked and the door swung open—they jumped in, shut the door behind them and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“How do you know? That stuff Pomfrey was talking about sounded serious,” He said.
He had no idea.
“Well either or, you definitely come from warm waters,” He told her. “Are you familiar with Plato?”
"We’ve only got tonight.” She said, miserably watching McGonagall walk away. “The stone will be taken tonight, I’m sure. If anything, it’ll be safer with us, I’m sure.” She hoped before turning and jumping.
“Now, you must be sure to cover your ears properly and completely. Only when I give the heads up that it is safe to remove them will you touch the earmuffs. Should anyone so much as touch the earmuffs out of turn, they will be sent straight to their head of house for a detention. Now, put them on. I will come around and see that you’ve put them on correctly.”
“Nearly,” She mumbled. While her parents seemed awful, what with the way aunt Petunia rarely spoke of them, Persephone didn’t really think her aunt and uncle were any better, other than the fact that they kept her. Up until a year ago, she lived in the cupboard under the stairs. Then, Dudley’s friend had said something to their parents’ about Dudley’s messy little cousin and the Dursley’s ‘moved’ her into the smallest bedroom of the house.
"Don't forget the dead mom," He muttered, obviously meaning it casually, almost like a joke.
“We must have a drink sometime!” Mr. Weasley insisted delightfully. “What is that you’ve got there? Oh, you’ve got Muggle money—exchanging it? Oh—Molly look!” He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger’s hand.
Persephone pursed her lips before smiling sheepishly, “My finest hour.”
"You know perfectly well what I mean."
Instead of dirt caked roots, she pulled out of the earth a small, ugly looking baby with pale green, mottled skin. It looked like the baby was screaming at the top of its lungs—the fact that it had lungs was extraordinary.
Taking a risk, she jumped up onto the bookshelf and started climbing, pulling herself up, higher and higher off the ground. She hit the ceiling sooner than she had hoped but she found it was much higher than she’d given it credit for.
The Black Lake was to the south of the castle and sparkled in the morning sun. She had seen some students in early September swim in it while the weather was still fresh from summer but no one ventured too far out. Apparently, there was a Giant Squid inhabiting the deep waters. Daphne had spoken a lot of it and how in the Slytherin common room, the giant squid passed by the large windows underwater. Another reason Persephone wanted to be Slytherin: really cool common room.
“Touch nothing, Draco,” Lucius Malfoy told his son sternly as Draco took an interest in an item on display.
She remembered why she was there, and put the cloak aside, back in its packaging. She’d return it to her dorm later.
“You did at least five years of ballet for that joint movement, you must have!” She said, putting in another bobby pin.
She wanted the situation far from her but unfortunately, she came with the situation. A short day after her…conversation…with Ben, she began to feel familiar feelings.
Ron blinked, “Oh, yeah, I could ask him to take Norbert off your hands, Hagrid.”
“Wait what?” She stopped walking. She suddenly had a sick feeling in her stomach that Ben could hear her.
It seemed so unbelievable that everyone in the house liked her. Except maybe the ghoul in the attic, who howled and dropped pipes whenever he thought things got too quiet. The mirror up above the kitchen mantel place seemed to have it in for Persephone, always calling at her to tie her hair up.
"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."
She screamed and pulled at her hair and could barely breathe as she sobbed. She stumbled to the bathroom when her legs gave out she screamed—every terrible thought she’d ever had printed itself behind her eyelids and she couldn’t stop sobbing.
‘People who indirectly look at a basilisk are stunned. I just need to get a bunch of people to indirectly look at a large snake, which shouldn’t be too hard,’ Her thoughts were quickly unwinding. ‘If enough people are stunned under Dumbledore’s watch, the board of governors will need to step in and it’ll be the last thing he does as headmaster. I just need a bunch of mirrors…’
Suddenly, he let his hands drop and she felt a cold sensation down her middle as he stumbled away, “Okay, so I have a spell—” Before he could finish whatever he was saying, he bumped into the wall, right by a mounted deer head.
“What’s up?” She asked.
"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward
“Have you ever danced before?” She asked him as she got up on pointe for practice. He looked ready to freak out.
It seemed that it was only when the snow had finally started mounting on the ground that everyone truly felt the Christmas spirit. Persephone’s classmates all spoke excitedly about their plans for the holidays—Susan was telling her and Daphne excitedly about how her father was planning to take her down south to visit the Egyptian pyramids (apparently, only seen to the magical eyes, the pyramids were decorated with miles and miles of beautiful lights, going all around) when Pansy appeared.
“Errol is not the fastest,” George commented.
Persephone re-told the story and when she finished, she wasn’t too sure with what McGonagall thought of it.
"I’m—Persephone Potter—but I go by Lily. Lily Potter,” She said quickly when she saw her amazed face. She’d decided before leaving the Dursleys’ car that the entire wizarding world knew her as Persephone Potter, the Girl Who Lived and what not, and she didn’t want that. And she already had a name similar enough to hers—well, it was related to flowers (Persephone being the goddess of spring and flowers) and related to hell (Persephone being the goddess of the Underworld and Lilith being the mother of all demons), so why not just Lily?
She jumped up, standing and staring over to whoever had called to her.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
A nasty, horrible feeling twisted in her chest and her mouth went dry. Daphne…liked Hades? Like,
“Find anything cool, Dad?” Fred asked eagerly.
“I’ve been trying to execute some muggle culture in school for some time now—theatre is a good way of introducing our young purebloods to muggle culture. I am to be conducting a musical this year and being as you will be joining the dance classes from now on—how would you like to try out?”
Taken aback, she nodded. Then, awkwardly, she cleared her throat, “Yes, I suppose we will be spending time together.” Then she tried laughing, “Truthfully, I didn’t even know he knew how to dance.”
is a Potter.”
“I hang around Hagrid and he takes me in there sometimes, is that a crime?” He was becoming defensive, glaring at her.
“Oh,” She felt stupid for mishearing the word. “Stop avoiding the question.”
There were some more old-fashioned cuts but she quickly found that there many clothes that were more modern. The school uniform for girls consisted, in winter, a skirt and long sleeved-white blouse with buttons, with a sweaters lined with silver at the hems. There were trousers as well, which she hoped were also for girls. There was a selection of different styled tights—some patterned, some just plain black—and the socks were all the same, with the silver lining. It wasn’t until she found a silver lined tie that had a description under it that the silver changed to match your house color that she understood the silver. The summer inner robes were a short, puffy sleeved shirt with the same skirt and tie. There was also a dress option, a tight fitted, to above the knee robe with a clean cut thick Peter Pan collar with shoulders.
if they bothered to openly acknowledge it, naming themselves something as mundane as ‘boyfriends’ (and ‘mates’ was right out).
Draco found the door easily; he’d grown up visiting Grimmauld Place, after all, and had spent enough time here in the past month to fill in the gaps in his memory. Harry had had Hermione place it just off the sitting room down on the first floor, where anyone passing by might think it was a closet. He had recalled Hagrid mentioning something about permits and documentation being required, but as it was a last-minute gift idea, he hadn’t exactly submitted the proper paperwork for the space, so the less conspicuous it looked, the better. Besides, it wasn’t as if the Ministry was in any fit state to comb through the Grimmauld Place blueprints and notice an improperly permitted extension, so he could just put in the request later.
you still care about what other people think you should and shouldn’t do?”
Draco rapped him on the temple with the hilt of his wand. “Spells for the bedroom, obviously!”
. It was one of the most frustrating things about the prat.
, he thought steam might start spouting from his ears as he marched back to the lift and punched the button to take him back to the Atrium. He imagined he could hear the tile cracking under each stomping step he took, stalking toward the public Floos, and when he barked, “Headmistress Minerva McGonagall’s Office!” as his destination, several people threw him frightened looks, one witch even pulling her young daughter close to her side.
“Your parents are…Muggles?” Draco asked, in that same sort of strained tone of forced politeness Narcissa used with Harry. As if he didn’t well know Hermione was Muggleborn—he’d certainly thrown enough slurs at her over the years about her blood status.
Harry lifted a brow. “…Thought you said that look pissed you off.”
Was this Weasley’s home, then? Or Potter’s? It certainly didn’t scream ‘Grimmauld Place’ to him, nor did it seem like something worth staging a legal back-and-forth over, so Weasley’s home it must be.
horrible. With a lump in his throat, Draco settled down before his roll-top desk, clearing away anything irreplaceable, in case the letter was a Howler, and carefully broke the seal.
“Be a mate and let us see the memory if you give your old man a heart attack, yeah?” Ron called after him as Draco marched up the stairs.
“I was the one who asked for it,” Draco reminded him, continuing on down.
His mother waved a rolled-up parchment in one hand as she brightly click-clacked across the marble floors of the entryway to make her way into the den, where Draco presently lay sprawled across the sofa. “An Owl’s brought something for you, Darling. From the Ministry.”
Harry leaned closer while Draco fidgeted with the tie, inhaling sharply. “You smell like—” He wrinkled his nose in amusement. “Like—a campfire.”
. Draco ignored him.
care.”
“We sure as shit
“‘Um, you know’? After that speech, I had hoped you’d grown more eloquent overnight, but alas.”
This didn’t seem to matter to the owl, though, as whatever magical energies it was attuned to seemed to ping true, and so long as Draco kept above the clouds and flapped until he felt in his gizzard or craw or whatever body part birds navigated by that it was time to descend, he felt confident he’d make it to his destination eventually.
The phone rang, making Persephone jump out of her reverie. Aunt Petunia rushed around to get it while Dudley opened a golden wrist watch. She returned a few minutes later looking solemn and concerned.
Ben sort of laughed, “That rhymed.” He muttered.
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted her hair as they looked into the forest.
And speaking of her aunt,
Persephone winced looked up from the letter and gulped. Uncle Vernon was still staring at her and she handed him the letter. He read it once through and looked up, considering her. Now he knew she wasn’t allowed magic—he could punish her without worrying the magical consequences.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione and Persephone. Both girls leapt up, Persephone pulling him up so Hermione could perform the counter curse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he just about collapsed again had it not been for Persephone holding him upright by the arm.
He shifted uncomfortably and broke her gaze, “Well, that’s all I wanted to say…so…I’m going to—”
The twins came with the trio, following behind. Persephone got Hermione a strawberry ice cream and Ron a blueberry icey pop while she got her pink lemonade. She made the twins let her buy them each a slushy, as they had never had one. It was much too hot to not have something cold. Ron was fascinated by a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies while Hermione and Persephone dragged him off, discussing ink types while they entered the shop next-door.
