“Good. Do you need a bit more of a break?” Malfoy asked, his voice softening a bit “The next bit isn’t going to be too pleasant.” He warned him.
As he gathered wood for the pyre Harry could feel the weight of Malfoy's words, 'I promised', and the question kept coming back. What did he need from Malfoy? He wanted everything, he wanted to see every part of him, understand the man he was now more than he wanted him to embark in the impossible mission of understanding Harry when Harry could barely understand himself. He wanted to
“She is, she’s here under observation for a day but it seems like she’ll be just fine, and she got her face all over the news,” she reassured him.
Harry watched powerless as Malfoy gradually unravelled before him. It was a frightening sight, like an earthquake opening the ground beneath his feet, the unbridled powers of nature unleashing destruction. Malfoy had been cool, in control and solid in the midst of uncertainty, seeing him blanche and crumble in the chair sent Harry’s guts twisting, he had no more secure anchors if Malfoy lost his resolve, he had no solid ground to stand on.
“Setting boundaries, good, Potter. What are they?” Zabini nodded with a pleased smile and a twinkle in his eyes.
His progress was tangible, literally. He spent a lot of time poking his new arm, which was starting to look remarkably like the old one. Where there used to be a gash on his chest, now only a faded discoloured patch was left. Harry could barely see it most days. But most importantly, he didn’t feel like he would split open every time he sneezed; he wasn’t afraid of breathing too deeply.
Draco glanced at the small group, gathered in the embassy foyer, exactly where they'd met three months prior, each of them so different from when they started.
Granger snorted, "Sadly I like my men naturally redheaded, pasty white and married to me. I want you purely for your skills, Malfoy."
you made reaching the end all that more exciting. Thank you for enduring my stress and rambling and for being a great friend.
“What’s different now?” Harry asked, ignoring the twist in his stomach at the thought of Draco leaving, now that they finally agreed on giving a relationship a real chance.
With a lot of time free to wonder why Malfoy wouldn’t be able to take care of him and had to pawn him off to someone else.
“Draco, stop teasing and fuck me,” Harry whined, tilting his hips back to try and get Draco where he wanted him.
"How do you suggest we proceed?" he asked, picking leaves out of his once sterile equipment. There were some broken windows and the roof was bent where a tree had fallen on it, but the barebone medical tools he had seemed undamaged, if wet.
“He needed an escort for his mother to accompany him to visit his fiancée’s grave and the department of correction wouldn’t give him one so I went, alright?” Ron cracked. “Merlin, you made it sound like we were having an affair or something,” he grumbled.
The day of work was long and gruelling. By the time they cleaned up the hospital, reconstructed the roof and moved on to houses and village streets to clean, Harry's tank top was soaked with sweat. The humidity in the air did nothing to lessen the heat. His arms ached and he was only too happy to walk into the river with the other youths to clean off the mud and sweat before sitting down for a simple and light lunch, still dripping wet but refreshed.
This time Malfoy walked through, with the same “Good morning, Potter, how are we feeling this fine morning?” His cheerful greeting marred by a rough edge to his voice.
Given the restricted time limit and his language challenges, he had very little options, which brought him to knocking on Potter's door.
"You say that as if it would be something new for me," Malfoy replied with a raised eyebrow. "As much as luxury suites fit my entire aesthetic, it's not how I usually live."
Harry took off his glasses placing them on the nightstand before rolling over on his stomach, pulling his knees under himself and arching his back, his face shoved into one of the fluffy pillows still littering the bed.
“Ready when you are.” Dana gave him the go ahead and he rescinded the adhesion charm keeping the patch on Potter’s chest. He levitated it away and blood started trickling out of the wound at a sedated pace.
Harry grinned and nodded, sitting up a little straighter. He was getting his second dose and he was starting training, which he hoped would give him more control over this mental link. More control meant he could go deeper, get more than the random fleeting glimpse. Malfoy gave him a suspicious look at his unexpected enthusiasm so he toned it down a bit.
He could recall the last time their paths crossed, almost ten years prior, at Draco's sentencing. Shacklebolt and McGonagall had campaigned for everyone to get a fair trial and there had been massive use of Veritaserum during every step of the proceeding. He'd felt the taste of bile on his tongue as he was compelled to report on every last horrifying and cowardly act he'd been party to, the weeks in Azkaban an uninterrupted nightmare. And then Granger had stepped up to the witness stand. Draco had her screams of tortured pain still resonating in his ears as she delivered a potion-compelled character testimony.
“Off you go, Mr Potter, out on an adventure. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” she added, holding the door open for him.
“Yes, Potter, you’re a very special boy, a true medical wonder.” Draco rolled his eyes, unable to keep the hint of exasperated fondness out of his voice. He holstered his wand and started heading out.
If you've been following closely you know the days are running out so the tag 'preparing for death' becomes extremely relevant in this chapter.
“Good point. And you can’t kill him, since you’re temporarily incapacitated. Looks like things lined up very nicely.” Seamus chuckled.
If you pick up on all the nerdy pirate references I owe you my heart and whatever you ask for in the comments (whithin reason) but it's got to be all of them.
"This is Poddar Home, or as it used to be called Uktarsh Bagh," Draco replied, guiding him up the massive staircase to the upper floor.
Harry bit his tongue until they left the table and split ways, but as soon as he was sitting at the bar with just Hermione he couldn't hold it back anymore.
“No, he went to help Mummy’s friend.” Rose provided helpfully. Harry turned from her to Ron, both eyebrows raised in a silent question about this friend of mummy’s that needed help on a Sunday morning.
In those quiet moments, Draco looked at him, the dying sun turning his profile into cut bronze, and saw the fire that never left his green eyes. He'd imagined Potter would retire to a life of leisure after the war. He'd seemed the type to need to settle down, process his trauma and get a family, go back to a peaceful home. But he'd miscalculated. The fight wasn't done for Potter, and there was no home for him in England, just like there was no home for Draco there, not anymore.
They returned to the city only after every last person had recovered from the curse and the land was completely cleansed from its influence, and Potter insisted on sending a message to Granger immediately. The absurdity of using a Muggle phone to call the Four Seasons and discuss the crafting of a series of water mirrors was entirely lost on him, apparently.
He looked like he dropped out of a wet dream, clad in black robes, flowing around him like they were liquid and his hair done up like some northern warrior god. He had at least three layers of clothes on him and he still painted the most erotic picture Harry had ever seen. How he didn’t die from overheating dressed like that in the middle of August was a whole different question, one Harry’s brain did not have enough blood to ask at the moment. Harry was too busy ogling to worry about Teddy jumping down the bed and charging at the man with a delighted cry of “Draco!”.
“Yessir” Harry replied, too excited about finally getting ahead on recovering his arm to pay too much attention to Malfoy’s mothering.
He sent a note back to her, there was no point in trying to dissuade her, and deep down he didn’t want to. He needed to have her infusing new fight into him if he was going to go through the hearing and the subsequent investigation.
"Some communities, after being isolated, ended up destroying themselves in increasingly brutal incidents of accidental magic," Yuvarani explained.
Harry nodded along to the instructions, reaching for the covers to pull them back up. Being able to move more freely now that there wasn’t a gaping hole smack in the middle of his chest was a nice boon, he couldn’t wait to have his other hand back as well. Malfoy seemed to be a little more himself after successfully patching him up, the deadpan dressing down of his colleagues felt right.
"Granger said she got the better view out of the deal and she's happy to give up the complimentary breakfast for two attached to the room. As long as you don't murder me in my sleep, I'm good," he replied.
"Went better than we expected," Taranjit joked, a teasing twinkle in his black eyes as he looked at Draco.
Tracking him down hadn't been easy, from South America to the Middle East, and then up and down the African continent. From war zone to climate catastrophe, he never stayed somewhere for too long before moving on to the next emergency. She'd been lucky to pin him down in the Sahara Desert, in the middle of a small medical crisis. She'd packed a bag and got the first Portkey to Cairo as soon as she got news from the English consulate about Nundus being spotted hunting too far from their Unplottable territories. The news about it travelled north to England far slower than the creatures did, getting close enough to Abu Simbel to kill a few wizards. By the time the pack made it to the Toshka Lakes, international support had been asked for and Hermione was making her way south along the Nile with a very small security detail, hoping to intercept the medical team.
“What did you do?” Harry asked, his eyes flitting between the two of them. He could taste a good story, and he just needed someone to fill him in.
"Oh, that's smart of her, taking the one desi Auror along." Padma commented biting into a piece of burfi.
Harry could feel tears well in his eyes. "Taranjit," he whispered, his tongue caressing the syllables like a comfort food he'd forgotten the taste of. He wasn't alone. "You have three children."
The hot air hit Harry like a wall as soon as he stopped spinning and dropped the Portkey on the rough tile floor. There had to be a better way to travel. They went from the below zero temperature of London to the hot day of Mumbai; the rotten smell of the Thames was already a memory as he breathed in the salt of the ocean. Over the grumbling of the rest of the party, he could hear the crashing of waves below them. Several people were already holding onto the railings around the light, others were looking out the windows to see the coast in the distance.
"I feel so objectified right now," Draco sighed. "But I reckon you can live without my input. I did nothing more than mend some minor injuries, anyone can do that."
Eventually, Draco cuts Harry a glance—and it’s sheepish, almost. Doesn’t fit the sharp cut of cheekbones. “I was guilty, and you set me free.”
But Harry has already taken out his wand, teeth gnawing through a silted spell. A great groaning underneath their bodies, in the bowels of the home. Pansy’s eyes flash back at him, jaw gone slack, eyes clouded. “Potter, don’t you
Malfoy casts a tempus charm, then shoves it off with a wave of his hand. He appears distracted, one leg crossed over the other, brow furrowed. Wearing a slim grey turtleneck and finely cut trousers. Among such spartan surroundings, he could be a clothing model, draped for a photograph.
“I’m sorry.” Malfoy does sound sorry—and so gentle in it that Harry regrets lashing out badly, and immediately, and feels his brow warp up with involuntary pain.
It’s the kind of winter that wipes clean the slate of the city. Big sloping white ribbons of breath. Cold air like a clipped, jagged tongue, up and down the throat.
The house is concealed with charms much like those obscuring 12 Grimmauld; Harry recognizes the almost-invisible glimmer. Ezra raises a broad hand and dissolves the signature. It’s a grim face that greets them. Raven-bricked and shuttered; the only hint of light the gleam of sun off a large brass knocker. Diana presses the tip of her wand to the knocker, and it shudders, then glows. A lock unclicks.
If this stings, Draco doesn’t let on. “I was guilty of thinking I should’ve done what was asked of me, that I should’ve—” this does sting, and he shakes it, takes a mouthful of dry martini. An olive bobs to the bottom of the glass. “I hated you. I hated you with every cell in my body. I thought you were so lucky.”
He comes to on the broken floor of a study, a stream of bright red staining his fingers. His nose feels hot and everyone is circled around him, staring. It feels a lot like his pain in the Percivals foyer, frantic that a girl was being torn apart below.
Maybe he ought to feel self-conscious about being so bare, for laying so much of himself out—but Malfoy leans forward on his legs, elbows bent on knees, tipping his glass to his lips, letting the rest of it drain, and Harry feels nothing but an itch at the back of his neck, a burn in the flats of his feet.
, wasn’t something I could pretend, either. And I had wanted it, it was my idea, but I was bad at learning. Bad at listening.”
This pain—betrayed—is different from the other homes. It cowers like a cold dog; wrapped up in itself. Holding itself. Bleeding all over the floor.
“It’s the Percivals,” Malfoy murmurs as Harry joins the fold. And if he is wearing a lovely dark jumper, charcoal-colored, Harry doesn’t notice—or notices, and then erases the memory. “They’ve had an attack.”
Harry tugs at the laces of his green trainers. “I can’t...separate what I’ve been through from what others have been through, from the—the unhealthy desire to make it right. To make it better, to disappear. I have a complex.”
“She died just after the trials.” Malfoy continues. “She was...not herself. They tried to help her, but—so long in one place, so starved of light and human contact, she wasn’t herself. She wasn’t willing anymore.”
In the dark of a house already repaired, Draco folds Harry’s hand in his. To look or not to look, that is the—Harry does not look. Is afraid the house will fall on top of them if he does. He can only be a heartbeat; a quick, embarrassing breath.
“When I was nine,” he begins, “I asked my mother for swimming lessons. I wanted to go into the pond, on the property, but I was afraid I would drown. It wasn’t a proper thing to do, of course, it was rather pedestrian, to
“Sorry, mate, ‘Mione had errands to run and the kids really wanted to see you so...” Ron apologized, sitting down on the chair next to the bed.
“I see. Quite daring of you.” He commented with a smile that went straight through Draco like a breath of fresh air in the summer heat. The gratuitous approval of his choices wasn’t something he got often and it felt better than he was ready to admit. “I’m afraid I don’t have any more advice to offer. These are delicate matters, quite unique to each patient, but feel free to call again, the school year doesn’t start for a while yet.”
"Where are we?" Malfoy asked quietly, as if sensing there was something worthy of reverence in front of them.
After that, things progressed a lot more smoothly. Draco joined the local educators and met the woman who'd taken over as guru, trying to save as much of the traditional practises as she could. They had managed surprisingly well, creating a carefully balanced community. They doggedly continued to reconstruct that balance after each episode of wild accidental magic. They copied all the books they managed to save, rebuilt houses, took care of each other and kept going day after day.
"Of course, you did." Malfoy sounded more resigned than annoyed. Like he should have expected Ron to spill the beans. He should have. It was Ron after all.
"Why didn't you use it to cure the people out there?" Harry tried not to stare at the way Malfoy’s neck bobbed as he drank.
I know it's a few days late but that's how it's going to be for the foreseeable future. Academic work is taking precedence, but I still got your back and I didn't completely skip the week, so kudos to me. The chapter was supposed to be longer, have one more scene in it, but I decided to post it as is so you'd get something before June.
“This time it’s putting you in the position to jeopardize your career,” Blaise hummed “Is he worth it?” He asked, wondering if Draco was ever going to let go of his weird thing for Potter. Some days Pansy and he thought it was over but those two always found a way back into each other’s orbits, it would have been funny if it hadn’t been maddening.
Harry did end up studying up on West Bengal, not only to soothe his anxiety after he'd given Hermione his availability, but because, like Parvati said, he wanted it to be his chance to touch and experience Indian culture and find his roots, things his father would have probably taught him if he'd had the chance.
"You're worried I'm not taking this seriously enough, that I'm, Merlin forbid, enjoying some part of it instead of just suffering for the cause. Let me reassure your sanctimonious soul, Potter. Unlike someone else’s,
Harry hummed softly, letting the silence stretch between them, warm and comfortable as they winded down a little.
“Want to play some chess instead?” Harry proposed, resigned to the fact that no amount of stink eye was going to stop Malfoy, now that he was on a mission.
At around three he remembered his therapist's advice to meditate and do his breathing exercises to balance himself out and maybe get some sleep before he had to deal with his smug face again.
Harry thought he was prepared this time around. Hermione hadn't kept anything from him, she'd been upfront about the members of the team, the accommodation at the Four Seasons, the hike it would take to reach the isolated enclave, and the fact that she would spend a lot of time off negotiating and lobbying with local government to devise a better tracking system for magical children, re-hauling the system in place for the past three centuries.
Draco turned his left arm so Griffith could see the Dark Mark still undeniably there, etched into his skin and clearly recognisable even with the modification Draco did to it.
Ron decided to hang around and finish the game on his own against the board, it was surprisingly challenging for a kid’s board. Malfoy came in around five with a set of vials and an expression that meant business, only to hesitate when he saw him in the room.
Morning came unusually early with the insistent sound of his alarm spell waking him up after what felt like mere moments of sleep. He resigned himself to casting a glamor on himself to erase the bags under his eyes, he couldn’t afford to show himself vulnerable around the hospital, especially now, with his disciplinary hearing coming up.
“I know about that one already,” Harry told him softly. He knew Malfoy had been branded. Everybody did.
The one between him stepping out of the Floo at St Mungo’s and him opening the door to his office to find Healer Moreschi waiting there for him, with a bright green envelope in hand. The shade of green that only spelt trouble for him.
“Merlin, I love you,” Draco sighed before realizing what he’d just said. Fuck he hadn’t meant to say it like that. It was way too soon, and in terrible context. He didn’t love Harry just because he wanted to be tied up and hung from the ceiling. It sure was an added bonus though. And now he’d gone and implied that by dropping the big declaration over an international Floo call about bondage. The silence stretched between them, and he was about to beg Harry to say something when a small smile stretched on his lips.
Thank you all for your patience, with me while I deal with this pesky thing called real life. Here's an extra long extra painful chapter for you. Chapter ten will not be up before July 20th (and even that is optimistic) so make sure to savour this one.
“No,” he said simply, sitting down in the armchair, crossing his legs and smiling up at Harry. It was so easy to push him off balance. Just a word and the line of his shoulders wasn’t quite set so straight, hesitance opening cracks in his stance. This was a much more fun game, and it was played entirely on Draco’s turf and by Draco’s rules.
favourite between Draco and Harry. Harry insisted he was the one since he was the Godfather, had a room just for him at his house, and bought him his first broom. Draco argued in turn that they were actual blood relatives and he introduced him to his celebrity crush. Soup won the debate pointing out he provided sandwiches and safety from that kind of nonsense. Teddy was too polite to admit Soup was right, but Harry and Draco both knew the truth as it was spoken.
As soon as they got out of the city limits, they stepped into a jungle environment, and even though the path was clearly marked and hard to lose, Harry felt like they were walking through a different world. They didn't exchange many words until they reached Dabosha falls and the quieter Malfoy was, the more on edge Harry became. They were going in blind and Merlin knew what would be waiting for them behind the Muggle-Repelling Charms in the Unplottable land. Still, when they got to the bottom of the waterfall he had to stop and admire it for a moment, the crash of it. The water foaming in the basin under it was mesmerising and the air was so clean it lifted his chest as he breathed.
Draco nodded and reached out to shake Harry’s hand, a cool dry palm against Harry’s own, feeling like a new beginning.
“Relax, Potter,” he murmured, his thumb slowly tracing Harry’s bottom lip. “Get comfortable, we’ll be here for a while.”
As much as he wanted to go off on a rant about incompetence there was no time for it. "I'm going to cast the Structural Support Charm and you're going to sustain it while I work on the lungs. Can you do that?"
"Do I?" Draco turned his arm so Potter could see the entire image, the faded skull and vibrant scales of the snake were traversed by a wooden staff, filling the empty spaces between the coils of the snake. It was a simple detail, easily overlooked by one who knew of the Dark Mark, but it turned the vile brand into a rod of Asclepius. Potter's eyes flicked between his face and his arm, putting the pieces together.
“That’s privileged information you’re not supposed to have,” Draco replied, distracting him with a kiss.
“I’m your rebound from Weasley, aren’t I? I suppose I should feel honoured?” Malfoy scoffed, pushing the chair closer to the bed and pulling the rolling tray between them. “You do know the board is self-playing, right?” he asked Harry as he set up.
“I believe otherwise. Weasley and I think there’s an actual person on the other side that could expose you to dangers we did not account for,” Malfoy replied.
With a decisive pull, he dragged him back down so he could open his trousers and dispose of them in short order, sending them to join his shirt on the bench. Harry unbuttoned his kurta and wiggled out of it, dropping it straight to the floor in a pile.
He needed to get in contact with Finnigan to go over Potter’s missions to see what kind of spells, rituals and wild energies he’d been exposed to that might have staid dormant until now, and he needed to consult with an expert on magical residue handling. That would be Healer Bonhomme ideally, if he was lucky enough to get him to spare a minute for him.
"How's Uncle Harry looking, darling?" Ron asked from the kitchen where he was busy trying to keep Hugo from taking a spill into the pot of soup. He was still short enough to stand on the counter but definitely tall enough to put his nose, hands, sometimes feet, knees, and elbows where they didn't belong. Harry was starting to understand Ron’s insistence on having a breakfast counter, it allowed him to be in the kitchen and still survey the entire living area… And it was convenient for breakfast purposes.
“It’s not the boring part bothering me, it’s just… I don’t know how to explain it. They’re really vivid, like it’s not really dreams.” He sighed, running a hand through his hair, trying to formulate a coherent thought. “They happened to me once before but it couldn’t possibly be the same thing.” He told him.
He ran his hand over the surface, it was polished wood with a small metallic latch to open the compartment that stored the pieces. He was no expert but it looked well loved, and too nicely crafted to be something found laying around in a hospital. He easily opened it and on the underside of the top he saw the crude lettering of a child’s handwriting spelling out D. L. MALFOY.
Morning arrived quietly, the rising sun creeping in through the blinders cut the room in neat slices of light and shade.
“Then what is it? This is good press. You saved the Golden Boy, they’ve got nothing on you.” Blaise reasoned. “Unless… How did you save our gloriously fallen hero?” he asked, the suspicion bleeding in his voice.
"I can only speak for myself, Granger, I have no more sway on Potter than you do," Draco pointed out.
The British delegation met up with Healer Gupta and her trainees at a secluded bend of the Hoogly river. They were a good ways away from the city centre of Calcutta but they were in no way outside of its limit, either. They all loaded into a low and wide wooden boat. Draco felt it when they crossed the border of inconceivably sturdy Muggle-Repelling Charms and floated slowly along a new branch of the river that hadn't been there a moment before. They docked not long after that, on a small island emerging from the murky water of the river. The group split up as soon as they got off the boat. Granger took Potter, her Charms Professor and Miss Yuvarani to go meet the elders and start exploring the possibility of establishing a new gurukul for the community. That left Draco with Auror Foster, who looked for all intents and purposes like she'd lost a bet to Potter and she suspected foul play, and a St Mungo's Healer he hadn't bothered learning the name of. Along with the Bengali Healers and Miss Rana, they were tasked to open up shop at the temporary medical centre and investigate the general state of the population.
“Then there was a door and it shut me out of your defences and the door was gone, so I couldn’t get back in.”
“What did you see?” he asked, encouraging Harry to analyze what he’d seen, figure out the details on his own.
“You’re very knowledgeable about my work, Healer Malfoy.” Bonhomme commented with a warm smile, pushing his glasses up his arched nose “It could be a bond, but there’s many reasons why a host may not flush out the residue.” He told him “It happens because the residue isn’t… how you say? A stranger to the man’s own.” He explained “If I get cursed with my own wand for example, or by my children, my magic knows them, it has a hard time pushing them out. Much simpler explanation than a spontaneous bond, non?” He tilted his head to the side, rubbing his cheek for a moment ad he thought
Draco huffed. “I do not sound like that, and Blaise is ready to sue them all for harassment and disruption of public service.”
"Maybe?" Harry replied, honestly unsure. He still saw the refined aristocracy of the arch of Malfoy's lips and the long elegant fingers, so similar to his mother's, and he couldn't reconcile that with the rough life of a disaster relief volunteer. But he'd counted the freckles on his cheekbones where he'd worked under the sun, and felt the calluses of his hands grown from his tireless wand work; he'd seen how Malfoy had changed into the man sitting in front of him. Wasn't it disrespectful to keep looking for the boy he used to be?
"I liked you better when you gave me two months to prepare," he grumbled, wandering off in search of more bubbly so he could forget the stupid decisions he just got talked into.
It wasn’t Hanson walking in with his breakfast, though. Upon asking he was informed it was her day off and he found himself missing her cutting take on the day’s news. It wasn’t just an injection of energy first thing in the morning, he realized, she was his connection to the goings on in the outside world, everyone who came visit had a stark lack of information for him. The realization gave him a moment of pause. His friends were well intentioned, trying to distract him, but it ended up making him feel cut off and pushed aside and endlessly frustrated about his lack of involvement. He still hadn’t received an update on the case he’d been working on when he got injured.
“Ok, I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s the plant for?” Potter asked, amusement clear in his voice as he looked at it. At least someone here was having a good time with this exercise in futility.
"Do you really think I wouldn't have a contingency plan for that? I'm not some fool jumping into danger for the fun of it, thank you very much. I may have changed but not that much."
I absolutely give up on trying to predict a schedule. Chapters will come as the Lord sends them, trust that the fic is not abandoned and it will get finished, probably not in a timely manner but the goal is to finish this before graduation.
He dropped the potions at the nurses’ station and had Brown called to pick them up. That’s when he saw him, redhead, rumpled uniform, like the universe was finally giving him a boon. Weasley was walking towards him.
The end result didn’t change much either way and after three games Harry sighed, leaning back against the pillows.
Draco wished he'd paid more attention to what he was eating; the different smells of spices mixed in his nose as more and more plates and bowls were brought to the table, but he was too engrossed in the discussion of balancing a wix's magical core with their life force and their environment. He was used to North African cuisine, mostly accustomed to the heat level, but he wasn't prepared for the way bitter and sweet mixed and played off each other along with the floral notes of cardamom and saffron.
so do yourselves a favor and go read it this week while you wait for me to work through next chapter and this pesky thing called academic duties.
“Those are some pretty big shoes to fill.” She commented “Did you know there are healers who work with Aurors too? They’re field medics, they’re like Aurors but much cooler.” She mentioned with a conspiratory smile. That seemed to pique Teddy’s attention.
There was a stand next to the library where people were taking turns frying gujiyas and giving them out, always still warm, crispy and sticky and perfectly sweet.
“No, I have to brew Potter’s next batch of potions and I have an early shift on Monday. Aadhya can’t be there and I don’t know who else can be trusted at the hospital,” he sighed.
“I know we can.” Harry nodded, a spark of something bright reigniting deep in his chest. Like a candle in a winter night, not enough to warm you, but enough to remind you of what a roaring fire feels like.
Draco nodded with a soft hum. “So, what is it that you really want?” That was the million-dollar question in the end.
"We'll work on it," Draco smiled, retrieving the toy and handing it over, "You're already pretty good," he assured.
“It could be just your body trying to cope with the depletion of your core, relieving situations where you had to accumulate power. But just in case I want to go over your most recent cases to check that you haven’t been exposed to any volatile rituals that could have accidentally bonded you to something or someone.” Draco put the chart down with an annoyed huff, damn Murphy and his shoddy note taking. There was almost nothing of use, he’d have to go through the ministry to get the information he needed.
“Auror Potter, it’s such a privilege to have you with us.” He said, pushing his glasses up his nose and holding out a hand to shake.
“Goddam Bingley.” He whispered, standing up and picking it up. He quickly broke the seal, bringing the lens up to his eye and squinting when the blinding light coming from Potter hit his eyes. He took a moment to adjust to the brightness, of course Potter’s energy would be so obnoxiously…
“Draco, Astoria is at peace, even if you bring down the entire organisation she’s not coming back. And Potter...” Blaise blew out a breath “As soon as he’s out of your hands he’s going right back to stepping in front of curses. Is this really worth killing yourself over?”
"Why did you bring him on, then? He's a Malfoy, his family were probably here starving people and stealing art in the 1770s."
“Still, you have no grounds to stand on for cutting his pay.” Blaise insisted “And I will remind you that you agreed to expedite proceedings. Unless something substantial comes up in the next three days this will be dropped and stricken from Healer Malfoy’s record.” Andrews’ was about to argue but he was interrupted by a redhead woman on his left wearing the cerulean robes of a mind healer.
“One you chose for your own.” Draco reminded him. Soup had explicitly asked for permission to follow Draco once he moved out of the Manor and wouldn’t listen to reason when Draco told him there was no need. Narcissa had sided with the elf in that argument and that had been it.
“On the other hand, we have a perfectly good trained potionist who not only caught on to, but was directly involved in stopping said criminal activity, and whose research recently put the hospital on the radar of the international scientific community after a long stretch of silence,” she continued, a smile opening on her face, mirrored by Draco.
We all knew Astoria and baby Scorpius were dead but now we "see" it happened because of contaminated potions at the hospital and Draco was forbidden from being with them.
“I couldn’t sleep all night, I kept having these odd dreams and now I feel like something crawled in my mouth and died, my head is killing me and I have horrible nausea,” he listed off dutifully.
Nurse Hanson wholeheartedly endorsed his plan and helped him put on a shirt, the buttons entirely outside the realm of his current abilities. She also produced a sling and helped him slide his arm into it, nodding at him in satisfaction.
“Am I now?” Malfoy replied, a smile already tugging at his lips as a teasing glint lit up his eyes. “What did I say about assuming things, Potter?”
Just as he leaned in to kiss her a door materialized in front of Harry, slightly ajar. As he reached for it, it shut and he was back in the darkness in front of the silvery dome, he was back in St. Mungo’s on his next breath.
“You’re not. Want to try again?” he offered, clasping his hands behind his back. Clearly this man was no threat and he wanted to play with him for a bit, he never got to have any fun these days.
“But… I can’t, it’s...” He glanced between Soup’s frown and the raging magic just behind some rather flimsy-looking containment spells.
Harry blinked awake, the bland colour of his hospital room coming into focus as the laboratory disappeared around him like morning mist evaporating under the sun.
“I’m ready,” Harry told him with a determined nod. Malfoy nodded back at him and relaxed against the back of the chair he was sitting in, right next to the bed.
Draco slowly took off his clothes as the first notes of Bach's Aria on the G string caressed his ears. Every movement was measured, stripping off his pyjamas until he stood defenceless in front of Pansy, his underwear doing little to protect him as her gaze pierced him to the bone. He stood straighter, widened his stance a little and squared his shoulders. Only then she handed him a shirt. It was a ghost white colour she often told him brought out the colder shades of his eyes making him look aristocratic and intimidating
He turned, with a frown of confusion as if he wasn't used to his own name. When his eyes settled on her she flinched at the sight of red irises. He froze at her reaction, then quickly waved his wand at his face, and in a blink, they were back to cool grey before disappearing behind dark lenses.
I can't make any promise about when the next chapter's going to be up. Exams are done but things got even more hectic somehow. The idea is to have it up by the halfway point of August but who knows.
“I’ll start,” Harry decided, pushing himself up to sit. “I want to apologize. What I did to you was honestly fucked up. I should have given you some credit, I should have trusted you. I went so far over the line I don’t even know how I can even ask you to forgive me for forcing my way into the Pensieve.” Harry took a slow breath to settle the twist in his stomach at the thought of what he’d done. “Those were incredibly private memories, and I had no right to make demands over them. You had every right to share them at your own pace, or not share them at all, and I took that decision away from you.” Harry looked up from his lap to Draco’s face. “I’m really sorry, and know that if there is any way I can make it better I will. I mean it. Anything.”
"If we could go up you would be able to see the entire city from there. It used to be the eye of Britain on its subjects and now it's the men who freed her standing tall in its centre." Harry looked up at the top quietly, there was something pulling at his heart as he stood under it. He was the exact same as this monument. England had claimed him as its own, making his face a symbol for something Harry wasn't sure he could represent. He never wanted to stand for anything bigger than himself and his family. But without a real family or a definite sense of self, it had been all too easy for other people to build him up into a figurehead. Could he be rededicated too? Find his true meaning now that Voldemort and the war had been gone for a decade?
Draco gave Blaise the tiniest shake of his head. It was already more than he’d hoped to get out of this hearing, and he trusted that in three days things wouldn’t be much different.
“You thought being a healer would assuage your sense of guilt over your involvement in the war, Master Malfoy,” he replied without missing a beat.
When he heard a man address him as 'Sāhab-ji' Harry saw red. It didn't take more than a look to send Griffith away and corner Malfoy before they went back to work.
It was exhilarating to tilt his head back and see he could reach out and take everything he wanted, to see it written on Draco’s face that he only needed to ask, that the reverence Harry saw in his eyes wasn’t misplaced hero worship, it was something more stable, made of sturdier stuff. It was something Harry could lean on and trust it wouldn’t dissolve.
He kept himself behind the cover of trees and shrubbery for good measure as they made their way down the stone path. When Malfoy finally stopped, Harry scanned the environment, trying to catch whoever was going to come and avoid being taken by surprise. But Malfoy didn't seem to be waiting for anyone, he just… unrolled a yoga mat and started a leisurely practice.
"It won't always be this bad, hopefully. Healer Gupta can prevent the worst of these accidents," Draco reassured him.
It didn’t take long to reduce Harry into incoherence, once Draco truly put his mind and tongue to the task. He listened to the litany of curses and moans falling freely and generously from Harry’s mouth, and when he felt Harry was a breath away from shooting his load, he pulled back, eliciting the most satisfying desperate little sob from Harry.
“Not good?” Potter asked, looking up at him with wide green eyes. Draco couldn’t help but notice the badly concealed fear on his face.
It was Ron who broke it eventually, dispelling the oppressive sense of foreboding that filled Harry when he thought about his age. "Which one?"
After accidentally burning his hands on a careless power balancing procedure, Draco followed Healer Gupta out of the village and past the treeline, leaving the trainees under the supervision of Miss Rana to finish the job.
Once again thank you to the mods who put together this fest and my wonderful beta that helped bring this story to light.
“What happened?” he asked. Malfoy cleared his throat, a hint of blush peeking from his collar when Harry finally looked up at his face.
The woman working on Malfoy's arm switched sides and Harry's eyes fell on his pale forearm, the Dark Mark's clean dark lines over it. He could say whatever he liked but Harry knew that he was the same entitled shit he'd always been.
“You made the Prophet’s front page this morning,” She mentioned, sitting down on the chair next to the bed.
Andrews watched her retreating back, completely baffled before resigning himself to the reality of it.
“What do you think they’re making?” Ron asked Malfoy. He looked down at his notes, slowly running his finger down the page.
“About as well as we could expect. I’m suspended from duty pending investigation, but Blaise got them to expedite the proceedings so it’s not going to be long at all. Basically a long weekend.” He told her, taking off his family rings and handing them off to Soup.
Draco woke early in the morning, with the sun hitting his eyes and reminding him they'd forgotten to close the curtains. Potter had wisely fallen asleep with his back to the window, and the white sheets were all tangled with his legs. He was restless even as he slept, but in that moment, with the clear blue sky outlining his profile and the shape of the Golden Temple over his shoulder, he looked at peace, even just for a second. His chest rose and fell slowly. The taste of sweet milk on Potter's lips still haunted Draco and he ached to reach out and run his fingers through his hair, growing longer, and by some miracle, less messy, but he was too afraid to disrupt that moment of peace.
The first time Harry joined Draco and his friends for an outing at Sadistique, it wasn’t nearly as scary as he thought it would be. It was in July, after he came back from the Auror training retreat and Blaise’s attitude helped demystify the whole experience for Harry. There was so much that caught Harry’s attention that he didn’t know what to focus on at first, but what made his guts twist with want, in the end, was watching Blaise kneel at Daphne’s feet, a look of pure adoration on both their faces, as she fed him snacks.
They pulled apart slowly, with more lingering kisses bringing them closer every time they tried to step back. There were no words exchanged between them, no explanation, no justification, but as Harry looked at Malfoy's eyes, the pupils, blown wide, told him everything he needed to know, it wasn't all him in that kiss, it was the drink, and the charge of magic in the air, and a million other coincidences.
"I'm not some kind of mercenary, Granger, you have the trained monkeys at St Mungo's for that." Malfoy didn't bother to hide his distaste as he pushed his hair back from where it stuck to his forehead with sweat. "And I assume you're aware there is no love lost between England and I these days."
There was already movement around the little town, people preparing the dough for gujiya, drums being brought out, and if he looked over Malfoy's shoulder, he could see coloured powders starting to show up in the hands of children. It didn't take long for the unrestrained joy to fill the streets. Song and dance swept through the village, with drums sending clouds of yellow and pink up in the air with every beat. Young men and women chased each other, smearing reds and blues and greens on each other, the elders joining in by Summoning and shaping colourful clouds they could jump through.
I'm fully aware Hermione is going to get up to some questionable practices in the next chapters when it comes to confidentiality and she's basically in constant conflict of interest from here to the end, but it's all in good fun, don't @ me. (It's funny because I'm anon, so you can't @ me until the end of the fest)
“How can you be a neat freak after spending a decade living in tents?” Harry chuckled, wasting no time getting his hands on Draco’s newly exposed skin.
"I thought it would look great on my curriculum and I kinda also wanted to meet Granger," he admitted, pulling a smile out of Draco. "The five-star accommodation was a nice incentive too."
"The Ambassador sent a curse-breaker after me," Healer Gupta told him. "You eat and rest now, he’ll come soon."
Harry glanced down at the empty glass and then back up at Malfoy, holding an equally empty glass, and then he started giggling at the absurdity of Malfoy getting them both high without even trying.
Harry hummed with a small nod, glancing out the window for a moment. He should drop it. He should ask Ron about the case and things at home, chat with Rose about the end of summer...
“I was doing damage control while Potter did his very best to nullify all of our progress. He Apparated us, Blaise! His hand is missing and he side-alonged me because apparently, no other mode of transportation was suitable for him!” Draco’s voice was reaching a bafflingly high pitch by the end of that sentence.
“I know,” Blaise murmured, pulling him up, letting him cling to him and hide his face in his neck as the first sobs wracked him. “I know you do, and you are, Draco, but you’re entitled to happiness too.”
Except this time, they had a leg to stand on. He did use unsanctioned magic to treat Potter and he knew it. Hadn’t even tried to hide it.
"Thank you, your condolences are very late but nonetheless appreciated." He replied with a small tired smile that Harry had no idea what to do with.
“Fine, I will take better care of my sleep schedule if my face offends you, Soup.” Draco relented with a small smile when Soup finally turned around, releasing him from the scrutiny.
Draco hummed with a small nod “Thank you again for taking time for us, professor.” He said, pulling out his wand to cut the connection.
“Careful, Rosie, don’t squish Uncle Harry,” Ron warned her, catching her before she could sit on Harry’s arm. He resituated her on Harry’s good side to avoid any accidents.
"If each of them had an enchanted mirror, washed in the water of the same river, the same water, the same metal…"
Things were a lot less tense and awkward than Harry expected them to be. Malfoy and Hermione were apparently on a first name basis now, and Mrs Weasley was dangerously close to adopting him judging by the amount of food she piled on his plate, commenting on how skinny he was. When did that happen? Yeah, sure, maybe Malfoy was a bit too skinny and the shadows under his eyes were very clear, but it was just because he was so ridiculously pale… And Molly wasn’t supposed to care. Surely, she had reached her maximum children capacity, she had to save space for the existing ones’ future partners, how could she budget in another?
Draco nodded and drew the delicate shapes with practised ease, muscle memory kicking in as he flicked his wand. As Griffith carefully took over sustaining the spell, Draco had a movement of gratitude for Miss Rana taking care of comforting the man—father?—staring at them anxiously from the corner while she spoke with him in hushed tones. At least someone didn't need hand-holding.
“I was on my way home and I thought I’d swing by. How’s Harry?” she asked, loosening the big scarf around her neck and unbuttoning her coat.
"In September. I will take the recruits on a training retreat after my birthday and then take a sabbatical. I have already arranged it with the department."
He dropped the paper on the table and sent the note to Soup, then he sent one to Blaise, asking him if he was up for a night of legal advice that evening. The reply came almost immediately.
Draco loses his composture when Narcissa's furlough gets denied and he thinks he has to go alone to visit Astoria's grave on the anniversary of her death.
"The people's magic is wild and untrained," Healer Gupta said. "Their doshas are not in balance, and their magic hurts them and those around them."
Hermione took off her glasses and hat and sat on a bench at a table far enough from the kitchen side to have a bit of privacy, leaving her two guardian angels to guard the door. Malfoy folded himself gracefully on the bench opposite her. Now that they were out of the harsh light of the sun and he took off his dark glasses, she noticed he was tanner than she remembered him, and there was a smattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose.
He glanced out the big window. They were high up enough that he could see the busy streets of Calcutta sprawling out in front of him like an intricate tapestry drawing an image he couldn't quite decipher. He'd seen the way Potter had looked at him and he was starting to wonder whether he'd made a mistake saying yes to Granger. He was still in time to get a Portkey back to Cairo and then another quick jump and he'd be in Cape Town; he could catch up with Trevor in three days maximum.
“They’re pretty cool.” Harry confirmed “They were the ones who got me here in time so Malfoy could put me back together.” He pointed out, earning himself a satisfied nod from Healer Dana.
"I'm vegetarian. I'm not going to make you eat fish at all," Harry reminded him. "And as much as I'd like to kill you sometimes, street food during monsoons would be an unusually convoluted way to go about it." He smiled at the familiarity of throwing barbs at each other. It was light and with little heat behind them, a comfortable game Harry had forgotten how much he enjoyed.
"I know," Harry murmured, and Draco almost believed he could become to deserve that tenderness. "Let's go back to the hotel, see if Hermione wrote back about the mirrors," he proposed after a minute of letting Draco cry into his shirt.
"Mr Singh has three children, the youngest almost of school age," Draco continued, but Harry was lagging behind.
He let go of Draco’s hand and pulled the glass door open all the way to step out into the balcony. He leaned against the stone balustrade, looking down at the interior garden, the interlocking tiles and the young trees. It had barely been born but Harry could feel centuries of history in the flow of water in the middle of the garden.
“Yeah, sorry, I got distracted.” He replied, realizing he’d been staring at the door after it closed behind Malfoy’s back. He thanked Andromeda when she handed him his tea and Teddy settled in on the edge of the bed.
I caved, there is going to be some plot. Not in this chapter, but it will come I swear, probably in the next one. Thanks to everyone who commented in the last chapter giving me the motivation to keep going and actually write down the outline.
That launched them into a discussion of their shared love for getting pegged by powerful women, which then devolved into the delight of body worship and Harry’s reservations about suspensions, which in turn prompted Blaise into reassuring him about the safety of the practice, as long as the necessary precautions were observed. Harry ended up sharing his struggles with Draco handling a straight razor around his face, and Blaise gave him stories about Daphne and hot wax that sparked more than one idea in Harry’s head.
Malfoy nodded, “Be careful with it, your joints are very delicate right now,” he recommended, stopping at the door of the common room. “Keep the sling on and don’t do anything stupid. I’ll come check on you later.”
“I do think it’s your turn to spill some untold truth now, Potter,” Malfoy deflected with badly concealed curiosity. Harry had to think about it for a while, trying to come up with something that hadn’t been splashed all around the front pages.
"Neither a viable option as you can imagine." Draco nodded, clearly pleased that someone was keeping up.
When they gathered to share lunch, Draco was almost starting to think this might be an easy mission, a nice break from environmental disasters and collapsing buildings. He was fully committed to enjoying his fragrant fish curry and rice, wondering if he could maybe sneak some of those fried veggies that had been served to Potter and Healer Gupta. They smelled too delicious not to try and taste some, but in the end, he didn't get a chance to ask.
Malfoy was already muttering to himself, heading straight into the gaping maw of darkness, the shifting shades of spells reflecting on the wet surface of the light stone around them as he walked without faltering over the unsteady rocks. Harry hurried after him, into a room that was tall enough to stand straight, but not much more than that. In a corner was a massive stalactite, right above the beginning of a small pool of water, dark and still even under the strongest
"Could be better," Malfoy replied, giving her a tired smile, "Never happier to see your face, Sahiba."
“If I didn’t they would aim it at my head.” He replied, finally looking at Blaise, seeing the concern in his face, in his eyes, burning on his tongue, Blaise didn’t need to speak it for Draco to know.
“Alright, dinner will be here any minute now, we’ll leave you to it.” Dana smiled, gathering up all the equipment and following Malfoy out.
Harry shook his head. "Not yet, but I know a lot of my family was there, I tracked down memorial plaques and tombs in a cemetery. Tracking down my Sikh relatives was harder, but there were donations in their name to Harmandir Sahib."
She was good. Offering the position to him would greatly benefit the Hospital’s public image. Giving the department to the man who cleared out the illegal trafficking was probably the one way they could restore even a little bit of dignity for the institute in the public eye.
"Excuse you! I put in a lot of effort to keep your attention and it was extremely effective, you little stalker."
Draco hummed his acknowledgement as he kept working. He wanted to get as much done as possible, but he doubted he could pull a complete reconstruction in one day.
Harry felt the cold grip of embarrassment squeeze him “I’m sorry, I… that was...” he stammered, trying to find the words.
Also, those of you with a sharper eye will have noticed the rating has gone up one more time, draw from that the conclusions you will.
"Very pretty, dad," Rose replied after taking a critical look at his face and reaching out to flatten a bit of his beard. Harry wasn’t about to question her process but the amount of glitter that appeared on her palm when she took it back wasn’t encouraging.
"I probably deserved it," he eventually admitted. "I didn't exactly put my best foot forward when we first met… wait, a week prior? We'd just met outside the Great Hall."
He and Teddy made a lot more sense now, someone to fill that void, the closest thing he could get to familial blood.
"And who's paying you to be here?" Draco asked as they set up camp, doubling the wards around key structures.
“You slept ok?” He asked, walking up to the bed. It was Harry’s turn to nod, the night had been uneventful and his newly whole chest hadn’t given him any problems.
“I have some inkling,” Harry replied with an amused smile. “Thanks for keeping them away,” he mentioned earnestly.
“Make me,” Harry taunted him. Defiance was written all over his body, the lifted chin, the glint in his eyes. It would be so easy to rise to the bait and push until he bent to his will, but there was a much sweeter prize to be gained.
Harry suddenly realised Draco was right there, looking as edible as ever, with his lips kiss-swollen and inviting. “How many bedrooms does this place have?”
“I don’t,” Malfoy replied, his voice carefully devoid of inflection. But Harry had just been in his mind, he knew what he’d seen, and his unwillingness to make eye contact gave him away.
“For those not adept at math that means you were in a high-risk situation once every two weeks on average.” He doubled down, letting all of his disapproval bleed into his voice. Harry would usually be squirming under the weight of that look but the effect was ruined by Bingley jumping in
It took negotiating, needling, cajoling and polite threats for the local government to cave and grant a direct connection between the two communities in the form of a post slot.
"I was hoping that a drastic drain of his reserves would induce a heart attack, and defibrillation would amount as close enough to death to dissolve the bond," Draco continued, glancing at Harry who was struggling to stay awake as they discussed details. Harry smiled sleepily at him, basking in the tentative warmth reigniting behind Draco’s eyes. How could eyes that looked so much like ice warm a man like that Harry didn’t know, but he wasn’t going to question it when Draco smiled back.
They didn't waste much time getting to know the local officials that welcomed them to Jawhar, they had quite the trip ahead of them and Harry was anxious to get going.
good habits, Potter,” Draco argued, letting Harry straddle his lap, his hands immediately gravitating to his arse, easily in reach now, his wand forgotten on the orange bedcover.
“Not really. I was originally planning on staying at the Burrow but Mr and Mrs Weasley are in Romania visiting Charlie. Andromeda only has a few weeks free before Teddy gets back from Hogwarts, and I didn’t want to impose,” Harry slowly went through the list of his friends and his reservations about staying with them. “I might just get a hotel room for a while.”
Time seemed to bend around the fire. The night never seemed to end, full of light and song, but he eventually lay down on a thin mat next to Malfoy, looking up at startlingly familiar stars, unable to sleep.
“That’s the attitude, Mr Potter,” she smiled back. “Two doses, one now and one in a half-hour, then four hours to activate and then Healer Malfoy will set the effects,” she reminded them, handing the first vial over to Harry who dutifully drank it down. Malfoy set a countdown on the other dose to alert them when it was time for it.
and she isn’t even mentioned by name. That’s tragic.” She snapped the prophet shut. “And now we’re under siege from reporters trying to get a piece of you, mr Potter. Do you have any idea how disruptive that is to our job?”
"I know I said I would do whatever you needed from me, Potter, but I seriously hoped it would involve food."
"I wasn't allowed to train as a Healer, that's why I left." Why he stayed away was another question entirely. "You're not what I expected either, Timothy Griffith," Draco mentioned to steer the conversation towards safer ground.
“But you take none of my bullshit, even less than Hermione does, in a good way. You argue with me, and you treat me like an actual adult, not a child to handle. It’s not like it was with my relatives, you discuss things with me and negotiate boundaries, but you’re so unyielding with the boundaries you set and...” Harry shrugged, not really finding the words to finish that thought “Fuck,” he sighed, glancing up at Draco’s face. “That’s kind of hot,” he admitted with an unapologetic smile. “But it’s not just that. It makes me feel safe, you know? Knowing where the limit lies, that I can’t always change the rules. And sometimes one needs something solid outside of himself to centre...”
“Yeah, turns out it was indeed a secret warehouse and there was a lab somewhere, but they triggered a trap halfway through the sweep,” Ron replied.
He noticed it as soon as he walked through the door. It was designed to be hard to miss. The obnoxiously bright lime green envelope sitting in the middle of his desk could only mean one thing:
"I was a better duelist, still am." Harry eventually managed, latching to the one thing that felt normal: arguing with Malfoy and trying to one up him.
"I can't believe in a week I'll have to get used to not having you by my side, Miss Rana," Draco mentioned with a half smile.
"Harry, it's a cursed marking covering his entire forearm, it's not like he can very easily hide it," she pointed out placidly. "And it doesn't hold the same meaning here as it does in the UK. Not everyone is affected by it like we are. As horrible as it may sound, Voldemort wasn't that big a deal outside of the UK."
teachable. He was infuriating, trying to dodge his responsibility, but in the end, Malfoy was giving Harry the chance to make him understand the damage he'd caused in a very personal manner and Harry wasn't going to pass on the opportunity to get his pain recognised by the one who caused it.
“Very well. As it stands, Healer Malfoy, you have knowingly employed a procedure expressly forbidden by the Order of Healers, performing a tap into the magical core of Auror Potter. That without obtaining informed consent from the patient or the next of kin. You also failed to ensure you had the proper supporting equipe during the procedure.” He listed off his sins.
Once she left he noticed the chessboard sitting on his bedside table and the small note on top of it. He recognized the tight loops of Malfoy’s handwriting and he read through the instructions. He hadn’t known there were magical chessboards spelled to play themselves… well he did actually, met one during first year and almost died, but not available to the public, so… harmless and unassuming. A game for people who didn’t have a partner to play against.
The last bit of angst happens here but is resolved quickly. We're fully directed towards the happy ending, full steam ahead.
“We’re going to discuss that last part later.” Draco cleared his voice, trying to not sound like he was fighting a very inconvenient boner. “At length and in-depth,” he added with a definite nod. “But about your job, there are other ways to be involved in law enforcement without being on active duty,” he pointed out.
Harry felt the shadow of King George and Queen Mary as he waited for every last delegate to pile into a ratty car that had no business holding that many people. Luckily the Muggles filling the streets had no interest in hanging around to count how many British tourists were climbing in. He bent his head and slid onto the magically enlarged space, sparing one last glance towards the gate. From this side, he could almost imagine it being built to celebrate the bustling economy and flourishing Indian culture instead of the visit of a faraway and disinterested sovereign.
He followed the line of Potter's flank with his eyes, taking in every detail, every scar, every dark hair on his arms and his chest. He was in no hurry, as if dawn would last forever and he could finally drink in Potter until he was satisfied, but when he followed the bridge of his straight nose up, he found Potter's eyes open and staring right back at him, without the protection of the round spectacles hiding them. There was no accusation, no fear, no disdain, nothing of what Draco was used to finding behind Potter's green eyes when they rested on him.
Harry’s eyes kept tracing the shape of phoenix feathers on Malfoy's arm, following the edge of the wing, up the strong shoulder and brushing along the strong column of his neck. He picked up a pebble and threw it his way, startling him.
Once his belly was finally full, and he'd had some water, Harry started to feel the exhaustion settling in. The twinge in his arm, the weight of his eyelids, and the start of a headache prompted him to leave Malfoy to Healer Gupta's company if he wanted and retreat to bed. The last thing he remembered before falling asleep was Malfoy's voice floating in through the thin wall asking Healer Gupta about expert tattooists.
"What is this?" Harry asked, trying to read it before Draco resized it and slipped it into his pocket.
"Because we picked another category to deem unworthy," Malfoy concluded for him. He didn't meet Harry's eyes, staring in the depth of the green curry in his plate instead.
"I'm going to take a wild guess and say they assumed I was the British high official they were waiting for." Malfoy sat down at the breakfast table next to the window without being invited. "On account of my general distinguished and elegant demeanour, my whiteness and my unmistakable Britishness."
It took him a moment to recognise Potter without his Auror uniform or the more inconspicuous trousers and kurta. But it was him, even with the grey sweatpants and white t-shirt, clinging to his shoulders in a way that should be illegal. Draco knew he should have found an escape route but it was too late. By the time he realised who his companion was Potter had spotted his reflection on the glass so Draco walked in and rolled out his mat a few feet away. They could be civil for an hour. Besides, given the pace Potter was keeping and the sweat already soaking through the cotton of his shirt he doubted he had much breath to spare in order to throw barbs in his direction.
Harry whined when he took his hand away, finally breaking eye contact to look at it forlornly for a long moment. It didn’t last long, Harry’s eyes were back boring a hole in his soul mere seconds later. They kept each other frozen for long minutes, breathing in unison and feeling universes expanding in the small space between them, as they grappled with the enormity of Harry kneeling at his feet after everything Draco put him through. Draco watched as the tension bled from his arms with every breath. Harry slowly slumped down, an arm wrapping around Draco’s calf as he rested his cheek on his thigh, finally closing his eyes, looking at peace.
“Auror Potter was unconscious and a next of kin wasn’t available to give consent in time. As head of the equipe working on him it was my call to make.” Draco replied without hesitation “As far as proper support goes, to my knowledge, there is no healer in Britain trained to perform such procedure since, as you pointed out, it’s not approved by the BOH.” Draco managed not to sound condescending by some miracle, but my Merlin he wanted to so badly.
“Maybe another time, chéri,” Draco purred, finally getting on the bed and crawling his way up Harry’s body to kiss him once more. He doubted he would ever get over the small satisfied sigh that Harry breathed every time their lips touched as if he could only breathe when Draco’s lips were on his. “After we have a proper talk about it.” Draco pulled back and smiled down at Harry’s slightly dazed expression before leaning in to lick a long line up Harry’s neck like he’d been craving to do ever since the first time he shaved his face.
Harry wasted the morning away playing chess and napping intermittently. He was unusually tired for a man who’d spent the last few days in a hospital bed. There was a physical exhaustion making his arm heavy as he moved the pieces on the board. He couldn’t quite explain it and it was making it hard for him to concentrate on strategy. Malfoy had warned him about needing time to recover but he hadn’t expected it to be so bad, he’d felt mostly ok the previous day.
“Hermione, what can I do for you?” It was still odd to call her by her first name, but she’d insisted. Granger felt far more natural on his tongue.
Potter shook his head, "I found most of them in a cemetery in Amritsar. They died fighting for England. As far as I know the last remaining relatives died in '46 during the unrest between Muslims and Sikhs. My great-grandfather had already moved to England for a while by then, lost a brother in World War I and then stayed, bringing his wife over."
"Have you no shame?" Harry accused him, the words burning in his throat. "Sāhab-ji." He spat the honorific like it was poison. "It always comes back to your ego, doesn't it?"
The situation outside the hospital was largely unchanged with several reporters harassing the staff for details about Potter’s conditions, but at least no one managed to sneak inside. All the prophet had was speculation, which didn’t make it any less annoying but considerably easier to ignore.
How many generations had passed without any of them getting education? How much tradition had been eroded, how much culture had been washed away with every monsoon? Here they were, cut off from their roots, no less out of place than Harry, trying to cling to the crumbs that were left behind and piece together the remnants of a lost identity.
"It's called the Shaheed Minar. It was erected at the start of the nineteenth century to celebrate some British company officer."
He was pinned under her dark eyes as she spoke clearly and eloquently, and he knew she was talking just for him.
Draco started slowly, warming up and focusing on his breath, but the sound of Potter's quick pace created a harmony with his heartbeat and try as he might, he couldn't ignore it. He could hear him pant right next to him, breaking the constant whir of the treadmill. Draco redoubled his efforts, pushing for more challenging positions to keep his focus on himself but Potter's presence filled the room and pushed insistently at the edges of Draco's awareness. By the time Draco laid down in savasana, he was more off-balance than when he had started.
Alice, Poti, Ciulia I honestly doubt you will ever reach this point but if you do know that I love you and knowing you made me confident enough to share my story and put so much of myself in it.
The one day off turned into two because the heavy rain prevented them from going back to the island. Draco woke up to the sound of it hitting the window, obscuring the view and wrapping him in a bubble away from the world. It took a long contemplative moment to realise he wasn't going to be able to go out and do yoga in the garden.
Soup inexplicably started splitting his time between Grimmauld Place and Draco’s apartment, much like Draco himself. Grimmauld wasn’t very close to the hospital, and it wasn’t connected to the public floo network, Harry had only connected it to the Burrow, Ron’s and Andromeda’s, but it did its very best to make Draco feel extremely welcome whenever he came over. Appealing to his more hedonistic side apparently was a winning strategy, and Harry couldn’t be more pleased with his house working with him to keep his partner close. Draco was over often enough that, when he wasn’t, Harry started missing waking up to him cuddled up to his side in bed, seeking out Harry’s warmth during the night.
"Thank you, Malfoy, you've done remarkable work these past months and I couldn't have brought this mission home without you."
This chapter is a bit of a rollercoaster and we finally get to the moment we've been dreading for a while: Draco's first hearing.
"What does it look like to the uninitiated?" Draco asked, wondering if he was about to pull an emperor's new clothes kind of stunt. Not like it would make the situation much worse than it already was.
“It converged close to your core, which could indicate a bond.” Draco told him, putting the lens down.
So, they were barely more than trainees, he already knew that, and it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It meant that they weren't already set in their ways, willing to bend and think outside the box.
I don't know when I'll be able to post the next chapter, I'm writing when I have time and I don't have a set schedule. Maybe the first week of november? Who knows!
"Emmanuel was talking about bringing professors in from England and I don’t like it. That's more of what screwed the magical culture in the first place. But I can't leave those people to fend for themselves."
"Because this is the story of countless people, not just mine, Malfoy." Potter tapped the paper in front of him. "I need you to understand how deep and pervasive England's disruption has been so that you know to take your shoes off when you come into my house."
"Everything alright, Griffith?" Draco asked casually as he went back to work on the girl. "Tell me if you can't hold the spell up anymore, we'll get someone to step in for you."
"I'm afraid there have been too many generations gone without guidance, and it's only one community. There's one for every major city, let alone those who retreated in the rural areas. How can I get to all of them? What if there is no one left who remembers the way to get to the Unplottable lands?" Hermione sighed. "And then we need gurus. They are already hard to come by for structured magical schools. Even there, they rely on Western-trained teachers, keeping traditional magical practices as an advanced elective. And I don't have money or fame to entice them with to rebuild small gurukuls around the country."
The confidence with which Malfoy stepped into his personal space, the firm and sure way his cold hands manipulated his face, the smooth slide of light fingers on his neck made him almost wish that pale hand closed around it, pressing until it was hard to breathe, upping the sense of danger already coursing through Harry’s veins with every touch of the blade. Harry found himself instinctively baring his neck for Malfoy more than once.
The walk back up to the surface felt much longer than the descent and when they got out to breathe the clean night air, Harry wondered exactly how long they had been trapped down there, with only the knowledge of the length they would go to protect the other to fill the empty space between them.
Blaise hummed “I’m very happy to hear you say that. We move to expedite the proceeding, given Healer Malfoy’s collaborative disposition towards the committee and the abundance of evidence.” He stated with a conciliatory smile, the elegance of his performance was mesmerizing, he was playing Andrews against himself.
Draco hummed softly, burying his nose in the crook of Harry’s neck. “What else?” he encouraged him. “What do you truly desire?”
Harry’s hand found its way to Draco’s hair, messing up his braid as he ran his fingers through it, tugging gently and scratching Draco's scalp while he made a wandering path of kisses and nibbles and licks down Harry's torso, mapping the planes and valleys of Harry's body, taking stock of every scar, every freckle, every detail.
Harry shrugged “I slept through the night” He replied “But I got the weirdest dreams, really vivid and really boring.” He mentioned.
"A picture will last longer, Potter," Malfoy told him, a corner of his mouth curled in the smallest teasing smile.
“No, the nice man was just leaving, I’ll walk him out,” he replied with a smile all on the wrong end of too sweet, too many teeth showing to be friendly.
Draco didn’t lose any time, he wrote him back immediately, thanking him for his kindness and telling him he could set up in a matter of minutes. As soon as the letter was out he pulled Dana into a conference room, touching the wide mirror on the wall with the tip of his wand, calling out Bonhomme’s name. They watched the surface ripple for a few seconds, waiting for the man on the other end to do the same.
“No, sorry, I’m on my way out, I have to drop these at the ministry.” Ron waved a notebook Harry knew to be full of interview notes, “but I’ll try to come back around lunch so we can chat.” He gave him a quick careful hug before heading out.
“It migrated?” she was unconvinced “I think we should look into that if the patch gives us another day.” she pointed out
I think this is about enough, I know it’s getting long so I’m playing the exit song for myself. One last mention needs to go to the entire discord squad for creating the perfect environment for me to be able to create.
Draco hummed softly, his hand finding its way into Harry’s hair again, holding him there, slowly combing through them. The ring on his finger glinted in the low light of the room, a solitary star in a sea of black, single witness to the inenarrable: Harry Potter kneeling and seeking comfort at the feet of a Death Eater.
"You're my best friend, Harry, and a great Auror, but he's an incredible Healer and this is so much bigger than any of us. As much as it pains me to say this, yes."
Teddy nodded “That’s right, you never skipped tea, so we brought tea to you, and some other things from Molly, and there’s books from Hermione because she said you might like them, and George snuck in some new products because he said you need to have fun, he said fun is the best medicine.” Harry chuckled, wrapping an arm around Teddy’s shoulders. The kid was always a breath of fresh air, Harry couldn’t love him more, he had the whole family charmed, falling all over each other to win the title of favourite. Harry knew the honour was safely his, not even Ginny could compete.
“I want more. I want to kneel at your feet and be nothing except for yours.” There was a raw edge in Harry’s voice, barely more than a whisper hanging in the air, swirling between them.
“Thank you very much, McReary.” Draco smiled. “I was never here,” he added with a wink, closing the door behind himself, his blood running cold as he walked away from the lab.
"It's no use if you burn yourself out in the first week, I need you for three months, Malfoy," she reminded him.
Draco ran a hand over Harry’s chest, resting on his tattoo, while the other gently cradled his jaw. Harry could get high on the feeling of his eyes on his lips, the gentlest press of a finger under his chin and Draco not kissing him yet.
"He's already so big," Astoria sighed as she joined Draco under the shade of the big magnolia, away from the gossiping parents and the temptation of crystal bowls filled with lemon drops. She wordlessly handed Draco a flute of Francis Farole colour-changing lemonade and Draco had to appreciate the odd combination of elegant refinement and the taste of kindergarteners. The ancient pretentious champagne fountain filled with soda was the masterful touch that sold it all.
“How does the sling feel?” Malfoy asked, putting his hands in his pockets as they took a casual stroll through the busy halls up to the common room where a few more patients were playing cards or finishing breakfast.
"Mozart, the magic flute, my pick of arias." She replied, straightening up with a smile as the first lilting notes of papageno's aria filled the air.
Draco glanced up at him with a half-smile, “Let’s just say I learned to handle delicates,” he replied with an eyebrow wag as he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s cock, relishing in the chill that ran up Harry’s back at the contact with his cold fingers, still not entirely warmed up.
I know it's been two weeks and some but the new chapter is long and it's published so I consider it a win.
The tea was entirely forgotten at that point, and they left without even touching it. Taranjit guided them behind the tea room and into an alley, with a simple touch of his hand he opened a passage into a cobbled street that hadn’t been there a moment ago and led the way inside.
She left him with that disconcerting thought once he finished breakfast, excusing herself with a “Speaking of functioning hospitals I have patients to look after.”
Two big alcoves occupied the sides. One in front of the other, they were decorated with delicate carvings all along the arc. Cartouches sculpted in the stone above them named the people resting under the stone slabs. Smaller nooks lined the walls, each with dates, names and elaborate etchings and gold decoration. Draco lingered at the door while Potter made his way slowly around the mausoleums, greeting each person for a moment, lingering over some a little longer. He stopped halfway, under the statue of a man leaning heavily on a cane, with a cloak folded over his arm. It was stunningly made, made of solid marble, but it looked like the gentlest breeze could make the cloth flutter. Potter stared into his eyes for a long time, the tension growing in his shoulders as he stood under the gaze of his patriarch, his family name towering over them both.
You know the drill by now, leave some love in the comments. Are you excited about having the end in sight? Are you about ready to knock Draco and Harry's heads together to try and get them to kiss already?
"I'll have you know my disappearance could cause a diplomatic incident and Granger would not be happy about that," he complained, but he still followed Harry out.
“Kneel for me, Potter,” he repeated, soft and inviting, uncrossing his legs, making a space for him between his knees.
Only Taranjit's discreet cough stopped Harry from having Draco right then and there, bent over the banister overlooking the grand foyer. Draco was blushing down to his neck and there was no way of making his hair look like it hadn't been tugged by Harry's fingers, no matter how he tried to smooth it down and readjust his shirt.
He was just starting to commiserate himself when Soup appeared with a resounding crack, holding the chessboard with one hand and a packed lunch with the other.
Draco nodded towards the tiny round table right next to the window and went to take a seat in one of the plush chairs next to it. Much as himself, Potter hadn't bothered dressing for breakfast. He was wearing soft-looking grey joggers and a t-shirt that probably fit him before he underwent considerable physical training. Draco's mouth was watering, and not just for the delicious smells coming from under the cloche.
Harry shook his head. “I’ve been awake for a while,” he admitted. “What are you doing here?” he asked softly, he didn’t want to break the quiet atmosphere that filled the room.
By the time he emerged from the bathroom the smell of strong coffee was wafting out of the kitchen and Pansy was setting up his record player when he walked in the room.
They spent a lot of time together, and the more they did, the better they communicated. Harry found that it became easier to find words for what he felt and what he wanted, and save for his usual sharp wit, Draco always listened without judgment, encouraging that open line of communication, even when it came to the darker things. And it wasn’t just words. After spending so much time in and out of each other’s heads it became almost natural to do it when trying to find words was too difficult, or they were just too lazy to try. Much to their friends’ annoyance, barely two months into their (official) relationship, they could hold entire conversations in silence. Ron and Hermione had nothing on them.
"Two Dutch braids please." She crawled on the carpet and settled down in front of him, her back straight. She quickly pulled her bun down and handed him a comb so he could part her hair.
Draco led him back up the main stairway to the upper floor, to a room in the west wing. It was wide and warm, earth tones and oranges creating a welcoming environment. The bed in the middle was enormous, of solid wood with a carved headboard resembling lace. The whisper-light curtains, neatly tied to the twisted columns, fluttered in the breeze coming in through the window, offsetting the heaviness of the imposing piece of furniture.
Malfoy didn't need any encouragement to lean closer and wrap his lips around the treat, licking the tip of Harry's fingers on the way. Harry stared transfixed at the way his jaw moved as he chewed. For some reason, the bright yellow stain on his neck made him all that more attractive, quite like the orange on his forehead, bringing out the few freckles still visible under the colours. When the tip of his pink tongue brushed over his lips to catch a few stray crumbs, Harry followed it with his eyes and without any conscious decision to do so, reached out, cupping Malfoy's cheek with a hand, smearing neon pink on his skin, and pulled him in until they were kissing, slow and languid, the milky taste of gujiya on their tongues.
The next chapter is not going to happen until the second week of October at least. I have two exams to prepare for and a thesis to write (also two fests to write for, but you get to enjoy those eventually).
“So you play favourites, uh?” Harry asked when they were finally alone “Should have known that.” He commented, finishing his steamed vegetables.
She shook her head and left with a sigh. “You can’t take them back soon enough,” she said, closing the door behind herself.
“A house elf only speaks the truth.” Soup replied, the impassibility of his wrinkly face betrayed by the twitch of his big ears, letting on the concealed amusement.
I'm incredibly happy with the ending of this chapter and I cannot wait to hear about what you think about it. Things are starting to ramp up and comments make me happy to write more, so be nice and feed a writer.
Draco never did things halfway, Blaise had known it for a long time, and when he started getting attached to Potter again, he knew he was going to go in deep without coming up for air. Draco didn’t fall just a little bit in love, he gave everything until there was nothing left to give. Not many people could handle that kind of thing, there weren’t many people Draco allowed the privilege to try, especially after Astoria.
“No, he’s sleeping off the effects of the latest round of testing, and he hasn’t been sleeping well at night,” Malfoy replied, summoning a chair and sitting down next to the bed. He took out a pad and jotted down a few notes.
"Yeah, yeah, just checking in." He invited himself in and flopped down on a chair, watching Malfoy pack.
"You became a better man than I thought you could grow into back when I knew you," he admitted. Hermione had been right.
Harry sighed, picking at the patch on his chest. It started bad and it was getting worse. Malfoy’s optimistic outlook on his recovery was getting less and less realistic as the days went by, and Harry was already restless. His place wasn’t in a hospital bed lying about doing nothing. There was a potion smuggling ring out there that needed dismantling.
It took him a good few minutes to find his way back to the foyer and he was still fuming when he got to his bedroom. He barely got a wink of sleep, replaying every word Malfoy threw at him in his mind. He couldn't stand the thought of working with him around for months.
"You're not supposed to use your powers for evil against your fellow Slytherins," Draco put up a token resistance before turning to Granger. "Destination Mumbai. I assume Potter's going to be coming along too?"
Harry’s eyes snapped open and fixed unwaveringly on Draco’s face as he leaned down again to resume his ministration. Harry was perfect, the weight of him on Draco’s tongue pulled a deep moan out of him that was immediately echoed by Harry, his fingers tangling in Draco’s hair. His hand wasn’t pushing as Draco slowly, oh so slowly sank down, feeling Harry’s considerable length fill his mouth. Harry was never demanding, his fingers twisting in Draco’s hair more out of a need to ground himself than anything else.
“It’s personal, I think you should ask him if you really want to know.” Ron defended himself, bouncing Hugo a bit as he woke up from his post lunch nap.
Draco had to take a deep breath to avoid maiming the man on the spot. "Does it look like we have a potion lab around here to brew Miracle Growth of any kind?"
The arrival of their last week in Calcutta took Draco completely by surprise. He'd grown too comfortable with the luxury of the hotel and Potter's company. He couldn't believe it was already time to say goodbye to Healer Gupta and Miss Rana. They were going to the inauguration of the new gurukul. Granger would oversee the signing of the agreement on the lowering of isolating measures on the island community after a year of teaching, and then they would each be off on their way, the negotiation on the wider state schooling programme to continue, after Granger's return to England, between local activists and their own government.
were used, making Draco’s eyes roll so high he almost hurt himself. What cemented the whole article as garbage was the sprawling picture of the scene with field medics working on stabilizing the victims enough to send them to st Mungo and a nice closeup of Potter captioned
"I wanted to go there for Vaisakhi, but I'm starting to doubt we'll make it," Harry sighed, thumping his head against the rock.
"Daddy, look!" The excited scream pulled Draco's attention back to the sunny lawn where Scorpius was currently hovering five inches off the soft grass, holding onto the broomstick for dear life.
“You better not find an excuse to skip out on tonight.” Blaise told him “I have to go do my actual job, but if you don’t check in with Pansy by lunch time I’m coming after you.” Draco nodded.
"I don't even know where to find someone with the skills for that kind of enchanting," he sighed, and Harry knew there was no going back. It was a question of how, not if.
“You better. I swear to Merlin if I have to deal with protesters outside my hospital again, Weasley...” Draco shook his head.
Daphne and Blaise were already there, waiting for them right outside the club. Seeing the collar around Blaise’s neck and Daphne’s flowy goddess outfit made something settle deep inside his stomach.
Draco shook his head “No they don’t, and I’ve already done it once, currently in trouble for it.” He confirmed.
A grin bloomed on his face at the simple thought. Maybe Malfoy was right, maybe there was some pleasure to be taken from pain. He fought through the stiffness and reached over to prod at the new limb. It felt real. Well, it was real, even if it didn’t look the part quite yet, it wasn’t the right colour for him, it wasn’t the right colour for any human being to be entirely fair; it was a greying shade of light tan that didn’t look like it belonged on any living creature. Malfoy had promised it would go back to its original hue sooner or later, and the mark on his chest had faded considerably, so he wasn’t too worried about that.
Blaise insisted on getting him a new set of formal robes and Draco had to admit the feel of silk and soft wool against his skin felt like coming home. His fingers still remembered how to deftly close the tiny buttons on each sleeve and thread cufflinks through the holes of his shirt sleeve peeking out of his dark robe. Every time he shifted, the light caught on the discreet embroidery, bringing out the green tones from the almost-black fabric. He closed the clasps at the waist and adjusted the lapels, smoothing it down on his chest. He almost looked like his old self. He almost looked like his father, with his same aristocratic nose and thin lips, his hair growing long, well past his shoulders now, a man owning high society. But he was just a guest for a night.
Malfoy walking in looking like a man on a mission with two other people in tow was a welcome distraction from the dark turn his thoughts were taking.
"No, it's fine, I know how it sounds," Malfoy sighed as he got up and brushed the sand off his trousers. "We should get going or we'll be late at the embassy."
"Everyone will love you at your birthday party," Rose assured, dipping the brush in the bottle and splotching a dollop of polish on Harry's thumb, dripping down on the glass of the tabletop.
As usual many many thanks to Jay for being a wonderful beta and the best partner in crime I could ask for.
“Is that your cunning plan to delay my progress? Distracting me with sub-par chess games?” Malfoy asked raising an eyebrow. Harry saw him start to push the books aside, notwithstanding his protest.
“Back in school every third word out of your mouth was Malfoy.” Seamus argued “looks like some things never do change. It wasn’t much different for him. I wouldn’t be surprised if Zabini had nightmares about Malfoy going /Pottah!/ in the middle of the night.” He snorted.
Harry’s laugh turned into a moan at the slow tug Draco gave him before leaning down to kiss the head, his eyes fixed on Harry, greedily taking in every twitch of his lips, cataloguing even the most minuscule reaction. And Harry was so expressive, unashamed to make his pleasure known as Draco hollowed his cheeks and swirled his tongue around the head of his cock.
He heard Malfoy's gasp when they turned and there it was. The Shaheed Minar, white against the darkening sky, cutting the darkening sunset in two, bright thanks to the new lighting.
"Silk and Thesral hair" Draco's eyes widened in surprise "It took a long time to collect it and figure out how to work it, I had to weave it myself the muggle way, it was a pain, but look at the results!" Pansy ran a hand down the sleeve, glowing with pride.
The silence stretched around the room, as if the speaking of the number had sucked all energy from the world. Only the dust motes dared move, bobbing lazily in the rays of light coming in from the window.
"It's only Deeper Vision, Griffith, you better get used to this," he told him with a gentle note of teasing, the poor man was so out of his depth it was almost cute. "We don't have the fancy lenses you people use in England and I'm not going to waste energy to cast Phantom Image Projection for your entertainment, this isn't a classroom."
“I am, bud, the Healers have put me back together almost all the way.” He smiled at his godson who gave him back a bright grin. Teddy took that as permission to climb on the bed and settle in next to Harry, thankfully on his good side.
Draco walked out of the room without a second of hesitation, a strange feeling of detachment from his body as he took one precise step after the other, the robes billowing behind him, the only thing that felt real was the clinking of the chains on his vest.
“Well, gentlemen, I believe that settles everything.” The same woman spoke up before Andrews could come up with something else “Thank you for your collaboration, Healer Malfoy, Mr Zabini, we will see you in three days. Esteemed members of the committee this hearing has already taken up enough of my time.” She announced before standing up and leaving the room. Draco had to restrain himself from grinning. She effectively prevented them from continuing by collapsing the plenum. Without her they didn’t have the legal number to take any decision and that was it for the day. He had no idea who that woman was but he owed her.
“I hope so,” she replied affably. “I know you’ve been looking to transfer outside the country, Laennec hospital?” she mentioned, waiting for Draco to take a seat to do the same.
“You’re welcome, miss Brown” He called after her, a touch of a smile on his face, relaxing his scowl a little.
"My family is Punjabi. The main branch was Sikh for generations, until they emigrated to England and had to choose between being themselves and being respected as individuals. I don't know how many Potters grew up under the shadow of the golden temple of Amritsar, and then English prejudice pushed them to take off their turbans and cut their beards.” He trailed a finger along the rough surface of the table. “It doesn’t really matter, though, either way I would never have gotten the chance to participate in langar with my father."
"The boat is already coming to get us!" someone pointed at the sizable speed boat heading towards the lighthouse.
They left their clothes in a sad wet pile in the corner of the changing rooms and thanked Merlin for the warm robes. The oversized tub was steaming hot, and the room smelled of citrus, sandalwood and cardamom. The sweet scent of plumeria and flowers curled up from the water, dotted with blooms. Draco didn't waste any time before shedding his robe and lowering himself in the water, shivering as it warmed him through. He leaned back against the side and closed his eyes, breathing in the heady scents surrounding him.
All in all, he came out on the other end of the week much in the same state he came in. Healer Dana couldn’t start the treatment until they had a clear understanding of his body’s reaction to it and neither she nor Malfoy seemed any closer to a breakthrough. On a positive note, none of the potions they tested him for poisoned him, which could only be a good sign and he was determined to take it as such.
know?” he asked. The actual question Draco wanted to ask was why in the name of all that is good and sacred didn’t he tell him he was working in the lion’s den, but he bit his tongue and held back.
“Does it still hurt?” Malfoy asked, taking his hand and flipping it over, looking for any visible sign of injury, as if it hadn’t been the first thing Harry did upon waking up.
By the time the end of his shift rolled around Draco was well past drained. He’d reached drained five hours prior, when he operated on Potter. He dragged himself home in a daze, thanking hell and heaven that Mother insisted when Soup offered to come live with him. There was food ready for him on the table when he got in, courtesy of the house elf, but it didn’t prevent him from faceplanting in his bed right after eating and falling asleep still in his robes.
