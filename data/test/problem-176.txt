from harmless. Its victims so far had been a handful of injured sheep and a single escaped convict – the latter of which had lived to tell the tale, only missing three fingers and a toe after the incident.
Since Hogwarts - since he met Potter - he’d always exaggerated the truth, twisted reality to his satisfaction. He’d lied before then, of course, he was a Slytherin at heart, but it really started to get out of control when he was trying to bend Potter to his wishes. Back then, in their innocence, it had involved nothing more than humiliation and short-lasting pain, when Draco wanted to be better than him: faster, smarter, happier.
After all, they were as different as they were the same. The past was history; Draco was a new person and Potter had changed too. They learnt this as days passed and conversations ebbed and flowed.
The emotions from the conversation before died in a quick descent. Although, Harry was saying something, what it was Draco could not be certain.
“I’m certain you’ve spent it on worse.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But no, you have an Auror’s salary, you can afford a meal for two.”
And yet, there were a thousand and one memories all slotted into that one smile. Had Draco sought to be on the receiving end all this time?
“Kent?” Draco repeated, immediately striding over and towering over the map. Potter leaned forward from his relaxed position with a frown.
family like yours and all. ” Harry was saying, straight-faced. “Admittedly, it doesn’t usually precede sleep, but I’m sure you can handle it.”
Fletcher rifled through her file, skimming the pages before she found what she was looking for. “The agent said there was evidence of habitation in the surrounding forest, including warding charm residue  and… the remains of multiple large birds.”
They stood there, with their thoughts and emotions, and Draco wondered how long it would take him to love this house as much as Harry did. Not long at all, he concluded, as the house’s magic danced happy patterns along his skin.
Harry found him by the exit once Granger and Weasley had made their swift exit. He took Draco by the elbow, a subtle touch that rooted him to the earth.
“Besides, if you’re concerned for his health, you can rest assured that I take great care of him. And we sleep better than ever,” Draco answered with a smirk. “Right, Harry?”
place, he’d conjured some cushions and spread them across the stone. Against all odds, they hadn’t yet been stolen nor vandalised by any mischievous students – a miraculous feat, in fact. (Fred and George would be disappointed in their legacy)
Draco lifted his eyebrows smugly, his gaze directed at Weasley. Of course he had seen Harry coming - he could probably sense Harry's presence with his eyes closed by now. But Draco had just let Granger go tumbling into her self-dug hole and hoped she’d plunge a little deeper.
At the very beginning, fearful of finality, Draco held on with his pinky finger. The very concept of commitment was lost to him, foreign. He fled like a deer meeting its first car, curious enough to linger but far too terrified to move at first, much alike a boy falling for his first love - out of control, helplessly spinning and anticipating the bone-crushing end. Because there was always an end. To life, to love.
Potter didn’t say anything the following night either, or the night after or the night after that. He didn’t seem to bother trying to communicate with Draco anymore. He acknowledged Draco’s existence in class and caught his eye every once in a while, but nothing more. Words were becoming an unfamiliar terrain between the pair. Draco wouldn’t even mind if it was his surname that was said, anything to resolve this uncomfortable limbo. He didn’t say anything either. Although, one night, he fetched Potter’s blanket on his way to the couch and left it at the other side of the sofa.
entailed visits to Teddy and dinner at Granger’s and Weasley’s flat, and avoiding the Prophet’s latest X-ray cameras. It involved taking Draco on day trips to France, to Japan, to any country that proclaimed him to be the miraculous saviour he was and therefore gifted free entry whenever he pleased. Living meant spending hours with Draco, around him, pressed against him, savouring the taste of him with fluttering eyelids. As though it was the first time, perhaps it was the last.
“I don’t quite believe that yet,” Draco whispered back, his touch slipping beneath Harry’s jumper in sought of hot skin. He smiled against Harry’s lips, “I’m going to lock you into a miserable marriage before they do.”
Draco didn’t say anything as they took the next exit off the road and slowed to a crawl, slotting into a space beside a tall column of coloured advertisements and warnings. The door creaked open and Potter dropped to the floor. With his hand still on the door, he looked over his shoulder and asked another question.
“We can regroup tomorrow and run through the interview,” Fletcher suggested, probably sick of the quick-fire back and forth.
Perhaps, their minds were under-developed. There was always the possibility they’d been raised in the wild, or perhaps they had learning difficulties. But why had they gathered together? The elder members - which Draco now classified as those with seemingly matured minds – showed signs of having lived in the urban world. When he raised his points to Potter and Fletcher, they only came up with the same possible conclusions.
Another fifteen minutes passed before Harry’s warmth vanished. Draco opened his eyes quickly, finding Harry sat up at the other end of the bed, aggressively rubbing his eyes and yawning.
The sun was peeking over the horizon by the time Potter moved again. it was only a couple of hours before breakfast when he rose from Draco’s shoulder, pulled his glasses from his pocket, slipped them onto his nose and stood up. Potter stretched his arms to the ceiling, his t-shirt rising to reveal a sliver of skin before it fell into hiding again.
Fletcher shook her head. “Since this is an opt-out situation, I actually have a couple more leads to follow up.”
They walked, side by side, arms swinging, Potter rambling about the selection of aged wines they had in store, how Draco would probably enjoy them. His cheeks were slightly flushed, his gestures growing wilder by the moment, and Draco listened quietly.
Draco laid there silently, his arm pinned beneath Harry’s neck, his body delightfully warm. The breaths skimming his shoulder were steady and Draco let his thoughts slow. Did he deserve such a glimpse of peace?
“Malfoy, can you set up some concealment charms to hide the minibus? Stick a few wards around us too. We don’t want any muggles crashing into us while we sleep.” Potter asked as he focused on the extension charm.
There was no trace of them. There was still an imprint in the grass, and the patches of bare soil where Fletcher had ripped all life out with her fingers, plus the small puddle of tea Potter had spilt earlier.
The air was amicable, much alike a departmental trip to the pub – not that Draco ever attended those events, so it wasn’t a fair comparison – but they cleared away the mess once they’d eaten and settled in their own individual areas with far more contentment then he’d expected. Fletcher and he wrote up their notes in comfortable silence besides one another, leaning across their desks to examine the runic symbols and correctly copy them down. Potter was on the couch, his boots abandoned and his socked feet kicked over the arm, reading through a file at a slow pace. Although, he frequently took breaks to stare blankly into the flame of the nearest lamp.
Draco’s hands were roaming up and down the highs and lows of Harry’s body. His fingers were dancing across the thick fabric of Harry’s sweater, skimming the belt hooks of his faded jeans, yearning to reach even the tips of his toes (only held back by Harry himself blocking the way). Kisses were being pressed into the mess of curls on top of Harry’s head, sweet nothings murmured into his ears. Each time Draco’s hands strayed, be it to Harry’s jaw or his lips after stealing a gentle kiss, they returned loyally to the snug sweater.
A glance backwards showed Fletcher staring out the window with wide eyes. Draco considered that he had never asked where Fletcher grew up and judging by her reaction, it hadn’t been in the countryside like Draco’s upbringing. Although, it hadn’t quite been the true countryside, rather a large estate to roam.
“Yes…we should,” Draco replied absent-mindedly, tracing the symbols with the tip of his index finger.
“Right then, just you and me.” Potter looked at Draco, his chin lifting a fraction to peer up at him. “Unless you have plans too?”
The next update will be out as soon as I can manage it - work and the perpetual cold is really draining all my energy at the moment :/
“Do you spend much time in the muggle world, Malfoy?” Potter asked, rolling the minibus forward and veering it gradually back towards the road.
Another week passed. Potter even slept here on the weekends. And those muggle pyjamas seemed to be a favourite of his, too often matched with a hideous pair of woolly socks. They certainly made it easier for Potter to sneak up on Draco before he slung himself over the back of the sofa. Not to mention, Potter was appearing earlier and earlier too.
Potter moved through the door, forever leading the way. Draco made to follow, running through all the questions he wanted to ask, connecting them to each of his individual theories.
And the time passed in a strange haze of note taking and reading. Fletcher pulled several books out of her backpack at one point, slapping them down on the desk and beginning to trawl the pages.
It was dark. Perhaps that was the reason Fletcher had decided it was an appropriate time for a momentary break. So, they dug into their dinner, chewing slowly through overcooked rice and semi-raw vegetables as the group below dug into what seemed to be a squirrel. Draco amended his observation as a few more small mammals were pulled into sight. It appeared they were digging into a squirrel, several pigeons, and the half-scavenged leg of a deer (presumably).
Draco was more focused on obtaining every strip of information he could now. The earlier this investigation was concluded, the better.
None of the texts seemed to provide anything relevant to the case. The group was still an unknown. Its actions were harmless, besides the one accused crime, and half of its members didn’t seem developed enough to hatch an evil plan. Although, the anonymous tips the Ministry had received suggested otherwise.
, he had Draco’s legs intertwined with his own, their feet stretched out to the other side of the alcove, his back pressed to Draco’s chest, soft cushioning beneath their bodies.
It was half-past one when Potter decided to show himself and pad across the common room with sleepy eyes and drowsy limbs. He clambered onto the centre of the couch, slinging a blanket around his shoulders.
“You’ve hardly seen anything yet.” A teasing smile graced Draco’s lips as he gestured at the nearby door.
“Ok, I’ve got it,” Potter said, lifting his head from the map and grabbing Draco’s forearm. “Ready?”
When he woke, Potter was rummaging through the kitchen cupboards, looking tired, but his bed sheets were rumpled. Draco smiled.
Potter was looking at him curiously and Draco almost didn’t want to move under that gaze. It seemed to be doused in intrigue and surprise, as though Potter had always known who Draco was and this had changed his perspective. Guiltily, Draco thought he didn’t mind that – proving him wrong.
Harry, taking the hint, pushed the door open, unveiling a large living room. All of the furniture was covered in dusty white sheets, but upon his arrival, the house dramatically swept them into the air and into a neat tidy of fabric in the corner. The fireplace found a spark of life, jumping to life, and Harry’s heart stuttered.
It was bare, aside from a couple of reports Fletcher had put together in the past five days. Draco hadn’t seen him read a single letter of them – inconsiderate prick.
“No, our police agent specifically noted that there were multiple magical signatures.” Potter said, dragging his hands down his face. “They couldn’t be sure, but there were at least ten or fifteen. This could be a mere branch of the larger organisation too.”
Draco couldn’t see the muggle obsession with this plastic material, but he begrudgingly dug into a sandwich for lunch following Fletcher’s insistent prompting. They were driving again before he knew it, Potter nibbling on what he called a sausage roll as he drove precariously with a single hand on the wheel.
The silence hung between them for a moment too long. Potter’s dangerous gaze didn’t faze Draco in the slightest as he contemplated the wisest response.
A subtle shrug against Draco’s body, the shifting of limbs until Draco was tucked against his side and Harry could look up at him with a crinkle in his eyes and a wide smile.
casual conversation since they first met – well, it ended. Draco rose back onto his feet and turned to go back to bed. Something prompted him to linger. He looked at the man tucked in the grass.
Shacklebolt looked depleted at best. He seemed more worn-out each day that passed, his half-hearted smile diminishing from each departmental meeting to the next. Draco couldn’t bring himself to care too much though, it was the Head Auror’s fault for the huge workload he deposited upon himself. It seemed to only ever be Potter who too noticed the man’s exhaustion.
A nearby rustle snagged his attention. Draco paused, looking west as the other two continued onward. He frowned, categorising it as wildlife, and turned to catch up.
work after all, except he was offered the opportunity to escape the too small departmental office and move. Besides, if Potter and Fletcher had already left, they had the Shacklebolt stamp of approval. Who was Draco to deny such a blessing?
“I really like you, Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled, finding his fidgeting hands and interlocking their fingers. “If you gave us a real chance, I think you might really like me too.”
Draco watched. He noticed the small wrinkles that appeared in Potter’s forehead as he drove the toy around tight corners. He saw the simple connection he had made with Griffin. A smile was tempted onto Draco’s lips.
“You saved my life too.” Potter was still talking. His eyes were on Draco. “I never thanked you for that. Thank you, Draco.”
“Wise decision,” Said Harry, fighting a yawn with no success. He looked at Draco for a stolen moment then his eyes closed. “Professor Dumbledore would be proud.”
Draco glanced up from his book and shrugged, “Is that so? I didn’t hear a pause in your endless muttering.”
“My mother pays you so that I can talk about the past,” Draco said, his cheeks flushing a subtle shade of pink. “We are going off-topic.”
“You recorded the entire thing, right?” Fletcher held out her hand, palm facing up, to Potter and waggled her fingers.
Draco stood on the roadside, clutching his bag in one hand and the portkey in the other. He watched as Potter sloppily pulled out into the road, lugging the big car out of the big dip he’d parked in. Dust was sprayed up at Draco as they left, the mechanical contraption was all he could see of his co-workers as they grew into a tiny dot in the distance.
When Draco rose the following morning – surprised he was still alive and unhurt – he cast a long look across to Fletcher’s sleeping figure and over to Potter’s bed. It was empty. In fact, it looked like nobody had slept in it at all and Draco didn’t have enough faith in Potter’s skills to believe he perfectly made the bed after a long night of restful sleep.
Draco shucked off his seatbelt and slipped out of his door. He walked slowly around the corner, his hand wrapped around his wand – you could never be too sure with Potter – and came face to face with the man.
A cup of tea and an apple later, they were back to venturing through the forest. Fletcher’s theory hadn’t held true yet, but they followed the narrow river that weaved through the land regardless.
“No, not at all. Fletcher and I will just slave away over here. You continue wasting away all you like.” Draco said, a bite to his words – so much so that Fletcher lifted her head from the desk and shot a warning look at him.
. He nearly looked alive, rather than looking like an exhausted 23-year-old with nothing better to do on the weekend than stalk a creepy cult through the forest.
Draco disappeared to grab a glass of water, as Potter spread his forearms across the toilet seat and laid against it.
There was no answer and no Potter. Draco slipped his shoes on, clutched his wand and paced around the van’s exterior to check for the man. No sign. Draco frowned.
Draco couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face for a moment before he hid it in the wine glass. Even worse, Potter caught it. He smirked.
The clasp on the front door lifted itself free and the tired wood swung itself open with a heavy creak as he neared.
But the magic they’d picked up at the crime scene had been far too old, it had woven with the natural magic of the forest and become indistinct. Draco couldn’t line it up enough with the wisps of magic that drifted their way – it was strong but not dark, and there was something underlining its strength but Draco couldn’t quite place it.
“This-“ Draco made a vague gesture between their bodies, “-isn’t normal! Everybody else in the whole damned world seems to realise that.”
At precisely 3:45 pm the following afternoon, the three of them arrived at the steps of Semele Residential Care and stared up at the shiny building. They were early, as Draco had insisted, and clutching the coffee Fletcher had brought in a half-hearted effort to liven them up. The coffee had enough time to kick in since the interview wasn’t scheduled to begin for another fifteen minutes.
Routine was a simple thing after two nights. Draco and Fletcher wrote, Potter read his file. There was a natural division through the room; the gradual redeemers and the national treasure. No matter how many reforms the Ministry made, it would always exist.
Potter looked like he had a twig up his arse the entire evening regardless. He occupied the same position as the night prior and stared into the mid-distance, barely blinking behind those ridiculous glasses.
Draco didn’t understand what that meant, where they were going to ‘pop into’, but he maintained his grip on the handle on the door and waited. The minibus was steered off the loud, busy motorway (another word Draco had picked up from the signs), and it veered around a sharp turn until it pulled to a stop under a large shelter. There was a strange contraption besides the unusual parking spot Potter had chosen.
“Well, as long as neither of you are one such individual, then we should have no trouble finding them once the group has been dismantled.” Potter answered nonchalantly, throwing the subtle implication of trust down as a gauntlet.
“Stop calling me that!” Potter demanded, thrashing his arms in the air, his beer can narrowly missing Draco’s head. “Call me Harry, everybody else calls me Harry. Everyone knows my stupid name…”
“Fine, the van is also doubling as our lodgings for the duration of the trip.” Potter said simply, his fingers drumming against the steering circle. “A quick extension charm and we’re set for the two nights.”
“That’s true. God, Hermione is too perceptive for her own good sometimes.”  Harry added on afterwards, “You know, she guessed what Ron was going to get her for Christmas three months before he’d even thought about it.”
The familiar crack of apparition snapped Draco back to attention. He stared out into the night and the forest, but there wasn’t a soul. He raised his wand warily.
Harry tilted his head to the side, looking at Draco, all shadows and harsh angles. “Goodnight, Draco. Sleep well.”
There was no shaking Harry though, he clung on insistently and pulled Draco into an alcove. He raised his eyebrows and pushed a low brick. They were swung into a dark passageway and Draco finally wrenched his hand out of Harry’s death grip.
Harry picked up his broom that must’ve been thrust to the grass at some point and grasped Draco’s hand with the other, lacing their fingers together.
Draco was gone before he could conjure the effort to bite back. He stumbled further into the forest until he was a respectable distance away, before taking care of his business.
“I don’t think it’s worth coming back to observe the group next week,” Potter said into the air, tipping his head up slightly to catch Draco’s eyes and then down to Fletcher. “Are all the necessary spells in place, Juniper? And you’ve taken the photos of all the suspects?”
“Are you going to sit there all night, Potter?” Draco asked, admittedly more snarkily than intended, after he hadn’t moved for an hour.
“Judging by their hygiene states, they’ve been living here for several months, I’d say. So, it’s possible.” Draco answered lowly. “I assume muggles don’t usually trample around the woods in thin clothes muttering under their breath?”
It was a relief and a respite, to have a companion. A companion that didn't stare, didn't prod at their sensitive history, didn't flinch at the slightest of movements.
Draco hummed to himself, still processing all the small hints this might give them. He spotted a familiar head of black hair down below and pointed. “That man, with the medium-length, black hair and dark skin.”
He didn’t seem to consider that they could travel back separately, now that there weren’t any reasons to stick together, no convenient cloaks or mysterious suspects. Then again, Potter didn’t think things through; he lived in a world of impulsive decisions. Draco was willing to let him as he grabbed Potter’s arm and stepped into his world for a moment, the world that was thrilling and unexpected and submerged them in darkness.
It was more of a statement than a question, derived from the emotions in Harry’s eyes. They spoke of the pain that would be felt, the injustice he would experience. Harry always seemed to wear his feelings on his face; unashamedly honest. Younger Draco hated that, the courage it took to be brazenly vulnerable. Older Draco had learned to love it, learned to interpret every micro-expression that Harry would sport, loved that he could see the love Harry felt.
He said nothing in return. He caught Potter’s eyes four hours later in class, looking worse for wear with two hours’ sleep under his belt, and his lips must’ve curved into some poor attempt at a smile because Potter was smiling back at him. Then, Granger nudged him and he was gone. Draco was left to stare at his back for the rest of the lesson.
The sickly smell of disinfectant drifted in Draco’s direction, drudging up old memories of his father’s last days in hospital. But Draco reminded himself that he was here as an investigator, a consultant not being paid enough for day trips to witness questionings. Any complex emotions that arose from a simple scent were set to the side for a later emotional crisis.
Draco the bully from school had become Draco the agitator, Draco the gaslighter. His temper was far better managed than his younger years, but Harry’s temperament was excellent in comparison. He’d become far more level-headed since the war’s end, his temper gone, perhaps hidden beneath the trauma and grief. Either way, he rarely yelled, now the victim of Draco’s one-sided provocations. It was the way of things, soon to change but not yet.
But this is what their adequate salaries were designated for: reading, researching, advising and never, ever, getting their hands dirty again.
“We need to track them first,” Draco remarked, chewing the edge of his quill. “Ideally, a trip to the crime scene would be more productive than anything we can achieve in this office.”
Did Potter not attend the trials? Did he ignore every copy of the fucking Daily Prophet that unveiled the darkest truths of the wrong side? The Death Eaters, the innocent civilians, the people who made awful mistakes – they didn’t get to decide what was kept in the shadows. They still didn’t.
One night, Draco tiptoed across his room at 12:08 am. His fingers wrapped around the cold doorknob and tugged, wincing as the hinges betrayed him, creaking. Harry was on the other side. He stopped Draco with a hand simply pressed flat against the door. And with bleary eyes, he stepped into the room, hooked Draco’s wrist into his grip and led Draco back to his bed.
“I’m already obligated to her, I reckon I can handle a promise,” Potter replied, taking a long sip of his beer, his eyes gazing over the top.
Strong arms – toned from a long summer of working out – tugged him closer, the adjoined hands glided around his chest to rest at Harry’s waist. And a kiss to his temple, before Draco’s head rolled back against the wall.
“You can’t change my mind, Hermione. I will continue to choose to be with Draco,” Harry said firmly. “I’m an adult capable of making responsible decisions in his own love-life, remember?”
Draco said nothing. He didn’t move his gaze from the spot on the ground that oozed dark magic. It was stained with the imprint of death. He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t know how Potter could stand it.
And Draco would wonder what else Potter had to do in a day, besides taunt him and sloppily stack books in incorrect alphabetical order.
“I certainly would not,” Draco replied briskly. He made no move to leave and stayed in place. Potter watched him for a moment. Then he rolled his cheek back against Draco’s thigh and smiled.
Draco’s fingers stilled around his drink, his focus quickly shifting to the bob of Potter’s Adam apple as he swallowed. He noticed the muscles that moved in tandem, Potter’s neck a sickeningly appealing shade of tanned skin.
Draco huffed and returned to the tree trunk he’d been examining. There were runes carved into the bottom, looped in circles around the tree, and they looked familiar. He couldn’t quite place them, they drifted meaninglessly around his mind, seeking their rightful home.
Fletcher nodded silently, her gaze dropping to her lap under the watchful eye of their boss. Draco held his ground, maintaining eye contact. “Understood, sir.”
He set to work on their dinner, using whatever he could find in the bare cupboards, and ignored Fletcher’s attempts at conversation. She stood at his shoulder regardless, watching him slice and stir and peel. The food was served forty-five minutes later, once they’d set the table and settled down.
“You’re really fucking smitten, aren’t you? Oh Merlin—” She jumped excitedly in her seat. “Please tell me that’s why you tormented Harry for so many years? Because you
He bent down, wrapping an arm around Potter’s waist and lifted him to a stand. Almost immediately, Potter slumped into him, his head rolling against Draco’s shoulder, as he was lugged across the threshold and through the pristine living room. Draco hoped, for the sake of his deteriorating mop, that there was no vomiting in transit. He’d learnt the hard way that simply vanishing the substance did nothing to remove the pieces that had slipped through the cracks.
They touched down at the centre of the pitch. Draco’s legs wobbled, acclimatising to the feel of land once more. He looked at Harry and the way he was clunking his boots together, eyebrows drawn together in a frown.
“I heard my name!” Fletcher said groggily, sitting up with a severe case of bedhead, and scanned the room slowly. “Morning…”
It was only when Fletcher had wandered ahead, mentioning something about a faulty charm, that Draco realised he was alone with Potter. Just two men sat side by side under a large oak tree, toying with the idea of being colleagues.
Then, he held on a little tighter, tying together the lust and the like. These came hand in hand with Potter. The sexiness of his saunter and the sparkle of his hungover grin. Another pair to match the world’s natural formation of pairs: lovers, hands, twins, disasters.
Enough information had been gathered to suggest the group practiced dark magic, following what muggles called black magic rituals, and rumours suggested it was
Greeting them politely, the receptionists took their information and signatures, then delved into a long debriefing. They rattled through their list of pre-determined discussion points, shifting from the topic of appropriate behaviour to sensitive questions to confidentiality. Notably, they had a strict policy against extracting memories for criminal investigations. Draco paid keen attention, hopeful to avoid any unintentional trouble, but Potter’s mind seemed distant as though he’d heard it all before.
as bad as I was five years ago…” Draco stopped, eyes wide, and wanted to cram the words back into his mouth. He’d said them too openly. Draco didn’t talk to people like that, he couldn’t. “That’s not—I—Regardless, nobody in their right mind would hire me.”
Potter sighed and fully turned so that he faced Draco, his knees tucked beneath his chin and his eyes bright despite the darkness. Forever bright. He took a moment to think and nothing filled the space between them. Draco looked into those eyes and didn’t think twice before imitating Potter’s position.
“Look, Draco, we wanted to talk about your… relationship with Harry,” Granger told him, wringing her hands in her lap, looking far too uncomfortable for this conversation. “To be entirely honest, we didn’t expect that it would last any longer than a week. Do you really think this will work out?”
Nowadays, the criminals were beginning to outsmart his quick-thinking. That was where Fletcher came in handy. She was as sharp as Draco, equally critical, and perhaps more analytical too. She was the fourth consultant that Draco had seen float in and out of her position since he began, but she was the current record holder – none of her predecessors had lasted half as long.
Potter appeared to know exactly where he was heading, as they headed down much narrower roads than before, flocked by tall trees. They passed numerous towns and villages, as well as camping sites galore. The minibus soared over bridges, crossing the channels where weak streams and eroding rivers ran, and passed fields of cows and horses and sheep. Their calls to one other broke through the windows, bleats and neighs from all directions.
“What did Granger say?” Draco asked, ignoring his question and the offering of warm hands. Draco pulled his blanket tighter around himself. “She saw us last night.”
He woke at dawn, the light streaming in from the tall windows, pushing past Draco’s eyelids to rouse him. Draco shuffled, trying to evade the inevitable call of consciousness. He gave up after another minute and peeled his eyes open. Everything was glowing a soft shade of yellow. Draco blinked. He looked across the couch and immediately caught Potter’s eyes.
“I want you too, Draco,” Harry said, breathing far heavier than before, his pupils dilated. He looked fucking gorgeous, and, well, fuckable. “If it wasn’t bloody obvious already.”
“I second that!” Fletcher called from behind, and Draco turned to see her emerge from the latest edition of the Quibbler. “Will we be compensated for our overtime, Harry?”
As the months started to roll by, Draco did fall, hard, into the rough pits of love. Here it was, that the unwanted prophecy came to be.
Fletcher’s cackle was the first sign of concession. It came from the exact spot they’d been sitting, and Draco exhaled.
Potter split off in the same direction he’d come, crouching as he passed each tree and climbing over their extravagant roots. Meanwhile, Fletcher and Draco focussed their attention in a similar location after discussing the most likely formation of the warding.
“He’s a pureblood! And really rather great! Even my father approves...” She blushed and the pink in her cheeks stuck. “I like him, Draco.”
A snitch that Harry had been keeping safe inside his jacket snuck into the air ahead of them, and they revelled in the competition. Draco flew until the broom bore blisters into his fingers and his cheeks ached from laughing. He was only 1 down. Harry, being the Quidditch Prodigy that he was claimed to be, was winning 3-2 as evident from the smug smirk on his face. His own little fan club was cheering from the stands now, yelling his name, sending equally passionate glares at Draco.
He pushed the portkey back to Potter’s chest and shook his head. “I’ll… I will accompany you in the minibus.”
She tugged him over to a stump of tree, only a foot of the pre-existing tree jutted out of the ground. It was covered in a dark green moss, but Fletcher wiped it away with her sleeve. Similar runes emerged in the bark, wrapping around the circumference of the tree.
“Well, this is remarkable character development!” Fletcher clapped her hands together and sauntered towards the van to drag the side door open. “Hop in, Draco the muggle.”
and into the oncoming torrent of cars. He tugged on what he supposed opened the door and clambered into the car in time for a passing vehicle to screech its machine and send an excessively loud horn sound at him.
“Can you, er, show me how those alerts work, Juniper? I haven’t had much experience constructing charms of this type.”
“Give me one reason why I should do that.” Draco was climbing to his feet, swivelling to face Potter, his arms crossed. “The last time I checked you don’t have the authority to order me around.”
Draco said nothing, suddenly thinking of his vaults filled with gold in Gringotts (the safest place on Earth according to all but the Golden Trio). Even after the Ministry’s heavy war reparation fees and taxes that ripped most of his family’s wealth to shreds, Draco had enough but so little that he could withdraw it all in two trips. He could quite literally spend his entire lifetime wealth on a birthday gift for—
“Why?” When no response came, he found Potter’s gaze jumping between the grey concrete ahead and Draco. Shadows slipped over Potter’s face, arching his brow then his lips, painting his features in darkness. “Well?”
“Right then. The plan is to observe them for a couple of days and set up a few surveillance and tracking spells. That way, we can continue to monitor them from the office.” Potter said, tipping his head towards Fletcher. “Juniper has been researching the most efficient spells for this number of wizards.”
Draco stared in disbelief. They were wizards, they could apparate in a matter of seconds to their destination that was several
Was Harry Potter volunteering to drag a clueless Draco Malfoy around muggle London? That would be a sight to see. Perhaps he could almost envision it: taking the grubby tube, chatting as those escalator contractions lifted them up to ground-level, strolling around the city’s landmarks, stopping for a coffee, Potter’s smile.
The suspects Disapparated. Potter pulled the map back out of his back pocket and located them back in Dartmoor Forest. Their strange activity had concluded, that was the only silver lining. Whatever they were completing, it was over for tonight, Draco hoped.
They trudged back to the roadside, managing to locate the minibus after wandering down the road for half a mile. Fletcher and Potter chatted lightly about their other work cases as they walked, but Draco dragged behind, kicking at the gravel below his feet.
Draco’s lips met Harry’s a little more forcefully than he intended – heat of the moment – but Harry’s mouth parted without hesitance. There was an instant heat that rose up Draco’s body, curling around his lungs and squeezing them tight, as Harry’s hands scrambled for purchase on Draco’s jacket, insistently tugging Draco closer, deeper.
“Well, Kingsley reckons he’s still popular enough to get voted in,” Potter said, fumbling with the napkin in front of him. “I think he could be the change the Ministry needs, don’t you?”
Potter strode at the other side, peering through the woods, while Draco and Fletcher walked together, elbowing each other into passing bushes each time the opportunity arose.
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him as they entered Potions. She elbowed him as Draco slid onto his usual seat and began purposefully avoiding her pointed glances.
Prompted by another shout from Fletcher inside the van, Draco turned away and headed for the front seat. Potter’s seat dipped beside him and Fletcher was buckled in behind them, some muggle magazine gripping her attention.
There was something about Potter’s sleep schedule that bothered him. To be fair, if their accompanying Auror was severely sleep-deprived, they did face a much higher likelihood of being violently murdered. Draco was only bothered about the brutal torture that might precede their unfortunate deaths.
They were swiftly led and dumped on the doorstep, the nurse waving a little too energetically to be genuine. A small series of steps further and they stood in the shadows of the neighbouring alleyway, hidden from the eyes of passers-by.
“I’m so—” Harry interrupted himself with a deep yawn, the hot air hitting Draco’s chest as he exhaled in a rush. “—tired. But I’m happy, here with you…”
They reached a clearing after a few minutes, Draco hot on Potter’s heels – so much so that he almost crashed into Potter, slamming on the brakes. Potter looked around until his gaze settled on a particular, uninteresting spot of the ground. It was no different than the rest of this miserable forest. Although, it was particularly chilly here.
In a complicated, disorganised mess of paperwork, the property had been passed to James Potter following the death of his parents in 1979, then to Sirius Black, then somehow to Remus Lupin. And in and amongst the aftermath of the first wizarding war, then the complications of Sirius’s incarceration, and the spark of a second war that followed, the legal administration failed to inform a single person of their sudden ownership of the house.
Draco’s body remained stiff for a further eleven minutes, not daring to move and face the wrath of a sleepy Potter. Eventually, once the breathing had settled to a calm, steady pace, Draco relaxed a fraction. He stared at the pages of his book, begging the words to give him some sort of explanation to this strange phenomenon. They didn’t. They simply sat there patiently until Draco blinked a few times in quick succession and began reading again, wholly aware of the man settled against his side.
It was only midnight and for the second night, Draco was having trouble resisting the temptation of sleep. He had the steady warmth of Harry’s head against his leg, it lured him to sleep. Only the rustle of the fire was keeping him fully conscious.
“That’s rather difficult when the saviour of the Wizarding World is so bloody demanding!” Draco whispered back, although he was settling into the situation and made a point of propping up his book on the side cushion.
The words made Draco pause in the doorway, his arms hanging limply by his sides. He almost turned, ready to argue with every bitter bone in his body. But he stopped. He resisted the temptation to look back at Potter and pushed onwards. He left Potter alone in the common room, no different from usual.
Although, there was a difference. Draco was feeling something he hadn’t felt for a long time, something he couldn’t place.
However, there was only so many words one could read. After a couple of hours, Draco could feel his brain substance melting and dripping gradually out of his ear. His eyes weren’t much better either, he had to rub them repeatedly to regain focus.
The elders of the camp were spread around the area, lying on the ground with their eyes to the sky. Life looked uninteresting from Draco’s perspective, but there were smiles on their lips and a dazzled look in their eyes. Joy was an integral part of daily life to these people, it seemed - nothing malicious or cruel.
“I do and I am not inclined to follow Draco’s lead. He certainly found an unconventional way of expressing his feelings.” She continued and Draco could feel heat snaking around his neck and lighting up his cheeks. “I’m sorry, Harry, for every way that I wronged you. I hope we can make amends this year.”
“This is a work trip, not a holiday, Malfoy.” Potter answered firmly instead, and that was it. No hint of annoyance, only firmness.
Fortunately, the faint magical imprint that the group had left made tracking them down far easier than the prior week. Draco was able to detect a trail that followed the stream’s jagged route, upon the manipulation of a simple level three tracking spell, and they set off, tracing the river’s outline with their boots.
Potter stayed, and turned up to work the very next day, rings under his eyes and marginally late as he always was. He never failed in this routine. Draco looked across at him now, for a moment, to see the fatigue lining Potter’s features and wondered if every night was spent in that mildly dusty office with no company.
Instead, as Draco stood there, his legs quivering like an anxious child’s, Potter started walking again and strode past, his friends in tow.
“Let me guess, Draco slept right through it?” Fletcher cast him a dry look. “I knew you’d be a fucking heavy sleeper.”
The portrait entrance creaked open and a pair of low voices carried themselves through to the common room. The bodies accompanying them appeared a moment later. It was Granger and Parvati, talking in hushed tones and both clutching textbooks to their chests. They looked exhausted and didn’t notice Draco. That is, until Granger sent Parvati on without her, stopping to pick up a stray cushion from the floor.
As he changed – certainly not into any of that awful denim that Potter was sporting again today – he could hear the faint chatter of Fletcher and Potter in the other room. They must have worked together many times in the past year. The pair seemed to have an easy friendship and he hadn’t heard Fletcher act so casual around anyone besides Draco at work.
“I see the department still worships the sun that shines out of Potter’s arse,” Draco answered instead of igniting a normal conversation with a co-worker.
Draco had stubbornly resisted the suggestion. He'd already played his part in fate, he'd been type-cast as the villain, he
“I don’t think so,” Potter answered. “He didn’t recognise a single suspect. Maybe Mr Griffin’s memory isn’t long-term enough to recall faces.”
they wouldn’t see us coming.” Draco scorned, crossing his arms as he leant against the back of the sofa.
He’d ducked into the shop, still in sight behind the glass. Draco sighed and turned his attention to the contraption he was holding limply, giving it an experimental squeeze. The entire column jumped to life, a mechanical whirl making Draco jump a few inches into the air. It seemed to whizz through the long piping that connected the column to the nozzle. The fuel, he supposed.
“Fuck the bloody newspapers. All they do is lie and pry.” Harry squeezed Draco’s arm. “At least we give them
“I… Well, I…” Draco paused and inhaled. He would not waste his mother’s money, the little that she had left. “I had apologised to everybody but
As Draco changed into his flying gear (pretty darn fast, urgently tugging the tight fabrics until they melded to his body), he mulled over Harry’s suggestion.
“Auror Potter said you wanted a word, sir? How can we be of assistance?” Fletcher asked, her fingers twisted in the fabric of her robes.
“We drink tea and we discuss my feelings and my past and everything that I’ve never told somebody. Sometimes, she shows me pictures of her cats.” Draco continued, looking anywhere but Harry. He could picture them now, Lana and Lucy the cats were called. “She hopes that, someday, more wizards will understand the importance of this muggle ‘
Potter and Fletcher were already out the minibus and staring across the road with their hands on their hips by the time Draco had figured out the seatbelt’s unlocking mechanism. He yelped as it sprung free, gaining the attention of the other two.
“Do you not like your name?” Potter asked, his stance shifting into a something subtly more nervous.
The kind of conversation that didn’t revolve around insults or work, the war or their regrets. It was ordinary. He asked about Draco’s weekend plans, his interests, his friends, and for what it was worth, Draco replied without objection. Words didn’t get stuck in his throat and the world didn’t seem so dark when he talked, when he had a foot in Potter’s universe.
Prior to Harry’s moment of ingenuity, they’d never had much trouble spending hours upon hours there, but now, Harry didn’t have to mutter little white lies of comfort while the cold stone wore down his skin.
“Arsehole.” Fletcher slapped him on the arm as she left the kitchen with a small skip in her step. Draco watched her plod across the room and throw her body into one of the desk chairs, wrapping her knees up to her chin as she flipped open yet another of her books.
They found Potter sprawled in there, petting a small tawny owl as it nuzzled into his shoulder. The remarkably domesticated owl pattered its claws in quick succession upon seeing the pair and offered a soft hoot in greeting.
Draco felt a yawn grow within himself and fought every instinct in order to keep it concealed. It won.
“Oh no. I’m sitting in the front. I don’t trust you to operate this ghastly machine without supervision.”
Potter was laughing by the end of the story, clutching his stomach, as Fletcher flushed a dark shade of red, that snaked up her neck to her cheeks. The laughter, Potter’s laughter, was strange to hear – so close to Draco, within the same conversation as him. It was rough and throaty and flowed out of Potter with a natural ease.
“Do either of you recognise them?” Potter asked, his grubby fingers reaching out to borrow the strips from Fletcher and stared down at them. He didn’t take Ancient Runes though; he wouldn’t have a clue.
And so, Draco was left with no other choice, not even a blatant excuse coming to mind, and they walked down to the end of the corridor as a three, a natural silence befalling them. Fletcher opened the door as Potter petted the owl a final time and released it down the corridor, trusting it to find its way back to wherever it came from. It soared over disgruntled heads, solemn Monday morning grimaces, its wings flapping.
“I’m sorry, I’m not sure I know what that means.” He answered innocently and offered his hand forward to shake, a favoured custom of muggles. “I’m David Brent. I live in the village over the hill, what’s your name?”
“I can’t… I’ve got a hot date with Luna Lovegood,” said Fletcher nonchalantly, dusting off her robes.
“Right, Malfoy, because I was under the impression that all dark wizards were deluded followers.” Potter responded quickly, fixing him with an irritated and pointed look.
The nurse appeared a few minutes later, dressed in a tidy, blue uniform that had small stains scattered across it – a coffee stain here, ink there, milk on the hem. She had her hair tied in a bun at the top of her head, and a hospitable smile on her lips. Her greeting was short, sweet, and professional, eyes skipping fleetingly to Potter’s forehead.
“Juniper?” Draco’s exchange of sarcastic looks with his favourite colleague was cut off as Potter approached her, a wave of admirers physically restraining themselves from following. “Kingsley wants a word on Case 341.”
He was washed over by a sense of vulnerability, curled up opposite the Chosen One, who was just a man. Really, Draco had always known Potter was only a boy and then, only a man, but… but they’d never been caught in such a strange scenario.
Regardless, he unscrewed the cap and took an experimental swig of the liquid. If he died, he died a mortal as all wizards ought to. The Dark Lord had been so scared of death, he had refused to accept the simplicity of it. Draco would welcome it with open arms, instead.
It was an ordinary week. The Tuesday Blues hit the office hard, but the intern brought a cake to lift the mood. Draco didn’t steal a slice until everybody else had left for the day. Perhaps the cleaning lady had caught him with an inelegant mouthful of the crumbly cake in the moments after, but it was surprisingly good and he didn’t care.
“Surely, this is enough suspicious behaviour to warrant bringing them in for questioning?” Draco whispered while his brain ran in circles, trying to figure out this group’s confusing actions. He took a bold step forward and snapped a twig in the process.
The breeze turned to the sky, sending its energy through every brick of the structure until the house stood taller, looking down at Harry.
Harry smiled a little. It wasn’t a full-blown grin as Draco wished for, only halfway there. “Not quite. It was actually very sentimental. Hermione, er, was rather embarrassed when he opened her gifts.” Harry paused. “But of course, she remembered to get me a gift, unlike Ron.”
“It’s still sealed, there’s no poison.” Potter raised an eyebrow at the hesitance. “I reckon you’d like it actually. Juniper mentioned you might.”
Potter rolled his eyes, but neither stopped to discuss anything more. They continued to walk, dropping into almost silence, their boots stomping through the frosty mud. They certainly weren't heading in a conventional direction and much to Draco’s displeasure, Potter seemed to be leading them to the castle boundaries. Potter paused on the threshold of the Forbidden Forest and looked across at Draco.
Potter had the same tired look as Shacklebolt, Draco noticed after begrudgingly watching him speak for the past hour. They both carried the weight of the world on their backs, stupid fools. With all they’d done, they should be solely caring for themselves – unlike the
Because dreams were nothing but threats in disguise, as he’d learnt in recent months. All they ever did was lift his spirits, give him a moment to dream, only to watch them all crash and burn.
“So, this boy, what exactly does he make you feel?” Ms Bixley was asking, her new spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose. They were red and had square lenses, perhaps a style Luna would consider; Draco should recommend them the next time she bothers to talk to him again.
He shouldn’t see Potter turn up late after a long night at the pub, looking worse for wear and his glasses hanging crookedly on his nose. Draco should not see Potter’s exhaustion when they’re the only ones left in the office on a particularly late Wednesday night.
”I know you’re rude, bigoted and so fucking wrong sometimes that it’s painful, and I’m worse. It is possible that we can get better together though, you know:
Fletcher and Draco were well-acquainted with the gruelling task of trawling through dozens and dozens of books in sought of a single scrap of information; they’d spent many a long night searching for a hint of a lead in ancient texts, only for it to be a dead end.
Draco considered it, how silent the forest might be, how easily a loud crack will travel through the trees and reveal them.
Harry inhaled sharply, his eyes flashed with anger, and Draco realised this is the closest he’d seen to Harry losing his shit in a long time. “Oh, piss off, Draco! Couples fight, it’s normal.”
So, he ambled into his kitchen that morning, a little less put together than usual. He was dressed, of course, his hair brushed back enough, his tie wiggled into place, but there was Potter, sat at the table, and Draco was starkly aware of the slouch of his own shoulders and the frown on his lips. Potter didn’t seem to notice, a hand tugging at his own hair, as he stirred a steaming cup of tea.
“Malfoy.” Potter said pointedly. Draco was beginning to tire of his own surname. “I want to show you something. Let’s go.”
Surprisingly himself, Draco remained. He crouched next to Potter for twenty minutes, his hand moving up and down the length of Potter’s spine.
to Harry’s rough, groggy morning voice? Not Draco, that was for sure. Especially considering Harry had only kissed him two days ago.
“Yes,” He answered easily, glancing over his shoulder for the nurse, and dropped his voice to whisper, “The curse they placed upon Mr Griffin, assuming it was the cult, we can figure it out now.”
“I’d wager so.” Said Draco, returning his answer in a low whisper too. “But why here? What’s so special about these two forests?”
“I’ll freely admit that I held a grudge! You hurt my fucking feelings in first year and knocked my ego, so I was a dick to you.” Draco shouted, waving his hands around in crazy gestures. He probably had a deranged expression on his face, one to fit the madness. “I know that and I’m sorry, alright? I never wanted you to
“Why would I care about that useless halfwit? He probably can’t even distinguish a standard Chardonnay from a Sauvignon Blanc.” Draco rolled his eyes, although the thought snagged on his mind. It propelled him forward. “I’d bet a few thousand gallons that Potter’s a
A couple of his mother’s friends - their faces vaguely familiar to him - were still circling the small memorial at the front. They seemed downcast. It was a relief that others felt the loss too.
Potter dove into his pocket and withdrew a small recording device. It was muggle technology and a simple memory share would be more efficient, but the residential home had approved it and the other two had a strange overreliance on their technology. The device was placed into Fletcher’s palm and she stashed it away.
was when tires screeched to a stop behind him and he pivoted to see Fletcher’s wild hair caught in the wind as she leaned out the minibus window.
Then, Potter unveiled himself, his ridiculous invisibility cloak falling to the floor. Draco rolled his eyes, because Potter was juggling four shopping bags and a further crate of some sort of orange juice in his arms.
The sofa curled around his frame, though it could equally be trying to swallow Draco into its depths, never to be seen again. He dragged the nearby blanket over his legs; it did nothing to solve the cold that sat forever in his chest, pressing on his lungs and his heart. The fire was dwindling, offering no solace, but it provided enough light for Draco to prop his book on his knees and read.
“Sorry, Draco. A few of the subjects wandered over.” Fletcher’s apology was lightly dipped in sincerity.
“Hush,” Harry’s voice urged in a soft tone. He exhaled particularly heavily, the hot air grazing Draco’s knee.
Harry, his head tilted back to rest against Draco’s collarbone, was alternating between watching Draco’s face, his sharp jawline and high cheekbones and pouted lips and shining eyes, to examining Draco’s body, with all its curves and skinny ankles and gentle creases. Because in moments like these, it was all Harry’s brain could do not to chant a lovesick chorus of
“Yeah...?” Harry said, his gaze lifting from the wet grass that was smothering his boots. With sparkling eyes, it landed on Draco, infinitely heavy and light. It matched with a small smile and his pink cheeks and the slight tilt to his head and his stupid messy hair and everything about him.
The remaining hour crawled by, occupied by a specific variety of pop music Draco couldn’t quite categorise. It was soft, led by piano or guitar, and the voices were soothing, singing of the magic of love and the pain and everything between. The songs had a different spark to those in the wizarding world, but they embed themselves into Draco’s heart with the clever lyrics and universal emotions they tugged upon.
“Maybe if the man gets a good night’s sleep,” Draco commented as their drinks were placed before them. He took an experimental sip of his wine, smiling politely at the waiter, as Potter chugged half of his beer in one swig.
“Is a luxury hotel too basic for the great Harry Potter?” Draco laid the bait, waiting for Potter to step in his snare, to snap back with the boyish bitterness Draco knew.
He leaned closer, peering into Draco’s face. Draco looked back at him, taking in the messy hair and bright eyes and gentle wrinkles on his face, and didn’t say anything. He could shrug and leave. He could shove Harry away. He wasn’t going to do either.
Even still, he sat on the brow of one of the slopes by the Great Lake, wrapped in not enough layers and huddled into himself. The air felt frosty, although it was the late afternoon. Pansy had long abandoned him, resolving to spend the remainder of her free period in the library. Draco hadn’t yet found the conviction to leave. He couldn’t look away from the lake and its ripples.
Draco immediately narrowed his eyes, pushing away the heavy feeling of case hopelessness away and focusing on the ticks that gave away Fletcher’s lie. The discrete fidgeting, the tips of her ears flushing a deep shade of pink.
Limbs wrapped around Draco, lethargic limbs that took their time to curve around his cold frame and squeeze gently. Harry smiled against his chest, Draco could feel it: the extension of his lips, the slight hardness of teeth. He kissed the space between Draco’s shoulder and his collar bone, the moment after. Draco pulled Harry closer.
Harry would stay until gone 4 am and Draco read until he woke and dragged Draco up the stairs by the wrist.
“Are we finished for today, Harry?” Fletcher asked, pulling a chocolate bar out of her pocket and taking a large bite. “I’m starved.”
“I only said you were swearing in your sleep.” Potter explained, turning away to spread syrup across a pile of pancakes. “Quite loud, actually.”
He climbed back into the minibus, carrying the bags over to the kitchen. A flick of his wand lit a couple of lamps, enough to illuminate the kitchen, and another tugged the limited number of cupboards open.
. He shouldn’t have awkward situations dangling in the way of a perfectly respectable work relationship. His father had always underlined the importance of balancing politics in a good job. So, here Draco went… reconciling with Harry Potter.
Draco didn’t even consider her delirious accusations. They were nothing more than that: accusations, with no evidence to back them up. Draco had made it clear for the decade he had known Harry Potter. He didn’t care for the man, nor the new world order he supposedly symbolised. The new world order that still hadn’t arrived.
Draco blinked once, then twice at his teacup cradled in his palms, and thrice at the feet that had rooted him to the spot. He hadn’t moved, it seemed and his mug was still full, no steam left to float to the ceiling.
Draco pulled his arm away from the scorching touch of Potter once they landed at the rear of the van, immediately pulling the back doors open and climbing inside. It wrapped his cold body in a bubble of solid warmth, as though he was bundled up in a blanket by a roaring fire, and Draco exhaled.
This proximity to Potter wasn’t helping Draco’s straying mind. He couldn’t maintain his hold on the theories that slipped around his mind, each of them taunting his lack of knowledge. Each idea gradually morphed into the realisation that he could hardly bring himself to look at the suspects, that the devil on his shoulder was tempting him into glancing over at Potter.
Harry was staring out of the large windows, across the long garden - which wasn’t as well-kept as the rooms, but the house’s magic was gradually trimming back the hedges and weeding the overgrown plants. His eyes were wide with wonder, a look Draco hadn’t seen since their first year of Hogwarts when the entire world had been new to Harry Potter. When magic was the most wonderful thing to exist, when Harry would smile into his palm with glee when he’d thought nobody would see.
There was a poignant silence. Potter seemed to grow restless within it. His brow twitched and he toyed with his sleeve, not looking away from Draco but not entirely looking at him either.
They had reached the broom shed and Harry summoned his broom without a word. Draco followed suit, and before he knew it, they were soaring high above the Quidditch Pitch. The wind was whipping through his hair and curving around his body. Draco felt free. Harry was soaring nearby, weaving through imaginary obstacles and speeding past Draco once in a while with a yelled “I’ll race you!” But by the time, Draco’s mind had caught up with the words, Harry was a hundred yards ahead, laughing and looking over his shoulder.
Fletcher snorted and then, as though he had been waiting for their return, Potter caught their eyes.
The darkness returned, along with the press of Potter’s body. It alleviated as they arrived in a wooded area, the sun blocked out by the huge canopy of branches and leaves above, but Potter’s body remained. His shoulder stayed pressed to Draco as they swept the surrounding area with their eyes, seeking their subjects.
“Yes, sir,” Draco and Fletcher answered automatically, shifting slightly in their seats now that the pleasantries were handled.
Harry grabbed his hand and tugged on it. They were in the middle of a corridor, the odd student pacing towards them, in broad daylight. Draco tried to yank his hand away.
Around midnight, they found one another again. Harry laid down first, Draco followed and this time, he listened to Harry. Draco listened until they fell asleep and Harry’s hand came to rest on Draco’s hip once more. They woke at sunrise and parted ways, they smiled across the Great Hall at breakfast, Harry nudged him in Potions as he passed his desk, one of them found the other waiting in the common room once night had fallen. Draco lost count of the days he woke with Harry’s body heat spread to warm him beneath the blanket.
“I’m just going to pop into the services.” Potter said into the air sometime after they’d passed a town called Andover.
“It’s nothing,” Draco replied swiftly. He lifted the blanket off himself and rose to a stand, bare feet against freezing stone. Harry rolled his head back, slipping to the edge of sleep once more. “I’m going to my room.”
Draco was gone by 3 am, slipping into his bedsheets with the intention to garner a few hours of sleep (despite Weasley’s incessant snoring). Potter wasn’t in the common room when he walked through in the morning.
They parked up a further ten miles down the road and Fletcher set up the concealment charms and warding as Potter stretched the interior of the van.
Draco’s eyes snapped to his. This was hardly the time. Then again, Harry could never choose the right moments, he made them.
and brought along one of those extendable tents that the vendors in Diagon Alley seemed so persistent to sell to him. ‘The Saviour used our most popular extendable tent in the fight against You Know Who!’ they shouted at Draco as he passed through weekly, ‘Get your highly reviewed tent from Milligan’s, endorsed by the Boy Who Lived himself! Half price for a limited time only!’.
Anybody could’ve told Draco that. Weasley snored so loud that Draco could hear it clearly from his dorm room, one floor below. It was infuriating. He didn’t know how Potter had endured it for seven years. Draco wasn’t sure he’d last until the end of term.
“Macmillan knows not to come back for a few hours,” Draco said nonchalantly, wandering to his bed, lifting his loose shirt over his head. Harry was peeling off his robes behind him, they were dropping to the floor. “We’re in the clear until dinner.”
Weasley and Granger deposited themselves on the opposite sofa, stiff expressions setting the mood. Draco could sense something coming, a lecture perhaps, or maybe a warning. He wouldn’t listen anyway. Granger wouldn’t change his mind on one particular thing (or person). Although he could commend her posture, it gave Pansy a run for her money.
“Oh Lord, don’t use my first name,” She narrowed her eyes momentarily to ensure Draco captured her aggression.
The sound bounced through the forest, breaking the peace, and the two suspects whipped their heads up in search of the source. Draco froze out of instinct, despite the protection of the cloak. It took ten long seconds for them to turn away and continue their potentially illegal activities.
The room stilled as Draco looked away from Potter. It didn’t move, nothing changed, just as nothing changed at 2 am on a Thursday night. He should move, there were plenty of adequate sofas placed around the room but none of them were so perfectly adjacent to the fire, so he didn’t.
“Congratulations, Parkinson.” Draco smiled, taking her hand to closely examine the ring. It certainly looked like 24 carat. “Who’s the lucky wizard?
They watched as the two people did indeed carve into the bark of another two trees, after standing around for a while and completing measurement spells to ensure they formed a perfect equilateral triangle. The moment they finished the final rune on the third tree, the atmosphere changed.
“Numerous irreversible effects of an unknown curse, St Mungo’s said,” She peeled herself away from the window and moved over to the tea tray, pouring three cups of tea. “Milk and Sugar?” Fletcher and Draco shook their heads. “They said there was significant brain damage, little to nothing they could do about it though.”
His wish came true when Shacklebolt concluded the meeting early with a weary, “Any questions?” On this fateful Monday morning, nobody did, and Draco was gone before Fletcher could even turn to look for him.
Without another word, Draco was led deeper and deeper into the forest. Distant noises rippled from all angles and amongst the creaking of trees swaying in the breeze. They towered over Draco, sneering at his weak body, at his stumbling. Their roots carried out their bidding, springing up from the ground. Draco raced to catch up from Potter, who walked through the forest as effortlessly as he did everything nowadays.
“Just over there.” Ares flapped his arm in the direction of Potter, Fletcher and the camp. He grinned toothily and hopped on the spot. “Can I come visit your house? I’ve never seen a
The three of them were in the centre of nature, not another person to be seen, and Draco felt like he could breathe.
“Any volunteers to cook dinner?” Potter asked from over his shoulder as he unpacked a number of files onto the desks.
That entire, ridiculous situation had been Theo’s idea after all - something about getting in touch with their fates, finding true love, walking the path destined for them. Theo did regularly spout a sludge of bullshit.
He discretely stuck up his middle finger at her smug face as he slipped out of bed. Her grin only widened.
It was out of the blue that they were going to meet in public and fly together in the open air and limitless sky, and ignore the whispered gossiping, sharp glares and endless ridicule that was bound to occur on Draco’s side. And all of a sudden, on this bland Saturday morning, Harry was eager to humiliate him?
How were they supposed to continue after that kiss? It was barely even a kiss; Draco would classify it as a peck, but it still came from Harry. That changed a whole lot of everything.
. In the same sense that his heart no longer belonged to only himself; it had slipped away as easily as a step in the wrong direction. Although, this had decidedly been anything but. In this case, a daring, inevitable gravitational pull had dragged him to a new fate, perhaps the same fate it always had been.
He wasn’t sure he liked his own place. In all honesty, Draco had been lucky to find this apartment, the looming shadow of his crimes severely diminishing the options available, but when he had money – if he ever gathered enough money – and a redeemed social status, he would move. He would find a place that truly spoke to him.
So, Draco cared about enough people really. He didn’t need to wade in Potter’s problems for a feeling of self-assurance, fixing them wouldn’t elevate his low level of self-worth anyway. The public would make sure of that.
In fact, Draco had been recruited by Shacklebolt in the Summer of ’99 under the terms of his probation to assist in a single case. It revolved around the illegal dealing of a newly mutated chemical compound with magical traces, that had resulted in the death of several high-ranking muggle officials. He was told it was complicated, his work would be unpaid and constrained to a desk with constant supervision. Apparently, Shacklebolt suspected he would know a few of the criminals behind the operation.
Pansy relaxed her shoulders and with the perfected charisma of a pure-blood daughter, she smiled. “We’d be delighted. Right, Draco?”
They did check the carvings. Draco took another sample from the eastern point of the triangle, probably breaking whatever incantation they had tied into the bark, but it didn’t prove itself immediately dangerous. The pattern of runes looked identical to the previous samples, no surprise there.
“So, they’re smart or they have ulterior motives.” Potter sighed and pulled his knees up to his chest, resting his chin on top. “When will we start getting answers?”
He would do fine. Not as well as the three of them combined, but then again, Draco and Fletcher’s collective intelligence wasn’t something that could be contended. Potter could handle a few questions. Surely, he’d had more difficult interviews, the Auror programme interview certainly not being one of them – one pro of almost single-handedly saving thousands of lives from ruin and being a privileged prick.
It was only a blanket, made of wool, but Potter smiled at it the first night that he found it in his spot. He threw it across himself by hand and tucked himself in, nuzzling into the corner of the couch. And so, Draco fell into a new habit. Every night, he made a slight detour in his beeline for the couch, scooping up Potter’s blanket. And Potter would smile at it, his lips lifting sleepily. Draco wanted to know what he was thinking.
The sun shone on Potter’s back as he knelt down to the floor, picked up a toy vehicle – one of those lorries that had been miniaturised to fit inside a palm – and he offered it out to Griffin. There was notable hesitance. Then, a hand reaching out to grab it, a large palm engulfing the small toy.
Two quiet knocks were repeated on the door. Draco stared at the door, wide awake but reluctant. Would Harry be the same? Would
Draco wasn’t scared of a ridiculous muggle invention. So, he squeezed the pump until it refused to inject any more fuel and plugged it clumsily back onto the column, staring wide-eyed at the three other pumps that resided there. Closing the compartment was far more difficult to figure out. After eventually screwing the interior cap back into place, or so Draco hoped, he slapped the exterior flap shut. If all went well, the vehicle wouldn’t combust halfway home.
Draco picked it up, metaphorically, and lifted his chin. “Don’t worry about that, Potter. Fletcher and I are as clean as they come.”
Draco wished on his perfectly brewed potion that afternoon that he could start life over and maybe, he’d manage to do a few things right.
They split for classes with the rest of the school, Draco walking ahead with Pansy. He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder but by the time he turned, Potter was veering in a different direction with Hermione on his arm.
Potter looked at him, his head tilting a fraction to the side. “I dunno, maybe not. Would it hurt to try?”
Potter eased the minibus into each lane, moving with more speed once they’d earned a place in the inner lane, before he moved back to their original position on the far right, and seemed unperturbed about the steady stream of vehicles around them. Draco stared in muted awe at the large containers on wheels that trundled down at some significant speed besides them; sometimes as they passed by, their entire world dimmed for a handful of second before the sun emerged once more from behind the metal giants.
“The crime scene is this way,” Potter said, extending his arm to point across the road with a frown. “Coming, Malfoy?”
“Come with me.” It was poised as a demand but it seemed to be a question. Potter’s tone was gentle and he never spoke to Draco like that. “Malfoy
’, that they’ll learn why we must talk about the war and our losses and our weaknesses. I think I agree with her.”
Potter glanced up at him, not moving his head, and big emerald eyes stared at Draco before they pulled away and fell upon the camp. He didn’t respond. He didn’t say another word for half an hour, gaze ghosting across the area ahead of them.
I'm hoping that the next chapter will be up by the end of this week! Thank you for reading and let me know what you think.
So, even if Potter was determined to trap himself with a former Death Eater in expanded yet confined lodgings for two nights, that wasn’t Draco’s problem.
“This is a surprise. Saint Potter offering his unskilled help...” Draco responded, yet there was no bite in his tired tone. He exhaled heavily and gestured to the small dining area, “You can set the table.”
“We should head back before sunset,” Potter spoke for the first time in hours as the sun ducked behind the cloud coverage. His gaze swung slowly from Fletcher to Draco to garner their reactions. “Have you managed to apply the surveillance spell for tonight, Juniper?”
Harry was looking at him, through tired eyes, and he smiled. He did that so effortlessly. “C’mon, I’ve got a class test tomorrow and I wouldn’t mind getting 6 hours of sleep.” Said Harry as he slid beneath Draco’s sheets and sunk into the pillow.
He folded his arms sceptically and turned to watch the dark trees fly past. Draco was too tired to skirt around the topic and far too reluctant to answer.
They strode through the forest again, in the same silence, and Draco had the same unnerved feeling as before. He kept his eyes strictly on the ground, avoiding the forest’s attempts to bring him to his knees. Potter said nothing. They reached the castle grounds in half the time.
Draco rolled his eyes and pivoted on the spot, casting a glare at the identical paths that led away from here. “Obviously not.”
Draco looked at him. Harry paid no attention; he was preoccupied adjusting the blanket, shifting it so that it wrapped around Draco’s shoulder. “It was fine,” Draco said.
Fletcher and Draco carried out some diagnostic spells, trying to analyse the exact magic used. Little success. The only category they could place the magic remnants under was
The ceremony began and ended, a few tears spared. Draco gave a short speech, impossibly rigid, chin held high as he read his script, not missing a single beat. He would not lose his composure, his mother had prepared him for this for 27 years.
The police force couldn’t find a scrap of evidence to support any claims they might have conceived from the convict’s jumbled ramblings. Only one witch, integrated within the police, needed to step into the crime scene to detect the overwhelming dark magic that resided in the area and alert the Ministry.
“It’s hard to ignore a man dead on his feet,” He responded, letting his gaze settle for a moment too long on Potter.
“It seems,” Fletcher piped up, looking between the men, “That it could be a single individual rather than an entire group.”
Potter was just another idiot who jumped headfirst into a war, sinking out of his depth, and the annoying child saviour that couldn’t help tossing himself into danger at every turn. That was who Potter was to Draco: a playground nemesis, a toy for prodding and pushing. He was not a friend, nor this hot, social man he had tried to become.
been slowly easing into the mindset that another day of work was almost over, and his bed was beckoning his lethargic limbs. Who knew you could exert so much energy sat at a desk all day? But now, Potter and he were sprinting to the Atrium, and Draco’s legs ached.
It was rather telling how the three of them could relate to a lack of family, more startingly so that Draco was the most fortunate if it ever became a cruel competition. A mother was all he had, yet more than enough; he had fared better than most in the war. He would probably have fared much better than Arthur Griffin in this situation.
“Maybe they followed the stream to their next settlement spot? Early civilisations and hunter-gatherers used to set up their camps along a river so that they had a constant water source.” Fletcher suggested in a faint attempt at mediation. “We should try sticking to that nearby river and see if it leads to them.”
Then, it was a short wait. They sat in the provided chairs, gazes gliding around the room absentmindedly. Potter’s fingers were drumming against his thigh. Draco tried not to focus on the steady rhythm of the movement, forcing his eyes away, only for them to return.
Perhaps it was symbolic, the exact positioning of his soul mark. His left arm was where the black ink was engraved into Harry’s core, slap bang in the centre of his forearm - mirroring the unnatural mark that was carved into Draco’s own left arm, the one they tended not to talk about.
They landed unsteadily on a pile of obtruding tree roots. Potter tugged him quickly behind a wide tree and pointed in the direction of two people. A wizard and a witch. Both untidy and unkempt, both with wands in their hands.
Judging by the small micro-expressions and winces that were betraying Potter’s true reaction, he wasn’t experiencing any success. Griffin was now toying with the frayed edges of his t-shirt as Potter talked, eyes in his lap, his mind elsewhere. There was an occasional nod, or perhaps a shake of his head. He seemed too anxious for a single answer to be worthwhile their time.
Potter unlocked the back of the minibus, tossing Fletcher her bag, before he began casting a charm on the interior. It appeared to be a standard Undetectable Extension Charm.
They had forecasted a turbulent love, one that would drown them both and yet offer moments of salvation. A connection that was once in a lifetime.
Swallowing heavily, Fletcher looked over her shoulder and saw Potter, his tired eyes blinking at them. An apology was on the tip of her tongue, then Potter moved, lowering himself back behind the desk, and began reading once again.
“We should visit the crime scene. The police have removed all their evidence and it’s no longer under observation. So, we should go and scope out the place.” Potter said, shedding his outer robes on his chair before he settled into it, kicking his legs onto the corner of his desk.
in a rough scrawl that certainly didn’t belong to Fletcher. But he turned it over and found her elegant cursive,
Draco’s father remained in his room every moment of the day and night, only offering a glance as greeting to Draco once he arrived. Besides the house arrest situation, it wasn’t particularly different to any other Christmas. Draco’s father had never been impressed by the notion of the festive period, made popular by deluded muggles.
His only other social commitment consisted of Greg fire-calling him on Thursday evening while Draco leant against the mantle, listening and smiling at the correct prompts.
There was a smear of sauce on the tip of Potter’s chin, enough to draw a gaze that couldn’t quite move away, except when it gradually shifted up to the rest of Potter’s features. Across his full lips, his blemished skin, the small indent on his nose where his glasses had been sitting, his emerald eyes.
He followed as they entered a grand pub, three stories high, old brickwork outlining its name. Although, Draco didn’t pay much attention, too distracted by Potter flagging down a drifting waiter to notice the refined details of the establishment. He swung a cursory glance around as they were seated at a plain square table near the back, propped beside a framed map of London.
“It’s awful really, what’s happened to Arthur.” She continued, clinking her spoon against the cup as she stirred her tea. “No family to speak of, no memories of his long life. The only thing that ties him to his old life is his body. Isn’t that sad? Poor man.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but smiled nonetheless. “I wonder how quickly this house will rejuvenate itself for me.”
The wards hummed in a sudden alert, whispering its message down Harry’s spine. He blinked and loosened the wards, changing the property's access settings with a distracted jerk of his wand.
3. I do not support JKR nor her transphobic views and I stand with the trans community. This hadn't been mentioned on any of my other works, it was about time it was.
“Mhm,” Harry replied, snuggling against Draco, settling between his legs. He yawned. “Something along those lines, I’m sure the Hogwarts rumour mill can answer that question for you.”
He wrote up the notes Fletcher had long abandoned today, deciding tonight was not the appropriate time to share his working theory, and then the lights were out by 9 pm, following a silent agreement and a flick of Potter’s wand.
The recipient of his incoming apology minutely tilted his head in Draco’s direction and that was enough. It was easier if Draco couldn’t see Potter’s eyes anyway.
Upon reaching the fireplaces, Potter paused, yanking the map open once more and relocated the two flashing dots in the west of Kent. He pressed a finger to them and appeared to memorise the surrounding area, preparing for the journey.
Lunch was an interesting and silent ordeal. It involved Draco and Fletcher playing an unfriendly match of tossing glares at each other, punctuated with wary glances at Potter’s expressionless face. In a matter of seconds, in the length of a short conversation, the ease and light contentment Draco had come to expect in the presence of these two particular colleagues had been lost.
Fletcher had risen before him, evidenced by the gentle clicking of a spoon against china as she stirred her morning tea. There were low voices too, the other being as almost as familiar as Fletcher’s rough voice.
Eventually, Draco’s thick skin outlived his colleagues’ perseverance and he proved himself worthy of at least a shred of their respect, with the speed that he solved cases. Back then, all he had to do was gather the evidence, write a thorough report, and send the aurors to a specific location for a straightforward arrest or two.
Unexpectedly, Potter chuckled under his breath and looked towards the minibus, as though to search for a familiar mane of hair. Fletcher didn’t emerge with a crazy grin, but Draco almost expected her to. He wouldn’t mind her arms wrapping around him, despite any protests he might feign, and Fletcher squeezing him tight, exactly how he hugged his mother. Was that a sign of love?
From the intel Fletcher had gathered, the former member of the Dartmoor Cult wouldn’t necessarily respond to any hard-hitting questions like they’d hoped. Fletcher had written a list but later had to strike off more than half of her questions when she’d heard more about the condition of the subject.
Potter was back the following evening, dressed in ridiculous muggle pyjamas with yellow bears printed on the bottoms. Draco cast a disgusted look at them before the blanket hid them from view. Potter said nothing. And Draco resisted the temptation to fall asleep there and then.
They had also promised unworldly pain and grief, notwithstanding the torment already felt, and a subsequent hope.
“Yes, that’s right. Are you both well?” Shacklebolt asked with genuineness stained in his kind eyes. And Draco hadn’t met him until long after the war, but he could tell they had always been that way –
Potter joined him on the couch that night. His hair was messy and rugged and he had tired eyes. His jawline was sharp and his cheeks were soft, which Draco learnt as Potter laid down and rested his head on Draco’s thigh. Once again, Draco didn’t move a muscle. He stared down at the man resting on him.
“They’re not going to disappear, Draco,” Harry said into his neck, engulfing his boyfriend in a hug and a series of chaste kisses to the rest of his exposed skin. “You’re
It wasn’t too shabby, being the centre of her scrutiny, potentially being the pivot point in this case. And having one-to-one communication with one of the cult members? They could have this case solved in a couple of weeks with Fletcher’s problem-solving skills, Draco’s intuition, and Potter’s… brawn.
That was the most triumphant statement he had made since the War. Life was continuing, whether Draco was tagging along or not. And for the first time in years, he felt like he might stop getting dragged along without a choice in the matter.
“No, no. You don’t see, naïve child.” Fletcher soothed him patronisingly and patted him on the shoulder. “Draco has never told me a secret. I’ve known him 15 months, I’ve endured his lame jokes for
He never thought he’d see the day that he missed Potter. Draco realised he’d spent his entire holidays wishing for one particular person’s company. And some of the emotions, no matter how reluctant they had been, were making sense.
Potter pulled out the printed photos of the cult members, laying them out of the floor between them, and asked another question. He had a kind look in his eyes, a patience that Draco was coming to recognise. Then a flash of disappointment as Griffin shook his head quickly.
Potter nodded but turned back to the forest. And it wasn’t Draco’s business, it wasn’t in Draco’s capacity to care, so he left.
The magic was peculiar. It tugged on Draco’s nerves and twisted them inside out until he had to shake it away.
Draco said nothing. He kept his eyes glued on Slughorn during his usual drivelling, they shifted to his cauldron once they were set today’s task. He completed it before anybody else, slinking out of his seat to Slughorn with a small vial. Even he fixed Draco with an awkward look, dismissing him from class in an instant, although Draco couldn’t tell whether he’d heard the rumours or whether it was the same look that all the teachers gave him. Pity.
Draco tossed and turned until he fell asleep despite the abusive thoughts. Fletcher, too, followed into the pits of sleep. Leaving only Potter.
The sunlight being fed through the tiny window up above illuminated Draco’s pale skin, offering glimmers of canary yellow against white: short-lived flickers of colour that danced up Draco’s body before vanishing into the grey abyss of stone.
“Why don’t you tell Potter about the great porridge incident with your last boyfriend? That’s a delightful tale,” Draco prodded his work friend from across the table with a wicked grin.
Draco rolled his eyes and stood in the kitchen for a minute, lightly kicking the cupboard, to show he wasn’t going to follow any ridiculous orders from Potter. But he inevitably padded over to his bed and climbed back into the warmth.
“It’s a shame he’s no longer around to keep your prospective husbands at bay then. Isn’t it?” Fletcher swiped back, not bothering to hide the glee she garnered from a swift back and forth.
One moment, Draco was strolling down the corridor, his chin held high, his posture perfect, pretending as usual as though he wasn’t crippled inside. Then he saw Potter, walking as part of the Golden Trio, and they locked eyes. Potter gave him a Look and it had rippled out of Draco before he could stop it. It had been piling up, the guilt and the horror, until it burst and so now, Draco was yelling across a semi-empty corridor.
“I’m asking exactly the question I asked.” Potter repeated wearily, his neutral expression unchanged. “Do you like your job? Genuinely.”
“Harry!” He moved slightly at the sound, his shoulders tensing. Draco repeated in a whisper, “Harry…!”
Potter was stood at the rear of the vehicle, unlocking some small compartment in the side. He lifted a single eyebrow at Draco’s hesitance and beckoned him over.
“How big of a promotion?” Draco answered with a question. He didn’t pay much mind to the department’s rumour mill, but he usually didn’t miss the larger, more notable whispers.
Harry thrust his hands out of the blanket, they stretched into the air perpendicular to his body, and wiggled his fingers – a silent demand. Draco rolled his eyes, conceding, and lifted Harry to a seated position.
“Weasley is highly predictable, I wouldn’t be surprised if he got her a tacky necklace and an exam planner,” Draco said, watching the quidditch field as it drew closer and closer.
“—come get you…?” When Potter didn’t move, shaking feebly in his crouched position, Draco rolled his eyes. “For Merlin’s sake, let’s get you to a bathroom.”
It was nothing more than an alcove in a dingy corridor of many. Carved out between three slabs of stone. There was a window high above, and a ceiling far out of reach, three walls and a heightened horizontal slab to sit upon. All of it was stone, the very essence of the Hogwarts architecture. That was this little escape in its entirety.
It was almost two in the morning and Draco had accepted that he wouldn’t see Harry; not only was Draco not going to the common room but Harry hadn’t come to find him either.
Winter was creeping closer. Draco clung to the bright, vibrant colours of autumn. He didn’t want the trees to dissolve into their skeletal corpses of rough bark and pointy branches. He didn’t like winter. It used to be his favourite season but nowadays, the sharp air punctured his lungs and left Draco numb. Last year’s winter had been long enough to last a lifetime. So, he would far prefer rain: the sporadic, living, passionate rainfalls that washed away his thoughts.
If only they’d attended the crime scene in the first few days following the incident. Why hadn’t they attended the crime scene earlier?
Obviously, Draco tactically wormed his way out of answering for two reasons. Firstly, Potter didn’t have the right to such an admission and, secondly, Draco would have to confess the truth to himself before he could even try.
“Where did they go? Potter?” Draco turned quickly towards his colleague, likely with a frantic look etched on his face.
Question by question, head shake followed by head shake, the time crept by. Potter was casting looks in Draco’s direction, pinching his mouth slightly, and expressing the disappointment they both felt.
“Go sleep!” Harry would mumble in a sleepy, semi-aggressive manner and deposit Draco at his room with a wordless point at the door. And Draco would roll his eyes and slip into his room. He would listen to Harry creep up the stairs until his footsteps merged into Weasley’s snoring. Draco would fall into bed and sleep restlessly.
“No harm in turning up early, let’s head in,” Potter said, striding forward and upward, his arms swinging with dramatic flair.
“I lied.” Draco said and wanted to clamp a hand over his mouth a second later. Potter slightly lifted his eyebrows. “I…I don’t like my job. The Ministry is still fucked up and everybody is ignoring that. The work can be interesting…but if I could get a job anywhere else, I wouldn’t hesitate to quit.”
“A petrol station,” Potter answered as though Draco was a fool. “We wouldn’t get very far at all without refuelling.”
“Show me it again,” Draco demanded quietly, lacking the malice Harry had once associated with this face, as his fingers found Harry’s wrists. With reluctance and the same hushed voice, Draco tagged on a simple “please”.
Unfortunately, Potter didn’t receive the memo. He wandered in a few minutes later, clutching a cupcake, and sat down at the desk opposite. He ate through a smile, eyes to the ceiling.
So, Draco stumbled down the stairs to the common room a few minutes later than usual. Potter was already there, wrapped in a warm bubble, smiling into the blanket. Draco lowered himself onto his side of the couch. He made a point of opening his book, even though the words all merged into another and taunted him in gibberish.
“It can’t be warding. They’ve been at this campsite for several days, why would they create additional protection?” Potter asked neither of them in particular.
“I do, actually. Well, some days.” Potter said, his tone level and devoid of emotion. “I can’t claim it’s anymore efficient than apparition, but it does the job.”
Fletcher led the way upon Draco’s prompting, and they both emerged into a large space with low hanging lamps. There was a couple of desks in the distant corner, propped against three neatly lined up twin beds. A sofa was sat in the near left, facing a small kitchen and its adjoining dining space.
They trundled along slowly, constrained by what seemed to be limits on their speed – signposted in big red circles or a particularly strange symbol in black and white that had Potter sharply speeding up.
Draco slept for a couple of quick hours, his body melting into the mattress. It was dreamless, meaningless; it allowed plenty of time for body restoration, but Draco still awoke. As seemed to be the trend, Potter wasn’t there when he did.
“Potter!” Draco suddenly called out, his voice carrying over the hundred-yard distance to its intended recipient. “Why wasn’t this case investigated
Although, as Draco watched the pair of them walk a few feet closer to the camp, his eyes came to settle on Potter’s arse and he didn’t particularly mind.
Draco strode over, pulling the passenger door open and clambering inside. “Under the implied promise of an overtime bonus, of course I did.”
He pushed through the wild undergrowth and stopped a hundred yards in. Voices drifted over, woven with casual incantations, nothing more than simple spells.
“Hermione caught me, this morning, leaving your room,” Harry said awkwardly, his hand rising to rub at his neck. His bicep tensed as he did so, and Draco noted how attractive that single move was. Harry as a whole was ridiculously attractive. “Thought you should know-- I, er, know how you might feel about that.”
“Earth to Draco?” Fletcher tugged on his elbow as they left the office and walked down the long corridor. They’d redecorated this summer, swapping the neutral colours for some appalling spiral wallpaper – Michaels in Muggle relations probably suggested it,
Bit by bit they widened their scope with no luck. The group had left almost no trace. There was not a single magical signature that lingered, and their attempted tracking spells couldn’t cling onto the residual for long enough to settle onto a single direction. So, the three of them slumped against a tree stump at midday for a spot of lunch.
“No, really. It was inappropriate, I should have…” Potter trailed off, his eyes catching Draco’s. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, I like your flat, it’s beautiful in the morning light – or maybe any light... I guess I didn’t really pay attention to much more than the bottom of your toilet last night.”
“You two do not have licenses for combat action! And I am not facing off twenty-odd wizards of unknown magical ability by myself.” Potter hissed, his face turning a startling shade of pink. “It’s not worth the risk.”
“I thought this lead would be the one,” Fletcher said into the air, drawing his gaze away for a moment.
Draco’s eyes narrowed, his defences rising steeply to their maximum height. “What are you implying, Potter? Are you trying to suggest I’m not good enough to—?"
So, they packed up, leaving the area as untouched as possible. Slipping further into the wood and a few hundred metres into the woods, they apparated back to the minibus. It was Draco this time, who grabbed Fletcher’s wrist and tentative clutched Potter’s elbow.
, and for some reason or another, Potter had stuck around. Perhaps it was the way Draco flippantly answered all of his not-so-nonchalant questions about his personal life, maybe it had egged him on.
Potter shrugged. “It’s good to talk about it. I see no reason not to tell you. The days get a little easier when you talk about the hard times.”
Well, Draco thought, if he was going to bear the consequences, he should take full advantages of the perks. His reputation would be boosted (his father would be bloody ecstatic to hear so), maybe fewer people would spit on the ground he walked from now onwards, and… and he still had Harry. If there was anything that would draw Harry closer to him, it was others’ criticism – he was a stubborn idiot like that. Harry would defy their expectations; Draco fucking loved the sound of that. Him and Harry, side by side, sticking their middle fingers up at the rest of the world. Draco smiled to himself.
Draco set off in the opposite direction to Potter. He would take the longest detour to class if he must. There was a gaze on his back. Draco ignored it.
“Do we know whether they’re living in the forest?” Draco asked, drawing a line across his parchment to begin a new section of notes. “If not, these wizards and witches could be within wizarding society, or indeed the Ministry.”
There was nowhere to go and nothing to do on this Saturday morning, besides stress about the countdown to NEWTs. But the room was bright and the sunlight flooded the dorms so easily in this tower; Draco couldn’t sleep, missing the perpetual darkness of the Slytherin dungeons. He even missed the people, perhaps not some of the despicable personalities. Maybe he was still one of them.
The latter was remarkably fascinating. Draco might divulge into a few more in the same field of research once his free time was no longer clogged up by Potter’s and Fletcher’s work escapades.
A twig snapped behind him and he startled as Potter threw himself bedside Draco, peering around the other side of the boulder.
In old times, magic of this kind was used to create specific shapes and generate natural wards. So, the odds were that the two trees they’d found were part of a larger geometric shape – the more lines, the greater the strength of magic… in theory.
“—We’ve already discussed this, Potter,” Draco interrupted when Potter began repeating a redundant point he’d made ten minutes prior. “It’s unlikely that there is some evil mastermind at the centre of this group. This could be a large group of highly competent wizards, as the complex charms imply. We shouldn’t dismiss them as a gang of deluded followers with a psychotic leader.”
Draco had assigned no value to the cards ten months prior, especially since it was Sybil Trelawney’s hands that placed them down. He had sneered to himself, casting some look of disdain from the table to Theo.
A brown-bricked, two-story house stood before him, neglected in appearance with the overgrown moss and ivy that draped itself over every inch of free space, but it was larger than he’d expected (even with his knowledge of the Potter fortune). The windows peeked through slim gaps, dirty and grey, large cracks splitting the upper right glass frame into three parts. The chimney stack was clinging onto the final slates of the weathered roof, hovering precariously over the semi-detached garage at the far right of the driveway. But all things considered, the building wasn’t in bad shape.
“Ron was driving me up the walls with his endless Chudley Cannons talk.” He said, dragging Draco down with him into the alcove.
“Maybe they suspect the Ministry is following them. The muggle police dropped the case weeks ago, but it was enough to grab our attention,” Fletcher suggested.
she found out. Pansy learnt everybody’s secrets. In fact, Draco had better begin planning his counterattack this very moment.
“My mother will hold you to that promise.” Draco pushed away the amusement that was tugging at the tips of his lips. “This is your last chance to back out.”
By now, Draco was quite indifferent to the ridiculous spectacle. All Potter had to do was fire a half-accurate hex at a mildly threatening squirrel and everybody in the forsaken vicinity began a round of applause, even rising to a standing ovation on one occasion. Everybody except Potter’s friends, Draco, and Juniper Fletcher.
When Draco returned his gaze, inevitably, to Potter, his eyes were closed and his glasses had been discarded. Potter was tucked into the cushions and he was breathing steadily. He looked more at peace than Draco had ever seen. He had seen Potter angry and stupidly happy and on the brink of death. Peace suited him.
“I still don’t understand this case.” Fletcher said, staring down at the group, head tilted to the side.
Potter followed the answer with a kiss, chaste but as sweet as the cherries he snacked on during the day.
“How about we get somewhere a little more private?” Draco said, his breaths skimming Harry’s pink lips. He flicked his eyes up towards the gaping audience and the pointing fingers. “Unless exhibitionism is something you’d like to try?”
Macmillan’s heavy breathing filled the air as Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed, settling in a cross-legged position, and tugged on his wrist. Draco stumbled and followed without the chance to protest. Harry flicked his wand and the bed curtains all closed. He muttered a
Draco found himself wishing his imagination hadn’t stretched so far when something in his chest sunk.
He looked helpless here, slumped on the floor, hair stuck to his forehead, the toilet seat at his fingers rather than the world. His skin was sickly pale and he was shaking a little bit. Enough to bring Draco’s fingers to his back as he dry-coughed into the bowl.
“I told you not to call me that!” He injected, the strength of his outburst toppling him forwards, his arms clutching Draco’s as he murmured into Draco’s shoulder. “Please.”
Harry grinned and he had that mischievous look in his eyes, it sparkled. “Nothing in particular. I just saw you brooding and figured you wouldn’t mind a chat.”
“Potter is not a prospective husband. I’d rather marry a swine – and invite the wretched Prophet! – than spend the rest of my sinful days looking at Potter’s stupid face.”
Draco would argue back, he really would, but it would get nasty and Potter was right there, staring at him in a different light. He suddenly wanted to slap the words back into Fletcher’s mouth; it was her fault Potter was looking at Draco like he
Then, there was a distant patter of voices and Draco felt a light wave of magic wash down his skin. He froze once again, tilting his head towards the thick forest to his side, and stared in the direction of the magic. Almost automatically, his legs rallied his body forward. It was instinctual, and the magic felt familiar, though unsettling.
Until Potter finished his training a few months later and Draco’s work life deteriorated further. At the beginning, he’d hoped that Potter’s fellow aurors would be too distracted with the shining smile of their stupid savour that the abuse towards Draco would lessen. He was wrong. If anything, it egged them on, being able to compare the remarkable achievements of the Boy Who Lived Twice to the Dark Lord’s former housemate.
He tried to retaliate with little success; Fletcher was a master at non-verbal protego spells. When it was bordering on uncivilised, if they hadn’t long passed that line, Draco spotted something.
Potter had found him in his dusty library of loanable books, supposedly in sought of a first-edition copy of
On Friday morning, they met at one of the Ministry’s stations in – what Draco had recently understood to be colloquially known as – zone four of London, specifically in the south-west, between Twickenham and Richmond.
Monday morning was as bland as the coffee Draco bought from the new roadside vendor. He made his way to the office, taking risky sips of his coffee as the lift lurched and jolted, passing a few vague acquaintances in the corridors and nodding politely.
They locked eyes once as they both navigated across the busy train platform at Kings Cross. Draco looked away at the same time as Potter, dropping the gaze of which nobody else knew the significance. Nobody knew that Potter spoke to Draco as his equal, nobody would possibly imagine their saviour making small talk with a former Death Eater. Draco turned and made the journey home alone.
“Excuse me?” Draco swung his eyes to Potter. He didn’t know what Potter’s intentions were, he didn’t have a clue, and that terrified him.
“Just go home,” Draco paused, weighing up the viable options. No matter what happened now, he wanted to be on the amicable side of Potter. So, he tagged on a foreign, “Harry.”
His eyes flickered to Potter’s hair, which sat in its messy curls, and they lingered. Too long. Long enough for Potter to shift in his seat and raise a subconscious hand to the crown of his head.
Draco nodded slowly, a frown pushing through. “I wasn’t sure it would do anything, but I can already feel… a change – that must count for something.”
“It was the strangest thing. The man – Ares – he seemed to be, for all intents and purposes, a child.” Draco said, expanding. “He was our age. Although, his conversational skills seemed to be level with that of, perhaps, a… five-year-old?”
So, as the light was fed through the dimmed minibus windows the next morning, Draco stirred, thankful for the calm awakening. He rolled onto his side, gradually noting where he was, who he was with, and it all felt simply uninteresting.
Please also be aware that one of the characters in this chapter has a condition that would fall under the classification of a neurological disorder or an intellectual or developmental disability, as did a character in the previous chapter. I believe my descriptions are respectful to the communities that suffer from similar conditions, however please call me out on anything where necessary.
Potter didn’t save the bleeding Wizarding World for Draco to form a mild case of attraction for the man. He was untouchable, the Saviour, the recipient of Witch Weekly’s most charming smile three years running, a national treasure.
Fletcher took that moment to smirk, tipping her head in Draco’s direction. He narrowed his eyes, not grasping her implication, but raised an eyebrow challengingly anyway.
The van creaked, wind whipping by the windows, as Draco padded across the room. It somehow didn’t take much thought to open the door and peer outside.
“Do you wanna check the carvings?” Potter asked, loosening the cloak around Draco before tugging it off completely.
She nodded firmly, patting her bag. “Yep, the photos are here, and we’ll know if they step even an inch outside of the law… I hope.”
Harry’s lungs filled with oxygen as he gasped, quietly and sharply. The air turned his surprise into salty tears that welled in his eyes.
Draco raised his complaints once they’d found one another at the minibus. The sun was setting once again and it was simple reminder of another day passing and nothing to show for it.
Draco stared out of the window as they drove the final miles out of London. He watched as office buildings and shops gave way to houses in the suburbs and bungalows until they gave way to a higher concentration of parks and fences. They travelled along wide roads until they were surrounded by only cars and trees, huge trees that were cut back but clearly twice the size of their minibus.
“Don’t look at me like that, Malfoy.” He said. Draco slightly corrected his expression; he couldn’t help it. The Forbidden Forest wasn’t exactly notorious for being a tourist hotspot, and nobody could blame him for imagining with horror what exactly Potter intended to
The intention was to be soothing, he supposed, but something was holding him back: the screaming voice trying to flag how utterly foreign this situation was.
Potter didn’t seem to particularly care who saw them, he appeared to have no qualms about his reputation. Saying that, Draco noticed that he also waited until everybody had fallen asleep to tiptoe down the stairs and join Draco on the couch. Each time, he settled into Draco with a sheepish grin. For some reason, neither of them found the need to say much at all.
“I’m fine, Draco. Isn’t there a departmental meeting in five?” She asked as Draco walked, and she followed by default, into the mini-office.
“These books are useless!” She declared resolutely, slumping onto her forearms and resting her fringe against the desk. “This is all pointless if we don’t have the opportunity to observe the group in action. We have absolutely no clue what they’re doing or why.”
“Life is not that simple.” Draco frowned and clambered to his feet, slipping his bare feet into his slippers. He began to walk away, heading for the safety of his bed where quiet would reign supreme.
“Draco, love, you don’t call anybody by their first name.” Fletcher swiped back. “Your poor friends aren’t even offered that rare gift. Is now really the appropriate time to discuss your appalling attachment issues?”
“I think it’s about time you let somebody in, Draco,” Potter said and Draco rapidly looked away, glaring at his feet. His jaw tightened. Who was Harry Potter to tell him what he should do? “It doesn’t have to be me. But you should talk to someone.”
The man certainly had magic; Draco could feel it. Although. it felt fresh, young. Magic like this shouldn’t belong to a twenty-something.
“It has some interesting articles. They aren’t far off with their theory about the Fodger Giant Uprising in Thailand!”
Potter beckoned them into the minibus once the job was done and Draco left his bag on the same bed as last week before gathering by the desks. Potter was in his chair.
“Wait a minute, Potter.” He suddenly said, slamming his hand down on the seat between him and Potter. “You said you-you
“Malfoy, it’s no trouble.” Potter caught his gaze, holding it, unafraid. So fucking stubborn. “Just tell her, yeah? Anything at all.”
“Is that an insult?” Draco responded, opening his working day with a question. His lips hadn’t wrapped around words since
Then, behind their mugs of tea, the clouds unleashing torrential rain onto the streets outside, Potter had leant across the chairs, across the narrow space that separated them and had given them space to quietly grow and forgive, and he had kissed Draco for the first time.
She responded with a childish poke of her tongue in his direction and slumped back into her bed. “You’re one to talk, Draco fucking Malfoy.”
Draco had enough to care about. He visited his mother in the evenings, resisting the temptation to wrap her frail body in his arms and never let go. Pansy met him for lunch on Wednesday, flashing a shiny engagement ring that had been slipped onto her finger on Sunday by the most successful bachelor in her own miniature dating show.
“Thanks, Juniper. Did you buy any snacks? I’d kill for a chocolate bar right now.” Potter said, meeting Draco’s eyes at precisely the inappropriate time and yanking his gaze away.
The last of the groceries were slotted into place and the cupboards closed softly, leaving Potter and Draco stood in the kitchen, hands on hips, with nothing left to move.
Several hours later, the portkey spun him to the rear of a pub. He could hear jolly singing inside, likely from drunken workers who had bunked off a full day of work. The smell of pastries drifted his way as he walked around to the front of the pub and looked up at the creaky sign.
“Clearly,” Replied Draco, badly concealing a matching grin. It broke through a little, a flash of teeth, then it vanished. “Let’s go, before I receive twenty hexes to my back.”
“Sleep, Potter,” Draco said in warning, though Harry was uninfluenced by the most venomous of looks. Draco realised he’d probably been on the other end of worse, far worse.
Draco looked at Harry, his face not far from his own. There was something simultaneously charming and surreal about this situation. Harry’s eyes were bright in this lightless box, and Draco smiled at him. “I suppose I can live with that.”
Potter looked back, eyes widening a fraction. But Fletcher nodded encouragingly, passing her detailed list of questions through the door, and he turned to continue.
A house that should never have been forgotten was revealing its beauty. Harry was here to make it home once again.
Potter was staring at him, a frown on his face. Oh, how Draco hated that frown. He had no idea which intricate emotion was lying behind the frown, but it couldn’t be good. For Salazar’s sake, Draco has just screamed at the chosen one with half the sanity of a long-term prisoner of Azkaban. He noticed Granger’s and Weasley’s expressions now. The latter had his wand out, primed for an attack, and Granger, she was staring like Potter but with something piercing in her eyes.
That, Draco admitted, was a relatively reasonable explanation. They could have, still, stayed at a hotel or found their own accommodations perhaps. Draco himself had been eyeing up a particularly well-rated hotel in the area. The department was covering expenses after all. But it was unfortunately Potter’s call at the end of the day.
Nobody came here, even his mother only made a visit once a blue moon. His friends - the ones he had left - insisted on meeting in a public place, occasionally stumbling back to Parkinson’s for the night. Did they even know his address? Not even owls flew here.
Draco levitated the crate out of his arms and sent it inside, grabbing two of the packed bags himself. Potter didn’t resist, the slump of his shoulders easing a fraction and his face looking less deathly pale. No wonder, the bags were crammed with groceries, brands and logos that Draco didn’t recognise aside from the few that Fletcher brought in for her weekday lunches.
There, he could see smiling faces with familiar noses and cheekbones and tousled black hair. He could see a trio of people, people that looked like him: a young boy, an older woman and a man. The pictures moved in a short loop: the woman brushing a stray hair out of the boy’s eyes, smiles splitting into grins, the man adjusting his crooked hat, another boy bursting into the scene. Sirius.
Draco couldn’t catch on but maintained her stare regardless, up to the point where Fletcher had to rip her gaze away to answer one of Potter’s many technical questions. The two of them seemed to be bonding over that stupid map, discussing the specifications of the spell – all as though the Ministry didn’t confiscate fifty-odd magical maps, every year, that were up to no good. Surely this wasn’t the first map of the kind Potter had seen.
Fletcher cleared her throat as she nodded slowly in an awkward act of empathy, a pained expression on her face. “Were the authorities able to trace any family?”
“Harry Potter's official booty call, hm?” Draco mulled it over, mostly ignoring Harry’s comment. “I suppose that's a better title than half the bullshit everybody else claims.”
Draco slumped onto the edge of the minibus, teetering between the inside and out. His brow was furrowed as he weighed the likely options. Knowing Potter’s saviour complex wasn’t something that could possibly have been resolved in a short five years, it was a highly likely option that he was planning something stupid. It was more likely that Potter was already knee-deep in his self-inflicted trouble.
The occasional bickering became gentle arguments - self-righteous stubbornness leading the way - then fully-fledged fights. Doors slammed and red faces, hurtful words and lost meanings.
“Nice to meet you, Ares.” Draco continued as though this was a perfectly normal situation. He hadn’t done undercover work since his probation, one of the many conditions to his freedom was spying on his former ‘comrades’. He intended to never dip his toes into the dangerous waters again. “Are you named after the Greek God Ares?”
Draco straightened up, removing his gaze from the stable ground that held him fixed in place. “Right, yes.”
So, he carved out the outer layer of bark of the tree and peeled it off, walking around the tree to gather the full circle of writing.
They ate between sentences, Potter gulping down his entire pie in a few bites, scoffing the chips with a guzzle of ketchup and mayonnaise. None of it stopped him nattering, but Draco was surprised to see he had enough table manners not to talk with his mouth full. One of many things to change since their adolescence.
It was ten o’clock. Draco had a blanket over his legs, the fire roaring, as he rested on the sofa, a book in hand. He hadn’t moved for two hours, his eyes drifting lazily from the flames to the words, the words that jumbled together and strung together non-sensical sentences. Time had drifted out of his grasp, slipping away.
The minutes ticked by, morphing into an hour and then another. They stopped at another ‘services’ for a toilet trip, but Draco stayed put. The last thing he needed was to spend a minute too long in the toilet and discover they’d left him behind. He could perfectly imagine Potter’s gleeful expression as they left him in the dust.
But she sounded happy and Draco knew she wasn’t often happy while she worked. He wouldn’t take that away from her, no matter how much Potter agitated his very being.
There was a heavy exhale. Then, a chuckle. Potter was laughing quietly, his shoulder shaking against Draco’s, as he said, “I never thought I’d hear you say that.”
Potter said nothing as Draco set to work, racking his brain for a number of spells that might make the link if he could manipulate them enough to give him the parameters he wanted. He whispered them, following through with minute movements of his wand.
Draco knew he’d have to build a semblance of friendship with both of Harry’s friends – but that was a challenge for later months (and years).
Fletcher grabbed her case notes from her bag and directed her entire capacity of attention to Draco, pen in hand. “Tell me every word you said.”
From an outsider’s perspective, it seemed completely random. There was no well-known correlation between the two forests, at least nothing that jumped to mind. They both had trees and dog walkers and… the same natural magic that vibrated through all forests of the world. Could this be related to the runic symbols and that ancient form of magic? Draco could only guess at this stage.
“All the professors are banging on about NEWTs being around the corner-” Harry said, his eyes shifting to meet Draco’s as they laid inches apart. He blinked. “-and that we should make the most of—”
“Your mum lied; I suppose you know that by now.” Potter continued after a moment. “She saved my life, I owe that much to her. Everything could have been, er, very different. After all, I can only survive death so many times.”
The infamous day itself was cold and miserable and Draco could feel the Dark Lord’s presence engraved into every wall and floorboard. It was stronger on the 25
Was he supposed to feel a fire of burning desire in his core? It had never felt like this before, so utterly exposed and protected. Harry’s lips were wide apart, offering everything he needed. Draco bit Harry’s bottom lip, propelled further when Harry released a tiny gasp, his fingers grabbling for Draco’s neck. The touch was hot against his skin, lighting alive every nerve.
There was a residue of magic that floated around the property; it must be the kind that recycled itself over and over in a desperate wait for the rightful owners to return. Harry was hardly the person the magic was expecting but it greeted him like an old friend. As he stared up at the property, a large gust of wind blew through the courtyard. It propped up tired tree spines, cleared the excess moss from the house’s exterior and rattled the windows in greeting.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn’t for Draco catching Fletcher’s equally unimpressed look from across the office in moments like these, he might have lost the will to continue a long time ago. He was a consultant, for Merlin’s sake; he was
Potter sighed. “What do you want me to tell you? You saw it for yourself; he has the development level of a young child, perhaps a five-year-old.”
They filed in, Fletcher taking the lead to place her files on the corner of Shacklebolt’s desk, and perched on his two guest chairs, feeling out of place.
As he curled up in his dorm, hundreds of metres above where he used to sleep, he thought he could still hear the gossiping.
The man stared at him, cocking his head to the side. He appeared to ponder it for a moment, then shook his head decisively.
“Potter, I haven’t worked out what you’re up to yet, but I highly recommend you carry out your schemes on your friends instead. You—"
Draco shook his head slowly and Fletcher did the same. The symbols still looked familiar, but there were hundreds of decryption spells he’d have to try to pinpoint the language being used. The theory he’d been taught at school was just the beginning. Runes from thousands of years ago could be traced back to specific branches of magic, each with their own complicated etymologies.
Although, the trees did indeed mark out an obvious shape, as he’d suspected. An equilateral triangle. Perhaps the group didn’t have as much magical ability as Draco had feared.
By the time they’d made it back to minibus, the sun was hanging precariously on the horizon, already hidden behind the thick forest which surrounded them.
His eyes were on Draco, trailing down his bare chest at an agonisingly slow pace, and he was taking slow steps towards the bed. The low-hanging sun was casting rich shades of gold and vibrant orange upon Harry’s body, dancing around his movements, illuminating him in a shimmer.
His threat fell upon deaf ears as the waiter approached with the bill and Draco busied himself with his robes, dismissing the implication of Potter’s words. Another promise.
“They seem to match the criteria.” Potter said, his tone a fraction stiffer than usual. “A large group of more than ten individuals, magical abilities, we’ve witnessed them carving runic symbols that likely match those at the crime scene, evidence that they’ve been living in the area for several weeks.”
Harry reached to touch the doorframe, fidgeting fingers following the cut of the wood. It softened at his touch.
Potter was on his doorstep, swaying dangerously close to the steps, his attention drawn to the few plants that dangled around the entrance. He looked heavily intoxicated: the shaking, the dazed expression, the smell.
“And yet he’s everything at the same time?” Ms Bixley remarked, scribbling on her notepad with one of those curious muggle contraptions. A pen – pointless, if you asked Draco. “I’d suggest you figure out
Malfoy not so discretely yanked the belt and inelegantly smashed it against the red mechanism until he heard a click.
And Harry folded his arms. He didn’t resist as Draco’s fingers curled around his forearm and pulled him gently. He let himself be led to Draco’s bed and complied without a word when Draco lifted the crumpled duvet, clambering in.
The surrounding buzz, the chatter of the few other occupants of the pub, consumed the air. If Draco had not been in his current company, he might even say it seemed like any other time at a pub: booze, laid back conversations, a natural ease. The sort of atmosphere that they didn’t belong in, not together.
It was promising when they only found one more point. Potter flailed his arms from a distance and beckoned them over to a narrow tree that had the same symbols engraved into the bark. He stood proudly besides his discovery, although his subtle smile quickly dissipated into a frown as Draco began muttering some quick diagnostic spells.
Draco was silently impressed. Perhaps those Diagon Alley vendors hadn’t been lying about Potter’s experience with extendable tents.
Something niggled at him though. It was like an itch tucked behind his ribs that he couldn’t scratch.
“Why is the sky blue?” That was a muggle expression that Draco had picked up recently, though he had not had an appropriate opening to use it. Honestly, Harry should be proud, but he only looked pissed off. And Draco backtracked. “Should I change who I am to satisfy your ideas of emotional stability?”
“These runes were on the tree. Do you recognise the script?” Draco asked, handing over the evidence. “It’s rather strange for them to be carved into a single tree. Magic rituals typically involve a specifically outlined area, where the incantation takes place.”
The comfortable quiet was easy to adjust to, Draco found, when Potter settled into his own work, scribbling away at paperwork. They didn’t say anything worthwhile, besides Potter offering to grab an extra coffee for him.
“Indeed.” Draco adjusted his crouched position slightly so he could stare better around the boulder and yanked his wand out from where it was lodged between their bodies. “I’ll see if I can match their magical signature to the remains that we found a few miles away.”
of sitting beside the Great Harry Potter, Draco noticed he had gained a significant social advantage when far fewer glares were tossed in his direction. The gazes shifted, instead, to Potter warily or with delight.
He’d managed to avoid spilling the detailed facts of last weekend’s work trips, which his mother considered personal enough to share (she was an avid fan of Fletcher), but Draco suspected he would not escape his mother’s carefully posed questions this time around. Perhaps, he would bring her some of that chocolate Fletcher adored. A simple bribe was never below a Malfoy.
“There’s actually a great pub around the corner, do you fancy grabbing a bite to eat?” Potter asked.
“Oh, oh!” Fletcher jumped on the spot before grabbing Draco’s wrist and yanking him towards the sun. “I think I saw these runes somewhere over here on an oak tree… where were they? Around here somewhere… aha!”
Her eyes swung casually around the room and paused when they fell upon Draco and dropped to Harry’s sleeping body. She stepped forward, her mouth opening, an accusatory expression on her face.
And before they knew it, Potter had been hanging around so long that Draco had begun to drop his t’s and brew enough for two cups of tea in the morning - all unbeknownst to himself.
On Thursday night, Potter beat him to the couch. It was two days until the Christmas holidays and Draco had admittedly fallen asleep in his bed for a few hours, who could blame him after an entire day of NEWTs preparation? He’d risen earlier in the morning too, in order to squeeze in a couple of extra hours in the library. Pansy had met him there, looking equally worse for wear, and they’d crawled through the regret and the textbooks until Breakfast.
Where would the fool have gone? To watch the camp, perhaps. What a dangerous idiot he would be, to go alone and swamped in darkness.
“I… don’t know,” Draco was the first to admit it. “But it felt old, that wasn’t magic from the modern world.”
Potter and Fletcher were probably laughing at his ridiculous behaviour as he walked. He was the sore thumb out of the trio, after all – oh
,” Draco answered quietly. He knew that Harry wouldn’t hear it in his sleepy state, but maybe it would plant the seed in his subconscious. “I want to get out of this bed.”
The sly bastard opened his eyes and tilted his head to look up at Draco. Merlin, he looked ethereal. The fire was casting shades of orange and amber and gold across his complexion; it lit his freckles alive. Draco couldn’t turn away.
Draco reluctantly pulled himself together for a spot of research, but he caught Potter leaving out the corner of his eye. He swore there was a light smile floating on Potter’s lips.
If nothing else, it was an ignorant bliss. They blocked out the world and its people, settling for each other’s company and touch and enlightened conversation.
“My point stands.” The left tip of Draco’s lips wavered, almost tipping into a smirk. “My father would be appalled at the company I keep.”
From the magical signatures they could detect, Draco and Fletcher had managed to pin down each individual’s age to a small range. Besides a couple of nineteen-year olds, the rest were easily in their twenties, thirties, and forties. Yet, when the sun dropped low enough for the routine afternoon nap, the younger (at heart) individuals crawled towards their senior counterparts so they could be wrapped within their arms and held for the duration. There was a form of dependence that Draco couldn’t ignore.
“Too late,” Potter said. He was probably smiling. He did ridiculous things like that: smiling at inappropriate times, acting all high and mighty, saving the world. “I’m not taking it back.”
Well, he watched POtter and his gentle breathing until the last embers in the fireplace had faded to black. By then it was too dark to skim the story in Draco’s book and his wand was trapped within his robes, so Draco made do without magic or light. He tipped his head backwards and closed his eyes, hoping for a dreamless sleep.
Fletcher ran into the office at approximately 16:34 on Tuesday and slapped the tracking map onto Potter’s desk.
“This will be a sensitive case, I’ll warn you. It may take several months to dismantle the group, if needed, and gather the required evidence.” Shacklebolt grimaced slightly, “I have no doubt you three are capable of closing the case.”
“The dark circles and the late-night stargazing would suggest otherwise.” Draco continued and even in his tired state, a sneer came to settle on his expression. “Forgive me for asking an obvious question.”
It was those glasses, they were unsuited to the new mature face that their precious saviour had grown into sometime after the war - somewhere in the space of time between saving Draco from an excruciating existence behind cold, unforgiving bars and Draco’s recruitment at the Ministry. Potter really ought to invest in another pair of glasses; maybe then he wouldn’t remind Draco so much of the war-torn kid he saw lying in Hagrid’s arms. Maybe then, he wouldn’t look so chillingly young after all these years.
Draco looked across at him, finding light amusement dancing across Potter’s stretched lips and the scattering of freckles.
The hours ticked by and Fletcher’s shoulder became a steady source of heat as the temperature plunged in the late afternoon. They watched the group, Fletcher played with her tracking spells, Draco brooded over Potter’s words, over his body.
Fortunately, the window into the room was discrete enough that the interviewee wouldn’t notice them peering through. So, Draco stood there, Fletcher on his left, and they watched as Potter tentatively greeted Arthur Griffin, offering a kind smile.
“Do you really have no one who can come and get you?” Draco asked, leaning against the wall. “Granger, Weasley, Finnigan?”
Draco watched as the smile faded once Potter settled behind his faraway desk. Through the amicable chatter of the office, his eyes flickered up to meet Draco’s. They moved away.
That night, Potter joined Draco on the couch again, ignoring Draco’s (ultimately harmless) glaring, and wiggled his way into the same spot. He left his glasses on the neighbouring table and rubbed his eyes as a blanket floated across the common room to sprawl against Potter. It missed the tips of his feet though, Potter’s toes wiggling in the cold before they slipped under the blanket. Draco shifted his gaze to his book.
“Potter,” Draco said, clearing his throat and busying himself with a cup of tea of his own, “I see you survived the night.”
It took a long moment for Draco to catch up and then he had to pause, contemplate honesty, and say, “Well, I don’t like my colleagues or the institution, but yes, I suppose. It pays the bills.”
The bedframe released a heavy groan when Harry clambered onto his knees at the far end of the bed, his (once again) overgrown hair draped across his forehead, eyes locked on Draco. In a gradual, casual crawl, Harry made his way towards Draco. His gaze was heavy, piercing and emerald. Draco’s mouth ran dry.
” He hissed under his breath, before snapping, “Shut the fuck up, Fletcher. Put your childish delusions to bed and focus on your job.”
Those sparkling emerald eyes waited expectantly; they offered a sense of safety and trust. It may all be a deception, but they were patient.
magazine‘s Sexiest Wizard award claimed to work out. The safe conclusion to draw was that a body like Potter’s couldn’t be sculpted to such definition without intense work. In fact, Draco had been quite surprised Potter hadn’t snagged the top spot for the fourth year running, when he scooped up his annual copy. Draco’s fingers twitched.
It took a small transfiguration of the sofa, another glass of water on the coffee table and the removal of Draco’s wine bottle. Potter was climbing into bed when Draco left the room, not looking back. He certainly didn’t look back to see Potter’s drowsy face as it settled against a cushion, gaze drifting slowly across the ceiling, nor to catch the small flick of Potter’s wand as the lights flickered off.
“Hello, mister.” A man in his early twenties approached Draco. He looked around the same age, dark skin imbedded with soil and a splatter of blood on the corner of his lips. His black hair grazed his shoulders, looking unwashed and uncombed. Dressed in the same thin robes of the campmates, Draco knew there was no denying this man belonged to the cult.
It was peculiar, this silence between him and Potter as they shared a confined space. The only other instance that matched these circumstances was those late nights they both sometimes spent in the office, poring over their individual work at the opposite ends of the room. Neither ever spoke. Draco nearly always left first, prioritising his sleep over whatever overtime wage he might be paid at the end of the month.
“Here,” Potter held out a portkey in the form of a kettle once they were back at the minibus. “The same settings as last time.”
Fletcher and Draco shared a brief, amused look and followed. The office was shiny and well-polished, only the carpet muddy from the many pairs of boots that must have stomped through. There were a set of chairs by the door, a stack of typical magazines piled on the adjacent table, and a large desk at the opposite end of the room. Two women were sat behind it, flicking their wands to sort the mail and files from one pile to another.
It looked a little different now. Draco noticed that the air was completely still here, he lifted his eyes and noticed that nothing was moving. The forest was cowering away from the clearing, creating a sturdy barricade of branches and leaves. In an instant of realisation, Draco recognised that chilling feeling he felt. Dark magic. The Killing Curse. He shivered.
Potter’s head popped around the door, a subtle source of warmth returned, originating somewhere in Draco’s chest.
Fletcher had no qualms about their method of transport; she had integrated herself into London’s muggle society almost immediately after the war and was probably as adept with these mechanical monsters as she was with the awful Tube.
There wasn’t much to observe. The younger half of the group was playing a long-winded game of hide and seek, tucking their narrow bodies behind tree trunks and thick bushes, with delirious happiness. Something about the situation nagged on Draco. He had no right to judge how teenagers and twenty-somethings ought to act, and yet, there was an obvious conclusion his mind couldn’t quite drag into the light.
It ought to be noted that they were wasting their own weekend and the department’s resources, at this point. These surveillance sessions were not fruitful, and their supposed work wasn’t worth a single Knut of the overtime they were claiming.
“Oh,” Potter’s face fell in disappointment, looking like the child he had once been, but it soon perked back up. “Yeah, but he wanted to sort out the few Aurors they had left first, and he’d just kinda got… stuck there.”
“You were worried about him, about Harry.” She smiled mischievously, ignoring his words, leaning forward on her elbows. “Weren’t you?”
“Have you checked whether ley lines cross under the forests?” Potter asked, his voice so close that a breath seemed to graze Draco’s cheek. That wasn’t the only thing that made him pause.
“No, I didn’t, Draco…” Fletcher drawled, rearranging the files she clutched against her chest. “I don’t pay as much attention to Harry as you do.”
Potter narrowed his eyes slightly, casually switching the minibus’ engine back on with a loud rumble, and moved his hands to settle at the top of the steering wheel. Intent on avoiding the implication of that gaze, Draco shifted his attention to the long fingers that wrapped around the wheel and fidgeted from left to right.
Several hours were spent ransacking the surrounding perimeter for any dormant traces of magic that might just offer a clue to the group’s location. Nothing was found, besides a few mangled rabbits in the hollow of a tree and a faint smell of blood that was probably emanating from the rabbits.
So, lockdown life got in the way and then I binged "The Bold Type" on Netflix, but I eventually finalised this chapter. I'm also toying with a theme to stick into the fic when I do a huge edit at the end, but I don't know if I can pull it off. It revolves around this one line that stuck with me: "Did anyone have Potter and Malfoy become cordial colleagues on their post-war bingo cards?", but we'll see!
“For now then, we should assume they’ve remained within the same area.” Potter said, pulling off his outer robes to reveal denim jeans and a scruffy (and perhaps unwashed) t-shirt. Hardly the professionalism Shacklebolt had insisted; Draco and Fletcher both wore full suits beneath their robes, although Draco’s was more noticeably tailored.
Harry's gaze followed his, widening as though he’d forgotten the clusters of lovestruck fans that had been watching them fly for the past hour. He swallowed heavily, turning back to Draco. “Let’s go, they’ve had their fair share of my private life for a century.”
Harry walked across the stony driveway. The house shook itself off with each step that brought him closer. It straightened up from its hunched posture, its weeds shrinking back between the paving stones and the crack in the upper window sealing itself.
It took another minute to coax Griffin into settling down in a chair to answer a few questions. Once he had, he shifted his limbs around in discomfort, as though they were too long and unfamiliar, and made a pointed effort not to meet Potter’s eyes.
Without thinking, his fingers reached for the closest image - stretching closer and closer to his family. Gone or not, they were his.
The three of them walked deeper and deeper into the forest, along a lightly marked path that had been moulded by footfall. The trees grew taller and wilder, the roots were stuck out of the ground at awkward angles as they looped back to the trunks. Draco stepped through it all, glad to be wearing the most durable pair of boots he owned.
“This is a recon mission, Malfoy. We are not risking the entire investigation.” Potter hissed, a hand on Draco’s shoulder to pull him sharply back against something hard, against Potter’s chest. “And we are definitely
Draco made his way around the house at his own pace, standing in doorways - his tremendous height bringing his head almost to the door frames. Occasionally adjusting his coat, he swept through each room, before finally finding Harry in the kitchen once again.
He rightfully deserved the deadly glare Fletcher shot at him. But she groaned, and under Potter’s peaked interest, she recounted the latest incident of many which ultimately led to her last relationship’s destabilisation.
He was sick of hiding and staying silent and dodging disgusted glances of fellow students. He was tired of being holed up in classrooms and his dorm room, never staying anywhere else for more than a fleeting moment. It wasn’t much but at 1 am, after he listened to the rest of the Eighth Years wander to bed, he slipped out of his room and tiptoed down the stairs to peer into the common room. It was empty, just as he liked it.
True to his word, Potter dedicated the entire waking morning to research. They perched around the two desks, having transfigured the sofa into an additional chair, and pored over the texts Fletcher had brought. She seemed to have borrowed half of the Ministry’s archive. The texts ranged from case files on previous dark groups (Malfoy claimed the Death Eater file) to the largest encyclopaedia of ancient runes to a selection of muggle books on the psychology of criminals.
It wasn’t even a Weasley-made jumper. No - Harry had raided Sirius’ closet in 12 Grimmauld Place a while after the trials, once he’d gathered enough courage to step through that arching doorway once more. Amongst the few items of clothing that remained from Sirius’ adolescence and his short-lived bout of freedom, Harry found various sweaters that resembled Lupin’s taste more than his godfather’s. Either way, they’d become natural additions to Harry’s closet and hadn’t moved since.
The touch disappeared and Potter began to walk towards the neighbouring shop. Draco snapped to attention and looked quickly from the handle to Potter.
The next words came from Potter. Draco whipped his gaze towards him to catch them as Potter said the simplest of responses.
“That cashier was a judgemental cow, he kept staring at my hair like I was a teenage delinquent. I’m twenty-five fucking years old – oh, sorry, Harry. Language.” She leant forward and through the gap in the front seats. “Here’s your change, and the receipt.”
“Hey, Juniper. Can you go pay?” Potter asked, holding a few flaps of thin paper over his shoulder. “It’s pump number five. You can grab some snacks if you like. Oh, and remember to grab the receipt!”
“We should head back. I need to catch Kingsley before he leaves.” Potter said, looking across at him.
The man was far more senior in age, a head full of thin, greying hair that sat without style or effort, and his body language indicated he was anxious, Draco could tell by the way he kept glancing over his shoulder in anticipation. Perhaps, it was fear. Either way, Mr Griffin was slim, his skin worryingly pale, his face taut and pulled tight. He was dressed in a set of red pyjamas, small images of what appeared to be trains printed from top to bottom, and he was playing with a pair of toy cars on the floor, cross-legged. He was the picture of childlike innocence.
Fletcher released a pent-up exhale from beside him, sensing the tension dissipating out of the room in a swift gush. Potter dropped his wand and turned away; Draco chose to believe he was hiding a stupid grin. When he returned, he only cast a worn-out look at Draco and slumped back onto the sofa.
“Will you join us?” Harry said once he reached them and Pansy looked behind them. Her expression returned in confusion once she realised Potter meant the pair of them. “Draco? You too, Pansy, of course – if you like.”
When they slumped back to the minibus at sunset, the silence was soaked in exhaustion. Draco was overwhelmed with the urge to apparate back home and crawl into his mother’s bed. He hadn’t seen her in two days, it felt far too long.
Draco’s mother was waiting outside the building, hidden in the shadows. She embraced him, tugging at his cheeks and uttering something about how thin he was getting. Draco bought her a coffee and a slice of cake in a muggle cafe, feeling surprisingly less bitter about wizarding cafes refusing to serve them – it certainly helped when the cashier smiled at him and made light-hearted conversation about his namesake. His mother watched him curiously.
Potter’s eyes waited, a hand on the wheel. His body was pointed towards Draco. Was that anticipation Draco sensed in his body language?
in from Central London. Why the flying f-f-flobberworm didn’t you pick us up from the Ministry headquarters?”
at this hour?” Draco pushed off the door and strode the extra few feet to the periphery of their warding.
Draco tucked himself up on the sofa with a glass of wine once he’d locked the door and slumped against it for a moment, processing.
So, he emerged from the bathroom and waited for them to eat, to change, and get a move on. He slipped a banana and an apple, that Potter had acquired from a questionable source, into his pocket as they left to continue their investigation.
They were led to a small room, large enough to fit a few chairs around a desk and a tea trolley. It was adjoined to another room that was much more spacious, a small window offering an internal observation point. Through it, Draco could see Arthur Griffin.
Then, Harry disappeared through the same entrance that they’d entered. Draco grabbed the air where he’d been a moment before. His dejected hand flew to his lips, tracing the imprint of pink lips on his. He caught his breath.
Narcissa’s death had made Page 3 for a day, before dropping off the public’s radar. The funeral itself wasn’t even publicised, not that anybody was eager to attend the memorial of a deceased Death Eater. Granger and Weasley showed up regardless, acting out their short display of sympathy. Harry sat with them for the duration since their relationship was still somewhat secret, at least from the press.
”Jesus Bloody Christ…” Harry raked a hand through his hair, searching for a way to deescalate the situation, to bring Draco back down from his illogical height. No ideas seemed to spring to mind.
Then it vanished from his lips, withdrawing. Draco opened his eyes, the fingers around his neck sliding to settle at his chest.
“Does this mean I can make weekend plans going forth?” Draco asked lightly, he might have even described it as a teasing tone.
He quickly followed behind Fletcher as they crossed the road and ambled into the thick forest that met them on the road’s edge. Potter trudged straight into it as though it was his day job – actually, Draco supposed it was. Unless the Aurors were privileged to be under Draco’s guidance, they often wandered into the unknown and got themselves hurt. Potter seemed to have the worst track record of them all.
“Do you need a guide?” Potter was staring at the road now as he tugged the vehicle back into the steady flow of traffic.
Then, they were trundling into Dartmoor National Park and Draco was overcome with relief. He couldn’t wait to step out of this death trap and find his land legs again.
“Draco, look, I don’t know if this is going to work, but you have to stop fighting it,” Harry was saying, “Because I want it to work. I want you mentioned on every page of my bloody biography. And for some unknown reason, maybe by the hand of a muggle’s god,
Arthur Griffin had been in residential care for five months, following a sudden appearance on the main street of Princetown in ill-fitting clothes, a wild look to him, and then a subsequent stint in St Mungo’s. No family had appeared to visit nor look after him.
Satisfied with the compromise, Fletcher nodded and smiled to herself. This only opened a hundred other possibilities in the case’s solution for her. Fletcher was often a nightmare to work with, especially when all the puzzle pieces of a long case started slotting into their rightful place. She became intensely unreserved about her opinion and theories. A few interns had been spotted literally running away from a case meeting with her. Draco had the advantage of being a friend, but he could still expect to be prodded several times an hour with new links she’d made. Fletcher wouldn’t stop until she sussed out the intricacies of this cult.
Draco tried to concentrate on rifling through his mind, stretching for the mental case file that floated out of his grasp. Something was happening, surely. A niggling feeling in his chest told him that much.
There was quiet once more – aside from the rowdy game of tag the younger camp members were playing below.
When he turned up to the case 341 office on Thursday morning, there was an empty jam jar and a note. Draco frowned and picked up the latter. It read a simple,
Fletcher shook Draco awake at around 10am, risking her own decapitation, and less than an hour later, the three of them were crouched in the same hillside spot, peering down at the group of suspects. Besides the childlike mannerisms they’d discussed in detail already, nothing remarkable was worth observing.
Another night wasted alone. He’d be tucking himself into bed soon; oh, what a thrilling life he led.
She accompanied him to Kings Cross at the end of the holidays, stopping at the entrance to kiss his cheeks and pull him into her arms. She smiled apologetically as he headed in alone, looking back. Pansy filled in for her absence, slipping into stride beside him.
It was all over the school by lunch. For that reason, amongst many of his usual reasons, Draco avoided the Great Hall. He endured his classes. They were manageable, despite the whispering and Granger’s gaze on his back.
So, he waited for his colleagues to return. They did, miraculously not having procured another form of transport, and carried armfuls of packaged food. Potter struggled to pull the door open, but once he did, the pile was deposited next to Draco.
Potter’s eyes shifted to them, looking remarkably less tired, and he smiled warmly. Fuck, Draco had almost forgotten about the blasted smile.
“Draco?” He said softly and Draco didn’t know how he’d lasted two weeks without the sound of Potter’s voice. He had taken his glasses off, his gaze fixed on Draco’s arm. “You’d make an excellent pillow.”
Fletcher fell asleep around about the time they passed Yeovil, her copy of the magazine slumped against her chest. She looked innocent, like that. Hardly capable of a complex deterioration curse. Then again, Draco supposed even the Dark Lord would look harmless when he slept – did the creature even sleep? For a long year, it seemed like he never stopped to rest, never needed rest, not until the last hours of his second life.
. The warmth seemed to linger on his lips. And he had spent his evening trying to keep his hands by his sides, since far too often he had found them grazing his lips. He wanted to know the bumps and ridges of Harry’s lips as well as he knew his own from today alone.
Potter’s eyes flicked between them as Fletcher subsequently suggested a light-hearted bet instead. Draco would get his precious fancy dinner and Fletcher would be given a single secret if he failed in his task – in his
Potter’s chest heaved as he retched again, audibly swallowing the rising contents of his stomach. They made it to the bathroom after a few more pushes, and Draco lowered him onto the cold, tiled floor, besides the toilet. His heavy body sunk against the solid surface, his biceps tensing beneath Draco’s touch, and he heaved a gasp.
“Liar,” Draco muttered under his breath as he pulled his arms tighter against his chest and slumped a little further against his window.
He dropped his book to the floor after a few minutes of feigned interest and pulled his own blanket to his chin, casting his eyes warily to Potter. Surely a few hours wouldn’t do any harm. Potter never woke anyway. Draco would be gone by the time he rose. Reassured by his own fatigued logic, Draco curled into his corner and let his eyes flutter closed. Sleep didn’t usually come easily, haunted by twisted visions and nasty thoughts, but Draco drifted toward it. It beckoned him, singing a gentle lullaby. He exhaled.
Draco gave up at around 11 pm and got ready for bed in the adjoining bathroom where the front seats had been. He slipped into the far bed, reading a few chapters of his novel until Fletcher joined him in the neighbouring bed, still nibbling on some crumbly snack. The lights were dimmed by Potter, but he didn’t move – remaining on the couch, fidgeting, and staring into oblivion.
“Is that all I am to the great Harry Potter?” Draco mused through his smile, spinning Harry back around in his arms so they were resting chest to back once more. “A reliable, first-class booty call?”
Draco cast a quick stinging hex to her exposed calf, all he could reach at this angle, and took satisfaction in the muffled scream she released. He’d been waiting the entire week for the opportunity.
By the time that the sun hung low in the sky, the three of them agreed to give up for the day. It was growing dark and with limited visibility, Potter explained, they were open to attack. It was too risky. Potter said that a lot – always going on about risk, as though he didn’t spend an entire war making stupidly risky decisions that relied entirely on luck being on his side. It had been, of course. Because he was Harry fucking Potter, the boy extraordinaire.
“That’s good. It feels like everybody in the damn office is thrilled to be there so—” Draco stopped himself from correcting that statement to
“Perhaps not… Potter!” Draco shouted through the woods and the Auror appeared from behind a distant tree with a deep-set frown. “We’ve found something.”
Draco watched them with an unimpressed expression. What even was this place? Some kind of refuelling station, he could guess. Muggles clearly weren’t that smart if they couldn’t invent a piece of transport technology that didn’t require a fuel source yet.
Potter was nodding, Draco was vaguely aware of that fact, and was probably saying something to accept the apology in a noble fashion. He, meanwhile, was entirely focused on reining in his severe case of blushing. Not much availed, he kept his gaze on his porridge as Pansy made small talk. Granger asked them stilted questions and Draco provided pained answers. Harry’s foot bumped into his every once in a while, and he’d throw fleeting glances, but Draco stayed still.
Fletcher spotted the group another three miles downstream and silently pointed through the trees. The three of them carefully treaded around the camp’s perimeter, in sought of the best surveillance point, and settled in a slightly heighted area that still had direct oversight to the group.
Draco pulled him closer until his hair tickled Draco’s neck and his body didn’t end where Draco’s began. The covers tugged themselves free from beneath them, only to lay across the two men. It became their personal bubble of warmth and safety, and the sunlight danced across the ceiling for Draco as he pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
With quiet steps, Draco walked closer until his chest met Harry’s back and he could wrap his arms around Harry’s shoulders. And as the garden sprung into its full glory, a small water fountain uncovering itself in the very rear, Harry fell back into Draco’s hold. A small set of quidditch hoops were uncloaked, looking worse for wear. Harry seemed to falter, before his chest resumed its normal rise and fall.
That were not addressed to the person who uttered a quiet response, their words whispered across the dark room,
sign, a quick stumble back to Draco’s flat upstairs, hours of kissing and movement and drowsy talking. No doubts or hesitation, only arms wrapped around shoulders and waists and warmth between bare stomachs and the hum of Potter's voice against Draco’s neck.
They watched quietly for a further six minutes as the two cult members completed the carvings and double-checked their work.
She shook her head. “Not that I am aware of. The reception said we’d be debriefed before the interview anyway.”
The wards bristled as Harry stepped through the iron-wrought gates into a large courtyard. They tickled his skin, sensing him to be the rightful owner of the property. A scattering of autumnal leaves danced around his legs as the feeling blossomed into a warm wave of energy wrapping around his body.
To make up for her earlier mistakes, Fletcher came ambling back into earshot, a twig tucked neatly behind her ear. Draco was thankful for the interruption.
“Don’t be a fool, Fletcher. We were talking about work.” Draco answered, flipping the page. “Need I remind you that this is a
It had been more than six months since Draco had found somewhere safe to sleep. Even still, he never slept well. But he nodded again and watched Potter leave. Always leaving. Why did everyone have to leave?
They were drawing closer. Harry’s hand was curling around to Draco’s back now, his body marginally closer. And Draco woke up each time far closer to Harry than when sleep had beckoned.
There was a short silence, as Shacklebolt mulled over his thoughts and pushed off his desk to pace up and down the width of his office.
They stared up at the two apparent leaders for instruction, often cross-legged on the floor with fidgeting fingers. They threw tantrums and stomped their boots on the ground or wailed until they received the inevitable life lesson that they’d only be ignored.
A weird clunk noise knocked through the car and Draco gripped the seat, looking quickly around to find the source. He could see Potter at the rear of the vehicle, staring meaningfully at the side of the minibus, and there was some sort of whoosh from whatever he was playing at. Perhaps, he was feeding the vehicle explosives and it would spontaneously combust before they even reached Devon. Perhaps, it was harmless.
“Is that so?” Draco drawled, glancing around his kitchen – that was sparkling, no doubt, but nothing phenomenal – and through the doorway towards the soft, morning glow of his kitchen.
“Good afternoon,” Draco responded, a cool grace about him (or so he hoped). He wouldn’t dare admit it to anybody, least of all Harry, but his boyfriend’s friends did scare him a little. They did collectively defeat the Dark Lord, after all. If
The store remained always open and Potter had continued sitting there all day, his fingers intertwining with Draco’s beneath the table, waiting for closure when he’d pounce (if not earlier).
. And so, Draco followed his father’s lead and holed up in his own room for most of the day. His gift had been requested by himself in the days prior so there was no remarkable excitement there.
what he got her! Although the necklace wasn’t tacky, he spent nearly all his savings on that necklace. He didn’t even get me a bloody gift.” Harry swayed slightly as he walked, his head tilted up to the clouds as he smiled. “I guess that’s what happens when you love someone – you would spend all your money just to make them smile for a moment.”
Harry smiled and in one quick movement, his lips pressed against Draco’s. They were soft and warm and chapped from the winter air and… gone. They were gone before Draco could even close his eyes. Harry’s lips said something.
He traced each photo with his gaze, seeing his dad in a new light with each frame, finding his grandparents in the fragments of life left behind. They seemed to smile right at him, from behind the veil, their kind eyes looking into his, before their portraits reset and their eyes shifted away.
It was an unsettling idea really – to sleep in the same room as Potter and leave himself vulnerable in such a state – but Draco had long ago given up being afraid of the inevitable. If Potter was to attack him, Draco probably wouldn’t even fight it. He’d lie there and not make a sound.
Resisting the urge to roll his eyes, it took all the strength Draco had to smile sweetly and nod. “You’re concerned after three weeks? Do you really not trust Harry’s judgement? I’m sure he can alleviate your worries.”
“I’m never going to be this perfect partner that you expect, that the whole fucking world expects. I’m a bloody Malfoy, and you! You’re the golden boy.” Draco yelled, “That’s our destiny, not some star-crossed love bound to fail! When this is all over, I won’t be any more than a page in the record-breaking, sold-out biography of the Boy Who Lived.”
He had glided silently across the room before he was aware of his body moving and he opened the door. It threatened him with a low creak but ultimately revealed Harry, looking dishevelled and wearing those ridiculous yellow pyjama bottoms. He stepped into the stairwell.
In tune with an English spring, the afternoon was bitter. Swirling above, the clouds offered nothing but light drizzles of rain, woven with freezing winds that nipped at Draco’s skin. They huddled beneath a tree on top of the hillside, shelter charms cast strategically above as to not leave any noticeably dry patches.
Fletcher cast warming charms when the late spring air tossed a bitterly cold wind in their direction. They’d been lucky so far, well-endowed with enough sun to keep them comfortable. The heavy flock of dark clouds being blown east suggested that wouldn’t last any longer.
His brow was furrowed in concentration, so Draco didn’t say a word a further; he’d rather Potter get the charm spot on, so that the interior didn’t collapse inwards during the night, than provide a snarky comment.
“Potter?” Draco whispered. His book had fallen into the side of the sofa, sinking into the crevasse with no hope of rescue. It was one of his favourites, but he let it fall. Potter wasn’t reacting. “Hey, Potter! Hey.
Harry’s cheeks flushed pink, he adjusted his position to better lean against Draco and nodded. “Yeah, er, I’ve never slept better.”
“No!” Draco strode across the room and knocked the pan out of Fletcher’s clutches. “I can cook tonight.”
Fletcher read despite the darkness, a small orb of light on the tip of her wand illuminating the words of the latest Quibbler. She occasionally made a comment on a delightfully misguided article, laughing under her breath as she read out the headlines or simply stating “Oh, they got halfway there on this one!”. Draco glanced back when there was a particularly pointed sigh, the kind he associated with Fletcher stumbling across a picture of Luna Lovegood.
The patronus fizzled out, dropping to the floor in an array of emerald sparks, as Draco’s knees gave way and he sank to the rug. Pain flooded his body, a torture beyond control, without end.
Potter enlarged the map and they both squinted at it, trying to memorise the exact location – give or take 150 yards. As per his previous suggestion, Draco strained his mind trying to recall whether any ley lines ran through the Peak District. It was a large enough area; it was entirely possible. The Dartmoor forest likely overlapped with the St Michael’s line or at least was positioned within a close enough distance to fit into this working theory. Draco had no idea whether Hargate Forest fit.
“Definitely the front,” Draco repeated, watching as Potter slid that door closed, and he walked around to the other side of the ‘
The moment they appeared in the Ministry’s questionable entrance choice of a public toilet, they turned on the spot. Potter’s body was pressed to his as the world submerged into total darkness, if but for a moment. It was familiar, yet new; him and Potter, flying through the dark.
“You will not use me as such, Potter,” Draco replied firmly, propping his book at a sharper angle on his legs. Draco eyed Potter and jerked his body as close to the edge of the sofa as possible. It was helpless though, the saggy sofa was determined to slump them together.
His mother was noticeably concerned for his sanity and confused when Draco had asked. She couldn’t understand, even once he’d explained in the only terms that he understood it. Even still, she sought out the very best for her son and three days after Christmas, Draco had his first appointment with the only wizarding therapist in the country. It wasn’t a fruitful business, he heard, it was a so-called muggle occupation, after all. But his mother had heard from a friend of a client of theirs that the service was not only remarkable but might just spark the next wizarding fad.
So, Harry wasted the afternoon away in Draco’s arms, the hours ticking past in their own little space. And he loved every inch of Draco against him, and every second.
Draco reminded himself of that simple fact as the man himself came sauntering into the office. He might as well have been carrying the decapitated head of the next evil tyrant, for the entire office jumped to its feet with a raucous cheer. Even the bloody portraits were saluting Potter. Draco scowled.
“Before that! And afterwards, as a matter of fact.” She pushed, eyes shining. “You care about Harry. Don’t try to deny it!”
The darkness flocked the streets after half an hour of driving, except for the tall lamps that dangled above and the almost-blinding lights that shone out of other vehicles. Fletcher hadn’t made an awful choice with the music, likely taking Draco’s preferences into consideration when she chose the radio station, even if it kept repeating its name. BBC Radio 2 was hardly the worst, it didn’t have any excessively loud or inappropriate music for a Sunday evening and maintained the calm atmosphere he’d been seeking. So, Draco didn’t voice any complaints.
“Just give me another hour of peace. All right?” Potter’s voice was faint, weary and got lost on its way to Draco.
“Except they do, Harry. They prod and they poke until the worst in people are revealed, until they find dirty secrets and the ugly truth, then they publish it on their fucking front pages!” Draco shouted, whirling on the spot to grab the latest copy of Witch’s Weekly that Mrs Weasley had left behind, and stabbed the front cover of their faces. “And they’re not wrong! Just like the papers say, I’m unpredictable and evil! I’m unhinged, unstable, and
“What’s wrong, Potter? Are you only talented at combat? Do you miss trading curses with the scum of the earth?” Draco sniped, rolling his eyes. “Our precious saviour is overrated, dearest Fletcher.”
“Go on, tell me about your day,” Harry said, looking rather pleased with himself that he’d successfully cut Draco off with only so much as a glare in response. “I dare you.”
His tone wasn’t challenging. The words were posed as a straight-forward question that hoped for a straight-forward answer. Draco reached for the necklace that was buried beneath his clothes, the one belonging to his mother. He thought of her kindness, how it still existed for him. She could never be a monster in his eyes, and he never in hers. They still had love. So, people like him?
“Nothing of interest. It seemed like he could remember segments of living in the woods, but nothing more.” Potter scratched his neck. “He doesn’t know why he left, he only remembers the hospital.”
“I’m only saying… I’d wager that Saviour title gives you certain privileges, slacking on the job for instance. Kingsley loves to use you as his little useless, shining poster boy.”
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said in return, eyes scouring every inch of the walls for a history that nobody ever had the chance to tell him. His hand reached back, another soft hand sliding into it and squeezing it tight. “Don’t you think so?”
“I’m here, I’ve got you, okay? Let it all out.” Came the distant voice and warm touch, “You can hold onto me.”
, he was not going to fall into the habit of calling them ‘the trio’ again. That came with the implication of friendship and—
Potter appeared another ten minutes later, evidently having attending that briefing with Kingsley. Dark rings hung below his eyes as he hesitated in the doorway, clearly taking the time to fix a bright smile to his lips, before he stepped through, rowdily greeting some of his closer co-workers.
