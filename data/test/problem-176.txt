"How about tonight." He said, more of a command than a question.
"That's called having fun. You should try it sometime." I said.
I saw Harry got hit and quickly ran to him as the minister came in taking the deathesters.
"He is already mine. Try to take him again and-" I tired to warn, but was cut off by Harry.
"The trunk. In his room," Harry said.
"Morning. I wish we had a bigger tent. Or our own." Ron said.
"I'm aroused." He said and moved uncomfortablely.
"Where did she come from?" Ron whispered.
"He did not do anything. He actually made me a little better." I said.
"This is important Harry. You should really start learning things before doing anything with Malfoy. You kind of had to accept, but still." She scolded and everyone agreed with her.
"Parcel what?" Harry said.
I then heard the living room door. Open and close and I was called down stairs.
"What exactly did you two do?" Hermione asked.
Ron blushed and said, "well. I'll be toping next time. But you took Harry's innocence."
Hermione asked. Blaise came over. "Why do I never know whats going on with you four?" Blaise said.
"I am fine." He said when he pulled away. He then held up his hand and I noticed the snitch. "Plus I win." He added.
"I love you Harry." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
"Well, he said it's cause he is a werewolf and it's not the same as beingÂ a vampire," Harry said cuddling into me.
Dear Harry,
Mason smiled and said, "I really am proud of you Harry. You deserve happiness."
"I'm fine. Just. A little uncomfortable." He said and moved again.
I sat at the Slytherin table and Harry at the Gryffindor's. I don't like Lupin. He smells like a wet dog. I should talk to Severus. When we finished we went to our dorms and I fell asleep needing rest.
When we got to what Ron calls 'The Burrow', we got out of the car and snuck inside.
So we both got up and showered. We put our clothes back on. We went into the living room and saw our friends sitting there.
He then screamed and ran to me. "What's wrong Harry?" I asked.
"How is he so amazing. He wasn't even able to heal my broken arm." Harry said, rolling his eyes in exasperation.
"Isn't the normal getting in trouble?" Ron said.
Draco p.o.v
"Oh. Poor Scabbers." I said and pet his head.
"Draco. If I asked you to call me a girl when I felt like one. Would you?" He asked.
"Even if we did not hear a thing I would have known. Your sent have changed slightly." Remus said glaring at me.
"Hey Harry I'm head boy this year." Draco said.
We said good morning and began eating. Then the owl post came. On the daily prophet, the front page has me and Draco hugging and kissing on a loop.
The next day we took a shower together. Only taking a shower nothing more. Then went to the great Hall to breakfast. Out friends already there.
"I'm sorry, but you are so cuddly." I said as we walked into the kitchen.
"We are sorry. But. We are going to defeat he who shall not be named." Draco said determination written across his face.
I took a good look around the room and noticed that there are pictures of the unforgivable curses.
"What are we going to do now Draco?" Harry asked.
"Yes. I'll say that was the most strangest thing I saw." He said.
"So what do you think we should do to Ginny?" Blaise asked.
Harry p.o.v
"I'll never tell you." I said with as much anger in my voice as I can.
Once we got to the ministry I led them to the department of mistry.
"Oh good you have your letters. I guess we will need to go back to Diagon ally to get your supplies." Mrs Malfoy said.
Draco p.o.v
"What happened?" Harry asked.
He frowned, then leant up, and kissed me.
"Yes, harry?" I asked, holding him and running my fingers through his hair.
They played five games, Draco winning three Ron winning two. "I can't belive you were able to beat me. I swear you were cheating." Ron said.
"But I don't want to." Draco replied.
"It was not safe with us." Harry said laughing as we have goodbye.
We stood up. "Where is Wormtail?" Harry asked.
I licked Harry's lip asking for entrance wich he allowed.
He took off his pants, leaving on his boxers. I looked, then gave him a healing potion.
Harry's P.O.V.*
A even slower song came on, so Harry wrapped his arms around my neck and I wrapped my arms around his waist. I pulled him closer and he rested his head on my chest and I rested mine on his shoulder. We swayed side to side and Harry actually started to hum the song. "You enjoying yourself Harry?" I asked.
Me and Harry laid next to each other cuddling. I kissed his cheek and got up telling him I'm going to draw us a bath. He nodded and cuddled a pillow that I use.
"I love you to." I said, tiredly.
I was about to say something but our friends showed up.
"Night Draco. Love you." I said.
"Did you say thank you?" Draco asked and I nodded. "You were still speaking in snake." He added.
Then Pansy and Hermione came over. "Hello ladies." I said.
In the end, he asked me what i thought. He then told me, that from the beginning Voldemort would try to scare people into following him, and asked me to come back tomorrow.
He laughed and got out of my grasp, turning around to face me. "I slept great. How about you?" Harry smiled.
"There is to many of them. Plus you have snow." I said.
"I wonder what that means." Draco said thoughtfully.
"Now class the spell to stop the boggart is Riddikulus." He said.
So I took it off for him and his arms and chest are littered with cuts. "Did you keep what you ate?" I asked and he shook his head.
"It's fine. You tell just need to stop being oblivious." Hermione said.
"Okay. My girl. What ever. Plus PDA means 'Public Displays of Affection.' As in cuddling counts." Pansy said.
After we bought all the stuff we need we went and ate ice cream.
"So Harry how do you like the manor?" Mom asked as we sat down.
I practically flew through the fire place and landed somewhere. I looked at my glasses and saw a crack in the glass.
So I pulled away and licked the wound healing it, then I grabbed my wand and cast silancing charms on the curtains. "Now we can be as loud as we want." I said smirking.
"Harry please listen. I don't think Mad-Eye is a good person. Plus no teacher should show students those curses." Draco said.
I'm guessing I should have took my potion this morning.
"Mm. Draco. Faster!" I said, grabbing his hips.
"Why are you sending me love letters and stuff?" I asked.
I used my vampire power to understand animals and said, "Could you repeat that please?"
"And you better make sure Harry stays safe and good Draco." Pansy said.
Harry p.o.v
"You are really cute when you act little." He said stroking my cheek.
The next day we got up and got ready for the day. We went down to breakfast and ate what the elf prepared. Then the owl came and gave us our Hogwarts letters.
"Me and Harry learned stuff." Ron said after sharing a look with Harry over my unusual display.
He put the tip of his wand on the water and took out the memory. "We can do whatever you want love." Draco said.
All of the classes were the same as always. Nothing new besides spells and potion. Today we made Amorintia. Which smelled like Harry, and, now, I feel slightly horny.
Hermione who appeared out of nowhere said, "a boggart is a creature that takes shape in any form that the person fears. And lives in dark places. No one knows the original form since it takes different forms."
"Eww Draco!" He yelled.
"He really wants to get back with you. He loves you Harry." Blaise said.
"Well that is good. It's dinner time so let's go." Hermione said and got up.
After classes I met them at the library and we went to the restricted section. "So, what did you do to Harry?" Hermione whispered as we looked for werewolf books.
"Just making sure. I don't want you to feel forced into this relationship." I said sitting on the edge of his bed, then, Hermione and Ron came in.
"Yes. But how am I supposed to be underwater for an hour?" I said feeling slightly panicky.
"Malfoy I am getting married what do you not get from that?" I said.
"Not true." I said.
The next day I woke up in bed with Draco holding me in his arms. "Morning Harry." He mumbled against my shoulder.
Something is wrong with Harry. Every time I ask him if he is alright or tell him he can talk to me about anything he will get upset. I mean does he not love me? Does he not trust me?
"Yes." I said, sitting down. Draco sat next to me glaring at Lucif. "Don't be mad at Lucif. He is completely innocent." I said.
"So... you followed a patronus into a lake?" I asked.
We ate lunch and Mr. Weasly pulled Harry away to talk to him.
I broke a mirror. I then picked up a broken piece and sat in a corner looking at it. I rolled up the sleeves of my shirt and started making cuts. I then stood up. 'Now is the time to end it. Draco does not love me. I am disgusting. There is no point.' I thought.
"Only if you ask or for classes of course." I answered.
I laughed a little. Then I said, "yeah it is comfortable." I said.
"Have a biscuit Potter."
It's the last day of school and I can't wait until it's the summer. Right now Harry is talking to Sirius and I'm writing a note to my father asking if he can make Sirius a free man now.
"I'm sorry." Ron said and hugged him.
I quickly prepare us and pushed inside of him, we both moan. I continued to pushed in and out of him, we're both panting and moaning.
I kissed back rubbing against him. He then ripped off my shirt and pants. Then took his own off. I put his fingers in my mouth sucking and licking them. When he pulled them away he pushed them into my but slowly pulling them out then pushing them in. I moaned and pushed against them. He then pulled them out and slowly pushed himself inside me. I groaned and pushed against him. He smiled and began to slowly pull out and push in. Then he grabbed my penis and began to slowly stroke me and play with my balls. "Draco... Please. Harder. Faster." I panted.
So that night u cuddled with and and would place random kisses on his head and neck.
"You okay, harry dear?" Pansy asked.
"I saw him-"
"Don't we almost die every year?" He asked.
"Ron I don't want to be in the tournament," I said.
I ran to Snapes office just as he was walking out.
We started walking back when a black dog jumped out and attacked Ron. We chased after him but he went through the whomping willow. Hermione and I stopped but Harry kept running.
I then heard him whisper. "No more messing with him till he is at school."
"And why would you like that Harry?" Dumbldore asked.
"I am not taking the lessions any more." He said.
Ron looked like he was about to faint and Harry said, "we are friends of Hagrid. And we want to know if you attacked anyone at school. And what's in the chamber." Harry said not looking scared at all.
When I deemed it good enough I pulled them away and stuck in finger in his butt hole. He gasped and arched his back. I laughed and inserted another finger, then the third. He groaned and I pulled them out and inserted my penis in. He whined and pushed back a bit.
There is a potion that I can make the potion not effect me. Now if I could just make it without Draco knowing that would be great.
We got to the headmasters office and walked in after Harry said the password.
"Sorry." Ron mumbled and went to stuff his face.
"Yes they are." Pansy said and we laughed some more.
"Harry what about me?" Ginny desperately whined.
"Yeah. I don't think I'll have any trouble as long as I have Draco." I answerd and felt Draco hug me from behind.
"Draco it's time to go." Mother yelled from downstairs.
I saw a picture of Harry getting almost raped by Ginny and it has every thing that happened, including Harry's attempted suicide. Also me explaining Harry's abuse to Hermione.
But as soon as he left I took all the  vials and began putting the potion in.
"You can't trust boys," Ron said.
"He is not my boyfriend," Potter said, annoyed.
So we went to the kitchen and began to eat. "Are you all happy about the wedding. We heard you talking about it." Sirius said.
We went to the shrieking shack and Hermione told us about it. Then a snowball hit us. We turned and no one is there. Then anther hit Ron right in the face. Then I was knocked over and smelled Harry. I remember his invisibility cloak and ripped it off. He is smiling like an idiot.
"Yes and did you?" Draco asked.
"I don't know. But I sparkle in the sunlight." He said like it was nothing.
"Have a what?"
When we began eating Draco said, "I don't like her."
*Draco's P.O.V.*
The next day we left the Manor and apparated to the express. We went on and Ron and Hermione joined.
"What did you do to make him mad?" Blaise asked.
I nodded and Harry cuddled up to me.
"Well it's nice to meet you friends." He said and hugged us.
We walked away and Mr. Crouch wanted to talk to Harry, so we decided to meet Harry's friends at Hagrids. As Ron and Hermione are going I am spying.
"Punishment for calling me that." He replied.
"You are my friend, but I don't need you to worry about me. I am just fine." He said.
"Yes sir." Harry said.
"Yes love. Can you believe that the girls actually made a nickname for the both of us?" I said.
"Well this is not the time for bad news!" Draco said.
We then fell asleep.
I shook my head knowing he said the wrong thing before she even done a thing.
"I know, I just don't want him to be lonely." I said, holding him close.
"Maybe, but I'm sure we would be fine." I said ,holding him to me, and, with that, we drifted off to sleep.
"Well, we must get payback. And we must wash this off." Blaise said and got up brushing the grass and dirt off of himself.
Once we were both undressed Draco papered me and began thrusting into me.
I got home and slammed the door. Stupid Potter and his stupid fiancee and everything. Why can't anything go my way!?
So here I am walking with Hermione and Ron without Harry.
So we turned the page and there is more on werewolves.
I could feel him penetrating my wall and busting in like an army taking over a city. He was inside of me and he started moving. It felt amazing with him on top. He went so fast that he went in deeper and I moaned. He kept going and I grabbed onto the pillow because he was doing it so hard.  He stopped after awhile. "I'm tired. I think it's time we go to sleep." I nodded, then rolled over and instantly fell asleep.
"You will never leave me?" He asked.
"No its just...Hey is it true that you have your own Quidditch pitch?" Ron said, changing the subject.
She looked at me and Draco. "You two can figure it out." She said and looked back at the others.
The next day Draco took me to his dorm room. When he shut the door he turned to me. "Harry I am going to ask you somthing and I am going to need you to tell the truth. Do you hurt yourself and have depression issues? I won't be mad but I need the truth." Draco asked.
The door opened and Ron came through with some type of green stuff. "Hey Harry. Here is the Gilly weed. Draco had to go somewhere with Dumbledore and Hermione." He said.
"So Harry manipulated you?" Ron asked.
He shrugged and we went into the GryffindorÂ common room to see Blaise and Ron snogging on the couch.
I just walked up and kneeled in front of him taking his arm gently. "Why?" I asked taking out my wand and healing him.
Draco hugged me as every one cheers and clapped. We decided that we will go home then go to the summer manor.
"I don't think he will like me." Draco said, looking at his lap.
I kissed his cheek and we continued to walk.
We walked through to the common room. "I can not believe you actually call him that." Blaise said.
"It's almost curfew go to your rooms." Hermione said, getting up, Pansy following her to the girls room.
"Okay." She said and continued with her breakfast.
We all went to the great hall and sat at our usual spots. Remus came over. "Do you feel better harry?" Remus asked.
He then slowly began to thrust in and out of me hitting the spot every time. I squrmed and moaned wanting him to go faster. I pushed back and moaned. "Dr. Draco! Oh Harder! Faster! Mm Please!" I said panting and moaning.
"Everyone in Hogwarts. But, only me and Hermione know your genderfluid." Ron said.
"What is it?" Hermione asked.
"I'm fine Draco." He said.
Ron walked back in looking confused. "What did Ginny want?" I asked.
"Did you actually sleep?" Ron asked.
She got up and sat next to Harry. "Ron is being so thick! I don't know why he is being this way, but please don't do anything rash Draco. The laws for werewolf mates can't protect you perfectly." She said.
We went to the library and Harry got a book on dreams and began reading that.
I shook my head forceing myself not to smirk. "Harry what is going on?" Hermione asked.
"Have you told Dumbledore?" He asked.
McGonagall and I went back in and Draco is standing over a paralyzed Ginny. "So, I guess we can all go to my office. I'll have the Minister come." McGonagall said and levitated Ginny.
"Why are we not going to classes?" I asked.
"It's okay love you will have plenty of time at hogwarts." Draco said, kissing my cheek.
I nodded and kissed his cheek. He hugged me tight and said ,"tank you Dwaco."
Ron p.o.v
Hermione glared at Ron. "That is not funny. Plus, since Harry is missing a whole of two nights that means less time for homework and studying for owls." She said.
I kissed his cheek making him blush and quickly walk over to Hermione who winked at me. And a confused Ron.
"Im fine with whatever you get me love." I said.
Draco p.o.v
So I kissed Harry good night and ran to my room as he did to his.
"I told him they're mean and that I don't want to go back. I didn't say they are abusing me or malnourishing me like they are." I said.
"Yeah sure. I mean you could have told your best friend how you did it!" he said getting mad.
"How was your date last night boys?" Hermione asked.
"How did you even sneak here?" Hermione said.
I moved my head to the side allowing him access. He bit into my neck and began sucking out the blood. I pulled him closer enjoying the feeling.
Harry's been gone for a while, so... I decided to go look for him, with Blaise and Ron of course. I followed his foot we came to a frozen lake and Harry jumped in. I quickly jumped in after him, and found him struggling, with the horcrux choking him. I grab him and drag him to the surface  as Ron grabs the sword.
Harry giggled and nuzzled my neck. "Dove you Dwaco."
"Shut it weasel." Draco said.
Of course I will not tell Draco.
"It's about Harry." He said.
As I sobbed into Draco's chest, I felt so weak. I don't want him to see me that way. But that is what I am.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know. No one does." He said.
When we got there we went for a walk and it's dark. Harry is walking away from us. He then stopped and looked scared. I walked over to him and saw Mister Crouch dead.
"Hey, this is reserved for the Gryffindors," Oliver said.
Ugh. Monday is enough to nock any one out of a nice little space sleep. Then I realized I actually gave Draco stuffed animal. And he liked it!
Ron took it and said, "yes, but it's a big snake how can nobody have seen it?"
"You think you should open it?" He asked.
I got changed and he walked out. "Let's go to Hagrids." I said and we went to Hagrids.
Calm down Harry. If he did not love you he would have let you die.
Harry's P.O.V (two days later)
"Then what was it?" I asked.
"I wonder what she was doing in the library. I'm sure she would easily have figured out this." Ron said.
By the time we got there he was fast asleep.
"We all need to bring dates, but Hermione is not sure who she should go with." Ron said.
Harry p.o.v (time skip to tomorrow after lunch)
"I rather be sucking something else." Draco mumbled, though I'm sure all of us heard it because the girls glared at Draco. Ron and Blaise began laughing as I am blushing, wishing that he did not say it loud enough.
I got up and shot the binding curse on her. She froze and Draco got off, turning human. "How did you get away?" I asked.
"Probably never. Poor Blaise." I said.
Professor McGonagall looked at us and said, "Ron, I'm so sorry..."
It was time for dismissal and he called Neville to stay behind. I dragged Harry out not liking this new teacher.
"He might blame it on us," Harry pointed out.
Draco gave me my potion and I felt the slight effects it gives me. I'm happy that it barely works anymore.
"Why are you not paying attention? You need to get the ingredients. I will set up the cauldron." Draco said, looking at me strange.
I went a different way to the great Hall so Harry won't think I'm intentionally fallowing him. Plus it helps me clear my head and think rationlly.
"Stop. I'm trying to sleep." I said, straddling him and burying my head into his chest.
"Ginny and wormtail. I will kill them." He said and got up.
Harry just shrugged and Pansy said, "Well, we have all had a long day, let's get some rest." We then got up and ready for the night.
"Yeah relax now. Worry later." Harry said, relaxing to me.
"Hey, its a full moon tonight. You should get going. I'll see you tomorrow." He said and hugged me.
I pulled back again and saw that Harry's lips are bruised a bit. "We need to get ready.Â  Your friends will be here soon." I said and tried to get up.
We then went to the common room and I had Harry cuddle me while Hermione forced us to do home work.
"Well, you both have time." Remus said.
"Oh yeah. you must have been thinking about Harry and not paying attention when Dumbledore explained the Triwizard Tournament. The other schools are coming to Hogwarts to play. Only seventh years can play." She teased.
Draco p.o.v
Draco pailed as Ms Weasly yelled at Ron for saying that as Sirius laughed saying that he thinks the same thing.
"I'm sorry Ron that it sounds like we are all against your sister." I said.
Then Ron and Blaise walked in.
The End
"Sirius." He said, pocketing them.
"Then why won't you tell us anything?" Draco asked, hugging me to him.
I smiled and said, "I'm sorry. All those things we spent money on."
"That's a nice choker Harry," Hermione said.
I then took off his shirt and began biting and kissing his chest and stomach making plenty of bruises.
"So did you tell him?" Hermione whispered to me.
"Oh he was fired. I'm back. So all of you take your seats and let's start where we left off." Umbitch said.
"What did you do this time?" Hermione asked glaring daggers at Draco.
"It is alright. This, my children, is a Pensieve. I use it to look back and see what went wrong. It is quite helpful. Especially when I find my mind a bit stretched." Dumbledore explained.
"I did as well, just maybe a little too well." I said as we entered the Great Hall. Everyone was looking at us strangely and it took me a moment to realize why, no one else had really seen us act this way, not fighting. Looking away from everyone's gazes we started talking about random topics, sitting just as the owls came to deliver our time tables and any letters and mail we may have gotten.
"Yes. Like rotting garbage." Draco replied.
We found Harry and he is holding a shard of glass to his neck, eyes closed and breathing heavy. Draco took the glass just as Harry made a small cut. Harry was trying to get away, but Draco wouldn't let him.
Ginny sat next to me and clung onto my arm. "You don't like him do you?" Her voices had obvious disgust and arrogance.
"To say good morning. And thank u for coming to the party." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
When we got into the room, Snape and McGonagall are standing in the middle of the room. They told us what we are doing and allowed us to learn to dance.
"Why would you think it's a dream?" He asked.
"I always carry a vial on me for emergency." Hermione answerd showing us a vial.
"You are a bad boy." Draco said.
"There really is not much to tell. The Wizarding world I bet knows more about me than me." I said as he held some food up to me.
We both said morning to her then began eating our breakfast.
"So pretty," Ron said dreamily.
The same as always. Just all bla bla bla.
I then pushed myself in him and began pulling in and out Balise moaning and wimpering.
Draco p.o.v
Pansy sighd and said, "get some rest. I'm sure this will all be better later."
Blais came over. " I can't go back home." He said.
I jumped off and Hagrid asked how I think this went and I told him it's great.
"What happened to calling him Draco." Ron asked.
I scoffed and began tickling him. He laughed and tried squirming away. "Apologize and I'll stop," I said.
Then the curtains opened and Ron yelled. Draco jumped off me and I said, "the whole reason why I closed the curtains was so you won't see me and Draco kiss. So why did you open the curtains?"
After breakfast, we went to sit by the lake. Harry cuddling next to me and Ron and Blaise laying in the grass next to each other, Pansy and Hermione sitting under a tree.
"Fine. But I think Scabbers is sick." Ron said, looking at his rat.
Hermione and Ron have been talking, but there is always tension. It's so thick I can cut it with a knife.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"We don't need to hear about it!" Hermione said.
And it explains how I am wearing a girl uniform and kissing the Malfoy heir.
A bit later I was not in 'kid mode' anymore, and we began eating dinner.  Hermione, sadly, was right. I only ate about half of my plate.
"Well moldy wart is back so really no one is safe." I answer.
"My dress robes," I said.
"Oh come on. Why not?" She asked.
"Harry I'm going to go talk to Snape. I'll meet you in the Great hall." I said and kissed his cheek.
Ron, Hermione, and Draco then came in. As Ron walked by he said, "I feel sorry for you." As Draco sat next to me smirking.
I saw the dragon he had to fight. 'shoot he might die.' I thought. The dragon blew fire at him, making me jump and I knew I looked worried. I saw him cast the spell. When his Fire bolt got to him he jumped onto it and tried to get around the dragon. The chain holding it somehow broke off and the dragon tried to get to Harry, but he flew away and I wasn't able to see either of them.
"He said 'Good because you're mine now beautiful'," I quoted.
I smiled. "It's okay my Draco. I forgive you." I said.
â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢
Though I only paid half attention as I set up my room how I want.
"Has any member of the black faimly asked you to hide a object like this?" I asked showing the elf the horcrox.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Well, the people attacking is called death eaters. The thing in the sky is called the dark mark. It's how Moldywart communicates with the death eaters." I said explaining it to Harry.
Blaise came in. "So what are you four doing?" He asked.
When we got to our dorm and got ready for bed, Draco put a silence charm on the curtains and used a non-pregnating charm on me. He then began kissing me and biting at my skin, causing me to moan and whine as I rubbed my hips against his.
"Nice to meet you Draco. Harry has spoken very highly of you." Sirius said. "It's nice to be able to see my cousin and her son." He added.
He smiled and blushed. "I love you Draco." Harry said.
"Yay presents. What ya getting me Harry?" Ron asked him.
I leaked against Draco who cuddled me and ran his fingers through my hair.
"Just a nightmare. I'm fine. Sorry for waking you." I said.
We  found our own compared and talked about our summer.
"You will even if I dont." I said, rolling my eyes.
We all agreed and sat in a comfortable silence.
"Did you sleep good harry?" Pansy asked, smiling.
So he pulled me closer and kissed me much harder this time.
It didn't do much to clear my head. I just kept thinking of how my friends and Draco were risking there lives for me, and how we are stuck in the woods in the middle of winter, then a beautiful patronus in the shape of a doe came up to me. As it walks away, I follow it because it keeps looking back at as if trying to tell me something.
After the wedding Lucia's and Narcissa took then go there house so me and Draco can go on a honey moon. He decided we will go to his summer home for a month.
I looked over at Hermione and she is done and is frantically looking over her book and potion.
He bounced a little in his step and smiled.
I ignored them. "Since you gave them the idea to call me that, I shall punish you." I said.
I still think I'm being a little to clingy.
"I'm sorry my dear boy, but there is nothing that can be done." Dumbledore said.
"Yes, it would be nice to know. Probably bringing in some great teacher." I suggested.
"No. But will it make it better if I talked to him?" I asked.
Harry got up and ran out.
Draco p.o.v
"If you attack him for no reason then you will get in trouble," I said smiling at him.
They nodded and Ron said, "I think that if Malfoy would want to spread anything around, it would be that you are a genderfluid and cross-dress."
"Draco I'm sure it'll be fine." I said, sitting next to him on the couch.
"Not hungry." Harry replied.
He began rubbing against me and his hand getting really close to an area that should not be touched at the moment. I carefully moved his hand. Then I realized that his sent has been slightly changed and more enhanced.
He wrapped his arms around me and I cuddeld next to him. "It's warm when you're here." He said.
He was upset but I don't care. I have my Draco to take me.
"Get a room!" Ron and Blaise yelled.
I heard Draco huff. "We are busy!" He yelled. He began kissing my lips again and slipped his hand down my pants.
"I'm sorry. It's fine. Let's go to bed. I am tired from being tied at the bottom of a lake for an hour." I said.
I walked over and the owl flew away. I took the note that was on it.
"That's good my harry." I said and lightly kissed his lips.
I started to also think about room arrangement. I think it will be best if me and Harry stay in the Gryffindor common room. I'm sure most of the Slytherin will hate me, Blaise, and Pansy because we are with the light.
I flew away following the snitch. Then, Draco flew right next to me.
"But I don't want to." I whined.
"No. How could it be?" He replied.
"He lives with muggles and his Godfather is Sirius Black," he answered.
Then we went to the great Hall. Us talking joyusly about our crushes.
Once I got there Harry is talking to Ron, Hermione, and Blaise.
So after we ate we all began our walk to Dumbledore's office.
"Are you even listing to me?" Blaise whined.
Bellatrix lestrage shot the killing curse at Sirius so I quickly ran in front and took the blow. Falling into darkniss.
Everyone began chanting for Harry to open it.
He nodded and held on as I walked us down to the dungeons and in my room.
He just brung me closer allowing me to do what I want.
"What happened?" McGonagall said.
I sighed and Hermione gave me a disapproving look. "Just one. No more." I said and Hermione shook her head.
"Why would you bite Harry like that?" Hermione asked.
"No way Dray." I said.
"Um... I don't want to talk professor." Harry said.
I kissed him again and said, "well your not. You should be happy Harry."
Draco hugged me. "Don't worry Harry they will be dealt with." Draco said.
"I hate Rita." I said laying my head on his shoulder.
He began thrusting as I moaned and gasped.
"Um. Harry. Are you sure?" Hermione. Asked.
"I'm fine. I have detention with Umbitch for a month. And I got kicked off quidich." Harry replied.
"Hermione figured that out too. The pipes," I countered.
I started to poke Draco in the side. Then started to tickle him, Which made him lose his gripe. I got on top of him and tickled him till he is gasping for breath and begging me to stop. So I stopped.
He sighed and said, "my parents wanted me to break up with Ron and join the dark side, I said no and they beat me. So I left and went to Ron."
"Yes well, they replace all happiness with fear. But no need to worry once we get to Hogwarts you should be fine. Speaking of Hogwarts you all should get ready we are almost there. See you four in class." Mr. Lupin said and walked out. Though I noticed he became upset when he mentioned Sirius. I wander if they knew each other.
"I have found my mate and I'm going to give him them." I said.
Draco p.o.v
"No dwaco. Not hungwy." Harry said.
"It's okay harry. It's okay. I'll help all I can. Now I know I should not ask this, but would you like to take a break or go to our next class. We may be a bit late though." Draco said.
"I'll take him inside," Moody said and went to touch Harry.
"Umbrige. Okay. I'll gave Harry's detention to be with Professer McGonagall. Don't worry my boys I'll have this all sorted out. Pleas go to classes now." Dumbldore said.
We both got in ready positions and I yelled, "expelliarmus!" And he flew backwards.
He leaned down and began kissing me again, his tongue practically down my throat.
"Harry. Why did you do that?" He was trying to help." I said hugging him.
He shook his head and sat down at the edge of the table away from Ron who was with Hermione. "No, I hurt him though. He started calling you and me cruel names, saying bad things about us. I threw a vase at him. Hermione said that if he said those things to you it would be ten times worse. She said he was lucky you weren't there." Harry said, looking at them.
And of course we have went out a few times. But all the times that I was able to spend with Draco was fun.
When we were half way through out homework, I grab Harry's arm and drag him up to our room. I pushed him onto the bed and climb on top of him and began kissing him hard on the lips he immediately kisses back. I began going down his jaw line and neck and I start rubbing against him and feel him harden.
"You know Draco you should let him do things by himself," Hermione said.
"You'll see." They said and walked out.
I knocked on the bedroom door. "Harry let me in." I said.
"Yes," Harry said.
For the rest of the day we cuddled and ate lunch and dinner.
"Yes sir. Draco was the one that made the whole school find out. He used magic to make a snake appear out of no where and it was about to attack, so I told it not too. Everyone thought I was egging it on." I said and Narcissa and Lucius nodded.
"It's fine love." He said as we walked into the room.
So now we are in the room of requirement, laying on the bed and cuddling.
"Where are Ron and Blaise?" Harry asked.
"What's next? Will he give Harry a dead animal?" Ron asked.
"Well... I really want to tell you something but I am afraid of how you will react," I said, sitting on his bed.
We went in and sat down as Umbrige gave us first year books. Hermione raised her hand and said, "professor. Why are you giving us first year books?"
"Every day after dinner starting tomorrow." He said.
So we got ready for bed and fell asleep cuddling each other.
"Alright." He said, hugging me tighter.
I locked our bathroom door with the depressing potion in hand. I remeber reading some were that if you take more of a potion than needed then you will die from over dose. So if I take more than a sip of my potion I will die.
"Draco wanted to be lazy." I said.
Just as he asked if there is any one who thinks we should not be wed Draco appeared. "I think they should not." He said as he stormed up the isle.
I made it all nice with a fire, a cozy couch with a coffee table, and a room that will be a bed room.
"Ya I'm fine." I said and grabbed some night cloths. I walked into the bathroom, changed, and went to bed. Draco joined me a second later.
Draco rubbed my back and laughed a little. "You welcome my little Harry."
"Then why can't I keep a girl?" I asked.
I just smiled and shook my head.
She came over and put both her hands on either side of my head, "You want to know a secret?" She asked.
"It says anyone in this school. You and your mate are in this school. So sit down and write your lines." Umbitch said.
"Don't worry I will make sure father does not let anything bad happen to either of them," Draco said.
"I did not leave you. Plus I was only gone for an hour." I said, hugging him back. "Where are your parents?" I asked.
Harry p.o.v
We entered Hogsmeade and I got Harry some candy from the store and walked around.
"Draco, no growling at Remus." Harry said.
Harry stood on the girls side of the line and I stood on the boys side. We have our arms linked and are waiting to go in. "So love are you ready to go?" I asked.
The girls started whispering. "They're so cute! Harry even gave Malfoy a nickname." One girl said. "Harry is definitely the girl in the relationship." Another said.
Harry p.o.v
Yesterday we were told that we need to meet the Order of the Phoenix, or as I like to call them, Dumbduck's ducks on fire. Sadly Ginny will be there and there is nothing we can do about it.
Harry and Mason explained their conversation. I was excited that Harry is mine again. But a little upset that I did ruin Harry's wedding.
I guess that everyone thinks I'm not with them is for the reason that I'm gay.
Ginny came over. "Ron can I speak to you alone?" Ginny said.
"Well the Ministry let me in. Just as long as I don't use real magic unless it's for an emergency." Ginny explained and sat right next to him.
"Well I promise I will never leave you. Plus that's more a nightmare than a dream." I said and made him sit on my lap.
I felt kind of hurt. He could have bothered us with it. It actually would have not been a bother at all. We could have had him live with me or Hermione.
Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Blaise thought I was crazy when me and Pansy practically made them ride on mid air.
"He-who-shall not be named tried to use the Obliviate spell, but it backfired and hit him. Now he remembers nothing and is in Saint Mungo's." Hermione said.
We began walking out and he said, "Because they are great friends."
"So Harry what crazy thing are you planning for next year? He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named of the future?" Ron said.
I turned looking ahead. All dark and misty. One part of me is telling me to turn back. But there is no back. Another part is saying go forward win this for Draco.
"Yes. But it won't do anything." Mom said.
Sirius and Remus then came in. "Hello Draco. How have you been?" Sirius asked.
"For one she is not dead. Two, I was telling them about me being a vampire because Harry is my mate." I said and Dumbledore nodded.
"Thank you, Hedwig. By the way, my owl is an eagle owl named Earl. Have a nice night." I said tying the letter to it. I left and thought: the owl is nice.
The first present I opened from Draco is wrapped the same way as Ron's owl. When I opened it I saw a snake about the size of a chair leg. He looked at me. "Hello. I am your familiar. My name is Lucif." The snake said. "I'm Harry Potter. How was Draco able to choose a familiar for me?" I asked in parseltongue.
"Okay: his favorite color is green, he likes chocolate and treacle tart and he likes all flowers. Anything else?" I said.
"I am fine. It smells like you." He said in almost a whisper.
"Thanks Hermione." I said.
Harry p.o.v
I laughed and replied. "Not ours. Bill and Fleur's!"
We landed in a courtroom. Dumbledore and Mad-Eye are sitting next to us. And there is Mr. Crouch sitting near the front. Then in a big cage, some man appeared. He began naming off death eaters until he mentioned one that made everyone surprised. "Barty Crouch.... Junior." They then caught him and took him away.
I walked out of the library with Ron. Sadly Draco and Hermione have not come back and I don't know why. The good thing though is that Neville has gotten me gillyweed.
So here I am waiting for Harry.
We went to the living room just as the fire place lit up with green fire. Hermione came through. "Harry, Draco. It's so good to see you two again." She said, walking up and hugging us both.
"Why?" I asked.
"But your gay. So how can having boobs be hot?" Ron asked.
"I will help to. I can already see it now." Pansy said and began staring off into space.
Harry p.o.v
"He complains a little, though I think he likes you. What's that letter? I smell food." She said nipping my hand.
"Well harry I think that I like the idea of keeping you all to myself and you tied to my bed." He said and started to kiss my neck.
"Men." Hermione and Pansy said together.
"Yes he has. He might let me live with you and Remus next year." I said.
After we ate and went to our bedroom to get ready for bed Mason pushed me to a wall and said, "now where were we?"
"Really? I thought that living with muggles you would see strangerÂ things." Pansy said.
We walked out and Harry froze. "What?" I heard him whisper.
"That is good. Harry is a good person." She replied.
"When you turn seventeen you would be able to get pregnant and have children." I explained.
When we got to the edge of the forest the spiders went back.
I frowned knowing that would mean less time with Harry. "Okay. Um. Just tell me if anything is bothering you, promise?" I said.
I nodded and closed the door. "i am going to write to my parents. You can do whatever." I said. I got out parchment and a quill and wrote that Harry's friends might be coming over and that Harry is now sharing a dorm with me.
"Fine, but I will find out. So what will your parents think of all this? About who you're secretly dating and the tournament?" She asked.
"Good got to go. bye." May said and walked away.
"Well, when I am with Draco there is nothing to worry about," I said.
"My Godfather, Sirius Black." I answerd.
I just stayed silent and Draco then said, "How about we challenge you? Whoever wins, gets the field."
I handed every one that is playing a broom and grabbed the box that keeps the balls. We walked over to the pitch.
"If they end up together. You won't leave Harry right?" I asked.
"Hey its only cute when Harry calls me Dracy poo. But if you ever do again I'll murder you." Draco said, glaring at Ron.
"Harry I know you are cutting your self. I just want to see." I said, reassuring him.
"No. Now I was wondering can you wear a dress tomorrow?" He said.
"You mean Ginny tried to rape Harry?" Mrs Weasley asked.
"Oh. I'll go talk to him." Blaise said and went to him.
"Morning Draco." I said, cuddling more to him.
"Well take your food princess and eat." Pansy said shoving food into our hands.
I smiled and said, "I'm good. What do you want?"
"Merlin, Harry you're not going to die. Divination is fake none of it is real!" Hermione said exasperatedly.
So that night Harry slept with me in my room. Him cuddled up to me, his head resting in the crook of my neck.
When I got home it completely sank in. Harry will never love me. I blew it. I made him hate me for the rest of my life.
"I don't know. Hermione'll help with that. Me and Ron may be talking now, but he is still a little cold to me." Harry said.
"His death was a tragic acsadent. So detention. Go to your head of house." She said.
He put his head under my chin and rested.
This time he allowed me and fallowed. "well I'll go with." He stated walking right next to me. I ignored him and did not even look him. "Ugh I can not take this any more!" Draco said.
"To see if we can get anything on the chamber. Have you two not noticed that the teachers are on edge with it?" Hermione asked.
As soon as we sat down she noticed the mark and looked shocked. Then she glared at me. Ron looked as well. "Bloody Hell Harry. What did Draco do to you?" He hissed quietly, alarmed.
Ron started talking about hurting Draco for hurting Harry but then froze. "wait he. He kissed you?" Ron asked.
Harry p.o.v
"It's okay. My mum crossed out these names. She done that one when I ran away." Sirius said and pointed to his name. I could almost not read it.
"Turning gay. Do you even like guys? Have you ever thought a guy was cute?" She said mad.
"Harry open up. please love." I said, knocking on the door.
"Which is what I am afraid of." Remus said and went back to glaring at us. Or more at Draco who is not paying attention and running his fingers through my hair.
"No. It's almost dinner. We should go. Bye Hagrid." I said.
I'm so stupid. I should have known he would never leave me. I'm a horrible mate.
He cuddled to meand said, "thank you Draco."
I took it out and it's the knife from potions. The door nob turned and Draco walked in, so I put the knife back. "hey Harry. I got dinner." Draco said, setting it on the bed.
Harry p.o.v
"Don't worry you are just as sane as I am." She said nicely.
"Love you, too ,Harry." He said and kissed my neck.
So Harry and I walked out. "Well, we are out of the closet. Again." Harry said and laughed.
"Harry why is there a rabbit in your trunk?" Draco demanded.
"Okay, Draco. Only if he does something bad." I relented.
He put the vile away and came back. "Now we are going to Madam Pomfrey's then we have classes." He said and took my hand.
"Okay let me look." He said taking the paper from me.
When we got to the common room we all went to our separate rooms. The good thing about being Slytherin is that we get our own rooms.
"I know love. Hagrid is insane. Now I regret signing up for his Care of Magical Creatures class." I said and Harry hit me.
"The black library. How about we not worry about this now. Sleep love and we can leave tomorrow.
"They want to be our friends. Saturday we will get Draco a present." Hermione said.
I leaned against Draco who just put his arm around me.
"Yes you are. You are my puppy." I said, walking to the door as Draco and Sirius followed.
I brought him down and kissed him. He kissed back as I turned us over, him on bottom and me straddling his waist. I then began kissing his jaw line all the way to his neck where I began bitting and kissing, leaving a few love bites. I put one hand down his pants as I started to bite the other side of his neck.
We all went to our dorms. Draco gave me a kiss goodnight and went to his. Since everyone was already gone I went to mine alone.
When we got to the carriages we all got in and talked about our summer.
"Yes. Now leave us alone."Draco said.
Draco p.o.v
"It's nice. I like it." Harry said. The food appeared and we began to eat.
We went to the room of requirement and walked in. It's a room full of us less junk but oh well.
He pulled away. "That was not nice. But since it's your birthday I will let it slide." He said and kissed me some more.
"Well maybe we don't want to get a room." Ron said.
"Harry had a blood quill used on him." Draco growled out.
"Wait, father, I'm confused!" I called after him.
Ron stood up breathing heavily with a black eye. "The bloody hell was that for? I just pourd water on you!" Ron said covering his black eye.
Draco Malfoy
"How are you going to tell him?" Father asked.
I got scared. "We will finish this later." I sad to Harry.
"Is it truly from you and you are just trying to be romantic?" I asked smiling and opening the package.
We laughed at him and Draco said. "I think that you are going to go stay with Remus and Sirius for half the year then you'll stay with me. Are you Happy that Sirius is free now?" And he turned me around to face him.
"Meanie!" Ginny and I said in unison.
Hermione p.o.v (earlyer)
"So. Am I not allowed to kiss you?" I asked.
"Sorry. Now we are going to meet your friends tomorrow right?" I said changing the subject.
"She started to twist everything I said and put in lies. I told her I was dating someone, but not who." I said.
I love my little Harry. When he pulled away he said, "the cookies should be done now." And ran downstairs. Mom followed.
I pulled Harry to my side hugging him like a child would a teddy bear.
"Yes, I do. Why do you ask." He said sitting up.
"Yes Ron we are fine." I said, rolling my eyes. I mean Draco was just shocked and passed out.
When he finished he got me back to being in his vice grip and laying with him. "Um. Food." I said.
"I know that this will make us not be able to spend much time together. Are you going to be okay?" Harry asked.
"I'm still Quidditch captain. Also good job Draco." I said.
"Fear in the name only increases fear in the object." Hermione said.
On the way in, the twins decided to sneak up behind us and yell "Harry's out of the closet!" and everyone clapped.
Hermione rolled her eyes and grabbed them both by the elbows, leading them to the hospital wing.
I sat up on the bed and saw our friends standing there. Ron looked at me. "What did we interrupt?" Ron asked.
"Well it's hot." Draco said looking at me lustfully making me blush.
Blaise p.o.v
"Are you okay harry?" Hermione asked and I nodded.
"Harry pleas talk to me. I miss you!" Draco said laching onto me hugging me tight.
Since both the Malfoys and Weasley put together their money we got the best seats.
Draco p.o.v
I smiled down at him. All summer he has taken his potion and not complained. He has not cut once. He is doing great.
We got up and I gave Harry his potion, though it did not smell like it normally did. Probably just tired. We got dressed.
"We thought it best not to." I said.
"Hey. I am not leaving your side." I said.
And that's when I remembered what happened. Draco kissing me. I blushed a bit and got up walking out of the room. "How are you feeling harry?" Hermione asked me as we walked through the portrait.
I hope I can get him to like me.
"We're here Malfoy, now what do you need?" Harry asked.
"It's not too much," I said.
"Still getting ready. Should be down soon." I said.
"Draco?" Ron said unsurely.
We all cheered as Harry scooped up the egg and ran back into the tent.
Hermione's p.o.v
"Don't worry Harry I'm not mad. Please don't cry Harry. It's alright." I said.
"I'm sure you won't be to anyone that takes you in. Plus I am sure the Weasleys will love to have you. And my mom has been wanting a girl around the house. And that will make you the next best thing." He said.
When we got to dinner Harry is already there sitting at the table. Seeming a little mad. "Are you okay Harry." I asked sitting next to him.
Both girls and Blaise nodded, but Ron yelled."No! No, Draco! You have disappointed me, I thought you were going to keep Harry nice and safe... But no! You go and get him pregnant, I just can't believe. Harry, I not mad at you, I'm mad at Draco."
I looked at Draco and he smiled. "So Harry tell me about yourself." He said taking my fork.
I'm in the library making a potion for Hermione. Once I give it to her everything will turn out perfect. Mwa ha ha ha haaaasaaaaaaaa!!!!!
"And why do you hate her?" Draco asked.
"You can't do that!" He said.
I shook my head. "It's stupid." I mumbled.
"You are still famous Harry. We got the horcrox and did rally every one together to help fight." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
"I love you to Draco. I'm sorry for ignoring you." He said quitly.
"No, I have it. You can go mess with the magic items." I said and went back to cooking.
Harry frowned and said, "I don't. I'm going to go get the rest of my books." He said and walked away.
"Why do you only listen to Draco?" Blaise asked.
"Yah... I'm sorry." I said trying to pull away.
He pulled. "I am fine. You should stop worrying." He said. He stood up an I did to.
"You alright love?" I asked.
Draco p.o.v
When we got in Slughorn had us all do a potion. Harry, again, turning out to be the best.
Mom is sitting next to my bed and she smiled sadly at me.
"He dumped water on me and Harry." Draco said as we sat down.
He sighed and done the same.
"I just opened it Draco what do you think?" Harry shot back giving me a deadly stare. I wisely backed off for a few minutes until he seemed to have gotten a little in. "The first ten pages are about the spell itself. Lupisis Protome. The first word is from Lupus, wich is Latin for wolf. The reason it's so painful to endure is because it highly enhances the senses." Harry said, whilst reading the book.
We looked at each other smiling and Blaise grabbed me and kissed me. "I love you Ron. I always will." Blaise said.
We stood up and I washed Harry's whole body and rinsed him off. He then washed me and we got out and dressed and went to the great hall.
I just huffed. "No fun." I said.
The next day we moved into the Manor and began talking about the wedding.
When we were done eating, we walked out of the Great Hall, and Ginny came up to us. "Hey Harry. What have you been up to?" She said flirtatiously.
I hugged back, him burying his face into my neck. "It's okay Harry I'll make sure nothing hurts you," I said reassuringly.
"We went to the muggle world and bought a present for Hermione and stayed here for the rest." I said.
He shrugged and I groaned. Of course. That makes sense. The constant wanting touch and the good smell. "Don't worry Harry you'll be fine." Hermione said. We left the great hall, me kissing Harry goodbye.
"Alright, we're leaving." Harry said trying to pull me away but I said, "Don't worry Ron you can trust me." I said.
"Draco no. You can't do this." Hermione said.
"I have been trying to find that out. I still don't have a clue." Draco said, shrugging.
"The Floo of course," Ron said. "Oh, mom, Harry has never traveled by Floo before," Ron added after a second of thought.
"But. Draco!" He replied.
Draco forgave her to and then we all ate.
He opened an empty compartment and allowed me in first. I took out my wand and stepped in. I then sat down him across from me.
I saw the dark mark appear in the sky and got nervous. Harry stumbled holding his head though I had a good hold on him and kept leading him.
Hermione rolled her eyes and said, "That's not what I meant. Just never mind. Do what you want." She walked up to her dorm room huffily.
"Fred and Gorge beater, Ron a chaser, and whoever wants to be a keeper." He said.
I woke up and realized that I fell asleep on Draco. But now I am in my bed. Meaning that Draco tucked me into bed. I blushed a bit and grabbed my glasses.
I'm even sure that I saw Snape grin. And he like never does.
One we found the room we went in and found the bathroom. Then saw Ginny's shampoo and placed it all in. "I can't wait until she uses this," I snickered.
He then took off my boxers along with his and grabbed me down there. I gave a loud moan, thanking magic for silencing charms. He continued rubbing me as he placed himself inside of me. We both moaned as he continued thrusting in and out and kissing my neck and mouth.
I fell to the ground, passed out.
We sat down and talked about what this school year may bring. When the trolly lady came by we bought some candy. Me and Blaise has to convince Ron and harry not to by every single price of candy.
In the morning when I woke up, I checked the potion and gave it to Harry. He took it and smiled.
Her face went even redder. "Give me back my wand you mutt!" She yelled.
"HARRY! DRACO! WE ARE HOME!" I heard his father yell.
They nodded and Ron said, "Well, we will always be here to help Harry."
Harry p.o.v
I moved a little, uncomfortable. I mean I am tied naked on a bed in front of my friends. I don't care if I have a blanket covering me or not.
I pouted and said, "But Draco! I want to."
He then kissed my neck and all the way up to my jawline. I made him kiss my lips and he gotten completely on top of me.
I pouted. "It was just a bite Harry. Sorry." Draco said.
"I forgot." He said as he backed up until he hit the couch and fell into it.
I paced my room and Blaise appeared. "What do you need Draco?" He asked.
"That is not. Plus it's looking at Scabbers like food. Tell her Harry." Ron said.
The next day. We ate breakfast then went to open presents. And nothing interesting happen for the rest of the break.
"But still I miss him," I said.
That's all. Hope you enjoy.
We nodded and she calmed and continued to eat.
I would deal with that later. I had more worrying things to panic about. I couldn't face them, how could I?! I had been so cruel to him and his friends for the past three years all because of a stupid crush. What a stupid crush that turned out to be. Fate must be laughing at me now. Harry would just reject me on the spot! This would be the the death of me. literally! But strangely I didn't feel as awful about that as I did hurting my mate all these years. I'm not surprised if he rejects me. My inner wolf whimpered at the thought. I'm sure the whole school could feel my cries of anguish.
Draco p.o.v
We then got dressed Harry feeling like a girl today, so she picked out a pink shirt some shorts with a design on the butt. She began walking hetself with a slight limp. I laughed but just held her hand and we went down to breakfast.
After classes we went to the library to do our home work and study.
"Draco are you going to your parents for the holidays?" Hermione asked me.
When we walked in I pushed Harry onto a wall and began kissing him. He kissed back as I began rubbing my hand on him. I then nibbled on his bitten lip asking for entrance. And he gave in.
"So Harry moved into the Slytherin cave?" Pansy asked.
Then he started class.
Draco closed the door and placed the stuff on a dresser. I also noticed my night clothes. "That is strange. So what is this." He says handing me the parchment and cloak.
When he was finished we both got into bed and fell asleep cuddled next to each other.
"Or else I will ground you," I said.
"Alright. let's go." I said and we went to the robe shop.
He hoped on and began dogging the dragon. He then flew out of the stadium the dragon following.
"How about we go to Hogsmead now. We need to buy presents."Hermione said distracting the two.
Harry p.o.v
Ron chocked as Blaise smiled and said, "I did. Though Ron wants to next time."
"Well, they're hot and gorgeous," Ron replied and went into a daydream.
"It's no problem love." I said, petting his hair.
*Harry's P.O.V.*
Draco p.o.v
"Of course." I said quietly.
We got back and Dumbledore told me to hide, so I got under my cloak and hid. Snape, then, came in with death eaters. I looked at Dumbldore who smiled and nodded to Snape. Snape killed the old Headmaster making him fall from the tower, hitting the ground with a loud crack.
Harry took out his map for the fifth time. "Still not in Hogwarts." He said.
"So that's what you were telling it," Ron said.
"Well, I'm bored what would you guys like to do?" Draco asked.
"I love you draco." He said.
"So what have you this marvelous idea?" Harry asked.
"It'll be fine Hermione. Can I go please?" I asked, pleading like a child.
Harry p.o.v
Draco laughed a bit. "Don't worry Harry we can go further another time." Draco said.
He nodded so I began helping him.
"Wait both of us? Which means including me?" Ron asked and Draco nodded. "Thanks!" Ron continued and walked off.
The door opened. "Bloody hell." I heard Ron yell.
"You'll get used to them." I told him.
I smiled and sat on one of the couches Draco next to me. Hermione handed out the presents and we started to open them. I got the same things as last year and a choker from Draco that has a snake charm on it.
We then went out and Draco transformed into his blond wolf. I transformed into my animal and we began running around the grounds, playing and nipping at eachother.
"Wait. You mean you see those horse things to?" Pansy said.
Pansy came over as well. "Harry, me, and my parents don't want to be on The dark ones side. We should ask Dumbledore for help." She said.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
Harry finally walked out with a hopeful smile. "He told me something I could do to help me with my task. I would need to learn a new spell." He said.
Draco growled at them. "I am not a dog." He said.
"That will be cruel. Let's do that," I said closing and locking the cage.
"Now the second thing if your done yelling. Is that vampires mate ones they are seventeen can have children and get pregnant. Male and female." Mad eye said.
I ran back to the room and liad down in bed with Harry.
"That you were running late. And that it will not matter much anyway. You would have just seen me get in and out of the water." He said shrugging a bit.
"I promise." I said knowing I may not be anble to keep this.
"Yes, I did. May I have some blood?" he asked.
Harry and I got ready for bed and Harry walked out of the bathroom. I pushed him against a wall and began kissing him. I used a spell to make him not get pregnant and began taking off his clothes.
"Why? Is something wrong?" He asked, making me straddle him and face him.
"You have no need to apologize. Sorry for making you run into me love." I said. I kissed him then got up and helped him up as well.
He pushed me completely to the wall, his body pressing against mine. He stopped kissing my lips and began kissing my jaw and neck.
"Can I go with next time my Harry?" I said and used the puppy eyes on him.
"Yes dray. Why do you keep asking?" I said.
"Harry. Open up love." Draco said, knocking on the door. There was no answer. "Come on love. I am worried about you." He said.
"Don't lie to me! Crucio!" He yelled. I blacked out from the pain.
The two people walked in. "If you are never going to speak then there is no point in trying anymore." She shouted a spell and I felt intense pain and blacked out.
"Until I stop. My ickle Dracy-" and he cut me off by kissing me. Though I'm not complaining.
"Whatever." He said as we sat at our normal places.
I opened it and saw viles of the potion we made yesterday.
"Basically I accept there relationship." Pansy said.
"What did you do harry?" I said, sitting next to him.
I felt searing pain meaning my Harry is being hurt. "Don't worry Draco we will find him." Pansy said.
Pansy rolled her eyes and said, "Diseases can still be transmitted. It's not all about making sure that Harry does not get pregnant." Pansy said.
"Okay Draco. Slow down." He said trying to pull me back and walk next to him.
"I love you to. I really am sorry that I forced you to sleep." He said.
"Lockhart. He's famous. I don't see why all the girls love him." Ron muttered.
I blushed. "Yes. But I'm not telling." I said.
Ron frowned and walked out of the room, coming back with Ginny's Unicorn, Sparkle. "There, he is not alone anymore." Ron said taking my hand. We went down stairs where every one was ready to go.
"No. I don't know who is." Harry said.
At that no one said anything.
"Harry come on. Just open up. I smell blood. Alohomora." Draco said, trying to open the door. The door did not open and
Finely Harry came back without the dragon. He got the egg and ran back into the tent.
"I don't mean to." I said tears running down my face. "The first time I was trying to protect him. Voldemort was threatening me. I just want him back. I never wanted to hurt him." I admitted.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
I put my arm around him and we went to potions.
Harry p.o.v
"Okay." I said, hugging him closer.
"I don't want to." I said and yawned.
Harry buried his face to my chest. "We will be there soon." Harry said.
He just held me tighter. "You fell asleep during dinner. So I took you to bed and fell asleep with you." Draco said. I nodded. "Okay." I said.
I took it and just looked at the knife thinking about it with my blood on it. "Harry. you okay?" Draco asked.
I looked at Harry and said, "Sorry about my elf." I said apologetically.
Just as I was about to make the cut to end it I felt some one grab me. The person took the glass away and held me still.
It was an apology letter. And it ended saying that he hopes I'll be happy with Mason.
Today, I woke up all cuddled to Draco, who is now me fiance. It's strange to think about him as one though, I'm so used to him being my boyfreind.
We sat in the couch and Draco said. "I was an idiot to let you go like that and think you would forgive me. I'll never leave you like that again."
I looked at Harry who looks completely confused. It makes sense with the whole mated to werewolf and able to get pregnant thing. Wait. Is "in heat" another way of 'the time of month?' Does that mean this will happen once a month?!?!?!!!!?!?!??????!!!!?!?.
"Well I just wanted to let you know that Peter Pettigrew was not found. On Voldemort they found a letter saying that he will finish his work, so just be careful. You may floo to Saint Mungo's." Dumbledore said, pointing to the fire place.
Harry P.O.V
"So, Hogwarts is starting tomorrow. Do you know who Ms. Umbrige is?" Dad said as we began eating.
"The egg," I said pointing at the golden egg.
"I think he is just messing with you Harry," Hermione said.
"Yes. did you two?" Harry asked to them.
She looked at me and said, "I can tell. That was a girly move, Dray."
A few hours later Ginny came down with green frizzy hair and acne all over her face. "Did you six have anything to do with this!" she shrieked.
"Thanks a lot, Ron now he is in overprotective mode," Harry said.
"Sixth year was around the start of the war. Malfoy and I had been dating for two years then. I had told him everything and I thought he loved me. But he at one point took me off to the bathroom and I thought that something different was going to happen. But then I noticed that he seemed slightly upset. He told me that we need to breakup. I thought that it was because he is being forced into the light side. And that me and my friends and Dumbldore can protect him. But he told me that he willingly went to the dark side. That he never loved me. He was doing it for fame. The one time I thought it was a lie was when he helped me and my friends. But he never apologized. Even after I saved him." I said feeling tears come to my eyes.
"Hello Draco." He said. I saw that Harry is making cake batter. I tried to take some, but Harry slapped my hand away. "No batter. Now can you get me the cake pan?" He said.
"Yes Draco shut up!" I said.
He hugged me. "I love you to. Thank you dray."Â  He said.
"So are we going to go or not?" Sirius said.
"I slept great. We all did since we did not need to listen to you talk or anything in your sleep." Ron said.
"So that means I can't be with her?" Ron said.
"I don't know. But we have classes." I said and got up.
Draco is staring at me and Ron is complaining about him.
Everybody just came in, ignoring us and doing there own thing. There were a few  first years who glanced at us. But I'm sure
A while later class was dismissed and we went to lunch.
"With my eyes closed and cuddled to you." I replied.
"Nothing important. Harry if you get any more letters from this b*** give them to me." Draco said.
"Hmm. Light." I said and leaned back against him.
The rest of the month nothing really interesting happened. But it's getting closer to Christmas and we can go to Hogsmeade. Or at least I can Â - Harry doesn't have a guardian to sign. I wanted to stay with him but he told me to go and he can do homework. So I promised to get him something.
I whinned and got up to and got ready putting in the girl uniform. "You look pretty my harry." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
"Hey May, I was wandering if you would like to go to the Yule Ball?" Ron asked.
"No Ginny. I'm gay and love Draco, so leave me alone." I said, shoving her, but she won't budge.
We figured out the horcrox that we have is a fake. So we apeareated to Grimuald place were Sirius and Remus is. When we walked in Sirius hugged us. "We're have you been every one is worried about you!" Remus yelled.
"I-I'm sorry. But what happened? Is Sirius okay?" I said.
That just leaves Draco and the little girl. I looked at my watch and there is only ten minutes left. I cut both Draco's and the girls rope and swam back with both of them.
"You have been spending to much time with Draco." Ron said.
"Then why are we laughing?" I said, smirking.
Into the morning I gave him the potion after making sure that was it.
"Um. He was locked in a tower." Hermione said.
"But they taste terrible. Plus it's like fake happiness." I said, slouching in my seat.
"You still seem upset. You were also crying in your sleep." Draco said.
"Is it true that you shouted at Umbrjge?"
"Well, I guess we have our answer." As we went around the corner we saw Headmaster Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape, and Lockheart.
"Okay. Well, it's time to go let's get our stuff." He said.
I looked at Harry and smiled. He is so peaceful in his sleep. I wish none of these bad things happened to him. When I finished packing, I got into bed with Harry and fell asleep.
Ginny is not a little, and we are like brother and sister. Really, she only likes stuffies because they calm her when she has a nightmare, or if she is just aggravated. The softness helps.
So we did just that.
"Fine. Still a little shocked to Draco kissing me." I said the blush coming back.
"Well then I guess tomorrow we can go see him." Hermione said.
I looked over his shoulder and saw Ginny glaring at me. Will this girl ever give up!? I thought.
I then grabbed some lube and prepared us both. Pushing my fingers into Blaise a little ruffly. "Is the silance wards up?" I asked.
"Mm. Please Draco." I moaned.
"Thank Merlin your safe. After Dumbduck give us the scores I'm taking you to the hospital wing." I said.
"Yeah sure. I'm sure they're not that bad. I mean, as you said, girls do it all the time," Ron said.
"I guess that could be it." I said.
"Yep. Blaise must be hungry." Hermione said.
"Well, we must be off. Come Dobby I'll see you over the summer Harry." And Mr. Malfoy walked off.
"So I've heard." I said, doing the same.
"See ya Professor ." I called as we walked out of his office.
"Then why are you blushing?" Blaise said, smirking.
I got on top of Harry and began kissing him. Harry kissed back pulling me close. I nibbled at his lip asking for entrance that he kindly gave. My tongue explored every inch and crevasse of Harry's mouth as Harry lightly moaned. I then began trailing kisses down Harry's jawline and neck. He gave me complete access and I bit down.
"What do you need?" George said.
Though, I have given everything he asked and tried to make sure he was happy. We decided to have the wedding after he had the kid... or kids never asked what the gender is or how many we were having, but the important thing is that the kid or kids is healthy.
"So Harry next month is the next task. You ready?" Hermione asked.
After a few moments I yelled Mason's name and came, as Mason came into me. He pulled out and collapsed next to me.
Then I realized that Cedric is dead. Everyone seemed to come to the same realization because everyone became silent except for his father who was saying, "my boy! My precious boy!" And he came over.
I thought about telling her but decided that it would be good for of I want Potter to not do that. "I have no idea Pansy."
Harry p.o.v
The Prophet came and it said that I attempted suicide again, but I am okay and alive. They believe it is part of me being insane.
"Oh Harry you are beautiful!" Hermione said as she came to make sure I am ready.
He took it then handed it to Dobby. He looked out the windows asking me about my adventure and I mouthed 'open it.' To Dobby.
"McGonagal needs to see us!" Hermione said through the door, sounding angry.
"Well, your not his dominant or his boyfriend so I can make him do what I want," I said smirking.
"Yes Hermione?" I said as Harry continued whatever he is doing.
"Okay. Well, it's dinner time. We should probably get back to Ron and Hermione before they thinkÂ you kidnapped me." I said and tried to get up.
"Of course my Draco." He said.
"Yes. well I hope yeh make Harry happy, 'cause he needs it. And Harry, try ter be careful this year." Hagrid said.
"I was only gone for twenty minutes Draco. But I'm happy my little puppy missed me." He said, petting my head.
I glared at him because I should make Harry that happy. "Now may you all start your classes and fill your minds with the information you all seek." Dumbledore said, dismissing us.
â¢~â¢Time Skipâ¢~â¢
"Or you can ask boys and turn gay." Harry said.
"So what do you want to do now?" Draco asked.
"We may have Voldemort gone, but we still need to worry about wormtail. He says that he wants to finish Voldemort's work, but how?" Hermione said.
Every one looked shocked.
"What are you laughing at? You look nice and I am wearing this." Ron said, moving his arms for effect.
"You just slept." I said.
I noticed that all music has stopped and everyone is looking at us.
He put on gloves and got our books.
I have heard good things about Mad Eye. Like the fact that he is an Auror and a friend of Dumbledore's. He took out a jar of spiders. "Who knows the three unforgivable curses?" He asked and looked around. "Mr. Malfoy name one." He said.
"Ron you are acting like a child." I pointed out.
I frowned and said, "I hope Draco and his parents are okay."
I turned to ask what. But then he pushed me onto a wall and kiss me hard. I froze not sure what to do. Then Draco pulled away fear in his eyes."m-malfoy?" I asked.
"They are insane." Draco said shaking his head.
"Please guys. Can't you just let me think about it? When I'm done I can tell you." I said, wanting to end the conversation.
"Five days." My father, Lucius, said solemnly.
The next day we went to the train and I said by to every one. Remus told Draco not to have sex with me again. Sirius juts told us to have fun. Then winked at Draco.
Once once lunch was over with we went back. And I still had no Harry.
Once classes were over we began our homework in the Slytherin common room this time. The Slytherin all said nothing. Just ignored us allowing us to do our own thing.
"Thank you, Draco," I said leaning against him.
After thirty minutes I heard Draco yell, "HARRY JAMES POTTER GET YOUR BUTT UP HERE NOW!"
"Harry, come on. Simba will be here when we get back." Ron said.
"Yes and they are inviting you, your mom, your dad, and us. It's going to be so great." Hermione said, smiling.
So I did what any sane person would do. I got a knife and rope. I got a stool and tied a noose. Then I slit both my wrists put the rope around my neck. Then I kicked the stool from under me. Then every thing turned black.
I laughed and went to my room so I can get some sleep.
We became silent and Hermione said, "I guess it's time to go back to hogwarts."
We went to our room and everyone is getting ready for bed.
"So he is taking Voldemort's place?" I asked.
She then took my hand and led me over to Remus and Sirius. They took my hand and led me down the isle to Draco. We're we finally got married.
I saw Hermione begin to to question about what kind of werewolf I was before she was cut off by the other two boys, "Why?", She then huffed, blowing a strand of hair out of her face.
"Harry, how did you get here early?" Snape asked.
She pushed me onto her bed as she looked through her trunk. "Yes i believe this would be your size." Ginny said taking out a bra.
In the morning we got up and got ready for the day. Ron and Blaise are not awake yet, but we decided to let them sleep. We went down to the Great Hall and began eating. Pansy and Hermione came in with Ron and Blaise not to far behind.
We began eating and Mason said, "What's so great?"
Draco and I went in and got food and Butter beers.
"I want to know what it's like." I said.
"Yes sir." I said. "Yes. All ready." Harry said.
"The next champion is;" The same thing happened, "From Durmstrang: Victor Krum!"
I kissed back and wonder what will happen if Ron comes in here. I mean, we share our room. He would have Blaise come in here at night and they will snog each other.
"So how was your two's night?" Hermione asked.
"Walking." I said trying to go around again.
Okay, so harry must have done something that I don't know about. But what? I mean i have slacked off on checking him for cuts, but he should not do that. Must be the potion. How could he do that? I'm sure I would have known.
"We also need to go to Diagon Alley," I pointed out.
I nodded and looked at the last gift that is a small box and reached for it.
When I finished and sent it off Harry came over and said, "you know we will be seeing them soon."
"I would, but you're too cute. So no." I said and kissed his nose. Some more girls awed and fangirled, which made Harry blush even more.
After a few minutes of me sucking he had me stop and made me suck his fingers putting saliva on them. He the. Placed one finger into my butt and I moaned pushing down. Draco smiled and put in another finger. I moaned and closed my eyes as he put anather finger in and began thrusting them in and out.
"What's happened Hagrid?" I asked.
"Harry was healed," I said as Harry and Ginny came over the wall holding onto the tail of the Phoenix.
Ron p.o.v
"I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do about that." Dumbledore said.
When we both came I collapsed next to him and held him close.
After the party he came over and handed me the present. I smiled and opened it to see a green dragon. I smiled thinking that this just makes Harry even cuter.
"Yes. My Mother will also send me my own. She said she could get Harry some, but I told her I'll take care of it." I answered.
I knocked on the door and it creaked open. "Hello Draco, Potter and friends. Come in." He said stepping aside.
I woke up with Harry cuddled into my side. I smiled and lightly shook Harry awake. He looked at me and smiled. "Morning Draco." He said.
I ran, slipping pass the death eaters, all the way to Gryffindor Tower and I saw my freinds sitting with Draco, Blaise, and Pansy.
And I finally fell asleep dreaming of Harry.
I woke with Draco in our dorm room. As much as I love to be back at home with Draco I missed hogwarts. I cuddled up to draco enjoying his warmth. But Draco then shifted and looked down at me. "Morning harry." Draco said stretching and yawning.
"I ruined everything mom. I don't know how to get Harry back." I said.
"But. I should have done somthing. I could have." Ron said.
"He would love to," Draco said smiling.
They nodded.
So we went up to our room. When Ron pulled his covers from his bed Lucif the snake hissed at Ron causing him to scream then pass out. Luckily he fell into Blaise's arms.
"Honestly weasel."
I walked through the woods in my wolf form. It's been two weeks since Harry disappeared. I went to a river to drink, when I found a bloody body. I quickly jumped in,grabbed it, and swam back to shore. I turned human and when I turned the body over I saw that it is Harry all filthy and bloody. I used a cleaning spell and fixed his clothes. I smelled two scents that I will never forget. Ginny and Wormtail. I growled and teleported to Hogsmead and carried Harry to Hogwarts. When I got to the hospital wing, Pomfrey began fussing over him as McGonagall, Snape, Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Pansy came in.
"Fine. If it will make you happy." He said and got up.
I followed him. "Just pray that your date won't leave." I said.
He nodded and followed me up stairs. I walked into my room and placed both the trunks in front of my bed. "You can place our owls on my dresser." I said.
Once we were ready we both got into bed and fell asleep, Harry curled up to me and I put my arms around him.
"What did you say?" I asked.
"Well, maybe you should wait until they're not doing anything important. And making Harry trust you is the most important thing. Hang out with him, show him you can be better than last year. Plus, if you want to impress him with quidditch, you do have a game in a week. Practice and if he sees you practicing, then it might show him you can commit yourself to something." She said picking up her book again. "Now, I am going to read. Go do something. Think about what I said," she added.
Damn. Why can't classes be over all ready!?
After shopping, Hermione went back to the Burrow with us and her parents went home.
I nodded and he walked out.
"Yes." I said and we walked to the room.
Harry fell asleep and I looked at Pansy. "When should we tell them. I miss mean with Dumbledore. " I said, not finishing.
"Well yes. She did." Dumbledore said.
I took him by the hand and had him be right next to me.
"Yes you are. You are the most beautiful, strong, and amazing person I have ever met." I said and kissed the top of his head.
"Well, we are going to leave you two alone. Come on Ron." Hermione said walking out.
"That's what I said." I replied laughing.
"They're putting Buckbeak down. I'm not sure when though." Hagrid said.
We then went to the great hall and none of our friends asked what happened.
"Night Ron." I said and we fell asleep.
"Okay. Where is Hermione?" I asked.
I began looking around and noticed that Harry was about to take a handful of the snaps. And he got some before I can warn him. They began attacking him and backed him into a wall.
I licked his lips, wanting entrance, which he gave. I explored every crevasse.
I woke up and looked around. The man is not here and the lights are back on. The train is also moving.
When we were about half way there Draco came running to us. "He said that he will stop making up lies. And that he is sorry. Though I think he is lying."
"The room of requirement." I answered.
"Of course. You can stay till the end of the next task." Dumbledore said.
"Why the snake?" Pansy asked.
They bid us good morning and sat down across from us. Ron immediately began stuffing his face.
"Gillyweed could work. I'm not sure how to get it though." Longbottom said.
"Love you to draco." I said cuddling up to him.
I did not respond. I just pulled off Harry's jeans and boxers, then my own. I pushed him onto the bed with me on top. "Are you ready love?" I asked and nibbled on his ear.
"You don't have to be. It's fine. The minister will be here any minute. Then Umbridge and Snape. After and when we get back to the common room I'll like you to tell me why your crying." Draco said.
I smirked. "Well there is no way to hide them so let's get ready." I said. I got up and Harry did to.
I glared at him and said, "I don't care."
We placed it on a rock.
"I wonder if they are adding any more years on her sentence." Harry said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Probably. You can come to our common room after." Harry said.
Both Pansy and Hermione glared at Ron and Pansy said. "Um hello. Me and Hermione."
"Yes. Why would I not? I will do anything you want." I said. I think it was the silliest question in the world.
"Men." Pansy and Hermione said at the same time.
I went to Harry's room. "Hey Harry. Do you think your friends and there family can come to my house for Christmas?" I asked.
"Mr. Potter please see me after class. You are not in trouble." Snape said, walking by.
We both got ready for bed and went to sleep.
"But then Hermione will be upset that you are not getting good sleep for classes and she will blame me." Draco said.
"Since I asked for her help with making Harry like me," I said.
I shook my head quickly and he seemed a little calmer. "Does anyone know?" I shook my head and he then said, "alright since by mate law I will let you live with me but we need to tell the ministry and Dumbledore. We will also need to get you, new guardians. My parents can't since I am your mate."
"No problem Harry, and I love you too. Would you like for me to finish lunch?" Mason asked.
"Hello Mrs and Mr Malfoy." Harry said nervously, looking down.
"Look there are spells in this book to." Harry said. He tried one and sent Ron to hang by his foot in the air.
He nodded and we done our home work.
"Yes, but I will do it later." He said as we sat down and he put his arm around my shoulders.
"Hello Draco." I said and tryed to continue walking.
I saw Remus nod and say. "I have looked things up about people who do that, and one reason for it is to relieve stress. But I have seen other things about how people do it because it helps give them the childhood they wanted. Or that they want their Significant other to take care of them."
"I talked to Blaise. I am not sure what happened. He just kept yelling at me." Ron said.
One of them was Bellatrix. "How are you Draco? You mutt." She said.
"You look adorable," Draco said coming out of the bathroom wearing a dark blue t-shirt and normal boy jeans.
So, we finally got up and dressed, then we went down to the Great Hall.
"Hey, darling are you okay?" I asked walking in.
I turned into my human self. "You had a nightmare, so I came to see if you were okay." I said.
When I got to Ms Mcgonagals office she had me sit down and said, "is it true you talked back to  Ms. Umbrige."
The loading on the train to Hogwarts was eventful enough on its own, but not as much as when I was on the train. Definitely not.
"No you don't." He said and drank the potion.
I could tell that he is lying. "Have you been taking the potion? If its not working I can have Severus make a stronger one." I said.
"Harry I will love to, but It will be best to wait a bit. I promise I will do this with you. I will do you anyway you want." He said, placing a hand on my cheek and making me aroused.
"Okay. We will after lunch." Draco said and we began to eat.
"Well, I think that Draco got a good mate. So you really are not the heir are you?" Blaise said.
That glared at me and continued eating.
"You plainly said don't have sex. Which, we did not." Harry mumbled.
I frowned and said, "wait. So. You don't feel like eather a boy or girl?"
"I think Harry liked it." Fred smirked sitting down on one side of me.
I noticed that the bedroom door is open, so I closed it and made sure that I have Harry's antidepressant potion. Harry woke up and frantically looked around till he saw me. "You okay harry?" I asked.
Draco smirked and said, "something."
"You two are just so cute together." Pansy said with a hand over her heart.
I hugged him and said, "it's alright."
"Mad and upset. You are not mad at me for accepting..him...right? oh and thanks for leaving me back there," I asked him, looking at him accusingly near the end.
After about two hours Harry seemed to not go to sleep. I acted like I woke up. "Are you okay Harry?" I asked.
"Floo. I have been having trouble sleeping, too. Sleep now, my little mate. I'm here." Draco said, running his fingers through my hair. I cuddled into him. For once this summer, falling into a peaceful sleep.
We did not see Ginny for the rest of the ride.
"We have to go. We need to get ready for Hogwarts." Hermione said.
Harry woke up as Madam Pomfrey came in. "I can mend bones easily, but growing them back is a whole other thing." She said, handing him a potion.
I began pacing, which is really hard to do in crowded stands. Hermione grabbed my shoulders and forced me to sit.
"Morning Draco. Sleep well?" He asked.
Harry's P.O.V
"Tasting you!" I replied happly.
"No. But it was still the best I've been on Draco." I said and kissed him.
"You will look great though." He said.
After shopping we stopped at the leaky cauldron and ate lunch. "Have any of you visited Voldemort?" I asked.
"Morning girls." Me Harry Blaise and Ron said together.
We clapped then continue the day normally.
"I bet those twins won't be caught dead with you now," I said laughing.
One week later and Ron still does not have a date. A few boys have tried to ask me out though Draco did in front of everyone.
"Sorry man. But don't worry I'll try again." Blaise said.
The rest of our room mates came in and told us that it was really funny.
"Oh it's okay. I mean you have a life outside of here. I wish I can go out." Tom said and looked out a window.
"But I feel like a girl so I have a right to act like one! Now stop smooshing me." Harry said.
He waved my hand off and snuggled more into my chest. I pushed him off me, so he is laying on his back, and kissed his lips. His eyes opened and he started to kiss back. I pulled away, smirking. "That's a nice way to wake up. Come back." He said and pulled me back in.
I tried to find the name and realized two things: One, pictures don't appreciate waking up at night with light in their face. Two, I forgot my cloak. But I did not turn around I kept walking. I glanced down at my map and saw that I am close to Peter. I looked around and according to my map, he just passed me. I looked around and Snape is coming my way.
I got his present and handed him his. Mine is filled with candy and a few roses and a stuffed snake.
"Do not." I said.
"Shut up Blaise or I will have my brother send a dragon after you!" Ron yelled and everyone in the hall laughed, Including Blaise.
"But... Draco... I can't... Breathe..." he said and continued to laugh. "Fine! Fine!Â I'm sorry... Your joke was... hilarious!"
It would be cute seeing Harry cuddling a stuffie in a onesie, with a paci. Maybe even drinking out of a sippy cup.
"Get through the circle-" They said, holding up two vials with some kind of potion.
Harry p.o.v (a week later.)
"Oh Draco pleas go faster. Pleas." I said breathlessly.
I got on top of him straddling his waist. Then I bit into his neck. He moaned as I drank his blood.
"Well that's because we don't do that in this room." Draco said, smirking.
Draco p.o.v
"What does Ron mean by last year you faced He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named?" I asked.
"Whatever," Ron said and began stuffing his face as Blaise rolled his eyes at Draco.
Ron and I took everything to his room that he said we can share. I wonder what he will think once I tell him.
"It's cute on him," I replied and pushed him out of my room. "Now good night," I said and slammed the door.
"We need to get up." Draco said making no movement.
We looked through the pages for about an hour and learned about all the animals and mermaids in the lake. "This seems scary." Harry said.
"Thank you. You look hot by the way." I said.
"She gave me a biscuit and we talked." I answered.
"Of course. I always will. What happened was not your fault. I will love you till I die. Even after I will always love you." I said.
"We came here to tell you two that McGonagall needs to speak to you two." Hermione said.
"You can tell me anything mate. I promise I won't react badly," he said sitting next to me.
"What do you want Harry?" He asked, moving his hands to my hips, holding me down.
I thought about what to say. I remember dad telling me that he is Harry's Godfather. Well, Harry, he's a mass murder and guess what? He's also your Godfather! Suprise!Â I then said. "Nobody you need to worry about. Just some bad guy."
"Yes. Well, I could go back with one other person and save Sirius and Buckbeak." Hermione said.
"I did not. Just a lucky caunsidence." Draco said shrugging.
"Harry are you sure your okay?" Ron asked.
"We should get to dinner." Hermione said, putting the book back onto its shelf.
"Ginny. If Harry does not accept Malfoy as his mate, then Malfoy will die." Hermione said.
"Slept in." Blaise answerd.
"Draco don't scare him. I'm still yours so don't worry." Harry said.
Me and Harry laughed making Blaise glare at us. Wich just made us laugh harder.
"Well I will still like to know what is wrong." Hermione said.
I then came into his mouth and he swolowed it. He then came back up and kissed me. "We should start getting ready." He said and got up.
He went to his trunk and took out a few letters. "She's been sending me these." He said and handed them to me.
"Thank you professor." I said and walked out to Harry.
"Sure. We can after the holidays." I said, happy that I can now move into Draco's room.
"Fine you queer." She scoffed, disgusted, and stomped back to her dorm.
Hermione and Pansy rolled there eyes and began talking about girl things.
The next morning I woke up and Lucif is wrapping himself around Ron's neck.
When I got on I sat down with Harry and our freinds. "You sent it?" Hermione asked.
I pulled Harry close and lightly kissed him. "You done really good Harry." I said.
He opened the box and looked suprised. "It's a promise ring." I said. He looked at me strangely, so I sat right next to him and took it out of the box. It's flame red with a snake in the shape of a heart. "I promise that I will always love you no matter what." I said and put it on his right ring finger.
"Oh. I didn't see a cat." Draco said with a slight frown.
"Ron I don't even see your problem with it. And I technically did not promise." He said and laughed a little.
"Good." Hedwig came with the newspaper and Harry gave her some bread.
"In our third year of summer, you were jumping on the bed singing into one instead of brushing your hair," Draco said smirking.
"I missed you to." He said into my neck.
Once we had calmed down he laid back down on his bed "Okay, g' night Mate." Ron stifled his laughter and went to sleep.
I shifted into my wolf and began running, leaving my friends behind. Dont worry Harry I will find you.
"Sorry we were spending or limited alone time together." I said glaring at her.
I sighed and said, "A soul mate means that we are destined to be with each other."
"Harry have you taken the potion that Snape gave you?" I asked.
"He is safe." I said.
"Fine. I will get it tomorrow. How are you and Blaise?" I said, wishing I said I will not be okay around Ginny.
When we got to Hogwarts, we noted that we still had all the same teachers from last year, including Remus.
I feel as though it has been forever,but now I am laying in a hospital bed after a whole bunch of pain. I have finally had my child. Draco then came in with a doctor, who is holding a little child wrapped in a blue blanket.
"Yeah. We should go back to our dorms and get some sleep." Draco said.
Draco pushed me into the bed all fours and she I'm still good from last night he pushed inside me and began pulling out and pushing in.  He grabbed my dick and stroking it in time with his thrust. He then leaned over and began biting my neck cousing more pleasure to run through my body.
The men turned to us and we began fighting.
We opened the door. "Jeez you two are like rabbits." Draco said. They jumped apart and luckily are not completely undressed.
That night I got bored and decided to go to Harry. I know last time I got in truble but, I did not get to spend much time with him this year. And I really want to see him. So I got up and went to the fire place. I grabbed some floo, and went off.
"What was that?" Harry said.
"So my dad said that he will try what he can against Umbitch." I said.
"No no no. You are just fine." I said and hugged him.
We layed there in silence for a bit, but then there was a knock on the door. Draco unlatched himself from me and I sat up.
For the rest of the night we drank and I got an owl from Scorpio telling us that he misses us and loves us. We quickly sent one back saying good luck and goodnight and that we love him.
"Oh it's so cute." Hermione said petting it.
I am not paying attention and playing with Harry's hair. "Draco. Pleas listen." Remus said.
"You're wearing a dress." The other twin said.
Harry cuddled me. "I don't want to go to classes today." He said.
We reluctantly got up and fixed our selves then went down stairs.
I looked over and Ginny is standing there, her hair a mess and a crazy look in her eye. "He is mine you crazy bitch." I said.
"Yes-"
After I was done getting dress robes and he chose twenty shirts and trousers, we left. "Draco. why did you buy all this for me?" I asked exasperatedly, as we went to Honeydukes.
"Don't you dare lie to me! Lupisnis Protome!" She screeched, aiming her wand at me before I could even think of doing anything.
I looked again and half of the bite mark was shown. I grinned, knowing we were going to get a lecture from Hermione later.
That night Harry woke from another nightmare claiming that Moldy Wart is mad. I'm just glad that tomorrow that Harry will be able to start learning Occlamancy.
"Well there. There is Crucio." He stammered.
"A human." Me and Pansy said.
"But I'd doubted you. I was not able to stop Ginny and your always asking me if I'm alright and I hurt myself." He said.
"Yeah. A normal blissful year." Harry replied.
"It does not matter Draco. Come on. Get up and let's go." He said, standing up.
Draco growled at her. We then got chased around. I broke the orb and then we got to the other doors. Ron got attacked by brains. Kind of funny.
We nodded and laughed. "That is true, but having kids is nice " Hermione said.
Me, Harry, and both his friends are sharing a compartment and we are talking about how our last day at home was. For Harry it was my Manor.
*Draco's P.O.V. *
And I'm quite sure I heard Malfoy say under his breath. " I'll get you back Potter."
Hermione helped us choose the right door which led to a room full of glowing white orbs.
Harry woke up and looked at the two of us. He seemed both surprised and confused.
We then all cling onto the Phoenix - Lockheart too - and flew back to the bathroom
"I'm sorry Blaise. I mean it was not before we left." Ron said.
"I decided to stay with Draco for the night. There is nothing wrong with that." Harry replied.
"No need to apologize, you did no harm," Harry said and smiled up at me.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"I am trying to be nice this year. And I have been meaning to talk to you." He replied.
"How dare you talk like that to me mutt!" She yelled. Harry tried to get closer to me, but he already is practically sitting on my lap.
No I don't have Harry.
When I made it to the hall in saw Harry talking to ron and Hermione and he Is obviously making sure to keep his voice down.
Harry's p.o.v
After breakfast we went to our first class which is defense with Slytherins.
"Nothing," I said.
I am waiting for Draco to return to the dorm with the Gilly weed. I have been released from the hospital and have been getting better with what has been going through my head.
So we deemed Sirius innocent. Remus and Sirius are helping Snape out and Draco and I are helping Ron out as Hermione keeps Wormtail in line.
"No, a little longer." He said hugging me to him.
When they were on the ground again and Ginny ran over to Ron I hugged Harry and kissed him. "What happened to your arm?" I asked grabbing his arm and looked at the blood.
"Yeah Blaise. Harry can go with one night without me." Draco said like he is speaking to an idiot.
"Well, thanks for being okay with it." I said.
I set her on Draco's bed and pouted saying "you're mean." I then looked at Draco with puppy dog eyes and said, "can I pweas keep the wabbit Dwayco."
"So what should we do?" Draco asked.
Mr. Crouch came up and asked to talk to Harry but I said. "sorry sir but no. Harry is going to be needing rest and a shower then he will go to the hospital wing. Sorry." And began leading Harry away.
"How are you Harry?" I asked as I saw that he is wearing girlish clothes.
Well, at least he is enjoying himself,Â I thought.
When he pulled away I smiled and said, "morning Draco."
"Hmm?" Was his reply.
"Why did you want to leave Harry?" Draco asked.
Once I got an explanation draco said, "okay you all can stay here. Me and Harry will find Snape, Ron and Blaise go to the Chamber of secrets, Pansy and Hermione find the diadem."
"So you both ready for school?" Lucius asked.
"Wait Harry. If you feel like neather a boy or girl what pronouns do we use?" I asked.
I looked at Blaise and he seemed a bit disappointed. "Don't worry Ron I'm sure you will find someone."
"Im here. Harry I am so sorry. I hope you can forgive me." Hermione said and broke down.
"Okay." He said.
"No. Your not. Come on." Mom said pulling me up and dragging me to the dining room. "You can't think of ways to get back Harry on an empty stomach." She said placing food in front of me.
"I think it smells like you." I said.
"But they are not the good ones." Ron said.
"Yeah. loads of Draco." Ron said and began eating.
Hermione yelled at Ron this morning, then at me because I defended him. So I put on the horcrux. Even though no one wants me to because it effects me worse than anyone. But it's only fair.
*Draco P.O.V*
I looked at Harry and he looked like he is about to cry. He ran out and everyone is whispering about him.
Though at this moment is not what I should be thinking about. It's the last calss of the day Defance against the dark arts. And I heard our teacher is bad. Fred and George told us.
So we picked up our books and began reading.
The adults came and we left.
He showed me and I saw the words 'I must not tell lies' etched on his hand. He started sniffling. "I'm sorry Draco, but she made me. I'm sorry." He said.
We made it to Myrtle bath room and I used parsle tung to open the sinks. Blaise looked at me weird so I said, "Harry talks in his sleep."
"Hey Blaise and Ron." I replied.
I pulled off my cloak and said, "Snape killed Dumbldore!"
"Your mum." Blaise said, smiling.
"I would much rather stay here," Harry said.
After all our classes we began on home work. Snape walked in and handed Draco the extra potions.
My scar began to burn and I stumbled a bit but Draco held on to me.
McGonagall gasped. Snape looked emotionless as Dumbledore nodded, frowning.
After breakfast me, Harry, Ron, Blaise, and Hermione went to the room Sirius chosen for us. We sat down. "Have you read the paper harry?" Hermione said. He shook his head. "Well they are saying that you and Dumbledore are crazy because you are saying Voldemort is back." She said
"Well, I hate spiders. I'm actually quite afraid of them." Ron said looking pale.
"Wait. No Draco. Please don't leave me." I pleaded, grabbing onto his shirt.
Umbridge, a fat lady that looks like a toad, stared at us strangely. So I sneered at her. "You see that lady in pink." I said to Harry. He looked at her then nodded. "That's Umbridge. Promise me you wont make her mad. She is a lady that is not one to make mad." I said.
"That was a dementor. They guard Azkaban but since Sirius Black escaped they are looking for him. Not sure why they attacked you." Professor Lupin said.
When we got out of the tunnel it's night and Crookshanks is still keeping the tree at bay.
"How about you go talk to him now?" Harry asked.
"Your welcome Draco. I love you too." I said kissing Drago.
As Harry slept I thought about it. What if Ginny has been working for Voldemort? She did not get the diary on accident. She faked it all and wanted Harry.
"Yeah. What are you wearing to the ball?" I asked.
We went to lunch. "Are you going to wake him?" Hermione asked.
"Yes. Just please don't tell anyone. I promised the Ministry that you won't." I said.
Good news though. My arousal is gone. Bad news. Harry is still trying to make it come back, so I took Harry's hand and placed it on his plate of scramble eggs.
"Has he done this before?" Snape asked.
"Because I am. Now let's go." He said and we all went to pitch up a tent and then to the stadium.
"Why is this following you?" He asked.
"Yea probably." He said.
"I know harry. Don't worry you'll be okay." I said and kissed him.
When we woke up it was really early and Harry had to go to his dorm for his uniform, so I got ready for the day.
"Of course." I said.
"I am sure that Dobby would be more than happy to serve your family." Draco said.
Draco p.o.v
"So Harry since your the captain for the Quidditch team will you pick me?" Ron asked.
He grinned and said, "okay, yeah, let's get ready."
"Because you had sex with Harry!" Ron said.
I smirked. "Well it's not my fault that Harry tastes and looks good." I pulled him closer and licked his cheek.
I ignored them again as Umbridge came through. I still blocked them out as they yelled and talked, then Umbridge went away with the minister.
"No. Do you think we should?" Pansy asked.
"I am really getting tired of people getting into our business." Draco said.
Draco p.o.v
"Hey Harry. You ready to go to the hospital wing?" I asked.
When I finished Harry spoke up. "I'm fine. Just had to relive some bad...Memories." He said,  his eyes tearing up.
Then we got to the vault room and the whole Order of the Phoenix came over. Sirius was almost struck by the killing curse, but I jumped in front and took it.
Slughorn has us working separately so I can not help Harry.
"No. I'm getting him a promise ring. I will in seventh year if that makes you fell better." He said.
"Of course dear Draco. You may do what you wish." Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye.
So after classes we walked around Hogwarts, me trying to pick up Remus's scent. But sadly I found nothing. I sighed. "Sorry but I got nothing." I said.
"So? It is funny." I said and Draco poked me in the ribs.
I got everything and went back to Draco, setting it all on the table. "Are you sure your okay Harry? I'm sure we can go back to our room. Tell Snape your not feeling well." Draco said, concerned.
"A little nervous about meeting your parents. What if they dont like me?" He said.
"Wow, Ron never knew you would be gay for someone.Â " I said and Draco laughed.
Harry p.o.v
"I don't want anything." I said, knowing it wouldn't work.
"Alright Harry. See ya!" She said and walked off.
Ron p.o.v
We both got ready and I put on the boy uniform. We went to the great hall and Hermione said, "what took you to so long?"
"I'll think about it." I said. I then started to think about some more stuff I learned about mates. Then I remembered the most important part. I need to mark him. And in order to do that, I need him to drink a little of my blood then place a little of my venom in him.
I sighed and Draco and I got ready for the day and we went to the great hall.
When I got there I turned back to human and quickly got ready for the day.
Me and draco sat near the lake watching the sunrise. When it finished we got up and walked back.
"We have plenty of things," Fred said.
Harry p.o.v
"Well, I'm sure that when the ministry shows up they won't be happy to see you," Hagrid said.
"I need to know how to woo Harry back." I said.
The last day we packed and went to the express. I said by to Hagrid and went on the train. Me, Hermione, Ron, and Draco got a compartment and relaxed.
"Is he laughing at me?" Draco said.
He nodded and went to the teachers table.
"I'm sorry Draco. But it's best for Harry. You will understand in the future." He said.
"You did not understand it?" Luna asked, the only Ravenclaw in there.
I kneeled next to him and tried to touch his shoulder, but he flinched away. "No. Don't touch me please." Harry whimpered.
I ate the gillyweed and almost choked. I was pushed in and began the painful transformation.
"No Ron. Let's spend the rest of our year relaxing." Harry said, smiling.
"Draco, make him want to do homework." Hermione commanded him.
Harry p.o.v
He put an arm around my waist and held me close to him. I ate and saw Blaise said to us, "what is wrong with you and Ron?"
I sighed. "They wanted to know where Tom is. I did not know that it was Ginny and Wormtail till Draco told me." I said.
Me and Draco sat down away from Ginny and said hello to every one.
When we walked into potions Draco said, "Yo Snape. What do you think about Harry wearing heels?"
"Come in and eat. You to Harry you are as skinny as a twig." Ms, Weasly said.
Harry p.o.v
I swear I could just see him holding a free hugs sign.
"You all should come watch-"
"But how will we learn to defend ourselves. Out in the real world?" I asked sassly.
They all became quiet in thought, "I guess... we just have to wait till we find something. Until  then, we should each take turns carrying that thing. It's dark magic, so it could mess with you. I'll go first." Draco said, snatching the horcrux from me and put it on.
"Good job to you to Harry." He said, smiling.
When we waked in all the Weasley's were there except for the ones that didn't go to school anymore. Along with Snape, Mcgonagall, Dumbledore, and Blaise. The flames in the fire place went green as Mr. Malfoy appeared.
"Who cares. Of anyone says anything then I will deal with them." I said.
Harry went back to eating as I looked at the teacher table. Seeing every one is amazed exept for two peaple. Umbrige is glaring at us and Dumbldore is looking at his plate.
I pulled away. " Are you sure that you will be alright being with Ginny for the rest of the summer?" I asked, not wanting him near that b***.
I bet Draco would be so proud of me saving two people at once. There is only a minute left and I am almost there. My hands are webbed and the gills are disappearing.
"I can and I will. My Harry needs me so I'll get him." I said, almost to the doors to go outside.
"I love you Harry thank you so much for taking me back." Draco said kissing me as we walked in.
After eating and talking we went back to hogwarts. Ron and Blaise went inside and I took Harry for a walk around the lake. "I want to know why they wanted to go on a double date." Harry said.
"Draco, dear, the disappointment of a nephew. Dating, the oh so great, Harry Potter, making your mum and dad weak," Bellatrix says, then me and Blaise stupefy her. Fenrir attacked Blaise, and I tried to use a spell to help Blaise, but as soon as I got ready Fenrir ran off leaving behind a bleeding Blaise. All the deatheaters, then, left. Draco started at were Snape laid.
I went back to my compartment with Pansy, Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe. They know everything - including Potter being my soulmate.
I have some old book with a bunch of writing in it. It's by some one called the half blood prince.
I gave her some and said, "I've been great plus your master is the best."
"Please, Harry," I begged.
"Will not. I'll leave you two to it. Though I will gladly help." Hermione said, smiling fondly at us.
"Tonight is the full moon. You ready Draco?" Pansy asked.
When we got to the platform I hugged and kissed Draco good bye and told my freinds good bye. Then I went over to Sirius and Remus. Ready to go home.
We ate then Narcissa went to make cookies and I helped. Draco went somewhere.
"Dude come on. You two are exs. There is no need to be upset." Blaise said.
Harry blushed and looked away. "And how would you know?" Ron asked.
"Father, what do you know about Harry?" I asked.
"Thank you Mason. I love you." I said.
"I don't like the way he smells." He growled.
The next morning we both woke up before every one so we took a quick shower even though Harry's butt hurt. Witch I find quite funny.
Draco looked shocked and turned to Hermione. "Wow. Smarty pants really does know her stuff. " Draco joked, trying to make light of the situation.
"Wait so once Harry is seventeen he can have kids?" Draco asked.
Harry rolled his eyes and said, "He likes you like I like Draco. So I talk to him about it, you idiot."
"I keep getting dreams of Voldemort." I said, burying my face in his neck.
"Crucio. It is a pain curse." He said proudly.
Harry cuddled up to me and kissed my cheek. This is so nice since he ignored me all day. Maybe I'll make him even more happy tonight in bed.
"We could stay here." I said, closing my eyes and leaning against Draco.
"So Draco what did you and Harry do over the summer?" Hermione asked.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
She came in talking to us like kids with almost caused me to slip in to little space. And gave us first year books.
I woke up sweaty and scared. I just had a nightmare of Voldemort. Draco woke up. "What's wrong love?" Draco asked, worried.
Then the twins walked up to the circle the took out two vials of potion and introduced it. The then drank it and walked across the line. Then they were thrown back and had beards on there face. The glared at each other then began fighting as everyone laughed.
"There not real names." Draco said.
"I know how to have fun!" He said glaring at me. "In fact, I was going to ask Dumblyduck if I could take you out on a date. But I guess that since it's fun I can not do that."
"Why is Ron not noticing me. I mean am I not good enough for him?" Blaise whined.
We stayed until visiting time was over and walked out. As we passed the abandoned girls bathroom Ron slipped and I heard a crack. I and Harry looked at him as he took out his wand that is broke in half and hanging by a small piece of wood.
"Harry Potter: gender fluid and gay, dating the Malfoy heir. How surprising. I wonder what the title of the article will be." Rita Skeeter said.
Blaise then moved a bit and mumbled somthing. Then he opened his eyes and groned in pain. Draco got up to get miss Pomfrey. Who came in and began fussing over him. When she finished Blaise is fully awake just laying there an miss Pomfrey walked out, "Blaise you okay?" Ron asked taking his hand.
"Of course." I said and dragged him to the ROR.
"Fine. We were tired of doing so anyways." Ron said glaring at Draco.
I changed into some night pants and went to the forest. After ten minutes I was forcefully changed into my blonde wolf.
"Well, we shouldn't worry. It is only Malfoy after all. Tomorrow we need to get to Hogwarts, let's go to bed." I reminded them.
"Can we please stop talking about sex?" I asked burning my face into Draco's neck.
When we got back to Hogwarts, we went to the room of requirement and began eating candy and talking about what we will do now that we don't have Voldemort breathing down our necks.
After classes we went to the library to do home work and Draco began writing to the ministry. "I'm going to the owlery to send this I'll see you guys at lunch." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
When I woke up Draco wasn't with me. 'Did he leave me? Was I to clingy? Does he not love me?' I thought.
We all went straight to Dumbledore's office and walked in. He looked up from his desk. "Is there somthing wrong?" He asked.
"Well in class I predicted he would die. I didn't mean to, I swear." Ron said, sounding scared.
I pulled him back down to sit on my lap. "Ten more minutes." I said and buried my face in his neck.
He then moved up and had me suck his fingers to get them wet. Then he placed one finger in causing me to gasp.
"We're having fun!"
Time skip to Buckbeak's execution day ð£ðð¢ð­
Sincerely,
"Well I was going to say that Umbridge is back. But on a Slightly stranger note Cedric is to." Hermione said.
"That was amazing. Do it again." Draco said. I chuckled for a moment, then he smashed his face into mine with his tongue down my throat. It felt good feeling him inside of me, but I couldn't wait for the rest to come. He, calmly, unzipped my pants and started pulling them down. We stopped kissing and quickly got my pants off and he kissed me again. He grabbed me and put me against the bed frame. I took his belt off and unzipped his pants. He moaned as I slowly put my hands in his pants. "How about we just take everything off?" He said. I nodded and he quickly took his pants off and fell on top of me. He started kissing my neck and I could feel his hands slowly going down my body. I felt him exploring the valley that was my body. After he got to the middle of my valley I could feel the inside of his mouth surrounding everything. He was doing a blow job.
"Great!" Draco said.
"Well they won't because when we do that we go and get a room." I said, rolling my eyes.
He then erased a few answers and said, "these are wrong." Then he explained what I am supposed to do.
"Whatever." Blaise said.
"Yes Harry. They can even control people. I was quite sure I told you this before, but it doesn't matter." Hermione said.
"You are so hot when your naked." He said rubbing his hands up and down my sides.
Draco p.o.v
"Don't worry Harry. We will have our own home together." Draco said and kissed my forehead.
He gave a soft laugh. "Just one more thing Harry." He sat up and took out his wand and pointed it to my stomach. He quickly said a spell and I felt a little tingly. "That was so you will not get pregnant. Now we may began." He said, placing the wand on the nightstand.
Draco shook his head and said, "no. She just. Gives me a bad feeling."
After talking to Dumbldore Mr. Weasly is hurt and is in the hospital. So we went to go visit him. The Weaslys me Harry Blaise hermine and Pansy. But harry did not stay in the room. So I went to talk to him. "What's wrong love?" I asked.
Draco told me he will wait out side and walked out after glaring at Lupin.
"Draco you haven drunken any blood have you?" Hermione asked.
"Hey, we can do whatever we want." Draco said.
At lunch Hermione asked what happened and Draco explained. "at least he is trying to help. Though I'm not sure how much can be done. I mean. The ministry allowed her here." Hermione explained.
The next day I had Harry take his potion and he knows I threw away the other one.
Harry has passed out and is, luckily, alive. I got up and ask, "How did he know?"
"Fine. I'll go get my stuff." I said, running to my room.
Since Dean and Seamus sleep together, Blaise took Dean's bed. Draco is going to sleep with me like always and Pansy is sleeping in a bed that was put in the girls dormitory for her. Courtesy of Dumbledore.
"I always want you here," he said and leaned against me.
Draco shrugged. "Well how about you all go to the common room." Ms Mcgonagall said.
"Just sit here and relax." I said laying my head on his lap.
I told them everything that Mr. Weasley said. About how he said that Sirius Black wants to kill me and for me not to go after him.
Afterwards he came back, but stopped and started at something. We told them all good bye and went into the train.
I reached the surface with some little girl.
"Um...we are friends. I'm Harry. This is Draco, Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Pansy." Harry said for us.
Since Ron is still mad at me, Draco and I went to the Slytherin table.
When I found her, she is in the common room reading a book.
"Could you two ever give a straight answer?" Ron sighed.
Draco then woke up and said, "morning my Harry."
"Well yesterday at the library I saw the spell and today I though of it for just in case Ginny gives us any trouble." Hermione said, smiling.
"So Harry, what should I get Hermione?" Draco asked.
I smiled and said, "you okay Harry? Come on Harry you need to take a bath then we can get something to eat. You should also take a nice nap. Then eventually you can tell me everything that has happened."
Hermione p.o.v
"Harry get me down from here now!" Ron yelled. So Harry dropped him on his head.
"Alright. you are all done for the day. Remember this is a formal event, so when you go to Hogsmeade tomorrow buy something formal to wear. If you don't have a date you better get one before everyone is already taken. The ball is in a month, so you will have more than enough time, but I don't want you holding things off until the very last minute." She said, looking at Ron and Harry.
"The dance is in a bloody week and I don't have a date! What do I do?!" Ron yelled. Then Flure walked by. "Will you go to the dance with me!!" He yelled. She turned and smiled.
"So?" He said. I just took Harry over to the Slytherin table and we sat down. Pansy came over with Blais Crabbe and Goyle.
And Dumbledore said, "if anyone ever needs any help just ask." And he walked out.
I laughed. "Don't worry Harry. Could have been worse. I mean we could have already been at the actual sex part." I said.
"Oh yeah, that's all I am. Harry Potter'sÂ stupid friend." He got into bed then said, "piss off."
"Not around Draco. He might get possessive and kill you." I snorted before laughter made its way out.
It's been a while since they have been here. I have no concept of time since it's all dark. I just sat in the chair staring ahead. No point in struggling or screaming. Nothing will happen.
"What wrong Draco?" He asked all innocent.
This will be harder than I thought.
We then apeareated to platform 9&3/4. We then walked onto the train saying bye to Sirius and Remus. Sat down on the train as our freinds came in.
"Every one is acting weird." I said and finished up eating.
"Follow the spiders! What a great idea. What's next?" Ron said sarcastically, obviously mad.
"Thank you. I love you." He said, leaning against me and closing his eyes.
He gasped then turned mine bright rainbow. So I transfigured his robes to be green and silver. He transfigured mine to be rainbow colors. With glitter all over me.
"Correct. Now let's see how you handle them." He then opened the cage and they immediately attacked. Taking pictures off the wall and hanging Neville on the chandler.
I nodded and we all went home to have a peacefully day. Draco going with me. Pansy and Hermione together, Blaise and Ron together.
Me and Harry then went back to the room of requirement since classes are still on and he still does not want to go.
"Yeah. I'll miss it. It's was the first place I ever thought of as home." I said.
Also yesterday I saw a hurt young rabbit and took it in. No one knows about it including Draco.
When the song ended we walked over to Ron and May. "Hey Harry. What are you doing?" May said happily.
A year later and hogwarts is all fixed up. Headmistriss Mcgonagall is allowing any one who wants to go back can. Me and Draco of course are going back. Hermione Pansy Blaise and Ron will be coming to.
We got the same beds as last time and they got ready.
"Alright. I'll ask him when we get back to school." Ron said.
"Don't do anything!" Remus yelled.
"Just let him read. I'm sure that it will be fine." I said and pulled Harry onto my lap.
I felt hesitant. These people have been my friends for years now; but I didn't know if they will stay loyal when worse becomes worse. "I will tell you, but only if you swear that you won't tell anyone. Anyone. If you even think about telling someone I will kill you." My eyes were threatening and stone cold as I hissed after examining their faces.
I wrote, my name is Harry Potter.
"Come on love it's lunch time." I said, pulling his arm lightly.
"No, Harry you are hurt and need this. So no complaining or else." I said.
I ran to our common room and scratched at our door. When he opened it I gave him the best glare I can.
"I did." Draco said.
"Sorry my Harry." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
"Yah. Just hurts." Harry replied.
We all sat down. "Well it's seems that Ginny here tried to force herself on Mr. Potter here." Dumbledore said.
"Alright, see ya." Hermione said.
Draco began going faster. Until finally we both came. Draco pulled out and laid next to me. "I love you Harry." He said cuddling me.
"We don't want anyone to know yet." I said.
"T-shirt," she said. "I mean it's actually comfortable. So why not?" She said smiling.
Someone then said they found her so we followed him and she is hiding behind a cow.
"After Harry pouted and tried to look all cute." Mom said.
"I don't like him. He disturbes me and smells funny." Lucif replied.
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"If you tell me what that looks like." I said, not knowing anything about cooking.
I waited at the alter with Blaise. Harry began walking down the Isle in an all white suit with Remus and Sirius, then was handed over.
"Harry you still need to show us your animagus figure." Ron said.
"To bad. You have to." He said and carried me out. "Ron, go tell Dumbledore what happened." He added.
"Cool." He said.
We rid there, then me, Harry, Ron, Hermione Blaise, and Pansy went to the Gryffindor table. All the Slytherin glared at us.
"Draco can you help me," Harry said leaning against me showing me the potions homework.
Harry's P.O.V.*
Draco p.o.v
"Harry, did you paint your nails?" Ron asked me.
"Sorry to burst you bubble, but no." Hermione said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Why what did I do?" Draco said.
"No. Just lost his mind in the rainbows and sunshine." She said and walked away.
"None with you. Sorry." Hermione said sympathetically .
"Well me and Ron lost our virginity before you." Blais said and Ron laughed.
"But still. I should have talked to him like he suggested." Harry said, crying a little more.
We went and sat in the common room, Draco having me sit on his lap, making the heat go away more. I cuddled to him, rubbing my face in his neck.
We went into the carriage and Luna is here.
"Same seems to go for you." Ron replied.
I snorted, "No."
They then went into the kitchen, so we began talking again. "So Draco how have you been?" Hermione asked.
â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢~â¢
But I guess I'll have to find out.
"Good. Yours?" I asked.
"It's okay Harry. I understand." Ron said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
We sat down and I knew that it will end badly. "Today we will see how you react to things. You may be facing your greatest fears in this class." He then uncovers the cage and said, "Who can tell me what these are. Hermione?"
"Okay... So, we have our horcrux. Now what?" Ron said, looking at it.
"Take off your shirt and let me check you." I said, but he refused to.
Harry nodded and said, "it's nice tonight."
I looked at Draco and he seems uncomfortable with Mr. Lupin and glaring at him.
"We can go and get somthing to eat. It's lunch time." I said and we went to the Three Broomsticks.
Hermione frowned and said, "those poor house elvs. They have to do so mutch work. It's slavery it's wrong."
When we got down stairs Draco dragged me to the couch sat down with me on his lap. Then every one came in. "The reason why we called you all in here is because Mad Eye Moody has giving us two announcements that can not wait." Ms Weasly said as Mad eye walked in.
We then began our shopping.
"Well... at the moment, I'll like a dress, but I don't know what I'll like tomorrow." I said frowning.
Draco p.o.v
"Oh yes but I'm sure your thinking. 'Damn, he is hot. He looks good on his broom. Wonder if I can ride his'?" Draco said smirking.
"Harry are you okay?" Hermione asked.
"Me and Draco are going to spend the day together. What's yours?" I asked.
Snape and father walked in and Snape forced a potion down my throat.
"It will be fine, and he won't give birth until after school." Draco said.
"Yes, something that your master likes. Can you give it to him in the morning at breakfast? If you like, I will give you bread as a payment." I said.
"Hello, mister Harry potter." He said a little quietly.
The portrait opened and Draco walked in. "Where's Ron and Blaise?" I asked.
"I'm sure it will be fine. I mean Slughorn should be a good person. He did work at Hogwarts before. He knew my mother." Harry said, smiling.
"Well, you shouldn't be mad at either of us! Neither of us knew this would happen, and neither of us planned it." Draco said angerly.
Draco p.o.v
I ran to him and got onto the bed kissing him hard. Getting a suprised gasp from him.
We walked into Hagrid's hut and he is crying.
"Oh, come on, Draco let me go!" I whined, wanting to go with them to go to gringotts.
"The unforgivableÂ curses are cruel and evilÂ curses and is called that because they are. Unforgivable." Hermione explained like she was reading it out of a textbook.
When we got to the gryffindor common room, we saw our friends sitting together, Hermione was ready, with Pansy looking over her shoulder, and Blaise and Ron was cuddling on the couch. We walk over and join our friends on the couch.
Harry p.o.v
After wards we went to lunch.
"Well, that was all for nothing. I learned nothing new." I said flipping back into my chair.
"Ahh, Harry thanks for volunteering. Come on." Hagrid said.
"Maybe McGonagall can take you." The twins said in their normal way, as they walked up to us.
We went into the book store and it is full. "Why is there so many people here?" I asked, trying to peer past them.
I smiled and said, "I am good Headwig. Harry is an amazing mate."
"I don't serve mud bloods." The elf spat.
I stopped kissing him and dragged him to a bedroom that has appeared. I pushed him onto the bed and began kissing his neck. He moved his head, giving me more room. When I kissed a spot connecting his neck and shoulder he shiverd. I then bit it, causing him to moan.
"Harry had a blood quill used on him." Draco said showing Dumbldore my hand.
"Why are you awake?" I asked.
When the whole team is ready, we started to go but the Slytherins beat us.
A little later, Harry came out and I put an arm around his waist. "So what happned?" I asked.
"I'm sorry Harry I know she was a good friend," I said.
It opened and Harry took the cloak off. "What are ye all doin out at this hour?" Hagrid asked letting us in.
"What are you two talking about?" Draco asked.
When Ron and Blaise caught up they are with Hermione and Pansy. "Draco what do you mean by Harry is gone?" Hermione said.
"Um Harry. I don't think that's a hug." I said.
He just rolled over and cuddled a pillow. "Harry come on." I said and shook him.
I looked at both Pansy, and Blaise. Who are also looking at the Griff table. Blaise at Neville, and Pansy at Hermione. Both of them also no longer  want to be death eaters. Same as their parents.
"Smells weird?" Ron asked.
Me and Draco carried Blaise to the hospital wing. I can not believe this, I allowed Blaise to get hurt, and now, because of me, he may become a werewolf. Oh! This is all my fault!
"Oh and one more thing Hermione. I know he that is gay and genderfluid," he said.
"Whenever you want." He said as we walked in. Harry sat down next to me.
"And what are you three slytherin doing over here?" She asked in an annoying voice.
"Alright." I said.
He has been gone for a while but then he came back with no dragon.
"So Harry are you ready to go to Grimmauld place tomorrow?" I asked.
"Were good. Especially if you kiss me again." And he brought me in for another kiss.
They looked at each other. "Bottoms up." They said in sync and drank. They waited a minute and then jumped over the line. They smirked and walked forward confidently. After three steps though, both boys were thrown back by a invisible force. After they got up I noticed both Weasley twins had white beards. Everyone started laughing and they looked at each other and started laughing with us.
Professor Lupin walked in and said. "Good, you're awake. Dumbledore is furious. Here, eat some chocolate it will make you feel better." He said handing us some chocolate and sitting down. I ate mine and felt better.
I looked at the paper and it said on the title: "The boy who's gay."
"Well what if he was not? Then What?" Ron asked.
"Well that would have been good to know earlier!" Ron yelled. Everyone looked at us.
"Hello Draco." Other me said.
I'm sure our next teacher would be able to do that just fine." Ron said and smiled.
"Me to. At least last time that was what happened." I said.
"How? She is terrible. You are not going to go to that class ever. Now I'll write to my father." Draco said and got up to go to our room.
"Come On love let's get you to bed. Are you feeling okay?" I said rubbing his back.
