Harry's face reddened, feeling mortified and embarrassed and sick all at the same time and his hands twitched at his sides as he resisted the urge to cross his arms in front of his naked chest. Instead he raised his chin, glaring defiantly at the man. "In case you forgot: you were the one who didn't give me any time to…"
By Morgaine. This article was not mainly about Harry Potter, even if it tried its best to make it seem so. It was the declaration of a cold war at which end stood a ministry controlling every aspect of their life, leaving single families and individuals little possibilities to significantly influence political events. Crane used Harry Potter, the war hero as an iconic figure, the martyr kindling the people's fighting spirit to try and disempower the gentry that had ruled for centuries. And she was damned successful at that.
"It was not… I never…" Blaise licked his lips, at a loss of what to say, how to portray what he meant.
"Actually, he's not here." Lucius suppressed a smirk. Severus would not like this…
If he would only allow his magic free reign – artistic liberties – if he'd only unleash its fury unbridled… It would be the easiest and most effective way, wouldn't it? To just destroy his kidnappers and torturers, these criminals, who deserved nothing else anyway… and be safe.
"Don't, Zabini!" Daphne snapped, her hands clawing into the wood like the talons of an eagle about to leap off a ledge towards its prey or an enemy, grim and outraged as if his words were a personal affront against her intelligence. "Save your charm and lies for someone more gullible!"
Even if he pretended to believe the two foreigners for a moment, how should the Lanais have managed to get a hold of anything or anyone that could serve as blackmail material against someone like Harry Potter, Britain's very own war hero? Even more puzzling: how had they contacted Potter?
There were no warm winds to lift them, no thermals to soar on. Instead, a strong crosswind pressed against their side and the strain of the flight was burning through Blaise’s and Draco’s wing muscles like acid. Perforce they flew close to the ground, Draco quite a bit ahead, following the endless rows of vine towards the beacon that Harry had lit. A beacon that more and more took the form of a madly whirling flock of firebirds, beautiful and terrible to look at as their fiery tails and feathers fused almost seamlessly into that bright column of light that they had seen from afar.
Draco bent lower over the shallow bowl until his nose touched the cold, not quite solid substance and with an almighty lurch he was thrown forward, falling into the familiar icy-cold and black whirl pool that sucked the mind into the very heart of a memory.
"I don't want to" Blaise murmured with a gentler voice, leaning forward to place a kiss on Harry's forehead, causing the feather-crowned head to whip up so quickly that it missed his nose by millimetres only.
"Why? Did you honestly think I would lean back and take your shit just like that?" Harry growled "How stupid are you?"
"It is" Hermione said, biting her lips and observing him carefully. "And otherwise, Harry? How are Malfoy and Zabini treating you? Did they ... Harry did they force you to do anything?"
Blaise nodded before squinting into the darkness, trying to make out some form of landmark but the magical elven light made them blind for anything beyond it. “Extinguish all the lights!”
So he allowed it, but he tensed nonetheless, especially when feeling the silken material of the other’s robes against his bare back.
Oh right, he had bitten Malfoy… of all the things he could have done he had
Then he bit his lips, glancing up to the Slytherin. "But you know, it's okay, I don't think you would deceive me." And Harry was a little bit surprised that he actually meant that.
Lucius Malfoy stepped into his study and almost sneered in irritation at seeing the head of a young wizard in the fireplace. An unremarkable man with straggly, dirty-blond hair and a nervous flicker in his eyes that showed how uncomfortable he was in the presence of the former Death Eater in front of him.
Draco could have blissfully contented himself with such a sweet surrender, but not after having seen his lover flaunt his most recent activities so brazenly. Draco didn't want to even think about what it might have cost them, what abyss Blaise's actions might have opened between them and Harry, the bridges over which Draco would have to build with much patience and care, especially after what Adler had just told him. It made him so fucking
Decidedly, Harry shook his head, venturing to take another glance at his fellow Gryffindors' still cringing forms but they didn't react to his or the man's words and Harry wondered if they had been deafened. A new wave of righteous anger flooded him as he gazed back at that much too neutral face.
A memory of chaos that welcomed him with a cacophony of screams and howling wind and Harry's shouting as he landed on the floor of Harry's rooms, the Gryffindor himself kneeling next to him, his magic racing around him like a tornado, completely out of control and the threads of the curtains that once had been draped over the two-way mirror flew around him in a whirlwind, partly obscuring his cowering form. His face was a grotesque grimace of desperation and horror as he tried to get that madman to stop torturing Weasley.
"What?" The blonde exclaimed, taking a step towards the Gryffindor but stopping immediately when Harry held up a hand warningly, telling him to stop.
"Make no mistake, Rhisiart was long enough alive to establish the reputation of a stern, irascible, though cunning man. A great wizard, some said, who in the eyes of others was obsessed with power, dark magic, and sadistic games. He was not nearly as intelligent as he made himself out to be, and not as powerful, but otherwise his reputation was quite true. But I made sure to detach myself from that image as soon as he was killed. And in time, over my accomplishments, he became forgotten."
But if he read or heard the word 'submissive' one more time, while he inevitably had to think of Harry, he couldn't guarantee for anything. He hated how dry and austere the books and texts of law were, how pretentiously they praised the magical power and control a mated
He knew the black woman would like the title and Draco wasn't disappointed: a moment later the beautiful Mrs Zabini laughed quietly at being called the wise, female advisor of their new little family. And with a flourish she bowed gracefully with only a hint of amusement.
Suddenly the stag reared up, beating with its front hooves into the air in a feigned attack as if it wanted Draco to know he would be trampled into a bloody pulp if he came any closer. Draco flinched, taken aback by how truly huge the beast was at just this moment. Only barely he kept himself from falling as he took an involuntary step away. But he couldn’t run now, instinctively he knew that running would be a fatal error at this point, for him, for all of them, and he forced himself to resist, even when the stag smashed its large hooves against the ground with a sound like thunder.
Severus Snape halted for a moment as he strode into the parlour that he always favoured when coming to the Manor. It was smaller than most, plainer and therefore more to his liking.
God, was it bad that he didn't want that to have been only his magic making him hunger for the other Vykélari's touch? But to never feel this level of overwhelming pleasure again, being held and wanted... Magic or not, he had never felt anything even coming close to that experience. And it had just been a bloody kiss!
If he wanted to save Hermione and Ron, and himself, then it was now or never.
What Harry had experienced. At least since the last morning when Draco and Blaise had left him alone with Ives and Adler to prepare their date, which was the last possibility Adler had had to have the House Elf apply the potion to the Gryffindor's eyes. Draco would have to violate his trust utterly, by disrespecting every ounce of privacy he had possessed during these last eighteen hours.
Nothing they did or threatened him with had changed his mind on that decision and in the end they had had no choice but to leave and apparate to Malfoy Manor in the vague hope of finding Harry there.
"You transformed back again, completely." Draco murmured, reaching for the brunet's black hair almost wistfully as if he missed the green feathers. Harry shied away; he didn't want them to touch him right now, not while he didn't know what they planned to do with him in the long run.
At that, Valerio huffed in sharp, acid amusement. "So you think yourself in love with them?" He mocked, a quiet laugh erupting from his thin lips. It looked stilted, calculated and so very out of place. "You do, don't you? Oh you poor thing. Driven by your own magic and mating instincts and you don't even know it."
"In a way." He said evasively, partly in answer to Draco's first question. Then, deciding to just press on and deal with the consequences if and when they arose, he tilted his head curiously, taking in every hitch in his lover's smooth façade that might be indicative of his mood.
Seemingly relieved, Adler relaxed back against the backrest of his chair - as much as that was possible. "Well, at least you haven't bonded, then."
"Perish the thought!" Blaise smirked while Draco rolled his eyes.
"Don't be afraid. Your letter reached us and we are here to help you."
Slowly, Lucius stood, an imposing figure now as his body stretched to its full height. Draco had always envied his father for his redoubtable presence commanding respect so easily, but right now the vision was cracked by his earlier loss of control, at least in Blaise's opinion, who nurtured his indignation in silence at Draco's side, angry that they would endanger his and Draco's and Harry's happiness in order to avoid facing the consequences of their own foolishness.
Blaise and Draco turned to him, blinking against the sun. "Was it what?"
He didn't hesitate for one moment as he wrote the first words.
Harry's eyes went wide as he realised what had happened and he gasped for air as if in pain, his throat closing off. They had bound his magic, they had truly… he grimaced, ripping himself free of Eleuterio's hold with a strangled groan, stumbling backwards and almost tumbling to the ground. Frantically, his trembling fingers flew to the band of unforgiving metal – a collar, he realised with dread and disgust exploding in his chest. It had melted into his skin and was adapting to his every movement, flexing with the tendons in his throat. Harry felt out the smooth surface, covered with small indentations and lines that formed inscribed runes, trying to find some leverage, some way to rip it off.
Next to him, the Gryffindor rolled his eyes, his lips curled into a self-ironic smirk. "You forget that I fought a Dark Lord. I do know the difference between wallowing in self-pity and calling attention to things that need changing and really undertaking those changes."
A moment later, Harry was hit by a flashing light directly between the shoulder blades that violently ripped from his feet. For a moment genuine joy and gladness bubbled up within Draco at this small concession of the lady Fortuna but it was dampened soon after by the gruesome sight his successful spellwork invoked: Harry's feet were pulled out from under him, forwards and up so quickly that his head never touched the rough gravel of the driveway, and he was wrenched into the air so abruptly that he barely had the time for a surprised outcry.
Alas! There is no going back... anyway, the Cynn would certainly invite Mr Shacklebold to the next Samhain.
Right next to it, an artificial, probably magical well fed a small, stone-edged rivulet running downwards to the second terrace and into an impressively large pool, the water glittering in the sunlight so brightly that it almost blinded him. From there the little stream fled towards the sea, building small ponds where the water cascaded from one terrace to the other.
"Go ‘n help him." Draco muttered and Blaise nodded once, his eyes flitting to their submissive’s fallen form and he swallowed drily, his throat clicking in the silence. Although he could not see much of the young submissive, the jewelled handle of the dagger protruding from his back was hard to miss. Their gryphon didn’t have a lot of time left, that much was for sure.
By god, he was beautiful!
But Valerio turned a moment later, taking in Harry briefly, intently as if committing his distress to memory, before facing his wife. A few Italian words were spoken in hushed voices and Taide's grip tightened to the point of being painful, pulling Harry closer against a solid chest. It made Harry's magic stir within his chest, sensing the powerful aura of a dominant, and for a moment Harry feared what the subtle, pervasive compulsion might make him do… ill at ease, he squirmed, trying weakly to get away, but Taide held him close, pushing calming sparks of magic into Harry's skin and it felt all so wrong! Harry had never had anyone but Blaise or Draco do this to him and somehow that tiny bit of magical interaction was already too much, too intimate to bear from someone else, especially in a situation like this.
Well, it couldn’t be helped, he guessed, and he would be damned if the boy would strengthen any other family but his own. It was, after all, the first time that Mr Potter proved to be useful for
Narcissa smiled at them gently. "I think you are doing the right thing. In the long run it will be better for all of you if he entered a mateship of his own accord."
Harry merely gaped at him open-mouthed: they had promised to explain! Nevertheless, the git continued completely unperturbed.
There was so much he needed to learn. After listening to Ives that had become frighteningly clear.
Adler gave him a long, assessing look, probably knowing all too well that while Draco might refuse to address Adler's brazen behaviour now, the matter with the spying potion was far from being over and that he'd have to justify his actions in a very near future or possibly find himself in some secluded room in an uninhibited house with each and every version of his own painting as the only company; complete isolation just as Draco had threatened. Maybe that was why the portrait offered straightforward information for once.
"Or you can have the house elves redecorate the study however you like." Blaise interrupted, raising an eyebrow at his fiancé, making Harry wonder for a moment what he was missing.
"The list goes on and on." He whispered. "And I don't want Draco or Blaise to be drawn into that maelstrom of destruction that is Potter's life."
“I’ll do it.” She said, her voice harder than Severus would have expected under the circumstances. “I don’t want to, but I will do it.”
Sure enough a moment later the boy started to convulse, his chest heaving with wet, violent coughing, his body shaking with tremors. Severus surged forward, cutting the bindings and grabbing Potters shoulders to turn him onto his side and not a moment too soon: he had just managed to turn the boy's head safely away when the potions Severus had fed him seconds earlier made an entirely disgusting reappearance, splattering all over the pristine bed sheets.
And there was no one richer than the Malfoys. And it all belonged to him.
But even before he could finish that thought, a feint stab of insecurity made Blaise's gut churn suddenly. Or would he?
He didn't flinch when hesitant fingers grazed the skin of his back, most likely guided by Blaise's hands, the touch of which he could have recognized anywhere. Then a moment later it shifted, the number of fingertips lying against his skin doubling as doubtlessly, his fiancé entwined his own hand with Harry's. Still facing away, Draco indulged himself by rolling his eyes and smiling faintly, almost fondly. Blaise was so predictable sometimes. Well, at least
" he growled, shaking his lover once for good measure, "taking those words to heart!"
Jerkily, he pulled off the shirt he was wearing and held it out for Blaise to take while holding his eyes for a moment just to be sure that his fiancé knew what sacrifice exactly he demanded of him, before he turned to Harry, gentling his gaze somewhat upon encountering that apprehensive expression. At least the Saviour was not faring any better than he was, it seemed. Maybe he should just curse Blaise and be done with it, for Harry's and his peace of mind, Draco mused, throwing a quick glance at the handsome Italian, locking gazes with those dark eyes that were gleaming with a warmth and encouragement that he did not often encounter there.
“Master!” Alfar piped up, “We are complete.”
Silently, Draco averted his gaze, the answer, the only possible answer, clear in his mind. Of course he wouldn't. Fate had already forced Harry to kill and Draco didn't want to force him to become even colder, even harder than that. It wouldn't be fair on him.
“Yeah, I know…” Draco conceded, standing up and moving towards the door to inform that Cowan. “But whatever happens and wherever he’ll go, in the end we’ll always be the first he’s ever seen with his new eyes, before even seeing himself… he’ll never forget that.” And with those smug words and a smirk on his lips, Draco left.
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t known it would happen either. He had been so horribly certain of it.
attack him if it thought for only a single second that the Slytherin might pose a danger and Draco was afraid, his heart beating so fast and forceful that he thought it might just burst his ribcage apart.
He had stood there for a while, watching the slight gap in the curtains opposite of his bed, through which the two Slytherins had left. Then with a sigh, he had taken the pyjama and crossed that very curtain and into the living area behind it. He hadn't taken much notice of the room then, only interested in getting into the bathroom on the other side of it to take a quick shower and then return to fall into his bed.
Quickly he cast a series of powerful cooling charms on the room until his breath congealed in the freezing air and his skin broke out in goose bumps. If he could get Potter's body temperature to drop quickly, it should considerably slow the process down. Hadn't Pomfrey once revived a Hufflepuff girl that had one winter fallen into the Great Lake, after twenty minutes without any lasting damage?
Lowering Potter’s body temperature so drastically and quickly had been necessary to protect his  brain and give Severus the time he had needed to come up with a solution, but it had ultimately given the boy hypothermia – how bad of a case Severus didn’t know yet, and neither if it had been successful at all in preventing brain damage. Only time would tell.
Harry huffed. Wasn't that obvious?
While everyone was still staring in shocked silence the thing had gradually calmed down and then it had just
He turned to leave just as he heard a clapping sound and then a cacophony of pops all around him, precursors of the almost two dozen house-elves that appeared out of the thin air. Curiously they stared at him, but their main focus was on Zabini.
That Asshole.
"No, you didn't! And you didn't care, either. Harry, pureblood families are even more powerful here than they are in Britain and you are not exactly seen as a friend of pureblood values! You might have been killed and your mutilated carcass would have simply vanished with the use of the one or the other dark spell!"
Regardless of his conflicted feelings, his teachers went on with their instructions.
Honestly, Harry hadn't known what to expect after what Ives had told him of the man who had used Ives’ plight, whatever it had been, to earn his hand in marriage, who had given him an 'offer he couldn't reject' for that reason and that reason alone but who supposedly loved him at the same time...
Whether he was crazy or not, anyone who just bothered to look could see that both Blaise and Draco were trying their best. Who was he to deny them another chance? Dumbledore would have wanted him to think and act like that, Harry was sure. While the old wizard had undeniably committed countless mistakes in his long life, Harry refused to believe that this attitude was one of them. The war might never have been won if Albus Dumbledore hadn't given a certain young Slytherin the benefit of a doubt, even though Harry really couldn't endorse how the headmaster had used Snape as a spy.
Harry was starting to trust him. The boy who had refused his friendship seven long years ago, who had fought with him constantly, whom he, Draco, had almost hexed with the strongest torture curse in existence, who had almost killed him by slicing him open but in the end had saved his life on another occasion … well, at least no one could say that their relationship had ever been anything but intense. But who cared? Harry was starting to trust him!
And while Harry was conscious and in full possession of his magic he would cast off almost any spell that attempted to bind him or keep him back or even slow him down.
"If they indeed used such a leech dagger I assume Potter would have been in no condition to leave on his own. They must have sent him away, and they wouldn't have done so if he was dead." Generale Carraci reasoned. "For now I would operate under the assumption that he
Harry, whose eyes flashed so furiously, who snarled at them defiantly but who refused to give them the satisfaction of a futile fight. Who only laid there, waiting with anger and apprehension warring on his pale and yet beautiful face.
"I despatched a team, of course, to secure the crime scene, but I doubt they'll be able to effectively examine it... the land is magically
Merlin, no! His stomach knotting in apprehension, Harry turned towards the two-way-mirror leaning against the wall, veiled with a thick curtain so that Harry who had no wand to close the connection could still have his privacy in this suite of rooms that Blaise had given him.
She wrung her hands and threw her head back, staring at the ceiling and blinking her tears away.
wearing that … that
At that, Harry found himself speechless and he had to bite his lower lip and turn away. In his life there had been only a handful of people so protective of him, and all of them had been or still were very dear to him. Molly, for example, or Sirius. Most had always known that Harry was literally fated (or should he say prophesized) to get into precarious situations, to have to fight and kill and they hadn't stood in his way, and some like Hermione and Ron had helped him wherever they could. But only few had been actually trying to spare him all that, as laughable as it seemed to challenge fate.
Severus didn't lose any more time, flicking his wand at the mattress to turn it into a narrow tub right beneath Potter's body. Then he tore all the stops from the remaining bottles, letting the golden liquid drench the boy entirely, hoping it would be enough.
"You needn't have done that, Mr Potter." The man remarked coolly after a few more moments of tense silence as hard and chilly as a meters thick ice sheet. "I am willing to meet reasonable demands if they are at all compatible with our own goals. However," he lowered his voice ominously, tilting his head, "I am growing weary of this rebellious streak of yours."
Where had he left off, again? Ah, yes. Potter's incredible luck with blind guesses… "It really wasn't your fault, Draco. This was something he had to learn eventually. Personally, I think that it was the combination of flirting and the news that he is a submissive while we are both dominant Vykélari that freaked him out."
well together."
"Behave, Severus." Lucius drawled. "Do I have to remind you: It is the duty of a godfather to spoil his godson."
He had never felt so close to anyone before, never so
Okay, maybe not Hufflepuff; for that Harry seemed too uncomfortable all of a sudden with giving compliments. "Yeah, well, you know, he said how Adler had been so relieved when you… you know, during the end of the war and all? And I mean I was, too. If I hadn't thought you to be better than your father I wouldn’t have stood witness for you…"
want to use him.
Harry held his breath, trying not to move and after a moment that cruel sharp something was taken away, replaced with soft fingertips that rewarded his obedience with the now almost familiar magical touch that had soothed him multiple times during the last minutes. And really, Harry didn’t want to react to it, but it made the skin on his neck tingle pleasantly and something inside of him stirred and purred, welcoming that unknown power and merging with it eagerly.
But he hadn't even wanted to think about his would-be mate, still didn't in a way. He didn't want to be able to put a face to a man willing to commit such atrocities, but more than that, Harry didn't want to see the man he would have to kill if he couldn't prevent all this from happening.
A rather harrowing thought. One that inspired him to teach the potions master a lesson of his own in due time. Perhaps he would.
From then on he had been met with one refusal, one failure after another. Acquaintances and friendships that he had made during his last visits before the war in Britain turned him away or didn't even answer, unwilling to openly show their colours in the rare cases they sympathised with him, but mostly outright refusing to even speak out against the Lanais, especially since helping Blaise and Draco would mean going against Vykélari law which would deliver them up to the mercy of the Lanais as the major source for representatives of the Vykélari Council, the very family they would agitate against.
Ettore clenched his jaw, a tendril of bitter resentment curling around his chest. Hadn't he out of anyone a right to know what had happened? It had only been due to his suspicions, his tenacity, that they had even learned of the Lanai's deceit. If not for him the minister wouldn't even have had the right to send out a team to Lanai Manor when Zabini's and Malfoy's alarm had gone off. Because legally the entire affair would still have fallen under Vykélari jurisdiction.
"Do you? My great-great and many more greats, grandson? Is that why your little nightingale tried to flee your esteemed company? Please do me the favour of sharing in your rich knowledge sometime." Adler said pleasantly, no hint of mockery tainting his silky voice. Only his eyes were laughing.
"But you do." Blaise simply said, turning to press a deep kiss onto Draco's lips.
Blaise immediately recognized her: it was the young Elf that Harry had tricked into sending the letter to his friends. The female, Giallina, had confessed to her involvement later on under many tears and much wailing when Blaise and Draco had already known of Harry's deed.
The Weasleys and Hermione come to Malfoy Manor in search for answers after meeting only dead ends before. Narcissa tells them that Harry is a submissive and has been taken to a secret place by her son and future son-in-law.
Quickly he fixated his patient to the mattress, stripes of the fine bed linen tearing themselves out and wrapping around the boy's forehead, arms and chest. While they tied themselves off with neat knots, Severus floated a thin tube out of his bag.
He stopped as Harry tilted his head, his brow knitted in obvious bewilderment over the blonde's behaviour. Well that might be somewhat deserved.
The question took Harry aback, not having expected the man to just ignore his threats. Nonetheless Harry shook his head in answer, terse and tense. What would a name change?
Draco and Blaise take some precautious measures to keep Harry safe (alert Adler and Ives and give them House Elves so that they themselves can become active in an emergency, revoking Harry's ban to leave, tell the House Elves to prevent owl-post from reaching Harry, to protect him and to not let anyone enter the Manor's grounds,).
If he managed to weather the storm brewing between Italy and Britain, Nascimbeni thought he might even come out of this scandal with a couple political enemies less...
He followed Blaise in a slow zigzag descent, turning alternately into and away from the headwind until they reached the roof top. The landing though was trickier than Harry had anticipated and he might have crashed hard onto the ground, had not Draco caught him with a quick levitation charm and set him down gently.
"My turn..."
Or was this simply one of the war's burdensome legacies, the lingering strife between the opposing sides of a civil war? While possible to overcome, it would probably take far too much time…
Still, Malfoy's and Zabini's words hadn't left him untouched, had planted a seed of doubt into his mind that he couldn't get rid of, however much he yanked at the visible shoots. Not necessarily because the two men had been so very convincing, but because he knew that they – the vaunted guardia – would be guilty of destroying an innocent life and their very own reputation, if it were true. Not to speak of the consequences it might have on the relationships between the Italian government and the British one, if they just looked the other way while England's beloved war hero was abused and blackmailed and magically and physically raped.
He couldn't be haughty, couldn't present his opponent with a superior, aloof front, or else Daphne might just outright deny them her help entirely or even close the connection on him before he had a chance at voicing his request. She was a very proud woman and disliked being looked down upon just as much as she disliked people grovelling in front of her.
But it wasn’t actually erratic, bound to its owner’s emotions as it was; never in history had a submissive been known to accidentally kill someone he cared for… That was why it was sometimes said that a Vykélari’s magic was sentient, after all. It wasn’t the magic, but the Vykélari behind it…
to take, if one of them would ever get close enough to the younger submissive so that Harry would consent to something as innocent as a kiss. Had he not told his Italian lover that very first afternoon here how he wanted to kiss him? Taste his magic and feel his lips, the lithe body trembling in his embrace...
The pain was overwhelming, shocking, flooding his mind and superseding any rational thought and so it took him a moment to actually realise just how he stood: leaning against his attacker, still on his feet only by virtue of the magical beast’s support.
With his forefinger he prodded the liquid with intent and the Pensieve was activated: the silvery mass started to swirl quickly for a few moments until it started to become transparent and still, a looking glass showing Harry's rooms from above like a window in the ceiling.
If the war had taught him anything, then that he didn't want to live without this stubborn, prideful, egoistical idiot.
It was the small chirping sounds the young man made, however, that was the final straw for both Draco and Blaise. It was no elaborate song, only disjointed, single notes that came instinctively to every Vykélari to use as a warning signal for others of their kind, saying 'Danger, don't come here!' to everyone who cared to listen.
The doors themselves lead to rooms that could only exist due to the clever usage of wizarding space: a kitchen and ever-full pantry, two bathrooms, several bedrooms… Severus knew what hid behind each of them even though they were currently closed, as he had been given the full tour not so long a time ago.
Hey, there had been witnesses for that!
With unconquerable determination, Harry ripped at his magic, tore at it with mindless abandon and with a sudden lurch he overcame the pull of the cursed dagger. Forcefully, he pushed it all out of his body, not bothering to keep any for himself. He reared up as he convulsed, the feeling of loss, of magical exhaustion hitting him more fiercely than even during his inheritance.
"What are you allowed to do?" Harry whispered into the early morning air, worrying his lower lips. What had Zabini said? God, remembering the moment was more difficult than he would have thought with his memory clouded by anger. But Zabini had been infuriating when he had given all those orders…
With a silly, excited smile Harry followed him with his eyes, watching as the copper-winged teen started to circle above them for a minute before he began his slow decent towards the two of them again.
"Harry," Blaise started gently, "this is a very common concept. The family of your best friend is pureblood. They, too, have engaged in blood feuds and…"
"After the mating." He insisted, his tone still polite but each word a rigid and inflexible statement of tenacity and persistence in and on itself.
He couldn't breathe!
“That is not true!” Narcissa cried out, enraged, but Severus noticed that she couldn't quite bring herself to meet his eyes.
"Well, yes. Obviously this was much more intense than a mere temporary magical connection. It should only have allowed you to feel a vague echo of sensations and let you share only those that you concentrated explicitly on to begin with. Maybe it was because of the life debts between you… or the rather … intense relationship you had even before the war."
say that. You know, I never saw it like this. Still, now with Shacklebold as the minister the situation is quite different than with Fudge or Scrimgeour. He is fair and just and will undoubtedly push through many reforms during his term that will be more than beneficial for the Wizarding World. Honestly, I think we could do worse than giving him the power to really restructure the ministry..."
body, maybe even more so than he did theirs, since he was the one to draw in their magic.
The Slytherins are shocked when they realise that Harry is trying to reject his inheritance and is ill with magical exhaustion and they try to gently convince Harry to accept his being a submissive Vykélari by calling his attention to everything he could do with his newfound powers. Harry is still suspicious even when they promise not to force him into mating, not least because they refuse to commit themselves to a date when they might let him leave Lanai Manor.
As soon as the weapon was free, Blaise flung it aside carelessly and turned to Harry once more. Gently he eased him onto his back, causing the few birds on his shoulder and hip to flutter and resettle on his chest and legs. Blaise tried not to let the beasts disturb him and cradled Harry’s cheek with tender fingers to push a burst of magic into his limp body, knowing that he must be magically depleted to a near fatal extent.
"Your family is atrocious." He stated heatedly, because it had to be said.
Blaise sighed deeply, rubbing with his fingertips over his brow. They never should have left Britain, their homeland, where they had friends and allies to stand beside them, where Harry had people willing to face hordes of grims and nundus and dragons for him at a moment's notice.
How naïve he had been.
And still, Harry would do anything.
," he drawled, his eyes still sparkling with laughter. "If monsieur would like to continue now…" And with an elegant, expansive gesture he invited Harry to proceed.
The arm chair on the left was occupied by a black-haired woman, old and serene enough to create an air of regality around her but young enough to still retain herself a fragile beauty, like a widely open rose in the very moments before its petals started to fall. She wore a pale, long dress embroidered with a dark floral pattern and adorned with small pearls glistening in the light of the chandelier right above Harry. Her slender, delicate hands rested in her lap, one of them holding an almost white wand of bird's eye maple but she regarded him with cold disinterest, one perfect, haughty eyebrow raised critically, as if he was nothing but the leading actor in a mediocre play at a nameless amateur theatre, and Harry immediately let his gaze drift away from her, knowing that she was unlikely to attack him as well. She was the kind of woman who let others fight her battles and maybe that was the reason why she seemed so out of place to Harry, in this situation, and amongst these people who were more prepared and willing to viciously and ruthlessly wrestle him down rather than negotiate his surrender, let alone welcome who they wanted to be the new addition to their family.
He only forced himself to pay attention when Blaise began to speak, in an urgent, hurried manner. "This, Harry, is an emergency portkey." He said and took one of Harry's hands.
Taking a deep breath to calm his anxiousness Harry brushed his unruly hair out of his face and slipped out of his king-size bed reluctantly, wondering what he would encounter the Slytherins' accusations with.
His very annoyed outcry was answered with a deep chuckle that seemed to reverberate through his body and gods, Blaise seemed to be in one of his cruel mindsets because he closed lithe fingers around the base of Draco's cock in an imitation of a cock ring to keep him from cumming. Then he bent down to press a light kiss on the tip of his lover's raging erection. His tongue dove out to tease over the slit, pressing in for but a moment and making Draco cry out in abandon and flex his hip in a futile attempt of getting
With that, she raised her wand, about to close the connection and Blaise couldn't allow that to happen…
"We told you from the start that we'd never…"
Harry's magic erupted out of him, finally escaping his control or, more accurately his control vanishing in the face of the torture of his best friend. It raised and whirled around him, whipping about and cutting through the air in the search for his enemy, beating against the mirror in a useless attempt to get through.
'Or a good little
But still, he would have wished to have at least Ginny's and Ron's acceptance that he needed to stand up for someone he considered to be if not innocent then at least not guilty. He understood that there was an ocean of bad blood and moral and societal differences between those two families that was too wide to have the Weasley's support in such an endeavour, but their acceptance would have been nice.
This time, Severus did sneer, though he didn't bother with useless swearing, instead holding his charge in place throughout his violent retching and shaking so that the vomit would not end up choking him, all the while wondering what the hell he was supposed to do if Potter was fighting off the magic that he might use to help him.
Slowly, Taide's hand wandered from his stomach downwards, interrupting the painful thought and Harry tensed as it stroked over his hip and his thigh, to press down on his muscles, an insistent reminder of just where and with whom he was. And what he was supposed to do. But gods, if this perverted asshole thought that Harry would just roll over and let him do whatever he wanted, he had another thing coming!
"Wouldn't want that." He murmured with a painful smirk. "I won't try to apparate to them. And I won't apparate away from you, I wouldn't even know how to with my wand still in Britain. But I will only give myself over once I know that my friends are free and well."
"Never mind!" he snarled as they stayed silent; he didn't really care much for what they had to say anyways. "Give me back my wand and my clothes and then take me back to … to London!"
"It is better for you not to know for now anyway." The other hummed for a moment, a tiny, pleased and pensive sound from deep within his slender throat. Then a sharp-edged smirk cut his lips wider, dark amusement creeping into his eyes and the angles of his expression.
That's when she detected it. A single sheet of paper hovering directly above the stairs leading to the level below them. With a few steps Narcissa crossed the room and snatched the letter out of the air. Quickly she unfolded it, her gaze flickering to the signature, drawn by the familiar elegant curves. Indeed, it was Severus' writing.
Slowly he fought himself through the heavy grogginess that had filled him so completely, allowing him to think clearer and to recognize the way his feelings and thoughts had been tampered with just a moment ago. Anger rose in him; he
The villa's forefront looked older and more
was in his rooms, having learnt years ago to trust his instincts, that itching feeling of being observed or overheard.
allow it, not with someone who had proven he couldn't be trusted; No, Harry needed to get away, he
Besides, in the rare cases that a submissive, or a friend of the submissive, accused a dominant, the Vykélari council used to iron out the problem in one way or another before it reached the public. It wasn't exactly possible to complain that this council had now decided to really enforce the law just to give the submissive to someone else, especially since there was no way to really prove the last part of this claim.
Once more the trio resumed their respective positions and Draco felt himself tense a bit as the joint hands of his lover and someone who might have been a friend or more in a different reality pressed gently down on his muscles. It didn't take him long to feel out his own magic and push it outwards into the fingertips as a silent invitation.
Daphne snarled, her chin raised aggressively, and her hand cut through the air to encompass all their alleged idiocy and depravity. "I still gave you the benefit of a doubt and made sure to verify all the facts. The guardia sent that letter to the Aurors to confirm the magical signatures. There is no doubt about it: Potter wrote it, his magical signature is all over the paper, which bears the heraldic animal of
"I am sure you have read Miss Crane's article in the Daily Prophet today." Draco roughly gestured to the newspaper still lying on the ground next to Mione who uttered an amused "indeed" after following his gaze.
Now though, seeing a study of desperation painted on Harry's face, set apart from the peaceful scenery around them – the perfect setting of a beautiful park bathed in starlight, the ocean breeze wafting around them and playing with Harry's raven strands and silky green feathers – he couldn't help but think it was tasteless and cruel.
Fight or flight? Draco usually knew the answer to that question without a doubt, his survival instincts were well developed and functioning perfectly. And he wasn't ashamed of his choices.
At that moment, a House Elf appeared right next to Blaise, making him almost jump in surprise. It was Alfar, his chief House Elf, the large ears trembling with distress as he bowed so low his nose almost touched the ground. "Master Blaise, sir. The
Harry wailed and screamed, convulsing around the dagger deeply imbedded in him, feeling his magic trickle softly into the cold metal, but the physical pain and loss were insignificant, paling in comparison to the other loss he was experiencing at this very moment and he couldn't care less that he was haemorrhaging, both blood and magic streaming out of his body.
Overall, Severus had to admit that his efforts to help had been rash, abysmally planned out and carelessly enacted; and that Potter’s survival could be credited more to sheer dumb luck than to any special skills of his, or even quick thinking.
Blinking once, twice, Harry tilted his head, frowning at them as if he doubted their intelligence. "I know!"
"We'll leave you alone, now. And don't worry about the mirrors: you can keep this one here in your room if you like and we arranged for its counterpart to stay with your friends for as long as you are here in Lanai Manor, so you will always be able to contact each other. They are two-way-mirrors, that is..."
The view revealed nothing, but as Blaise looked at him, Harry found himself blinking against the small smile that shone like a sunlit black agate geode, open and bright and dazzling, which he was given as the Italian gestured towards the study. "We have a little surprise for you. Or rather: a surprise guest. Would you like to meet him?"
Draco! That was Draco shouting Harry's name!
For a moment unaware just how open his feelings were at the moment, Harry yelped in surprise as Blaise pushed him away enough to catch his wrists in a tight grip, staring intently at him. Dangerous, he seemed now, like a predator. It was even more intimidating as Harry could feel a foreboding iciness overcoming the Italian's emotions and he could no longer really say what went on in that doubtlessly cunning mind, clouded with the rising occlumency shields as it was. But the urgency in Blaise's voice at least let Harry's magic draw back from its effort to mediate between the dominant and its owner, as slowly and gently and unobtrusively as it had appeared, but not before sparking a last thought; and the ominous aura surrounding the dark-skinned young man was enough to distract Harry from the way his mind cleared, leaving him only with the sureness that he should be telling his host of something that might prove to be a danger to them all. And privately, every conscious part of him, too, knew that it was high time to let the two dominants know of his hopefully little transgression so that they could prepare. Therefore he didn't hesitate to answer, when Blaise demanded to know what was wrong, rather than requiring it, his voice ringing with a steely wintriness, that didn't sit well with harry at all.
Draco would have sighed or frowned or snapped at Blaise, if Harry hadn't stood there watching the two of them with that curious expression; how could Draco, when it was not him who had a valid reason to be anxious but the younger submissive who had lived through a hell of a traumatic transformation and had to face it yet again.
It held a clear, apple-green liquid, wobbling drops of gold moving sluggishly within and the unexpected sight of it made Harry tense again instinctively. Because regardless of how much he didn't understand the fine art of potion making, his lack of talent didn't make him unaware of how dangerous they could be. What if they wanted to weaken him further, or dose him with a love philtre? His heart raced, each furious beat hammering another of the limitless possibilities forth into his awareness. Could they just make him into a mindless puppet, unable to defend himself or even object?
Pansy was a humanity opportunist, it was a miracle that she had even gone to the pains of lending Harry's friends her most beloved mirror without any obvious benefits. And Draco … Draco would never have betrayed his parents.
Severus allowed it, he could worry about infections later if (when!) the boy's heart was beating again. But it wasn't. God be damned it wasn't!
Harry smirked almost gleefully. They were too late.
Honestly, Blaise couldn't fathom why the brunet would ever feel that way or even how he could defend that unconceivable notion in his own head, he only knew that it was somehow typical, typical Harry.
Now, for a household like the Weasleys that might not be unusual per se, but at least unexpected. Since Ottery St. Catchpole was located rather far from the major wizarding communities in Britain and most of their closest friends not even lived in the same county, and since apparating wasn't the safest means of travelling, most of their acquaintances entered their home via the floo; and official matters were usually handled via the owl post. They didn't have much to do with the Fawcetts, the Diggorys and the Lovegoods and other wizarding families living close by, not these days in any case and aunt Muriel ... she expected to
But those wraithlike shadows should never have actually solidified, Harry had never really thought they would, not least because Draco and Blaise had assured him that his friends were safe … Probably. Likely. Maybe.
was nowhere near as difficult to achieve as an escape…
It also caught him. In mid-air, facing Harry who had also come to a stop and by Merlin, he looked as if from another world: floating in the darkness with his wings poised behind him like a vengeful angel, he was gleaming softly as if filled with an inner light that burned along the edges of every feather, danced over every inch of skin but which was nowhere near as bright as in his eyes, the green having replaced the white almost completely, creating ominously gleaming gems of emerald. Surrounded by pale ultraviolet and dark swirls they held him captive, demanded his sole attention.
Draco tilted his head slowly and came closer again, his lips twitching in something that might have been a smirk but could just as well have been a snarl. And Blaise knew that his lover was irritated, with himself for having misjudged the situation and the effects of his behaviour on Harry, with the situation as a whole, with Blaise for kissing their young Vykélari submissive...
'Say no!' Blaise found himself silently begging. If Harry refused now – even though Blaise rationally knew that he never would – they could still get him to safety, could still work on proving his relatives' involvement in this obvious attempt at blackmail to the guardia.
Well, maybe the amount of Galleons changing hands right before the trials had something to do with that, too.
"Mrs Malfoy," he said imploringly "please tell us where he is! The last thing he said right before collapsing was 'something is taking my magic'! We only need to know what happened and that he is fine. Where is he?"
A deceptive delusion, he knew that. A Vykélari's magic tended to be self-willed almost, like a second sub consciousness, or maybe it was the Vykélari's sub consciousness that took control of his magic once in a while – who knew? The only thing that mattered was that it would lash out if it thought its owner to be in danger, it would defend him viciously, and it would defend itself if someone tried to take control over it.
Merlin, they could kiss… and while Harry still doubted whether he maybe should have done it, he couldn't help but think that the whole day had gravitated towards such an ending as straightforward and unstoppable as a Niffler following the scent of gold.
Nonetheless these kidnappers had intentionally chosen a plane as a bolthole. But why … why … a plane? Where were they taking them that a portkey couldn't so much faster and more efficiently? Not for a moment Harry believed this to be a coincidence or a simple convenience and not knowing the reason made his stomach clench uncomfortably but before he could figure out the motivations behind this seemingly unreasonable chess move, that soft Italian lilt that Harry started to hate from the bottom of his heart, resounded again in the wide living room.
The memory was so precious – so useless!
What if any of his family were still alive and in any shape to fight them? And what if the guardia didn’t come? What if they were actually on his family’s payroll like he had feared from the beginning? They’d be unable to defend themselves properly, might be overtaken…
Harry blinked at the little creature in front of him that was wrapped up in layers of a pale cloth with dark edging that had once probably been part of a discarded curtain. "Uh… do you speak English?"
Then that cruel, black something attacked his ears and he screamed as he felt as if acid was being poured into his ear canals. At least until his voice gave way rather abruptly, leaving him in mindless pain that rivalled that of the cruciatus curse, unable to relieve some of the agony with screams.
Draco might have attacked the man, if not physically, then at least verbally, were it not for Blaise coming to stand next to him at that very moment and grasping his shoulder. Insistently his fiancé turned him towards him, demanding his attention.
“Shit.” He groaned, gazing through tears of pain into the ghostly pale eyes of the stag. He couldn’t make out any emotions in those icy depths but the animal stood frozen just as he did. Unmoving because it had recognized him? Draco hoped so. He hoped it was over, he hoped Blaise was alive, hoped they’d all be still alive in a few minutes.
"Potter - Harry." Zabini said, his lilting voice calm and low. "Please dress and join us in the garden. We will explain everything then."
“That was not my intention.” He said calmly but the blonde ignored him.
"By Morgaine, why not? You certainly have had enough time!" Lucius snapped, his long fingers clawing into the upholstering of his arm rest.
"A-huh." Harry murmured though he really had no idea where that was; he had never been very good at geography. For a moment, he busied himself by watching the liquid swirl around in his glass like molten gold. That was better than trying to hold the Slytherins' weird gazes; those were starting to really freak him out…
And he kept flapping.
Blaise felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips, completely approving of the cautious answer. Now he was convinced that Harry would be good for Draco, able and willing to give him the opportunity that Blaise couldn't: the fair opportunity to honestly prove himself to someone who was neither prepossessed for him nor would pass judgement on him based on actions he had done while he was little more than a child or teenager under the thumbs of its parents. One person more who might come to honestly appreciate the Slytherin Prince for something else than his reputation.
them? Honestly, they would so get along with Hermione if only they would change their attitudes and start speaking normally with muggleborns.
"Which you'll see when we get there." Draco murmured close to his ears, making the hairs on Harry's neck raise. "And on the way there we are going to play pugna aerea – aerial combat – and since you are already experienced in warfare, I expect us to win, Harry."
Mancini hummed sceptically. "I think he's Italian; and he seemed familiar somehow. Before hearing your assessment, I was rather certain that he belonged to the Lanais."
T-A-K-E-M-E-H-O-S-T-A-G-E-A-N-D-B-A-R-G-A-I-N-F-O-R-Y-O-U-R-F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Maybe it was better this way, though; Harry wouldn't have had an inkling as to what to say to them anyway. Any apology that might measure up to what he had done to them, to all the trouble he had caused them, would need more than a few pathetic seconds filled with stammered half-finished sentences.
, it might be worth it... Merlin, he couldn't stop shivering with rage and disgust!
But the half-expected agony didn't come. Neither did the weight that his wings should have made his back bear and the mirror showed no change when, after some moments, he finally blinked one eye open.
Gradually his lung started to burn from the lack of air, a sign that his little retreat into the silence of the water was about to end. A pity that, he could have used some more time alone with his thoughts.
Harry would have no choice but to give himself to them, establish the connection and let them do whatever they wanted to him. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived could be his – body, mind and magic – without much of an effort.
Blaise chuckled as he reached for his wand and flicked it at the ties to release them. "Mmm. But you were glorious." Mischievously he cocked his head and smirked. "Nonetheless we should hurry and clean up if we want to speak to your father before getting Harry for breakfast."
"Yes." Draco nodded, once again falling into his teacher-role, eager to give his charge more of an understanding of what it entailed to be a Vykélari. "You opted now for wings that are well suited for a high speed flight. But flying with these will cost you much energy, either magical or physical. Different shapes are suitable for different aspects of flight, you know. Long, narrow wings are well-suited for a slow, gliding flight and soaring. Short, curved wings that are broad and have a roughly elliptical shape make for an agile flight. And now, if you'd lengthen the outer feathers and spread them to get slots in between them, you'd be able to glide for hours – if the wind is favourable and your magic strong enough, which of course won't be a problem for you. Well, and they will support an easier take-off, so I'd advise you to lengthen the primary feathers… that are the ones on the outer side, at the wing tip." he added when Harry blinked at him uncomprehendingly.
"What have they done to you, Harry?" He whispered, thinking of Dumbledore, Voldemort, all the choices Harry had been forced to make and had been so unprepared for. Of this kidnapper who was now pushing the Gryffindor in a corner once again.
"I knew you of all people wouldn't let yourself be held back by memories." He whispered into the younger Gryffindor's ear, staring at the submissive's reflection in something akin to warm pride, but Harry could hear the smug  smile in his voice.
"How would you know about his childhood? I thought you hated him…" Draco asked.
Fixing his glare on his lover's form, he growled lowly in open annoyance. He wanted to
Neither did they give up. Strategic, orderly retreats, sure… feigned surrenders, of course; better than failure in any case. But Malfoy’s didn’t accept defeats, they didn’t leave anything untried as long as there was still the tiniest possibility of success.
"I didn't believe it. But he … he feels like one."
"Blaise!"
Blaise chuckled lowly and rolled his shoulders. He could feel his own wings press against the skin of his back, wanting to show themselves, flaunt the blazing tones of bronze, copper and gold to seduce the being in front of him. But Draco wouldn't like that. As a dominant his instincts would tell him that the other male was challenging him, and though Draco would know at heart that that wasn't true, the mood would be destroyed beyond reclaim.
"I would ask for your forgiveness, if I thought you would give it."
"Eleuterio is a highly respectable man and furthermore a good friend of mine, so watch what you say, boy!" The man warned, thrusting his finger into Draco's shoulder so hard that he had to take a step back and Blaise snarled, his elongated fangs exposed threateningly, as he pushed himself partly in front of his lover.
Harry couldn’t help the mirthful, embarrassed, incredulous laugh bubbling out of him and he didn’t even try.
What had he been thinking about? Oh, god, yes … touching: this was Malfoy, and he was
He was already half convinced that it hadn't worked, that he

him?"
"We didn't realise how bad he was taking the news of his heritage." Blaise continued, his voice still a little bit tight, as he sat down next to his fiancé. "I tried to push him into accepting it and his magic reacted. It retracted all the changes of his transformation and afterwards he was exhausted and seemed even more reluctant." There was really no need to tell them that Harry's accidental magic had attacked him.
"I take it, this diverges from the norm?" The question came surprisingly easily over his lips, considering how apprehensive Draco had been. Was this maybe just an irregularity that would diminish or maybe even vanish in time?
Draco blinked, then looked up, aghast. "God, Blaise, my father! Merlin, I'll kill you! Did you have to be so rough knowing we'd meet with him? If I can't walk or sit down in front of him without wincing, I'll castrate you! Would rid me of some major problems!"
"Shut up!" Harry snarled. He didn't want to hear the foul lies, he only wanted his friends free! Only wanted to return to Lanai, no Zabini manor, back to Blaise and Draco; he was safe with them and he liked them. He liked them! Who the hell was Valerio to tell him otherwise?
"Don't be impatient, Harry. A little bit of magical theory never hurt anyone."
"I always am."
“After all those years, after everything Lucius did for you, you throw our friendship away as if it meant nothing and betray us!”
Not losing any time, Ettore had contacted his father, the current Generale of the guardia who had then summoned an extraordinary meeting between the minister and the Senato della Magia, the official legislature of the Italian wizarding community, who upon hearing what had transpired that night decreed an official disempowerment of the Italian Vykélari council, enabling the guardia to interfere into a courtship and legally search for the submissive.
Immediately the former Gryffindor startled and strained against his bonds in rising panic at the unexpected touch; his wings rose, beating mindlessly around him, hitting against the ceiling and the walls. Both Blaise and Draco barely managed to dodge the strong appendages, jumping back from Potter's side to come to stand in front of him, at the headboard, where the emerald wings couldn't reach them.
Harry looked up into the black eyes of the tanned Italian, swallowing thickly around the lump in his throat. What if he didn't want to be powerful? But he knew what the Slytherin implied: he could do much good, if only he accepted his new status.
I don’t even know yet if any of them will play any important role, but still I find even the thought too depressing…
That he was using it nonetheless would tell Blaise more efficiently just what the situation had deteriorated to than any other explanation ever could. Sure enough, Draco felt his lover's chest stop moving and his hand froze against his skin for a moment before it resumed to rub slowly over his back as if the Italian had needed to remind his body forcefully to continue working.
Draco couldn’t think like that, he had never been one to deal well with the kind of stress and pressure that came with fear and everything in him balked at the prospect of willingly flying into this inferno, of allowing Blaise to do so, Blaise whom he just couldn't face to lose…
But the uncoordinated movements unbalanced the lightweight hospital bed to which Potter was still tied and almost immediately it started to tip over.
He opened his eyes, narrow and thoughtful as he sobered and awoke from the rapture of the moment and immediately he had to battle down the vertigo that his body experienced from seeing two overlying images. It only lasted some moments before he managed to block out Harry's sight but still it added to his sudden discomfort.
"You looked good together…" He murmured absentmindedly, his head cocked to the side, dark eyes following the line of Harry's jaw and mouth unblinkingly. Blaise licked his lips.
"Right." Harry said and kneaded the knuckles of his wand-hand, not quite convinced, yet very much determined to forget about pressures and lift for now and to fly like he had always flown on a broom: by instinct.
For a few more moments her gaze bore into the firm black eyes, then finally she relented.
Blaise leaned in closer, holding her gaze intently and letting her see his graveness, the anxiousness. "We  are not sure what happened," he conceded, "but his behaviour led us to believe that the blackmail was about Granger and Weasley, maybe even Weasley's sister. He has been forced to leave, of that there is no doubt. And even if I lied, Daphne, even if I wanted to use you to get Harry back and force him to mate – don't you think I know that I would never get away with suddenly reappearing in London with the Golden Boy as my mate, now that the public is already thinking us to be his abusers? The Wizengamot would probably just allow someone, most likely Harry himself, to put a compulsion on me and Draco so that we could not use Harry's power. Even mated Vykélari are not invincible and Harry would manage the impossible somehow; he always does. Then they'd probably take all our possessions and money and gave it to him as well. We'd be ostracized! What power a mating would potentially bring would become useless in the torrent of hate the wizarding community would heap on our heads. He is their hero and they will not stand for him being taken advantage of. I have no illusions about that."
Hmm. That probably meant no.
As the younger wizard's heart jumped to life again and his chest heaved with a sudden intake of much needed breath, Severus' eyes snapped open, widening as he saw light congealing in the gaping cut, not enough to close it or to even begin healing, but enough to let a steady heartbeat echo through the aorta in his stomach, visible in the rhythmic pulsing of the skin above his belly button.
"Yes, it is possible." Adler said at last, the corner of his lips twitching into an unwilling smile. "It rather is like the physical transformation: the first time everything will be established once and then it can be retracted and brought forth again at will."
But just as he saw and heard the other House Elves appear in a line along the eastern wards a scream ripped through the air, chilling him to the core.
, Narcissa,” He ground out harshly, ignoring her disbelieving huff, “not your servant. The difference being that if you ask me to stand aside and let you do something that will destroy your family, I don't actually have to do it.”
And all the while, Blaise was unaware of Harry's inner struggle. He only saw the submissive's palpably dazed and stunned amazement, an amazement that he shared, even if not as strongly.
, wanted that supple body quivering from his touch alone and those expressive eyes to shine up at him, entranced by the wings he'd spread over them like a canopy of white feathers, and yet with that burning defiance that screamed that there was no one Harry Potter would yield to completely. As it should be.
he really was... but somehow he doubted he'd have to resort to any underhanded tactics, well, as long as Blaise managed to keep his hands to himself that is. Aside from that, the two Slytherins had shown themselves surprisingly willing to compromise.
"And this is my wife, Ricarda," with an elegant but curt wave he indicated the woman in the arm chair who didn't give as much as a nod to greet Harry with, only regarding him coolly and Harry found himself despising her almost as much as her husband.
"I suppose." Daphne gave him a tight, humourless smile. "After all a dominant Vykélari wouldn't have revealed his and his chosen submissive's location for some bagatelle." And she waved towards the pair of two-way mirrors between them that was a clear indication of their respective whereabouts, as if there was no deeper meaning to that seemingly careless remark.
And Draco was
Maybe his mind had been weakened and held under the control of another, that might explain… Slowly Severus shook his head. If Potter had been under his kidnapper's control so entirely as to leave him unable to heal himself from a life-threatening injury, there would hardly have been any need at all to hurt him in the first place.
The very idea of not taking advantage of that fortunate happenstance was inconceivable. Of course it was wrong that the Gryffindor had ever been subjected to the spying potion, but Draco would use it to his advantage nonetheless. Besides, he rather thought Harry might forgive him if it helped safe his friends and keep him from having to mate with his blackmailer.
For the blink of an eye it was as if the entire courtyard had fallen into a limbo of shock and silence, the situation too unreal for any of the Lanais to grasp; too quick a change from the sure victory of a few seconds ago to allow them any sort of reaction. As if under a spell they stood and gaped, faint and numb and paralyzed, staring at Valerio’s wavering form as he clutched at the stump of his hand.
“Yes, yes of course. I’m sorry Mr Malfoy…” If that impertinent fool would stop apologizing so much, he might be faster in getting his point across, Lucius thought impatiently; he needed more information...
One by one he pulled the yellowed documents from their respective places in the tall, dark bookshelves and spread them out on one of the brightly illuminated tables to brood over his lecture, trying to find out as much as he could about Vykélari mating habits and submissives in general.
It was because he hadn't been helpless and because he had prevailed over his enemies, Hermione had said with a shrug of her shoulders as if it was totally normal and understandable that he was not traumatized by what he had been through while so many around them fought to keep the memories from ruling their behaviour and their life. Hermione always had an answer.
"Don't be stupid!" Blaise drawled haughtily, cocking his head "Why would we torture you? And we did not kidnap you; we took you into … preventive custody."
Shaking the gloomy thoughts from his mind, Ron slowly made his way back into the Burrow and the kitchen, the mirror clutched in his hand.
"Of course." Adler conceded. "We shall speak about it after attending to the other concerns that brought you to me."
With a quiet, disparaging smirk, the older man leaned forward conspiratorially.
But why, then, had the red-haired submissive run Draco's family down like that? And what exactly had he managed to persuade Harry with?
Suddenly the door to the conference room was pushed open, bouncing off the wall with a loud, resonating bang that pierced Blaise to the core, the too fast beating of his heart stuttering and stumbling as if the pacemaker cells had lost their rhythm like an interrupted music ensemble falling silent one after another.
hex you! It was your own magic, Harry! I swear…"
The possibility left him reeling, the spark of hope almost too painful to bear, a flare that consumed his breath for the endless span of a moment.
"Please forgive this charade." He said, in a voice smoother and slicker than it had been before. "But I had to stay on the save side in case you bailed on our agreement. You may call me Valerio." The man inclined his head, his dark eyes never leaving Harry's.
Now he could make out Malfoy’s pale skin and hair and it seemed to
But the streams of sparkles were pulled closer to the metal with growing strength and speed and they were absorbed without taking effect, sucked right into the cursed thing. Harry didn't understand it at first, his thoughts too raw and hurt, too agitated… and it didn't seem as important as the sight that hit him if he twisted his head just so: there was Ron, his Ron and Harry could see the way he gurgled and gasped for breath that he couldn't draw – his killer must have cancelled the magical paralysis to delight in his victim's agony – and he could see him cough and spit and try to get rid of all the blood that was running into his lung, could see him twitch and writhe in pain and fear and he was dying! He was dying and Harry could only watch! Could only watch until those watery blue eyes finally stopped their mad dance, and his so familiar features went lax.
"Actually, my parents were married," Blaise amended contemplatively while he moved to stand near Potter's head. "But even if I were, I'd be all yours, and you, Draco, have agreed to be all mine just last week." And with that he gripped his lover's neck and pulled him close for a searing, deep kiss, his other hand still resting on a blissfully oblivious Potter's shoulder, directing sparks of magic into it while pouring all the pent-up desperate hunger into the kiss.
Harry ignoring problems? Ron frowned in thought, that wasn't something Harry would normally do. His best friend never shied away from problems; sometimes he postponed dealing with them but he never denied having them and in the end he always took responsibility. What had the two dominants done to Harry to make him 'ignore' his inheritance out of spite? Or were they lying?
Narcissa inclined her head in acknowledgement at her son's reminder, but it was Lucius who answered, now calmer once again, sure of the support of his wife and Amalyne and reassured by their confidence in their little plan. "The situation has changed."
Perhaps he was even more than his parents combined: forgiving, where they hadn't been, accepting and understanding of how people could be swept along by the wrong ideals and beliefs, when even his righteous mother had never quite forgiven Severus for calling her a mudblood, for befriending the conservative purebloods of Slytherin House,
"Not according to Vykélari laws; no we didn't." Malfoy said, all humour vanished from his face and voice and his expression was so hard and grave that Harry had to swallow, suddenly unsure. What if it was true? What if they really had the right to kidnap him?
broke forth from his hand instead and immediately attacked us... I don't think they have any control over their magic right now."
Suddenly Harry felt a spark of indignation at himself, surging through him and making his magic solidify and coil and hum in excitement within him. That vision of the fragile little bird wasn’t him, was less than he was and he’d prove it, to himself and anyone else who might or might not be doubting it.
He had been surprised that for the moment there had been no hidden agenda to be felt at the back of their minds. Instead, their presences in his own mind had been so comforting and soothing, chasing away all of his apprehensions at the transformation for the time being and cradling his curiosity and amazement like something precious.
of that woman, he silently cursed as he went over the article.
than Harry had expected, even if it was nowhere near as pompous and palatial as many of the manors in Britain, more inviting and homely. Warm.
This was not an easy chapter to write, and I guess it won’t be easy to read, so proceed at your own discretion.
"What about his childhood?" Narcissa asked. "Why do you say he has issues with deprivation of liberty and … bullies?"
'Oh, Merlin, please deny it!' Harry thought, looking from Zabini to Malfoy and back, feeling more horrified with every passing moment of silence. But his kidnappers only shared a carefully neutral glance before observing him once more. 'Oh god, it's true.'
"Mr Potter," the old man interrupted him with his scratchy voice, practically thrusting the robe right under his nose. His intense eyes seemed to almost beg him to comply, conveying a warning so clear that it had Harry's stomach clench into tight knots with anxious frustration and he swallowed the biting comments about to tumble from his lips, lowering his gaze as he berated himself. He was in no position to anger his captors, and by god, he didn't want his friends to pay the price because he couldn't stop himself from smart-mouthing.
"Asshole!" Harry muttered beneath his breath, turned and strode away, afraid of what he might be doing if he stayed for a moment longer. Or what Blaise might be doing...
The question earned him a smile that bordered on tenderness and another brush against his cheek with adept fingers. "I can take care of myself, don't worry."
All of them had their wands drawn and at the ready, firmly held in one hand that was raised waist-high, not quite pointing at Harry yet, but the fracture of a second away from doing so. Their appearance betrayed their readiness to attack, dressed for duelling as they were with clothes that were easy to move in and wouldn't hinder or slow them down. Their hair – even the men wore it long – was tied back and their postures spoke of a level of experience that was unsettling: the slightly bowed knees and wide, secure stances, the ease in the wrists of their wand-arms… these wizards probably knew their spell-work, their calm confidence and poise said as much.
There the two women were headed, Narcissa following Amalyne, tense and apprehensive, past the roses that were still quivering with the desire to attack them. It made Narcissa's already strained nerves fray more and more beneath her near perfect mask until she felt as if she was disintegrating from the inside, as if there was a black hole beneath her feet that tore bits and pieces out of her soul into its depths, leaving only a shell behind like a hollow porcelain doll.
They were no longer the irritating, easy-to-rile schoolboys he had known, Harry thought as he studied them, even though they were still irritating enough, or maybe even more so now that he was at their mercy and had to take them seriously for once.
The transformation be damned, he needed it to stop before he lost his mind! He writhed and squirmed in Malfoy’s arms, trying to free his hands and tear and scratch until it stopped itching! An eagle-scream tore from his lips, gaining in volume and pitching until he didn’t have any more air.
"Harry?"
And Blaise gave Potter's wayward magic something to do, telling it to take his own auditory senses as a model to reform those of its owner. He felt that wave of power flood him like a tsunami, invading him inexorably and he wondered if his cousin who had guided his own transformation had felt like that: stripped bare before the magic of the young fledgeling that was Potter for Merlin's sake! It was a strangely intimate feeling that he really wasn't comfortable with.
Oh, what wouldn’t he have given for James Potter to lie still and helpless before him like this only once. The things he could, would have done to him given that one golden chance...
He didn't point that out though, it was always good to be underestimated by ones' enemies.
At nearly the same time, the wizarding community in Germany had reacted to the war in Britain with another security measure as was their wont whenever an act of violence happened, be it within their own country and jurisdiction or not.  But this time they had brought forth an innovation that would actually gain currency in major parts of Europe. A Wira Wespe had invented a certain charm that could be ingrained into a wand and prevent the wielder from using certain spells, mainly the Unforgivables and other potentially deathly charms which included a large variety of offensive magic.
, he thought with a mental sigh
Up and down, up and down, smoothly, steadily. And then he reduced his weight, wished himself to be lighter. He did that gradually until he knew that with much force, he would theoretically be able to get off the ground with several strong beats. But he wouldn't. He didn't have the strength anymore, because Blaise and Draco had been right and using muscles he had never used before was just so damn exhausting…
– were desperately trying to reach them, only Taide remained to witness Harry’s magic taking form. He and his father, who lay on the ground as if paralyzed, cradling the stump of his wand-arm, staring with wide but empty eyes at that puddle of poisoned blackness.
"Lucius!" Severus interrupted once again, his voice sharp with reproach as he sat up in his chair. "Get hold of yourself!"
"It's okay, Harry." Blaise murmured soothingly while once again, Draco cut away the bindings from his body. It was a relief when his arms came free and weren't pressed to his uncomfortably hot torso any longer, retaining the warmth further that seemed to smother his body.
having silent conversations of all people?"
To add to his embarrassment, the Italian was not yet finished. "If they do, don't hesitate to speak up right away or to search us out.
"Of course I do. I presume you went to the Aurors?"
Then, slowly they eased down, almost floating, the rustle of their robes the only noise in the quiet night air, until they kneeled on the ground in that bloody pool of velvet, not once breaking each other's gaze. Each movement was given so much attention, and it all looked so awfully much like the preparation for some kind of ritual that Harry really, really didn't want to witness…
"HARRY!" He shouted, his heart skipping a beat when the young man turned with a swift, abrupt step to the side that brought him from the darkness into the softest, faintest touch of light coming from one of the garden torches illuminating the driveway.
"No, just listen for a moment!" The brunet exclaimed exasperatedly. "Lucius is a right bastard and I'm pretty sure I won't like many of your ancestors either…"
He, Lucius Malfoy.
Whatever the cost, he wouldn't let Hermione or Ron remain at the mercy of these vile bastards for a second longer than necessary. He would bring them home, see that they'd recover. He would.
And that thought almost made his magic break out of his control, spreading into his muscles and mind, embedding itself in every fibre, urging and pushing to force him to search for the two dominants that might save him, but not his friends. The need, the overwhelming desire, was there but Harry could recognize the source now, could understand that the two Slytherins would not let him leave and do what he had to. He pushed it down, strangled it ruthlessly and wrapped it into more steely determination. No amount of wailing and lamenting would change anything.
Frantically Harry looked around, his eyes rushing over the smooth surface of the chimney piece. Yes! There stood a small, silver box with rich ornaments right on top of it, so prominently that one couldn't miss it. Quickly, he stepped towards it, and with no thought to curses or traps that might be ingrained in the tin, he grabbed it, opened the delicate deadlock and flicked the lid open.
Feigning nonchalance, he calmly returned her piercing gaze. "Four…"
Ron … Hermione!
about him, not even Ginny, brave and pragmatic Gin. But the faint surprise was sluggish and went to sleep as soon as it had started to awake, helped along by the soothing, very distracting flow of magic, Harry's and Blaise's.
Draco frowned a little bit offended. "Are we back to surnames, now?"
"Horrible, I know. If not for Adler's painting threatening him with terrible revenge, I'm sure he would have burnt my painting already. He wanted me to spy on the living Prewetts through my other painting during the first war and when I refused … well, he pretty much has hated me since then."
"He is staring, because you look beautiful." He offered, delighting in the indignantly embarrassed blush it got him and while his fiancé was still staring at their charge, proving that he was not at all sorry, he took Harry's hand and - despite the other's best attempts at pulling it away instantly, managed to press a light kiss onto the knuckles. Harry hissed and immediately snatched his hand away the moment the Italian released it. Even the skin on his ears and neck had flushed by now. Blaise never would have thought that he would find something like that adorable, but with Harry, it was.
"I'm sorry that your transformation went like that. It's … meant to be a joyous event. My parents were so proud when I did, I … I think they were not sure I would be powerful enough." Draco murmured, his guilt pushing him towards honesty. He hadn't thought about what that experience might have done to the submissive, not for a moment. He had just expected Harry to pick himself up and go on, like he always did, had expected him to fight them and with time, to give in to them.
Almost Harry wished that the damned potion had worked, at least then he might be able to mate the damned asshole and get it over and done with. But as if his magic recognized it as an intruder, it attacked the foreign influence viciously, encapsulating and absorbing it until Harry could think clearly again. Only the golden velvety Hesperide's Nectar burned through his body irresistibly. But instead of dazing him like he feared it would, it strengthened him instead with its invigorating sparks of pure, natural magic, chasing away his weariness and leaving him more alert, yet still filled with rage, disgust and anxiousness and the desperate feeling of being trapped. It felt like being crawled over by millions of ants.
Blaise felt his lips part in consternation as he stared at his mother. "You cannot possibly think that you could ever keep something like that a secret."
"Strong-willed and stubborn just as much as Blaise is. They will not want your intervention, nor will they allow or accept it."
“Now, you really should go.” Lucius said with a smirk. “I told them to leave the boy alone but still…”
He bit his lips as his mind played over his short conversation with the two Slytherins. They had flirted with him openly, which had been quite a new experience for Harry and left him feeling uncomfortable around them and yet it had also raised a nervous flutter in his stomach at the same time that was not all that bad, though very much humiliating. But still they hadn't touched him inappropriately in any way and although especially Draco had made the one or the other biting remark, they had been generally suave.
Draco would have forsaken Harry just as easily and quickly as he had been forsaken.
"Harry," Draco started cautiously. "Are you really, absolutely, positively straight?"
Huffing, Daphne turned aside, pushing her chin forward defiantly. But that she wouldn't continue to hold his gaze, the little spark of insecurity right before she had faced away – it gave him hope. "And that is why we need to get him out of Italy back to Britain as soon as possible. I have one emergency portkey left, and Harry is wearing another one, if they haven't discovered it and taken it away from him by now. But I need someone there at my safe-house to make sure he stays safe."
"So you have another chance at controlling me? No, thanks, asshole!" And the Gryffindor continued to struggle and squirm within Blaise's tight embrace.
He had been far too arrogant, so sure of his capabilities as a renowned potions master that he had ignored his suspicions that something had been wrong with the young Vykélari’s magic. Instead Severus had blithely fed him those potions like a reckless Gryffindor. The very potions that had pushed the boy into a magical shock and subsequent cardiac arrest. Any ailment that he suffered from now beyond the initial stab wound was a direct result of that particular foolishness.
the ministry won't give you leave to use a portkey, especially not in the middle of the night. But I do already have a portkey to Zabini Manor."
Again the beast shook its massive legs and snorted angrily, but it took a step closer and Draco waited anxiously with bated breath. ‘Come on!’ He begged inwardly.
Maybe he should ask the other submissive in the morning what their shrewd behaviour had been about. He wasn't sure if the redhead would answer, but surely at least he wouldn't outright lie.
"Did you know, Harry, that some birds court by dancing with their prospective partners?" He asked with such an utterly straight face that Harry wondered for a moment if he had heard correctly. Was he being asked to dance?
"Then by all means, send them to the manor." Blaise said a little bit impatiently. "Now Draco and I should take our leave; we don't want to keep Harry waiting after all."
"Only a fool would..."
"This! This happened!"
“Fine,” he muttered, looking up from his now empty plate with what he hoped was an indifferent expression. “Really I…” but then his voice died away and he gasped for air in surprise and shock: a weird, tugging sensation overcame him like a shockwave that made him flinch. His fingers started to tingle and prick before they went painfully cold, the feeling spreading through his stiffening knuckles like frost and ice.
A little bit displeased at the way Adler kept advising him over things that had been taught to him even before he had entered Hogwarts (granted, he had not always acted on his teachings), Draco pursed his lips, his cool eyes full of unspoken stinging hexes. "Please, Adler, spare me the lectures."
He had a plan to follow as well: create an illusion of weakness, get to Hermione and Ron and free them and if it wasn't feasible, attack and force those men to relinquish his friends. Should that possibility be out of reach as well, if it came to the worst, there was still one last emergency plan resting reassuringly against the skin of his wrist in the form of a thin bracelet: the portkey Blaise had given him. It was only an insignificant weight, almost invisible, one he had considered to be a thoughtful but ultimately useless excrescence of paranoia. Now it might save not only his life, but those of his friends as well. He could escape to England, rally his allies, the press, the minister… anyone. He could witness to the extent of cruelty hidden within a major part of their society; and with his fame, with his own reputation and position, he could denounce it. He could stop it and hope it wouldn't be too late for his friends by then.
"My wand first!" Harry ground out. Really he didn't want to stay defenceless a minute longer than necessary, especially in the company of someone who had been the bane of his existence throughout his days at Hogwarts.
Blaise shrugged unperturbed. "But it generally saves especially human resources to use more sly tactics then a direct onset. 'He will be victorious, who prepared himself to strike at his unprepared enemy'(1)."
But Amalyne was still the mother that had raised him and had been a major influence throughout his youth and neither Blaise nor his father's relatives would ever forget that little fact.
As loath as he was at having to admit it, Draco didn't know him. Most of Blaise's relatives wore their hair long just as the purebloods had done for centuries once they left school and started to build their own lives and his face was plain and nondescript, a face like one might find thousands in Italy.
But all that knowledge was unimportant while he laid there in a foreign bed, looking up at the blurry image of the fresco in which the birds just started to flutter around and greet the new day, while all around him foreign smells and sounds permeated the night air. The soft murmuring of the rolling waves and the salty freshness the wind brought to his window only emphasized it: he didn't belong here.
If Blaise had taken a hold of both of Harry's ankles, he might not have succeeded in slowing the Gryffindor enough to prevent both of them from passing the wards in the last moment. But as it was, Harry couldn't assume the correct pose for flying once again: he couldn't straighten, didn't manage to get his legs in one line with his torso; even worse: the heavy weight of the Italian's body, hanging so suddenly from only one of his legs, threw him completely off course.
There were three basic means by which a team could score points: being the first to arrive at the previously agreed goal was worth 80 points. Hitting members of the opposing teams brought 5 points per hit.
In retrospect, they didn't seem much different from when he had seen them at Malfoy's trial not so long ago; but he hadn't really taken note of their appearance then. Now, in the middle of the sunlit, beautiful garden with no other people around them, no task like the awkward returning of a wand to distract him, Harry couldn't help but notice how different they looked from when all three of them had still been at Hogwarts.
They had to, because the wizarding world in England was changing, those of lesser blood and a notable disregard for the traditions that had made their society what it was today, were gaining power and the purebloods would need to adapt or be pushed from the stage to the stands.
In fact, Blaise had been uncharacteristically close to shouting at the little miscreant, the Italian lilt in his voice worse than ever, when at last he had relented: with a final, almost disdainful sniff and a violent jerk of his oversized head that just might have been a nod, the Elf had asked him to wait and shuffled out of the room, leaving Blaise to stare restlessly at the undoubtedly tasteful décor of Daphne's study that did nothing to distract him from the dark anticipation of Daphne's reaction to his plea, or prevent his thoughts from drifting towards Harry like grimly gleaming iron filings towards a magnet, and to what he'd be forced to do soon or – Merlin forbid – right now.
He couldn't help it, Harry had to laugh at Ron's wary question. "Yes, they are."
Cautiously, Lucius observed his friend. Of course he had known that Severus wouldn't react well to the news but he hadn't thought it would be quite this bad.
"He cannot be controlled!" The black haired man growled, starting to pace the room.
Which was quite alright in Draco's books: he couldn't wait witnessing so closely how Harry would experience his first conscious transformation.
Inclining his head, his lips drawn into a thin, tense line, healer Cowan pushed the door open and entered, closely followed by the Mediwizard and then both Blaise and Draco.
A breathy laugh broke from his lips. "I won't ever have a problem with my Patronus again, that's for – Ah!" Blaise cried out as Draco bit down too hard and drew blood and he viciously tugged at the soft, platinum strands in revenge.
"Did you touch him?" He asked in a low murmur, deceptively gently nibbling at the other young man's earlobe as he rocked against him, making him shudder and arch into his movements.
to fend for himself!
"Blaise." The blonde glanced at the darker Italian, his brow deeply furrowed. Family meant much to a pureblood, always would, the concept all too deeply ingrained in their upbringing, their society and traditions. Now they might be forced to directly go up against all that they had believed in and if their determination faltered for only a single, crucial moment, it might turn out to be better for Harry and for them to never have started.
Like any pathetic muggle.
Blaise allowed one corner of his mouth to raise even though he was not amused, in no way, but he knew it would irritate the raven and that in itself would make him feel better. Besides, he knew Draco was smirking next to him for some reason or another, and it was better to present a united front against Gryffindor stupidity. Come to think of it, his fiancé had been smirking silently since shortly after Alfar had hunted down Potter.
Of course, there were a lot more sinister scars from his time in the magical world, mementos of his glorious adventures, souvenirs from his time in the limelight as a famous hero.
In any case the fact remained that if they didn't find a way for such a conversation to occur, the submissive would turn away from them for sure. Because this was also a test for Draco and Blaise and if they didn't pass it, their chances with the young Vykélari were forfeited.
"What are you doing here, Ferret?"
And according to the restaurant's staff, the three men had had a wonderful time together: laughing, joking, dancing. They'd been there for hours.
and Blaise rolled his eyes, only glad that the brunette had not been affronted by Draco's complacent manner, even though he had suspected she wouldn't. The last thing they needed right now was an angry Harry blaming them for deliberately annoying his friends.
He would have offered Draco free rein, had not Ives interrupted that moment, making them all turn to him once more. "Draco, Blaise, why don't you have the house elves send a light breakfast up for Mr Potter and leave us alone so we can talk undisturbed?"
For some moments, Ives let the silence between them spread as he considered the younger submissive. "Do you know why I asked to be brought here and be able to speak to you?"
"You were the one who said it would be better if Harry were to enter a mating bond willingly."
Usually Severus was rather proficient in compartmentalising his emotions whenever they didn’t mix well. Instead of enforcing an emulsion through sheer patience and effort like many less efficient and practical minds were often wont to do, the potions master tended to simply pick the one most useful to him and ignore the others, incarcerating them in the far recesses of his mind until such a time as they could be picked apart or sometimes be forgotten until they shrivelled, died and rotted away into dust and dirt.
Even though… if Harry had been in Slytherin, if he had befriended Draco and Pansy and Blaise instead of Granger and Weasley, he would not have lived long enough to see his 222nd full moon. It was the unadorned truth, nothing more and nothing less. And what a humbling, shameful truth it was; one of the sobering few (but considering his blood status surprisingly numerous) reasons of his budding respect for Harry's friends, next to Granger's obvious brilliance and the few glimpses of a tactical, sharp mind Weasley had occasionally shown.
Ettore cursed under his breath at the terrible injustice of it all. It simply wasn't fair.
"Two!"
Harry shook his head but gestured towards his eyes with is free hand. God, not being able to speak was so frustrating… fortunately the other two men seemed to have understood what he wanted: One of them came to stand behind him again, laid one hand on his forehead and guided his head backwards until it rested on a hard, muscular shoulder. Harry frowned for a moment, becoming aware that he must be at least a few inches smaller.
"Don't think of it now and don't pressure yourself. You've been through so much... let Draco and me show you around the Manor today and then, if you are not too tired, we could go swimming - either in the pool or the sea, whatever you prefer. Tomorrow you should be rested enough that we can explore your magic together and maybe fly a bit. You have no obligations here, Harry. Try to enjoy it and take all the time you need to familiarize yourself with your new abilities."
submissive Vykélari desirous? Did he desire them in turn or only their magic or was that all his magic? So many questions and he couldn't even find an answer to one of them.
Mrs Zabini had given him the idea, if he remembered correctly, barely three months into his new career on the night of the 31st of October to the 1st of November.
Cursing, minister Nascimbeni laid a twitching hand over his chest, grimacing as if beset with heartburn at the very thought of a horde of news hungry journalists.
Hopefully unaware of his line of thoughts, Harry interrupted them nonetheless as he spoke up, looking at him cautiously.
He shot up from his chair, swaying a little bit as his battered cardiovascular system fought to keep up with him. But he managed to steady himself with the back of his chair and glared down at the two Slytherins.
Twitching legs of dying spiders.
Yes, how was he to tell Draco?
Adler confirms that it is possible to close an established mating bond and thus maintain a level of privacy. He then tells Draco about Harry's deal with Ives (Harry giving the Slytherins the chance to woo him in return for a free pass to leave on the 31st of August). Draco is angry but understands why Harry did it. He and Blaise later decide not to mention anything to Harry and instead make it seem as if they had planned to return to Hogwarts with Harry all along. Harry believes them.
Hey guys, I know it’s been practically forever. But I’ve finished university now!!! My master thesis took a lot of time, so I hope you can forgive me. I hope it’s going to become better from now on but it is difficult. I’m a computer scientist and somehow my friends and family take offence if I sit in front of my Laptop during my free time.
It was an interesting perspective that Draco had never seen himself out of and he shared in the perturbed fascination of the young submissive, as the muscles and bone structure beneath his skin shifted, creating a new joint for the powerful wings and the muscles that would carry him through the summer air.
That of course didn't mean that Hermione and Ron wouldn't keep on trying. The famous Golden Trio's smart one had spent the last few days and a good portion of her savings in various more or less respectable bookshops with rather disappointing results. But finally after days and nights of asking, begging, demanding and reading, so much reading, there might be the first hint of a silver lining: just this very morning an elderly ministry owl had delivered a copy of the Vykélari laws. It had been a real nightmare to get one, too and Hermione had needed Percy's help, who, in his best lecturing, know-it-all manner, had threatened the ministry employee in charge with an official complaint and legal consequences for curtailing their right of access.
A son who quickly proved to be worth far more than his father. And wasn't that rich? Not a year ago Draco had been a brat who wouldn't have been able to control his own emotions if his life depended on it; only that, once his life did depend on it, he had reigned himself in, sometimes with obvious difficulties, but he had managed. Now, as if fate was playing one of her cynical games again, it was Lucius who had become the childish, sulking brat. And hadn't Severus told Harry in their Occlumency lessons that this was the ultimate sign of weakness?
Moreover, Draco still owed the brat a life-debt. One that had been acknowledged and accepted which meant that the debt would only be settled if Potter
It was as if a veil had been ripped from Draco’s eyes because once he had seen her, ever more corpses and severed body parts started to stand out against the smouldering ruins of the cloister garden, like the requisites of a nightmare.
But when the Comissario Mancini called his name once again, he followed, his dragon leather boots scrunching as he walked over the white gravel.
But as Draco had said that day they went swimming in the sea: for the two Slytherins all that they had given him so far was nothing extraordinary. And it wasn't as if Harry would ever need them to finance such kinds of activities if he decided that he didn’t want them to stay something extraordinary for him either: even if he decided not to mate his two hosts, even if he managed to get away with mating no one at all, Harry was still the sole heir to the Potter fortune and had inherited most of Sirius' possessions as well. He would never have to depend on anyone to uphold or reach a certain live standard and his hosts knew that well.
With a disdainful snort, Severus turned away, letting his gaze flitter swiftly over the rest of the room's interior, ensuring that nothing had been changed since he had been here last, that no one had desecrated this refuge.
He continued quietly, making sure to keep eye contact with Harry, trying to portray his sincerity. "You are a war hero.
"A wonderful anecdote, Adler." Draco drawled, secretly storing away how important it seemed for Adler to have surpassed his father. For further reference, one never knew when it might come in handy. "But my situation is rather different from yours: I still have a family and I still care for them enough to have consideration for their wishes and expectations… And their reputation. So while I understand your protectiveness of Ives, I'd appreciate it if he recognized some boundaries. I don't want him to poison Harry's mind further against my family. God knows there is enough animosity already."
“Who is it?” Blaise asked, his arm coming to rest around Draco’s waist in a search for closeness. With the other hand, he brought his glass to his lips, sipping the exquisite wine.
But she allowed him to stroke over her slightly swollen lips with his thumb and bit it teasingly, never looking away from his sparkling gaze. "I love you, Cissy."
From the way he tensed it was obvious that the brunet was not unaffected by the intimidating Italian looming over him like a dark Grim, but he braved him nonetheless, even pressing himself up from the ground with some effort, a challenge flashing in his eyes.
Severus took in the change with a sharp frown and as soon as the last traces of the stasis spell were gone, his wand began its complex dance. A few fast swishes and the mattress started to bend, bringing the boy into an almost sitting position while tilting his head back. The thin blue cloak he wore tore along its every seam to bare the boy's pale, blood covered torso and the ugly, gaping injury in his stomach.
"Of course I wasn't. I told Draco I wouldn't be there. If I had been, I'm sure the evening would have ended with some corpses, and not mine!" He hated such gatherings where everyone present would sneer at him as if he were some stray that Lucius had graciously decided to take home and shelter. The last time he had nearly hexed Druella Rosier, Narcissa's mother, into oblivion.
