Instructions were once again given out, and Harry got his potion done in exactly the way Severus had shown him over the summer, which meant he was done about three times faster than the student around him, who were doing it by the book and not taking the shortcuts that were easy enough to figure out if you knew your ingredients.
“You move forward. You can keep presenting each other with revisements or you move forward with the courting once it’s been accepted. And typically the courting is either until a certain age or for a certain amount of time. Your father’s courting with me was a year and a half so we both had some months after reaching the age of majority to transition into adulthood without the marriage getting into the way.”
"I don't know! He's been so helpful and nice to me I just don't know what to think of him anymore! What am I supposed to think?" Severus took him by surprise.
“Well, you better believe it young man. I’ve been awaiting your owl for several weeks now, we’d best be off. You’ve got some shopping to do and if my memory serves correctly, you won’t be getting it done with these two lay-abouts. Come along now.” The woman named Professor McGonagall reached out and took his hand, leading him towards the door. Since the only complaint he heard from his aunt and uncle were sputters of indignation at being called lay-abouts, he went with her. Surely wherever she was taking him was a happier place than with the Dursley family.
By the time the two were yawning, Draco had convinced Harry to stay in the Room with him to sleep for the night. Harry reluctantly agreed but somehow managed to stutter out a warning that he tends to have nightmares so he might want to stick to his own side of the bed to prevent himself from getting hurt.
"Um...I resigned. And I turned in your maternity leave information." Draco watched him shrug and smirked.
“If I say you wear it, what do you do?” His voice had dropped an octave, and Harry felt the hairs on the back of his neck raise.
“Harry Potter has never kissed anyone?” Harry shook his head again, trying not to giggle from the way Draco’s mouth hung open. “Never?”
“You’re right. But would it help you if I told you I think you’ve got a bit of an infatuation with Harry?” Draco sputtered as she smirked at him over her teacup.
“Yeah, most students have one here that their parents set up around the beginning of third year. The parents open an account with their kid’s name and give the shop money up front. The kids can then use that account to pay for their goodies until it runs out, which is when they’d have to pay themselves or stop coming in for sweets. I thought you had one.”
“I used these,” he handed Draco a pair of nipple clamps which Draco quickly decided needed to be adoring Harry’s chest. “And then I used this,” Harry was breathless now as he handed Draco a vial of minty lube. Draco didn’t use this on Harry very often, it was something that he reserved for easier nights when Harry had been especially good. “And when I finally felt like I was stretched enough I used these.” Harry gestured to the two dildos on the floor. They were both smaller than Draco, but combined they would have been a little bit larger than him and the one doubled as a vibrator.
And when the day arrived when the students would finally be leaving for the holiday, Harry glanced at the list of students staying in the castle. It was only him and Draco as well as a small handful of first years in Ravenclaw. Not even Colin would be able to follow him around like a lost puppy.
Slowly, he stood up and put his money on the table to pay for his coffee and walked out. He took his time getting back to Draco's room, wanting to put off the inevitable conversation that he knew was coming.
“Mother, I want to talk about marriage contracts and how they work. I know you’ve been itching to teach me and I didn’t want anything to do with it but I think I’d like to learn now.”
“Now that that’s all settled. Harry, do you remember what happened the last time you were awake?” He nodded, tears burning their way down his face. He could only hope Draco didn’t see them. “I’m going to recommend you talk to someone about it. Draco here has been worrying over you all week, as has his mother. I’m sure either one of them would be more than willing to help you through that. As for the rest of you, you have broken or fractured nearly every single rib, your right femur was broken, your right arm was shattered, and your right hip had popped out of place. Broken nose, cheekbone, fractured jaw, some fairly large bald spots on your head and you had obviously screamed your throat raw. But, through all of that, your inheritance seems to have healed all of that, except your throat.”
“Fine, fine. Just too full of studying to think much more.” The two laughed and Harry was grateful Draco was willing to let it go. They both groaned when Hermione showed up with more books, but obediently cracked some spines to get their essays done on time with good marks.
"It's an Italian dinner. Come here, I'll show you." Draco moved next to him and watched as he explained how to manipulate the dough to do what he wanted it to do. He then spent the next ten minutes tossing pizza dough. He was amazed to find that he actually had fun throwing food around a kitchen, even if he messed up once or twice.
The room was small, but not the size of a broom closet like the one she had forced him into after he had his name called from the Goblet of Fire. It was definitely a size that he preferred.
"I don't know Draco. But trust me, this isn't going to be easy. And if you do find a donor that ditches you, I won't. I'll be there if only to make sure you get some sleep, because I know how tired you'll get. I went through this entire system with both Hermione and Ginny. It wasn't easy on them."
“I see now this is important to you, although I cannot imagine why. I want to be here, to support you Mother. You’ve done so well with helping me through...well everything this last year. And especially my changing. I just want to assist you. And I tire of fighting with everyone. With my friends about what classes are rubbish, with others about things they cannot control...with Harry. Really, was I so childish that I decided to hate him because he didn’t want to be my friend straight away? It’s just so foolish. I don’t want to waste my time on any of that. And so here I stay.”
"Because I care and because I don't want either of you two hurt in any way possible." Draco nodded, and let his Slytherin side out for a moment.
Harry made sure to clean Draco up very well before tucking him away and awaited further instruction. He didn’t have to wait long before Draco was telling him to stand up and follow him. Rising, Harry followed Draco out to the gardens and the two bid farewell to the congregation claiming an early morning the next day.
"I'm...you...that's not true. I've always wanted a little baby, not for an heir or the namesake. But for the simple joy of being loved and being able to love back without being judged. I want someone who will smile at me, who won't care about my past, and who I can take care of. And vice versa if the situation calls for it." Draco noticed a slight flick of comprehension and understanding in those green eyes.
"What?" Harry was thoroughly exasperated with whoever had interrupted his relaxation. Before he could dwell on that too long, he heard several people shouting about a fight and spells being no use. Harry yanked the door open and stalked outside to follow the throngs of people. Soon enough he came across a group of five men arguing and fighting with each other. Someone foolishly cast a stunning spell and Harry watched, annoyed, as it rebounded.
He could deny Draco and have him try to find someone else and then see if he could manage that. But if he denied him, then he would never have a child to call his own. And if Draco couldn't find someone else soon enough then he would die, taking the child with him. Harry couldn't let that happen.
“I don’t care. I refuse to be told I’m going to have a child if I’m not the one making that choice.” She clearly saw the resolve he had in his eyes and smiled at him before motioning for him to continue. “I guess I don’t know enough to be able to say about the finances and estates and stuff. What do you suggest?” She seemed surprised that he had asked her opinion but she gave it nonetheless.
He moved in between Harry’s legs, spreading them wider while he moved his fingers within the tight canal that was soon to be stuffed full of him. He gently pulled the fingers away, leaving Harry’s hole open and ready. Upon the sight, Draco moaned and placed the head of his member in. Harry closed around it, clearly expecting more and disappointed at having to wait.
“No, don’t do that to me. You got me drunk, not the other way ‘round. Ron does that and I’ve decided I don’t like it.” Draco patted himself on the back for not laughing at the way Harry’s speech sped up and slowed down in odd places, but managed to focus on the issue at hand.
Draco woke up on time and looked around waiting for his trainer from hell and partner from his worst nightmares. When he didn't show up by six, Draco decided it was about time to start running. The last thing he needed was to take a day off. He knew that he'd hurt worse if he didn't keep up with Harry's mad training from the Devil's gym. That and he wanted to impress him when he showed up. He was tired of knowing that Harry, and most other people, thought of him as lazy just because he grew up a rich little boy. No one ever knew that he went out to the pitch late at night from second year on to practice for hours on end just to better himself. No one ever knew that he would go to bed early to study his head off so he could get better grades and do better. They just assumed it was from how he was raised and he was sick of having people see him like that. He was determined to impress Harry if it killed him.
When he finally managed to get into his giant tub filled to the brim with bubbles and warm water, he felt a clench in his stomach and quickly hurried out again. After making sure he was clear of the rim, he ran towards the toilet to let out everything his body decided it could expel.
“Of course it bloody well bothers me! I keep hoping that he’ll come around and that he’ll even out and maybe that’s true but I haven’t seen it happen yet! And that sucks! I know he’s capable of being a really good person and a wonderful friend but he’s so wrapped up in his own little world that he doesn’t care to be a better person. I keep thinking that maybe if he spends enough time around me that maybe he’ll start being better, that he’ll learn by being around it all the time but…”
He smiled and sipped, smiling at the approving look Draco gave him. The foot on his thigh crept closer and pressed into his crotch.
His stomach didn’t so much as rumble anymore. Crawling under his bed to lift up the one floorboard that had some candy in it was the only food he was sure he would get in a single day. Already, he had rationed himself out a little bit, enough to get him to his birthday at least. He just hoped Dumbledore would follow through this time; he would likely starve if he didn’t.
Harry squinted at her, unsure of her motives. She seemed genuinely sorry, so he nodded his head before wincing a little at the throbbing pain that came with that action. She beamed, while she poured him a small glass of water.
Only an hour later and they had a compromised contract drawn up and given back to the boys on the other side of the manor. Draco had agreed to it before dinner, much to Lucius’s displeasure.
Classes were to start on Monday, and they had arrived at the castle on Thursday. The two spent most of their time together, just talking and enjoying each other’s company. The rest of the school was giddy with excitement at having the two of them there, and they had plenty of people vying to get their questions answered when they showed up to meals.
"Fuck rule number twelve. You need someone to make you happy and that's exactly what he does." That was the last of their conversation he heard. He wasn’t sure he would be okay knowing who they were talking about.
What he saw was Draco Malfoy laying on the floor holding a book as if he fell asleep reading it. His blond hair fell in delicate tendrils on his face and his mouth was just barely open. It made a sweet picture of innocence and Harry wished beyond what he thought possible that he had someone to hold him. To tell him he was loved. To make everything okay even if he knew it wasn't.
A soft touch under his chin lifted his face a fraction before he flinched. The finger withdrew, regardless of how much Harry wanted it to stay when he realized the touch wasn’t meant to hurt him.
The common room was less of a common room and more of a large living room. Emerald green with gold accents made the space feel cozy; there was a huge fireplace off to the left, with oversized chairs and a smaller couch. Behind that was a kitchen and an island with bar stools on the other side. To their right was a study nook with a large table and chairs, complete with a tall bookshelf against the wall. Just beyond that was a doorway that presumably led to their rooms.
"Just keep doing what you've been doing." They were all bustling around and suddenly another Healer told him that if he wasn't going to tell his husband to push, then he might as well leave. He did as they said, completely bewildered.
“I was only asking Professor McGonagall if there was a program for students who can’t go home to stay over the summer like there is for the holiday season.”
The first thing Narcissa did was insist that Harry call her Narcissa. The second thing she did was insist that he learn about marriage contracts first.
Draco was hastening ahead of him, practically on the brink of running when he shouted something suspiciously close to “Alcohol!”
“No, just be ready to leave in an hour. I’m sure Mother would be happy to escort you. I’ll be leaving now with Father to attend to some things before then.” He winked and made his way out of the room leaving Harry blushing and on the verge of shock and his mother smiling.
“Whenever you’re ready, my angel.” They held each other, neither one of them wanting to let go. It would hurt them both for them to be apart, but Harry knew that they would push out the other side of it stronger than every.
“Good morning Harry. Happy Christmas.” Draco’s voice was rough with sleep and Harry inhaled to respond. He smelled like vanilla and cinnamon, and maybe star anise? Cardamom? There was definitely a hint of orange as well.
“Draco I can’t stand it anymore. You teasing me was fun the first day but I want more. Can we please, please take things just a step further?” Draco beamed, he was delighted that Harry wanted to move things along to the courting stage. He had been spending a lot of time with Hermione, trying to get a good idea of what to shower Harry with when he was ready to progress their relationship further.
"Potter...Sorry. I'm just trying to get to my...POTTER! Move, I have a very important meeting to be attending." Harry sighed. Not only was he mad because of idiotic newbies, but he was also ticked he was getting yelled at for something he attempted to prevent. And it wasn't like Malfoy had been offended at first, only after he realized he had run into him specifically. Apparently he was destined to be hated my Malfoy forever no matter how many times they would save each other’s livesl.
‘I truly don’t want to be a bother. I can stay here by myself, it’s not like much will have changed. Do your parents even know you offered to let me come stay?
And, he'd admit it, he wanted to know what it felt like to hold his waist in such an intimate manor. He wanted to know if it would be calming to both of them or if it was just to comfort the poor boy. Or maybe he did it just to satisfy his own curiosity. He often found himself wondering just how thin the other had gotten over the years. He was surprised when his hand rested on a hip that wasn't as bone-y as he had expected.
“Way to lighten the mood,” Draco muttered. His mother, never one to mishear a slight like that, smacked him upside the head. “Ow!”
“Oh good, I was beginning to think you’d stood me up. Grab a basket, will you? They were all gone when I came in.” Harry chuckled and asked the shopkeeper if she had a spare basket he could borrow. After she handed him one, he dumped the sweets in the basket just before another load of things were tossed in.
The door opened and he looked up to see the professor dressed just as sharply at curfew as she was at breakfast.
Draco hadn’t hesitated when his chest was bare and sunk to his knees after pushing Harry to sit on the bed. The shoes came off with the same attention and care as everything else, shocking Harry with how sinfully good it felt to have someone do those things to his feet of all things. His trousers followed and Harry had to lay down with his legs hanging over the side of the bed or he’d surely pass out from the overwhelming sensations.
A muttered thanks came from the blond and he let the corner of his mouth twitch upwards as he continued to read.
"I'm...you...that's not true. I've always wanted a little baby, not for an heir or the namesake. But for the simple joy of being loved and being able to love back without being judged. I want someone who will smile at me, who won't care about my past, and who I can take care of. And vice versa if the situation calls for it."
"Harry..." The blond walked to the bed where Harry was sitting and pulled him up and out to the living room. He sat him down on one side of the rather large window seat, he on the other, and took Harry's hand. "Look, I can tell you're probably worried about me saying no. And just to let you know...I would be too. But if I wasn't going to say yes, I would have given the necklace back to you. It's a family treasure to you, I couldn't take that away from you without giving you something in return." Not believing what his ears were telling his brain, Harry looked at the blond disbelievingly.
Draco nodded. He didn't like it, he actually hated it, but pride wouldn't let him say anything against it-he wanted to build up a reputation as well as impressing Harry. Besides, maybe he could get some leverage on him.
"I noticed you didn't eat much either. Would you like some?" Harry was please when Draco nodded and finished making it in record time. They ate in silence and then walked to the bedrooms.
Harry woke up the next day feeling more refreshed than ever and carefully got out of bed without waking Draco. He dressed in clothes the room provided, used the loo and made his way down to breakfast.
Harry did say that he'd be there no matter what. And obviously with the Weasley family and their productiveness with kids he was used to it, or at least exposed to it frequently. He supposed that being the godfather of several kids had to be better than nothing.
And, after all, Draco was a Malfoy. They always made sure they were right in the end. And he was certain he'd never have to kill Harry Potter.
He had gotten really good at telling time by the location of the sun. For instance, it was about ten in the morning, and Harry’s cousin would be waking up in two hours. He just had to hope that maybe Petunia had made herself lunch early today…
“Don’t you dare fight me on this. You’ve caused enough trouble for this family, and since beating the magic out of you didn’t work I’m going to have to fuck it out of you instead. This is what you get for having those fools as parents.” Harry whimpered involuntarily. Surely Vernon knew he couldn’t help who his parents were…
“Not to worry, I’ll put them back when we’re gone. Now grab your things and don’t stand in front of the window.” Harry moved away and the man suddenly appeared in his room with the same crack he’d heard before.
‘When one is powerful enough to go through the change faster than a year, the loneliness will be overpowering. All of it will hit all at once, usually rendering the creature useless at everything including; self preservation, self defense, eating, and even walking is impaired. It is imperative that the creature have someone they trust completely to help them. Physical comfort from this person will help alleviate some of the pain and will assist in getting them to take care of themselves on their own.
“Oh I don’t think so. You’re going to tell me exactly why you’re cutting your ties with me when I’ve stuck my neck out for you and stood by you when you’ve been nothing but a jerk back. You’re going to explain to me why you treat me like shite because you’re not allowed to treat me like that anymore! This whole thing is your fault, let’s not forget that! You’re ungrateful and you can’t see what’s right in front of you. Just how is it that you’ve decided that I’m in the wrong when it’s you that has to be a spoiled brat!”
“You’ve never kissed someone that’s shorter than you?” Harry suddenly felt a flash of insecurity but quickly gathered up his Gryffindor courage (with a bit of help from a large swig of eggnog) and shook his head.
“Well, no one had ever survived the curse he used. Or just...they never survived him until you came along no matter how they died. If he wanted you dead, dead you would be. But you managed to survive. You’re a living oddity-no offence.”
Harry slowly let his wings out, still unsure of the reactions he’d get. Upon receiving not so much as a glance, he relaxed and smiled at Draco. When the waiter brought them their menus, Harry’s heart sank a little.
Harry was surprised to note when he woke up that he had woken due to hunger and not his aunt screaming or dormmates shouting at each other to get out of bed. He smiled, kept his eyes closed and stretched languidly. The mattress must be stuffed with clouds, there’s no other possible explanation for how soft and soothing it was.
"Oh really?" Draco noticed the slight edge to her voice. "And exactly how did he behave?" She turned slowly, giving her brother a look that could only be described as the stink eye.
Draco and his mother talked about school. She and Lucius had convinced the headmaster that Draco would need his own rooms due to his condition. Their original request was denied until Lucius threw it back in the headmaster’s face that the Malfoy family had managed to kill Voldemort once and for all and had saved the wizarding world a lot of heartache had they waited for him to go about things his way. Dumbledore was much more accommodating after that reminder.
“The rest of my appearance? What’s happened to the rest of me? I must look like a freak, I-” Draco cut him off by placing a finger on his lips.
Harry groaned when he woke up to find the sun peeking over the horizon. Another day that he was left to the devices of the Dursley household. Things had been particularly bad this summer. Dudley had obtained a key to Harry’s prison and had made a regular habit of waltzing in when Harry had just started eating the one meal he was allowed a day and snatching it from his grasp. Sometimes he would just leave after that, throwing his soup on the floor so Harry had to lick it off the wood and sometimes he’d beat harry beyond passing out and take the food with him. It really depended on Dudley’s mood that day.
He set a plate down in front of him with slightly more than he'd seen the boy eat so far and waited patiently until Harry opened his eyes. When he did, Draco looked pointedly at the food in front of him and got to work on what was left.
"You sure you want to do this?" Draco took his hand in both of his and kissed it before giving his answer.
He knocked on her office door and eyed his trainers while his teeth worried his bottom lip. Doubt filled him. Adults had never listened to him before, so why should they start now?
When his hands caressed the wings, Harry gasped. He clearly didn’t realize how sensitive his new appendages would be. Draco helped him get situated so he wasn’t sitting on his wings, and sat back down. When he wouldn’t look up, Harry demanded to know what the issue was.
The brunet cursed again and finally decided to bloody well get up. It was just after midnight, and since the next day was the start of the weekend, he decided to just get up and go for a walk. The teachers stopped patrolling around midnight anyways so they could grade in their rooms and have a bit of a lie in. He swung the invisibility cloak around himself and departed without a sound.
"No, you won't. You're going to go to your cubicle with your files. You're going to do this paperwork by yourself. You're going to do that, and then if you want to live, you're never going to come near me again. I don't work for lesser people. And I don't take orders from worthless pieces of scum like you. Dismissed."
Soon, he was neigh on hysterics. He simply couldn't believe that he had kissed Draco. He hated feeling so helpless, so uncontrolling of how he felt.
"When Vernon came back, she told him how wonderful it was to play with me. He thought she meant like you would play chess or a card game with someone and came up to the spare bedroom where she kept me and found me tied to the bed.
He hardly paid any attention to the food he was cooking. He was too preoccupied with the thoughts of Harry he had running through his mind.
I won’t touch myself either, if that makes you feel better. Harry didn’t need telling twice, throwing all his need at the veela. He whimpered and begged through their bond and sent images of himself splayed before him, quivering with desire. The submissive in him had him panting with desire to be taken. To be thoroughly fucked, marked forever as Draco’s.
“Oh my, yes! You wouldn’t believe it if you saw it. He came home the first holiday in first year and went on and on about how the great Harry Potter didn’t think he was good enough to be his friend. He spent the rest of the year trying to impress you from afar, but it seemed like everything he tried pushed you farther and farther away.
Harry’s eyes widened in shock at the feeling. More specifically, widened at being able to feel the feathers with his hand and also the shock of feeling he got from the feathers themselves. I have wings...I have wings and I can feel them...Just that amount of knowledge made him want to succumb to the darkness once more. Draco, upon seeing the panic, rushed to explain a little farther.
And, of course, the observation he made was that it sounded like it looked like he liked the other romantically.
"I spent the summer with Severus Snape, my potions professor, because he has seen and done some of the things that I have seen and done. He knows what I suffer and he offered to help, to be somewhat of a comfort to me. He has been. And he's tutored me in all of my classes, catching me up to where I wanted to be in the first place by now. I still study with him privately, and talk to him on occasion outside of class.
"You're not breathing right. Slow, deep breaths. Short and fast won't give your muscles the oxygen they need. Just breathe." After a few moments, they started up again. This time, he kept up with him easier. Who knew that he'd be able to help me by correcting my breathing, of all things?
He got a cup of Brazilian coffee knowing that he needed something stronger than tea. He knew what his answer would be, and he wasn't sure it was the right decision, but he thought it was the better option.
Turns out, Harry didn’t need to worry about canceling on Hermione. He sat in the common room for two hours before Ron finally came through the portrait with Lavender Brown in tow. The two were practically glued to one another and Harry sighed. He’d wasted hours of research for his essay due on Monday and Ron was getting it on with some twit.
"I...Well I...I just figured that maybe since you were having a baby you'd be upset. I mean, it's going to be hard for you to find a husband isn't it?" As Draco could tell he was extremely nervous, he took pity on him and interrupted his fast-approaching monologue.
“Harry, I was just wondering,” Harry smirked. He knew there was only two things Draco ‘just wondered’ about anymore and both of them had to do with Harry. “Our bond has gotten much stronger, wouldn’t you agree?” Before Harry could answer and before Draco lost his nerve, he continued. “I just thought that since the holidays start in a week, and since you’re spending the holidays at Malfoy Manor, I figured now would be the best time for use to continue on to the next part of our relationship.” He looked down, hating the way they had to separate. They both understood why it was necessary, but neither one of them liked it.
“Wait!” She paused, shocked he was telling her not to put her reading away at the table. “When I was in Dumbledore’s office just now, he told me he sent you a book,” She nodded. “I was wondering, what is it? He seemed rather interested in getting you to talk to me about it for some reason.” She smiled, knowingly.
They spent the rest of the night discussing when they thought they could move onto the next stage and practicing strengthening their bond over dinner. By the end of it, they both were watching each other with passion etched in their eyes and pheromones flying. It had been so strong that the couple sitting a few seats away from them were now sharing a heated kiss.
"Don't bite your lip. I want to hear you moan in pleasure not groan in pain because you bit through your lip. They're too pretty for that." The other man immediately stopped and looked up at Harry, pleading with his eyes.
But, he wasn't. He was currently on his side, tense, yet half asleep. It was only when he felt another body slide into the bed next to him that he woke up fully. His eyes widened after they shot open, and his voice failed him as the words he wanted to say tried forcing their way out.
He stood and stretched his back. I managed thirty perfect push-ups and then my arms suddenly collapsed.
"AND ANOTHER THING YOU SON OF A BITCH! IF I EVER CATCH YOU EVEN THINKING ABOUT SEX EVER AGAIN, I WILL KILL YOU ON THE SPOT, AZKABAN OR NOT! I CANNOT BELIEVE I EVER THOUGHT I LOVED YOU, ALL YOU DO IS CAUSE ME EXTREME PAIN AND I SIMPLY WILL NOT TOLERATE IT ANYMORE! YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT EVER HAVING FUN WITH YOURSELF BECAUSE ONCE I'M DONE IN THIS BED, I AM GOING TO CASTRATE YOU SO THIS DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN AGAIN!" And so the ranting went on, sounding suspiciously like Sirius was starting to influence Draco’s vocabulary.
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed the ice mice before they all fell from their teetering tower and Draco turned with fire in his eyes before realizing who had stolen his haul.
"You are going to eat. I don't care if you don't tell me anything or everything or only bits and pieces of how you got to be like this," he indicated to Harry's ribs, which were painfully obvious at this point. "but I'm determined to help you get past it and healthy once more."
He ran the three miles within an hour and promptly started doing push-ups. He'd never admit it to his partner, but he actually enjoyed the exercise much more when he did it right.
And he loved staying with Draco. They had tried letting him go back to his room but Harry had found the empty bed unnerving and came to his room in the middle of the night simply because he missed having another body with him. They hadn't tried it again since, and he was quite pleased with the arrangement.
“You are both difficult to love. Your hearts and souls are guarded, but with each other they are open and willing. Heed my warning: together you will be the happiest you could possibly imagine but separated you will only suffer.” She paused and held out her hand while turning to Draco. “Scroll.” He handed it over and she opened it before placing her palm in the middle of it. A white flash covered the parchment and she handed it back, her eyes less dim but no less enchanting to look at.
"So, you sure you don't know why you care so much? You've been saying it for a long time now." Harry looked at his godfather, extremely confused. "You're attracted to him aren't you?"
“Um...Draco? What is that?” Draco looked up and licked a bit of whatever it was off of his mouth. He rather looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Oh don’t worry dear. This is all about children and how to treat them, which ones will be heir to which fortunes, how many and when. Since you don’t want to be controlled over that, I’m taking the liberty of crossing it all out.”
His weight was no longer being supported by his legs and he realized that Severus had put him in his lap as he used to do. His head lay on the man's chest, listening to the calming beat of his heart that many thought nonexistent. He felt like he was cared for, and he knew that he didn't have to hurry to compose himself. Severus learned quickly that he did much better when given time to let it all out at once than a little at a time. So that's what he did.
He finished reading, a smile having crept up his lips. He really did like spending time together but Draco was right. They did have forever, after all.
"You dolt, you are a WIZARD. Undetectable shrinking charms work just as well!" Draco eyed the picture.
“Alright. What’s a dark angel then?” Draco raised his head, but didn’t dare ask about his sudden change of tune.
“He spent most of the summer with me, you know that. This relaxes him.” She sighed in resignation and sat down.
“You gave us all quite a scare, Harry.” He jerked with confusion. He knew that voice, but there’s no way Draco Malfoy, of all people, was talking to him so normally. “Shh, relax.” A hand rested on his chest, trying to keep him from moving too suddenly. “You were unconscious for a week. And since you had, indeed, gotten an inheritance, we couldn’t give you any potions. We had to just watch and wait for you to come back to us. But it’s all right, there should be a healer coming in any moment now.”
"Damn it Kingsley, what is it this time?" Harry's gut filled with dread. Not one fire-call from Kingsley ever ended well for the auror. It usually ended in a few nights of no sleep and lots of overtime.
He found a compartment with one first year on it, and he jerked his thumb behind him. She scrambled to get up and he nodded after levitating her trunk down and into the hallway. Someone else could play the good student card. But not him. He was done helping others unless it helped him in the long run.
“Your mother made me read so much fine print; are my eyes bleeding?” They laughed and Harry changed the subject to wizard’s chess.
They danced and kissed and openly touched and flirted. They let love shine through their eyes, and as soon as the last dance ended, they were out the door faster than the words 'have fun' could have been uttered.
“But I don’t think that will happen. I’ve got to try, though, or what kind of person does that make me? The kind that gives up on everyone? I don’t want to give up on people, that’s a horrid thing to do.” Draco reached out and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“Not to worry, I’m just headed for the library for a book on defence. I should be back to the common room in the next quarter hour or so.”
That night, Ron plopped into bed and was out like a light immediately. A good sign for Harry. The rest of their dormmates came and fell asleep quickly after, leaving Harry free to roam the castle with his invisibility cloak and his map to avoid teachers. Letting his feet wander for him, he came across a large bay window he hadn’t really noticed before and sat down on the ledge to watch the first snow start. It would be time for everyone to go home during the holidays in just two short weeks, and that was reason enough for him to smile sadly. He would miss his friends, but he couldn’t help but feel a bit relieved that he wouldn’t have to tip-toe around Ron for a bit of blissful peace.
"No problem. I found that since Snape doesn't breathe down my neck anymore, I'm actually pretty good at potions. You hungry?" Draco nodded and followed Harry down to the kitchen.
“Would you let me try to take care of you the way I never got to?” Harry nodded, this throat having closed up with emotion at the genuine sorrow Narcissa had showed about his mother’s passing. Her soft voice broke him from his reverie. “Would you let Draco try to make amends for his wrongdoings in the past?” Harry took a deep breath and nodded after a moment. It was the least he could do for the Slytherin to stay here and try to keep him from going mental with unanswered questions.
"I'd love to." Harry helped him stand and before he knew it, they were walking towards his destination.
“Well...you’re part vampire too. So, you have fangs. I’m surprised you didn’t realize before now. You can still eat regular food-you won’t need blood until you find your mate which, again, a conversation for another time.” He hurried through the last part to try to stop Harry from having an all out fit.
"So...You're sister? I don't mean to impose...I just never knew you had a sibling...Just forget I ever said anything..."
"Draco, I have a proposition for you. Harry only feels comfortable sleeping with one person he trusts and it cannot be me any longer. I know you don't want to be with the others in your dorm, and so I'll let you two move into your private rooms if you'll agree to it." Harry closed his eyes, just wanting to feel the rumble of his slow voice and not wanting to see Draco's reaction.
They hadn't worn makeup around each other as they felt no need. They felt comfortable around each other, like they didn't need to hide or scare each other away. So Monday morning, they were both in the bathroom sharing the mirror and applying their daily makeup once again. Once done, they decided to brave the world outside their safe haven and grabbed their bags before walking into the cold corridors.
“Well, it’s not very hard. It just takes a lot of practice. You just have to find that pulling sensation and send whatever you want me to receive towards it. I know that’s not a very good explanation, but it’s the best one I’ve got.”
By ten at night, Draco had all of the spell incantations and movements memorized. And to his delight, he could perform most of them successfully.
“Harry, if you can hear me...I know you probably can’t. But I needed to practice and I thought if maybe you weren’t fighting me on what I have to say then this would be easier to do when you wake up. I-I know I haven’t been very good to you. Anyone, really. I’ve been a right prat over the years and I’ve changed a lot over the summer. I just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you. I know you won’t want to talk to me...hell, you’d probably punch me if I gave you the chance. I just hope that one day we can put our past behind us. Maybe even be friends.” Harry squeezed his hand as hard as he could, and succeeded in moving his index and middle finger the slightest bit. “Thanks Harry. I know you won’t remember this. I just...I just wanted a little bit of practice so I would have some sort of courage to give you my apology letter.”
'They're always together...They're sharing rooms...All of their classes are the same...They are simply inseparable...' Plenty of other explicit comments were made also when this subject came up about the two men.
A long, loud, three minutes later, Harry heard yet another cry. His brain going a million miles an hour, he just held his husband as the assistant Healers cleaned him up and laid him out normally.
"Um...Are you all right?" The voice that came from his throat was small and insecure, as if he expected to be hit for asking such a question. Or any question at all, for that matter.
When they got to Hogwarts, Ron told him about the different houses and although Ron made a point to downplay Slytherin as much as he could, Harry couldn’t help but think that they wouldn’t be that bad if Voldemort hadn’t been in Slytherin.
“Mother sent me an owl. Specifically, she asked about you since I mentioned we’d been getting along quite swimmingly.”
He wondered at the question. Why did he care? He supposed that Malfoy could have a sense of humor, if a bit crude. And he was stubborn and determined, but that helped him get anything he wanted. He was crafty, and knew how to get what he wanted. And when the situation called for it, he was pretty brave. Harry looked up at the ceiling of the tent and got up.
“Just held you until you calmed down is all. We fell asleep like this.” Harry yawned and stretched before moving to sit up. Draco followed suit and Harry leaned on his side as Draco levitated their gifts straight to the bed. Their gifts were a bit jumbled when they landed, but Draco rolled his eyes and handed Harry one. “We’ll sort through them as we go, yeah?” Harry nodded.
"No, I won't. You get ten months of pay for sitting on your behind and shopping. And if you go back you only have to do a desk job and you pick your hours as long as you hit thirty hours for every week. It's easier this way. So you get ten months off with pay and then work one month behind a desk and take a two year leave-of-absence with pay. Then you can quit."
"I'm doing the interview. And I'm overseeing the entire thing from start to finish. If so much as a comma is put where I don't like it, then I'm making them fix it. I don't care if you do or not, but it would make it easier on me if you at least went with me. I don't think I can face her on my own." He quickly nodded, eager to see Rita put in her place, and curious as to what Harry would say at the interview.
"Draco?" The soft voice practically begged for Draco to lift his head up, and he did. Harry was closer than he originally thought, and he was caught in pools of green, flecked with gold. "Draco, why are you upset?" He felt a tear fall.
“Harry!” Draco was running to him from across the room. He hadn’t expected Harry to get there so soon. Harry ran to him, stumbling slightly on the way and was enveloped in Draco’s arms before he hit the floor.
And he loved knowing that he could go see Severus whenever he wanted. Somehow the old man had made his room impervious to intruders whenever Harry's magical signature was within Severus's private rooms.
"Good. I'm making coffee to go with it so just have a seat. It'll be done in a few minutes." Draco sat down, hardly able to wait for the delicious-smelling dish to be in front of him.
“Oh don’t worry about it dear. Your father and I talked about it and we decided you don’t need to follow through with the ridiculous Malfoy traditions. It’s really too much pressure to be putting on someone so young. Honestly, I can’t believe I wanted to teach you about it when you were younger.”
If he asked Harry, then he'd be causing him confusion and doubt. But if he did say yes, it would probably only be because of Harry's infamous 'Hero Complex' and Draco didn't want anyone to feel obligated to do this for him. That was the last thing he needed. Pity and Draco Malfoy just didn't mix.
He saw the blush that crept forward and the shiver that ran down his spine. Harry glanced up towards Draco. Was that really why I woke up with sticky pants today? He folded the letter, tucked it away in his pocket and ate his lunch with excitement brewing in his stomach. If this is what Draco teasing him in public was like, he couldn’t wait to get back up to their rooms.
Damion led the two men towards the back rooms that Draco had rented for the year. He was suddenly very happy that he had felt the need to spend the money to book the back for an entire twelve months over the summer. He could practically feel Harry's curiosity pouring off of him in waves. They passed by several doors, all of them leading into different rooms specifically designed for specific tasks. Shane motioned for the others to walk in while he held the door open for them.
He was looking forward to it just for the idea that people would stop swooning over him anytime he went out in public.
‘If I remember correctly, you weren’t too fond of herbology; what makes you an expert on jasmine plants? I have more important news though. The Dursley’s left for a holiday today. I’ve no idea when they’ll be back; they said in a few weeks but the last few years Petunia has said a few weeks it was just the rest of the summer. Last year, four weeks turned into two months. Can you send more bread? Crackers couldn’t go amiss either. They’ve effectively locked down the entire house except the loo.
“No, I was simply curious. Thank you Headmaster.” He left, wondering how he was possibly going to survive at the Dursley’s knowing that they didn’t treat him very well compared to people other than Dudley. Somehow, it was worse knowing that no one else he could think of was treated the way he was.
Piles of presents were stacked around the tree in the living room. Even Severus had a pile of goodies. Wrappings soon littered the floor as gifts were uncovered and cherished by the Malfoys, Harry and Severus alike.
He stopped when he heard a thud and bolted upright. Who could possibly have gotten into the Manor? He walked over to the French glass doors and saw the brunet passed out on the floor.
“Doesn’t seem like there’s much to squish if I’m being honest.” Mr. Malfoy had levitated the trunk to the foyer and left the two boys with a reminder that breakfast would not be served but they could request tea at any time prior to brunch.
“You know my best subject is defence, I thought this would challenge me a bit.” Harry went back to the book, only getting a sentence in before Ron snorted and started talking to him about how he wished he were good at anything and how easy it must be to not have to worry about homework for one of his classes. Harry tried tuning him out but from the way the comments swirled around in his head, it must not have worked out so well.
"Because you'll be tired and if you need to move fast you'll forget it. Harry learned the hard way and I refuse to let you make the same mistake. Now MOVE boy! GET GOING! We haven't got all day!" Draco gave the picture-turned-necklace-pendant a frightened look and hurriedly did as he said. Harry laughed at his godfather. If there was one thing that made him the way he is now, it was that man.
“I’m ready. I don’t want to be, but I have to be if we’re ever going to get past this.” Draco packed while Harry stopped him every so often to plant gentle kisses on his face. When he had a few outfits stashed away in an overnight bag, he turned around and held the man against his chest.
The next day Harry spent five hours calling Luna and making arrangements, trying to keep Draco from noticing his uncertainty, and picking an outfit to wear. Finally deciding on a dress shirt the color of pine needles and dress slacks, he forewent the tie and came out of his bathroom looking extremely cleaned-up. He had spent almost an hour trying to get his hair to cooperate with him. Now it only looked windswept instead of a war zone.
“Draco? You had mentioned something about a bond between us getting stronger when you have to leave me...what bond?” The veela tilted his head, thinking.
"Um..." He looked pointedly at the Healers and they left quickly. He waited until they were out of earshot and closed the door.
"Mr. Potter, can I help you?" His lazy drawl was slightly strained, as if in anticipation. Which, Harry knew it was, but no one else knew that.
“I’ve never wanted to kiss anyone so I suppose I wouldn’t know.” A thought dawned on him just then and he narrowed his eyes at Draco with a smirk on his face. “Everyone?” Draco nodded. “So that means the great Draco Malfoy has thought about kissing me at some point?”
He was so confused; he was not used to being out of the loop with anything. Especially with how people feel and work. Harry was just different and he liked challenges. They interested him.
Draco had always been a curious boy, ever since he could remember. He always found something just so appealing about not knowing and then finding out about it through his own observations. Like memorizing where different places were or how to make something work. So the case with Harry Potter wasn't any different-or so he had thought.
"Interesting. I used to watch you watch me so that doesn't really surprise me. What surprises me is that you're the only one who could deduce that." Draco felt proud of himself that he could figure out the one thing that no one else could. He shrugged. After all, he had done the same thing. Doing things with mental detatchment came easy to him, after all he was a Malfoy.
“Yeah,” he admitted. Madame Pomfrey sent Draco on his way and instead of just giving him a potion so he could sleep for the night, she had him sit down in her office. The plush armchair was soft and comfortable, much more so than the old, worn-out armchairs in the common room.
Draco walked to the park, arm-in-arm with Harry. Most of the Wizarding World knew that Harry had decide to court someone, but no one knew who. As they walked in companionable silence, Draco reminisced on that day.
“Darling, would you be okay if I talked to you? The way we used to?” She was referencing the way they would communicate when Voldemort was near their family. Veela were natural mind readers, their abilities only strengthened by their mother-son bond.
That night, Harry had dreamt that Draco was there with him. He was laying on the bed, silk ties holding him down against the sheets. Draco was just off to the side of the bed, lightly striking him with a cane and telling him how naughty he had been for teasing him during dinner through their bond. The blond raked his nails over Harry’s chest, digging in quite painfully but the words turned it into pleasure.
Kingsley, taking the nod as his cue to start, paused when Harry's hand came up as if to say 'not yet.' He waited and when Harry put his hand down he asked if he was all right. Harry nodded, short and jerky movements of his head. Knowing that his memories were usually worthless, he took extra care to go through every single detail in his mind before he let Kingsley start. It wouldn’t do to have his memories fail them this time.
He tried to keep his eyes open and trained on Malfoy, but he was at an odd angle and his eyes couldn’t strain that far for long. Draco, sensing this, moved to his mother’s chair. “Look, I know you must be confused.” Harry nodded, stronger this time. The throbbing was settling into a dull ache. “I promise you, I will answer every single question you have once the healer takes a look at you.” The door opened again, and in whirled a young woman with blonde hair and mint green healer robes.
But what would he do about it? He couldn't really tell him, he'd get his head bitten off by one angry Slytherin. Harry wasn't so sure that he wanted that.
He did wonder why Draco never brought this up before; after all, they were sort of dating...weren’t they? Draco had only kissed his head once, but they held hands and spent time together when they didn’t need to.
“Albus, I wish I could tell you the extent this boy has been traumatized tonight. Not just with his changing. I can smell it on him, the kind of pain he was forced to suffer through. Why would you not come to us sooner, if the boy was being punished this way? You knew, and yet you ignored it. That is truly unforgivable.” Her voice was lowered, a sadness that was overpowered by a dark threatening undertone towards the end.
Lock after lock was being undone, winding Harry up with so much suspense that he almost passed out. When the door finally burst open, it slammed against the wall with the force that had been behind it. Vernon was purple with rage already, hands fisted at his sides and steam practically pouring out of his ears. He turned to slam the door shut and locked it from the inside. Harry’s eyes opened wide with fear. Vernon had never locked the door from the inside before, he had never even closed the door. Dudley usually watched, blocking the one exit that would be temporarily available to him.
“When you’re dealing with family wealth the size of the Potter and Malfoy accounts then it’s typically recommended that each is kept separate and managed by accountants. You’ll be expected to review the financial reports but most only check quarterly and yearly. Lucius checks his every quarter but Draco’s been telling him for years it would make more sense to review them monthly. Less work if you do them monthly. I think he just was upset that accounting days took up all of his attention and didn’t leave any time for him to play with Draco.”
"You aren't." Harry felt his jaw hit the floor. Here he was getting advice from his professor and best friend and father-like figure and he was being told not to think? This was coming from a man that, for years, had asked him to kindly use his brain or cease existing. Coming from a man that did nothing but think. Harry simply couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that Sev would ever give that kind of advice to anyone...about anything. He just couldn't fathom it. "You're supposed to feel Harry. You're supposed to...Oh for Merlin's sake."
In the next few hours, Draco cussed, yelled and screamed himself hoarse. It wasn't until the third hour in that Draco managed to break Harry's hand. He quickly took that one back and replaced it with the other hand while an assistant Healer sent a charm his way to fix it for him. He gave him a distracted nod and went back to listening to his husband.
Did Harry care for him? Obviously he cared as he stayed by his side while he was in the hospital. And that's another thing. He knew friends and even business partners sometimes visited people in the hospital...but they never usually stayed the entire time like Harry did. It shocked him and made him wonder if Harry didn't just consider him a coworker. If Harry liked him, fancied him.
“Yeah Hagrid. Thanks for holding up the train, Ron took forever eating and didn’t pack until after breakfast.”
In this case, it is recommended that physical contact length should be determined by the creature themselves. Only they are truly aware of how much pain they are in and if they can get through ten minutes or ten hours without the contact.
“In second year, he was so disappointed that you hadn’t changed your mind over the summer that he wrote home the very first night to express how disappointed he was. In third year, he wasn’t even upset that Miss Granger had punched him in the nose. He was upset he couldn’t seem to ever get it right. That’s when he stopped pursuing your friendship, albeit in an odd way, and started observing you from afar. He’s always ribbed your friends, because he was jealous of them. He wanted that closeness to you, although he couldn’t figure out why.” She saw the question sparkling in Harry’s eyes then. “No, I won’t tell you why. I figured it out fairly quickly, but I won’t be divulging that information until he wants to tell you himself.” She rocked herself in the chair that had been next to Draco’s spot and continued.
“That it was him I made the joke to! Honestly, I don’t understand it. It’s the same joke I would have told anyone from Slytherin.”
"I did, actually. No one else will deal with me. They don't want to be associated with an ex-Death Eater." He noticed that for once the other hadn't commented on something he had to say. He looked over curiously.
He cursed his body for blushing like a school-girl. Had he noticed? What would happen if he did? Would he think that Draco was gay? Not that it mattered if he knew, but Draco didn't want the whole world to know.
Just as he was finishing with breakfast, Harry came walking out in a pair of dark purple skinny jeans, black converse shoes, a black fishnet shirt and belts galore. Gloves adorned his hands as the choker on his neck. Draco nearly drooled as he applied his eyeliner perfectly without needing a mirror. He saw the other boy take a deep breath after he was finished, and as he exhaled his entire body relaxed as though putting on his makeup helped relax him more than anyone could imagine. And it probably did.
"All right. I'll be out in a moment." He watched as the blond went to his room and smiled as he heard a subtle gasp at the robes he had placed on his bed. They were a pastel blue with yellow embroidery creating abstract patterns throughout. The trimming was in the same yellow as the embroidery.
‘Well, I am allowed to use the loo but that’s only during designated trips. They have to let me out for that to happen.
"I..." Harry meant to defend himself, but couldn't. He thought about all the soft looks he would get now instead of hard and calculating. He thought about seeing the man sleep, safe in the realm of dreams, where anything could happen. He played the memory of Draco asking him why he cared as he slept. Harry looked up at his godfather and Elizabeth with wide, fearful eyes.
A tripping hex hit him and he fell to the ground. He knew that he was dead, and yet he couldn't bring himself to care. He just wanted Harry safe.
“Why would you even ask that? You’re a bloody great friend!” Draco must have sensed Harry’s disbelief because he continued after a moment. “Look, I don’t have many friends. Acquaintances, yes. Friends? Not really. In the time I’ve gotten to know you, you’ve done nothing but exactly what friends are supposed to be for and more. I don’t think you understand just how amazing of a person you are.” Harry shrugged and looked towards the sky to watch large puffy white clouds drift along the grey expanse above them.
“Maybe it does, but that’s besides the point! The point is I want a potion or something that will let me sleep-just for tonight. I haven’t slept for so long, I’m desperate to get some rest.” His vision swam with his desperation and in a flurry of emotions ranging from anger at himself for not admitting the full truth to hysteria from sleep deprivation, he stood.
"No, we've got nothing but trials for either people to remain in Azkaban or execution. It's nothing that'll let them get away. I don't need you until Monday."
"Draco Malfoy," he took his hands in his own and stared deep into his eyes. "Would you kindly make me the happiest man on earth by letting me court you?"
At that moment, it wasn’t Draco Malfoy that Harry was looking at. It was his mate. His beautiful, radiant and very happy mate. Their arms wrapped around each other and they stood there, embracing each other in their wings. Harry felt the tugging stop, and in its place he felt his magic slowly traveling out of him and towards Draco. He didn’t need to panic though, as he could feel Draco’s pouring into him just as quickly.
Draco nodded, suddenly wishing he hadn't eaten. He didn't want to run, he absolutely abhorred it. But his Malfoy pride prevented him from doing anything to stop it. He was determined to, at the very least, go along with Harry. He did have to work with the man. He didn't want to give him any material against him. Again, he felt like the determined boy he was in school, eager to prove himself to this man.
“That’s Lavande. She owns this place. She just wanted to offer her personal congratulations at finding you. If there’s one thing about Lavende, it’s that she loves seeing her favorites come here with a partner.” They looked through the menus, Draco describing everything to Harry, and the waiter suddenly appeared for their orders once they had decided.
He placed a hand on Harry’s back gently but firmly, holding out a handkerchief so Harry could wipe his eyes. He did so, but he was still shaking.
"Oh hell no! I've covered for you working with every questionable person so you wouldn't have to! It's your turn!"
It turns out Harry’s worrying was for nothing. When the subject came up, he had felt completely dejected but cheered up at Draco’s explanation.
Harry pulled him closer. In fact, he had been thinking about that exact thing earlier in the day. His overactive imagination had helped him find a plausible solution. “Draco darling, I wouldn’t mind you doing anything you want to me and then riding you in order to get to your neck a little easier. Actually, it sounds kind of fun.” He pressed their foreheads together and sent the entire scenario that was in his head to Draco. They both moaned as Draco begged for him to bite his neck and their lips crashed together as waves of desire swept over them.
"Black shut up. You might wake him." Draco picked the paintings up and put them face-down on the ground before picking Harry up. He carried him to the tent and pulled the sheets over his still form. The least he could do was make sure he didn't wake up with a sore back.
Harry met the question with annoyance and pure lust. The pain was still there, stronger than ever, but the desire was overpowering it. He heard Draco chuckling and felt another wave of lust crash over his senses as Draco sent him an image of him, on his knees between the blond’s legs. He was begging, whimpering with need both in his mind and in the image.
“Alright Harry, calm down there. In time, I shall stake my permanent claim to you but until then, you must be patient. Isn’t that supposed to be a virtue of yours?”
The two spent almost every waking moment in each other’s company the entire holiday. They got all their homework done within the first two days and spent the rest of their time flying, chucking snowballs at each other, helping the professors decorate and in general just being teenagers together. Draco complained about Pansy’s crush on him, Harry complained about Hermione’s incessant study schedules and the both of them complained about ancient runes.
The entire time he spent with them, he was thinking about Draco. At least they both had people they cared about there to take care of them when things got too bad. He had his friends and Draco had his parents there to help.
“Okay, here. Maybe easing you into this will help the shock settle a little slower.” He pressed Harry’s hand onto one of the wings that had appeared the day before. They were slightly spread out, outlining Harry’s body so they wouldn’t get too squished being under him.
The package included a small loaf of freshly baked bread, a small jar of jam and a package of flavoured crackers. Draco usually sent more than this, but it was unlikely that he’d had anything else to send on such short notice. Harry always gave him a few days notice before he’d run out.
"I never would have thought about checking for poison. Thank you for teaching me before it killed me."
After several minutes, Draco was finally able to lift Harry off his lap so they could fall asleep in each other’s arms. With the bond finally complete, they relaxed into each other’s embrace.
Harry walked down the hallway to gather his wits and calm down. There really was no reason to be this nervous. Perhaps some nerves would have been normal, but this was ridiculous. He just couldn't help but wonder what would happen if Draco said no. He couldn't think it.
Harry picked up a pen and, upon not being able to find any spare parchment or paper, simply wrote his response on the back of Draco’s letter.
‘In fact, I did inform my parents that I had a friend I would like to have over for the rest of the holidays. I didn’t tell them specifics and only mentioned that your family and you didn’t get along. They agreed that you can come stay and ask for the address so they can apparate to you.
Harry sighed, jotted down the address and sent the letter off before packing all of his things into his trunk. It took a bit longer than normal, since he had the urge to pack all of his belongings instead of just what he’d need for this year. He hoped he’d never have to be back, but he kept telling himself it was only because he didn’t know what the Dursley’s would do to his things while he was away.
It should be noted that these conditions are very rare, and caution should be used when any similar situations arise.’  Lucius showed the passages to Narcissa, and she gasped.
“Since babies aren't made with spells of this nature, his body is rejecting it while his magic tries to save it. His body will literally kill itself unless someone were to either donate sperm or actually commit the act with him. I thought you should know as you clearly care about his well-being."
The four of them apparated to platform 9 ¾ and they said their goodbyes to Narcissa and Lucius. They were both wiping tears off their faces as the train pulled away from the platform.
Draco just laid there, running his fingers through Harry's hair until he saw the tear fall. He wasn't expecting that, but what really caught him off guard was that once one fell many more fell in quick succession, seeming to fly down his face.
When they headed back up, Draco took extra care to make sure he flooded Harry’s senses with his scent. He fluttered his wings if they were anywhere near each other and stretched them out when they weren’t as if he knew Harry was looking. He even went so far as to bite his lip when he caught Harry staring.
"Then apparate to this address and ask for me." Harry walked into the fire just as he finished saying his destination. As the last syllable left his lips he vanished in a flicker of flames. All in all, Harry had been aiming for a rather dramatic exit, which is exactly what he got.
“Isn’t there anything we can do for him? We can’t just watch him suffer like this! Draco wasn’t this bad when he got his inheritance! I wasn’t this bad with mine! What is happening? You had better tell me now, or so help me Albus…” She got up and threatened him with her eyes. The intent was clear.
“It is quite pretty.” He cast an unbreakable spell on it. “But it would look much prettier in your ass, don’t you think?” Harry nodded and wasted no time in turning around and thrusting his bum into the air. One of the smaller plugs nestled between Harry’s cheeks quite nicely, the end displaying the Malfoy crest to show who Harry belonged to. He removed the plug and dumped some of the lube straight into Harry’s hole as it twitched.
"Harry...Will you be the one?" Fear of rejection suddenly hit him like a tidal wave until Harry said something the blond thought he'd never say.
“I want to do right by Harry and court him.” He started screaming at himself, wondering why in the bloody fuck he thought he could resist telling his mother anything when she gave him that particular look. It made his insides twist to know he was hiding something from her.
"Sure we have our moments. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. Not if it meant I could keep sharing a mirror with him in the morning." Severus stopped him with a touch to his shoulder.
"When I brought you that necklace, I thought that it would dispose of the bad influences on us. But little did you know that the necklace is a part of a set. A courting set." At this point he had to pause for breath, quickly recovering and getting on with the story.
When he woke up, he was in the arms of someone else. He knew from experience that it wasn't Severus that was holding him-he wasn't as toned as this person was. And he was certainly taller than this other person because his arms were longer.
“Why, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy it is good to see you two. I do hope your mother liked the gown I sent her for her social gathering over the springtime Mr. Malfoy.” She turned to Harry and gasped in pure shock. “Mr. Potter! Still wearing those robes from two years ago? I’m appalled! Spelling them to fit you better is only going to make them look worse! Tisk tisk, we must get you in new robes immediately.” She whisked Harry onto a pedestal and had just spelled the measuring tape to do its job when Draco leaned in and quietly spoke to her. “Of course. Follow me, Mr. Potter.” She led them into the back where multiple sewing machines were quietly sewing along the pinned marks.
Bits of food were everywhere, strewn about the Hall as if there had been a giant food fight. Harry hadn't been too interested, so Draco just took him back to their dorms and levitated Harry onto his bed. He pulled out a pair of pajama pants and laid them next to Harry before going to his own room and putting on a pair of silk ones. Coincidentally, they had been the same color.
"Yes, that's the general idea. Personally, I think everyone wants someone there to back me up in case something happened. The only problem with getting someone to be my partner that already works here is that I've worked up something of a reputation that people don't care for. They're afraid of me, which suits me just fine."
"So you're going to hurt yourself more by continuing a job you despise and seeing the man you love live his life out without you? I don't think so. You've survived a lot, but that can kill you. Harry, I love you, you know this. I can't allow you to let something this good walk away."
Draco sighed, listening to his pitiful excuses of why he took multiple trips to wizarding towns across the globe. He even went to Russia for Merlin's sakes! But, he knew he was honestly trying and it couldn't be anything bad since Harry was telling him where he was going. Hell, he even took one of Draco's house elves with him whenever he left the house so Draco knew what towns he was going to and to prove he wasn't being unfaithful to him and the baby.
“What happens if we don’t want to go the full amount of time allotted? I know ours said two years but what happens if we decide we don’t need the full two years?” Harry had to admit, he knew Draco was surprised by what he said, but the hand in his hair never faltered.
The Malfoy watched as everyone basically took everyone down. He jumped when Harry's voice boomed throughout the castle.
“Actually, yes. I...you see...I made a bit of a joke earlier and I wasn’t sure how it would land but it seemed to be fine. Same type of joke I’d make with anyone else. But I’m not sure how I feel about it since it was Harry I made the joke to.”
“Oh that’s harmless. I do find it interesting that he blushed, though. Now, what about the joke concerns you?”
"Fine. Just promise me that you won't change your opinion of me once I tell you. Not even Ron and Hermione know. Consider it a debt repaid." Draco shuddered. It must have been bad to know that Harry wanted him to not change his opinion of the other boy so much he'd call on the incident when he'd rescued him from breaking his neck in Charms. He nodded, showing his agreement.
He landed on a bed and looked around, recognizing his garden around him, with the smell of fresh flowers and life around him. He looked at Harry, and smiled just before Harry kissed him.
The next few months were spent going to classes and the spa. It seemed that Harry really had enjoyed going and had taken it upon himself to wake Draco up extra early so they could go earlier and spend the rest of the day lounging around in their rooms or simply shopping before going in.
“Ah, I sort of...didn’t think about that. Sorry.” He looked rather contrite and Harry brushed him off.
At three in the morning, Harry woke with Draco lightly shaking his shoulder and him screaming his throat raw. He wondered what questions he'd have to answer, and was surprised to find that Draco didn't ask questions. He thanked him and they went back to sleep, both knowing that the other was hiding major things from the other. Harry knew he'd have to come out with his entire story to Draco sooner or later, and Draco to him with his. He just didn't know when, and he was afraid it would be the next day.
Apparently Draco was still in bed because he felt the mattress dip near him and the duvet was pulled off of his face. He scrunched up his face in protest at the bright light and yawned before sitting up, eyes still closed. Harry was busy trying to locate his glasses while Draco watched with a smile.
His mum met them at the station and the three flooed from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry told Draco to spend some time with his parents while Harry started in on the essay he had planned on finishing the night before but never got to.
Inside was a bag of specialty owl treats for Hedwig, a jar of the expensive non-smudging ink that Harry always looked at but never splurged on and a plain silver ring that disillusioned itself when Harry touched it.
Smiling, Draco got up and walked to the cabinet against the wall. Harry moaned his displeasure of being left alone and melted into a puddle of whimpers when Draco ran his hand along the top of his wing on his way back. His cock wept with need when he felt a small trail of oil drip onto it. He had just enough time to process what it was before he felt Draco’s hand rubbing the oil in.
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I have." Harry cocked his head to the side in curiosity, not unsimilar to a bird listening for worms and bugs in the ground. "I believe that a friend of mine can help." Harry watched Draco carefully, analyzing his every emotion and movement, hoping that it would give him a clue as to who he was talking about. He finally gave in, silently admitting that he hadn't the foggiest clue who that person could be.
Harry walked in first, eyeing the dark colored walls. Each room was a different color, however they all matched as they were all dark colors with black accents. He loved that. He also loved the fact that there was a kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a library, a large office with two desks connected to the library, and a den. He loved it.
“A bit. But there are more important reasons why I don’t need the full two years.” He could hear Draco smirking, he just knew it.
After another two days of Draco writing apology letters to everyone he could think of that deserved an apology from him, Harry finally had quieted down. His movements were much slower, and were happening less frequently now. His brow was no longer furrowed as drastically, but a hint of pain still lingered on his face. Narcissa and her son were hopeful that they were nearing the end.
“The knob on the left is hot and the one on the right is cold. But do be careful, the hot doesn’t have a warm-up period like Hogwarts does.” Draco smiled and left him to the bathroom, leaving the door cracked a bit to let steam out. Harry turned the knobs and quickly stripped, hurrying into the shower and closing the glass door before testing the water from the showerhead. It was some fancy once that reminded him of how it felt to stand in rain.
"Harry, you cannot simply sit there and not eat! I finally got you to eat a decent meal for a child of seven and you only ate a few bites tonight!"
“Malfoy.” The name wasn’t said with hostility, but Hermione’s voice didn’t leave any room for warmth either. Draco stepped forward, his hands held up in surrender.
Normally, he’d be out with Draco on their brooms trying out new quidditch moves or playing a seeker game, but today’s weather was not having it. Thunder rolled gently through the sky with rain pattering down in steady waves. An occasional flash of lightning would be followed by a large CRASH of thunder, only to be followed by the softer rumbling once more. Harry was sat on the window seat, covered in blankets and surrounded by pillows, watching the scene with an oddly calm sense of fascination.
Ron made a face and scoffed a negative. Harry, on the other hand, politely told her that they hadn’t but they’d gladly keep a watch out for one. She turned to Harry and smiled, thanking him.
"Oh I beg to differ. He's usually very well behaved, if not a little perverted. I don't know why he's decided to be such an arse lately."
“Headmaster, I need to get to Malfoy Manor. It’s urgent.” He wasn’t even out of breath from the running he had done-he was that excited to see Draco again.
“Of course he is! He spends tons of time with Lavender when she asks him for company and he’s always trying to get Seamus and Dean to help him pull Neville out of his shell. He’s constantly supporting his sister, and he’s always helping younger years get to class without getting lost.”
Harry got up and left the room for the first time since he had entered, wandering up to the tea room while he tried processing what Draco has asked him not five minutes before.
“Thank you Draco.” Draco smiled and the two spent the rest of the day lounging in the Room of Requirement before dragging themselves to the holiday feast. There was only a handful of people there so there was only one table in the Great Hall which gave the two a good excuse for sitting next to one another.
“His family doesn’t have much, I think it bothers him that you have so much money and never want for anything when he’s had hand-me-downs his entire life.”
It was half an hour of unadulterated bliss for Draco, being brought to the edge and denied release over and over again. Harry’s mouth was just too perfect, and that tongue did wonderful things to him.
"Calm down. Now. As Minerva has deemed herself ready to educate you still, she has decided that I am to take the place of Headmaster of this school along with my usual positions otherwise. No other changes have been made, and the rules still apply to each and every one of you. I expect you to all be respectful of the students who may be arriving within the next week or so as they have all lost loved ones and have needed to, if I may quote one parent, 'get our heads together and stop sniveling in front of others as that's not attractive at all.'" He sat down as food appeared. Harry only ate one bite before putting his fork down. Feeling Snape's steady gaze, he managed another few bites and then slightly shook his head at the plate.
“And now they're trying to recruit more followers. They want to make your father the next leader. So we have to stop them. Naturally, I got a hint of suspicion when they both disappeared at the same exact time. I did a little research and came up with a few files of evidence. I gave Kingsley the file six months after I started.
“I don’t want it to affect our relationship. I’ll tell you if you want, but you have to promise you won’t let it bother you.” Harry agreed readily. He always was too curious for his own good.
He was truly worried that no one would buy his made up story. He was afraid that someone would question it and come up with something much closer to the truth. He already knew that's what Severus and Draco had done. They just didn't ask about it-yet.
"Goodnight Mr. Malfoy." He then leaned down and place a gentle, chaste kiss to Draco's lips and proceeded to his room to let Draco wonder at what he had just done.
Suddenly the room was entirely too hot, his trousers entirely too small and the looks Draco started giving him were entirely too full of lust. Harry took a deep breath and somehow made it through the boring dinner service.
Even if he was guaranteed that Draco would say yes, they still had a really good friendship. So he couldn't seem to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out. What would happen if he said no.
He slowly fucked him with his tongue and after the shock of what he was doing wore off, Draco started moaning and grinding against his face.
"Well, do you plan on staying with us?" He nodded. "Then you march your arse right back in there and fill out a resignation form for me."
Since when did he start referring to Malfoy as Draco? He didn't have the energy to care, but he supposed it was when Harry saw him cry in sixth year in the bathroom. He hadn't been an arrogant prick, he was human in that encounter.
"Mr. Potter, sit down. I must remind you that this is a hospital not the site of a murder." He hadn't even realized he was poised to hex someone into oblivion. He was beyond confused. And maybe he wouldn't be so confused if he wasn't livid at Draco's pain and even more mad at the reason for it. He was on the verge of realizing he actually cared for his partner. He never cared for his partners as a general rule. Oh sure, he cared about them, but never for them.
"I'm sorry, I'm being terribly rude. But my day has been pushing my patience to its end. Please don't think I'm like this every day. You can sit down if you'd like. Just throw the file down where you find room." He waved around indicating to the many chairs filled with stacks of similar files. He felt the other side of the couch tentatively lower as his companion sat down cautiously.
"Draco?" He realizes that Harry was trying to get his attention and stopped in his ranting. He was losing steam anyway.
Harry thought over his answer carefully. The truest of answers was that he was almost afraid to bring anyone into the dynamic Harry and Ron had created-it hadn’t worked out the best with Hermione and everyone that tried to get close to Harry always kept their distance when Ron was around so he hadn’t even bothered trying after second year.
“Narcissa, then. What’s wrong with your son? The whole lot of you, actually. No offence.” He could feel a blush creep up his cheeks at his rudeness.
"No, I wasn't, actually. I came to provide support. I want to help, and I don't know how. That's why I waited for so long." His demeanor clearly conveyed concern and something that Harry couldn't identify. He knew it wasn't pity-he'd had enough of that in his lifetime. He knew what that sounded like. But it wasn't anything he was familiar with. He got to his feet, still shaking.
Harry dashed to Dumbledore’s office, his feet hardly touching the floor. He skidded to a halt as the Headmaster walked past the gargoyle.
Draco had seen Harry surprised before, but nothing could prepare him for the brief look of shock when Draco had expressed his glee for the pregnancy. Obviously he thought that Draco would be upset, at the very least. And with the side of him that Harry had seen, he guessed he shouldn't be surprised at his shock. He gazed at the wall contemplating his options.
"See...us three used to play a truth game when we were younger and we could get rid of Peter. Bottle of truth potion, and a bottle of a muggle hangover remedy. Nasty stuff. Anyway, we could either drink the truth serum and answer one question or drink the hangover remedy and risk puking all over. Most disgusting thing ever." Sirius pulled a face.
Draco woke slowly, relishing the feel of sunlight on his bare skin. He never really enjoyed sleeping in longer than the sun, but all the physical labor had apparently changed his mind.
"No, tell me." He looked up, albeit at an awkward angle and noticed that he wasn't going to budge. "Please?" He seemed to give in at the small plea.
A small part of Harry, the bitter part that hated happiness, the part of him he had to create to destroy Voldemort, was disgusted and saw the signs. Harry was hopelessly smitten with the blond man in front of him.
"You startled me." A sparkle in the light brought his sight to Draco's neck, and his breath was taken away by the sight Draco made in the necklace. He was gorgeous. Absolutely nothing could compare to it, and only after he got over his mild shock at the beautiful display before him did he notice that Draco wearing it must have meant he accepted. Right?
"Everyone SHUT UP!" The students stopped their torrent of curses for the moment to listen to their Savior. "Look, just stop. Fighting is not what school is for. Now control yourselves. You think I haven't heard all the whispers? You think I don't know the rumors floating around? I know about them, I hear the comments. But you didn't think about the most important factor. I DON'T CARE! There's nothing you can say that will hurt me, so stop trying. And to everyone else who has decided to defend us-it's not worth your breath. They'll never stop. So just don't bother wasting your time." He cancelled the volume charm and let his protection spell fall. "C'mon Draco, let's go. I can't eat anyway."
“Summon the wine you bought.” A bottle slapped into his hand and he took a glance at the label. “I’ll hand it to you, you at least picked a good bottle for the lower end of the prices I usually pay.”
Harry really couldn't resist offering to help the poor man-Harry knew that the blond would be eaten alive by anyone else. Harry, at least, could only trust himself not to kill him. Not that he cared if someone else murdered him, but he wouldn't do it himself because that would have made it completely unnecessary to save his life the previous year.
Eventually Draco left to change into some clothing and Harry grabbed a sheet of parchment and his invisible ink and started to make a list of reactions he had to the other man. It was quite long already.
Draco watched Harry as he easily broke the fight up. Up until the last two men were left, he hadn't paid any attention as to what they were shouting about. He wasn't sure he wanted to know, either. Nonetheless, that didn't stop his ears from catching the sound waves leaving the throats of the fighters and his brain for registering the meaning of what they were saying.
Being immersed in his thoughts, he didn't feel the weight leave the other side of the couch. He jumped when he felt small, but unyielding, hands start massaging the stress from his shoulders. He stayed tense with surprise for a fraction of a second, and then promptly relaxed, not caring about anything as long as those hands continued to work the knots out of his shoulders and neck.
"They starved me. It wasn't just one meal a day it was one meal every few days. If stale bread and a piece of cheese count as a meal. They locked me in the storage room under the stairs until I was eleven. Then they moved me to a spare bedroom under the threat of Hagrid for a month. They then decided that under the kitchen sink would teach me a nice lesson. I've been stuck under the sink since I was twelve.
The next week was filled with gentle caresses and soft looks shared between the two during random times of the day. Shy looks were thrown at one another and smiles were traded often. All too soon, Harry realize he needed to ask Draco out on a date at some point, or they'd be stuck in the same spot for quite awhile.
He imagined what it could be like. Harry would be there for him, and when the baby came he'd ignore every spiteful word out of his mouth because he'd know it was just the pain talking. He imagined that he would stay home and help around the house, just because he could.
“It says here that we can allow students over the summer that can’t go home, but the only caveat is having a ministry guardian who would allow it.” Harry’s shoulders slumped.
“The perfect balance then! Please, help yourself. I have plenty of sweets and tea to go round.” He paused and gave Harry a knowing look. “I may be old and senile, but I know a worried face when I see one. You know, I vaguely remember being your age-well, perhaps I was a year or two younger-and I was ever so worried that my mum would chop me up for potions parts if I so much as hinted I wanted dinner at a friend’s house. Quite proud of her cooking, that woman.”
Draco Malfoy was running on his own, down the same path they took on the very first day Harry started training him. He was astonished to see that his partner was almost halfway done with the three-mile path Harry had made, which had to mean he had started a while ago. He was amazed, no one had ever taken the initiative to start their training without him, and the fact that Draco Malfoy of all people did surprised him. He hadn't been surprised since he had seen all the students that took cover in the Room of Requirement when Snape had been Headmaster. It seemed that Draco was stirring a lot of emotions he hadn't thought he could feel in years.
"So. Two major Death Eaters managed to escape our searching. In short, your father and Bellatrix Lestrange. Did you love your father?" He watched Draco decide if he was going to answer or not.
Trying to act nonchalant, Draco shrugged and said, “I can always spray it with my cologne if you want.” Harry was the one blushing now, but nevertheless he did request that Draco do exactly that.
"You just have to be in a room close enough that if you hear something you can wake me up pretty quickly." Draco nodded.
"I wrote her a letter this morning and we're doing it on Wednesday afternoon since we only have one class first thing in the morning." They split up for the night, neither one of them wanting to eat anymore. The night was just too stressful for them to handle and they went to sleep after silently finishing their homework.
"Sure. I've been watching you two work all day and I want to be able to ask the questions I have." Draco nodded his consent and she smiled brightly as he propped her picture up on a nearby log so they could both see her.
“I think that’s enough for one day, dear. Come back down tomorrow for tea and we’ll pick up where we left off. We’ll be covering properties and household management next!” Harry nodded and slowly made his way back upstairs. He couldn’t get one particular thought out of his head.
‘The dark angel typically has five bonding stages after they locate their mate: Teasing, Courting, Testing, Reuniting, and Bonding. Most other species only have four steps, combining Reuniting and Bonding into one.
"It's just...I've had to live with it since I was eleven. It's a long time." The next thing Harry knew, he was falling asleep to an old lullabye that Severus used to sing to him late at night after he would have a nightmare. The next thing he remembered was the song ending and picking up again before ending a little while later, as he was being put inside his bed.
Eventually he must have drifted to sleep, because the sound of his uncle pounding up the stairs awoke him with a start. He jerked up out of bed, silently hurried across the room and sat on the floor behind his dresser. The smaller and more insignificant he made himself seem, the less likely they would bother with him. He heard Dudley stomp to his room and heard the soft rattle of one of the locks being undone.
Draco had become a close companion, keeping Harry company and keeping him in bed most of the time. They talked about their inheritances, their time at Hogwarts in years past and about the classes they were struggling with. Draco seemed to be doing excellent in all the classes Harry fell short in, and vice versa.
Immediately he knew the answer was yes, and smiled at the thought. How Draco Malfoy was able to entwine himself into Harry's life in school and out was a mystery to him.
“Come on, I’ll show you to our wing.” Draco snapped his fingers and asked the house elf that showed up to take the trunk to his room.
“Wait, that’s what we’re doing today?” She waved his concern off and turned to preserve his modesty while he tossed clothes on to cover himself.
"Ah, dropped the act, have we? All right, what say you to the House I recommended all those years ago?"
Narcissa and Lucius had done everything possible to make sure Harry was comfortable. They had even moved Hedwig into his room with him. She seemed to adore the large perch they had placed by the desk and was especially fond of the window always being open and a small pile of treats for her to snack on throughout the day.
When he pressed her for an answer on why he had to learn that one first, she simply mentioned that she knew her son well and that he’d probably explain properly later. While that didn’t ease his nerves, he shrugged and they jumped right into the subject.
“Oi-Harry! Blimey mate, where’ve you been all summer?” Harry turned to see Ron and Hermione running towards him. Smiling, he hugged Hermione and nodded at Ron. His stomach twisted with dread for when they realized who he was with.
But if he asked...then they'd have both parents around and Draco wouldn't need to worry about lying. He could get eternal love from his child. The only problem with that plan is that he didn't want to force someone to agree to it.
“My Dragon…” he practically whimpered when he realized what was happening. Draco was carding his fingers through his hair, slowly shifting his weight from side to side to produce a gentle rocking.
Draco was amazed to find out that Harry really did enjoy shopping. He knew that the other was self conscious, especially when he had to find the smallest size and it still didn't quite fit. He honestly felt bad for him, but as time went on and the boy gained more and more weight he was proud of him.
“Shh. Relax. It’s nothing bad. As a matter of fact, even in these ratty old scraps you look rather dashing. Trust me.” Harry’s hands followed everything Draco was mentioning, so he hesitated in between to give him some time to adjust. “Your ears are a little more pointy at the top, your nose is straight now. None of that broken and healed a little off nonsense. Your skin is more fair now, and very soft looking without any blemishes or discoloration. Although you do still blush, it’s more subtle now. Your eyelashes are darker and fuller, your lips are fuller and a nicer shade of pink for your new skin tone. Your hair grew so now it hangs over your eyes a little and it’s got small streaks of color in it.”
"May I sit here?" Harry nodded and looked back at the table before glancing at Draco. He shrugged, so he looked back at the girl. "I have no problems with you two. It's everyone else." She raised her voice. "And all the Slytherins should be okay with you two since we have more of a reason to stick together no matter what...right guys?" Everyone within hearing distance nodded, but made no other move to talk to them. The Slytherin House was pretty quiet as a whole.
When Harry woke up the next day he dressed mutely and didn't eat anything for breakfast. His throat burned from the previous night and his stomach couldn't handle food when he was this stressed, and stressed he was.
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I have." Harry cocked his head to the side, clearly waiting for an explanation. "I believe that a friend of mine can help." He thought he saw a flicker of hurt in Harry's eyes and he made his choice. He just wasn't sure when he'd act on it.
"Happy Christmas." He handed Draco the box wrapped in a deep purple paper and tied with gold ribbon.
"Draco, I'm assuming you signed up for desk work, am I wrong?" He shook his head, wondering where this was going. "Sorry to have to inform you...I don't play well with others, as you probably noticed." He nodded. "So my boss wants me to go around catching all these people. I have some good contacts and I'm an excellent tracker. This is fine with me. However, the paperwork is overwhelming.
"Any clue about what? Seriously, this is what I know. I know you were a vicious child because you were scared and on your own. I also know that when you grew older you acted out of fear for your mother and friends. You did exactly what I would have done."
“It is though! Don’t you get it? He has girls practically lifting their legs at their hero. Think about it, he’s a hero and everyone wants him because of that! Could you imagine how he’d feel if he thought I was manipulating my way into his heart simply because of his celebrity status? It’s not worth it. I’d rather die.”
Sure, he’d been hit at the Dursley’s before but this was Hogwarts. School was supposed to be safe, free of needless violence. The sheer weight of how wrong he was hit him full force as he curled into a ball to try to reduce the shaking. ‘I’m not even safe from my friends…’
Both men groaned as Harry’s fangs sank into the pale flesh. Blood rushed into Harry’s mouth and Draco whimpered as the venom raced through his veins once again. Harry was done after a few mouthfuls and healed the wound before looking into Draco’s eyes.
"To make up for all of the horrible things I've said and done to you, I want to take you somewhere after classes today." The juice ended up sprayed all over Draco's pajamas.
He wasn't a hundred percent that anything would work out in his favor, but hey. He figured that Harry Potter didn't do anything halfway and he wasn't going to let a childhood feud get in his way of having a family. He might even grow to like the git more than he already did. They had trained together and had taken out two of the most dangerous people out there after Voldemort's death.
"Excuse me, what exactly do you mean by that?" Harry looked perplexed and livid all at the same time.
Harry leaned down, thirst ripping its way through his very being. He could think of nothing else while his body hummed with pleasure from Draco. His breath skimmed across Draco’s neck, and his fangs lightly trailed down to where his pulse was closest to the skin. Breathing in the delicious scent of blood and Draco was almost too much for him.
He had noticed that not only had the boy been getting thinner, but he hadn't been getting very much sleep. His eyes slowly started losing what little light they had to begin with. His hair lost its luster. His skin, albeit tan, was almost sallow-looking. He looked sickly.
“Well, why not?” That took all the steam out of his ramblings. “He’s an attractive young man. You’re always talking about him during the summers, you offered to take him into our home, you’re constantly finding ways to be around him during school and you’re nervous around him when lewd subjects arise. It makes sense to me.”
He felt warm all over, inside and out. He heard Draco practically chirping in happiness. They had both waited so long for something they didn’t even know they missed.
Harry had fallen asleep almost immediately after Draco slid out of him, worn out after the incredibly long day and even better lovemaking. He smiled and shifted off of him, happy to hold the brunet close as he drifted off to sleep with his husband. He knew there would probably be arguments in the future-and from their history they’d probably be tame compared to what he’d seen his parents to be capable of. But he also knew he would do anything for the one in his arms. Whatever problems they would encounter, whatever issues they may come across, the two would be able to work through them together.
"Draco. DRACO!" But he was too late in warning the other man of the dangers of what he was doing. The blond bent over, gasping in pain. Harry picked him up and placed him back down onto the bed, making sure he was in a comfortable position.
"LOOK YOU, I AM NOT LEAVING MY HUSBAND NOW BACK OFF AND DO YOUR JOB!" The Healers left him alone after that and let him hold Draco's hand.
He then went out to the kitchen to find his partner and was astonished to smell something in the oven. Not as surprisingly, it smelled delicious. His mouth watered.
“Mum,” Draco’s tone was far more serious than he had ever made it sound when speaking to her. This grabbed her attention, something he wanted to be solely on him for the time being. “I want to learn about it. The marriage contracts, the courting rules, everything. I really can’t afford to go into this blind.”
Harry did and his face lit up when he saw the incredibly soft, super plushy teddy bear. Harry looked up at him, half afraid it was a cruel joke.
When he arrived at lunch, he saw Harry sitting at the Gryffindor table and waved while he turned to talk to some of his friends in Slytherin. He didn’t want to take too long, but it would be worth it to see Harry blush in impatience.
So the least he could do was wait until he woke up. Instead of feeling sorry for the sleeping man, he thought about what he said before passing out. He had heard, with perfect clarity, that the lesson was learned. Good, so he was forgiven for poisoning his partner. That made him feel a little better about what he did, even with all of the shit he had been put through thanks to the Sleeping Beauty in front of him.
"All right Mr. Malfoy, you're free to go. Come back in a month." He muttered something that Draco would have sworn was along the lines of 'if you make it that long..."
"Yes, run." Harry looked at him incredulously. "Your endurance has to be terrible. I've only seen you run two times and both were because your life was in immediate danger. So, we're running every day before working on your strength and fighting skills."
"With Voldemort being the entire focus of my life, I never really knew how to have fun. I could never do anything I wanted-it was always what the public wanted of their Savior. I've wanted to be like this my entire life, and the fact that I couldn't because of society hurt but I dealt with it.
Inside resting on sapphire blue velvet was a necklace made of the finest white gold goblins could find. It reminded him a bit of the princesses muggle children always talked about, with the delicate threads of gold draping down and coming back up to connect with each other. Each place that the threads touched each other was adorned with the brightest, smoothest cut sapphires Draco had ever seen.
Harry stepped out of the fireplace and quickly wiped the ash of of his shoulders. He looked around, curious as to why the house was silent. He knew Draco was here, as it wasn't a foreboding silence...it was just odd.
He tucked Harry into bed and turned out the light before climbing in beside the veridian-eyed man. The slight movement on his part was enough to pull Harry out of his hypnotic like bliss, if his turning on his side to face Draco was any indication.
Suddenly, Harry’s eyes opened. The pupils were dilated, you could hardly see any color left at all. They were filled with passion, desire and they practically dripped with thirst. Draco flipped them around, never disconnecting their bodies. He sat up against the headboard with Harry stradling him.
"But as for spending as much time with Draco Malfoy as I have, I just decided that a schoolboy grudge wasn't worth a lifetime of fighting with someone for no apparent reason. Draco saved my life and for that, I felt that it was time to put a petty argument away, permanently. He agreed, and we now share private rooms to prevent harassment and to better our studies. It's easier for us to concentrate in a quiet room alone than with an entire other House or in the library where whispers are sent across bookshelves." Harry got up and left, leaving the reeling writer alone and walked swiftly down the hallway. He could hear Draco behind him, giving him room and time to think before catching up to him in their rooms.
“He’ll have it written and likely submitted to you today. But I’d like to be prepared with our own version so we can compare.” Deciding to drop it for now, Harry finished dressing and followed her downstairs to her parlour where tea and a light breakfast sat on her desk. Parchments were spread out around the plates.
“Oh, is that the pulling sensation I get every now and again when you’re across the hall?” Draco nodded, happy that he had caught on so quickly. “So how can we strengthen it? Before you leave, I mean.”
"I'm assuming that they made you go through a few testing situations?" Draco nodded, remembering the ridiculous situations he was put on before they would even take his resume. "Well good.
"Merlin's Beard Harry! It's getting late and you need rest. I'll wake you up so you can get packed."
Confused, Harry looked at the package and saw the tag to be from Draco. He tried to say it wasn’t necessary but Draco insisted until Harry relented and opened the package.
The severity of the damage was worse than he had thought, but at least it was readable. Of course, Draco would have to wait until the next day when the culprit would come back to give him a tongue-lashing. He never took it lightly when someone would write in a book-why wouldn't you just write your notes on some parchment and stick it in between the pages like any respectable person would do?
Harry pulled him to the stone bench, charmed to be as comfortable as the most comfortable recliner would be. Draco sat, and Harry took to the ground, as he was prone to do lately.
"He's got the most gorgeous eyes ever. They're blue but more like a watery blue almost like they could pass as silver from far away. I can never get enough of that color. And they're outlined by all of those black eyelashes that curl up just slightly." Harry could feel a blush rise up to his cheeks but studiously ignored it in favor of talking about Draco.
"What?" A dangerous growl left Harry's throat. "I. Don't. Take. Orders. And. I. Don't. Do. Other. People's. Jobs." Then the idiotic man had the nerve to defy him.
They had managed to pull back and rein in their lust just as Narcissa knocked on their door. Sitting up, they called for her to come in.
They both climbed into the bed, Harry having to almost-but-not-quite jump onto the tall bed, and stayed to their respective sides for about an hour and Draco had just started to drift off when Harry whimpered. He reached over and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair until they both settled into sleep.
He had been at the table finishing his lunch when Harry had given him his Invisibility Cloak. He had said to wear it for the day while he gave an announcement to the paper. It was simple and to the point. That he'd be too busy courting someone to really be out and that they shouldn't worry if they didn't hear from him for quite awhile. He didn't take any questions-a brave and smart move in Draco's opinion.
They mulled over the information that Lucius had found and Draco let a small smile, full of hope, grace his face.
He dressed in what Harry told him to get dressed in and ate a light breakfast before Harry arrived. Apparently he wasn't meant to have his entire breakfast before Harry showed up because he hadn't finished when he heard the Floo open. He watched at green flames flickered and flashed before letting Harry out of its warmth. He tried not to look too long at the grey tank top and loose black shorts.
It just didn't make sense to Harry. Every time he seemed to be having a good day something always had to go wrong. Call it whatever you want, but Harry needed certain things to be run certain ways because of the war and nothing anyone did would change it. But it seemed that those ways can get in your way more often than not when the world decided to send people who didn't know what they were doing your way.
“Harry!” She hastened over to the bed, smiling at him. “You’re at Malfoy Manor. When Albus approached us about keeping you here for the rest of the summer I was delighted to accept. I was hoping I could apologize, on behalf of the entire Malfoy family, for the way we have acted in the past.”
When they walked in, I noticed that Mary was at the receptionist's desk. She started talking before she looked up.
Grasping the pendant, he focused on sending all his loneliness through the bond. He could feel the sadness come back but with a hint of determination. It was if Draco was telling him that they were going to make it, even through all the pain.
Harry gulped. He wasn’t sure he liked all the changes Malfoy was talking about. Although he did like the sound of softer skin and a straight nose again, the rest he was a little concerned with. “Do I still look….like me?” He frowned when Draco laughed.
‘I had this specially charmed. The chain won’t get tangled or grab at your hair and the pendant is meant to give off a subtle glow if I’m thinking about you. And before you ask, I had commissioned the piece a few days ago. It will also warm slightly if someone is lying to you. It won’t burn, but the warmer it is, the more severe the lie. I think it’s time you knew when people were hiding the truth from you.
He had to make a decision within seven days. Well, six in Draco's mind. A Malfoy is nothing if not punctual, and when it came to his child's life, early was on time. And the sooner the better. Now the only question left was: did he ask Harry or not?
“I went and bought a reasonably priced bottle to drink, but I may have tried a sip of the one you opened just before you left instead.”
"Potter you've been in here two bloody weeks! We can't hold anyone longer than three. We need the paperwork done." Harry nodded and went back to staring at Draco's face, willing his eyes to open. "Harry. You don't understand. I need someone's memories and I need them by tonight. Malfoy is too unstable, his won't work even if he did manage to wake up today. I need yours."
Tears welled in Harry’s eyes and he practically ran from the room. He bolted through the common room and just kept walking. He didn’t stop until he realized he was at the top of the Astronomy tower. When he realized where he was, he sat down and thought about all that Ron had said.
"Harry, I believe that I could be happy with you. And I certainly don't plan on being the only one affected by sleepless nights. Look, I think this could work. It'll take a lot of work after hating each other so thoroughly when we were young, but it's not impossible. Is your offer still open?" Harry, not knowing what else to do, nodded.
According to a reliable source, no one knows for sure what Harry Potter did during the summer, or the reasons behind the sudden change in his appearance. But, many people are speculating that the man actually wishes he were a woman! The reporter cannot verify this, but is determined to find out the truth to tell it to you-the faithful readers.
“Fine dear. A bit sad the rain has taken the patio for the day, but the flowers do need a drink. How are you and Harry?” Draco blinked, surprised that she had asked about Harry.
“You looked cold.” Draco shrugged and pointed to the other side of the window ledge. “Can I join you?” Harry nodded and Draco climbed up, letting their slippered feet tangle together under the pile of fluff. “Couldn’t sleep?”
Harry put the necklace on. As soon as the clasp latched, the gem started glowing faintly. A smile graced his lips-it was nice to know that Draco was thinking of him even if he wasn’t there.
Harry hadn’t expected Narcissa to come knocking on their door, nor did he expect her to barge right in past her son when he opened the door to start tossing clothes on Harry.
Draco, ever polite, said he’d owl Harry during the summer to which Harry vehemently insisted that he not do that. When prodded about it, Harry simply said his family didn’t like owls and wouldn’t appreciate it. To that, Draco asked if he could send an owl once a week in the super early hours of the morning to ensure Harry’s family didn’t know about it and Harry nodded. He could make that work, as long as they kept to their normal schedules.
“Oh heavens, no! It used to be more like that, back before my generation but as time goes on purebloods have realized that love has to come first or the relationship will only result in many couples being completely miserable. That’s why the courting period is there; to allow the two to get to know one another and without all the insane hormone rampages you teenagers get yourselves into.” Harry blushed. He’d never really felt as sexually inclined as the other boys in his year were, but he refused to bring that up at the moment.
He came to a little stronger the next time around. He had heard someone calling his name, repeatedly. Desperately? He heard it again, a little clearer now.
"Hey, were you with Severus?" He nodded and smiled as he looked down, letting his fringe hang in his eyes.
“You called for me, Professor?” Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, just a few steps inside the room. There had to be a good reason to pull him out of potions, Snape was going to have his head for the urgency in which Dumbledore had requested his presence. And to send Dobby, of all the house elves...Snape had fire in his eyes as he told Harry to get lost.
It was hard to believe that it had been a week already. Harry had taken Narcissa’s advice and took all the potions she provided him with. Bonnie had outdone herself, night after night with feasts aplenty. Harry eventually had to ask her to tone down the extravagance of his meals. He wasn’t hard to please, and always felt guilty that she would pile mountains of food on his plates when he couldn’t stomach most of it.
“Time to get dressed, you and I have much to discuss! Draco, your father expected you an hour ago. You’d best be going now.”
“Dark angels are said to be the most powerful creatures to roam the earth. They don’t even use wands, because their magic is so concentrated. They’re sort of a cross between an angel and a vampire-” Harry panicked at hearing that, but Draco put a hand over his chest in an attempt to calm him. “Relax, that’s not a bad thing. See, you get the best of both worlds. The wings, the ability to cast magic without anything more than your hands, the sense of morals, the patience, the ability to walk during the sunlight, never getting sunburnt again actually. Self healing, silent footsteps, getting to eat food. You get all the good, and none of the bad.”
"What did you have in mind Draco?" Harry's voice held an edge of playfulness to it that made Draco never want to be on the receiving end of it.
He found that he didn’t mind it as much when Draco told him what a good boy he was for keeping it all in overnight.
Harry looked up at him with wide eyes, a blush tinging his cheeks. What came out of his mouth was something unexpected.
"Ah, You're still mad about the new kid?" He chuckled and didn't wait for a response. "Well, I can say I'm one hundred percent proud of you. You showed all the other people just why I let you work alone and don't let you get written up for anything. Hell, you scared the shit outta Moody."
“No one has ever asking Bonnie to cook what she likes to make best! What fun! Bonnie will be most pleased, Sir.” She curtsied again and popped away. Narcissa shook her head.
It was a moment of instant panic, the moment that you wake up and foolishly hope you're dreaming but you know that you're not. In that moment Harry felt a pang of fear, something that he hadn't felt since Dumbledore's death. It was in that instant that he felt completely overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.
From that day on, Harry did his absolute best to not let anyone see him studying with Hermione and Draco in the library. He’d wear his invisibility cloak and sneak into a seat at their table before Hermione would cast notice-me-not charms around their area and strong silencing charms so no one would hear Harry talking.
Draco was lying on the bed reading a book Harry had conjured while he was waiting and had never finished.
"So, what's your real reason for coming over? I know you said you were lonely, but you didn't have to come to me."
To say that Draco was shocked was an understatement. Who knew that Harry would have the guts to even consider telling others how to cheat the system for money. Hell, who knew he'd actually think about the best ways to cheat the government out of money.
"So, you willing to give it a go?" Draco nodded. "Good. Then I'll meet you at your manor at four in the morning. Be dressed in loose shorts, a tank top, and running shoes. Don't bother with your hair or a shower. It won't matter in the end."
“I think the answer is obvious, my angel.” He essentuated his words by carefully placing Harry down on the bed under him and crawling over him. He pressed gentle kisses up his stomach, leaving Harry’s skin covered in goosebumps.
“You leave the language up to me, I’ll find a way to word it without offending anyone.” That cheered him up and gave him some confidence.
“I’ve also arranged a speech at the welcoming feast about you two. I ask that you two replace your charm when I leave this compartment and separate yourselves from the rest of the student body to come and find me before heading up to the castle.” The boys nodded, interested to see what else she had to say.
“You’re more than just a friend because somehow I’ve developed a bit of a crush on you.” Harry wasn’t sure what to think. The confession had sideswiped him and took him completely off guard. But the longer he looked at Draco, the more he started to wonder what it would be like to date him.
As the sun crept over the horizon more and more, Harry briefly thought about bargaining with his aunt again. If he could just get out of here to do some chores, maybe he could avoid Dudley and his anger. But the last several times were met upon deaf ears. She didn’t want him out of this room and wasn’t allowing him the opportunity to plead his case.
Harry drifted in and out of consciousness. Never enough to fully understand what was going on, but he first caught sounds of two people talking. He caught that one sounded remorseful. The next time he drifted back, it was to smell the flowers. Such a sweet smell...followed by some talk of an apology? He let himself drift again.
Draco slid the neck of the bottle into him, going slowly so Harry could feel the full effect of the twists the glass made. When the bottle bottomed out, Harry keened and pressed back in the hopes that there was more he could take. The blond, not in the mood to disappoint, withdrew the bottle and pushed it back in. He sped up and slowed down as he pleased, basking in the noises Harry was making below him. It was then that he had an idea.
Harry had just gotten about halfway through his plate when he went to sip from a glass of orange juice when Draco started talking.
"He's always got something interesting to say and I never know which way is up or down when I'm around him. He makes me feel like I've never felt before. He's why I've progressed so far with my eating. I wanted to get well and so I did. I made myself potions that would help my body retain what it would need. I ate more because of it, because I needed more in me to sustain my body. That's how I've gotten to be as big as I am.
At some point Harry had learned how to silence his screams in his sleep. Draco was furious, but decided that was a problem for later. He gently pried Harry’s arms off of the pillow he was clutching and wrapped them around himself instead. Harry didn’t fight back, but the twitching didn’t help any. He managed to get Harry’s head in the crook of his arm and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair again until he settled down.
“And did you drink any wine while I was away?” The instant blush was enough to give him away, and the hesitation only confirmed his suspicions.
It was a large circular room, encased entirely in glass. The floor was magically maintained grass, with tons of roses, orange blossoms, jasmine, honeysuckle and dozens of other types of flowers. In the center stood a small fountain and white marble benches were placed throughout.
“I bloody well know that! But you don’t understand, he’s always trying to be better than his brothers and his family doesn’t have enough money to go around and he’s just trying to make the best of a bad situation. It’s not his fault he doesn’t know how to handle it! His family puts a lot of pressure on him to be better.” Draco shook his head and focused on needing a sobriety potion. The Room, being the best thing ever at that moment, supplied two on the coffee table. He drank one and handed the other to Harry.
Lining the bottom was an assortment of sweets and chocolates. Lying atop the mass of sugar was a single white rose with light blue tinging the tips of the petals. He smiled at the thoughtfulness. He knew that Draco filled the bottom with sweets for Harry to share with his friends, for he loved sharing things with them. Since Ron was addicted to sweets and Hermione always appreciated chocolate, he couldn’t fathom any other reason the blond would have had for sending such things.
“I used to have one when I was little. You spin it around your finger when you’re nervous and it warms or cools depending on when would work best to help you focus. And it disappears when it touches your skin so no one will know you have it on.” Harry smiled at him and Draco handed him the last present. It was relatively large compared to the others, about the size of Harry’s torso, and prompted him to open that one too.
Harry apparated them to his cottage out in the country and Draco breathed in the clean air. That night they spent making love and chocolate chip cookies together.
“Are you going to say anything to the headmaster? Perhaps he could find a way to let you stay at Hogwarts during the summer.” Harry thought back to the last time he had talked to Dumbledore and shook his head.
“Do you take me for a fool, or do you just presume yourself to be that much better than me?” There wasn’t much fight behind his words, talking was going to take some getting used to again. He watched as Draco dipped his head.
"I'd like to be resorted, Sir." His voice was quiet, yet he was certain that everyone in the hall could hear it. The silence was so deep in the next two seconds that it actually had a noise to it. Without preamble or words, Snape turned and picked up the Hat. He placed it on his head and the rest of the castle waited with bated breath.
Draco was more cautious, and he took his time walking around the place. When he was done, he met up with Harry in the kitchen where Harry was making a small meal of pasta.
He sent an image of him running into Draco’s arms at the manor with curiosity. He wanted to see his veela again. The pain was growing the longer he was awake and soon he was retreating into their bond again.
Managing to say anything would be insanely difficult, but Harry felt like he needed to tell someone. He might burst otherwise. It took several attempts, but finally he managed it and once he started talking, he couldn’t stop.
The thoughts rampaging around in his skull were simply unthinkable. Being sure to keep his inward panicking to himself, he looked Draco in the eyes.
And interrupting his rules, was a soft rustling. Harry paused and watched, looking for any sign of consciousness. Upon finding none, he recited until rule number twelve.
"That's where I come in, isn't it? To provide documentation and to file said documentation? Not that I'm adverse to that..." Draco trailed off. He really wasn't adverse to the idea, he rather enjoyed watching Harry fight. He went at it with more passion than anyone he'd ever seen. Plus, he came up with some useful spells on the spot. He could learn from that, just like he used to do back in school.
Draco entered when she had started explaining the difference between a manor and a mansion. He was smartly dressed in black trousers and a button up shirt in a pretty cerulean blue colour and held out a scroll tied with a black velvet ribbon.
Elizabeth was sleeping soundly in her frame and Draco looked at all of the charms on his bracelet. The rose his mother had hand-gilded and painted was just as sad as ever. The petals were closed more than usual and the leaves were wilted. It meant that he was closed off to everyone around him and that he wasn't happy.
"I know. It's not your fault. I still love you." They remained like that for the next several minutes, just reveling in each other and knowing that Draco meant nothing harmful from his pain-induced screams. A Healer walked up with a white blanket.
“Listen, I wasn’t sure how they worked myself. I’d put off learning about them since I wanted to have fun at school; I didn’t want to tie myself down to anything too soon. I know myself, I would have tried to bring up contracts with everyone I liked and I didn’t want the other purebloods to think I was too indecisive for their offspring. By removing the temptation to court everyone I laid eyes on, I refused to learn about them.”
He ran into Ron and Hermione and gave them both hugs. He was so rushed that he hardly got out where he was going and wishes for them to have a good holiday.
"Go, I'll only be right here if you need me." He gave Draco a slight nudge, indicating that he should go sit with the Slytherins, and that he'd sit with the Ravenclaws. He was going to enjoy showing them up for once.
"It happened to me once." Harry hung his head in shame. He hated the fact that he had failed so spectacularly.
Draco came and joined him after a while, sitting on the opposite side of the seat and burying himself in with Harry.
Somehow they had managed to attach glue to him and then sprayed feathers all over the glue so they'd stick. Not even magic could get them out easily-he had to make up his own cleaning spell to rid his person of the idiotic pieces of fluff. Draco and Harry had laughed the whole time.
He walked up to the Headmaster and lowered his head in deep respect. He looked up when asked the question he had been waiting for.
They went to a curious bank filled with slightly scary goblins and endured another sickening form of transport before Harry was blinded by the gold in his vault. Having been told his entire life he wasn’t worth anything, he only took a few pieces, but conceded easily enough when the professor tutted and filled a small pouch.
“Oi, get off! You’re squishing me!” Draco complied and helped him off the ground before looking over him.
The next two months passed in a blur and before he knew it, he was standing on at an altar in cream robes with a deep yellow embroidery. His legs felt like jelly after having to walk all the way up to the man he was going to be able to call 'husband' in a few minutes.
"Of course." He was taken aback. Why wouldn't he be happy? He was having a baby and living with one of the hottest men alive. "Why do you ask?"
But he also felt all light and fluttery when he got another gift. Then again, he felt like that whenever Harry looked at him. He didn't know what to think.
“I guess both? It used to be the first one, no doubt about it. But then...well he didn’t like that time that I got hit with a bludger from so high up. Said he didn’t have time for such nonsense to visit every day and bring me the assignments. Hermione did it for me and she didn’t seem to mind being there. That’s when I asked her to make me one of these, so I wouldn’t be inconveniencing Ron when he has better things to be doing.”
He had known Harry was working in the Ministry, but never did he imagine that he was in an auror. It just didn't make sense that he would want to keep fighting when he had to do that his entire life. Or maybe it was because he didn't know how to do anything else. Either way he hadn't planned on working with him every day...wasn't school bad enough? He swallowed his pride and decided to go with it. His family name was put to shame, and he needed to rebuild a name for himself since his father had ruined it for him. If that meant getting a job, then fine. He'd do it. Even if it meant working with Harry Potter.
Overwhelming guilt at the things he’d said about Ron flooded Harry’s system when the sobriety potion chased away the pleasant fog the alcohol had him in. He shouldn’t have said those things about Ron, Ron was a good person. Wasn’t he?
"OH MY GOD! HARRY I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY! I'M A DAD!" Before Harry could do anything Draco had pulled him up and was jumping up and down like a schoolgirl.
He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but he was so relaxed that he didn’t even flinch when fingertips stroked through his hair, In fact, he smiled and leaned into it a bit.
“I know you’re concerned about Draco spilling his guts about your inheritance, but I assure you that he will not. Veela are unique for more ways than one. There are only a few reasons we can show our true forms to the people around us. Anger is one, but the other is trust. He trusts you with his secret and he wishes you to trust him with yours. He’s always been a little infatuated with you, you know.” She sipped her tea, knowing that questions were to follow.
Harry got a nagging suspicion and had to voice his question. He did so before his nerves could settle in.
"Teasing the shit out of my godson, that's what. If I had arms, I'd punch you. But seeing as circumstances stand...I can't." Draco gaped. This man had no idea how to have a civil conversation. He pointed out as much.
“Really?” Harry took a bite of a crumpet before drinking the potions that were laid out so carefully for him. He continued to nibble and sip as Narcissa talked.
"Simple. You're smart enough to know to carry an antidote. And even if you forgot that, then you know what you can and can't have. Unless the only thing in that pretty head of yours is nothing but hot air." Draco bit back a retort and managed a smile. The friendly banter was nothing but that, banter. It wasn't worth fighting over.
Try as hard as he might, Harry simply couldn’t remember a time when Ron had been as good of a friend to him as he had been to Ron. Sure, Ron had talked trash with him about the Dursleys, but how much of that was being a good friend and how much was simply rolling along with it because it was convenient?
A little while later, long enough for Harry to start dozing, Draco had started talking to him again. Father says that’s extremely rare that we would share a dream. But it’s a great sign. The message was followed with the image of Harry on the bed from their dream, crying out for Draco with need. It wasn’t long, but it was enough to make Harry squirm and clutch the sheets around him. Do you feel any pain still?
Hot water had never felt so good! He washed the grime off of himself and then washed himself again just to get rid of the sticky feeling he had. The third round was more normal, followed by a very thorough washing of his privates-bum included. He’d never really paid that much attention to washing that particular area of himself before, but he was rather curious about washing inside himself. It seemed logical that some people might-after all if some boys didn’t wash their dicks then there had to be some that did wash up in their own channel. He prodded the area, found that he was quickly gaining a boner and promptly stopped.
He put his head back on his fluffy pillow and drifted off into a doze. It wasn't often he treated himself like this, he always woke up early on so he could help his house elves do simple household chores. Currently he was cleaning out the entire West Wing, which had been neglected and closed off for the past two generations. Not even the elves were allowed to go in there and clean, so Draco had employed the help of the two elves he had kept, having donated the rest to less fortunate families, and was learning how to clean properly. The job was taking forever and he would wake up early in the morning and finish late at night every day. It irritated the elves that was for sure, but their orders were to help him clean at a human pace with minimal magic.
The rest of the school year proved to be uneventful. Harry managed to keep his distance from Ron, more so than he had thought he’d ever want prior to the holiday break, and spent more time with Draco in the Room of Requirement. They mostly studied, occasionally played exploding snap or chess and often they found themselves just enjoying each other’s company. It was strange, in the beginning. Harry hadn’t ever really been around anyone other than Hermione that was okay with silence. Everyone else seemed to be agitated when they were quiet and that usually meant Harry needed to diffuse the situation by trying to change the topic or by staying overly upbeat about something ridiculous. Bringing up the latest gossip floating around the school seemed to help as well, and had even resorted to making things up just to keep Ron entertained.
"I haven't had the best summer ever. I just thought that maybe it wouldn't be so bad once I was here. I'm kind of disappointed in myself that I let myself think all of the pain would go away overnight."
“One at a time, really are we animals?” Ron affirmed that statement while shoving a turkey leg into his mouth.
So Harry went into work that Monday a little earlier than usual...as in, three hours early. Whichever dumbfuck that gave him the wrong time this time would be sorely wishing they had picked a different career...in another country...with their mommies.
“It does sound peaceful. But what about friends? Company must be fleeting, at best. You wouldn’t have any relationships that mean anything. And talking helps people learn, helps them heal and let’s face it; it feels pretty damn good to complain about things every now and again. And love; you’d never find love if you were a snowflake. You’d never be around anyone long enough to develop that sense of trust-”
Harry shrugged. “I’m not sure why. My parents were killed by a madman, why would that make me special?” Professor McGonagall had given him a brief synopsis of Voldemort while they were shopping, but he wasn’t entirely sure why it made him so famous.
"What about me?" They scrambled off to follow the other three without a fuss, both trying to yank the other one back to get away sooner. Draco, having seen all this, looked like a porcelain doll that got tossed into a box full of matchbox cars, and Harry wasn't sure he liked that he scared his newest partner so soon.
“Oh come off it,” Draco exclaimed. “You’re Harry bloody Potter, of course everyone in the school wants to kiss you!” Harry just shrugged.
"Do you like him romantically though?" He thought about it and couldn't come up with an answer. "That's okay. Go back and just observe for awhile. Think about it from someone else's eyes. You might learn something." With that dismissal, Harry took off down the corridors until he reached their rooms and entered, fully prepared to observe everything about the other man as he could.
“No, Harry. That’s not true. Wands that don’t belong to a wizard simply don’t work. He would either be blowing things up every spell he cast or he simply wouldn’t be casting spells. Why else would your dormmate-Sean? Seamus?-be such a pyromaniac? He’s using his uncle’s wand most of the time.” That got Harry’s attention. If what Draco was saying then Ron was lying about his wand.
Needless to say, the two were utterly exhausted when the night ended somewhere in the early hours of the next day. Narcissa produced a portkey for the two and with many smiles, the two were off to their honeymoon.
"The maximum. As in, as much a you can cram in his mind-do it. I'll expect you two to be coming into work in a week." Harry watched his face disappear and hit his head repeatedly on the table. Not only does he have to continue with his aerobics classes, but now he had to put in overtime with Draco Malfoy.
"Um that's all fine and dandy but couldn't you do that? Provide memories, I mean." Draco watched the other man's face turn thoughtful and slightly dark.
“Did you sleep well?” Draco hoped Harry hadn’t noticed his breathing pattern change, but he didn’t seem alarmed by anything at least.
“Harry…Harry? Harry! I’m so glad you’re awake!” He squinted for a moment before forcing his eyes to open wider.
‘How’s your summer so far? I know you don’t enjoy being away from school and wanted to check in on you. Anything interesting happening?
So it was those thoughts that were interrupted by Draco taking notice of the Savior of the World looking at him almost as thought he was made of glass. After a moment of silence between the two, Draco decided that enough was enough.
"Harry?" He looked up, indicating that he should continue. "Who's this admirer person? It's driving me insane." Harry stood up and walked over to him slowly, thoughtfully.
He went to sit in the garden in the hopes that it would soothe the pain he felt. He missed Draco dearly. The roses seemed to do the trick-their soft perfume caressing some of the pain away. It reminded him of the times they had sat out here watching the stars.
“Harry, completing the bond is crucial, you can’t drink from me until then.” Harry whimpered, but nodded against his shoulder.
When he looked up again, it was because he heard the portrait open and close again. His mind told him to get up, to close the doors, and to make himself look normal. But his body had other plans for him. He remained on the floor, hoping that Draco would find him and go get Severus and praying that Draco would leave him be. He wasn't sure which one he wished for more, and that scared him.
He turned and made his way to the hospital wing. The bags around his eyes had caught Hermione’s notice that morning, and he wasn’t about to let it happen again without seeing Madame Pomfrey first so she couldn’t lecture him again. He took off the cloak and turned the corner while hoping that he wasn’t going to be disturbing her too much.
His eyes flew open, and he sat up. Did he really just hear Draco say he would do it? He had to, his ears never lied to him. Never. And judging by the was Sev was smirking, he didn't hear wrong. His day just started to perk up.
The tug moved, instead of subtly beckoning him towards the window, it was now pulling towards the door to his bedroom. It was getting stronger too, alarmingly quickly. His eyes opened of his own accord and he sat up, his brow furrowed. He couldn’t figure out what he was supposed to do, but his heart practically sung when Draco flew through the doorway.
“Draco? You’re driving me bloody mad with all the teasing. Are you going to be like this all the time?” Draco roared with laughter.
When they arrived back at the castle, Draco needing to levitate Harry there as he was too relaxed to walk, the two boys noticed that there wasn't anyone around. Wondering what could have possibly driven everyone away from the Great Hall, they made their way towards all of the tables that usually held the dinner.
Harry felt like an arse. Here was someone who seems like they want to help and he had just snapped at them. Although, he didn’t feel too bad as this was the one person who had come after him again and again in school.
“Have you tried flying yet? I know you will love it. Who knows, perhaps that will trigger your bond to develop. Maybe it just needs to know you’re done changing.” Draco’s eyes lit up at the thought of flying. He spread his wings and thought about how wonderful it would be to be soaring through the air…
His favourite had been shopping for a wand. Mr. Olivander was a bit senile and sort of eclectic but Harry liked him. He had a calm sort of energy, even if his shop practically screamed chaos. He happily paid for his purchase and upon Professor McGonagall announcing that was the last item on the list, asked if there was a pet store that he could go to. She smiled and happily led him inside a shop while he decided if he wanted an owl, a cat or a toad.
“And then what?” Draco’s heart was racing. He had gone so far out of his way to make Harry miserable, and why? To be around him. He used to think it was because he was jealous, but looking back he wasn’t so sure. And lately the two have spent more time together doing homework-rather insignificant but they did it near each other nonetheless. The cherry on the cake was now that him and Harry have had many meaningful conversations, and since he most definitely liked Harry’s personality, he was afraid of what his mother would say next.
On Sunday, Draco sent Harry to lunch without him. He used the excuse of needing a shower, but really he wanted to start teasing him.
“Did you mean to get one the same colour as your hair?” Draco blushed. He had indeed sought out the one that best matched his hair colour but he refused to admit it. “It’s too bad it doesn’t smell like you.”
He flung binding curses at the two traitors, and heard two distinct thuds. His anger covered any surprise at catching them that fast and effortlessly. His footsteps fell slowly, distinctly, and he saw their eyes widen.
"So Draco. Ready to throw away your figure and position in society for something so small you can't even see with a microscope yet?" Draco bristled, angry that he could assume Draco wouldn't be anything but ecstatic he was with child.
Harry paused in front of the stationary shop, thinking to himself. He hadn’t bought himself ink or quills since first year...he’s just been nicking the ones in the library or using the ones left forgotten in the common room. Shaking his head, he opened the door and walked in. He was going to treat himself to a new quill, ink and parchment if it was the last thing he did.
“No, I think I get it.” Harry closed his eyes, and concentrated on sending a wave of desire towards his better half. He opened his eyes when he heard a tiny gasp. “Like that?” Draco nodded, his cheeks warming. He hadn’t been expecting Harry to grasp the concept so quickly, or to be able to send such a strong emotion to him and he especially didn’t expect his angel to send something so naughty his way.
“What? I’ve no idea. I’ve only been to my trust fund since I’m not of age and my parents aren’t exactly around to tell me how much is in the family vault. I’ll find that out when I turn seventeen.” Draco blanched.
“Oh but I insist you tell me. It must be bothering you something terrible for you to be grinding your teeth at the table.”
Exhausted, he put his quill down. It had taken a few hours to finish the essay on horklump juice, he had always mixed up the properties it had with a horned slug.
When Vernon was done with him, he yanked Harry’s pants back on quite roughly and tossed him to the floor, spitting on his face. He left and Dudley came in, oblivious to what just happened, and kicked Harry into unconsciousness.
"Ha, best thing I ever did concerning them. They don't bother me at all anymore, they're all too busy speculating who I've decided to win over." Draco nodded, wondering when the gossip mill about him would stop. It had been a grand total of three months since the announcement had been made, and people were still talking about it as if it had happened yesterday.
“I-I don’t really know.” Honestly he had no idea what to expect that contract to contain. So they spent the morning and early part of the afternoon discussing what could be included and what’s commonly included. By the time afternoon tea came around, Harry was more confident in the things he wanted but was still unsure how to ask for them.
“Who was that?” Draco smiled, clearly getting amusement out of the faint trace of jealousy that laced Harry’s voice.
"My team and I have managed to get him to a slightly better state, but not by much. The only thing we could do to help him was to put him into a magically started coma. He can awaken at any time, and we assume that he'd want to wake up with someone he knows. Do you know of anyone that could fit these requirements?"
“Would you make your favorite thing to cook? I don’t care what it is, I’m sure it will be delicious.” Bonnie stood there, shocked. And then, she practically vibrated with happiness.
Their meal was consumed over simple topics, such as the muggle society and the conveniences of being an animagus. After Draco had eaten his fill, the topics got a little heavier, delving into Harry's opinion on Dumbledore and Snape. Draco had loved them, and hated them. Harry didn't know what to think of them.
The two of them had managed to find an empty compartment and after putting their trunks up Harry laid his head down on Draco’s lap. They had used very strong Notice-Me-Not charms so no one would see them.
“It’s quite stunning, isn’t it? My family has worked very hard to ensure the manor is well kept throughout the generations.” Harry saw the door open as they walked and suddenly he was plowed over by Draco.
The next day Harry was having tea with Narcissa and going over the finer points of how to manage properties and how to keep the buildings in shape even if they’re not in use. Apparently things can become run down in an absurdly short amount of time.
To times of torture and hate and madmen. To a time when Harry discovered he was supposed to die. But no-he wouldn't think of that. Not now, at work. Not while his ex-rival was sitting not three feet away listening to his every word, watching his every move. Not now, but later, when no one could watch him slowly fall apart, like what had happened every night since Harry discovered that he was the unintended Horcrux.
Their worlds suddenly felt right. More complete-like they had been living without a huge part of them for far too long. Draco spun Harry around, holding him to his chest with everything he had. Harry drank his lighter counterpart in, reeling from the heady scent that surrounded him. His bond sang with contentment.
Two weeks later, the nurse came in and announced a visitor. Kingsley walked in after she walked out.
But eventually Draco did come and find him, if the presence next to him meant anything. He looked up, his face only inches from Draco's.
It wasn’t until Halloween that anything out of the ordinary happened. Hermione had asked Harry to go study with her for ancient runes, a tradition the two had come up with to distract Harry from what day it was. Ron had interjected before Harry had an opportunity to say anything.
"All the same classes." He handed it back and Harry pocketed it before getting up. The three of them practically ran to potions, Pansy panting and clutching a stitch in her side. She wasn't used to running like the men were.
Harry proceeded to heat up leftover pizza and talked to Sirius for the rest of the evening. Then at around nine-thirty, Harry made the mistake of moving so the picture could see the clock.
“Yes Ron. You were just saying that you want to study with me more about defence. So what do you want to learn?”
“Ron you weren’t invited. You need to leave.” Ron’s face went from bright and cheerful to dark and scary.
Hermione had been beyond understanding and told him he could come and study with her anytime he wanted. Mid afternoon rolled around when Hermione asked him about something other than runes.
“Draco.” He turned back to Narcissa. “Close your eyes. Do you feel it?” He nodded. “Where is it leading?” He opened his eyes.
The next meal, Hedwig landed right in front of Harry while Draco was at the other end of the table discussing some of the changes with Hermione and Neville. Draco turned to watch as Harry opened the letter he had written just this morning.
Surprisingly he felt much better a few seconds later. He hadn't expected it to do much for him, but it had worked a miracle in his eyes.
After saying that, Draco felt like he just signed his own heart away. But he knew without a single doubt that he made the right choice. Besides: Harry would never have the heart to do that-even under a spell's influence.
“Ah, ‘s no big deal. Well, I’m off. Got ter find some good trees for this year.” A large hand pulled Harry in for a hug and he grinned before saying his goodbyes and heading to Honeydukes to meet Draco.
"Why you terrible person! I will not lose my shape and I refuse to answer the second as I'm already dirt to society. I'm slightly offended. No, actually I'm really offended."
“Prat, you’ve always been enough for me.” He hadn’t thought twice about his words, until he felt Draco’s foot nudge his leg.
"I...Give me a minute to think. Okay? An hour, tops." Draco looked up, hope shining in his eyes and nodded, still in complete shock-so much so that he had no idea what to even think.
‘As it’s Friday and there are no classes tomorrow, I’m taking you out tonight.’ Inside was new dress robes. They were a dark emerald green and were lined with gold thread that seemed to sparkle and shimmer as the light reflected off it.
"Draco. I know this is a huge step for you. And I know that I've had a little apprehension about us, but I'm determined to do right by you and the child. Please, do me the wonderful pleasure, and marry me. Will you?"
He was cut off by a loud CRACK and an intense stinging on his cheek where Ron had backhanded him. He froze, shock coursing through his veins and suddenly he was very, very afraid of what Ron would do next.
The next few days were infuriating to Harry. All the teasing was driving him mad. It happened all the time now; during classes, at meals, in the morning, at night, both with people and when they were along. He didn’t know if he could take anymore without bursting.
"Harry, I must stop you. Firstly, you've done nothing but talk about Draco for the past five minutes and secondly you can't stop complimenting him. What's going on there?" To Harry's great embarrassment, he blushed.
"Shh it's okay the Healers told me that you might not be able to think too hard about anything as it's likely to cause a headache. You're okay." During the moment of silence, Draco saw everything that had happened in his mind. He suddenly sat up.
Harry spent more time on the stool than anyone else. The oddly silent hall was eerie in how quiet everyone was, but that was all washed to the back of his mind when the Sorting Hat started talking to him about the pros and cons of Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
He was bound and determined to show this man that he cared about the both of them. Draco would be the most spoiled pregnant person that ever lived. Harry would make sure of it personally. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's waist as he kept his steady pace, trying extremely hard not to speed up or finish too early. He wanted Draco to finish first.
Harry was rubbing his stomach in circular motions lovingly, caressing his baby-their baby. He had moved so his head was on Draco's thighs, facing him. His eyes were still closed, making the man appear asleep. And by the deep, even breathing, he was.
“Barely.” His throat was raw with pain, but he managed to force the tiny word out. He wasn’t willing to try to start asking questions just yet though.
Draco plopped himself down after tossing his robes aside, leaving Harry to gawk at his attire. He was clad in muggle jeans and a button down shirt in a champagne gold colour that made him look positively ethereal. Harry barely had time to shove his jaw back into place before Draco turned to him.
But first that involved Harry realizing that Ron was controlling him and breaking himself free of that toxicity safely.
"Well since this baby has one hundred percent your DNA, it's not a natural child. Please don't rip me now, and let me finish." Harry held his hand up, knowing full well that if he didn't get his point across all at once he'd have hell to pay with one angry mother...father? He'd rather poke a sleeping dragon in the eye with a spear.
