"Yes."
"Yes! Do it." Malfoy wriggled against his finger to emphasise his point. "It feels good."
Harry looked up, forgetting the lamps, his interest kindling. "The desert?"
"Mind your own business," Malfoy snarled, glaring at him.
Malfoy yawned and stretched. "Sleep okay?"
"You and Malfoy?" Hermione frowned. "How so?"
Malfoy gave a small smile, perhaps a little relieved. "Let me get you some linens."
It was perhaps three minutes before they heard it: the hallmark sound of a cart rattling down the tracks to their area of the vaults. Harry stiffened the instant he heard it in the distance and felt Malfoy's attention zero in on the sound like a magnet. Neither of them spoke. The cart came closer, revealing three occupants: a goblin and two men cloaked in black. One of them held a wand to the goblin's head. The cart stopped and the wand-wielder spoke, a stiff, hissing threat: "You will do as I say. You hold this cart right here, you don't make a move or a sound unless you're told, and you keep quiet after again. Like last time. You understand? Or else I come back and find you and you die slowly and very, very painfully. Got it?"
"Save it, Potter." Malfoy was still holding the flannel to his forehead. "I thought you were never going to wake up," he added irritably.
Malfoy gave him his best flirtatious look and pursed his lips. "In the flesh, darling, and it's Nicole for tonight."
It was a moronic thing to say and Malfoy rolled his eyes. "What does it look like, Potter?"
Harry, despite the unbelievable circumstances, could not help but snicker at this. "A monastery, Malfoy? I didn't think you were the religious type."
"I have several questions," Malfoy said at once. He began to rattle them off, Harry absorbing the questions and answers both as he scanned the auditorium, observing the groups and individuals poring over their parchments. Malfoy's instructions were explained: he was expected to disguise himself the same way for three straight weeks (the first week was a bonus to allow him to try out different things until he found something he thought he could maintain for that long a period), altering anything but his face. No facial glamours were allowed; they were considered too easy. Real Stealth, a senior Auror had explained in a seminar, was about the subtleties, changing things like your gait, your individual mannerisms, the ways you moved your face and arms, the pitch of your speaking voice. Spies had been caught over things as slight as facial tics or a distinctive manner of yawning. They had to practise things like changing their walks, their accents, even their sneezes. It was difficult, and Malfoy seemed to have particular difficulty shedding his own traits. Glamours were a tricky charm to cast. They required both a rather sophisticated level of magic as well as a large amount of focus and determination on the part of the caster to keep them up, especially over prolonged periods of time. The questions were winding down, Malfoy's last point of clarification being answered. Harry leaned forward to ask his one question.
Harry stood, too, and reached for his jacket. "I don't like it that you're not happy," he said.
Malfoy gave him a sharp look. "We might try escaping," he said. "Although we might also want to wait until one of us isn't going to slow down the entire procedure."
She looked amused. "Oh please, Potter. I've seen the way you look at him. When you're in the same room, you get so hot and bothered you can barely sit still. And as for what I know about it, let's just say that I hear you're a little quick on the draw. Draco generally needs it to last a little longer, you know? Trust me on that one."

"I don't know. He wouldn't say." Scorpius paused, then added defiantly, "That's when I stuck him up there."
"You tell yourself that," Malfoy said, muffled by his pillow. "Doesn't change the fact that you were hard because your cock was snuggled into my arse."
Harry almost said, "How would you know?" and bit it back, forgetting that that particular mean joke was one that Malfoy had probably not been in on, back when people still made jokes like that. No one even knew if it was true, but in the earlier days of the war, making jokes about Malfoy's virginity had once been quite popular amongst his friends. Harry caught himself just in time and was profoundly grateful that he hadn't actually said it. And suddenly rather curious to know the truth. "More crowded with two," Harry said instead.
Harry thought about it. "No," he said, defeated.
He got a cool look and Malfoy dropped the sarcastic banter. "It never came up in conversation before."
"Really?" Harry could all but hear Kingsley frowning. "How odd. That doesn't sound right."
He turned away and stripped to his boxers. Harry, feeling monumentally adolescent and worried about this whole thing, followed suit. Malfoy went to the left side of the bed and got in, leaving the right side to Harry. Harry joined him. Malfoy didn't move or say anything. The room was already dark, so there was no reason to even make small talk.
"I think they only go one way. So the question is, would it be shorter to follow the tracks, or to try to go back the way we came?" Malfoy turned away from him and peered into the distance.
"I'm so glad."
Dolohov made a sound of rebuke. "He will never know." His wand glinted in what little light shone into the alley. "And if he does, that's his own affair. Avada kedavra!"
"I know you didn't." Malfoy was still smirking, and when he turned it on Harry, the effect was horrifying. Harry felt himself trying to stutter for words, confused and embarrassed as hell. "Relax, Potter," Malfoy said, dropping the smirk. "Have a seat."
After a moment, Harry pulled himself to his feet. Malfoy got up and dusted himself off, glancing apprehensively toward the entrance to the alley. They were still alone. Relief. Harry felt a sort of gut-clenching misery knot in his belly in a way that had nothing to do with the enormity of his orgasm. Again. He'd done it again. He'd cheated on Ginny twice now. With Malfoy, of all people. And it had felt just as good, and he knew already that the next time he saw Malfoy, he would want it to happen again. He took a stumbling step away, pulling off his condensation-smeared glasses to clean on his robe and wondered what the hell he was supposed to do about this.
Nothing could have surprised him now. Not lying under his own bed with Malfoy beside him. Harry closed his eyes and uttered the spell that would open his flat to further attack.
"I love it," Harry said. He nodded toward Malfoy's half-full cup. "Don't you?"
He left.
"It would be nice if you would think of me, sometimes."

Malfoy took a long sip and Harry watched his mouth through the glass, his lips pressed to it as he drank, and averted his eyes as Malfoy set the tumbler back on the table. "So, Potter. Thoughts about all of that."
"Refrigeration unit?" Harry repeated, amused despite the circumstances. "Right. Fine. I guess Moody knows where I am, at least."
"Pretty normal one, I thought." Malfoy's eyes had narrowed to gleeful crescents.
"And when your wands stopped working? And nothing you attempted could penetrate my wards?"
"Is that what this is?" Malfoy asked, looking hard at Harry. "Friendship therapy?"
Draco thought. An idea occurred. "Do you really support the Cannons?"
It didn't lessen Harry's anger any. "They deserve to be," he said harshly. "After that - "
"What makes you think I want you to?" Harry threw back, trying to recover his dignity. "God, you're full of yourself!"
Potter took him by the back of his head and kissed him again, his mouth strong and sure, the fierce feeling growing unmistakeably stronger. Potter's hands were scrabbling at his trousers, unzipping them first, then finally getting the button. He pulled Draco's cock out and curled his hand around it, tight and warm. Assured. Experienced. Draco felt a stab of jealousy, but it was secondary to everything else he was feeling at the moment. When he could breathe again, he got Potter's trousers out of the way, his fingers pulling Potter's stiff cock out. It was an angry dark red and jutted out in demanding fashion, all but ordering Draco aloud to touch it. He stroked it, relishing just how hard Potter was, watched it grow subtly even larger in his palm. God. He swallowed and met Potter's intense gaze. A second later, their mouths came together violently again, and Draco didn't know when he'd last felt as good. Potter knew exactly what he was doing; that little jerk he gave with his wrist at the end of every pull was sheer genius. Oh, to see him wank! Potter's teeth dug into his lower lip and Draco bit and licked at his mouth, his tongue, humping Potter's hand wildly. Potter's hips snapped forward, his cock pulsing in Draco's fist. Draco began to jerk Potter's cock rapidly. It was slippery with precome and Potter made an agonised sound, panting against his neck. One of his arms was clamped around Draco's shoulders and the other was pumping furiously at Draco's cock and it was heaven. He was going to come, but he wanted to prolong this for as long as possible. Potter moved the arm holding him down to his thigh, back up to thumb Draco's protruding nipple, then to his face in a fiercely tender gesture. It was overwhelming. Draco could feel Potter's orgasm building - even his magic was sparking and prickling, as though something in the room might just explode along with Potter's cock when the time came.
Draco waved back, smiling wryly, and turned to Dumbledore. "Now we go down," Dumbledore said. Draco saw Potter watching through the frame and nodded at him, silently trying to reassure him, despite not having anything to base any sort of reassurance upon.
"And me," Harry said. "I guess that pretty much settles it, that Ginny and I are finished, regardless of Malfoy. But the kids - I can't lose them. I don't want to relegate them to only seeing me on alternate weekends or whatever. They're little. I want to have them around. I want to be in their lives."
Draco was walking down for lunch, too conscious for his own comfort that he was about to see Potter. Potter hadn't made any direct reference to the previous night, but he'd been easygoing, if focused on the case. Dumbledore's report had been negative, to Potter's frustration. They were going to check in again after lunch.
"Yes, I mind," Harry said.
Malfoy fidgeted, refusing to look him in the eye. "Potter, you're… not as big a git as I thought you were, but you still aren't exactly what I had in mind. I… sorry. I don't want to talk about this any more. The rest of them will be done with the pantry right away and someone will come up. Let's just forget about this."
"War," Harry reminded him. "And it doesn't matter. I'm sure you'll figure it out; it's not hard. Well. This is." He pulled his wrist from Malfoy's unresisting grasp and curled his fingers around Malfoy's cock. "Just play it by ear. I'm not going to criticise or anything, promise."
"It doesn't - "
"Yes," Malfoy said, slowly. "Technically. In the sense that all magical currency is traceable. In order to trace it, you need the access codes for the particular deposit, and you need to get it before the money leaves the vault."
Harry felt heat colour his cheeks. "Maybe there is a connection now," he said, hardly paying attention to a word he was saying. His problem was getting worse, not better, with all this talk of wands. And what the hell was that about?! The strange warmth had done something to him. Something horrible, even if it had felt rather nice.
"Yes," Potter said slowly. "I've… been invited to something at the Ministry."
Potter pulled away after several disgustingly wonderful minutes of this (ten? Twenty? Draco had no idea) and gave him a rather penetrating look. "I can't believe I got it so wrong."
"Whatever you want," Malfoy replied, also carefully. "I can put the glamour back on, if you'd rather. I'm not sure if it will stay, but I can try."
"You're insatiable." Malfoy squirted a little of it out and began to rub it over Harry's cock, which felt amazing and got him fully hard within seconds. "Was that your way of asking if you can fuck me again?"
* * *
"Hmm?" Harry carefully wrote in THESTRAL for one hundred fourteen down.
Potter interrupted him, kissing him again. Draco couldn't help it; he responded as eagerly as he had before and it went on for ages. He hoped that whatever Potter had muttered had been a Disillusionment, because they were in the middle of Diagon Alley, even if they were behind the pub, in broad daylight. Finally, Potter spoke again. "I need this," he said, opening his eyes. "I've wanted it for so long. I didn't want to, but I can't help it. I've suppressed it for so long. I don't know why you. I don't know why you, when you're the last person I would ever think I could feel - that I could want to be with like this. But I do. Don't tell me you don't want it. I know you're lying. You've wanted me for just as long."
"Precisely." Dolohov did not flinch, looking Harry in the eye, though his body was trembling in the early signs of shock.
"You have no right to just walk in here like that!" Harry said angrily, trying to overcome his shame enough to turn the tables on Malfoy.
Draco took the invitation and thought of Pansy's inevitable envy. His smugness lasted only until he realised he would likely be expected to bring a date, and… well. The Minister's Ball was highly exclusive, and he wasn't exactly a member of London's high society these days. Potter had been invited? The bastard. Of course he had been. He took the invitation. "Thank you," he said stiffly.
He coughed. "Sorry."
I need Harry Potter's personal email address, if possible.
"Yesterday," Harry said. "You said that maybe if I got a new wand, I could kill Voldemort."
Draco shrugged, but couldn't look away. Why was he somehow nervous? "I'm one person," he said. "You left four. You compromised your friendships and extended family. And your kids, whether I ever wanted to admit that or not."
Kingsley followed his look. "Part of what Draco does, and you understand that this is strictly confidential of course, has to do with the Ministry's finances, as well as those of the wizarding world in general, including some degree of affiliation with Gringotts."
Potter was sweating lightly, his forehead damp, the curls tightening. He'd taken his glasses off and his eyes were even larger than they had been. He caught Draco's eye and smiled, still thrusting into him. Draco smiled back, and then Potter smiled for real. "I've wanted this for a long time," he admitted, despite the need straining his voice.
Harry was startled by the anger, and the pain in his skull dulled his thoughts and prevented him from coming up with a pithy retort. He said nothing; his head was throbbing.
"Your file," Harry said, fighting to keep himself patient. "In the drawing room, please." He turned and went back the way he'd come without a backward glance.
"Oh, sure. I've only got every potion the Ministry needs for the week brewing, and I'm slicing Krumm snouts even as we speak."
Harry looked down between them, watched his hand rub slowly over it, feeling the shape against his palm, then watched as both hands were unbuttoning those jeans of their own volition and working the zip down around an increasingly interfering bulge.
"Do you have any idea how many wards this flat has?"
Harry looked at him, not sure how to respond. "Really."
Perhaps his decision had been made. He went down to the clerical end of the Department and requested an owl.
"He had to. He was drinking when I got there," Harry said. "He didn't say why or anything, but I definitely got the impression that he's not very happy. In retrospect, he was actually more gracious about the whole thing than I expected him to be. I mean, I wasn't really expecting him to even come out."
* * *
"Wasn't that the infirmary before?"
Malfoy peered at it. "Fuck, Potter. That's a little too close for comfort."
Harry was confused. "It sounds like I'm just supposed to be your back-up," he said to Malfoy, who was still frowning at his parchment. "What're you supposed to be disguised as?"
* * *
"Okay," Harry said. He wasn't sure that he could handle Malfoy as a male for this.
As it turned out, Ginny's complaint had proven irrelevant: the hospital to which the three of them had been assigned was in Edinburgh, and as Harry was stationed in London with Malfoy, hanging out was not going to be an option. Hermione wasn't sure what their hours would be, or couldn't discuss it (which was the more likely case), so Harry left it. If Ginny seemed annoyed that Harry wasn't more broken up about not seeing each other for a month, Hermione and Ron paid it no mind. Cheery goodbyes were said, and that was that.
Feeling only a little apprehensive, Draco finished his latte and tossed the paper cup into a rubbish bin before stepping into an alley beside the Ministry building to Apparate into the foyer. It had been so long since he had been so very well-rested that it was difficult to worry too much about the meeting. He was uneasy, though. It was strictly forbidden to discuss the contents of the character testing, as each test was individualised to pinpoint the character flaws of each trainee. Draco rode the lift in silence, noting to himself that the orange pinstriped robes of the wizard sharing the lift with him were quite ridiculously ugly. He'd had a little too much wine the night before, which had mellowed him considerably but left a slight, dull headache in its wake. Dehydration, his favourite. Draco exited the lift and strode down the corridor to the Auror Department. He wasn't nervous. Just apprehensive. Anyone would be.
The three exchanged looks. "Not sure," Seamus said grimly. "Hoping the infirmary. He'll need it."
Harry pulled the discs Dudley had given him out of a jacket pocket, as well as the USB key that he had returned to Harry. "I got this last night. He couldn't figure out how to get it onto the USB, so he copied it onto CDs."
The chatter around the hall suddenly died down as the door opened. Shacklebolt, Williamson, and Dawlish all came in. Shacklebolt, first acting and now current Minister for Magic, still took a personal hand in the Ministry's training programs, particularly the Auror stream. Williamson was the head of Year One studies, and Dawlish was the student-faculty liaison. Williamson was followed by his personal assistant, a junior Auror by the unlikely name of Twitterbog, who was carrying a large basket of scrolls. Williamson pointed his wand at his throat, stepped to the front and center of the auditorium, and cleared his throat.
"Hello, Malfoy."
"He said I'd be sorry," Albus said. His eyes went to Draco's again. "He said he'd let his friends into the castle if I did that."
"The Apparition worked! Wonderful! All the best to you, my dear young man!"
Something clicked and Potter opened it, looking enraged. "What?" he demanded. "I'm trying to work here, Malfoy!"
The silence was content, almost free of tension, and Draco admitted to himself that it had been harder than he had expected to do it that way. They rode across London that way, each lost in his own thoughts but completely aware of the other. They were nearly back when Draco said, abruptly, "When we first got together, I told you that I wished I could promise you that it would be worth it, leaving all of that behind, but that I couldn't promise anything."
"I know," James said with a slight smile. "I work in this department. Potions expert. Not sure if we've actually met before, but I know who you are, of course."
"No problem," Dudley said, scratching the back of his neck with a ham-like hand. "What's up?"
"There's no 'but'. I want to be with you," Harry said firmly.
"If this is where he sent you," Malfoy said. "I was trying to get to Grimmauld Place. I guess the wards were already off or something."
Her eyebrows rose. "Good thing I'll be home, then."
"Right," Harry said. "That clarifies everything."
"Good." Malfoy's eyes drifted again.
"How's it going?"
It was a very good way. Potter looked around and asked where the bedroom was. Draco pointed it out with a jerk of his chin as his mouth was full of Potter's fingers at the moment, and then they were stumbling there. His lube was in Potter's hand before they got to the doorway and then he was being gently pushed down onto the bed. Potter was climbing onto him, legs warring with Draco's in their mutual need to get their cocks touching again, to get closer still. The lube was between their hands, fingers touching and fumbling together with the cap. Potter spilled a generous amount of it into his palm, and Draco had a hazy moment of thinking that generous was the perfect word for Potter right now. Every stroke, every press of his mouth, even the way he kissed was like a small, individually wrapped gift from Potter and while it might have bothered his pride normally, at the moment Draco wanted nothing so much as to open all of them at once. He could take this from Potter. He could accept this generosity. He gasped as Potter's fingers entered him, tongue flattening against his right nipple at the same time. Potter's tongue worked down his torso, swiped over a ball and then sucked Draco's cock halfway down his throat. Draco was moaning without shame, without trying to prevent himself. He was normally very reserved in sex, all about maintaining façade, but Potter wasn't fooled by façade, and it felt far too good to just let go and revel in it for once. His hips tried to buck upward, craving still more depth in Potter's wonderfully hot mouth, but Potter held him in place, mouth sliding over Draco, tongue pressing. Potter still had fingers in his arse and they were moving in and out in time with his mouth. For a man who had spent roughly twenty years married to a woman, he sure knew how to give a blow job, Draco thought, though the thought was barely coherent in the blinding wave of pleasure swelling, about to overtake him. His back arched, the pleasure spiking through him so roughly that he couldn't breathe, his cry catching in his throat. It was the only warning his could give before he was coming and coming down Potter's throat, nearing losing consciousness as white bloomed like fire behind his eyes. Then breath rushed back and the cry tore from his throat, fingers clenched in Potter's hair, Potter's nose buried in the blond curls at the base of his cock.
“Like an Impervious?” Scorpius snorted, “Could I get Albus to--”
“It was a fun day.” Even his mother bid him a farewell once it dawned on their families it was going ahead, their permission unneeded and unwanted. He and Astoria had found themselves alone, but together. Thinking back, Harry and Ginny seemed to have issues. Instead outright asking, Draco said, “I imagine your wedding day was the total opposite.”
“Malfoy.” Ginny didn’t open it wide enough for Draco to see if Lily was inside or not. He’d prefer having this chat without anyone around.
“I thought you might be Aurors...” He was sheepish and seemed uncomfortable for a second before returning into the room he’d came from. Draco followed, he hadn’t been thrown out told to stay back or wait.
He sulked and hugged tighter, still trying to work out if it was possible to apparate without bringing along the person physically attached. His head ached from the crying and his eyes were too warm and his face puffy. He refused to let go or return to a non-hugging state which might involve having the potential awkward post-hugging-crying moment. No, Draco was fine just here. Perfectly capable of never looking at Harry in the eyes again because once again - again, bloody well again - he’d been caught out. Caught being emotional and oh that wasn’t -- wasn’t cool or charming or whatever bloody thing Draco liked to think others thought of him.
“Mr. Mallory?” Draco froze. Turned to see if the little Muggle was talking to him. Him? She was talking to him? She couldn’t possibly-- The horror, the humiliation, it was like being back in the train having some people laugh at his name. A name written on the heavens and they dared make fun of it. Except no one knew the grand mistake dealt.
Draco fled to his laboratory and set up eight cauldrons. Nothing interrupted him, not even Lotty and her usual questions of tea or a light meal. No news was best, Draco set aside several figs of lavender before opting to chop them in different ways. He may as well try a little of everything. Ignore the idea Potter would die. Ignore the possibility he was a squib because that still left him needing a potion.
The Potters were a very odd family, Draco decided then. James and Albus were night and day, in attitude and intelligence. While James was more outspoken, Albus held a quiet confidence and it was strange Harry could compel and convince them both to do what he asked. Even with him being ill enough to potentially hurt them.
Ginny appeared holding a cardboard box. They stared at each other in a silence (Potter in disbelief and Ginny like she’d been caught) which Draco didn’t interrupt even by moving.
Harry’s eyebrows tried to escape his face as Draco apparated them away. “Wow. Albus wasn’t kidding when he said you have your own stadium. How much did this even cost? And why the stands? You get that many spectators? This might be bigger than the place at the World Cup.”
So, what was he to do? How was he supposed to settle opposing knowledge like this?
Thanks for reading!
Back around the table and again, it was Neville’s turn. He had nursed the same glass of beer for the whole night. He’d refused the other turns, any attempt to get involved and Draco wondered if he’d burned another bridge. Another sip of FireWhiskey and Neville forced out a sigh, he seemed to be arguing with himself going by the frown. Once this one was done, Draco could make a start on the next one - a round bought by Ginny.
Wrong, that’s what this was. To have wore the ring of his dead wife while he kissed someone who had tried to kill him and ultimately saved him. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Draco clenched his hand around it, tight and he heard it snap, the teeth exposed and waiting. Actions weren’t the key to causing it.
“The only thing louder was when everyone ended up trying to out drink each other.”
“I thought you thought crups were the coolest?”
“He’s truly abysmal but how dare you?” Draco scoffed, let go and continued, “have you seen the Cannons?”
Thwump.
Cheers for reading and anyone who gave a kudos/bookmark. Much love to you!
He needs to wake up, and he needs to get out of here.
All of that for this little piece of jewellery. He turns back to Albus, helping him sit up and drink some water. The effects of the poison are more mental than physical, he knows that much. And while he’d wondered why the Dark Lord would request such a thing when he could just as easily use a cruciatus, now he knows.
'Harry!'
"But you're not friends," Harry says, his mouth downturned and his eyes sort of pitying. Draco doesn’t care. He doesn't.
He remembers how his breath had caught in his chest like a caged bird. How his body had trembled and his heart skipped a beat and his head had gushed out blood.
Draco shrugs, noticing Harry looking at his face. Then he looks away, uncomfortable.
"I'm…" Harry purses his lips, "I'm going to boil your fucking eyeballs."
He gulps and looks around their cell. He cannot panic. He's not even sure whether he should. He has no idea what's going with Potter. What he does know, is that the boy is in no immediate danger, even though he's not answering to any natural instinctive reflexes, that he feels
He knows when she's watching him. It's a curious little thing, the weight of her gaze on the back of his neck, prickling small hairs and sending involuntary shivers down his spine.
Draco isn't as amused as he thought he would be. He's intrigued, once again, by Harry's reactions. He hadn't looked bitter in the slightest these past few days, in spite of the worsening macabres that life kept throwing at him. He even seemed somewhat bright at times. This bitterness seems only reserved for Severus. It even sounds righteous.
This chapter happens somewhere between chapter 14 and chapter 15 of MSS.
Ron, who is sitting next to her, nods, "For anyone who hasn't gotten the memo yet, we hate Umbridge, we want to pass the exams and also not die. This isn't a resistance band, it's a glorified study group.” He looks around, meeting as many eyes as possible, “Any questions?"
This all will also highlight how different Draco interacts with Harry compared to Ron and Hermione, even if it doesn't diminish their love for him.
"I was just his student, headmistress."
Draco rolls his eyes again and softly shifts Harry's body sideways with his own. Harry takes that as confirmation.
"Nothing,” Harry quickly says, “But keep calling me that. I like it...cranberry sauce?"
"Of course there is,” Severus scoffs, he looks a bit offended, “Always remember, Potter, the best poisons are those with antidotes, the worst are the ones without."
Wallwind nods, slowly, letting his curly hair subtly shift around his head. "Strong words with meaningful intent, Minister Fudge. This interview was a pleasure," he stands to shake the man's sugar powdered hands.
They nod, looking miserable but somewhat hopeful at once.
"They're more or less alone, mentorless, and pretty antsy, so you know, I naturally agreed--"
She flinches at the name hard enough that her teacup rattles, sloshing the smallest amount of tea on her saucer. Umbridge's eyes narrow. "We are not speaking of his involvement. Black had a very distinguished role in getting your parents killed, wouldn't you say?"
"How much did you hear? Do we need to bring out Obliviators?"
"Your blood," Severus says, "It's not as thick as it should be. This must have caused the bleeding along with a severe lack of platelets to clot your blood. I know what this is."
"I found it
the scathing remark, almost certainly something idiotic, forming in his head, so Severus cuts him off. "I have taught you for over four years now, Potter. I dealt with other teenagers for longer. So out with it already."
"No, tell me. What were you gonna say?"
Harry also has pretty serious self image issues regarding being viewed as normal, and while Ron and Hermione have created a 'system' around Harry, they knew that maintaining said system, whilst also trying not to make Harry aware of it, Is not an easy thing to do, and in the moment, their frustration got the better of them.
'Too much of things means there's less of other things,' Harry had told him before, and Draco couldn't understand. He's starting to understand now.

They look quite normal, if not a bit tense. And maybe also a bit pale, but that could easily be the rainy weather.
Draco touches the hem of the coat. It's thick, it looks warm and it's dry. It would keep Harry warm. And the shirt… Draco's was ruined.
Draco, despite his simmering rage, is quite content to leave Potter to have his laugh over him, this is entirely his loss, Draco loses nothing by Potter bleeding to death in an abandoned corner, in fact, it might even help his cause by alleviating the pressure of housing the dark lord in his home.
A sunny thank you to our wonderful beta! (Happy belated birthday, dude XD) and Happy reading!
"I'm sorry about the Dursleys," he blurts out.
Well, seeing Draco would be the last of his worries.
He was counting on that. On fulfilling the last thing his Narcissa has asked of him.
"I'm sure, whatever he feels, I don't want to go back to that game again. I want to let myself feel, for once. I think I'm done not facing the world," his eyes prickle a little.
Harry avoids his gaze, then opens the matchbox. "You could… lean your back to me. It'll be easier that way."
“It seems like I’m not the only one.” Harry folds his arms, his wand clutched in his uninjured hand.
Harry just shakes his head, his knuckles are white as he grips at himself. Still shaking. Draco stares down at his mother’s wand and then glances back at Potter’s on the stool. Slowly, he reaches back to retrieve the unfamiliar wand.
"Just a reminder," Harry breathes, "We don't have a space for wasting in our budget. They're not just gonna--"
Draco shakes his head, “I’m fine."
Harry takes a step back, startled, "What?"
Draco already doesn’t look like his best, and Harry doesn’t want to worry him by having a  meltdown worthy of a lunatic. ‘It’s not about the rooftop, there’s something wrong with
Harry points at the one on his left shoulder, then the one on his lap, and then the various others around him, rattling off, “Larry, Frederick, Lester, Gill and Kats.”
"What's that?"
The feeling is foreign to him, almost, the only instances of his scar hurting had been during his first year, during his entanglement with Quirrel and the Philosopher's stone, and even then the pain hadn't reached this intensity when Voldemort had touched him through Quirrel's body, that was mild, compared to that
But he’s smiling, he knows what Ron means, it remains unspoken, but they both know.
Kingsley passes them and dodges a low hanging paper plane before ducking into the cramped elevator, the golden gates closing the chaos before his eyes.
"I cannot! It felt good. I was exhilarated by their pain, I liked it when Mrs. Malfoy screamed, I made Rosier cry like a baby, I choked him with my foot! There's something wrong with me, because I thought they weren't real, I thought they were twisted dreams, but they aren't. Every second of it is true. Bellatrix killed her sister and I killed Draco's dad. I killed his dad and I was just making us dinner as if nothing had happened!"
"Why don't Ron and Hermione show you to your room?" she says and then raises her voice. "You're bunking with Ron, and Nymphadora kindly deposited your trunk there already." she squeezes his shoulders and Harry nods, feeling mildly guilty that he's upsetting her.
"I'll keep that in mind," Harry turns to leave but hears Moody still grumbling behind him.
Harry tells him that they can't walk on the road anymore. They have to stick to the sides.
"Look again," The comment is accompanied by a small smile and Harry turns back to the houses, his brows knitting as he sees the breaks between building 11 and 13 starting to rearrange themselves as if trying to dig their way out of the infused line that separates the two buildings. Harry watches with an awed smile, discontented on the behalf of the muggles occupying the other houses.
"Sorry about that."
"Great," Harry nods, relaxing back again. After a few moments, he speaks up again, a strange tilt to his voice. "I need to tell you something."
“Draco,” Harry whispers, and his gaze is boring into Draco’s. The way it does, sometimes. As if he’s seeing right into him. He wants to bury his face into Harry’s neck and sob. Wonders if Harry will allow it or push him away because Draco’s getting too intimate.
"Yes, we know," Tonks cuts him off and then smiles at Harry. "Wotcher Harry," she says with a small smile, and Harry hesitantly nods back at her.
"Did you pack dittany?"
"Well I'm sure you don't need me to hand feed the meaning to you, lad," he says, after a meaningful pause.
"Yes sir." Williams scrambles to his feet, fixes his glasses to dive into the piles.
"What about the pain relievers? Are they burning out faster than usual as well? A typical dose can last about five hours," Severus asks.
And then he recognises the silver mask and the tall build and the broad set of shoulders.
"It's not just about that."
He's really tired.
“Make me proud, Draco. You are a Malfoy. I will never expect anything less of you.”
"And the grand chief of warlocks," Kingsley cuts in.
Severus can't breathe.
"I don't mind," Harry hastily replies, closing the tap and drowning half of his glass in one long gulp. Then he fills it again.
"I need to examine your wounds Draco," he says. "I brought some balms that might help with the scarring, two disinfectants, and a skin grafter, you know how it works."
Harry starts walking and they flap around him, some settling back on his shoulders and head, while another lands on his shaking arm.
Potter doesn’t say anything as Draco takes his hand out of the now murky liquid. At the first touch of the gauze against his cuts, he hisses a little, and Draco makes sure his next movements are slower and gentler. Not much, though. He doesn’t care as long as Potter stays alive, after all.
The last but in no way the least important one, was that Harry, according to an enraged imaginary Sirius, standing in the corner, and shouting abuse, is a natural born killer. And that killing Bellatrix, in the grand scheme of things would really benefit the war effort and lessen his suffering. Harry has no breath left to argue with his violent imaginations, and he’s frankly too gone to respond with any ounce of decorum. So he doesn’t. He keeps screaming because if he doesn’t, if he shuts off that one last outlet then he’s sure that he’ll lose it.
“Twinky,” Harry repeats, then, apparently satisfied, goes back to nibbling on his sandwich. Draco tries not thinking about the fact that the elf had already uttered her name at least twice while rambling. Harry is exhausted, he gets a leeway.
"Why are you talking as if I should be in pain?"
"Fuck you!" Harry grits out, he can't breathe and everything is so blurry.
"Do you like it? The sea, I mean," he says after a moment, tearing his eyes away from it.
“You didn’t force me into helping me. We both know how ridiculous that sounds. You helped me because I let you. And we’re here because I didn’t end it when I was meant to do so,”
"Do help yourself to some scones," The man says, his plump face testimony of how tasty said scones are supposed to be. John politely shakes his head and takes out his parchment from his dragon-leather messenger bag. It was a gift from Anna for their tenth year anniversary and John hadn't stopped using it since.
“Cannot do anything right, and I know from experience. Potter’s muggle relatives for instance,” there’s a crunching against gravel as Rosier steps closer to them. “Or rather two slabs of fat and a sack of bones, wriggling little creatures didn’t even have time to open their gobs before I blew them up. Do you hear that Potter? How does that make you feel?”
His heart settles only for a bit.
“Draco?” the boy mumbles, still irrationally hot to touch, and flushed in the face. Harry tries once more but the response is much about the same.
in terror, blubbering, sobbing as Nagini drops her weight down on his legs, locking him down.
"It's nothing," he snaps.
"I don't want my vermin to perish under typical curses. No…" Rosier grabs Harry's hair, yanking his head up, "You deserve this. I'm going to watch you torture yourself to death, and it will be beautiful."
He squeezes Draco's hand, "He'll hear us if we wrangle one out of the package now. But just… go in there, be loud and distracting. I'll get us the water. Then get out okay?"
"You and Moody?"
The older the better was usually the rule.
"We can use the cup," he says, as he carefully splits the muffin in two, he keeps the part with the wrapper, the side that touched the transfer for himself, and hands Draco the top part.
from the cell and… that's all he has.
The sight isn’t a pretty one, Harry is sure of it.
as something more than he could ever be.
"Oh, if only mom knew," Bill laughs and then leans back in his seat. "You don't have to be in such a hurry, it's not like we're gonna kill you or anything,"
"I was the one who faced him," his voice is lower this time, he's tired of shouting. "I was there when he killed Cedric. When he tortured me, and I was the one who had to duel him and take the
Maybe not.
Today was already a shitty day.
The aftermath resulted in too many marks against his skin. Sated and nerves of the day gone, Draco eyed Harry’s shoulderblades - a series of red and white lines littered them - he couldn’t say he wasn’t a touch proud of the mess.
Trainee Auror and Head Auror at the time. Though the idea of a Trainee Auror – a trainee elite was absurd as it was necessary going by how the Head Auror hovered around him. Why these two were with Potter was never stated. The three of them stood outside a lop-sided home with peeling yellow paint which sat upon a hill overlooking more homes and a river that looked brown. An abandoned trolley jutted from the middle.
But what had he said?
“You made me wait. A long time.” Harry shuffled forward, awkward and unsure again. Draco would never believe Harry ever found him imposing or intimidating. This might be close. This might be the closest Draco would ever see Harry hesitant.
“Ronald, now isn’t the time,” Hermione snapped and grabbed Ron’s hand and clasped it between hers and Harry’s. Draco left, not wishing to see anyone else as uncomfortable over the mess he made.
Now, he pushed back against the wall because he wasn’t sure he could stay standing on his own. Calm down. His slow breath went quicker or deeper and Draco couldn’t tell what was wrong just he was now hyper-aware of how wrong his breathing was.
Eventually, the tawny landed. The box clattering on the windowsill of a house, isolated and barely kept. Draco followed, standing and waiting for the letter Luna wrote to be received. He was not expecting Gregory Goyle to be the man behind a desk, writing the same letter over and over. Disgust blossomed under his feathers. Draco wanted to rip the man’s throat out.
Theodore Nott was the reverse. Draco might punch the fool.
“It’s not me. I don’t want to. It’s not.” Harry took a shaking, upsetting breath, “I think about how I could hurt someone and I’d get away with it. I’m Harry Potter, everyone should be grateful to me. I’m the Master of Death, everyone--” Draco knew most people boasted, exaggerated but that ‘Master of Death,’ what a thing to think, “--everyone should just do what I say. I hear it, I hear how they think I’m just perfect and I hate it. I hate it. I hate them all.” Draco listened to his rambling and also, its inconsistencies, a clear indication Harry Potter was both warring against itself and how the blood was changing him.
“Could I kiss you?”
“What’s this all about?” Harry looked between them, a smug Neville was unusual as he slid into his seat.
“Secondary school. He followed me about with his little cloak, Longbottom.” Neville frowned, like he hadn’t a clue what he was talking about. Like he didn’t remember when Draco stamped on Harry’s face like that mad hippogriff had tried on him. Like Harry never spoke about it and made himself out to be the victim in his creepy invisibleness sneaking around looking at him.
And then Draco Malfoy was discharged and Harry bid them goodbye to search for the rings in Scorpius’ stead. Meanwhile his son seemed eager to stay here and keep Draco at the hospital.
“Draco.” Turning around to see Harry might have had the greeting returned if Harry wasn’t glaring at him like he’d just robbed Gringotts. “Did you ever say to Mary I told you to interrogate her?”
Draco twirled a Galleon between his fingers. Appointments with the Mind-Healer were unusual. Most of his young life he reported back on achievements to his parents – who praised him endlessly. Reporting to Matthews came with a mixture of emotion too. Was what he had done good? Poor?
“Actually, I may need your help with something.”
Scorpius had brightened considerably and Draco felt soothed by it. Distressing him was never a point in the plan. Why hadn’t the Manor done what he had asked of it? Perhaps those who attacked were smarter than the average thug. Draco would need to deal with this now. If the Manor’s magics were deteriorating then the Artefacts wouldn’t be secure for long.
“Maybe but just one won’t do anything.” Siobhan rotated the spine. “This can be used as a substitute for needle soup. The other two do have the properties for a salve.” She shook her head again and sighed, “I’m sorry, we’d need more than this.”
“What?” Scandalised didn’t cut the look on Potter’s face.
“What did he say? Harry?” Ginny was in hysterics, laughter louder than anyone else. Most were laughing, minus Luna and... Wait. Where was Neville? He caught the man’s back only to see him leave. Bugger. He hadn’t been focussed to hear him say goodbye.
“What’ve I done?” Scandalized and worried over the offence of a house-elf, hilarious, really that the Saviour of the Wizarding World was so terribly humble for all the wrong reasons.
And the world stopped. At least it felt as if Draco’s energy was zapped and his thoughts stolen as he watched the Manor and the spilling magic argue. Malfoy Manor loathed magic by others and for it to be commanded by someone other than a Malfoy, it crushed at Draco’s skull. Now, all that buzzed in the air was magic, and Potter appearing to try to sort it out in a rather - pathetic manner - that had Draco sigh. He was hopeless. A worried, hopeless idiot that didn’t know what was going on.
He settled after a few minutes, when he concentrated on Harry being there, not on himself.
For a while, Draco considered he’d messed up as he got another pet around the facial disk that surrounded his face, crowned brown and black. Had he forgotten to factor something in which might change or alter Harry’s perception of what Draco was doing? Did he find this too weird? Harry was not raised in a world of magic and his knowledge about old practises were nonexistent at best.
“What?”
“Hermione’s trying to make a subsidiary account for those who are from muggleborn families, of course purebloods see this as a handout opposed to their ideals they aren’t worth the galleons.” Draco considered himself a target by Deatheaters but truly it was the politically charged fools who thought to try and coerce him into another life of poor choices to hoard power. He might end up richer but Malfoys didn’t need any extra Knuts in their Vaults either. “It’s in a few days.”
“I won’t take any chances, I like my fingers,” Collin said, curling his fingers into his palm. It made Draco laugh in long drawn out hoots.
Oh. For the love of all that is Magical. Draco sneered, “If I have to spell it out for you, I’ll throw myself off this partition.”
“The birds that can fly? Or do you mean tell me this thing can fly too?”
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, a touch of embarrassment colouring his neck. Being well, with Potter was an idea always challenged by reality. For one, Draco assumed after having a time away from affection meant Harry’d be starved and eager for whatever Draco threw his way. Astoria was like that, Pansy had been like that.
Doubletaking, Draco was about to shush Harry about seeing what the Manor pushed at him. How would Blaise even know her? That she was staying here (and by extension did he then know Harry was staying here?) What kind of leap was-- Blaise’s anger fizzled out replaced with him puffing out his shoulders, confused but guarded.
Five minutes - the longest, slowest five minutes to ever exist in time and space. Five minutes of hearing the wheezing laboured breaths and Harry failing to keep his eyes open for longer than a few seconds each time.
“What did they argue about?”
“Slow down.”
“I’m going to walk up the stairs.” Harry spoke in the manner he always did. Confident, so self-assured Draco was expecting him to march, healed and have no trouble. What he got was a shaking-limbed man, much that reminded Draco of a newborn owl which couldn’t stand, but flailed their wings and fell over unable to hold their own weight.
They bickered, though Harry’s face morphed and changed and Draco was no longer arguing with Harry Potter but just some random guy in the middle of the hall. And he jumped again when Harry was again, there. This time he was laughing, a vague familiarity how he doubled over, he spoke but Draco was fine with this. Until the vile magic from before dug at his old scars and--
Sleep was a precious commodity, it wasn’t like missing a few hours back when he was teen or in his twenties. How Harry functioned without a peaceful night was a mystery. Another look over to Harry, who was near sleeping against the wall again. Perhaps, Harry was having a worse night than Draco was. No point for both of them to lose out.
“Ginny and you are keeping your separation quiet for Lily, yes?” Harry probably didn’t expect Draco’s collected, some might say even cold response. “Are you expecting me to be a secret? Or wait around for years to come?” The more he said, the more he scowled and with writhing worms in his gut every second was more and more uncomfortable. He wanted answers but Draco wasn’t keen to hear what he assumed right.
“A year?” The words strangled him and he wiped at his forehead with a sleeve. “It was Pansy’s party. Malfoy would have followed this year but--” But things happened and Draco would not host this one this year regardless.
“We both know that’s not the magic I’m talking about. It hurt--”
“Dad!”
Harry had followed, quiet, and that was unsettling. So, Draco edged away from the watchful eyes of an Auror with more than a decades experience and hid under the half-desk. Potter wouldn’t figure this out. He shouldn’t figure this out. Draco wouldn’t hear the end of this.
“I wouldn’t touch one of these – these – rats of the sky.”
He watched again, to make sure it did not germinate before clawing the earth back to sit on top, but his good mood flagged, “If he did, he didn’t do a very good job.” Draco rested the back of his hand on his forehead. Acting like it was a friend playing Healer was easier than admit Blaise was doing anything illegal. But Harry seemed to straighten, as if Draco was going to collapse there and then and Draco couldn’t stand it.
The magic didn’t even take more than a second to surround Draco and for him to notice it was just that - wrong. The healing spell set off waves of breath-interrupting, just-screaming torture. Owl or not, Slytherin or not, Draco dived under the couch with a sound he was sure he’d never make again.
"Thanks."
Close behind him Seamus yelled, “You bastards!” Before Neville grabbed hold of him and pushed him out too. Luna reappeared and Draco couldn’t tell when she’d left.
Why? What possible-- That’s when he remembered, when another piece slotted itself into the puzzle. Auror work was what caused Harry’s sleeping problem which caused the potion problem which caused the magic problem.
All together now: Poor Harry. =( He so needs a hug. And the Manor too. That needs therapy.
If Harry were to wait for a few more seconds, he probably would have seen how Draco was yawning again. How he slept again and how Draco couldn’t think of a reason to leave this bed.
Harry made an attempt to open his eyes but didn’t get very far, “I thought you said you could make the Sleeping Draught?”
He never meant it, had any control over his magic when asleep. But Draco shook his head as Harry approached him. Held onto Draco’s arms as if he’d fall if he didn’t.
“The Weasley that works with dragons? So, maybe dragonblood.” Dragonblood was powerful. More than too much for a simple Sleeping Draught. Charlie must be decent at brewing but not interested in potions enough to know the drawbacks of using different ratios of ingredients. Harry stared as Draco drank some freshly made tea.
“I’ll see to our guests,” his mother had said, as if she were sweetly going to check on friends. Draco saw how displeased his father was but to not hear anything of it just yet. He wasn’t sure what could be going on. When Scorpius and Draco stood from their seat ready to meet the Potters again, Mother spoke without directing it towards anyone.
He’d thought Aurora was a girl’s name. Draco went back to dangling his legs from under the cloak, basking in his victory.
Evan rolls his eyes, "Run my mouth to the mice running in the walls?" His face hardens, "He's being paranoid."
Next update Saturday, 18th July.
"I'm sorry," Harry breathes and throws the bloodied shirt aside.
Harry reaches for it as Draco sits back on the hay, his knees are starting to hurt and how much filthier can he get? It's cold. And he's shirtless. He chews on his lips to keep his teeth from chattering.
Because it's cold, and the nerves in Harry's body perceive cold as pain now. Hot, stabbing pain.
Nott’s face clears, “Ah, heard you didn’t like the Potter brat--”
Not at first, anyway. Harry sits in a clipped silence, holding his breath and waiting for a sharp cracking sound for almost a full minute before he slumps down.
He doesn't even care at this point.
Should he risk it?
But who is he to complain, he thinks sullenly. Harry has nerve damage. He’s certainly hurting worse than him. And hell will freeze over before Harry complains. He knows this from experience, at least.
for this to be over already. His lord spares him one last glare and then flicks his head to a masked Death Eater.
Not sending an owl, or at least a message plane only meant one thing, the meeting was not going to be documented, it's off records, and Shacklebolt had a slight feeling that he wasn’t going to enjoy this secret meeting. Fudge barely ever had anything worthwhile to say anyway.
Because the difference between a mind in the throes of deterioration and the usual shortcomings every person could be riddled with is not as pronounced as Draco would have thought.
Draco wrinkles his nose at the pet name, "First of all, no. Second of all, they use slang for money?"
"Would you really rather stay and find out?"
him, "revenge?"
"They're bound to arrive any seconds now," a knock interrupts the rest of her sentence and Minerva nods at him. "Keep them in the office."
With a deep mighty breath, Harry prepares himself. “Twinky?”
to stay the night."
"You shut the fuck up," he growls and Harry chokes, "You will shut your mouth or I'll crush your fucking throat."
Of course, that's not the way the world works, not the way the wheel turns, because Harry cannot take a fucking break, and this new asshole is late to the game.
Father's dictum didn't apply to muggles, and it's not as if the person who left it here needed it more than Harry would. If they did, they wouldn't have left it here.
How is Harry functioning at all without any pain relievers? After being tortured for so long? “At all?"
The slight weight of his wand in his jean pocket is comforting as he steps out of the house, locking the door behind him. The sky is a mesmerizing orange, fading to purples and blues and blacks. The sun has long since disappeared behind the vast rows of identical houses.
We were absolutely amazed by the great response we got for the last chapter. Thanks lots and lots to our Beta Amar, and also, we sure had our fun with the characters and sets with this chapter. Hoping it gets the desired effect!
"If you count to nine hundred ninety-nine, you would find that there's no 'a' in the spelling. It's true."
that for one startling moment, Harry really isn't sure whether he is awake or not
“Yeah,” he mutters, then asks, a little awkwardly, “How’re you?”
Rosier shoves him into the fireplace and before Draco can utter a word, he's stunned. All he hears before they floo away, is the young man shouting,
"Is he in some sort of secret training program and you join him from time to--"
"That's ridiculous,"
Draco stares at Harry’s face, pinched with frustration and chewing through his lips. He raises a hand to free his lip from between his teeth, his finger, lingers on Harry’s lip and says, "Actually, I have an idea."
step outside the wards, no further than a hundred yards around the cottage. You’ll step out and you will be found sooner than you can say the word ‘snitch’.”
He flips the diary open, his fingers tracing random pages as he tries to remember where he left off last. Albus Dumbledore, whilst very organized with the sequence of events, was not as neat when it came to writing down said sequences.
"I wanted to do something nice for you," he says honestly, "We both needed a break, and I--"
"Oh no," he says again, like a fucking idiot, "This is not the kind I wanted. Sorry for bothering you."
His sudden but strong hatred feels like the same rush of feelings, those few times he's been on the Knight Bus. And he’d always hated it, and Severus, who was the only one even allowing him on the damned thing, hated that
Harry can see it, clear as day, Rosier in his place, and Voldemort looming above him. In the same position. Harry was Voldemort then, pushing down on the man's face with his foot, feeling the bone give away.
And Harry is. Kissing. Him.
"The curriculum?" He cuts in, because dear merlin, Ron talks too much sometimes, "Obviously there should be one." He rubs at his temples.
"Is that-” Harry seems to realise what he’s doing with his hands, and clasps them together, “Is that bad?”
Severus still cringes as he puts the vial at Potter’s lips and wraps one of the boy’s hands around it, “Drink up, Potter. It’s a pepper up. We don’t have time.”
"Then I wouldn't be Inspector Gadget, I'll be Harry with a silly hat."
Harry chuckles, he's a bit breathless with the cold. Draco wants to make it go away. He really does.
, Draco wants to shout, she'll just hurt them both.
There will be an Interlude also updated on: Friday 7th of May, so keep an eye for that!
"And yet," his lord drawls, his voice almost soft, he caresses Nagini's head as the snake tangles herself around him, her tongue flickering at the coppery scent of blood. "And yet I let you live."
He had never known such pain.
Before he can even try returning Hermione's crushing hug, he's wrenched out of her arms and Sirius is in front of him, frantically looking him up and down as if he expects Harry to suddenly combust.
Had. He hates himself for switching to the past tense so readily, even though he knows father didn't have the smallest chance of survival.
At least Potter is safe.
“Yeah,” Harry mutters, “Just like Hogwarts is the safest place in the world.”
sure of.
Heart in his throat, he makes quick work of pulling off the well-worn steel-tipped boots from Rosier’s limp feet. He carefully does not look up from them. Or tries not to. His eyes snag on a piece of wood lying next to Rosier. A familiar piece of wood, now.
Some part of him, a minuscule voice in the background, wishes that it was always like this for them. Harry and Draco against the world. No war, no magic. Just them. Maybe they would live here, in Market Deeping, in that cute apartment between the bakery and a pet shop.
"I wasn't really worried about it," Harry mutters. "I swear it wasn't this bad yesterday."
She will probably have him sit in her detention right now. He will get a firsthand experience in what Potter has been going through for over a month since the term started. His wand is a distinguished presence in his sleeve. He knows he can take on Umbridge, he has been trained by his parents and Severus. And he is not above using the dark arts to escape if she tries something.
Harry laughs. The genuine one.  A beautiful sound. One for which Draco would steal a thousand wallets, and that makes him cringe in his own head. He’s turning into a sap. Dear Merlin and Circe.
In the memory, he's lying flat against the grass, his small body shivering under the lashing rain. The cut on his head keeps bleeding in rushing rivulets under the droplets.
"I am!" Harry snaps. "I need to call for someone!"
"Don't tell me," Harry pulls him off the hard cold chair, and eases the bag off his shoulder. "Let's go."
“Well, I suppose we wouldn’t know anyway. He’ll be here in two days.”
Harry scowls. "This isn't my fault,"
"I'm going to…" he breathes, the vial falls off his hand, "I'm going to heat up this knife."
Remus himself settles in Minerva's chair. "You don't need to do any lines. We can just spend the day here, catch up."
The Slytherin side of him demands Draco to shut the hell up.
It’s a shoe. A single shoe. Harry’s shoe to be exact. Lying forlorn in the sand, upturned.
"This is delicious," Harry says, licking his spoon. What was his obsession with licking stuff in front of him? It’s like he deliberately wants Draco to get a hard-on in public places.
Too many questions, not enough answers.
"No, I don't know," Harry says shortly, lengthening his strides, even though he knows it won’t help escape Sirius.
'This is the third time I'm cursing my eyes in a single day, ' Harry thinks, ' That's a new record. '
"The white man?"
He stares at Severus, and the potion master stares back at him, his chin idly propped on the back of his hands, the edge of his elbows are just brushing the tip of the table.
"The nerve soothers," Severus says quietly as he examines his arm.
"I know." Severus steps back, crossing his arms over his chest, "I don't need a full recount, Mr. Potter."
The bathroom is filled with steam and the water is starting to run cold. Running his hands through his hair one last time, he reaches forward and turns off the tap. His shoulder aches fiercely but the pain in his chest is too profound for any other aches to be significant.
Slowly at first, and then falling with a muffled thud, Harry slides to the floor.
To his surprise, instead of denying it, Potter says, “Oh? And are you doing any better?”
"Cover yourself with the robe. It's cold."
"Hypothetically speaking, if we got rid of Umbridge--"
Draco can see the way Harry swallows nervously before asking, "Please tell me there is an antidote?"
"Protect them?" He suggests although he is still a bit baffled as to how two fifteen-year-olds would be able to get into enough trouble that warrants babysitting.
Draco barely restrains a sigh of relief.
Next update Saturday: 7th of June
doesn't really have a name yet.
'You need to help yourself before helping him. I would know. I'm a figment of your imagination, and even your mind is telling you to slow down. It'll save time later on, '
He nods at himself once more before throwing the powder in the roaring fire, he says, his voice as flat and emotionless as his face, “Malfoy Manor!”
The risk factor just went through the roof.
"Diffindo!" Draco flinches in surprise, and Umbridge jerks her hand back with a hiss. There is a long, red gash running from her wrist up to her elbow. Then his eyes flit towards the doorway, from where the voice had come, and Draco gapes.
If Harry's lucky enough, and they really do mean it, maybe he can try picking his cupboard's lock to get some of his homework done. He hasn't done a single essay from the start of the summer, mostly because his things weren't with him, but also because… well, because he really doesn't like thinking about Hogwarts more than he has to.
sign lit up about five yards over, glowing through the grey gloom.
They need to get as far away from here as possible. And Tattershall… he still doesn’t know where they really are. If he wants to go to Slughorn’s at Tattershall, they need to start somewhere they know.
"No, that's you!"
“Right,” he says, voice low. He looks towards Harry, who is now eyeing the pitcher of water with suspicion.
"All forgiven, and hopefully forgotten soon. So...you miss Granger and Weasley. Don't hit me, but how could you miss them?"
“Oh no. Do you have a plan? Anything?” then he remembers who he's speaking to. “Forget it, don’t speak, just… just don't die, alright?”
One didn't have to be a genius to assume what someone like Mad-Eye Moody would do to the son of a known Death Eater. And he's been here when Draco was
He's content, with Draco finally getting some rest, with them safe and warm and not freezing to death.
"I wanted to tell you," Harry says, resigned.
“We’re not fine, Twinky,” Draco says, exhausted as well. He needs a lifetime of sleep to get over the weariness in his bones. A lifetime of sleep… well, technically he is going to get that in two days. Draco hopes that death would have some semblance of peace in it. “But thanks for asking,”
"Oh, you have got to be kidding me!" Harry raises his hands from where they were playing with the hem of his pajamas, letting out a noise more exasperated than annoyed, and Ron is seriously not sure whether that is a good thing or not.
This is Rosier's idea of revenge. Of course it is, he blames Harry for what Voldemort did to him, seemingly unaware of the fact that
Harry wakes up at the crack of dawn each morning, or correction, he resumes being awake at the crack of dawn each morning. Draco knows that the other boy isn't getting much sleep during the nights, even though they share a sleeping place, and Draco's dreams are dramatically milder in comparison to Potter's inner fight every time he closes his eyes. Draco actually doesn't know a whole lot about Harry’s sleeping habit beyond the fact that he's a blanket hog.
Did he mention his legs? They fucking hurt.
'Do you know why they call the fire-flooding potion by that name?' Severus had asked him a lifetime ago, when his face didn't have as many lines as it does now.
he thinks. But he's glad that none of his screams had disturbed Ron. Or anyone else, for that matter.
"Thanks," Potter murmurs, relaxing against the wall.
We don't need to do this. Cedric's death was tragic and I dream about it sometimes, so what?” Harry is gesturing around wildly; it’s almost comical and Ron is having trouble following Harry’s hands, “You still have recurring nightmares about a tarantula eating your face! We all have issues." Ron refocuses back on Harry’s face.
Harry recognises Professor McGonagall’s voice too, who is partly hidden by the wall. "How is that even possible?"
Every twitch, every laugh--because Sirius has more than a dozen of those and each means something different-- every frown, and every time he looks at Remus with the look on his face.
Then he looks back down at his injured hand, and his mouth opens a little at the sight of his submerged hand. He looks like he wants to snatch his hand away, but is reluctant, or perhaps even too fascinated by it to do so.
Fuck.
"Harry," he calls louder, minutes later, fixedly staring at Potter as the boy stares at his lap, this time wincing as the action pulls at the scabs on his face. He reaches a hand and physically shakes the boy's shoulder. He doesn't feel intrusive, or uncomfortably self conscious as he does this. He hadn't considered touching Harry to startle him out of his ' mindset' and the fact that Potter's warm skin shifts under his fingers at last is such a blissful relief.
funny, though. Because one of Slytherin’s prominent qualities is self-preservation, and Draco is nothing if not a Slytherin.
Umbridge straightens up, "Well, Mr. Potter. Seems like you don't listen to instructions well either. No surprise there." she's facing him, and Draco struggles to grapple around for his wand, finding it should be easier than this. It must have rolled under the desk.
Everyone still looks like they’re bubbling with questions, but at Ron and Hermione’s expression, wisely keep it to themselves.
He knows how to make tea now, and also scrambled eggs, and he's halfway through learning how to roast chicken without poisoning them to death. Harry saw these 'survival lessons' strictly necessary after he had found Draco's disaster projects when he was sick.
He glances down at the bandage wrapped around his arm. Harry didn’t remember anything of last night, not after he’d gone to sleep. He hadn’t even been suspicious when Draco had blurted out the first excuse that came to mind.
Blood rushes to his cheeks, "You insulted Ron!" Draco is always reminded of storms in a teacup, whenever he sees Harry's eyes flash in annoyance. It's so easy for him to become aggravated.
He carefully watches Harry, waiting for any spark of-- of something. Horror, maybe. Even curiosity. But he’s as… well, not normal. Not that. But his face is as neutral as can be, as always.
He stays for fifteen additional minutes after Potter leaves, it’s ridiculously late, especially since Potter showed up so late, but Draco is too cautious to be seen with the other boy in any shape or form. So he generously offers Potter the leaving slip and settles back on the ground, watching Potter disappear from view.
He has downed half the glass in five seconds, and it burns. He finishes the rest of it and pours himself another, but doesn't sip yet. He stares at the nearly full glass, and the liquid inside, and his hands which are gripping it. He traces the rim with a finger, his lips pursed.
"I like it," Harry awkwardly turns and heads for the sink. He needs his water to bolt out of here. Maybe head back to his own room, or hide in the loo until morning, he's not sure which he'd rather do now.
Fuck.
"What else can I do?" Harry's not really asking. He looks at the melted chocolate clenched in Sirius's hand and is morbidly reminded of his own state. He knows how sad it is to compare oneself to melted chocolate.
“Completely numbs the pain in my chest and cheek, and the shoulder is a fierce throb, but not unbearable burning.”
"And I'm sure you're aware of Black's break-in, two days ago,"
His eyes dreg to the knife. The matches.
him and his godson, and take them back to a house governed by Molly Weasley and Black.
Since this is an Interlude, we will be updating chapter eighteen NEXT Saturday instead of the normal scheduled date. Have fun with it and stay safe.
There’s Harry, undoubtedly Harry, on the floor. His body twisted and trembling as he struggles to lift up his head. There’s another body, and it takes him a hot moment to recognise the disfigured, bloodied face of Evan Rosier.
He runs outside, ignores the crashing waves and the wind. It's a cloudy day, it’s going to storm. Severus surveys the shore with wide eyes.
Evan cannot tolerate this for a moment longer. He truly cannot. He wants death, he chooses death, he needs this to be over.
Draco uses her distraction and ducks his head and just as he had thought, his wand lies, innocuously under the desk, slightly out of his reach.
Not anymore. The realization hits him like a train. The truth is bare and simple, and Harry stills.
Harry, naturally, ignores the last question, "Is it too late to fix it?"
Harry almost has an intimate moment with the asphalt before Remus tugs him back up, steadying him on his feet before looking around.
"Mom!" Ron exclaims but then quickly ducks his head as he catches Harry's eyes.
"It is a dark curse, simple healing charms wouldn't do the trick, Potter."
(See the end of the chapter for
each other. Harry is suffering and Draco is gaslighting him. He has to tell him. Could he tell him? No, no, no he can’t do that to Harry.
“Oh, only if you insist. Crucio!”
Severus looks at Draco. "I'm glad you're up and about." He looks passively normal, stolid as ever. Draco tires of seeing the man's face after being exposed to him for more than a minute. It has been that way since childhood. He cannot tolerate the way Severus
No. Harry feels tired, hungry, in pain, and quite simply more murderous than he has ever felt in his life. If she keeps this up, he might just go through with Imaginary Sirius's plan. Kill the bitch. Then dissolve the body in a potion or something. Maybe Snape would help him too, he certainly didn't seem to like her all that much either.
Living with Harry Potter as opposed to only seeing him in classes for no longer than a small glimpse during the years is somewhat different than Draco had been expecting. Of course the mere prospect of being in
" she says and Harry takes the quill, his hand already throbbing in sympathy of what is about to come. The quill rolls between his fingers, and Harry has the sudden urge to think whether he can stab her with the quill. The image is violent and bloodied, but surprisingly neither deter his daydreaming. He wants to see her in pain.
The sight is very unsettling.
"We're being used as manual labor, Hermione. You're just drooling because Sirius said you could use the books if you helped in the cleaning,"
Harry gives him a smile, "You're good at justifying things. Have you ever thought about being a lawyer as a career?"
Evan knows so because he has nothing else to stare into as his body shudders with the aftereffects of waves of intense torture. Time after time after time. His lord had not been pleased. Oh not pleased at all. His missing fingernails can attest to that.
"No Hermione, no shenanigans. Just keep your heads down for now, and Harry will be back." They drop their heads, "I promise. Besides you're going to be doing a lot of good with this new project, I'll talk to Sirius about it, and you should start putting this binder to use."
"And the cost," another click of the tongue. "Lucius Malfoy is dead, Evan. You forced him into acting out. I had him in the palm of my hand, and you burned it to ashes," the scales roughly rub against his bare skin and Evan is so mortified by its presence that he screams merely as an outlet for the over piling terror.
Harry doesn't see his trunk floating behind the man anymore. "My trunk,"
He's in pain, and he's enraged and he wants nothing more than Rosier dropping dead by his feet.
"I want a… dated one. The older the better," he is talking right out of his ass. He has no idea how pickles work, he has no idea how wine works either.
"It matters!"
"You wouldn't happen to have any speculations regarding that?"
He works as if on autopilot. This is easy. He can do this. As long as he doesn't make any mistakes, or doesn't have any accidents, he'd be fine. He could just block everything out and complete his chores for that day. Maybe there would be enough chores today to exhaust him so much that he won't dream.
"Haven't you been taking any?” Severus looks surprised. Draco is too, even though he shouldn't have been. He's never seen Harry take any pain relievers for himself and like a moron had just assumed that Potter binged on the thing while showering.
Chapter Warning(s) for; Explicit language, child abuse (mentioned/referenced), child neglect, physical abuse (mentioned/referenced), character death (mentioned), implied sex work (mentioned), underage drinking
Then as an afterthought, he hands in the wands in his pocket over as well. "Do you understand, Potter?"
"Can I help you, lads?" The clerk asks with a lopsided grin, her apron is striped red and blue and she has a ridiculous hat on her head. She's a muggle. Obviously a muggle.
"We're so lucky we have matches," he mumbles and Draco tries not to whimper in pain. It comes and goes in varying waves and he's about to faint. He might.
enveloping his entire body. Harry's eyes roll back and his heart skips a few beats.
Draco pulls the cloak from him and tightens it around his shoulder with fumbling fingers. He smothers his whimper.
He can go to Myrtle’s bathroom again, there’s very little chance that Malfoy would be there today. And he never got to say hi to her. He frowns, he hadn’t seen her there yesterday. And he needs to do something about the bleeding too.
one more push and the fragile bone would give in, Evan knows this, with the same clarity he knows that the sky is blue, but he cannot stop it, he cannot beg. He cannot

Chapter warnings for; explicit language, mentions of character death and torture.
Malfoy is unrolling the gauze right now, and Harry watches him, secretly marveling at his unhurried expression. This is the last time he'll ever see Malfoy like this again. Harry discreetly mourns the loss for a reason he himself is unaware of. Malfoy's eyes flick over to the already murky bowl, tainted with blood, and he frowns. He grips Harry's wrist again and pulls it out. Harry almost protests at the loss of Murtlap essence, but then Draco speaks.
"Harry, I'm not sure about this."
"Give me your glasses," he quickly says and Harry obliges, feeling the urgency crackle between them. They're still in danger, they must be or else Remus wouldn't behave in this way. The man is the calmest person Harry knows to this day, it's very unsettling to see him like this.
"Then how did she poison me without stealing from you?"
"Nothing is going to happen in five minutes, Draco,” Harry snaps. He feels like an asshole for being this manipulative, but there is honestly no way that he can handle Draco right now. For his sake, not for Harry's.
"More than the information he's giving us? C'mon, it's a perfectly fine name,
"Potter, what are you talking about?" Severus' voice came out sharper than intended, and Potter rears back in his chair for a moment, before forging on with vehemence.
The pain in his toes is frankly interfering at this point. Draco sneers down at his feet.
The bench isn't comfortable, but he could sleep here if he wanted to. It's in the open, and that somehow feels better. And maybe, just maybe, he won't have a nightmare for once. He laughs at his own joke. Then abruptly stops when he realizes how pathetic it is making him look. Sitting in a vacant park, laughing at something only he knows.
His breath catches when he sees the telltale lights of three
"Draco, you
Harry chuckles, "Yes! I watched it on Friday afternoons from the slot of my cupboard. I used to want a hat like that."
"Yes, nice bonding experience,” Harry cuts in, wringing his left hand and bouncing his leg restlessly, “Am I going to die?"
SURPRISE!
He looks around the barn.
"A bit rebellious, aren't you?" She asks Harry, wiggling her eyebrows at the bars on Harry's window.
"Alright," Harry wonders whether they're dumping him with their neighbor Mrs. Figg or taking him along to Marge's house. Probably force him to sleep in the kennels with the dogs. Harry winces.
'This is the second time it’s happened. There's something wrong, Harry,' Sirius says, and Harry resists the urge to turn towards him and let out the barrage of terror in a single scream.
Draco's breath hitches and he swallows down the panic threatening to climb up his throat. His grip tightens around his wand as he turns on the spot, turning in circles, trying, perhaps in vain to find Harry.
"Oh, shut up!"
"Map." He turns to Draco with a smile. The bright one Draco
If Draco knew Harry would accept it, he’d have long since offered to carry the other boy now as well.
"You abducted Harry Potter and the son of a fellow Death Eater, one with a much higher ranking than yours,
Because she has the potential, Draco knows this, and can easily see it on her. But what would she try, and more importantly, what would be her motive?
“I’ll be up as soon as possible, make sure you are ready.” Severus swallows, continuing, "Accommodations have been made, you can join us." Although, he knows already what the answer is going to be.
Draco is
Draco sucks in a breath, “You’re not killing me.”
"Fuck the money,” Harry says, tensing up, he's looking ahead, his shoulders hunched, “Just… please."
"And you're the only one she did this to?"
"Wow, they were hungry for sure," Harry marvels, and one of the birds hops back on his shoulder. Draco steers clear from Harry's bird cult and walks over to the counter, pulling out a kettle to fill.
"I won't have to," She smiles at him, sweetly. Disgustingly. "You'd be dead before you find out, wouldn't you?"
She's a muggle. Her touch is dirt. Her entire being in his presence is a stain.

"Are we doing lines?" Ron finished for her, flopping down on the wooden chair Remus conjured with a swish of his wand.
"Pretty?” Harry sounds sceptical, “No, they're insane."
Two weeks ago, my lovely grandmother, and Elen's lovely grandfather passed away due to health complications. May they both rest in peace.
There's a small crash and a groan. "Working on it,"  Tonks replies.
They barely encounter any muggles, there was one with an umbrella that gives them a weird look before hastily moving away from them, and a man growling into his hand that for some reason was held to his ear.
“You talk as if you know a way out of here.” He ignores the hope sparking in his heart.
They sit and eat in silence for a while. The sandwich, ham and cheese; Draco’s favourite, sits heavily in his stomach.
Sirius follows the rapid pacing. 'Listen to your instincts,' he has the audacity to say and Harry snaps.
Twinky looks startled, and then embarrassed, biting down on her lips as she quickly makes her way over to them, mumbling apologies. Draco ignores them and snatches the food off the tray, propping Harry up against the wall, shushing him when he makes a half choked sound, choking on air. There's nothing else.
"Mailman?” Harry shrugs, “Or woman. I don't know. They empty the boxes and deliver the letters."
“God,” Draco starts, throwing his hands up, only to wince and put them back down, “Stop the pity party already,”
Draco rolls his eyes, "Harry I swear to God, you're gonna make me overdose."
He raises his eyebrows at the duo, "Alright that sounds serious."
"Don't you like blue?"
Part of it, Remus knows is because of Harry's predicament, but the rest is just Sirius being an asshole on purpose.
"Over," Harry says, and then applies dittany again. It's blessedly cool, and it doesn't sting like before, not anymore.
It has to be a curse. Jinxes don't carry enough force to propel that kind of reaction without a jinxed object nearby, and Draco searched Harry several times last night as thoroughly as he dared.
“What do you expect of filthy blood, Bella?” Rosier replies. Harry imagines Sirius spitting in the man’s face.
His eyes flick over to the discarded shoe, the one Harry had been wearing at first.
Draco wants to keep a hand on his shoulder, to comfort Harry, but he can’t bring himself to. So he just stands a couple steps away, looking at him helplessly. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I was just startled. You’re safe here, I wasn’t going to do anything.”
Next update Saturday, 2nd August
'You need
Harry wakes up with rancid bile already in his mouth. Frantically pushing the covers away, he falls to the floor, and nearly crawls towards the bathroom. Disoriented, and still unfamiliar with the new place, he almost doesn’t reach there in time and expels his guts in the hallway. He scrambles into the bathroom and retches in the dark, holding onto the toilet for dear life.
"But what's wrong with my own name?"
A little wishful thinking never hurt anyone.
Not very far.
"Tell them to come over tomorrow,” he sits back down on the couch with a thump, “I'm too drunk to move about."
"You're fifteen," he says, more to himself than the duo, he presses the heels of his palms against his eyes.
Tonks and Bill are gaping right back at him, looking kind of sheepish. Mad-Eye is reclining on a, probably transfigured, armchair, his non-prosthetic leg in white bandages.
"You failed in your mission," the foot lets up only for a moment before pressing down again with clear intent, Evan's face is purple and his hands, in spite of their burning agony are now clutching at his neck, intensifying the pain beyond a coherent measure. Too much is the answer.
When the boy starts tipping over, Severus acts on instinct and catches him by his arms, but the boy cries out in pain and stumbles back. Severus winces, there is probably a lot of nerve damage if Bellatrix got her hands on him.
Harry frowns, shifting weakly in his place as he grasps Draco’s hand with his own, which is too hot. Too hot to be normal, and he is mumbling in his sleep too, brows pulled together, as if in pain. Or perhaps having a nightmare.
Finally,
He closes his eyes. No one had said being a spy would be easy.
It's hilarious, the power Harry holds over his own pain. If it's inconvenient, it's not worth mentioning. Harry almost died from blood poisoning because of it.

Chapter warning for; Explicit language
Potter's eyes widen in realization and Draco has the most hysterical urge to roll his eyes. He's just getting it now? God, Potter is slow. This is genius. This explains a lot actually. She wasn't assigned only to interfere with the ministry. She was assigned to torture Potter to silence, and probably get rid of Dumbledore.
It was new and eccentric and Draco's mind latched on immediately. Even after the hand was rejected and his intrigue twisted into strong dislike.
Evan bows his head once more. He loves the thrill of a juicy challenge.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, implied/referenced violence and torture, brief racism.
When Draco touches him, or holds him, or even looks at him, he is sure of himself. It's always been this way, it doesn't have anything to do with them dating, anything with the kisses. It's just how Draco is.
We cherish every bit of feedback we receive on this story, thank you all for reading it and enjoy the chapter.
Salamander’s enclave is a bit of a running joke in the Order. One that Severus himself never quite found funny. The cottage itself is absolutely useless, not even used as a hiding route, rather a small shabby cabin, etched underneath a big rock that eerily resembled a crouched salamander from afar, and that was if one were looking for it, hence its name.
He knows there'd be hell to pay if any one of the Dursleys found him with the wand, but he'd rather take a thrashing than deal with Death Eaters or Voldemort wandless.
It’s night, and Harry cannot actually see the sky above the canopy of enormous trees and lush vibrant leaves that extend infinitely above him. He doesn’t care, he knows this place already, like the back of his hand,  he’s not lost or scared.
“Okay, okay.” Harry’s voice has gotten shakier, which doesn’t seem like a good sign. He lifts his head off of Harry's chest and looks at his pale face. “You need to, um, remove your sweater.”
"Lean back on me, it'll help."
He doesn’t appear to be breathing.
Despite that Instance (chapter 10, the trio’s argument, and chapter 11, Ron’s inner monologue), they do treat him as normal. Because they know that is what Harry wants the most from them. For them to make him feel as normal as possible, given everything. That's why Harry loves them, that's why they're so close.
“Siobhan Goven has a record.” Harry sounded proud of his find, even though his voice cracked near the middle, as he pulled out a rolled up parchment file from the back of his robes.
“Then why give a choice and undermine it?” Draco asked from the door, he was too helpless here. Too much was going wrong. The wards were down, Draco was defenceless. Anyone who wanted to kill Harry Potter wouldn’t need much to do it. He did not think Siobhan meant Harry any harm, far from it. Her conduct was the issue. What would she do, if Harry did die? Who would want that news to also supply their name? She might confuse who was her employer. Send word to the papers that Harry died under Malfoy care, not hers.
“And he didn’t say a word to you? This was before any of the issues of his magic came up. You two would have still been the best of friends.”
wanting to save everyone. Like saving me and – how you’ve been obsessed since Hogwarts. But-”
“I’m busy, unless you need those eyes checked.” Instead of taking that as a cue to leave, Harry sat down. Draco bit his lip and refused to look up. No, Harry wasn’t winning this.
Siobhan returned with a floating blob of blood, “I hope this works. His fever broke but I can’t say we have enough magic between us to stop him from having another spike.”
Lasting another hour, tossing and turning Draco left his room again, not able to stop the feeling he was doing something wrong. He’d failed and he needed something. Something. He didn’t know what but staying in that room -- This time he made it to Harry’s door before he faltered again. Harry was clear in his affections, would this be fair? Sneaking into his room or asking to - whatever Draco was going to ask - all he knew he couldn’t stay in that room, or any room on his own. Not with the sound of hissing, melting metal in his head. He needed someone else, something real and not a phantom that conjurered his memories.
“No,” Harry said, as someone hit his shoulder and he stumbled into Draco again. “A bit,” he added as the street crowds began to dwindle and widen. “You never write to me. I get why, just...” Harry shrugged.
“Two conditions.” Harry stood at the Floo, arms crossed and refusing to move already making Draco want to comment on how short in stature he was really. Still, what a thing to say. Draco made sure to look down his nose. What could possibly warrant conditions? Or were these Harry’s true feelings showing through? Did he expect Draco to sit and insult everyone? Bully and blackmail his way into conversation because Draco felt out of place?
Harry was way too warm, too close and Draco kept ending up with an elbow in the ribs.
Unlike the Quidditch matches in Hogwarts, there was no booing here. Only whooping and awing, only cheering and gossip. And gasps. The Beaters were brutal. Three Chasers were injured and one in particular goaded Scorpius on the ground. Draco loathed the little shit already.
Huh. Draco didn’t realise Nott was even nice enough to hand a cloak over if he was dying never mind hand it off to Blaise for-- For what?
“So this is where you’re hiding?” Draco sipped his half-filled flute and didn’t look down at Potter. He was hidden from sight, the half-walls high enough even to hide that unruly hair of his.
“Subtlety, Potter. Changing the subject already?” Hopping off the table, Draco didn’t bother to check what Harry’s face said to being called out. If he didn’t want to talk, fine. Draco wasn’t his keeper. “When I win, you have to do something for me, right?”
“The last time I went didn’t go so well.” Having to leave early because so much animosity was towards him it made his son nearly cower didn't need to be discussed.
Harry’s blank letter remained unsent, Pansy’s unread, while Decimus lay down at the Floo to nap as both Malfoys went to spend time in Diagon Alley. Draco was recognised although wasn’t the disaster he assumed, even if he did spy a few snarling expressions his way.
“I won’t.” Harry didn’t look but neither did he let go. “Keep writing.” He rested his head against his shoulder and Draco sighed in defeat. A great deal of comfort came from simply the weight of someone next to him, the occasional refocus on something solid than the phantoms in his head.
“...Perfectly reasonable.”
The mishmash of emotion in Draco’s head was nearly enough to make him pass out. His own anger seemed indistinguishable from Blaise’s, was he mad at Nott? Was Blaise? Whose emotions were these?
“We are--”
“Luna’s, she’s been worried you haven’t wrote to her like usual in a while. I said I’d help bring you round.”
“I’ll take care of it--” Harry tried to pull away but Draco didn’t know if it was the total darkness, the type that didn’t change between him closing his eyes or not, but the idea didn’t panic him. Or the relief that this might very be the reason why Harry had started avoiding sleeping in the same bed.
Years ago Draco would tell his son pranks were a waste of time, not when he could read something and learn a new wonder in the world. Right now, Draco waddled into the kitchen, peeked around the cabinet corner and watched Potter try and make tea while fighting off what could only be a nervous breakdown. Pain for pain sake, revenge was sweet and Slytherin ambition all played a key part in his decision.
“Where do you get your confidence?” Did Harry know how to lose? Had he ever had a defeat where he didn’t brush it off and walk away unharmed?
“Are you scared of him?”
That’s what this was and as Draco threw himself back down on the couch next to Harry, these emotions twisted to annoyance at himself. Pansy hadn’t even made him feel off kilter and she’d been a teenage girl who knew how to rile and soothe him before Draco knew that about himself.
Of course it was.
Not eating like this spoke of a curse another one - a twofold, two layered curse with one spell strike was rare. This seemed too custom-made for Draco’s situation. The timer wasn’t an activator but now Draco knew time was a factor he couldn’t sit idly by and wait for the curse to eat itself away or for Potter to figure anything out.
Anyway I know I said the angst was going to be over and it slunk back in there buut~~ I promise the fluff that I will get to will make up for it. Domestic fluff! Like, cuddling spooning fluffs. *All of the fluffs*. (Like fluffy crup and Draco cooing over it fluff and Harry defending Draco fluff, ALL FLUFF, so MUCH FLOOF) so, those who do not like the angst, hang in there! :'D
“I hope you aren’t angry.”

“My dad was saying you make him potions. Could I make them?”
What Draco could only assume of the potions Harry was taking previous was the staple way in brewing the Sleeping Draught. Changes were necessary to this recipe and it would another hour at that before Draco could add in the extras to give it enough kick.
“I suppose it’s better than people finding out the truth.” Draco shrugged, looked around and spied a more intimate twenty or so guests still remaining. In the old days, this was when bribes and deals were introduced. Hermione was on a warpath and she wouldn’t not chat about her vision. Draco would be needed to prod a few towards agreeing. “What did you tell everyone?” He hadn’t been hugged by so many people in a long time. A lie. He hadn’t been hugged so often, ever.
“It isn’t an owl?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Seems whatever happens to me is a free pass for everyone.”
“Helicopter.” Draco nodded, kept this knowledge to himself. He’d have to find a way to speak more on these Transports. There were so many (why were there so many). Draco panicked a little as Harry walked off, as did the other Muggles - staying seated while the names scrolled seemed to be a call to leave; maybe his name was up there as a reminder to leave. He hurried to keep up with Harry, questions spilling out as he tried to prioritise them.
Lighting up, grin and all Harry replied, “I was hoping you wouldn’t ask that.”
“I don’t flinch.” Draco kept his eye on the arm he was to fix. Not on Harry’s face or how weak Harry’s grip was around his wrist - Draco could easily break away - or how he sounded concerned. Harry didn’t know what he was talking about. If he could just let go and not make this weird. Draco wasn’t touched by people, no hugs or handshakes, no goodbye pecks of the cheek.
Draco was not convinced and it might have been obvious on his face as Harry laughed, relief in his own voice before it was gone. The rush of heat and his heartbeat in his ears made Draco wish he could apparate from the Ministry. What he expected was not what he’d found.
Healer said, “The Dark Magic has damaged his core--” he continued to talk, muted again by Harry’s memory and frantic thoughts at the time.
He sighed at the noise. She would refuse to come into the room unless Draco allowed her physically.
“Scorpius. Enough.”
“Whenever I heard my father say mudblood or blood-traitor I’d cringe because I thought if you somehow overheard it you’d regret the decision to defend me.” Draco scoffed. “If anything, I’ve been too conscious of what your opinion was, one way or the other a—”
These questions were not important. What was important was Potter to disappear for an hour or so, allow Draco to leave and return to the Manor and check on the Dark Artefacts in his home. Then he could round up the morons who didn’t know how old wizarding houses worked. Did they not realise they were not just an alarm? The only error on Draco’s part was someone had seen his animagus form and that was easily solved by refuting it in a certain manner. His wand was back at the Manor. No one would assume Draco Malfoy Ex-Death Eater would want to change himself into a damned owl and leave his wan to boot. They probably expected him to appear as a Dementor.
“And what am I supposed to do for three measly votes?” Draco was listening, if on guard. Hermione might sway those with logic and fairness, though very few of the Twenty Eight actually wished for the latter when dealing with anyone else other than the pureblooded families.
Harry tried to stay as quiet as possible but every gasp, every murmur of his name made Draco eager to join, see if he could make Harry louder, lose all control. Starting at his hip, he trailed down while Harry swore again. Either the teasing was too much or Harry was just impatient but grabbed his wrist, guided him down.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less of you Lotty.” While Decimus tilted its head at her and her sobbing, Draco continued despite the noise of her blowing her nose on her clothing.
Good, Draco preened. His bluffing had worked wonders! They were most likely in the top ten, but nowhere near what the old vaults contained. Although, most of Malfoy’s wealth these days were in the Artefacts and heirlooms, priceless to collectors or academics.
“How’re you feeling?”
Time wasted he returned to walk in and finally deal with this paranoid part of him.
“Don’t read what I write. Don’t even look. I won’t trust you again.”
Wringing his hands again, Draco hadn’t a clue what to do or say. Harry seemed ready to return to sleep.
But if he hadn’t been there…
Like a Muggle.
“-That ran off with the last timeturner because he thought he knew better?” Draco interrupted to try and remind Scorpius was not unknown to be impulsive. Scorpius actually looked amused, if not a bit bashful over Draco remembering. If he hadn’t potentially ruined time and space, Draco might have found the whole story amusing too.
“Albus has had it easy at Hogwarts. He’s used to knowing everything and now he doesn’t.”
“Excellent.”
Taking into consideration Draco and Harry had left the Muggle zoo hours ago, Draco shouldn’t still have possession over the parchment which had once been around his wrist. He didn’t understand it. Why tag everyone, even the Muggle children at the entrance? He twirled around his fingers, not making sense of any of the numbers on it. They didn’t seem to be handwritten at all, too much like a perfect copy and Draco didn’t understand how that was even possible. They didn’t have auto-quills which would write whatever was dictated to them.
That got a laugh out of him. They both failed their respective spells. Neither of them admitted defeat and agreed to meet next week. Again. It was at this the point clear, neither of them could teach their retrospective spells but it didn’t stop them. Draco would not admit defeat. Even as he returned to the Manor again without a Patronus. Neville had been privy to his change of form only a few months ago. Why he decided to put effort into being a bee and not ask to see Draco's form for a second time was somewhat of a hit to the ego.
“I do not have a Mundane Cold. I’m too warm for that.” Harry snorted. “Whatever you are about to say, don’t.”
Somewhere in the evening, Albus crashed into his home with a loud apparition, a case filled with rattling glass and vials.
“Three, or four. I think. Ginny asked Charlie to make them.” Harry rubbed at his neck and accepted the cup of tea again. This time he seemed to stare at his reflection instead of nursing it in his hands.
“What happened? Is he okay?” Draco would like to think Harry asked him those questions, but again, he went over his head and was talking to someone else about him.
Potter was staying in the rest of the night. Going out again? Was he barmy? Only the silence stopped when the box moved in his hands and a loud tone-deaf song played. If anything, Harry seemed greatly amused by it. (Draco did not flinch).
Many of the Aurors were as uncomfortable seeing Harry again as the first time. Again, Draco was met with a few more glances, a few more whispers - which he heard clear as if they were shouting. One wanted to know why Harry hadn’t been fired, resigned or was taken from his station. Another few gossiped about someone, and finally someone asked about him, what was up with the owl, they’d discussed.
From the outsider looking in, it was uttery shite in all its qualities. Too short, too thin, too few branches and no seeds created. It was a seedling, branching no more than a few inches in height and length before it faded out. Blaise assumed wrong, as Potter was at the middle mound. He thought Potter probably only managed one and a half, like most ‘powerful’ wizards and witches. Blaise had only ever managed one.
Draco wasn’t sure how much longer they could stay like this.
“Scorpius tried to calm her but I think it’s made her worse.”
“Now, puffs, hurry up.” Draco shooed him away with shaky hands, unlike Potter he did not have any available funds for Muggle activities. Harry laughed and leaving Draco to swear under his breath as he left. It wasn’t possible, it wasn’t right for Muggles to come up with this ‘fashion’.
“I’ll be heading in a bit, First Years tomorrow with Mandrakes,” Neville said, picking up his prized FireWhiskey and Draco made a point to look away.
“James, if you don’t make this right you’re a self-righteous bully who doesn’t think he’s wrong. You know Scorpius well enough to know what to say to hurt and you did it anyway just to try and show off.” The Parent Voice, not loud but low toned anger that made both Albus and James lower their gaze. Draco tilted his head and hooted. Fine. He would show Albus some mercy. If Scorpius wanted him to. James. James though would be a test of his patience. It was easier to consider James an idiot - even though his education said the opposite.
He was sweating as Draco started to dissect the lies he spoke, and those nearby were happy to watch him fall. The crowds appreciated an arrogant sod falling. One thing Draco understood more than not now was arrogance and bragging did nothing but dig under everyone’s skin. Another couple, who did not entertain him in the slightest were not interested in him. They were Hermione’s guests and so Draco excused himself too. Bumping into someone, he turned to apologise and make up for his lack of grace only for him to realise it wasn’t his fault.
Hopefully Harry wanted to leave now.
Lotty enjoyed his company as Potter was the only one to compliment her attempts at cooking grander and grander meals. Three adults and a house elf did not need five courses every meal. She was keen for praise and Draco didn’t have the heart to give her his own thoughts on the food. He thought it normal, though clearly was above parr by most others’ standards.
“Then he will not speak. Mr. Malfoy you will not speak to any of those crups.”
“No. I figured something was off when Lily avoided Harry when I brought him back home. Well, home to Ginny. I suspect he lives in that hovel.” Ron leaving did provide him with the ability to now talk somewhat openly with Hermione.
“You have a lot of Declarations of Intentions to write, I suggest you start now.” Draco spied what Blaise had taken from his home. Parchment, seal of Malfoy at the top corner, and ink were set up and Draco followed the command without much resistance.
--before on my own and I don’t need you or your Ministry to waltz in here as if you’re doing any good for me because I somehow, after all this time, need your help? Are you barmy?”
“Shut up, Collins. If we don’t do this we might as well hang up our badges and tell everyone the Great Harry Potter isn’t half the wizard he was.”
“Wasn’t talking to you, Potter.”
“Too busy are you?” Harry shouted at his retreating back.
“I’m leaving. Get rid of it.”
Draco knew he was no good. Knew he panicked easily. But maybe, maybe it was Voldemort and the War that shifted that little part of Draco’s brain to that point. A point where Draco had, had enough and started think, think, think.
“Whenever I think about one of those ridiculous beasts, all I see is him jumping up on its back. What idiot decides to go off and ride some feral monster into the sky?”
He felt it in Harry’s posture too, how his muscles relaxed and Draco was going to pull away before Harry kept him still. Harry’s eyes were dark, as if the sun eclipsed and his face flushed.
“Hey, sorry.”
Shaking his head, Harry huffed to turn onto his side, felt around the table which was raised just a little too high for where he lay to really see what was on it. “My glasses.”
The letter wasn’t cryptic. While it wasn’t a riddle to solve, the plainness of it said how much Nott was no longer having fun – no longer hedging his bets as Draco assumed earlier. No, a warning, clear as day and it was awful, truly awful news. How bad did his situation need to be to warrant Nott’s mercy?
?” Blaise rubbed at his forehead, frowning. “Fuck. What’s even happening? Really? A fucking year, gone and this is so--”
Well, Draco would take tonight, this morning – whatever time it was right now – and coo over Potter for a while, rather this missed feeling of having someone beside him, warm and accepting and his. Harry hummed a response, borderline conscious as Draco ran his fingers over a scar – one Draco wasn’t familiar at all. Probably sustained in the line of duty doing something wholly foolish and Harry Potterish. It was an indent into his skin, smooth here and there and over the bones of his shoulder.
Ginny beckoned him to follow and he did so, knowing he was likely going to an interrogation.
“No?”
The bathroom was down the hall, Draco found it fit his needs well enough. A lock, considering Draco wandless wouldn’t stop an incredibly curious Harry Potter, but it would give him some time. Potter wasn’t keen to clean his place, but putting holes and tearing doors of their hinges seemed below even his new reluctance. So, Draco was content to morph back into his human form.
Finally, Neville laughed. A short full laugh that made Draco want to dress Neville’s face with said butterbeer and leave. “This is hilarious. You’re so going to lose.”
Awkward wasn’t the word. Unaccustomed might fit better as Draco’s wife was content to be swept literally off her feet and into his arms, he doubted Potter would appreciate the act. Harry was trying to walk not simply move rooms - anyone who Draco held any affection for was lucky, absolutely lucky, honestly because he was Draco Malfoy and he was the head of the Malfiy name and wouldn’t do such a thing for just anyone.
Did Harry really need him in the end?
Jumping, she edged away from the approaching crup. “How did you--?” Pansy was from another family blacklisted and watched the crup with horrific fascination.
Draco refused to face Harry. There were few days in Draco’s life he felt unattractive, gross even, to wish and hide away and never have another living person see him. Today he was sure he’d sneezed off his nose and if it hadn’t hurt so much, he’d happily considered it wiped away to nothing.
It took so long for a reply and one Draco wasn’t even sure he was pleased to hear.
“You again? I swear, you want anything illegal and I’ll report you.” Wrek’s greeting was in no way a warning but a bluff that Draco had to suspect worked on those of younger witches and wizards. The usual shopkeepers were lawfully required to hand over details of purchases. Wrek was a squib, one who was well known in certain areas. The name Wrek was not his given name but it was the only one that mattered: a man of little wisdom and low morals and a green-thumb that rivalled Longbottom.
The world had shifted. Seeing Harry in secret had allowed Draco some guard in these emotions and feelings. And now, Draco was well aware, too aware in the difference from how he wanted to treat Harry versus how he had to. He groaned at the idea. He should have stayed away, ignorant and letting their rendezvous change nothing.
Drunk, uninhibited Weasleys. That said enough.
Definitely cruel.
Was he allowed to move on? Would he be hailed as a terrible husband to move on after her death or was he supposed to be alone now, forever until his own death because some people assumed ‘true love’ meant he couldn’t love again.
Siobhan shifted before she crossed her arms. “He’s a widow.” Harry was about to speak before she finished her thought, “So he’s probably lonely enough.”
Two spells and some raw meat, yes, Draco was sure the Emporium would never recover for its loss.
“I did?” Blaise, bless him, tried his best to look confused but he wasn’t buying it. All Slytherins in their year knew how petty and possessive Nott was over his things. Now why would Blaise steal a cloak? They were a little old to be playing those sort of pranks on each other. Unless--
He didn’t know how long it took for the giggling to subside.
“I’m so relieved he has your hair,” she said, smiled and Draco nodded knowing the rumours hadn’t been so kind to either of them. It should put a stop to them.
“Sir, I was told to ask you to sign off on this.” This Auror, with broad shoulders and a crooked nose stayed outside the office. Peeking in like some of the other Aurors before him. It was interesting: cliques of personnel and respect for Harry differing between them. Such might make earning back his famous name of a Dark Wizard Vanquisher more difficult. What was the curious point was this Auror didn’t lack awareness of how dismissive he’d said those words.
(My assumption was I'd get to the party at the 20 chapter mark and so my guesstimate I don't think is too far off the 40 chapter mark? Maybe 45.)
Draco didn’t understand why but the ring didn’t speak for very long, or loudly when Nott was around. The quiet was nice. None of the notes or journals Draco dug around for clues on their inner workings had ever said they waned in power or control. He didn’t know if that was beneficial at all since he still couldn’t refuse anything Blaise so much as had a fleeting desire for. At the beginning, Draco sought to destroy them and had tried repeatedly and yet all attempts failed.
“Try eating. You haven’t had anything in a while.” He added, “Lotty’s worried. Just try some.”
His ego was a little hurt Harry hadn’t taken the first potion and slept like a well-fed babe. Notwithstanding, Draco was also very aware it was unlikely of any of the potions made would cure him for a full night. He’d thought each one might give Harry an hours rest. Between the two already administered, the total minutes resting was under quarter of an hour. Nothing was strong enough and as Draco cast a look back to the potions still available, he could only take a guess Number Four might be potent enough.
“Are you well?” She stood staring at Lotty who, once again scowled at her attempt at handing over said ribbon, hair now a frizzy mane around her face.
“Okay, saying it out loud sounds--”
“Pansy? She was an only child from a pureblood family. At which point was she supposed to let anyone close? Sorry I don’t sleep with Muggles to inflate my numbers.”
“And he knows enough about potions for him to help send messages within time loops and alternative time lines. He’s allowed to be proud of it, Harry. You should interrogate this potion master before he starts labelling your son’s achievements as his own.”
“I’ll get you to the Floo.” Draco swooned at her words, he’d turned to thank Luna but saw her hoisting Seamus up. “Bye Draco, Neville-- See you, Harry.”
Draco stopped being aware then. Two days or twenty, he wasn’t certain how long he spent in Blaise’s home. All he knew was, sometimes, he awoke and was sore and wanted to kill Blaise. And others he heard the voices of the rings and that was it – he saw nothing, just walked to where the voices told him. Didn’t think because the voices didn’t tell him what to think. It was easy.
“Well thank you, that’s very helpful.” Draco scowled, his wand was in his robes, and he was not able to use wandless levitation magic. Right. Doing tasks the Muggle way was always such a chore. “Right then, let’s hurry this up.” Scanning around the ghastly and unmaintained buildings, Harry’s ‘almost there’ might be down another street.
Harry, ever gracious, arrived that night. Shattered and yawning but still more pleasant than the people Draco dealt with earlier.
“What? Can’t take a bad word about your owner?”
Draco greeted the house elf but she said nothing in return. Lotty kept her eyes on the floor, awaiting judgement. Well, he’d had a bizarre day, a nice day, an aggravating day and with a sigh he started what he knew wouldn’t end soon. “The work you did over the last week proves you are my favourite house elf.” Lotty tugged at her ears and tried to hide behind them. Then came the shrill cries he knew, because Lotty was never very good at taking compliments and he’d need to say it over the course of a few days.
“Seems that way,” Harry said as he curled up next to him. If he hadn’t spent the last few days avoiding him then he might have shooed him away. (He wouldn’t have, Draco laughed to himself too and he wondered if the heat on his face showed) Draco was expecting a duel at least. This was too anticlimactic and a little part of him was disappointed he didn’t know the who behind the death of Moran.
The lights flickered, hissed and went out and in the darkness Draco could make out both Ginny’s and Harry’s expressions well enough. She didn’t so much as place the box down as much as drop it.
“I just want to sleep.” When Draco almost said how he would take care of it – how he’d take care of him, Draco shut his mouth. “I don’t think the Healer meant this when he spoke about motivation.”
He blurted out, in lieu of being caught staring. “Seeing anyone? The Prophet seems intent on reminding everyone what you look like. Ginny’s having a time too.”
“Without magic?” Harry squinted. “Do you even make your own food with magic?”
If someone couldn’t stand in this shop for ten minutes, they didn’t really need the ingredients. Demand dictated the price. By his fifth visit, Draco had paid three different amounts for the same ingredients. A Malfoy did not haggle.
"Get out. Now."
She most certainly did not say those words. Grey eyes were common in the Malfoy line, second only to the platinum crown and historically filled vaults. Really, Potter knew of nothing distinction. Weird was not Malfoy. He was a part of history - a family that spanned centuries. Distinguished, not bloody weird, that was a term used on Muggles and their inventions.
Draco hadn’t given Matthew a name, no matter how much Matthews dug.
“No. Lotty cooks.” Did he have to repeat everything?
“Mr. Malfoy! Are there any ingredients I’m not allowed to use?”
“What’s wrong with the house?” Scorpius asked, looking around the ceiling. Doing his best to leave out the fact it taken a day and a half for him to return. Draco ignored the urge to scold him there and then.
She did as she was asked and apparated Draco to his room.
Harry was grimacing as he tilted his head and moved closer to listen and Draco decided then, he wanted out of here. Away from the Manor, away from all the bullshit that’d been following him for these long months.
“You’re changing the subject again.”
“Well, my father will definitely hear about this.” Harry yanked away from Draco’s hand at the scruff of his clothing, his face souring and Draco tutted, “That was joke, Harry. Keep up.” He was trying to lessen the tension. He was trying to stop the adrenaline that told him he was going to die if he didn’t do something, anything. Everything was fine, even Potter not getting his self-depreciating humour. Potter always assumed he meant the worst.
“So you knew? All this time?” Harry wasn’t angry, belligerent or insulted. Embarrassed might be closer as he fidgeted with his glasses, “You don’t--”
“How long do you think I have? Until I can’t even go outside without blowing everything up.”
“Circe,” he whispered. Curling up into himself might be dramatic, too telling to Potter if he saw it but… How was he supposed to cook a Muggle meal? How much trouble had his pride landed him in so far? “I’m so fucked.” There had to be a way out of this.
“It’s yours, your mother named him ‘Decimus’. You can still change it if you want.” Harry sat the certificate down beside him and Draco wasn’t sure he took any of the words in. Not even the certificate of authentication seemed to be written in a language Draco could comprehend at the moment.
“I know, do you think he’ll be interested in my Mittsy? She’s young, not too young.”
Something itched over his nerves at that end of that statement. Repeated. Unfeeling. Arrogant Potter was a pest but this, this reminded Draco of what Harry revealed before. A time when maybe the arrogance was more a defence. This wasn’t about the food sucking, was it?
“And you’re getting better. You’re going to a Healer?”
“Then what? What are you saying?”
“So,” Draco let a hysterical noise out, he couldn’t believe this. “You wanted to get on your knees because I looked ‘good’?” He swore because he’d just assumed Harry was like him. Well, he always knew he didn’t look at people the way most did – Pansy once argued with him he should initiate things more and Draco didn’t understand anything. Even with Astoria he’d never fell into bed before he’d started to like her, love her even. “Circe, Potter. You’re ridiculous.”
