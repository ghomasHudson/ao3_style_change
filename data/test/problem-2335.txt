Bitty rushes up to him then, throwing her arms around his neck as she rests her head against his chest.
Draco rubs his face with both his hands. Something feels wrong. Off. He can’t put his finger on it, exactly. But the ugly voice in his head tells him Harry’s hiding something, that Draco will always be second or third or fourth to someone better in Harry’s life. That maybe those cruel words that came from Harry’s mouth were true, that he does think Draco’s scum. To think that Draco’s being upended by bloody
“That’s enough, Smith!” Ginevra snaps. “Malfoy, wait, I don’t know what’s going on but you shouldn’t leave. Mia will be so hurt!”
At her tone, Harry stands a bit straighter and chances a look between the cracks of the shelves. He can see Malfoy’s lithe form, a rather large
“Malfoy?” he asks again. He’s about to poke the other man in the shoulder when he hears what sounds like
“Do you ever—ever see yourself committing these horrible acts and you just can’t seem to gather the courage to stop? You just let it happen, you let all these terrible things happen because some sick part of you is not just weak but feels deserving of it.” His voice is distant, floaty. “It’s my awful truth.”
“Planet of the Apes?” George repeats, with a quirk of his lips. “He already said it was a bloody baby, how does Planet of the Apes factor in to that?” Angelina giggles beside him.
“I will take away everyone you’ve ever loved, Mr Potter, one by one. You can try to fight me, incapacitate me and turn me over to the authorities, but the work started here today will continue regardless of my participation—there are people dedicated to seeing this work through to the end. You will be sought after for the rest of your life, the people in your life picked over and used again and again to challenge the proclaimed boundlessness of your love. You have the
,” Draco whines, though his heart isn’t in it, not when being pressed up against Harry feels this good.
When Draco enters the bathroom, he feels raw around the edges, not completely grounded in what is quickly panning out to be a nightmare of a new reality. His brush with whatever soul-sucking entity that had been born free from Potter’s grief frightened him.
say another disparaging word against Blaise in my vicinity again, I will hex your fucking bollocks off, you miserable shit,” Draco says, his voice hard as marble.
As Draco makes his way towards the door, ready to write the night off as a bust, he trips over the corner of a rug, unearthing the cold stone flooring beneath it. His heart leaps into his chest as he goes crashing into a white-sheet-covered armchair before stumbling onto his knees and hands on the rough, stone floor. He cries out, immediately lifting his left hand, the leather glove ripped and skin underneath smarting but otherwise unbroken. His kneecaps, unfortunately, feel as if they’ve been popped out of place. With a low groan he reaches out to the offending armchair to carefully hoist himself up. It’s then that his foot slips again and Draco realises that a piece of the stone flooring is loose.
Because the clothing Draco had worn during his assault was still in the possession of the Aurors, the Trainee Healer provided him with a standard black hospital-issued jumper, trainers, and joggers with the St Mungo’s emblem embossed on the front of the jumper. It’s scratchy and the material is too thin, but he’s grateful nonetheless. Once fully dressed, he gingerly sits on the edge of the bed, his movements slow from the potions and the dull tingle of remnant pain. He’ll be needing another dose soon, he realises. Before he can decide whether to sprawl out on the bed or not, the Trainee Healer bustles into the room, her lime green robes slightly wrinkled and her expression agitated. She shoves a medium-sized simple, wooden box with a small latch on the front containing thirty-six neatly labelled vials under Draco’s nose. He takes it gingerly.
“It’s healthy to be selfless. You must be willing to sometimes sacrifice your needs for the needs of your loved one, especially if you know by not doing so you may end up hurting them. It’s important to maintain open communication about these things. It’s a vital lesson not just for true marital harmony, but for all kinds of relationships. Friendships, for example,” Arthur said. Hermione nodded.
Draco wipes the sweat building up across his forehead with the back of his hand. It’s hot today and he peels the slick, thin cotton material back from his chest as a breeze washes over him. He sighs before returning to plucking out the weeds that are cropping up in his flowerbed.
As they pull apart, Harry’s eyes flash yellow, and Draco can feel the brimming energy of the wolf in him. “You better be ruined,” Harry growls, the palm of his hand gently caressing the side of Draco’s face.
Draco’s hands fist the delicate fabric of Harry’s waistcoat, his body trembling as he presses into him, quivering lips dragging across Harry’s stubbled jaw.
Draco shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the painful thoughts, trying and failing to push the memories down. He pulls his legs to his chest and buries his face in his knees and takes several deep, measured breaths.
“I know my Muggle scotch, Potter. Four years living a mostly Muggle life in Paris introduced me to quite a lot of culture and customs,” Draco says, leaning back in seat again. “It’s refreshing that the Leaky offers Muggle liquor. This is...very kind, very
“I’ll just take these to the cellar?” Potter asks cheerfully, cup still in hand and covered in soot. He wandlessly Levitates the chests.
“Honestly, love. I spent the day with him, and we...we decided to get to know each other, exclusively. He,
Draco smiles smugly at him over steepled hands, apparently satisfied with Harry’s grief and embarrassment. “Well, Potter, I wouldn’t worry too much, I’m sure you’ll be utterly forgotten. Maybe it’s time for you to rethink your dating habits,” Draco says, affecting a casual tone. “Not every person you go on a date with will be the one nor will they be someone you should sleep with. Tea?” he asks, making a move to stand.
Harry just so happens to be running late for work when he stumbles upon his distraught husband, framed in Teddy’s doorway, clutching a pair of child-sized jeans to his chest.
“Yes. Along with anything...your accomplices...may have stolen,” Harry says, eyeing Draco questionably.
“Yes, yes...may I?” Blaise gestures to the bench. Draco nods and slides over to make room for him. “Well, the strangest thing. During my lunch break I decided to secure a Portkey for a meeting I’m to have next week at the Canadian Ministry of Magic, and well, I walked into quite a troubling sight. Your Potter had his wand drawn on Zacharias Smith in the middle of the atrium. They duelled one another.”
This is exactly what Draco needs, an audience of two people Harry’s fucked to witness his humiliation. Draco can’t imagine what she must think with Harry pushed into the tall bar chairs, Smith leaning over him, Draco off to the side, arms wrapped tight around his body.
“I started feeling guilty, like, I couldn’t breathe anymore, I just, I took advantage of him during a moment of vulnerability and, well, this is it. He’s my best mate and now our friendship is ruined.”
The main area of the pub is still quiet. Hannah Abbott mans the bar, a book opened in hands as she sits by the first till. A couple of young witches sit by the door sipping butterbeers, their tittering giggles aimed at the Muggle telly above them, currently playing some silly music video. Draco slips by completely unnoticed, uninterrupted, and for a wonderful moment he relishes a
“You sent your stepson to Curse me but he fucked it up, and I was able to retrieve my memories! You had him
Potter shakes his head, his wild fringe flopping against his forehead. He pushes it back with both hands, confusion etched across his face. “I don’t know...I don’t...I feel myself being consumed with...with
“The great Harry Potter, afraid of sending little old me a post?” Draco snorts. Potter smiles at him, patiently waiting. Draco sighs, lifting their entwined hands up briefly to stare at it in bewilderment. “What is this? What...what are you playing at here? I haven’t seen you in four years, we were never friends or friendly with one another. Our strange obsession with one another over the years shouldn’t equal this, that would be...highly bizarre, even for someone like me. I know we agreed to leave the animosity behind and...Potter, are you even
“What can I help you with, Potter? I’m terribly busy,” Draco says, hurrying towards his place behind his desk.
Potter snorts. “It’s just surprising. ‘Mione taught me how to properly use one a few years ago. I actually just upgraded to a newer laptop,” Potter smiles, but it falters. “So much for it now, right?”
From the gossip that the nurses regularly indulged in, Harry was able to learn that Malfoy befriended a young Scottish man named Ziggy and an elderly woman named Lottie that was also considered mute and antisocial. Ziggy had died exactly over two years ago under mysterious conditions and his body was sent to the crematorium instead of autopsied by the local Medical Examiner. When Harry had brought this oversight to Healer Madison, he had been scolded and suspended for three days for viewing files not assigned to him. She threatened to send him back to St. Mungo’s if he continued to work on the files that have been sealed by the Chief Healer, which would result in him failing his final rotation.
“I didn’t...I didn’t know you...had it in you...you evil, cowardly fuck,” Draco says between gasps. When Smith is in front of him, sneering, he punches Draco in the face, sending him stumbling backwards. Draco catches himself against the brick exterior of a shop, a cry escaping him at the explosion of pain and the resounding
‘Oh, look! I bought some suede Gucci loafers, there goes heartbreak flying out the goddamn window!’” Harry says hysterically, his arms flying up in the air.
in front of Cho Chang-Thomas!” Harry screams, flinging the vase to the ground. It shatters into a thousand little pieces on impact and everyone gasps. Except Pansy. She actually screams.
Draco doesn’t move, though, instead noticing Pansy wrapped up in Mia’s arms, the two watching Blaise slip the ring Draco’s been guarding for the last week onto Ginevra’s finger. He watches as Ron and Hermione clap, teary-eyed and beaming. Blaise turns around to grab Draco into a hug, Pansy coming up from behind to throw her arms around both of them. It’s emotional, and perfect, and Draco’s heart has never been so full and so light in his entire life.
Draco sits up straighter in his seat, his heart thudding. Could they possibly be harbouring the same apprehension? The same secret?
Harry’s dizzy with the weight of Malfoy’s story. He’s in awe and even a bit jealous over the magnitude of his change. “That’s brave of you, Malfoy, really,” is all he can say. “Going out into a world you were taught to hate; a world you knew nothing about to make a life for yourself? That’s bloody brilliant.”
Draco lowers his legs and spreads them wide before pulling Harry between them, running his hands through Harry’s hair, down his neck, and smoothing down his shoulders. “Let it out. You must let it out,” Draco says soothingly, one hand on Harry’s shoulder, the other running through his hair. “You can do it,” Draco murmurs.
Parkinson snogs some random girl for ages, and while she does that Harry dances his arse off with Malfoy, sweat-slick and with glow-sticks in hand as the club pulses around them in a blur of UV lights, colourful dummies, whistles, and multi-coloured beads. All too soon, he’s tugged back out into the cold again by the two Slytherins. There’s more dancing in the street, more laughter, more heartfelt confessions like how Malfoy’s always wanted to be his friend and how Parkinson never really liked that twat Voldemort from the start, and how Harry really
Draco slowly approaches the table, walking around it, wide-eyed and anxious. What he sees causes him to collapse in the chair. He thought it was just him Andrews captured at the Flint property, but he was wrong. There’s pictures of Pansy stealing designer
As soon as he arrives home he makes a Floo call to Ron, still an Auror in training, to file a formal complaint against Malfoy’s supervising Auror and to arrange for Malfoy to get back to the Manor safely. Ron’s confused and more than a bit curious, but takes it all in stride and promises to work on it immediately. As he ends the Floo call, he smiles to himself.
“I’m starting to realise Potter’s a nymphomaniac who can’t respect my need for space,” he says, rolling his eyes. He almost wants to laugh as he remembers he used to be unable to keep his hands away from Potter. He’d always need to touch him. A hand on his thigh or a foot against his calf or up against his crotch under
“Well, we must be going. I’d like to show Unspeakable Edmondson around some more. Remember, take the rest of the day off, hell, take a couple of days off if you need it, Draco. I don’t want you over-exerting yourself,” Gedeon says, placing a hand on Draco’s right shoulder and squeezing it gently.
, isn’t it?” he quips, taking the bottle of whisky from her to refill both of their glasses before shoving the bottle back into her arms.
“Draco darling,” Pansy says softly, resting her head on Draco’s shoulder. She kisses the exposed patch of skin under his ear. “You’re not only too high, you’re too good for this world. Who would have thought?”
“Though, the real truth that society is hellbent on hiding is that heartbreak can be solved with a new pair of Gucci suede loafers,” Draco says, pulling out a pair of perfect, suede emerald green loafers from the
Draco moves to open Pansy’s parcel. A quick search comes up with no letter attached to the brown wrapping—Harry’s Cloak of Invisibility.
You’re so tight, sweetheart...” Harry groans through clenched teeth, his eyes closing briefly in bliss. “You feel so good on my cock like this, Draco….my God...”
“I’ve taken the kids to Molly’s. Narcissa will come back soon. Don’t fucking follow us,” Harry hisses before turning on his heel to leave.
“I’m sorry, did I miss a memo that said we were going to share personal anecdotes today? Potter, why the fuck do you care what I’m doing?”
safe!” Draco hisses as they make their way towards the lifts. Potter is eerily calm after his revelation and it irks Draco fiercely. “We should track her down, find a way to break her free.”
a cauldron shop, darling. We were going to branch into the sale of potion ingredients. It was going to be the largest store of its kind, ever! Daddy is
Teddy breaks into a peal of giggles. “Uncle Ron said naughty words!” The tension in Harry breaks as Teddy cheerfully pokes at the Patronus before it dissipates.
Oh, there goes that feeling growing in Harry’s chest again. Harry takes it with a smile, unwraps it, and happily plops it into his mouth.
What was threatening, then, is now Draco’s proof that will finally nail the Flints, with nearly every single Wizard media outlet and publication in the room. “The Flints have been infiltrating the Ministry with their influence since the end of the war, and I have proof that many of you here on the Wizengamot are involved in these treasonous affairs, Chief Prosecutor Watson included!”
“I never took you for a quitter, Harry.” Harry looks up. “My son is like me...we do not wear our hearts on our sleeves. But when we expose the inner workings of them to someone, we do it with caution, because rejection or unnecessary pain can easily destroy us. That being said, we would not have shown it in the first place if we didn’t think that person worthy of our affections. Go get him, Harry, and prove to my son he didn’t make a mistake in choosing you.”
Harry’s somber thoughts are chased away as his gaze fixes on the plump, curvy shape of Malfoy’s mouth. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen such full lips.
“Do you believe in soulmates?” Draco whispers as he rolls onto his side, pulling his knees to his chest and throwing an arm around them as he tucks the other under his head.
“It is,” Draco says, straightening up. He’s surprised at how even his voice is. “I’m...I’m going to Floo home.”
Draco laughs and tosses back his shot of vodka. He glances down at the pint. “I thought I said one drink, though?”
. It hurts that you’d steal from me, then return the cloak to pretend you never stole it. I don’t understand your logic, Draco. And whatever reasons you have will not make any of this fucking alright.”
“Have you… done this… before… with… a man?” he finally manages in between heavy breaths. Dean has unbuttoned his shirt now, hands greedily touching his bare flesh, leaving tendrils of heat behind his caresses. Dean only pauses briefly, his mouth flying from his neck back to his lips with a hungry growl, their tongues dancing. He feels dizzy and his knees buckle at the sheer force of the other man’s desire. It’s radiating off the him like a crackling fire. Dean pulls back and Harry finds himself whimpering from the sudden loss of the other man’s hot mouth.
“Fuck you, you disgusting, idiotic worm. Never find yourself alone in my presence ever again, Potter. I’ll be sure to do what the Dark Lord couldn’t with you.”
Harry shakes his head, the corner of his mouth twitching. “You just seem like a top-shelf sorta bloke.”
“Stupefy!” Harry shouts, narrowly missing the senior Flint as he ducks. “Draco, stay down! STAY DOWN!”
“YOU’RE NOT HERE!” Draco shouts, startling Padma to the point that she jumps away from his bed, the MRI scan disappearing. Potter looks stricken. Draco stares at them both, and is especially horrified to have startled Padma so badly.
He covers his mouth with both hands, stifling the devastated sobs that rattle through him, the pounding of the spray drowning out the terrible sound until he is reduced to small whimpers. The scorching hot water and lavender soap that sluices his body does nothing to wash away this pain and rage as he curls his arms around his body, rocking side to side under the spray to calm himself.
“It absolutely is. No one wants to serve a Death Eater, no matter how fit his arse is,” Potter says casually while frowning at the telly.
that despite Draco’s insistence that it’s not about what other people will think, some small part of it is.
“No. Fuck you, Malfoy. If you want to do this, you better keep your head in the game, whatever that means for you. All the way. Nothing half-arsed because we’ll both be strung up on the line if this fails or if someone gets hurt. I’m woman enough to admit that this is both brilliant and utterly fucking terrifying, but I’m ready to do the work if you are.”
“Listen, Mia, when are you going to let me take you out, make an honest woman out of you?” Smith says, grinning. Draco thinks he looks like a blond, daft pig.
What in the world was Draco thinking? The bottom of his stomach drops out as he shudders—was Draco thinking that what they were doing together was love, and lovemaking, when for Harry it was actually satisfying the soulmate connection and plain
“You’re just trying to get into my pants, Potter,” Malfoy retorts, now downing the rest of his cappuccino. “I’ve heard all about your antics from a number of sources and know exactly what you’re about.”
“Hermione would never do anything to hurt me! Jenkins is a bloody fool and got his information mixed up!”
A sharp pain shoots through Draco’s chest. Harry’s words hurt because they’re so inherently hopeful, and Draco just isn’t. He doesn’t want to be selfish, he doesn’t want to hurt Harry, and he knows down the line he will because he’s incapable of holding onto anything good. He squares his shoulders.
Harry then peers around the room, taking in the slightly messy chaos. It looks like Draco and Thea had one of their legendary tea parties, inviting Thea’s army of stuffed dragons, pygmy puffs, and unicorns to join them.
Another year morphed into two in Norway. Draco found his footing in Bergen by then as his flatmate moved on. Harry stopped writing around that time, which Draco expected due to his lack of response, but still selfishly felt anger towards when faced with its bitter absence. Draco hadn’t meant for so much time to escape him.
Their greetings are pleasant, fortunately. Draco’s pleased to find that Coelho’s even more handsome up close.
it, and if Potter is willing to join him for the ride then Draco needs to know he can rely on him. He hums approvingly. “Let’s go back to the party,” he says softly, leaning in to kiss Potter’s cheek. He takes Potter’s trembling hand in his and it feels like things have shifted and slotted together. It feels like growth.
first had lost it some credibility. When Flint and several other Pureblood families with something to lose heard that Luna was about to publish an article about the families with Dark artefacts stolen, they had rained down legal hell on Luna, her publication, and the
Draco officially mentally checks out, instead tossing back several glasses of champagne despite the judgemental looks from the people sat at his table. Announcing the remaining debs flies by, as well as their first dance. He’s had enough of this farce of a happy event and he’s just tipsy enough to not care about his manners. He snorts and jeers as certain couples pass by him. He can tell that half of these débutante are high off their rockers, Bitty included. Since the end of the first dance, Blaise has been shooting him short, nervous glances from across the ballroom.
Potter encourages a new routine, having backed off from pressuring him into therapy. Draco soon finds himself sitting in front of his Floo discussing his terms of return with his solicitor. If Draco’s solicitor is at all perplexed by his indecisiveness a mere month later, the man doesn’t show it all, knowing at the of end of their dealings he’ll be sending Draco a bill that’ll probably pay for a summer home somewhere cliché, like in Milan or Paris.
,” he spits. “I won’t ever subject myself to your games or willingly become one of the hopeless souls in a line of many to have a stolen moment with
“Merlin. What have you done to the Floo, Potter?” Draco asks, eyes narrowing as Potter tosses the smaller chest onto the one sitting next to Pansy. “Careful!” he hisses. Potter doubles over with a rough cough, pounding his sternum with a balled hand. Draco quickly conjures a paper cup, using
As the Chairwoman, his mother is in charge of announcing each débutante. Draco watches her through sad eyes as she takes the stage. She looks beautiful, relaxed, and so happy, happier than Draco’s ever seen her in his life. Her white blonde hair falls over one shoulder in large, swooping curls, her silver, crepe halterneck gown glowing in the light. He wants to remember her exactly like this.
“I never loved you, Theo,” he says bluntly. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand, his stomach churning. “This is getting out of hand, it’s seriously starting to negatively impact our friendship.” Theo stands in front of him. “What about Daphne, do you think she feels good watching her fiancé fling himself at another man?”
Bitty, with her gorgeous olive complexion, ridiculously long legs, long straight dark brown hair, mischievous dark brown eyes, and model’s physique, wasn’t too hard to fall in love with.
Potter lifts a hand to place on Draco’s knee but pulls back just as his ghostly fingers attempt to curl around his kneecap. “I don’t know. But I promise I won’t hurt you.”
Harry leaves you alone so much, and with all the babies! How unfortunate!” she cries out dramatically, her eyes widening.
Harry missed the many articles on Malfoy’s registration and tagging with the Ministry. The newly introduced ban on his employment opportunities. The laxness in protection for him from the DMLE. This was because Harry had taken a leave of absence from Auror training to get his head sorted following the end of his relationship. He wasn’t even sure he wanted to be an Auror anymore. He wasn’t sure of anything nowadays; so he’d been blissfully out of the loop on such bureaucratic measures within the Ministry.
he muses, walking through the living room to Draco’s bedroom hallway. Draco only listens to this song when he’s feeling particularly self-pitying. He makes his way to the bedroom, dread tightening deep in his belly.
The next morning Harry wakes to an empty, cold side of his bed. He scrambles upright, grabbing his glasses from the nightstand to shove on his face before flinging himself out of bed.
Harry laughs, his eyes lighting up and all of his teeth exposed. “Fuck, I missed you,” Harry says. He lowers his voice as he whispers, “
Potter starts, his mouth hanging open in shock. It closes, and a suspicious look creeps across his face as he stares at Draco. Potter then smiles at him, and Draco quickly pushes aside the strange feeling that twinges in the pit of his stomach.
“Erm, well—this played out a lot smoother in my head,” he says, chuckling nervously. He releases Ginny’s hand to fiddle with the stem of his wine glass. Ginny patiently watches him.
in the courtyard! That cat is a menace…well, just yesterday it hissed at my poor Charles. And the nerve of that man to accuse my Charles of being uncouth and unable to interact with other animals! It’s not Charles fault that he nipped at the cat! It’s in his
Several questions spring forward in Harry’s mind at Malfoy’s words, but he grudgingly refrains from questioning the man any further. He takes in Malfoy’s grey, exhausted face and his slightly trembling lips. Harry looks away.
Draco’s hand finds Harry’s again, and he squeezes their clasped hands as Harry breaks their kiss, pushing his weight off Draco to rest on his knees, Draco’s thighs trapped between them as he begins to peel his own clothes off, his glasses catching on his dark blue jumper as he pulls it over his head. Draco laughs breathlessly as he watches Harry free himself from the tangle of fabric, tossing his jumper to the side of the bed, a grin gracing his handsome face. He leans down to capture Draco’s lips once more, quickly, his fingers grazing the sides of Draco’s face down to his neck.
say or imply that?” Malfoy asks coolly, standing to shove his coat on, but Harry doesn’t miss the hint of amusement in his voice.
“Kreacher,” Draco says, now relaxing and thinking quickly. “I’m…not the master of this house, but I’m a Black,” Draco says carefully, eyeing the elf’s reaction.
“I don’t want to hurt you and I don’t expect you to understand right now, but just know that this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.” She starts to openly weep.
Draco swallows. He places a hand over Harry’s, removing it from his cheek. “What are you trying to say? Are you trying to—what are—what are you trying to say? Because, you’re right. It hasn’t—it hasn’t been that long, and I don’t know if I can be what you want me to—” Draco rushes out softly before Harry frees his hand to place a finger against Draco’s lips.
Granger, still standing behind her desk starts, lowering the water bottle she had to her lips as she glares at him. She swallows.
“That’s what she is if she’s forcing you to drag your friends places they don’t want to go, and shouldn’t, for the sake of their mental health!”
Cold dread rushes through Draco, making him feel nauseous. He closes his eyes briefly as his head thumps against the wall and his arms fall loosely to his sides.
,” she says, her voice tight. “I’m so scared you’ve turned that impulse towards something toxic...a toxic way of
The village and people of Montmartre changed Draco. He learned to let go of his anger and to openly acknowledge the pain and trauma he carried from the war. He was calmer there. He felt more rooted to what he wanted in life, what he felt he could offer to others, and what he needed to be happy.
“Malfoy, this is harassment. You need to tell your boss what’s happening within his own department.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t want to snog you either,” Harry mumbles, shifting against the wall. It’s not lost on him that Draco’s slurring an awful lot.
And the day he was born, when the nurses had allowed Harry to hold him, he was so tiny he could almost fit in just one hand.
Harry finally sits on the edge of the bed and places his hand on the creature’s arm, squeezing gently. He draws in a breath, trying to calm the riotous fear roaring in his head.
“I did no such thing!” Draco nearly shouts, his lips curling in anger. “And, even if I did, what the fuck is it any of your business?”
But their breakup had been a nasty business. Saeed’s mother, Farida, caught them together in a terribly compromising position– Saeed on his knees with Draco’s cock down his throat – in the Shafiq London parlour one wintry afternoon. Saeed initially thought his family to be spending the weekend at their country manor, so they had taken the quiet of the house as a personal challenge. They had planned for shrieking and moaning to fill each room, just not the shrieking, tears, and awful swearing of Farida. She had Draco running from the house, half-dressed and mortified at having been caught with his pants down.
“I doubt our saviour would own a house-elf,” Draco retorts, turning the doorknob and stepping into the small, dark foyer.
“I want another drink,” Pansy says, inclining her head towards the bar, now lit up with neon yellow light. “Come with me,” she says, tugging him away from Harry.
“Surely they’ll be down in Berkshire by now?” Millie cuts in, rubbing some of the remaining powder onto her gums as she looks up at Draco.
Something strange flickers across Harry’s face. It’s gone before Draco can place it. “You don’t want people to know about us,” Harry says.
Instead of responding, Harry’s hands slide off from Draco’s knees and he eases himself beside Draco, slumping against the wall, a look of exhaustion on his face. Harry tilts his head up to stare at the ceiling, and Draco watches as his Adam's apple bob when he swallows.
Milton is standing on the dais, head bent over what suspiciously looks like Draco’s leatherbound notebook. The Chamber is still and quiet. Next to Milton, Draco recognises Mr Graham, strapped to a chair and dressed in a standard medical gown. The man looks heavily drugged, slouched over as his body leans to the left and his head bobs, as if he’s trying to stay conscious.
Draco shrugs. “I had to make sure you were trustworthy. And honestly, I’ve wanted to knock you out for years, so this very much fulfilled a boyhood dream of mine,” Draco says, his lips tugging upward. Harry pauses to look at him. The monster in his chest is awake, thrashing about as affection and desire feeds it.
You sweet, naughty little thing, of course, of course! Do you, ah...need some help or advice?” Blaise asks.
Sometimes Draco wishes he had met Blaise’s father, who had died when Blaise was just a few months old, if only to see any traces of the man that Blaise adopted. It’s hard to imagine another person involved in the creation of Blaise as he is the spitting image of his mother – from high cheekbones to tall stature. Her hair is cropped nearly to the scalp, ears and long neck always adorned in the most gorgeous coral beads.
“Whoa… Gin…what the hell happened?” he asks as he tries to peel her off to get a proper look at her. Ginny shakes her head and clings onto him tighter, another sob escaping from her.
The next time Harry sees Draco Malfoy after the trials, they’re both in Diagon Alley and it’s a cloudless, humid Friday.
the love lined within this cloak, Malfoy,” Potter says pressing down on the cloak, his green eyes heated under the pale white lighting of Diagon’s new street lamps. “I reckon anyone who can cloak themselves in that much love can’t be all that bad underneath, am I right?” Potter drops his hand.
,” Malfoy interrupts, his tone full of exaggerated exhaustion. “Pansy won’t shut up about it, the bint.”
Millie rolls her eyes. “I think I heard Marcus say at the Selwyn’s that he was having a do tonight at his parents’ Knightsbridge home before they close up for the summer.”
“Harry, Harry, Harry! I’m surprised you both don’t keep a tracker on each other. Though, it’s downright scary how you two find each other in a crowd sometimes.”
“Will you relax? If there was an elf, I didn’t see one. Plus, inside of our little group, we’re still Disillusioned,” he says, a silly smile crossing his face.
When the waiter leaves, Harry reaches out to gingerly touch Malfoy’s hand. “I’m happy you weren’t murdered, Malfoy.”
Homemade and just perfect. He sets the glass down and looks up. Fat white clouds move lazily in a piercing blue sky. Sunflowers. The smell of soil and green, green grass. He closes his eyes for just a moment, relishing it.
herself when she realises you’re gone, isn’t she?” He lifts the thin dog into his arms, immediately feeling an odd protectiveness for this gentle, fragile creature. He’s surprised Sprinkles is so copacetic about this whole kidnapping thing, even going as far as to eagerly lick Draco’s chin.
“No, stop,” he pants, stepping back. Merlin, he wants to kick himself in his own arse for stopping their snog, but he knows better.
“I’m sorry I’m running a bit behind schedule, I’ll be able to sit down with you soon. Harry, if you give me a moment, I’ll bring up your - well, just give me a moment, son,” Mr Winthrop says, turning around to slowly make his way to the curtained back entrance of the shop. Draco watches Mr Winthrop’s snail pace exit in silence, Potter’s breathing loud in Draco’s ears. When Mr Winthrop finally disappears behind the drapes, Potter speaks up.
“Oh, bugger off with your judgemental bollocks,” Harry says, peering into the busy restaurant. He can see Sanaa standing behind the till chatting up a customer, her long straight black hair and open face enticing as she laughs. It had been a one-off with the beautiful woman and he wasn’t inclined to pick up where they left off. Harry’s trying to be more thoughtful about who he picks up nowadays. His one-nighters phase was on hold again, at least for a while. He’s ready to try his hand at a proper relationship again.
And so, Draco had remained in Detention, awaiting a trial for his vigilantism, a trial that will surely be skewed against him.
Draco plasters a fake smile on his face, lifting a hand to grip the end of the curtain. “I’m gay too. I promise you I’ve been called far worse.”
He had a look on his face that Harry hadn’t seen since they were kids, like Draco smells something foul. Harry doesn’t even know why he dropped by Draco’s flat anyway. The man sounded reluctant to hang out when he rang him earlier, but Draco still agreed to tea.
“What can I possibly do for you, Potter? If you have some unfinished business to take care of that’s keeping your miserable arse from crossing over, that’s hardly my fault or responsibility,” Draco snaps, though everything around him moves slowly. His head rolls across his pillow to face away from Potter. “Go away.”
“Love you, too,” Harry says, feeling terribly warm and fuzzy. He shakes himself a bit and claps his hands together. “Alrighty, Teddy, why don’t you help Draco and me pass out ice lollies to your classmates?”
“Ah. You’re quite mistaken, Andrews,” Draco starts, resting his elbows on his desk and glancing at him with a furrowed brow over his now steepled fingers. “I’m all for interrogations and searches if the reasons behind them are valid and done through the proper channels. Your attempt at strong-arming me into violating Theo’s civil liberties will not get this case solved.”
“What fucking mourning period!?” Harry roars. “D’you think two hours spent shopping in Harrods means you’ve
“It’s going to be alright, mate,” Harry murmurs against the child’s ear, bouncing him lightly to soothe his soft sobs. “You are so loved, Teddy. I promise…Draco and I promise…to
Harry groans as a shattering noise that seems to come from all corners of the room pulls him from out of his sleep. He rolls onto his back, but can’t see anything from his position on the floor behind his sitting room sofa.
When Draco and Blaise get to the beer garden, he winks at Blaise before they separate. Draco makes his way through the crowd, a smile gracing his face when he finds Harry in their favourite spot, next to Hermione. The Wolfsbane recipe has improved greatly in the last year under Draco’s research and brewing. Instead of transforming six times out of the year, they’ve been able to reduce it down to three, and with reduced lethargy and mood swings. Harry looks ruggedly handsome, sporting a full beard, gesticulating wildly as his round glasses slide down the bridge of his nose and a strand of long, curly black hair escapes his messy bun.
He’s also unable to chuck that scroll into a bin. His wank had eased some of his anxiety, and allowed him to think a bit more clearly. Tracey is obviously in trouble, and if she risked her safety to put whatever information the scroll contains in Potter’s hand, who is he to disabuse her of her choices? He was ready to head to Potter’s office to turn it over.
When he leans over to pinch her, she hisses out a “Fuck!” whipping around to nudge him in the side, her long red hair smacking him in the face in the process. “He saw me! ABORT! ABORT! He bloody
“You’re hardly missing out on a covert operation, Draco,” Harry whispers in response, carefully manoeuvring a conjured compact mirror to peer around the corner with.
. I’ll have you know I can go without your cock just fine, Potter. I survived without it for twenty-two bloody years,” Draco responds, only marginally irritated to find that the idea of not making love to Harry causes him undue stress.
“That’s basically what Flint bragged about last night, in addition to some murders and having Andrews knock me around.”
Draco thinks as he picks up his shirt, wiping away Blaise’s drying come as much as possible before donning it and heading towards the door, desperate to escape the charged energy of the room. He takes one final look over his shoulder, noticing the tense set of Blaise’s shoulders and the slight tremor in his hand as he brings his cigarette to his lips. Bitty’s laugh continues to ring in his ears once the door shuts behind him as he searches his pockets for the snuff bullet.
him! Let go of me...let go...let go of him!” Harry says, thrashing against Smith’s friends. Smith ignores Harry, punching Draco in the chest again.
“How the fuck did you get through my wards?” he asks without bite— and not without trying. He’s upset that he’s been disturbed, but he’s also in shock and awe that someone has dismantled his wards. His wards were always top-notch when they’re cast in a state of undiluted rage. Hermione smirks.
As the group of Aurors parade him through the shocked crowd of Pureblood Society’s elite, cameras begin to flash wildly in Draco’s face and he turns his head away, teeth gnashing. When the photographers begin to block them, Gibbons brandishes her wand.
Potter, too, sustained significant memory loss. After coming-to in Grimmauld Place rather abruptly, Potter discovered that not only was he dead, but that his body was missing. He claimed that even though he had no idea where his body was, he could
“They went above and beyond to ensure that I would successfully make it on my own in the muggle world. I wouldn’t be here without them,” Malfoy says, his voice going hoarse. He clears his throat, blinking rapidly. “I had always wanted to go into Healing, so they told me it would make sense to enrol into a medical programme in the muggle world, and really, that was the best suggestion ever. I spent so many years hurting people— I don’t want to hurt another person ever again. I busted my arse preparing for my entrance exams and was ecstatic when I was accepted into Imperial College. I made friends with people I never thought I would...people I was raised to think were beneath me. I met Bart shortly after, and well, the rest is as they say, history.”
“Your mouth is wide open, darling. That’s how you’ll catch flies,” Pansy teases. “Go on, then, go say hello!”
“I think that should cover our meal and a very generous tip. If you think I should add more just let me know, but I really do need to be going—”
“He’s right, Auror Potter. We should get him out of here before the paparazzi gathers courage again,” Gibbons says, jabbing her thumb over her shoulder.
“She knows that you’re about to join her, Harry. Do not mistake her tears for pain and fear. Prove your love, Harry...repeat after me:
. She’s always had the control, not only over Draco, but Blaise as well. Draco wonders who else Bitty has been able to manipulate into getting exactly what she wants and when she wants.
“Yeah, Draco, eat something. Christ, you get skinnier every day,” Tracey calls over her shoulder as she exits the kitchen with the box of tampons.
“You lot should get the fuck out of here before I call the Aurors. How dare you do something like this!”
“Merlin. You look glorious, Draco,” she says, her eyes roaming over him. “Pink is definitely your colour.”
“Enough about her,” Pansy snaps and rolls her eyes. “Now, I know you’re in a mood. You used to walk around as if you were going to be the lead character in someone else’s novel, darling. So much
“Yeah! I’m okay,” Harry says shaking himself. He stumbles forward and the taller man pulls Harry to him. Harry’s nose is pressed against Dean’s shoulder as he clings to him for support, the liquor sloshing about in his belly. A small sliver of his brain registers, again, just how pissed he is, and that he’s holding onto Dean like he’s a bloody life raft. The sense of comfort and protection he feels pressed against his friend sends a tingle down his spine. Dean’s body is so warm against him like this, and he smells wonderful—like vanilla with a hint of cigarette smoke.
And although he’s trying to regain the weight he’s lost since the attack, the sinewy definition he’d worked so hard on in the past is gone. He bites his lip, wanting to tear his eyes away from the grotesque thing in the mirror. “Look at you,” Potter says. “You’re beautiful.”
—elbowed in the sternum. This sends him stumbling backwards into someone sitting at the corner edge of the bar on a stool, shrouded in the only corner of the pub that’s cloaked in darkness. Draco turns around to apologise, but the words die in his throat.
Draco squeaks, a warmth washing over him that settles over his skin. It’s the first time Harry’s ever referred to Draco as his
“Oh, erm, what? No!” she says unconvincingly as she releases him. “It’ll be fine. You’ll see.” She peers down at her small wristwatch.
progress. The Nott Estate had record-breaking Dark artefacts confiscated after the war. Of course they’re going to investigate Theo, they think he’s stealing out of jealousy and revenge. I’m not going to let them pin this on him, or you, or Millie, okay?”
” Draco says through clenched teeth, his hands gripping Harry’s hair as Harry winks up at Draco with an encouraging nod. He doesn’t even feel Harry’s fingers working into him as his hips jerk and he comes, his vision going white as a rough moan rips high from his chest and up his throat. Harry’s mouth is still firmly wrapped around the tip of Draco’s cock, swallowing down every drop of his release. Draco falls back against the pillows, his arms spread wide as he tries to catch his breath. Like a snake, Harry slithers up his body, his hard cock leaving a wet trail across Draco’s stomach as he kisses him.
Only to regain his surroundings with his head in a porcelain toilet, blinking rapidly in a glaring bright light as he sits back on his legs.
Draco returns it. “Draco, then. I was wondering if you were in contact with anyone by the name of Layla Hughes?”
“Yes, Potter. Better yet, let Thomas go home with you,” Parkinson says cheekily. He can feel his face fucking
The Obscura Children’s Orphanage Fundraiser is in full swing when Draco arrives at central Diagon Alley’s newest hotspot, a rooftop terrace restaurant called
“Draco, my darling, I don’t think it’s up to you any more. This crazy lot will visit Potter’s regardless of what you think.”
I suppose if I’m meant to live the rest of my life in Potter’s company, I’ll have to work on learning how to put aside my dislike for the chap. I’ll start now, or, rather, once you two resolve whatever it is that’s going on. For now, I’ll continue to dislike the bastard. In solidarity.”
“Thanks,” Draco says as he wraps the cloth around the handle of the mirror, using the wide end to slide the cursed music box onto the silver platter. Theo then places the lid over it and takes it from Draco’s hands.
There's actually an AMAZING Lebanese shop (LebanEats) across the way from G-A-Y Late that inspired Harry, Draco, and Pansy's little food run. They do indeed have the best wraps I've ever tasted in my entire friggin' life. SOOOO GOOODDDDD.
It’s only when he enters his home office the day after the Hen party in search for his favourite quill that he feels anything. His eyes land on his parents’ wedding picture, the picture Draco had gifted him for his birthday. He recalls the kind, beautiful words Draco had said to him that night, and Harry can’t begin to differentiate or even control the magnitude of emotions that suddenly swell within him.
“Pansy! So lovely to see you!” Bitty exclaims. Her face splits in what Draco can honestly label as a forced smile as she quickly stands, her arms spreading as wide as her smile to hug Pansy.
But he carries on, a sort of numbness washing over him. He doesn’t quite feel like he’s in his body anymore. He’s simply going through the motions of living and taking small pleasure despite the multiple threats against him. He knows that he’s not a hundred percent present, that he’s a whispered word away from a nervous breakdown. He’s starting to carry his snuff bullet around again. He doesn’t use it, not yet anyway. But it’s always on him...reminding him that in a split second, if the feelings he’s been stamping down threaten to resurface too quickly and overwhelmingly, the magical Muggle drug will stop it.
him. The flutters are back with a vengeance, and he squirms a bit in his seat. His uneasiness from the sensation must show on his face, because Potter suddenly looks devastated.
Potter clears his throat. “Harris—Mr Winthrop—closes the shop for half an hour every Tuesday at 10:30 for me.”
“It’s okay,” Harry whispers, pulling away from the touch and from off of Draco to sit, legs pulled up to his chest. He straightens his glasses before folding his arms over his knees. He stares at Draco, waiting patiently for Draco to sit up as well.
He’s proven right when Hermione asks if they could all have a seat as soon as Draco returns to the living room.
, does exist, that you are the product of it. And you very much deserve it in your life.” Harry inhales sharply.
“You’re a terrible sap, Potter,” he says, but bites his lower lip to clamp down on the pleased smile threatening to cross his face. That’s the thing about Potter. He’s a sap and he’s terrible with words, but when he tries it’s endearingly Gryffindorish and Draco’s finding he doesn’t mind it. He’s starting to appreciate Potter’s shit way with words just as much as the long looks, the gentle caresses, and the sweet kisses he bestows on him. Potter chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners and reaches out an arm to curl around Draco’s waist to pull him in closer, his fingers skimming the soft cotton t-shirt Draco’s worn to bed. Beside him like this, Draco can almost forget the reasons why they haven’t slept next to one another all week, or why he needed the other man here tonight in the first place.
“Show time!” she exclaims, handing Draco her empty flute. “Go take your seat, they’re about to start, and I have to find your mother.”
exactly. He remembers tea with Padma, the ladies in the kitchen, flying tampons, more tea, heading to the office, Justin complaining about bloody Goldstein, and here...
Harry’s nervous because in the year that they’ve been mates, this will actually be the first time Draco will visit Grimmauld Place. He doesn’t quite know why it’s taken the other man this long to visit. Maybe it’s because of Harry’s own self-consciousness. Despite the extensive remodelling he’s done over the years, some areas of the place are still a bit gloomy. But he knows, regardless of how Draco
Pansy sighs, looking uncomfortable. “My maternal grandparents were soulmates, but it ended very badly when my mum was just a young girl. We don’t like to talk about it, it’s too sad.”
“We’re getting off course, Chief Warlock,” Watson says. “Mr Malfoy is trying to distract us by bringing up unverified, libellous, and negligent gossip!”
Draco grins. Mia stands up, clapping her hands and shaking her bum as the song changes into something with a heavy bass. Her hair is different from the last time, her afro now a mass of corkscrew tendrils that fall across her forehead. Her tight gold dress barely covers her shaking bum, all her tattoos displayed in their beautiful glory. Draco knows just from looking at Pansy’s face that she’s awestruck.
“I...I was just thinking about you and here you are,” Potter says, a curious tone attached to his words. “Isn’t that strange?”
There’s rain pouring down outside now, the noise against the window of the bathroom rhythmic and soothing to Draco as he prepares for a shower, the old pipes rattling as he turns the water on to heat up. Potter agreed to wait for him in the kitchen, giving Draco the space he needed to wrap his brain around the events of the morning, and to offer a modicum of privacy now that Potter is practically haunting him. Draco threatened to find a Banishing Charm that would work on him if he opened his mouth or purposely sought out his housemates. This early, everyone would still be asleep, but Draco wasn’t keen on testing out Potter’s supposed theory that Draco is the only person capable of seeing him.
With all he’s accomplished in the last five years – this little life of peace he’s carved out, with a career, a home, and a man he surely doesn’t deserve – it isn’t
“I wanted to pull her out, I did. Every single day staying with Marcus and his family was a direct threat to her wellbeing, but she refused to step away from the investigation.”
“Whoever told you to be yourself couldn’t have given you worse advice,” Draco drawls, taking a sip from his tea. “Well, go on then.” Harry bites his lower lip, too embarrassed to admit the truth. But he gives in.
“Just my Muggle dosh,” he whispers, trying and failing to sound indifferent. He’s become quite shit at compartmentalising his feelings.
Draco’s mind begins to race. Who are these people? Why were they murdered? WHO murdered them? Was it Edward Flint? Draco shakes his head, popping the torch under his chin as he gathers the images in both hands and slips them into a small rucksack that’s been prepared with protective magic before tonight’s raid. He checks the next small shelf and finds a battered, leather notebook with more series of numbers Draco doesn’t understand. He does notice that at the top of one column it’s listed: DMLE, and then the numbers and galleon amounts.
She shrugs. “I’m taking it all in stride. Apparently, since we’re doing the training in Paris, they want to keep the training location as non-disclosed as possible, you know, to keep the media out. That meet-up in the 18th arrondissement for dinner tonight is so misleading. They’re going to wine and dine us before whisking us away for a month’s worth of brutal training,” she says shaking her head. There’s a brief moment of silence between them before she flings herself at him once more, her arms tightening around him and her holdall slamming into his side. He hardly stumbles back as his arms shoot up to steady her. Before he can hold her properly, she’s already pulling back, the brightness of her eyes now dollops of tears caught on her lower lashes. “Well,” she croaks, “I’m going to be so pissed I won’t get a proper fry-up from you these next couple of months!” she says, laughing weakly. “But yeah, I’m going to go find my seat and pray that a pretty girl sits next to me. Wish me luck?” she asks, now walking backwards from him.
In the video, Harry’s hands ball into fists, his teeth bared and clenched tightly as his eyes fly open and he gazes into the foggy abyss of the Veil.
He nods slowly, finding rationale in her words even though his heart is sinking further into the pit of his stomach. He could never ask her to live a life she didn’t want just for him. It would be cruel and unfair. He knew that, but it still didn’t relieve any of the hurt he was feeling.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, his voice pitched-low and straining as he trembles above Draco, or is it Draco who's trembling? He doesn’t know. Harry’s eyes seem to glow in the yellow lights, reflecting off his glasses prettily.
“Ugh, stop it, Harry. You’re going to make me cry, too, and I can’t get all blotchy right now,” Draco says weakly, pulling out his wand to Summon a box of Kleenex. “Here.”
“FILTHY, PERVERSE HALF-BREED! A SODOMITE HEATHEN! A CHILD OF GROTESQUE UNION! A STAIN OF DISHONOUR ON THE HOUSE OF BLA—
” Draco breathes, his eyes growing wide as he stumbles towards the artefact. It’s emanating so much Dark energy that Draco’s stomach churns. Why is something like this kept in a
“I love you, ‘Mione.” They begin to snog in earnest, and it was not until one of Ron’s hands found its way up her blouse to squeeze her breast that she shook herself.
Milton smiles ruefully at him, and Draco’s taken aback at how drastically it transforms his face. He looks younger, playful, and even more handsome. “I see I have my work cut out for me with you. Why don’t you head on out; I’ll make sure he receives the proper care.”
“You think so? You really don’t think I can go without your crackling wit for a day?” Draco asks wryly.
Draco pulls his knees up to his chest and covers his ears, his vision becoming unfocused. “Potter is dead. He’s
“I wouldn’t want you to exhaust that brain of yours,” Draco says, a thrill running through him as Potter leans into the touch.
“Right, Smith. Keep talking like that, and I’ll have to ask you to leave,” Mia says, rolling her eyes.
On Tuesday morning, Draco waits on his stool at the front of the Apothecary, his body thrumming with impatience and nerves as he stares at the door. Since Draco started work on the Wolfsbane project, the shop stopped shutting down for half an hour just for Harry’s visit. Draco would simply bring Harry his week’s worth of potion and note down any changes Harry was experiencing. But Harry would come in anyway, even if there were customers, and linger at the front of the shop, looking through random merchandise and waiting for Draco to finish with his customers before he approached the desk to flirt and enquire about Draco’s day.
“We’ll go slow,” Harry says quietly, his fingers plucking away the last of Draco’s buttons. Draco shivers when Harry’s hands brush across his sternum. A small gasp escapes Harry as he pushes Draco’s shirt off his shoulders, tugging it away to toss aside, his hands gripping either side of Draco’s arms, scars now exposed.
St Mungo’s. She had probably handed over a batch of his own creation. He remains silent at the gross irony as Trainee Healer Meadow nods.
, instead throwing his support behind Thaddeus Davis, I wanted to kill him. But you can’t kill the Minister without a few people noticing. To think, after all the support we threw behind him after the war, he stabbed us in the back! It was like a slap to the face!” Marcus nearly shouts, his tone bordering on hysterical. “I mean, yes, the support was to save face for our family, but still. When he rejected us like that, something had to be done. So we got rid of his abomination of a child as a warning to stop fucking us about, or else we’d go after his daughters.”
Harry grips the ends of his hair, the tendons in his neck stretching and the bones cracking. He shakes his head, trying to fight away images of their child.
Draco shrugged, and Harry couldn’t think about anything beyond how in the hell they were going to explain death to a four-year-old. “Let it be religion,” Hermione declared. Better that than ruminate over the tradition of madness that seemed to permeate the Black bloodlines.
Draco calmly sets down his quill, clasping his hands together on the table. “You know that’s not true. You know how meticulous I was in creating a sublingual tablet that was the perfect balance between the Amortentia properties binding to those found in the Death Potion.”
Smith’s voice is bone-chillingly cold as he says, “You’ve always been a shite liar. It’s not in your stupid fuckin’ nature to lie, and that’s the most unfortunate thing about you. All that power and not a single fuckin’ brain cell available to make use of it.”
Draco sighs. “Everything is fine, thanks,” he says, surprised and a little bit touched by the concern.
“Draco?” Harry says hesitantly, slowly pushing the bedroom door open with one hand as he pockets the key to the lift lock with the other.
At Potter’s gentle tone, Draco opens his eyes slowly. The pressure around his neck has disappeared and Potter is kneeling before him, his eyes vibrant green once more and full of regret and worry. Draco draws in a shuddering breath, now able to properly breathe again.
Smith freezes, a slow, mean-spirited smile gracing his hard features. “So you’re finally shoving this disgusting union in everyone’s face? You really are an idiot, Harry. I warned you.”
Harry pauses for a moment and rolls his shoulders to loosen the tension building in his body. “Well, what do you think we should do?”
Pansy, has done so since they were in nappies together and she’d stolen Blaise’s binky for him to suckle on to soothe his ire. He knows that even though she can be aloof and unsympathetic to others, she’s always been there for
“Potter’s breaking your heart. That’s what you mean by the warning. Soulmate connections are very different from Bondings. As you know, Blaise, Bonds are something two parties can agree to, sometimes accidentally, sometimes by force. But that’s impossible with soulmates. One, it’s predestined. Draco and Potter were always meant for each other, were always going to end up together in their lifetime...Merlin, all the signs were always there, weren’t they? Your obsession wasn’t just an obsession. It was
Draco is about to open his mouth to cut Bitty down with a scolding remark or two when Blaise’s hand once again finds its way on top of Draco’s.
Draco decides to visit The Apothecary located in Carkitt Market first. As he prepares for the day, he’s careful to mind the bruise that’s now spread over his diaphragm, a violent miasma of Draco’s fear decorated across his scarred, pale flesh. He’s tried to heal it, tried dabbing it with dittany to speed up the healing process, but its ugliness continues to cling on, as if taunting Draco—
, even as a painful spread of heat breaks across his skin, feeling like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth, sharp and unrelenting. It’s maddening. Upsetting. It’s still not enough.
“You’re going to help her get through this, okay?” Harry whispers. Draco nods, takes a deep breath, and holds out both his hands. It takes a moment for Harry to realise what it is Draco needs, but when he does, a painful pressure presses up against his throat that's nearly unbearable to swallow. He thought Draco would never let him touch him ever again.
“Oh! Harry, Draco! Nurse Janelle said she loves my shoes!” Thea says, tapping her trusty sparkly red shoes together.
, Harry, is that for the longest time I thought that you and Draco would be great together. Two wrongs make a right, that sorta thing,” she whispers fiercely into the phone.
“I don’t want to ruin things between us!” Draco shouts. Pansy winces back, a hand flying to her throat in surprise.
Draco laughs. “Our friends have the tact of flobberworms,” he says as he rests his head against Harry’s, moving slowly to the song as he closes his eyes and allows the music to wash over him, the thud of Harry’s heartbeat filling his own chest. He tucks his nose into the strands of his hair to breathe him in.
Draco’s loath to run into Blaise and Bitty, knowing that they’re both lingering somewhere in the shadows, probably watching his every move. He forces himself not to wipe his sweaty palms on the legs of his traditional, fitted black tuxedo, his bow-tie feeling tight around his neck despite adjusting it several times before arriving at the event.
Draco finds Potter’s distance both a relief as well as a concern – it’s a weird combination of emotions. He misses Potter touching him but he’s grateful for the absence. He convinces himself the distance is all well and truly for the best.
you. We can take it slow. I mean, how crazy is it that we ran into each other today? It...it bloody is
Bitty suddenly looks troubled, a frown gracing her pretty face as she looks up at Blaise before gazing back at Draco. “We’re so sorry. Like I said that night, Draco, we don’t want to hurt you. We’ll never hurt you.”
Under Secretary to the Head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to look out of sorts, do we?” The tailor gently teases her with a grin, his German accent accentuating his baritone voice.
Hermione is standing before the window overlooking the Weasley’s garden. The mid-afternoon light pouring into the room catches on the flower-shaped diamond-studded clips pinning her curly, coarse hair up into an elaborate chignon. He finally shuts the door and slowly walks up to her. When Hermione turns away from the window to fully face him, he gasps.
Draco nods, briefly glancing out the window before settling his gaze back on Granger. It was time to get straight to the point.
When they’re a good distance from the man’s house, they both stop under a streetlight. Harry drops Draco’s hand...he hadn’t even realised their hands were clasped together while running.
And that was really all the encouragement Draco needed to go to this pub night. And in case Blaise needed a duelling partner against an irate Weasley, of course...
Draco laughs. “Merlin, I would hope so,” he says, running a hand through his hair. He hasn’t thought about that letter in ages. Draco had only sent two that first month in Paris: one to Granger to apologise for calling her a Mudblood and not doing more to stop her from being tortured; the other to Luna for not doing more for her when she was a hostage at the Manor. Granger responded with a curt thank you and well wishes. Luna never replied, and Draco figured it was all for the best, leaving that nasty business in the past and all that rot. “How have you been?”
“Yes. All well and truly lovely to know, but how does one ingest it?” Pansy asks superciliously, a wicked look of interest on her face.
How in the world she knew about his preferences, he didn’t care, but for her to assume his mother was disappointed in him, or judged him stung him more than he’d like. He knew it wasn’t true but some small, helplessly insecure part in his heart that he locked away for years comes rearing its ugly head. Did she really accept all of him? Did she ever pretend, or hide even the tiniest bit of her dissatisfaction over his lifestyle? Panic grips him like a vice, sudden and violent. Draco steps back from the portrait, his hands trembling and eyes itchy, surprising himself when a dry sob escapes him.
Draco remains silent, instead hanging onto every single word coming out of Blaise’s mouth. It confirms that yes, there is a connection between the Flints and Agnelli’s, and Blaise is aware of it. If only Draco could find out the extent of their partnership...
“I asked if you’d like some tea? You haven’t had another glass of wine and frankly, I’m gasping for a cuppa.”
“I love you. I love you, Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry cries. “I’ll do anything, just let him go, let him live -
“—Potter! Just leave me alone right now!” he nearly screams, not moving from his position on the floor. His breathing is coming out in short, laborious pants. Potter straightens up and gives him a forfeiting nod before exiting the bedroom. Draco draws his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs, ceasing in his humming. Now alone, throat tingling, Draco realises the silence around him is incredibly loud, nearly deafening.
getting sexually assaulted. What’s stranger danger when you have a wand? It’s not supposed to happen. It’s not supposed to happen to
There’s a tightness in Draco’s chest from Harry’s words and the defeated slant of his shoulders. “What does that even mean for you, normalcy?”
Draco would be lying if he said he hasn’t thought about going beyond kissing with Harry, hasn’t fantasised all day about Harry’s hands on his naked skin, his mouth kissing him in his most intimate places. There were entire days where Draco's mind was preoccupied with sexy thoughts about Harry, even when he was trying to convince himself that he hated Harry.
“Oh hell,” Draco says, setting his glass down and staring at Hermione, both eyebrows shooting up to his hairline. Harry hasn’t been able to really look directly at Draco at all tonight, what with his hair down about his shoulders and his pale face prettily flushed from the alcohol. It’s too much, too beautiful, too painful. It’s a bit like staring into the sun. “You’re not drinking, you’ve been going to the loo like crazy, and your breasts look bigger.”
open on his lap. He was skimming through Parvati’s op-ed piece on misogyny and equal pay issues for women in major league Quidditch that he’d snagged from reception before Malfoy gained consciousness.
Harry, he’s not what everyone in the Ministry thinks he is. We worked together as Auror trainees and I...he’s...he’s not what he seems, and I can’t...I can’t get to him with everyone’s eyes on me. I’m sure you’ve picked up on how Marcus...treats me. He’s always watching.” Tracey sighs heavily, angrily wiping away the tears on her cheeks with her free hand. “If he’s not berating me or trying to change the way I look,” she touches her hair, “he finds more creative ways to hurt me.”
Suddenly, another body is front of Harry, engulfing Malfoy in a tight hug in the middle of Pret. It’s materialised in front of him so quickly that Harry jumps back in alarm, not quite understanding what’s happening.
but Draco, I think you’re amazing, and I wish, I wish I could kiss you, and hold you, and make love to you. I wish I could remember the four months we spent together, the laughter we shared between one another. I already miss you, and I haven’t even had the chance to learn why.”
The puppy smacks her lips, turning her head just so on the top of her paws for a better sleeping position.
Draco leans forward to kiss Harry on the lips, a sob escaping between them as they kiss tenderly, wet and salty with tears as they cling to one another.
As she chats, he nods along, feeling for once in the last month that he’s been seeing Dean, a bit more at ease. Dean had called himself queer, explaining the unpleasant history of the term and how it’s being reclaimed by their generation. Harry doesn’t know what to call himself, but he’s enjoying dating Dean and all the sex they’re getting up to. If that makes him queer or bisexual, so be it.
to move or he’ll surely die. He doesn’t notice the dollops of tears caught in his lashes until Potter’s thumbs are wiping them away. He starts to ride Potter at a faster pace, his body trembling as Potter’s hands now grip his narrow hips. “You feel so fucking—
Draco’s quiet for a long time. The silence is only broken when he rolls away from Harry and onto his back again, a low sound that sound suspiciously like a choked sob coming from him.
“Oh?” Draco starts sardonically, spinning on his heels to face Potter. “I wasn’t afforded the chance to
Hermione eyes him cautiously. “I think you should see a Mind Healer.” Well, he was spot on. But instead of lashing out and denying that he needs one, Harry actually feels the prickling sensation of tears in his eyes. He sniffs. “I don’t think you’ve...
Harry nods, staring down into his tea. “I know. But it’s too late, Narcissa. I’ve messed up royally and there’s no way Draco’s going to forgive me.”
, definitely. You won’t believe all the kinky shite we get up to...and I thought I asked you to stop calling me the Chosen One?”
“Yes,” Draco says simply. “Harry is a ghost, Luna. And he’s here in the house somewhere and I need to help him free his body and crossover otherwise he’s going to be stuck here forever and turn into a soul-sucking creature out of despair.”
They’ve been spending nearly every weekend together these past couple of months – catching a film here, strolling the National Gallery there, grabbing a cuppa or food everywhere. With his burgeoning medical career, Draco sometimes spends close to seventy hours a week at hospital. Whenever the blond does catch a break at work, he’s either texting Harry or Harry’s popping up at the hospital to take him to lunch.
do something for your birthday!” Hermione says as she stands precariously atop a stool, texting furiously on her bright red Nokia. The back of her phone is decorated with stickers shaped like gold stars, compliments of Ron’s current obsession with muggle stationary.
“I hope the spare clothes I left out for you are alright. If you need anything else, I’ll be in the sitting room,” Harry says, drawing away from the door.
Draco has withdrawn into himself again, anxiety growing to insurmountable levels. He takes to visiting only Pansy right after he finishes work in the potion’s lab. Potter is now aware that Draco’s due at New Scotland Yard in one week and believes this is the full reason for his behaviour. Potter’s tried to corner him about it many times.
When Harry looks up at Draco, his eyes are hard and burning. “You are a dream I don’t want to wake up from,” Harry says. Draco’s breath comes out in fast little bursts.
, Potter. I,” Pansy pauses, drawing in a shuddering breath. “I need you to take care of him. I need you to get your head out of your arse and
“Me? Oh, well…” Harry starts, sliding onto the stool next to Draco. “That’s hardly important. What are
Harry had packed a couple of blankets in advance. Harry’s still amused any time he takes Draco to the cinema. The first time they'd gone together, it was to see an oldish film. Draco was so shocked and engrossed that he had stayed silent the whole two hours of
Harry gently places his fingers on Draco’s neck, the bruising now having bloomed to noticeability. “Draco. What happened here?”
“Shhh…” Harry murmurs as he kisses Draco’s neck languidly. “You know what I've been thinking? Mmm? We should plant some fresh fruits and vegetables out back.” He starts lining kisses across Draco’s jaw. “And get a puppy.” He kisses the sensitive spot under Draco’s ear. “And set up more bedrooms…for more babies,” he finally says, placing a kiss on the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Draco spends a few minutes flipping through Granger’s crammed notes, all of which expanded upon his recent findings on the Amortentia project. As hypothesised, Draco had been able to add the aromatic hydrocarbon functional group (originally named due to their sweet and pleasant aroma—which amused Draco to no end) that had been uniquely identified from the Amortentia fractional distillation. The catalyst wash he’d been developing secured this functional group to the lorazepam base, creating a new class of benzodiazepine. In his experimental modelling, this novel anxiolytic would bind irreversibly to GABAa receptors throughout the cortex and limbic system. The aromatic hydrocarbon's irreversible bond would still allow for the brain to mitigate normal stress and fear responses that are appropriate, but guard against irrational or pathological variants of anxiety, or at least he hoped.
But Draco isn’t the same person he was at seventeen. Draco has known loss, and has struggled with the ability to love while clinging to his humanity. But Draco now knows the true
Harry pulls Draco closer, his eyes closing briefly as he buries his nose in his soon-to-be husband’s hair to breathe in his wonderful scent. “You are everything I could ever hope or dream for, and you’re giving me forever...forever days of coconut cakes...” Draco laughs.
When she reaches Blaise, he tries to wrap his arms around her waist, but she pushes his hands away several times before he can enclose a hand around one of her wrists. She begins to giggle.
“Stop, Draco,” Potter intones angrily. The people at the table a metre away from them turn to stare.
Martin smiles, placing the bottles back and looking relieved and a bit bright-eyed. “Hey, good for you, mate, seriously. What can I get for you instead?”
. Potter slaps his taut abdomen as he rants about fast metabolism, gyms, running after godchildren, and anything to get rid of his excess energy as the month inches to the end.
“Take my breath away,” Draco mutters into the microphone. “You really are ridiculous, Potter,” Draco says as Harry repeats the line.
Draco looks away from Granger’s crumpled face to stare at Potter’s widening eyes. The look on his face slides from bemusement to suspicion. “Why didn’t you
“I date people,” Draco says quietly, his face stricken as he wretches his arm from Harry’s grasp. Harry knows from history that a soft-spoken Draco is an infuriated Draco, but his anger propels him forward anyway.
His best mate had been depressed and helpless the last couple of weeks since Daraja’s diagnosis. Harry wanted to do something to lift his spirits, so when the idea to surround Draco around natural earth magic struck him, the first person he had consulted was Hermione. With her extensive knowledge on magical theory, Ministry hierarchy and protocol, she had been the one to initially point him in the right direction. Harry had made contact with all the right people in the DMLE to ensure that this little plan wouldn’t breach the terms of Draco’s magical restrictions. He could use the stones at Stonehenge as a conduit to
“Only you would find a bloody phonograph brilliant, you swotty twat,” Pansy says, folding her arms atop a free spot on the glass table before her.
at their wrapped housewarming gift, the karaoke machine, placing it on the kitchen counter. They snagged an enormous, beautiful three-bedroom maisonette, the reception room was solid wood flooring, an open plan kitchen decked out with high gloss black finishes and a spiral staircase leading to the second floor. Even their updated toilets in all three of their fanciful loos intimidated Harry.
Harry sits back in his armchair, his arms crossing against his chest as he glares at Malfoy. He ignores the slight sting of pity he feels for the blond because his accusation and anger are hardly fair. It’s not like he
and Harry’s struck speechless by just how warm and lovely this all feels as he gazes into Draco’s open, content face. There’s so much he wants to say to Draco right now: how amazing it’s been getting to know him this past year, how grateful he is to have him as his rock and his voice of reason, how beautiful he thinks he is, and how very much in love he is with him.
Ahmed flops back into his seat, a satisfied smirk on his face. Pansy, her expression broken, finally allows Theo and Millie to tug her back into her seat. As Pansy begins to sob, Millie wraps her in a hug. Draco can see the stricken looks on his mother’s and Dany’s faces.
. I love you just the way you are and I will never try to change you, or put some ridiculous label on you. What even
Smith laughs. “You’re forgetting that I don’t care what you do or don’t want to do, you’re gonna to do what I say regardless.”
Harry then notices the modest, sparkly diamond on Cho’s left hand. He feels faint. No one told him. NO ONE told him Dean had gone off to marry someone, let alone Cho Chang who is now pregnant. For fucks sake,
” Potter calls out angrily. “You’re doing the exact opposite of what I asked you to do. This isn’t going to compel her to share information, she’s just going to clam up at your accusations.”
Pansy coughs behind Draco, her hand grazing his elbow. Draco shifts his weight to his other foot, the nervous ball in his stomach growing as he glances at Pansy, a grin on her face. He doesn’t know what she’s got up her sleeve.
“Oi! What’s that, Malfoy?” one of the Gryffindor shits, Finnegan, shout-slurs from across the table. “Speak up, we don’t like slimy little snakes keeping slimy little secrets.”
When Draco enters the nearest outbuilding, he comes face-to-face with Saeed and his boyfriend. His boyfriend is shorter than them both, with light brown hair and watery blue eyes. Draco inwardly scoffs. He’s a plain Jane, if Draco’s ever seen one.
“Potter!” Draco calls out, his voice brittle from sleep. He doesn’t know what this is, but something feels as if it’s slipping away, as if something
“Malfoy,” Potter says, lifting an eyebrow. “When Gin said you were coming, I thought she was taking the piss,” he snorts, lifting his pint and taking a slow drink.
They both spring apart at the exclamation. A group of muggle men around their own age enter snickering as they head towards the urinals. One of them makes kissing noises as another mutters
The young witch thanks Draco profusely as he walks her to the door much later, having helped her pick the best medicinal hair regrowth and care potions after using an unfortunate dye potion from a different shop. Draco glances down at his watch again. It’s 11:08am.
“I think every successful relationship needs to start with a friendship. I can honestly say I’m in love with my best mate,” Ron said, the tips of his ears going pink.
“Excuse my spoiled brat of a fiancée, Draco. She’s been in Theo’s infamous stash lately, but I'm sure you know how that goes,” Blaise drawls, his lips now twisting into a cruel sneer. “Among all the other things you’ve been up to lately, obviously.”
Pansy’s brows furrow in confusion before realisation dawns on her. “Do I think Potter will go to Azkaban? I doubt it. There’s going to be a whole investigation, Pensieves and Veritaserum and maybe even some plea bargaining from Smith, probably. But there were
“Crying baby, feed the baby, baby food?” Hermione offers, her cheeks flushed as Ron’s lips are pressed and murmuring against her ear. Harry looks away from them. It’s been like this ever since they announced they were trying to get pregnant. He’s sure Ron would strip Hermione naked right now in front of them all, the randy bastard, if it weren’t so obvious that Hermione would AK him for it...or at least he thinks she would...with all their PDA maybe she’d like it...
,” Hermione says nervously, her shoulders slumping. “We sent a courtesy invite to Parvati, but she declined.”
for at least four months. You were trying to help me solve my Mother’s murder as well. You learned about the experiments through Hermione and offered to help us because you wanted to communicate with your loved ones from beyond the Veil, too. I just
“You rude, sexy, selfish bastard! Where have you been for the last month! No phone call or even a bloody owl—oh! Hello!” Mia stops mid-rant, her dark eyes falling onto Pansy.
Draco inhales and exhales slowly. “Really, it’s nothing,” he says. There’s a brief, strained pause and he can feel the disquiet crackling between them. He repeats firmly, “It’s
The doors to the lift finally slam open and they step inside the crowded space. Harry resigns himself to the quiet ride even though he wants to ask Draco more questions about the little girl in yellow. He’s surprised when Draco nudges him with an elbow to draw his attention.
Her hand drops back down to her belly and she begins to rock back and forth, her head tilting back, throat exposed as she screams Potter’s name.
Having noticed his disgruntled look, Potter smiles at him sheepishly. “Sorry, it’s the best spot to Apparate to.”
Pansy sniffles, leaning back from the embrace. “I know, I just, it feels like things are escalating, what with that reward and the Ministry taking their sweet time investigating the families for further Dark objects. It’s like something is about to give and it’s not going to be good.”
of Harry, thinking it would go somewhere, believing they would have forever. But that’s not a reality. Harry only professed wanting to be with Draco during a moment of drugged delirium. And for Merlin’s sake, they professed their love for one another in a bloody
Potter’s admission causes the flutters in Draco’s stomach to come back with an ugly, painful force. He curls his shoulders forward slightly, hoping that will ease the discomfort, but all it does is make him feel uncouth.
“Darling,” Narcissa says, her hand finding a place in the small of Draco’s back after a sip from her flute of champagne. “Do you mind telling me why it’s been a fortnight since I’ve seen you? What’s going on?”
But here’s Harry, wanting Draco to show him who he is, the good and the bad. He wants to exist in Draco’s truth, but only if Draco can accept himself first.
Draco sags against the wall before he slumps down onto the floor of the shower, wrapping his arms around his knees. “N-no!” Draco shouts, heart thudding against his ribcage in anxiety. It’s not often he turns down a shared shower— not even the threat of being late for a meeting deters him —  but he doesn’t want Potter to see his useless, battered body. “I’ll be out in a minute.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, deflating. “I have to get out of here–” he turns around and blindly collides into something hard. When he collects his thoughts, he realises that he’s collided into Dean, now smelling strongly of cigarettes.
“Yes, I can see that,” Harry snaps. He fixes Malfoy with his best imitation of Hermione’s no-nonsense glare he’s been desperately trying to master over the years. “But that’s not exactly what I’m asking, is it?” Malfoy’s eyes narrow, like he’s about to respond with something cutting, when another worker at the till calls out:
Pansy laughs softly. “You’ve been gay since you were just a twinkle in Lucius’s eye, darling. And I’m so serious! You and that ridiculous house-elf of yours,” she says, holding her hand out for the spliff. Draco pulls it free from his pocket and passes it to her, waiting patiently for her to light it and puff away. “All you both did was talk about bloody Potter,
Harry blinks rapidly several times before the fight seems to leave his body. Draco doesn’t remove his hand until Harry sits back down, his arms wrapping around his body as he stares at the ground, a gnarled, unhappy sound escaping him.
“Mmm…” Harry says. He doesn’t trust his voice right now. They dance like this, cheek-to-cheek for a while. He doesn’t notice that he’s stroking Draco’s back until he stops because Draco slightly pulls back to stare into his eyes.
me. I gave up—you weren’t meant to mean anything.” Draco seems to catch himself. He firms his jaw, fights to smooth away the sudden look of terror on his face. “You have to accept this. Only one of us will leave this hotel room tonight, Harry.” Draco steps closer.
Harry holds him through it and tenderly pushes back the stray strands of hair that stick to Draco’s flushed, wet cheeks. He kisses the tip of Draco’s nose. “Shh, my love. I’d much rather spend this time showering you with kisses than taking a thwack to the head,” Harry whispers before he clears his throat. He pulls out a small, black velvet box from his coat pocket. Draco’s ring.
Draco flinches, blinking back the tears in his eyes. Beside him, he can hear Harry’s own choked sob...
my poor attempt at humour(?), drama queen!Draco (but who doesn’t want that?!), lots of kissing, so much ridiculousness
“Fuck...Smith, he’s...he’s bad news,” Draco urges, holding his fingers to his lips as he stares out in the distance, his vision blurring as his mind races. “There’s no way I can get to Harry, either, we’re not...we’re....”

Draco wonders if she knows her classmate, Susan Bones, is dead or if she thinks the woman has simply stopped responding to whatever owls she sends. He catches sight of Abbott, still as blonde as ever, still wholesome-looking, and now accompanied by a rather fit Neville Longbottom, his arm draped across her shoulders. Draco’s stomach flops unpleasantly when his gaze finally lands on Harry, Granger, and Weasley. Harry doesn’t acknowledge him at all.
He grabs the microphone from Draco’s hands and shuts it off. It’s as if everything’s slowed down around him as his eyes meet the eyes of the person that broke his heart. The backup music and vocals continues to drone on obnoxiously as Dean and Cho Chang approach him. He flushes in embarrassment. He also notices that Cho is heavy with child, one hand protectively placed on her belly as she waddles towards him.
The corner of Harry’s eyes crinkles as he chuckles, touching his hair in a sheepish, self-conscious way that sorely reminds Draco of the boy he married several years ago. “I started using Sleekeazy, can you believe it?”
That’s how Harry found himself sitting across from Malfoy at a nearby chippy, spilling his guts about his second break up with Dean to a surprisingly sympathetic and endearing Malfoy. He hadn’t at all expected Malfoy to reciprocate, either.
When Harry faces Draco, he notices the lidded cup of coffee in Harry’s hand, the other rubbing the back of his neck, a sheepish smile blossoming across his face. “Sorry, he’s a bit of an arse, isn’t he?” The smile slips from Harry’s face. “Merlin, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Draco nods before fixing the young patrolee with a sneer. “Perhaps you should show some respect for the dead.”
Narcissa gives a short nod, a sad smile crossing her face. “The weight of responsibility for our crimes should be our cross to bear, not our son's. It was difficult watching my son struggle navigating the Wizarding world after the trial...and then to learn he had almost been murdered, well…” Narcissa trails off, her eyes shining with unshed tears. She shakes herself. “And there you were again, Harry, saving my son.”
“Don’t let it happen to you,” Pansy pleads, her voice sounding small. “Whatever it is, you must fix it. You belong together. You will
keep doing this, love. I can’t—” Blaise pauses, rubbing a hand over his closely cropped scalp. “I can’t keep waiting for her to want me. It’s not fair. I’m moving on and...I know I said I was moving out, and I still want to, but I know...I know I’m not
Draco leans into the touch, craving the soothing gentleness of it. Harry’s gaze is so warm, and Draco doesn’t deserve to be looked at like this. Harry leans in to press his lips softly against his.
Ginny claps and then shoots up from her seat, pulling out her wand. With a flourish, she transfigures one of Harry’s throws into a rainbow-coloured feather boa, sauntering over to him to wrap it around his neck as she sings off-tune, “
“You love it.” Potter leans in to place a soft kiss in his hair. His chest is a warm presence against his back.
“You still carry this huge, fucking chip on your shoulder because of Thomas, and not letting it go is causing you to fuck up other people’s lives. Do you even think that maybe
, how did he miss this development? He resolves to mention this to Ginny when they’re back at home. Not the eavesdropping, but maybe just poke around to see if she has any legitimate feelings for Pansy. He can begrudgingly admit that Pansy isn’t all that bad. Over the last year he’s spent some time with her and Draco and she seems alright. She’s a bit cold, but he’s seen cracks in that exterior from time to time, cracks that shows a startling warm depth to the woman. She’s strong, and ridiculously smart, and Harry doesn’t think she’d be a bad choice for Gin, not at all…
Draco suddenly doesn’t know what to do with his hands. His palms itch. “It would be better that way. Less pressure.”
“Hey, there’s no need for threats! We were in shock!” Harry shouts after her. “How rude,” he says, glancing at Draco’s pale, shocked face. He looks away and sees Pansy shoving Ginny’s panties into her trouser pocket. She then carefully covers her tits with a lacy red bra followed by her button down, not bothering to do the buttons. She smiles widely and saunters up to them both, placing a sweet kiss on Draco’s cheek. This seems to finally jolt Draco from his shock.
The space is adequate, Draco quickly reassures himself under Potter’s gaze. It’s a nice size for a Junior Prosecutor with Draco’s reputation. There’s two soft leather armchairs placed before his large, black mahogany desk and even a small loveseat crammed between two metal file cabinets against the wall to the left of his desk. He has a large window situated behind him, though the window is charmed to show a grey sky threatening rain.
“Same,” he whispers. He clears his throat. Leave it to Ginny to always bring him to the brink of tears, whatever the reason.
, but just as troubling. For one spiralling moment Draco realises that he’s an official of the Ministry
“It’s so good to see you,” she says against his ear in her dreamy voice. “I haven’t seen you since the trials, but I did receive that lovely apology you wrote to me all those years ago last week!”
An 18-year-old Pureblood socialite and a recent graduate from Beauxbatons. Her father, Alberto Angelo Juliano Agnelli VI, was able to escape both Wars by moving his entire family back to Italy in 1978 (after several generations of Agnelli’s in England). Though not part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight (no doubt due to the family’s horrific and unsavoury connections to Mussolini’s National Fascist Party during the early 20th century), they are second only to the Malfoys as the richest Pureblood family, owners of the largest and most popular global cauldron distribution company (
Draco scoffs. None of the men who slipped through his icy exterior were worth a long term stay. “No one special.”
“What the hell is your problem today, Potter?” Draco asks, snatching the ink pot up before it destroys the album. Draco hates that he doesn’t sound entirely as casual as he’d like, his hurt spilling out into his tone.
Yes. He’s obviously having a nightmare right now; this can’t be reality, he thinks despairingly. But here he is with Ginny’s warm body pressed against him, her anchoring hand on his back, making this situation too real and so very fleeting all at once.
“DON’T CALL ME THAT! I DON’T WANT TO!” Teddy screams, his little hands pushing away Harry’s hand from his forehead.
Millie steps forward. “I can promise from all of us that we’ll only search and take the Invisibility Cloak, Draco. Are you sure Potter doesn’t have any elves? It’s not like he has a home away from London,” Millie says, her concern written across her face.
Draco can see Pansy stiffen. “Never mind what you have to live with. The most important person to me nearly died. He nearly
Even though Hermione has her powerful, burgeoning career at the Ministry, she’s come out of her austere shell in the years since leaving Hogwarts. She’s now more bark than bite when it comes to the people she loves. Regardless, Harry’s cautious. Hermione is a terrifying force to reckon with when she’s cross.
“Ta,” Draco says before taking a sip. It’s overly sweet, but Draco smiles anyway and takes a few more sips.
them. It must be. Draco must have agreed to whatever Hermione’s idea was and it backfired. The Veil―what were they doing with it? Did they
He’s mentioned to Luna in the past that his mother used to sing this very lullaby to him as a child, and he never had the chance to ask her how she knew it. Did his mother’s governess sing it to her growing up? Was it just a song she came across, loved, and learned how to sing? She never indicated that she knew how to speak Welsh and it breaks his heart that he’ll never know the story behind her love for this song. He turns his face into Luna’s stomach and bites back another sob. He lets the soft Welsh words wash over him like a smooth wave despite his still waters running deep.
love you?” she asks with a small, sad smile. “It was all rather confusing for me, but I can’t keep lying to myself, Harry, I just,
, his haywire brain supplies, right outside the platform to Brussels like the world is about to end. Malfoy looks odd in white shorts and a navy-blue jumper, a starch white collar poking out at the neck. The sleeves are rolled up and Harry can see the faded Dark Mark clear as day on Malfoy’s pale skin.
The creature hums, low and grating. Its gaze is fixed on the window overlooking Draco and his idyllic, snow-covered front garden.
“Come on,” Draco says against Harry’s lips, rolling his hips against Harry. They both gasp from the friction of their cocks touching. “I want you. Please, I want you inside of me,” Draco says softly, heat spilling across his cheeks and down his throat and chest. Harry’s eyes are glistening and gentle.
Unable to avoid it much longer and in desperate need to not think about Harry every few seconds, Draco reopens the Flint dossier. After putting out an emergency cigarette, he pulls the files from the hidden hole behind an old Malfoy tapestry hanging in his office, spreading its contents across his large table as Sprinkles sprawls out on her belly at the foot of his chair.
Potter shakes his head, his hand dropping away from his face. Despite his transparency, last night Potter’s eyes were a vibrant green, but as he stares down at Draco, Draco notices that his eyes are now pitch black.
He pulls out the wand he bought in Paris: ten inches of white sycamore with dittany stalk at its core, the handle made up of intricately carved vine tendrils. The wandmaker had asked Draco if he was a healer or a caretaker due to the strength, protectiveness, and restorative nature of the wand.
“It was a birthday present from Bart,” Malfoy says. “He was able to get Björk herself to sign the case.” Malfoy shoves the case under Harry’s nose and he notes the incomprehensible scribble in black marker on the front of the
Padma quickly makes her way towards his side of the bed. Potter, or rather, Draco reminds himself, the hallucination, moves out of her way as she approaches. “Are you experiencing pain? I would like to run another diagnostic,” she says, lifting her wand.
Draco finishes his brews of Anti-Paralysis Potions and Pepperup Potion for St Mungo’s earlier than planned. Sweaty and exhausted, he bottles the last of his creations, placing them in small vials, and situating them in slots within a large trunk especially designed with an undetectable Extension Charm. He adds a Protection Charm for good measure. When he’s done, he enters the kitchen from the cellar and immediately notices the lack of herbs and spices in the air he usually associates with Potter cooking. The kitchen is empty. Pristine. Not even Kreacher is lurking about.
As Draco makes his way through the beautiful topiary garden, he feels the hair on the back of his neck stand erect. There are several pairs of eyes on him as well as hushed whispers that trails behind him. He fixes a filthy sneer on his face—he shouldn’t be surprised that people are talking bosh about him here—he brazenly stepped into this mess knowing full well what people think about him.
understand,” he whispers, misinterpreting Draco’s reaction and untwining their fingers. “I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable. I’d still like us to be friends—”
Draco chokes back a sob, his eyes quickly filling with tears. “Can he see me?” he asks, panicked, turning wide eyes to Potter and the officer. They both shake their heads and Draco swallows deeply as he starts to nod. He turns back to the seemingly magical looking glass. The stranger eerily stares back at him, his brown eyes shrewd, mousy brown hair neatly combed to the side, and skin pale as ever. Draco’s knees buckle and he nearly goes crashing to the ground, but Potter pulls him flush against him, arms wrapping tight around his waist to hold him up. Draco buries his face into his shoulder and
Draco pauses for a moment his heart hammering against his ribcage before his eyes flutter shut and he draws in a deep breath. “Yes. I do.”
Narcissa sighs as she sets her tea down. “Draco, bless him, is a romantic at heart but so terribly stubborn and cautious. He doesn’t always show his feelings, let alone to his own mother. But I know my son very well and he is in love with you.”
...” Draco whines, his lips pushing into a pout as he looks up at Harry’s wicked grin. He watches, mesmerised, as Harry opens his hand.
,” Draco lies, hot tears of frustration rolling down his cheeks. “I don’t know, I just feel so stupid. I’m so
A warm laugh escapes Harry then, and it fills the space between them. Harry has the uncanny ability to overwhelm any and all physical space around him. Draco smiles, genuinely, even as he begins to untangle the myriad of emotions seeping into the space of his chest.
Draco shakes himself, trying to set aside his grief. His voice grows dark and grim as he glares at the man he once called his mentor. “Listen to me. I sent every department head within the Ministry footage of what you did to Harry and what Milton did to Mr Graham. Even the Minister for Magic will have a video waiting for him in his Wireless Post. It’s over, Gedeon. With the footage I sent the DMLE, if you kill Granger and I and make it look like we’re missing, they will link your two missing senior staff members, Harry’s death, and the demolition of the Veil back to you. If you keep Hermone and I alive, it will be easier on you when the Aurors arrest you for killing Harry.”
“You know it’s true. Why else would your pathetic father be in business with rubbish like Marcus and Edward Flint?” Blaise scowls down at her, shaking her wrist. “Think for a minute, my darling! Are you so determined to climb the social ladder that you’re blind to the impact the whims and fancies of a gormless family like the Flints have on your family, or
Harry hands the letter back, and pulls out a small, square object from the inside pocket of his jacket. “I found this, and I knew I had to try,” he says. Darting a glance around the park, he waves his hand over the object and Draco watches as it grows into a paperback.
As if reading his mind and being summoned, Bitty glides up to him, a large hot pink clutch under one arm. She’s donned a short, long-sleeved bubblegum pink dress that’s skin-tight and made of lace, a clunky black zipper down the front. Her choice of dress is quite unconventional compared to the ballgowns some of the other women are wearing. Draco would admire her nerve if he didn’t find her completely abhorrent.
“Mr Malfoy had every intention of turning himself in. What I have here in my hands is a copy of a letter Mr Malfoy sent to Chief Prosecutor Watson the day before his arrest to recuse himself as Junior Prosecutor from the case.”
“Draco, listen to me—” Potter starts towards him, his hand reaching out to touch him, but Draco slaps it away.
“Okay,” he whispers, looking away from her as he quickly dashes away yet another tear. “I-I’m just…I’m shocked, Gin. I—this—doesn’t feel
“You are so special, look at you. Amazing,” Harry says, placing a chaste kiss against Draco’s knee. “Yeah?”
“Hey, that’s my boyfriend you’re talking about,” Potter says, bumping his shoulder lightly into his, a small smile twisting his mouth. He must have just gotten in – he’s still in his Auror robes and his hair is windswept. They both look at each other in the mirror and Potter carefully reaches out to clasp their hands together. “Go on,” Potter urges gently. “Look at yourself, Draco.”
anymore. He wants to stand tall after all of this. He’s been so lonely, living in this dark, miserable place in his head for the last three years. He just wants to be happy.

The music suddenly stops, Parkinson changing the disc out and replacing it with what Harry recognises as Tricky’s
Draco’s nervous. He’s never consumed Muggle drugs before, but he wasn’t going to admit that now that everyone was lighting their cigarette-looking drugs. Potter laughs beside him, placing the spliff in between his lips and pulling out his wand to light the tip. Draco watches carefully as Potter puffs on the end twice before inhaling deeply and holding it in. He blows out. Repeats the process. He holds out the spliff. “Don’t be afraid, you’ll love it.”
“I upset you the last time we were at the Leaky. You haven’t been back in a month. I thought-I thought it was because of me, something I said or did. And then you rejected me, quite rudely, mind, at The Apothecary - I didn’t know what to think. But, I thought about you every single day. I wanted to Owl you, but the fear of your spurn won out.”
“Reckon I should’ve checked for people first,” Potter says, a line creasing the middle of his forehead as he looks at the door the man exits. Potter smiles. “I need breathing exercises sometimes too, you know,” he says softly, reaching up to caress Draco’s cheek. “If you really, really, want to get out of here, I’ll tell the officer we’re not doing this and we’ll leave. It took a lot of courage for you to even come down here, we’ll understand if that’s enough for today.”
Gedeon did it. He opened up a two-way portal to the land of the dead by turning the Veil into Harry’s Horcrux.
Potter nods and leaves the shop. Draco watches him go until the door shuts behind him. Mr Winthrop clears his voice.
on having a romantic relationship. We tried very hard to be happy with each other. But our last year together was difficult
He then approaches Granger’s desk, that same critical expression on his face as he scans her desk. When Draco doesn’t respond, she sighs.
“Merlin, I knew we shouldn’t have come here,” Millie says wildly, spinning on her heel and jabbing a finger into the centre of Theo’s chest. “This is your fault, getting us this fucked up and belligerent!”
For a moment, he sees Draco. He sees Draco’s wide eyes now brimming with tears, feels his trembling body. When Harry’s hands unfurl from the front of Draco’s jumper, the other man flinches violently and jerks away from him.
You had to go to St Mungo’s, which can only speak to the depth of your injuries. Harry said half your face was bruised and you had a concussion!” She makes a tsk’ing noise. “I can’t imagine the mugger was gentle with you.”
Smith laughs, loud and meanly, not bothering to flush the urinal as he tucks himself away and stands directly behind Draco. “I saw you blushing like a little whore in front of him. Like the tall, dark, dangerous types, don’t you, Malfoy?” Smith grins at him.
Draco swallows. It would be terribly inconvenient if he started crying right now. He wraps his arms around his body. Despite the slate-blue cashmere jumper he threw on in haste this morning, he’s freezing. “All I know is that this is a gross manipulation. This,” he pauses, looking around the kitchen before drawing in a shuddering breath. “This is
He glances over to the mirror and swearing under his breath, stands in front of it. He flicks the light on.
“Fuck you,” Draco says, pulling away from his touch. “What a hell of a way to tell me you never knew me.”
“Excellent,” Malfoy says. He takes the spliff from him and begins to walk away at a leisurely pace. Harry starts after him. “It’s the best shite out there. Never underestimate medical students and their ability to find good weed, Potter. We know everything.” Malfoy pauses. “Well, not
won’t end up in Azkaban, it’s my arse on the line! It’s me on this bloody case trying to influence it so you stay out of it. And that’s if I’m not brutally murdered before then!”
“So, you’re bisexual, then?” she asks before continuing, “Not that it matters; you’ll be surprised just how unimportant labels are.” Harry cocks his head to the side.
the young witch hisses, her eyes wild with shock. One of the girl’s goons lunges forward to tug him away from Malfoy. Harry slaps the hoodlum’s encroaching hands.
Harry shakes his head wildly, his thighs trembling as he strains against the binds there, leaning as far sideways as possible in the chair, crushing his eyelids closed as if it will erase the hatred burning in Draco’s eyes.
“Love.” Harry scoffs. “I’m just surprised anyone cares about how I really feel,” he says absently. Hermione turns sharply towards him in his embrace, her deep brown eyes full of pain as she stares up at him.
He does not think of anything in particular as he floats, but there’s a sudden pounding in his chest.
“Your secret is safe with us,” Bitty adds in a sweet tone, finally curling her hand around Blaise’s. “I promise we won’t hurt you, Draco. But can you say the same for your other friends?”
“Luna and Millicent will be staying at the Burrow tonight, so I will be in their room if you need me. Are you comfortable?” Padma asks.
“You said it yourself, Potter, you don’t trust me. Imagine sharing that bit of information with someone who wants to accuse you of being involved in their demise.”
“—absolutely mad. I can’t believe you think Potter will treat you differently if you tell him the truth. As much as it kills me to admit it, Potter is a perfect, bloody
Draco’s mind begins to whirl—his heart slamming against his ribcage. Blaise has never touched him like this before and he’s so hard, it’s too much.
Harry turns his head, eyes wide and vulnerable without his glasses, breath quickening. “Of course I do. Why-why would you ask me something like that? We’re….”
Hermione shuffles a stack of books to the side and pulls out the Smashing Pumpkins CD Ron requested earlier, placing it in her stereo and starting it.
Draco still looks uncertain and Harry finds that he hates seeing that look on Draco’s face, and especially knowing that he put it there.
,” Draco hisses, his gut churning. He suddenly remembers his obligations for Monday evening. “Tomorrow is the fucking debs ball. I
When Harry is in arm's reach of Smith, Smith shoves Draco to the ground, turning his wand on Harry. Draco lands on his side like a tossed rag doll, a groan escaping him, his chest aching and lungs rattling from the impact. Draco’s eyes meet Harry’s and he gasps—his eyes are black, cold, and terrifying. But even as Draco thinks this, a warm surge of magic rushes through him once more, and he draws in another full breath. It’s almost as if Harry is trying to breathe into Draco’s body, breathe life into Draco to keep him going, to keep him alive.
Draco looks up from his spot on the floor beside Potter’s coffee table, a small box filled with pictures of him, Mother, and Father in his lap. Pansy’s pinch-faced and pale. “Yes,” he says absently, ignoring her a scowl of displeasure.
“Relax. I would never ask you to do something you’re not ready for or comfortable with. But, I will ask you to keep an open mind to this, whatever it is that's growing between us,” Harry says as his finger slips away.
Now standing before Saeed alone Draco feels very sad. How is it possible to have been so close, so intimate with someone and now all of a sudden feel a million miles apart from them? It isn’t natural. Draco just wants to reach across this impossible span of space between them and touch Saeed, reminding him of all the
each other and you left it up to Hermione to tell me that you were both thinking about asking me to join this program.”
Harry’s grin is brilliant as he scoots his chair close to Draco’s, his eyes dark behind his glasses. Harry lifts a finger to flick at the bow. “Do I get to unravel you later?” he asks, his tone low and velvety. Draco’s breath catches, something hot and throbbing settling in his groin.
Great, just when he thought he could go a whole day without thinking about his stupid ex-boyfriend, Draco thinks a bit aggressively.
but yeah, me and Dean,” Harry says with a goofy grin. “He’s brilliant. We’re brilliant, it makes sense that he’s moving in. I’m so happy he’s agreed to it.”
fit,” she says, contrite, once again glancing back at Blaise with a slow shake of her head. Draco laughs. “You’re quite easy on the eyes too, Mr Peach,” Mia says, voice pitched low.
“What, you don’t like it?” Potter says, peering down at his light green polo shirt in bemusement, a small smile on his face as he looks back up at Draco.
“You could always nip around the shop to help George,” Ron offers with a wry smile. “You know he’s always in search of someone to test his new creations on.” Harry immediately feels faint, images of him blowing up and floating away like his Aunt Marge or shooting fireworks from his nose coming to mind at the thought of working for George.
Hermione shoves him in the side with a sharp elbow. Harry laughs softly as he wraps an arm around her shoulders, pulling her in close as Dean’s sensible ground floor flat comes into view. “You know if we bomb his flat, his muggle neighbours will smell it,” Harry says.
Harry Potter is framed in the doorway, his eyes widening in shock as he stares down at Draco huddled into the far corner of the W.C..
Draco thinks back on his last argument with Pansy with an inward, bitterly triumphant laugh. Pansy has little faith in him. He most certainly can keep things the way they are. He can still be a good boyfriend without Potter being none the wiser to that horrible night back in February. He makes up his mind then.
Draco sags slightly into himself. He’s been so adamant about keeping this recreational habit separate from work and family, until he found himself high almost all of last week to ease his anxiety. Barbara had entered his office with a cart of Wizarding Law texts from the 17th century floating behind her so Draco could provide one or two cases as precedential references for the Chief Prosecutor’s upcoming case. The research had been daunting, and the Muggle drug helped him carry his focus well into the night.
He also doesn’t miss the encroaching fake smiles from people that appeared more exhausted than him. The barista’s cheery tone belies the purplish bags under her eyes, and on such a shit day, the whole shtick is just too miserable, and ruins the pleasant morning Draco spent strolling the Museum of London. Merlin, he would have rather been faced with a grunt or a small scowl over a painful display of pulled parted lips.
“—Get the bloody fuck off my property, you fucking bellends!” the man roars, lifting the crowbar high above his head. “I don’t give a fuck
Draco reaches into his back pocket to pull out the red Muggle bow Harry sent in via owl yesterday. Draco flings it at Harry, who catches it against his chest.
“Mmm…your heart rates a bit fast, are you sure you’re alright?” Draco asks after a few beats. Harry clears his throat and wrenches his arm away from the other man’s grasp.
I’ve lived in this building since it first opened five years ago. Bart was the only person to own the penthouse. I own the floor beneath it, by the way. It was a
The theme is ugly Christmas jumpers, Harry had decided to wear one with a rather manic-looking snowman on the front, but in true fashion of bending the rules, Pansy is dressed in a red bespoke skirt suit with two glittery devil horns perched on her head. He doesn’t miss the black plunge neck vest she’s wearing underneath the stylish blazer, showing off the swell of her ample breasts. He’ll be maintaining eye contact with her for the duration of the party, lest she AK’s him in a drunken state.
Draco does as he’s told. He flicks the top button of his trousers open and then slowly drags the zipper down. He wiggles out of his trousers and then his pants, kicking them off the bed. He shivers slightly, the air hitting his naked body.
“Excellent,” she says, hopping off the stool and extending a hand to the tailor which he shakes enthusiastically. She then steps towards Harry,  grabbing her bag from his lap. Before he can scramble to his feet, she disappears behind a thick curtain leading to the front of the small shop. He glowers at her retreating form and follows her to where a tall witch behind the till slips her the Ministry-paid receipt for her new robes. She gives the employee a jaunty ‘
“I’m starting to think this is personal,” Draco mutters to himself. He starts when he hears a snort beside him. Potter has been sitting beside him silently this entire time.
Dean leans in and kisses Harry again, hard. He’s consumed with fear, excitement, and confusion, as his arms curl around Dean’s neck, hunger rushing through him in a lovely combination of danger and wickedness. It feels fucking amazing. Dean’s mouth is sinful against his and soon all his blood is rushing south.
“Brilliant!” Potter says, his eyes dancing. “Just a moment, my vision-corrector charm is fading.” He lets go of Draco’s hand and heads down the hallway.
Too shocked by what he had found to just leave it there. He made the decision after leaving that office not to mention the documents to his friends, he would hate to involve them in this if it turned dangerous.
When Draco finishes with the last child, he straightens up once more, fixing Mrs Pumpernickel with a frozen smile. An idea strikes him.
The Aurors refuse to give him a moment of respite, instead dragging Draco from the damp, stone cell that’s been his home in the Ministry’s Detention Area on Level Ten for a little over a month now. Marcus, Andrews and Edward may not have been able to murder Draco on the 31st because of Bitty’s interference, but they've been able to keep Draco in solitary confinement for a month now despite efforts to get him out. They'd wanted to keep Draco caged, broken, and most of all, silent.
“Er…Sure,” Potter says. Draco closes his eyes, picturing the confused and dejected look on Potter’s face.
“Oi! Cheers, Malfoy!” Finnegan says as he pockets his wand and tosses back the shot Draco bought him, his boyish face is flushed and wielding a cruel smile. Blaise, who looks like he’s considering an Azkaban sentence to use an Unforgivable on Finnegan, begins to get to his feet. Weaslette, who is staring at Draco with pity, places her hand on his elbow to stop him.
“Oh!” Harry exclaims, feeling silly. He rubs the back of his neck, a small smile gracing his face. “I mean, yeah, of course. We’re mates now, why not?”
Simmons is about to respond when the exiting Chief Warlock Mormont stands, his wand pointed at his throat as he coughs several times.
These last several months Mother has been in high spirits after finalising her divorce to Lucius all while enjoying her engagement. After twenty-five years of marriage, one child, an unrecognisable sex life (as Mother has stressed to Draco numerous times that she is still
but only because I have something quite extraordinary to brag about as well,” Draco says, reaching into his back pocket. He pulls out a green, plastic Muggle bow, the kind they use for Christmas presents. Draco peels the paper back on the sticky part and tacks it onto the front of his shirt. “Me, with a big green bow on top.”
“That man is seven ways from hell in love with you, Draco, you can’t be this daft. Potter will support you through your pain. You both can figure it out together.”
Draco decides he wants to be on top so he can control the pace. As he straddles a wickedly grinning Potter, who continues to knead the top of Draco’s thighs, Draco leans forward, lubes up two fingers, and presses them inside himself to make sure he’s properly open. He reaches behind himself to take a hold of Potter’s lubed cock. He bites his lower lip, hard.
Saturday nights out in Diagon were usually reason enough to dress up, but Draco wanted comfort over anything else tonight. He donned fitted black trousers, a simple black button down, and black bow tie.
Draco holds his breath, his thoughts turning to the rather important memory he’s yet to share with Potter. He wonders if keeping that information to himself counts as deceptive and if it’s enough to set off the gadget, marking Draco as untrustworthy and solidifying all of Potter’s concerns. He’d rather not find out. With his cool mask of indifference in place, and his shaky, prickly emotions carefully sorted and precariously stored away, Draco swings back around to face Potter, feeling confident enough to tell Potter what he knows.
“I don’t think I can have the same conversation one more time,” Draco says exasperatedly, now connecting the dots behind Pansy’s comment.
It feels like hours have passed until Draco can finally draw in a full breath, his body trembling. He shakes his head one more time, trying to clear his thoughts, his breathing rapid. “I’m okay, I’m okay…caught off guard...”
“At every turn in this case, you’ve blocked me from doing my job,” Andrews accuses. “Harry may have his head up his arse about you, but I don’t. It’s almost as if you don’t want us to save you and your sorry arse Pureblood community!”
—,” Draco cries, fingers curling at the back of Harry’s Auror robe. Harry sharply spins around, grasping Draco’s upper arms. Draco freezes as Harry shakes him, his stomach twisting as he’s reminded of the last person to shake him this way.
The Agnelli’s name isn't in the ledger, though. The only connection is the appointment of Hilde and Susan’s polaroid. And what about Watson? Surely the Chief Prosecutor would rain hell on the Ministry if he knew his baby brother had been brutally murdered...or was he somehow involved in the murder and its subsequent coverup?
When Harry Apparates back into the house, he lands in the smoke-filled kitchen. A slash of his hand clears the smoke and the ruined dinner as he continues towards the only loo down in the kitchens.
Harry starts a fire, not at all watching Draco look around the house, his mouth in a shape of an ‘o’ as he slowly turns in a circle. Harry diverts his eyes when Draco finally faces him.
To his surprise and relief, the mob of people slowly begin to disperse with looks of shock and betrayal on their faces. He could hardly be bothered to care about their dejected feelings as he removes the protective shield to once again assess Malfoy’s injuries.
The Aurors caught the stranger with assistance from the Muggle Aurors – the police. He was required to come down to the place called New Scotland Yard to arrange for an official police identity parade in one week. He feels—well, he doesn’t know how he feels. He should feel elated by this, like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders thanks to Potter. But he doesn’t feel anything. He places the letter back down, feeds the owl a treat and watches as it takes off through the open window. He shrugs the letter off, entering the kitchen to throw together lunch. He eats a salad in relative peace, flipping through
Harry had been surprised, too. As Ginny’s Bridesman, he had stood behind her and gasped when Celestina Warbeck walked onto the raised platform. He shot a look over to Draco, who was standing directly behind Pansy and had an equally shocked expression on his face.
Draco blinks several times, trying to soothe the pain in his eyes. “And-and w-what if you can’t come
They had been happy, happier than they’d been in years, especially after losing Father his first week in Azkaban. Mother had enjoyed living in the States, but came back to Magical Britain and the Manor because Draco decided he wanted his Healer qualifications. It had been a normal evening in the West End. His mother enjoyed travelling out to Muggle London on the weekends for a late dinner, after all, they lived a mostly Muggle life in Boston. It had been dark and they were laughing, peering at displays in darkened shop windows, vowing to come back the next day for this item or that. Draco noticed the man too late; they were already on an empty, narrow side street off the high road when the barrel of a gun was shoved in Draco’s face.
Harry runs a hand through his hair. “I highly doubt you deserve half of what you think you do. And Draco—you are
“Draco, are you okay?” Potter’s voice is rough with sleep but his eyes are alert and lit with concern, mane of hair a wilder mess than usual and face free of his glasses. He’s always been fond of Potter’s look after waking – rumpled, soft and oh so kissable. A warm feeling of affection washes over him.
“And I asked her to go steady with me.” Arthur said, wrapping an arm around Molly’s shoulders. She leaned into the embrace and placed a hand on his chest. Arthur kissed her softly on the lips. “The whole night was worth the scolding I got from Pringle.” Molly giggled.
“You’re down here, aren’t you?” Gedeon says, his hands clasped in front of him as he smiles at Harry. “My, I think this is the first time I’ve actually seen you up close. Not bad, no wonder Draco is so smitten with you.”
Harry cries out, not giving a fuck who hears him professing his love for Draco Malfoy. He wants to shout it from the rooftops!
is the guy who’s stolen you away from us, Draco?” And Draco would smile and coyly nod his head. It made Harry’s heart pound against his ribs with excitement. It made him think that
“So imagine my surprise when I was faced with resistance trying to withdraw my residency completely from the Magical world. I even offered to relinquish magic for the rest of my life, and the Ministry still fought against me. One would think that they’d go above and beyond to ensure that they’d never need to see my face again, but no, they fought me on every request I made — translating my NEWTs, changing my place of residency, my Statement to Ensure Secrecy within the muggle world — all of it. They wanted me to stay locked away in the Manor to rot. There was one person, however, who saw that I was being stonewalled and decided to...help. I still don’t know
“Yes, Draco.” Harry’s voice is melodious in his head as his hand begins to work his cock. “You’re doing so well, darling. You’re so beautiful, Draco.”
. The audacity of him—Potter seems to be jumping to conclusions without his explicit input for everything now. “
” Draco pauses, his chest aching as his eyes prickle with hot tears. “I never stopped loving you, I hope you know that...and I’m home. I’m
. Draco happily nurses a glass of champagne, revising his work week’s to-do list in his head near the stage, when he’s startled out of his thoughts.
Draco abruptly stands from his seat, startling Harry. Draco doesn’t pay him any notice as he stretches his long, rail-thin body before strolling up to the nurse’s station. He taps on the glass divider several times before Nurse Mathilde slides the panel open.
“Mine. Yours,” Harry responds, kissing him again, more firmly this time. Draco can taste himself on Harry’s tongue, the thick, salty taste shooting to his oversensitive, spent cock. “How do you feel?” Harry asks.
“Yeah, yeah…I’m just a bit surprised, s’all. It’s no big deal. You know, it was like a catharsis. I looked death in the face again, but instead of just dying and coming back, I shook its hand first this time, and now I feel great. I feel fucking great. OK, how about this karaoke machine, eh?” he asks, glancing over at Draco’s horrified expression.
They make it through the chaos that is the paparazzi and soon enter the ballroom to enjoy an aperitif while Tracey’s father and mother, Thaddeus and Tiana, introduce tonight’s performance of Bellini’s
Just then, there’s a rattling at the Shafiq’s front door. They all tense. A small, white panel appears in the corner of the majestic front door which then slides open.
“We’ll have to get Uncle Ron to put a knut in the Swear Jar the next time we have him over,” Harry says. His heart clenches painfully, and for once in a very, very long time, he feels like a coward. He reaches out and pulls Teddy to him, wrapping the small child into a fierce hug before kissing his forehead.
“You don’t have to lie to me about this, I’ve been watching you, I’ve seen it,” Potter says softly. “Hell, Draco, I’ve
Once outside, they stand close to one another on the cobblestones. Harry takes a moment to fully appreciate Draco awash in the bright streetlight. He’s insanely gorgeous in his form-fitting burgundy tuxedo unconventionally paired with a black roll neck, his long blond hair swept back from his face in an artfully messy half-up-half-down hairstyle. They can still hear the crowd behind them counting down. Harry’s surprised when he feels Draco’s warm hand close around his own. He glances down at their clasped hands before lifting a questioning gaze to Draco’s softly smiling face.
Draco shoots him a quizzical look. Potter’s face is much too distracting without his glasses as a barrier. It leaves him too vulnerable, his eyes two bright green pools of lava consuming all of Draco’s attention. “I don’t understand,” Draco replies.
“Harry told me you were mugged a couple of weeks ago. That must have been so traumatising. Why didn’t you report it to the Aurors?” she asks, taking a bite of her side salad, thankfully, not noticing he’s spilled some of his tea on his robes at her question. He quickly grabs his wand to spell it away. Her face twists in disgust, still staring down at the salad in shock as she slowly places her fork down. “Oh, this is awful,” she murmurs. “There’s no way I can eat this.”
Harry’s facing away from the door, his hand pressed against the fly of his jeans, as a laugh escapes him. “You have impeccable timing, apparently,” he jokes, voice strained.
Draco is pacing around his sitting room to calm down when Hermione shows up in his Floo, a bright blue folder filled with parchments in her hands. He flushes when he realises he left his documents behind in the canteen.
Oh, she’s something, Draco thinks as he reaches over the bar to take her hand. “The pleasure is certainly all mine, Miss Burke. Draco Malfoy at your service,” he says, turning her hand over and leaning in to brush a kiss against her knuckles.
“Er, I’m sorry Malfoy, I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable,” Potter stands, his hand once more rubbing the back of his neck as he frowns. “I just thought you could use some company. I can get that it’s a bit overwhelming out there, but if you need a moment or two, I’m going to wait outside this door for a few more minutes. If you open it before I leave, I’d love to grab a beer from the kitchen with you. If not, well, maybe you’ll come ‘round later and find me for that beer.” Potter shrugs. “No pressure.”
“I also wouldn’t want you to have to tell your boyfriend that you were forced to snog another man at a birthday party,” he says, hoping it doesn’t sound too bitter.
“And now we’re getting married. We have this incredible coconut cake,” Harry says, smacking his lips. “Can’t wait to get a piece of that.”
Potter, who had been shucking off his damp jacket snorts. “I’ve only been here once and I’m pretty sure she wasn’t working the front.”
“He’s queer?” Ginny asks, excitement once again in her voice. Harry nods. “Well, well, well, Malfoy. Welcome to The Family,” she giggles before ceasing and shooting him a suspicious, narrowed glance. “
The crude question hangs between them and Draco stares at him, his mouth slightly open and his eyes furiously cold. Draco then, very carefully, steps up to him, using his few inches in height against Harry as he glares down at him, breathing heavily through his nostrils.
Mia wraps an arm around her shoulder, tilting her head forward as she says, “What she means, mate, is she’s being an utter bitch and is so soz. Don’t mind her—”
In three quick strides, Harry is in front of him, landing on his knees, his gaze hard and piercing as he stares into Draco’s face.
Draco’s skin is on fire again as he tilts his chin up, his nose bumping against Harry’s as they come together in another kiss, softer this time, more explorative. Draco’s anxiety bleeds away, a calming peace settling over his thoughts as he wraps his arms around Harry’s neck.
without having to lift a finger is exhausting work, poor you! I guess I can spare you from an even bigger head.”
it,” he says in his gravest of voices. Potter nods, his lips petulantly pursed as if he wants to retaliate. With this concession, Draco knows his decision will be respected. Draco sometimes wonders how he landed Potter, he’s so foolishly trusting, compassionate, and respectful. These are all attributes Draco surely doesn’t deserve to have in a boyfriend, let alone be showered with daily. This is something he mulls over a lot – his kismet will go off the rails. Draco doesn’t know for how long he’ll have Potter, but right now he knows he wants him, has always wanted him, and can’t see ever going off him.
“C’mon, I want you up here,” Harry says, his chin jutting towards the wall where several lush, comfortable pillows rest. Draco grins lazily. He uses the strength of his arms and legs to push himself up the bed, pressing himself against Harry’s pillows. With a dizzying speed, Harry is on him, his weight comforting on Draco’s thighs. Draco moans, his thoughts racing, desperate, hungry.
Draco sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. He’s been over this with Andrews before. He’s kept this bit of information from his friend, afraid to send Theo into a panic. He suspects that Theo’s opened his fat mouth about the robberies if he’s to believe Bitty and Blaise. He can’t imagine what Theo would do if he found out some of the Aurors in the break-in case wanted to finger him as a suspect because of his family’s history. Draco has explained to Andrews and his little crew of supporters that Theo’s estate, which rightly had the largest number of Dark objects pre-war, had everything removed even before the debris settled over Hogwarts after the battle. Despite this explanation, Andrews continues to mention to every Auror who’ll listen his suspicions, and Draco is tired of providing proof to the team that his friend is clean. He already has a massive headache blossoming and Andrew’s voice is just increasing the pressure building up in Draco’s head.
It would be so simple for Harry to snatch the candelabra at his feet and swing it at Draco’s head. Or lunge at the shaking man in order to wrap his hands around his long, thin pale neck. Or push him to the ground and into the fire.
it to be, and it drives him fucking crazy. The room starts to spin and he stumbles over to the bed, leaning against the footboard for support, waiting for the world to right itself, but it doesn’t and he finds himself on the floor, landing roughly on his bum. He feels as if he’s in a tailspin, rapidly heading towards rock bottom without knowing how far the drop is. It feels endless and he’s crippled with fear.
Recognition crosses Pansy’s face as she takes the spliff away from Draco, tucking it into the corner of her plump lips for her turn to puff away at. Draco wonders how her lungs haven’t burnt up yet. “Oh, yes. She was quite fit, wasn’t she?”
Pansy tenses. “Fuck Blaise and his nouveau-riche teen-bride, Draco. He’s been a bigger arse than usual and he’s becoming just as creepy as Bitty!” she says on an impassioned puff of air. It’s as if she’s been holding in that insult for ages.
Harry’s hand steadies him. “Wait, please. I think you’ve had too much to drink. Please, let me take you to the bar to get a glass of water. I just - I just want a few more minutes of your time, and I’ll let you go,” Harry says, running a hand through his messy hair. “Not forever, just for tonight. I’m going to fight for us, Draco.”
He had arrived on his own but waited kerbside for Pansy, his mother, and Dany to arrive. The lustrous curved driveway of the Davis estate boasts a velvet red carpet entryway for the guests to arrive on, and Pansy steps onto the carpet looking like a runway model with her black fur coat. She slips it off and hands it to a valet as society page paparazzi clad in Muggle clothing snap photos of her now exposed pale bare arms and shoulders. Her exquisite, avant garde strappy black dress nearly touches the ground, her red-bottom black stilettos peeping out from underneath the jagged hem.
Draco quirks an eyebrow as he crosses his arms against his chest. He props himself against the door jamb, tilting his head towards the door. “It’s me, Granger, open up.”
Mia has the nerve to look incredulous as she makes her way around the bar. Once there, she draws out a short, stubby wand from the sleeve of her dress to float down a bottle of Firewhiskey from the top shelf.
Half of the bed is covered in clothing, books, candy wrappers, and what is definitely his vibrating mobile phone buried somewhere underneath the mess.
Granger visibly swallows several times as she lowers her hand, a small frown gracing her lips as she stares forlornly at Draco. “
—I was bloody taking the piss, Hermione!” Ron exclaims, nursing his bicep. Harry flinches in commiseration – Hermione’s quite heavy-handed when she pinches. Ron looks over at him, the tips of his ears reddening.
“Hey!” Hermione says, punching him lightly on the arm as everyone laughs. Her protests are silenced when Ron leans forward to pepper kisses across her face.
He’s reminded of the night he moved in, Pansy’s warning lingering in the back of his head and Potter’s question –
“He has a right to be angry, Ginny, er...sorry, Malfoy,” the Patil girl says, quickly glancing over at him. “Lee and Fred were best mates.”
Draco draws in a rattling breath. He wants to tell Harry he loves him too, that none of this will ever be his fault, that he’s sorry too, sorry for believing the worst. Sorry for not having had more time to love him, to take care of him, to be his soulmate.
Draco holds up Harry’s wand, points it at Harry’s face. “If you betray me, Potter, you’ll regret it. We’ll get in that fancy car of yours and you’ll drive until I say stop. If you do anything to prevent me from getting these files to the right people…if you try to get help from the Aurors or let your friends know what’s going on, I’ll off myself. And this bond here, this bond will take you with me. I’m the only one that knows the counter, and once we get to my final destination, I’ll release you. So, don’t you dare fucking try me.”
, let’s his wanton, wild moans and cries fill the space of the room as Bitty sucks him and Blaise plays with his nipples, sliding his long hard length between the globes of Draco’s arse, catching on his rim.
apologise to Draco, Teddy. I know you’re angry that we won’t let you wear your dress-up clothes, but when you’re angry there are other words you can use besides the word
“For giving me our beautiful children. For seeing me when I couldn’t see you.” Harry hesitates before finishing, his gaze searching. “For still loving me.”
said yes. I asked her if that makes her feel happy, she said yes, and then I told her I was happy for her.”
Blaise is slow dancing with Ginevra on the small makeshift dance floor, Weasley and Granger nowhere to be seen.
“You shouldn’t Apparate, Harry. You’ve been drinking!” Seamus calls out. Dean looks alarmed and Parkinson is smirking.
Draco’s face, dark with suspicion, slowly starts to slide towards something lighter. He bares his teeth. “I hold onto the wand. You’re not allowed to touch me, period, or else I might get the wrong idea that you’re trying to get your wand back, and I don’t want to have to hurt you, or worse, hurt myself.”
“No,” Malfoy interrupts him, shaking his head with a moue of discontent. “And we don’t have to do this. I accept your apology if this means we can stop talking about it. I wasn’t a shining beacon of innocence at the time, either.”
“I said get the fuck out, Nott!” Potter hisses, pushing Theo away from Draco. Theo purses his lips, eyes narrowing as he glares at Potter, but he says nothing as he turns to leave the kitchen.
. Draco would be lying if he said he never thought about getting to know Potter or what it would be like to kiss him. He found that Potter clouded most of Draco’s thoughts during puberty, and then, during the trials, when Potter had spoken up for his leniency, Draco found that under his gratefulness for Potter, there was still that boyhood crush resting there, dormant, waiting to go nowhere. And now? Now Draco wonders if it finally has a place to go.
, Potter. She,” Draco swallows, trying to ease the sudden pain in his throat. “She means more to me than your stupid life or death situation ever will. Never push her like that again.”
Draco rubs his chin. He’s in agreement with Millie on Pansy shutting up. He doesn’t entirely understand or care for Pansy’s bizarre comments right now, but she and Millie have always been the best of frenemies. Millie’s a fiercely intelligent force to be reckoned with and was always popular in the Slytherin common room, despite her blood status and Pansy’s attempts back then at sabotage. With her full figure, clear heart-shaped face, and long jet-black curls, she’d always been the target for Pansy’s cruelty and petty jealousies as kids. He thought she’d grown out of that kind of behaviour.
“Oh fuck. I can’t believe we’re doing this!” he whispers with a shake of his head as they stand before Dean’s flat. The exterior is a walk-up painted in bright white over brick, the door painted a sky blue. An empty, completely concrete front garden between the front door to the kerb. The rubbish and recycling bins are shoved against a short brick wall separating this building from the next. Hermione looks up at him with a wicked smile.
Bitty makes a sharp gasp against Blaise’s lips, her hands flying up – one coming to rest over the hand wrapped around her neck, the other to rest on Blaise’s shoulder as his free hand begins to unzip the front of her short dress.
It’s not until he’s in front of Goodge Street station that he feels mentally capable enough to call Ginny.
doing here?” Harry lifts a finger into the air, drawing the attention of the bartender. He taps the rim of Draco’s glass twice. The bartender nods, grabbing the 25-year-old Macallan from off the shelf as well as a clean, empty glass. He pours two generous fingers and sets it before Harry, then refills Draco’s before walking away. Draco hastily brings the glass to his lips, his hand trembling. He tosses half of the contents back. It is so out of character that Harry flinches before quickly recovering.
He tips head first into Dean’s wide, sincere dark brown eyes. Something melts inside of him at those words—those words that he’s
Malfoy’s left eye perceptibly twitches. He scowls at him, shapely pink lips exposing teeth, the look a mixture of rage and hatred.
In addition to these warnings, there are endnotes on chapters one, three, and five, as well. Please. Your mental health is important, so please do not read/stop reading if this may trigger you. This is very much Draco’s journey
“Oh, absolutely,” Draco agrees as he bumps his shoulder against Harry’s. “She definitely likes you. It’s only a matter of time before she has you round the flat for tea and a spliff.”
Still standing, Jordan looks over at Draco, his dark eyes ablaze, mouth turned down in disgust. “I’m outta here,” he says, grabbing up his jacket and heading towards the door.
“It’s great,” Draco says, taking a sip from his champagne flute. “What are you going to do about it?”
Potter steps on, hair a wild mess atop his head, his very green eyes growing wide behind his ridiculously round glasses. He isn’t in his Auror regalia, instead wearing a white shirt, the top button undone, and the sleeves pushed up. His black trousers are fitted just tight enough that Draco finds himself appreciating Potter’s arse, and his tall black boots are no doubt dragonhide. A beige leather wand holder is looped under his arms. Loaded on one side is his wand, the other glints with an intricately carved handle of what Draco assumes is a knife. Even with the casual fit, Potter looks positively dangerous, feral, even.
Draco is not at all surprised at how little it takes to needle Potter to the limit of his patience, even after an apology for the very issue.
Once out on the cobblestones, Harry breaks into a run, heading towards the south side of Diagon Alley to get to the main offices of the
suggest to everyone that they offer him up to Voldemort like some prized pig. He’s long since forgiven her for it (and apparently so has the rest of the Wizarding World), but she doesn’t need to know that.
Draco lunges towards him, venomous anger rippling off him in waves, his teeth gritting together as he hisses in Harry’s face. “I have you strapped to a chair, about to end your fucking life, and you still think it’s necessary to lie to my fucking face?” Draco spits, “I deciphered your kill sheet! You just thought, well, now’s the time to fuck Malfoy before I do away with him—”
“We’ll do no such thing, Potter. I’m nowhere near drunk enough to snog you. And I saw you snacking on those horrid cheese and onion flavoured crisps Pans put out—”
It’s a sweet suggestion, but Draco shakes his head. He still can’t believe they do this. In the few weeks that have gone by since Harry returned from his mission, they’ve developed a pattern of sorts. They sit together, eat together, read together, and yes, even hold one another after heavy petting and snogging. Draco’s been in a lovely daze, enjoying the way Harry makes him feel alive when they’re together like this. Although the gloom in Draco’s chest doesn’t disappear, it feels a little bit lighter when Harry’s around.
Bitty places a slow, showy kiss on each of Pansy’s cheeks. Draco covers his incredulity with a soft cough at the thinly-veiled look of disgust Pansy shoots him over Bitty’s shoulder. He knows that Bitty only suffers Pansy’s rude behaviour because she needs a Pureblood woman who has already come out in society to be her mentor to qualify for the upcoming Jewell Ball. She’s also the previous It-Girl, having worn the proverbial crown up until Blaise announced his engagement to Bitty.
He doesn’t even care that he’s threatening Harry in an open space. He barrels through the gardens, regardless of the sea of shocked expressions and narrowed eyes on him. His gaze catches on Farida as she stands around her close-knit circle of Social ladies.
“Bollocks, I hate this fucking prick,” she mutters before plastering on a fake smile. “Be right with you, mate!” she calls out before facing Draco again. “Is there anything you need before I handle them?” she asks.
“A man after my own heart, serenading me with such lovely, kind adulations,” Harry mutters dryly, sitting down.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Draco howls. As he scrambles to his feet, Jenkins thrusts his wand into Draco’s face.
Draco shudders, ignoring them both, he wraps his arms around his legs as fear slips through his occluded walls. It’s stronger than the flicker of sorrow he experienced earlier and suddenly, there’s a rising feeling of dread in his stomach. A wave-like sense of déjà vu overcomes him before a sharp pain shoots through his head, causing him to flinch and close his eyes.
. He knows what he must look like, had heard the Healers shouting at one another in a hurried frenzy when he had Apparated into the centre of St Mungo’s A&E reception. It was a horrific list of injuries. A concussion, three broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, a skull fracture, a broken nose, two broken teeth, a lacerated tongue, a punctured neck, a shattered left cheekbone, internal bleeding, a 30-centimetre by 4-centimetre long slice of skin missing from his left hipbone and extending to his back from splinching, brutal mottled bruises everywhere, a bruised kidney, and finally, severe rectal bleeding, perforation, and sphincter damage.
“Stop it. You’re too afraid to face what’s happened to you.” Pansy says firmly. “Stop making excuses for taking control of your life. I can’t always be there to guide you.”
Draco’s name printed on a small postcard with a drawing of the scenery from Waterloo Bridge blazes through his mind. The message was in the lines of Parliament. But it wasn’t meant to happen today. It definitely wasn’t supposed to happen
With a trembling hand Harry removes his glasses, slipping them into his pocket as his other hand comes up to rub the tears clear from his eyes. He turns to face the dais. With one heavy step after the other, he climbs the stone steps to stand before the Veil. Gedeon removes Granger's powerful Stasis Charm and the room begins to howl with magical current. As Harry approaches, his hair whipping in the wind, the fear on his face smooths over, a gentle smile gracing his lips as his eyes flutter shut.
“Malfoy was served his punishment. It’s not your job to take the law into your hands. Now get the fuck out of here!” he shouts.
A little over an hour later, all her possessions are probably neatly packed away, shrunk for transport. Harry wouldn’t know. He hasn’t moved from his spot at the table, his food still untouched.
Potter nods serenely and turns to look at him. “What you’re feeling is completely normal, Draco. That body in the mirror? That body survived. That body conquered. That body loves and is loved. That’s
“No, I didn’t, you idiot. Tracey is a friend. And I’m telling you, I want no part in whatever shit you’re involved in. I like my job, I like my freedom, and some days life doesn’t feel like complete fucking rubbish. I couldn't give a rat’s arse about the Flint family, but Tracey? I don’t care if she is married to Marcus. She’s a good person and I hope you know that and decide to help her instead of getting her hurt.”
