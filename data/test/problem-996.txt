“I will, I promise. Once Ron and I drop off the evidence, I’ll come back. Probably with Hermione.”
“Do—”
“And I—I think,” Potter says slowly, his face twisting—as though he’s tasting the words in his mouth and finding them bitter, “I think we may be bite-mates, me and him. I mean, I don’t know enough about vampire attacks like you do, but you seemed to think it odd enough that a vampire would do that—attack from behind and without hypnosis. Not many fit that description. And—and he was... calling—calling for—"
The kitchen links to what appears to be a dining hall, elaborate with its long wooden table with intricate designs carved into its legs spanning most of the room and its Persian Rugs covering the buffed, wood floor. Heavily detailed paintings of forests and meadows line the walls, and two crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
But Harry was already shaking his head, hating to watch the hope die on Draco’s face like he was murdering him anew. “I’m sorry, but the banishing magic doesn’t work like that. And besides, the nature of the magic isn’t... kind.”
“Oh, were you serious, hero?” His laughter finally winds down to a few chuckles. “Thought I told you the first time we met that I’ve been trained for this my whole life. Who would want these skills to go to waste? Combat training’s hardly needed in some cubicle.”
“He let me.”
Potter. You out of everyone is meant to last, to survive. Just the thought of damning you to my fate—”
“Oh... around,” Malfoy said with a wave of his hand. At Harry’s seething look, Malfoy relented. “These fine fellows you see before you are much older ghosts than I am. They’ve been around so long that their original haunts have since been destroyed by time, construction, natural disasters, and the like. Untethered from a specific location, they’re free spirits, roaming about to haunt whomever they please.”
“Me.”
“—and, yes. I do expect you to burn it once you’re finished here with the traitor.” He tugs a key out of his pocket and tosses it at Harry who catches it out of reflex. “Be sure to lock up when you’re done here. Do well, and I might take you off your probation.” Then he gives a chilling smirk in Paper Dracon’s direction before grabbing Prancing Peacock by the back of his costume and dragging him out.
“Was anyone hurt?” Harry’s voice comes out rough than he’d like.
“Is that . . . ?” Harry feels an odd flutter in his chest.
Warily, Harry leans into the villain’s space until their heads rest side by side.
“Did you get a proper cast for it?”
“All right.” He dusts off his gloved hands. “Now, tell me why you’re here.”
They both know where they’re needed right now. The two of them are just going to have to trust that the cops and guards stationed at the Palace are ensuring tourists and other civilians in the building make it to safety.
“Yeah. Haven’t seen you around here before,”
“Well,
Justin shuts the door behind Harry as he steps inside and gestures to the sitting room. They sit in seats opposite from one another—Justin on the couch and Harry on a stuffed chair.
Several of them turn their heads in his direction when he enters but look away again a moment later toward the window into the adjacent room.
“Probably why he turned you down, then,” Hermione says. “You have to plan ahead for these types of things.”
Blaizing Fire holds himself still but flinches away when Ron reaches for his mask.
“Damn it.” Harry clutches the bed spread and then lets it go. “That was all the evidence we had for that case.”
“I-I don’t know. When I think back to being in that room, all I can call up is the terror I felt.” Justin shivers. “Even thinking of it now, I . . . .”
“It should be. Enough that is. You picked out distinct enough details that are unique enough for us to identify vampires or victims that match the profile.” Draco knows he should say something else, before he leaves, before he ends this. Before he heads home and gets sloshed enough to fall into his own oblivion for awhile. “Thanks, Potter. For the cooperation. We’ll—we’ll get ‘em.”
Harry really wonders if he’d be lucky a second time or if they’re all putting their faith in the wrong hero. Again.
An ache rises in Harry’s chest.
One good thing to come from the latest attack was the confirmation that it is indeed the Villain Agency coordinating these assaults on the heroes—though, to be fair, little doubt had been placed that it somehow wasn’t. The two heroes involved had recognized the Agency Villain’s telltale masks before they escaped to the Order’s headquarters.
Harry’s brain feels like his thoughts are swimming in honey, but when one finally breaks to the surface, his head snaps up to really take in the folks surrounding them. “Hang on—where have you all
“So, what you’re saying is,” Harry grips his covers, “this is really bad?”
“Oh, plenty!” Malfoy rose from his seat and started floating toward the ceiling. “Lots of plotting to do now that you’ve narrowed my haunting options. Lots of opportunities too. I wonder if I can somehow clog your sink and toilet.”
“Oh, are you talking about the lab with all the Agency’s research notes, experimental prototypes, and their graphic directions on how to build them?”
But Malfoy seemed mollified, even as distrust lined his face. “Fine. Don’t be late, Potter.”
“Nearly an hour.”
Harry winces when he thinks about Ron and Hermione, suddenly realizing the stress he must have put them under.
Now, considering his distraction and the fact that he is technically out on patrol, it wouldn’t be fair to say he’s out looking for Paper Dracon. But he finds him anyway.
“Okay.” He doesn’t remember any recent, open cases with a vampire not using hypnosis. Though, it’s not unheard of. He has dealt with his handful of sick fucks that forego that element altogether.
“If you say so.”
“Ran into
“So, I can’t just power down. I’d be like removing part of my mask, and that’s always risky.”
Knowing that he can’t speak since Voldemort would know his voice does not belong to Fire, Harry opts to bow and prays that would be enough.
“Hard to say. I’ve never seen it. But I know we all hope this wasn’t an attack by the Agency.”
you?”
be legal if they had flesh and blood.
Harry surges forward and wraps a gloved hand around Dracon’s raised fist. “No, you don’t.”
~~*~~
Evidently, they would also throw most games in Draco’s favour for a bonus as well.
“Yes, while I’m not truly happy about it,” Hermione says as she twirls a curl in her fingers, “it’s at least some lead we can go off from.”
“We know you say you’re sorry, Harry, but you also overexerted your injuries in the process of being reckless. Again,” Hermione says, for roughly the fortieth time.
“That’s kind of easy for someone with lightning powers to say.” Justin glances down at his bare feet. “Besides. I had to quit my lighting job because they haven’t quite been working since I left the hospital.”
“If there’s nothing—”
“Well, we could no longer see its lights, so it wasn’t facing us anymore. The only other options were that it turned around or shifted to face one of the people standing on either side of it.”
“Well, quite arrogant of you, don’t you think, Potter? You really think you could take me on?” He looks him up and down with the best contemptuous gaze he can muster. “Really?”
Tension leaves Dracon’s shoulders, and he starts to turn around again to leave. Before he can get very far, Harry holds out the dragon skull mask to him. “Here”
“Been working for this Department for a fair amount of time. While I may still need to smooth out how I handle clients—” Draco says while Potter draws in a sharp breath “—that doesn’t mean I’m not a professional in my field.”
Centering himself, Harry amps up the electrical charge coursing through his body, then channels it into the knives pressed tight against his skin.
“Er . . . . I mean, when you say it like that, it sounds kind of stupid. But, you see, my aunt and uncle weren’t . . . great people—to me—even though they raised me. Excellent to their wanker of a son, though. I have a feeling they never really got over my mum marrying my dad.”
“Yes, and I imagine some villain’s always at the root of those people experiencing that sadness to begin with.”
Draco sits straight in his chair, plants his feet to prevent any rocking, and turns his full attention to Ms. Adams. “Good afternoon, Ms. Adams. Thank you for coming to our department on this matter and for agreeing to meet in person, though I wish our meeting could have been for a happier occasion.” He gives her a small, apologetic smile. “If you would, ma’am, please expand more on the incident. While the details you gave the Ministry were helpful, if we hope to catch the vampire, we’ll need as much detail as you’re willing to provide.”
Potter’s eyes snap from the ceiling to Draco’s face, his mouth going slack. “What?”
She shakes her head and continues, “It had seemed like a regular call. Some trouble with thieves down by the Wharf. When we arrived, C-Ced said the place was too quiet.” Thievery by the docks always sounds like a loud scuffle, Harry knows all too well. “But I just brushed it off. We were by the water, I had reasoned. My power had an advantage in that setting. So, we entered several dock sheds and warehouses until we found the right one."
“Merlin, bugger off, you prat.”
Harry feels his jaw working as words fight one another for the right to come out. He stuffs his hands in his pockets. While he’s not made a habit of gambling, he’d bet the other two heard his teeth click together when he forces himself to swallow his words.
“Stop playing coy.” Ron nearly tears himself from Harry’s grip, and Harry nearly lets him. “You know what we’re asking.”
To her credit, she doesn’t even flinch. “They were definitely attacked by a vampire that fits your profile quite well. Part-time bartender, facial features that match our sketches, initial charm of a Venus flytrap. Deny it all you want, but we see the red of your irises—you’ve attacked
didn’t do this to you.”
Harry blinks behind his mask. “Wait, the Vill—uh—
“What’d that prick want?”
The villain’s laughter cuts off.
Not even Dracon’s suit had been repaired.
“Come here, Lucius.”
Alpha Bee’s head sinks a little until his crisscrossed fingers cover his mouth. “Explain.”
“I already told you all that I know.”
“Great, a ghost that’s managed to retain some magical abilities? Only you, Harry,” Ron said. “And just ‘cause you’re soft on him doesn’t mean—”
you. But I think you’ve forgotten just who you’re talking to.”
Harry opens his mouth, then shuts it a moment. “. . . A Supervillain.”
By the time he and Dracon reach the bottom of the stairwell, the battle ends. The victor shoves his opponent’s body down the staircase, leaving Harry and Dracon to jump out of its way. When Harry glances at the corpse, he sees
The Supervillain remains silent but keeps his new position, leaning against the back of the chair.
For little Hardev Bakshi, Harry waits for the light to turn on in his room before he leaves. Both the parents work late shifts.
Harry lifts the first aid kit from the loop in his belt. “Let me wrap that leg up for you!”
. Eager, Harry angles his head left, then right, until he makes out two other letters—one on either side of the
“We know. The heroes here are all trying their best. It’s not like we could force the information out of him if we tried.”
“Your plan seems to hinge on this villain letting important information slip—or even capitulating so far as to knowingly provide it.” Alpha Bee tugs at his beard. “Yet there is no indication thus far that Paper Dracon would even do so.”
. . . with you, then?”
After a while longer, Malfoy dropped his stare back to the work he pretended his fingers were doing. “I could never do this when I was alive. Mother hated the idea that I was marring a piece of history. She said restorative charms could only do so much work for so long before the wood was ruined beyond repair.” His nails worked faster at their incorporeal scraping.
Draco blinks, and Potter has retreated several paces back into the house. “Well, if you’re done prettying yourself up...”
The four kids chatter different excuses at him, telling him that “it’s all right to skive off sometimes,” and “it’s been so long since” he last played with them, and that, surely, the city could stand “five minutes” without him.
himself. Hermione, being the least exhausted of the group, takes the lead to meet them head on, Harry and Ron trailing her.
not my fault?”
“No.” Harry felt bad for the way he laughed, but not enough to stop. “No. It’s an Astral Projection potion. I got Hermione to research it for me. She’s really great, actually, at looking up and concocting illegal things if you ask nicely enough.”
Still a little light-headed, Harry turns his attention back to the villain, on the other side of him now that he’s moved, and finds him much closer than anticipated.
“Who else was with you?” Ron asked, and Harry could have kissed him for the gentle tone he used.
were under interrogation. And they wanted to keep Her—
Unbidden, a spark of suspicion rose within Harry. How long had Draco known about what the peachicks actually were? But as he took in the hollow horror on Draco’s face as he stared down at his palm, Harry recalled how distraught he’d been with each missing baby peacock. If Draco had known, he’d have never uttered the words “I wish.”
~~*~~
“Is this the way things are going to be from now on?” Ron asks. “All of us continuing our heroic duties while the Villain Agency picks us off one by one?”
“Now,” he continues, “I say we move on to the next stage of your punishment for betraying us. Just outside this room, we have an object everyone in the Agency has grown familiar with—”
“How about we start with a setting?”
Stalling in his tread, Paper Dracon turns his head enough so that Harry can see just the profile of the Dragon skull mask in the dying daylight. “No way in hell, hero.”
“Ah!! Customers!” Mr. Fortescue toddles out from the back, cheeks filling with delighted colour. “Not even this dreadful weather’s enough to chill your young hearts, eh?”
Blaizing Fire has a curious tilt to his head, and Harry pushes away the sensation that he’s being studied.
Everyone back at the Hero Order’s headquarters is less impressed than last time to hear he let Paper Dracon get away from him for a third time. Even Luna expresses her disappointment in him by not inquiring whether he came across the fairies that grant people powers like she normally does after a bout through London.
While Harry worked his way over, he had been aware of Paper Dracon’s gaze tracking him, even through Dracon’s two layers of masks. His head had followed Harry as he moved.
It was that last line of thought that led Harry to his current solution—dress to impress, tuxedo-style.
Finch-Fletchley nods and visibly suppresses a shudder. “Anyway, I think the masked person yelled out, ‘stop it!’ really loudly—or at least, something to that effect.”
It flies them across the warehouse. Now that Harry listens for it, he can hear the distinct sounds of battle outside the walls. Ron and Hermione’s group must be clashing with the Agency Villains.
in the manor. Wasn't much of a secret as I thought, where I went when I slipped away. I led them here—to the babies. I—I—”
“I know—” Potter tries to say.
Suddenly, he feels a presence at his back.
“I don’t know,” Finch-Fletchley says. “If the police are handling it, wouldn’t it be better to keep heroes out of it?”
They learn that the night the Villain Agency attacked the Hero Order headquarters, more than half the Order’s pro heroes had been preparing for attack in their homes, while most of the younger generation had been off on patrol. Truly, their headquarters had not been more vulnerable to attack than it had been on that night. It had been lucky that Harry had noticed the odd glow from the fire while he had been out on patrol.
But Harry couldn’t just leave him out here to succumb to his wounds and still call himself a hero. Villain or not, pain-in-the-arse or not, Paper Dracon needs help.
By the time Harry arrives at the Weasley home in Shoreditch, it’s past midnight. He had to take a bus since reaching for his electricity felt like touching the frayed end of a wire. Probably what he gets for powering up and down so much in such a small time-frame.
“It was still something.” He deftly pries off a few of the cards that statically stick to his dealing hand. “Even if it could have turned out to be a trap.”
“Then why keep fighting as a hero?”
The two of them drag him back into the drawing room. GarGoyle lets go of Harry to slam the door behind them. Vice-Net brings Harry to the center of the room.
Harry can’t quite place the tone in Dracon’s voice, but he knows it makes him uneasy. He opens his mouth to say that he keeps his eye on most villains he faces off with on a weekly to monthly basis, but Dracon beats him to the punch.
Draco does
Harry knows the villain’s trying to convey something by the way his tone dropped and wonders if it's hints about the current case.
The sensation of being studied has always made Harry’s skin itch; he knows the feeling of being measured up by a person better than he knows the feeling of passing their test. Just because he recognizes the sensation doesn’t mean it’s lost its effect of making him want to squirm. He clenches his teeth together in an effort to hold himself still.
“We were out on a date. A night Quidditch match. It’d been fun. Invited my date home—not here, a flat, my flat—for drinks. Guess they had another drink in mind.” Potter lets out a humorless chuckle.
you. And if I did, it would certainly be in the same way I miss the constant ache in my leg.”
“I’d like to do you one better.” Harry reaches up and removes his own mask from his face, placing it on the balcony railing beside his drink.
He finds her humming over a large pot of stew. Harry taps her on the shoulder.
He lets the pulse loose.
He wonders if they can see the fear in his expression, and a voice in his head whispers,
He stops before Draco, arms crossed in front of his chest. “Why’d you do it? Why bring me here?”
“Friend? Hmmm, yes, I think I’m beginning to see why you have such a slanted, optimistic view about my future prospects in heroism. We’re . . . comrades for a cause.”
A pink splotch appears on his neck, however his lips twitch as if he’s about to grin. “How unfortunate. They’ve just had to rush him down to Intensive Care.”
Another ten minutes pass before
“Who’s out there?” Molly Weasley’s voice calls.
“Yes, well . . . .” Harry wonders a moment how best to phrase it. “At this moment in time, law enforcement has decided to keep witness statements confidential.”
“I know. But the effort doesn’t go... unappreciated.”
says, “This was why most of the older heroes didn’t want you younger ones to be involved in this case. You’re too inexperienced to know when personal morality has to be put aside to benefit the greatest amount of people when you’re placed in a difficult situation where no truly right path exists. Unfortunately for us, the Villain Agency appears to have no qualms to subjecting their younger members to the harsher realities.”
He lands in a bin stuffed with uncollected refuse. As Harry lays on the pile in a daze, he isn’t sure if the delirium is a result of the harsh landing or the events that preceded it.
Poppy Petal crosses her arms. “
—” His hand clamps onto the back of his neck. “But it shouldn’t even
“Ideally, yes. But most people’s magic goes a bit...off after—”
The unmistakable sound of crashing in
Happy, nonetheless, to find the missing Superheroes, Harry takes a step inside the room.
“What’s all the ruckus over here?”
As Harry lies on the couch in the Weasley drawing room, he mulls over those options as well as the other thoughts that had been kept at bay for over a week. Pushing away the confusing thoughts about Paper Dracon and Cho, he thinks about the unsolved kidnapping-turned-murder case, and how the patients admitted to the hospital have most likely been discharged.
Hermione’s response came in the form of renewed vigor in her spells, but after three hours of failure, she had to call it a night. In the face of Hermione’s apologies, Draco granted them the mask of his nonchalance about the matter, claiming that he’d never expected the attempts to work. Muttering about finding his ‘lost baby,’ he vanished on the other side of the gate.
to do, just because
“I suppose.”
Out in the hall, away from their lines of sight, Harry takes a moment to lean a hand against the wall. Head bowed, he attempts to gain control of himself.
“Ah. Hardly. Look, if vampires and werewolves can be redeemed in society’s eyes, why not the
“An utterly stupid, reckless idea,” Hermione muttered a week later as she toiled over her broiling cauldron. “Are you

uncomfortable in the worst way imaginable. So... so now with this, I’m making myself uncomfortable in ways I can actually
Lifting the envelope, Harry turns it around in his hands. The note is sealed, and the envelope is blank on all sides. He waits until Ron sits down on the bed, facing him. “Who’s it from?”
“Mister Malfoy is always welcome in the most Noble and Ancient House of Black.” Kreacher steps aside, gesturing to the rest of the house in welcome.
“Wha—Malfoy, I don’t understand.”
It’s cold and crowded with stored items in the lowest level of the house but knowing that what he’s looking for is locked up works in his favor. He locates the chest of drawers that corresponds with the keys on the ring fairly quickly.
Her head jerks in a strange manner. “Y-yes.”
Suddenly, the mechanical monster stops and holds out its palms toward Harry and Dracon.
“Well, we’re having difficulty getting anything out of Blaizing Fire, but he doesn’t really have a reason to give us anything other than we’re keeping him detained. But, maybe, if there’s trouble in villain paradise for Dracon, he might be more inclined to help us out—if only unintentionally.”
The car Fire had attacked them with truly explodes, sending the Supervillain flying forward several meters and well over the heads of the two heroes still on the ground.
Dracon makes a garbled sound and tries to jerk his hand from under Harry’s foot, but he holds it trapped between the mask and his sole.
The dragon skull mask brushes against the fabric over Harry’s ear. “Piss off.”
Many more heroes, including Nix-Nymph, are put up in the make-shift medical ward Poppy Petal set up in the Weasley’s house—the only place with enough room to momentarily act as headquarters thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s Control over Space. Even with most of their identities in the hands of their enemies, placing them in actual hospitals is considered too much a risk to their privacy and safety. Poppy Petal is the only hero at the Order to know every hero’s secret identity since she handles all injuries.
Leave it to Hermione to discover she has better command over the results of her abilities by writing down the changes to reality she wants and aiming her hand at the page, rather than waving her hands around her, thinking of the vague changes she wants, and getting mixed outcomes. The results have been a marked improvement since Harry and Ron first met her taking on a base of Agency Villains by herself years ago. But even then, her Control over Reality had been a rough power to combat.
“Yeah. Why?”
“And ghost body parts would help you ruin my table?”
“Eh.” He rubs a hand along the back of his neck. “The doctors didn’t go into details when I’d ask. But from what I did hear from them, they’ve recovered just fine.” His eyes return to Harry’s eye lenses. “Though, I’m guessing that’s not all you’re here to talk about?”
“Where is he?!” Ron shouts as the horse slows its momentum so it can turn around and charge them again. “Where’s that bastard hiding?!”
Scratch talking to Potter; Draco’s so not ready for this conversation. Still, this is the first thing Potter’s technically said to him that’s not directly about the case. “I don’t hate it.”
“Now who’s being vague?”
Harry had arrived at the mansion after dark, feeling exposed wearing only a carbon copy of the Villain Agency henchman standard black jumper, tan trousers, Venom under-mask, and all. Even worse, if he hopes to remain unrecognized, he can’t afford to power up. And in the event he
Fortified by Draco’s support, Mr. Park glances up and then away again. He puts his back to the one-way window, folding his arms across his chest. “Second to last one on the far right.”
“Ha! It really
“There’re plenty of things that I want.” Harry watches Dracon’s shoulders hunch.  “But not in return for this.”
Fortunately, Narcissa’s return meant that vultures at the Ministry could no longer descend on the corpse of the Manor and divy it up to any interested party. Unfortunately, her return heralded a new challenge for Harry and Draco as she took up residence back at the Manor. Harry’s Felix Felicis-level luck ran out on his eighth secret visit since her coming home.
“I didn’t force him to do anything! He seemed hell-bent on ignoring his state and insisting he didn’t need my help.”
He tamps down the urge to defend his heroic impulses. “I was getting to that. See, I think that there’s an opportunity for us to, uhm, for lack of a better word . . .
Blaizing Fire is hunched over the table, elbow placed on its surface and head propped in his hand, his under-mask clutched in the other.
Harry winces. He’d been out cold when she’d evidently stormed to the medical ward to let him have a piece of her mind. Thankfully, Poppy Petal has a policy of not allowing in visitors who aren't privy to her patients' true identities. But as soon as he gets discharged, he knows he will have to face her. “So, any news for today?”
But those aren’t the only high-profile cases to be brought to the court. Particularly difficult and prolonged are the cases given to the Youth Justice court.
Harry thinks.
“Strange? How have I been strange? It was strange for me to be acting the way I was for the last month!” The letter shakes in his hand as he goes to pick it up. Frustrated, he drops it again onto his textbook. “I needed the reminder that he’s a villain.”
“Maybe.” Harry still looks around just in case.
They all flinch when
Not exactly like Harry had planned to have a good portion of his time taken up with the boat-hunting job from last night, but he didn’t wait to be told again.
Potter rocks back on his feet, hands in his robe pockets. “Right. And you, Malfoy. So...”
The door swings open, and he’s face to face with Potter. Or as face to face as one can be when the other person is wearing six different layers and a scarf wrapped around their head.
He toys with the lock, turning it this way and that, while the henchmen finish loading the troublesome crate onto the boat. Just when he hears a satisfying
Cocking his head, Harry takes a step towards Draco, right into his personal space. “It was nice, but I’m not sure I want to return it.”
“Well, thanks.”
Harry grimly agrees.
“I know you don’t believe that line, and, from what I know of Mad-Eye, I highly doubt he believes it either.”
“What’re you going to do with—”
They all give their confirmation.
boat?” Charlie Jenkins wonders the whole walk home, regardless of what Harry tells him.)
Sighing, Alpha Bee tugs on his long, white beard. “We had faith in the three of you to handle the situation. You’re all adept at working well with one another. But we also didn’t want to leave the people forming the perimeter to get surprised by a Supervillain deciding to run from the fight. What heroes we had on call, we sent to enforce the border.”
Resolutely, both he and Cho return to the makeshift “non-poisoned residents” medical ward. Harry is put under strict orders to not enter a lighted room or think for too long. That second order from Poppy is so impossible for Harry to follow, considering all the different events and information swirling about in his brain, that Poppy is forced to knock him out for several hours at a time. For Harry, the unconscious state is better than all the thoughts crowding for his attention.
“What? Look at him, Hermione.”
“Oh, right. You probably got the worst of it after Ron. He threw himself on top of me, you know. To shield me from the blast. How stupid.”
and Mad-Eye. Harry winces as he watches the poisoned tips of Peacock’s feather darts graze the two heroes. That’s one Supervillain Harry had hoped to not fight again after his first run-in with him a year back. To this day, Harry is unsure if he has grown to be a match for the skill with which Peacock fights.
Harry stares at the peeling mint green paint on the wood and makes a mental note to ask for witness protection for Ms. Davis before steeling himself to head over to Mrs. Figg and ask her uncomfortable questions about her dead nephew.
Dracon straightens but does not turn around. “What do you mean? I’m your enemy, and I knocked you out.”
taps out the pass code on the keypad next to the door. A
“Oh, they assured me it was some kind of accident at his funeral. Can you believe that? They had the nerve to show up at his funeral!”
“Is there something the matter?”
The smoke from the flames Blaizing Fire created mixes with the last vestiges of Hermione’s haze barrier, making it impossible to see. But they can hear the scrambling footsteps on the other side of the fire wall.
Buying a bouquet of flowers, he takes the bus down to The City of London Cemetery and Crematorium where his parents are buried. It’s a pretty nice place, as far as cemeteries go. Pretty architecture, delightful ponds, beautiful flowers in the warmer months. Still, as he passes different gravestones until he reaches the ones belonging to his parents, Harry can’t help but feel like this place is just like every other burial ground filled with lost loved ones.
“What?” He snarls.
? He can’t—
“That’s all right. Just tell me what you can recall.”
The one time Draco did speak to Harry, it was a muttered “sorry” upon finding Harry attempting spell after useless spell to expunge the rot sinking into the flat’s walls. Receiving an unsolicited and demure apology from
As they walk, Harry stuffs his hands into Blaizing Fire’s coat pockets and is surprised to not find any of his matches, lighters, or bottles of lighter fluid. Although, he’s grateful not to have to worry about the latter—had it still been there, Harry could have caught on fire or caused an explosion when he powered up. Luckily for Harry, Fire had thought to keep those items for himself when handing over his clothing. He wonders if they’ll run into Blaizing Fire when they run back in.
Sputtering indignantly, Harry hops off the bed. “I-it’s not a

“Er—Only just a little, I’m afraid.”
Harry winces.
know why she left years ago?”
After several minutes of quiet in which Harry recommences with wrapping the break, Dracon says in a small voice, “I thought you didn’t want anything in return.”
Just thinking about his scar sets his forehead throbbing, and he shoves it under the water to soothe it.
But even as Harry joked, he felt the way the ghostly world around him rippled. He watched as a Veil right from the Department of Mysteries stitched itself together between two trees behind Draco as if to say
“But three years seems like such a long time to mourn someone, regardless of who they were, you know?”
Once he’s near, Harry lifts the sheet enough to get a glimpse of a full mechanical form before he drops it again. A shudder passes through him.
“How should

“Like he’s complained! Potter could’ve rid himself of me whenever he fucking wanted!” He then turned his full attention to Harry, expression losing some of its hard edges. “Your magic. Potter, you could free me of this place.”
noise fills the corridor as the light above the door flips on, and the steel door slides open.
“I want him to tell me where the schematics are for the
In the distance, he hears Big Ben chiming ten o’clock and, cursing below his breath, wonders how long he’s sat here deliberating. As the night wears on, the temperature will only continue to drop, and then it won’t matter what Harry does with the corpse.
“Sounds fair to me.”
“I said I did. Why would I lie about that?”
“I didn’t knock him out.”
“I... I, uh.” Harry swallowed. “It’s—I know it’s not
By the angle of his head, Potter’s obviously staring at Draco’s held out hand and, just like First Year, doesn’t move to take it. But he doesn’t Disapparate away either. He straightens as Mrs. Weasley bears down upon them.
By the time Potter returns from the loo, Draco’s finished up with the witness and is waiting by the front door. Potter meets him there, redressed in his head coverings. He glances back toward Ms. Adams, whose legs are now stretched the length of the couch rather than curled against her chest.
Harry sees Dracon abandon further attempts to stand in favor of crawling towards his discarded outer-mask.
“Mmm,” Draco says as he sips his thrice-reheated tea. “Sounds about right. Wait, sooner?”
“Then why are you still here?”
Draco waves a dismissive hand. “Hardly. It’d be better luck catching him another day—which I will let you know about, should you want to tag along again.”
Hermione half rises out of her chair. “He allowed you to re-break the fracture?”
Draco sighed. “I wish she could go far away from here, and live a normal, undisturbed life where the memories of what she had and who she’s lost didn’t torment her. If my mother could be at peace, that would make me happy. Coming back to England has only hurt her.”
. They’d forgotten completely about Blaizing Fire.
stop sh-shaking me. Head injury! Remember?”
“You don’t think you’re the only one frustrated, Ron?”
Harry doesn’t know how to begin to explain this morning’s exchange to Dracon but finds that a large part of him wants to try.
his mind helpfully provides.
“No.” Harry presses onward. “I do. I care about people. Even people like you.”
She waves them away. “I don’t want your bleeding help programs. I want you to catch that monster!”
Hermione gives him a light smile. “Then that’s what you do.”
By the time it reaches the squabbling pair, the paper bird is easily the size of the boy. It goes to tackle the girl, but the boy shoves her out of its path.
’s hand lands atop Harry’s head. “Izulu, here, wanted to give it another go.”
“Master is being upstairs. Does Mister Malfoy need anyth—”
Alpha Bee chuckles. “There’s that youthful spirit. I was worried the long day knocked it out of you.” He tugs on his beard again. “Hmm . . . Well, you’ll have to help file the police report—telling the officers all you know about the incident today. Then, I imagine, the three of you will want to get some rest after your hard work.”
It’s a few days since his last run-in with Paper Dracon in the alleyway in Kensington and since he last spoke with Blaizing Fire. Even more since he last tried to see the people injured in the kidnapping-turned-murder. He wonders when they will be discharged at the hospital and whether they’ll all still be babysat by the police for protection. Mrs. Figg had shooed him away when he went to follow up about the boat situation, and the blood tests Hermione has been running on that piece of fabric he’d given her have turned up empty of matches in the police databases.
Hermione places her hands on her hips. “And how do you plan to catch up to them? You’re nearly just as bad off! Or have all your wounds not registered in your brain yet?”
“I said, I doubt whether you’d actually trust the outcome of an official match, wherein we’re both equals, to the Snidgets I so easily bribed before.”
Alpha Bee raises his hands before himself. “Now, Cho . . . .”
Harry dashes inside the shed and takes shelter behind a stack of crates yet to be loaded. He peers around the corner of one and is suddenly mask to mask with one of the black-clad figures. When the man starts to let out a warning shout, Harry shoves his hand on the henchman’s chest and twists it into the fabric before sending an electric jolt stolen from his watch through the man, knocking him out. The grip he has on the unconscious man prevents him from crashing to the floor and alerting the others to the spy in their midst. Harry pulls him into his hiding place and props him up against the crates.
“If we want to know why he’s here, I suspect so.”
“At least I don’t sound like Siri,” Paper Dracon says, struggling to his feet.
“The best choice I’ve ever made.”
“Already here, are you?” The voice is low, rough, and dangerous in all the ways that Potter’s voice normally isn’t.
Harry hasn’t seen him one-on-one since the mission at the mansion so many months ago. Both of them had been caught up in the chaos that followed the successful defeat of a bunch of top tier Agency villains, and Dracon, with Fire, had been held by law enforcement until their trials finished—both for concern that they’d flee from the law and for concern for their safety.
, elongating its outer lines. He huffs as he reads it over one last time before crumpling and abandoning the parchment in a particularly deep puddle to disintegrate.
Alpha Bee hums and casts his eyes toward a light above them. “Before we head in to talk with our guest, I believe I should show you what we confiscated off his person.”
Dracon turns his head away and rubs his right hand on the concrete beside him.
Alpha Bee says, “Besides what I already mentioned, the detectives have found that the arm is made from an odd type of metal. It’s rare in the sense that they haven’t encountered it before and have no leads on where it originated. However, from our analysis, it appears to be a metal called Acromium. Used to be common with Super families for acclimating well to different power sets. However, its deleterious effects resulted in the EU putting a ban on its continued use and trade around 1975.”
“You know, now that you say that, Ron, I think something else makes some sense.” Harry starts pacing again while he thinks it through. “Yes. I probably should have seen it sooner. You two remember when I tried to charge the mechanical arm back to life?”
That has Harry spinning on his heel. “Really now?”
“Oh, and it has ‘red eyes’ that glow.”
Bending over, he pulls at the loose nail keeping it in place. Once he lifts the board, Harry finds a pamphlet of papers tied up in a string.
It’s only when they reach the first floor of the building that they take a moment to look around.
They throw open the double doors with ease—as pushing on them causes them to collapse inward. Stepping inside, they see almost all the house’s walls and floors have been leveled. Most of the roof has either caved in or been blown off.
She waves off his reassurances. “I know what I did and didn’t do with my own property! I did not have it moved anywhere! Tell me, young man.” Her face comes close enough to Harry’s that her nose nearly brushes his mask. “Why would I move a boat—a b—”
rises from his position behind the pew again, pulling more sharp objects from hooks inside his cloak.
“I was here to speak to Justin Finch-Fletchley. One of the victims I carried out last night.” Harry then waves a hand at the officer. “Your turn.”
“I don’t know, it moved too fast for me to see. But it made the figure who attacked it cry out and hunch over. Then the two of them entered a fight in earnest. They knocked furniture over, broke the light in the other room, and scraped the flooring. After they got one of the hostages good with an attack, we all did our best to slide flat to the floor.”
stumble outside of the Palace’s hall. Then, to top things off, he hears the unmistakable grinding sound of GarGoyle taking full advantage of Ron’s distracted state.
“Told them we already gave them all the info we had. Plus, I pointed out that
“Yeah.”
Freer now, Dracon rotates his wrist to shake out the soreness no doubt present. Once he’s finished flexing it, he easily directs the swallow to the opposite wrist and slices that manacle off as well.
“Hermione, I’m not gonna just sit back and watch my best friends be treated like they’re villains!”
As they drag Ron towards the dock shed’s exit, Harry looks back to where the villain had lain and only catches a glimpse of his cronies carrying him off—one even runs back for the dragon mask that must have fallen when they lifted him. Harry presumes they’re headed to the boat loaded with crates filled with cargo he’d never gotten to see.
He shifts his head so that he can see Fire out of his periphery. “For what? Following the Code?”
“They probably would have gotten you too. He wouldn’t have liked that.”
When Harry looks around, Hermione is several meters behind them. She must have not been able to see properly and moved just outside the barrier to banish it.
Although, with how long he’s been waiting for the host to show, he may just only never see Potter again.
Harry releases a shaky breath as he watches the rest of the paper swan turn to ash from Harry’s blast. Right. He can do this.
“Silence when I am speaking, Lucius!”
The third and final victim on their sheet lives in a house just outside of Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley. They have to cross through Knockturn in order to reach it, and, for the first time, Potter draws closer to Draco during their walk. Whether it’s from protectiveness over Draco, or a desire to feel protected by Draco, Draco’s pounding heart hardly cares. He can only hope Potter’s too distracted by the shifty characters passing them in the Alley to take note over what Draco’s heart is doing.
The villain’s laughter ceases, and he sits back up against the wall. He’s silent for a while, giving the impression he’s studying Harry. Finally, he shifts the good leg a little and speaks. “Course not. I’ve never called you by it, have I?”
“Who...?”
Harry lets his electricity go, too. The glowing hum of the graphite quickly eats away at what energy is left from the current, and the ethereal glow stops.
His frantic eyes land on Ron. “Oh,
When Hermione looks like she’s about to protest again, Ron draws her into a hug.
The villain’s hold merely tightens.
Harry and Ron peek over her shoulder as she sifts through the contents. But the first page they see tells them all they need to know. All three of them draw in sharp breaths.
Days pass with Harry begging the other heroes to help him locate and rescue Paper Dracon after they’d returned to an empty warehouse with backup.
Draco shook his head and glanced away. “Wait. One... two—where’s...?”
As she shuts the door on him, she says, “Ask Mrs. Figg your questions.”
“Looks like your little friend survived.”
The third month, Harry drew the line because he came home from Auror Training to find Malfoy hosting an illegal ghost gambling ring. Or, at least, Harry referred to it as illegal since the bastard was hosting it in
Being awash in the other half of Ron’s power is a lot like being submerged in a hot bath—if hot baths also had the possibility of exploding on you. But Harry believes he’s been drained enough today by the
“Yeah, yikes. But he could never compel people to use their powers. According to my father—” he takes in a few breaths “—According to him, that always grated on Voldemort. With the
“Why else would he give away our rendezvous point to the heroes?”
Ron starts to say, “That’s—”
“Oi! Easy there, bovver boy. You’ve done what you’ve done. Now, it’s in the law’s hands.” The man’s mouth doesn’t say “bugger off now,” but the tilt of his head and the jut of his chin certainly does.
“Well, I guess I could use the sopping mess they would make to smother you.”
“I’m not—” Dracon cuts himself off and seems to mull over a thought. “Why have you
The electricity appears to tease the mechanical arm at first, making it shake where the sparks strike the metal. But when the current catches some of the frayed wires at the end, the entire arm jolts and comes alive.
Draco pauses his quill scratching to squint up at Potter. “The vampire was someone you knew?”
?” There’s the venom that’s been missing.
Harry has to glance away. With a steady hand, he gestures to a set of bushes near the extraction point. “My costume’s over there.”
He stands in the empty kitchen downing shots of Firewhiskey while everyone else stays in the sitting room, finally breaching the forbidden topics simmering beneath the surface. At some point, voices start to raise above the sound of the Wireless playing, and Draco turns on the sink, rinsing out his glass seven times despite knowing he’ll soon refill it again.
“So, does that mean you’re coming with me?” Harry means it sarcastically. However . . . .
“Well, what if it’s filled with a poison or something that’ll fall out once I open it?”
. Harry suspects the red tint to his eyes comes from permanent damage similar to the rest of his scars.
“You look like shit,” Blaizing Fire says.
Confused muttering breaks out among the villains standing. Blazing Fire tilts back a little before Harry feels that same sensation of being studied.
Harry shrugs but doesn’t look.
“The other—?!” The hand he has trained on Lady Strange drops for a moment but flies back up before Lady Strange could attack Hermione. “Really?!”
“I—” Draco rubs a hand across his mouth.
Neither of them move, and Draco releases a frustrated breath. “This entire time, I thought you were afraid to touch—to be around other people, around
Harry glances up at Ron, glasses sliding down to the bridge of his nose. Ever since he had recovered, Mrs. Weasley allowed him to room with Ron, so it's less crowded in the patient ward. This change in sleeping arrangements certainly has the perk of not having to wear his mask all the time.
“Hold on a second.” In his dazed state, Harry recognizes that voice as belonging to Blaizing Fire. “I think he’s saying he needs pen and paper to communicate.”
Potter crosses his arms as he seems to take the stare as a challenge, even if the other man can’t see them.
“No, I’m only about halfway. But I think this author is good enough so far that I might pick up the sequel while we’re here.”
A day before the court comes to a decision, Harry gets a knock on his bedroom door in the Weasley household.
“So, what happened in the end? How did you get separated?” Hermione asks.
Voldemort’s fate is less clear. Some rumors say he had been vaporized on the spot, while others claim the blast had left him permanently disfigured. Either way, he hasn’t made a public appearance since the incident almost fifteen years ago.
“And just let you shove me off a three-crate stack the second I do?”
“Go to hell.”
Before Harry can open his mouth to begin, Paper Dracon spins on his heel and heads for the mouth of the alleyway.
Harry suppresses a sigh. “Because it would violate your privacy rights as a witness and potential victim. Even if it would help our end of the case.”
Feeling light-headed, Harry goes to speak but catches himself at the last second. He may have revealed his face to Blaizing Fire, but that doesn’t mean he needs his voice too. Instead, Harry takes back up the pen and notepad in shaking hands. He writes:
“Er... He sort of did that on his own. And you can get your cloak before you leave this time. It’s still on the rack.”
“Not until you get treatment.” Harry notes how Dracon’s back tenses more and wonders when it tensed in the first place.
“Hmm . . . .” Justin rubs at his temple. “Now, see. This is some of the stuff that’s a little muddled. I don’t recall being physically gagged, but, thinking back, I get the sense I was too—too scared. To call out, I mean.”
“Night, Potter.” Malfoy’s expression was uncharacteristically soft as he drifted away while Harry scrambled to gather his thoughts. “Don’t worry. That won’t be happening again. You’re right in that it could only be a net loss for me in the end.”
When Harry doesn’t, Draco brushes his lips against the mask. Then he pulls away and rushes from the room.
He and Ron have to duck again as
Beside Harry, the villain’s stopped his moaning and is gathering himself together. Harry’d like to do something heroic about it, but his muscles refuse to move. “Hey,” he tries to shout, but Harry’s still winded and it comes out too weak to hear. Harry watches blearily as the villain takes a moment to fix his askew mask and digs around in one of his side pockets.
Everyone in the room sets their gazes upon him with a turn of their heads—even Blaizing Fire, whose faster breathing lets everyone know he’s given up the pretense of being calm.
“Ron, how would you react if, heaven forbid, we were to lose Harry in battle? Or me?”
s to take them out. Harry had figured Voldemort, based on what he already observed and what Dracon told him, would be power-hungry enough to want to take his powers before taking his life. The Supervillain would probably view that course of action as a form of justice for the one he sees as responsible for his downfall fifteen years ago.
Harry notes,
Potter takes a fumbling step back and turns to Draco, but he doesn’t say anything—evidently fearful Mrs. Weasley might overhear.
see Dracon has never ceased. But seeing him in this moment, just like he always was to Harry, is more than enough now.
“Umm . . . .”
Apparently, Ron’s still chafed by Harry’s earlier betrayal.
As they run, Harry starts sending his electricity through his system, and he feels the added boost to his legs and the added tug on his hair from the wind as it stands on end. Once powered up—and he can feel the sparks along his throat—Harry shouts to Ron, “What do you think’s—?”
for extra questioning!”
Harry nods along while he writes a quick note down and circles it. “And the other masked person in the room. The accomplice? The one who had been laughing. Could you tell what he was doing during all of this?”
“All right. May I ask why not?”
The air surrounding the complex is oppressive on Harry’s lungs when he arrives on the scene. Not wasting any time, Harry searches out for sparks of life and, upon pinpointing three weak pulses, rushes inside.
“All right. So, you remember letting him borrow it?”
Ron glowers at his soup. “Harry’s a damn good hero. You both are.”
“Are you sure you should be out of the medical ward? I mean, you still have the gown on.”
Harry’s hand self-consciously flies to finger at the flimsy felt covering his face from his nose to his forehead. “Er . . . .”
“Well, it did work,” Harry says, clinging to that last bit of pride before it slips away.
When Harry opens the door after that one, he comes across a large drawing room more elaborate in decor than the dining hall. Yet he is not afforded time to take in many details as his eyes focus on several cloaked figures sitting throughout the room.
, decided to jump ahead by trying to power up the device.”
He mentally slaps himself. Not what he needs to be focused on right now. And, he already knew by the gloves Paper Dracon wears all the time that he has slender fingers.
It takes Harry a little too long to realize she’s crying. He lifts his left hand out from the blanket and pats her on the arm.
“You had quite an unfriendly acquaintance with my son, but I suppose I can imagine the... effect finding him in such a state would have.” She stopped before him, the added thinness in her face accentuating the unpleasant scrunch of her nose. Or maybe she thought Harry smelt fouler than when they’d met before.
, although Harry can’t tell how they’re faring from this distance.
“Now?”
“Oh, I see.” Dracon tries to situate his body in a more dignified pose while still stuck to the bin. “You got tired of me always getting away, and now you decide to try your hand at being a
For a minute, Mr. Park’s hands clenched into fists on the table before they relaxed entirely. “We—we had a lot of garlic bread at the restaurant. When... When I was shoved into that alcove, I could... I could smell it on my d-date’s breath as those
Paper Dracon seems to choke on his next breath. “I . . . . You’re avoiding the question!”
As they stand in the yard surrounded by tall marsh blades, the back door opens and light spills out onto the grass. A moment later a silhouette fills the doorway.
“Yeah, pretty much figured that!” Ron shouts as he dodges the Thatcher statue’s attempt to tackle him. “He’s bloody well trying to poke out my eye.”
“Ouch, the betrayal,” Ron says with a hand over his heart.
Dracon flips the paper over in his hands so that the side with writing on it is facing him. “Remember our conversation a while ago? About your choice of alias?”
signed on it between his index and middle fingers. Five more minutes pass before he tears his eyes away from the faded inscription and focuses them on the open book.
When Paper Dracon speaks, the venom’s been replaced by exhaustion. “How about we quit playing around.” He turns to face Harry, dragon skull mask on, and lifts his arms, wrists up and hands clenched. “We both know this’s to arrest me.”
Harry pointed at the small ghost body parts still floating atop the table. “Those yours?”
“Okay,” Draco says. “Okay.”
Tracey glares. “What more do you want? Aren’t we done here?”
Shrugging, Harry casts his gaze at their surroundings so as not to look at the villain beside him.
He hops into the shower to wash off the sweat and grime. The warm water’s a mercy to his aching muscles, and he takes a moment to lean his arm on the wall, lay his forehead against it, and just enjoy the feeling of water droplets beating the tension from his back. His breath leaves him in a wheezy sigh.
the Agency wanted those people.”
“Letter for you.” Ron plops a thin, white envelope on Harry’s open history textbook.
Despite not wanting to look upon his face for Dracon’s sake, Harry can’t help but be touched by the gesture.
Speaking of him, Paper Dracon had apparently been bending down to pick up his dragon skull face mask when Harry’s blast had knocked him to the ground again. He’s struggling to a kneeling position while Harry hacks out the ash still in his mouth.
“Why, Potter?” he echos, taking a bold step forward. “I’m here on official business.”
“We have what we came for. Now move!” Fire states.
Biting his lip so hard he nearly pierces the skin, Harry moves to shield his eyes.
Mrs. Figg is prattling on about how the organization could at least have brought him flowers to put on his grave, but maybe that’s too much to expect out of bad people.
. You really
Like always, her dark hair is pulled back in a tight ponytail. “That’s not an answer.”
“. . . Thanks.” It’s whispered so quietly, Harry nearly misses it.
As GarGoyle and Paper Dracon dismount from the swan’s back, Harry can’t bite his tongue fast enough. “Feeling better, I see.”
The two of them circled around the treetops on different ends of the Manor gardens, hawks hunting any halos of light from the heather below.
— as a hero. Y-you and your partner, that is.”
“What does it say?”
Even so, Harry does not quite know how to word his misgivings about law enforcement without starting down a different long discussion. Instead, Harry says, “Yeah, probably. But here’s the other part of the whole hero instinct thing. I mean, from the beginning, I guess I sensed something was off. And today, when I let him go on purpose, I think I finally know.”
At Harry’s touch, Draco’s eyes flutter shut.
His eyes dart around the room, searching. Searching . . . .
Ron’s hand drops a fraction. “But, if it means we’ll be able to know more about the Villain Agency, we might learn more about what they’re up to . . . .”
The villain leans back and raises his voice. “Got ourselves a little new boy trying to play hero. And what a hero costume he has! Tell me, did your Grandmother knit that jumper for your dog? Are those used joggers? And did that mask come from a cereal box?”
Harry motions at the crate and holds up a single finger, the smoke too thick to be talking without wasting time coughing. Then he’s scrambling for the crate. In his excitement, he jams his face into the hole and jolts when he’s met by darkness. Cursing himself for a fool, he pulls away enough that light from the fire peeks through.
“Uh, Dracon?”
Delighted triumph floods Harry. He spins on his heel to go back the way he came and to try entering the fight still raging below.
Harry sighs and picks the note back up again before letting it fall to his lap. “So, what do you reckon we should do about this . . . invitation?”
“You know what? Nevermind that now. What, in the name of Merlin, are you doing in my flat?”
A rustling noise occurs, followed by three distinct
The two of them walk too far apart. They get knocked off their feet by a hoard of gargoyles diving in from the hole in the roof.
Draco’s brain short-circuits as icy dread floods his veins. Potter knows. Potter
Ron arrived at the flat the next evening for the interviewing session with Malfoy, carrying the slim folder for Malfoy’s Missing Person’s case, and, predictably, Malfoy clammed up about the details surrounding his demise.
“ . . . Yes. But my point is that even
Then Draco is racing out of the observation room after Potter. He pauses as he enters the empty stretch of hallway. Looking left and right, no sign of Potter appears; Draco hopes that he hasn’t Apparated home by himself. Pausing and trying to still his fast-beating heart, he takes the time to listen. He notes the scuffling noises coming from behind the door to the right, the one that leads to the interrogation room. Beyond that, he doesn’t hear much.
“It doesn’t make sense for you to attempt a petty crime—unless the Villain Agency really does pay you shit wages.” He scans Dracon’s form, most of the tears in his suit from almost two weeks ago still there even if most of the injuries have healed. “Though if that’s the case, why not just work an honest job?”
“Okay.”
—and that made me into someone—someone that eventually made
Potter’s silence is answer enough.
“Potter—” Draco flattens his hand and waits to feel it once more to be sure. “Harry, I think I feel your heartbeat.”
But he wants to know why and how Paper Dracon has come to be here when he’s been sequestered away for so long because of the trial. He says as much to him as Paper Dracon settles himself against Harry’s desk.
“Plank of wood I found lying around.”
which Harry cannot do without revealing he’s not who he’s portraying.
“Where’d you get this address from?” Potter could probably see Draco’s flinch at the sudden sound of his voice too. “It’s under Fidelius.”
“Was that all?”
They shake on that, and the heroine heads back to her group of people to relay the news.
“Oh, young Draco. I certainly do hope you’re not holding out because you think this golden hero will come for you?” His voice grows further away from the door and drops an octave. “When has a hero ever wasted his time rescuing a villain? His enemy?”
He finds the two of them in the kitchen, chatting with Mrs. Weasley about the good news and what Molly plans to make in celebration. Greeting Mrs. Weasley, he makes some excuses to her before dragging Ron and Hermione to the basement.
“Quite the opposite,” Draco says. “This place’ll warm us right up.”
“What have we here? A child causing this entire ruckus?”
For a while, neither of them move, sizing one another up. Draco imagines Potter to be having a better time of it than he is. He can probably hear the pounding of Draco's heart from across the room.
, Harry swallows hard and nearly chokes on his tongue. With unsteady fingers, Harry writes on the card:
“And how far have they come in their investigations? Are they any closer to finding those that killed my son?”
Harry wonders, as Dracon remains quiet, if he’d offended him again. Though, if that were the case, the villain has made sure in previous instances to make it known. Maybe Harry should just keep his mouth shut until the world stops spinning around him.
Silver wings beat against their joined hands as Draco breathed out, “I’ve finally caught you, Harry.”
Harry sends a zap at the legs of the charging horse. “Just do it!”
“While your sense of morality is commendable, my dear boy, Paper Dracon is still a villain wanted for crimes associated with the Villain Agency.”
At first, Harry was alarmed the Snitch would head toward the ley line. It likely didn’t interact well with ghosts tied to a place since Draco had never opted to use the line for travel. However, these concerns proved to be unwarranted as the Snitch took a sharp turn away from the line when it cleared the treetops.
“Great. Now, bugger off.”
“I—” Potter’s voice is strangled.
Kreacher leaves him to it with an exiting bow.
The second that they’re both steady, Potter lets go, and Draco tries not to feel the loss.
Instead, he strides into the room, bent on getting a glimpse through the window. As soon as he knows Blaizing Fire’s all right, he’ll head back to the medical ward, the soreness in his limbs and his growing headache agreeing.
“Yeah, I find that nearly impossible to believe. You’ve always jumped at the chance to see me miserable. Hell, you’re like a bloodhound—”
“Malfoy—” Potter’s voice is rough and loud in the space between them. “What do you want?”
what’s been happening to them!” Harry reached out a hand to touch the newly minted Silver Snitch, but Draco curled his fingers as though to shield the Snitch from another’s touch.
Draco breathes out in a huff. Excitement thrills through him—looks like they have the perp. But they still have one more victim to get to before they can close this bit out.
“You’ll have to go to the Coyle Ward. The area for trauma patients. That’s where they’d be after getting done at the Emergency Department.”
The villain’s head turning partially in Harry’s direction is all the confirmation he gives. “Had his identity been revealed, he’d have become a liability to the Agency. The only thing worse than failure in the Agency’s eyes.” His hand ghosts over the broken leg.
hasn’t stopped facing the direction of the villain.
While Ron works on the last few troublesome knives, Harry focuses on taking in the damage he’s caused. Multiple scorch marks where the lightning struck litter the red carpeting and the seats. Vice-Net’s on the floor like Fear-Near, groaning. His mask—which resembles an open pair of scissors with the handles being the eye holes and the blades resemble a sharp mustache that extends beyond the mask itself—lies cracked on the floor beside him. All that’s left covering his face is the Venom-like under-mask.
“I-I—” Mrs. Figg sets a hand over her heart.
Ms. Adams’ breakdown cuts off short as she looks up from her hands at Potter. Potter, who has removed the scarf wrapping from his head and is replacing the shades with his regular glasses.
It began decently enough, sure. He stopped the tube from derailing by short-circuiting its internal wiring and pulled a bloke back from being run over by a passing trolley car.
Harry couldn’t afford to ask. His thoughts of listening devices being planted in the room—or even a camera, heaven forbid—seems much more likely for a prisoner they’d been trying to break.
“Do you remember why there was an explosion?” Harry says quickly.
Without thought, he swings into the building, landing on an office floor. His trainers crunch the broken glass beneath him. Shaken from the experience, Harry takes precious time to collect himself.
“That can’t be good,” Harry says, gesturing to the spot where they’d left the villain unconscious.
“Hard pass.”
Draco pulled back first, eyes alight like
He stops walking under a streetlamp and looks at his hands. The gloves don’t belong to him. Neither does the costume he wears, nor the two masks placed over-top his head. All of it, apart from the under-mask, belongs to Blaizing Fire. Hermione only had to duplicate the look of the under-mask, since Harry was free to wear the red skull identification mask without compromising Fire’s privacy. He did, however, leave Fire’s matches, lighter, and lighter fluid back at the base.
On their way to the next victim on the list, Potter continues to follow him in that same manner he’d used before—behind Draco but not out of Draco’s line of sight. He keeps watch over Potter out of the corner of his eye while his mind whirls, unlocking the box of thoughts he’s shoved down deep. With what he’s observed today and over their last few interactions, Draco can tell something's clearly eating at Potter, only Draco can't discern if that something has to do with
Scrunching his nose, Harry says, “Should I send him a reply? To let him know I’m coming?”
“Shut up, Harry.” Ron’s grip tightens. “It’s locked.”
Finally, he decides that he should try to locate the villains maintaining the fire devouring the Hero Order’s headquarters. That should eliminate the source of light that everyone is fighting by, as well as potentially save the lives of people still inside the building.
“Blaise’s powers have always been useful for causing destruction.”
They all remain silent for a moment. Finally, Harry lifts his head. “What do you think the ‘urgent matter’ was?”
“Oh.” She flattens the part of her robe that covers her lap. “I don’t know. But it’s probably not remotely the same kind of tactics you kids used on him. Hopefully they can get the information they need.”
“Guys?”
“I’m—” The smoke’s too rough in his throat, and Harry turns away his head in a coughing fit. “I’m a Superhero. New one.” Though, he probably doesn’t look or sound much like one at the moment.
“Well, I’m awake. Great bloody job.” He scrambles to his feet, his back to Harry. “Now go home, hero.”
Taking him back to the Weasley household is out of the question. His friends and partners would never forgive Harry for unwittingly revealing the location of their base to a villain in the Agency’s pocket.
“Now.” Voldemort rubs his hands together. “You’re familiar, Draco, with what lies under this sheet. In addition to our upgraded
“Let me finish, will you?” Harry’s tongue feels heavy in his mouth. “If I win, you tell me what you know, and if you win . . . we’ll let you go.”
Hermione’s eyes go wide. “Oh, no!”
As strange as it sounds, hope flutters to life in Harry’s chest.
Draco stands on the stoop of Grimmauld. While he knows Potter would probably invite him inside, part of him figures they’d get caught up in conversation or get offered tea and cake by Potter’s elf. It’s truly best to not get held up. One loses both time and nerve that way.
Cho evidently hears them, as she says, “I’ll check.”
All of them appear too caught up in their individual struggles not to fall completely to the ground.
And that’s definitely not like Theo at all, and Draco feels so lightheaded that he can’t think straight—not that he ever really has—not with Potter looking at him with his burning eyes. Draco decides if Potter really did bite him and that this is some hallucinatory fever dream before death, he’ll take it. “Oh?" His voice comes out thin and shaky, but he presses on. "You’d prefer that over biting, then?”
“It’s more ‘require’ than ‘want,’ but sure.”
“Assuming the Polyjuice theory, since Elf magic should be able to track down just about anyone and anything, I’ll forgo asking much about what the vampire looked like when they were with you since looks can be changed in the magical world. And enough time has passed that they could have cycled through several other appearances." He tries not to dwell on the lost time between now and when Potter was bitten nearly six months ago. There have been cases with much longer delays of years and even decades before victims came to Draco's department. "Rather, I think we’ll focus on the description of behavior.”
Locating one of the remaining television screens hanging on the wall, he yanks down enough electricity to blast to pieces several of the gargoyles attacking Ron. “Run for outside!”
’ve forgiven me for my transgressions. Yet for all they know, I haven’t changed a bit! Merlin, people are more sycophantic than they were before the whole Dark Lord business—trying to pull me back into society’s good graces before I’ve even
Of course Potter would be difficult. Draco'd brought this on himself when he said yes to Potter, so here he is, living with the consequences. Shrugging, Draco sighs and turns back to the door. He knocks thrice sharply on the wood and calls out, “Hullo, Ms. Adams. I’m Detective Malfoy from the Ministry’s Department on Creature Incidents. You reported to us that you had an encounter with a vampire. My partner and I are here to discuss that with you.”
“But that’s the nature of a hero, right?" Harry says, thinking back to what Cho said earlier. "To care even when it hurts like hell.”
Hermione’s voice wavers.  “Heroes’ identities.”
The fingers Potter has pressed against his neck curl, tugging at the skin there. His head’s angled in such a way that the candlelight reflects a glare off his glasses, shielding the expression in his eyes from Draco. “I think... I remember. They whispered—they wanted me to call for help. Before I was bitten.”
Hermione sways excitedly, swinging her hands in front of her one minute, only to send them clasped behind her the next. “Oh, I’m so
“Hey, hey, hey! The guy may have changed his behavior around you, but I wasn’t just going to hand you an envelope without knowing what’s in it! He could've stuffed some kind of poison in there!”
“Oh, yes, sir.”
your cooperation with this case. But we can’t
“Well . . . . That was something,” Blaizing Fire says. Then he motions with his head. “Three doors down the next corridor.”
“The Ministry is really quite incompetant, though perhaps that stems from their disinclination toward the usage of Dark Magic to do what needs to be done. Did you know, Mr. Potter, they hadn’t given me any of Draco’s remains for a proper burial?” Narcissa didn’t wait for Harry’s answer as she flicked her wand at the ground and three neat little holes sprung out. Another flick and the carved-out Marks flopped into their respective holes. “This will have to do, for now. Come.”
“Are they threatening you? The people who stole the boat?”
“Because I always wanted to be one.” His eyes blink rapidly behind his mask’s tinted lenses. “And I knew . . . no matter how anyone viewed me or treated me . . . my actions would define whether I was a hero or not. Eventually, I made Superhero friends who acknowledged who I am. Damn good ones. Still—”
“The witness didn’t give me a good enough profile of him for me to know for sure. But if I had to guess, based on the situation he described, I’d say it’s definitely another Agency villain. And my money’s on
Everybody looks to the newcomer leaning against the other side of the stairway, opposite the way Cho came from.
“Red lights?” Harry nearly drops his pen.
“Cho?” Hermione taps a finger against her cheek. “Oh! Yes, I’ve read about you! Didn’t you disappear almost three years ago?”
“Do you mind? If I come and sit with you?”
Mr. Park wipes at his eyes. “Okay. Okay... and what is it that you needed from me?”
Nails biting into his hands through the gloves, Harry starts marching in the direction he thinks they would have headed. “They can’t have got that far! Come on, guys.”
, damn it!”
Her expression remains contemplative. “I…I don’t know. But I must have. I mean, he wouldn’t have stolen it from me. He could’ve just asked, and I’d have said yes.”
in the room, Harry does not know.
you?”
“Are you sure?” Hermione asks.
After he’s drunk the glass, he asks with a slurring voice how long he’s been out for and what happened, his memory a bit hazy.
When they had finished, Narcissa looked at him from the corner of her eyes. “Do you plan to turn me into the Ministry for what I’ve done?”
“Three,” Draco said.
As they exit the meeting room and head down a flight to the evidence room, all the young heroes chatter together about what it could be while Alpha Bee takes the lead. Despite the somewhat strained relationship between the Hero Order and law enforcement as of late, the two organizations will occasionally share case details if the evidence starts to point toward a situation best handled by the opposing agency.
In a most dignified, eloquent manner, Harry said, “The Aurors would need a body first. One hasn’t turned up yet, and revealing Malfoy’s a ghost could put him in danger. I mean, I don’t want professional exorcists coming to my flat and scattering Malfoy’s essence across the plains of existence. I don’t want that on my conscience.”
The door’s unlocked when Draco twists the knob, and when he steps inside, he finds Potter pacing like a caged beast, hands twisting in his hair. Noises that sound like words come from Potter, but they’re said too indistinctly for Draco to understand.
Harry opens his mouth to retort when he suddenly finds he can’t breathe right. It’s as if his heart is being squeezed inside his chest, and he feels cold, oh so cold.
meets them in the corridor. “I trust you all slept well?”
He would like to say that he resents it, but if this works to keep the older heroes safe until they come up with a counter-plan, Harry isn’t about to complain. To be honest, he knows he’s lucky to not be put on probation after making and losing that high-stakes bet with Blaizing Fire. Plus, the fresh night breeze that whisks into his masked face as he sits atop a roof in Shoreditch hardly puts a damper on his mood.
“So, what? You
On the other side of the building, he can hear the telltale cackling laughter of
Malfoy, still hunched over, glared up at him. “Pity me, Potter?”
Cho turns her face away from him and pulls her knees to her chest.
“I just mean... there are probably other jobs for you out there, ones where you’re not—” Potter gestures at Draco’s whole self— “uncomfortable a good portion of the time.”
Anything to not look at one another.
Elated, Harry drops his blanket and scrambles up the paneling to sit beside the heroine. His footing slips a few times, but he makes it in one piece—which is good considering he doubts Poppy would have the time to patch him up again.
She takes his silence for what it is. “You can ask me questions, but I may not answer all of them.”
During the particular moment, Draco lingers in the doorway for as long as Potter might need him for emotional support. Not that Draco thinks Potter finds him particularly comforting, but rather a face to turn to who’s already seen his current state—a non-reaction when the others get overwhelming. The two lock eyes three times, before Draco decides to leave Potter and his friends with some privacy.
“Well, it’s been fun, hero.” Dracon picks himself up from the ground, leaving Harry wondering when he’d been freed from the static cling pinning him to the rubbish bin. “But if you’re not arresting me for my petty crime or my federal one, I’ll be going now.”
Hermione makes a few more circuits of the room before the door opens again.
Ron’s hummingbird drops to the ground as a soggy mess, first. “Die, probably.”
“All right.” He goes to draw something from an inside pocket of his suit-like costume.
Harry frowns, and Dracon sees it.
, someone he grew up with, someone he’s spent hours memorizing every feature of—it all feels real in a way it hasn’t before. And Draco, coward that he’s always been, wants to
“Ahah, ‘course not, silly Ronnie-bonnie.” She lets go of Harry to tap Ron’s nose and giggles when he goes red. “Next week. Big release. Been wanting it for ages.”
A twisted feeling enters Harry’s gut.
. However, he collects himself as best he can and does his best to assure her. Yes, the escape on the heroes’ end might be more difficult without their powers to help them, but the way Harry and the rest of the free Hero Order planned it out, the captured heroes wouldn’t necessarily need their powers to succeed.
Dracon’s head is cocked to the side.
“Just not the testimony?” His nose scrunches as he thinks it over. “But if it’s truly relevant to your investigation, why wouldn’t they give it over to you?”
“What’s going on, mate?” Ron leans against the banister, arms crossed in front of his chest.
When he comes to, Harry registers that he’s lying on his back, arms spread wide and water soaking in, and only a light drizzle lands on him. Turning his head even slightly leads to a pounding headache. Harry lets out a loud groan.
“Well, I mean, not every person always feels joy after being helped. At least not right away. Sometimes it’s something they only feel years down the line. Then there are the people who express sadness for the people you couldn’t save, rather than happiness for the ones you have.”
Ron’s nodding. “Pretty quiet night for me in West London. Caught some kids messing with people’s brake-lights in Kensington. Had to break up a domestic situation in Chelsea, though. Kind of hard to do with my power-set.” Ron shrugs. “But I was able to hold the situation down until the police showed up.”
“Sorry,
was saying—can you tell us what’s going on? We want to know what we’re getting into. You know, so we can do our jobs—
“I was a prat in school—did more than devalue your intelligence. You didn’t have to be here, let alone do all this. So, thank you, Granger.”
“That’s why I picked it!”
He turns his gaze away from the fight below. His eyes take a few moments to adjust to looking in the darkness surrounding him rather than at the brightly glowing blaze. Slowly, he depletes the amount of electricity running through his system to zero. Now that he’s stopped glowing, he strides to the left until he stands at the corner edge of the roof.
Harry hadn’t originally planned on it, but now . . .
“You just said it’s been awhile since you’ve used your powers without your costume. You expect us to believe you have ‘em suddenly under control?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry strides for the crates on which Dracon has placed himself, keeping an eye peeled in the event of an attack. He makes it to the pile uninhibited, but he’s not about to let his guard down just yet.
Paper Dracon says, “Good to see you alive.”
help?”
Harry’s not watching Ron, and the horse keeps heading towards them, Harry’s attack too weak to cause harm.
Taking a leap of Gryffindor faith in his Slytherin instincts, Draco shutters his own expression to mirror Potter’s, and he juts his chin out haughtily. “You’ve been worried you’d attack someone, haven’t you?”
Dracon mumbles something unintelligible.
you, Potty.” Ghost-Malfoy clapped his hands in delight, though only a whisper of sound reached Harry. As he floated there, the three little peachicks fluttered up through the floorboards as well, with one circling Draco’s ankles, the second traveling unwillingly towards the ceiling, and the third bopping about the room.
When Potter reaches out and grasps Draco’s wand, the lack of contact between their hands is much more noticeable, less excusable than with the sunglasses.
Faced with the disapproval of his friends and colleagues, Harry rushes to explain. “Okay, I know this looks really bad, but just hear me out!”
said, it kind of was like my hero instinct was sensing something. That first time, I thought it was just because it felt wrong to arrest a bloke who’s unconscious and wounded.”
anything yet.”
Harry hears Ron choke on his tongue. Suppressing a smirk, Harry says, “We’ll think about it tonight and discuss it tomorrow, okay?”
Harry pushes his glasses back up his face and coughs into his fist. “And—and you just . . . took it from him?”
Paper Dracon gasps, his back arching off the ground. Then he starts wheezing and coughing as though choking on blood. For all Harry knows of the extent of his injuries, he very well might be.
. Related to this—to
first.
As it appears Tracey is struggling to decide if she can answer, Harry takes it off her hands. “I’ll assume that’s a ‘yes, but I can’t say.’” At her nod, he continues, “Why did they steal the boat?”
Dracon only seems to increase the speed of his pace, which turns out to be to his detriment when he stumbles and has to latch onto the alley wall.
Cho pushes her fingers beneath her mask to rub at her eyes. “Okay.”
Two of the villains collapse while the third falls to his knees. The light from the blazing building starts to dim as the rain finally hits, creating giant puffs of black smoke that rise and cover the surrounding area.
“Regret... yes. There are many regrets when it comes to my Draco. Tell me you’ll do anything to track down his killers and have them face justice for what they’ve done. Tell me you’ll do that?”
The Coyle Ward remains relatively quiet as Harry passes through its entrance doors; two nurses are stationed at its reception desk.
..........................................
Dracon is sitting at Harry’s desk, both masks completely removed.
Harry didn’t know whether peace would ever be possible for Narcissa after the fate that befell her son, or whether what she did to those that took him from her settled or fanned the flames in her heart. What he did know was that, upon walking into work the next day to inform the Auror Department he was quitting the training program, he encountered a flurry of chaos brought about by three bodies that had materialized in the Ministry atrium. Later, he found out from Ron that they were the bodies of the Death Eaters that the Auror Department had issued the manhunt for, but Harry had already suspected as much.
Harry knows he’s preserving the electricity he has left in his system to go against Voldemort. He doubts, though, that if he had planned to assist in these other battles taking place that he would want to get in Cho’s way.
But now,” she says, “you seem to have cared too much.”
“Hopefully satisfied your
“Yeah.” Harry’s right foot taps the linoleum. “Except, just recently, Paper Dracon said he thought Blaizing Fire gave away the rendezvous point so we’d have Dracon and let Fire go free in exchange.”
Excitement thrums in Harry’s veins as he dons Blaizing Fire’s costume once more. However, he hesitates before putting on the two masks and looks to the villain lying prone on the floor. Feeling determination drive him, Harry picks up the pen and notepaper. He scribbles out a note that reads
“Wait!” Harry yells in an odd parallel to this morning.
in the last chapter—though be wary of spoilers).
“Heya, mate,” he says as Harry walks into the kitchen.
“—oat that’s been passed down several gen—” Harry mutters with her.
“Internet, mostly. Local libraries were harder.”
Not receiving a zap, Ron commences in earnest to tug the sharp utensils from where they’re embedded in the wall. “You got
“Yes. If I want to be as effective as possible—”
The challenge hung there, Harry surprised Malfoy would make it so soon. Instead of taking the bait, Harry said, “And no more... unexpected visitors.”
“Eh, the thing is . . . I mostly just relied on my powers to control the lighting. I never learned how to handle the machinery. And they were in the middle of an important production—one that could put them on the film industry map. They couldn’t really afford to keep on an amateur lighting technician—especially one that already had to be part-time due to school.”
Heart pounding, he brushes aside some moss growing on the stone so that he can read the dates. He discovers that Kevin had been 17 when he died, and that the time of his passing had been earlier in April of the current year. Harry blinks and tries to remember when Mrs. Figg said Kevin had taken her boat.
“They wanted to hurt
Harry just stops himself from shrugging. Thinking back to Fire’s mannerisms from the interrogation room, Harry tilts his chin in that challenging way. Too late does he realize Fire probably acts much differently around his mates. Hell, Fire acts differently with Harry, Ron, and Hermione when they face off in battle. And he speaks
He thinks.  “Do you know why they would decide to—?”
Not quite trusting himself to speak yet, Draco just nods before walking out of the flat.
“Hold on!”
With a swift tread, he rushes back to the Weasley house to grab his costume.
When Malfoy cut off with a dark expression, Harry finished for him: “Voldemort.”
“What?”
Harry can feel the sweat sliding down his face underneath his mask. But with Hermione here, they might be able to hold out.
Harry ignored the leer Malfoy gave him.
Another thought suddenly occurs to Draco. “Say, Potter. How’ve you managed that blood loss problem?”
Still, the rush of power he feels makes his toes curl. He could probably power that paper bird forever now.
An image of Paper Dracon with his fractured leg submitting to the offered help of his enemy flashes through Harry’s mind. He starts getting out of bed. “Just what are they doing to him?”
She sniffles, but otherwise doesn't respond.
Voldemort had wasted his few precious seconds by trying to summon more
“No, you didn’t.” The wind whistled through them, almost drowning out Draco’s words. “And no, it wasn’t.”
“DEMENT?” Hermione mutters.
In the following months, the Hero Order is given a hefty fine for having thoroughly ravaged a “perfectly lovely house in Kensington.” Considering the group of heroes are struggling to pay for a new headquarters and that they already serve the community well, they get the fine cut in half in exchange for double the service hours in Kensington.
yourself here just to haunt me?”
“Well, it’s bad but probably not that bad, right? I mean, if you work at being a hero now, you might shave off a few years. It would mean one less enemy to worry about for us. Plus, heroes and villains learn one another’s true identities all the time. Yeah, it adds a little more danger to the mix, but overall, it’s something people learn to handle. I doubt the Villain Agency has anything groundbreaking planned on that front.”
“You don’t know me—!”
“I’m all right,” Harry says. “But are you sure you’re up for—?”
comes from behind him. Swiveling around, Harry sees Mad-Eye’s fist still on the counter.
He had attacked and killed the two heroes in their home just outside of London, just like he did with all heroes he goes after. The only hiccup occurred when he tried to snuff out the life of Lily and James’s son, a child one year old. Rumor has it that Voldemort’s villain power is quite terrible and is nearly insurmountable in battle—hence why all heroes would lose against him.
“Manners, Potter.” Malfoy placed a hand across his chest, right above where one of the peachicks had nestled into his chest hole, like he was offended. “Say hello back.”
, I’d have you yelling
Potter shakes his head when Draco twists his neck to look at him. “Probably less scary like this, honestly.”
Harry’s frozen in his surprise.
Harry suddenly feels sick, and his eyes blur. He brings his jumper up to cover his mouth and crawls in the direction of the first set of bodies. Seeing movement from Ron’s body brings Harry up short as he’s made weak with relief. However, when Ginny shoves Ron off herself and starts coughing, he’s filled with a mixture of relief that Ginny’s all right but immediate dread about Ron’s state.
Paper Dracon sighs. “Your point, hero?”
“With news about my boat?”
Harry knows the bastard’s enough of a prick to rub a dog the wrong way, so it’s not really a matter of whose shit list he’s on. Rather, it’s a matter of who’s ballsy or skilled enough to challenge him and cause serious damage.
back at it, using her Control over Form to change the size of the costumes the villains wear—either making it small enough to constrain movement or large enough to impede movement. Additionally, he sees her shifting the remaining pieces of roof above them into stalactites with nowhere to hold on to and nowhere to head but downward.
“Sorry to bother you, but would you know where the evidence items were put that were recovered from headquarters?” Harry bounces on the balls of his feet as he awaits her answer.
The first few moments after he removes the mask startle Harry into blinking. Everything is much brighter without the two layers covering his eyes, the full moon casting a light glow across the land.
“We will,” Harry says.
Potter nods his assent.
Harry does so and hates that he’s reminded that Dracon is nearly half a head taller than him.
Paper Dracon hops down from the roof, a dozen paper cranes lightening his fall. He limps toward Harry, stopping just before reaching the lamplight. “Bit quiet this evening.”
Harry thinks, but that’s as much thinking his headache will allow.
“Yeah.” The hollowness in Dracon’s voice freezes the blood in Harry’s veins. “What’re dreams to villains are nightmares for everyone else.”
A hissing sound comes from Harry as he rushes to obscure his view again. He can hear Blaizing Fire laugh. Suddenly, he feels the clothing hit against him as Fire evidently tosses the articles Harry’s way.
“Weren’t you recovering in the medical ward?”
“Okay, okay. Why are they threatening you? Are you involved with—”
the mould on your walls” and “just saying, you look way thinner than when Voldemort was hunting us like a niffler after gold.” Surprisingly, none of these arguments moved Harry’s heart from the path he’d found himself on.
Ron, being the best of mates, recognized a battle long lost with a sigh and an “I’ll handle the questions from here” when they handed over the evidence and a swarm of Aurors gathered around them. Grateful, Harry snuck away to the main atrium and Flooed over to Hermione. In another testament to Harry’s bonds with his friends, Hermione understood the slew of garbled words that rushed out of Harry, and, together, they Apparated to the Manor’s wrought gates.
He doesn’t know what she’s referring to or why the both of them are suddenly hugging him so tight. But he feels an odd sense of calm washing over him nonetheless, and he sinks into their embrace.
Harry turns his head towards them.
They walk outside to a deserted street. Even Blaizing Fire’s gone.
“Come insi—” She grabs at his hand and gets a shock for doing so.
“Allow me to rephrase: I need your help tracking this vampire down before they bite anyone
Sighing, Harry ran a hand through his hair and moved to sit on his bed. “Sorry,” he mumbled into his lap. “I’m being a prat about all this, but that’s because I don’t really know how to take it. Tell me—what would you do if your childhood rival showed up in your home with the news that he died?” And painfully, from the looks of it.
“No wonder he was stumbling around in pain.”
s, now he could just take people’s powers, and, while the robots would be the ones to have them, Voldemort would be the one to control the robots.”
Sighing, Malfoy stilled. “There have long been rumors I’d heard about the Underground Ghost-Gambling Goblin Market. Besides other types of bargaining, a lot of wheeling and dealing regarding souls go on there. Oh, don’t look at me like that, Potter. Ghosts of every kind of magical creature exist, though humans seem to outnumber the rest of the lot combined.”
“Rescued three of them, though. I’ll have to stop by the hospital tomorrow to see if the survivors knew the other victims. See if I can hunt down the families and let them know. Offer what comfort I can.” He shrugs like it isn’t a big deal. Like doing so will change anything.
“Oh, well, I—I know I sent an invitation, but I didn’t really
—think they followed us.” Ron’s right. The corridor behind them remains empty.
Cho has made it to Voldemort, already checked for his pulse, and is trying to get him to wake up again.
vampires, to ignore any other warning signs.” Draco’s voice sounds clinical to his ears, but any other tone would feel performative. “And smell tends to marry itself best with memories. Your reaction, Mr. Park, it’s not unheard of in your situation—even if you only consider your attack just a scare.”
“Well, maybe he’s busy.” Potter shrugs, his robes rustling against the railing as he does so. “We could come back later so we don’t keep anyone else waiting.”
“So, Blaise,” Voldemort starts, a chilling grin stretching his features. “The young villains have decided to send you along? Quite generous of them to give you another chance to redeem your disgraceful capture.”
“Blimey, that’s incredible dedication.” His blue eyes have gone soft with the affectionate look he sets on Hermione.
Potter’s arms wrap around Draco, and his breath tickles Draco’s ear as he whispers, “Breathe, Malfoy.”
The suspect stares at the chains wrapped around him, bewilderment crossing his features. “Why, what in Merlin’s name is going on, Aurors?” His voice is surprisingly soft coming from a man who looks like he could bench-press a troll. “Surely you don’t mean to imply that someone identified
says from Harry’s other side.
“—and you’re probably right.”
“You sure did a bang up job helping me when you blasted me—” he takes a breath that sounds like it hurts “—and stomped my hand.”
“Oh? And what
Harry’s head is spinning by the time they land on an upper level of the warehouse.
The vampire tilts his head, considering. Then he gives them that same charming look from earlier, only now the fangs twist it into something sinister. “All right. I’d be up for it.”
Starting to understand what the villain is getting at, Harry works to remove his own Agency-standard trousers in exchange for Fire’s more distinct ones—careful to move the communicator over to Fire’s trousers pocket. He goes to hand Blaizing Fire the clothing he wore, but the second they leave Harry’s body, Hermione’s copy of an Agency uniform dissolves into thin air.
“Hmm, I see.” Alpha Bee’s face softens from the radiant look it sported a few moments ago. “Then I suggest you head off and do that.”
“Oh, Draco Malfoy, is it?”
“I—were you being sarcastic?”
“Sir, please—”
or with Potter's condition. By the time they arrive, Draco still isn’t any closer to fitting the pieces together.
Near the end of Mr. Park’s tale, Potter excuses himself to the front parlour.
“I wouldn’t’ve dropped him if you hadn’t deadened my communication with the bats.”
Draco’s eyes have adjusted enough to the minimal lighting that he sees Potter bite down hard on his bottom lip, the smallest pair of fangs protruding. Before the War, Draco may have been enough of a bastard to take that kind of opening, a cheap shot right at Potter’s emotional jugular. He likes to think himself a different man than he was, so he pretends to have not noticed Potter’s slip of the tongue.
“Yes. I don’t know why you’re so surprised. You let that thing suck on your energy like a child does a juice box. And—lay back down! I just got you recovered to the point that you've awoken.” She firmly guides Harry back into the bed. “Don’t go overexerting yourself.”

made a breakthrough with the poison. The heroes affected should be all right in a few days.”
“Thankyou.”
and his breath kissing the sides of Harry’s face. He also loosened his hold on Harry’s hand enough that the Snitch slid from their fingers, disintegrating into a cascade of silvery magic that swirled up and into Draco’s chest and pulsed once before settling and sealing up the hole there.
“Well, thank you for the kiss, Malfoy.”
of yours.”
“Intensive—” As Harry’s blood pressure rises, he can feel the electricity begin to slip from his control again. “I’m afraid you still haven’t told me why you’re here . . . Sir.”
But as Harry looks at the paper lighting bird, realizes it’s manned by two people, and that Voldemort has two hands, he knows it won’t be enough.
Feeling his whole body start to shake in low hysterical laughter, Harry braces a hand against the stone wall.
“We knew the red lights had something to do with it, but they always stayed out of our reach. Our only hope had been that some of them must have overheated due to whatever they had been doing to us. Most of them exploded during our time locked in with them."
“But I want to.”
“Oi! Watch it!” Ron’s voice seems to come from somewhere far away.
. Harry opens his eyes again to see Blaizing Fire standing over the prone forms of the three other villains.
He waited until the swish of her robes against the underbrush had all but vanished in the distance before speaking again into the silence. “It’s rude, you know, hiding from your mother like that.”
“It is, a little bit,” Ron mutters.
Ron stares at him a moment, hands on his hips. “I don’t think that’s all there is to it, mate, but—”
“He and I may have our differences, and, as chuffed as I was that he gave you the rendezvous point, I must admit I was a little wounded that he thought I’d snitch.”
“I’m getting to that. So, anyway, during that Westminster fight, Paper Dracon had an
Looking up, it’s hard for Harry to make the figure out on the roof from the glare of the streetlamp. But, like with Blaizing Fire, Harry would recognize that voice anywhere.
“Okay,” Draco says, mouth dry. “And did—was there any sort of hypnosis, allure... anything?”
Somehow, by the end of it, Harry’s hands have tangled in Draco’s blond locks, and Draco has Harry pinned against the safety rail of the balcony with one of Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist. When they part, both are panting.
Malfoy stalled his ascent with the top of his head brushing the concrete ceiling. “Sort of,” he hedged.
model—” He lifts the sheet up enough to reveal the lower shelf “—I’m sure you’ll recognize your Agency costume. Blaise, I know what you’re thinking—”
Hermione sits on a bar-stool after she moves the box on top of it to the floor.
“I’m sorry!”
“Fuck off, then.” He starts stomping towards Ron.
A wheezing, choking noise comes from the other side of the door, and a new voice that Harry recognizes as
“What?” Harry asks, dread twisting in his stomach.
Ron throws his hand up as
“Hah! Not yet, you aren’t.” But neither would Harry if he didn’t spot the Silver Snitch soon, and the gauzy haze from running through the trees had not yet left his eyesight, causing everything to appear fuzzy at the edges. Or maybe he needed ghost glasses.
Since the attack, while spread even thinner than before, the uninjured heroes—both new and old—have taken up the patrols of the city.
Harry can certainly imagine what he must look like now, mask off as his power runs through him while on the moonlit grounds. The iridescent quality of the electricity coursing through the opening scar channels where his dark skin is visible and sending noticeable jolts along the fabric not made to contain it probably exude a power both dangerous and beautiful. Not to mention the way the whites of his eyes glow, backlit with the same power—probably the most surprising for other people, considering Harry shields his eyes with his tinted lenses when masked and powered up. Finally, it must be fascinating to watch the electrical currents affect his tightly curled hair, unraveling it starting at the roots until it stands on end.
Reaching the building, Harry spins around and tugs an electrical zap from one of the lamp posts nearby and strikes Blaizing Fire with it.
Draco’s mind supplies.
She sniffs dramatically and looks away. “I’ll go heat it up.”
“—but it’s not the only way. Even masked heroes have additional, uh, safety measures? Each one integral to keeping their identity safe.” Harry can feel sweat trying to crawl down his back. He doesn’t have to tell them about his scars since those wouldn’t be immediately affected by the lack of electricity present, and most of them aren’t visible in the tux like they’d be in his hero suit. His hair would deflate quite a lot but wouldn’t turn to his tighter curls until he removed all remnants of electricity. However . . . “M-my power . . . affects the way I . . . sound. To people. It’s like a mask—for my voice.”
Harry tries to contain his excitement as he follows Dracon in.
“Villain probation?” Hermione says, “Wonder what he could have done to warrant that.”
“Yeah, I know!” Ron raises an arm. “S’just—we’re toast if I guess wrong.”
“. . . We?” Harry casts a sharp glance his way.
“Yikes.”
Her lips press together in a wavering line like she always does when Hermione’s embarrassed, and she brings a hand up to her face as if to shield her pleased reaction from Ron as her brown eyes dart away from him. They land on Harry. “Oh! Harry! Before I forget.”
Her hand slaps the table. “These are
“I—No. No, I wasn’t going to—” Harry suddenly remembers his plan to appear innocuous. Biting the inside of his cheek, he powers down.
“Okay,” she finally says.
He opens his mouth to shout, and a flurry of the stuff flies inside and clings to the back of his throat. Now he’s the one choking, flinging his arms about to swat at the persistent horde around him, only dimly grateful for his mask covering up his nose and lenses shielding his eyes.
Malfoy’s eyes had been scoping out the nooks and crannies of the kitchen, and he did not notice at first when Harry’s form darkened the kitchen threshold. However when he did see him, his shock took the form of the widening of his eyes and the uncrossing of his arms, resulting in the revelation of a third ghostly peachick nestled securely in the center of his chest. With a
“Yes. The ones on the list are all located in, or off of, Diagon Alley.” He proffers the shaded glasses out to Potter.
Mr. Park latches onto the stove-top and nearly burns his hand, the other one clutching at his heart. “Oh!
“Oh, you want to jump right to it, then? Bit boring, but all right.” He runs his tongue along his front teeth. “What’s it like—that’s what you’re asking, right?”
“That’s everything.” Petty, interrupting the elf right back, but Draco knows he’ll need to get it out of his system if he’s to handle this situation properly.
“Mmm . . . .” Dracon pauses a moment. “To watch out for the last few stragglers still fighting. Pick them up or take them out depending on how the fight looks.”
He notices
Potter juts his chin out. “And if I don’t accept that?”
“I hate to leave him here like that. Don’t want him to be getting up and joining forces with the other villains.”
“But it’s pretty obvious, isn’t it? Who’s behind the attack?”
Both he and Ron watch as it shatters against the floor where they’d just stood.
After twenty minutes of Malfoy skirting their questions and the three peachicks growing steadily more agitated, Ron huffed out, “How about you just tell us where your body is, and we’ll puzzle out the rest?”
Unwilling to try powering up yet or speaking with his real voice to prove her wrong, Harry just makes a helpless gesture with his hands.
had salvaged some of her herbs before the fire had caught the medical ward.
Swallowing, Harry mulled it over—the sheer insanity of the situation he’d all but brought on himself starting months prior. How Draco would feel at Harry arresting his mother. “No... I don’t think I will.”
“Oh, honestly.” Hermione huffs. “Do you really think that would work?”
“Did you hear what she said?”
“Then how’d you break your leg?” When Harry glances back up at the dragon skull mask, it’s turned away from him.
“Do you know why I’ve taken your actions so personally?”
“Don’t know, really.” He moved as though to sit next to Harry on the bed and floated just above the spread, hands twisting in his lap. “Just remember going for my nightly promenade and musing how much my afterlife was wasted, knowing I couldn’t pester you. I wanted to haunt your every moment so badly, I felt it more than the air whistling through me.”
“Now,” he throws a glance at Harry, “that isn’t to say we should leave everything up to them. We, too, are required to put our best efforts forth. But that said, we can’t fret over what has yet to pass while the present stares us directly in the face.” He pats Cho on the back.
Dracon continues as if Harry had never spoken. “Take my alias, for example. Obviously, people know what Paper Dracon would represent! Paper and dragon—that’s me, the paper controlling dragon.”
A few tense seconds pass before she lays her head against Alpha Bee’s star-studded chest and releases a sharp sob.
With shaking fingers, Harry locates the pocket Dracon mentioned and withdraws a tiny paper swallow. He places it in Dracon’s waiting hand, then steps back to watch him work.
“If that’s really what you want to do, why not just learn how to work the tech box? That way, you can do what you enjoy regardless of your power's state.”
“Do you know who the accomplice was?”
He gestures at the gathered adults. “The police? The ambulances? The rest of the Hero Order? We’ve been on our own for over an
She shakes her head. “I’m tired of this! Of all this! I want everything to go back to the way it was—the way
“I don’t know. Does Polyjuice even work on vampires?”
“They found me. They found me here.” Draco gasped like he was sobbing and the water flowed faster off him. He choked out the names of three Death Eaters that had effectively disappeared around the same time Voldemort’s chances of winning vanished. Harry wasn’t surprised to hear Greyback among the names. “I was—I was—The baby peacocks. They’d hatched not long ago. They... gave me comfort during the war—with
“Oh-oh, you’re asking i-if
She turns her head away and presses her hands against her eyes. “I just wanted to have a good time. Th-that’s all. And then that—that
Deciding that he should keep going before he loses whatever nerve drove him to say all that in the first place, Harry says, “You really gave me something—er,
“Well, they’re not about to stay here. Out with you lot. I’ve already got enough ghosts to deal with.”
you didn’t do your section of the project yet.”
He’s still swatting and crunching the few little cranes left when a thud reverberates through the crate. Harry catches the last bird as it flits by his ear and casts his gaze upward to eye the new black-clad figure that approaches.
“What the hell are you doing out on a battlefield?”
“Don’t fret, Potter. I’m sure some treacle will be left.” Rolling his eyes works for both stalling and searching his brain for an excuse.
He feels a flash of irritation at the villain’s odd behavior. Perhaps that’s why he’s a bit more forceful than he’d intended with the next bit. “
Still, Harry lowers his hand cautiously until it’s at his side. He tilts his head and walks around the ditch for a better angle.
our worlds run a little differently.”
As Harry watches its slow, unsteady progress towards them, he wonders why it had inspired such fear before.
Draco stands beside her, one of his supervisors on her other side, as she steps up to the window and peers into the adjacent room.
“Quiet type? Or you’re awestruck to see a
Her head jolts up, a look of horror on her face. “I—Leave. Please, leave.”
Instead of answering, Draco tugs again lightly on Potter’s sleeve. “Hold onto that—what you’re feeling right now. And come here. Please.”
Harry and Ron shift to block Hermione from the villains’ view as she brandishes a leather-bound book and a worn blue pen. She places the tip onto the page and begins to write where she left off.
Draco stomps down the childish part of him that wants to snap back. “Just because something presents a... challenge doesn’t mean I hate it.”
“Are you implying they sure as hell recognised me?” The new wolfish smile he flashes at the Auror shows off the largest and sharpest incisor Draco has seen in a year. It certainly makes Ms. Adams and Potter’s fangs look like mere baby teeth.
“Harry.” Draco’s tone was so soft, it was a wonder Harry heard him at all. “I’ve always wanted to hold your hand. And no wishes on peacocks gave that to me—
Harry’s smile softens. He raises his arms to shrug, but Paper Dracon mistakes it for an invitation.
I’m glad it was you.”
“Ah, not as much as usual,” Harry says in a placating manner. “Not since
Harry hadn’t yet figured that out.
that causes him to stop in his tracks.
Dracon’s chest rises and falls swiftly against Harry’s clenched fists.
Ms. Adams suddenly sucks her lips into her mouth, having noticed Draco watching.
It’s two weeks since Draco saw Potter last, and despite the trouble he could get in should his department find out—the fact that Potter’s practically an Auror is hardly a good enough excuse—he can’t help but feel thrilled to be seeing Potter again.
Paper Dracon gets sentenced six years for involuntary manslaughter and breaking into a government building, yet has that sentence halved for his assistance and service to the public during the Raid and Rescue.
Harry takes a step back.
The villains are nowhere to be found.
Fiddling with a coat button, she doesn’t answer.
“You look well,” Draco says. And he means it, for all that he never met her prior for a comparison, since he’s seen vampire victims come out the other end of an attack looking much worse.
“You’re right, Mr. Potter.” She looked off to the side. “I couldn’t have protected my son—I couldn’t even protect him from falling in with the Dark Lord. And still, he insisted on staying behind to pay for the mistakes grown-ups made.”
“Easy,
He’s nearly out into the corridor when “Kensington, 8:00pm” follows him out on a breath of air.
“Mrs. Jenkins’s kids were asking after you. I had to warn them off playing in the street, but they wouldn’t leave until I let them know that
A million thoughts crowd Harry’s brain.
“Well, yeah, I thought that too. But, if the Villain Agency doesn’t want useless villains on their hands, wouldn’t it make more sense to fix up his wounds and tears in his suit so they wouldn’t be a problem?”
Harry turns to go, but whips around at the jangle of handcuffs, the scrape of a chair, and a hoarse, “Wait!”
He feels a smile spread across his face.
Harry doesn’t have a key for this, and he hadn’t thought that far ahead.
“Only if we bugger off together.”
Ron’s fingers tap at the table. “Didn’t he say something about ‘being useless’ is a bad thing?”
“Well,” Draco finally says. “This is the most boring fight I’ve ever had with you. Don’t tell me you’ve turned
Just as promised, he doesn’t fully close the cell door. Harry pockets the key rather than running it back to the laboratory; now, at least, if a villain stumbles upon the unsealed door, they won’t be able to lock it again.
The long cut on his arm and the scratches from Vice-Net’s knives did sting severely; an indescribable ache creeps into Harry’s bones. He sits down on the cobblestone but refuses to acknowledge Hermione’s right. She knows she’s right regardless.
Slowly, as if not to spook Harry away, Dracon takes a step forward and lifts a gloved hand until it hovers two centimeters from touching Harry’s cheek. Then his hand makes a stilted caressing motion, still careful not to touch Harry’s face. “You’re . . . .”
Behind his lenses, Harry closes his eyes. “I see.”
Draco can’t place the glazed look that enters Mr. Hendricks’ eyes; he only knows that it unsettles him.
! Here to see some patients?”
Harry closes his eyes and remembers why he doesn't gamble. He always hated a losing hand.
Since Dracon hasn’t moved much aside from his initial reaction, Harry goes for a friendlier smile. “You wanted to see me?”
He mentally braces himself for what they are all about to see as
fan'?”
Standing as he is on the edge of the battleground, Harry debates what would be the best course of action. He wants to help, but his powers would be too erratic in all the rain. He would be much more likely to accidentally zap his fellow heroes than strike any of their enemies. The last thing he wants is to become a hindrance rather than a help in this situation.
Maybe
Exhausted from the extra strain on his abilities, Paper Dracon allows the paper bird fall to apart.
“Like you have room to judge! I saw you save a cat from a tree two weeks ago!” Paper Dracon leans on a rubbish bin for support. How he thought he could get away with that limp—hell, how he’s already managed to get away with that limp—Harry will never know. “Talk about cliché, hero!”
Dracon hesitates. “No.”
“Tell me. How does it feel now?”
“Piss off.”
Harry takes off the dragon skull mask and juggles it between his hands as he eyes Paper Dracon. If Dracon did get sentenced tomorrow, would Harry
Still uncertain as to how Dracon would react when he finally sees Harry, he decides to power down again so as to appear as innocuous as possible.
“Two,” Harry called back.
Harry patiently waits for him to continue.
Unease rises within Harry. “He’s all right, right?”
At first, his fellow Superheroes are reluctant, considering the bloke is not only a villain but also a villain who helped steal hero identities, attack the Hero Order, and lure Harry into a trap. While Harry agrees those are all good reasons to not want to assist Dracon, he continues to lobby in the villain’s favor. He cites Dracon’s reluctance and the sense that the young villain has been pressured into the role he has played—as also witnessed in the other young villain, Blaizing Fire. Most importantly, Harry mentions how Paper Dracon aided Harry in his escape—at great risk to himself. This last point, compounded by the others, convinces the Hero Order to spend precious resources in hunting down Dracon’s whereabouts.
As much as he’s tempted to take stock of how the heroes are holding up against their opponents, Harry knows he has to focus on his self-assigned task. From his view on the roof, he casts his gaze about for any figure that looks to be directing their attention to the burning building. A few different suspects catch his eye, some standing apart from the other figures while the others blend in the crowds of people clashing. While Harry thinks it would be a somewhat smart stance for the villains to cloak the perpetrators of the arson in the groups attacking the heroes, he also believes that would make them too vulnerable to being taken out by accident. He doubts the Villain Agency would take such a risk considering how cautiously they’ve behaved thus far. That said, this whole attack would appear to spit in the face of their cautious behavior.
Potter moves as though he plans to Disapparate, but he hesitates.
When Harry sees Hermione this evening, he’ll have to tell her he’s a definite
“Well.” Draco wets his lips. “Bite me.”
Feeling warm under his collar, Harry pokes at his pie.
Carefully, Potter picks up his spoon and shoves some ice cream through his mouth slit.
Draco’s been thinking over a surprising offer he'd received at the beginning of the month for the last several days, and when he gets an owl from a different unlikely source, that only settles it. Still, his hand shakes a little as he writes the message; the words come out illegible, and he has to scrap it entirely. With a fortifying breath, he starts over, and his handwriting steadies:
Harry shakes his head. “Extraction point’s over there.” Then he gestures to the far bushes.
This is Ron’s territory exclusively now for over a year, and Harry tries to feel confident with him at his side. Ron certainly walks like he has nothing to fear in these streets, the same way Harry‘s come to feel in Shoreditch. Hands behind his head, Ron slants a look Harry’s way. “So what d’you think Fire meant exactly? You reckon it’s a rendezvous point or some kind of ambush?”
moves to even out the spread from Harry’s wrinkling. “Hmm . . . . You should have been thinking that way before you decided to mess with it.” She pauses a moment. “That said, it isn’t ruined completely. Just in more pieces than when it arrived. Though, it might have some water damage from Cho’s attack.”
