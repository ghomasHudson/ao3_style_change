It was their final day of Easter holiday. Tomorrow, Hogwarts would be full again and classes would resume. But until then, Harry and Draco had no problem cuddling in the common room and eating dinner together. There was an unspoken anxiety between them about what would happen if news of their relationship got out. Some people wouldn’t care, others might be angry. But in truth, there wasn’t much more that could be done to hurt them. The only people who mattered to them already approved of their relationship.
“Harry, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Only do this if it's what you want.” Draco didn’t want to discourage Harry, but he also didn’t want Harry feeling like he had to.
Harry blushed lightly, “I’m fine Draco.” He had never received a massage before. But based on how they were depicted in movies and TV, he knew they were relaxing and felt good. He had a bit of a sensitivity to being physically vulnerable around others. You could hurt him all you wanted, but he prefers pain to pleasure. With pain, you don’t like it, you hate it, you can be angry and have a wall built up. You can defy and resist. Even if you are vulnerable, you can still be tough and defensive. That wasn’t as readily possible with pleasure. The thing about pleasure is that people weren’t designed to fight what feels good. Harry couldn’t have his wall up. He was inherently more vulnerable.
Harry handed over the scroll. "Luther, the man I had you build up, it's time to take him down. I have evidence linking him to three acts of magical violence against Muggles but he was never investigated or convicted, because the crimes were committed Voldemort-era."
Harry was softer than that. He did enjoy Draco’s fantasy much more than he’d like to admit, but it wasn’t his. He liked it warm and loving, he wanted to be complemented, teased, he wanted nothing but pleasure. Draco knew exactly what he needed.
Harry cracked a smile and rolled his eyes. “They sound so corny. They’re probably excellent, but they seem really corny. Let me guess, the one you like is the adventurous one who’s a bit of a bad boy and he’s really cool but has a soft spot for his paramour. The paramour being more innocent and naïve, and he’s the one you identify with.”
“I can’t say I miss him all that much.” Harry started, a bit cross, “Dumbledore knowingly put me in an abusive home, there’s no excuse when I had Remus still out there. Hagrid made it sound like even he was willing to take me in. Dumbledore had other options. He didn’t have to put me in that place. But he did.” Harry huffed as he was hit with another realization. “Hell, he was in the Order! He knew Sirius, but he did nothing for him! Probably because he knew he couldn’t manipulate Sirius like he could Snape, used the memory of my mother like a pawn. I could‘ve had my godfather.” He backtracked a bit and clarified, “I’m not saying Dumbledore didn’t have good intentions, those intentions were to take down Voldemort. But his means, they were immoral and manipulative. Perhaps I’m just angry about having been a pawn, but it’s inexcusable to me.”
He played with Draco’s lips a moment before leaning down to kiss the boy. It was a soft and sweet kiss, but it took away Draco’s ability to hide his sounds with panting. He was forced to let out a whine against Harry’s lips.
They tried on clothes and looked at jewelry. While looking at some bracelets, Narcissa noticed Draco’s. Silver and sparkly with charms of different flowers made in great detail.
His breath caught in his throat. This could go two different ways depending on how he responded to such a simple question. In the end, he couldn’t resist.
Draco’s aura of superiority didn’t falter for a second. “You’re half-right.” He said in a teasing tone. “I do have a thing for, the savage animals of men. But I don’t need to be taken. No. I know my place, and that’s on top. I want to tame you.
He wanted to forget, he so badly wanted to forget. If he forgot then he didn’t have to deal with it. Maybe he was just avoiding the fear. Maybe this was the way his brain decided to protect itself. By staying inside where there are no attackers.
Harry's face went red and he looked away. "How did we go from discussing Malfoy and I to my bloody masturbation habits?"
“It’s about the principle of it! You stole my door, ate it, and you teased me. I’ll have my revenge, Potter!”
“Draco, we’re going to Teddy’s first birthday, not a bloody ball! He isn’t going to remember and Andromeda and I are going to be the only ones there.
“Yea. I-I feel like .....” He trailed off, wanting to be honest but not sure how. He decided to let everything spill out. It was about time he told someone. “It hurts Hermione. It really does. We’re so close, I wake up in the same bed as him, we lay so close, we talk about everything, he makes me so happy, he’s so lovely. But he isn’t mine. And that hurts. I never knew I could hurt like this before.”
Harry was surprised by the statistic, then his expression changed to that of light trauma. “All those years, with four other boys.....” he trailed off, in shock by the sheer amount of discreet getting off that would amount to.
“I could send you anonymous Howlers about how pretty your hair is.” Harry joked, referencing their conversation a few nights ago where he revealed his attraction to Draco's hair.
"We were both stupid kids who were forced into these stupid roles for a stupid war that neither of us wanted to be apart of. We've both done bad things but neither of us are bad people. So alike, we are. I think that's why we're together. We deserve each other." He pressed a kiss to the top of Draco's head and smiled. "You wake up whenever your ready. When you do, I'm going to spend the rest of my life making you feel loved."
"To make sure they were strong enough to survive. We wouldn't want to reintroduce them to their parents and have them die shortly after."
Draco tilted his head. “I haven’t really done much. I spend a lot of time with Pansy and Blaise, but at Potter’s house I don’t so much besides read.”
Draco sets up Neville and Hannah, discusses Teddy Lupin with Harry, and finds himself wrapped up in Harry’s newest secret society.
Harry bit his lip and shifted ever-so-slightly, his body hardly even moving an inch. “Are you serious?”
." He motioned between themselves. "Our entire dynamic. You've seen it! We dance around each other, borderline avoid each other, at best we make awkward small talk, and then we go into our own little worlds and pretend the other doesn't exist. We might not want to be, but we're married. We cannot keep acting like this if we ever want to get along."
Poor Dean and Seamus were completely unaware of what their friends were up to. They were laying in their dorm together, in separate beds, talking to each other. They were talking about everything under the sun. Their classes, professors, futures, and who they wanted to end up marrying. No topic was too personal for them. They were like open books to each other.
Harry gathered his stuff and went back to his dorm, and he sat down on his bed with a grin, deciding he was done reading for the rest of the day, he’d spent many of his brain cells forming his brilliant idea.
“Tell him that Andromeda is doing well. That she’ll never have to work a day in her life. I’m taking care of her and Teddy. He doesn’t need to worry about them. Tell him I’m going to buy a house and Teddy will have a room there so he can come over anytime he wants. Tell him I’m going to teach at Hogwarts so I’ll be able to watch out for Teddy everyday. Tell him Teddy’s cousin Draco is looking out for him too. Tell him Draco reads to him all the time and is trying to teach him French even though I think it’s pointless. He’s a baby, he doesn’t need to know French. But tell him Teddy’s already better at French than I’ll ever be. Tell him that Teddy will have all the clothes, toys, and books he could ever want.” He hiccuped as he tried to calm his breathing. “Tell him Teddy isn’t going to grow up like us. He’ll have it better. He’s gonna be better than we ever were.” Harry sniffled. “Tell him I’ll make sure Teddy lives an amazing life. Tell him he didn’t die for nothing.”
Only a few hours later, Harry approached Draco with a red carnation in hand. He gave Draco a shy smile and presented the flower.
Of all things, Alex ended up giving the story of Garren to a gossip column. For as excited as they once were to bruise the man's ego, the story almost felt beneath them. As if it was so petty and useless that they couldn't be bothered with it. It was similar to the way Hermione and Harry felt about the whole situation. For everything they've done, Garren felt like nothing.
He smirked, “I wrote it because that’s exactly how it happened. You’re a shiny virgin Harry, untouchable and pure. But there you were, giving in to your most carnal desire. The Golden Boy unable to resist temptation. It was poetic and beautiful.”
"And your parents don't have to know. Not now, at least. Who you talk to at a little Ministry party is hardly their concern."
Harry had been riding a high, until breakfast the next day. That’s when a Howler arrived. He didn’t recognize who it was from and the Howler didn’t say. The voice was obviously male, but it was distorted to sound unrecognizable. All it said was, “You have gorgeous eyes, Potter!”
"Mum, please. I'd like just another moment alone, then we can have tea." The voice came from inside, sounding nervous.
Harry didn’t even blink. “What an idiot this person must be, though his intentions must be very noble and romantic.”
“I didn’t even say a spell, I just screamed. I heard it in the air before I even realized it was coming from me. My wand ..... I don’t even know where my wand was. I just screamed and reached out towards him, and a spell came out. It was only locomotor mortis, which bonded his legs and kept him from running away. Unfortunately, he had a counter-curse to undo the jinx and escape.”
“Not if that bulge in your pants is going to be pressing up on me.” Draco said as he looked down at it.
Draco smirked and pulled his tongue out. “Anything for you.” He was entranced by Harry, unable to deny such a plea. He slipped his tongue in as deep as he could, slowly letting it squirm inside of his lover.
“Oh, come on now. They aren’t even in love yet.” Ron pointed out, making sure to end his statement with “yet” as it was obvious that it was eventually gonna happen.
Harry tilted his head back and hummed. “You make it so hard to resist, pretty boy.” He recognized there was no way he could hold back his reactions, so he let it all out.
Instead, Harry was silent for a while, his eyes flickering to look at anything else in the room. “I-I.” He tried to find words after a moment. His lips parted and his tongue searching for language among the syllables that were caught in his throat. But he’d no way to communicate.
On the train, his eyes were glued to the window into the hallway. He wanted to see who else had arrived. He saw Neville, and he actually burst out of his booth and into the corridor to hug him.
“I have something to show you. A little reward for being so lovely.” He suddenly found it easier and easier to give Harry the pretty words he craved.
Draco aimed his wooden spoon at Harry with a playful look in his eyes, but his grip was off, unsure between the hold of a weapon or a wand. “You’re a liar and we both know it.”
Hermione stared at her a moment, a thousand unspoken words in her expression. She stepped towards the taller woman, yet somehow, seemed to tower over all. "This
Harry couldn’t quite figure out why it was so hard to breathe in that room, why he averted his gaze whenever Lucius glanced his way, how the sound of the man’s voice had him on the verge of exploding, or how the sight of him made Harry sick. Everything about the man made him so incredibly stressed out. He wanted to scream. His only comfort was the fact that it was finally finished. He couldn't wait to get away from Lucius.
Marital contracts were typically worked out by the families of the betrothed. Naturally, Harry asked Molly and Arthur to represent him. They agreed.
The next day, Harry found himself pacing outside of McGonagall’s office. He wanted so badly to speak with her, but he was nervous about what to say. He wasn’t sure how to ask such a thing from her.
Harry blinked a few times and blushed at the question, opting to not take it seriously. “Very funny.”
He cringed a bit, but smiled. “It was once. Don’t say it like I do that all the time, people will think I’m creepy.”
They gave the example of Effie Crow, a name that Harry recognized as a serious player in the elite. In their tirade, they told Harry she once supported a group’s attempt at creating a reformed program at St. Mungo’s with better training and pay. She only did it to make herself look good, and when she was told about the remaining financial cost, she refused to pay for it or organize a fundraiser. When Harry asked what the cost was, he was floored to hear it was only three hundred and fifty Galleons.
“You do realize you’re wearing a Slytherin jumper under your robes.” Hermione pointed out, trying to further her point and make Harry understand.
Draco shook his head, “Have I done something wrong?” Given his track record, he assumed he was in trouble.
Draco blushed and tried to frown, but was overcome by a smile. “Shut up, Potter. I’m suppose to be charming you, not the other way around.”
Draco got up and went to sit beside Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry and kept him close as he sobbed.
A hand rested on his side while Draco’s lips came down to meet Harry’s neck. He sighed and closed his eyes at the feeling. His back gently arched and his breaths grew deep and quick. The kisses lulled him into an aroused yet relaxed state while Draco’s hands roamed to remove his tie and unbutton his shirt. Draco loved that he could hush and pacify Harry with just a few kisses in the right place. It almost made him feel powerful.
"It's fine, you have a right to be concerned." Harry reassured her and gave her a polite smile. He then motioned to the basket, "Biscuit?" He offered.
“Why are we talking about this? How did the trial go?” Draco asked, wanting to change the obscure subject.
Draco gripped the boy in his warm and wet hand, eliciting a small whimper from Harry. His still observance of Draco had ended and the small drop of touch that he was given was enough to make waves inside of him. It shook him from his trance and he was suddenly aware of his need again.
Pansy laughed and shrugged. "Legally, yes. Don't get all territorial just because his jeans fit him well."
“I know Draco didn’t come around this year. But, uhm, I was wondering if he might want to take part in it next year?” Molly asked with a small and hopeful smile.
He felt his heart break a little. Even if Lucius didn’t make the best decisions, that was still his father. He knew his father wasn’t above murder, but he didn’t think it was possible that he could kill his own wife. He wasn’t sure what to believe, but he wanted his mother to be safe.
In his arms he carried a small basket where warm brownies sat wrapped in a dish towel. Harry had gotten up at some ungodly hour of the night and decided to bake. The smell woke Draco up and they ended up silently goring themselves on the dessert, both going back to bed just before sunrise. Harry offered some for Draco to take to his mother, since he knew they were meeting.
Harry noticed the raised eyebrows of his friends, so he elaborated and told them about the joke he made about sending a Howler to embarrass Draco. “But I didn’t think he would actually do it.”
Neville and Hannah have found a home in Hogsmeade since Neville will be working at Hogwarts and Hannah can Floo to her Ministry job.
Harry had been making lunch and minding his own business until he caught sight of the paper. He looked shocked and read it over. The anger and embarrassment in Draco's expression made him put on his own look of shame. "I was under a truth serum, I couldn't lie or omit information."
The silent room prompted Narcissa to take her leave. She had stayed longer than she expected and knew that Draco needed to deal with this on his own. She gave Draco a long hug before leaving.
It was then that Harry remembered he’s a virgin. His jaw dropped. “You did that on purpose. You sly bastard.” He was more impressed by Draco’s plan than anything.
Draco glanced around the table and grew a small smirk. "We ought to pick up some wine when we go shopping for a tree. Italian pairs wonderfully with a red wine."
There it was. Another hint of shock to hit the members of Wizengamot. They couldn't believe the story they were being told. All that pain and suffering he told of, the anger and sympathy they felt, and now, they were being told of care. Genuine care.
“Well it’s true. I want to marry my best friend. I think that’s the best person to fall in love with.”
Harry didn’t blush like Draco expected him to. He just sort of shrugged and softly said, “O-Okay. Sure.”
He always wondered about the marriage of his parents. He wondered for how long they dated before they wed, he wondered about when they realized they were in love, he wondered about how his father proposed. He knew he’d likely never know the answers to those questions, but he wanted to find out for himself. He wanted to know how long he’d date his future spouse before they wed, he wanted to discover true love, he wanted to get on one knee and hold up a ring to someone special.
Seamus nodded. "I didn't really think you would, but if you did, that would make the most sense." They continued their conversation for a few more hours before Seamus seemed to remember something. "Oh, I brought something for you." He said as he pulled something out of his bag. He sat a copy of Witches Weekly on the table and looked up with a grin. "Turn to page twenty-seven."
He went back into his sitting room, thinking about the impending holidays. He glanced around the room and realized that he should find space for a Christmas tree. He took a rough estimate of the height of the room before realizing that he should probably get Draco’s input on the matter. After all, they shared the house and Harry owned no Christmas decorations whatsoever. He was starting from scratch.
In the middle of it all was a baby with teal blue hair and big brown eyes. His face was a spitting image of Remus. He was laying on his stomach, looking around at his toys, occasionally picking one up and shaking or chewing it.
He poured them both a cup of tea and offered her the large amount of sweets he’d baked. Thankfully, he only made four batches of brownies before the need for sleep forced him to stop.
To his surprise, he looked and saw Teddy had the jacket wrapped around his front. “Dog smell.” He described.
Draco wasn't sure what to expect when he stepped into the Romanian dragon sanctuary. He correctly assumed that the director would be happy to see him and that Harry would be late. He was set up in an unused office that he would use as an interrogation room of sorts.
As much as Harry hated to say that they were married, he knew he had to. "I am family, I'm his husband."
Especially Harry. He knew exactly how much it meant to Draco that he be a Healer at Hogwarts. Even if he wasn’t to take over the hospital wing, healing people matter to him more than any of that.
Harry blushed darkly and looked away. He didn’t know what to say. He wanted to, but he hesitated for multiple reasons.
Harry stared at Draco. Part of him wanted to just walk away and not deal with it, but that would solve nothing. He that there a moment and sighed. “I suppose killing can be traumatic. But I think numbness is ideal. I’d rather feel numb than feel bad about killing that monster.”
Hermione picked up a pair with silver lilies for charms. She eyed Harry's roses and offered the necklaces.
Harry, meanwhile, was incredibly confused. As much as he wanted to ignore it, he couldn't get past he fact that he was fantasizing about curling up on the sofa with the man beside him. He's never wanted that before. Of course he's enjoyed having his significant other sit in his lap and he likes hugs, but cuddling was a concept too foreign and vulnerable. It was kind of intimidating to him. Yet instead of feeling uncomfortable or awkward about his thoughts they only made him feel warmer. That alone told him something was very wrong. Idle conversation continued as he tried to get himself sorted in his head.
He gave a nod, satisfied with the answer. “Thank you. Really. It-“ He cut himself off with a soft chuckle. “It means a lot to me. I really appreciate that you would do that for me.” He took a deep breath. “You probably already knew this, but I never hated you. No matter what you did, I really never hated you. You were annoying, and man did I love beating the snot out of you, but I never hated you. I never saw you as an enemy.”
Draco’s back arched sharply and he finally felt it. The pleasure that rested just beyond him, lurching like a wild animal to it’s prey, and he was overcome. He threw his head back and cried out, sounds ripping from his throat, curses and Harry’s name falling from his lips as he came.
Harry looked at Draco in surprise from where he stood in the Floo. He gave a sheepish grin and felt a bit bad about scaring the other. "Apologies." He said as he shrugged off his Wizengamot robes. He hated wearing them. He thought the plum color looked absolutely ridiculous, not to mention the fabric didn't feel too great. "How was your talk with Seamus?"
“I won’t.” He glanced around and then pulled her aside, away from everyone else. He had to talk to her while he had this moment. He had to tell her everything. She had to know.
“But you like it.” He sighed out his words. “You love how brutish I am. Compared to you, I’m feral and free. And that drives you almost as wild as me.” He let out a soft grunt, growing frustrated with the pace. “Don’t be so composed Draco, give me more.”
“Your shirt looks wonderful, I love the few large flowers on the front. I think the patterns covered in the same tiny flowers are so hideous and old. My nan wouldn’t even wear them.”
Harry was still shaking. He was right in his assumption that this was going to be more intense than his previous orgasms. Though it wasn’t by much, it made a difference. He rested his eyes a moment. The feeling of Draco trying to lift off of him felt a bit overpowering on his sensitive cock. He gasped and bit his lip.
They picked out ornaments and a skirt for the tree before Draco lost himself in decorations. He picked out mistletoe, a poinsettia wreath, he got a silver vase and some roses for the kitchen table, a dark green dining cloth for the season and to complement the roses, he got pinecones and red berries to decorate around the vase. He also snagged a few candles, wrapping paper, ribbons, greenery for the fireplace, and snow globes.
It was no secret that Seamus is gay, but Dean hasn’t said anything about his sexuality, only that he loves Seamus.
Harry gave an unamused glare. “First of all, I would never. Secondly, we were melting gold and silver.” Perhaps their secret wouldn’t go to the grave with them, but Harry definitely wasn’t going into detail with it.
Harry only whined. “Sod off.” He sat up and leaned back against the headboard. He opened his arms but his eyes remained closed as he was still quite tired.
As they drifted off, Draco made up his mind. He was one hundred percent certain he was going to get Harry to let him bugger his arse.
Draco returned to his seat and rewrapped his scrubs, putting the clothes and the letter in his bag. Those scrubs meant the world to him, just like the silver around his wrist and Harry’s neck.
Draco gave a small smile. "I understand, I wasn't comfortable reading that sort of stuff at first, either. If you don't like things like that you can skip over it. It took me three months to get the guts to read erotic scenes, but you don't ever have to read them if you don't want to."
Harry felt trapped. He was on his back with his knees bent, feet flat on the bed. He bucked into his own hand as fast as he could but it still wasn't enough. All he could feel was need. His body craved the sweet release that he'd denied himself for so long. He panted and blushed as he felt as if his pleasure had plateaued. He couldn't move any faster, so he tightened his hand a bit and used his thumb to tease his head. There was nothing to help him cope with the powerful feelings inside of him, and he loved that. He knew that soon enough, he would be overcome. He felt a coy smile take over his face as he let out throaty groans that reverberated through his room.
Never in his life had Harry been treated like this during sex and they both noticed the way he twitched inside of Draco. It excited him beyond belief. He looked disgusted with himself, and he should be, but he wasn’t. He felt free.
Draco looked at the noodle on the floor. “You can’t be serious.” He looked back up at Harry in disbelief. “Are you serious?” The corners of his lips threatened to lift, showing how amused he was by the idea of throwing noodles around the kitchen.
Harry quickly pulled his hand back in surprise. “Nope. No more of that.” It was very easy to get him going when Draco got his mouth involved.
Draco only stared a moment, soaking in the fact that Harry was once again, supporting the passion that he kept hidden for so long, and smiled. "No, no bother at all." He started writing again while Harry watched. They both became so absorbed in what they were doing that they didn't know quite when Draco ended up sitting on Harry's lap, two arms around his waist. Harry loved every second of it. Be loved being able to hold Draco.
His mind was frantically racing, going over every tragedy in his life, every doubt, every anxiety, every bit of trauma, all desperately trying to kill the boner which came after a few thoughts of Harry.
He reentered the sitting room and awkwardly spoke to Draco. “I, uh, I have chicken baking. It shouldn’t be ready for another hour so I’m going to run to Honeydukes. Is there anything you want?” He offered.
Neither remembered the paparazzi, nor did they notice the way the room paused to watch them. They were the poster boys of opposite sides of the war, and right when everyone thought they might be friends, they went and did something as big as this. There, for everyone to see, they'd shed their skin, and became nothing more than two souls, intertwined in dance. Something much stronger than friendship, or even a simple crush, radiated off of them both. If they could they would dance forever.
Four hours later he rid himself of everything once belonging to House of Black, besides some furniture and everything that belonged to Sirius. The House of Crabbe lost a boat that they were planning on selling anyways, the House of Rosier lost many books, and the House of Yaxley lost some artwork. The other Houses lost nothing. He was very obviously targeting the more prominent Death Eater families.
“I’m going to lose my mind.” Draco said as he watched them talk and laugh, pressed against each other’s side.
They said their goodbyes and Harry put them away before continuing to eat the food Draco snuck for him.
The blonde turned to his mother and watched her slowly nod, seeming to take in the information. “Well, if it works for them then I don’t see why you would be any different. So long as you’re happy, I suppose it doesn’t matter.” She was trying very hard to adapt to the world as it changed around her. She knew her beliefs weren’t very fair or right, and she wanted to be better, so she was taking baby steps. For that, nobody blamed her. So long as she was trying, everyone in the room supported and encouraged her. Draco gave her a proud smile and she gave a smaller one in return.
Harry chuckled, “I don’t know how the school will feel about the DADA professor and nurse fighting each other.”
They also read an article more focused on Harry and The Cupboard Project. It mentioned that the lawyer sponsoring it had been revealed as Daniel Greenwood, the man who got Lucius Malfoy off in exchange for the names of Death Eaters. Though it gave Harry a mind criticism, it commended Greenwood for his good work. Blaise was very confused, but Draco explained the logic behind it.
Harry’s jaw dropped and he covered himself, his face pink. He searched for words but couldn’t find the language to express himself.
The blonde only grinned and continued writing. "Eat." As much as he enjoyed the attention, he knew Harry didn't have breakfast that morning.
Draco's jaw dropped. He found himself faced with a line that had only ever been spoken to him in his fantasies, but now, a handsome man was on his knees, asking for an adventure. "What?" His voice came out in a whispered shock.
With that, Harry planted one last kiss on his lips before sliding past him and reentering the sitting room.
The blonde sighed and nodded. "Right, do you have any limitations or boundaries? Something you aren't comfortable doing or places you don't want me to touch."
His characters got together, explored their careers, explored their dynamic, grew together, and now he had nothing more to say but he needed something to draw it all to a close. An "and they all lived happily ever after" was absolutely out of the question. Draco refused to just leave the reader hanging with the knowledge that the characters were going to keep living their lives as they had been. Though in terms of happiness, it was a fine ending, something about it still fell flat. It wasn't whole and he couldn't quite figure out how. The characters had each overcome serious obstacles in their careers and were moving forward as a couple, they'd moved in together, he even had them adopt a cat together. It was a perfectly happy ending but it still just wasn't enough. Everything was complete, everything had ended. It was so neatly and nicely packaged but there was something left to be desired. It didn't feel finished and yet it was meant to be.
When Draco saw Harry was working away, he glared, setting the food down. “Working. Really? You’re working when you just got thrown across campus.”
Draco was a bit surprised to find himself lying in Harry’s bed with the sleepy lad. For some reason, it made him smile. He closed his eyes and relished the moment. “I’ll give you ten more minutes.”
She tilted her head and thought a moment. “I suppose your right.” She said before knocking on Shacklebolt's office. “Minister Shacklebolt? I’ve got Harry Potter, as requested.” In her internship, she worked very closely to Shacklebolt, often running errands for him and taking notes in meetings.
Alex looked at Harry with wide eyes, full of interest and excitement. “Of course.” They knew exactly what this was. Harry had an agenda he needed pushed, and therefore, needed an ally in the media. Given that it was Harry Potter, they didn't have any doubts about whether or not the stories would conflict with their morals; they also knew it would boost their career to pump out important news.
Draco was silent, but he started to get a sneaking suspicious that Harry was hard. “Did you enjoy the massage?”
Draco came up behind him and straddled his thighs. “I’m going to start on your shoulders and I’ll go down your back. If I do something or touch something that you don’t like, tell me and I’ll move somewhere else or stop. It’s fine to tell me, I promise.” He wanted to stress that it was okay to tell him to stop.
"I know what might happen, Pansy, but I don't care. If it happens, I'll eventually move on. But for now, getting to know him is worth any feelings that might come about. I'll be fine. You know this."
No one could have guessed how much being a Healer would mean to Draco. It’s the one good thing he’s done. It’s his way of trying to reverse the damage his parents and friends caused. It’s his apology. His atonement. But it’s also become his passion. Saving people, healing injuries, taking care of others, it’s become something he thoroughly enjoys. Having his own scrubs made it official somehow. It was as if having his own uniform made it real, set in stone, permanent. It turned his dream into a reality. He really was a nurse now, it wasn’t just a nickname anymore.
Teddy fell to his knees and covered his own mouth, his eyes squinting as he teared up. He hated seeing his dad in so much pain.
Although Draco and Harry didn’t exactly want to be around each other, they didn’t hate each other, and were both thankful for that.
Harry had never been touched there before. In the few times he’s gotten off, he didn’t really have the time to explore his body. He’d also been under the impression that playing with nipples was just a girl thing. Nevertheless, his back arched and he let out a surprised moan, his eyes flying open. He looked at Draco as a dark blush spread over his cheeks. Had he known it felt this good, he probably would have swallowed his pride and done it earlier.
Harry had a sweet smile spread over his face as he reveled in the ocean of pleasure that he had fallen victim too, finally brought under by the waves that once washed his body. He never knew why but he always gave a demure smile when he was close. Truthfully, Draco thought it to be absolutely charming, a testimony to innocence.
So he did. His hips moved at a steady pace. They filled him with a wonderful friction, lighting up his senses, flooding him with a slow-building pleasure. It felt perfect. He tossed back his head and let out a sigh. He could stay like that for hours. He groaned and arched his back, letting that sweet feeling flood his body. He smiled once again and felt ridiculous. He never smiled during sex, but he was happy, and it felt so lovely. He couldn’t help himself. Though he still wanted more, so badly.
Harry chuckled and followed. “I don’t see why this is a bad thing. I know you didn’t exactly mean to repair divination by telling them Pluto isn’t actually a planet, but it reflects quite good on you. I bet you’ll have their vote when you’re running to be Minister after Shacklebolt.”
Draco's eyes widened as he had a very different realization than what Seamus intended. Harry might be a bit submissive. Not to mention the responsibility of the war, and the house he was responsible for taking care of when he lived with the Dursley’s. Draco, however, had no problem with this. It was more pleasurable for him to ride, and he wouldn't mind seeing the other squirm beneath him. He blinked a few times and said, "I'm not even sure I'll be writing any sex. That's a bit beyond me."
That night, the fall term was officially over, and that morning, a majority of the students left Hogwarts. In the Great Hall, only about thirty students were there for breakfast. Harry was pretty happy at the peace and quiet.
Neville laughed at Harry’s random comment. Mostly because it was true and he never noticed before. Shortly after, he was paired with a boy from Ravenclaw, and left.
Unfortunately for them, Hermione was shameless. “They should have had Harry write it. That way it would of been much more eloquently put.”
“Enjoying what? Playing with your body? The sounds you make? The way your body responds to me? How pathetic and helpless you are? Because the answer is yes, I am.” He grinned down at Harry, leisurely stroking him once again.
Harry blushed darkly and decided to shut the hell up before Draco talked him to a boner. He took off his glasses and set them on the table by his bed.
Draco reached into the fridge and pulled out a bottle of wine. “Why bother?” He popped a brussel sprout into his mouth and poured two glasses. “No point in dirtying two more dishes.”
"Before I go, I want to see Pawk's anti-discriminatory bill pass through but I fear there are a few, uhm. Well. There are some older members of Wizengamot, who had silently sides with Voldemort. I fear they wouldn't like to see it pass and will vote against it. I can't have this happening." There was an heir of seriousness about his final statement that brought Greenwood back to the moment before he realized Harry wasn't angry with him. "I need you to look into the legal histories of a few members of Wizengamot in the Voldemort-era, like you did with Luther. It's alright if there isn't anything to be reported or if it's only something small, I just need something on a few people that would be enough to intimidate them into voting for the bill."
So they did. They stood around like a couple, trying to figure out how to decorate the tree. Harry wanted to buy anything shiny, but Draco had a color scheme in his head that he claimed Harry was ruining, “The sitting room has the feeling of a sunset, therefore, pastel colors would fit best, along with white decorations to mimic the feel of clouds. Stop picking up everything with glitter, glitter doesn’t fit the room’s theme!”
Harry chuckled and looked out onto the horde of dragons in their yard. Atlas, Lupus, and Lyra had all gone and gotten mates, each having the usual clutch of three hatchlings. "They'll only multiply." He commented.
They often talked about returning. Having one last year when they could be normal. Where there was no war or looming threat. Where they could just be normal kids. They loved the idea, but it wasn’t all peaches and cream. They also had anxiety about what it will be like to actually return. All the empty seats, all the missing faces, all the ghosts of the past. Blood was spilled on the campus, in the castle, on the stairs and walls. There were things that happened that no one talks about.
“Merry Christmas.” Draco shrugged, handing Harry a cup. “I didn’t want to wait for you to wake up but you look really cute when you aren’t talking, so I waited.”
“I suppose.” Harry mumbled, quite embarrassed. He wasn’t sure what had come over Draco, but he enjoyed it.
Part of him was furious. He couldn’t believe Lucius wasn't thankful for the fact that he wasn’t stuck in Azkaban and could grow old with his family. He didn’t understand why that wasn’t enough. His father should be thanking Merlin that he isn’t rotting away. But he also knew family didn’t mean much to his father.
Hermione grinned at this. She decided to accompany him for as long as he wanted to stay at the library. She had nothing better to do until dinner, and it was only a little past lunch.
In class, Draco was attentive and very much awake, almost over exaggerated. He didn’t let himself fall asleep or even rest his eyes. After their classes he behaved the same way in dinner. But he was quite anxious for it to be over.
Harry nodded. “Yea. Yea, I’m good.” He said as he looked up, staring at the trees. “How are we meant to get one of these back home?”
So that’s what Luna did. She told him about the research they’ve done in proving the existence of nargles, and that she’s perfected her glasses that allow her to see them. She’s also working on a camera lens that could take a picture of them for definitive proof. It was an incredibly optimistic conversation that left him feeling a bit better.
Draco stroked his back and smirked as he listened to the lovely noises that filled the room. He felt the man shaking in his arms, so close. A small blush settled on his cheeks as he felt Harry twitch inside of him.
Harry let out a soft grunt and found himself shifting his hips under his skin, his body warming up to the electric pleasure that erupted from somewhere new.
Harry took a deep breath. It was over and he was married. He wasn’t sure how he felt. In fact, he didn’t really feel anything other than a misplaced sense of relief from the contract being finished.
Draco pulled out his wand and moved to sit beside Harry. He looked at Harry once more, silently asking for confirmation.
Draco tsked and shook his head, “No, I’m too gorgeous to be on the dirty ground. You’ll realize your mistake and come to my rescue.”
Harry heaved for breath, his body stretching and twisting as it was tangled in conflicting desires. It was all too much and not enough, he didn’t know if he wanted more or to escape. Nevertheless, his hips were thrusting into Draco as quickly as he could, desperate for satisfaction. His muscles trembled beneath the flesh of his quaking form. He looked as wild as his soul, still as ardent and free as ever. His hair spread out and his shadowy stubble made his eyes seem as bright as ever from where they peaked between his dark and heavy eyelashes. Something akin to innocence gleamed there while the rest of him was completely devoured by pleasure. The sight was that of stark and fervid beauty. But the sounds, the sounds were what drove Draco crazy. Harry didn’t just whimper, he keened, he didn’t just moan, he cried, and he didn’t shout or scream, but threw his head back and let out sinful howls. It was the most glorious display of hedonism Draco had ever witnessed. It’s wicked grace overcame Draco. He was trapped by the warmth, silenced and humbled by the sight of Harry giving in to physical bliss.
Draco could hear how close Harry was. He could hear how desperate and excited Harry was for it. He was in control. He could make Harry beg for it, he could make Harry cry for it, but truthfully, he couldn’t. Harry was far too captivating to be tormented like that. All Draco could do was give every piece of himself to Harry’s pleasure.
He bit his lip and watched Harry’s composure crumple under him. He then moved his hand to the band of Harry’s boxers. He raised an eyebrow, asking once more for permission.
He was pulled from the imaginary world and forced to stare down at the plate that he now realized was empty. He glanced up at Harry before going back to his book, but did a quick double-take at what he saw.
In the week before going to Wizengamot for the vote on Pawk's anti-discriminatory bill, Harry received three pieces of good news.
“Honestly, I can’t even tell if I’m joking or not.” Harry confessed with a grin. “Lighten up, I’m just having a bit of fun.” He said with a wink.
He knew that outing their relationship could have dire consequences but he didn't care. All he cared about was Draco. Once he was back by Draco's side, Narcissa was the only one still there. They shot each other friendly looks that were laced with concern. Neither were up for conversation. While he was by Draco's side, nothing mattered. Even the pounding in his head seemed to dull and his eyes didn't droop as much. But when he returned home with the parting promise of making something for he and Narcissa to eat, knowing she had gone just as long as he had, everything was terrible. He worried about Draco and about their outed relationship, his head killed him, his eyes drooped, and he could hardly focus on anything. His mind slowly blanked and he frowned to himself. He'd rather be filled with racing thoughts than have his mind overcome by something worse than sleep. It was a tiredness that didn't effect his body, but only his mind. He absolutely loathed it.
“I’m sad of course. But I think we’ve had enough late nights discussing our feelings about what happened.”
Draco lifted up his hips, offering himself to the boy between his legs. “Harry! Oh, Harry! Yes!” Harry’s name was one of the last words Draco could get out. He was getting closer and closer to the edge. He was a gasping and whining mess, shaking and squirming all because of Harry’s mouth.
He’d been in need of some closure. It wasn’t that he was upset that he died. The only thing that upset him was that he left Remus and Harry behind. He wanted to make sure Bellatrix didn’t get away with what she had done. He wanted her to either be dead or rotting in Azkaban. But by the same token, she was already insane, he wasn’t sure Azkaban would even faze her. Sirius rarely wished death on anyone, but Bellatrix was an exception.
Narcissa thought a moment, “The first of each month, besides the new year, I always go shopping around. See me then around Diagon Alley.”
Draco’s lips parted in shock, “You can’t possibly think he’ll -?” He cut himself off, unable to finish the question.
“Actually, no.” Dean said, surprising himself. He had never explicitly stated his sexuality before, but he figured now was as good a time as any. “I never gave it much thought before, but, I’ve realized I like men.”
“We have all night, take your time.” Harry reassured that he was perfectly fine as he was. He wanted Draco to enjoy it as much as he did. Though he was already trembling and blushing from the way he was taken in.
By the same token, Harry also found the room to be entirely overwhelming. Something about it was just too much. Maybe it was the situation, maybe it was Lucius Malfoy sitting across from him, but he was distressed. He wanted to focus on everything besides the sound of Lucius' voice, the sound it irritated him. But he also wanted to know exactly what was going on. He decided to keep his eyes trained on the contract in Molly's hand, watching things be added and taken away as the debate continued.
He spent the morning worrying to Harry, expressing his concerns and anxieties. Harry succeeded in convincing Draco that he would be alright no matter what happened.
Luna knew Draco enjoyed potions class, so she played off of it to get Draco a little more comfortable. She didn't like when someone felt ostracized or like they didn't belong, she always tried to make everyone feel included, given that she knew exactly how it felt to be the odd one out. She knew she wasn't like everyone else, but she never thought herself to be odd. But she did understand that not everyone was mature enough to treat people who were different with the same respect they would anyone else.
“And you’re a right bastard. Always getting into trouble. Clever and wily, you are.” Dean said back.
Draco raised an eyebrow and pulled Harry even closer, and in response, Harry cracked a smile and set his hand atop Draco's.
After his donation, he found himself outside of a store in muggle Glasgow. It sold more modern casual clothes, the things Harry had always wanted to wear but was never able to. He stepped inside and began to looked around. He very quickly found himself holding a few pairs of dark jeans, made to fit the wearer very well. He knew these clothes weren't something his aunt or wizarding society would ever approve of, but he looked great in them. He got a few t-shirts and button-ups that made him feel confident. For the first time, he was wearing shirts and pants that weren't baggy. Even when picking out his robes and Hogwarts uniform, he never knew what his correct sizes were and was too nervous to try things on over and over, trying to find what fit best. He didn't want to take too long and annoy Hagrid. This was something he now felt a bit silly for worrying about but it also made him sick to his stomach to know he was once that damaged.
He laid in bed and got under Draco’s duvet once more. Despite having ran around for a good three hour, he still found himself tempted by sleep. He pulled Draco close again and smiled at ball of warmth in his arms. His body slowly relaxed.
Harry saw something in Draco's face, but he wasn't sure what it was. He spent a moment taking in the other's face as he tried to figure it out. Truthfully, he always thought the blonde's face to be a bit awkward. His jaw was a bit soft and gave him the profile of a half-moon, his nose ended a bit too far from his lips and the sharpness of it didn't fit quite right with softness of the rest of his face. He noticed how puffy Draco's lips were, how unnaturally round his eyes, and the way his eyebrows were darker than the hair on his head and had no shape other than being bushy lines. He tried not to stare too long and found himself looking away, trying to put his mind to something else.
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he was holding as he was released. The same Auror that brought him in, took him back to his office to be processed once more. After being officially cleared as a suspect, he was told that it would likely be another hour before the truth serum wore off. He took a Floo back to St. Mungo's and found that his head was hurting. A terror ran through him but he quickly noticed it wasn't his scar that hurt, but his head was pounding. Probably from a lack of food, water, and sleep. The stress definitely didn't help either.
Harry only shrugged in response. “He said I could borrow them. I’ve worn them before.” He found nothing strange with him wearing Draco’s clothes.
Harry didn't know it was possible to flirt with eyes alone until the next morning. He had just finished cooking when he turned to see Draco was leaning against the kitchen's entrance, staring at him. He was about to say something, but he was chided by the smile that slowly crept onto Draco's face. It was as if he had slowly taken Harry in and liked what he saw. Harry felt oddly exposed, but not in a bad way. He looked away before his cheeks could flush but turned back when he heard a whine come from Draco's direction. "Yes?"
Harry couldn’t help but to crack a smile. “So, your my boyfriend now?” His voice was wrecked from his orgasm.
Draco wanted to say that he loved Harry’s boldness, but he knew that isn’t what Harry needed to hear. In fact, he knew Harry didn’t need to hear anything at all until he was done talking.
The blonde had his eyes trained on the sight of Harry's open and revealing shirt be pulled down even more. He couldn't deny that the sight of small abs peeking over Harry's shirt delighted him very much. He tried to distract himself before his staring became obvious. "Might as well get it over with now."
He didn’t realize he was letting out strangled cries until a few seconds later when he became aware of his own panting again. His body dropped. He sat back down in the shower and his head hung as he hunched over.
"No. In fact, if you stop I might hex you." He set his book and pen aside, tilting his head back into Harry's hand.
Harry shook his head, “Draco, you don’t have to say that stuff about me. I accepted that I’m not a long time ago.”
The blonde rolled his eyes. “Fine, we’ll look at Muggle lights.” Though he didn’t want to admit it, he didn’t think they looked very good either.
Harry knew he might choke, but he didn’t care. He sucked what was in his mouth as he began to slowly bob his head, though not quite as fast as he was moving his hand.
He landed and awkwardly held his broom, dangling the basket off one arm while he used it to knock on the door. A small and disgruntled-looking house elf answered. "Yes?"
“A dream. You said it yourself, it happened cause you weren’t wanking or stressed. You sure you aren’t gonna wake me up one night, rubbing yourself in your sleep?”
Harry mulled over Draco's words and began eating a biscuit. He made a face and mumbled, "Not enough cinnamon."
Harry’s face went dark red at the comment, much to Draco’s pride. But there was no time to celebrate as the three fingers inside himself were completely comfortable and felt great. He pulled his hand away and cast the spell again. A brief confusion was quickly replaced by surprise on Harry’s face when Draco lifted up and began to stroke him.
But when he remembered how his father so easily tossed him aside to a man he hoped would hurt him, how unbalanced their contract was, he understood. Maybe he wasn’t abused in any sort of long-term. But certainly, that was an act of child abuse. An act Lucius was undeniably guilty of.
“What’s that one?” He asked softly, wanting something to take his mind off the day. He was tired and found himself threatening to space out, but he didn’t want to. He sat down and listened to Draco’s response.
When finished Harry and stepped out, Draco couldn't look away. He had his pajama pants on but not a shirt. Small and soft muscles, dark stubble, adorable glasses, wild hair still dripping onto his body. Ah yes, he forgot Harry was a sexy beast. But he was so innocent too. Harry was a walking paradox and it was killing Draco.
They started off sitting in the couch, eating and drinking, but as one glass of wine became a second, they inevitably ended up in each other’s arms. Draco laid back with Harry’s head resting on his chest, a hand playing with his hair. Harry’s mouth tasted like bitter fruits and dark chocolate, a taste he’s begun to associate with Draco and has fallen equally in love with. He moved to rest his chin on the blonde’s chest and stared up into those questioning grey eyes.
He returned with nothing but pajama pants and his glasses on. He laid down beside Draco with a grin on his face. “It’s almost your birthday.”
Being anything other than heterosexual was fine to most eyes, but he knew his father was disappointed. Sure, there were surrogate mothers, but he'd never be married to a pureblood and have the next Malfoy heir in the way that every Malfoy before him had. He was different. He broke tradition.
Harry looked up at him before seeing something on the bedside table that made his face light up. “Is this your book of pornography?” He lifted himself a bit and reached over to quickly snatch an unlabeled dark blue book. As Draco tried to take it from him he quickly leaned away. He crawled all over the bed as Draco tried to take it, and he did, but not before Harry read a few excerpts.
He wasn't hesitant to say he lived with Draco because he was embarrassed or ashamed, he hesitated because he knew that this would only lead to even more questions, and any answers found would only hurt.
It was insane to think that one day, some of them may have kids. It was insane to think that they’ll leave Hogwarts, live on their own, and work. Most of them never thought they’d live this long. Ron and Hermione didn’t think they’d survive the war. Neither did Seamus. Dean thought he’d die in Malfoy Manor. Luna was never quite certain about when. Draco sometimes wished he had died, but didn’t. Pansy never particularly worried for her life but knew she was in danger. Neville was prepared to die in the war. It wasn’t just hat he thought he wouldn’t survive, he planned on dying if he had to. Harry was absolutely certain he would die. Even before he accepted his fate and walked alone into the forest, he knew he was destined to die. But then he didn’t, none of them did. Now they have futures, homes, they’ll have kids, work, live average lives, and die with their names in the history books as war heroes.
They were given instructions to write their names on pieces of parchment and the parchment was placed inside a jar. McGonagall would call out which two houses to pick from, then the jar would spit out two names.
Their conversation went back to Christmas and Harry told the story of Draco and his Christmas decorating, after Hermione brought up the picture of them that had stirred up so many questions in the papers. People asked if they were good friends or dating. But when the photos of Draco and Seamus at a coffee shop went around, the stories changed to the two either being good friends, in a relationship, or perhaps Draco was cheating on one with the other. Dean, however, was very fast to set the record straight by officially coming out in his relationship with Seamus. He did this by snogging Seamus in front of three reporters and declaring that they can stop accusing Draco of being with Seamus.
His hand started up again, jabbing the fingernails of his left hand into it's own palm as his right was covered by Draco's. His mind lurched into his childhood. "The Dursleys told me I was lucky to have a family. I couldn't ruin what I had." He felt helpless and frustrated. "I knew how to deal with them, I knew how to survive, but what if I left and ended up somewhere worse? It was a risk I couldn't take. I tried to make myself unnoticeable, but every once in a while, a professor would ask, I'd protect them, and then I'd go home, terrified of what they would do to me for being noticed." He let out a weak laugh. "But the day that I left, I said to myself, anywhere is better than here. Strange, how things change."
Harry let out a content sigh and closed his eyes. His back slowly arched again as he couldn’t keep it down with the pleasure rushing through his spine. He one of his hands went up to run his fingers through the hair on the back of Draco’s head. He kept his hand there, resting at the curve of Draco’s skull. He couldn’t see it, but Draco’s eyes nearly rolled back at the feeling of Harry’s fingers in his hair.
He took a bite of crêpes and his eyes widened. He looked over at Harry and found words tumbling out of his own mouth. “How do you feel about marriage?”
Harry sighed, “Yes, I used it to track your movements when you were working for Voldemort. I used it to track everyone.”
Pansy said she’s been looking at flats near the Ministry, and that she’s been talking recently to a boy in Hufflepuff who is interested in the same field as her. Of course this sent Draco into a fit because no man will ever be good enough for Pansy. But eventually, he relented.
There was also an article about Draco. It posed the stance that Draco and Harry genuinely liked each other, and that there was no magic or ulterior motives behind it. It asked if he truly deserves the title of "Blood Traitor", that many Death Eaters had given him. After listing all the things he’s been in the news for; like Harry testifying that he was never a true a Death Eater, his friendship with prominent ex-rebel Seamus Finnigan, and his potential romance with Harry Potter himself; the article determined that Draco likely was a “Blood Traitor”. Even the article itself used quotations around the term, as if to question it’s legitimacy.
“I didn’t know they would scare you like that! It was just suppose to be a joke! I didn’t mean for it to turn out like that!” He began tearing up, desperate for Harry to tell him that it was okay.
Draco never realized how little Harry knew about the wizarding world. It was strangely adorable how clueless Harry was. “Don’t worry, I’ll help. We’ll make this the best first Christmas a baby can have.”
“Don’t thank me yet. I’ll help you, but we’re doing this my way. Draco is my gay best friend and I’m his main bitch. We’re close, extremely close. We’ve told each other things that we would never tell anyone else. And now that I’ve decided that to help you land Draco, I’m gonna tell you some of the things he’s trusted me with. He’s gonna hate me for it, but I don’t care.”
Harry let out a whine and tried to regain himself. “I-I’m not that easy, Malfoy.” It was so difficult for him to sass Draco, looking him in his eyes while he was touched. His muscles tightened and strained as he shifted around, he couldn’t stay still. He was biting back whimpers already.
Ten minutes later and Harry was doing the dishes while Ron leaned against the counter, discussing Hermione’s Ministry internship with him. As far as they were concerned, this was the first step of her becoming the next Minister for Magic.
"Well, we manipulate people. Regularly. We play around with livelihoods like it's nothing. We tend to not care when our actions negatively effect other people." He pointed out. But he was somehow numb to each point. It just didn't mean much to him anymore.
“So, you want to be his friend?” Ron crossed his arms and tilted his head. “I think it would be good for the both of you if you didn’t hate each other, which, I don’t think either of you really do.”
A thousand times he told himself he wouldn't do this, and a thousand times he knew he still would. He leaned against the wall and slowly sunk onto cool tiles. He sat in one of the only bathrooms the Ministry had and took deep breaths, trying to find air where there was none. His breath was ragged and desperate. He was drowning above water, looking towards the lights and feeling no warmth. He rubbed his face until his cheeks were red and he pulled his knees in; distressed and pained.
There was no way in hell Draco believed what Harry was saying. He knew it must involve him but didn't think it was anything bad. They'd had an excellent day and their conversation was going well. So it could only be something good. Good, but uncomfortable. A small smirk slipped onto his face and he nodded, "Alright, then." Draco wouldn't say that his social skills were superior, but they were. He learned very young to pay attention to the things people do and say, because even when they don't intend it, everything means something. Harry's actions and words were very telling. He was flattered, in a way, by the thought of Harry thinking of him in a new manner. He was hopeful that it might mean he has a chance. That chance, however, wasn't meant to be taken today. Not here. He wanted to do it at home where they were both more comfortable. Though he now basked in a confidence that made him feel like he should have made his move, but he didn't.
The blonde felt a soft smile creep onto his own face as he thought through the concept. "You are just Harry, at least to me."
Pawk glanced at the list and shook her head. "Just give me the top four names. This is my bill so I'll do most of it."
Draco has been in a relationship where he gave so much and received nothing in return. At first it felt fulfilling because he was making the one he loved feel happy. But eventually it became draining, heartbreaking, and exhausting.
Draco raised an eyebrow and cracked a smile. Regardless of the situation, he couldn’t let Harry get away with a quip like that. “Did you hit your head this morning? You were never half the potion’s master I was!”
He still had nights where he sat in a corner of his room, knees tucked into his chest, staring at nothing. He had moments where a noise was just too loud and sudden for him to ignore. There were times where things would be too calm and quiet, and he’d sit and wait for things to go wrong. There were days where he was never hungry as if his body still expected not to be fed. He had dreams that felt more like reliving his worst days with the Dursley’s. He hated these dips because he couldn’t understand them. He was suppose to be getting better. He wanted to see progress as a straight line that only went up, but he knew it wasn't that easy.
Draco wasted no time and ended up tackling Harry, who yelped in response. Harry ended up rolling them over and pinning Draco down in an act of panic and self-defense.
He took in a deep breath and shook his head. “I don’t know what the hell I’m doing, unloading all this on you. You’re a child. You’re a child and I’m insane.” He stood up and walked off, digging around in his stuff to find some chocolate. “Remus used to give students chocolate.” He shoved some in his mouth before offering a handful to James.
He was angry, of course he was. He was furious and heartbroken. He hated that the one thing he had always wanted, his parents, were also the one thing he would never have. But after his summer away from it all, spent holed up in the Wealsey's house, he'd worked on himself a bit. He learned to accept things, and let them go. It was much easier said than done, and of course he had his bouts of anger and sadness. But ultimately, he ended up better than how he began.
Sometimes he still wondered if the Harry and Hermione in Hogwarts would have been proud of who they are today. They'd definitely done some things that the two never could have imagined, but the end justified the cost. It was a fair price really. Success for a chunk of morality. He also wondered if Draco from Hogwarts would have smiled to know the things that Harry would end up doing in the name of politics. He probably would have. And the Sorting Hat would have frowned in the regret for not putting Harry in Slytherin. Maybe it could have changed everything if he had been put in Slytherin. He decided that if he could go back, he'd try it out just to see what would change. He didn't regret voicing his preference, though.
The blonde’s jaw dropped and he squinted his eyes. “You’re going to regret this.” He took Harry’s door and ate it.
“Draco!” He gasped out the blonde’s name before his body stilled and his mouth opened in a silent cry. He was motionless and quiet for a few seconds before he descended into a trembling mess. His hips stuttered and his mind was completely overloaded by the feeling of release. A loud moan tore from his throat as he came in his pants.
“Now that we have that taken care of, there is something you must understand.” For the first time, an air of seriousness took over Demgass. “Goblins, especially those younger ones, have pride about themselves and this bank. They take pride in their jobs and in the system they’ve created. I know that after everything that’s happened you would like to build a good relationship with the goblins of Gringotts, yes?”
It was a striking statement, but agreement came from all sides of the group and ideas were thrown around.
Draco gave a faint smile and nodded. He never considered asking for forgiveness for their past, but now that he had it, there was a shift between them. A tension that they were hardly aware of had lifted.
With that, they finally moved on to wedding payments. Given that it was between two men, "dowry" wasn't quite the right term to use, so Lucius insisted both parties give something up. Draco’s was to be the furniture from his room, twenty thousand Galleons, and three house elves.
“Well you’re impeccable at it.” He said before taking a deep breath. “Alright, you’ve driven me out of bed. Move your head so I can get up.”
“I saw what you did in The Quibbler, how you defended Draco. Rumor has it they got every word of your defense down. I’m proud of Draco, he did good.” Andromeda said with a soft smile.
“Merry Cismas Arry, merry Cismas Dayco.” Teddy greeted them when they arrived with three fingers in his mouth, drooling a little bit.
Draco cracked a smile and watch the dragon in Harry's arms begin to reach for him. He hesitated and sighed at the baby. "She always does this. Goes to you so you'll hand her to me."
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh, you really are a bottom. Did you know being pinned down turns you on?”
Harry tilted his head and shrugged, hesitating to answer. “We aren’t not friends. That’s all I can say for sure. We don’t hate each other, but it’s a bit too early to call us friends.”
James was a bit surprised that Harry found it. He didn’t really know what happened with their stuff after they died. He figured Petunia took most of it and sold it. He remembered Lily had lost the necklace after a trip to the bank once, it must of fallen off in the vault. She was quite distraught about having lost it, so he decided to mention to her that Harry found it and wore it daily. She was very pleased by this.
Draco looked up to meet her eye. He never would have thought she would sincerely approve of something so unlike how they were raised. “Really?”
The blonde raised an eyebrow and grinned, finding the thought to be amusing. "Good. If you didn't know how good you looked I would have had to correct that immediately."
“Dammit Draco, I’m halfway through the S’s! Come on just let me finish one more book. If I keep going I could finish the S’s and T’s, they’re absolute monsters to try and tackle. Draco, I just started a series on Sea Creatures, they are not what I expected, deadly little beasts they can be. Dracoooo, let me go! Draco, seriously. If I keep working on it, I can get through the S’s before Christmas, and then I’ll have just enough time to start and finish T! The rest of the letters aren’t even that many books. I could finish this in January, finish my lesson plans by March, and then I can focus completely on my schooling. Draco you slut, let me read!”
Pansy's playfulness faded and she approached Draco, getting in his face and forcing him to look at her. "Draco, you know what's happening, don't you?"
“I don’t remember who’s idea it was to ruin Crow’s reputation but I was the one who dug up and leaked her failed St. Mungo’s reform. The idea was that no one would want to associate with her after the backlash, allowing Hermione and Pawk to emerge as her only friends so that she would use her influence with the older crowd to get votes.” He only gave a shrug, as if it didn’t matter that much. “Then I did the opposite with Luther, and that
Harry rolled his eyes at the name. “Andrews, Merlin. I know him. He’s always kissing arse and trying to gain fame and notoriety without actually having to do anything. This is all just a cheap smear campaign to tear someone else down so it’ll be easier to build himself up.”
Since most of the richest wizard families had been pureblood and supporters of Voldemort, his defeat shook the finances of the rich and well-off.
This. This tiny little family. Herself, her sister, her son, his boyfriend, and her great nephew. This unfamiliar house full of love was more of a home than Malfoy Manor ever was.
Harry was free, wild for the tongue that pushed in as deep as it could. Any shame had left him. He let out every noise that overcame him and moved faster, silently demanding more.
"Oh I wish I had done that. I ended up pouncing on Dean at first chance." Seamus confessed with a laugh. "But he enjoyed himself and I wouldn't change anything."
Harry curiously gave a soft suck and let his tongue explore. He licked up and down the head, swirled his tongue around, all while looking up at Draco with innocent eyes.
A grin spread across the blonde’s face as he finally finished. Rather than getting too sensitive, he couldn’t really feel anything. His senses were shot and he basked in the glow of his orgasm. When he resurfaced from his pleasure he let out a soft chuckle. “Go on, Harry. I can take it.”
He regained his cool and raised an eyebrow. “Well that isn’t very respectful. Might even be grounds for discrimination.”
He sprinted to his dad’s office, not caring if he was seen after hours. He gently knocked on the door, not wanting to scare Harry with a sudden noise.
His eyes widened as he looked around the room. Everything was so clear and sharp, rather than the light blur he was used to. It was suddenly so much easier to see and he didn’t have to squint or stare to take in details. He could finally take in features he never could before. The room was almost overwhelming. “Has that pillow always had dots?” He asked as he picked up a throw pillow that was covered in very small dots. He then looked over at Draco and meant to say something, but instead, he froze. “You have gingerbread crumbs on your lip. I can see them.” He had no idea they were there before.
Luna has been extensively reading the works of Newt Scamander, the most renowned Magizoologist of the time. Mostly due to how close he was to the creatures he studied. He didn’t just observe and take notes, he cared for them and became someone that they trusted. She even managed to get into correspondence with his grandson, Rolf. They were eager to work together once Luna graduates.
Originally, Draco wanted Pansy to turn the conversation into finding out about what Harry likes. Instead, and without telling Draco, she decided she would tell Harry about what Draco likes while discovering what Harry likes.
What made it feel even worse was that he wanted to get out of bed. He wanted to get up, get ready, put on something nice, fix up his hair, and be presentable since Draco could wake up any day now. He wanted to look good for his lover. It was all planned out in his head. Every move and step had been organized so that he knew exactly what he wanted to get done and how he would to it. But he couldn't just do it. He couldn't get out of bed. Not when it was so warm and soft. Even though his limbs suffered numbness and his stomach demanded that he get up, nothing was worth leaving bed. Nothing at all, and he hated it. He wanted to get up so badly but it couldn't happen.
She nodded and continued to carefully detangle Draco's hair with her fingers. "Have you ever considered making your marriage real? Perhaps, with a ceremony or something?"
"I don't think I've heard any of them apologize. Whenever something was wrong, it was my fault. They blamed me for things that I couldn't have done and I knew if I tried to defend myself, it would only make things worse. I remember when my cousin threw a rubber ball and it damaged a neighbor's house. He blamed me and said that he was distracted by the mud on my face, but it was only there because he pushed me down. So my aunt and uncle took his side, called me a pig, and I was made to go over to the neighbor's house and take care for the garden for a month, on top of my regular housework and schoolwork." For the first time, he sounded angry. He finally sounded as if he recognized that this wasn't his fault. But the small outrage didn't last. The more he thought, the more his feelings shifted to sadness, though it was dulled by a numbness that took over his body. "I never talked about myself to them. I didn't even tell them when I was sick because they would say I'm overreacting. I think that's why I never tell you about my work. I'm used to it not mattering. I remember my aunt told me that if I didn't talk about myself so much, I'd have friends. So I try not to. I feel like I'm unloading my problems onto you." A pained expression took over his features. "They never hit me. It feels like because I wasn't physically hurt, maybe I wasn't actually abused. Maybe I've made this up in my head, I don't know. I don't know." He stared down at the floor and he could feel himself starting to zone out in some attempt to escape the conversation.
“Your politeness is starting to become a kink." Draco softly confessed before licking over the hickey and letting his hands roam lower. It was quite alluring to have Harry so often saying please in bed.
Draco looked so smug. Finally sucking Harry off is what got him smug, and he could hardly handle that. He gave a few feeble tugs at Draco’s hand, trying to make him move up the bed to join him.
There were moments where all he could do was sit and remember. His mind would make him convince himself that if he had been more obedient it wouldn’t have been as bad. He knew he shouldn't waste his time because the past can't change, yet across so much time and space, he still wondered what he could do to please them. He hated that.
Harry removed Draco’s underwear, and discarded it on the floor just to be a dick. He could see Draco biting back a complaint.
Draco shifted and his tough expressed fell to show something much softer. “Harry, that’ll always be okay. Boundaries will never disappoint me or hurt my feelings. I honestly feel the same way.”
“Oh, that? That’s Pompeii by Bastille. It’s pretty good but I prefer Wild World or Way Beyond.” Harry said with a shrug.
He found himself much more joyful. Dancing around with the radio on, sitting by the window to feel the warmth of the summer sun, he even wrote a few more love notes for Draco. He was having the time of his life just by being a normal kid, and that was probably the saddest part of it all. Normalcy, which should be the bare minimum, was more than he could have ever hoped for.
“I-I.” Was all Harry could get out. He knew exactly what Draco was talking about, but he had never faced it until now. “Alright then. Let’s acknowledge it.” He moved to sit by Draco. “I’ve got some pretty strong feelings for you. Not only do I fancy you, but I’d probably sleep with you in a heartbeat.”
He thought a moment longer on the way he was treated and frowned. “I was denied affection. I was never shown love. Hell, I never try to hold you because I don’t understand. I was raised without it and now I don’t get it. I don’t understand how to ask for that! It’s just so far beyond me!” Harry stared down at his lap. He meant to delve into his childhood and tell stories, but things fall apart. "It sucks because I want to hold you all the time."
“I’d rather have him. I get what you’re saying. But, what if we break up and don’t speak to each other anymore? I’d rather have him in my life in any way that I can than risk messing it all up and losing him.”
In that moment, Draco swore his heart stopped. Harry had never said that to him before. He didn't think that the other felt as strongly as he did, but there it was, I love you. He sat there and stared in disbelief before he finally recognized the worry in those green eyes. "I love you too." Came tumbling out of his mouth in a way that wasn't as graceful as he should have hoped and almost sounded panicked. In a passing self-awareness he seemed to regain himself and he went about correcting it, "I love you too." Was much calmer and softer. It was gentler and so loving. "Why now? Not that I'm complaining."
He felt so free. It was as if he had suddenly realized that the weight of the world no longer rested on his shoulders. All his dreams of one day being independent were really coming true. It wasn’t just some fantasy in his head, he was making it a reality.
He watched the way Draco moved on him. The way his back arched, his head tilted back. He looked so pale and soft, he was even tantalized by the blonde hair that lead down to the length that dripped onto Harry’s stomach. He saw the soft smile on his lover’s face and his heart swelled. It was so loving and happy. It was because of him.
He pulled his clothes off until he was only in his jeans. He grabbed his pajamas and a towel, heading into the bathroom.
Ron let out a laugh. “Of course! We never stop, we come in waves. Don’t let the calm fool you. Soon enough this place will be overrun by redheaded monsters.”
“No. I’m afraid I’m all burnt out. I sent what I have to Seamus and he seems to like it so far. I just can’t write, or even read. Not right now. That’s all I’ve done for days and I’m so incredibly bored by it.” He said with a soft whine. He hated how what he loved had become a source of frustration and stress.
Those wide green eyes seemed so innocent in such a moment. "Is this flirting?" He didn't even know why he asked such a thing. It came out before he could control his tongue.
Not even a threat from Charlie could stop Draco's curiosity. “Those things you said. About all the laws you broke, and how you don’t feel any remorse. Is that true?”
Two years after the birth of Scorpius, and just before Luna and Rolf had their second son, a boy was born in the cold of December.
“Do you truly believe the end justifies the means? If I killed twelve people to prevent them from robbing a bank, am I really a hero for saving the bank? If I ruin the livelihoods of countless people, in order to pass a bill or save some orphans, am I actually a good person? I suppose you’ll never know. But I do. I know for certain.” Voldemort seemed to shrug, as if he no longer cared. “But it isn’t as if you could ask anyone else. Hermione followed you and now she’ll suffer the same fate, and Pawk doesn’t know how deep you’ve gone. You couldn’t tell her. Then she’ll fear you too. Enough people are already afraid of you, Potter. Too afraid to tell others about your tricks. Fear or ignorance. You can’t tell anyone what you’ve done. Especially not the Malfoy boy. Once he finds out, he’ll know the kind of person you really are.”
As appealing as that sounded, Harry did not want Draco seeing him when he came. He had no idea what kind of face he would make. He’d never felt this good before and knew the face he made was probably gonna be different than before. He didn’t want his lover to see him look ridiculous.
“Ah, mm.” Harry felt pathetic as he was incapable of formulating a response. Warmth flooded into his pants and he shifted a bit, unable to find any relief.
“Wonderful style, really. It makes your legs look so long, and your jacket fits your shape perfectly.”
They made it back and Harry seemed a bit nervous. He made his way over to his trunk and pulled out the blank map.
He got up from the sofa in the sitting room and went to pour himself a glass of wine. That was what he desperately needed. He idly stood around the kitchen as he finished half the glass. Even if drinking didn't clear up an ending for him, he hoped to have something to take his mind off of it. Not to say it caused him any stress but he'd rather not think about a problem when he has no solution.
Harry looked away and crossed his arms. “Shut up about my eyes, Draco. It’s embarrassing. I just want to shower.”
“I really should've seen this coming. I’ve never been around babies so much, but I figured the hair pulling part couldn’t be so true. Guess I was wrong. You want my glasses huh?”
”But, they were hurting her. I had to help her.” Harry saw absolutely nothing wrong with what he did and he would do it again. They both knew this.
Alex blinked a few times and grew a wicked grin. "My, Potter, you naughty boy. So much more clever than those arseholes in Wizengamot." They gave Harry a once over before standing to leave. "Disregard my earlier statements and remember my door is always open." They offered before taking their leave.
"No, it's alright. Not everyone likes biting." He wanted to make sure Harry knew that he hadn't done anything wrong.
Draco had to throw all his weight to get Harry on his back, but once he did, it was easy to keep him down. One leg was propped beside Draco's body, foot firmly planted on the couch, while his other foot rested on the ground. Draco's body laid between the spread legs and it gave him a phenomenal view of the tent between them. His hands kept Harry's shoulders down since he didn't feel comfortable pinning his wrists just yet. He wanted Harry to have the chance of using his arms if he wanted. Once he had Harry laying back, he moved back to sit. "If you're comfortable with this, I would quite like to rub up against you until we both ruin our pants."
“I get it. I really do. I’m not angry or upset. I understand your intentions. I’m just ..... I’m still shaky.” He said as he nibbled on some more of the sweet. “I love you, James.”
He slipped a finger in and was met with no resistance until he made it to his second knuckle. “Take a deep breath for me.”
But beyond Draco's warmth, Harry could feel the blonde's collarbone under his hand, the expensive fabric of his robes, and most of all, the soft and steady hand that held his. It was all so strong and steady. He's never been so attracted to someone before. Never in his life has Harry wanted to bite another human before, but he had to feel the shoulder that he rested his hand on, between his teeth.
After dinner, Draco entered their dorm to find Harry on Draco’s bed, in his jumper, with his hair a bit messier than normal, listening to the radio. He obviously did it all on purpose and Draco loved it.
Seamus' mouth opened to say something, but no words came out. The corners of his smile faltered and he seemed caught in the implication of Draco's answer. "Oh. May I ask who?"
“Why not?” There wasn’t a hint of curiosity in his voice. He knew the game he was playing and intended to win.
Harry couldn't leave the conversation on a claim like that. He was too interested. He asked what she meant, and was taken down a rabbit hole. She observed how the people of Wizengamot generally felt about changes, who was excited, hesitant, neutral. She paid attention to the elite and understood how they functioned and cooperated. She understood their beliefs and ideology. She understood them, because the moment she got the idea for the bill, she knew she'd have to beat them.
Draco wailed out, giving in to the desire that burned inside of him. He fucked Harry as fast as he could as he listened to his own noises jump in pitch and become frantic. A wild smirk spread across his face and his torso twisted as he felt that he was only moments from the edge. “Oh! Harry! Fuck, you’re so perfect! I love you! So beautiful!”
Harry only shrugged, “I don’t think we do either. I just hope maybe we can find some way to get a divorce. Lucius took every legal reason for divorce or separation and made them all invalid in the contract. Really, the only out is Azkaban.”
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. “You’re fucking evil.” His face slowly moved forward to press into Draco’s shoulder. He completely relented to the thing that made him feel good.
“Let me help you.” Harry said, rushing to her side. He took the other end and lifted it up with a small and nervous smile. When he realized they were the only ones in the room, he spoke in a soft voice. “I really am sorry about this. I know that this isn’t what anyone wanted, besides Lucius. But, I would like to be friends with Draco, at least. I want to get along with him.”
“Of course you didn’t. I never told anyone. They would hurt me if I did.” Harry paused a moment before continuing, “You know I never really feared Voldemort. I was never afraid of him because there was nothing he could do to me that would ever hold a candle to what happened in that house. He couldn’t hurt me like they could, that was my only comfort.”
For as cold as it was, the birds still sang and the sun’s rays still felt warm. He smiled to himself and leaned his head back onto the tree he sat against, just breathing. For as in-control and confident he was in his work, it was nice to be able to slow down and relax.
Teddy didn’t know who Harry was. All he knew was that there was a brand-new person at his home, and this new person is playing with him. So he figured Harry couldn’t be half bad. He decided he liked Harry, but if Harry tried to keep his glasses away for much longer, that opinion might change. He wasn’t sure yet. He wasn’t sure about a lot of things. But he knew that he loved that woman that holds and sings to him. That’s about all he was sure of. He also doesn’t like peas, he knows that for certain.
He made it up to his dorm and flopped on his bed. Seeing Teddy made his day. It filled him with a strange hope for the future. Like everything would be alright.
"I can't believe you flew all the way here. What is that, half an hour? And you brought biscuits." He sighed and closed the door behind Harry, circling around to lead him to the table. "You act as if you're the one who did something wrong."
They were a pair of earrings that Andromeda once loved very dearly, but had to pawn away at one point when times got tough. They had been given to her by her late husband for their fifth anniversary.
The blonde let out a soft laugh and helped with breakfast. They ate together, got dressed, and took turns in the Floo, one to Paris and one to London.
Of course, they let him sit. In reality, the booth could fit maybe eight people, but it was only ever the three of them.
"Electricity." Pansy mumbled the word, realizing it sounded familiar. "I remember Granger wrote a paper on electricity in muggle studies, I'll have to ask her about that."
“I can’t believe I was judging him on that.” He blinked a few times and shook his head. “I didn’t even consider.....” He trailed off, knowing he didn’t need to finish his sentence.
To create, alter, or nullify a law, Wizengamot must come to some kind of agreement between at least two-thirds of the members. To do this, debates would be held before time to vote. The older members, who were closer to Voldemort and of higher status, were as stubborn as ever. Even newer members of higher status stood with the older members, working to refuse any change that Shacklebolt or young rebels pushed for. At every debate, each side’s argument was jumbled and filled with repetition due to people scrambling to feed off each other. They'd all argue in circles for hours each week and the impartial members felt intimidated to not pick a side. No progress was the same as a win for the stubborn members.
Draco couldn't help but to grin. The fact that his surname still meant something filled him with pride. Specifically, the fact that it meant something other than evil. He wanted to take the Malfoy name and change it's reputation to one of riches and elegance. He wanted to erase it's association with Voldemort and turn the House of Malfoy into a lavish and opulent one. Draco wasn't a gold-digger per se, but he was a businessman. He planned to replenish the wealth that was lost with the way the war ended due to his father's affiliations.
Harry was serious, “I had never seen hair so blonde and light before. I thought it was beautiful.” He figured he might as well be honest since he had dug himself into a hole.
With that, they got dressed and ready for the day. Unfortunately that meant Harry had to sit through Draco’s little morning routine of getting his hair just right and moisturizing.
Everyone was excited. The son of a professor, a war hero, stepping up to take his place as the next big Gryffindor on campus. That’s how it always was with the Potter boys.
Harry used one forearm to hold himself up as his other hand went back to stroking Draco. A shaky cry fell as he pressed his lips to the ones under him. What they did could hardly be called a kiss. It was desperate, trembling, aching for contact. Between the few soft kisses they could manage, they stayed close and called to each other.
McGonagall only raised an eyebrow, holding back a laugh since she found it obvious that the Howler had been from him. “I’m old Harry, but I’m not blind. I can see what’s in front of me.”
He headed back home, nearly speed-walking, to avoid any attention. Especially from journalists. When he arrived home he found another letter waiting for him and two more Daily Prophets, each covering updates in the case against Louis Luther.
In a perfect world, Harry would be able to tell Andromeda about the map, and she could use it as a way to relay messages to her daughter. But the world isn’t perfect.
Draco shook his head. “No. He does the laundry and shopping on Sundays, cooks breakfast and dinner, keeps the house clean, works, and every time he goes out to do the shopping he'll always ask me if I want anything. I don't have to do anything at all.” He blinked a few times as if he was shocked by it all over again. “It really isn't what I expected. I expected for him to either hate me or ignore me, but he really does try to be nice. We don't talk very much, but when we do it's civil. We even eat dinner together and sometimes I'll help him cook. I offered once, and he taught me how to make spaghetti. Did you know that you can tell if the noodles are done by flicking them on the wall? If they stick, it's ready.”
He froze and cringed, surprised and embarrassed by his own actions. He hoped McGonagall would remember his father used to do it and forgive him.
His dress pants were undone and pulled off, finding a home in the floor as he was left only in his small, red cotton underwear that fit him better than he’d like to admit.
“Hmmm?” Draco hummed, making his tongue vibrate inside of Harry. Though the other couldn’t see it, he was extremely smug.
Neville smirked knowingly at Harry. “It’s only gonna get worse now that the war’s over. They’ll get closer and closer, but I’ll bet anything that they won’t get together without a push.”
"It was well. We accidentally planned out a bit of a potential book." He said before taking another sip. "I'm still on the fence about writing but I'm heavily considering it. Some reporters got a few pictures of us when we left. I wonder what stories they'll spin out of it." As his mind drifted, his disinterest changed to a small smirk. "I'm hoping at least one thinks we're dating." He couldn't resist the appeal of just a bit of mischief.
Many raised concerns that were genuine, some pushed to have the department dispelled, and others spoke just to have their name on the department's history. While many were legitimate, some were obviously more concerned with notoriety and image.
Draco slowly nodded as he looked around. “It's bright, but a soft sort of bright, pastel. It still has darker and deeper colors about it.” He picked up a throw pillow as he spoke. It was a dark purple, all the throw pillows were, and it complemented the sherbet orange of the sofa and the pastel sky walls quite well. The dark and the light weren't clashing, the deep and the pastel weren't at war, but they played off of each other and worked together to give the room a calm atmosphere. “I quite like how it's decorated. It's peaceful here.” He held the pillow in his lap, still looking off.
It was then that Draco realized Harry was nothing like the lawyer character in his mind, but instead, he was the photographer. Or maybe, he was both. Two different sides of Harry, personified as the characters in his love story. He felt like a fool, but wouldn't change a thing. "Yea, I'm fine. I just never put so much thought into a word before."
Draco held the familiar bag and he blinked a few times in surprise. He looked up at Harry and uttered a small and hesitant thanks. But he looked more confused than anything. Although they had addressed Draco’s feelings of not deserving Harry’s kindness, this was something different. “Why?”
When the fire was roaring, Harry grabbed a present that was wrapped fairly-well and handed it to Draco.
“You wanted me ten times in one week. How many times did I approach you this week? Two. Two times. You’re insatiable Harry.”
Seamus always relaxed because Dean was practically a radiator, giving off ridiculous amounts of heat and warming Seamus from the inside out. He loved being held by Dean. Something about it made his heart flutter and swell at the same time.
Draco looked up from his book and looked Harry dead in his eyes. “Yet.” He confirmed. His face was filled with his old arrogance. The look had usually been given when they would insult each other before Quidditch matches. But for the first time, Harry was excited to see it.
McGonagall gave a speech, congratulated everyone on their progress, and wished the graduating students luck in their futures. But there was one moments the students were especially excited about. The awarding of house points and the cup.
Harry thought a moment, but for some reason his mind always went back to Draco. The most attractive person he knew, Draco. The person he always wants to be around, Draco. Someone he wouldn’t mind waking up to every day, Draco. Someone he trusts with all his secrets, Draco.
As with any big newspaper, everything is political. Articles about hero animals are political, as is an article about orphans, or natural disasters, even advice columns. So, an article revealing the love between the poster boys for two different sides of a war, incredibly political. This is why Alex refused to let their editor publish the final draft before getting Harry and Draco's approval. Knowing how important it was, they wanted it to be up to the couple's standards.
“A what?” Harry had no idea what the term meant, but he assumed it was something sexual by the way Draco smirked.
“It’s just that you two look so similar, I couldn’t help but to wonder. They’ve been writing some very impressive stories.” He casually threw out, wondering if a familial appeal might work on her.
Harry gave a shrug, "Well, not all the sex will yield children. Dragons are gay, sometimes. About twenty percent, which helps population control since dragons live for centuries."
There was a moment of silence as Draco understood what Harry was saying. “Harry, you don’t have to be in control all the time. The world rested on your shoulders for long enough. Relax, give in.”
Ron scoffed, about to say something snarky until another question came forth. “How do you know your ring size?”
Harry thought a moment, “I realized I was bisexual, I don’t know, when I was a kid I guess. Girls are cute, guys are cute, it’s just whatever. As for Remus, I didn’t care. He’s only a werewolf, not like it’s that big a deal. Still just Remus.”
Draco wasn't stupid. He knew how politics worked. Though he did give some credit to the fact that most people wouldn't say no to Harry Potter and that Wizengamot is largely newbies, he knew that getting support would take a lot more than that. He was also aware that Harry had a streak of breaking and bending rules. Something told him there was more to it, but he didn't want to push Harry to share. Instead, he only nodded. "That's nice of you."
The secretary greeted him with a smile and he gave her a nod as he entered, seeing Greenwood looking over a few files on his desk. "Potter, good to see you again. Take a lunch in your Wizengamot uniform?"
Draco bolted up from the sofa and into the kitchen, where Harry had been making breakfast. "I've done it! Harry, I finished!"
Draco bit his lip and his eyes widened some. He immediately started writing his next letter to Harry, suddenly full of inspiration.
It was hard and it hurt like hell, but after the summer had come and gone, things weren’t as bad as before. The people of that home showed their open wounds to each other.
Harry came to only seconds later. He looked up at Draco with a dark blush. “I-I suppose I’m not a virgin anymore.”
Harry began to pull his clothes off as he spoke, “Fine then. But you had no problem tying me down last time.”
Just like his father, Teddy loved chocolate. So the cake was just that. A chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. He was very exciting.
Upon returning, their bags were placed on the sofa and Draco immediately took charge of the decorating. "Alright, these two bags have everything for the tree, go ahead and place it so I can get the skirt around it." He said as he dug around for the deep red fabric.
They would occasionally pull a few, but nothing too big. Strangely, McGonagall was thankful that they weren’t as bad the Weasley twins, definitely not half as bad as the Marauders.
“There are people and couples out there who want children but can’t produce one, so surrogacy has a small market. Only two or three girls at a time work as surrogates. We aren’t as uptight as you think. It also pays well, they make about sixty thousand Galleons.”
When she gave them the keys, Harry smiled and thanked her. But he wanted to do so much more. He was ecstatic that he could see Teddy anytime, but more than that he felt a sense of purpose. He felt like he had been handed they keys to Teddy's life, he felt like by having these keys he could be there for Teddy. He felt like they were a family.
“You’ve been dating him two weeks and you’re already giving him hickeys?” Pansy teased. “Wow, Draco. Ever the gentleman.”
After presenting a list of each of their assets, Lucius tried his hardest to minimize Draco's personal property and get as much as he could under Harry's control. He was actively trying to make their marriage unequal. He wanted to give Harry the tools to ruin Draco's life with hopes that Harry still harbored anger and hate from their time at Hogwarts. He even tried to get Draco's personal vault as part of their communal property, but Molly was adamant in keeping it solely under Draco's name. In the end, it ended up being one of the only things he still owned. With the threat of calling off the marriage and selling Draco off, there wasn't a lot Molly could do.
“Right. I’ve drawn up a standard marital contract. Before you are copies of it. Please read it over and see if it is to your liking.”
While Harry took a day to spend time with Dean and Seamus, hanging out and catching up, Draco spent his time with Pansy.
While he was off, Harry decided to spend the day with Hermione. They wandered through Hogsmeade and sat down for drinks at The Three Broomsticks. Their conversation started off light enough, catching up, talking about Hermione and Ron's relationship, discussing their future Ministry plans, they even spoke about Louis Luther, the man Harry had Alex write about. Not only was Harry’s declaration of support very effective in swaying public opinion, but the opposition succumbed to rumor and found themselves behind Luther, who was no doubt a terrible leader.
He’d been there two hours before he heard word on his clearing. Given that it was a little past nine in the morning, Wizengamot was already being called so they could get it over with. He was escorted to the entrance and could hear people complaining that their time was being wasted on someone who very clearly wasn’t the culprit. But he also heard older voices chiming in that it might be him since he hates Draco so much and has probably been using him as a political ploy or under a love potion.
Draco smirked and wiggled a bit, sinking down all the way. The stretch wasn’t painful, and though he wouldn’t confess it, he did enjoy it.
“I was thinking maybe we should just make-out in front of them when they come back. Or perhaps if you show up covered in enough hickeys, they’ll get the picture.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. He sighed and grabbed some food. “I want to tell you. I really do. But it’s going to sound insane.”
They spent the rest of their day together, in a warm and pastel haze of complements and giggles. They were in a bubble full of love and nothing outside of their little bubble mattered. It was a perfect day.
Draco was quick to obey. His own gasps for breath turning to moans as he heard the gentle slap of his skin against Harry’s. He had also become aware of a sickening wet noise coming from between them. He loved it. He looked down and watched the golden boy keen for his dick. It was a sight he never thought he’d see, but he was thankful that he did. He groaned and let a hand drift around to gently rub Harry’s tip again. He was desperate to make Harry feel good, the lovely body under him was entirely overwhelming, it was enchanting, rapturous, the trembling form under him owned his body and soul. He craved to Harry, laboring for the warmth that called him forward, caught in a wretched devotion for the man in his arms.
“No problem. But be warned, Neville’s awkward when he talks about his emotions so prepare for the most uncomfortable confession possible.”
He left off in his mother’s fourth year. That’s when she and Snape began to drift apart, it’s also when she befriended Remus. She wrote a lot about him, saying he’s definitely a werewolf, even though hasn’t told her. She’s also started writing more about James. Apparently he adored McGonagall, but he took it to the next level. He would refer to her as, “Minnie, my love” and “the light of my life”. He also tried to ask McGonagall to the Yule Ball and then Sirius nearly fought him because apparently he also wanted to ask her.
Harry nervously sent the approved article back and they knew that within the next few hours, the paper would be mass produced and sent out.
“Of course. This is what you’re used to and I don’t mind it. I’d like for Christmas to feel familiar.”
“Well eat up. Pomfrey gave me permission to use magic to speed up healing in your rib so you won’t have too much trouble when we release you. Merlin knows I'll have to bear the brunt of your complaining.”
When they got back to Hogwarts, Harry started to manually wrap the presents, and Draco laughed, “You know there’s a spell for that.”
Harry and Draco found themselves always having conversations like this. Always teasing and joking. They got along as if they had known each other for years. There was, of course, the occasional breakdown. But they stood by each other’s sides.
Many stories had spread about Harry being abused as a child due to his outburst in Wizengamot. The stories were so popular that they were even mentioned in newspapers. But Harry never corrected them, and Harry had a history of calling out the papers if they were wrong, so it was slowly accepted as fact.
His entire life was created before him. Be friends with these people, dislike those people, kill Harry Potter, marry one of these girls, have an heir, then die rich.
He pushed his feelings aside and helped Harry to a bed, putting his annoyed façade back on. “I can’t believe you were actually stupid enough to go messing around with that tree!” Draco grumbled, “I swear I’m gonna break your other arm for pulling a stunt like that.”
Harry rolled his eyes and they made it to the library, carefully breaking in to the restricted section.
"You don't have to publish, you could write it just for fun. But if you did want to publish, you could go under a pseudonym." He suggested as he tossed the chopped vegetables into the saucepan.
Harry was taken aback. Was Draco seriously threatening him? “Oh, and why wouldn’t these spells books be in Hogwarts?”
Everyone noticed, but no one as much as Draco. Draco stared at his boyfriend in amazement because he could tell that Harry truly didn’t care.
"I never should've let you borrow it." He said as he looked down at a dragon that was nuzzling his leg. He picked the newborn up and held her like a child.
Remus and Harry agreed that letting Teddy grow up with the map would help normalize it for him, rather than throwing it on him later and risk it becoming an emotional burden.
Draco smiled at this and then turned to face Harry, looking him up and down. “You look like a mess.”
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and all but pulled him onto the dance floor. He whirled around and set a hand on Harry's waist, putting their arms in the appropriate position for the dance.
Draco lopped the conversation back around to their original topic. “So if the furthest you’ve gone is kissing, how do you know you aren’t a bottom, then?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “The Captain’s Affair, Call of The Sea, Yuletide, Dark Scales and Slitted Eyes, and what is that one called?” He pointed to the book currently in Draco’s lap, the one about the Auror and potions master.
Harry found himself going to see Teddy every weekend now. It got to the point where he and Draco were given keys to Andromeda‘s house.
Harry sped his hand up, wanting Draco to feel even better than he did. He wanted to make up for any discomfort and he wanted Draco to have more since it was his birthday. He watched the boy bouncing on his lap, his lips parted and his eyes closed from the pleasure. He cringed a bit at the horrible wet noise that ensued. He found it more embarrassing than anything.
Harry rolled his eyes and put his towel away. He laid down on his own bed and Draco turned to look at him with a huff.
Draco didn’t know what to do or say. He was honored that Harry wanted to share, he was regretful that he ever tried following his dad’s footsteps, but most of all he felt like he finally understood just how broken Harry was. Or at least, he was beginning to understand.
Harry groaned and shifted under Draco’s hand. “Must you do that?” He whined, only more bothered by his inability to find friction. He could no longer take, now, he could only receive what Draco was willing to give. He tried to slip his boner under Draco’s hand, but he couldn’t move.
“I know I don’t have to. I don’t have to do anything. But I want to and I do what I want. Stop before I break your other arm.” Draco looked at Harry a moment as if seriously analyzing him. “You have a real problem with others doing things for you. You can stop now.”
Molly gave a nod and somehow, she trusted him and Draco completely. It wasn’t something she could see Draco doing, especially not Harry. So she trusted Harry’s take on the situation. “Well, if he wants to participate in Secret Santa I’d love to have him. It also might be fun to have him over on New Years, if he wanted to come.” She said with a shrug, though the tone of her voice made it clear that she wanted him to come over, almost excited by it. Now that the war was over, she really only saw Draco as the boyfriend that Harry never brought around, and as a mother, she had to get to know him better.
"Harry, this is obviously about the bill that Pawk woman is trying to pass. They slandered it and now she's retaliating." She shook her head. "No, no it wasn't her at all. She isn't deep enough on the inside to have found out about this. Someone else did it for her. Nevertheless, this could prove to be trouble. The last person to use the media to push an agenda was Voldemort. This could encourage some to use the media as a form of attack. Someone could go after The Cupboard Project."
Harry felt like a complete fucking idiot. He pulled out the map, desperate for help. “I’m a dumbass and I need your help. I fucked up. I completely fucked up. I fucked up in ways that I didn’t even know I could fuck up.”
Once Harry was coated in lube, Draco positioned himself over the hard cock under him. “Are you ready?”
Harry was a bit surprised at Draco’s analysis. He was mostly surprised at how Draco knew so much about flowers.
He left and quickly made his way back home to see Harry was chopping some fruit for lunch. He scurried into the kitchen and held up his bag of books with a grin. Never before has Draco had the urge to share his books with someone else, but here he was, excited to tell Harry all about a matter he once considered personal and secretive.
Draco could see that Harry was conflicted with something, so he sat by the Floo and turned to the other. "What's wrong?"
Harry’s eyes drifted from them to Dean and Seamus. Seamus was practically on Dean’s lap. They were sitting as close as they could even though the couch could fit three or four. It was painful to see them act like a couple, to know they’re in love with each other, but still refuse to confess their feelings.
Demgass gave a curt nod. “Since I dealt with you so successfully last time, I’ll likely be assigned to handle all your affairs at Gringotts.”
Draco leaned to Harry after he finished explaining a potion to Luna. “Oh, are Seamus and Dean a couple?”
The rest of their day went on like that. Cheap jokes and witty banter. It was lazy and happy. It took Draco’s mind off his mother and the potential danger she could be in. He needed a distraction and Harry knew that, so that’s what he focused on, keeping Draco distracted. Besides meals with their friends, they spent the weekend hanging out and had a Sunday afternoon visit to see Teddy. That’s how they were most weekends, joined at the hip.
“Alright. I like it when he dresses up really nice. Like in his blazer and dark pants. Or even when he wears a long coat and a scarf. Something about it is just really attractive.”
“No. We were asleep before midnight, I don’t know how we slept this late.” He didn’t even catch on to what Hermione was implying.
They were each riding a high on life. But as it does, life has a way of keeping people grounded. Draco’s grounding came in the form of his father.
Draco's gaze turned serious and he gave a nod before stepping into the Floo with Harry, giving their home and throwing down the powder. With a flash, they were back home and Draco was terrified. He's been nervous, hesitant, scared, but Draco has never been so terrified in Harry's presence. Not even when Harry nearly killed him. That day, all he felt was as if he deserved it. But now, he was utterly terrified. Was he being rejected? He didn't want to get hurt. In all his daydreams he never actually thought about what would happen if Harry rejected his advances. He only ever pictured Harry falling for him and them being together. He had no idea what he was meant to do if all this time, Harry didn't actually want him. Draco bit his lip and looked Harry right in those green eyes that he found himself thinking to be so pretty.
“You aren’t! You nearly died, so many times. But here you are, still standing. You’re the bravest, most stubborn, piece of shit I ever met! Come on, then. Let’s go.” Draco wrapped an arm around Harry and turned to see his kids. He gave them a small smile, “Go on to class, your dad will be okay. I’ll take care of him.”
Neville let out a laugh, “I’m happy to see you too, Harry.” He said with a smile, hugging his friend. “Hey, do you mind if I sit with you guys? A lot of people didn’t return this year and I’d rather sit with you lot.”
“The Captain’s Affair.” Harry recalled with a giggle. “The one about the pirate and the nobleman.” Another laugh fell from his lips and he shook his head. “Apologies, I’m not laughing at you. It’s just a bit cheesy.”
His tongue pulled back so only the tip was in, fluttering a bit and no longer flexed to a point. It was pressed against Harry’s walls and didn’t try to compact itself to fit. He slid it in and the slightly bigger form made the groans above him come louder than before. Draco was momentarily thankful that they didn’t have neighbors.
Draco’s jaw dropped and his cheeks flushed. “No. Nope. I’m not having this conversation. Let’s just sleep before we end up staying awake all night.”
“Know that all those feelings are entirely mutual. But if you’re so eager to be with me, then what was all that with John? Enjoying his attention, letting him flirt with you right in front of me!”
“Draco.” Harry whined. He could feel the way his cheeks parted due to the position. He almost felt like he was flashing Draco, it was obscene and embarrassing.
He was met with a moment of silence before Draco spoke up again. “I take it you’ve made your decision, then.”
The tip of his second finger pressed against his own opening, slowly slipping in as Draco teased himself with only his fingertips. Only a moment of that and he took two fingers to his second knuckle. He was already panting and arching his back at the familiar stretch. He leaned forward a bit to let Harry get a better view of himself.
The blonde was a bit bewildered and tilted his head as the other sipped a cup of coffee. "You genuinely believe I'd be any good?"
Draco let out a soft chuckle. “I’m just kidding, I know you meant the front. I just wanted to mess with you a bit.” He motioned to Harry’s bed, figuring the boy would be more comfortable there. “Lay there on your back. I need to find something.”
Harry looked up from his charms homework and nodded, “I meant every word of it. I mean what I write and I write what I mean.”
Harry rolled his eyes and cracked a smile through silent chuckles. “Uhm. I know I said that I wanted to wait for a relationship, but you make that incredibly difficult. I know I should wait, just a bit longer. But falling into your arms feels so easy.”
He held Teddy and talked to him for a bit. Harry couldn’t help but to smile at how cute it was. As annoying as he is, Draco had his moments.
He took some more notes on the creature and then put the book down. He began looking through all that he had written, realizing that he only had three pages filled and he’s already making a dent in the restricted section. Then again, much of the restricted section was more about evil people and manifestos. The amount of books on dark arts, magic, and creatures weren't very plenty.
Draco was honestly a bit surprised at the invitation. He didn’t realize their nights together mattered so much to Harry. “How about I bring a chair in here and sleep there?”
"Yes, for two weeks now. We'll sit out here for hours and talk. We haven't spoken too much about our pasts, but we know each other's stories. I know more about him than most people do. Hell, I'd put myself on par with Ron Weasley and he was
Draco was careful in not bringing up a house elf. He knew how Harry felt and didn’t see it necessary to get one, so he left it alone.
He didn’t know why he was so anxious and doubtful, but he was. He was worried that he wouldn’t have any part in Teddy’s life. Perhaps he was worried Teddy would turn out like him, alone and yearning for love. Worried that Teddy would grow up miserable and unhappy like he did. But he had to remember that Teddy isn’t like him, and Andromeda isn’t like the Dursley’s.
At breakfast, Draco felt anxious. He wondered if it was something he had done that caused the change in Harry. He wondered if Harry changed his opinion on Draco and saw him as a monster now.
“N-No, I didn’t mean to say you look bad.” Ron was quick to correct himself. It was hard to explain what he saw when he knew he and Harry weren’t raised the same way. He was used to more conservative clothing, but here Harry was with something very different. He wasn’t sure how to explain himself and he felt like an ass for having tried.
Draco pulled back and saw Harry with his head to the side, lips parted, eyes closed, eyebrows furrowed, back arched, and thighs pressed together. He looked completely debauched. “If I had known that was enough to shut you up, school would have been much more interesting.”
Draco gently shook with a silent laughter, “It’s alright Harry, it’s perfectly normal during a massage. Few can keep quiet under my hands anyways.” He said proudly. He was pleased that he got some noises out of Harry, but he wasn’t sure why he was proud.
for not wearing a shirt to bed.” Draco commented as his eyes were finally able to take in all of Harry. Although somewhat muscular, he lacked definition. He was a bit scrawny with his muscles making themselves softly known, gently rolling above the rest of his flesh. But he was also a bit thicker than when they went to school in Hogwarts, which Draco happily attributed to Harry’s better mental state and his improved eating habits. He was also very delighted to see the bit of dark hair on Harry’s chest and the line from his navel to the hem of his pants. Although he thought Harry was absolutely gorgeous, he couldn’t help but to notice all the scars that littered the man’s body. They made him a bit sad because he knew that although some were from Quidditch, many were from the times he had to fight for his life. He also knew that a few of them were his fault.
When he entered Honeydukes, he immediately wandered over to a familiar little corner that sold chocolate. He grabbed everything that looked mildly appealing and was about to check out, when his eyes drifted over to a candy he found somewhat familiar. He raised an eyebrow and thought a moment before realizing it was the candy Draco would always get during trips to Hogsmeade back in Hogwarts. He picked up the small white baggie with golden letters to see that it was caramel. All that time, Draco had been eating caramel. It wasn’t as if Harry had ever wondered what the candy was, but he was somehow pleased to know. He kept the bag even though Draco said he didn’t want anything. He was going to check out, but some familiar giggles caught his attention.
Everything was going according to Draco and Pansy’s plan. But of course, Pansy had a plan of her own as well. She would help Harry just as Draco wanted her to, but she also wanted to teach Harry how to flirt with and charm Draco in return. The poor virgin was in over his head with a whore like Draco, so she wanted to level the playing field a bit.
“I’ve been thinking about coming all summer. But there were some things I needed to get over first.”
Harry’s experiment with dark magic gave him a lot to think about. Was he a bad person for being tempted to try? He figured he wasn’t as long as he didn’t do it again. But he also questioned the memories that were brought up in order to incite his hate. They were few and vague. According to the texts he read, most people are hit with many specifics memories in order to get them to feel hatred. So many memories have to be used that the witch or wizard often experiences some form of temporary memory loss or migraine afterwards. But Harry only went through a few vague memories and that was all it took.
The Head Warlock thought it was the perfect push to get Draco locked away in Azkaban. Call in his arch-nemesis, Harry Potter, to speak about him.
Harry hollowed his cheeks so he could suck Draco’s cock a bit harder, he took a bit more into his mouth, he let his tongue roam around the new skin, and he let out soft hums as he did it.
Harry was very familiar with the fact that the abused will sometimes grow up and be abusers, it’s a cycle. But Harry plans to break it.
“Oh, oops.” He honestly didn't think what he had written was that romantic or moving, he thought it was just a small collection of thoughts and observations from looking at Draco. His hair in the right light had white highlights that resembled moonbeams, his eyes light up when he's happy, when he's in sunlight his hair becomes a golden halo, and he has an aura of elegance about him, he's very graceful when he moves. Harry had taken these few observations, worded them in fancy language, and wrote it down.
Harry was a bit shocked to see that all his friends seemed excited by the idea of he and Draco finally being together. He knew he shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was used to things not being so easy. Hermione was elated that their marriage might lead day be real, Seamus revealed that Draco had once mentioned his feelings and he’d been rooting for them ever since, Dean was congratulatory, and all Ron said was, “Shite, now you might really be married before I am.”
Harry glanced at the time and rolled his eyes, flopping back down on the bed. “It’s six in the morning.”
Narcissa gave the house elves some Floo powder and sent them on their way. The Weasley’s and Harry went back into the sitting room so Draco could have some time with his mother and Pansy.
Draco's eyes widened and his lips parted in shock. He didn't think Harry would be this confident, but given that it was their first time together he decided he wouldn't fight for control. He would let Harry have his fun.
He raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Sounds quite annoying. I can’t imagine why someone would want to bother you.”
Trading secrets for secrets. Pansy was going to make Harry squirm for the information he wanted. It was then that he finally realized what Pansy’s plan was.
“Oh fuck.” The small noise slipped out as his back lifted into a little arch from the building pleasure between his legs. It wasn’t as relaxing as it once was, it was heavy. It was the foundation on which he would build his peak. His body stretched and twisted, lifting his shirt and exposing himself even more under the duvet. He bucked his hips at the feeling it gave him and decided not to think too much on how much he enjoyed it, rather, he let the shivers and gasps run through him. His hand was slightly damp from all that leaked out of him, coaxed by sordid joy.
Draco, meanwhile, was very excitedly browsing a little shelf of books. He saw there were only four he didn’t own and was disappointed at the lack of variety. Still, he was thankful for what he had.
“There’s a bit of research I need to do about our newfound money-making method. Problem is, the book I need is in the restricted section.” She didn't even state her proper request as she knew Harry would already know what to do.
Harry chuckled as he entered their dorm. “That’s insane. I mean, I get it. I really do. I always thought he was kind of cute.”
“That way we can always, uhm.” He realized he didn’t have a non-romantic way to explaining it, so he went with his first instinct. “We can always be together.”
Part of him was impressed that she used the financial department as a scapegoat, but it was also her greatest mistake. Never offend the wrong person, or they'll root for your downfall. Given how eager they were to gossip about her, Harry was almost positive that this bit of news wasn't such a secret within the Ministry, but if it ever got out, that would certainly be a shame for Crow.
Their time away from the table was meant to be brief. It was only suppose to last a few minutes tops. But things tended not to work out in their favor. For starts, Harry ended up bombarded by a small group of three women and a man, all complementing how wonderful he looked and asking about his strange clothes.
“Oh? What about?” He quickly asked as he followed Harry from their room, where he had been writing, to the sofa.
“Please, tell her I love her.” His lower lip trembled. He never thought he would have a chance to give a message to his mother. “Tell her that I’m okay. Tell her about me, tell her all about me. I want her to know who I am. I want her ....” he trailed off as his eyes teared up. “I want her to be proud of me. I want her to know that she didn’t die for nothing. I want her to know that everything is okay.”
“This’ll just make me fall asleep.” He said as he shifted around under the blanket, trying to discreetly snuggle into it.
“I do. I always will.” He mumbled, using his thumb to stroke Draco’s arm as he held the man. “Merry Christmas.”
The next day was somehow even harder. Everyone had their belongings packed up. They would be taking the Hogwarts Express back to Kings Cross Station.
Harry, on the other hand, barely escaped the morning with his virginity intact. He wanted to do so many things with the man who laid next to him. But he didn’t. He held back. Instead, he woke up with a boner that he took care of in the shower. He thought he had gotten away with it, but at breakfast, Draco commented, “It’s a shame you took care of yourself in the shower when I was right next to you.”
The blonde couldn't help but to let out a small chuckle. "It's really okay. Take all the time you need. And thank you for deciding to wait. I can tell how important this is to you and I'm honestly flattered."
They sat down in the sitting room, discussing the few presents they'd yet to buy. Hermione shook her head at the long list of Weasleys they had to get something for and she commented, "We really ought to get them into doing Secret Santa, so we each only have to worry about one person and we could focus on getting them something meaningful."
“I suppose. I didn’t actually read it.” Harry had never heard the term ‘enemies to lovers’, but it’s definition seemed obvious, and when considering the summary, it was likely.
So sorry for the late update, I've had a lot going on and I just finished my first week in my new semester at uni, so things are a bit chaotic.
As he stepped inside he was hit with a wave of warmth. His smile widened and he set his bag down, taking in the sight of the house he hasn’t seen in so long. It was still decorated for spring as that’s when his family typically visited. It looked as gorgeous as ever in winter.
Harry didn’t like surprise, especially involving his work, therefore, he didn’t want to surprise anyone in their job. He fired off a quick letter to Pawk, telling her about what he had done with Greenwood so she would be prepared in case Harry did end up threatening or intimidating anyone into voting for her bill. Though he doubted he would need to, he wanted her to know that it was a possibility so she could plan accordingly. Surprises in politics were never a good thing, even when one has the best of intentions.
Harry gave a shy smile, both of their hearts swelled by the gesture. But neither of them said anything about it.
Draco gave a soft smile. He found it a bit charming how Harry put Draco’s comfort before his own. “It’s alright, no need to apologize. I was the one looking, but it is hard to miss.” He winked.
Harry’s only response was to hold Draco closer, letting his face fall to rest on the other’s head, taking in the scent of expensive shampoo. “You didn’t choose this.” He reminded, still believing with the faith of a devotee, naïve as it might be. In a perfect world, Draco was blameless, but they both knew it wasn’t completely true. Still, they also knew that Draco did his best, and for Harry that was more than enough.
