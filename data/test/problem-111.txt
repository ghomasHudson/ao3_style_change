“That was brilliant Malfoy,” Potter said almost as dumbstruck as all the Dursley’s had been, eyes wide, hand still resting on his shoulder making the heat extend throughout his chest, and the prickle begin to perk up.
“I dream about the Tri-Wizard tournament, and watching Cedric die, and being tortured by him, when I’m not dreaming of Sirius, or being tortured by visions of his thoughts, I dream of that,” Harry finishes with a long exhale, as if he’d been holding his breath their entire conversation up until his own confession. Their eyes met again; gray and green and Harry knew something had shifted between the two of them, could feel it, and it made him bold.
“No one, I think that’s what he was upset about honestly. Harry thought you might have more insight on how I might approach him, I mean now that he knows?”
“Draco,” it came out as a strained, whispered moan that had Draco’s eyes rolling back into his fucking head.
Draco felt himself flush again both from her words, and from the memory of the argument he’d overheard that morning between Harry and Weasley.
Draco shifted on his back and craned his neck back up to look up as dusk began to adorn the sky with soft hues of pink, but a suggestion of rain added in hues of dark blue. He shifted his thoughts back to Potter’s birthday, next week, of course he knew he was going to agonize over it. He could only imagine the kind of birthday’s Potter had endured growing up here, in this hell hole of a place. He wanted to at the very least get Potter something special, something that would maybe solidify their friendship, something that would maybe solidify the other boy’s trust in him. Afterall, after Potter’s birthday they’d only have one more month, four weeks, thirty days, until they returned to Hogwarts, but Draco didn’t want to think about that yet.
Fred and George let out even louder bouts of laughter than before at Ron’s disgruntled comment, filling the alleyway with snarky comments and giggles as they headed out in search for the rest of the Weasley clan.
Harry groaned and swallowed him down, relishing in how Draco tasted, coaxing him through his orgasm with his tongue.
Draco stood there for a moment, hands at his sides, almost frozen as he gazed down at the other boy. Finally, he felt his limbs hand control back over to him, and he slowly raised his hands over to Potter’s face, finger tips only slightly brushing over the boy’s skin as he gently pulled the glasses from his face. Draco felt himself let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding in as he placed the glasses on the table nearest Potter’s bed. Draco gave Potter one last glance, before almost reluctantly heading back over to his own bed.
Draco internally cringes at his crass tone and wills himself to have more tact. Potter cringes a little too, but like the golden boy he is recovers easily, “Yes, of course but Hermione might be more keen on recommending books useful to studying for exams, and I quite like your idea of escaping off into a book that might take me somewhere else for a while, yeah?”
“Harry, I…” Draco opened and shut his mouth several times before he felt the words begin to fully form and make any sort of sense.
*****
Draco groaned, “if you start with that, we’ll never make it out of here and Mrs. Weasley is sure to burst in at any moment and curse me for ruining you and your sweet innocence.”
That was all it took for him.
“Voldemort.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He leaned back, smile on his face. “Remember, the first time you went down on me?”
He let himself relish in the way Harry pressed himself into all the lines, creases, and angles of his body, folding himself to fit the two of them together in a way that left nothing to the imagination. Draco sighed as Harry breathed him in, burying his own face into Draco’s neck and grabbing ahold of the shirt at his back as if Draco might disaparate and Harry’s only wish was to keep him put.
Draco immediately began shaking his head, “No, I know Snape - that would only anger him. Give me some time to try and speak with him directly before we go to the headmaster.”
Draco’s gaze never left Harry; the other boy was like a magnet pulling Draco’s attention towards him always. The second their eyes met Draco melted, he couldn’t believe he’d managed to go this long with his heart as heavy as it was. It didn’t even matter to him in that moment that he’d confessed his love without a confession in return. He knew his face was giving him away, he had grown terrible at lifting his mask in the presence of Potter, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to anyways. Harry made him feel safe to be himself, like it was okay to feel things.
Harry tried to let out a laugh, but it came out as more of a groan. Instead, he let himself be led out of the shop.
Draco let out a deep sigh and ran his hand grungily over his face, and then down along his chest to rest on his abdomen; he could feel the effects of the bond starting to set in as a dull ache spread through him. Of course, the feeling was not foreign to him, but he hadn’t felt it in so long, Draco had become much more antiquated with the pleasurable buzz that seemed to hum over his skin wherever his body met with Harry’s.
“I don’t want to go,” Draco whispered into the crook of Harry’s shoulder, his favorite place truly. Not that Harry minded, let him stay there honestly.
“I really appreciated the conversation we had, I can see why Harry is so fond…and thank you. You know, for the other thing. It feels nice that it’s out in the open even if I wasn’t the one to say it. Sort of like a burden has been lifted, thank you.”
Without notice, he took Draco’s cock down his throat sucking earnestly. Earning him many hushed sighs and chaste groans as Draco dug his fingers even further into Harry’s hair. Harry knew that he was doing his best to stay still, and he grew more fond at the thought.
That was the last wicked thought he had to himself before he slid his hand over the blonde’s thigh to pull his attention over to him. Doing his very best to make his intentions clear with his eyes. He watched as the blonde glanced at him from the corner of his eye, a signature half-smile in place. Draco dropped his hand down to cover the hand that Harry’d been steadily inching up his thigh and continued to give the film his full attention.
I love all the comments, and I love you all so much! <3
“Honestly Ronald, your communication style consists of grunts and one-word answers so you’re not one to talk.”
Draco felt his heart begin to race. He hadn’t fully thought about this either, he hadn’t wanted to let himself think about this, and this was a reality. Eventually he would be forced to choose between Harry and his parents, and he knew all too well that this is what Harry was really referring too.
“You okay,” Draco spoke softly into the space of their kitchen, fingers kneading into his shoulders.
It never really dawned on Draco to try and speak to the other boy. Conversation wasn’t really something Draco was partaking in recently. Partly due to the fact that most of the other students chose to ignore his presence and partly due to his decision to stay more still, more discreet. However, Potter took their game of gazing at one another to the next level one afternoon as they both exited charms class at the same time. Weasley and Granger glanced back at Potter an unspoken ‘you coming?’ written on both of their faces. Potter apparently well versed in both their languages said something wordlessly back that was enough to satisfy them, and they headed on their way, leaving boy wonder alone with him.
"Everything is merely speculation, at this point," Davies responded slowly. "But we think...that the dark magic that we couldn't get rid of—the magic that we said we found in both their bodies in the same spot...There may be a chance that that magic was the result of a curse that was placed on them...A curse that may be inflicting damage on both of their bodies."
“Fine. ‘Potter can’t get within a
“Why on earth would there be a Hippogriff here? They’re endangered species so all of them should be in Ministry monitored sanctuaries.” Harry mumbled with a frown. “Unless...”
Blackwell strode to Harry's bedside, resting his fingers on the still-unconscious boy's neck to check his pulse. He nodded, then went to Draco's bed and repeated the same action. Both healers monitored the appearance of their patients carefully as they waited for a sign of either boy starting to stir.
Kingsley glanced down at the piece of parchment in front of him for formality. It wasn’t like he really needed to remember the two names he was going to be calling—but he did so just to keep with the tradition.
The girl now however seemed much older and more mature—her hair cut short into a sleek bob, accented with a single stripe of purple tucked behind her ear. She finally opened her mouth after staring at Harry for a few moments.
“Nervous boys?” He whispered brightly as he stopped between them. Neither answered, and that spoke loud enough to Florence. “Don’t worry, everything’ll be just splendid.”
A sudden branch breaking stopped Draco’s line of thought, and he froze—pulling his wand out instinctively.
“Indirectly, yes,” Theo confirmed with a nod. “I work behind the scenes most times, but I do come in to operating room to assist with sedations and the like...as well as administering potions to some younger children in Blaise’s ward...”
Again, thankfully Blaise’s eyes had taken to wandering around the room, so this exchange went unnoticed. “You don’t sound too enthused about it.....Did your roommate make you move the furniture?”
“Draco. Are you feeling alright?”
“Oh stop being such a drama queen, Malfoy. Going out to lunch with friends is nowhere near death on the danger scale.”
good, just
“How about you just introduce yourself...tell us how long you’ve know either Harry or myself for...what your current occupation is..?” Draco offered with a dismissive wave of his hand.
"Nnm...no...no!..." Draco jerked a few more times and whimpered—still unconscious.
Harry steeled himself again, but Blaise simply chuckled wryly. “I didn’t know that one for sure...but it’s what I guessed.” He turned and shot a slightly annoyed look to Draco. “I kept waiting for you to bring it up yourself, but you never did. So that’s why I’ve been trying to initiate it myself, but even then.....”
The elder wizard shuddered at the memory of how unsettled and panicked Draco had sounded. The way that the boy’s voice trembled and his sentences broke as he gasped for air—Florence closed his eyes painfully and shook his head.
“Wow, that actually sounds...fascinating.” Hermione marveled with a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes.
Harry looked down at the offending item in his hands then up at his lover with a frown. "What's wrong with it? I like this one."
“—You should really let me buy you a drink sometime~ I’d love to get to know you on a more...
Harry shared a small smile with her at recalling their first encounter—while certainly not the best, it had definitely been impressionable.
“I had come to bring you the paperwork you asked for Minister, but I didn’t realize you were busy...” Draco’s voice, though it had carried a slight teasing tone moments ago, now sounded oddly polite and subdued. Harry frowned. It wasn’t the tone of voice that he was used to hearing from the blonde.
Harry opened and closed his mouth, but no words would leave it.
“It’s pretty interesting most days,” Theo agreed with a nod. “One of our projects that we’ve recently been working on is a new version of Skel-a-grow. One that will be able to restore bones in as little as an hour.”
Harry suppressed a chuckle and patted to the spot next to him. “Sit down and just try to relax, love. You’re gonna wear a hole in the floor with all of your pacing..”
“Alright then—hurry back!” Blaise sing-songed over his shoulder—just catching sight of the boxer-clad blonde making his way up the staircase with perhaps a bit more force in his steps than necessary.
Blaise raised his hands in defense and gave a chuckle. “Seriously though, what if he comes on to you?” The Slytherin suddenly stopped and stared at Draco intently. “......Or has he already....?”
everything will turn out just fine...probably...”
“Thinking,” Draco snapped back shortly, turning his face up to the sky.
Once he reached a point where he could kiss no lower, he sunk down to the carpet—spreading Harry's legs apart and nestling securely between them—his body burning with lust.
“Uh, sorry...?” Draco mumbled out with a slightly frown.
"So, Uh.....Where should I start...." Harry began nervously, flitting his eyes back and forth between his two longtime friends.
—" Harry continued with a slight cough once Ron had stopped choking and no longer looked like he was going spill his guts on the floor.
"How...do you know about Chinese take out food?" Hermione asked hesitantly, looking over the food in front of her curiously.
." He passed a beautiful emerald green jumper over to Harry with a smirk—who took it somewhat doubtfully.
“The...
“Ah, well...it’s best to be on the safe side....,” Blaise relented with a sigh, searching around for something. “Where’s the control stick for the Telly?”
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but snapped shut it with a pout—deciding that he was probably just going to dig himself into a deeper hole.
"What Blackwell is trying to say," Davies cut in, "is that now based on the report that we have, we can guess with almost certainty that Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy were most likely hit with the same spell. Likely, one of the wizards they were up against hit them together with the same curse—which means that however that curse affects one of them, it'll affect the other one just the same."
A quill appeared, hovering over the paper. Harry took it and glanced down to where Kingsley pointed, taking a deep breath and signing his name.
“Ugh, enough...’m going crazy.....,” He whimpered—sitting back and grinding his hips down against his lover’s impatiently.
Draco huffed and scowled at the raven haired male as he threaded their fingers together calmly.
“Ah, Hey you guys...” He greeted awkwardly, walking up to the pair and running his fingers through his not-as-unkempt-as-usual hair (thanks to some intervention and hair products on his lover’s behalf).
The crisp sound of a bell filled the cafe, and as the party looked toward the sound, the oak door of the cafe suddenly swung open wide as two figures walked in.
“You prat...” Harry shot back in annoyance, turning away from his lover with a cross of his arms.
....h-h-he's not actually...." For nearly the first time in her life, Hermione was speechless—stammering as she glanced wide eyed at the blob platinum blonde hair still nestled in the space between Harry's legs with a glimmer of horrifying recognition. Ron turned his gaze as well and looked like he was about to be sick.
Draco scowled and pursed his lips in annoyance. “So I guess that means that you know we’re dating too?”
Harry cringed at the similar phrasing to the words that he had been replaying in his head. “As much as I’d like to believe you...”
There, marred against the deathly pale skin of Draco's torso, was a wound, exactly like the one on Harry's. Knightly gaped at the wound in realized horror, darting to check the appearance of Harry's wound, then coming back to check Draco's.
Davies wasted no time getting the potion into Draco's mouth as Kingsley tried to restrain the boy's arms. In a matter of seconds, the room quieted as both boys slowly went still.
“You’re allowed to put whatever you want,” Kingsley replied with a shrug. “Within reason of course.”
Draco reached the top of the staircase with a fit of huffs—immediately turning into his and his lover’s bedroom.
“As of now we don’t know where the snatchers’ route is, so part of your job today is to scope out this area and the ones adjacent to see if there are any signs of the snatchers, or evidence that they’ve been here,” Florence explained. “If you see the snatchers, do NOT engage. Send a Patronus message to the Auror office and we’ll meet you, got it?”
Kingsley cracked a small grin as Harry suddenly bolted up and brushed his clothes furiously, glancing around wildly.
"How about you start with the part where you're gay?" The Slytherin commented in amusement—grey eyes dancing with mischief as they usually did when he was teasing his lover.
Draco sighed and reached forward to take a sip of his coffee before drumming his fingers on the table thoughtfully. “Well, let’s see then—what did happen next? I suppose that after we finished our meeting with Kingsley...we each went our separate ways for the night—then we met up again at the Ministry the next morning. The ceremony was to take place in one of the hearing rooms in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement—with only a few people to serve as witnesses...”
“It seems everything is in order now,” He cleared his throat and gazed over at the crowd of Aurors. “With the power invested in me, as Minister for Magic—and with the signed contracts of both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy—it is my pleasure to now officially announce to you the newest members of the Department of Aurors! Auror Potter, and Auror Malfoy.”
“We should definitely test out the shagability of the couch in this position,” He stated with serious nod, earning an eye roll from the male underneath him.
“Malfoy, that’s...”
The older male nodded and stroked his chin thoughtfully. “I understand, but trust me—you’re doing extremely well for how short of a time you’ve been on the job for...Most rookie Aurors are sent to St. Mungo’s on their first day...”
“You first assignment is as follows. You have been tasked to a reconnaissance mission, trying to track a group of snatchers who have been suspected of illegally transporting foreign substances—including magical creatures.” Florence rolled up the piece of parchment and stared at the two boys with an uncharacteristically serious mien. “Though this is only a recon mission, it is very important that you two stay on constant alert.”
“Alright, I have some coffee here for you guys~ ” He stopped in front of the table with a smile. “So who do these go to~?”
"Well unless you fancy sleeping by yourself on the couch for the next month, I suggest you straighten your attitude out and just comply,
"Is he waking up?" Davies asked with a frown.
Blackwell turned to Kingsley in slight surprise. Obviously he hadn't realized that they had additional company in the room. "Ah, how rude. My apologies, minister. It's an honor." The stoic faced healer extended a hand politely and shook hands with Kingsley.
“By that time it’ll be too late!” Harry hissed angrily. “By the time we send message to the other Aurors and get some back up here, the snatchers will already be gone and the Hippogriff with them!”
“Children...?” Hermione questioned with a frown.
,” The Italian replied with a scoff. “It would be troublesome if such a dominant person like that were to take advantage of poor Dray-Dray.”
Draco glanced up quickly. “You mean they haven’t yet? Where is he?”
Hermione hesitated for a moment to see if Harry would bail her out, then opened her mouth with a nod. “Y-yes...Ronald and I are currently working in the Bureau of Intermagical Wizarding Law.”
,” Harry warned.
"You should thank me for taking time out of my busy schedule to come grace you wankers with my presence." He continued arrogantly—relishing in how purple Ron's face was turning, and how Hermione could do no more than gape at him—no words leaving her mouth.
Harry scowled ever so slightly and took a sip from the coffee cup in front of him. “There are...
The blonde ignored his lover’s concerned look and reached backwards to grope at his butt—looking down at Harry with a horrified expression as he did.
“You.....just vanished.....my favorite......white.....designer...jeans......?” The blonde turned wide eyes on his lover below, and Harry knew he’d just screwed himself.
“Sticks and stones, love.”
“Sir,” Harry interrupted Draco’s dumbstruck train of thought. “You can’t possibly be suggesting that we go out on our own for our first mission together tomorrow already? I mean we haven’t even trained together!”
raise hell...."
." Harry supplied tiredly, getting up off of the couch and looking around for his wand.
After he was safe behind the confines of a locked door, Draco perched on the counter and whipped out his phone.
"So what are you saying?" Knightly questioned with a frown.
Draco frowned deeply and opened his mouth to speak. However, Davies caught sight of the motion and immediately shushed him. "All in due time, Mr. Malfoy. Anyways, as I was saying—we had immediately started treating Mr. Potter's injuries because we were afraid of how much blood we were losing. His vital signs were also dropping quickly, so we knew that we had to seal up his wounds. Once we began working though, we realized that the wounds had been caused by dark magic—something that, while not impossible to heal, is extremely difficult."
Draco obediently followed the command, wand at the ready as his grey eyes scanned the bushes rapidly.
"Minister, may I suggest that you conduct an investigation as to what's been going on here? Clearly this man isn't sane!"
meter radius of me.’”
"Of course not. Mr. Malfoy's wounds were mostly internal." Blackwell shook his head in confusion.
" Kingsley asked. "You mean then—"
Davies snapped. "Nurse, please bring me all of the surgery notes for both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, as well as the results of the dark magic screening that we did on both of them.
"Hate to break it to you Granger, but it really is me." The unmistakably cool and confident voice of Draco Malfoy quipped back—his lips curling into one of absolute delight as he finally turned around and faced his lover's two friends—though he stayed sitting on the floor between Harry's legs for emphasis.
After a few more moments of relative silence watching the show, Draco finally steeled himself and opened his mouth. “So....you wanted to meet my roommate, right?”
“Mmmmm.....
Draco finally turned away from Blaise at the sound of his lover’s embarrassed voice.
“Ah...Granger is fine...” Hermione muttered back embarrassedly.
Kingsley sighed deeply. He wasn’t expecting to be showered with good news, but he was still trying to remain optimistic. Harry still being in surgery after the three or more hours they had been in the ward was not looking positive.
“You weren’t hit with any spells, Draco?” Kingsley asked.
Hermione and Ron’s eyes both widened at the Slytherin’s unabashed displays of affection.
"Hermione? Hey, 'Mione..." He lightly shook the brunette next to him, who slowly opened her eyes with a frown.
“And? What does he think?”
Before either Kingsley or Knightly could question him further, the doors to the ward came flying open with a gust of wind. The nurse who had left only moments ago now scampered behind a new face as they both strode quickly into the room.
"A pleasure." Kingsley nodded. "I'm only sorry it couldn't have been under better circumstances."
Draco’s pale cheeks dusted over with crimson at the remark, and he hastily withdrew his arm with an embarrassed frown. Harry likewise retreated his arm quickly as he glanced up at Kingsley with a mixed expression. “So...that’s it now? We’re really...stuck like this together now...?” His voice sounded equal parts dread and uncertainty.
“So what’s the occasion? You weren’t very specific in your owl,” Hermione asked cheerfully.
“About...my new Auror partner...?”
He glanced up at Kingsley hesitantly, who looked deep in thought.
“You sure keep it together in front of the important people, but now that we’re alone your mask sure has fallen, Malfoy.”,” Harry goaded, strangely happy to see Draco exhibiting characteristics that he was actually familiar with from school.
Blackwell opened his mouth, then hesitated. "Why don't...we only apply it to one of them for now?"
He glanced down at the wand in his hand a gave a small self-deprecating snicker. You'd think that a seasoned 22 year old wizard, vanquisher of Voldemort and savior of the Wizarding World would be able to perform a simple 1st Year Charm spell non-verbally—but, after trying and failing miserably before to do so an occasion before (resulting in marinara sauce being flung all around the kitchen, and a less than thrilled Draco banning him from trying the spell non-verbally again) he'd kept to his promise and had so far refrained from testing it out again.
say...,” Harry mutter petulantly in return, rolling his eyes slightly at his lover’s childish refute.
The voice that came from the blonde wasn't the usually snarky, cool, confident Draco that he was used to. Instead he sounded so scared, so worried, so....vulnerable.
"Ah, yes." Davies coughed slightly and glanced down at his stack of parchment. "I mean to say that most of the wounds that Mr. Potter received have been healed and are no longer a cause for concern."
“You heard him, Mr. Potter. I’m afraid that I don’t have the time to entertain children anymore,
Harry stirred in his bed slightly, emitting a groan as his eyelids fluttered open. Kingsley and Knightly were at his bedside in an instant—peering over the young man with concern.
Blaise clicked his tongue and flitted his eyes towards the staircase. “Is he home?”
"Something like
, like you would really kick me out of our bed." He waved a dismissive hand at the obvious bluff and continued, his voice now losing anger and gaining it's usual haughtiness.
“Now we just need to make a formal announcement at work....”
Draco opened his mouth to respond, but Harry cut him off before he had the chance. “Ron, honestly it’s fine. Between what Draco told me, and what the other witnesses recounted to me after I came to—I pretty much deduced what had happened and it all seemed in line with the story that Draco had recalled.”
"But what if they change your mind.....?" Draco whispered, tracing a pattern into the fog of the window pane with his finger as he stared out it—not daring to meet the dark haired male's piercing stare.
"Well, not entirely..." Blackwell supplied hesitantly.
The jumper fit him like a glove and was spectacularly soft and warm. He had to admit—his lover did have excellent taste when it came to clothing.
“How come you get to be so calm and collected about all of this...” He muttered petulantly.
He tried to swallow the lump in his throat and maintain his dignity as Kingsley opened his mouth to deliver the words Harry knew would end his short lived career as an Auror.
"To make a long story short—once I started working at the Ministry, around the same time that you guys started, Malfoy and I were almost immediately assigned to work together as partners on Auror cases. At first we were both against the idea, but.....well, things happened....and we decided to date." He finished somewhat awkwardly, finding no point in actually going into all of the details.
“You can let go of each other’s arms now,” Kingsley chuckled lowly as he turned back to Harry and Draco happily. “You two did well— I’m proud of you!”
Knightly trained a wary expression on the healer, but complied when Kingsley tugged on his robes. The two backed a safe distance away until they were once again beside Draco's bed. Together, the three watched as the nurses prepped Harry—leaning his bed back and pulling the sheets down until the wound was fully visible and easily accessible.
well being," Draco drawled.
is it, mate?” Ron questioned confusedly, staring his friend down with a suspicious expression. “Not that I particularly care about the entire story of how you and Malfoy...hooked up—but! This is the first time I’ve seen you try to be so secretive about something!”
Draco nodded slowly, still trying to process what happened. “But why was I sent into surgery? I don’t think anything happened to me....” He glanced down at himself, turning his arms and examining for any signs of injury.
“Ah, Ron and Hermione are here...You two stay here...” Harry hissed quietly, standing up and smoothing his shirt down nervously as he made his way back to the front door to greet his friends.
Harry chuckled a bit and rolled his eyes. “Yes, yes, I won’t. But as I stated earlier—I wasn’t conscious for most of this part of the story, so there wouldn’t be much for me to give way anyways.”
there is to know about complex spells and such...” She trailed off seriously before continuing, and Harry saw Draco open his mouth with a gleeful smirk.
Harry entered their bedroom and went straight to their enormous walk-in closet. Living with a Malfoy demanded closet space—and if it weren't for the undetectable extension charm that he had placed upon the closet after moving in, he had no doubt that Draco's clothes would take up the entire space on their own.
“What is it, Hermione?” Harry asked as he directed his gaze towards her puzzled face. He could practically hear the gears turning in her head.
He cleared his throat discretely and nudged Blaise to get the Italian’s eyes off of the Telly screen. “Uh, Blaise....my.....roommate.....”
" Harry reprimanded reproachfully. Draco turned and met his eyes, offering a mock-innocent
“Florence, you know this isn’t your fault. If any, it’s mine—for sending two rookies out in the field by themselves....Regardless, none of us could have predicted that something like this was going to happen. We just have to be thankful that you and the others were able to reach Draco and Harry in time and bring them here.”
Harry blinked open heavy eyelids and glanced around groggily, trying to make out his surroundings.
"Superficially, most of his wounds have been healed," Davies reported positively.
“Uh, boss...” One of the snatchers standing near the Hippogriff coughed briefly, hesitantly trying to get the attention of their leader. “I don’t mean to interrupt, but I reckon this thing is gonna wake up at any minute—so I think we oughta skedaddle.”
"Is something the matter, Ron?" Hermione asked with a frown of her own, clearly feeling as if something wasn't right.
“What a minute, so let me get this straight...” Ron’s booming voice suddenly cut through, and all eyes turned to him.
"We eat Chinese take out almost every Friday—it's kind of our thing to relax into the weekend with." Harry replied with a nonchalant shrug, while Hermione merely looked unsatisfied with the answer.
“But since we don’t want to be partners
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You Gryffindorks...We don’t need to formulate a battle plan to decide how we should introduce ourselves...”
"As long as you're happy, Harry. We'll accept you no matter what." Hermione added a bit tearfully, walking over to give the dark haired wizard a hug.
“By all means, due enlighten everyone here Theo,” Blaise responded in a mock-serious voice, his amber eyes dancing in amusement. Draco jabbed him in the ribs to get him to stop, then nodded to Theo for him to start.
..." He started, voice dipping down low as emotions soared through him. "—are the best thing that's ever happened to me.....I wouldn't give you up for the world...."
“But you know the part that happens next—I was barely conscious for most of it!”
Draco’s breathing stilled. He could feel Harry squirming against his reach, no doubt dying to run out and intervene—but they couldn’t risk it. They were complete newbies for one, and outnumbered two to one for another. Not to mention that there was no telling what that Hippogriff might do, or who it may attack if it regained consciousness.
“Erk...Oh fine...” Harry closed his eyes and steeled himself before starting. “So I guess the story starts a few months after I had started working at the Ministry. I became an Auror shortly after the war was over, and things were going well...Then one day after a case I was on, I got a call from Kingsley and was told to report to his office...”
The “cutesy” voice and pout that Blaise adopted merely prompted a scathing eye roll from the other Slytherin. No one except for Draco would ever know that the cool Italian playboy that broke hearts on a daily basis would have such a side to him—watching muggle cooking shows and trying to act cute to get his way.
“I see.....,” The blonde replied somewhat monotonously. He and Harry didn’t watch a ton of TV- they did indulge in movies quite a few nights of the week when they had the time though.
“Yes,
“C’mon Potter...,” Draco groaned, his hands slowing as a wave of dizziness swept his body.
Draco huffed and shook his head. “There are some parts of our story that still to this day we don’t agree on.”
Harry groaned again and wordlessly nodded. The wards that they kept up around their apartment weren't harmful—they just caused any person who entered without the permission of either him or Draco to fall unconscious moments after they enter the flat—as was what happened to the pair of knocked out Gryffindors.
"About......
“Ah, no....I think he went out to get groceries.....,” Draco lied with another shrug, earning an annoyed pinch on the ass from his dark haired lover. Draco knew that Harry was likely already reaching the end of his temper, but he reached down and swatted the hand away from his butt anyways as he struggled to remain impassive.
"C'mon, put it on~ It's cashmere—ordered custom-made, just for you." The blonde urged with an emphatic wave of his hand.
"Does anything hurt? You have to tell us if it does, alright? Blimey Harry, you scared us to death!" Knightly wailed.
Harry had a full mind to flip Draco over and tear off his boxers, but a loud
"Ready?"
“But I didn’t do anything!” Draco protested in return, paying no heed to the other Gryffindors as they slowly sank, shell-shocked, into seats next to Harry’s.
Before any member of the room could utter a response, Healer Davies clapped his hands again. This time, the door to the infirmary suddenly opened, and several more witches busted through. In the middle of their huddled group was a medical bed, identical to the one that Draco was lain on. As the witches progressed further into the room, they pushed and pulled the bed along with them—wheeling it all the way into the room until it was parked in the middle of the space.
Working together as Aurors for the Ministry as well allowed them to keep the pretense of their relationship as merely partners, so Draco seemed to see no reason in alerting the rest of their colleagues in the department of their true relationship, so all in all—Draco wasn't the least bit concerned about inviting others into their private lives and sharing their secret with them.
“Uh, gee—I don’t know Hermione, maybe...?” He replied vaguely, scratching the back of his neck as tried to appear as though he knew full well what she had asked him.
Again, Draco frowned, looking down at himself suspiciously.
“Yes I do Minister,” Florence declared resolutely.
“There must be some sort of curse on it. There’s no way a thin chain like that would be nearly enough to restrain a Hippogriff.” Harry realized out loud, keeping a steady eye on the creature pacing in front of him. “I remember hearing about the cursed objects that snatchers use to capture and restrain magical creatures with.”
Davies wiped at his brow nervously. "I...I may have a hunch." He paused. "But I'm going to call in another healer to help evaluate the situation." Davies turned to his staff. "Please fetch Healer Blackwell and tell him to report to me in the critical care ward. Tell him it's an absolute emergency regarding patients Potter and Malfoy."
“Potter, I can understand your feelings—but I’ve already put careful thought and consideration into the decision. It’s final,” Kingsley stated gently but firmly, offering the emerald-eyes boy no more than a slightly pitying look. “It’s been years since you’ve seen Draco Malfoy, so I’d like for you to try and not think of him as he was back when you knew him in school—a lot’s changed since then...”
“Don’t worry, I have something special planned for you being such a good boy and putting up with all of this,” Harry promised and settled down onto the couch next to the blonde, passing him a glass of Firewhiskey.
“Haha, humble as ever, eh Potter?” The older wizard grinned and gave a final, brief look around before gesturing Harry to follow.
“Well
Harry sighed and tried not to grimace as he turned and stood facing Draco’s gaunt profile. Though the blonde had seemed as snarky and confident yesterday as Harry had remembered him being in school, the boy he now saw in front of him looked oddly nervous and timid. Draco’s pale grey eyes flitted around quickly and his pale hands clenched together tightly, relaxing a second later only to clench back into a tight fist.
“Alrighty then, any last question?”
“Draco, mate! Good to see ya!” The silky smooth voice of Draco’s best friend drawled as he stepped out of the fireplace—apparently having just flooed in to the flat—despite the lack of the couple’s knowledge.
He groped around dazedly, searching desperately for his wand.
“You’ll officially become partners tomorrow—there’s a special meeting that we need to have to finish all of the formalities, but you won’t start on field assignments together until the end of the week. That way Knightly and I will be able to to monitor and make sure you two don’t try to kill each other before your first assignment together.”
“I had Florence Knightly conduct his training,” Kingsley replied evenly, and Harry’s jaw about came unhinged. “Knightly was more than happy to accept another protege, and had no problems with it being Mr. Malfoy...I also figured it would be a good chance for Knightly to be able to get a good grasp on the both of you to compare and see if you’d make compatible partners...He came to me the other day with the proposition of making you two both full-fledged Aurors, as well as to immediately instate you as partners.”
"Davies!" Kingsley shouted as Draco continued to cry out in unison with Harry.
“Oh?” That pulled a surprised looked from Blaise before it quickly turned into a mischievous smirk. “Got a hot date~?”
Trapped with nowhere to escape, Harry stood frozen to the spot—waiting until Kingsley had glanced up at him and motioned for him to take a seat on a chair that he conjured in front of the desk.
Knightly nodded quickly, grabbing Harry's hand closest to him and squeezing gently. "You and Draco were injured on your mission, but don't worry—you have a team of the best healers helping to fix you up, ma'boy!"
Draco shifted uncomfortably, but tried his best to conceal it by focusing on the show.
Davies turned his gaze to the ground. "At this point, I don't think it's a matter of whether or not they're going to be alright," he said after a moment. "The problem is what this dark magic is doing to them in conjunction. And how hard it's going to be to expel the magic from the two of them."
Pansy glanced over at Draco with a piercing gaze, which he returned with a quirked brow. “And what, pray tell, does this bet have to do with me
“Excellent. Then let’s keep going, shall we?”
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but Pansy beat her to it. “He’s responsible for making potions that make people fall asleep— so they can be operated on, as well as to help make and create new potions that can be used to cure people when they get sick or hurt.” The girl supplied with a minor eye roll.
“Ahhh!” he cried out in pain, searching desperately around for his wand to try and stop the pain. He found his wand and grabbed it, fumbling and tearing at his shirt to try and see the wound that was causing the pain. He ripped his shirt open and pointed his wand at his own chest, but saw no wound. His skin was pale and bare—no different from how it normally looked.
“........Good....view....?” Harry repeated carefully, shooting his lover an
“Hey, now Harry—”
Knightly grumbled under his breath but made no further comment.
“Hmph, you guys just don’t respect me~” Blaise pouted, turning to Draco for support as the blonde too, returned to his seat between him and Harry.
Draco groaned and chewed on his lip before typing back an answer.
know by now?" He continued, glancing up with a smirk to see the slight blush stain the dark haired male's cheeks.
isn’t an answer Dray.”
Draco was still furiously muttering healing spells, not daring to stop for fear that Harry would lose too much blood, so the spell hit them both dead on. With that, the snatcher finally disapparated—leaving the forest in an eery silence.
A moment later, Ron's face suddenly took on the color of a tomato—and Harry knew that his prayer hadn't been answered.
“Oh, and don’t worry. I’ll take the liberty of telling Pans and Theo about this, so expect an owl from them soon~!” The Italian called and sent one last wink before throwing his powder and disappearing into flames.
“Harry...” The Minister started tiredly, rubbing his own temples. “I know you won’t understand now—but all that I’ve done, I’ve done so with a full and complete understanding of the consequences that it may have, as well as the benefits. My decision to make you and Malfoy Auror partners was not one that was made overnight—it was done only after much time of very careful thought and consideration, Alright?”
. Guess what I'm thinking of
“Bloody hell, I can’t take this anymore....” Draco sighed with a groan, leaning against the counter and cradling his head in his hand.
Kingsley glanced over the parchment in satisfaction, nodding as he read through the words.
“Forgive me if my sense of interior decorating is outdated, but why in Merlin’s name would have your couch facing the kitchen instead of the Telly?”
“Thanks to the tip off we received, we were finally able to track down the head of the organization that was cursing all of those muggle objects and reselling them on the black market. After he was captured, we were able to collect the objects and dispel any traces of dark magic from them!”
“Why didn’t you tell me before?!” Blaise exclaimed excitedly, jumping up off of the couch with renewed vigor.
Draco looked doubtful. “Blaise, seriously. We’ve......actually been seeing each other for a while.....”
“I have my resources~” Blaise merely replied silkily, clicking his tongue and sending Harry a wink.
“Haha, well....at least that about covers the extent of our
“Then what
Draco nodded enthusiastically and watched Harry stride out of the room and into their master bathroom. Mind made up, the blonde waltzed into their walk-in closet to find some clothes to wear.
Knightly squinted at Blackwell. "Now I'm not some smarty-pants healer like you folk, but I'm pretty sure you just repeated everything that we already know, and just phrased it differently."
” Draco questioned with a wrinkle of his nose.
The blonde thought hard, frowning for a moment before placing the quill to parchment.
Kingsley bit back the chuckle that threatened to rise in his throat once more and clapped each of those boys on the back with a wide smile. “Don’t worry! I have all the faith that you two will do extremely well together.”
Harry paled.
Harry stopped and bit his lip.
“.......Not
“Well then, is there any...advice...that your could...possibly give us...?” Draco bit the inside of his cheek awkwardly as Harry stared at him as if he had two heads, and Florence looked like he wanted gush over how cute he was acting.
Draco watched the scene unfold in front of him and released a howl of laughter—clutching at his sides as he laughed in unadulterated joy—wiping tears of mirth from his eyes after another moment of basking in the amusement. After a few more snickers he glanced up at Harry, who closed his eyes and scrubbed at his face with the back of his hands—a
“Yeah...same old-same old I s’pose...” The redhead muttered with a shrug, for some reason taking a fascination in the table cloth and not lifting his eyes.
“Well, I never did care for this furniture arrangement anyways!” Draco replied immediately—snatching his wand out of his back pocket with sudden motivation.
The blonde shrugged, offering the Minister a slightly arrogant
“All I need is for each of you to sign underneath your designated line,” Kingsley explained quietly, gesturing for Harry to step forwards. “Right here.”
interrupted that thought process.
?” A blonde eyebrow twitched in annoyance.
"You were treating my boys like guinea pigs?!"
fault then."
“Ah this is so exciting! My little Dray Dray spreading his wings off into the world of romance~!”
Draco turned around with another pout, stirring away at the pan on the stove in front of him—perhaps more vigorously than desired due to his put out mood.
"I see." Kingsley nodded.
“With the recommendation of Auror Knightly, we will now proceed with the affirmation and oath by the candidates for initiation.”
“So, where exactly are we putting this?”
??!!" Hermione gasped in shock, mimicking Ron's exact reaction as she stepped out of the fireplace and onto the plush carpet—jaw hanging slack and eyes bulged at the sight in front of her.
Florence disguised his shock with a slight cough. “We couldn’t figure out exactly what happened to Draco—but he was knocked unconscious and we couldn’t wake him up. I’m guessing he got jinxed with dark magic as well.” He reached into his robes and produced a silver pocket-watch—turning his head ninety degrees to read the numbers. “I reckon it’s been close to about 3 hours now since me, Eddlson, and the gang brought the two of them in here...”
Another scoff.
Surprisingly, the nurse relented pretty easily. “Of course, Minister.” She almost looked relieved, as if she had secretly wanted him to go anyways. “If you’ll follow me this way...”
"Hey!"
This exchange went unnoticed as everyone else had there attention directed towards Hermione with interest—whether feigned or not.
“Now please, do continue,” Blaise prompted with an evil grin.
“Thank you, for the invitation...But you’re taken—isn’t that right, love?” Draco cut in suddenly, wrapping a possessive arm over Harry’s shoulders and staring the man down with a cool look in his piercing grey eyes. Hermione and Ron glanced up, and their eyes bulged once again at the Slytherin’s unabashed display of affection for their friend—while Blaise merely smirked in amusement.
“A-Alrighty Boss, if you’re sure....” The plump man turned back to the remaining group of snapped his fingers, motioning for them to follow. With a loud ‘
“This Hippogriff must have escaped when they were trying to transport it.” Draco nodded in agreement.
“Tea?” Kingsley glanced up and pushed two freshly-filled mugs across the table towards them. “You both seem nervous, this will help.”
“Excellent job ma’boys. It’s well earned and deserved,” Florence congratulated, turning between the two and clapping them each on the back.
“Well at least the kids like me~” The male shot back childishly.
“Well, it’s the truth...” Harry muttered back quietly.
Harry gently tugged Draco’s neck back down to connect their lips once more, and he resumed his earlier attempts at groping his lover’s firm ass.
Seconds later the pair found themselves in a carpeted hallway, leading directly to a pair of dark, wooden doors.
“I still don’t think this is a good idea...”
"Healer Davies, sir."
“Yeah, but how do we know you didn’t lie to Harry about what happened?” Ron butted in again, narrowing his eyes at the blonde.
“Just
Harry walked into the room until he was standing directly in front of Kingsley’s desk, Florence striding up beside him. It was hardly Harry’s first time to visit Kingsley’s office, but it still made him feel strangely nervous each time he did so.
“I did...” Blaise replied with a slight smirk. “I sent them each an owl, at least.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes briefly, as though unsure of the answer.
"Wait!" Knightly suddenly exclaimed. "Why don't you finish putting on that healing potion while they're still knocked out? It obviously wasn't a good idea to do it while they were still conscious..."
“Aw, Alright......another time then...”
She peered over them, tracing a finger down the text before tapping on one particular spot. “It says here that Mr. Malfoy was sent to surgery earlier but is now resting in the critical ward, currently anesthetized. And, Mr. Potter is—...” She turned her gaze to the other clipboard and squinted, then sighed. “It says that Mr. Potter is still in surgery....”
“Alright then—excellent job you two. I’ll expect an official report from the both of you, then we’ll file this down to the people in Intermagical Law to be taken care of once and for all,” He announced with a final nod, placing the parchment inside of a folder and sliding it into a drawer in his desk.
enough, and a flick of his wand sent a well aimed throw pillow to effectively shut up the Slytherin with a firm blow to the face.
“Evening, Potter.”
, you're not right
Draco nodded and turned slightly to Harry. “So, who’s next?”
"Oh." Harry closed his eyes and tried to swallow his embarrassment. "It's because I was screaming, wasn't I?" His voice was flat. It was more a statement than a question.
“Potter.”
“Shh-shush!” Draco playfully swatted his lover. “You have to bait them in suspense! Don’t spoil it!”
"I'll get to that in a moment," Davies replied cooly, signaling for Florence to step away from the bed.
Draco met the challenge with a tight-lipped grin of his own. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
This time Blaise lifted his head off of the back of the couch enough to turn his head and meet the blonde’s glare. “
, Malfoy?” Harry quipped snarkily, earning yet another sigh from Kingsley.
The jinx hit the Hippogriff in the right wing, and it faltered—dropping down to its knees.
, right?"
"Alright then....."
“Ah, we sent them down to the Department of Muggle Artifacts to be checked over and restored to their former appearances. After that they should be able to be sent back to the Muggles that they were stolen from, right Potter?” Florence rattled off concisely, glancing at Harry for a nod of agreement.
“Huh? Oh, yeah...Ron and Hermione, and Ginny too...” The Gryffindor replied a bit tersely, and Draco nearly laughed at the irony.
Davies nodded slowly. "Alright. Let's try that then!"
Polite clapping and a few cheers erupted from the small band of Aurors.
"The dark magic that's still inside of them..."
Suddenly he felt himself being pushed and beckoned forwards, and he realized that he was supposed to step closer to the podium. Kingsley slowly descended from the stand and stopped between the two boys smiling gently.
often."
All eyes went to Blackwell.
Apparently the glare that he received worked—Ron immediately grew quiet and slumped back into his seat with pink-tinged ears.
"That's all well and good and all, but have you thought about what will happen if they don't accept us?"
"You're on
Draco groaned internally as he felt the hands on his thighs tighten their grip. “I don’t remember ever complaining about him to you,” He sighed with a frown.
" Harry protested with a groan—knocking his foot into the blonde's leg in reprimandment.
“So—let’s hear it.” Pansy turned to Draco with a smirk.
"I know this looks bad," Davies quickly interjected, seeing the appalled look on all of their faces, "but look here—this is part of the wound that's already been healed." He gestured to a thin silvery line that started in the middle of Harry's stomach where the wound was still bleeding. The silver mark continued down and disappeared underneath the sheets where the lower half of Harry's body remained covered.
Blaise waved a hand dismissively. “This is nothing.”
fault.”
“What part of
"The scan in question revealed dark magic in both boys' bodies, in the same areas. This dark magic, unlike the kind that we dispelled from them, showed no signs of causing any sort of damage within either wizard's system. We ran many different tests on both of the boys, but nothing that we did seemed to affect the magic in anyway. So—while we waited for all of the results from those scans to be brought to us so we could study them further—we finally decided that we would take Mr. Malfoy out of surgery first and see how he would do after the anesthesia potions that we administered had worn off. Meanwhile, we would continue to monitor Mr. Potter under anesthesia while we continuing to try some... different methods of expelling the dark magic." Davies paused—waiting for a reaction.
This time a hush broke over the small group, and only Florence began clapping as the blonde strode out quickly—not making eye contact with anyone in the room. The shocked group slowly followed suit and began clapping until Draco stood in his destined spot beside Harry.
Harry grimaced at being described as a
This time the Hippogriff gave screech as it fell over—and two of the other wizards quickly ran over to restrain it.
Harry, on the other hand, had plenty of people that he had been keeping in the dark about his relationship status. Hermione and Ron, Ginny, the rest of the Weasley's whom he considered his own blood family—not a single one of them knew. The dark haired male figured it would have been bad enough to simply keep them out of the loop in terms of him finding a significant other—but when he actually lined up all of the bullet points of things he had yet to actually tell them....
“The winner will be the recipient of 100 galleons...?” Theo questioned cooly, and Blaise nodded numbly in response.
with you...." Harry mumbled with a chuckle, but didn't stop his lover's advances as Draco bent down to capture his lips once again—this time with a more heated urgency, sweeping his tongue over the Gryffindor's bottom lip before taking it between his teeth to tug at teasingly.
"What are you fussing about Ro— H-H-
“Did you hear him say the spell, Draco?” Kingsley asked grimly.
“Pansy and Theo.” Draco nodded, standing up from the table. “Shall I escort them in to our table of fun?”
Once again, Harry ignored the question, and made for the staircase—thinking to change himself into actual clothes (he had forgotten that he'd been in nothing but his boxers this entire time), and then figure out a game plan of how he was going to explain the situation to Ron and Hermione.
Harry’s eyes widened before his brows drew down in a frown. “That’s...horrible...how come there hasn’t been anything down about it?”
"Dark magic?" Harry frowned. "But I thought injuries by dark magic couldn't be healed?"
“Potter has a nasty wound on his chest and it’s not closing—we need to to bring him into the critical ward right now!”
“Florence,” Kingsley’s deep voice called, and the Auror was by his side in a second—the pair following the nurse down a long, winding hallway.
“...We just thought it would be nice to...catch up,” He finally offered with another awkward brush of his fingers through his hair.
a Great Aunt Agatha."
Kingsley smiled down at the two and offered his own round of applause before reaching underneath the podium and bringing forth a sealed role of parchment that the pair knew all too well from the night before.
cologne, you tosser? Fine, next rule.
“Eh? So what—somebody saw us snogging on the couch. That’s nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.”
“Alright. It’s....2:30 now—,” The green eyed wizard confirmed after glancing up at the clock on their wall. “I’m gonna go take a bath, so you can chat for a bit with your mate and then kindly excuse him—alright? We can have lunch after that.”
“Why not? Then I can have a good view!” Draco stated with a mischievous smirk, plopping down on the couch and earning a puzzled frown from the darker haired wizard.
“As Minister of Magic, I now call this session into order,” Kinglsey’s deep voice boomed through the open room, followed by the rap of a gavel hitting the stand. “To all who are gathered here today, I have asked you to bear witness to the initiation ceremony for two of our newly entered Auror trainees. Directly following the initiation, we will continue on with the ritual for Auror partnership.”
“Turn your comment into an innuendo? Yes. Yes I did.”
“Splendid—we should be just in time to tune in for the show!” The dark skinned male exclaimed with a grin, strolling over to take a seat next to Draco on the couch. He stopped short, however, and gave the couch a once over before raising a questioning eyebrow.
"Well, that could've gone a hell of a lot worse!" Draco replied brightly, laughing as he remembered the face that Ron was making again.
, Potter!” The blonde snapped irritably, refusing his lover’s advances.
The figure that lay in the bed looked pale and fragile—face gaunt with dark circles and pasty skin that seemed almost translucent against the crisp white sheets. The only thing that distinguished it from a corpse was the slight rise and fall of his chest.
"I'm sure glad
A sudden sound made Harry jerk in surprise, and alerted the couple to the presence of company in their living room.
“Ah, those three make bets with each other all the time—sometimes I join in...I have no clue what they were just betting on now though...” Draco replied with a quirked eyebrow in Blaise’s direction.
“Oh...” He slowly extended his left arm forward, hesitating before loosely grasping Harry’s forearm.
“Ah, Draco!” Florence exclaimed, tears of relief in his eyes. He knelt down beside the bed and grabbed one of Draco’s pale hand in his own two. “Are you alright? How are you feeling? The nurses here haven’t told us anything!”
“Alright. Draco Malfoy.”
"Malfoy,
?! You know that
....."
Harry stoped his pacing to gaze over at his astoundingly astute lover, nodding his head in confirmation.
“Dracoooooo!” Pansy whined, tapping her feet on the ground anxiously. “You can’t just stop on a cliffhanger like that! Tell us what happened next!”
Harry laughed lightly at the response and leaned back to stare into Draco's grey eyes.
“If you think
Ron screwed his face in an expression that suggested he was in extreme pain—but to those who knew him realized this to be the expression that he took on when thinking deeply about something.
“No way in hell, Potter.”
“Do you...work with children as well...?” Hermione asked timidly, almost afraid of getting snapped at by the other girl.
Harry and Draco sat on the couch across from the Minister, plastered as far away as the opposite sides of the couch would let them be. They were both tense and unsure of what would be happening next.
“Well, just let me know later how you’re feeling—can’t have you kids sick out on your first assignment tomorrow!” Kingsley managed to say brightly, drawing looks of horror from the two boys.
The dark haired male shifted uncomfortably and tried to resist the temptation to flit his eyes back to the kitchen where he knew Draco was cooking away. Thankfully the blonde had enough sense to throw up a sound Charm around the kitchen to keep his noises from being heard by those in the living room.
when upset, so Harry found it amusing to join in on the game as well—teasing the blonde despite his obviously pissed off attitude.
"Is he waking?" Blackwell strode over to Draco's bedside and peered down at the boy.
“All you have to tell us...” Pansy continued slowly.
“Honesty, I have
Hermione turned and sent a scowl to the redhead. “I’m not your property, Ronald. I’m free to choose how I would like to be addressed...”
"Alright, I'll add it to the books.
“Merlin’s beard, would you lot quit arguing and just catch the thing already? We’ve wasted enough time as it is, and we’re going to be running late for our meeting if we don’t hurry this little detour up.”
“Well, we still have an active bet between the three of us that has yet to decide a winner...” Theo interjected solemnly, and Blaise and Pansy immediately snapped to attention with a gasp.
Harry watched the exchange between the four Slytherins with an expression just short of astonishment.
“Over there...” Draco whispered lowly, face inches beside Harry’s. Harry attempted to ignore the feeling of the blonde’s breath tickling his ear, and tried to look where Draco was gesturing. The pair peeked up above the bushes they were hiding behind just as a group of 4 men burst out of the trees and stood in the clearing—the exact place where Harry and Draco had just been seconds before.
Davie's quickly yelled to one of his nurses, "Anesthetic potions, now!"
"The analysis from the scan tells us for sure that the magic we're dealing with came from the same caster, and, most likely, came from the same spell. With that in mind, we can deduce that the magic inside each of them is one and the same."
Harry opened his mouth for a comeback but faltered, and closed his mouth again with a frown.
"-W-wha-? Wait! What's—???!!!!"
The two seemed completely incapable of uttering a single word, so Draco allowed himself to continue—walking around the couch to lean against the chair that Harry was occupying.
Harry smiled to himself and followed after the older man.
Anybody I would know then~?”
“I’m not quite sure, myself,” Florence replied slowly. “As soon as the healers took a look at you when we brought you in, they said that your vitals signs were all dropping extremely fast...Harry’s were as well, but that was attributed to the large injury on his chest...”
“Alright, then let’s do this,” Theo offered with a smirk of his own. “Have Potter and Malfoy tell us the story of how they started dating...then we’ll reveal the bet we made, and the winner of said bet...”
Blaise snickered and clapped Theo on the back. “I swear, you shoulda been placed in Ravenclaw you goodie goodie.”
"R-Ron,
"No......need you....Draco...
From the way the Draco saw it, he didn't have any family that he wanted to tell about it—his father was locked away in Azkaban (and he didn't give two dragon craps what his old man had to say anymore), and his mother had passed away from emotional turmoil and stress a few years prior—leaving Draco detached from any other familial connections that he had.
Minutes passed and nothing but the sound of crunching leaves and the whisper of a breeze filled the air. Harry walked in front, wand held loosely by his side as he kept a steady watch around for anything that might be ahead of them. Draco followed only a short distance behind, his own wand stashed away in the confines of his back pocket as he trained his focus in just ahead of Harry’s figure. So far they had been walking for closed to 10 minutes and hadn’t seen sight of a single thing—person nor creature.
“..Wha-?” Florence jerked his head up in surprise at the call of his name. He blinked bleary eyes and looked around in confusion—he hadn’t remembered closing his eyes for a nap.
"We both know that you would rather go straight to Azkaban and beg my father for my hand in marriage than go one night without sleeping with me.”
happened...”
“Yes sir.”
“Alright then,” Kingsley stopped moving his wand, and only wispy silver lines remained as evidence of the spell, wrapping and curving around the boys’ still-entwined arms. Both stared at the arms numbly as Kingsley stored his wand and turned to address the small crowd of Aurors. “Witches and Wizards of the Department of Aurors—may I present to you the newest team of Aurors to the department!”
“...Well, that’s...something that will be discussed at a later time.”
The four walked into the living room together and Ron begrudgingly stepped into the fireplace with Hermione—still giving Draco a shifty look.
“N-no way, sir...You couldn’t possibly mean...”
“Does it really matter, Potter?” Draco returned with an agitated sigh. “If we walk North from here we should be able to make it to Hogsmeade in about 15 minutes.”
“Barely conscious? What ever were you doing, Potter?” Blaise questioned in amusement.
Harry used what little strength he had and lifted his head to meet the snatcher’s mocking smirk.
She sighed deeply and nodded her head. “Yes, that’s what I was thinking too. Pity though...”
"That's quite alright. We have more pressing matters at hand. The formalities can wait," Kingsley said.
“Dammit, that’s it!” Harry finally maneuvered his elbow free and quickly rammed it backwards. It connected solidly with Draco’s side and his grip on Harry released.
Draco and Blaise continued to bicker back and forth, and soon Hermione began to converse quietly with Ron. Harry glanced around awkwardly at the lack of a conversational partner before he noticed a waiter walking towards their table, levitating several coffee cups in front of him.
Apparently that was the end of the conversation, so Draco heaved a begrudging sigh and exited the bathroom back into the living room. Blaise had a apparently figured out the basis of how to work the remote control, so he was back in his position on the couch watching the same Muggle cooking show that he had been preoccupied with before.
“How about this?” Theo finally cut in. “You each tell us the story from your own point of view and impression of how things happened. Then maybe we’ll all be able to read between the lines a bit and figure out something closer to the truth of what
Ro-......"
The words however merely washed over Draco, who easily scoffed and rolled his eyes at the threat. "Oh
The last part came out a bit more sarcastic than Harry had meant for it to, but it was too late to start taking back words now.
“...Ah, I see...” Harry paled slightly and nodded his head meekly. There
Kingsley nodded. "Please, continue."
“Alright, let’s continue,” He prompted his lover once he was sure that no one else was going to raise a fuss.
Draco grabbed the remote and bent down as he pretended to fish the remote control from between the cushions of the couch.
” The blonde growled in annoyance, shooting down his friend’s playful smirk with a scowl.
Harry, who had gone pale in shock, froze—eyes wide in disbelief as he met those of his closest friends. Draco, on the other hand, maintained his usual calm and cool exterior and made no move to remove himself from the extremely suggestive position he was in between the Gryffindor's legs—smirking gleefully at what he assumed were absolutely dumbstruck faces that the new visitors were pulling. Instead of turning around right away and revealing his identity, he remained facing the couch—shifting his gaze upwards to his lover.
“I’m pretty sure we were further along than
, you mean...”
“It’s quite simple actually,” Blaise started with a nod.
“I mean, sure—we already told Granger, Weaslebe, and Blaise about us- but that’s only half of the party that you’re inviting! Add in Theo, Pansy, and Weaslette and I’m pretty sure things are gonna go downhill real fast...”
"So Potter, how are we feeling?" The healer questioned, producing a wand from his white robes and lighting the tip with a swish.
“Excited much, Parkinson?” Draco drawled dryly, raising a blonde eyebrow.
Hermione threw Ron a pointed look behind Harry’s back as they followed—and the redhead understood it as a silent warning to be on his best behavior, or there would be consequences later. They quickly reached the table in question, and Harry stopped and stepped to the side slightly—once again, running his fingers through his hair.
Harry cast a nervous glance at Draco, but the blonde simply stared at the floor—his gaze transfixed like he was deep in thought.
...........about
“Alrigh—Oh~? You’re Harry Potter~!” The waiter’s eyes suddenly opened wide and he gushed with a gleam in his eye. “You’re the one that defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! You’re a war hero!”
“Well, we’ve been seriously trying to put a stop to all blood bigoting—and that’s where our
“I know....that doesn’t keep the feelings of regret away though....”
“I’ll get on with it when I very well feel like it,
“Uh, sure...?”
“Is that so....” Draco smirked wryly, raising an amused eyebrow at the prospect. “Anyways, glad to know you’re not prejudiced—but he is a wizard...”
"Seriously. For good now. I just want to be me—a normal wizard, who works as an Auror for the Ministry, hates it when things aren't tidy, and loves my boyfriend—who just happens to be the savior of the Wizarding World." Draco finished his mini-speech with a firm nod of resignation, and Harry grabbed his hand underneath the table and gave it a squeeze of support.
Harry nearly voiced out his displeasure of him having broken the kiss so quickly—but he suddenly remembered that he was in front of his friends. Kissing his lover. Who also happened to be Draco Malfoy. Who didn't have a good history with his two friends. And who also looked like they wanted to throw up and murder him at the same time.
Once preparations were complete for the ointment to be applied yet again, Davies' hovered over Harry's chest, dropper in-hand. Knightly stood across from him, watching Harry's wound closely. A short distance away, Blackwell and Kingsley were in similar positions hovered over Draco's body—both sets of eyes trained on Draco's wound.
“Excellent. Now—you must both swear by the rules and ethos of the Department of Aurors, to uphold and protect the name with which you will soon be bestowed.” Kingsley shifted parchments and cleared his throat before reading.
” Harry hissued angrily, barely able to restrain himself as Draco quickly put a hand over his mouth to silence him.
The quill levitating in front of him scratched noisily against the floating piece of parchment, leaving a trail of inked words as it went.
“Oh, is Saint Potter waiting on lowly
Healer Davies looked uncomfortable. "Ah, yes...Well..." He cleared his throat and looked backwards to his posse, clapping his hands. One of the witches stepped forward and presented him with a clipboard.
“You three made a wager on how Harry and Malfoy...got...you know...
"Now—where were we..." Davies glanced around before striding over to a nearby cabinet. After rustling inside for a moment, he returned with two small jars of what appeared to be colored rocks. "Blackwell?" Davies passed one of the jars over to his comrade.
came from Blaise’s mouth as he stroked his chin in thought. “Does he work at the Ministry?”
Pansy rubbed her hands together eagerly. “Alright, now I’m getting excited! C’mon, spare none of the juicy details!”
Draco’s jaw slackened in surprise, and a short stutter of disbelieving laughter escaped his lips. “W-what? Harry, that’s embarrassing...”
“I would like to know the status of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. They were brought in a few hours ago and we haven’t heard anything since.”
“Look. No matter what either the two of you think about this new arrangement, I’m afraid to say that there’s nothing that I can do for you at the moment,” Kingsley refuted firmly, staring each of the boys down with an even glance. “Now I’m going to help you guys set some ground rules first, so this’ll help for the most part with keeping the two of you safe— others as well as yourselves.”
Harry stared cooly back at the snatcher, wand raised and standing his ground. “Step away from the Hippogriff. Under article 13, section 6 of the bylaws set forth by the Ministry of Magic, Hippogriffs are declared as an endangered species. As such they are—,”
“Yes, I as well...” Theo murmured with a somewhat confused frown and a nod of his head. “That seems like...somewhat
"To put it simply Weaslebrain, we're dating. Have been for over two years."
“I’m telling you Draco—you severely underestimate me~”
“Quick, get me a stabilizing potion stat!”
“Thought so.” Draco sneered, resuming his pacing.
"Look you two, I really am sorry.....for...a lot of things...." The dark haired male began quietly, fixing them both with an apologetic look. "I just....I think it'll be better if we sit down and talk....I can explain how this all happened.."
“Harry,
The motion however caused Draco to freeze suddenly.
“Don’t worry, I’m polite enough to know when I’ve worn out my welcome~ I’ll get leaving so you two can continue your shag that I interrupted earlier.”
"It's alright now Harry. What's important is that you're both safe and sound," Kingsley soothed with his deep and calming voice.
Each took a careful look around before jumping to their feet and pulling out their wands.
Draco sighed and crossed his arms over his chest. “I don’t need any help, thanks Blaise.”
“No.”
"I get....why you want to tell your friends about us...sorta......You feel like you're betraying them by lying to them.....?"
Harry was still leaning back into the couch, legs separated and a hand holding the head of blonde hair nestled between his thighs. Draco's back was still to the fireplace, leaving his identity unbeknownst to the new guests—but he could just imagine what kind of faces the two Gryffindor's were making.
"I know that it's a lot to take in....but it's the truth." Harry uttered earnestly, not knowing what else he could say to plead his case.
Kingsley nodded in satisfaction, glancing over a small stack of parchment a top his desk with a hum—stopping here and there to jot down notes with the quill in his hand.
"Mmmm, I know....." Draco responded dazedly, already rocking his hips rhythmically as he continued to move further south on his lover's body.
The jumper disappeared into thin air—leaving a scowling Gryffindor and a smug Slytherin.
Harry let his hands roam downwards as he busied his mouth with his lover’s, reaching the hem of Draco’s pants and fumbling to undo his belt. The Gryffindor growled in annoyance and groped around for his wand. With the swish of a wrist both of their pants were gone and the dark haired wizard happily returned to his exploring—sneaking his hands around his lover’s smooth underwear-clad butt and swatting it lovingly.
He jerked slightly and snapped out of his train of thought as he felt equally firm fingers suddenly contact his own forearm.
Harry quickly covered the pale lips with his hand before Draco could get another word out, but clearly the message had gotten across to Ron—who looked on the verge of being sick again. He felt relief but also a bit of sorrow as he waved at the two in the fireplace before they tossed a pinch of powder and disappeared into a spark of flames.
"I knew your sizes because, let's be honest—is there any part of your body that I
, Blaise,” Draco sighed in annoyance, as if he was so much more knowledgeable in the realm of muggle objects than his dark skinned friend.
Draco shook his head again, a strange expression crossing his face. “Not really.....Right after that snatcher hit us, he disapparated....which I did think was strange, but I was too relieved he was gone to think much more of it....” He paused and absentmindedly rubbed his chest near his shoulder as he continued. “Shortly afterwards though, I started getting this horrible pain somewhere in my chest—but I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from since I didn’t have any wounds there. That was the last thing I remember before I must’ve passed out, and then woke up here.....”
"There's only one thing that I can think of that could've caused this..." said Davies tentatively.
The leader of the snatcher group looked over at Harry in surprise. “Well, well, well—what do we have here, boys?”
Suddenly Hermione stopped talking and stared directly at him, and Harry realized that she must have asked him something.
“Draco, enough.” Harry soothed with a chuckle. “Everything is going to be just fine.”
This time, they answered together. “I swear.”
Harry started sputtering and Draco threw his head back with a laugh.
Florence rose from his seat with a broad grin, waving at the applause that broke out as he made him way down to where Harry and Draco stood.
"I distinctly remember asking you to
Harry quirked a brow and Ron quickly amended his statement.
The voices stopped abruptly and the door was pushed open gently, revealing a menagerie of healers and nurses.
“New to the term ‘
"Look Harry.." He finally sighed, getting up from his place on their sofa and moving to lean against the window next to it.
Healer Davies peered at Harry briefly before nodding his head in self-satisfaction. "As you can see, young Mr. Potter is doing just fine now that he's out of surgery."
Harry paled slightly, glancing around at the eagerly awaiting faces nervously. “...You know on second thought, Draco can go first...”
from what I thought you’d be like...” Hermione finally commented with a slight quirk of her head.
It didn't seem possible, but Harry paled even further—and before he had a chance to stop his lover from doing something stupid—Draco shot him a wink and a smirk before opening his mouth to retort.
“Honestly Ron, grow up,” Harry finally exclaimed, glaring down the redhead until he finally dropped his gaze with a grumble.
made together, Parkinson~”
"I'm forgetting something." He muttered seriously.
comes in,” Kingsley explained with a nod, opening the folder and pulling out a sheet of parchment for Harry to look over. “Basically, the program is to help rehabilitate and find jobs for those who are being oppressed due to their blood status. Muggleborn, Pureblood, anything. Any person who is being discriminated against will be able to file a form and receive help from our departments.”
"Mmm..aah..
“Oh~?” The Italian quirked his lips into a daring smirk. “Did I disappoint you~?” His tone dropped and took on a flirty note as he stared the brunette down.
Draco rolled his eyes again. “Humble as ever, aren’t you.”
“Hurry up and go upstairs before he comes over here and sees you!” He whispered furiously to Harry, motioning to the staircase rapidly. Harry sent a loathing scowl to the blonde, but did as instructed—waiting until he was sure that Blaise’s gaze was occupied in a different direction, then crouching down and stealthily making his way to the staircase a few steps away.
“My, my—now
“Well, well, well—what do we have here...?” Draco drawled quietly, eyeing Harry up and down.
groan escaping his lips as he did so.
“Of how we started dating...”
Florence felt a hand settle on his shoulder and he looked up in surprise to see none other the Minister of Magic himself—Kingsley Shacklebolt, standing in front of him.
Apparently something was said that he missed, for he soon realized that Harry and Kingsley were both staring straight at him— waiting for him to do something.
Several more winding corridors and an elevator trip later, the pair were gently ushered past a pair of wide doors—guarded by a stern-looking wizard on either side. The men nodded to the Minister as he and Florence passed through the doors, and the room opened up to a large space containing several beds and large cabinets that anyone would surmise would be filled with all sorts of medicines, potions, and other ointments.
...” Hermione grimaced. “C’mon, I’ll help you to the loo.”
Harry didn't know if he wanted to sigh with relief or groan in pain at the sudden appearance of his lover—but for the moment, he decided that he would feel a bit more relieved.
“I’m afraid...that that will no longer be possible.”
"I have," Harry replied confidently. "They're my friends, and I know them well. Even if they don't.......accept us....right away, I know that they will eventually.”
“That’s your ride boys!”
Just then a chorus of low voices could be heard in the hallway, gaining volume slightly as they approached the door that Florence and Kingsley had entered not long before.
“I swear,” Harry responded immediately. He glanced over as Draco faltered for a moment.
"—We have enough time to fit it a quick round before they get here!" Draco interrupted smoothly, trailing his hands around Harry's backside to rest snuggly at his ass.
Draco nodded. “I...knew we had to get backup, so I sent you that message....I jumped in to help Harry after, but all of the snatchers took off with the Hippogriff before we could stop them....Except for one guy.” He frowned and ran a trembling hand through his hair. “That guy, I think he was the leader. His magic was really strong and Harry got knocked by one of his spells before I could do anything.”
“Very good,” Kingsley nodded and pulled a new piece of parchment and laid it on top of the podium. “We will now begin the initiation of new Aurors into the Department. I would like to ask the mentor of each of these two to step forward. Auror Florence Knightly, if you please.”
related to how you two started dating?”
Said Malfoy picked that exact moment to stalk into the closet behind the dark haired male, quirking an unamused brow at the cold shoulder that he was getting.
Blaise clapped his hands happily and strolled past Draco into the kitchen. “So you’re having dinner here later, I assume? So what were you planning on cooking; French? Maybe, Italian? I am a bit of an expert in that particular area....”
“Haha, relax.”
Draco froze and tilted his head suspiciously. “......Why are you asking that....?”
“Ron, stop,” Hermione scolded as she took her seat next to him.
Harry finally stopped his tirade of questions and comebacks, and merely sat still—trying to take it all in. “So...when do we have to start working together...?” The question came out as a defeated mumble, and Kingsley merely chuckled lightly at the pouty attitude of the younger.
to give directions on where we should go?” Draco mocked.
Kingsley moved around the side of Draco's bed to stand in front of the man, shaking his outstretched hand. "Likewise. And you are?"
After a moment, they separated—and Draco's face resumed it's normal cocky expression with smirking lips.
“Hmm?” Harry glanced on the side of the blonde and frowned. “Where did Zabini go?”
Ron immediately frowned. “You say that like we didn’t go to school for 7 years with that git...”
Harry sighed and gave the couch another frown. “It doesn’t really make sense for the couch to be facing the kitchen though......”
“Phew—finally done! Y’alright there, Potter?”
.....?”
It had been only hours earlier that he had been sitting in his office, anxious as can be as he wondered how Harry and Draco were doing. The mission that Florence had sent the two on was rated extremely low on the danger scale. In fact, Florence wasn’t even sure that the snatchers had been anywhere near the forest that he sent them to. The mission was meant more as a mock test of how well the two worked together. Even so, Florence had taken the precaution of specifically warning the two that they were not to engage if they spotted any trouble—and clearly that hadn’t happened. Who knew that, as fate might have it, the duo would happen to stumble across a band of those snatchers?
Draco rolled his eyes and followed behind as Harry began walking through an opening of trees that seemed to have a decently tamped down walking trail.
“Oh come now, can’t we just continue on with the story like civilized Gryffindors and Slytherins?” Blaise cut silkily, earning an array of scowls in return.
..nuh.......” Draco moaned in pleasure as Harry quickly took control of the kiss—snaking a hand around the back of his neck and holding him firmly in place. The blonde whimpered in pleasure as the inside of his mouth was throughly ravished by the Gryffindor—tongues tangling and caressing each other gently but firmly.
Harry grimaced at the mere mention of the vile bone replenishing potion that he had been forced to take in second year. Just the name brought back horrible flashbacks of that most unfortunate accident involving a bewitched bludger and Gildroy Lockhart.
Blaise returned the look with a snicker. “Ah, well you see...Theo and Pans made a bet about Granger and Wesley getting hitched. There was a rumor in Witch Weekly that those two had gotten engaged and held a secret wedding a while back, but I think there was still speculation about whether or not it was actually true,” He rambled with a shrug. “Pansy said that they did get married, and Theo said that they didn’t. They made the bet a while ago, that’s why Theo thought that Pansy had already forgotten.”
"Oh don't bother concerning yourself over
"What the bloody hell did you do to me while I was under?!"
, you
Ron and Hermione exchanged frowns and followed Harry into the kitchen, where a table had already been set for four.
“After you, Potter.”
He paused and glanced up between the two before returning to the parchment.
“Uh, yeah. That’s correct, sir.”
“Ah, yes sir!”
“Thanks...” Harry murmured quietly, hesitantly pulling the mug closest to him into his hands. Kingsley nodded and turned to glance at Draco, but the blonde remained frozen and made no move to reach for his mug—staring blankly at the wall somewhere behind Kingsley.
"You can't keep it in, can you~?" Draco teased, kissing and nipping at the sensitive flesh of Harry's thighs as they quivered in arousal.
The case that Kingsley had entrusted to the two of them had been one they’d been dealing with for nearly a month. They only finally wrapped the case up that morning after receiving a lead that proved to be exactly what they needed to tie up the last loose ends.
“Now now, we have plenty of time for that,” Blaise interjected with a sly grin, motioning for the newly arrived pair to take a seat. “Don’t be rude Pansy, you’re supposed to greet your superiors.”
Harry nodded numbly and rose from his seat, sighing in defeat. “Just...one last question.”
Harry sighed and bit back the retort on his tongue. “First we should figure out where we’re even at.” He glanced around yet again and found nothing but trees—tall and looming.
Harry turned around stiffly as the sound of heavy oak doors being opened filled the office. The sound stopped, and a tall, blonde figure strolled into the room. Apparently he wasn’t expecting anybody but the Minister, for a sleek blonde brow rose in surprise upon seeing Harry standing next to the desk.
The entire space, like any other hospital or medical ward, was completely stark white—and the strange scent of sanitizing potions and foreign medicines filled the air.
10 minutes later and Harry strode down the staircase, wearily searching out his lover for fear of the mischief that he was mostly likely getting ready to amuse himself with.
I told them to come at 4....."
Harry ignored the question and swished his wand. "
"Alright, I'll start applying the wound—so let me know if anything changes," Davies said, glancing at each of three other members. With a nod from Blackwell, Davies slowly squeezed the dropper. Like before, several drops of the the high-strength healing topical splashed onto Harry's wound. Almost immediately, the wound seized up and began to cauterize where the liquid touched open skin. Davies applied several more drops when he heard a gasp from behind. He met Blackwell's astounded gaze.
The comment caught Draco off-guard, and the snatcher used that opportunity to throw a jinx at Harry.
Draco glanced back upon hearing another presence in the kitchen, and offered a somewhat apologetic smile to the dark haired male.
“Where did my jeans go?”
“Oh just get on with it you bloody tosser,” Ron cut in impatiently, frowning in annoyance.
The blonde ignored his dark haired lover beneath him and leaned onto the back of the couch, trying to make his sitting posture seem completely normal. Blaise was busy glancing around the room, and took no notice of his friend’s strange behavior.
Kingsley sighed and nodded his head in agreement, gently patting Harry on his non-afflicted shoulder. "How much longer then should it take until the rest of the wound closes like that?"
“I wanna help too—but we can’t just run out there and fight them!” Draco protested, watching helplessly as three of the snatchers used their wands to levitate the Hippogriff into the air.
think! You’re getting together a group of
"Excellent, I'll break out the fine China then...." Draco muttered dryly, earning a sharp glare from both Harry and Ron. The blonde raised his hands in defense and strode back ahead of them to the kitchen—leaving Harry to talk to the two.
“The bloody hell was that for?!” Draco intoned indignantly, sending the Italian a seething glare.
“Haha, I love you too.....”
“I said I was sorry~” Harry pouted with a put out look.
“Alright! That’s enough you two!” Kingsley stood suddenly, his deep voice booming as he silenced the two. “You’re both acting like children, now stop it!”
“...He left...”
“No, not—,” Draco was shaking his head but paused suddenly, cocking his head with a puzzled expression. “Actually, I did get hit.
" He replied stiffly, shooting the offending blonde a glare that told him to shut up.
. After the war was over, there were months and months of time where people were trying to clean up the damages left behind in the aftermath of the war. Even after the physical world was fixed though, many were still broken in spirit and heart.” He paused, frowning deeply.
The snatcher watched Draco tend to the unconscious Harry with a great deal of fascination and amusement.
Harry watched the interaction with no small amount of utter mortification, but he couldn’t bring himself to say anything to try and remedy the situation.
“Do you both swear that Auror Knightly has trained you to the best of his potential, to become fully functioning members of the Department of Aurors?”
One of the nurses nodded and immediately swept through the doors, white robes billowing behind him in his haste.
Draco made a noise of protest at his apparent description, but Blaise shushed him before he could get a word in.
...?”
“Little Draco Malfoy, is it? You were about the last person that I expected to show up here. How’s your father doing?”
Now that it was close enough, Harry could finally read the neat lettering
“Fine. My evening depends on it then.”
?” Harry prompted, again glancing around at their surroundings. “If it doesn’t have anything to do with where to go or how to track these snatchers, then you’re wasting our time, Malfoy.”
Draco caught the flush that rose to his cheeks and rolled his eyes to cover for it. “Oh please—bugger off you prat. Just because I’m gay doesn’t mean that every man is out to get me.”
Draco shifted on the couch and shrugged his shoulders somewhat uncomfortably. “Something different?” He offered with another shrug, reaching the remote up and turning the Television on.
Draco sighed again and pinched the bridge of his nose.
Kingsley frowned slightly. “I asked if you’re feeling alright. You look pale—do you feel nauseous or anything?”
“Ah, so you were found by somebody!” Blaise picked up keenly.
Harry relaxed into a smile at the sight of his lover looking much more relaxed than he had been earlier.
Blackwell took the jar with a nod, moving over toward Draco's bedside as Davies moved to Harry's.
“Well...” Harry glanced over at Ron and Hermione before Blaise spluttered in protest.
Davies glanced over at Draco, and Harry followed suit.
Harry gazed worriedly at Hermione and Ron as they traded suspicious glances. He wondered if he should intervene, but before he could open his mouth, Blaise had already risen from his seat and strolled around the table to greet the new faces.
He paused and Draco continued where he left off with a roll of his eyes. “Since we were the only two present when those...
"A-Alright. Ronald, we should at least hear him out....."
it..,” Harry grumbled evasively.
“Can I take it from your reaction that you’re the lucky man?” The Slytherin turned to Ron with a widening grin.
Pansy snickered and rolled her eyes slightly. “Well, kind of. It’s not exactly that simple...”
"There's a chance that that dark magic is somehow affecting both of their bodies at the same time," Davies finished with a nod.
Harry grit his teeth. “I don’t need proof. I’m a certified Auror, and if I report you to the Ministry—,”
He reclined into a large armchair and motioned for the two to sit across from him in the large sofa there. Harry sank down silently into the far right cushion, huffing slightly and shooting Draco a suspicious look as he did so. Draco returned the look with a slight roll of his eyes, choosing to perch against the left arm of the couch instead.
Harry nodded his head and turned back to the pair to pass on the message—just as Blaise strolled back to the table, returning to his seat next to Draco.
“That’s what
got hit, actually.”
“Harry, it’s so nice to see you,” Hermione greeted warmly, stepping forwards to give him her customary greeting hug.
“Excellent, now Florence—if you would.”
Draco nodded. “Yeah...When Harry’s chest got slashed, I was afraid he’d lose too much blood, so I started trying to use healing spells on him...I let my guard down and we both got hit by some kind of spell.”
“But what about
“...-otter..”
"And as for the reason why it's
“Draco, stop,” Harry murmured as he took his seat back at the table next to the blonde.
“I don’t see any physical signs of injury, but Malfoy’s vitals are dropping—fast! We need to get him on that stabilizing potion and then send him to get a full-body scan to check for signs of internal injuries and traces of dark magic—immediately.”
“You didn’t notice anything happen?” Kingsley pressed, his brow furrowing.
Harry sighed and looked the garment over. As his lover had boasted, the jumper seemed to be of very high quality—the fabric felt soft against his fingers and it looked incredibly warm.
that happened over the course of the time we started working together at the Ministry, up until when we first started dating...”
“Fine,” Harry scowled , snatching the quill from Kingsley and jotting down his request on the open line.
“Good, good.” Kingsley nodded, retrieving the quill from Harry’s hand and then gesturing Draco forward.
"Don't worry Weasley, only every ni—"
“I’m afraid not, Potter. Your new Auror partner
“Why don’t you ask him yourself?”
, because I live here." Drawled the calm and cool voice of Draco as he strolled out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on a towel that he had slung over his shoulder.
“Um, when do we leave?”
While the three Gryffindor’s gaped, Blaise merely snickered and moved around the table to where the coffee cups had been placed. “Now now—this can’t be helped. Potter’s not used to being hit on, and Draco’s never had anyone he needed to be jealous of, so of course you’re both going to have opposing opinions on the matter~”
The four remaining members of the party all shared an equal shudder at the poetically cheesy lines that he delivered with a straight face.
"Well fine then. As long as you swear that you've change for the better and aren't pretending—I guess I'll have to be fine with my best mate shacking up with a weasel." The redhead lamented with a sigh, standing up and pulling Hermione up with him.
“Harry Potter—the boy wonder and savior of the Wizarding World...Well color me surprised...”
“Potter, stop it.” Draco grunted painfully as Harry redoubled his efforts to free himself from Draco’s hold. “We can’t take them on our own—we’ll retreat and then call the Ministry for back up!”
The reason for this lover's spat in the early afternoon of a perfectly nice Saturday, was concerning that of the matter of Harry wanting to finally come out with their relationship to their friends—starting, he suggested, with Ron and Hermione.
Her face erupted into a blush, but Harry was sure that hers was no match for his. He was blushing so much he felt his ears burning.
“I s’pose it’s ‘bout time we head on back to the Ministry—Minister Kingsley’s gonna wanna full report on this by the end of the day, so we best skedaddle!”
Harry threw a glare at the back off the blonde’s head before looking around and surveying their location. Minutes passed and Draco still hadn’t stopped pacing.
“Ah, good question.” Florence pulled an ornate pocket watch out of the confines of his robes and turned his head sideways to read it.
“Prig...,” The blonde shot back, still scowling at the leering smirk pasted on the Italian’s face.
“So? What’ll it be?”
... Draco immediately quirked a brow. Though Harry didn’t look it, his forearms felt oddly firm and muscular.
“Well...what sort of things usually get put on these contracts?” Harry asked interestedly.
Harry exchanged slightly worried glances with Draco, wondering if he should ask just what it was that they were talking about—but Pansy suddenly cut in before he could get a word out.
“It will no longer be possible, because Auror Knightly has given you a recommendation to be accepted into the department as a full fledged Auror—meaning that you will no longer require the assistance of a mentor,” Kingsley explained slowly, his mouth breaking out into a grin at the end. “Surprised?”
Harry glanced up after having his name called and quickly stood, bowing his head slightly toward the older wizard.
“Well...not that I’m any sort of expert that knows
Harry shied away from the pointed look directed his way.
"Oh, better yet! Give me that black Muggle box thing." Draco took no note of his lover's interjection and continued talking—mischievous excitement heavily laden in his voice.
He sealed the promise with a dip of his head forwards—capturing the blonde's pouty lips in his own, and ravishing them tenderly.
Bloody hell, Hermione, so much has happened, and it has me all twisted up. Basically, Draco admitted to me that Snape is the one who bonded us. He did it to keep Draco safe, Voldemort was going to force him to take the mark when he returned home from Hogwarts, and Snape knew he wasn’t ready and somehow rationalized he would be safest with me. I don’t know where that man gets his logic from, or perhaps he just wanted to play a sick joke on me. Of course, it backfired because we’re friends now, Draco and I, and honestly, wouldn’t it have been punishing Draco to bond him to me all summer? I mean he did know how much the two of us have been at each other’s throats the last five years, hell anyone with eyes would have. I don’t know. The point is that, Snape put a limit to the bond, and it will wear off by the time we’re all on the train back to Hogwarts so you can stop making yourself barmy trying to research it all.
Harry could hardly believe the turn of events and couldn’t find it in himself in that moment to stress about their relationship. It was done, there was no going back now, and he definitely couldn’t be bothered to care as Draco parted his soft lips and tongues collided.
They’d always been touchy; Harry was an affectionate person. It had taken a while for Draco to get used to, and it seemed that Harry was the only person the blonde seemed to tolerate physical affection from.
Draco was the first one to speak after the laughter had subsided. “I think I might need some time Harry,” and it wasn’t lost on either of them that he had used his actual first name.
. Touring back through all their favorite hideaways that summer and finding their way back to their tunnel for the first time,
Let me know what you think!! <3
The more I write the more I realize how close we are to the end of this fic. It's bitter sweet for me, this is the longest thing I've ever written which is exciting but I will be sad when it's over! :)
“Harry,” he bit out in as much of a whisper as he could. “Harry, I’m…fuck…”
“I just wanted to make sure you’d made it back; we’ll catch up in the dorms yeah?”
Before he could even process the very profound decision he’d just made, he heard the familiar click of the door and tensed as he sat back up and jerked his head in the direction of the sound. Wide-eyed he watched as Harry slid through the door, not yet aware that he was being watched by Draco.
They were yanked by the feeling of someone having apparated into 4 Privet Drive. Harry let out a groan, pulling back only slightly from Draco and running a hand over his face.
Draco did as he was told without comment, relishing only slightly in the fact that the other boy had actually spoken to him for the first time since they’d discovered their predicament. Draco pushed his trunk into the room and nudged it into the corner nearest the window and preceded to use it as a seat as to avoid any further awkward standing. Draco felt cross with himself, it seemed that here in this space that was wholly Potter’s he didn’t know how to behave. He felt foreign among what few things it seemed Potter possessed, and therefore didn’t know how to act, his Whitty sarcasm failing him miserably and dying on his tongue. Though Draco also regrettably tried not to remind himself that it wasn’t just being in an unfamiliar place that was making it difficult to know how to act around his former nemesis, desperately shoving the tortured thoughts and revelations from the start of turn to the deepest recesses of his mind. Draco pulled himself from those thoughts and mused that it appeared that if they were both to survive this summer they would have to stick together if Harry’s uncle was anything to go on, and while Draco was good at being alone especially with his thoughts, he considered that having someone to talk to at least every once in a while, would make the experience more bearable.
“Of course, he did, how very Harry,” she spat out in a huff.
They pulled away at the same time, but only with one purpose in mind. On pure instinct alone Draco ran his hands down the brunette’s face, fingers grazing the corners of his lips, and then tugged him forward. Harry eagerly obliged him, and their lips met and both boys let out unabashed moans and tongues collided.
Harry thought to himself that Malfoy looked so timidly ardent in his statement making him feel an overwhelming fondness for the other boy in that moment.
Old habits die hard Harry thought to himself as he gave a quick glance over towards Malfoy tucked into one of the over-stuffed armchairs in the corner of the eighth-year common room. Not that Harry really cared about his old habits. Since the war he had learned to be more accepting of himself, he was now more than ever only human. He reasoned with himself, that if he liked to glance over at Malfoy every now and then that there was really nothing wrong with that.
His statement shut the other boy up entirely, and Harry noted that this tactic had employed the desired response and tucked it away for later.
Their foreheads had naturally shifted to rest against one another’s and they’d unconsciously begun to whisper, and Draco felt like it was the truest depiction of their relationship thus far. Somehow, they always gravitated towards one another and couldn’t help but live in another reality when together.
“I needed that to get through the day,” Harry said with the most rogue smile. All Draco could do was laugh, knowing full well that he would need it to get through the day far more than Potter.
He could feel his body begin to shake losing his resolve to hold back, every fiber of his being scorching where their bodies pressed together with a deep longing for more. Draco was almost positive that Potter’s reaction was due to the bond wholly, and Draco would be damned if he would get to be the only one to make a decision that could be blamed on the bond entirely when they both snapped out of it.
It’s not like he’d really had much time to consider, his interactions with girls were already limited, let alone his experience with blokes. However, if his ‘interaction’ with Draco had been anything to go on he already knew he ranked it higher than anything he’d experienced thus far.
Both boys looked on at their former professor with wide eyes, promptly dropping the other’s hand, which Harry wasn’t sure had gone unnoticed by Lupin who was now balancing his gaze back and forth between the two boys who were doing their absolute best to not appear guilty in any way.
“Lean back love,” Harry spoke leaning back up to face Draco.
“Honestly, after this conversation, I can see why he did. You seem to know Ron best, whether you’re willing to admit it or not. He and Harry are best mates sure, but breeching deeper topics seems to be something they aren’t as adept at as you are.”
Draco closed his eyes to steady himself, “I, I need to tell you something,” he eased it out in one breath only opening his eyes to gauge the other boy’s reaction before gaining the courage to continue. Harry’s face grew concerned, the half-smile hidden away, and Draco felt the loss painfully.
“It truly had more to do with me than with you, the taking so long bit I mean.”
“I don’t understand what the issue is, isn’t it a good thing you’ll come back with me?” Harry announced looking at Draco softly, “I mean you’ll be safe there with all of us, surely you can’t go home.”
He waited until she looked up at him, sure he had pulled her attention from the depths of her mind before continuing.
“Okay, that’s all… I’m ready now!” He finished with a smile.
Since the war and his return to Hogwarts, he found that he liked to spend his spare moments watching Potter. Well, not so much
As they walked in contented silence, Harry was taken aback with just how fond he found himself; he was smitten with the blonde. He hadn’t spent one moment that day without touching, or kissing, or staring at Draco. Hell, half of their walk Harry’d spent smiling to himself as he’d watch the blonde get lost in all the muggle things he’d never seen before. And sometimes the sun would catch him just right and reflect off his stark blonde hair and gray eyes, and Harry’s breath would catch in his throat.
Draco startled a little when Potter took it upon himself to bury his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, appearing to be almost breathing him in, and fuck if it wasn’t twisting up his insides again. Although, this twisting was due entirely to his own fond forlorn feelings for the brunette and he knew he couldn’t place the blame on the bond entirely.
Draco gave Potter what was easily becoming his signature earnest look before outstretching his hand, “I’m Draco.”
Malfoy gazed back at him eyes wide, “Sirius Black?”
It didn’t much matter anymore, Draco mused to himself the reality was that he knew Granger was still writing letters to Harry with theories and possible remedies and experiments to try in reference to their bond. He also knew that by summers end the bond would dissipate itself and all would be normal once more, or he knew his godfather had relayed that much. He began to feel unbearably sick to his stomach at the thought, he was terrified of the notion that once the bond had diminished and they had returned to Hogwarts Harry would return to his normal routine of despising him.
I think after this chapter there will only be one more, maybe two just depending on how it ends up laying out! The point, is that we are definitely at an end!
(See the end of the chapter for
He could feel that his eyes were wide, but it was difficult to harbor his nerves due to the volume and excitement that filled the room around him. He’d almost forgotten that Mrs. Weasley was still latched on to his arm, it gave him a sense of comfort as he zeroed into her insistence that professor Lupin stay for dinner.
The brunette groaned and nuzzled further into the blonde which had really not been a part of his plan. Either way, he trailed his hand through Harry’s very messy sleep ridden hair and across his soft cheek. He’d never get over how incredibly gorgeous the git was it made him smile a little to himself.
“With us you mean?”
“I picked the wrong side…I did things,” Draco faltered and peered into his lap.
I hope everyone enjoys this chapter, and as always your love and comments are loved and appreciated! They truly get me through the long weeks at work! <3
They both let out a laugh at that, “They’re lucky to have you I know you look after them, Harry’s convinced he wouldn’t have even made it through to sixth year without you, and honestly I’m keen to believe him.”
Draco had been reeling all day long, lost deep within the recesses of his brooding mind. Technically, it was the end of summer, so he wasn’t breaking any of the rules he mused petulantly to himself. He’d shrugged off the Weasley clan who were somewhere outside playing another round of Quidditch, how they never seemed to tire of it was beyond him. Though, at this particular moment he couldn’t muster up enough space in his mind to give it any real thought.
“Remember what Dumbledore said that day, in the hospital wing before we left on the Hogwarts Express,” Potter spoke, still not looking at him, though if he had he would have seen the puzzled expression that graced his features, because Draco reasoned to himself that Dumbledore had said many things that day in the hospital wing, and why couldn’t Potter be a little more specific?
Harry pulled him in for a hungry kiss, “I’ve never slept so well” he pulled back and stated earnestly.
As Draco looked out the window, he surmised from the purplish blue hews of the sky that they had probably missed dinner, not that the Dursley’s probably missed the two of them, mind not having them to use as house elves. “You think they left us anything, or are we going to have to fast instead of dinner tonight?” Draco asked with a nudge to Harry’s arm and a gesture towards the window. “Ha, they’re probably hoping we got hit by a car and they’re rid of us for good. Don’t worry though, I’ve got a stash from Honey Duke’s hidden up in my room, probably better than my aunt’s cooking anyways,” Harry replied with a nudge and half-smile of his own.
“Happy Birthday Harry,” he said with a whisper trailing his fingers down the brunette’s bronze cheek, causing the other boy to shiver, and his lips to part.
His eyes had been locked to Harry’s the entire time, and even when he’d wanted to look away in embarrassment, he’d forced himself to stay.
The group had formed an obstruction to the entrance of the alley, shielding both boys from sight which in hindsight Harry was incredibly grateful for.
Draco let out another laugh and addressed Fred, “you’re not joking they’re insane, but very entertaining.”
“Fuck, you’re amazing,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. He smiled when the other boy let out a small laugh and pulled back to look at him, and Harry knew that Draco understood.
Draco was keening now, practically sobbing above him and it made Harry mad. He moaned unabashed around the blonde’s cock, his own prick straining against the flies of his jeans.
The two boys walked in silence for a few beats before Potter turned to him, putting his arm out to grasp Draco by the shoulder, heat pulsating where he touched him, and turn him to face him head on.
He was rewarded with an unabashed moan and glanced up only to be graced with the presence of Draco; head thrown back, eyes squeezed shut, breath ragged.
The thought gave him a little bit of confidence, and at least the motivation to surge ahead.
Draco had been caught locking eyes with Potter, more frequently as of late. He also found that he caught himself seeking Potter out more often than he cared to admit. Which meant spending a lot of time tucked away in his corner of the common room. He couldn’t fully understand what he had done to earn the lazy smile of boy wonder, it made him feel overwhelmed, but in a way that had him craving the interaction habitually. Of course, it typically ended with Potter’s reddened cheeks and bright eyes casting downwards and Draco feeling so inundated with foreign feelings that he had to retreat back up to his room out of breath.
Draco watched Harry slide the door open just a sliver, and the stark black hair and dark eyes of Pansy Parkinson appeared. He noticed her expression go from slightly alarmed, probably in regard to Harry’s proximity to Draco, to completely blank.
Draco felt himself begin to blush and heat up but being so near Potter made it impossible to push the onslaught of imagery back where it belonged; in the deep down far away caverns of his soul. He also tried not to dwell too much on the fact that the other boy had spoken his actual name, had let it fall from his plump red gorgeous lips. He knew for Potter, that everything he was feeling, it was the bond, and not years of pent up feelings of fondness projected out as hatred because he was too afraid to admit to himself what the fondness truly meant. Therefore, Draco felt torn in many different directions; on one hand he wanted to give in to the bond and just let himself enjoy how good it felt to touch and be near the person he was bonded to, and on the other hand he didn’t want to set himself up for even more torment than he was already due when he eventually returned home. For all he knew, Potter could take this entire summer back to Gryffindor tower when they returned back to Hogwarts and everyone would know he was fucking gay as hell, and to top it all off, gay as hell for the supposed savior.
Draco smiled at them both and allowed himself to be pulled into one final hug from Mrs. Weasley before turning back to meet up with Harry at one of the entrances to the train. He noted internally that he could still feel the pulsating ache of the bond and let himself feel a small sense of relief.
Malfoy’s change didn’t really surprise him, it didn’t really seem to surprise anyone actually, not that anyone else seemed to notice Malfoy the way he did. At least Hermione had mentioned as much when he brought up the subject a few weeks into the start of term.
Draco felt his face heat even more as he watched her let out a curt laugh and pat him on the shoulder. “Please, call me Molly, dear.” And without another word she led him into the house with her hand tucked up under his arm. He knew despite her acknowledgment he would always refer to her as Mrs. Weasley until the end of time, as she was truly someone to be revered in all the kindest ways.
They eyed each other for a moment, Draco weighing the advice in his mind before Harry used the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck for leverage to tilt his head back leaving his mouth agape for a scorching kiss. He let his eyes flutter closed as Harry ravished his lips, and he was powerless against his ministrations. Draco let an arm snake up the back of Harry’s shirt, and the other tangle in his messy locks and pulled him in as close as their bodies would allow.
Draco pulled away first, softly, wanting to test the waters a bit more his devious mind having previously already been set on the goal of making Harry feel good on his birthday.
But it did end, as all good things do eventually. Both boys broke apart only a fraction breathing heavily, trying to catch their breath. When their eyes met again for the first time, they couldn’t help but to grin widely and burst into a bout of laughter. Draco knew they were both laughing at the audacity of it all, the fact that it was them; Draco Malfoy former death eater, and Harry Potter savior of the wizarding world. The fact that it was them; Malfoy and Potter arch-nemesis’ established 1991 in Madam Malkin’s Robes for all Occasions. The fact that it was them; Harry and Draco friends that engage in prolonged gazing that ultimately leads to snogging.
...if it is your thing, Happy Birthday! LOL :)
So, Draco spoke, and he spoke without thinking, “I’m jealous of you, always have been.” Draco looked up at Potter and surged on, afraid that if the other boy spoke, he might lose his nerve. “Yeah, I know I’m fucking amazing and all, how could I, Draco Malfoy ever be jealous of the great and arrogant Harry Potter?” Harry interrupted, “Oh, and I’m the arrogant one, listen to you,” he stated with a hint of biting sarcasm in his tone. Draco lifted the corner of his lips, and sheepishly looked down to his lap before continuing more softly, “look Potter, you are a lot of things I’m not. I know I sound daft as hell, but I’ve lived this sheltered and controlled life. I look at you, and you are just so freely yourself, and people love you for it.” Draco wanted to finish with, ‘and I love you for it,’ but quickly surged on. “I just, I guess, I guess things are different now. This year has been shit, and I’ve just been trying to sort through it all without losing my damn head, and it’s made me different, I don’t know.” Draco trailed off a little, unsure if he should continue, but reasoning that he had already said far more than he should have on night one of their forced sleep over he surged on, “I just, I’ve seen and done so many awful things none of it seems worth it anymore,” he gestured between the two of them to insinuate their ongoing feud.
“Oh, very pleased Malfoy,” Harry replied as he leaned forward hands bracing on the counter to kiss a sliver of exposed skin just under Draco’s navel.
Though, hate was not a word Harry would use to describe his feelings towards Malfoy anymore. The war had changed everyone, in different ways of course. Harry knew that this new Malfoy was just another after effect of the war though, to be fair it was an after effect he didn’t mind. And watching him,
For the first time since they’d found themselves in the predicament of sharing Harry’s tiny cot for a bed, they’d slept apart from one another. Draco rolled onto his back letting himself get lost in the intricate lines along the ceiling, and the gentle creases of his mind. The two boys had always found a way to touch each other in the night, at first delicately, timidly, almost accidentally. But as time wore on the touches were bold, heady, and assuredly on purpose. Therefore, spending the night as though an invisible wall had materialized between them and barred them from reaching out felt like excruciating torture to Draco; he’d barely slept a wink.
Before Professor Lupin could even respond to the woman’s offer for dinner, she was halfway out the door, yanking Harry into a hug.
Of course, I have to mention books in some capacity. If you've read my first fic
“Mind if I join you?”
“I dream about Sirius,” Harry spoke faintly looking up and locking eyes with Malfoy’s intently and with purpose.
“Ha! You can’t fool me slag, I know you’re not allowed to use that thing outside of school,” Dudley spat at Draco with a nod towards his wand. “This is what you get for calling me a fag the other day, fuck you, you fucking queers,” he spat more venomously this time.
Boldly, as if it were anyone else, and not Potter, he turned to the brunette and with a nod of his head towards the front door stated, “we should go, yeah?”
Of course, being someone who before that moment couldn’t really fathom reading for pleasure had him skeptical at first, but one glance up at Malfoy was all the encouragement he needed. Malfoy had his knees pulled up to his chest with his book nestled between his chest and his knees, lip pulled between his teeth, and his brows knitted together in concentration. Harry glanced down at his book and smiled a little to himself, before he pulled it open and began to immerse himself into the escape Malfoy had chosen for him.
Both boys spent the rest of the morning wrapped in one another, rolling around in Draco’s bed, teasing each other and laughing. Whispering into the fresh hours of dawn in debate over who had realized they loved the other first, and who hid it better. They shared their aching feelings about the book and what it made them realize about themselves and about each other, and vowed to never forget about summers in Italy, Monet’s beam, and how they were both Elio but to Draco, Harry would always be his Oliver.
Harry didn’t have it in him to brood over someone who was making such a big deal over his birthday, or over someone who was as particularly apt at kissing as Draco was. He knew what he felt for the blonde was real, he knew it was strong, he knew it went far beyond what the bond generated between the two of them, he just wasn’t keen to face it yet, and if he was being honest with himself he hadn’t been keen to face it all summer and summer was dwindling.
All of the Dursley’s eyes were wide and, on the blonde, now especially Vernon’s. Well, as wide as his fat face would allow.
“Alright, time to stop thinking,” he whispered back as he reached out for the other boy.
After what felt like hours of the two boys getting lost in each other, Potter pulled back, eyes glazed over, lips red and so full, and cheeks flushed. Draco bit his bottom lip as he gazed down at the other boy, nervous, afraid to speak in fear that it would shatter everything.
Harry, someone who had never read a book for pleasure in his entire life found it hard to empathize with the Draco. Although, Harry, someone who had spent way too much agonizing time alone in his own head could do more than empathize with him. He didn’t see why they couldn’t get on one of the buses into town, surely there was a book store of some sort there. As he verbalized this to Draco, he was met with a genuine grin, the kind that reached his eyes and found that it was entirely contagious, but his brain didn’t linger on that.
Hermione let out a huff, “Not you idiots, honestly, Harry, I meant Harry.”
“Harry...” the brunette popped his eyes open at the sound of his name, gazing at Draco lazily a half-smiled tugged in the corner of his soft lips.
Potter was right there with Draco the entire time, he met his level of passion touch for touch, groan for sigh, and with the same sense of urgency. Draco couldn’t let himself snap out of it, couldn’t allow himself to let go of the moment, he’d rather die there than be yanked from the fantasy; there was no way that this could truly be happening.
And it was Harry’s turn to blush madly. He backed away, holding Draco out at arm’s length looking sheepish.
Harry’d also taken note of Malfoy’s new sense of style. It seemed very out of character, but not necessarily in a bad way. This new wardrobe was a stark contrast to the slim lines and dark contours of Malfoy’s previous posh attire. It made Malfoy seem comfortable, almost approachable which is not a way Harry ever thought he would describe a person he used to think he hated.
“I’m your best mate, you’re saying I don’t get you?”
“Yeah, you know…feel it out. Just get on the train and take things as they come?”
Draco descended on the other boy’s nipple then, sucking and lapping at it with his tongue, nipping and pulling on it with his teeth. He got lost in the gasps, and groans, and heavy breathing coming from Harry letting them wrap around him and push his inhibitions, and his fears aside.
Harry opened his eyes, but before he could fasten a response to Hermione’s question, it seemed the two adult men arguing at the foot of his bed suddenly realized that he was awake. Dumbledore was the first to take notice, and with a pointed look at Snape, turned his full attention on Harry and was the first to break the silence. “Harry, how are you feeling, you took quite a fall.” Harry looked up at the headmaster unsure of how to answer, seeing as he couldn’t seem to fully remember what had happened in the first place. “I mean, I guess I’m alright. I don’t really remember what happened though professor,” Harry stated with a glance over at Snape in confusion.
Snape gave Draco a long look, a look Harry couldn’t quite interpret before completely ignoring Harry altogether and following Dumbledore out of the room.
Draco turned his neck so he could look at Harry and watched as he ran a hand over his face hastily as Draco had done a billion times that morning.
He knew deep down that Snape’s efforts had not been meaningless, and he would be a stupid git to believe that Severus had only been trying to buy Draco more time. He knew his time was up at the end of this summer, and his options were clear; take the dark mark or join Potter and his army of Gryffindor’s.
When they were lurched back into reality Draco felt shaken from much more than just the apparation. Standing in front of ‘The Burrow’ as everyone seemed to call it, Draco felt his stomach begin to lurch.
“The explanation of why, is not one I feel I can give Harry, however, the how is simple. A magical bond has been cast on you and young Mr. Malfoy. Essentially, the two of you will find that you are unable to be more than a few feet apart from one another without suffering a great amount of physical and sometimes even mental pain. As all magical bonds are extremely strong and typically incredibly intricate, we have found that at this time we are unable to sever it. In due course, I am positive that the bond will sever itself when the timing is right, as this has been my experience with these matters.” Dumbledore spoke plainly, and calmly as if he were giving his annual start of term speech, and not as if he were explaining to Harry that he was now bound until further notice to his arch enemy.
“Oh Draco for merlin’s sake, don’t look at me like that.”
More angsty dread...
“You’re different, you seem less, less… less, you? I guess.” Harry finished almost with a wince, like he couldn’t form the words to accurately convey his thoughts on the matter. Draco outwardly rolled his eyes but retained his half-smile. “The eye rolling is a tad more Malfoy,” Potter added with his own teasing eye roll.
blanket.
Harry and Draco sat there leaning forward, hands clasped in their solid handshake, staring at one another for a few more moments before slowly slacking their grip and letting go. Before he could even think about it Draco spoke, “well if that’s what a handshake feels like I can hardly imagine what spooning you in that infinitesimal cot will be like,” finishing with a breath. After the words left his mouth, he felt mortified, what the hell was wrong with him, he’d only just turned over a new leaf with boy wonder and he was already mucking it up. Before he could spend too much time dwelling on his mis-step he heard Harry let out a deep and almost guttural laugh.
Potter graced him with a signature half-smile as green met gray again, and Draco almost signed in relief. Potter’s hands skirted down to rest on Draco’s hips as Draco braced his hands against the wall on either side of Potter’s head, still too nervous to speak but he knew his face was giving away how happy he felt and with that he could feel the red blush begin to creep over his cheeks and he let his head hang down between his shoulders too self-conscious to continue to meet the other boy’s eyes.
“Please let me return the favor,” he let out in a breathy whisper against Draco’s ear.
Draco tried not to, but he just couldn’t help himself, he was only human after all wizard or not, he couldn’t help but notice how green Potter’s eyes were, how funny he could be, how his laugh sounded. Each time he caught himself, he shuddered and tried to push the thoughts back, if he could he would light a match and engulf them all to hell, but it he knew it was truly no use and no matter how many times he pushed them away, eventually he would be forced to face them as he had been first term of last year at Hogwarts.
“Right,” Harry responded back with a curt nod of his head holding back a laugh at himself before taking the letter and overfilling Hedwig’s food dish. “I’ll just leave you to it then,” he murmured and retreated back to bed letter in hand.
Before he could even reason with breaking the silence stretching between them, Harry moved. He reached across the chasm for Draco, and curled into him wrapping his limbs around him in such a way that all Draco could do was bury his face in the other boy’s bronze neck and breath him in. They both reacted to one another as if they’d been starved for ages without the other’s touch, and Draco drank it all in.
,” he spoke aloud to the other boy for the first time since their game of touches began. He could feel his own cheeks heat at his brash honesty and leaned his forehead against Harry’s for balance. Harry reached up and clasped Draco’s face in his hands as well, and there they were two boys completely gone for one another grasping each other’s faces in their hands just trying to hold on.
Draco knew the feelings he felt for Potter went beyond that of a friend, even if he wasn’t willing to fully admit it to himself yet. However, his feelings were beginning to become so overwhelming and consuming that he felt sure he might suffocate from the crushing weight of his own turmoil. The truth was that Draco didn’t really know how he felt about the idea of fancying another bloke. It’s not as if Potter were the first, of course he knew he just hadn’t been faced with the idea full force and at such high velocity. Draco thought he might like the idea of escaping into a place where he could freely try on the idea without the weight of his own heart. Looking at the situation through the eyes of someone else became the only reasonable solution to his Potter problem, and so he knew it was time to add a new escape to his collection.
Draco lulled his head to the side, opening his eyes slowly to peer up at him, and all Harry could do was smile dopily at him.
,” pulled from him as his orgasm hit him intensely.
“Trust me, there is no way I’ll be able to survive without another one of those,” Harry responded unable to contain the full-on grin at the thought.
Before Draco could think about how much time had passed since they had been standing there staring at one another, or how long this inner dialogue he’d been having with himself had persisted Potter had taken two steps forward and reached his palm up to Draco’s face. Their noses a mere centimeter apart, and Potter was looking at him, really looking, a question in his eyes. Draco thought to himself that the other boy looked so earnest, and it made Draco feel brave, brave enough to lift his own palm to Harry’s face and return his deep gaze for only a moment longer before eliminating the centimeter and placing his lips on Harry’s with a groan.
