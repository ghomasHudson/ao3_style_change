The sudden mention of war leaves Draco cold and shivering. All the memories come rushing back and it took a great amount of self control for Draco to not let it show on his face – the vulnerability, the pain, the guilt and the aftermath of it all. The nightmares never left him. They still haunt him and he knows they will continue to do so for a long time. The screams and cries of people; the flash of green of the killing curse; the scorching heat from the fiend fire; all of it still wakes him up screaming and sweating in his bed. The war may be over outside but it is still very much going on within him.
Another sound of twig breaking and suddenly the already chilling forest turns chillier, if that was even possible. And from a thick band of trees emerges a figure, dark and hooded and Draco is pretty sure he would have missed it if not for the red eyes trained straight at him and the white of fangs visible just beneath the creature’s lips.
Hii...umm idek where to start from. Probably from praying that you all are safe. Please, be safe and healthy.
He didn't want to do it. However, when the creative head had shown him the amount of fanmails they received requesting for the spin off of this particular couple; Harry had felt obliged and mostly touched. He had agreed a week later to write this spin off.
“My father and Sirius talked about Remus and how to be there for him a lot in the letters they exchanged over summers.”
Once inside, not knowing what to do Draco just stands there in complete silence. Potter is not doing great either if his fidgeting and occasional scuffs of shoes over the carpet are any indication.
“Couldn’t take a break for even one whole day. Could you, Malfoy?” There is fake defeat in her voice as the smile on her face does nothing to hide the fondness.
He had called Malfoy’s name repeatedly while cradling his head in his lap. His body embracing the cold one of the blonde male protectively as Ron and other aurors had gathered around them.
Harry is a writer and publishes books under the pseudonym Daniel Radcliffe. His last 3 books have been international best sellers and everybody wanted to see the writer in public but Harry refused.
“What kind of books have you been reading? There is no bond between us, Potter. Contrary to what you might believe or know, a bond requires two willing parties. Both the people involved need to be aware of the bond taking place within them. That’s why its effects are so strong and visible. A marking, however, works differently and is exclusive to only non humans. But in that too an animagus marking is something that is never heard of which is why I wanted to know about your animagus form more. To figure out what is that I am dealing with.” Draco eyes Potter meaningfully before spitting “So if you don’t mind please get on with it.” The ‘please’ is said in a very disdainful voice that has Potter wincing but Draco does not care. If Potter is gonna behave like a prat so will he.
“Excuse Me.” Harry is aware of the similar muggle phrase but is absolutely sure that that was not what Malfoy meant. “You talk as if the house is a sentient being.” Harry settles at saying out loud only his last thought. He was expecting a lot of things but not this - Malfoy telling him his house just welcomed the blonde male; when even Harry does not feel welcomed in it some days.
In the coming hours, harry might regret telling it to Draco Malfoy of all people. But right now, he is not gonna keep anything bottled up anymore. He will let lose everything. Maybe as his potential mate, Malfoy deserves to know all this.
“W-why”, Draco stands up to walk towards Potter who had stepped back into the middle of the room. They are just at arm’s length away so Draco stops, and with head held high and looking straight at those set of green eyes, asks what he had wanted to since that night in the forest.
A voice in the back of his head questions him and he shuts out that annoying voice almost immediately.
Harry does not want to go to this dance and make a fool out of himself. But as one of the participants of the tournament, he must. And really for one second he had the impulsive thought of going with ron but the idea makes him puke.
It is not easy to suddenly trust your childhood nemesis. To tell them things he has closely guarded all his life. To tell them things about him that only people extremely close to him knows.
When Malfoy just sighs in annoyance and does not say anything, only shaking his head in negation, Harry deems it as an acceptance to continue.
Harry stops when Malfoy looks at him wide eyed. He thought everybody knew about his godfather but maybe that's not the case.
The stormy grey eyes bores death glares on to his as pale deft hands clutches at the collar of his auror robes. Harry had expected a curse thrown at him. This is going well than he expected.
Draco feels it the moment Potter’s magic is rippled by outside. He is not sure if it is because of how strong the brunette’s magic is or because of the new status acquired between them. Draco is confused about which one to hope for. He does not have time to linger on that thought as he finds himself moving across the office to unlock the door with a carefree flick of his wand.
With another glutoral growl the wolf starts to circle the vampire wizard who is whipping around in frenzy clearly not expecting this confrontation. Draco is not sure if he should feel assured by the wolf protecting him from the vampire or should be worried about his fate at the hands of not one but now two creatures.
Ron was sure the healer was alright a second ago and then suddenly the monitors were beeping and healers were filling into the room pushing them outside.
He takes a step back quietly and it turns out to be the wrong move because the vampire is now much closer to him than he was a mere second ago.
Okay. I have given up on giving this story a fixed number of chapters. IDEK anymore how long this will be. I am so sorry yet again but here have this chapter as a thanks if you are still sticking by.
When Kreacher had left them alone and Harry had made sure he is not lingering just around the corner worshipping Malfoy with his sparkling eyes, he gives his full attention to Malfoy who seems to be staring right back at him. It unnerves Harry to say the least. So he does the only thing he can think of. He picks up his wine glass and sips through the burning trail it leaves through his inside.
"The last time I was here was when we hadn't even entered Hogwarts. Although I think I only visited twice but I remember this place more than I imagined. It has not changed much."
Thank you for all the love and support and sorry if you get confused by alternate povs. I tried to separate them as best as i could. Still if you are confused lemme know.
He doesn't know how to answer it in fact. Because there is no particular answer to it. He just can’t bear to be in a crowd. People suffocate him.
The first thing Draco notices as he lands on solid ground again is complete blackness. A kind of dread washes over him suddenly. At first he thinks it is his claustrophobic emotions emerging again but it takes him only a few seconds to realize that those are not his emotions. They are Potter's. Thinking of the person, Draco tries to adjust to the dark, which belatedly reminds him of a situation he found himself in weeks ago. But before he could dwell onto it, pain, like nothing he had ever felt before, rakes his entire body into a quivering mess. There are no sounds of breaking and mending of bones but it feels the same. As if his, not his but Potter's body, is broken and then mended back. That must be the case in fact. Potter did say it was the memory of his first transformation. But as far as Draco knows, animagus transformation is not supposed to hurt. Not if you are a bloody wolf too. Draco however cannot be too sure. There are no living records. Nothing to base this assumption on. An animagus wolf transformation is not like a cursed werewolf transformation that only happens on the night of a full moon. But if the pain that still runs through his mind as a dull ache - not his he reminds himself again - is to be considered, Potter's transformation was not a regular one. He fills this observation to the back of his mind to ask Potter later on and readies himself to face this unlikely situation head on.
“There was a time when I did not want to move from the bed. Eating, washing up, speaking, walking - all these mundane things felt like chores that my body and mind could just not do. Even Ron and Hermione were unable to get through me. It was just me and kreacher in Grimmauld place. I literally thought I would not wake up one day. It would have been something - the saviour dying in his sleep. No curse. No accident.”
Before he could do something completely regrettable like say something like ‘Don’t worry. You are safe now’, Kreacher comes to save the day.
But before the healer could walk away though, he turns to look at him square once again. His expression is still cold and menacing. And strangely it does something weird to Harry.
Harry knows Malfoy can see the challenge in his eyes but somehow manages to not rise to the bait. If anything, he feels a bit red in the face, maybe it is just the wine. Clearly, Harry is imagining things.
There is so much history between them two that Harry fears that will there ever be something peaceful between them.
Also my Instagram is gone (yeah I deleted it but if you wanna talk my twitter is a welcomed place. Link is in the note at the end.)
It is a common knowledge that Animagus have to be registered with the Ministry to avoid using their ability for illegal purposes. There have been records of unregistered animagus like Potter’s father and his friends. In Peter Pettigrew’s case especially, if they had known he was an animagus maybe things would have been different. After the war, the new ministry entrusted stricter laws, so anyone who had not registered prior to become an animagus was punishable to law and could serve years in Azkaban. This record is public. So, if Harry Potter had been a registered animagus, the whole wizarding world would have known. But since they don’t it only means he is unregistered. And Professor Mcgonagall knew. How did it happen? Did Potter use his saviour card to keep his status under wraps? Draco cannot help but snicker at the thought; so much for never using his fame and status for his own selfish motive.
The wolf, Draco is still in shock at its appearance out of nowhere, is growling like he is ready to peel the head off of the vampire.
Draco wants to bloody punch the other to get the words out of him. He is fisting his wand tightly in his right. His left hand is clutching the back of a chair in a death grip. He is sure he would be throwing punches if he does not busy his hands.
“Ronald, enough. Stop behaving like a child. We are no longer in Hogwarts. And since this is something that concerns Draco equally, it is only fair to tell him first.”
He was about ready to pack his bags and leave for France when he got an owl from his current boss, Healer Claire. She told him about an opening for an apprentice under her. She had seen his scores and he already took all the subjects necessary for a healer too as they were same as for potions so it all fit perfectly.
“Are you sure about what you said last time?” Harry gives up the stupid staring competition first and moves on to more important matters at hand.
Giving up on making any sense out of Potter's mood, Draco settles on the chair left to the head of the table. As potter takes his own seat on his right, all the while giving him a funny look, it finally dawned on Draco how bad of a decision it was to sit so close to Potter. Their legs are almost touching. Draco can feel Potter's body heat crashing over him from his toes up to his groin.
When Harry had owled Malfoy to meet, the other had replied almost instantly to floo to his office which was very convenient for him too. If, and to be honest it will surely happen so when, they both end up hexing each other then it will be highly fortunate to be just steps away from the Spell Damage ward to be able to get treated immediately.
The sudden contact sends sparks throughout his body and judging by how quickly Malfoy jerks his away and is looking at Harry wide eyed, he must have felt it too.
Harry is an orphan living with his aunt’s family. His parents died in a car accident and a very reluctant Petunia had to take him in when he was just a babe.
Sometimes harry is thankful of these detentions - away from the house and dudley for once even if he has to scrub dirty bathroom floors, nothing he ain’t doing back at home.
It has been more than an hour since Harry came back and he is still thinking about what Ginny had said.
“I am willing to put you out of your misery. Meet me outside ballroom sharp at 7. And don’t be late. And for god’s sake try and look presentable for once.”
He looks at the healer, who was already looking at him, quite intensely if he may so add. And Harry realizes that Malfoy’s eyes have a blue tinge added to its usual stormy grey. Were his eyes always the color of this? He never noticed and that must be something because Harry was obsessed with the blonde during their Hogwarts days. He would have noticed. Maybe it’s something adulthood has gifted him or maybe it is just a permanent reaction to always surrounded by infection and potion.
Potter goes silent again but this time Draco looks at him closely; notices the tension in his body, a grim expression on his face, his tightly fisted hands and something coils within him.
It’s hard to formulate the right words to ask the question. But if he delayed any more second, Draco thinks he might not be able to ask it or most probably Potter will leave before he gets the chance.
Draco is surprised - to say the least - by the proposal Potter just extended to him. He had never thought that a day like this would ever come when Potter willingly allows Draco in his head. However, there is a first time for all the things considering how he ended up at 12 Grimmauld place having dinner with the saviour of the wizarding world, who also happens to have marked on Draco in a weird turn of events.
He doesn't know. But also he is not completely unaware. He did talk to Professor Mcgonagall and Hermione, god bless his best friend, who had been so forward in helping him find out answers to his questions.
As Kreacher places the glasses on the table and fills them up with ruby red wine, Harry noticing offhandedly how the glasses are sparkly shining, Draco eyes him suspiciously and thanks Kreacher for his service. The said elf, for lack of a better word, glows up radically on getting praised by Malfoy - or probably it's the Black part of Malfoy that satisfies him. He appears far from his withered self though. It would be incorrect if Harry denied that he was not jealous of this whole ordeal.
What the hell is he even thinking? Harry questions himself in his head for a minute. And totally forgets that he is still standing in Malfoy’s office with his eyes closed and body tensed while a question is left hanging in the air between the two of them.
To top it off Draco is unable to look away from Potter. If what he experienced earlier was just a glimpse of power that resides within him then how in abundance it would be for him to be able to have an animagi form of such caliber.
Seeing the slightly constipated look on the other, Harry is sure Malfoy remembers that conversation very well too.
He hopes so because if it is anything else, Harry is unsure of how to react to that. He clears his throat to get Malfoy’s attention and the other whips around so quickly; though the look of surprise instantly morphs into one of annoyance. It is fascinating to see how Malfoy transitions into one emotion from another so fast. Maybe he had forgotten all together that Harry was here after his little chat with Padma, Harry thinks to himself.
Knowing the number of traps they both have literally walked into by now, they should have known. But this time again they are caught by surprise when they find themselves at wand point in the middle of a circle of snickering dark wizards.
He hates himself now though, seeing the state harry is in currently. Who could be this heartless to do this to him!!! His heart burns with something draco isn’t sure what to call but one thing he knows for sure is that he wants to hurt someone real bad.
Draco is relieved to finally be discharged. He has never liked being holed up in one room, lying in a bed with nothing better to do. If possible he would in fact like to start on his shift right away if Head Healer Claire will let him.
He had tried the good old way of paper and pen in hopes of getting something out, anything. But still no luck and it is starting to haunt him now.
It’s the same routine. Harry has to stay back for a detention, a detention he got because dudley locked him in the loo and by the time cleaning staff got him out he was already late for his class.
So, this took me so long. Honestly, this update is kinda unexpected. I had no intentions of writing this quick update. It just so happened.
The words are not said rudely but there is an edge to Malfoy’s voice which Harry does not quite know where to place. He has never been good at reading people. But with Malfoy, his senses have always been heightened. Malfoy is not showing everything he feels. He is masking something. His anger or vulnerability - Harry cannot tell which one exactly.
There is complete silence for a minute or so. Draco just waits patiently. He is not sure what he wants to hear or if he is ready for it even. He has an inkling though. Maybe a curse. It could not be a bite; he would have known then - not just as a healer in the hospital but it wouldn’t have been hidden from the press for long. And a bite in seventy percent cases does not transmit the lycanthropy and in the remaining cases only thirty percent gets the ability or curse - however one looks at it - to be able to shift.
“I will help you of course, Harry. But I think this time Draco is the one who could really help you more. Not just because he is in a way involved in it but he is a practiced Healer and I know his expertise is in creatures. So maybe he can answer your questions.”
He had a big argument with his Boss, the head of the publishing house who also had never met him. The only one who has met him personally is his manager, Ginny Weasley. A very smart and no-nonsense lady, who Harry admires a lot.
It is not entirely the truth and Harry would be damned to tell everything to Malfoy. He hopes he look and sound convincing enough for the other to not notice the waver in his voice.
Harry takes a deep breath, looks at the back of the person he never intended to have anything to do with ever; smiles a little at his crazy fate and launches into a tale of wolf - his wolf.
So, it's a wizard-vampire. Draco isn’t sure why he is noting down these details in his head when he will be the meal of the said creature in a while. Maybe it is just his healer’s side taking over.
Draco looks at Potter and realizes the other is looking back at him with a weird expression. And what is this? Is that a smile? Is potter smiling at him? His smile suddenly broadens into a grin and it confuses Draco until he realizes that he himself is smiling back at Potter.
Potter, however, does nothing of sorts. He actually does not even react. Just stares at Draco with a blank expression. It is quite unnerving for Draco to be scrutinized like this. Without being able to predict what exactly Potter is thinking about.
“Potter, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Technically you are not even obliged too.” Draco surprises even himself with his words. He is dying to know but from the way Potter sagged a little bit, it is clear as day how
Harry, being a painfully extremist anti-social person never steps out of his home more than twice a month. One is for his regular therapy session and another for a meet up with Ginny every 15th of a month.
“Dinner is ready.” Kreacher informs before disappearing with a pop. Since when did Malfoy become his Master too? Harry really needs to have a talk with Kreacher.
"No. I mean no there was no one else. He was practicing the dark arts and we still don't know how but he managed to create a spell to turn into a vampire. But his theory backfired. Vampires are dead creatures. He was not going to live longer anyhow. The fool not only killed himself but other innocent people too. Healer Claire was able to extract the reservoir magic he used to cast the spell from his wand. We also got his signature. We are tracking it. So in case someone else got their hands on this spell and tries to cast it we will be notified immediately."
“Oh.” Draco hears some rustling behind him and turns to find Potter has moved back to his book shelf and is actually going through one of his medicine books. What has gotten into this git, he wonders soundlessly.
He is aware of how much Malfoy wants to know the reason; can see it in his eyes, in his body language. The tension in his shoulders, the strength he is putting in fisting his palms. The way he is trying to busy himself by organizing the files on an already neat desk.
“Harry, are you ok?? You look distracted.” Ginny asks when Harry fails to react to her calls of his name for the third time.
“Remember, I can’t talk parseltongue anymore so you have to abandon your kinks and talk like a normal person.”
Honestly, Harry had imagined a lot more questions from Ron. But seeing the look of confusion mixed with something akin to disgust and maybe slight disappointment must have something to do with the absence of more questions.
Malfoy is full on grinning now. And Harry has the sudden urge to wipe that smug look off of his face with either a punch or a hex, he cannot decide.
The vague answer though does nothing to satisfy Draco's desire to get his answers. He had thought about it hard - why was he so intrigued by Potter's animagus form. At first he had thought about it being something he had to know as he was directly involved in it. Being marked by an animagus wolf and that too Potter was something Draco had not imagined even in his wildest dreams.
Draco doesn't know when he started screaming or crying but he feels the wetness on his face and to his shock finds himself crying uncontrollably. The only thing keeping him standing and not running away is the fact Harry's glasses are still in his hands. The glasses which he had recognised the moment he saw them abandoned outside the closet and it had irked him of something going horribly wrong. And he was not wrong.
Harry knows Draco is getting agitated. He is also aware of how he is trying to escape the blonde male’s gaze. There is nothing in the office that interests him, contrary to what Malfoy must be assuming. Nor is Harry trying to search for something. Yeah, if there was a secret passage out of here, he might have been tempted.
Harry is not sure himself. It was not something he planned. It just happened. Maybe decided by that part of him who took him as a mate as well? But before harry can linger more on that thought Ron is again saying something, rather loudly.
The spell, however, does not remain for long and dissipates quickly. How, though, nobody figures it out.
Harry fidgets on his spot as Malfoy’s unrelenting gaze pierces through him. After what feels like an hour but probably only minutes in reality, Malfoy finally steals his glance away and walks away to sit on his desk chair. His healer robes, which were carelessly hung at the back of the chair slips to the floor. Malfoy does not notice though. He appears to be staring blankly at his desk full of reports. Harry knows it is a lot to take in but still he never expected a reaction like this from the blonde male.
“I had no idea.” There is something in Malfoy’s voice which makes Harry turn sideways. Not being able to look at him head on. It's a mix of remorse and guilt and a lot other things that Harry does not want to deal with at the moment.
As his eyes linger on the clean empty white sheet of paper and the capped pen, he asks himself if it was the right decision.
It all happens in quick succession - a low dangerous growl, horror-stricken gasps, a flash of magic and then two ruby red spots in the pitch blackness of the surrounding just next to where he stands.
Desperately in need to dissipate this atmosphere and the awkward silence, Draco chances on talking about what they had actually met for today.
He wants to scream for help but all he can get out is some choked coughs mixed with sobs. His lungs are giving out and the pain is lulling him into a deep slumber. But the moment his eyes were about to drop close, the door to the closet creaks open and the light from hallways filters inside making him open his eyes in response. And the one he sees standing on the doorway is not who harry imagined to have been rescued by. He isn’t even sure if he is getting rescued or something worse is going to happen. And the moment the boy steps closer and crouches down, Harry loses it. Every emotion - anger, pain, betrayal - everything crashes on him at once and he lets out a blood curdling scream.
“What makes you think I marked you though? I never completely figured it out. Is it even possible for me to mark you? I don’t feel any different. I don’t feel any kind of bond towards you. Does that not say it might have been something else than marking.”
"Professor, Harry...he i-is….", that must be Granger, Draco thinks to himself. The wolf, Harry, Draco corrects himself, is just there in front of him and Weasley, Granger, and Professor are a metre behind him. All maintaining a safe distance and with an alert stance. Draco notices how Professor waves Weasley to lower his wand when the gingerhead aims it at the wolf, probably in defence in case the wolf attacks. Draco would have done the same thing, they have no idea if the beast will attack or not. If it still has Harry's memory or not. Werewolves, once transformed, do not retain the memories of their human self, so it cannot be said that the same will not be true for an animagus wolf.
"You do know I am part Black, right? I visited with mother when I was little. I never met Sirius or his brother but I remember Aunt Walburga. She had scared the shit out of me the first time I saw her. I would say Aunt Bella had nothing on that old hag." Even if Malfoy is joking about his deceased aunt, Harry can still hear the tremble in his voice on naming her. He hopes the reason has nothing to do with missing her. And now that Malfoy had mentioned it, he does remember that if Sirius had not left him to inherit the Black house it might have collectively belonged to the blonde and Teddy.
Harry knows he should stop speaking any further. Malfoy does not want to know about his life but something in him tells him to just say it. And the fact that Malfoy has not left or stopped him makes it even harder to stop.
Potter might be snickering now while reminiscing those terrible days of solitude and hurt. But Draco can still feel the wave of pain emitting from him. It is not so different than his own. He knows all about pain and solitude; feeling broken and betrayed; on giving up to never wake up again. He had his mother at least but Potter had no one except for an old bitter house elf for companionship. He is startled out of his thoughts by Potter moving closer to him, the latter is not looking at him though. It feels like he is lost in his own thoughts and is unaware of his surroundings. Draco cannot help but become conscious about the shortening distance between them.
Harry had thought about it a lot. After they had admitted Draco to St. Mungo's and other aurors were busy with investigating the vampire who was caught, Harry had nothing else to do. After giving a brief to Head Auror, Ron had surprisingly left Harry alone to himself. Maybe his friend was aware he needed time. Ron had no idea then. Harry is not sure even he had too. All Ron knew was Harry was able to get to the victim on time. That Harry had injured the vampire to almost death. That he had saved Draco Malfoy’s life. He knew Harry was exhausted just like him so he had left him alone. And all Harry had done was think about the incident again and again.
He is brought out of his thoughts by a ting of his phone signalling a message and he just smiles at all the exclamations and caps lock in Ginny's message about how she forgot to tell him about a new editor in chief who just joined their publication house.
However, it seems, Draco took too long a time to conjure a question because when he snaps out of it and looks at Potter, or the place he has been standing on the last time; there is no Potter there now. In haste, Draco looks around and finds the said man near the door, about ready to exit.
Potter is the one to finish their impromptu staring contest as his eyes leaves that of Draco and scan the room, the bookshelf, Draco’s desk, the healer robes still slumped on the floor beside the desk chair, the glass cabinet full of vials of potions and then as if he was searching for something and has found it, they settle back on Draco with a calmness that was not there a minute before.
Draco fails to hear a howl after falling on the ground and hasty footsteps towards him and a strong muddy scent that surrounds him as a warm body cradles his body in its embrace.
A snarky remark - something like ‘thank god you knew a less damaging spell’ - is just on the tip of his tongue when the red-haired next words stun him to silence.
Harry needs time. He came about ready to tell Malfoy about ‘How’ he was a wolf not “Why” he is a wolf.
So he worked hard to be his own person in last few years. To not be the son of a death eater, to not be an ex death eater himself, to make a life out of his family name.
Everybody at St. Mungo’s knows how Malfoy is married to his work. Getting him out of the hospital and to go sleep in his actual bed is such a task. When he said he practically lives there, he was
Draco knows he is staring which is making the savior fidget in his place but Draco cannot help but stare. He can still feel the pulse of magic - Potter’s magic that barely touched him but shriveled him up.
“I -”, he starts only to stop when Malfoy drops an empty vial on the floor next to his desk, by accident or on purpose harry is not sure. Maybe the healer was telling Harry to get out without spelling it.
As Draco’s eyes finally adjusts to the brightness of the hospital ward, he sees a familiar face of Padma Patil in her green robes inspecting the clipboard in her hands - most probably his diagnostic chart - the blonde thinks to himself.
Harry and Hermione just looks at him with fondness which the other chooses to ignore completely and instead keep mumbling things under his breath that mostly sound like - ‘that pointy git’ and ‘ferret’.
"I met Weasley few days ago." Harry almost swallows the drink through the wrong pipe on hearing Malfoy talk about meeting his best mate out of blue.
“You said Draco told you that. Are you sure he is right? Maybe he was mistaken.” It was Hermione this time who voiced out her concerns.
“But....I am guessing there is a but in there” Ginny replies with a knowing smile and Harry gives her his first genuine smile in weeks. The tension ebs away from his body. And that’s the reason he likes Ginny so much. She has this charm that melts away any problem Harry has..even if it's for a few moments. But the lightness is a welcomed state.
Trust Malfoy to be a dramatic arse in any situation that presents itself. Harry just rolls his eyes in exaggeration and when the healer tries to leave, with a silent swish of his wand, he locks the door and brings up privacy charms strong enough for a ministry meeting.
Draco cannot imagine looking at all those bodies and not just looking but finding them first prior to when they were attacked. The saviour in Potter must have gone crazy at the idea of not being able to save all those people in time.
“After the war, it was difficult to get out. I hated how everybody treated me. Not all the people who lost a loved one were not mad at me. Some of them were very angry and they would say things and then… It was getting difficult. I was mostly holed up in Grimmauld place. Not the best place to live alone but I had no choice. It became awkward to stay at the burrow after Ginny and I broke up.”
The moment the vampire tries to run past the wolf, with a low growl and a pounce the beast scratches the vampire across the chest and locks his canines onto the figure’s neck. A blood curdling scream resounds into the quiet forest as the vampire falls on the ground with a loud thud. The beast however does not step away and keeps his one paw over the fallen wizard’s heaving chest.
Harry had been so excited to go to school when he first learned about it. The prospect of making new friends and to learn and to just be out of the house and his cupboard had him in glee. But it soon turned out to be his biggest nightmare.
Harry chances a glance around the room and realizes with a start that the house does feel more alive today - if that's even possible for a house to achieve. The room appears to be more lit and the permanent layer of dust covering the furniture seems to have vanished in a blink of an eye. The house even smells nicer - not hot, damp and suffocating like it usually does. Not only the house but even his oh-so-great companion of a house elf was acting strange since he told him about Malfoy coming over for dinner. Harry has never seen that look of pure joy on the battered elf's face ever. He looked weirdly human with that emotion on him.
Giving a once over to his pitch black surroundings again, Draco tries to identify the part of forest he is in even if it is a tough task to conquer as the whole forest looks vaguely similar from everywhere to him even in broad daylight so what more to expect during this hour.
After both the aurors are done questioning him and recording his statement, Draco gets up to leave only for Potter to halt him.
When he was first asked to make a public appearance, his hands had turned cold and face turned ashen white. Ginny never asked him again.
“You will tell me when you are ready.” Ron does not even look at him when he says it with such confidence.
“Did you just hiss at me.” Harry has the nerve to smirk at him after saying that right in the middle of a fight and if draco was not planning on how to get them out of there alive he would have liked to wipe that smirk right off his partner’s face.
“Professor Lupin, as you were already aware was cursed with Lycanthropy, would turn every full moon into a beast. And his friends hated to see him alone at that moment. So as a way to support him, they all became…” Harry pauses to take a deep breath because he is aware how his next words would bare his secret to Malfoy.
Since childhood he has been bullied by his cousin Dudley. The bullying when turned into shoves and punches, Harry has long forgotten.
And Padma just stares at him. First in slight annoyance which completely morphs into one of surprise once she studies Draco carefully.
Potter must be feeling something too given his expression of extreme discomfort but still he does not let go of Draco's wrist and instead nudges him to sit back down.
Ron just looks at him. His eyes searching for something. What? Harry is not sure. But a beat later, the red head nods and glances away.
Yes. I am reopening this collection of drabbles. Some new some old ones. Also, I am back on Instagram so if anyone wants to be in touch find me there ->
There are so many questions that are answered now but so many new emerged. And the biggest and most important of them all being ‘how the hell Potter marked on him?’
“So” Ron pulls the 'o' unnecessarily long and Harry is not sure what it implies but has no time to linger on it much as the ginger head continues with “you mean to tell us that you marked Malfoy. Malfoy, of all the people! How can you even mark on someone?”
Draco didn’t know that. Thinking to himself he again notices how lucky Potter is to have Granger as a friend.
Draco looks at Potter again and zeroes-on on his eyes and with a startle realizes that the green of his eyes seems familiar. The last time Draco saw eyes similar to these were last night, just that they were
There is a teasing smirk on Ginny’s face and Harry makes a disgusted face at her in return which makes her laugh full blown.
“My father, Sirius Black, Professor Lupin and Peter Pettigrew - the four of them called themselves The Marauders. They were best of friends.” Harry says it bitterly only because of how he had to name Pettigrew as a friend. He was anything but a friend. The wince let out by the blonde man at the mention of his name does not go unnoticed by Harry but he tries to ignore it in favour of continuing his words.
“Hi Draco, how do you feel today?”, Healer Padma Patil struts in to his ward with a scarny little intern on her heels.
It is not unheard of wizards and witches having a patronus and animagus form different but it is extremely rare. But trust Potter to be the one doing the unthinkable - rarity being his middle name.
He knew he had known the answer all along. The answer lay in the back of his head, only it took him this long to realize it.
“I didn’t do it out of choice. It happened.” Harry says with unparalleled calmness that surprises even his own self.
There is a knock on the door and a quiet enquiry of if someone is inside. Harry is unsure if the person asked it quietly or his hearing has been affected following his assaut. He prefers the former situation with all his heart.
And then there is one random thought that leaves him panicking. 'What if this new guy is a reporter and is here to stalk him!'
“Potter, as much as I am greatly surprised by your cryptic talk; if you don’t have anything important to say then I would like to go. If you don’t remember I have just faced a life and death situation.”
Without Draco’s knowledge his brain had deemed it necessary to ask another question. He knows which ‘why’ he might have meant but is it okay to ask it now. Does he have the authority to ask that of Potter? Will Potter even tell him? But then he remembers how the other has already said so much without him asking. Maybe he wants to tell Draco all of it. And maybe if Draco presented his question nicely and politely, Potter would indulge him with an answer.
The scent of potions and disinfectants peculiar to only one known place fills his senses and Draco knows where he is even before he has opened his eyes; even before his full consciousness returns back to him. This is the place he practically lives in and even if he is not particularly thrilled to have a role reversal, he is assured enough by the fact that he came out alive from last night’s turn of events.
The scent of fresh blood and flesh wound fills the air around them and Draco feels sick to his stomach. The wolf then looks at him and Draco for the first time notices the green eyes staring back at him that looks eerily familiar. Before he could think much though the wolf grabs a wand in his jaw and throws it at him.
“Ron told me to not do this. He knew it was messing with me. It was like the war all over again. People dying in front of me. And me being absolutely helpless about it.”
Speaking of the house elf, Harry hears the faint footsteps of Kreacher coming closer and closer and when he finally plucks his eyes away from Malfoy and his full Black ensemble, it is to the sight of Kreacher wobbling into the room balancing a tray in his hands.
However, before Draco could step away from the dinner table a hand shoots out and suddenly Draco's wrist feels like it is on fire.
“I am not worried about telling you about that but about what it implies.” Draco didn’t know Potter had a bone in him to be this cryptic and honestly he would have appreciated it much more if he was not tired and badly in need of rest after the events of last twenty four hours.
Of course Draco had thought about it a lot. Researched a lot. Even if he had claimed about Potter marking him on a whim. He had a lot to think about later on. And the answer was plain as day. However, there might be things that Potter is confusing this marking with.
“You weren’t there for the meeting when you never skip it so I thought you must have missed the memo and left early. But seeing how you are busy” a pause in which Draco can hear a hundred thousand teasing remarks he would be subjected to in the future and then Padma continues to “I will see you tomorrow”, which is nothing but code words for ‘we are so gonna talk about this tomorrow’.
He is pushing himself to get up when the sound of twigs breaking catches his attention. If not for the eerily quiet forest, Draco would have missed it.
“What now then?” There is irritation in Ron’s voice but also a sign of resignation. As if he has no other choice than to accept the fact that his best mate might possibly be bonded to their childhood nemesis.
But he went absolutely crazy when he saw Malfoy crashing the ground in front of him. It was like he himself was attacked. Before that his own emotions were so high on the peak that he could not realize that he was experiencing another set of emotions. However, as he quickly transformed back to his human form, still feeling the tremors of a stunner, he realized that something had changed forever that night.
Kreacher is in the house; Harry is sure if all the clattering voices are any indication but where exactly only god knows. Every time Harry heard noises from the kitchen and went in to check in case the elf had the kitchen on fire, he only found groceries and utensils lying around in a mess. There were still sounds coming from somewhere, somewhere underground if Harry tried to listen carefully but no sign of the old elf anywhere. And that's the second thing that annoys Harry - there are still places that he has not been able to explore in Grimmauld place. Mostly because he worried about what dark artifact he will acquire. It was a torture trying to throw away all the weird looking and dangerous antiques that littered around the Black house. The first of which were the horrendous looking house-elf's heads lining the staircase. Hermione had taken immense pleasure in getting them off the wall. Kreacher had whined, complained, thrown a tantrum along with the portrait of Walburga Black who wouldn't stop screaming profanities at him. At last Harry had hired an expert to take that bloody old hag off the wall. If given the choice, he would have loved to throw her under the bus, something that he never said out loud in front of kreacher as the elf was still giving him the silent treatment along with burnt toast for breakfast, lunch and Dinner. It's only natural; Harry had survived those few months of cleaning the house of dark magic on pizza and takeout. But that still had not made Harry change his mind on incinerating the wretched portrait. It was hermione, however, who suggested locking the portrait of Lady Black in the attic with a dozen or so silencio instead of doing something that might earn him the lifelong bitter treatment from the only other habitant of the house.
"I-" Malfoy halts and pretends to sip his wine when there is hardly any left in his glass and Harry just looks on with a slightly curious expression. Even if he knows what Malfoy is gonna ask him.
“The house just welcomed me.” Malfoy tells him in a whisper while he slowly fingers through the tapestries on the wall beside where once hung the portrait of Walburga Black, entirely clueless about how Harry is gawking at him from the back.
“Wait”, Draco yells but gets embarrassed by the urgency in his voice and repeats it again in a lower and less urgent voice all the while trying not to blush.
They have just floo’ed back from the St. Mungo’s and are not looking forward to report back to Head Auror Robards without the statement of the main witness and the victim as well in this case.
"I think that's the reason the house reacted the way it did when I entered. God knows how long it had waited for a Black to step into the house."
Harry has stopped pacing and is now looking straight at Malfoy who is not backing away as well. It is like Hogwarts all over again. There feels to be like a challenge in their gazes when there is anything but that. They both have been dramatic when it came to interacting with each other anyways - something that Hermione has told harry repeatedly since their schooldays.
But the sound of footsteps next are loud and clear enough for Draco to get his senses back and prepare for the worst. Nobody would be roaming the forbidden forest so late(he doesn't know but calculating from how he left St. Mungo’s at around 10 and the ache in the back of his head is not very strong..it must be past midnight now) just for a leisure stroll.
His wandless spells are not strong enough to protect him from this situation. A situation which looks eerily familiar. There have been cases coming in St. Mungo’s of victims being found bloodied in a different part of the forest every night for past one week.
. Maybe this whole dinner thing was a wrong move. Draco feels like if he breathed, they would be unbearably touching each other. Draco is hyper aware of every tingle that makes the fine hair on his legs stand. At that exact moment, almost like a vision, their last meeting flashes through his mind. Draco can still feel that fateful night; their close proximity; the heat from their bodies meeting each other. They were so so close. One move and they both would have been kissing. Draco is feeling that same pull of gravity now. And by the way Potter seems to look like he is holding in his breath, maybe he is feeling it too - the pull.
“You are taking it quite well for some unexpected reason.” Harry just says which had Draco narrowing his eyes in suspicion.
With his forehead rested on the mahogany door and shoulders slumped in defeat, this picture of Malfoy ignites something within Harry that he is quite unable to name.
Draco peels himself away from Potter as if scorched. Potter, on the other hand, is staring wide eyed at the patronus that has just stopped in front of him after circling around them twice.
“But is it not?” Malfoy counters with a nonchalance of a hippogriff and Harry is confused between either to laugh or scoff. He decides to just stride towards the living room leaving it up to Malfoy to follow him inside. As they take their seat on the couch from across each other, Harry notices that Malfoy is still looking around as if he is searching for something. He unknowingly voices his question and is instantly met with Malfoy’s blazing gaze that makes him surprisingly nervous.
Recounting last night, from what all he could remember was more tiring than he originally thought so. And all now Draco wants to do is go back to his manor and plant himself face first onto his silk sheets, soft comforter and a warm bed.
Ron and he had hoped to get Malfoy’s statement but the governing healers asked them to step out of his ward and wait for another day when the blonde knocked himself out again.
“It took my dad three years but I managed to acquire my form in five months. I have had help though. If not for Professor Mcgonagall and Hermione, maybe I would have never been able to transform. The first time I changed, it was scary. Like everyone else I had thought to be a stag - like my patronus - same as my father’s.”
“I don’t know what you are talking about.” As if that would be of any help to him but harry has to at least try. He does not like the look Hermione is giving him. Ron at least has an expression of annoyance on his face which is expected and so does not scare Harry. But Hermione’s smirk is giving all kinds of bad vibes to him.
Draco is suddenly much awake. Five days. Potter has been in the forest. One part of him wants to taunt the other for not being able to catch the vampire fast enough but the other part of him knows how it would be such a douche thing to say. He decides to stay quiet and hear in Potter’s next words.
The black marble flooring of the Auror department of DMLE never fails to make Harry anxious. Ron has never understood the deal with it. “It's just the flooring, Harry”. He has said many a time but the reflection and the curt clicks of boot on the marble floor winds Harry up the wall.
Harry cannot tell this all to Malfoy though. Speaking of the other, the said male is sitting on one of the chair; his eyes boring ideally into distance. Harry is not sure if he is even breathing or blinking. He thinks Malfoy needs time to digest all of this and proceeds to leave when a hand shoots out to grab his.
When did he get there? Why Draco didn't hear him walk towards the exit? He couldn’t even sense the privacy charm lifting, only now when he focus does he notice that Potter has already dissipated the spell.
Harry has no idea what Malfoy and Padma are talking about but seeing the way Malfoy is all tensed up, it must have been something related to work. Now Harry feels bad for dropping by on such short notice. Maybe he should have waited till Malfoy was off duty or on his leave day. But truth be told, he had no patience left to just sit still and not find out about what was going on. He is feeling a strange mix of emotions towards the blonde, which are not different from what he felt for the healer during school days but there is this underlying overwhelmness that Harry can’t pinpoint where it is coming from.
"I searched about any wolf animagus in history but there was none. How is it that you managed to be a miracle yet again, Potter?"
"Bonding over behind our backs I see." He obviously meant him and Hermione but does not clarify it on seeing the smirk playing on Malfoy's face. The git is definitely gonna say something crude.
Draco stands there frozen on his spot. His hand, which was outstretched,  now stands halted in midair not knowing whether to go further and comfort the other like he planned to or retrieve it by his side completely.
The indistinguishable voice of Hermione Granger erupts from the otter thus revealing the identity of to whom the patronus belongs to.
“There was a group of four students - Gryffindor - who called themselves marauders during their Hogwarts days. My father was one of them.” Harry pauses to swallow down his emotions. He does not talk about his parents often. People who are close to him already know everything and people who are not, he does not want them to know. He has never found himself in a predicament similar to the current one. So it is hard for him to decide how to react properly. It is not every day that he tells his nemesis about his closely guarded rare memories of his family.
Just as he is about to leave the building, someone pushes him hard from behind and before Harry had the time to turn around or get back up he is dragged into dark brooms closet. His attackers don’t give him even a second and starts punching him like a bean bag. Although his glasses had fell outside when he was pushed, he can recognise those curses and those grunts and those punches blindfold. Its dudley and his friends. Harry tries to struggle free first few minutes but eventually gives up, knowing fully well that rebutting will result in more bruises and more punches. One particular hard kick to his ribs have him screaming in pain and almost immediately a hand presses on his mouth cutting his air supply. He is thrashing real hard. Blind and breathless in a compact space with pain shooting up every vein of his body. And when the hand finally falls off, he didn’t even get to take a breath when a hard punch lands on his lower jaw. A big bruise already blooming there, his lip split open and a wetness at the corner of his lips that surely is blood if the iron taste in his mouth is any indication.
“Potter!” Harry’s inner monologue is interrupted by the sudden call of his name in the most irritated voice possible. Before he can counter back though, his magic pulses indicating a spell being thrown at his privacy charm bubble. He looks at Draco and the other has already sensed it somehow because he is lifting his finger in a motion to ‘stay put’ and crosses the room to throw open the door with a swish of his wand, dismantling Harry's privacy spell in the process.
Is this the same person? Probably not. He knows Malfoy has changed a lot. Harry has been a witness to it a lot of times. But still, can someone change completely?
Malfoy looks relieved to hear that as if he was hyper aware of the fact that now nobody would jump him out of nowhere and almost kill him in the process. But harry knows it's much more than about his own safety. Malfoy was way more involved in this case. Harry had seen with his own eyes how spent the healer looked every time a victim died on the hospital bed. It is almost hard for Harry to believe that Malfoy would be worried about others. But people change. And the relief that showed on his face had more to do with 'now nobody would die on my watch' than 'now I wouldn't die on the hands of that monster'.
"Trust me, I have been asking myself the same since forever." Potter answers once he has stopped fidgeting and found his voice to actually use for what its purpose is.
“I have been in the forest for last five days. Thinking that I would be able to catch the culprit and save the next victim. But obviously it was all in vain.”
Draco's unblinking eyes and a surprised expression must have been noticed by the other as Potter extracts himself from the couch and wandless and without word accios the pensieve in front of Draco, who is now gaping at the suddenness and quickness of Potter's actions. There is a kind of urgency in Potter's behaviour, his actions and his tight expression that does not go unnoticed by Draco but are also not fully understood by the other. It was not even half an hour ago when Potter seemed so reluctant on talking and now he appears so eager to bare all his secrets just like that. Draco is confused beyond wits. He guess he will never be able to understand how Potter's mind works.
"Who said I am here for facts? If I am dragged in this mess the least you can do is be honest with me. I think I deserve that much."
“Oh, I bet you do.” She is grinning now and Harry feels cornered so he does the only thing he can think of - to look at his best mate for some help and gets cheated on miserably.
Harry is saying something but draco is not really listening or trying not to listen as to come up with a plan on how to deal with this situation. It’s one particular jab in his ribs that has draco turning towards the other and snarling in anger.
Harry is trying not to show shock followed by disappointment at padma’s response but at this rate, taking ron would be the only option left.
So with a resigned sigh, Harry tells her all about a nosy neighbour who came out of nowhere and tried to barge into his life uninvited.
No matter how much Ginny tells him to not worry or push himself; that there is still time left before the deadline to submit the first official draft approaches, Harry can't help but feel scared and disappointed.
Draco knows a little about marking. It Happens when the beast in you finds someone they deem the most compatible. But there is hardly any compatibility between them. They can’t even stand each other. No more than five minutes and they will be about ready to hex each other into oblivion.
And that has left harry moping around and making a fool of him in front of girls he has never even talked to before.
With a startle, Harry discovers that he has been ready to tell Malfoy everything since before his beast even marked the other. He had already put his trust in him. Maybe that’s why his wolf deemed him as a mate.
It cannot be the bond. No. What they have between them is not some bond working. Draco has seen a lot of bonds. Bonds make your head fuzzy. The power to process thoughts declines significantly. But he is painfully aware of everything around him. There is no confusion. No second thoughts on what he is feeling. It's the same he had felt that day - attraction. It terrifies him. Draco does not want to go back in time and feel what he used to a decade ago. It took him too long and too much effort to suppress his past feelings. But now potter is making it very difficult for him to continue the same.
Potter caresses the spine of old medicine books that line Draco’s shelf and the gesture takes the slytherin by surprise. It has always been like this. Draco being drawn to everything that the black haired boy – who is now a man - does.
He is in the out. He can tell from the cold, the wind rustling around, and the muddy ground below him.
"He died the next day obviously. You know that right but don't you?" Harry was confused that day when Ron had told him about it. Why Malfoy would ask the obvious question, Harry had thought to himself then. He was the healer on the case. He must know what happened.
Even if the answer was not too unexpected like he thought it would be, it was still not easy to accept especially because of how it changes the whole equation. Lot of things that didn’t make sense earlier now does. Other things that he thought were simpler became ten folds complex instantly with this big reveal.
"Ms Granger, please step back", Draco knows who that voice belongs to but is still unable to process why professor Mcgonagall is part of this memory. Potter never once even belatedly mentioned about the former headmistress knowing about this debacle. He should have known though, given the status of 'boy who lived' and the 'golden trio', they must have gotten all the help they could to conquer this happening.
Harry stares with an arched brow not expecting this response from the other. Malfoy does not look like he wants to do this today but his answer speaks otherwise, confusing Harry to no end.
Harry is surprised. Not by Malfoy giving up so soon and so easily but the way he threw the word ‘sorry’ so casually. He does not remember Malfoy ever apologizing even once during their school years.
Before he could comprehend what was happening, a wolf, bigger than anything he has ever seen, with fur the colour of midnight jumps in air and crashes hard into the vampire who has gone stiff at the sudden intrusion.
And potter laughs at that - loud, boisterous and carefree. The only time Draco has seen him laugh like this is when he is with his friends. Being at the receiving end of Potter’s laughter brings a warm feeling to Draco. And the feeling intensifies exponentially when Potter turns around to look at him just before exiting and leaves Draco with a ghost of a smile and tingling warmth.
He is fighting his beast, Draco wonders in astonishment. How powerful Harry must be, to be able to fight his animagus form. A form of a predator too. At a time when his mind is the most vulnerable. When his senses are of a wolf. Draco was thinking all this only when suddenly he feels the similar pain of breaking bones and hears the ear splitting scream. This time it passes quickly and he realises why, as he now stands in front of Potter, back in grimmauld place, his body still hunched over the pensieve and Potter eyeing him with an expression similar to that on his own face.
Harry does not fail to notice the flash of surprise that passes through Malfoy’s face at the mention of his father; even if the blonde pretends to smooth his expression into one of nonchalance seconds later.
As they both get up to move towards the couch the still completely filled table with untouched dishes is cleared in a blink. Draco didn’t even hear the pop of Kreacher coming in and out of the room. He dishes the thought out in favour of taking his seat back on the couch in front of Potter’s. Then he waits even though his patience is running low tonight as Potter drags him to the end of his sanity with his cruel push and pull.
"Stalling", the word is out of Draco's mouth before he could comprehend and even though he is a little embarrassed to say that. It will take an army to make him accept that or show it on his face. The 'git' that potter murmurs under his breath does not even annoy him.
"Will you stop interrupting me? I am trying okay. And for your kind information, I am not stalling. Just like you said, there has been no record in history so I don't know how to explain something that has no explanation. Whatever I am gonna say is based on assumptions. It's all a theory. It's working for me and for moments like these when I have to explain it to someone else. But still it’s a theory not a fact."
Harry has never seen a liquor bottle in this house. No matter how much Harry asked Kreacher to get him anything alcoholic. Neither has harry himself seen any cellar in the house. Ron had argued for five minutes straight how there was no chance that Grimmauld place had no cellar. Harry had brushed him off even if he could practically feel kreacher lying through his teeth. He was filthy rich anyways; to buy crates of beers and anything else he wished to drink.
Not many people in his own building have seen him, only an elderly lady from across his door, the staff at reception desk and only the postman know how Harry Potter, the mysterious guy from 7th floor looks like.
"Harry. Harry. Stop. Listen to us", of course it is Granger who has to try and be the voice of reason everywhere. Draco scoffs at the way Granger tries to reason with a beast, a wolf nonetheless, who is growling at them menacingly. Harry, the wolf, takes one step ahead and the professor casts a protego not at themselves but at the wolf which baffles Draco immensely. Still in this situation, they are trying to protect him from hurting themselves, rather than thinking about their own selves. What kind of a bond is this. Does a friendship of this sort still exist?
.  As time passed though, while Potter left most of his questions unanswered, the curiosity to know something that had never happened before; something that Draco was unaware of peaks everything else. There is a reason why he was a slytherin - it was not all about his blood status or his family name. It had a lot to do about how Draco was always so curious to know about things. Sometimes those things didn't even concern him and sometimes they led him into dangerous situations. But seeking knowledge has always been like second nature to Draco.
There was once a moment when Potter had looked at him with worry, his fists clenched and anger flashing in his green eyes. It was when Draco said he almost believed he was gonna die last night.
The accusation in Ron’s shout was apparent and it took Harry a minute to realize what just slipped his mouth.
"I didn't lie about anything. So in my opinion I have been nothing but honest with you. I might have withheld some information but you can't really blame me. We have had a largely colourful history. It's expected of me to be a little hesitant. I have told you so much about me in the last few weeks whereas I know nothing more than I already knew about you. Don't you think it is a little unfair?"
The gravity of the situation finally settles on him and nothing comes up in his mind on how to protect himself against this sudden danger.
All his thoughts leave him, however, when he steps outside to come face to face with his two least favourite people in the world - Weasley and Potter.
His worst nightmare is here. Should he even try to outrun the blood sucker in order to save himself or that will just ensue his death faster.
“I don’t understand. If he stepped back when you called him off. So why is it bothering you so much even now!!!”
There has been importing of illegal potion ingredients and after a week of patrolling and tailing...both harry and draco have somewhat identified their culprit.
“Cousin. I know.” Harry interrupts Malfoy with a tone of finality. The other takes the hint and does not say anything else.
It has happened all too many times, when one of them starts to execute their own plan and leaves the other no choice but to go along because otherwise the option is to just...die of an unforgivable curse.
Potter is trying to avoid his gaze, Draco can see it but he is unable to look away. He is transfixed by what Potter is saying. Is he implying what Draco thinks he is? But Draco means nothing to him. Why would he...?
That does not mean though he is enjoying any of this. Far from it actually. Harry knows Ron has some unresolved enmity with Draco. Before sometime ago, even Harry felt the same. Everything is changed now however.
Clearing his throat to get the other’s attention Draco asks Potter about what he wanted to talk about in a voice that masks his curiosity very well.
And then the second he saw Malfoy inches away from the vampire, all he could see was red. A strange madness engulfed him and he just leaped into air without much thought. He just wanted to kill the blood sucker. Why? He was not sure then. He is not fully sure now still.
Draco tries to pull his wand out of his holster and realizes in a moment of panic that he has no wand on him.
"Potter, are we really doing this or not? If you have nothing to tell me then why do you keep insisting on meeting me? I can't imagine you seeking my company because I, for one, cannot stand you and I had an impression that the feeling was mutual." Draco meant his words to have a tinge of humour but by the end of it he sounded annoyed even to his own ears. Well there is nothing he can do now.
If possible Draco would have liked to wipe that smug look off of Potter this very second. He manages to just scowl in response though.
He shakes his head in negation and Hermione just sighs sadly while Ron looks relieved - about what - Harry is not sure and is not eager to even find out.
Hermione pauses for a few seconds, looks at Harry with narrowed eyes, shakes her head and then proceed to eat dinner. It takes her only a minute to drop her cutlery and exclaim loudly as she remembers a very important piece of information.
Potter, who was so immersed in his storytelling, jerks out of it so hard that he almost staggers back in his steps. His wide eyes and horrified look is enough proof that he had forgotten where he was and to whom he was reciting his story. It takes him a minute to discern his surroundings and to come in terms with the reality. His closed eyes could be a sign of calmness or of embarrassment; Draco cannot tell which one it is with absolute surety.
Draco knows all of this. Of Course it will be a theory only. There has never been a wolf animagus ever before. In fact nobody ever thought it to be even possible. This on top of the rarity of a different animagus and patronus form is enough to be unexplainable.
“It's the middle of freakin december but yeah it's ‘warm’. So who is it??” she wiggles her brows so lewdly that Harry almost chokes on his coffee.
Draco is halted mid sentence by a quick dismissal of Potter’s hand in his direction. Sealing his lips, rather reluctantly, Draco leans backward and gets comfortable. This is gonna turn into a long night, he just knows it. Better to get his body relaxed and filled with alcohol to deal with Potter's antics.
After a handful of spells and cross checking them, Padma steps back and hands over the chart to the intern who quickly leaves to file the report.
In Fact they are the best duo in the whole department. But that does not hinder them both to bicker mid-fight and lose their temper on each other when they should be chasing the criminal.
“I take it that you have realized who the wolf was”, Draco is brought out of his thoughts by the sudden voice.
"But maybe this situation. Whatever it is with this neighbour. These unchecked feelings you are having and these interactions. Maybe you can channel it all into your writing. I mean from a 3rd person pov, this all sounds very cheesy and romantic to me so maybe this will work."
And it's not just them but the constant bullying he is subjected to by other students, students that come from rich backgrounds and think of him as dirt has harry living his worst nightmare in real life.
Draco knows all of this and had already identified the reason behind Potter’s Dad and his friends becoming an animagus. He does not stop Potter from telling it though. God knows how long he had kept all of this inside of him. With every word, every passing sentence, Potter seems to lose the thread of tension from his body. Draco can feel the wave of his strong magic settling down as his mind finally starts to find peace. So he does not intervene and let Potter tell his story.
Does Potter even like guys, Draco has no idea. And he could decipher from the little story Potter told him that marking him was not by choice.
“Potter, contrary to what you might think I don’t have the whole day to just stand here and watch you pace left and right pathetically.”
He gives a stiff nod to Padma and before Draco could think of anything, previously hidden behind Weasley’s auror robes emerges Potter with his untameable mop of hair and a stupid smile.
Draco tries to cast another spell but without his wand and being drained of energy, he is unable to conjure enough magic to do so.
“Harry, what a surprise? I didn’t know you were visiting. Are you here for the case?” Draco can already see the Cheshire expression on her face. She clearly knows Potter was not here on auror duty. She would have known of Harry arrival then.
Draco however tries to project a wandless protego in hopes of stalling his dreadful fate for few more seconds. The shield was not even halfway through when the man, the vampire expels it with his own wand.
Potter seems startled to hear his voice after an extended silence. Draco had gauged the reaction and had manoeuvred his body such that it wouldn't be touching that of the other when the oblivious git spasms like he predicted.
Potter does not answer though. With a heavy sigh as if the question physically pained him, he once again scans the room and Draco almost loses his cool.
Padma just chuckles at him. The intern has a mind to not laugh outright if he does not want to be at the receiving end of Healer Malfoy’s wrath.
Memories of their last interaction suddenly flashes in his mind, and his eyes suddenly darts to the person who is doing everything in his power to avoid his gaze.
If somehow he miraculously came out alive from this then he can at least confirm that it is a single creature as one of the witnesses. But the chances of him making it alive are somewhat nonexistent at this point.
Harry looks on as Malfoy goes through a plethora of emotions. Anger, dejection, fear and something that Harry cannot pinpoint. But like he predicted, every emotion is a negative one. He himself was not any better when he realized what happened. He was not even sure he had the ability to mark - his bad luck that he has and he turned out to mark the only person who hated him more than he hated them.
“I think you should take advantage of this situation”, when Harry tries to speak she shakes her head and continues.
As Kreacher vanishes into thin air Draco looks at Potter and finds him with an expression similar to like he has smelled his own rotten socks. Draco can practically hear him debating about something in his head, must be something stupid, Draco deduces and clears his throat in hopes of Potter getting a move on. Although he is nowhere near hungry but not eating would make things more awkward and Draco isn’t sure how the house-elf would react to him rejecting the food. Going by his personal experiences with his own house elves, they don’t take rejecting their food mildly. It causes a bloody disaster.
The next time they meet is at Grimmauld place. When Harry had invited Malfoy over he had serious doubts about if the other would even accept it or not. Malfoy, however, had seemed very keen on Harry’s offer. The reason of which he discovered later on when Malfoy arrived dressed like he has come for a ministry gala.
. The git had though excused himself by saying he was running short on time and insinuate Draco to ask Potter as if they were what? Friends and met up often. Tsk.
“About me marking you. That’s what you said that day. Are you sure about that fact because I don’t..”, Harry leaves the sentence hanging there gesturing between themselves to indicate what he means, which he is sure the pointy git understood completely well but still appears clueless. The smirk on his face though does little to help hide that fact.
They have not talked about what happened that day. Thank Merlin for that. What would he even say to justify that? Who even had made the first move, he does not know. And he is glad Potter is being ignorant about that as well. But what Draco cannot ignore is
It’s a lot to take in. What all Potter just told him; why would he even do that, Draco is not sure but it's hard to digest all the information.
Great! Just great! Not only did he mark Draco but it seems like Draco in some weird sense has marked his ownership over his house and the old elf.
"Ok. I am leaving then." Draco starts to get up. There is a thought in the back of his head that he is being too dramatic but also that he is escaping like a coward, not ready to admit he is feeling things in the presence of Potter that he had buried deep within him.
“I am serious. This is important. I am not stalling.” Harry replies in quick succession and stares hard at the other man.
It will only be a miracle if someone finds him before tomorrow morning. And he does not want to think about what will happen to him by then.
The whole ordeal was even more painful because of the way Harry bloody Potter made it so awkward. He wouldn’t look at Draco, even while asking questions - which was such a rude gesture and Draco wanted to give him a lecture on common etiquette but somehow managed to held it all in.
“Stop it. I am trying to help. I know I am a horrible person for saying all those mean things to you. B-but i never wanted y-you to get hurt...never like this.”
Okay. That was not where Draco thought the argument would lead. Why did it end at Draco being asked to reveal something about him? How did Potter even reach that conclusion, all on his own?
“Okay.” Draco does not know to what that response belongs to but before he can ask Potter is asking to first finish their dinner. Although, Draco wants to refuse, he is not hungry anyways, but something in Potter’s tight set of jaws and almost pleading eyes compel him to comply with his request.
So the result is this quick update. Don't expect much though. There will probably be one more chapter and an epilogue but when..i am not sure.
Draco keeps staring without blinking as Potter regards him with such intensity. Only the slight raised eyebrows were the reaction his question got from the golden boy or should they call him a golden man now. Unnecessary thought, Draco thinks and pushes it away.
Not to forget the big elephant in the room. How the hell Potter turned into a wolf? A full bodied wolf in fact and not just someone who inherited certain traits - out of a bite or a  curse - it does not matter. It has to be a curse. There is nothing else that could explain it. There is actually nothing that could explain this whole ordeal - wolf and the marking alike.
It was the first day of school and draco had been chilling in the hallways with his troupe when harry had walked past them. To everyone he seemed like a normal boy, to his friends he was another one of those charity cases but to draco...he had not been able to remove his gaze from the green of harry’s eyes. They had trapped him in one glance alone. Draco wanted to know him, wanted to be his friends but the other had refused and ran away from there. Draco has felt humiliated and embarrassed. He had become the laughing stock for everyone for almost two months. Annoyed and frustrated draco had thought nothing before starting to bully harry.
At Draco’s nod of approval Harry takes a step closer but almost immediately turns right to stand in front of a book shelf. He is suddenly tense once again.
After they manage to drag all 5 unconscious wizards back to HQ with the help of their backup that usually arrives after they both are done battling alone, draco rounds harry around the corner to their shared office and shoves him inside unceremoniously.
While they both walk towards Draco’s healer office - which is the only private enough place in St. Mungo's for him; all Draco can think about is a beast with fur color of midnight and eyes as green as the forest after rain.
The first thing Draco feels the moment he dives in is the unfamiliar tug that is a little less unsettling than apparition but still manages to leave him unhinged for a second.
"I know. Ron told me about it the same day. So what were you asking him? He just told me to answer you. About what though, he never said", which is obviously not true because Ron told him exactly what Malfoy had asked him. Also the answer that Ron gave him; something on the lines of 'ask Harry when you next meet him' as if they were meeting a lot. They weren't; or were they?
He should have but don't after that night when he became a victim - last one - too. Head healer must have prohibited him from taking any part in the case thereof. Harry should have realized this sooner. Seeing the look on Malfoy's face, the status of that vampire clearly holds importance to him. Merlin knows how many nightmares the blonde must be having of that night. Harry himself had few. None of which went the way reality did. Every nightmare ending with him thrashing and waking up with a scream. Malfoy must have been worried sick not knowing if the creature was still living, looking for him or dead already. They should have told him sooner.
Harry breathes out a short sigh and thinks it's better to just tell everything in one go or he would never be able to. His brain would keep distracting him otherwise.
“You would have to be more specific than that, Potter. We both said a lot of things last time we met.”
This is the third time Hermione has suggested something on the same grounds since he arrived and Harry is not sure if he should be worried or not. Hermione usually gauges his feelings pretty spot on. He, however, does not want Hermione to see through these feelings of his this time.
“You will, right?”, his words are not confident anymore and Harry feels ashamed to make his friend doubtful.
"Harry, mate. It's us. Your friends and this is our professor. Remember who you are. Harry, listen to your heart. Remember", it is Weasley this time and Draco almost tsk at him when he sees a shift in the wolf. It is no longer snarling at them, and has also stopped advancing at them. But he still looks in pain. Not a physical one though. And Draco realizes it with a start that he can feel it. The struggle going on inside Harry's head. His human self is trying to take control over his beast. To remind it who the people in front are.  To stop himself from attacking and causing them harm. The wolf snarls again, but the very next second lets out a loud whimper as if in pain. Draco feels like he is being stretched into two opposite directions but comes to his senses in time to know that it is not him, but Harry, who is feeling this way.
Sighing and seeing no other option along with intending the warmth to be gone, Draco takes his seat again. And finally, Potter lets go of his hand. A redness appears on Draco's pale skin and it takes more than a minute for him to peel his eyes away from the contrast. It does not hurt. The warmth though is like travelling throughout his body from that point of contact.
