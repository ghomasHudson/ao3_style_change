“I think the real question, Potter, is do you want a relationship?”
Draco raised an eyebrow at her. “I think the public is quite aware of our relationship, Ms Skeeter. A little too aware at times, some might say. I’ve heard from a few people that they’d like to see a little less of us if you’re looking for feedback.”
Harry was shaking his head before she finished talking. “Don’t think like that, Gin. We just weren’t right together. I know I wasn’t easy to be with, and it wasn’t your responsibility to fix me.”
They danced until the end of the song, and then Hermione grabbed him for the next.
“I think you’ve broken Weasley,” Draco drawled, but he looked pale.
“Thank you,” he mumbled into her hair and then pulled away to examine her face. “Who cares about that stuff anyway? You’re having a baby!”
The next morning he awoke to an owl at his window carrying that morning’s Prophet with a note stuck to it in Malfoy’s slanted hand:
With that, he turned on his heel and stalked back down the corridor without so much as a look back. Harry, who could suddenly breathe again, leant back against the door. He couldn’t quite believe how angry he had just become over so little. It seemed that there was still nothing and no one on earth who could piss him off the way Draco Malfoy could.
“So you’re…” Ron made a gesture with his hand that Harry could only assume was meant to represent gayness.
The shopkeeper babbled away as he totted up Harry’s purchases. Harry was only half-listening, though, distracted by the pile of brand new
The man’s brow furrowed, unfocused eyes examining Harry, “Are you sure? I thought he was taller.”
He hesitated for a moment outside room 104 until his impulsivity overtook his overthinking and he found himself knocking on the door.
“I just need to focus on getting the Cup, then afterwards things can go back to normal.” Harry could feel himself starting to babble slightly so he shut his mouth.
“Well, you see,” Malfoy said in a patient tone, as if talking to a child. “Sometimes, when a grownup hasn’t had any grownup time in months, they might touch themselves in their private swimsuit area…”
“Look, Potter, I don’t need you to feel guilty about anything. I actually think you were right to end things when you did.” Draco’s tone was even but he looked very tired.
This time when he felt Malfoy press against his hip he didn’t pull back, he pressed in closer and was rewarded with a desperate sound that ripped his self-control in two.
“Nothing,” he said quickly, flushing a bit.
“Was that Krum?” Malfoy sounded far away.
“You would have a nanny,” Harry said fondly, resting his arm on the bed so that Draco wouldn’t have to stretch his.
“I wouldn’t have given you a drink if I’d known you were already three sheets to the wind,” Malfoy said, not unkindly.
The place he took them to was less a bar than a club, with pounding music and big glittery ropes hanging from the high ceiling. Even though it was early the place was packed, and Malfoy seemed to know everyone. He kissed the bouncer on the cheek and then they were led to the back and through a door that took them into another, even more glamorous, room.
“No, I’m not,” Harry retorted, brow furrowed.
“Harry!” Hermione grinned, putting the paper down. “Come on through - Ron’s just made the most delicious pastries.”
They fell into a sort of routine now that the regular season was well and truly back; whenever they were both in London for games, which was about once a month or so, Harry would wait for Draco to text him and when he did he would floo directly into his bedroom in his London flat.
Harry rubbed his hand over his eyes, trying to push out the mental image of Draco, in bed with a faceless Belgium, that had popped into his head. He wasn’t jealous of course, but something about the image bothered him, like an itch in the back of his brain. He just wanted to find out if he was right.
That was the curse of the Seeker, Benjy always used to say: all the glory, all the blame and no in-between.
, Harry thought uncharitably.
“Oh no, you don’t,” she hissed and then turned to speak to the room at large. “Alright, you lot, clear out! Maid of honour and best man need five minutes alone with the bride.”
Very, to be perfectly honest, but he didn’t want Malfoy to know that. The issue was, the adrenaline from seeing him was wearing off slightly and Harry could feel himself starting to sway.
“I know you’re trying to help, but could you just leave it alone?”
The Burrow was filled almost to bursting with Weasleys and their children and spouses, spilling out into the front and back gardens despite the chill in the air. They seemed to occupy every available surface, and a few that probably shouldn’t have been available. As Harry made his way up the drive he spotted George chasing a few of his nieces around the garden with his coat pulled up over his head, pretending to be a dementor.
“Who are you?” Harry spluttered.
Malfoy made a little noise of pleasure as the man ducked his head even further, and Harry came back to himself. He quickly stepped back and shut the door, but as it was closing he saw Malfoy’s eyes snap open. He met his gaze for a fraction of a second.
“I’m pregnant!” Hermione broke the silence, then looked shocked at herself.
“Sorry - you just told me that you, Draco Malfoy, dated a Muggle, and you expect me to act like that isn’t the most insane thing I’ve ever heard? Did they ask you to get a mobile?”
“Good morning,” he said. “I could hear you snoring from here.”
“Come and dance with me,” he breathed and pulled Harry out of the bathroom towards the dance floor.
“Is that a car?” he asked incredulously, walking over to peer through the window.
The questions went on like this for a few more minutes before the Puddlemere spokeswoman finally called it to an end and he was able to excuse himself, head throbbing and in a foul mood. Instead of heading back to the changing rooms where his team would be gathering he turned the other way and walked back out towards the pitch.
He waited for her to react but she just sat there as if waiting for him to continue. When he didn't, her brow furrowed. “And?” she asked, looking expectant.
He lifted his head finally, slumping back in the chair. “He was annoyed that I was moving rooms, and then he accused me of being jealous.”
He heard Malfoy move in his bed and turn on his side to face him. “No, I'm not worried about what the press will say. For one, we’re in a foreign country and I think even Rita Skeeter has her limits. But more importantly, I’m not sure there is anything that they could write about me that’s worse than what they’ve already said. If I’m honest, I’d rather they write about my sex life than my family."
“What are we still doing out here?” Seamus laughed, clapping Harry on the back. “It’s freezing, come on inside!”
“Thanks, mate. I really appreciate it.” He smiled at the other man. Krum just nodded, and mimed sealing his lips and throwing away the key.
“That’s putting it mildly,” Ginny added. “I am suddenly much less confused as to why our relationship didn’t work out.”
“He’s not really company, though, is he? Sorry, you know what I mean, Hermione,” Ron withered under her unimpressed gaze.
This time Harry didn’t hesitate to grip Malfoy’s hair and stroke his cheek as he devoured him.
Harry was shaken out of his reverie by Ginny sliding into the booth next to him and smacking him on the shoulder.
Harry grinned in reply and knelt so he was almost sitting in Malfoy’s lap, their cocks brushing together as they jerked each other frantically. Harry used his new position to lean forward and suck a kiss at the base of Malfoy’s neck, which made Malfoy buck up into his hand with a curse.
Draco waved his hand dismissively. “Even worse. For years you had the plausible deniability to be able to write off your attraction to men as hero worship.”
She blinked at him. “Is there something wrong with your current room?”
Just as he was sinking into a properly crap mood, the fireplace sparked and a prim woman's voice boomed out of it.
“So.” Ron drew squiggles in the condensation on his pint glass. “What’s it like then?”
Harry threw the paper down and kicked the table leg viciously, which he immediately regretted.
Harry nodded exaggeratedly at him, and received a dark look in response.
Ron shook his head. “You two need help.” This only made them laugh more.
Harry glanced up at Parvati in disbelief but she gestured for him to continue so he warily opened the magazine to page twenty-three. He was greeted by another photo of Malfoy - this time thankfully wearing a shirt - on his broom and in his Magpies practice gear. He was midair and the photo looped as he snatched a Snitch out of the air and winked into the camera. Harry quickly turned the page to the actual article, which was peppered with photos of Malfoy from school and his time in France. With another glance at Parvati, Harry began to read.
“You know,” Ron said again. “Being with a bloke.”
Hermione reached over to rub his shoulder sympathetically. “Oh, Harry, you really are a bit oblivious sometimes.”
“Please, Harry,” she said, giving him an apologetic look. “Just talk to her for five minutes?”
Draco laughed at him when he expressed this. “It’s part of the whole gay thing. For the first fifteen years of my life, I thought that the reason I was obsessed with Andros the Invincible’s chocolate frog card was that I just really liked Ancient Greece.”
“No, you want your left hand to be wrapped around a bit more. Hold on.” He dismounted and came over to Harry, using his own hands to rearrange Harry's. It felt like a very unnatural angle for them to be twisted. Malfoy had long, boney fingers with neatly trimmed fingernails. As he wrapped them around Harry’s hands, he felt a little self-conscious of his own chewed up nails.
“Fucking hell,” she spluttered. “You can’t just drop something like that on me with no warning!”
“Can it wait?” Harry asked incredulously.
The thing was though, Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t, which may have explained why he was slipping out of bed at 11.20pm.
“I can’t believe you’re going on a blind date,” he sniggered down the phone. He was in Belgium with the Scottish team. “That’s incredibly sad.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel a little hard done by. For the first few years of his career he’d had lots of young fans, but these days his fanbase seemed to be leaning further and further towards the over sixty-five crowd. In fact, in the first few years after the war, the attention had been almost unbearably positive. He had some painful memories of the simpering profiles the
“Ah, right,” he stalled. He could tell her about what had happened - there was no reason why he couldn’t. She already knew that Malfoy was gay, after all. He glanced around quickly to make sure they were still alone in the cafe. “I erm… sort of walked in on Malfoy with someone in our room.”
“You did what?” Malfoy asked quietly.
They’d played against each other during the Christmas game and it had gone about as well as expected. Although Harry had managed to scrape a win in the end, he’d had to blow up a few Quaffles in the storage room to get out his frustration afterwards.
“It’s not out of the blue, though,” Harry said, getting a little annoyed. “If you’d been paying attention you’d know that things have been bad for a while, from long before the World Cup.”
Harry accidentally inhaled his beer. “Pardon me?” he choked.
That old taunt should not have made his blood boil the way it did. He wasn’t even self-conscious about the scar anymore - he was twenty-four, for fuck sake - but something about that nickname in Malfoy’s stupid, plummy accent made him feel like a teenager again.
He grasped the phone in his hand all the way home as if his life depended on it - he certainly did not want to have spent that much money only to get mugged five minutes later. Once safely home, he placed it on the table, staring at it warily. He flipped it open, then closed, then open again.
“Because I was trying to be nice,” Harry snapped back. “Just like I’ve been trying to be nice to you all week, you ungrateful prick.”
“And what are you wearing?”
He couldn’t watch Draco’s games because he was so busy, but he caught the highlights from Davies: Scotland were progressing almost as well as England. The likelihood that they would meet in the final was growing by the day.
As soon as he staggered to his feet he was mobbed by his team. The noise in the stadium was deafening, and he clutched onto the Snitch for dear life.
Each country designed their own camp, and Harry had to admit that they were quite entertaining to see. Germany’s, for example, seemed to have been based on a medieval village. A small group of wooden buildings which looked a little bit like gingerbread houses were clustered around the square. If Harry had walked closer he would have seen a practice pitch and probably a gym of some kind, but he kept moving.
“Where do you even buy this crap?” Harry asked, inspecting the elaborate label. He was pretty sure they didn’t sell anything like this at Madam Primpernelle’s.
“Not anymore?”
Harry felt hysterical laughter bubbling up in him too. “I mean - it’s a little bit funny.”
And then,
Draco was just about to respond but before he could, Harry spoke. “We have nothing to hide but, with all due respect, when we are ready to do that it won’t be with you or any publication you are associated with.”
“The fact that you think that that absolute goddess would even glance in your direction is truly sad,” Angelina replied, and Harry heard a scuffle that sounded suspiciously like Cormac trying to whack her. When he turned to look he found that Angelina had manoeuvred him into a headlock.
“Merlin, I’m impressed. I didn’t think you had it in you, Potter,” Malfoy laughed breathlessly, infuriatingly not bothered in the slightest by the hit.
After he’d finished telling the whole sorry story, there was silence. Ginny, Ron and Hermione all looked at him with varying degrees of disappointment.
Malfoy didn’t say anything but sat down on his bed with a huff and began undoing his shoes.
“Perhaps I’ll join you,” Malfoy said, a little too casually. Harry swallowed and nodded, unable to think of an intelligent reply. Malfoy stepped closer. “That would be fun, wouldn’t it? In the shower together, in front of everyone. Not able to touch or even look at each other.”
“If he hexes me in my sleep you owe me,” he said finally, vowing to get his revenge next time Wood asked him for a favour.
Harry didn’t know exactly what she meant but the fondness in her eyes sent warmth all the way down to his toes. Or maybe that was the alcohol.
Some strange confidence overtook Harry and he reached up and pulled Malfoy towards him. The boys wrestled on the tiles, wands abandoned in favour of fists. Malfoy got in a few good hits before Harry managed to get him in a headlock, but he made the mistake of relaxing for a second, during which Malfoy took the opportunity to slip free and scramble to his feet.
Sometime in the night, he had rested his head on the bed next to Draco’s legs and woke the second time to the feeling of fingers brushing through his hair. He turned his head slowly and found Draco staring at him with such fondness that his chest felt tight. He spotted the empty vial on the bedside table. He reminded himself it was the potion causing this, and forced himself to pull away from Draco’s touch to sit back in his chair.
“Well, technically, we didn’t actually fuck,” Harry quipped, and went a bit red when he realised what he’d said. “I mean…”
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, feeling around on the bedside for his glasses.
“Why not?”
It was so rare for Harry to have a Saturday off that he didn’t quite know what to do with himself. By 3 pm he’d barely managed to drag himself from his bed to the sofa and was trying and failing to eat his Chinese takeaway while horizontal. Safe to say it was a shock when his phone buzzed.
Hermione giggled again. “Did he come here straight after the game?”
An almighty thunk reverberated around the stadium.
A few hours later, when the party had wound down, Harry found himself sitting on the roof of the Burrow with Ginny, passing a bottle of Firewhiskey back and forth between them. The first year after the war this little section of roof - which could only be accessed by climbing out of Ginny’s bedroom window - had been their escape. They used to come out when neither of them could sleep, just to sit and look at the stars.
Harry nodded helplessly.
“Erm… Well…” Harry shrugged. Was he freaking out? He thought he probably should be, but the bubbles and Malfoy’s arse had really taken the edge off it, if he was honest.
It was a sentiment that Harry had heard more than once but something about hearing it from Benjy made Harry feel as though a weight had been lifted from his back. “Thanks,” he managed to croak.
She smiled nastily. “But he won tonight?”
Harry perked up at that. “I’ve already explored most of the house but I saw that there was a practice pitch as we were driving in.”
It was one of those freezing, cloudless days that only happen in Scotland, the type of cold that made everything clearer and sharper. The crisp loch air reminded Harry so unbearably of autumn Quidditch games at Hogwarts that he had to close his eyes and take a deep, shuddering breath. It felt like the first time he’d been able to breathe properly in years.
“Probably.” Draco turned to give him a smirk and winced at the movement.
“Hello,” he said warily, trying to remember which Weasley this one belonged to.
They’d rented out a private room at a wizarding restaurant on the Viaduct Harbour, a long stretch of waterfront restaurants and bars bordering a marina full of the biggest, flashiest yachts Harry had ever seen.
“Come on, I want to try mum’s pigs-in-blankets before they run out,” Charlie said, jerking his head towards the kitchen.
The stadium exploded.
“Don’t apologise,” she exclaimed. “Give me the details!”
“Tough luck, Potty,” he called and Harry felt the eyes of the rest of his team on them. “Tell Ginerva I say hello.”
“Thank you for agreeing to be part of this, Angelina,” Draco said primly. “Unlike your betrothed, you are a true gem.”
He sat in his bunk, blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He’d seen Draco from afar at dinner the night before, chatting to some of the Scottish players. Harry watched the back of his head as he leaned in to say something to the person sitting next to him. It felt too much like being back at school, so Harry looked away quickly, embarrassed. It was pathetic how much he missed him. How had he ever thought they could just not speak for the whole competition?
“‘Arry Potter, of course! Draco has told me about you.” Malfoy made a strangled noise.
“Well,” Hermione started. They all turned to look at her. “You could speak to Pansy. I know it’s not ideal but she did speak to you about him once. She might be able to give you some insight into what he’s going through.”
As Ron went to brush his teeth, Harry lay in bed and stared out the window. It felt as though the weight of everything was pushing him into his mattress, and the memories from the night before were flowing back slowly, filling him with an ever-increasing sense of dread. Malfoy and the Quidditch game were stressful enough but Harry couldn’t help but think that the whole heir of Slytherin business was bound to get more complicated. This year was turning out to be almost as bad as last.
“You did what?” Harry stared at him.
Harry eventually dragged himself out of bed and brushed his teeth while Malfoy continued to preen himself in the mirror. Harry watched with morbid interest as he applied a series of expensive-looking potions to his hair.
He rolled over and pulled the blanket up over his head too, which did nothing to drown out the sound of Malfoy laughing at him.
“You’re Harry Potter,” the gentleman said, blinking slowly.
“And whose fault is that?” Draco asked. “Fortunately for you, I asked Una to whip us up some breakfast.”
At around ten-thirty, Harry was on his third glass of Firewhisky and second bowl of pudding when he heard a familiar voice and looked up to see the smiling face of Benjy Williams making his way across the living room towards him. He pulled Harry up and into a strong, firm hug.
“Well, stop it. It’s weird.” Malfoy actually sounded put out, which was very confusing.
“Merlin, Pansy, you shouldn’t sneak up like that,” Draco complained.
He managed to get inside and to the table without further incident and settled in for what was essentially one long panic attack. Beth was lovely and pretty, but she was very, very shy and quiet. Combined with Harry’s crippling awkwardness, it turned out to be one of the most stilted and uncomfortable evenings of Harry’s life. When dinner finally ended, he made a weak excuse and escaped as quickly as possible.
Harry groaned and buried his face in his folded arms.
Harry’s mouth felt dry. The real question was: how had he never asked himself this before? It wasn’t as if he had been consciously ignoring it. It just had never occurred to him.
Once breakfast was finished, he went to check on Draco. When he gently pushed open the door between their rooms, he found the man in question gingerly sipping on a mug of hot tea. He glanced up when he heard Harry come in.
They finished their breakfast in silence and then Draco suggested that they go for a fly.
Harry worked his arm free from around Draco’s waist and pushed it between them, gripping Draco’s dick. It was an awkward angle because his face was still pressed against Draco’s neck, but the noises Draco was making made it worthwhile.
Harry felt red-hot and shaky. “Fuck you, Malfoy.”
She gave him another blinding smile. “We talk more about this later, yes?”
“What is Master Potter doing in here?” Kreacher had appeared at the door, looking in suspiciously, as if he expected to find Harry up to no good.
Harry gave her a small smile. “Thanks, Gin. I’d like that.”
Filch was coming closer and closer to their cubicle and Harry took a deep breath, sure that at any minute he would be dragged out by the scruff of his neck.
“Don’t pretend to be even more of an imbecile than you already are, Potter,” Malfoy drawled.
He had to admit though that he had never really considered how difficult it must have been for Malfoy to come back to Britain. He had of course seen the headlines, but Harry had been far too busy being annoyed to consider that it might have been difficult for him within the team. Harry hoped that Angelina was wrong about him having a hard time with the Magpies but he wasn’t naive. He knew what Quidditch players could be like.
“Seriously.” Harry tugged the blanket up to cover his bare chest a bit more. “Why would you think that me and Angelina… that we’re…” He made an aborted motion with his hands.
Parvati had been Harry’s agent for about a year and a half, taking over from her mother Priya just after the World Cup debacle. He tried not to dwell on why he had been palmed off to the younger Patil because it turned out she was actually a brilliant agent, despite her inexperience, and significantly less scary than her mother.
“Are you alright?” Harry began to stand up to get help but Draco put out a hand to stop him.
“It is not!” Harry was properly blushing now. “It’s for me.” He’d forgotten Ginny’s ability to see through him like a window.
“I’m are going to bend you over the sofa and fuck you until we can no longer remember what Quidditch is, let alone the score of my game,” Draco breathed against his neck, and Harry swallowed, equally nervous and thrilled.
“What if that’s not what I want?” Harry asked, a little desperately.
Face burning, Harry raised a hand to the audience, and they exploded into cheers and applause.
“They’re just the same everywhere. It fucks with my head.” Harry stared at the ceiling.
“It’s alright, Angelina,” Harry replied, grinning. “I think Draco secretly enjoys the attention.”
“Not a big deal.”
Harry laughed and gave him a wave but headed inside without stopping.
“She’s terrifying is what she is,” Harry replied. “She was having a go at me about my bloody cufflinks. How did she see that I wasn’t wearing them from all the way across the room?”
“Charming. Is this how you usually treat the people you fuck? Because if so I have news,” Malfoy grumbled, rubbing his side.
The quiet was eventually broken unceremoniously by Harry’s stomach rumbling. Draco snorted. “Time for breakfast, is it?”
“Why?” Harry blinked at him, trying to get in focus.
“...and you know, they have no pupils at all. Also…” Harry blinked, trying to reorient himself. She gave him a funny look. “Are you alright?”
As far as Quidditch Christmases went, it wasn’t the worst.
“Why do we have to counter it?” Harry asked. “Can’t he just make a fool of himself on his own?”
It had all been going well for the first two periods. He and Malfoy had maintained a polite distance, hovering above the action. Puddlemere had been looking strong and they were up 40-10. Then he spotted it.
“Suit yourself.” Draco looked embarrassed but pleased at the same time.
“Raphaël,” Malfoy supplied helpfully.
“So,” Draco said, once he’d swallowed the bite. “What do you want?”
“Details?” he asked weakly.
The Scottish team’s uniforms were light blue with a white saltire across the front and blue robes over top. They stood out well against the grey day. Harry’s eyes scanned the team until he found the little white-blond head.
“Hold on, it looks like the Potter and Malfoy feud is coming to a head!”
The bathrooms were huge and covered floor to ceiling in black tile, reminding Harry of the inside of a snake’s stomach - which was a little bit too close to home, if he was honest.
Harry loved Puddlemere’s home ground. The stadium, training grounds and meeting rooms were the only place outside of his house and Hermione’s and Ron’s place that he felt truly safe and comfortable. He spent so much of his time there it sometimes felt like a second home. He’d even slept a few nights on the sofa in the captain's office after things had ended with Ginny. He always experienced a sense of absolute peace wash over him when he stepped through the gates. It was quaint and homely in a way that other clubs weren't, and he’d known the first time he’d set foot in there that it was the right place for him.
“Erm, yes.” Harry had no idea what to make of the little man. He was looking directly up into Harry’s face as if searching for something. His dark brown eyes were so surrounded by wrinkles that they seemed in danger of disappearing into his face.
Draco rolled his eyes, “You just don’t know how to manage a house like this. It needs a firm hand.”
He spent the next hour curled up in one of those armchairs engrossed in a book about the 1809 World Cup called Attack of the Killer Forest.
“Firstly, as his agent I need to ask you to leave Draco alone.” Harry blinked at her, but she wasn’t done. “I know that this is all very new and exciting to you but he has a career to worry about.”
“I just wanted to say… Well, the thing is...” Harry knew he sounded like an idiot but he couldn’t stop and was relieved when Malfoy cut him off.
She didn’t look convinced. “It was rude of him to bring someone back to the room? I thought you two were getting on a bit better the past week?”
where to shove their invitation.”
It had been a few months since the disastrous game against Montrose, and the press was having a field day with the feud between them.
Something in the conversation felt as though it had slipped sideways and out of control and so Harry made his escape from the bathroom as fast as he could and got dressed quickly, deciding that he’d get an early morning workout in.
“Oi, hands off my wife,” Ron said, swatting Harry’s head as he walked into the kitchen, then paused when he saw Hermione’s face. “Everything alright?”
“Ah, yes,” Krum nodded. “ Quidditch first. I think this too for very long time.”
“It was about me leaving and him bringing the bloke back to the room,” he mumbled miserably.
Harry shrugged, leaning against the doorframe.
He dropped his suitcases in the hallway, calling out a greeting to Kreacher, and, on a whim, walked over to the door to the front room, throwing it open. It was a bleak sight. The air smelled musty and dank and the curtains were closed, giving the impression of a dark cave.
“What have ya got there?” the wizard asked, peering at the magazine in Harry’s hands. “Ah! Benjy Williams, an excellent Seeker.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He paid the bird quickly and then retreated back to bed with the letter. It was addressed to him and when he turned it over he saw that it was sealed with the crest of the English National Quidditch team. Heart pounding, Harry wrapped the blankets around him tightly and began to read.
Hesitantly, he moved his other hand to Malfoy’s jaw, and then to his cheek, brushing his thumb over the smooth skin of his ridiculous cheekbones, which he could feel hollowing and filling.
“Jealous?”
They shared one more bruising kiss before Malfoy grabbed Harry’s hand and pushed him through the crowd towards the back exit. They burst through it into the mild night. Malfoy began to walk in the direction of their hotel but Harry was still holding his hand and used it to drag him back and into his arms.
“So,” Harry said, a little breathlessly. He felt drunker than he should be. “Are you going to apologise?”
“Eloquent as always,” Malfoy smirked and so Harry dug his elbow into his ribs. “Fuck, you have bony elbows.”
“Yes?” Harry was starting to feel a bit judged. “I am capable of change, you know.”
“Yeah..erm definitely,” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly and violently wishing he could go back to Grimmauld Place and his own bed. “Sorry, Angelina, but I think I’m going to head back to the hotel. I have a bit of a headache.”
They didn’t say much of anything else for at least another hour.
“Cheers.” Malfoy laughed and turned to roll his eyes at Harry, then paused at the look on Harry’s face. “Oh, you’re serious?”
The wizarding part of the building included a courtyard that could only be accessed from the elevator with a password.
Wood cut him off, “You’re playing the same position, you’ll have the same schedule. I’m not having this argument with you right now, Harry.”
“You alright?” came the mumble from his left. Draco turned to see, as he did every morning, Harry Potter’s sleep-soft face blinking at him, the imprint of the pillow creased on his brown cheek. Without his glasses, his eyes looked even bigger than usual. Draco’s heart swelled with a frankly embarrassing amount of fondness knowing at that moment he was the only thing in the world Harry could see.
Malfoy actually looked taken aback. “Merlin, is that what this is about? Are you serious?”
“I just feel like I was meant to be an Auror. It’s what people expect me to do.”
“Are you just going to watch?” Draco asked, and somehow the little hint of embarrassment in his voice made Harry ache all over.
“Fuck yes, I am! Why aren’t you?” she asked, jamming her finger into his chest. He shrugged and she immediately pushed her half-full drink into his hand. “Drink up, big boy.”
To anyone thinking of doing a fest: I never thought I'd be able to do something like this and I did, so if I can you can too!
“I just…” Oh, Merlin. “I’ve never…” Harry stammered gesturing between them inelegantly.
“Fuck off,” Harry spat back.
Finally, he made it to the English camp. It was only half full as the players were still arriving. They’d designed it to feel like an English village, Ron had told Harry, with small cottages surrounding a square. There was even a village pub, despite the fact that Davies had explicitly banned them from drinking under any circumstances.
“I thought you worked in entertainment news, not sports,” he said, a bit nastily. “What, the rumour mill running a bit low on poor sods to prey on?”
Draco glowered at Harry, who very maturely stuck his tongue out in reply.
The hotel in Prague was nice but bare, just a bed and a bathroom. As soon as he walked in Harry felt that familiar loneliness sink into his bones. He could go out, but most of the team were turning in early before they left in the morning so he would be alone in a city where he didn’t speak the language. It wasn’t the most appealing thought.
“Bugger off.” Harry pulled his blanket over his head and burrowed back down into the sheets.
Malfoy let out a little huff of laughter. “Find out what? That I’m sexually active?”
Harry rubbed his arm, grumbling. “I didn’t even ask a question.”
“Yes, but I still have no idea how the hell you did that,” Harry laughed.
Harry frowned. “That’s only one thing.”
“You could have renewed it though, or gone somewhere else. Surely the Magpies weren’t the only team who wanted you?”
Draco had a movement that looked like it was meant to be a shrug but turned into a wince halfway through. “Just wonderful, thanks.”
“Because she’s observant.” Ginny held up Harry’s arm by the sleeve and inspected his cuff. “You really should be wearing some, you know.”
He took Harry through the wooden gates and down the road to the first of the other structures. It was a long stone building, not as big as the keep but equipped for living nonetheless. Behind it was the practice pitch, which Harry could now see also included a generous equipment shed and changing rooms.
“What’s happening here?” he asked in that blank tone but there was a challenge in his eyes. Harry was gratified to hear a slight breathlessness to it.
It was just because he hadn’t had sex in a long time - that had to be it. The last person he’d been with was after a date that Wood had set him up on, a few months after the breakup. He’d been too emotionally raw and she had been in awe of him, which was not, as it turned out, a winning combo for sex. So, he hadn’t had fulfilling sex in almost a year and a half. That had to be a contributing factor, didn’t it?
“M’sorry,” he muttered, blinking up at him sheepishly.
About an hour later he found himself sitting between Camille and Cormac in a booth near the back overlooking the dancefloor. Cormac was trying his best to get the French model’s attention but she didn’t seem to notice, too wrapped up in her conversation with Malfoy.
Krum chuckled wryly. “Not happy, but happy for you.”
“You alright?” Harry asked, noticing for the first time how pale Ron looked.
After a few minutes of thorough ravaging which left Harry’s carefully selected outfit very dishevelled, Draco pulled away and glanced around the room, seeming to realise for the first time that he was somewhere new.
“Next time?” Harry felt his throat tighten.
“I’ve been standing here for about three minutes,” she countered, an unimpressed look on her face. Harry felt his cheeks heat up.
He’d hardly spoken or eaten for the first month, just slept and watched the tapes of the game over and over again until Hermione and Ron had put their collective foot down and moved him into their spare room. Ginny had tried her best, but she had a career too and she had never been very good at traversing the darker paths his thoughts took.
Roger Davies had been good-looking at school, but six years of being a professional Chaser had turned his puppy fat into hard muscles and given him the broadest shoulders Harry had ever seen in real life - not to mention the impressive moustache. He’d amassed a sizable fan club over the years, but since becoming captain of Puddlemere United a year ago there was hardly a young witch or wizard who didn’t have his moustachioed face hung on their wall. He was also annoyingly skilled at Quidditch, tapped to be the youngest English captain ever at the next World Cup.
“Oh, brilliant,” he breathed, immediately drawn into an antique edition of
“Oh, Christ,” he heard himself gasp, biting down hard on his hand to stop himself from coming then and there. When he had control of himself, he moved very slightly deeper, and felt more than heard the noise that Draco made.
She directed him to a seat opposite and sat back down, tucking a lock of her long dark hair behind one ear.
If Harry had hoped that that experience was enough to deter Draco he was wrong because he was already reaching for another book, bound with something that looked suspiciously like hair.
Malfoy thankfully didn’t speak again for a while as he unpacked his suitcase. Harry resisted watching but the ceiling wasn’t very interesting and after a few minutes of staring at it he found his gaze wandering inadvertently.
Harry hadn’t taken Dreamless Sleep in months but he needed to turn his brain off, so he grabbed a vial out of his bag and downed it. It took a few moments to take hold and the only thing he could think of before the potion took hold was the look in Malfoy's eyes when he looked down at him.
He resolved to put his head down and focus on winning, and so that was what he did, right up until he came into the dressing room to get changed for the last practice before the final and found Angelina and Ron pouring over a brightly coloured magazine.
“Hi Chanel,” the team droned in unison.
“You’re back early,” Harry said before he could stop himself.
“Um.” Harry was drawing a blank. “For messing everything up?”
Malfoy nodded his acknowledgement, his eyebrows practically in his fringe.
“Shit,” Harry said with another laugh. He couldn’t quite believe that this was an actual issue he was having in his life. “What am I going to do?”
“What?” She looked a little annoyed but mostly confused. “You’re leaving?”
“Nothing,” Harry stifled another chuckle. He certainly couldn’t explain it to him. “You know, you’re a lot less of an arse off the pitch.”
“It’s not like that,” Harry sighed. “They’re nice now, but the headlines were brutal when Ginny and I broke up, and it only gets worse when I’m seen out with girls.”
Harry shook his head, and then tugged on Malfoy’s arm until he sank onto the floor next to him, leaning his back against the wall. “I’m fine. I just need to rest for a moment, then we can keep talking.”
“Hi,” Draco said.
“Hello Rose,” he said solemnly, shaking her hand with his free one. “How do you do?”
“Do you have anything to say about Malfoy’s play?” Rita Skeeter asked innocently.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said miserably. “I shouldn’t have kept you a secret. I shouldn’t have assumed that we were on the same page.”
Most of the blowjobs Harry had received in his life had taken place either standing up or in bed under the covers, lying flat on his back. He’d never considered how much more intimate it would be to be sitting up like this, how much closer they would be. He didn’t even need to extend his arm to touch Malfoy, to run his hands over his back and wrap his fingers in his hair.
Harry wasn’t sure what he meant by that but he didn’t have time to find out because the Snitch had reappeared less than 100 metres away, hovering above the Magpies' stands. This time he didn’t waste any time trying to be subtle, he just took off, Malfoy hot on his heels.
It was Harry’s turn to smile then. “You deserved it.”
“If you don’t stop repeating me, I’m going to shove you back into the fireplace.”
Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes on him. They were an hour into the game and both teams were playing excellently, but Harry could barely pay attention because Malfoy was everywhere, watching. It made Harry furious, and not the useful kind of furious. He could feel Malfoy hovering just out of his periphery, and it felt like he was breathing down Harry’s neck. Harry twisted and flew up, trying to put some space between them.
Draco smirked. Harry might be the saviour of the wizarding world but Draco was the only person in the world who could make him blush like that. He squeezed Harry tightly, relishing the solid weight of him. He loved him so much that he sometimes wanted to squeeze him until he burst.
Harry wasn’t sure what he expected to see in Draco’s face - anger or sadness or shame. What he didn’t expect was joy. Draco looked at him (with the widest smile Harry had ever seen) for less than half a second as if to say: “You did it!”
“But, er, I’m not complaining because it’s fine,” he tried.
They were so close, neck and neck, shoulders pressed together as they jostled. Harry could practically feel the feathers brushing his fingertips, when Malfoy did something strange.
They were sent off in the direction of the sitting room, and Draco and Harry were kept busy welcoming a steady stream of Weasleys and their various partners and children. Last to arrive were Charlie Weasley, Viktor Krum and their daughter Ana, a small, dark-haired six-year-old who shook Harry and Draco’s hands solemnly.
He turned to see Draco in the doorway, watching him with some amusement.
She raised an enormous eyebrow at him. “Can I?”
He glanced down at his wrist, he knew exactly where his cufflinks were, on the dresser in his bedroom, but there was no use telling Mrs Patil that. “Right, thanks. I’ll get right onto that,” he mumbled.
Malfoy didn’t reply but he turned around fully and leaned back, bracing his elbows against the rails, still cradling his glass in one hand. The light from the room, which had looked ethereal on his back, made his chest and torso look like they were cut from marble. Harry had the inexplicable urge to reach out and touch the skin, to see if it would be as smooth and cold as it looked.
Ron was rapidly turning a shade of red that, in Harry’s opinion, did not look healthy. “Harry…” he started, sounding choked. ‘What are you… What’s Malfoy doing here?”
“What?” Harry felt his neck redden. “No, of course not!”
“Oh.” Lucy blinked up at him, and then her brow furrowed. “You’re sort of my aunt. Will you teach me?”
“You’re a git,” Malfoy replied grumpily, and Harry had to bite his cheek to stop himself from laughing. Malfoy was silent for such a long time that Harry thought perhaps he’d fallen asleep but then: “I hate hotel rooms too.” His tone was uncharacteristically vulnerable.
He looked good, in dark grey shorts with long black compression leggings and a black long sleeve Magpies shirt, all of which hugged his strong body beautifully.
“Sorry, I really don’t.” Harry took a large swig of beer in the vain hope that it would settle his nerves.
Harry swallowed. He couldn’t form a coherent thought, let alone speak. He couldn’t even answer that question in his own head. Their lips were so close together - did he want Malfoy to kiss him? Did he want to punch him? Malfoy leaned in even closer, their mouths a hair’s breadth apart, and Harry closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable.
At first, Malfoy was completely still, and Harry thought for one horrible second that he had made an enormous mistake. Finally, he made a noise that had Harry’s stomach flipping over. Malfoy pressed into him, a hand coming up to wind into Harry’s hair. It wasn’t like any kiss that Harry had ever had. It was an explosion, the release of a pressure that had been building up for far longer than he had ever realised. His hands were all over Malfoy, in his hair, on his neck, gripping onto his back.
“Don’t apologise,” Draco said shakily. His eyes were very wide as he looked at Harry with sympathy that he couldn’t bear, and he let go of Harry’s arm to grab his hand.
“Go away,” he called grumpily, but the knocking came again, more insistent this time. “Oh for fuck sake…” he grumbled, dragging himself out of bed to open the door.
They watched each other quietly and he realised that it was the first time they had really been alone in a very long time. She was just as beautiful as she had always been, the wind whipping through her shoulder-length hair. She had some kind of green glitter on her eyelids and it made her eyes look even bigger and browner than usual. She reached out and tucked a lock of his hair behind his ear and for a moment he was so tempted to lean forward and kiss her, like muscle memory.
Harry flushed. “I really am sorry about that, but you have to admit that you were trying to get me to do it.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said again. “Maybe I want something different now.”
Malfoy didn’t turn around or reply, so Harry stepped out onto the balcony and leaned on the railing beside him. The night stretched out before them, the lights tracing the shape of the hills that wrapped around the city like fairy-light covered arms. On the other side the ocean was just inky blackness, as though someone had forgotten to colour that part in. Harry felt lightheaded.
“Draco,” he said, hair hanging down slightly over one eye. “My lovers call me Draco.”
Harry had to fight with every inch of his might not to blow up. “As I said before, I’m here to talk about Quidditch. If you don’t want to ask me about that, I can leave.”
The Wellington Wizards were a strong team but Harry was playing well. He spent the first half watching the other Seeker and mapping out his game plan, and then five minutes into the second half he spied it. The Snitch was up high, almost at the edge of the airspace. The Wizard’s Seeker hadn’t seen it but she had clearly seen Harry see it because she was tracking him. This meant that he couldn’t fly towards the Snitch without her seeing it, and she was far closer.
“You started without me,” he said, aiming for teasing but it came out more plaintive.
It was the bag from the magazine shop in Melbourne, he realised with glee. He reckoned they were a good way to waste some time so he tipped the contents onto the bed. Out fell the Cannons magazine for Ron, the Quidditch Daily with Benjy on the cover, and something else. Harry reached out for the third magazine curiously - he only remembered buying two - and was greeted by the sight of Malfoy’s mostly naked body. Harry felt like he was on fire.
Ron let out a long breath. “Fucking hell, I’m a lucky man.”
Malfoy’s mouth twisted into that smirk that made him look like his twelve-year-old self. “That’s not very sportsmanlike.”
The bar was a somewhat seedy establishment, with dirty looking pool tables and a large dance floor that was almost filled to bursting.
“Alright!” O'Flaherty rubbed her hands together. “What you’re not going to do is ask for Butterbeer or Firewhiskey or anything like that, okay? Just ask for whatever IPA they have on tap and then get out of there as fast as possible.”
Harry could do nothing but laugh and allow himself to be debauched against the china cabinet in his sitting room.
Harry had to read the message twice to process what it said. Draco was coming over. Draco was coming over to Grimmauld Place. Draco was coming over to Grimmauld Place in less than four hours. He glanced around the room, taking in the piles of takeaway containers and thick cobwebs in the curtains, and then down at the chow mein stain on the hem of his t-shirt.
Instead of answering Harry’s question, Draco pulled the blankets up over their heads, trapping out the world. He smiled quietly to himself when Harry reached out and dragged him closer, burrowing his face in Draco’s neck. Draco ran his hand down Harry’s back, across his broad shoulders and up through his hair. He smelled like sleep and the horrible 3-in-1 shampoo- conditioner-body wash he insisted on using. Draco had tried to throw it away countless times but it always managed to reappear in their bathroom. That was a relief, if he was honest: secretly he would miss the smell if he ever managed to get rid of it for good.
The doors opened again a second later and he stalked out, through the lobby and out into the night again. It wasn’t midnight yet so the level of drunkenness on the street had yet to become unbearable. For a moment, Harry considered going back out to a bar. He tried to remember the direction of the pub they’d been to earlier in the night but his stomach began to rumble loudly, so he decided to make his way up the street towards a brightly coloured sign that promised coffee and cakes.
“What’s that?” he asked, putting his bag down and wandering over to them.
When he opened his eyes again it was morning and he was in a bed. He sat up and then immediately regretted it when his stomach rolled dangerously.
It was only then that he noticed the deafening silence in the stadium, and the fact that gameplay had stopped as players on both sides stared at him in astonishment.
“Oh,” he blinked. “Yeah, you look, erm - really, really nice.” He gave a thumbs up, which he hoped looked less awkward than it felt. “Ron will be really happy,” he tacked on for good measure.
Draco’s mouth twitched, “Sorry to disappoint.”
“Yeah,” Harry swallowed, looking down at his hand that was now clenched into a fist.
He made his way shakily over to the bar and poured himself a large Firewhisky. Just as he was taking a swig Ginny appeared in front of him with her hands on her hips.
He shook his head at her but took the drink anyway - he had never been any good at saying no to her - and was rewarded with another hearty smack on the shoulder.
“I don’t care.” She inspected her nails carefully. “You of all people should understand the need for him to focus on Quidditch right now. Any distraction of negative publicity could undo years of hard work.”
With some difficulty, Harry managed to extract his arm from the tangle and lifted it, Snitch clutched in his fist.
“Well, we had a bit of a row when I came back to the room afterwards,” Harry admitted sheepishly.
“Tsk tsk, Mr Potter! We were just getting there.” She flicked her hand at the Quick-Quotes Quill again and it seemed to speed up. “Draco Malfoy - you two are currently engaged in a very public feud, correct?”
He crossed the room in a few strides and pulled her into the tightest hug he dared.
“No, but you are best competitor. Would have won if not for Bludger.”
“Hello,” he started, shocked by how hoarse his voice sounded to his own ears. “I’d like to get a room. Well, I already have a room, but I’d like another one.”
Malfoy snatched the camera out of Crabbe’s hands and stood up, a self-satisfied grin on his face.
He watched as the photo Malfoy winked at the camera over and over. It wasn’t as if Harry had never seen him with his shirt off - in fact, he’d probably seen him like that every day in the past month - but there was something different about being able to drink his fill of looking without any danger of being caught.
Harry almost jumped out of his skin for the second time that night. “Jesus, Ginny, don’t sneak up on me like that.”
Of course, the Cannons won the match. Gudgeon barely even broke a sweat grabbing the s
“Everything alright, Cap?” he asked, trying to sound cheerful.
“I just needed to take a moment. Thanks for the bubbles.” Draco leaned back into Harry, turning his head to press his lips the soft skin under Harry’s ear.
“Screw you,” He spat furiously. “At least my parents liked me.”
It was too overcast to see anything tonight, but it was still as lovely as Harry remembered it.
“I hope you’re trying to set them on fire. That’s the only way to improve them.”
“Alright, you two! Pull yourselves together, I have wisdom to impart,” Davies announced in his most authoritative tone. He stood at his full height, hands clasped behind his back, and Harry had to admit he looked like a captain.
Draco was lying on the bed, legs spread, stroking himself lazily. He looked at Harry with something like pride or challenge when their eyes met. Harry watched, frozen, as a pretty blush spread up his pale chest.
Harry had been sitting next to her, clutching the letter emblazoned with the Aurors department logo in one clammy hand and one from Puddlemere United in the other, looking out at the rest of his life laying itself out in front of him.
“Very fragile,” he nodded wisely, and then caught sight of someone over Harry’s shoulder and his face broke into the widest smile Harry had ever seen on him. He turned to see who Krum was looking at and was surprised to see Charlie Weasley making his way through the crowd towards them.
Harry felt a warmth sinking into his bones. “Are we friends again, then?”
Harry jumped slightly, Malfoy’s voice tearing him from his fantasies. He blushed. “I…” He stammered. “I wasn’t ogling… I was admiring your technique.”
“Sure you weren’t.” She patted his hand in a manner that he assumed was meant to be reassuring but decidedly wasn’t.
“Give me your other hand,” he said with a put upon tone, but when Harry looked back at his face there were two little spots of pink on his cheeks. Harry watched as he threaded the other link through the cuff, his long, agile fingers deftly twisting it through.
“How’s your arm after that game against Wimbourne last week?” Ron slapped Harry on the back, making him choke on his pastry. “Catching the Snitch when it was right next to Williams’ head was brilliant. I thought he was actually going to cry.”
Malfoy was the seeker.
Harry felt his words like a slap. “I want you,” he insisted pathetically.
“That’s really what you want to use your question for?”
“Nah, don’t worry! It’s way more common than you would think,” she said as she motioned for him to follow her into another room where most of the rest of the team were milling about.
The rest of the competition went by in a blur but neither Puddlemere or the Magpies made it to the final so Harry didn’t get a chance to see Draco again before he went home.
“Alright, alright,” he laughed. “My contract was up, you know that.”
“Well, I am actually Scottish through my grandmother on my father’s side. Her sister - my great aunt - is the one who left Lochinvar Castle to me. She died about a year ago, without an heir, so she left it to me.”
It was like he had created a file in his brain where he stored up things throughout the day to talk to Draco about, and now it was overflowing. If there had been any reception at all Harry would have tried to call him by now, but as it was he had to make do with looking at the back of his head in the dining hall.
Ron cleared his throat gruffly. “I suppose that just about covers it.” He reached out and patted Harry’s shoulder firmly. “I just wanted to say that even though it’s Malfoy, I’ll make an effort to like him.”
“So, what have I said this time?” He looked at Harry expectantly.
“Today’s the day,” he said softly, the vibrations of his voice humming along Draco’s spine.
Harry made an indignant noise. “Alright, there’s no need for that.”
“Alright.” Harry had to swallow down a lump in his throat. “If that’s how you want to be.”
“This should help with the headache, Mr Malfoy. You have some damage to your skull and a pretty hefty concussion from the Bludger. We’ll monitor you tonight and check back in tomorrow morning. Hopefully we’ll have you back home in no time.” She gave Draco a kind smile and began to head towards the door.
“Different is good,” Krum grinned at him, uncharacteristically wolfish. “Anyway, not look too different in gym.”
“It feels like everything is vibrating very, very slightly,” Harry said and then flushed when Malfoy snorted. “What?” He demanded, turning to look at Malfoy defensively.
“I’m always here to bully you, Harry,” she grinned. “But yes I’ll show you.”
“Then who…?”
“Fucking shitty Muggle technology,” Harry muttered from where Malfoy had him pinned up against the door. He fumbled in his back pocket for the key card. Malfoy didn’t respond because he was sucking on Harry’s neck in a highly distracting fashion, which wasn’t helping Harry's search.
“You’d better make a beeline for the kitchen before the children see you,” Arthur said conspiratorially, guiding Harry’s shoulders in that direction.
He was right. There is truly nothing worse, in Harry’s humble opinion, than waking up wearing jeans and a belt. It felt similar to what he imagined it would be like to wake up in a straitjacket. He tried to get them off without opening his eyes, but he was still lying on his front so he only succeeded in nearly falling in a tangled heap on the floor. With deep annoyance, he opened his eyes and winced at the morning light streaming through his open curtains. He finally managed to get his jeans and t-shirt off, throwing them on the floor and immediately flopping back onto the bed. He closed his eyes again, trying desperately to slip back into sleep, but to no avail. He’d entered the land of the living, and his head hurt - like it always did. In frustration, he threw one of his pillows at the window. This, unfortunately, caused one of his potted plants to topple over, souring his mood even further.
Harry didn’t wait to be asked twice and climbed in. Hermione wasn’t wrong - they were bloody delicious. Ron had been practising cooking a lot recently. Harry suspected it was his coping mechanism for being stuck between his future wife and his mother when it came to making wedding decisions.
When the of his teammates had filed into the showers Harry finally couldn’t take it anymore and got up to go for another angry fly around the pitch. He stomped out the door, and straight into Draco Malfoy. He was gratified to see that his opponent was just as sweaty and gross as him, but that was about all he could be grateful for.
Draco ignored him. “Don’t you have a house-elf? Most of these old houses do.”
Malfoy pushed him away, holding Harry’s head up with the hand in his hair so that he looked up at him. “Hotel,” he mouthed.
Harry ducked out of the tent. It was always nice to see Lee but he really wasn’t in the mood to chat about anything, particularly Draco Malfoy. Ever since he’d got back from Scotland about a month ago his patience had been at an all-time low; the slightest provocation and he flew right off the handle.
Harry didn’t have the energy to snap back at him. “The real issue is that I forgot my cufflinks and Mrs Patil is going to hex me.”
They made their way back to Draco’s rooms, where a light breakfast was laid out on the table in the corner.
At the mention of his name, she turned to Harry, wide-eyed. “Mr Harry Potter, it is an honour to have you at Lochinvar Castle. Master Draco is telling Una a great many things about you over the years.”
cover.
Malfoy gripped his hand tightly, using it to pull Harry towards him a step. “I never had you pegged for a sore loser, Potter.”
“I think Hermione means going to a park or a pub or something,” Ron added unhelpfully.
“What? No, of course not!” Harry felt his face getting hot. “It’s just that I’ve never… Well, you know…”
“Hi,” Harry breathed, heart racing. “Sorry, I thought you were Angelina or Ron.”
“Are you going to do it then?” Malfoy hissed. His cheeks were flushed.
Malfoy made a dismissive noise. “Regardless, you started it.”
Ginny let out a hysterical bark of laughter, and Harry started to feel properly annoyed. “Oh, I’m not trying to be mean. It's just… You’re terrible at change. Worst I’ve ever known. By a mile.”
There was a moment of shocked silence.
“Okay,” Malfoy laughed and then held up his glass. “To good decisions.”
Krum shrugged. “You play well. Is not embarrassing to lose to best player.”
Ron nodded. “That makes sense, I guess.” He paused for a moment and then spoke again, quieter. “Do you feel protective over him?”
“Why?”
“Oh, but I think you do.” Malfoy’s voice was low and teasing. Harry couldn’t figure out if he was being made fun of or not. He decided it was safer to assume that he was.
“How do you forget cufflinks? I swear, Potter, you’d forget your head if it wasn’t attached.” He came over and inspected Harry’s sleeve and sighed. “These robes really do need cufflinks, you know.” He seemed to consider something for a moment and then undid his own and held them out to Harry.
Draco’s mouth twisted into a smug little grin, and it made Harry want to kiss him, so he did.
“I feel like eating in the kitchen today,” he announced so Harry shrugged on a hoodie and they made their way down the narrow stone staircase to the kitchens.
“Hi. I’m just hoping to buy a mobile phone,” Harry tried, hoping he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
She smiled ruefully and took her hand back, tucking it into her lap. “Yeah, I know what you mean. It’s been weird not being able to talk to you. I don’t want to get back together or anything, though, just to be clear.”
Harry was equally gratified and disturbed to see Malfoy looking rather haggard at the Portkey terminal in the morning. He had slept in uncharacteristically late and obviously rushed through his morning routine. Harry, on the other hand, had managed to squeeze in a workout and a full breakfast. He felt quite pleased with himself.
He checked in on Draco every hour or so but in between he explored. The weather was still awful so he didn’t venture out of the keep but by the end of the second day he had almost completely covered the second and third floors.
“Wait, Draco…” Harry called after him desperately but he was gone.
“Do you think Malfoy would mind if I asked her for a boogie?” Cormac was asking, but Harry wasn’t listening.
“I’ll take these two please,” he said politely.
Had they really said those things to each other? He had a flash of memory: Malfoy looking at him with a piercing intensity as if daring him to step closer and... do what? Even in his own head, Harry couldn’t put the words together.
Strangely enough, he sort of did, so he nodded and let her drag him out of the bar. Luckily everyone else was either on the dance floor or too drunk to notice them leaving together.
“I only ask because I’ve heard that you haven’t been back coaching the junior Puddles.”
Harry made his way first to the cafe for a coffee and then to the apothecary for some hangover potion. All these nights out were burning through his store at a frankly terrifying pace.
When they were finished eating the plates disappeared.
The next time they saw each other was for the European Cup playoffs in France. As the two top teams in the United Kingdom and Ireland, Puddlemere and Montrose were invited to participate alongside teams from a dozen other countries.
That same feeling coursed through him as he stared down at the magazine.
-----
“You’ll come back?” he asked quietly, his eyes wide and worried.
“What’s fine?”
The rest of the press conference went very smoothly after that and before long it was time to cut the ribbon and officially open the school for business.
“The flattery never ends,” He turned slightly and cocked his head. “Look, if you really want it back, you can duel me for it.”
“I like being at home,” Harry said defensively.
Then a horrible thought struck him, what if Malfoy told people Harry had kissed him? That would be awful, he would never hear the end of it from the Slytherins and it would be humiliating having the whole school think he had a thing for Malfoy. Which he didn’t. Right? That was a whole can of worms Harry wasn’t brave enough to open, did he like Malfoy? He was pretty certain he didn’t. He’d never really liked anyone before, other than an actress he’d seen on television at the Dursley’s on an odd occasion when he’d been allowed to watch. She had been fighting someone in some action movie and Harry had thought about how pretty she was for at least a few days afterwards. But he’d never liked an actual girl or a boy for that matter, and anyway, Malfoy was git of massive proportions, not to mention the fact that he was a boy.
, please?”
Malfoy just sniggered.
“Did you just booty call me, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice was slightly crackly and far away, but Harry could still detect the teasing tone and it made him blush as if he were in the room with him.
“You’re up early.” Draco’s voice made him jump slightly and he turned to find him standing in the doorway in his striped pyjamas and a tartan robe. He looked soft and sleepy, if a little wan.
It was far grander than the guest room, Harry was amused to note. A huge bed with thick green velvet curtains was against the far wall. Draco was already in bed, his hair splayed out against the thick, white pillow and the quilt pulled right up to his chin. He looked so pale that the bags under his eyes were almost purple.
“Because.” Harry felt his throat tighten. “I care about him. I want to know how to fix this.”
“Saving yourself for Weaslette then?” Malfoy asked.
“He won’t.”
“Erm, cheers, Davies.” Harry smiled awkwardly, “I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Hermione works with her at the Ministry. I think she does some stuff with magical creatures.”
Sydney in October was stifling - a dry oppressive heat that seeped into Harry’s bones and made him ache for foggy British mornings. He regretted agreeing to the tour from the moment he grasped the Portkey.
“God,” Harry groaned.
“Hello, I’m Lucy Weasley,” she said politely. “You’re my uncle Draco.”
“Could we… talk?” Harry tried.
Oh Merlin, he glanced up but couldn’t see her parents anywhere. “Alright yes, of course, I’ll teach you.”
Just as he was beginning to get frustrated, he was struck with sudden inspiration. He began to fly towards where the other Seeker was, not aiming at the Snitch but keeping it in the corner of his eye nonetheless. She tracked him carefully and then took off towards him. He waited until she was close enough behind him before turning around and coming to a stop so that they were facing one another. She obviously hadn’t expected this and the concentration on her face lit a light of satisfaction in him. It wasn’t his usual playing style but he could do it.
The referee blew the whistle and they were off.
Harry leant forward, willing Campbell on as he sped like a bullet after the golden ball. He was so close, reaching his hand out with his fingers practically brushing the wings…
“Jesus, Draco…” he breathed. He was so close he could feel his leg shaking. He tapped Malfoy on the shoulder as a warning, as he was unable to form a coherent sound, but it only seemed to encourage him.
“Not so brave without your friends to back you up are you?” Malfoy laughed standing over him with his wand a few inches from Harry’s nose.
The fact that Malfoy was also going to be playing had absolutely nothing to do with it, thank you very much.
“What, you’re telling me you deny yourself that too?”
Without his permission, Harry’s eyes flew to Malfoy, but he was just doing what he had been doing before. Harry watched as he reached up to pick a piece of lint off the other man’s shoulder. It made Harry feel a little sick. He was simultaneously morbidly curious and horrifically embarrassed.
After breakfast, Harry went back to his room and studied some of the diagrams that Davies had sent for pre-World Cup prep. That took about two hours, after which he was out of distractions - no, activities. He felt restless. Part of him wanted to go out and explore but that raised the danger of running into Malfoy - or Angelina, who was definitely growing suspicious. Instead, he settled on lying across his bed with his head hanging off so he could look at the room upside down. From this angle, he could see the dust under the dresser and a pair of his socks that had become wedged under the armchair. As he panned across the room a flash of orange sticking out from under his suitcase caught his eye. He couldn’t for the life of him figure out what it was so he rolled off the bed and tugged it out.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just a bit nervous, you know?” He smiled weakly.
“I thought I was supposed to be one being sick,” Hermione laughed, rubbing his back. Ron sent her an apologetic look, and they all fell silent again.
Harry frowned. He didn't know what Malfoy meant by that. “I do hate hotel rooms, though, so it’s a bit of a catch 22.”
Harry came back over to have a look, much more cautiously this time. Draco was looking at the title page of the first chapter which did have a suspicious-looking stain in one corner, but it was the chapter title that caught Harry’s eye.
Hermione stood and wrapped him in a warm hug that smelled like new parchment and coffee. He took a deep breath and let himself relax into her arms for a second.
He was sure he hadn’t bought it, so the shopkeeper must have slipped a copy in when Harry wasn’t looking. Attempting to dissect why he’d thought Harry would want it was enough to send him back into a spiral so he focused on the magazine instead.
“There are some things more important. Is hard to see now because you want to win, but win does not fix everything.” Harry looked at him skeptically. “There is always Quidditch - every year European Cup, every four years World Cup. But love only come around once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Not good odds.”
Malfoy’s mouth twitched. “I do believe you are.”
“Look, I’m not going to push this. I know you get enough of it from Hermione and Ron. But are you letting yourself have fun?” She looked earnest and worried and it made Harry’s stomach ache.
Harry nodded, still slightly befuddled, and followed Draco into the cab. Sure enough, instead of a regular navigation system, there was just a steering wheel protruding from the smooth dashboard, presumably so that if they began careening off the cliff one could redirect the vehicle. It wasn’t an overly reassuring sight, if Harry was honest, but Draco didn’t seem nervous so he let it go and closed his door.
The United States had raised a few eyebrows with theirs. They’d designed what was essentially an enormous stadium-shaped hotel with a pitch in the middle for their squad. It took up so much of their allocated space that they’d been forced to remove a few of the outside bits, making it look even more like a fortress. They had also been forced to place extra strength silencing charms over it as they’d received so many complaints about their noise levels. Even as Harry walked past he could hear some of the commotion emanating from the middle.
Harry’s stomach did a funny little flip. Despite Draco’s best efforts to teach him he was still absolutely rubbish at flirting.
“Fuck off. Really?”
“I wasn’t trying to scare you.” He shrugged apologetically, even though he kind of had been.
“Uncle Draco,” the child in question cooed. She reached out grabby hands towards him, and he lifted her from Granger’s arms.
“I can’t hear you,” she whined and poked Harry in the forehead.
He landed with a jolt in a small room occupied by a cheerful-looking witch holding a clipboard.
Draco was hardly breathing, watching Harry watch him.
Harry knew he was being given a test. He could leave and pretend this had never happened, or he could lean forward and press his lips to Malfoy’s. When it came down to it, was it even a choice at all?
“Yeah, I suppose not. Surely a trip to Australia can’t be too bad anyway? Even if the ferret is tagging along. Plus it might be good for you to...” He grimaced. “Well, to get away from everything.”
“Good evening, Harry.”
“Oh my goodness, thank you so much. You’ve been playing really, really well too.” Harry started when he felt her hand on his knee.
“It’s called masturbation, Potter.” Harry choked slightly on his own spit but Malfoy wasn’t done. “Wanking, polishing your knob, cracking one off, badgering the witness, self pleasure…”
“That’s stupid,” she replied, not unkindly. “We’re your friends. We’ll be there whenever you need us.”
“At least, don’t become one right now.” She paused, but when he didn’t say anything she barrelled on. “You’ve been saving people for almost your whole life. It isn’t fair.”
Pansy Parkinson and Parvati Patil were the first to arrive, one after the other. They had become reluctant friends the past few years, primarily bonding over their shared frustration at Draco and Harry.
“Well,” Harry swallowed nervously, feeling the anxiety starting to seep back. “I guess I’m not straight then.”
“Right,” Malfoy said, drawing out the word sarcastically. “So you’ve come to… What? Tell me off for speculating about your sexuality? Or lack thereof.”
He tapped his phone against his lip, waiting for a response, but it never came. When Harry woke up on the sofa an unknown amount of time later, there was still no message.
“You know,” she said thoughtfully, seeming to notice that he’d gone a bit quiet. “The only reason we don’t invite you to those anymore is that you never came last year. You’re always welcome.”
“How’s that for dull?” he called back.
Harry didn’t reply. He couldn’t. His chest felt tight and there was a rushing in his ears. Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
“What’s what like?” Harry asked warily.
He gave Parvati an earful over floo as soon as he got home that evening. She assured him that she would manage the situation and ensure that whatever photos were used were flattering, though Harry wasn’t massively optimistic. Still, he was so exhausted from the day that he fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Harry awoke uncharacteristically early. The sun was breaking over the horizon, and he found himself drawn to the window. He wrapped the quilt around himself - the Scottish morning air was sharp - and sat on the deep stone window seat. The golden light was just reaching the edge of the loch when suddenly it caught and the water lit up, sparkling like it was made of jewels.
The ceremony took place in a small clearing of trees about half a mile from the Burrow. The guests sat on wooden pews that Arthur and Mr Granger had spent months building and bonding over. They weren’t the most structurally sound but both men were so proud of them that no one had the heart to criticise them.
“Potter, if you don’t get your hands on the Snitch right now—” The yelling cut off abruptly as Harry ended the inner ear amplification spell with a mutter.
Harry followed him over to a table in a quieter part of the square and sat down across from his best friend.
“Yes, I do.” Harry turned to him finally and found his face unreadable. “You’re underestimating how much help you’ll need.”
“Drink up,” she commanded, and Hermione obeyed meekly.
“Something bothering you, Potter?” Malfoy called, following him.
“It’s not a big deal.”
“That’s not… I mean, I’m not…” he stammered.
“We’re not going to get back together.” Harry rubbed his hand across his eyes.
“Did it work?” he asked.
“I didn’t… How do you?” he stammered and Krum gave him a wry smile.
“Harry! Harry! Malfoy, and the Slytherins! My camera!” He was so panicked that he could barely form a sentence.
“Exactly,” Malfoy sighed. “That’s why I always go out. It’s less depressing to go back to someone's flat, even if you don’t sleep there.”
It took about an hour and another cup of tea for him to get the hang of using the tiny keyboard, and another cup to wrap his head around the snake game, which Ginny assured him was integral to the experience.
Harry snorted and pushed Draco’s face away, his ears going a bit pink. “Shut up.”
He wondered if Pansy had been telling the truth about Diagon Alley. He hoped not but it wasn’t entirely unbelievable; he’d seen the signs that some English fans brought to games. He also knew that she was right that Draco would never come out and ask him directly to stand up for him because deep down he thought he deserved that treatment. Harry considered this. At one point not too long ago he might have thought that Draco deserved it too, but now?
