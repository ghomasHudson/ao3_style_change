When he finished, Narcissa looked at her husband and their old friend. "I think he was flirting but our Draco must be careful to make certain that he is serious about a real relationship. I don't want anyone playing games with my son."
Harry sat doodling at the desk when he heard Zack return. He waited to see if his cousin would try to talk to him but he didn't, passing by only to be snagged by Ginny for help with a bit of charms homework. Harry grinned as he turned the sconce above the desk triggering the secret passage he'd found between the sitting room and the guest room. From there he snuck into the boys dorm room and sat silently on one of the beds in the darkness.
Harry gritted his teeth as he lowered the waist of Draco’s trousers to his knees. “I’ll count them down from twenty, Dragon.” He said as he placed his hand on the milky white expanse of his husband’s skin. He lifted his hand and let it fall. “Twenty.”
In early October, Harry had the unfortunate opportunity to see fear in Draco's eyes again when a nightmare hit. Harry woke him and they talked for an hour before finding their way back to sleep. Finding out what had sparked the nightmare put Harry on the warpath and he had to calm himself before finding the Headmistress to address the situation. She agreed that bullying wasn't right or acceptable and announced to the whole school that she was instituting a no tolerance policy on bullying. Anyone caught bullying would be expelled.
Harry worked hard to keep from grinning widely when he heard this. Draco wanted to combine their names? He'd known that the blond would never relinquish the Malfoy name, but hoped beyond hope that he would one day want to be a Potter. The only thing that made him happier was the news of their children.
“Don’t you dare apologize!” The blond’s voice was soft but strong. “You were the catalyst that provoked the explosion but the cause was there the whole time. He was obsessed with possessing and controlling me…and I let it happen instead of leaving or getting help.”
Harry didn’t ask permission as he rolled Draco’s sleeve up and surveyed the damage. That whole portion of skin was black and blue. “Draco, my God! Let me guess: he wouldn’t let you use a healing salve. Was this supposed to teach you a lesson?”
After a few more minutes, Lucius and Narcissa made an announcement for everyone to find their spouse because the midnight countdown would begin in thirty seconds. Harry stared into Draco’s silver eyes as their guests shouted the last ten seconds around them. As soon as he heard Ron shout ‘one’ from his position next to them, Harry’s lips were tenderly pressing down on Draco’s.
“Good boy. Let’s go check on Draco and the twins.” Harry scooped Teddy up and draped him over one shoulder while the four year old giggled his little bottom off.
"Well, let's see." Bill murmured as he used several charms to detect what he could. "I do detect Fae magic from this coronet and the one called the three brothers resonates with a curse that causes the diminishment of riches over time. I can't be sure who broke the curse but it is broken."
“It’s the real reason I couldn’t fly yesterday.” Draco confided. “Viktor didn’t technically tell me I couldn’t but I didn’t want to lose the baby so...no flying. I’m also not allowed to apparate.”
“Yes.” Harry nodded inwardly cringing because he recalled vividly the last time Dobby had ‘helped’ him. “But in order to help me you must pretend to still trust and obey Dumbledore. Can you do that, Dobby?”
Draco’s nod was jerky and full of nerves until Harry pulled him in for another light kiss. “Are we really doing this?”
Harry nodded determinedly. "Our first couple of meetings went terribly and that wasn't through any fault of our own."
“I’ll already be asking for our day to be ours alone. I was also thinking I’d suggest that they work up to ours. It’s likely to be a media circus anyway, but if they arrange it properly, they’d put the least known people first and work toward us by doing something like this: Dean and Ginny and then Ron and Mione and then us...” Harry smirked now. “This would also allow for the Halloween Ball to be our reception…”
Harry took a deep breath and called for Kreacher who escorted Draco to a guest room. As soon as the blond was out of sight, Harry conjured his patronus with no difficulty. “Tell Ron to go after the bastard.”
Harry grinned at the blushing blond and without looking away; he answered, “There you have it, folks. At least two kids, then...if not more.”
The rest of the day went quickly as the Hogwarts bound students concentrated on making sure they had everything they needed before the final meal of the day was served because Remus had told them at breakfast that he would make a trip to Diagon Alley for any bits and bobs the next day.
Just as she finished the sentence, they heard a screech from Lyra. As she’d begun running across the room, her foot got caught on a rug and she’d fallen. Harry gasped and took two steps but Draco was awake and by her side in an instant to scoop her up. “You’re alright, Lyra…shhh…just a little fall…Harry is the bruise cream nearby?”
"Because in the magical world godfather is not just a ceremonial title, cub." Remus led Sirius over to Tukron.
“It’s nice to meet you, sir.” Harry told him as he stood and offered his hand to shake. “I am Harry Malfoy-Potter. This is my husband, Draco, and his parents, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa is Andromeda’s recently reconciled sister.”
“I’m here, Dragon,” Harry whispered to the blond. “You’re safe at home…Can you tell me what frightened you so much?”
"Of course, dear, come." Narcissa quietly encouraged him to join her and he followed because he knew the garden's atmosphere relaxed him.
“Momentous news! Mother, Father, would you join us, please?” Draco called not looking away from his husband’s happy expression.
"Your cock, my lovely dragon... I still want that...Your cock will be in my mouth very soon, and I won't remove it until you cum for me..." Harry whispered, kissing Draco's throat.
While gardening, he noticed several owls fly around the house at a strange distance which made him think there was a barrier they couldn't get through. He supposed that as long as Hedwig was capable of passing through it all was well. Though now that he thought about it, he hadn't gotten any letters from his friends and he'd spoken to Dobby about messing with his mail so he was fairly certain the elf wasn't up to his old tricks. The idea of going for a walk solidified in his mind as he eyed an owl in the neighbor's tree that seemed to be looking directly at him.
“Listen, Malfoy family...Harry...The ball is rolling.” Robards became serious. “The prosecutor will be in touch. There’s nothing else I needed to speak with any of you about.”
She'd broken down, then, isolated as she was, since her parents and the school authorities agreed that it was dangerous, she knew she had to obey. It had hurt in her heart when she turned away the owls from Ron and Harry and Ginny but she honestly hadn't known what else to do.
Draco was panting as he landed beside Harry. “Oh, Harry! You were so right! It’s exciting enough on my own but with her it was like seeing it for the first time all over again. We really must do this more often.”
*******************************************************************************************************
"Shhh...Relax, Dragon..." Harry soothed the blond. "I'm going to show this to the Headmistress and ask if we can't get out of classes until the potions wear off." He stood and went directly to the head table.
“That’s lovely! Now, why don’t you sit with Susan for a moment? Harry will be in with the healer quicker than you think.” Draco told him with a serene smile. “I’ll ask one of the elves for tea. That always calms me.”
“Do you think I haven’t done that already, Dragon?” Harry smirked in amusement. “I spoke with her as soon as they told me they were coming this weekend. I protect my family…”
“Is that...?” Draco murmured as he took the seals and looked closely at the symbols. “Oh dear Merlin! That’s an oak tree with a Welsh dragon! It’s the symbol that’s on a book in my father’s library, Harry; a book that was supposedly written by Merlin himself.”
Draco took a few more steps toward Potter's bed only to hear strange whispers. Suddenly, he was confronted with a familiar face in addition to a decidedly aggressive canine form. He nodded slightly to the large black dog. "Hello cousin, Professor Lupin. I wish to speak with Potter. That's all." Draco held up his empty hands in a gesture of surrender.
“Well, Draco and I don’t need the money, but you’d be giving us some practice before the twins get here.” The brunette rubbed the back of his neck. “Anyway, the only class we all have together is Charms. Flitwick let us sit today’s session out, but usually either I’m off or Draco or Pansy are. Your son is very sweet, Flint, and we’d love to sit with him. Although, I do insist the elf help Draco and Pansy because of their pregnancies.”
“Mother never really had any say over me and my father saw me as nothing but a sperm donor, Potter. I was forced – practically sold – into marriage so all I have to be thankful for is that he at least chose someone I was friendly with.” Malfoy whispered with a sad tone. “She understands that I’m not sexually attracted to her.”
A red burst of light hit Cedric in his chest and he went down like a rock. Harry started to groan as he tried to pull his classmate behind a gravestone but it turned into a wince as a sharp rock scraped his arm and he barely had time to catch the Hufflepuff's head before the urge to press his hand against his scar hit Harry hard. He put his back flush against the stone behind him and tried to catch his breath when he heard it.
“Good, now I’m going to amend the first rule: you’re not to wear clothes unless certain conditions are in play. Number one…you are going out into the public areas of the estate or leaving the estate altogether.” Harry decreed, “Number two… your mother is visiting the suite for some reason. Number three…I give you something to wear. Am I understood?”
“Don’t listen to him, Marcus,” Draco was saying from Harry’s conjured stretcher that was floating beside the brunette. “I have been tutoring him since we became engaged. This morning’s test was probably difficult but I’m certain he did well.”
Harry made a face. "No offense, but those are quite a mouthful. How is the poor dear going to learn her name if it takes an hour to say? I'd like something beautiful but a bit simpler. Linnea is pretty and so are Carina and Aster or Celeste."
Harry started feeling guilty, so he started stroking Draco’s arms and rocking him slightly. “I’ll stop worrying, Draco. I promise. The Healer has been with your family for years, right? She knows you and she’s treated you before?”
Harry shook his head and tucked a stray piece of platinum hair behind Draco’s ear. “I like it. Maybe your father or mother can help you tie it back. Dinki?”
February, once again, saw Harry celebrate Valentine’s Day with extravagant chocolates and a traditional trip to Draco’s favorite café in Paris while the twins enjoyed some time at Malfoy Manor. Harry took great joy in his role as ‘Papa’ so he’d put off a lot of the class work from the business course. Now that the twins were a little older, he didn’t feel they needed him to be as involved as much so, after a daily lesson, he gathered with some of his friends to watch their children play in a warded area while he read his school books. Another thing he’d put off was his desire to become an animagus and he felt a little guilty about that so he alternated books about the animagus transformation with the books from his business class.
“I hate that it has to hurt you, Dragon.” Harry whispered raggedly into Draco’s ear. “I’m so sorry.”
Harry marveled silently at the way the elder man’s appearance changed if you just put a baby in his arms. Something about him softened just enough to make the stiff and proper man look human.
Harry scooped baby Peony up and deposited her into Pansy’s arms before lifting Draco into his own arms. “I’ve gotten us a permanent Portkey that will take us to Nettlestone from anywhere. Kreacher, meet us there.”
Harry sensed it and placed the head of his cock at the blond’s entrance. “Push back onto my cock, Dragon.”
“Can we get on with it now?” Lucius was practically growling but a newly arrived Narcissa calmed him with a mild glare.
Draco smiled as his lover tried to get his head around this. “You know, he should probably know what to call you when he arrives...I’ll be ‘daddy’, I think...perhaps ‘papa’ for you?”
About a week later, Harry and Draco entered the potions classroom and sat together at one of the tables to wait for the class to begin. Ron and Hermione came in with a bunch of other students and took the table behind them.
Harry sighed sadly. He thought of all the interesting things he and Luna had found in the library and the beautiful paintings in the gallery. Several landscapes that had been painted by Ravenclaw herself were hung next to lost Monet works and some stunning paintings from renaissance times. He'd hoped one day he'd get to share it with Ron and Hermione but that was not looking too promising. The more likely scenario was that he'd find a boyfriend and get to share it with them before his friends felt close enough that they could ignore his sudden windfall of luck and power.
“Feel free to tell me to butt out but I’m curious…” Harry leaned forward to ask in a soft voice. “Did you have a child with your first wife?”
Happy that Draco's mood had settled, Harry followed with a grin and tried to keep up on the dance floor, but he knew he also needed to follow through on the ideas he'd just put forth. Harry vowed to check in with his boyfriend every time they started fooling around. He'd stop if Draco said no and make sure that he felt safe and heard if he wanted to talk. Harry knew he could keep these promises and if his own feelings changed, Harry promised himself that he'd be honest.
“It’s a lovely name, Harry.” Molly smiled at him. “It fits well with all the members of her family.”
"Alright." Harry replied calmly before calling Ziva. "We're leaving tomorrow. Please pack my trunk for the trip." Once that was handled, Harry took a deep breath and as he let it out, he said, "Let's do this."
“You’re so beautiful when you’re like this…Well, you’re always beautiful, but I…” Harry told the blond tenderly. “I want you, Draco. I want you so badly…want you spread out beneath me…Want to fuck you hard and slow. I’ve been aching to chew on those nipples of yours for a while too.”
"He wants me to go to the pool and look through the hedge." Draco frowned at his uncle. "How did he know I had one?"
“Well, you could start with a conjured rose. It’ll let you see where you stand in his eyes. I taught you that spell just after your birthday, remember?” She asked.
The night went quickly after that and Draco caught up with his old friends while still getting to relax and enjoy the company his newer friends offered. Dinner was served and Harry thought that the napkins here were the same as Narcissa had at the New Year celebration but a second look showed that they had Draco’s constellation instead of Orion.
He started to see grass and trees… It was almost as if he was approaching a forest of sorts and he seemed to be soaring above the scene. Not long after the strange vision began, he saw a large clearing in the distance. It seemed to be centered on one young tree which had many branches that were low enough to accommodate what looked like a flock of birds.
“What he needs…” Lucius narrowed his gaze. “Is to feel that his grandmother’s passing isn’t the end of the world as he knows it.”
“The birthday boy has arrived!” Draco’s friend came out and hugged him. “When the healer said Luna was almost done, my darling wife said…”
"Of course, sir." He followed Remus back to where Harry and Dudley waited. "Hello, gents. My name is Garnett Tertell, Mr. Potter. Do you have anything in mind or shall I get a custom order form?"
Harry's eyes snapped to Tom's face. "You already knew about releasing horcruxes ...didn't you, Tom? That's what you needed the spikes for."
"Oh?" Sirius chuckled in surprise.  "You play for our team?" Remus shook his head and elbowed his lover lightly in the ribs.
“I haven’t really noticed many pure blooded males being drawn to other men, Draco.” She commented. “In most of the relationships I’ve seen so far, pure blooded marriages tend to be heterosexual with the male in a very dominant role – not including sexual domination… They tend to enjoy taking control of their lives and wives while enjoying a mutually satisfactory sex life. What I’m trying to ask is why you felt so drawn toward submission when you’d spent your youth in a tightly leashed state under your parents’ watchful eyes. I was given a rough overview of your trial and, in many of the testimonies, the witnesses were quoted as saying you ‘had no choice’ or you ‘were still a child’ and ‘couldn’t get away from your destiny’.”
Harry nodded and helped him stand. As they walked up the stairs he felt butterflies in his belly. This man was so different from the bratty bully he'd been at school. He was now sweet and loving with just a hint of sassiness. It really felt like a perfect fit. He just hoped Draco felt the same.
By dinnertime Harry held the reply recommending regular exercise and the recipe for the potion he'd been given at Gringotts.
Draco flushed and began to lead them toward the balcony, “Tori, where’s my father? Didn’t he want to witness his son in slavery?”
He slipped the confusing letter into his rucksack along with the letter from Gringotts and pulled a set of robes out of his trunk along with a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. His trainers were on his feet and the socks he was wearing were clean when he put them on that morning. He rushed to seal his trunk with magic and threw his clothes into his rucksack. Then he remembered that his homework hadn't been completed and decided to simply shrink the trunk rather than send it to Ron. A swish of his wand had the trunk small enough to put in his pocket and one more swish did the same with Dudley's duffle bag. Freeing up both their hands, just in case. Hedwig was nowhere in sight so she must've been out hunting. So he shrunk the cage and added it to his rucksack.
Harry checked his wards with lightning speed. “Whoever it is, they’re coming from Mione and Ron’s house but I don’t recognize the signature…”
Classes began for all students the day after Harry and Draco moved in. Flying lessons for the little firsties began that very afternoon and Harry still vividly recalled his own first lesson.
Harry took a deep breath and said, “No…because Dinki will come back very soon with everything that she was sent for.” He dismissed the silencing spells and counted backward from ten before going back into the dining-room while Lucius stared after him.
The next morning, Draco woke up before Harry and went out onto the balcony. He checked on the twins before looking out into the distance. He closed his eyes as a light breeze ruffled his hair. Truth be told, as much as he was looking forward to this morning flight, he was also a little nervous. After all, it had been over a year since the day the war had ended and he hadn’t even had control that day so he might be rusty. He wondered briefly if he should owl Marcus for some tips but decided that Harry was more than up for the challenge of getting him airborne especially on such a beautifully clear day. A few more moments passed before he felt Harry’s presence behind him.
“I’ll always give you what you need,” Harry bent to gently kiss his husband’s lips. “Now let’s get dressed for a nice leisurely flight. The Seeker’s Game can wait until our brooms are broken in.”
After that was an odd run-in with Lucius Malfoy and the minister which happened when Arthur had brought Harry to see the courtrooms. He'd peeked in to see which seats he'd be occupying and had come out to find the eldest Malfoy whispering with Cornelius Fudge about prophecies.
Harry stopped in his tracks and turned to face his best friend. "So how about if I do homework in my suite til you're done with Muggle Studies and meet you at the common room?"
“And I swear to bow down to no-one except my husband, Grandfather.” Draco said firmly to the man in the painting.
“Thank you for being so nice to her, Harry.” Draco said, looking at the brunette. “Just seeing those peaches made her morning. Seeing the two of you joking together made mine...”
"Very well, I'm sorry for my part also." Draco smirked. "Which ones aren't you apologizing for? Out of morbid curiosity?"
Dobby sighed heavily upon seeing the glowing book and his former master lying on the floor. "Master Merlin, what is you doing? Dobby is now having to get Master Harry's betrothed to be helping his father!"
"Look, I'm sorry about last year...ok? I really didn't know what I was doing or saying. I was scared as hell and thought that it was the right thing to do." Pansy looked at the floor. "I've seen what supporting the Dark Lord got people. My dad's in Azkaban; Vince and most of the others are dead. Those who aren't are on the run and the elder Malfoys need an escort if they leave their estate. Borgin and Burke's store is shut down... I just need someplace safe ...and hopefully friendly... to stay while I finish school and get a job."
“Well…I suppose so…” The younger blond said. “But it’s also Pansy I don’t see much of anymore. Now with a new baby, she’ll be even busier and we’ll see each other even less. I’m not lonely by any means just…”
“I softened to Harry and his cause during the days I spent at Hogwarts without Harry here for us to antagonize each other,” Draco confessed. “And after we saved one another a few times, it still took the ministry decree to give me the confidence to stand up to my father so that I could choose what place I’d have in my own marriage.”
Harry was happy everything was going well so he went to check on the twins and Ron's rooms. "Siri, I don't suppose there's a way to get a Chudley Cannons poster before Ron gets here tonight? It's his favorite team and it might make him feel more at home? You know?"
"She was told only because her father tried to get us betrothed." Draco explained. "I know that my father put him off for a while, but after my powers began to manifest, they decided that there were too many unknowns to set something like that in motion."
Draco frowned at the elf but agreed to join him for a little while. He told his friend not to wait for him and gave Dobby permission to transport him along with Harry.
“Good night, Dragon.” Narcissa said kissing her son’s cheek. “Don’t forget we’ll be here to visit this weekend but you’ve got a wonderful team of elves to help Harry take care of you and the children.”
Draco's face went red but he took the lead and stepped into the room to interrupt. "I'll make a deal with you, P- Harry...If you try to handle my abnormalities, I'll try to handle yours."
On the way to the station Cedric got his attention. He didn't say anything; just handed Harry a small sack. Harry looked inside to find half the prize money from the tournament. By the time he looked up Cedric was gone.
“Roody's guess is that your bond with them wasn't fully formed. Master spent four weeks in Roody's care. We is fully bonded.” Roody looked up at Harry with wide eyes. "How long is Potter elves knowing Master?"
"So call her and ask his name." Dean shrugged and threw his hands up in surrender at the glare suddenly being aimed his way. "Or the other way around... whatever floats your boat, mate."
Sirius walked over to him and touched his shoulder lightly. "I know. I'll be back." He winked at his lover and aparated out.
“Thank you…” Draco held a multitude of emotion and he was sure it was only Harry who heard it all expressed in those two words.
“I want someone to love! Is that too much to ask?” Harry stood up and yelled. “I want someone to love… someone who has the guts to tell me off occasionally… someone who won’t let me walk all over them and pretend I’m always right when we both know I’m wrong. I’m not perfect, Draco! I know it and I want the person I spend my life with to know it too and accept it! I want you because I think you are the person who can do all of that and more! Our little duels, our witty banter and the little altercations… You make my blood burn and my heart race. We’ve such a passion between us in life outside of the bedroom that I want to see how it translates inside of it.”
"Lord Potter, Luna, curfew is almost upon us." Flitwick told them regretfully. "I'm sorry, but if you want to explore more it'll have to be done at another time."
"I've included the memory from the other day, as well." Harry placed his memory into the vial and handed it to Lucius who strode out of the room.
Harry didn’t like that his husband was being so erratic. “Draco, are you alright? Are your mood swings returning?”
"Of course I did, Mione; as did Draco himself." Harry nodded earnestly as they waited for the next staircase to move. "I told them all how I wished I could do it right…how I wished it were less of a business proposition and more about the two of us personally."
"I can give Sirius access to Potter Grove's wards, though, and he can do what's needed to join them next month." Harry told his partner.
Harry debated which tactic would be better for his plans and knew he couldn’t hide his ire for long either way. “Sure. A question.” He snorted in derision.
Harry looked around as if he’d forgotten that he was a wizard, but Dinki saved the day by conjuring one in a flash of elf magic and it appeared just in time to catch Draco’s first bout of morning sickness.
“I must warn you…I am more than just sexually dominant…” Harry kept his voice steady though this subject was a sore one.
"Yeah. Harry's taking me through for my orientation so we can meet with the Headmistress." Dudley confirmed. "I'm living here, though, so I'll be able to say goodbye on the first."
Draco's heart melted and he finally met Harry's eyes in a steady gaze instead of occasionally looking away.
“I also recall you telling me about a sign just before Draco was conceived, so don’t pretend that you don’t believe in signs,” Narcissa sipped her cordial.
“You need a haircut again, you know. Especially if you intend to attract – Don’t look at me that way, Harry!” She glared at her friend’s wide-eyed expression. “Just because things didn’t work out with your schoolyard sweetheart isn’t a reason to remain alone for the rest of your life.”
Draco had no idea what Harry had planned but he knew that the brunette would make it special because he was just that sentimental. When he saw the Parisian skyline, he knew Harry had really gone all out.
Harry barely spared the elder Malfoy a glance as he flipped hastily through the sketches so Sirius reached out to calm him with a soft word. "I'll find it."
“I’m glad you enjoyed them,” the older man said upon shaking it. “Harry has told me much about you, Mr. Malfoy-Potter.”
“That’s the way it seemed, but given the secret, I thought it best to wait until he knew before you committed to dating him.” Blaise explained.
Draco’s smirk showed he was amused but he played along. “Quite well, Harry. What can I do for you today?”
“Understood.” Harry nodded recalling that Seamus had bowed out of several pick-up Quidditch games while he was pregnant with his and Dean’s second child last year.
“Well what’s done is done in regards to that…but why can they not let us have control back, Kingsley?” Harry asked still confused. “They commanded us to marry and have one child each and we’ve done it, so I don’t see why the wizengamot can’t let us go on with our lives. Surely at this point we should be allowed to choose the number of children we will have.”
“I can, but this is less expensive even with the stones changed to whatever you want.” The man explained as he glanced at Harry’s tattered cloak.
"We could ask the elves for a picnic and go to the Room of Requirement?" Harry suggested. "Or we could go to the astronomy tower with it?"
“Good.” Draco said with a peck to Harry’s cheek. “Now put that silly book away and let’s go to bed.”
Wind that shouldn't have existed in a closed room with no windows disturbed the old man's beard as Dumbledore looked around at the effects of Harry's magic and gave a huffing sort of laugh before speaking. "Now, Harry, I'm sure that we will find this person and they will assure us that no harm was meant."
They knocked on the frame and were met by a harried Marcus. “Hi guys!” He said, waving them in as he gave a tired smile.
“So that’s how it happened! I always wondered why Father was so angry with you after second year. He only told Mother and I that he’d given one of our elves clothes and it was your fault but he never would say why.” Draco shook his head when Harry finished telling him about saving Ginny from Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets and freeing Dobby the house elf from Malfoy service.
“Yes, Harry. It is meant to protect items and clothing from any damage – be it graffiti, fire or a simple yellowing of the page.” The older man said.
“It seems that Pansy got a letter, too, guys,” Harry said, unfolding the parchment. “Her divorce was final at Christmas and the Ministry have had reports from the therapist she sees that the effects of her trauma due to the abuse and divorce are greatly diminished. They say it’s time for her to remarry and they’ve put her name on the list of women that are available for marriage.”
“If you inform Shacklebolt of the house’s location, the ministry will likely provide strong wards. In addition, I am certain that your floo will be connected before the house is even a finished structure,” Lucius continued. “Be sure there is a proper border that is spelled to keep the dog close to the house. Draco and the children will be safer that way. My wife and I will be expecting you to stay with us for a week before you move into the new house.” He abruptly stopped dancing and bowed ever so slightly to Harry before walking stiffly back to his table.
Harry watched the blond’s face as he did so. Draco had a reserved expression and Harry took this to mean that the other man felt he needed to mask his emotions. Nobody should have to do that in their own home and Harry hoped he wasn’t the cause. He sighed as he followed Draco’s directions.
Harry nodded with a grin as they discussed where to go and after a short debate, Draco agreed to try take-away from a muggle Italian restaurant. He was distracted throughout the meal, though, and hoped Harry didn’t mind him checking in with his mother when they arrived at his place. Draco smirked and pretended to be upset when Harry didn’t want to stop taking pictures along the way. The restaurant was quick to prepare the food and wrap it up to go.
"Wonderful! Now, according to the statistics for wizards your age, you are closer to the height and weight you should be. However, you are still a growing boy so you can still get taller." Olgok smiled widely. "While I was gone, I retrieved another test scroll to be sure all of the blocks have been removed. One more drop of blood is all I need from you, Mr. Potter."
"I agreed to meet with Voldemort." Harry said solemnly. "Give me a moment. I'll meet you in the office."
Harry smiled at the sleepy looking blonde and cast a cleaning charm. "We'll shower and talk in the morning."
“This is charmed, Draco,” Harry grinned. “I own it as I own you and only I can remove it. Do you understand?”
“I know…and that is why I am going to endeavor to explain it to you.” Lucius nodded curtly. “While names do not define us they do call forth the loyalty of others. You changed your name, Harry. You are no longer Harry Potter. You are Harry James Malfoy-Potter which means that not only do you not have to worry about us removing Draco and the children from your care…you can trust us to back you up and defend your position. Being a Malfoy means protecting the reputation of the family as well as respecting the expectations of the family. If someone offends you, they offend us all. Your weaknesses are our weaknesses, which is why I need to know the fears you harbor… Our strengths are your strengths, which is why the Bogart you experienced will never happen – because we will not let it happen.”
Harry handed his coins to Dudley and told him softly.  "Give him eleven silver sickles for each of us. Give me the gold. It's best to split it between us anyway." He pocketed most of the gold coins but, in a slight of hand move that any muggle magician would envy, two galleons slid down his pants leg to land on the floor beside Stan.
“Well, here’s your story, Rita: Harry and I are going to Hogsmeade for a few hours. Now, if you don’t mind … Hogsmeade is waiting.” Draco replied scathingly.
“Next week, we begin a new year and that year will herald a new era for us. Before the next Christmas, we will welcome two children of our own blood and be forever changed. There hasn’t been a multiple birth in the Malfoy family in over five generations and, though it was I who procured the potion, I do not claim credit.” The elder blond spoke softly; his tone was filled with sad acceptance. “I do, however, celebrate it and will continue to do so every day because the world needs more of the type of magic that only a child can produce. Thank you, Harry. Thank you for accepting the past as past and not harming Draco in some misguided sort of revenge. Thank you for loving him and giving us the precious gift of a future.” Before Harry had time to comprehend what had just happened, Lucius clapped his hands twice and several house elves appeared. “Elves, you may bring the feast.”
He looked up and in the direction of the Gryffindor table where Harry was looking particularly intense.
The blond snorted. “Finally, I got him with a Stupefy and once he was down, I used Petrificus. Then I got Luna to help free the aurors and the Headmistress.”
“There are benefits to being related to me, Ernie, one of which is that certain parties allow me to handle such matters before stepping in.” Harry snorted. “He got a lecture and had to apologize and return what he took.”
"Yes, Headmistress, but that's just the private reason. Kingsley, I know I'm in the public eye and have to have many reasons for doing things." Harry informed the older man. "The reason you can give the politicians is that me getting married on the anniversary of my parent's death will allow me to reclaim that date for something good. It'll make me feel closer to them as well as make my fiancé happy."
“I’ll have plenty of time since Al says this level of my training can take up to a year and a half to complete.” Draco’s silver eyes shone with happiness. “I already love flying with you so maybe…”
"I see...You should retain your own friends, son." Lucius began to lecture as they walked through the large doors of the castle. "What if the Ministry allows these forced marriages to be dissolved someday? Do you really want to be stuck out in the world with no friends?"
“I’m just going to put the brooms away and bring Lyra to play with the others.” The brunette said softly.
Harry wasn't used to being given preferential treatment. He stared at the man for a moment and made a decision. "Next time I come through, I'm taking you to see it, Mac."
"I know what you're thinking." Harry smirked. "Our friends won't like it. Your mother might not be happy about it. We'll get loads of howlers from the public at large..."
"Draco..." Harry didn't really know how to approach this subject. "This relationship is ours. Period. It's not anyone else's and it's not a race. When we move forward is up to us.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. "Interesting...I’d thought they were more free thinking than that." He silently resolved to have Remus call on them for a short conversation and perhaps a trip to the bank.
Draco’s cry when Harry’s warm hand cradled his organ was a beautiful thing. He sounded tortured and yet somehow joyous at the same time. “I need it! I need it! Yes – Harry, please?!”
The older man didn’t bother to spell his shirt dry as he left and Draco gave him a strange look as they walked to the Room of Requirement. Hermione and Ron were there as well as everyone else.
Harry grinned. “Luckily ‘going slowly’ doesn’t preclude enjoying lovely kisses like that first one.”
Draco glared at the girl. "Fine. Blaise and I will look again. If we find something, we'll let you know."
A knock sounded at the door to the office and both boys turned to see Luna peeking in. “I’m sorry, Draco; there’s a prefect here asking for you.”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t mind me staying here?” Draco whispered, glancing behind him as Harry moved in closer.
"Bill's moved out completely and has bought a tent for when he brings his family to visit. Charlie has taken over the room he used to share with Bill and moved Gus in. Percy and Penny have a house in town so they can just walk over now…" Ron started before glancing at George, who took over as Arthur went inside.
“Blaise and Luna were invited too but Lawrence has a fever so they’re staying home.” Draco explained as he walked across the room to stand beside his husband before turning to smile at the portrait. “Hello, Grandfather.”
Harry nodded crisply and turned to leave. He was gratified to find that Draco was waiting at the doors.
Harry scooped the baby girl up into his arms. “Papa’s going to bring you to Daddy, Princess, and Daddy is going to look at your gorgeous green eyes and then he’ll count your fingers and toes like he did with your brother. Daddy likes to do that sort of thing.”
"If it would help, I can assure you that Uncle Tom is working on himself." Draco said encouragingly.
“I’m just so glad you’re alright, Draco,” Harry said, swiping away the moisture as he slowly came closer. He leaned down and placed a light kiss on his husband’s lips before looking at the babies. They were bundled inside colored blankets but Harry knew which was which without being told. He smiled as he took the little mint green bundle from Draco’s arms. “He’s got my skin coloring…”
“That’s the reason Dumbledore is so famous isn’t it?” Harry asked as he reached for them but Remus held it back to give Harry a bit of background information. Harry huffed but continued his thought. “He dueled Grindlewald and won, right?”
The others spread out to see if they could find a way to board while Snuffles pressed close against Harry’s legs. Dudley stared out onto the water in wonder.
Logically, Draco knew that if Harry wasn’t around and he felt that way he could call Dinki but he didn’t think Harry would like to hear that so he stayed quiet.
“Very well, but please bring it back in a few days. We are still investigating the prophecy, you know.” Dumbledore reminded the young lord.
Harry nodded. “That’s right, Healer. My husband is apprenticed under Potions Master Aloysius Loveday.”
Harry nodded back and handed the book back to Master Loveday. “You can add the potion now, Al. Thank you.”
"Harry, Hedwig is waiting in the owlry. She's got a package." Luna told him as she joined Ginny on the couch.
Caelum happily watched his sister and father as they interacted before pointing to the top of the house. “Papa? What’s it?”
They entered Gringotts with minimal fuss and Harry approached the nearest counter. "Hello, my name is Harry Potter. I'm looking for Korlag."
Harry kissed his lips lightly as the floo activated a third and fourth time to allow Pansy and Ron to come through.
Draco had been happy to see the Greengrass sisters. He'd been engaged at one time to the younger of the two, Astoria. Luckily, she was as gay as he was and their parents had accepted that they would never be anything but friends. The war had separated them and Astoria had ended up marrying a Ravenclaw named Carina Winsome who would bear a son. The boy would be called Lorien Caleb Greengrass and he'd be born in late September. Daphne Greengrass, the elder sister, was totally straight and had been paired up with Adrian Pucey. Pucey was one of the older Slytherin students that had graduated the year before the war ended. Their daughter, Florestine Blythe Pucey, was expected to join the family in early September.
Luna sighed happily, laying her head on Harry's shoulder. "I do. It reminds me of my uncle's estate."
“Why didn’t you say so before?! Indeed, the boy looks half-starved!” Abraxas commented. “Go on, now, Harry …but do come back to visit with me. I must have the details!”
Draco moaned and his hands fisted in the sheets as he felt Harry stretching him. His first time with Viktor came to his mind unbidden. The older man had never taken such time and care to prepare him - a quick spell or even just some spit. The thought, now almost made him feel used by his former fiancé but Harry was slowly banishing those horrible memories and that brought him back to the moment.
“I’d love an audience for that but, just to be clear – public means ‘anyone other than the three of us’. Are we agreed?” Harry asked.
They sat together watching the lights, kissing occasionally, and sipping peppermint cocoa until Draco realized he hadn't hung the silver ball on the tree. He stood up and carefully placed the ornament in a central position near the top of the tree. Then he dragged Harry upstairs where cuddling turned into something more and just before they fell asleep he whispered. "I hope there's still gifts for me to open on Christmas, Potter."
“I was just speaking to Viktor about the Seeker’s Game. He’s agreed that it’s a good idea.” Harry grinned.
“It’s very important that you know this, Ted.” Harry held out his arms and waited as Teddy climbed into them. He hugged the little boy tightly and whispered into his ear. “I love you, Teddy. I love you and I loved your daddy and mummy, too. I miss them and I’ll miss your grandmother, too, but I still have you…and I promise that I’ll take very good care of you.”
“Harry, I should at least speak with her. Would you please let her in?” Draco sounded strange as he said the last few words.
The guests were also asked by the deceased to keep in touch with Harry and Draco so as to provide them with support while raising Teddy who would most likely not remember much if anything of his birth family. They all gladly agreed to write on a monthly basis.
Luna had said Ron would get over it after the start of term. Hopefully she was right but she was so 'out there' that Harry didn't want to hold his breath. What he did want was to get his mind off of his issues with his friends and onto more life altering subjects.
Harry chuckled. "You'd know if I was asking you out, Malfoy. For one, it wouldn't involve a teacher."
As he walked back to his room, Draco couldn’t stop his thoughts from wandering over the entire summer. The responsibilities he now shouldered were boggling his mind and he suddenly wished he’d known that walking into the hospital wing to speak with Potter that night would change his life forever ...not that it would’ve stopped him.
"In light of this new role, I chose to reconsider the choices that others have made for me..." Harry looked directly into Draco's eyes. "Or somehow influenced me to make..."
Feeling along the wall he came to a doorknob and turned it. He glanced back to see if anyone was around to notice the fabric move but he was alone so he pushed the long forgotten door and felt it give way.
“Yes. I decided to have the unlivable remains of the house torn down so we could build the amazing home you and the architect came up with,” Harry nodded thoughtfully, allowing his lips to begin to curve.
“Two?” Harry frowned but then it clicked. “Oh, the Crouch elf is there too? I see...Roody, if I asked, could you bring someone here?”
“In present company, I don’t think it really matters.” Sirius smirked at his cousin's husband. “Besides, Harry insists on using it. Lord knows why.”
Remus had written everything down. "The Wiltshire estate is probably the best option for now. From there, we can easily visit your friends before the thirty-first and in August we can check out the others."
“I’ll give you the memory of lunch. I don’t mind if you show Mione but you can’t let Draco know that you know.” Harry insisted. “It’s bad enough Viktor’s betraying him. I don’t think he can take my betrayal as well. He needs me.”
Remus nodded and kept his seat. He knew Harry would be faster on his own than with him tagging along.
"Do let Ernie know that I might be able to help him remove the feathers..." Harry smirked. "Won't you?"
Draco had thought his tearfulness was waning but when Harry talked that way he always turned into a puddle…while he was pregnant anyway. He let Harry gather him into a tight cuddling embrace and cried himself to sleep.
Speaking of crimes, his godfather had endured a great miscarriage of justice and the ministry needed to make up for the horrendous wrong they’d committed against a lord of the magical realm. He could hardly believe that Barty Crouch Sr. had thrown a Lord into Azkaban. Then he realized that at the time Sirius had only been a lord’s heir but his father’s title should’ve warranted a trial for him at least.
"Is that the stone wall?" Cedric was suddenly alert and almost breathless. "Most of the walls have layers of portrait and tapestry to them. There’s even a bit of panelling."
A silver tray appeared in the center of the table with dinner rolls and a large round crystal dish accompanied it with multiple servings of butter which had been transfigured into a distinctive daffodil shape.
Harry looked confused. “I don’t understand. What does his having accidents have to do with Andy’s d-death?”
Draco blinked in confusion for a moment when a whiny four year old came up asking about dinner too. His eyes flicked up to meet Harry's as the blonde realized what was happening. "You're hitting on me?" He mouthed.
Narcissa nodded with a solemn air. Andromeda was also affected by Lucius’ behavior, though she didn’t allow it to show. Draco just snorted and reached over to close the uncouth brunette’s mouth while his father continued.
Draco was positioned closest to the fireplace and Sirius moved to his side as Harry came through the floo behind him.
Harry felt a twinge of guilt that Draco had barely scraped freedom from pregnancy with the new request and now could be forced to endure it again before his training was finished. “Draco, didn’t Master Loveday say that one of the upcoming levels of your training will be bookwork all over again?”
“They want us to have another baby, Harry.” Hermione frowned. “They expect me to become pregnant by July.”
The blond had a knack for fashion as well as potions, it seemed, for he’d chosen Harry’s new cloak from a catalog and had it delivered to the Gryffindor dormitory before breakfast that morning. The box had been labeled simply with a white card that read ‘a courting gift for Harry’. Harry had been surprised to find that the courting ritual went both ways since Ron hadn’t warned him of that part.
“There’s no question, Harry. If he’s doing things like this Viktor doesn’t deserve a single ounce of my friendship.” Hermione hugged Harry. “Harry...Ron also showed me what happened in the training room. You really scared him. You can’t let your temper get the best of you or Draco will get scared too.”
Draco sobbed and put a hand on his bump. “He was shouting about wanting his child. Harry, I know this was just a dream but...”
“Draco would have a fit if he heard you.” Harry chuckled. “It’s ‘have to’ not ‘hafta’…and well, that’s one of the things I want to talk about, buddy.”
When they'd first met, Harry had been put off by Malfoy's attitude about the house system at Hogwarts. Not only had he been arrogant and condescending, but then he’d proceeded to make fun of Hagrid - the only magical person Harry had ever met - the only person in recent memory who’d ever been kind to him. Their second meeting hadn’t gone any better because Draco had offended Ron Weasley - the second friend Harry had ever had. Harry’s opinion of Malfoy had only gone downhill from there and he never thought it would rebound but due to the night of the third task of the tournament, Harry was considering clearing the slate between them.
Draco moaned and tried to obey. His muscles strained while Harry worked him over. As soon as the brunette’s teeth found purchase in the sensitive flesh, Draco gasped loudly. “Gods, Harry!”
Harry looked at the rose. He knew how he felt about Draco and he didn’t want to scare the blond if he didn’t feel remotely the same way. “Draco, are you ready to see the results if I take that from you?”
“I’m glad you don’t mind coming up here…even after what happened that night.” Harry said softly while loosening his tie and letting it dangle.
“That's strange." Zack broke into the conversation. "If he was raised anything like I was, he wouldn’t have thought twice about seeing his sister married off for such a reason.”
“Oh, yes… but they broke up a while ago.” She told him while they watched Blaise try to explain himself to Draco. “Don’t be jealous, Harry; there’s no need. He and Blaise would never have worked out. Blaise is not quite Dominant enough for Draco.”
“Draco will be fine, Harry.” Lucius assured the brunette. “His mother and I will be with him and he will know where you are and how to reach you. I never intended to leave him in the dark. That would only give him unnecessary stress which, as someone pointed out to me several years ago, is a bad thing for pregnant people.”
“Dobby is being sad that Harry Potter is being treated this way.” Dobby’s eyes shifted along with his mood. “Dobby is being angry.”
"No!" Harry protested. "He thought that too! I just want us to have the opportunity to get to know each other without Dumbledore's interference. He's going to figure me out soon and the rivalry between our houses cannot stand in the face of our relationship, but he won't like that."
“Yes. The abstract idea of a beast should’ve been enough to send the students home.” Harry quietly agreed. “If I’d had control of my lordship at the time I would’ve insisted. On the other hand, nobody knew what the monster was and hunting it under such conditions would’ve been difficult and dangerous for anyone who undertook such a task as that.”
“He’s begun level seven?” Goodman sounded stunned as he asked this. “He’s only been working at it for two and a half years and he’s reached level seven?”
Pansy received baby clothes from Narcissa and Lucius and a warm cloak from Draco and Harry, as well as a few items from her in-laws who held no ill will toward her for the incarceration of their son.
Dean and Ginny Thomas                     November 1998 - August 15 1999   - Twins    - Lucas Arthur and Lance Aldwyn
Harry nodded tensely. "The lake featured prominently along with the fact that the four elements were all present."
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry. It’s called accidental magic for a reason.” Draco narrowed his eyes at his husband’s teasing and tucked one stray piece behind his ear. “Nobody really knows why it happens.”
Harry smirked at the blond’s attitude and, when there was no more Nutella on his chest, he swiped the knife over his fingers and threw it in the sink before advancing on his lover.
“Before we eat, there are a few subjects I wish to address. Firstly, I’d like to thank you all for your excellent service over the years.” Lucius began, though Harry interrupted with a round of applause and the ladies joined Draco and baby Teddy in its continuance. “Next, I will be adding a new rule or two. I do not wish any Malfoy house elf to punish themselves anymore. The only exception to this will be if you contribute to putting any Malfoy family member in danger.”
“Altaira’s portrait should be ready.” Harry grumbled as he plopped down into his favorite armchair. “Why is it taking so long to reach us?”
"You heard Draco the other night - he's inherited some creature traits from one of his ancestors. One of them is the urge to find a mate and they’re certain it’s me because of... well, the other trait he inherited from the creature." Harry told him carefully. "He saw my dreams, you know... without any kind of rituals or Legilimency. That can only happen with this particular creature's mate, Siri, and I wanted to make sure I didn’t have any obstacles to a happy relationship with him."
“Your son has decided that he doesn’t want to wear blue today,” Draco began to smile but a tear ran down his cheek.
“Never have I ever wanted to kiss someone in this room...” Harry drank before Draco could protest that it wasn’t his turn. As soon as he’d swallowed it he leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco’s.
“Well, before you rush off, here’s a new spy device from the Unspeakable division.” He handed a pocket sized journal to each of them. “They communicate with each other and I have one as well. If you have thoughts or concerns… Hell – if you just want to talk – write in it. Unless you want the group to know what you’re writing, direct your words to one person. You’ll be able to see who wrote, so if I say: Harry – call me…Harry will be the only one to see those words and instead of ‘me’ he will see my name.”
Harry was taken aside as Minister Fudge came forward and asked Cedric about the tournament to find out who won. As he was led out of the arena Harry passed by a small group of third year girls. Among them were Ginny and several girls he'd only known as her friends. Most of them seemed to be ditzy giggly children but one blonde stood out from the crowd.
“Teddy, do come join us.” Andromeda was also grinning as she patted the settee next to her. “What’s new, Darling?”
Lucius nodded as he accepted his tea from Dobby. "Their son’s name was Malcolm and, when he died at an early age, they renamed themselves after him. Malfoy is the current pronunciation but it started as Malfey."
A circular impression surrounding three smaller circles. Looking closer, Harry was able to make out a lion's paw print, a badger's claw mark and the talon mark of a bird - probably an eagle.
“I’ll teach you before you go back to Hogwarts, Harry. We still have a day or so,” Narcissa grinned and walked to the door. She addressed her son as she opened it. “Lucius and I will see you both inside the formal dining room.”
“I know just what you mean, Dragon,” Harry reached out and gripped the blond’s hand. “It just felt amazing and so… right… to know you were safe and alive.”
“Well, first of all, Harry, helping you is more important than fiddling with my hobbies,” Arthur smiled. “And as you’re married men, you don’t need a chaperone!”
A pang of heartache hit the brunette as he realized how much he’d miss Teddy and the twins while they were away. “I suppose we can ask them to bring Teddy, Lyra and Caelum to visit a couple of times.”
"When Dudley and I were leaving Privet drive, we came across a dead body and a snake." He looked up at his godfather. "You know - I'm sure I or someone else told you - I'm a parselmouth. I speak to snakes."
"Oh... sorry." Dean's attitude deflated so he took the awkward pause and filled their glasses. "Reflex. I've had to defend my decision to hire him several times."
“No!” Harry gasped. He hurried to read the article but when he saw the picture of Draco’s hand it left no doubt.
“So you truly want me to sign that?” Harry asked looking into Draco’s gray eyes. “It’s only fair that I warn you…If we sign this… you’ll be my slave. I will give you rules, Draco, and you will follow them. I’m prepared to punish or reward you as your behavior deserves. Because your marriage contract allows this, I won’t have to settle for blow jobs, but I quite enjoy them, so you’d better know what you’re doing.”
With a nod, Bill led the way to another nearby chest. "This trunk contains the artifacts you've inherited from the Ravenclaw vaults. I happened to see a few things that looked interesting including this." He cast an Accio and handed Harry a small flat box. "It's a silver Celtic style cloak pin of two intertwined dragons."
As soon as he could clearly see Draco’s organ, Harry cast the spell to release the cock cage and smiled at Astoria, “Now then, I think a tour is in order. Draco, show me my suite…you may walk until I say otherwise,” He placed the chastity device on a nearby table with the miniature of Lucius just in front of it.
Ron held her hand and caught her as she swayed where she stood. "It's alright, Mione; calm down. You're safe."
As their guest smiled reminiscently, Harry sat too and held Caelum in one arm with the bottle in his opposite hand.
It came out that – despite the rumors of promiscuity – Draco was actually a virgin; he’d only kissed, frotted and masturbated in his adolescence. In return, Harry confessed that he’d been both a top and bottom during a week-long fling with a muggle boy just before his last birthday. Draco’s family had long ago taken to calling him ‘Dragon’ and the blond admitted to liking that nickname but only in private and by a select group of people. Harry warned his fiancé that he was very much the Gryffindor in the way of chivalrous behavior. Draco had noticed during their first date that the brunette had seemed to enjoy opening doors and holding chairs for him so he wasn’t very surprised by this. He did say however that he was not a girl and would sometimes want to reciprocate. Harry confessed a desire for a quiet life in either the country or suburbia. Draco wanted to own and run a small apothecary because he loved potions and wanted to become a Master at the subject. Harry wasn’t happy with that but promised they could talk about it in depth at a later time.
