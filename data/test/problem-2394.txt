“I need to go home!” Draco whined as he stopped on his tracks. He have been forced to take a walk with him around the Potter grounds and it has been tiring and hot!
“We have to get you checked first, darling”
It didn’t take long until Draco was panting and coming all over their stomach. He kissed him on the lips before sighing.
“Anyway, these are my associates, Ron Weasley, Blaise Zabini and Hermione Granger. Everyone, this is Senator Lucius’ son, Draco Malfoy”
He cannot be spiraling like this.
Those eyes that looked with respect but never the same or similar with the way she does and she’s scared of what would she have to endure for this.
The person looking back at her had a color on her cheeks, something that she knows never disappeared since Harry had shown her little affections. Her eyes that were once too confined within its own looked to be slightly blooming. There was joyful purity that reflected within her silvery eyes.
He was about to retort something nasty but held his tongue when he saw Harry’s fierce gaze focused on him. He felt so small then. Smaller than he really is. Harry looked so handsome but so cold at the same time. Those eyes that pinned him to be silent and keep the words to himself.
"Lalalala~" he innocently sang, swaying his hips with the noise.
“Ah. Okay, work your magic, Harry” he whispered to himself before wandlessly casting a cleaning charm all over his body and his mouth to make sure there are no remnants of the kisses he had with someone.
The way he carries himself fascinated her. He has this air of nonchalance and at the same time, plenty of raw expressions written in his face. It draws her in as to why a man like Harry Potter can be two sides of the same coin, all seasons, day and night.
He needs someone who might know the situation.
But with the state he is in, could she afford to be angry? Especially when she knows how hard life is with them? With their name? She experienced what her father have experienced. The only difference was she have Harry beside her, who did his father have? The woman he left with?
She bobbed her head up and down. Her hands pumping what she cannot take on her mouth. She hollowed her cheeks to try to accommodate him more and began to pour pressure. Harry growled at the action, feeling the throb of his cock as it chases its own orgasm. He didn’t expect oral with her could be this good despite the obvious lack of experience. But he wasn’t complaining.
There’s really nothing wrong with him. He just have someone in life he can call endearments with, kiss, cuddle with, and basically, someone beside him (add the bonus of being inside him) That makes him happy. More so because it’s Draco Malfoy.
“That’s it, love. Your pussy is adjusting so nice. Tight around me but I will loosen it up for you, would you like that? Would you like Daddy to finger your pussy and make you cum?”
She breathed heavily, moaning softly as Harry kept playing with her clit, helping her ride out of her orgasm before he continued to thrust in, loving the slippery feeling and the thought of her cum coating his cock.
“Fuck. A-alpha, oooh” Draco sobbed out, his legs trembling as they wound around Harry’s head, caging him in and that excellent tongue and talented fingers doing everything they can to give him the most pleasure.
Lily stepped outside, walking over to his spot and suddenly gave him a hug, “It’s a pleasure to see you, Draco. Harry will be delighted”
He cried out when Harry bit on his inner thigh before he pulled away and pushed his body up. He pecked him on his stomach, his hand playing with his rock hard cock. The heat on his palm is rightly hugging Draco’s erection.
“What can I do today, Potter?” Kingsley asked as they stood at the side of the conference.
He chuckled. All kinds of thoughts twirling inside his mind as he decides how to play this on his card.
"I'll visit the Ministry every Wednesdays. I want you to stay here until I arrive"
She grabbed the bottom of his shirt and took it off of him. She pushed him away and smiled at Harry’s shocked expression. She straddled his waist, not minding how naked she is in Harry’s eyes.
He was surprise to hear such vulgar statement from the omega and his eyes instantly glinted as he smirked. He stood up with her in his arms before he began to walk towards his bedroom.
Harry chuckled and pulled him in a kiss, his tongue pushing pass his parted lips and sucking, “Cum for me, sweetheart”
She was hardly surviving at that dirty place, barely even working as a server at one of the crampy bars near Knockturn Alley. And guessing from the clothes she’s wearing—if you could even call them like that— she’s not getting paid enough.
After all, Harry is still a man, right?
“For me to be rough with you? Tease you as you have teased me? Punish you for flirting with that man?”
Draco stopped and thought for a minute. Does he want to go somewhere else? Or spend this day with Harry in the Manor? He could continue getting to know him, right?
“Come on, angel. We need to fix you up” he murmured, supporting him with his arm.
“Y-yeah. Hmm”
A man riled up enough still cracks, right?
“Is just a nice day out is all” he smiled and offered a hand.
He had given up all reason. He let himself get drowned by lust and seduction. He had grown obsessed with the ass of a certain Slytherin who should be out there, partying with people his age but instead, he's here at his own home, kneeling and sucking an older man’s huge cock.
Dracy smiled, “No. That’s not what I want anymore”
His mind told him.
“What did you do to the Christmas—
He should’ve asked Sirius or Remus for some script. Lines to tell. Yes, he admits he’s at fault too but the issue here is Draco leaving without a word. He’s eighteen for fuck’s sake! Harry was hired for a reason.
Pulling one of Harry’s hands, he gently intertwined it with his, smiling at him when Harry’s gaze turned soft and gave a kiss to his exposed pelvis. He sighed dreamily, he cannot believe Harry is really with him right now. He loves it.
Throwing his head back, he began to thrust his fingers, adding another one as Harry guided him through it with his curses and his words and his constant urging to get him out of the magical bonds.
He coughed. His eyes widened and he blushed worst than ever. Did he just? He gasped and looked away, trying to convince himself it was the firewhiskey pushing Harry to act like this. It wasn’t of decision or choice but the alcohol alone.
“Hey, baby. What’s wrong?” concern laced his voice as he bent down to level her face, “Are you in pain? Tell me darling so I could make it better”
"You'll be staying?"
Draco sighed as he stared at his wonderful boyfriend.
He sighed and nodded at the people trying to talk to him. Excusing himself to continue to interact with the Minister.
He pulled away and plastered a controlled smile on his own, rubbing circles on Draco’s waist to ease him, “Tom, what a lovely party” he praised back.
He wouldn’t say it. Normally, he would. He was never on the shy side. Malfoys are nothing but frank, straightforward, and never hesitates. They are.
He went to the kitchen and grabbed the sobering potion before going upstairs.
Harry tossed his boxers on the floor and pumped his cock for a few times, whispering another lubrication charm and guiding it to Draco’s hole, “Going to warm me all night, princess. Is that alright?”
“I thought you weren’t satisfied because I am not to your standards”
What she saw when she arrive was a trail of candles on both sides with floating balloon in the air. They are glowing, surrounded by fairy lights and dancing with the breeze. There’s a straight path ahead and as Harry curled an arm around her, she let her eyes roam around at the beauty of the place. Ignoring the house as she focused on the surprise, the beauty, all of Harry’s efforts.
Andy nodded before extending her hand to her, “Nice to meet you. I’m OB Andy but just call me Andy”
“Smoke” he mumbled out distractedly, head falling at the wall as he tried to look at what Harry is doing but unable to do so when he felt hands on his hips, tracing undecipherable shapes as his mouth came in contact with his nape.
He glared and pinched him by his arm, “I’m not leaving  you alone here, fucker!”
This secret has ever been with him ever since he discovered what his sexuality really is. When he realized he doesn’t want a cunt. He wanted a cock even when he already possess one for his own. He wanted to feel a huge cock up in his ass, fill him up so good he forgets his own name. There used to be a time he wanted to be a woman because he thought that’s the only chance he can have his own boyfriend.
Draco’s lips parted and his ears begin to ring. He began to hear this static noise that buggered him off. It was wrong. Harry treats what happened as something that’s wrong.
Harry nodded and took a seat beside him, tucking his legs beneath the blanket Mrs. Weasley made for him on his birthday, something that quite smell like his godfather.
“I was afraid that we might not be really compatible like we think so. I was afraid that maybe someday, we’ll grow tired of this arrangement and ashamed that I’ve never really understood what you do”
“Malfoy”
Harry waved his hand and turned around. He approached Draco absentmindedly as he thought back to the conversation with Luna.
“I’m going to hell” Harry whispered.
“Harry” she mewled, her eyes not leaving his.
He lightly bent down when Draco elbowed him and faked a chuckle, “Do excuse him, Mr. Cockybee. Mr. Harry has always been a joker. Always wanting to lighten the mood around him”
“Please, daddy. Need you. Please”
He thought back for a moment. Does he want to be an Auror still? It seemed so far away now. He once claimed he’ll be an Auror and when he got the chance to be one, he declined. He doubt Robards will hold his spot for long.
Mission successful.
It wasn’t him who bound her. It wasn’t him who possessed her because it was her who did.
“Fuck! I’m coming,
“Excuse me, but where is Mr. Harry Potter? Draco would love to meet his fianceé” his father had to ask at some point. And why is he calling him his fianceé?! He isn’t his fianceé!
Harry sighed, “Where do you wanna go?”
Harry grinned, index finger grasping his chin, “Hmm. That’s negotiable, dove”
Harry nodded and stood up, carrying him by the waist as Draco tightened his legs around him and leaned in his shoulder. Inhaling the comfort Harry gives him and feeling the immense joy and gratefulness to his own self for going on with his thoughts.
something.
“D-daddy” Draco whispered, sobbing his own cock throbbing, desperate to come.
She just finished cooking the curry when she heard the familiar sound of the floo. Deciding to go greet Harry at the living room, she walked over there.
He looked at Draco to see his surprise expression. He's already fully dressed.
“What happened?” Lucius asked, his eyebrows furrowed in deep concentration in the same way his usually composed wife is currently doing.
“Andy won’t tell us what the gender of the baby is” he brushed a thumb on her cheek, “Ready  to go?”
“What can I get you? Iced tea? Brandy? Or perhaps, a reason to believe?”
He watched her as they began to eat, occasionally eating his own but he’s not really that hungry. The sight in front of him was just invigorating as his mind swirl with many ideas on how to really make it up to her, to ease her worries that’s forbidding her from truly enjoying going out in public. Plans on how to prove how sorry he was for being such a jerk and the idea of introducing her to his parents’ and sibling’s grave.
The next morning, Harry jogged around the Malfoy grounds. He ran around with thoughts swirling inside his mind.
Alarms blare in his mind as he fought the urge to let out a gut-wrenching plea. He let a tear roll down from his eyes. His mind ringing,
“Wonwon!”
Draco nodded dazedly before tilting his head to the touch. His nose latching onto the familiar smell of cigarettes and the new one that distinctly said
Not really understanding the muggle ways of treating to health conditions. He turned to Lily when she spoke, “I still cannot grasp the concept of this thing, Siri. How do magic exists in this generation?”
“Don’t worry about me. I can get off with the sight of you”
Draco stopped and frowned, “What? Went out?”
Only to be humiliated because of how he was awfully confident before. Though at first, some of them have been adamant at his decision to marrying someone who’s not in their gang, believing that it might taint the purpose of what they do, they were still supportive.
Draco’s head swims in wanton lust, horny and feeling his own erection poking Harry’s hard abdomen, smearing it with his precum. His fingers carded through Harry’s hair as he felt him move, slowly but with force until gradually, his pace quickened.
Draco stayed back behind the party in the center of the common room. Firewhiskey and foods being passed around as they celebrated the first game of Quidditch for the school year and the first game they’ve won.
He gasped when Harry gripped his neck surprisingly. Nails lightly digging in his skin as he tightened his hold, enough not to constrict his airflow but let him feel his calloused hands,
Harry stopped and looked at them, questioning with his eyes. Pansy smiled cheekily and elbowed Draco who managed to blushed even more.
He kindly tried to brush it off, thumb gently grazing Draco’s wrist as a sign to tell him off. His warmth feeling like summer heat and Draco was a bit astounded at the feeling. The softness of his actions was such a different kind of touch to the ones Draco had experienced from the past.
“Fuck baby”
She lied in her bed while also moaning in pain. She can handle her heat before with the help of potions but now that she didn’t take any, she can feel it full force. The need to have something buried inside her, arms around her, kisses on her lips, and Harry’s scent. She needs it all.
They have a past. How can things just be laid back?
Or well, seeing from his parents’ faces, they were obviously shocked at the presence Harry was exuding. He was bold, courageous sure, and a little bit too frank. Too frank for his father’s liking.
“It’s just Malfoy moves. He’s cold, give him your jacket” Pansy winked and laughed as she walked out first, “Let’s go!”
And besides, what is there to talk about? The past? How could they settle that when she and her father obviously have different kind of past? True, they still have one more thing in common. They suffered.
Harry looked up from his steam of endless documents at the sound of his little boy's soft and gentle voice. He was holding his favorite stag stuffie and was wearing nothing but Harry's oversized shirt.
A ring.
He went to the living room and Harry followed behind him. He sat down at the couch and saw the older man removing his robes, revealing the wand holster hugging his upper body and the tight sleeve that he wore underneath.
. That asshole who thought it was a good idea to handcuff one Draco Malfoy in a chair. In a horrible chair no less!
“You’re pregnant” he murmured, “We’re parents. We may not consider ourselves to be family now but I know we will in short time”
He knows that’s enough for everyone to gossip about. Draco wanted him to clean this mess and that’s the only way he knows how.
What?
Harry cringed, “That sounded so bad, Ron”
Lucius Abraxas Malfoy.
The start was blurry and something they’ve brushed to the side as years of pent-up energy from being the Wizarding World’s most famous cat and mouse have been restricted for fear of risking safety.
He's just gonna stay at their house and occasionally visit Pansy and Blaise and have parties. So what kind of harm will arrive? Nothing because Draco can kick some serious balls if people try to harm in any way.
“What about you? Got any goal after school?”
Draco glared, cussed, and tried to bewitched every living thing in their office as Pansy, Blaise and even Harry’s bestfriends, bushy haired nerdy girl Hermione and redheaded bitter candy Ron Weasley looked at him with amusement.
It didn’t matter if it cannot reach her g-spot because it was all too arousing. She basically melts in her place, her grip on the couch loosening as she cries back in pleasure. The sensation shooting down on her like arrow.
It looks squishy and adorable. Harry would love it－ yeah, fuck. Drift away from forbidden impurity.
Harry immediately shook his head, “No”
Sure, he can excuse this for all the things he have done to him since they started their relationship but where’s the fun in that? Draco learns his lesson again and again and again.
“Don’t hold me like that!”
Draco cried out, his hands tightening, “I was just joking”
“Harry?” he called tentatively, not wanting to break the peacefulness but needing a bit of steady conversation.
It’s such a nice thing to hear Harry including her. She sighed giddily, “We will?” she murmured.
He asks for consent and lets her have the chance to speak. Harry watched her pupils dilate, his fingers nearly hovering over her pussy which he’s sure is dripping of slick already. The smell even sweeter and fucking beguiling.
Harry nodded understandingly, once as any other minute, in awe of how well-spoken Draco can be. Of how insightful, perceptive, of how deep he can think. Draco is someone who just doesn’t look above the surface but also think deeper, wider, broader, and more open-minded.
, I’m coming” he mumbled almost incoherent and hardened his thrusts.
He have his thick cock embedded on his heart. The cock that fucking drives him crazy and always hungry. Oh merlin, fuck him. Just fuck him.
“I think I’d prefer you mad, Head Auror” one of the female Aurors stated and Harry smiled at her widely, “Come on, Pepper. Don’t be so bitter. Anyway, WEASLEY!”
Draco teasingly smiled at him, one of his hands coming up to caress his beard, “You have a beard”
He soon realized they have arrived at the dining. When he looked around, he saw various meals placed on the long dining table with porcelain plates and all and more drinks than necessary.
She shook her head. She wanted to say both but she didn’t try to force herself to speak.
Those delicate and elegant fingers as he plays the piano, the music is superb. Harry admired him at first sight, dazzling images of the young boy naked entered his mind, of all things, he always dreamt of magnificently ravish him in the dining table, bed, bathroom, gazebo, ballroom, living room, and even in their pantry. Everywhere they can fit, he thought of it.
Harry was silenced for a moment. Not knowing what to answer honestly but didn’t want to worry him more than he already does so. But it wouldn’t do them good if he lies with words than admitting what should be heard.
He raised back up and looked at Draco’s whole figure. So small in his broad frame, paler into the darkness and glowing under the moonlight that seeps in from the glass window around the corner. His eyes were closed and the way he would murmur things and call out to him, he wants to fuck him then.
She shook her head fondly before taking her wand out and flicking her wrist, while waiting for everything to go back on their order, her eyes dropped to the silent kid sitting at the edge, busy reading some book,
“Me” she giggled before looking at him pleadingly, “Eat me?”
True, they communicated but where do they stand? Are her services still required? Are her chores still stand as her duties? How would she begin her loving?
Dracy bit her lips before accepting for a handshake, “I’m Dracy”
Wow. That kinda hurt. Well, kinda because Harry fucking knows it’s partly true and it’s his fault.
“Especially me, Draco” he smiled genuinely as he leaned forward and pecked a kiss on his forehead.
“Sap” he rolled his eyes. He definitely needs to do a lot more than this.
“Just for a second, baby”
. That’s new.
I’m c-cumming” she whimpered and just then, let herself release on her own.
Her heart fluttered and she sighed gratefully, leaning her back on his chest and tilting her head to look at the man who was nothing but a man of pain. She knew he is now very willing to move on and be a better alpha for her.
“I forgot to c-cook dinner” she bowed her head, “But, but, I’ll go start now”
Draco cried out, thighs trembling as he bucked his hips up to get some friction to his hardening cock. Desperation and neediness quickly coiling up inside him. It has been too long, too long since he felt Harry’s cock inside him and he misses all of him so much.
He glared once more before submitting to opening the folder.
They stayed silent for the next few minutes, basking in the afterglow and the smell of aftersex. Their breaths falling in sync as they sat, sweat to sweat and always skin to skin. Remus began to hum a song, comforting Sirius as he curled around his torso because fuck, being in love never fails for them.
“I’m not. . . Well, maybe, kind of, sorta, probably but that’s not the point”
As they took a step, eyes following their movements, noises getting louder, Dracy’s hands tremble lightly. Maybe it really was too much.
His eyes slid down and he found himself staring at those cherry red lips, puckered slightly and calling out to him but he fought himself not to.
Draco didn’t answer. He had all the bad feelings about this but he wouldn’t slack back at the apartment then leave Harry to do the work.
“Sound so good for daddy, sweetheart”
Harry’s mouth latched on his neck and bit, “Fuck, you’re so hot like this. In my arms, needing to cum before sleeping, clinging into me and needing me so desperately.”
Fuck these pregnancy hormones. She had found she wanted to kick him in the balls but wanted his hug as well.
Harry Potter straight up met him at their living room wearing a sweatpants and a white sando. He gulped when the gorgeous muggle bent down, his arms leaning at the back of the single couch, sweat dribbling at the corner of his forehead, his bulging arms that glistened as light touches it.
When Draco felt the hard cock settling themselves on the crack of his butt and he tried to grind into it, “Need you, want you. Please fill me up, Harry”
He had an earth shattering orgasm last night and he had slept with Harry which speaking of, he smiled. He turned his head and was slightly disappointed when he found himself alone in his bed. Where is Harry? Why didn’t he wake him up?
Draco gulped. For how many times this day, he didn’t know. He felt a force being pulled in him, tugging closer to the mysterious man who creep his own way in and took him out of the world he knew since birth.
“Sure is” Andy agreed and smiled before she began to examine the image, making sure everything is all right with their baby.
That’s the number one and the most essential of morals. The one he shouldn’t disregard easily. Draco is the tempest that even the killing curse will not be enough to atone for Harry’s mistakes. Harry will burn in shame and wither away and be remembered not as the Head Auror or as a son of James Potter. He will be remembered as the one who pounced on an eighteen year old.
She never held an orgasm this long before.
Tightening his grip on her hips, he pulled her up and encircled one hand around her waist while the other fondled with her breast, toying with the hardened nipple at hand.
She looked up from her plate when she heard Harry called her. Humming at him in question, she waited for what he has to say.
“Hey, are you okay?” he heard him asked kindly. And why is he kind?
One decent person cannot surely handle a lot of riotous bunch of witches and wizards. They are just the whole new definition of wildness.
“Which one?” Pepper asked and Harry laughed.
He sighed. Alright. That’s an absolute warning but just a quick question, who’s the boss here again?
Draco smiled, “Yeah” maybe it does.
“Now, surprise me. What do you like in bed?” Harry asked.
“It’s Harry, isn’t it? What happened this time?”
Relentless, cold, but still, quite reserved. How Sirius dreams of seeing them go full force and meet the man he had heard from his bestfriend. The man who controls the security, the man who do the dirtier work behind while James only do a certain level of dirty. The man who Lily had referred to as the kind but ultimately, dangerous at the end of the day.
, harry, I’m cumming. Please let me cum—fuck, yes”
“No total sensory deprivation. No extreme bondage. No prostate torture. No somnophilia. No tight ropes, belts, whips” he recited, gentle eyes taking every reaction Draco is giving.
He put the Ashwinder egg to the cauldron then added some horseradish and heat, “Juice some squill bulb” he ordered without looking, keeping his eyes focused on the cauldron, not wanting to fail the Potion up.
He only stopped with his actions when she was pulling his hair away.
Draco huffed and take threatening steps closer to him before he shoved the small notebook on his face, “Do you see this?!”
“Fuck, you’re so fucking hot, baby. Come here. Let me touch you”
Thankfully, the dinner went fine and nice. Hermione and Ron didn’t ask questions that would put her in another very unease situation. They only talked to her about little things and most of the time they conversed with Harry who was sitting on her side with one hand resting atop her thighs.
“Who’s you boyfriend again?” Harry whispered dangerously, his hand wrapping around that pale neck, not pressing or putting any pressure but just holding.
“Do you want to?”
“I said strip, kitten. All of it” as if sensing his hesitation, Harry spoke without turning his back around to look at him. He was busy standing in front of the cabinet and exploring what is inside it.
And it’s still morning. He chuckled and stepped inside the elevator, “Morning” he winked at everyone in the lift.
He ran away.
Then he stood up abruptly. Loving the way daddy’s eyes widened and his jaw ticked.
His whole being is in a frenzy, gradually spiraling into a long-awaited insanity.
How would the public react when they learn their good Senator is engaging in acts like this in the public? Would they be surprised? Disgusted? Shocked at his blatant display?
Harry smirked mockingly, “I’m right? Did I hear it correctly? I’m right?”
But as quick as she felt the hair in her nape rose, the tables have turned. The man who have no problems with feisty women like her.
“Want me to make it better, baby?” he asked huskily, he feels burned under Dracy’s submissive gaze and Dracy whimpered at the warm hand that invaded her rounding tummy. She meekly gave a nod and within seconds, Harry had her shirt joining the sheets.
“Fuck, baby” Harry pulled his mouth back when her palm landed on his hard cock, throbbing from its confines and desperate like her pussy was.
“O-okay” she hesitantly said, not satisfied with the answer she got but too tired to argue.
She gulped and is about to rephrase the question or probably change it entirely when Harry turned around and stared at her.
“yes, that’s it. Harder, harry, please” he sobbed into the bed as he moaned at the slap Harry gave into his ass as he railed him from behind.
He avoided him. Just that.
hello! it's pains me to say this but there is no update I will be posting for a few days or a week starting right after I post this.
Why did Draco have a thought that maybe it’s going to be him who’s pleading?
They communicated, talked, and realized things. Now, Harry’s time to woo her, make her feel so appreciated because she’s worth more than what his galleons could buy and the solutions to the horrors that haunts him.
Without no warning, when she felt that familiar tightening of her lower abdomen, she came gushing on his face, the scratch of his bead nicely touched the side of her pussy. Harry helped her ride out her orgasm before pulling back.
Dracy was loosing her grip. All of her energy is being spent on the way she was trying to control herself from cumming. She wanted to be so good, so good for Harry. She gripped on the sheets tight, pulling on it as his cock hit all the right places.
He didn’t bother when he heard Remus chuckled darkly, clearly loving the way he is reacting. He wanted to grind his erection to his but he is not letting him.
Ron gave her a friendly smile as they made their way to the dining area. Harry’s bestfriends have visited for a nice dinner at his house to check on them both after weeks of not seeing each other. And Dracy’s been casual with them and perhaps, Hermione’s already a nice friend?
“I’m staying with who?” he asked to be sure. Ignoring the laughter he can hear from Seamus and Dean.
Dracy arched her back when she felt him tying her wrists at the headboard using his tie. Not too tight but enough to constrict her from pulling away. She gave an experimental tug and she had a vision of the torture of not having the chance to hold  him, scratch his back with her nails.
Her father’s eyes lingered to her stomach and upon noticing the action, she hugged her tummy and scooted closer to Harry’s side. Lucius smiled sadly before turning to look at her in the eyes,
“You’re a boy and I’m an adult and I should be having good and right reason to tell you how this is wrong” he said truthfully, Draco whined and shook his head. He was refusing to listen to Harry’s point.
“She’s a Prefect, you see. Ron told her you’re coming back and she wanted to walk with you. But I advised her to walk with the first years to keep away the Nargles coming at them” she responded in her dreamy voice.
He closed his eyes tight, trying to control the overwhelming emotions he’s feeling. The way he started to feel he’s floating once more. Lighter than he felt last night and in any other night. He bit his bottom lip and tried to grip the sheets for leverage.
It’s French.
Harry pulled away, staring down at her as his finger slid up to the her lips and caressed the outline, “I like your fire” he confessed.
Draco’s eyes shot up and Harry chuckled mockingly, “Oh, you think I don’t know?”
“I am. Fuck, I am old for you. I shouldn’t be with you”
"Rules that we'll have to follow"
“Ah. No, tiger. You were such a tease there” he hummed, too calmly for her liking.
“Yeah, she is” he answered after seconds of silence on both sides.
He nearly gave everything! He nearly handed out his brilliant virginity, nearly baked him a cake, nearly poured him his coffee, nearly put a picture on his wallet, nearly let his picture be his phone background, and most, he nearly put his birthday as his phone and flat password!
“Are you okay, Luna?” he caught her attention.
“P-please”
Draco’s mouth opened in shocked and huffed in utter disbelief, “You’re such a phony bitch!”
Harry was always so strong in the eyes of the public. So cold, well-endowed. He was never this broken, transparent, and torn.
What the fuck did just happen?
Harry nodded, not knowing where this is going to go. Or if she’s buying him some time to gather his thoughts.
“I hate you, Potter!” Draco murmured as they stand by the entrance of Gaydar.
They watched for what felt like hours, ignoring the way Harry was still holding onto his waist and wrist. It felt nice. Hmm, yes, nice. But he’s not going to admit that. Because it's not.
Harry has a light shaped around him, following him wherever he goes. He has a presence that draws a smile and a giggle. Has an aura that shifts into something joyful and happy. He’s confident but never proud, he has self-worth but never smug, he’s smart but never bragging.
Pansy was dancing with the girls and he was grateful she managed to adjust to them, letting herself be free to enjoy their last year. Ginny and Luna was in the party too, busy flirting with one another on the other side.
“Daddy” he called out and Harry nodded before taking his boxers off.
“Yes, sir, please. Need you, want you”
What the hell is he thinking?
He snaked a hand to press on her clit. The pressure getting the best of her as her mouth hang open and she came around him, pulsing and quivering as her blinding orgasm hit her.
He had never once had sex with an omega in heat because it can get wild, wild in a way that he could accidentally mark an omega. Something he wouldn’t want to.
Because now that he realized, Draco can very much use magic if he can't reach a cup. This has to stop. Harry's cock is reacting at the sight that managed to caught his eyes and how gorgeous Draco might be, this is fucking wrong. Wrong at House of Potter at least.
Tom accepted the coffee before turning back with that glint in his eyes seemingly directed to Draco, “Well, welcome to the neighborhood, Leo and Mark. I hope you’ll settle in nicely”
The silence that befell the whole table changed the aura around the place. The ladies’ turned to their husbands with Lily immediately giving James a squeeze on his hand while Narcissa gave Lucius’ thigh a pinch, silently telling him to control his temper.
Draco’s mouth is a slip away from apologizing, one step away from blurting things out but fought not to risk what they have lest Harry doesn’t like the words he’ll hear. But before he could even do anything drastic, he spoke,
Draco cried out as his hips buckled before coming into a stop. His cock bobbed as he came messily across his stomach, chest and Harry’s torso.
There was a chuckle and there was this strange tingling in Draco’s stomach. He needs a drink. Or maybe he fucking needs to pee.
When Harry grunted in complain, Draco stood up and smiled cheekily.
Harry laughed and cupped his cheeks, opting to watch Draco while Seamus continues to convince Dean to play against the Hufflepuff  players.
“Hogwarts withstood a lot of things. It survived centuries, experienced generations and endured cruelties,” she paused, “To protect its own, Hogwarts has some magic in it for safety and nurture. Something that can influence a person and like you two, might cause confusion. It’s something the four founders of Hogwarts did that is not known to many,”
"Shall I punish you for disobeying me?" Harry pretended to ponder, "Spank you until your ass is red? Edge you until your crying?"
It didn’t take long until they arrived at the bar Draco used to visit almost every night. The bouncer who recognized him immediately let them in and he squealed at the excitement surging inside him.
Draco parted his lips in response, moaning as Harry pushed a thumb in. He suckled on them as his hips rutted desperately.
He whimpered, gave control to the man known for dominance. He let Harry’s chapped ones touch his plump lips. He let his tongue control the movements, let his large callous hands grip his silky hair.
"Perhaps we're both the winner" he smirked as they both pulled away.
There was rustle and footsteps then Pansy’s face came into view.
He barely made it six steps when she huffed and rolled her eyes, “And if I want to?” she challenged, successfully stopping the man from completely retreating, “Pay for it that is”
His fingers slid upwards, ready to take a risk to feel what he wants to feel when a grip on his wrist stopped him.
“But I won’t” he added roughly and in matter of seconds, pulled away.
“Where are the oils?” he asked.
“Have to prepare you first, angel”
She bit her lips, fighting the tears trying to sneak their way past her eyes. Fuck these hormones but fuck her feelings too. Not in a bad way but in a good way. She loves Harry that is for sure and if Harry doesn’t, she can wait.
“No bra, darling?”
“What the fuck just happened?” Harry grunted.
After the dinner, it was even more of a surprise when Harry had offered a dance with no music. But to them, as they were dancing in the heart of the living room, alone, they were thoroughly enjoying their own rhythmic pattern. Nothing choreographed but enough to lift a loving smile on both of their faces.
Something that was kept with a mouth shut. Away from Lucius and Narcissa's consciousness and what a pretty sight it was when they saw him fucking Draco.
She pouted and nodded, “Okay”
He tried to school his confusion but he was sure it still came out. A lot of questions twirling through his mind as Harry brushed the sheets to the side, standing up only dressed in his boxers.
He sipped on his drink a littler roughly and he was sure he heard a faint chuckles from Draco.
Harry didn’t budge. He stared at him seriously, eyes unblinking as he waited for whatever Draco will do. He pouted. He was expecting for a punishment and not this cliche silent treatment. Merlin, he wants his cock to choke him, fuck his mouth, use him. Bend him in more ways than one.
“Darling, we could lose everything if we had not agreed—
“Whose are you, sweetheart?” he repeated coldly, letting a bit of his weight above him.
Draco glared, “No!”
She nodded, blushing as she wrapped a hand around his wrist, “Thank you”
“Go! Go! Go!”
The bartender laughed, “You’re lovely”
Draco kept his scowl. Didn’t heed to his father’s orders as he followed behind them. His fianceé’s house is huge, extravagant but that doesn’t faze him. He’s a muggle, a muggle Draco should not be associated with.
He was silent for a moment before shifting a bit, “Why don’t we stay and celebrate here?”
oop🙈 two chapters!!
“Just so you know, I never do things without consent, Draco especially with omegas” he said seriously. It doesn’t annoy him when people call him playboy but surely, he finds it somehow offensive when they assume he’s some kind of an asshole who doesn’t know what consent is.
“Fuck, so tight, kitten” Remus grunted, his hips rolling slowly, trying to get used to the way Sirius is clenching around him, still wet from their morning fuck.
“Ssh. I’ve got 'ya, little one. Tell me everything you want” Harry answered breathlessly, one hand sneaking to play with his balls and Draco sobbed, mouth falling open in silent scream.
“Love that, baby? You love touching yourself?”
Harry shook his head, “No. You have the right to. I asked you what you want before”
In the past few weeks, Harry had started to read her stories before bedtime. Though it was dedicated to their growing baby. From time to time, they would both lay their palms on her stomach, waiting for the sudden kick that would arrive, the little movement that will not fail to bring joy.
It didn’t take long for them to get ready. But it was also such a short time for her to collect her nerves. Harry’s assurance had eased her worries but as minutes pass by and the thought of going to St. Mungos where people can know and gossip. After all, the eyes of the public travels fast, mouth on mouth and thousands of ears that can listen. She just knows her pregnancy is at risk.
“Fuck me, Harry. Want you inside me” she demanded with a moan, “Want your cock in me, pounding in me. Yes, fuck, please. Want your thick cock inside me”
He was about to open his mouth and ask again when another bike came into view, driving into the gap and stopping right in front of him.
“Don’t stop, don’t stop, more” Draco whispered, eyes rolling at the back of his head.
. Something just happened. He’s sure of it.
Harry met his gaze nonchalantly. No semblance of the kindness, politeness, and courteousness in his face as he puffed out smoke and tilting his head to the side, “Need anything, darling?”
“How many songs?” he asked as he began to retouch his make up.
“Pansy!” he called out, wanting to sound fierce but only ended up sounding too tired and sad. Which he didn’t even try to conceal at this point because Pansy knows him well enough to read between his facial expressions.
He bit his lips, not hearing Ginny calling his name. Something is happening.
“Hmm,” he hummed, “Ya getting soft on me now, lovebug. Maybe I ain’t sleepin’ on the couch later?” he dipped his head low, “I can just kiss your pouty lips right now”
Harry rolled his eyes and stopped for a moment. Sirius can really be so chatty and talkative. He chuckled. It may be the reason Remus fell for him and that genes too perhaps. He eyed the letter which was written on something like a parchment rather than just on a piece of paper.
“Hmp” she stomped her feet and stood up, tossing the book carelessly to the couch and padded towards the living room, not caring whether she’s going to interrupt the friendly meeting.
Draco smiled and stepped closer, seeing Harry’s grin as if he had just won.
“Ssh” Harry shushed her, hands trying to soothe her as he let the woman cry on his shoulder, “I wanted to make you smile, baby. Not cry”
“Doll, please?” he plead and tried to catch him by his hands but he was prying them away.
Draco eventually followed and straightened his head, opening his mouth as Harry began to feed him, occasionally putting food on his mouth as well, all the while his other hand never ceased on rubbing along Draco’s spine.
He was definitely in shambles now. What does this man have that crumbles him like the ashes of his cigarette falling to the floor?
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe not all the way tonight but if she chooses to give him the permission, why not give her something to remember by? He smirked, tilting his head as he eyed her from the other side of the venue.
“A muggle, mother! I cannot marry a muggle!”
She gulped. Her eyes widening at the sound of the voice.
“You are, aren’t you?” Harry cut her off and sighed. Dracy didn’t respond to that and watched him massage his temples and heave another deep breath.
It wasn’t just the Alpha who decides. It also depends on how the omega feels about it.
“Make yourself cum on my voice, kitten. Want to see you cum undone on my voice only. Could you do that for me?”
He felt as if his body was pinned down by the mere sight of Harry looking so hot and
Typical room. Shrugging, she walked over to the love seat and took the shirt in her hands. Without giving it much thought, she took her own shirt off and put on his shirt. It’s too big for her but it smells exactly like him and it’s actually comforting and nice so she decided to keep it on.
Harry grinned, slowly rising to his chair, easily towering over Draco’s height even with the desk between them. Such a nuisance. Such a nuisance. Can he just throw this table out of the Ministry and devour the most beautiful omega known to Harry’s eyes?
“I’m going to give you a nice massage later, baby. I’m going to make you like the queen you are and make you feel so good”
He didn’t know why he had to be called in this emergency meeting. He was having fun taking a very relaxing bath with Dracy. Seconds away in drawing another orgasm out of her, make her squirm in his arms before he makes her their breakfast and feed her nicely.
“Come on, princess. Let’s eat?” he asked softly, hearing that nice whine from Draco, not wanting to pull away.
The door opened and stepped in a fresh looking Cedric with his friendly smile and kind demeanor. The man known to be the gentlest among the gang he belongs in and handsome too. He was followed by his girlfriend, Cho. After waving and smiling at him, they sat down by the window as a waitress asked them their order.
Harry said he doesn’t use the library that much and that was such a waste. He already gave her permission to read and use the library as she wants and she’s obviously having fun. Within three days, she’s able to finish a lot of books by her favorite wizard author, Valsken Vokbin. And she managed to reread her favorite muggle one, William Shakespeare. Like many others, she loves Romeo & Juliet the most. Whether or not because she desires love of her own, she didn’t know.
“You won’t cum until I tell you to, alright?”
“Baby? Are you alright?” Harry frantically asked, standing and pocketing the ring as he immediately rushed to her side.
“Welcome to coffee treats, how may I help you today?” a woman greeted with a friendly smile.
But he’s here, at the living room, all alone waiting for Harry. His daddy should be with him!
When his gut tells him something is off, he knows it.
“Fuck, ohh” Harry growled, feeling good himself. Dracy’s body is amazing. It felt too good above him just as it felt amazing last night when he fingered her. It didn’t matter if he’s not yet penetrating because this one felt so good already.
"He's very much young and is very exciting if that's what you are worried about" Lucius said.
"We'll do this nice and good, darlin'. We're not starting too hard on 'ya. Wanna hear you be noisy for me"
She sat up and smiled, “Morning”
She panted when Harry gave a feathery kiss at her nape, the exact place where he could bite his mark to claim her and left the place to get to the counter. She blinked for several times. These kind of moments are hunting her.
“Kitten?”
He was just starting to love the friction Harry was giving him when he pulled his hand down to his balls, cupping them and massaging it with light force.
This is bad. This is absolutely bad.
"Stay here while I put up wards. If you really want to get to know me, listen" yes, yes. Draco will listen. He gulped and went to sit back at the couch.
He sat up properly as he took in the two Malfoys' appearance. Expensive, luxurious and graceful. And typically, collected parents like them, from Harry's experience, have spoiled brats for a kid.
“It’s an easy thing to get you here in my place. You’re too easy, too predictable and too obvious” he chuckled as he stopped inches away from him, towering height mocked him condescendingly, “Your eagerness to do what your father wants you to do pleased me so well that I decided to keep you and
It didn’t take long before Harry slid, groaning at the feeling he misses whenever he’s away from pouncing on Draco. His eyes threatened to clench shut but he needed to watch Draco come apart, greedily needed to watch his expressions and the ecstasy written all over his face.
It is felt and it is found. Sometimes, it comes to you itself, dressed in these various kinds of stories so you’ll have something to tell to your children, to your wedding day. It’s not just about giving. Loving is not just about giving, it’s the feeling that Harry never tried to step into. For his whole life, he always used his mind.
What a beauty. Such a waste it will be if he doesn’t end up in Harry Potter’s genes.
Draco moaned and nodded.
He did not bother himself looking who came back for their last year. He’ll see them at the dinner anyway. It didn’t take long before they arrived, opting to step out the last to avoid gushing fourth years and younger ones. For Merlin’s sake, if there’s anyone who deserves some attention, it’s those who fought with him, stood strong beside him, sacrificed themselves, protected whoever they can to win  the war.
He really is making her feel better.
They were busy throwing some fireworks into the air followed by the familiar Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, blinding them for a bit moment as they cheered into the smoke.
Because he was able to seduce Harry, now his daddy. His daddy only and no one else but him to call him his daddy and be called his little boy in return.
Or is the whole of Roaring Lions disappointed at him? Will Pansy and Blaise still look at him as their friend?
He stood up and fixed himself, “Bye”
“Feel what, Harry?”
"Bye, Miss Pansy" Harry said and waved a hand. Pansy smiled, "Take care of him, Mr. Potter"
It started when he opened the pub and no one came in. Not a single person from Roaring Lions and Pansy’s absence intrigued him more. She would always bother him if they’re here but she was nowhere to be found.
“Eyes at me, darlin’. Want you to watch me”
Draco huffed when Dobby started to beat himself with the plate on his hand. He grabbed the plate away from his hands and spoke, “I forbid you to beat yourself. Understand?”
She gasped as he licked a striped up to her clit. Her panty absolutely messy and ruined more as Harry mouthed at the material, tongue peeking out to taste her above the cloth and groaning.
Harry will hate her! He will throw her out! He will kick her out! And where would she go? How will she return from her former job? How is she going to survive in a rundown apartment? Or is she going to live in the streets? No! She cannot!
Harry was torn in between. He wanted to talk, not comfort. But the way Draco was just looking at the floor, head bowed slightly, he looked so hurt.
She gasped. The blush being replaced by the sheer panic it got to her. Child? Public? They are going to St. Mungos?
He loved the reaction he got from him, the way he fidgeted on his seat uncomfortably to the way a visible tent formed under his pants. He was about to do another bold thing and reach for his abdomen when a phone ringing interrupt him and blew whatever bubble that enveloped them.
“Seriously, what is wrong with you?”
He always had found her like a pit of fire, one whose presence exudes
“I wonder what that says about you” Pansy just know how and where to hit the most painful.
It’s the process that started to build anticipation inside him. The one that started to steadily boil, not yet gnawing like a tiger is to its prey but was stirring him up with his nerves in frenzy.
He saw his empty luggage at the corner and when he went to his en suite to look, he saw bottles of shampoo and body soap that defined Harry's great scent. There are the usual toiletries and followed by a container of shaving cream. Draco had the urge to avada kedavra a lifeless object because Draco wouldn't want Harry to shave. He wants it as it is. It's hotter that way.
He spluttered annoyingly and glared at Harry, “This is why I hate you, Pottery”
He was free of anything corrupting him and stopping him from being the man (or kid) he should’ve been years ago. He grew up with a fraction of someone else’s soul a part of him and it was really draining.
She gulped at the tickling but relaxing sensation. The way the omega side of her reacted to the simple touch and unintentionally, her rigid body loosen up a bit.
When they arrived, she saw two people sitting at the couch with held hands. The woman had a bushy hair and is smiling kindly at her. While the man has red hair and freckled skin. Unlike the woman beside him, he isn’t smiling but instead just looking.
“Taste so good, daddy” Draco pulled his hand back and made sure to scoop all of his cum on his face and went to straddle Harry.
“Wanna make sure our child is alright”
The name itself is a sign that this is going to be an utter disaster. Fiasco.
Harry chuckled before carrying him bridal style. He walked over to the driver’s seat and unlocked the car. He carefully sat inside with Draco in his lap. He helped the blissed out man stretch his feet to the passenger's and hugged him by the waist.
Hermione spared him a glance before exchanging knowing stares with Harry, “Actually, we do. There’s this charity for orphan children this weekend. You should come”
Draco's scowl turned into a sour expression as he grimaced at the idea of having rules. "Rules are abomination. I'm going to Pansy's" he said stubbornly.
An engagement ring.
“See something you like?” Harry teased, noticing the way Draco’s eyes lingered on his abdomen to the bulge in the center.
Harry clicked his tongue and left the room. Draco sighed in frustration. He needs to test his blood pressure. What did Kingsley thought partnering him with him?!
“Patience, kitten. After all, a dance doesn’t always end in once song, right?”
Harry sighed once more. He has a strong instincts and intuitions when it comes to things and this, this is something that his gut told him is a bad thing.
Draco doesn’t drive but well, he may have driven Harry with good ride. He doesn’t travel with them, opting to stay in the pub and take care of his small business well so Harry and his gang has something to come home to.
Their first night together is magical not just because it was such a hot steamy night but because they managed to settle what’s stopping them both from accepting to be in each other’s arms. They fucked and Harry took care of him and lulled him to sleep, hugged him for the rest of the night and he woke up with his kisses this morning.
She smiled, eyes closing peacefully. She didn’t expect Harry could be this amazing to massage her.
He nodded in agreement. It was nice Harry was repeating all he had stated to assure him there will be no of those tonight or
He didn’t answer.
“This, this, this and this” Harry didn’t even look. He just grabbed anything his eyes found decent and beautiful and handed them to the staff that follows them around. Dracy is just walking beside him with their fingers intertwined. Something that Harry did when they just arrived in Diagon Alley.
His teeth is grazing the smooth skin and without informing him, she came. She gripped him by the wrist tightly to support herself from falling face first into the bed.
He grabbed a thong on the bed and bent down as he slowly put it on. He took his time in wearing the red thong. Making sure that the material glided on his skin softly, enticingly. He smiled when he can make out keen eyes on his back and the way Harry would be clenching his hands in a tight fist.
That left a bitter taste in his mouth. Harry’s name has such an elegant ring to it and his is fucking Mark. The same name of his ex that did nothing but question everyone he knows whether they put cereal or milk in their bowl first. Well, priorities are priorities but fuck the name.
Good or bad idea?
Draco rolled his eyes, fixing his posture up when he was sure he was decent, “You still have one round—
She nodded, “Someone was ringing the doorbell and didn’t want to open it”
“Come for me, kitten” Remus whispered so low if it wasn’t for his Padfoot senses, he wouldn’t hear. His breath hitched as he came and came, his stomach covered with spurts of his come, sticky but so good. His noises got caught in the air as his legs trembled in their place on Remus’ shoulder, so wide open to accommodate not only his wide girth but his whole body too.
Draco bit his lips. His hands slightly trembling and he fidgeted. His anger abated and it was replaced by disappointment. He felt like he just failed all of his NEWTs.
He buried his face at Draco’s sweaty neck, his tongue peeking to lick some beads sliding down at his throat. He angled his body to nudge at that bundle that reels Draco into his subspace.
“That’s my boyfriend!”
He walked over to her room and laid her down on her bed. He pulled the blankets to cover her body and walked out.
He smirked and unlocked the door, to breathe fresh air, only it didn’t budge like he expected it to. His brows furrowed as he made sure it really was unlocked and tried to push and pull.
It’s the tenacious smirk he disliked because it meant that he is enjoying it. They had another wonderful time two days ago. He was utterly blissed out, Harry cuddled him, they kissed, they had an amazing fuck—well, to be specific, all those finger fucking.
He can tell the truth or twist it a little bit but when he looked at his godfather, he saw him eyeing him warily.
“Fuck, you’re so pretty. You’re ready to take another finger, princess?”
It was an intense showdown. It is an intense showdown.
He moaned when Harry tugged on his hair once more, his head leaning against Harry’s shoulder and as he looked up at him, he met the eyes that’s not all so sweet now.
Through the hazy smog in her mind, she barely did what Harry told her to. Her nails dig to his skin as she hissed at her sensitivity. Her moans softened to gentle whimpers. Her right hand intertwined with Harry’s.
“They want to meet you”
He wanted the romance to be given to him, he wanted to receive things he can show off and wanted to be so spoiled he’ll cry himself to sleep because he’s so loved and so lucky.
Having an impulsive idea is dangerous but more often than not, in her case, they end up more entertaining than she expected.
Dracy gazed at him innocently and nodded, “It’s nice”
“So, Star—
It’s his favorite sight especially when he caught the ring on his finger, shining with the moonlight. Of course, he made sure to get one that displayed a real diamond. Nearly draining out his money with its cost but no worries, he could easily earn it back for the next few days.
He’s a force to be reckoned, emboldened moves that even the most heartless person cannot resist. He’s got the power to shift attention to him, walks with a purpose and long legs that just rules.
Harry hummed as he enclosed his hand around his cock and began to slid his hands up and down, “You’re not going to cum until I say so, kitten”
James blurted out, his voice coming out in a panic whisper, his vision as if it’s only seeing white, “And a nice sedative, please”
If he’s not so busy, he would call at night, talk to him and hum huskily ‘til he falls asleep and other times, he seduces him from the call, instructing him how to touch himself, edge himself, before he is allowed to cum.
Draco gasped. He temporarily forgot the anger he should be having. That came out of the blue. He was shocked hearing Harry refer to himself as his daddy.
. He and Draco are getting quite along well. What’s to doubt about that?
Although it felt a bit strange, he decided to forgo the thought.
He never slept with him in bed.
But it was thanks to her.
Harry nodded and waited for the staff to return which didn’t take long. He handed him the shoes and Harry accepted before kneeling in front of her. Dracy’s eyes were glued to Harry for his action.
The two remained strong, determined and stoic as they took in what the other is giving. One fueled by the knack of natural control and the other just because. Even from the distance between them, considerable feet away from each other, the heat in his gaze melted the cold ones in her own.
He wasn’t able to properly register it as Harry pulled away and pulled his fingers out. He vaguely heard his actions as Harry took his own cock out, giving it few languid strokes and groaning at the sight before him.
“How’s my baby girl?” he asked and stood inches away from her. Before she could even answer, he dipped his head low and gave her a kiss on the lips,
He tried to offer other viable candidates.
Just as he was about to cum with his legs shaking, Harry pulled away and chuckled when Draco groaned in complain. He was right there!
So, after months and months of sexual tension, all the touches, brush of fingers, accidental meetings, coy glances and suggestive bite of the lips, they have come to the conclusion that things have yet to come to an end.
“So sweet, baby”
Dragging a chair over to Draco’s sides, he straddled the seat and leaned his elbows on the back of it, “Sooo. . .” he drawled, prolonging the vowel.
“No harm delivery. Kingsley specifically ordered for recon only. No killings. Only close investigations”
Harry growled at his action and pulled back before slamming back in and Draco felt like he was seeing white spots above him. His nerves are wrecked, his hole clenching and his cock is bobbing on his abdomen.
Harry faked a gasp, “Brooding? I am brooding?”
“If you keep this up, I am going to cum, baby” he moaned, hips not able to help thrust into her mouth to which she happily accepted, moaning as well.
Draco whined when his body was slammed into the door, lips kissing his lips harsh, rough. His hands scrambling to hold onto the belt buckle of Harry’s trousers as he tried to pull him closer.
Many have fallen prey to what he can do but one person. The one who doesn’t cave to gather his attention, one who doesn’t kneel before him, one who doesn’t beg for a night.
Undeniably, she feels serene and right. However, at the back of her mind, she knew of his purposes. Of why she’s here. It’s only a matter of time before Harry would require her of her bedroom services.
Just little touches up and there and it’s good to go.
Unable to abate her curiosity, she opened her mouth, “Harry?”
“Yes, father. I am actually going to his office right now” he answered, “I have to go. Bye”
When he is already dressed, he walked out of his room and knocked on Harry’s bedroom to check if he was there but no one answered and when he opened it, he saw the room seemed to be too organized.
However, with Draco’s attitude, he’s always been on the wild side. From the fraternity he used to be in to the way he visits the bar frequently like how he visits the mall. His brand of alcohol weighs in something with value of seven percent alcohol and higher.
It’s a bit scary.
“Why aren’t you there with us?” Harry asked, standing in front of him, his abdomen bumping with Draco’s knees.
Draco smiled adorably as they are going up the stairs. He can very much feel Harry's eyes settled on his bottom and it's pushing him to sway his hips more, gentle to both sides and forcefully trying to make his ass bounce beneath his dress.
There was never hesitation before and he doesn’t know why he’s feeling it now. His nerves are starting to get in his way, almost the same way he felt back in the stage and for a fleeting moment, he had an epiphany.
He kept his eyes to the sight of her heaving chest, the way he was touching her and trying to soothe her lovely breasts and help his pregnant girl of whatever she is feeling. Her hardened nub rolled between his fingertips as he moved the other hand to cup her neglected breast and squeezing them for a few times.
Harry kissed his cheeks not long after and came inside him, filling Draco up which some of it spilled down his thighs onto the couch.
Harry shook his head, closing the laptop and Draco’s eyes hovered at it. Maybe the files are there? His eyebrows twitch as he leaned closer, making sure to show his chest before standing back up and transferring to stand behind his chair,
The secretary smiled politely, “I’m sorry, sir. But I was instructed not to let anyone—
“Are you sore?” he asked, palms gliding wetly across her back where he began to massage her, “Do you ache somewhere?”
She’s also sure of one thing. The man is full of experience and she dreads whether she wants to be scared at that or check it for herself. But as her body stepped closer to the man, she learned what her body chose.
He stood there and sighed deeply before looking up.
He leaned forward the counter and discreetly looked at where he pointed out. Truthfully enough, at the second floor, Tom was standing at the railings and conversing with a short man.
Dracy smiled, squeezing Harry’s hand, “Thank you, Andy”
What a sweet omega.
He tightened his hold before they began to bask in the silence. He knows Draco must’ve been floating in space. He patiently sat there, with him between his thighs, dropping kisses now and then.
Harry groaned before his mouth latched on one nipple as he did just as what Draco wanted. He lifted him off him easily before sliding him back down, effectively nudging his prostate and he was almost ashamed of the precum sliding down his shaft.
Harry sighed, “In the worst way”
“I’m sorry, sir” he apologized again.
Harry is holding her legs open, seeming that she cannot do it herself anymore for the weight she’s carrying in her tummy and the way she laid in his bed, wanting to arch her back to the sensations hauling her senses but can’t.
“Wake up! Christmas is here! Come on! We’re doing Christmas carols later!  Food’s waiting!” Seamus screamed at the top of his lungs, clapping when there are several groans heard from upstairs, “Wake up! I’m hungry, mates!”
Draco’s jaw dropped. Completely out of the blue that threw him off. He sniffed, tears quickly gathering at the corner of his eyes. He fisted Harry’s shirt and buried his face in  the crook of his neck, “I’m happy with you too, Harry”
Who really is Harry behind the title ‘one of the most influential man in the Ministry’?
He walked inside, ready to throw the well known Draco Malfoy century old tantrum but stopped when he saw Harry casually leaning back on the headboard, right hand resting at the back of his head while the other held a smoke he’s nearing to finishing up.
“Let’s go” Harry began to lead them out after kissing his forehead.
They’ve been swimming on circles for the last few days. Harry swimming away and Draco trying to swim closer to him, catch him. They never did swim to one another to communicate. That’s one thing they both had missed and now, it led them into this. And maybe it was not from lack of trying but more like, lack of courage on Harry.
He caught sight of him.
She whimpered.
“Why don’t you take a rest first while I go grab you some water and make us something to eat?”
“Re, ohh, fuck! Re!” Sirius moaned loudly, sobbing as he scrambled his hands to hold onto Remus’ bicep, “Love, shit”
Harry laid himself on the bed, his little boy staying to rest atop him and Harry began to hum a lullaby to help him sleep.
“Of course” Hermione butted in, “It’s what you do. What you always do”
He glare at Harry who hid a laugh behind his palm, “You took the lead. It’s on you”
“Yes” she managed to crooked out.
"I think I'll go look around the whole area" Harry stood up and is about to walk away when Draco stood up and stopped him. "Why don't I show you around, Harry? After all I should be hospitable enough to tour you around"
But if he doesn’t win this, he’ll still get all the kisses he wants from the enemy. No one can say no to him, not even those goddamn lips of the modern generation. He smirked and hid from view, inspecting for security cameras, maids, or any shadow.
A generous action. One that showed him compassion, to give whatever this thing a chance. Loosen up and let go.
He sighed and faked a smile to Flitwick who huffed and walked away, letting the Headmistress fixed the ugly decorations.
“Little one—
"Yes, excellent" Harry knows it's not excellent.
Harry clenched his jaw at what he had seen because that ass laid out in front of him, covered by thin material that added up with sexiness, his for the taking, do what he can and wants to with it (and he for sure has million ways to play with it), have them jiggling in his palms and the idea that he can lick through the crack, claim and fuck.
Draco looked out of the window late at night. He’d been waiting for Harry for hours but where is he? He misses him already and even though, he’s starting to get drowsy, he refused to go to bed unless he sees Harry arrived from wherever he went to in a hurry.
Harry went to sit at the corner and watched them with crossed arms. He kept a close eye on Draco and wished for the man holding his waist to do something out of line so he could throw him in the fucking Azkaban.
“Straight to the heart, huh?” he commented and Draco snorted. What a lovely sound. How about a whimper, then?
Draco rolled his eyes, “Whenever I stare at you, I have this urge to just slap you with my hands”
“Do not call me Dray! You have no right, you bastard! You’re an arsehole!” he pointed at him and Harry sighed trying to control his own emotions.
His left hand tease his pert nipples, thumb rolling at at them playfully. Draco arched his back and cussed a million times.
“Mr. Malfoy, I do not think this is appropriate” he mumbled, though his voice came out a bit breathy.
He wanted to revert back to his old ways. Nag the man, argue with him, call him names and criticize everything he does but how could he be so childish and immature when he can see how much Potter have grown?
And being one influential Harry James Potter, he made sure to land himself the kind of Omega that can treat to his needs. Not just sexually but physiologically and definitely not emotionally. That’s out of bounds. The omega will just have to keep his Alpha traits at bay. Her scent can relax him especially when he wanted to be wild or reckless or in some secretive words, suffering with the issues inside him.
“Let’s leave them be” she murmured after casting a warming charm to the two of them.
…This doesn’t look like his room. He buffered before he realized. What the fuck?
“Let’s go! Party!”
It wasn’t the fact that someone painted with tattoos, glorious mane tied up into a messy bun, earrings, and have a casual smirk stretched on his lips that opposes the steely gaze on his eyes.
She smiled, “It wasn’t the potion, Harry. But it was also the potion”
No, he’s not one to be the Wizarding World’s golden boy.
Harry shrugged, “I don’t know a thing about diseases. I have to read. What the hell is bubbling frog disease?”
Just what the actual fuck is happening to him?
“T-that feels so good, Alpha” she moaned, shutting her eyes tight as she forced herself to keep silent. As kind Andy is to them, they cannot be so obvious of what they are doing inside.
“I’m just worried he didn’t like what happened between us. Although Dobby told me he left in a hurry”
Did he black out? Or did he just fall asleep?
“Shacklebee” Harry cut him off.
“No” he answered frankly, clearly bored out of his mind.
He bit his lips tight when he heard a rustle from his left side, even from a considerable distance he was well aware of that noise. The familiar heavy footsteps, a sound of nothing but a grave warning, the noise able to strike fear inside him, tremor feeding his whole being as he tried to control his breathing pattern.
“It’s pretty” he said and waved the dildo for Harry to see.
Of course, he didn’t. Maybe he can just smother him with the cushion? Or his lips? He’s definitely losing his mind. Just one day with this man and he’s already as messy as that silly nest above Harry’s head.
I want my boys happy, how was it? 🥺
“Look at you, baby. So beautiful for me, sweetheart. So beautiful laid out on my bed” Harry whispered as he rolled his hips enough to cause heavenly friction on their sex.
Oh well, he doesn’t plan to waste the glitter on his eyelids so he decided to walk over to the counter and order himself a drink.
Making sure all confidential files are locked in his drawer with a strong protection charms, he apparated to his house.
He smirked.
He shook his head and cleaned him up by summoning a small towel and wiped him with it, “I’m spoiling you, baby” Harry winked, “I’m still sorry for running away”
Harry smiled satisfied, “Thanks, Ron”
“Hmm,” Harry hummed, a hard expression set in his sharp jawline, “Some people are shits.”
“What if I already moved on with my life?” she asked hesitantly.
Deep breaths, deep breaths. Deep breaths.
Harry faked a gasp, “Okay. That twice stupid is hurtful. But I get to go in first. Hold on to my shirt, make sure no one snatches you away from me”
Draco sighed, “No wonder” he went back to his book.
When Harry pulled his head back, they stared at one another. Dracy feeling her heart started to feel like it was dancing rather than beating. Harry’s eyes were glazed with want and it is making her feel things, especially neediness.
He leaned forward to remove her ties and pulled his cock out. He did not let her speak as he held her by the waist and flipped her to her knees. She gasped in surprise, propping her upper body with her elbows and throwing her head back as Harry pushed inside without warning.
“So. . .” Sirius started, the ghost of his usual smirk resting on the corner of his lips and that familiar glint of mischief behind those eyes that’s usually fixated on Remus’ biceps and abs, “Do you have a boyfriend, Draco?”
Bewilderment ate his being as he tried to weigh the news brought upon him. He is engaged. He is engaged! He. Is. Engaged!
Seriously, how is this omega so controlled of his urges?
"I am not an angel"
It didn’t take long until they arrived in front of his house and as Draco handed the helmet back, he smiled, “Thank you”
He bid his goodbye one by one. Hugged them and a little minute longer to James because he's father is even more childish than him.
“’arry” she whined, eyes settling on the messy hair and the white shirt that should be considered illegal. It clung to him perfectly. She stood beside the Alpha and pouted at him, “Hungry”
It's nice as it is really confusing.
The books that Draco loves stay in the bookshelf of his captor’s cabin, he wasn’t even allowed to read it unless he can be what the man referred to as
Draco watched Harry walk out smiling before he closed his eyes and took a well-needed nap and hopefully dream about him.
Parvati turned and looked at him surprisingly and hugged him, “Harry! It’s such a surprise to see you here. How are you? Been a long time”
“Sir, please, fuck” Draco begged when he felt a finger swiped the slit of his cock, wiping away the precum that pooled there and letting it slid down to the base down to his balls.
Harry breathed heavily, his hands balled into a tight fist as he tried to reign the annoyance inside him.
McGonagall sighed, “Very well” she gesture her hands around them, pointing at the Hogwarts’ walls as she began to explain.
Harry smirked and was about to tease when Flitwick appeared on their side, a stern but amused expression on his face. Draco knew then they really are doomed.
Harry smiled, “See you”
He tried to ignore the chaos happening inside him, the war currently raging in, the fire and air hovering him uselessly.
Dracy’s left hand slid down and the next thing, Harry realized her fingers began to fondle with his balls, “Fuck, fuck, baby, oooh”
Although no matter how content he is for how the things currently are, he cannot help himself but wonder what would happen if they take this a little notch higher.
Harry’s eyes softened. He bent down and pecked a kiss on her lips, “If you’re ready to talk, I’m here. Come. I think I owe you a treat”
Fuck. He can just give in and ravish him in all ways Draco can handle.
“Darling, if we do not do this, we could risk our names in the muggle world which in turn may put as in danger in our world. We have to. We cannot expose who we are” his mother reasoned out.
Oh, fuck. So hot. Sirius cried out, moaned as Remus thrust into the hilt, driving him crazy. Not really caring whether they are in their home or not. James’ house is good as any other because if it has a bed, they will fuck on it.
He wants to be touched so bad. Want him to fill him up. Want to fill his cum dripping out his hole and want to feel Harry’s hard pounding. Want to feel how experienced Harry is in bed and how kinky he would be.
Harry smiled before taking a seat across her. The waiter approached them and stood at the side of the table and handed them the menu.
The next morning, with a determined perseverance to finish the job, Draco woke up early and got to the shower. He wore the disguise he wore yesterday, the wig and made sure it won’t come off with a simple whip of the hair.
Harry chuckled mirthlessly, “Your daddy”
Sirius all covered in his cum has always been a sight. But eventually, it has to be cleaned up. Abandoning his softening cock, his fingers wiped the cum off of his face before letting Sirius suck on them like he did seconds ago.
He tried to really. Fight the urge to look down to stare at the ass that when naked is enough to obliviate him of the right morals and have his restraint blowing off but he cannot help it. Honestly, it really is just squishy and that's something he had not seen from other people his age.
He is just about to try to speak when Draco stood up and left the dining.
He wasn’t able to answer as Harry pulled him to kiss. Draco moaned and hugged him, lips moving in sync.
Remus chuckled fondly and turned to Harry, “See that? It runs in the family”
He chuckled mischievously as he untangled his right hand, “You had your fun already”
, this is her moment to think she’s winning. The both of them knows he’s already the winner before all of these things started.
But Harry felt it too.
Draco was late.
For the next few days, she was sure Harry seems a bit distant. He’d be gone early in the morning with a simple note saying he have another emergency with Ron then just thirty minutes after she wakes up, Hermione would come and give her some company.
Draco side-glanced at him and smirked, “Mega dumb is showing. I told you, I’ll handle this, you idiot”
Draco who’s finally back on his self, smiled, “Nice to meet you”
He’s been whining inside him for minutes now and the first time he decided to show how annoyed he is having to endure Harry’s company, the man only chuckled at his state.
This time, she did hold back the gasp, her hands tightened its hold on his biceps as Dracy tried to keep her legs together.
“Come on. Wanna see you finger yourself baby boy. Want to see you stretch yourself wide for that dildo. Come on, baby. Fuck yourself for me”
Even if she’s a secret to the whole Wizarding World, it’s better than being recognized as someone who’s a failure just like her father.
He’s as much thankful to her in return. For now, his Alpha’s contained.
Dracy’s eyes turned to Harry at the question. That’s something she wanted to ask from him but decided not to when she saw Harry put the crib in his room. She was expecting that Harry wants the baby in the same room as his and who is she to complain if he wants that?
Harry didn’t answer him. He just gazed at him as if he didn’t know what to say and truthfully, he had forgotten what he should say. He really doesn’t know how to start. Draco is obviously mad at him and how can he calm him down?
“Ah, aah. Harder, harder” he requested, holding on tightly at Harry’s ass that he cannot resist slapping, hearing Harry snorting above him, “You really do have a thing with slapping, huh?” he whispered and bit on his earlobe.
She looked down, eyes gazing at the strong hands caressing her stomach. The father of their little beanie. How is this feels like a dream when in fact, it’s her reality?
He met Jake in a bar. Huhu.
He sighed and decided to finish up his morning jog to go drink for a coffee before taking a bath and go to the Ministry. He expects Draco to follow his instructions that he should stay here and besides, his visit only take half a day and he'll be back just right after lunch.
“Evans—
He nodded and gasped when Harry went inside with one powerful thrust. His hands scrapped at Harry’s back as he cried out.
He felt him gave a squeezed on his hand before gesturing at the three prying eyes watching the exchange.
Harry merely nodded and began to follow him and the way Draco is walking in front of him, hips seem to be swaying a lot more than yesterday is riling him up. He tried to look up and watch the back of the blond's head instead and listen to him talk but Harry is way too distracted.
Remus chuckled. He had a point. He pulled away and stood up.
Why was it so hard to crack Harry’s control? He has been doing his best and everything. He tried so hard to break in, destroy the binds that’s holding Harry back. And overall, have him.
He let out a throaty chuckle and darkened his gaze. He reveled in the slight hesitance that ceases her movements until she ticked her jaw and proceeded with her plans.
“Was it your plan all along?”
The soft smile is back on, “You’re in control of what you want to happen for this night. Want yourself to dance for me? Go on. You want to just sit and talk? We can talk about fluffy rabbits and anything you want to. You want to drink? The check’s on me”
He’s very excited for this night. It was so incredibly easy to convince Harry to go to the bar. After giving himself one last once-over, he heard a buzz from his door.
Kidding! :)
There aren’t any people, not even a shadow. It was peaceful, beautiful, and silent. Far different from Diagon Alley. Far from the gossips she have to endure.
became the center of attention for the next few days. The excuse not encompassing other people’s minds as the two of them were teased for the matching bracelets in their wrists.
“You regret it?” Draco found his voice breaking a little bit. Was it not good? Is he just saying that to save himself from telling the truth?
Sighing blissfully, he stood up from the dining chair and walked over to Harry standing shirtless by the stove, cooking their dinner. He hugged him from behind as the toll of today instantly melted with the problems Harry helped him solve, gone with the smoke, whisked away by Harry’s mere presence.
he’s one step away from begging really desperately. His skin felt like it was on fire as his mind stopped supplying anything good. All he could feel was the onslaught of pleasure seeping through his skin by listening to the filthy words, his voice, his warmth.
Whether or not this was such a good idea, he didn’t care. Two should play a game. It isn’t fair only Draco can enjoy such situation. If he’s getting something by teasing using his fresh and young self, Harry would grace him with what he can give for now.
“There it is” James smirked, “What about them?”
“Yes! Could you believe that?!”
“Him”
Harry has a lot in store for her. He sighed as he remained standing at his spot. He began to follow her actions, the way her feet glide to the floor like water, to the way the material of her gown hugs her body and the way it moves like a second skin.
“’arry” she called tiredly.
After their visit to St. Mungos, Andy let them use her floo and Harry took him in an unfamiliar place. It looked new.
Draco bit his lips, unclasping his hands from his robe and let it touch Harry’s wrists, taking in some support as goosebumps erupted from his skin. He had a lot of names before and had a lot of experiences with how men treats him.
“Thank you. You look handsome and hmm, smells good too” Draco said, ducking his head and sniffing at his neck. Harry was wearing an all-black ensemble and it was enough to turn on Draco even more.
“He doesn’t look like cockybee to me” Harry murmured beside Draco as they stared at the man who walked in the restaurant, eyes scanning the crowd until it settled on them. A small smile graced his face as a woman followed him from behind.
“Why are you looking at me like that?! Hey! It’s the puppy inside me, Moony!” Sirius stomped and walked away dramatically.
Luna’s enigma as clues. The stares, the smiles, the phrases.
“Where. . . where do we go now?”
“D-daddy, please, need you”
“You’re so fucking hot, baby. Always so hot for daddy. Wanna fuck you so bad. Show everyone how easily I can bare you in my hands. So desperate and slut for daddy and daddy only”
Draco gulped, eyes wide as he took in Harry’s appearance, closer than a second ago. He was even more handsome up close, really broad and surely, the strength in those muscles can do whatever they like.
With the Great Hall waiting, it is the celebration that will open for something more. They will soon end the year with new things, moving on with better ones.
He had experiences joining them on their quest. A week getaway in Cuba and friendly races among the busiest streets with risky bets of who gets to do the laundry or who gets to cook the barbecue. Because no matter how much they are seen as a team, a gang, or a pack, they’re much more like family.
He looked back and glared, “Did I stutter,
However, the moment just felt kind. It felt nice. It felt good. And most, it felt
He sighed and looked around. The room was spacious, wide, and beautiful. So hygienic and as Pansy told him, it's their suite. The limited one who’s only used by people with money, status.
It was an office. He fist bumped the air as he smiled. See? He’s fucking good at this. He went to the desk and grabbed any papers he find useful enough and stole the laptop. Go big or go home. That’s what he’s doing.
He reveled the way Draco’s jaw dropped before he rolled his eyes and shivered as if disgusted, “That’s so gross, Mr. Potter!”
“Fine, fine. Let’s talk. And I meant to really talk”
McGonagall’s lip formed into a thin line as her eyes sharpened. She straightened her back, preparing to leave, “I both need you to get along from now on. Things are fine. That I assure you”
Harry's body is everything. He wants to feel how powerful those hands can be and wants him to tower his body. Look at him with those intense eyes and make him moan and whimper deliciously. However, Draco should play his cards right because one wrong move might turn Harry away. He cannot have that. He cannot let him slip away. And last night, he was able to sleep peacefully while dreaming the older man's name, Harry. His dreams are assaulted by his name and the hands that could choke the life out of anyone.
“Relax, father. I’ll get what you want in no time” Draco mumbled over the phone, keeping his father updated to what’s happening. But making sure to leave the physical touches out of the way, he doesn’t need to know his tactics to get some important stuff.
Dracy blinked confused and before it could even register to her what is happening, Harry had immediately grabbed the camera away from the person’s hands and glared with all his might.
“Did so good, kitten. You did so good for me, so perfect” he praised, tossing the cloth aside as he laid them both onto the bed, letting the smaller man rest in his chest, "That was quite a performance, baby"
“Go” Harry cut him off coldly, not giving Draco space to argue.
Harry smirked, “Possessive, I like that”
Harry jumped as if he was burned when he felt a hand smacking his arm. Malfoy snatched the juices without looking and added it to the cauldron while muttering under his breath, “Can’t even focus”
Harry stared at her surprised expression and kissed her forehead. She smells so sweet.
Harry looked at her and shrugged in cluelessness. Not sure whether the question was directed with his eight year in general or something more specific. Maybe she knows what his intentions are.
, please sir, need to cum” he begged, crying a bit more as he gasped and panted, sweat pooling on his forehead.
“Aah, faster” she urged, trying to raise her hips to meet his thrusts but Harry pulled back and looked at her sternly, “Let me fuck you” he whispered and she was whimpering loudly as Harry suddenly set up a punishing pace.
“It’s hard. If you really don’t want to go now, we don’t have to” he spoke, chin resting on top of her head.
He gulped as he felt Harry slid up even more and licked his inner thighs. Draco tried to buck his hips up but Harry held him back, “Stay still, baby”
The woman gasped in shocked, “Y-you can’t!”
Dracy stood there, feeling her heart thumping like crazy as she seemed to suddenly lose her voice. Harry was gazing at her as if he was observing her and studying her. He began to brush a thumb over her cheekbones and finally, opened his mouth.
“Little prongs! Nephew!” Sirius stood up, giving Draco a hug before engulfing Harry in a tight embrace and whispering over his ear, “Bendy, right?”
“You’re so hot, baby” Harry complimented. He pecked a kiss on her breasts one more time before putting the bra back on its respective place and helped her put her shirt back on.
The next thing Harry realized, his head was turned to the side, grasping his cheek in surprise but also with a sprinkle of heat in a moment, he looked at him.
He made the bold move to ease his own hand up to the senator’s thigh, nails digging to his inner thigh. With bated breath, he let it rest inches before his cock. His palm rubbed at the spot leniently, keeping what was happening under the table.
How the fuck is he still so calm while she was already so ruined? She sobbed tearlessly. Tugging at her ties that just won’t budge.
"Hmm, you look young. How old are you?" Draco asked
Draco stopped and gaped. He screamed and ran to his room where he immediately took a face mask and wore it over his face. Love is in the air! No! He must look out!
Dracy bit her bottom lips which Harry thought was a huge mistake because he suddenly wanted them on his own.
But the Ministry just had to come between that. He doesn’t even know what he has to do with this. They were talking about cases involving the Romanian organization that set their footing in an illegal business.
It was not a game of submission because both of them knew even from the beginning Draco is nothing but compliant. It’s his card, the key that Harry was hungry for.
“Harry, please, oooh” she didn’t know what she’s saying please for but at the moment, it didn’t bother her. She wanted to cum but she also wanted to prolong the sensation. Wanted Harry’s magnificent tongue on her even more, the wet and warm mouth that enveloped her wetness, the thing that slid in and slowly explored her insides.
That raised a few more questions but when he collected himself, he found Luna in Neville’s company as they get ready to go to the Great Hall for the feast. Yeah, they’ll never getting it.
“Wow. Now, you want me to listen. Demanding things. Who do you think you are?!”
"Don't challenge me, little boy" he said coldly, masking the way his cock throbbed inside his jeans. He refuses to act on it.
“I’m engaged?!” Harry asked in confused delight.
This part is perplexing too. Why is Harry being so casual with all of these? As if things aren’t skeptic enough. They had a potion in them, something that has pearl dust in it. This is dubious.
He lazily opened his eyes and grind his ass to Harry to send his message. Harry’s gaze darkened and a smirk appeared on his lips before taking his cock out and pumping it for a few times, “Going to fill you up so good, sugar. Going to fuck you and ruin you hard for anyone else”
“Is this okay?” he asked as he wrapped a hand around the stool Draco is sitting on causing for him to lean closer.
He had brought her as a slave but respected her in some ways.
“I know that smirk, Potter. And no”
“Son” his father winked, already knowing what’s going on his mind and Harry grinned deviously.
“Fuck” he swore and shook his head.
“Do you think… do you think this is still the potion?”
His sleeves rolled up to his elbow and Draco found himself admiring his thick arms with fine strokes of hair and veins hard against the skin, it looks bloody gorgeous. And Draco really doesn't have an inclination to beards but found Harry's fascinating. It isn't dirty or messy like the hair on his head but hot. It makes him more mature and the glasses that did nothing to obscure the intensity of those eyes.
They were currently spying on Tom. Draco prayed to all who was willing to listen that hopefully they’ll be able to find something important. He yelped in surprise when he was suddenly yanked on his feet with a firm hold on his arms.
About something they’ve been setting aside for weeks now.
“Cute” he praised, pulling him close, “Let’s go. I’m hungry”
It was huge.
They did.
"Good morning"
Thus, it began.
But no. Because the woman chose to be such a tease, chose to match the way he stares, the way he unabashedly look at her from head to toe, chose to mirror his actions and chose to rile him up.
Biting her lip, she complied. Her heart’s beating frantically inside her chest. She doesn’t want to be punished but Harry’s gentle eyes told her he wasn’t going for a punishment. When she was in front of him, he pulled her into his lap sideways and leaned his chin above her shoulder, his arms encircling her waist to draw her closer to his warm body.
His father came into view, face contorted with sarcasm. Harry rolled his eyes at him, “Hello, Pa” he hugged his father before giving his mom a kiss on the forehead.
“I’m sorry” he apologized, pecking her neck to her collarbone.
Blaise and Pansy snorted, “Congratulations for being the last to know”
Harry scowled, "Not long enough" he lied and missed the way Draco's eyes glinted mischief. What a cunning Slytherin.
“No” Draco cut him off then met his eyes, “I will not listen to you. I don’t need your excuses. If you didn’t like what happened then suck it the fuck up!” Draco glared at him one more time before walking away to go to his bedroom.
“This may sound so weak of me” he began and Dracy really wanted to make him stop. Doesn’t want to force his story out on his lips that kissed her with kindness but now is about to tell a story that never touched anyone’s life, “But I was traumatized”
"What?!"
Dracy leaned on him and smiled at the wall she’s staring at.
He pouted and looked up, sporting the innocent puppy look.
Hmm. It’s worth the try, isn’t it? Well, it’s not like he tried in the first place. He haven’t got his dick out yet.
He gulped. Unable to pick one instantly. What’s it for anyway? If he pick the former, he’s still bound to this obsessive behavior that ties him inside the cabin. If he pick the latter, one can obviously see it is still a punishment. A much more endearing punishment Draco wasn’t sure he will hate or he will love.
“But the two of us have always been running around a bit strange. Why acknowledge this to be weird now?”
“I’ll protect you, okay? I’ll never leave you. I’ll be beside you along the way, taking care of you, and doing everything you want me to do”
He’s not here for the psychology for it all. He’s not here for the logic behind. He’s not here for anything educational. He’s fucking here for the money, for the excitement, he’s here because he fucking can and has the talent to make up for his stripper name.
Andy smiled at the sight before clearing her throat, “I know this is a very private matter, Sir Potter. I assure you no one would hear about this”
Harry had his motor ready and straddled it and beckoned for Draco to sit behind him.
He shuddered at the thought and bit his bottom lip.
“What is it?” he asked impatiently, “It’s bad, isn’t it? I inhaled pearl dust and now, I’m having this thoughts and reactons and—
“Fuck! My fault again? What is this?” Harry said, seemingly forgetting how to use magic, “It’s fucking bad”
He haven’t done anything sexual yet but Harry had driven him up to incoherency.
Draco watched him, eyes scanning from any signs of anger but there weren’t any. He doesn’t know if he should be relieved or not.
He took a deep breath and a moment to make sure he can answer smoothly, “I like orgasm denial, edging. I have a choking kink, light pet play. Blindfolds are fine, handcuffs sure, degradation  and praise kink”
All he wanted is to impale himself and reach his own orgasm, putting all frustrations on his actions.
“Fuck” harry swore, holding him by his hips to guide him up and down, not bothering to muffle their noises. The outside is as noisy as them and it’s not like his gang is going to judge their choice of location.
“He’s beautiful, isn’t he?”
When they both nodded, Andy began to work on her magic and showed them a moving image of the baby. She can already feel her tears bubbling in her eyes at the sight of their little beanie, already has a steady heartbeat and the occasional movements.
Blaise snorted, “I bet. That man has no regards for rest and leisure. Like someone we know” he gave a meaningful glance at Harry’s way who chuckled softly.
He felt like suffocating by the sound of that voice, feeling strong arms holding him firmly as he let another sob wrecked through his whole being.
His eyes traveled down and grinned when he saw a bulge so good in the eyes. He surely caused that. And it showed that Harry's been standing there long enough to elicit such reaction.
He gasped, hands harshly tugging on his wrists and ignoring the sharp stab of pain it caused. Harry’s tongue licked the head of his cock, gathering his precum on his mouth and tasting his juices.
Harry made sure to pin all of Ron’s statement in mind to think about in his room, “Why are you so expert on this?”
Draco felt the signs of an upcoming smile so he hid it by clearing his throat, “Even if I’m a stripper?”
Harry lightly frowned at his cup, “Where’s Ron?”
Harry groaned. He would’ve love to see Draco finger himself open ready for his cock. It would’ve been such a sight from his angel. His primal need increasing even more and taking the small flask of lube he kept in his jean pocket, he poured some to his fingers and rubbed it on his cock and Draco’s throbbing hole.
She shrugged, “Blibbering humdingers. They’re bothering you again?”
Harry sighed and stood up, tossing the Daily Prophet aside, he step closer to Draco, “It’ll pass”
Harry looked at it and shrugged, “Luna gave it to me. Saying something about keeping wrackspurts away. Why— oh”
If it wasn’t for Harry’s agile reflexes, he would be on the floor right now. His thick arm encircled his waist to steady him and when Draco was able to process the action, he gasped and pushed him off.
Harry’s eyes widened, thinking he’d done something wrong but Draco simply pushed him into the chair and straddled him, “Can’t wait, Harry. Need you” he cried, grabbing his cock and the small bottle of lube.
Pansy sighed at his sarcastic tone then closed the book she is holding, “What’s got your thong in a twist?”
“Ms. Lovegood’s been rather confusing, I know. And I assure you, she means well” she cut him off before her hands clasped to one another, “You’re not going to let this go, are you?”
It was the gesture that Draco appreciated. His small actions to make sure Draco doesn’t feel left out. His eyes failed not to be too obvious in staring but the light he can see in Harry’s face. The freedom of showing what he feels to his friends without the fear of judgment is magic.
“So, something is wrong?”
He continued to walk away but stopped when he felt a hand around his wrist.
Her fingers began to caress his torso. Starting from those abs to that finely build chest, she looked at him straight in the eyes before slowly, she bent down and peppered him many lovely kisses. Giving him love bites and inhaled his scent that enveloped hers as if they just connected, been intertwined and formed a spark that can never be achieved with a mark on the nape.
He felt him smile, his breath fanned his ear before speaking, “More, little one?”
. . . Perhaps that did not come out right but you get his point.
Dracy blinked like an idiot. Okay? That’s it? Okay? No big deal? That sounded so bad. Worse than the thought of Harry mad at her for something she cannot even control.
Ron perked up and smiled, “Did she propose?”
He gasps when he felt a firm hand on his wrist that stopped him from walking, followed by a voice that nearly sent him moaning, "You're not going anywhere, little one. You're staying here"
“I don’t”
Oh, how she wishes it’s just that. But she wouldn’t pressure or force him into anything. They both have suffered enough. His traumatizing past had haunted him throughout the years and last thing Dracy needs to do is to rush him.
He tutted, “Ah, ah, ah”
Draco thought for a minute. Then beaming happily before he nodded enthusiastically.
The first thing she noticed upon their arrival was a cozy living room. Easy to the eyes, refreshing, and definitely homey. It felt like the safehouse they went to in France but even more relaxing. It was absolutely spacious and wide.
So, without further complains, he decided to wear the bracelet. The bright color surpassing his pale skin, it stands out among the rest. Especially when younger students looked at him, even though he received backhanded compliments he decided to keep it on his wrist.
“Harry” Lily called.
“Relax, bunny. This is fun, don’t you think?” he toyed with him, lips touching his ear, not really kissing but teasing.
Harry hummed and shrugged nonchalantly, “Who knows?”
Harry nodded and huffed. Draco chuckled lowly and grinned, "Do you want to see my bedroom?"
“Hmm” Draco through mouthful of Harry’s cock. His hands gripping Harry’s thighs to keep himself from kneeling because if he wasn’t holding to something, he’ll collapse.
Draco pouted even more, “But I want to be with you. Can’t you stay?”
“You’re asking me to go with you in the bar?”
“Fuck baby” Harry groaned.
“Harry!”
Harry opened a door and stepped in. When she opened her eyes to try to look, she noticed they were in her bedroom and he carefully laid her down on her comfortable bed.
He wondered how it would feel if his nails dig crescent-moon shapes on them, bruises, scratches. He perked up as Harry turned around, dangling on his hands are a handcuffs and a blindfold.
He saw how his eyes were stuck on his ass before sweeping it back up and it's thrilling. It's so good to see the obvious desire in those emerald eyes but trying so hard to hold back.
Harry peppered kisses all over his shoulder blades, nipping playfully at his nape and his fingers rolling at his nipples. Like any other, they would rest for a while until Harry thinks it’s a good  time to pull out then go.
He was right. The feel of Harry’s beard is magical. It’s incredible. So wondrous. It scratches his smooth skin marvelously, it convinced him that this isn’t a dream, that this really is happening. His hands wandered around those rippled shoulders, feeling some scars and the hard chest, to his back and abdomen, Harry is so gorgeous.
He went back in and straight to his bedroom where he saw Draco no longer there. He shook his head and showered. Afterwards, wore his Auror robes.
“Harry?”
She held her chest by the sudden voice. She smiled and nodded, trying to look convincing which she’s sure she wasn’t able to achieve because Harry had his eyebrows furrowed. Taking his steps closer, he opened both of his arms and she did not hesitate to walk into them, burying her face in his rock hard chest and sniffed. There’s a new scent in him. Cinnamon. Something which surprisingly, relaxed her.
"Thank you daddy" Draco thanked him and closed his eyes.
“Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you?!”
Draco shivered as he slowly buffered the meaning of his statements. Felt cold ice water metaphorically washing over his figure.
Just one look of his Moony’s intense gaze, he will know what kind Sirius needs for the day and just one blink at Remus’ direction in return, Siri would know how rough or how soft they want this to be.
Dracy was loosing her mind. Fuck, she’s loosing her mind, flying away as her mouth began to work before she could even have time to process everything that’s being done to her. Her thighs flex weakly as she felt the coiling inside her.
And he’s going to get this now.
He tried to focus and nearly spelled himself to really focus when the first few minutes made his mind wander to that pale skin, smooth and soft, too young in his touch and foreign on his fingers but not unpleasant.
Harry sighed and looked at his wrist watch. It’s already time for breakfast and he had asked Wily to cook them their meals. He didn’t bother waking the omega up, thinking she needed a thorough rest.
“I do. You’re breaking it every fucking time”
"Stop this, Draco"
“I’m burning this apartment down!”
Beneath his closed eyes, he saw what looked like to be images of a smiling woman and a giggling kid. Not unaware of the picture, he knew it seemed to be his future flashing before his eyes. And hoped it would be just so.
“I’m leaving” she harshly announced and walked away, wanting to begin packing right away and return to where she used to be. Back in that crampy place. Who cares?!
“I suppose we are” he admitted. He wanted to ask some questions but the Headmistress cut his line of thought.
Harry sighed, “The midnight sale doesn’t sit right to me. Get back to the apartment and I’ll handle this”
“A magic for his own which is not something we can negotiate. That minister have no wizard blood on him so we could not provide him anything. He did not take that reality well and so, broke the agreement we had signed”
Or is he going to prey in slowly, strutting gradually, stepping with sharp calculation as not to miss his goal? Hit the hay? Score the game? Win the game?
McGonagall sighed, “I reckon you want to talk about something, Potter. What is it?”
And it definitely did not help the hunger that blossomed inside him.
He heard Draco gasped and wrapped his hands around his nape. Harry groaned roughly and held him by his hips and lifted him up. Draco encircled his legs around Harry’s legs.
Harry clenched and unclenched his jaw. He walked over to her and crouched down. Dracy immediately encircled her shaking hands at his nape and kissed him, moaning instantly. Harry inhaled, pressing his clothed erection to her wet pussy and grunting.
His eyes widened as he tried to pull back but Harry only tightened his hold on him before tucking the other side of the blanket on him, “Relax, Draco” he whispered near his ear.
Draco’s jaw dropped. His mind lagging.
The lot laughed. He ignored that. He was battling with war fueled rage. The need to yell nearly winning.
He gasped, eyes going wide as he gaped at him.
It feels kind of he adapted into Harry’s lifestyle and he misses this.
He moaned when a thumb prodded at his bottom lip, running across the smooth skin before dipping the finger inside, resting above his tongue as he was overhauled by sensations on his neck. Harry’s lips biting a shameless mark on his skin, tongue laving at the slight burn that came with it.
When he didn’t answer, Harry continued, “I shouldn’t have done that”
“Dray”
Harry breathed deeply. Ignoring the way Draco looked like he wanted to chuckle. He's rejoicing the effect he had on him.
“Words that were told in a prophecy led you have the life you never wished for”
“Hmm” Harry acted as if he was giving it a thought, “No”
He’s sweet and all kinds chivalrous. The hope giver to the ones who’ve lost the ability to and the goodness of the world they thought have been consumed by darkness. He was the one who made Draco believe there’s still beautiful ones in a place full of monsters.
Did they seriously do this in Andy’s office?
His lips parted into an O when Harry inserted a finger, not giving him enough time to adjust at the sudden intrusion as he began to pump in and out, rotating it to the side as he began to stretch him out.
It was so good.
For once, he saw an uncontrolled Draco, unrestricted and letting him see what he is feeling. After a while, Harry entered another finger to scissor him, easily stretching the tight hole and loving the squelching noises his fingers produce as he thrusted, his fingers lightly grazing the prostate as Draco clenched down on him.
Draco clenched around him tightly. His hands grasping Harry’s bulging biceps, resulting from lifting him off and using him like a cock sleeve. He moaned, trembled, and whimpered as Harry pounded harshly, nudging at his prostate in every thrust, in every roll of his hips.
"He moreso needs someone in the house with him because the last time we left him alone, someone robbed the house and he was bleeding"
He’s not getting any sense right now. What the hell is Luna talking about?
It was a little uncalled for… Or maybe, really uncalled for.  After all, this should not be the kind of their game but for some twisted magical entity hovering above their heads, they stepped in beyond the line that wasn’t really there before.
Harry chuckled, unconsciously pulling Draco closer to his side, “Well, we’re new to the neighborhood”
“Why?” he asked in whispery tone, his raging hard on flagged down a little, confusion ebbing in his system.
Harry chuckled, “You can call me Harry”
All throughout his time on the pub, he only served a number of customers, some who came in for a quick snack and coffee for afternoon time. He thought they’re taking a rest on the motel they’re staying at, considering they’ve been stuck at his pub for days and just wanted to relax on their beds.
She let out one sincere and genuine smile after a long time, deciding to give an answer the two needed to figure by themselves, “It’s love, boys”
Harry clenched his jaw and walked over to her, pulling her close to his chest and kissed her on the lips before immediately burying his head at the crook of her neck.
“Would it be served or to go?”
“Even without the magic, I can feel how healthy the baby is going to be”
Then his smirk turned into a grin as he began to walk closer, easily putting his hands on his pocket, “Who’s this dollface over here?”
“We have a lot of catching up to do” Harry added after licking his finger. He sat up and scoop Dracy in his arms easily, “But first, let’s both get in the shower”
Harry chuckled, “Nothing, babe. He just gave us an invitation to a party tonight so better get ready for whatever”
“Harry” she complained. Her hands began to dip down to feel Harry through his jeans. Her own action stuttered for a bit when Harry sucked, sending jolts of desire straight to her core, drawing more slick from her pussy. She’s sure she would be dripping by now.
Then her eyes turned to Harry.
He rolled his eyes and pushed the door open, smirking when he immediately saw the man he’s looking for. He was busy on the phone with the laptop turned on in front of him.
“We have the night, little one. We can do as much and as little, as gentle and as soft, as respective and dignified. Say the word, say whatever and I’ll grant them for you”
“You sure you’re in the right place? Shouldn’t you be lounging in the common room or Quidditch pitch?” he crossed his arms.
No! No!
He walked in and greeted his old friend, “Parvati”
But as they waited for the groceries to be packed, Harry raised a hand and wiped a sweat away from her forehead. The simple gesture of affection spurred more shock in everyone’s faces and as Dracy was becoming to grow uncomfortable, the Alpha spoke,
“Sixty for a bouquet, five for a stem”
“I’ve been planning this moment as well” he nibbled on his earlobe, tugging at it playfully.
“Ooh, Harry” Draco quakes, his nails digging through Harry’s skin. He growled on his neck when he felt the pain that came with it but still superb. He lifted Draco’s shirt off and threw it away somewhere.
“Would you, uhm, would you mark me?”
Almost twice his age.
He sighed and stood up. Maybe he’s going back today to freshen things up and finally, face the boy.
“What are you doing here?” he asked.
“You’re gorgeous, you’re savage that it stabs me straight to the heart and would love to spank you for all the slaps you gave me” he winked and Draco found himself slightly fidgeting in his seat..
“Hmm, good” she mumbled, her hands sliding around Harry’s waist, “What about you, ‘arry?”
“They do because in this scenario, you’re a cheating bastard and you’re sleeping in the couch!” he messed with his hair and lifted Harry’s luggage and threw it to him, “You’re not sleeping in here with me”
Unlike before, he didn’t shy away from the subject. He knew this topic of conversation would come out sooner or later and he had to be ready. Especially when it’s their family that they are building together.
Dracy immediately encircled her arms around his nape, opening her mouth and letting the man take control. She’s loving this.
Harry winked at her before taking hold of the bouquet and handing it to her, “I don’t know if you love tulips but I hope you like them”
“H-harry?”
“Fuck” he swore and ruffled his hair.
