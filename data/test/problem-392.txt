“I know that, Harry.”
Potter gasped softly, hands hovering over Draco’s stomach, almost as if he were afraid to touch. “Draco . . .”
Pleasure swirled in Harry’s stomach.
He wondered what his mother would think. They hadn’t written in ages, because Draco couldn’t look at her without seeing
The pair made their way back to the sitting room, and Draco willed his hands not to shake. He was holding a hot beverage, after all. Piping hot.
Harry reached down and palmed Draco’s aching erection, and he arched into his touch, purring softly.
“Only if you want to. If you want to help yourself, answering the questions is the first step.”
“But-”
“I-I . . .” Draco looked incredibly flustered, and to Harry’s dismay he sighed and wiped at his own face. He wasn’t
“I have no words,” Draco said truthfully. “You’ve gone and left me speechless, Potter.”
to him? That would be . . . Well, that would be perfect, in Draco’s opinion, and Draco didn’t deserve perfect. Not after what he’d done.
Potter’s eyes widened. “Why on earth not?”
“Because I-” The words died on the tip of his tongue. He couldn’t say it. It was too huge. “Because I care about you.”
“Don’t fight it, sweetie, that’s it.”
hugged him like this, not even after the night he had received the Mark and she’d come into his room to check on him.
“Until what?” Annie prompted.
“Draco, you never need to ask,” said Harry. “I could fuck you every day and never tire of it.”
Ginny nodded, and the pair made their way over to Harry’s sofa, plopping down and getting comfortable.
reminder. He found himself nodding fervently, exhaling heavily through his nose.
“No. I want to keep going.”
Draco sighed. There was no use further tangling himself in a web of lies. “Okay, yesterday afternoon.”
with him.”
“Okay, so back to your mystery beau.” Ron had a mischievous glint in his eye that Harry didn’t like at all. “Did he go to Hogwarts? Is he someone from work?”
“Think about it,” said Pansy. “He doesn’t have a kid anymore. He’s
Harry felt as though he had just gotten off a merry-go-round.
Frustrated, Draco wrung his lightly shaking hands together in an effort to get them to stop. “I didn’t say I’m responsible for the
“I am not. I told you, I’m only shagging him.”
“That’s it, beautiful,” Harry praised. His face twisted in pleasure, and Draco was right there with him; for the second time tonight, he felt pleasure curling in his abdomen, and he was close. He was so close.
Potter’s eyes widened comically, and he looked positively flabbergasted. “You . . . You don’t know what a
Draco huffed. “I shouldn’t have to explain it, Harry. You have a saving-people thing, which is fine. I just don’t want to be a part of it.”
Pansy’s words struck a nerve.
yourself at him, for Merlin’s sake. I’m only saying this miscarriage opened back up the mere possibility of . . . something starting back up between you two.”
That malignant concern that had sprouted when he answered the door began rapidly metastasizing inside his body.
“Looks like our childhoods weren’t so different after all,” said Harry, pistoning his finger deeper into Draco.
It was all too much and not enough at the same time.
him, and disrupting his life like this. He needs serious help, and I can’t give that to him.”
Draco wanted to stuff his face into the pillow and scream. This nurse, Debbie, knew
Harry gave Draco an oversized Chudley Cannons tee shirt and a pair of boxers. Draco found the clothes to be quite comforting not because they were particularly soft, but because they smelled like Harry.
“Brilliant, I already have some brewing,” Potter said, walking into the kitchen. Draco followed.
It was an early spring morning when Hermione had her baby.
Draco tore up the letter with a loud
Potter exhaled shakily. “Alright, then. Let’s go.”
, he reminded himself.
“Come for me, Draco,” said Harry sweetly, taking one hand and fisting it around Draco’s weeping, ruby red cock. “Come all over my hand, all nice and hot and sticky.”
“I was only being polite because he’s Hermione’s husband.”
He turned to look at Harry, who stood wearing an expression he couldn’t discern.
“We engaged in a . . . Sexual relationship, of sorts. We established rules, where we weren’t allowed to ask personal questions or stay the night. But then Harry kept trying to break the rules. He kept telling me he loved me while we had sex, he even asked me to stay the night one time. It was all very emotionally jarring, you see.”
“You hurt him. Deeply,” she said. “He says in his letters and visits that he wants to trust you again, but he doesn’t know how.”
Harry pulled back from him, panting, hands thumbing Draco’s jaw softly.
However, when they landed on Draco, they lost a touch of their sparkle. Just a touch, but it was enough to make Draco droop like a dehydrated flower.
Draco received a letter from Pansy about a day after their row.
“I think it’s pretty obvious that’s what you want.”
“Do you?”
All his orgasms with Draco were earth-shatteringly brilliant, he noticed.
Harry wanted to hold this man close and never let him go again. How had he gotten so lucky?
“I love you so much, baby,” said Harry, and he was clearly a little out of his mind. “So much.”
dangerous. Draco didn’t make nice with any of the patients who attempted to talk to him, instead opting to sulk and bury his head in mind-numbingly boring books without even an iota of plot. He stayed away from the telly, because it was always crowded and people hogged the remote, and he often paced in the hallway, doing laps as a means of relieving his anger at being held against his own fucking will.
Draco couldn’t suppress his smirk. “I missed this,” he said.
“There are ways you can cope with the pain- I would know, I’ve been doing it for the past seven years,” Harry told him. “You need someone professional to talk to, someone who can help you, the same way I’ve been helped.”
“Ah, ah, ah.” Harry’s hand on his back pushed him back into place. “None of that.”
“Brilliant.” Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to slap her or himself.
Harry walked across the small living room and picked up his coat, putting it back on hurriedly, wanting nothing more than to leave Draco’s space.
“Shut up.”
“It’s just me,” said Harry. “What happens tonight stays between the two of us, forever.”
“I do.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered shut.
It took Harry a moment for her words to sink in. He gasped quietly, recognizing what she meant. “So you mean-”
“Well, enough with the foreplay, out with it already.”
Draco only stared at her, aghast.
Horrified, Draco snapped out of his trance. “You’re right. I just regressed, all because of a stupid
“You will do no such thing.” She enunciated the
“Because I feel like I can really talk to you,” said Potter, continuing the circles and looking at Draco as though he had no idea how affected he was by it. Maybe he did. Draco didn’t know.
“Everything okay?” he asked so casually it made Draco’s heart shrivel up inside.
said Ginny. “I want to get married when I’m in love.”
But he couldn’t tell him how vile he found Harry’s affair with Weasley because they weren’t together- not in the way Draco wanted, anyway.
It was going to be slow and torturous. Just like his life.
All the blood rapidly rushed from Draco’s head, swelling in his cock.
“This one’s also a delight,” Potter said, pointing to another option further down on the menu. That burger came with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, and Monterey jack cheese. But Draco could no longer focus on the burgers because he was engulfed in Potter’s
“I know.”
Harry grinned and kissed him.
, that wasn’t supposed to come out.
Draco’s heart ached for Harry.
Draco Malfoy, reads Muggle books?”
“And I’m going to respect Draco’s privacy.”
And as Draco finished the rest of his closing duties with Harry leaning against one of the shelves and whistling lowly, he realized something. He realized that what he and Harry had may never be perfect. He was going to see the good, the bad, the ugly in Harry, perhaps all at once sometimes. But he had never been more okay with that.
“Draco, if you aren’t doing this for yourself, it’s never going to work. Do you really want to be his little fuck toy forever? Cause that’s where you’re headed until he comes to his senses and marries Weasley.”
“I can’t just force something that isn’t there,” Harry said, beginning to feel slightly angry. “I shouldn’t have to explain that to you.”
“I can’t,” said Harry. “I want the baby in my life, and Ginny has the power to take that away.”
of people’s lives,” Draco argued heatedly, sitting up straighter. “I help old people find books for their grandchildren. I recommend books I’ve read to people. I’m the gateway to people engaging in one of the healthiest habits there are.”
He thought maybe they were going to be okay.
“You fancied me in school,” Harry said in realization.
“I’d like that, Draco,” said Mother, smiling softly. “I’d like that very much. But, please, let’s sit. We have matters to discuss.”
“I’m just going to sit in here while you shower. You have five minutes,” the voice responded.
“I mean, you’re practically
“Not at all- But Hermione was a gem, bless her soul. She actually saw it coming, believe it or not.”
“What exactly did you say to her?”
“You’re breaking,” he murmured, sounding . . . worried? “Fuck, Draco, if you don’t want this-”
Potter only chuckled at his nervousness. “Just thought it seemed important to tell you. Once I figured it out, things that were seemingly out of place started making a lot more sense.”
upset. Is that clear enough for you?”
manners. I wasn’t about to bring up the topic of sex at the table, and ruin a perfectly good evening. It’s also rude when someone else is paying.”
Hi, all. I'm sorry this one's so short, but I wanted to get something out to you guys before I go back to school. Once I do, updates will slow down a lot. Thank you all for reading <3
It only took a few more strokes for Draco to spasm to completion, and his orgasm rippled through him like a rocket. He deflated onto the mattress, breathing heavily as Harry withdrew his fingers. Draco pulled him into an insatiable kiss, and they snogged until Draco’s toes were curling and he had eased off Harry’s trousers, gripping his leaking shaft and pumping hard.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, feeling as though he were walking on broken glass.
, he had Draco, and he was never letting him go again.
Every two weeks, like clockwork, Potter kept coming back. He waltzed in, charming and
“Don’t want him?” exclaimed Harry. “Parkinson, I want him so much it hurts.”
“Feel good?” Potter asked him, leaning over him and pressing a quick kiss to his knee.
“Ginny, he-”
Draco didn’t even have the mental stamina to feel relieved, because Potter had just
here, thank you very much, and I don’t need your input or advice. Furthermore, I definitely don’t need to end things with Harry when I’m perfectly content shagging him mindlessly.”
“You like it like this,” said Harry, pressing a kiss on Draco’s leg. “You like when you can see me.”
“I never said he didn’t,” said Annie. “Some people don’t know how to show it. If Harry isn’t in a condition to express his feelings for you in a healthy way, you need to learn how to set some boundaries for yourself.”
He couldn’t help himself. He ran towards her, closing the distance between them, and folded himself into her outstretched arms. He sighed audibly as Mother closed her arms around him, rubbing his back soothingly, squeezing tight. He didn’t think Mother had
“There’s no use talking about it now,” Draco said. “It’s over with.”
“Something’s
Draco blushed, and Harry resisted the urge to close the gap between them, sweep the stunning man off his feet, and kiss him until he was breathless.
. Oh, fuck, Harry, I’m never going to recover, am I?”
Draco frowned as Harry approached him cautiously, and sat down next to him on the sofa with a respectable distance between them.
Why had he said that?
Harry laughed. “You aren’t wrong there, darling.”
“That doesn’t sound cryptic at all.”
“Really?” asked Ginny. “Because it seems like that’s exactly the point.”
Draco peeked up at Harry. “There, I said it,” he said.
“Y-You do?”
“Of course. I’m not a barbarian.”
“Harry, I won’t last,” Draco warned, bucking his hips.
Draco ordered a water and his burger, the one with the garlic aioli, and Potter ordered the same thing with a polite please and thank you. The bartender whisked away, taking their menus, and the men were once again left alone.
“That’s hardly fair,” said Draco, willing himself not to cry. “Considering our past, I’d say I know you plenty.”
He followed her through the corridor into the sitting room, where she had a house elf fetch them some tea.
“Hey,” said Harry, “I’m so sorry. For everything.”
“I know,” Potter said, playing off his reaction.
What he had right now certainly didn’t count as an
He’d done that on purpose.
“Oh, don’t lump me with him,” cried Hermione.
“Are we done throwing our temper tantrums?” Pansy asked dully.
“No, I mean yes, I mean . . .” It was Harry’s turn to look exasperated. “I don’t appreciate being given a taste of my own medicine, Draco.”
Draco decided to change the subject instead. “So, how long ago did you become a Healer, Potter?”
“Oh my god,” Ginny said. “You aren’t just shagging him, are you?”
Draco sighed into his mouth as Harry nipped at the shell of his ear, swirling his tongue around in a way that made Draco shiver.
Draco felt a flush run all through his face and neck. He
“I knew she was a Rose,” Draco told her later, while Ron had gone to fetch her some water.
“I came because I, erm . . . I need some Draughts of Peace.”
“With what?”
Draco chuckled good-naturedly. “I shouldn’t just assume things like that, should I? For all I know, Harry could be telling the truth.”
“Bookshop in London,” Harry answered. “I was originally going to pick something up for Teddy, but then I just . . . Kept going back, I guess. I have a whole stack of books he recommended to me that I still have to read.”
Harry’s face flared up in what looked to be anger, and suddenly Draco was afraid.
. Of course not. I’m so sorry. After the story you just told me, I was so insensitive and I . . . I’m sorry.”
Draco shook his head again.
Draco sighed.
“Oh- Right.”
“I-I’m okay,” Draco lied even as another tear rolled down his face. “I just . . .I can’t . . . This is . . . I didn’t get her anything-”
Scoffing, Pansy stood up, running a hand through her black bob. “You’re fooling yourself, Draco.” She apparated on the spot.
Harry grimaced, and Draco frowned, concerned. This was the second time Harry had reacted strangely when Draco brought up his relatives.
“Are you apologizing for the way you behaved in school?” Potter asked him quietly. “Because you’re forgiven, Malfoy. I forgave you that day in the courtroom.”
“How I’m acting? Really? We’re going there, Hermione?”
“And don’t you
“That’s not what I asked.”
Draco frowned, stepping closer to him as though he were about to fade away. “Hey, what did I say?”
“I’d kiss all across your neck, your collarbones, and I’d pay extra special attention to those sensitive nipples of yours. But gently, of course. And then I’d kiss all down your tummy until I reach your aching, leaking cock, and then I’d kiss all around it, teasing you, giving you what you want instead of what you need. Because I know you like to be teased, Draco, as much as you won’t admit it.”
Draco could only nod, breathing picking up rapidly as Harry squeezed his waist and continued his thrusts. He added a third finger, stretching Draco impossibly wider, and he rubbed at his prostate delicately, sending tendrils of pleasure crawling up Draco’s spine.
“Draco-”
“I know that,” said Potter. “But we already know each other, don’t we?”
“Don’t be daft; no one knows where I am.”
“Are you seriously
“No, Harry. You . . .”
“I’m not going to be gentle today, baby. You want this. Trust me.”
“Oh.” Draco visibly wilted. Harry’s hold on him unconsciously tightened. “Hey, I was only trying to say-”
“I wouldn’t trust them,” said Hermione.
Pansy sighed. “Draco, you can’t go on like this. I’m not your mother.”
“Yeah. I’m alright,” Draco said lightly.
This all felt very disgustingly domestic as Draco retrieved the dishes, and his instincts were telling him to run away, to get the hell out while he still could. But he was fooling himself if he thought he could escape unscathed. He was doomed the moment he had let Harry touch him.
“Do you have any family history of depression?” asked Annie, looking back up at her patient.
It was a pastel, baby-blue, Draco’s favorite color, with a large D stitched across the front. He found himself choking up, tears pooling in his eyes.
“I’ll be able to feel all your emotions while I’m in your head, too,” Harry told him, taking one of Draco’s hands and stroking the skin softly. “I’ll notice if you’re feeling distressed, or uncomfortable, so if that feeling arises at any point I’ll pull away from that part of your head and leave it alone.”
“Hey,” he said softly, reaching for Draco’s hands again. “We don’t have to do this tonight, or at all, if you aren’t ready.”
“Whatever,” Draco said. “He’s the only worthy opponent in wizard’s chess. Somebody’s gotta like him.”
“Hey, don’t make fun. Molly made this for me,” he said good-naturedly, ushering Draco inside. Draco set down his umbrella and followed Potter into the sitting room.
He thought of Harry. Those sparkling green eyes. His laughter. His rough, scratchy voice right after they had sex. His incandescent smile that was enough to melt him into a puddle like snow caps on a fresh, dewy spring morning. That would never be directed at Draco again, because all Draco did was drag, drag, drag.
“Are you hungry?” Debbie asked him.
As soon as Harry got home, he firecalled Ron and Hermione.
“Draco?” Harry asked hesitantly, unsure where he was supposed to venture from here because he had never comforted Draco before, about anything, and he wasn’t very good at consoling people in general.
“Why not?”
It was, without a doubt, one of the best things he’d ever tasted.
Trigger warning for themes of eating disorder in this chapter
“Oh, I know,” said Draco. “I chose to do it anyway.”
“He hasn’t been himself in weeks, and-”
Draco nodded, hand falling back down to reveal a shit-eating grin.
He felt wrong invading Draco’s private space, but he wanted to check and make sure everything was okay. Draco had to be out somewhere with Pansy. That was it. He’d do a quick sweep of the flat, and then leave, and try again later. Everything was fine.
Draco scoffed.
adrenaline, and he found himself unable to push Harry away.
Soon enough there was a knock at his door, and Draco was collapsing onto Pansy, allowing her small frame to take his full weight even though he was several inches taller than her.
Now Harry knew where Draco got his snark from.
Hermione was six months along now, pregnant as ever. They had already known the sex of the baby, but tonight when Hermione was talking to Harry and Draco she asked them, “Can you keep a secret?”
Harry frowned at him. “Are you alright?”
Ron popped a chip into his mouth before sipping on his pint.
Sometimes it seemed like Harry didn’t hate him, but Draco didn’t want to take that chance. It was time to clam up.
“His baby is gone.”
It only took Draco a moment to come to his senses, and with great difficulty he pried himself away from the man he loved.
“So you want to change the rules?”
“And it’s not like it works that fast. It’s not
, and he wanted to curl up and cry from the force of it.
“May I come in?” Harry asked delicately, as though Draco were a ticking time bomb.
Draco sighed into the kiss, wrapping his arms tighter around Harry’s waist and pulling him flush to his body. Harry relished in their closeness, and hummed as Draco’s tongue prodded at his lips. They snogged in earnest, until Harry remembered it was time to try writing again to Narcissa.
Harry’s hands found their place on his shoulders, pulling him in closer. Draco didn’t resist. Harry’s touches set him aflame, and right now he was burning alive.
To his dismay, he felt his cheeks begin to heat up. This conversation was making a beeline for dangerous territory, and Draco absolutely couldn’t have that.
Asleep in a chair leaning against his bed.
“So, Harry,” Narcissa said, and Harry swallowed. “You said you have some news about my son.”
“Do you, erm . . .” He cleared his throat. “Would you like to come in? For another drink?”
Potter nodded. “Thank you, but what I’m trying to say is that . . . You aren’t a Death Eater, Malfoy. And I’m not sure you ever were.”
“Maybe they don’t have theirs, either.”
So instead, he decided to bite the bullet and firecall Pansy.
“No.”
was hardly an appropriate response, was it?
“Draco-”
Harry rubbed her shoulder. “We can tell them together, yeah? Maybe that’ll be easier for you.”
“Because . . . Because . . .” He knew Potter wouldn’t understand, and just like that, a fresh wave of tears was ready to crash on the shore of Draco’s shattered composition. “Because that would have made it real. And I’d rather it just exist up here, as a memory.”
“You feel this, too. I know you do. Don’t lie to me, Draco.”
“You don’t have to make any decisions today. Or tomorrow. But it’s just something to think about. It’s been years. People have moved on. Society isn’t the same angry, resentful thing it was when you left it.”
“I want to know why you came here. You said you didn’t want to leave things where they were, but since when have you cared about that?”
“As much as I love holding your hands, I’m gonna need my wand for this.”
Then Draco had an idea. A terribly wonderful, scary, brilliant idea.
“No! No. It’s okay. Really,” Draco assured him, once his breathing was back under control. “I . . . Overreacted.”
“It isn’t,” said Theo breathlessly.
“Draco . . .” Pansy shook her head at him as he took a seat on the sofa as far away from her as possible. “We’re really worried about you.”
“My game? I’m not here for any games. I’m here because you’re . . . in a fragile state of mind right now, and you probably shouldn’t be alone.”
“Mhm.”
“She took it better than I thought,” Harry said in lieu of a greeting when Draco entered through his floo.
“Sometimes I wonder why you bother,” Draco mumbled.
“Yeah.” Harry said it so casually, but there was nothing casual about the way he pulled Draco closer and planted his other hand on Draco’s hip, rubbing small circles on the clothed skin.
“You know the hero, the Golden Boy, the famous saviour of the wizarding world,” Harry corrected him. “You don’t know
As Draco rang him up, he studied his features a bit more. Potter’s bronzed skin looked particularly sunkissed, with an expanse of freckles dotting his nose. His long, curly lashes accentuated the colour of his eyes even more strongly, and his tangly, unruly hair looked extra wild. Draco was overcome by the strangest urge to run his hands through it.
Sighing deeply, Draco spelled the door unlocked and swung it open.
“What?”
“Really?”
, I can assure you I remember.”
“We’re all here for you,” said Greg.
“To be fair, I had insulted Hagrid and the Weasleys,” said Draco.
semblance of power over the other man, and now he was paying for it in full.
“So, Draco, I’d like to talk about your upbringing.”
Draco’s hand shook as he unscrewed the lid to the pills.
Harry reeled back. “Okay,” he said. “I thought you’d be happy to hear this. Clearly, I was wrong.”
“Harry,” hissed Hermione. “Stop talking to them.”
“Listen, Mrs. Malfoy-”
“We don’t speak,” Draco said coldly.
“M’yeah?” He sounded utterly fucked out.
“Harry, I’m- I don’t-”
to let Potter think
slow, he realized with a pang in his chest, he wanted Potter to climb all over him and consume him in every which way, and Potter was breathing heavily, stroking Draco’s cheek, then softly tucking a stray strand of golden hair behind his ear.
“Draco, listen, about the other week,” Harry began, “with Ginny . . . She wasn’t over for what you think she was. I swear it. She and I were just broom shopping together, and she stopped at mine after for a cuppa. That’s it.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you,” said Draco. “I know that’s a lot to unload on you. I want you to know our time last night was genuine, on my end. I felt a strong connection with you, and it was through that bond I was able to engage sexually with you.”
Draco actually
an apothecary?
“I can’t afford the rent for any of the wizarding neighbourhoods,” said Draco, flushing.
“We aren’t together,” Harry said hoarsely, and Draco didn’t need another
Draco
Harry got to work on his fly, pushing down his zipper and yanking him up with brute force to pull down his trousers. He set Draco roughly back down on the table with his pants bunched around at his ankles and pulled him closer, exhaling heavily in the shell of his ear.
Draco was joking. But by the way Potter’s flush darkened, he wasn’t so sure Potter was.
Potter’s face fell. “Malfoy, you don’t have to do that,” he said. “Those are your rules and you don’t have to bend them for me.”
Harry smiled at him- dashing and far too snide. “Not a chance.”
“You’re beginning to worry me,” said Narcissa. “What’s going on?”
Harry grinned. “Wicked. I’ll show you to the bedroom. You can borrow something of mine to sleep in, yeah?”
“If you think I’d compromise my job for a quick and meaningless fuck, you’re sorely mistaken.”
“I had to be,” Draco answered. “I had finally made my father proud. It was something I always . . . Something I’d wanted to do for a long time.”
He wasn’t aware his breathing had picked up until he felt Potter’s hand squeeze his own, sure and steady. There was a soothing voice telling him to breathe, to just take a deep, deep breath, and hold it . . .
“Draco, please, if you’ll just
, Harry moved aside to let him in. “Sorry,” he apologized sheepishly.
“Okay.” Harry awkwardly scratched his head, not knowing what to say next.
“No, because unlike you I don’t rashly jump to conclusions. I let things play out.”
“Well, I couldn’t go around hating Muggles forever, now could I?” Draco said. “They’re actually rather fascinating, the way they come up with technology that seems almost as advanced as magic. Those little boxes with the moving portraits-”
Draco sighed, rolling onto his back, and Harry spelled both Draco and the sheets clean. Or, as clean as they could be. Harry had a feeling Draco would still want to bathe.
“Which was . . .?”
“Harry, please don’t tease,
“So, let me get this straight,” Ron said, pacing around in the living room of his flat. “You knock my sister up, but you aren’t getting back together?”
Harry forced himself to breathe slowly, in and out, in and out. He couldn’t afford to freak out right now. He could freak out later, while Draco was being properly treated.
“Oh,” Draco said, and
Harry sighed and raked a hand through his hair. He was already exhausted with this conversation, and it hadn’t even begun.
Harry reached down to the pile of clothes and sorted his own from Draco’s, handing him his pair of trousers and boxers. Draco took them gratefully and began to dress.
since his switch had been flicked on, and now that it was . . .
Draco could have melted right there in the chair.
Until the war, anyhow. Then they started things back up after the war, and stayed together for two years until Harry came out as bisexual.
Harry was cooking
Potter rotated his barstool to face Draco, and come to think of it . . . They weren’t that far apart.
“And listen to me. Harry may have hurt you deeply, but he saved your life. For that, we have him to thank. You wouldn’t be sitting here talking to me right now if he hadn’t gone into your flat when he did, do you understand?”
Harry chuckled, full of devious mirth. “I’m right, aren’t I?”
Harry continued rubbing right there, pressing down hard, milking him, and it was all he could do not to come.
“Yes, you idiot.
After giving it some careful thought, Harry realized that owling Narcissa wasn’t going to be enough- he’d have to go see her in person.
Draco only sighed in defeat, and finished showering.
“I’ll see Narcissa tomorrow,” said Harry, pressing more kisses into Draco’s hair. “Okay?”
, adult conversation about this.
Draco was suddenly overcome by the overpowering need to communicate with Potter that he was just the smallest bit nervous, that he wanted this to be okay, that he wanted to be good for him. He pulled away from Potter’s mouth, head flopping back against the pillows.
Dread coursed through Harry. Was she wanting to start things back up again?
“Oh god . . .”
“A pretty sensitive one!”
“That’s . . . That’s amazing, Potter.”
“I just need to tell him that I didn’t mean it, that I-”
Harry misconstrued his groan as annoyance at the breaking of the kiss, for he planted a peck on Draco’s forehead and stroked his shoulder tenderly. “Draco, it’s okay, relax . . . There’s just . . . There’s things we need to talk about. Before we go any further.”
Potter’s face softened again, in that way Draco hated. “Malfoy . . .”
“Oh, sweetheart, you already want my cock in you?” Harry crooned, fingers making deliciously obscene noises and pumping into Draco at the exact angle he knew he needed. “We aren’t done yet.”
him?” Ron’s voice had gone shrill. “You aren’t . . .” He gasped, eyes widening to the size of marbles and slapping a hand over his mouth. “You
“Very much so.”
“I can’t take it, Harry,” wailed Draco. “I need to come.”
Draco liked that idea. He liked it a lot. But the pathetic, wimpy loser in him reminded him that ultimately, he didn’t stand a chance.
Harry’s eyes widened. “Really?” But in truth, the information went straight to his cock, which rapidly began growing again. The idea of being the largest Draco ever had filled him with such primal arousal that it was everything he could do not to pounce on the man and immediately fuck him. Steps had to be taken first.
“Harry, fuck,
That cancerous concern was back in full swing, now. Harry gritted his teeth as he pulled out his wand and spelled the door open with a whispered
Draco thought back to all the times Harry had said “I love you” to him as he fucked him so brutally his body felt like it was part of the mattress. Did he?
He made no attempt to pry Draco’s mouth open with his tongue, or otherwise deepen the kiss. He stayed still as a statue, with his soft lips on Draco’s own, for a solid seven seconds. Not that Draco was counting.
“What did they do to you?” Draco asked softly.
Harry sighed. “Here I was thinking I was the only sane person in the room.”
Draco’s smile faded. Surely Potter wanted to do more than just get his hands all over him?
“Oh,” he said, looking down. “Oh.”
“There’s clearly something going on here, something that has to do with us, and I want to get to the bottom of it.”
Annie’s smile faded like a dream. “You don’t like it?”
Draco tried to hide his relief as best as he could. He didn’t want to broadcast all his nervousness to Potter, then Potter might not want to do this with him.
“I only said it to get you into bed. Isn’t it obvious? I don’t love you. I don’t think anyone ever could.” His green eyes bore into grey.
“You’re just a cold, unfeeling
“It’s the proper thing to do,” Harry said. “Everyone in your family will be relieved we’re getting back together, frankly. Molly was distraught when we broke up, remember?”
, Draco.”
“Draco . . .” For the second time tonight, Harry’s heart snapped in half. “I’m not going to argue and say you aren’t a Death Eater, because you clearly still believe you are one. That’s something you can work on in therapy. But about deserving? You have been through so much, sacrificed so much, did you know you saved us? At the manor? If it hadn’t been for you, we would have gotten caught, and the war might not have been won.”
“I know, baby, I’ve got you.”
“We can do it,” Draco said, when they got home that afternoon. Harry had been carrying a lazy, content sort of smile on his face all day after that kiss, and Draco had a distinct feeling it had riled him up just as much.
“Has anyone ever used Legilimency on you in a non-threatening way?”
“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” he asked, hand tensing under Potter’s.
“And they just . . . messaged me, out of nowhere. And refused to tell me who they were."
“Because he’s Potter. He wants children and a white picket fence and some semblance of peace for a change. He doesn’t need your instability or turbulence or to babysit you while you rot away because you’re too afraid to try to fight back for your place in our world.”
“Narcissa, I love him,” said Harry. “I need him to know that.”
damaged, more so than he was letting on. If Harry wanted to, he could pick apart Draco’s entire mind with just the lazy flick of a finger- but he wouldn’t ever dream of it.
“One conversation in a pub doesn’t mean you know me, Potter.” Draco knew he was being frosty, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care, not when Potter was treading so close to treacherous terrain that he didn’t know how to navigate.
Draco nearly spit out his beer. “You- You
Wait a minute.
Hermione telling him it wasn’t his fault was like saying that pushing somebody off a cliff wasn’t his fault; the person may have gotten themselves to the edge, but it was Harry who pushed them over.
“Our family isn’t going to let that happen,” Ron continued. “They would never let Ginny take your baby away from you, no matter what.”
“Well, it’s decided, then,” Potter grinned, leaning against the desk, looking so
“Who is he to you? Is he a spouse? Friend? Ex lover?”
Harry smiled bashfully. Compliments weren’t his strong suit, either.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco chided. “I’m sure your Muggle relatives spoiled you with loads of them. Not all of us grew up as lucky as you.”
“Why not?” He sounded like a child.
“Draco, he-”
to do?
“I hope you’ve come to your senses and realized you need human interaction in your life just like everybody else,” she said. “And I’m sorry for calling you selfish.”
Draco wanted to laugh, because that trial was hardly fair. The wizengamot had wanted to make an example out of him, and it was only due to Potter’s testimony that he wasn’t rotting away in Azkaban with his father.
“No,” Potter answered simply. “I’ve been single for a while, actually. I was in a rather serious relationship that went south when I found out he was cheating on me for the better part of a year.”
“You have before. Last time I was here, you had no problem kicking me out.”
“But I don’t know how to tell him without messing up what we have. What we have is easy, it works, and up until now I thought it wasn’t hurting either one of us.”
“You’re a Healer?” Draco found himself asking, and it made sense. He could see it perfectly; it fit Potter so much better, so much more snugly, than being an Auror.
“I don’t want to hear you say that about yourself,” said Greg.
do, while Potter was kissing him so ferociously and breaking him open bit by bit.
By the end of his monologue, his voice was sugary sweet like he was speaking to a baby.
Potter looked vulnerable then, and his grip on Draco’s hand tightened. “Really?”
All up until one dreary afternoon with the rain pattering away on the windows, Draco was feeling queasy. He’d skipped breakfast, hadn’t packed himself a lunch, and it was nearly five o’clock. One instant he was standing up on his tippy-toes trying to shelf a book, which was making him feel
Did he trust Harry?
in front of Harry, he was such a
“Why?” Pansy asked, in that same despairing tone that Harry had used.
“I’m not telling you to
“When you’re discharged, we will find you a Mind Healer so you can begin therapy.”
“What am I
“You’re right, I can’t,” Draco said quietly. Guilt squeezed at him tightly again, for having assumed Harry was treated well by his extended family. He felt like a complete and utter prick. “I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to assume anything. I’m so sorry.”
about his life. How isolated he’d gotten. He’d even pushed Greg away without really meaning to, feeling guilty for having ordered him around all those years. Pansy was the only one left. And would she want anything to do with him after this?
“You tried to
“Gonna come,” Harry warned, panting. “Gonna come in that pretty little arse of yours, then I’m gonna slurp out every last drop ‘til you can’t even stand.”
“You want me, too,” Harry said roughly, stalking closer to him. Draco allowed him to place both hands on his hips, drawing him in. Rubbing up and down, up and down. The gesture was both soothing and exhilarating.
His laughter escaped him in little bubbles, however, which he supposed wasn’t helping matters any.
listen, he needed answers and he needed them
Draco was ready to fall over. “You
“You heard me, Harry. Get. Out.”
“You don’t understand,” said Harry, holding his head in his hands. “I’m in love with him.”
“Draco,” Harry said, voice barely above a whisper, and he sounded so utterly ruined that Draco found himself moving aside from the frame in spite of himself.
“Well, we got to talking,” said Harry. “And . . . We eventually went out for a pint. And I realized he isn’t so bad.”
“No matter; I remember where from last time,” Potter responded with a dashing smile that had Draco nearly floored.
, why do you always assume that?”
Harry laughed boisterously. “Don’t get me fooled, Draco. Don’t you still find me dashingly handsome? At least a little bit?”
“Mhm.” Potter sounded pleased as a small smile bloomed on his face.
Horror churned through him, tearing his insides apart.
“Four years,” Potter answered, though he still wouldn’t look at Draco. “I quit the Aurors, spent some time figuring out what I wanted to do, and it occurred to me one day. You always said I have a saving-people thing, right? I figured I might as well put it to some good use.”
“Also love it when you rim my arse. I love coming alone from just your tongue, how utterly debauched it makes me feel. It’s downright humiliating, how much of a slut I am for your tongue, and I- Ahh! love it.”
“It doesn’t matter if I did or not,” Harry said. “You and I are not together anymore, and we aren’t in love, and we found out we weren’t right for each other, so what does it matter?”
“Mhm. Your portraits are . . . Interesting.”
“Of course,” Draco said lightly, forcing himself not to take Pansy’s prying words too seriously. “I’ll let him know soon.”
Harry didn’t know how else to convince her that he was serious, so he decided to give it his best shot.
“Narcissa, I . . . I wasn’t entirely honest with you before. About Draco.”
Harry’s grip on him loosened. “What do you mean, why do I care? Really, Draco?”
Potter lifted up off his chest and sat up straight. He braced himself over Draco with both arms, leaning in to kiss him. “All you had to do was ask.”
“Two to three meals a day, well-balanced nutrition, and plenty of water.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed. “So good, so, so good.”
“Fucking
But he couldn’t just unload all that on Potter, now, could he? He couldn’t exactly drop a
Christmas came and went. At the manor, Christmas Eve was a quiet, polite occasion, with lots of presents for Draco and few for Harry, but Harry didn’t care. He had the greatest gift of all.
“Of course I am,” Draco said lightly. “I just don’t . . . See people much these days, is all, so I don’t get a lot of practice.” That would be quite an understatement. But he was keen on keeping that part of himself safely blanketed away.
“This is about
“You’ve got to tell us about this mystery bloke you’ve been shagging.”
“Hi,” said Draco with a shy smile.
“This is going to sound stupid,” Potter said, cheeks twinging with blush, “but . . . It reminds me. Of him. And I’m just not . . . I’m not ready to let him go.”
“I see a change in you,” Potter said to him, allowing Draco to touch him and caress his calloused hands. “An admirable change. You’ve grown.”
“Hardly,” scoffed Ginny. “I was supposed to have children last, not first.”
Once Parkinson had settled, Harry took a seat beside her and watched as she ran a distressed hand through her bob.
“Hi,” he breathed, taking in Draco’s sparking grey eyes and his dripping wet hair. How did he always manage to look so sexy?
He leaned down to kiss Draco again, and Draco gasped into his mouth.
Draco’s face softened.
His mother was a touchy subject at best, and on a day like today just thinking about her was enough to make him want to curl up into a ball and never unravel.
“Right. Well, I think that would make things . . . Fair, so to speak.”
All at once, Harry realized when Draco was ready for him to move.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked softly.
“I know.”
“No,” Draco said weakly. “You can’t-”
“Tea would be lovely,” Draco said.
“Alright,” Harry conceded. “We won’t get married. But I’m going to be involved, Ginny.”
Draco exploded, causing Harry to flinch. “I might get a little light-headed sometimes, or dizzy, but that doesn’t mean I can’t function as a person.”
Draco wanted to slap him.
“Okay.”
Harry snaked an arm around Draco’s tummy, pulling him flush so that they were back-to-chest. With another brutal thrust that slammed right in his prostate, Draco howled and threw his head back against Harry’s shoulder. The action seemed to encourage Harry, for he quickened his thrusts and began fucking Draco in earnest.
“No, it’s just . . .” Draco sighed, fixing his blonde locks. “You need to figure out what you want with me.”
“Perfect,” Harry murmured in awe, snapping his hips, eliciting a gasp from Draco.
“You’re the first person I’ve told,” said Harry. “I dunno why, but as soon as I quit I wanted to come here. And tell you.”
“I pushed you away,” Draco said wetly, fighting the tears in his eyes. “I know it’s wrong, and it isn’t fair, it’s just . . . Every time I look at you, I see
“There’s no timeline for these things,” Harry told her. “Everyone’s on their own path. Life happens.”
“Why do you say that?”
Draco felt his face drain of color.
He climbed off Harry’s lap, and held up the loofah. “Now it’s your turn.”
“Draco, you have a visitor,” said the tech on duty, standing in his doorframe.
Draco breathed out, still in a state of shock.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a glance.
“Then what did you mean, Malfoy?”
Draco sighed, stepping closer to the green-eyed man, who had bulked and grown his hair out over the years. It reached just past his shoulders, and today Harry wore it in a curly ponytail.
He’d expected as much.
He thought of Pansy. How they used to run and laugh around the gardens when they were children, without a care in the world. How little they knew how much their golden lives would burn to a blackened crisp.
When he came to, he heard a voice.
“You must already know I’m incredibly disappointed in you,” Pansy said as they began walking to the point of apparition.
He grabbed a loofah from the side of the tub and coated it with Draco’s signature vanilla soap. Wordlessly coaxing Draco to sit up by gently nudging him, Harry took the loofah and began rubbing it softly all across Draco’s naked body.
Draco immediately took his hand off his cock, mind melting to mush as Harry’s order washed over him and made him feel all fuzzy.
“Well, we had one, Narcissa. And it was working, or appearing to be working, for a while. Then I messed up. Badly.”
“Harry,” he said, winded as though he’d just run a marathon, “please don’t tell Pansy. Please.”
Harry beamed at him, and his smile was so bright that Draco nearly squinted.
her.”
Potter looked at him with an expression he couldn’t discern.
“If you were just a one night stand to me, I wouldn’t have followed you here.”
“Whatever. Let’s pretend nothing’s wrong. Do you honestly, truly want to have sex with me tonight? When I firecalled you, you sounded as though you’d been crying.”
Draco chuckled. He expected nothing less from him.
“Please?”
Death Eater. And you can’t. That’s final.”
Harry pulled out of him, and ended the Legilimency spell. Immediately his vision refocused on Draco, who looked up at him with half-lidded eyes, looking sated and blissed out.
“Please give me another chance.” The words were so quiet, Draco nearly missed them. Like seeing the last fleeting second of a shooting star.
true.”
his state of mind off of how Harry felt about him?
“Then what are you doing here?” Harry asked. “You have the power to change things if your life isn’t going the way you want it, Draco.”
“They slept together about a week and a half ago,” said Pansy. “He’ll know in about three weeks’ time whether she’s pregnant.”
Harry winced. That definitely sounded like Draco.
Draco nodded, chest still heaving. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and kissed each of his knuckles. “Okay. I’ll run the bath.”
And, honestly, when did he get so
“Couldn’t save the poor little Death Eater-”
“It’s a lot, isn’t it?” Potter said with a small smile to match.
“Nothing important.”
“And sometimes . . . I need a little extra something.”
“Draco, please, I need to just talk to you-”
“I, erm . . .” Draco cleared his throat. “This is really random and not at all related to our conversation.”
Pansy had the nerve to look sheepish.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Really?”
“I’m sorry for bringing it up,” said Harry. “It’s just that for a while, I was in a sort of serious relationship with this bloke, and we would use it on each other sometimes. It made the sex far more intimate and passionate.”
He looked destroyed.
Pansy shrugged. “It wasn’t my information to tell.”
The conversation thinned out, and eventually it was time for everyone to head to class. Draco told the others he’d stay behind a minute, and it only took a bit of convincing for them to believe that he was alright to be by himself.
“Malfoy?”
Potter chuckled. “I can show you a few other things I can do.”
“It’s true.”
Draco shook his head.
The next thing he registered was a soft beeping noise, slow and steady. It seemed to go in time with the rhythm of his breathing, which was another thing that struck him as odd. Could you breathe in the afterlife?
“Make me.”
“But I-”
It didn’t matter what Harry told him in bed- finding out about Ginny, hearing it from
Draco wondered if it was a habit he’d developed from the war.
, not that you’re ugly, no, I didn’t mean-” Potter cut himself off with a heavy sigh, running a shaking hand through his hair. “C-Can I?”
Draco pressed kisses all around the crown of Harry’s cock, before his pink lips parted to let the member in. Draco swallowed Harry’s cock in one go, and Harry was arching off the bed, curling his toes.
He pushed his chair into the table with an angry slam, which caused the table to teeter. He then began pacing back and forth, uncaring of the stares he received from other patients and visitors.
“I mean, I do, but the Weasleys . . . I killed one of their own.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed. “Harry, Harry,
“No!” exclaimed Draco, sounding alarmed. “D-Don’t. I want it. Please don’t spell it away.”
“Okay, well, I’m going to fetch Annie. Do you need anything else from me?”
“Draco, I don’t know what I’d do without you,” Harry said, hugging him impossibly closer as Draco’s face did something ugly. “It tears me apart to my core.”
“Draco,” he murmured into his collarbone, sucking at the skin and lapping over it with tiny kisses. “Let me take care of you. I know you want it, too.”
Harry froze. With great difficulty, he pulled away from Draco and looked deep into his eyes.
Harry’s eyes lit up, and he dropped his coat off on the rack.
“I’m not joking, Ron. I’m serious.”
“I think that it’s best if I go,” Harry said quietly, like all the spark within him had died.
“You don’t mean that,”  said Harry, and his voice broke. “You’re angry. And upset. You’re only saying that.”
“You have the manners of a Hippogriff,” Draco pointed out.
“Draco Malfoy, you stop that train of thought right now,” Pansy ordered sternly. “You can’t automatically assume he’ll just . . . tire of you, like you’re some new ice cream flavour or fashion trend.”
Feeling entirely left out of the loop even though Draco was
“Do you have a good enough reason why you missed the first sonogram for our child?” Ginny asked him through the floo.
“How am I supposed to trust you again? After everything?”
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco asked, voice all high and squeaky. He knew his face was rising in color, too, and he clasped his hands together to prevent them from shaking.
admit that aloud.
“He came over? Why?” Pansy asked through the floo.
Harry flicked through memories of Draco and him together in school, except they were all . . . tainted. With something that definitely wasn’t hatred.
“How’d it go, mate?” Ron asked him, sounding excited. “Did he take it well? Are you two together now?”
He wasn’t in the kitchen, so Harry made a right out of the living room and headed towards the bathroom.
“I said out.”
Harry’s face did something funny, something Draco didn’t like, but only for a moment- he blinked, and it was gone. Trying to recall it felt like piecing together a dream after waking up.
Draco had never thought about it that way before. He knew Mother and Father weren’t perfect, but they loved each other very much and cared about each other, even if their marriage was somewhat arranged.
Draco popped a pill in his mouth, swallowing it down with the glass of water he’d brought into the bathroom. The pill was heavy in his mouth.
. And I’m not keen on repeating myself. You
“What did you say?”
“I know we were talking about something more serious earlier, but . . . I actually really do want to know your favorite color.”
“With all the customers in here?”
“You’re nothing if not funny, Potter.”
“I’m never letting you go again,” he said. “I’ll get better. I’ll get better for you.”
“Yes.”
Suddenly, unpleasant memories flooded Harry’s head, memories of when Draco was slightly older, and Lucius was yelling at him and hitting him for admitting to his mother he had a crush on a boy. All the repressed self-loathing and internalized homophobia bubbled to the surface, and Harry rubbed Draco’s leg with his free hand.
Miss Granger even says that the accident caused Mr. Potter to turn homosexual and in her words “He was perfectly normal beforehand, he had a crush on this girl in school and everything. No indication that he liked boys at all and then all of a sudden he says that he has just realized he was gay but there’s no way he can be like that…” Mr. Weasley on the other hand just said “He’s now stuck with Slytherins, he can’t be who he was if he’s now the Slytherin ‘Sub’*.” (*We had to translate the wording that Mr. Weasley used as it was not appropriate for the public.)
And just as he realized that he felt his face heat up and knew he was beet red. Well this was new. At least part of his bond will now be easier to deal with if he really had feelings for Malfoy. He had to admit that he wasn’t being too much of a prat at this moment and he did seem nice when he spoke of his so-called adventures.
“How much pain are you in Mr. Potter?”
Slowly Harry started to become aware. Everything felt heavy, even his hair had a heavy feeling. He could hear mumbles around him but had trouble focusing on what was said. There was an ache inside him that was pulsing, but otherwise he didn’t feel any pain. He tried to remember what had happened. ‘
They were so involved with spelling the trunk they never noticed Snape coming into their room. Harry whirled around and pointed his wand while Malfoy just laughed at him, Snape just stared at Harry waiting him out.
a useful spell that changes items into clothes the caster pictures. This spell has been in use for centuries and since the caster has to visualize the clothes themselves it never needs to be updated or modernized. The spell itself is ‘
Madame Pomfrey asked him, keeping an eye on his face as she was used to Harry lying about the pain in order to reassure everyone else. When she asks for pain from 1 to 10, a broken arm would lead to a 5 when others would say at least 8. She knew there was more to him than it seemed but Dumbledore denied her access to his full history or to exam him after holidays. She always worried that one day he would give up on any help that she could give because he would know that she hasn’t done everything she could for him.
The next thing they knew the potion exploded all over Harry’s left side and partially on Malfoy and even Snape got some on his hands. The only thing he could feel was intense burning on and under his skin and he could hear someone yelling his name but it seemed to come from so far away. Black spots started to cloud his eyes and he was starting to feel sluggish and heavy. He could feel Malfoy slowly bringing him down with him.
“Good idea Draco, Lucius will have a better idea of what Umbridge is doing and what she is officially allowed to do in the High Inquisitor position that she placed herself in. Lucius would also be able to help us in any other legality problems that might come up.
Snape had noticed that the bond was changing his view of Harry and he wasn’t sure if he liked that at this time. Not only is he supposed to be a spy for both Voldemort and Dumbledore, but also he really didn’t want to be seen being friendly to a Potter, there was too much history between him and Potter’s to be comfortable with it.
Madame Pomfrey had her hand over her mouth in shock. It explained everything. Harry slowly nodded showing he heard what Professor Snape said.
“He can stay, I don’t mind.” Harry said with a sniffle as he tried to calm his emotions. He felt embarrassed about everything he said and did and just wanted to be left alone if possible but knew that that was never going to happen.
Snape stood right up and yanked the letter out of Draco’s hand to read the address. He paled right away and basically fell back on his bum on the bed in semi-shock. Then he started to get red and angry and stood right up and stared Harry in the face.
~parseltongue~
Draco just stared at Harry wide eyed. He never knew that Harry wasn’t raised knowing about their world; he assumed, like everyone else, that Harry was taught about magic just as most purebloods and halfbloods are. In fact, he wondered if anyone thought to show him the books that muggleborns get regarding their world and laws that are important. He was just about to ask when Snape showed back up and told them to sit down so they could discuss their future.
Draco walked back and forth just thinking about the stories that Harry had told them, and of everything he knew from his own knowledge of the past four years or so. He thought back to what he noticed from Harry’s own actions and from the happenings at the school. He knew that Harry hated the attention he gets, he makes that pretty obvious, so that wasn’t why he was telling these stories… If anything he could see Weasley or Granger making up the stories to get more attention because they seem to like to shine they get when they’re with Harry… But why would Harry go along with the stories if they aren’t true? There was just so much he had to discuss with Harry before he could try to get Snape to compose himself when it comes to all things Potter.
He paused to think of how to say it so the Gryffindor would understand.
“They were here when we found out about the bond. We explained to them what it means knowing you’d need their support. But, Mr. Potter, Harry, they didn’t take it quite like we expected. They blamed you for being ‘stuck with Slytherins’ and called you a ‘traitor to Gryffindors’ and left. I’m sorry Harry, maybe give them time to get their heads around the facts and hopefully they’ll be back with you soon.”
Snape turned to Malfoy who had stopped laughing and just nodded his head to confirm what Harry said.
Snape started class right away.
Draco on the other hand finally came to the realization that Harry is not one to lie, he may hide the truth or change the subject, but he wasn’t a liar. Which means everything he has told him so far were fact, his so called adventures and that letter!
Harry mumbled the end of his thoughts not really thinking that his bondmates would care much in what he was saying. Snape and Draco on the other hand were very angry. They couldn’t believe this was happening in Hogwarts.
Malfoy walked towards Harry’s bed when he stepped on something. He picked it up, saw it was an envelope and put it in his pocket for later. He sat on the bed at Harry’s feet then Harry sat up and just sat beside him. Malfoy decided to hold his hand.
“Were you not listening in class Mr. Potter? Miss Granger explained how the binding is permanent when it comes to this potion. She even mentioned how having been dosed can cause unexpected results.”
“It’s alright, sir, Dra…um… Malfoy just noticed my reaction to the view. It’s fine I’ll get used to it.”
Snape was completely serious about this too, Harry could tell. Now he was getting really worried that this would be worse news than he originally thought.
“Thanks Malfoy, I appreciate everything.”
*Flashbacks*
“Why are you guys here? I thought I was a ‘no good liar who couldn’t tell the truth even if it saved my best friend’s life’ oh wait, then you said I had no friends and it’s no wonder I didn’t bother with the truth…”
And before Harry had time to reply he noticed Ron levitating a leech that was semi juiced and dropping it in Malfoy’s potion. Harry reacted without thinking and ran towards Malfoy, he jumped in front of him, startling Malfoy to try and push him out of his way, Harry just pushed right back.
So he got off the bed, wiped his face and prepared himself for more pain since the blood quill is still Umbridge’s detention torture item of choice. He realized that now that he has to stay here he won’t be getting the usual treatment with the solution of Murtlap Essence that Hermione has been getting him. So the pain will be just worse than usual now. He’s used to it he supposed, pain is nothing new; physical or emotional or whatever else he gets. He took a deep breath, ignored his feelings and walked out the room running into Draco.
“Harry?”
“Maybe if you asked the adult in the room he may know how to deal with such issues. But I suppose, Potter, you’re quite used to doing things on your own without adults helping you… Now stop moving so I can finish this chore unless you prefer to do it on your own as well?”
Harry mumbled this while re-slicing his work. Theo on the other hand was very surprised and unsure what to say to that. So instead he just helped Harry learn the basics of the ways of cutting and mixing. Something that Snape should have done in the first lesson in the boys’ minds.
“That’s not it, you and Malfoy are both keyed into my trunk sir. I figured I shouldn’t have any secrets from you if we’re stuck together. So far Malfoy knows most of my secrets; I just haven’t had a chance to share anything with you, yet, sir.”
“Ma..Madame Pomfrey. Have Ron and Hermione tried to come see me yet?”
Back to the main story, the letter I got was from two very close personal friends’ of Mr. Potter’s who were very shocked and unimpressed with the results of this so called accident. In their minds Mr. Potter shouldn’t have been anywhere near Mr. Malfoy when the potion exploded and they believe that Mr. Potter may have jumped in for no reason, causing him to receive permanent scars and an unfortunate outcome involving Mr. Malfoy and Professor Snape.
~parseltongue~
I thank you all for reading/following my story :)
Before Harry could even start to think of a reply Draco was sitting down beside Lavender and Snape was glaring at him. So he rushed to the only spot left and noticed Theo nodding at him and gently moving the stool out for him to sit on. Harry smiled at Theo and sat right down getting ready to start class.
Snape was starting to feel confused about the boy, he was sweating as if he was in pain and he obviously fainted from it, but it didn’t make any sense as to why this was happening.
Rita Skeeter
Malfoy barged in the room before Snape could even pick up some flood powder from the floor.
“You’ll obviously have to work hard to catch up to the rest of the class. Draco can help you when he has time, but you’ll just have to study hard on your own and hopefully you can understand most of it on your own.”
The Slytherins, used to the unfairness of teachers when it came to them, just shook their heads and spelled Draco and Harry back to their regular outfits then put everything away. Harry on the other hand just stared at McGonagall wondering why she was being so unfair. The Ravenclaws were the ones that were causing trouble. Why would she take it out on him? He sat back down and didn’t even notice everyone getting ready to leave. He just stared at his teacher wondering what was going on. Once everyone was out of the class, Professor McGonagall was going through her notes for her next class and didn’t notice Harry approaching.
“Potter? What kind of trick is this? Why would you have this in your trunk? It has to be some kind of prank or something right? Just like your father, aren’t you? Think everything is funny and a joke to play on everyone so long as you get the attention on yourself as you please.”
“Hey Malfoy, can you show me how to do some spells on my trunk? I just don’t want to chance this happening with more important things I own.”
“We’re good Professor, thank you, and thank you Draco.”
“For once it looks like a passable potion Mr. Potter; maybe it was not you who ruined every other potion you made but your partner. Mr. Weasley, fifteen points from Gryffindor for your lack of concentration and fifteen for your lack of participation.” Snape sneered before leaving to go talk to Malfoy about his perfectly perfect potion.
Harry looked down and just shook his head. He knew it wouldn’t go well with Umbridge, he knew she would make a big deal out of it and just make his life even harder than it already is.
Snape on the other hand just smirked at the way that Potter seemed to be holding himself back from speaking out. He was starting to be happy with the way Potter was acting towards him; he definitely didn’t miss the rude boy who talked back. Snape quickly summoned the salve and started to rub it into the burn scars roughly without care.
Harry snorted when it was mentioned that Snape would play favorites. Like that would be something new considering his way during Gryffindor and Slytherin classes. He’d love to see Snape play favorites with him in a positive way, but doubt that even with him being his Alpha it would ever happen.
“I’m only telling you what Dumbledore has told us and there’s no reason for Dumbledore to lie to his staff. Just take this into consideration when you deal with Potter, us staff know him as a liar and an exaggerator.”
This is a new re-written chapter as I didn't like the original one I posted. Hopefully it still works for you all!
“Severus! You scared me! I was just going to floo…”
Once everything was settled and the potion making was on the way Ron started whispering to Harry once more about his incredible revenge idea.
“Tell me all about your adventures, I’ve heard too many rumors for them not to have some truth and I’d like to know the actual facts about what you golden trio have been up to these last years.”
“Oh, Draco, perfect! I need your help. Umbridge has me in detention every day until she says I learned my lesson. I got a break when I was hospitalized but if I don’t show up now she might just make things worse.”
~parseltongue~
“Oi, Scarface! Since I’m stuck here with you and I’ve done all my homework I need you to entertain me. Do something.”
He shook his thoughts away again and grabbed a potions book and followed Harry to Umbridge’s office.
“This salve will only need to be put on a couple more times; unfortunately it hasn’t been affecting the scars as much as I had hoped, but after the last treatment you’ll be fully healed and no longer have a chance of infection. You’ll just have to get used to having more than the scar that made you famous. Now it’s close to curfew, we have to get up early to discuss our scheduling and our future so I suggest you boys go to sleep. Your next treatment will be at 6, I expect you to be ready by then.”
“What do you mean you snuck into our common room using polyjuice? How big was this so called basilisk? You, a twelve year old boy, killed it with a sword, never having used a sword before in his life? Are you sure you weren’t just drugged to believe all this happened?”
This time though, this time he would give them one chance when he spoke to them and if they couldn’t accept that he had no control over what happened then that was it, he was done with them. Hopefully they have calmed down enough to speak to him soon; he needed company other than Malfoy, as that has been pure torture so far.
Harry looked at Snape with tears in his eyes, trying hard not to let them drop. The words omega and bond kept repeating in his mind over and over. He had to cough to get his dry throat working.
Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger seem to be of mind that Mr. Potter caused this bond to formulate since he couldn’t help himself but try to be the hero. Now the left side of his face is apparently completely covered in burn scars, including his left arm and so he stands out even more with more scars. Even Mr. Malfoy has some scarring on his face and Professor Snape on his hands. But according to the duo who wrote the letter, if Mr. Potter didn’t jump into the explosion this bond would not have happened and everything would be extremely different.
*Flashbacks*
Draco could see the fear in Harry’s eyes and could feel that both Harry and Snape were ready to snap in different ways so he decided to try and calm them both down.
Draco knew that Harry was raised in the muggle world, even if he didn’t want to speak about it at all, so he figured he might have questions that Weasley wouldn’t have been able to answer, or maybe he had questions about the bond that Snape didn’t take the time to answer.
"Speech"
Malfoy tried to get back to his old self; he didn’t want to feel pity for Potter, he didn’t think Potter wanted him to feel pity either. He walked to his bed and laid back picking up a book from his night table and pretended to read while really watching Potter. Harry on the other hand saw that his trunk and all his stuff was brought from the tower, he made sure everything was there and that his most important items: the marauders map, the invisibility cloak, his photo album and his broom were where they were supposed to be. Those items were in the right place, but he did notice something else missing and his heart missed a beat. His Weasley sweaters. Where were his Weasley sweaters that Mrs. Weasley made him for the last 3 Christmases? He turned to Malfoy.
Harry shrugged not wanting to talk about it, he tried to keep that numb feeling he had earlier, it was better than the pain he knew he would be feeling. Instead he decided to stop trusting people and figured Malfoy would be perfect to teach him how, the first step would be to secure his trunk.
Snape looked at Harry and sighed knowing he would have to tell the bane of his existence all about their new lives, he just knew there would be a major tantrum from the Gryffindor, unlike Draco who took it hard but just talked it through with all his questions. This would not be as easy as he never liked Potter, but he knew it must be done.
~parseltongue~
“Malfoy, you didn’t by any chance see some knitted sweaters around did you? Or did anyone have access to my trunk before it was brought here?”
And with that Snape left once again, leaving Harry passed out on the bed and Pomfrey feeling a little lost on how to help the poor boy.
“Harry, come on! It would be so easy! Just tell me when Snape is busy elsewhere and I’ll do the rest, c’mon just say you’ll help!”
They both walked super-fast to get to class on time and it looked like they just made it. Unfortunately for Harry the only places left was one with a Slytherin and another with Lavender Brown. Harry sighed, looked over at Draco and just rolled his eyes and sighed.
When it came to his third year, a confusing time of time travel and godfathers and werewolves, Harry tried to keep his story as accurate as possible. Luckily, Malfoy knew most of this thanks to Snape and didn’t require Harry to confirm any of it.
“We’ll see. Now I need to speak with you Draco, Potter you can go into your room and start catching up on all the classes you missed.”
*Flashbacks*
Malfoy shrugged.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco and gave a small smile. He was surprised that Draco was being so gentle but he was also very glad that at least him and Malfoy have made peace in some way. Hopefully it was not just temporary due to the fact that Malfoy pitied him or something.
Thank you,
*Flashbacks*
Draco’s eyes got big and he looked down and tried to think of the feelings he got from Harry. Right now they were still showing extreme sadness and fear and he couldn’t imagine that being completely made up.
Hermione was nodding along with Harry but ever since she started noticing her crush on Ron this year she didn’t want to end up on his wrong side by saying anything against him.
And with that Snape left the boys and went to his own room to get ready for bed, he was expecting trouble waking the boys up in the morning but figured he’d deal with that in the morning.
“Well… I suppose this has been enough time. No point in making Mr. Malfoy wait for you all night. Now, instead of every night we will do this weekly so every Monday from now on you are to be at my door by 7pm. Hopefully soon you’ll learn your lesson.”
“Correct, 5 points to Gryffindor.” Snape looked angry he had to give points but realized it was a good answer. “Now what is the main ingredient that causes the binding? Mr. Malfoy?”
Next to him Malfoy was staring with his mouth open.
Once the hour of class was over Harry felt very comfortable with Theo and appreciated his help so much.
“As far as I know it doesn’t, but we aren’t sure of all the side effects now are we?”
The rest at the table were also in the same mind. Having been forewarned by Professor Snape they prepared to welcome Harry to their house, but having this happen they were prepared to help support and defend the three and their poor situation.
Harry just turned away from Malfoy as he didn’t want to show him just how bad he was getting to him.
“Go, I’ll sit with her and deal with it. Theo is nice and will be good with you, if anything he’ll help you raise your grade up.”
“Rest Potter, I’ll wake you when it’s time for your next treatment.”
Draco was a little nervous himself. He didn’t know how the other Slytherins were going to take all of this but he knew that he had to stand by Harry no matter what. Then he was a little nervous on how his father would take all of the news, he double checked he had it to pass to Snape to send to his father as discussed the night before.
Obviously at that time not much was known yet about the relationship, but the basics were announced and now we know more to confirm for your information.
The doors opened and Ron and Hermione marched together to Harry’s bed.
~parseltongue~
“Potter… What is this? What has been going on in that detention?”
“Right… Thanks...”
Theo and Blaise still looked worried though. Who knew how this affected them, the Slytherins didn’t even know how the three were dealing with this whole situation in the first place and now with having this happen they had even more going on.
“How… How long have we been here?”
Everyone just stared at him. Harry was standing up in the same skirt and shirt as earlier but he was red faced and staring at poor Draco who was still trying to keep calm.
Harry wasn’t sure if he wanted the answer. He closed his eyes and tried to breathe through the pain knowing Madame Pomfrey will bring him something for it shortly.
"Speech"
“Precisely why would I try to get rid of a window that has been there since these rooms were created? You never seemed to have trouble with it before Mr. Malfoy.”
“I don’t care if you want access to my stuff, I just worry that if I ever have to go back to the tower more things of mine will end up disappearing and being burned to ashes. He already took my only sweaters and my only memory of being part of the Weasley family for a short while, but I don’t want him taking things that belonged to my father or my only pictures of my parents or anything else Ron might decide I no longer deserve.”
“Professor McGonagall, Harry is being attacked by someone!”
“You have been asleep for 3 days, the salve for the burns has been working wonders but you may still scar due to the fact it was a very volatile potion that caused them. There will be other side effects from the potion Mr. Potter, some we are aware of but others might surprise us.” She turned to Snape and asked “Do you want to explain to him or do you want me to? You explained it nicely to Mr. Malfoy yesterday and this does involve the three of you.”
Harry nodded, he figured it would be something like that. Then he thought of something he was really worried that he’d have to stop.
Ron already seemed ready for an argument and didn’t seem to want to listen. Hermione on the other hand took a step forward and gave Ron a look.
“Looks like Snape followed them. They should be alright.”
“Sir, are you almost done, I think Harry needs a break.” Draco was very worried when he saw the tears in Harry’s eyes. He squeezed his hand and just tried to convey that he was there for him without saying it out loud.
For those who are not aware, the A/B/O relationships are usually a sexually involved type of relationship. Most often the Alpha is the one in charge, the Omega is the child bearer and the Beta is basically in the middle. Now there are more to this relationship than what I just mentioned but I’m sure those in such a bond would rather keep that to themselves.
“Wake up Potter. You’ve kept Draco up most of the night so I think it is only right you stay up all day so that you actually sleep tonight and hopefully keep your dreams to yourself. Now, stand up so I can put this salve on you and hopefully be finished before Draco is ready and with us.”
And with that Harry passed out.
Snape sat down beside Draco and made himself a taco as well before glaring at Harry and then trying it out.
“My fault?! If you didn’t jump in front of Malfoy everything would be fine! You wouldn’t look like a freak and they wouldn’t be stuck with you as a bondmate. Just leave us alone Potter, we don’t want anything to do with Slytherin’s whore!”
“This is nothing new with what happens to us Slytherins’. You get used to it. It’s also why Sev is so generous with us and takes points easily from the other houses. Now c’mon, it’s time for Potions and the last thing we need is to be late for that.”
“Now let’s go before lunch is over. We have Charms after and having energy for it is always a good idea.”
“Get back down Mr. Potter, I’m not finished with you.”
~parseltongue~
"Speach"
“Clearly you won’t be allowed to play quidditch. As an Omega we, meaning your Beta and Alpha, won’t be able to deal with you being in that kind of danger. You’ll have to tell your team that due to your condition you won’t be playing any longer. As for your fellow Gryffindors, it’s up to you and Draco if you get to see them or not.”
“There is nothing there. I see nothing at all that may explain this imaginary pain Potter is apparently feeling. And you’re sure he wasn’t faking it?”
“Apparently he is not faking. He even fainted from the pain this time, but once I arrived the pain was gone like it never existed. If I didn’t know any better I’d say I was... Oh crap!”
“Wha? Oh, sorry sir, I was trying to calm myself down before hearing any more news.”
“What do you want Potter? We have better things to do than to spend time with Slytherin’s new playmate.”
Harry had to promise to show him the chamber of secrets just to get him to accept that this was all the truth. Malfoy just stated he wouldn’t believe it until he saw the chamber and they left it at that.
“Oh Harry I was so worried! I thought for sure the dragon was going to get you.”
“If the rest of the team is fine with it I don’t care, he has to be there with you anyways. Now, for potions I am no longer allowed to assess you, the headmaster is afraid that I’ll play favorites with the both of you so what will happen is you will still learn from me and do the same work as everyone else but someone else will grade you, for the practical part of the lessons you both will work together when it’s partnered work and someone else will examine it when class is over. You may just have to wait some time before getting your results compared to everyone else.”
“That’s enough everyone. If I see this again I will be taking points. Potter, can you change it back or do you need any help?”
“Severus calm down! He’s petrified and you are making it worse!” Draco pulled Snape away from Harry and forced him to get out of the room, leaving Harry alone and hopefully able to calm himself.
And all of a sudden he dropped his book and ran to the door leaving Malfoy confused and alone in the room. Malfoy got up and followed Snape towards the infirmary.
Once he finished his letter he put away his quill and ink and placed the letter in an envelope and set it aside to give to Snape the next day. He got up and went to his trunk to get ready for bed, saw that Harry was asleep so he decided to bring it all to the washroom outside their room to get ready.
Harry just looked surprised. More books? What? He thought back to when he and Hagrid did the first year shopping and realized that Hagrid was the one that told him what books he needed. So he got up and ran to their room and started going through his trunk to find his first year supply list. Malfoy was left behind at the dinner table with a shocked look on his face wondering what he said. So he got up and followed Harry to their room only to find Harry sitting on his bed with the list in his hands and tears falling from his eyes.
If only he knew what was already told to the school regarding their status and what rumors have also been going around…
“Seriously? Ron, this is your fault! You had to sabotage a volatile potion for revenge even though we told you it was a bad idea! And Hermione, even if I wasn’t in this bond I’d still be gay, I just realized it myself but it wouldn’t have changed that at all. And of course I wasn’t happy that I’m bonded with two people who hate me, but there is literally nothing I can do! Having them more than 2 kilometers away causes me intense pain, I have to be physically close to them, but that doesn’t mean emotionally I am attached, which just makes this bond even worse. I was counting on you two to stick by me this time and actually be my friends!”
“This is going to make things even harder for us Slytherins. I mean the rumors were bad enough but this paper is telling the truth and making things public so now there’s no hiding from it…”
Draco decided that he needed to calm himself down in any way and just try to figure out what he wanted to do. He wanted to trust his bondmates, but he was tired of being stuck in between them. He had to find a way to get both Harry and Severus to connect somehow together, to find a link that joins them and that they can share some sort of passion together. He and Severus have potions, and the fact he knew Severus since he was younger helps them understand each other as well. But Severus has been against Harry since the beginning and Harry not having his books didn’t help things, but it wasn’t his fault… Maybe he should tutor Harry and see if potions could be his thing as well? And what about his story about Hagrid and his letter envelope; was that all real or was Severus right and he just made it all up for some sort of pity? What about all the adventures Harry told him while in the hospital… Were those all made up as well? Would Potter really go that far into making stories up just for more attention?
If only it was that easy…
Harry was shocked. Snape apologized. To him! Maybe things will be better between them all now.
Harry winced and looked down. He didn’t know what to do. He’s pretty sure that he isn’t supposed to tell anyone what Umbridge is doing to them. He slowly looked up and saw that the professor seemed pretty angry with him and it made him unsure who he feared more, Umbrigde or Snape…
Snape rushed out of the potions lab and walked quickly to the boys’ bedroom and slammed the door open. Then his anger just disappeared when he noticed the bedroom and the rest of their rooms was empty.
The next morning the boys took turns getting ready for their big day back. Harry still wore his Gryffindor robe even if he was going to be an honorary Slytherin. It’s not like he had any other choice, he didn’t own any other robes anyways.
Harry sat at the table and made his own taco, unknowingly showing Draco how to make a taco as he’s never had anything like it. Draco followed along and took a bite after Harry.
They got to the classroom just in time for Professor McGonagall to give them a look. They knew they were cutting it close. Harry just followed Draco towards the back of the classroom where Draco’s gang was waiting with room for them both. Harry still felt out of place, especially in his Gryffindor Robes. At least he had a break from the rest of the Gryffindors; Slytherin had Transfiguration with the Ravenclaws and, hopefully, they were less against him than the looks they were giving out.
Draco and Snape looked at him in surprise, not expecting Harry to be cooking never mind for them.
In fact, the three of them are now involved in a permanent bond.
He took a moment to calm himself and looked deep into his connection with the boys to see if he can feel where they might be at. But all he felt was Harry in pain and Draco feeling peaceful wherever they were. His Alpha feelings did not like what this could mean, but he knew that if Harry was hurting that Draco wouldn’t have anything to do with it so they must be separated in some way.
“What... I mean… How do you know this is permanent?”
Harry looked over at Malfoy and just gave him a small watery smile. Then he huddled in bed and fell asleep. ‘
Snape nodded agreeing with that statement. Unfortunately he also knew that without any results there was nothing they could do, especially if the pain came and went in such short bursts.
For the next couple hours they spelled his trunk to only let his bondmates and himself to open the trunk. They figured if ever they needed to add anyone else to that they could do so later. Surprisingly they got along, and Harry even thought Draco was decent at teaching; Draco was also surprised that Potter would listen intently and try his hardest at actually performing the spells.
Harry just managed to change his outfit back when McGonagall asked him. But as soon as she turned around someone changed his outfit back to a skirt, but this time his shirt was something that said ‘Slytherin’s Toy’. He just sat down and gave up changing it figuring that until the class is over it would just keep changing back. Draco was not impressed. He was getting abnormally angry for Harry figuring that his bonded feelings were starting to really act up.
“No I just woke up late myself and didn’t think…”
“We are not going to be your money makers, Mr. Potter, we still expect you to care for yourself and if getting a job is what you need to do that then that is what you will do, as for friends, we are not keeping you prisoner, you may still keep your friends, even if it is one of their faults that we are even discussing this. The only time that this will become a concern is if we decide on having children.”
"Speach"
Harry was a little shocked and disappointed that this meant he couldn’t keep the classes he had with his friends. Then he remembered that he had no friends at this time so it wouldn’t matter. So he figured he’d ask about other concerns he had.
, that’s . . . That’s brilliant, Draco. Honestly.”
Harry’s jaw went slack.
“Shhh, shhh,
“Stop looking at me like that; I’m fine,” he pleaded.
Harry knew that now; but, again, he was not a telepath. He couldn’t read Draco’s emotions if Draco didn’t communicate with him. At the time, he’d thought that they were using each other.
himself.
Potter thought he was
Draco could have sagged with relief, and he did not want to think about how worried he’d gotten that Harry had gone and abandoned him.
“You’re just going to have to show up in person,” Draco told him one lazy Sunday afternoon as they cuddled in bed, fully clothed, with Draco tracing patterns on Harry’s chest.
There was too much they hadn’t talked about yet. Harry wanted to spend the rest of his life fixing that.
Potter visibly deflated with relief. “Okay. Sorry, I just . . . That sort of winds me up, you know?”
feel about him?”
“No,” Draco repeated.
“That’s not fucking
Draco thrummed his fingers on his other hand while he waited impatiently for the floo call to go through.
“Malfoy, rape is a serious thing,” said Potter, “and I may not be an Auror, but Ron is. And I know they don’t take that lightly, no matter who it is.”
“Fuck, Potter, please,” Draco begged, feeling his hole stretch obscenely. “I need more,
“What-”
Hurt washed over Harry’s features, but he withdrew his hands.
Draco shook his head back and forth, and the words flowed out of him freely. “I would
“My uncle beat me, my cousin and his friends bullied me, they starved me, I was their personal servant and cooked most of their meals, and if they were angry with me or I spoke out of term, they’d lock me in a cupboard under the stairs, where I slept.”
Draco was going to fall over.
“More morning sickness potion?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
Draco took a shaky breath. “Okay,” he said. “Okay.”
Draco couldn’t suppress his smile. “Really?”
“Well, I told him to stay far away from you, of course,” said Mother, and Draco’s frazzled mind struggled to keep up.
“Oh, sweetheart . . . I’ll be right there. Just hang on tight, honey.” Pansy ended the floo call.
Harry looked deep into his frantic grey eyes. He took a tentative step closer to the other man, yearning to touch, but knowing he was forbidden.
Pansy audibly gasped. “Oh my god.”
“There’s actually a sale going on right now for this section of the store, so your product is half off,” Draco said kindly.
“Let me show you to your room,” said Cindy. She gestured for Draco to follow her. Once they reached the narrow hallway with doors on either side, she stopped in front of one door on the left. “This is you.”
“Oh, god,
Draco sighed. He was beginning to realize that he had acted incredibly ungrateful toward Pansy, pushing her away and treating her terribly when she only wanted to help. He felt like the worst friend in the world.
The memories continued to assault him, and Draco clamped a hand over his mouth to prevent any sobs from escaping. Now was not the time. He had
“Ohhh, Harry, I’m coming, I’m about to come-”
“Draco, are you
“N-No . . . He didn’t. He . . . He wants nothing to do with me. I screwed up, guys. I screwed up so bad.”
There were many different kinds of hamburgers to choose from. Some had cheese, others had pickles and caramelized onions and jalapenos and tomatoes. Draco was frankly overwhelmed.
“Yeah,” said Draco. “I think so, too.”
“Don’t call me that,” pleaded Draco. “Not after what you did.”
“It’s the rules,” the voice answered simply, sounding vaguely irritated.
When he got home, he collapsed onto the couch and put his head in his hands.
“I just assumed, without even asking you, and I-”
“You want to smooth things over so your next firecall won’t be awkward. You’re doing this for the sake of your cock, Harry.”
The apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
He thought back to the last time he’d called Draco beautiful, when he’d been trying to coerce him into bed. His stomach twisted into knots with guilt. But, he reminded himself, Draco had forgiven him. And was learning to trust him again, one day at a time.
Draco didn’t know what they were supposed to talk about now. What
“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, and he sounded alarmed.
“Sure thing,” Potter smiled at her. “Malfoy?”
“You want to go to a pub with
Draco released a stuttering breath.
“Let me get this straight. You’re . . . In
“I did not fancy him!” Harry exclaimed, though the darkening blush on his face conveyed otherwise.
When they reached Draco’s flat, his nerves were on fire where Potter touched him. He wanted Potter’s hands on him, everywhere. And the realization nearly made him double over, because he knew what that meant for him.
“Draco . . .”
“M-Mother had to levitate me out of the room, but after that she wasn’t allowed to see me while I healed.”
Potter scooted closer to him, and Draco allowed their legs to touch. The contact filled him with warmth.
Harry looked crestfallen. “You aren’t happy working here? I thought you loved books.”
, I see how it’s a problem,” Draco snarled.
“I, well . . . Alright.” Draco couldn’t believe he was agreeing to this.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “It absolutely was.”
Draco felt the ache in his chest diminish, just a little bit.
“You- You want to go to a pub? With me?”
“That wasn’t you,” Mother breathed, looking crestfallen. “You had a wand held to your head.”
Draco took a moment to consider her words. She had a point.
Draco nodded fervently. “I have everything I need-”
“Mhm,” Draco whined, hole clenching at the loss. “Wanna- I wanna ride you. Can I do that?”
They kissed in earnest as Draco continued rocking his hips, and then Potter was saying, “Let me fuck you properly, baby. Lie down.”
Harry chuckled. “Very well,” he said.
Potter nodded, a soft smile of his own curling on the right side of his lip. “Really.”
Harry removed one hand from Draco, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Jesus
you.”
going on about him in your sixth year. I thought it was just your saving-people thing going out of whack again, but you . . . You
“That you two have engaged . . . sexually.”
“I still don’t know your favorite color,” Harry blurted out, and Draco’s chest tightened, because that really wasn’t fair. “It’s nearly November, and I still don’t know it.”
Harry decided to refrain from telling her he quit the Aurors, because it was neither the time nor place. “As good as it can be, I guess.”
He did a thorough scan of the room, assessing its contents. In one corner, two middle-aged patients were playing a Muggle board game with a big tower of blocks. It appeared as though the object of the game was to pull blocks out and keep the tower standing up. In another corner, a woman was reading a magazine. In the middle of the room, at the table, three more patients sat coloring and doing word searches. In another corner was Cindy the tech, a young African American woman who looked to be about Draco’s age. She looked up from her magazine and made eye contact with Draco, then immediately rose and made her way over to him.
“Fuck you, Pansy,” Draco snarled. “You’re too caught up in your own life to give a shit about mine. Talking about how I’m putting my problems on you. Can’t you see that I’m trying to do the exact opposite? It’s not my fault you worm your way in and
“Just a shag,” Harry reiterated.
“What if he never sees it?” asked Harry.
“Mmm.”
“Would you stop calling yourself that?” Potter asked him gently. “It isn’t true, you aren’t one, and you don’t deserve to ostracize yourself from our world because of one mistake you made seven years ago.”
Draco sighed. “Do you want any?”
“You wanted to check on me. Did Pansy send you?”
“Certainly not,” Harry said, and now he was definitely poking fun at him. “I could have blabber-mouthed all over town about how the owner of The Potion Depot is handing out free samples to attractive blokes-”
On the third day, he heard a knocking at his door. He hadn’t bothered to dress that day since he didn’t have work, and he had an unpleasant feeling who it was.
“Just how shitty the fates are.”
“Just had a row with Pansy; nothing major,” said Draco passively, and in spite of himself and the rules of their arrangement Harry found himself wondering what the row was about. But the rules were, no personal questions.
Ron and Harry exchanged a curious glance, but voiced their affirmations and left the room without argument.
Draco stared numbly at the door. He wanted to hurt himself. Desperately. He remembered how distraught Harry had been when he’d seen his arm all sliced up, and how he’d consoled a crying and sniffling Draco. He wanted to hurt himself because Harry no longer cared whether Draco hurt himself. It would probably make him happy, even.
“I just- It’s only-” He cut himself off, breathing in deeply as his chest constricted.
“Why do you think?” Harry’s voice was husky, and low, and his hand had trailed down to Draco’s wrist, thumbing the delicate limb and tracing intricate patterns on the strip of pearly skin.
Potter shrugged. “Yeah. If that’s alright with you. I’m off work now, and it’s nearly five, which is when you close. I figured I’d hang around here for the next fifteen or so, and then we could go.”
“H-How?” he exclaimed.
The bastard had the nerve to look
Harry punctuated his sentence with a brutal pound that sent Draco soaring to the heavens above, and his grip on the table loosened. He lay limply on the table, sweat accruing across his temples, as Harry fucked him into oblivion.
Harry leaned down and pressed their bodies together, kissing him tenderly as he wrapped an arm around Draco’s back to bring him closer. Draco wrapped his legs around his waist, eliciting a groan that traveled straight to his growing cock.
“Sweetheart, you didn’t
“How can I be sure?” Draco asked him.
Draco laughed, stepping closer to Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, breathing in his scent.
“I bet you would let me take you right here, right now.”
Draco smiled into his breakfast, feeling lighter than he had in months.
“Indeed.”
“What makes you say that?” he asked carefully.
“Well, maybe it’s
“We do have a lot to talk about,” Draco agreed. “Like how you begged me to take you back right after you found out your child was miscarried.”
Narcissa’s hands flew over her mouth. “You
“Just when you’re about to come, I’ll pull off and edge you, leaving you dangling for me, just the way you like.”
“Harry.”
“I’m going to ruin you.”
“Oh, god,
“You knew, and you didn’t tell me.”
“No. I’ve taken up enough of your time tonight. I’ll see myself out.”
He didn’t need to go far, though, until he found something that made his very heart freeze over.
. Do you really think they’d accept one on their staff?”
Potter’s smoldering stare softened, and his lips curled up in a small smile. “Anything you like, Malfoy.”
"You shouldn’t entertain it. Block their pathway," said Hermione.
“I’ll kill him. I’ll
“I wanted to tell you I’ve noticed a change in Harry. Since you two started dating. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence.”
And he began to thrust.
“Did you comfort him?”
“Draco . . .” Mother sighed again, squeezing his hand. “You can’t do it for me. You need to do it for yourself.”
at him.
Harry smiled down at him. “Only if you’re comfortable, of course. It’s no skin off my back. You weigh but a pound.”
Eager at the chance to deflect his feelings, Draco found himself nodding along with Theo’s words.
Blaise rounded on Pansy. “You knew about this, and you didn’t tell us?”
sent Draco’s head absolutely spinning, but he had more important things to focus on. Like how
Draco didn’t know how to answer that. His silence manipulated the expression on Pansy’s face into something hard and unpleasant.
Draco smiled back. It was a strained thing, and he wondered if Potter would notice. “What do you usually get?” he asked, broaching for a safer subject.
“You can tell Pansy to go fuck herself.” Draco’s voice sounded weak, and fragile. Harry’s heart broke clean in two.
Draco basing his mental stability off of Harry’s relationship with Ginny was a major red flag. Concern flared inside Harry like a billowing flame.
“It’s
“Then I better see take-out boxes here when I swing by,” Pansy said.
“You’d do that?” Her voice sounded very small.
He drew in a deep breath, summoned the words in his head, and willed them to be sent to Potter:
Thing was, aside from the night he and Draco had fought, he hadn’t wanted to.
Harry began peppering Draco’s neck with kisses, moaning and humming sweetly.
“So you admit it.”
“You ruined
“He’s having a baby, and he didn’t tell me. He’s having a baby, and he didn’t tell me.”
“Why?” Draco couldn’t help but ask.
Draco surrendered into the embrace, letting his head fall on Harry’s shoulder as his frame sagged and he gulped breath after breath. Utterly exhausted, he eventually lifted his head and looked at Harry with imploring eyes.
“I-I don’t understand. Just last night, you were saying you . . . You . . .” Draco couldn’t force the word out. It stuck to his tongue like salt water taffy.
Stung, Harry scowled at his friend. “I ended things with Draco.”
“Are you really alright, though?” Pansy asked. “I know consoling him couldn’t have been easy for you to do.”
Narcissa’s eyebrows pinched together. “Draco can’t do sexual relationships,” she said instantly. “I know my son. He’s far too emotional.”
“Well.”
He thought of Mother. How he would never feel her warm embrace again. He wanted to cry.
“I tried to tell her that Draco’s changed-”
“I found you
Gasping so softly it was inaudible, Draco felt a prickle of a spark where Potter touched him. He watched as Potter slid his hand further, until his fingers reached Draco’s knuckles. Then his thumb was making soft, gentle circles on Draco’s skin.
“You’re sure you don’t love him?” Ginny asked, peering deep into his eyes. “It’s just a shag?”
The next time Draco came to, he blinked blearily and scanned his surroundings. It took him a moment to remember why he wasn’t in his flat, then everything came screaming back.
But was he? Harry had treated him so kindly, touched him so gently. He’d also made it explicitly clear he wanted something more than just sex.
“Legally, she doesn’t,” said Hermione. “It’s both your guys’ kid.”
“You ready?” the tech asked him.
The gesture was so gentle that it was everything Draco could do not to cry.
tell me. I believe that with all my heart.”
“Do you love him?”
“Draco, I . . . I fucked up. So bad. But I can’t lose you again, I promised myself I’d-”
cause conflict?” Ginny exclaimed, outraged. “We’re not in love, Harry. Why would we get married, or even start up a relationship, if we’re not in love? Don’t you see what a waste that is? And you didn’t even bother asking me about my love life, did you? I went on a date the other night. Albeit, that was before I found out I was pregnant- now, I’m not sure he’ll stick around. But that’s beside the point!”
“I’ll go tomorrow, Pans.”
The rush, the excitement, of being caught, was enough to weaken his legs.
“T-They used to torture me with it,” said Draco, voice breaking. Harry continued rubbing the skin of his hand, giving him space. “Bella used to laugh and break down my mind piece by piece.”
“Can I, please?” Potter asked, gesturing to the array of scars. Draco wasn’t sure what he meant so he nodded to see what would happen, which is why when Potter dipped his head down and began leaving light kisses over each scar, he first jumped in surprise, then settled when he felt Potter’s hand rubbing soothing circles at his side, tucked inside his open shirt.
Hermione smiled at him. “Thank you, Draco,” she said. “You don’t know what that means to me.”
“Then what is it?” Draco’s eyes bore into Harry’s own, wide and imploring.
Draco sighed. Of course he’d gone and given himself away. Potter could see right through him. That certainly wouldn’t do.
“This isn’t about any of that right now,” said Harry, letting go of his wrist. “This is about your inability to look after yourself.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know.”
“He fucking
Harry planted both his hands on Draco’s face, rubbing softly. Draco released his breath in a stuttering gasp.
“You’re
And that was the end of that. Or so Draco thought.
“And I accept your apology,” Draco continued. “If you’ll accept mine for kicking you out.”
“Well, in that case, no.” Draco’s tone left no room for discussion.
“Well, maybe I’m afraid to tell you my favorite color,” said Draco. “Maybe I’m afraid that you’ll take my favorite color and use it against me. And I won’t be able to tell anybody else my favorite color.”
Harry pulled back, green eyes boring deep into Draco’s.
“No if, and’s, or but’s. He is not to come anywhere
“You want me to blow you?” Draco asked innocently.
“Malfoy?”
“Let me spell the door locked,” Draco murmured, reaching in his pocket for his wand and casting a quick locking charm at the door. Harry wasted no time in smashing his mouth against Draco’s, backing him into the table. Draco sighed and gasped into Harry’s domineering kiss, and swallowed down a whimper as Harry hoisted up his arse and sat him down on the cluttered table. Draco pushed some books aside, not caring even as he heard them land on the floor. As he wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist he returned his attention to Harry, who had begun to nibble deliciously on his neck, whispering pure, unadulterated filth into his milky skin.
“Harry’s having a baby,” Draco said softly, feeling tears well up in his eyes. “I can’t- I don’t-”
“Let’s get this off you, hmm?” Potter murmured, dipping a hand beneath Draco and coaxing him into a sitting position. Draco shrugged the garment off himself with ease, discarding it on the floor next to Potter’s jumper. Draco began getting to work on his belt, but then he felt a large pair of hands over his, halting his movements.
“I don’t need pity, Pans.”
“Mate, I’m sorry,” said Greg, “but someone’s gotta say it. I could see you and Potter happening.”
“Is that a threat?” Draco asked her, tone clipped.
“You were too late. Some best friend you turned out to be.”
“That’s alright.” Annie wrote something down, then looked deep into Draco’s eyes. “What happened when Harry re-entered your life?”
Draco gasped audibly and wrapped a shaking hand around his weeping, ruby cock, twisting and pulling furiously.
“I’m still me,” Draco reminded her. “I’m still the man that hurt and tortured people.”
“Why did you come to see me today, Harry?” Draco asked, willing his voice not to waver. His control was slipping rapidly like water through his fingers.
“Oh. You mean Ginny?” Potter had that twinkle in his eye again, and it really wasn’t fair. Draco was not amused, but he nodded in response to Potter’s question.
“I just don’t understand,” said Pansy. “It doesn’t make any
“No! I think
“Malfoy . . .”
Panic swelled inside him. He was going to die. He was actually going to die, wasn’t he? He thought about all the times he’d poked fun at Harry, or made cruel remarks about his dead parents. How horrible he was to not have apologized.
“I love you, Harry,” he said, pressing a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips. “So much.”
“What makes you say that?” Draco asked, affronted.
“Yes.” Annie nodded her head. “What your father did to you is . . . is unspeakable, Draco. How do you feel about him being in prison?”
about Harry to his friends?
Potter’s face softened in understanding. “Oh, Draco,
“I know.”
Draco furrowed his brow at him. “Who are you to tell me what to do with my body?”
with him. Just because I recognize his human side a little more than some people doesn’t mean I love him.”
, for Christ’s sake. And Fred’s death is not his fault.”
“For everything.” His voice broke on the word. “For pushing you away, for snapping at you, for kicking you out of my flat when you were only trying to help, for all of it. I’m so sorry.”
Draco’s reflection stared back at him in the mirror. Exhaustion clung onto his skin, clouding his eyes. He held up the bottle of pills he’d purchased at Tesco’s, examining the label.
“Do you want to have sex with me or not?” Draco demanded, as he popped open the last button and aggressively pulled his shirt off his body and discarded it gracelessly.
“I could
It was a sight to see.
It wasn’t a full lie.
As Harry leaned in to kiss him, common sense returned like an ice cold bucket of water washing over him. He lurched away from him, horrified with himself.
“I know you do,” said Harry. “You’ve wanted to strip yourself bare for me for a long time, since Hogwarts, perhaps. I don’t even think you know how long.”
“Potter,” he choked out. “Please-”
“Who’s Harry?” Annie asked softly. “Is he the gentleman who was here before?”
“I have a trick,” Potter said with a smirk. Confused, but suspicious, Draco slowly allowed Potter to remove his hands from his belt. Then, with a snap of Potter’s fingers, Draco was completely naked and his trousers had been folded neatly on a nearby chair.
“How’s your stress?” Annie asked. “Do you have any major sources of stress in your life?”
“I can see that,” said Harry, treading carefully. “So we struck up a . . . friendship of sorts.”
Draco shrugged. “We took on a Dark wizard. What’s choosing out a hamburger?”
Harry sputtered again.
“Not much, other than wanting to talk about their soulmate. Which, come to think of it, they didn’t say much about because they asked me about mine.”
So they were back to Harry, then. This had to be progress. Right?
“When’s the last time you went grocery shopping?”
“Don’t be daft; no offense.”
“Oh.” Potter smiled at him. He actually
in love with him. Aren’t you?”
“Not particularly,” said Harry, wanting to look at Draco, soak him in, wondering how on earth this man could possibly love him. “I just wanted to swing by, see how you were doing.”
Draco’s heart thumped harder in his chest.
Draco leaned in to kiss him, then, and Harry let him. He let Draco push him back until he was lying on the pillows, groaning into Draco’s mouth as Draco slipped his hands beneath Harry’s shirt.
“Draco, wait, please,” Harry pleaded, finding that he did not want Draco to leave, even if sex was completely out of the question.
“So tight,” Potter growled into his mouth before pulling him into a bruising kiss. “So
Potter sighed, raking a hand through his black, curly hair. “I have nightmares,” he said, as if that were some big revelation.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted.
“Mmm-hmm,” Draco agreed, nodding his head as he swallowed.
“Yes.” Draco began rocking back and forth, covering his mouth to prevent his lips from wobbling or any embarrassing noises to come out. He was a monster, and he deserved to die. Why was Annie being so nice to him?
Harry laughed. It was a boisterous and obnoxious thing, and Draco both loved and loathed him for it.
Harry smiled softly at Hermione’s compliment.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t- Malfoy, that’s . . . You can’t think that about yourself.”
“I think it’s best if I go,” he said, standing up.
“But I don’t think you want me to leave.”
Draco sighed deeply.
“Harry, you aren’t in a right state of mind right now,” Draco said as stoically as he could with Harry
Defeated, Draco padded into the kitchen where he kept a notepad and pens on his counter. He wrote down his floo information and gave it to Potter.
“That’s right,” Harry continued, stepping closer to him. “You’re a
“No,” Draco said.
“You need to come? How do we ask?”
Potter looked at him. “I try to use it rationally. I only take it when I absolutely need it, and sometimes I have to choose my battles wisely.”
Draco, in spite of himself, gratefully took the cup from her and greedily gulped down its contents.
“Of course not,” said Hermione gently, “but if you did, you know it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“Fuck,” he murmured.
Harry smiled sadly at him. “I’m not going to let that happen. Not this time. We’re in this together now, and we’re going to do it right.”
Harry didn’t even have the mental means to chuckle at Draco’s good-natured sarcasm because he was too fixated on the latter part of his statement.
“Hey, wait, Malfoy, no, I didn’t mean it like that,” Potter said, reaching for him, and this time Draco let him. He let Potter close his large hands over his smaller one, rubbing the skin softly. Draco was ready to cry again.
Finally, Draco couldn’t take it anymore. He had to say something.
Before Harry could stop him, Draco stood up, put on his coat, and walked out of Grimmauld.
Potter chuckled. It was a beautiful thing. “Of course you do. I wouldn’t expect anything less. You always were a good brewer in school.”
“Yeah, well, it’s hardly fair of you to call me out for doing a job I hate when you were stuck in the same trap.”
“Please what, angel?” he asked, kissing back up his stomach and across his sternum.
for him.
Parkinson looked at him as if he’d grown two heads. “Would I be here if it were?”
“Any time,” said Blaise. “You know we’re always here for you. This is no different. Potter can suck it for all we care.”
He let Harry inside, taking in all his earthly beauty. His unruly, curly hair that spread across his shoulders, his sparkling green eyes that weren’t the slightest bit inhibited by his square spectacles, his tanned skin. Harry was a work of art, and Draco might be about to lose him forever. He gulped.
“And then I’ll eat you out until you’re begging for my cock, and I still won’t let you come. Not until my cock is inside you.”
“I already told you I’m comfortable with that, Draco.”
“So,” said Potter, fiddling with his bag, “why the limit?”
He had a routine. He’d always liked routines. Wake up, have breakfast, go to work, close shop, go back home, have dinner, bathe, and sleep. Wake up, repeat. He had one day off a week, and that was enough. It was all enough. Some days he had to convince himself more than others, but ultimately, it was enough.
“It’s blue,” Draco answered. “Light blue, to be more precise. A pastel, baby blue like the sky but a little bit softer, like a sheet fresh out of the wash-”
So, so much trouble.
“She’ll find out eventually.”
With a bow, the house elf exited the room.
He would never be enough for Harry.
Potter waved the bartender over and ordered another round of drinks. He handed the woman a few notes before Draco could even reach for his wallet.
Draco found himself shaking his head. Why was Harry making this so hard?
“Well, this changes everything,” said Pansy. “He might not be able to come anywhere near you right now, but he’s no longer tied down to the Weaselette.”
When Pansy firecalled him, he ignored it.
“And what would the Aurors have done? They despise me. Everybody does. They probably would have ‘forgotten’ about the case.”
“Well, the first step is your psychiatric evaluation. In the next few minutes, I’m going to bring in Annie, who’s been assigned to see over your treatment plan and work with you while you’re here. Speaking of introductions, my name is Debbie, your nurse, and if you have any questions about anything, please don’t hesitate to ask.”
“Could’ve fooled me,” muttered Harry. Then he looked back up at his friends, who fixed him with looks of concern.
Harry then demanded in his Auror voice that left no room for debate that he go with Draco- he wasn’t going to leave his side ever again.
“What if I don’t trust you to guard my favorite color?” he let out in a whisper, taking a step closer to Harry. The air crackled with tension. He swallowed thickly.
Draco, as it turned out, only needed a week until he was ready. One frosty, snowy evening after work, he apparated outside the wards of Grimmauld Place and waited for Harry to let him in.
Draco watched, helpless to stop him and tell him how sorry he was for being such a coward, as the man he loved planted a soft kiss on the crown of his head and turned around to walk out of his life forever.
“Ohh, sweet Merlin . . .”
“Yeah,” said Potter, this time definitely in awe. “We are.”
“That would be correct.” Harry chuckled nervously.
“I never asked you to be.”
He and Harry were two sides of the same old, rustic coin. A coin nobody truly wanted to spend.
“Again.”
To Draco’s horror, he felt hot tears prickling at the corners of his eyes. He would not
Draco moaned sleepily, raising his arms above his head and yawning, stretching in a way that resembled a cute kitten.
Before Harry could respond, the house elf returned with the tea.
“No, you’re here because Pansy made you.”
“You like this,” Harry said, as more memories and feelings surged forward in Draco’s head. “You like me manhandling you, taking control. It gets you off.”
with you telling me those things,” Draco said. “I asked because it took me by surprise, because of how . . . Easy it feels to talk to you. I feel like I’m really listening to what you’re saying, and you’re really listening to me. A real conversation. It feels . . . really good.”
to be sorry for.
“Kudos to you,” Harry snapped.
Draco smiled softly at him, realizing that this wasn’t the end. Potter was only respecting what he’d asked him to do, and they could continue this conversation another day once Draco got his bearings.
“Love it when you call me baby. Makes me feel safe and t-taken care of,” continued Draco, somewhat shakily for Harry had begun milking him.
“Did you come over just to lecture me about spending time with my mother, or is there a real reason why you’re here?” Draco asked her harshly.
“Not that this hasn’t been fun, because it has,” he said smoothly, dusting down his shirt and spelling the table clean. “But I think it’s time for you to go.”
As if Pansy read his mind, she sighed. “Oh, you can relax, Draco. I’m not
“Gonna taste myself on you, baby,” Harry murmured, burying his face in Draco’s crack and licking a stripe that went from his crack all the way to his perineum, collecting some come in the process.
think that of you. Ever.”
“Do not give up now, Draco,” he cried. “Not now, not before I tell you how much I fucking
“Ron, I . . . He already told me.”
“It’s not,” Pansy said miserably. “Because you have to break things off with him, and it’s going to hurt you.”
“H-How? W-Why? Why would anyone- Why would your own family treat you like that, knowing who you are and what you went through?”
Harry could only sit, stunned, on his sofa as he soaked in tonight’s events like a sponge.
“Well, we won’t be able to hide this from your family forever,” said Harry. “You’re going to start to show. And before that happens, we need to tell them. Have you told them? Am I the first person you’ve told?”
Draco was helpless to watch the man he loved leave his flat.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, rubbing Draco’s hand. “Look at me.”
“Ohhhhh, Draco, that’s so fucking good.”
“Okay.”
“Come here, baby.” Harry sat up and gathered Draco in his arms, flipping them over so Draco was on his back staring up at Harry with unsure eyes.
to Potter.
He trusted him.
“You care about me. Is that why you’re here tonight?”
Draco exhaled shakily, hyper-aware of Potter’s hand on his. His hand was fiery hot under Potter’s touch.
“What?” she snapped.
He was going to be sick. He thought of Draco, the way his grey eyes had lit up when Harry told him he loved him. Was he really about to give that all up for his baby?
Harry was on the brink of collapse. What was he supposed to do with this information? Tell Draco he wanted him, too? It seemed simple enough, but what if he was too late?
He knew Pansy would be destroyed. She loved him dearly. He was selfish to do this to her, but he couldn’t carry on any longer. He was stuck in an endless cycle, and he was too afraid to work himself out of it, and Harry, the center and beating heart of the wizarding world, hated him.
“I love you, Harry,” he breathed. “I love these taut muscles. Your body, your personality, all of it. And I’m . . . I’m ready to let you in my head.”
Potter frowned. “You’ve been hit with a stinging hex before?”
“I’m sorry,” Narcissa said, softer than a pin drop. “Forgive me, Harry, I’ve made a mess.”
“And you let him.”
“Draco . . . Draco
“Oh, Draco,
Potter sighed. “I feel . . . I want to know if we’re on the same page. About what happened.”
made for light and breezy conversation, so he just shrugged and said, “Liability.”
“We don’t have to hold back anymore,” Harry breathed into Draco’s hairline, basking in the tenderness of the embrace. “We don’t have to hide.”
“Harry . . .”
Draco’s legs were wrapped around Harry’s waist, which wasn’t helping matters down south any. Not one bit. And he was making all these delicious little noises and whimpers as Harry kissed him . . . It was making Harry all hot and flustered.
“Okay,” said Potter, staring deep into Draco’s eyes. “Okay.”
“Take my arm,” Potter instructed. Draco did, and they disapparated with a loud crack.
Harry closed the distance between them, sliding a hand up his waist. Draco allowed the electrifying touch to wash over him, as Harry’s heady scent filled the very air he breathed. Harry pressed his forehead against his, breathing hard.
“Where is this coming from?” Harry exclaimed. “I never lusted after Draco in school-”
things like that.”
A thin hand flew to Draco’s mouth, and his eyes twinkled, though not unkindly.
“Hey, hey.” Harry leaned down and touched his shoulder, gently coaxing him into a sitting position. The room began to spin, and Draco’s head dropped.
Draco didn’t know what to do. Harry was so fickle it wasn’t
Harry smiled softly at him. “I think I really do, yeah.”
He folded himself into her again, clutching her waist tightly.
Harry pointed his wand at Draco, very, very gently. Then he said in a low voice,
“Draco tried to kill himself.”
Potter scoffed quietly. “Wow. I’m . . . Wow. Well, I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised, considering your posh upbringing.”
“I-I mean, I only meant-”
Hermione tucked a stray brown curl behind her ear. “I support Harry in whatever he chooses to do with his love life.”
, Harry. We’re here to get down to business. So, would you rather do this down here on the couch or side-along to your bedroom?”
“He’s helped me, too,” Draco supplied. “It doesn’t only go one way.”
“Wait, what did you get in a row about?”
and your
“I think you should write to your friends,” Harry blurted out.
, and I can’t- I can’t-”
“Don’t fuck around with me, Harry, please, just-”
Harry knew. He wanted to softly, carefully break down Draco’s barriers one by one until he was bare before Harry's eyes.
Draco wanted the man above him with the force of a thousand suns. His desire thrummed through his veins, buzzing in his brain. It had been so
Draco decided to let the matter go.
Draco’s only response was a breathy moan, and he went limp in Harry’s grip, panting raggedly. “Didn’t you already know that?” he asked.
“Here you are.”
“Honey . . .” Pansy’s hand traveled to Draco’s shoulder, rubbing up and down softly. “I think it’s best if you just let it go.”
be disgusted by you, Draco. I don’t want to have sex with you
That was exactly what had happened.
“It can be about all those things, too,” said Draco. “And I certainly feel like you . . . Explored me emotionally tonight. But it’s also about fairness.”
are a lot, I just meant that you’ve been through a lot, and it’s all right here,” Harry said, rubbing Draco’s hands again. He felt the unease slowly ebb away as Draco nodded at him.
Harry heard Hermione clear her throat.
“So if you didn’t deserve to die then, then doesn’t that mean you deserve to find happiness and joy in your life now? Life is about more than just surviving, Draco.”
Harry’s voice shattered on the word, and it wasn’t fucking
“Yes.”
“What’s wrong?”
“I’m done fighting,” Harry told him simply. “I just want you back. And whatever I need to do to make that happen, I’ll do.”
“No, I don’t have anyone over. It’s nearly nine o’clock at night.”
“Fuck the Dursley’s,” Draco said breathlessly. “And fuck my father- Ahh!”
“Good for you?” Draco tried weakly, not knowing what to do with the personal statement because his heart was about to leap out of his throat.
Harry chuckled. He spun around, just so he could look at Draco.
Harry looked like the news physically hurt him, which confused Draco. Why did he care?
Draco was starving, too. For an entirely different thing.
Draco begged, feeling wetness in his eyes once again. Harry silently urged him to lift his hips as his trousers and boxers slid easily down his slight legs, bunching up around his ankles. Once Harry discarded him of his shoes, he all but yanked his trousers the rest of the way off. He wasted no time in stripping himself of his robes and shoes.
Draco found himself nodding before he could stop himself. “Yeah, that’d be nice.”
“I may have to now,” said Harry with a shrug, as though the matter were out of his hands.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” Harry continued, stepping closer to him. “You seemed pretty upset when you left, and . . . Honestly, I didn’t want to leave you alone.”
“You mean aside from being deathly afraid to leave your flat for two years?”
“I know what’s expected of me when I take a bloke home,” said Draco casually, in spite of the tears threatening to fall. “And I ignored all the rules because I thought he was different.”
“Mhm?” He stopped rocking, running a hand through his disheveled hair. He couldn’t imagine the state of it right now. He desperately needed to bathe. He didn’t think he’d ever gone this long without doing so.
Guilt latched itself onto Harry and sank its tendrils into his skin like a leech. He had let this situation get entirely out of hand; by the time he had enough sense to return to himself and
Draco hadn’t meant to bring up the war, he really hadn’t. He only wanted to hear that boisterous, beautiful laugh again that rang like wind chimes in his ears. But instead he got criticism. What else did he expect?
“Your mother is overcompensating for neglecting you when you were a child. Ultimately, she cannot control who you choose to see.”
“I see you haven’t read my letters,” was all she said before Draco stepped aside from the frame to let her in.
. And I missed how light and airy things used to be, before we got complicated.”
“You really think you’re responsible for all that?”
“I’m not letting anything else happen,” Harry told her quickly. “I’m forbidding it, until you and I square things away. I’m here to ask for your blessing.”
“What makes you say something’s not right?” Harry asked, worry inflating in his stomach like a balloon.
“What I’m saying is,” began Harry, “you show them what you can do. Out of
“Gin, can we please focus on our child? I only told you I’m seeing someone because Ron also knows I’m seeing him, and if you tell him you’re pregnant with our child he’s going to literally have my head that I picked him over you.”
“You aren’t over it,” said Mother. “And I wouldn’t expect you to be. We need to find you a Mind Healer, so you can get better.”
“Cars,” he blurted out, which was the first thing his fretted mind could come up with. “I like cars.”
Draco’s condition began rapidly deteriorating. He began skipping meals, too tired to make himself proper food. When his pantry ran out of groceries, he didn’t bother restocking it.
Harry could only look helplessly, a tempest of emotions rolling through him. Draco
“That isn’t okay,” said Draco instantly, forgetting his manners. “You can’t just blame yourself for someone else voluntarily protecting you. Who really killed him, Potter?”
Draco had let himself be used for Harry’s pleasure. Draco’s self esteem had been so alarmingly low that he didn’t find it important to speak up about his preferences in bed.
“That was before I found out you knocked up my sister!”
Harry continued to pound his abused prostate, fucking Draco through his orgasm and whispering filth in his ear.
say that to me. You know nothing about my life, or me. You’re just a fuck, and we’ve established that, haven’t we?”
Draco nodded, playing with his bandage again.
“I suppose that wasn’t very wise of me,” he admitted bashfully.
“You said yourself I was looking better. What happened to that?”
“You’re so beautiful,” Potter breathed, barely above a whisper. “You know that? You are exquisite.”
since he’d been touched in a way that wasn’t bruising or hostile, and the gentleness of it all was almost enough to make Draco start crying again.
. He sighed contentedly.
“But what Harry did to you is completely unacceptable. He told me everything.”
, and I’ve never met two people less suited for each other. It’s like you bring out this monstrous side of him, that completely over-clouds his entire persona whenever he’s around you. And in turn, he weakens you and turns you into this spineless, cowering, pathetic
Potter sighed. “You have a right to think that. I won’t try and take it away from you. I just encourage you to . . . Reassess.”
When their arrangement had first begun, it seemed like Draco had wanted something more, but Harry was certain that was just their post-sex bliss that had plastered a saccharine coat over his words. There was no way Draco had
Had Harry saved him?
That patronizing
He would recognize that voice anywhere.
Draco fiddled with his nimble fingers, unsure of how to talk to his friend after the way they’d left things a few days ago. But not talking was better than talking about Harry.
Draco pressed his tongue into the roof of his mouth,
Harry planted another kiss atop Draco’s head. “I want all that and more. But-”
Draco lasted two days before he firecalled Harry.
“I can’t,” Draco said pathetically. “It’s
If Harry was going to reject him and stomp all over his heart, the least he could do was look at him.
“Erm, Potter?” he called out.
Draco was seeing stars he was so dizzy.
Harry held Draco’s ice cold face in his hands, thumbing the skin softly. How long had he been without air?
“It wouldn’t be anything like what you’re used to with Voldemort,” said Harry, and after all this time, Draco still flinched from the name. “It would be gentle, and tender, and affectionate.”
Harry came with a loud growl and pulled out of him, flopping on the bed beside him.
He wanted to hurt her, make her writhe and squirm the same way he had.
“I’d get fired,” Draco tried weakly, feeling Harry’s hand snake around his waist and hold him tightly.
Draco visibly relaxed, reaching for Harry with his other hand.
“Not today. Apparently she means nothing to him, but I’m ninety-nine and a half percent sure he only said that to get me into bed. I wonder if she even knows about me.”
, and he gasped for breath as Harry’s gentle shushing and cooing washed over him like a wave. Harry pulled out of the embrace to look at Draco’s tear-stained face, red-rimmed eyes and heaving chest.
Curious, and slightly apprehensive because he hadn’t invited anyone over, he cautiously approached the door and glanced through the peephole.
“What’d you have?”
“You- You- You what? You
“Draco,” he said softly, shaking the man’s shoulder gently. “Time to wake up now.”
. Gods, he was hungry. He picked up his fork and knife, placed his napkin in his lap, and was about to cut in, when he heard more boisterous, beautiful laughter, this time at his expense, so the windchimes weren’t quite as pleasant.
“Erm, Potter? Is there . . . Something else I can help you with?” Draco asked, feeling his heart begin to flutter rapidly in his ribcage. He found himself hanging onto Potter’s hypothetical answer in a vice grip like a child on a rope swing.
“I know, you’re right, of course it’s not enough,” Harry said, though he noticed Draco still made no move to pull his hand away from him. “I only wanted to tell you because I thought it would explain some of the . . . fickleness.”
For the first time, Draco wondered if Harry even knew himself.
“Why did he reject you?”
“I don’t remember asking you for relationship advice.”
“I won’t. But, Draco . . .” Harry was
“Hey, Gin,” said Harry, surprised. “What are you doing here?”
“Shhh, sweetheart, shhh,” Mother whispered, rocking him back and forth like a baby. Draco did his best to suppress a sob. “I know. I know.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth pulled up in a smile.
“Draco, I’m not leaving. You- I- What
“He was too powerful.”
“Try to breathe, okay? It’s okay, you’re okay, I’m not going to hurt you.”
When Draco awoke the next morning, the bed was empty, and he panicked, wondering if everything last night had been a dream. Then he took a look around- he was definitely in Harry’s room, not his own, and the dull soreness in his arse told him it definitely was
Draco immediately looked crestfallen. “Harry . . .”
want to hurt himself, because he didn’t want to do anything that would make Harry happy. And that was that.
Harry planted a kiss on his temple. “We’re not going anywhere for a while, believe me.”
They walked out of the pub, and it was still pouring rain, so Potter opened his umbrella with a little pop and invited Draco inside.
Draco, who was currently in pajamas, said he’d need thirty minutes to freshen up, and that he’d be right over.
“Then how did you mean it?” Draco whispered.
“And I love you,” Harry smiled at him. “Shall we go back out? There’s still more presents to open.”
“Because I was worried about you after leaving you alone like that. I didn’t want you to do anything to hurt yourself,” Pansy said, dark eyes imploring.
“Oh god!” Harry sprang up from the sofa as Parkinson put her coat back on. “This can’t be happening, this actually can’t be happening.”
Blaise glared at her. “Care to share?”
Potter took the hint. He flashed one last fleeting smile at Draco, and then he was gone.
“It was a long time ago,” said Harry. “It’s not something I can just wake up one day and recover from; I’m working on it in therapy like everything else. But it’s getting easier to manage as I get older.”
“Great observational skills. Would you like a medal?” Draco quipped as Pansy walked into his flat and took a seat on his sofa, crossing her legs. She wore a tight blouse and a skirt that left little to the imagination.
“Did you?” Annie asked, sounding stunned, professionalism slowly ebbing away. “Hurt people?”
Harry knew exactly what it was. He wanted to hear Draco say it.
him like that. “You just lost your son. You don’t want me. You want warmth.”
After she apparated out of his flat, he numbly padded into the bathroom as though on autopilot and fished under the sink with violently shaking hands for the stack of razors he kept hidden in a drawer, just in case.
“Talk some sense into her, then,” said Harry. “Because I already tried.”
“Salazar’s tits.” Harry raked a hand through his own messy hair. “We’re having this conversation again? I thought I told you- I’m not doing it because it’s the right thing to do. I’m doing it because it’s
Giving him an awkward stroke, Draco untied the letter from the owl’s leg. The owl immediately flew out the open window. Wasting no time, Draco tore it open.
He couldn’t have come up with anything better to say?
this?” She wacked him on the arm. “We had a system. Whenever you feel like that, any hour of the day or night, you call me.”
“It’s pretty serious.”
Draco bristled. “It pays the bills. I was left with nothing after the war, paying it all in reparations, so this is all I have.”
“Yes.”
Once he paid Draco the amount he owed, he pocketed the change and accepted the bagged product from Draco.
“Whoever it is, they can’t be that bad,” said Greg. “You don’t have any resentments toward anyone except Potter, and the universe wouldn’t be that cruel.”
“Pansy, I dunno how many times I need to tell you this. You don’t have to keep coming back here.”
“Look at you, baby, all nice and hard for me. Gonna fill you up with my thick cock, just the way you like it, hmm?”
about this-”
Draco gasped again as Potter placed his other hand on the side of his face and just looked at him for a minute, with those striking green eyes. Then he was leaning in to press a kiss on top of Draco’s head, and Draco couldn’t help but look up. Potter’s face ended up right in front of Draco’s instead, and Draco found himself leaning in, nerves on fire. Potter closed his eyes and closed the gap between them, pressing his lips ever so softly against Draco’s.
“What’s going to happen, once I go to the psychiatric ward?” Draco asked, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, which certainly wasn’t working.
“F-Fuck,” Draco whimpered.
“Was there something you needed here, Potter?” Draco got back to organizing books, attempting and failing to ignore the man in front of him who was stepping closer to him
Ginny visibly deflated. “I don’t want your support if it isn’t genuine.”
His hands were shaking while he poured the tumbler of whiskey into the glasses, and when he was finished he grabbed two ice cubes from the ice maker and dropped them in his own glass. Willing his hands to stay steady, he carried the drinks into the living room and handed Potter his as he took a seat beside him on the sofa. Close enough to be slightly suggestive, far enough away to ensure that Draco’s boundaries would not be crossed.
“Huh?” Harry asked sleepily, then his eyes landed on Draco and his entire stature relaxed. His face softened as he reached his arms out to touch him.
“Wait a minute, Draco, this isn’t-”
, since there’s nothing to support, anyway!” Harry exclaimed angrily. “He means nothing to me, he’s just good for a shag, so can you cool it with the theatrics?”
And it was all because of Harry.
Next thing he knew someone was by his side, murmuring soothing things in his ear, coaxing him to breathe and relax. But this only panicked him further, for he didn’t
“Yeah! In fact, it’s relieving to me because that means we’re in the same boat, about being emotionally attracted to each other.”
He couldn’t afford to have feelings for Draco; the blonde git would never like him back.
“You don’t mean that,” Draco said kindly, smiling sadly at him. “But that’s okay. I forgive you anyway, Harry.”
“Ginny, I’m trying to tell you he’s changed,” said Harry. “If given the chance, he would certainly apologize to you.”
“Yeah,” Harry said gently, taking Draco’s hands in his. “Just a lot to take in, that’s all.”
“How so?” asked Harry, and he didn’t look . . . hopeful, or happy, or any of the other emotions he should be experiencing right now if he truly loved Draco.
“G-Gonna come, gonna come,” Draco warned, and he was so
, and Draco was overwhelmed because he hadn’t expected Potter to grow into himself so much.
“I don’t care that you didn’t ask; I’m giving it, because you need to hear it. It’s destroying you. He’ll eventually go off and marry that Weasley girl as soon as he knows what’s good for him, and what’ll happen to you then, huh? How will that make you feel? If you cut ties now, you can heal,
“Love this scent,” Harry murmured as he began massaging Draco’s wet hair with the product. “Makes your hair smell so sweet and rosy.”
“B-Because I-”
“And he thinks,” said Draco, prickly as ever. “Careful, now. Don’t hurt yourself.”
Potter’s hand was on the table now, trailing closer to Draco’s until the tips of his fingers reached the tips of Draco’s.
Draco’s brain was turning all syrupy, his thoughts melting down to a single subject: Harry.
because you were with that Weasel girl. Now I know the truth, but can you imagine being in my head when I saw that firecall?”
“Draco.” Potter giggled quietly, smiling at him.
He would have to cut things off with Draco for good.
Draco nodded.
“You can stick around if you like, I suppose, but I’m going to be busy.”
“He’s your father,” Harry reminded him, pulling out his fingers to add a third.
Draco followed the tech to the visiting room, and the sight before him had his eyes already watering.
“Me too. First time this week without nightmares. You think it was a coincidence?”
Relief flooded Harry. He practically sagged with it. He thanked the man who had spoken to him and went into the room to see Draco.
“Me, neither,” Potter responded, so quickly that Draco nearly jolted with shock. “But, Draco, I . . . I don’t want to be your friend. I want something infinitely more dear.”
“Sometimes the truth is harsh, Potter,” he said, barely above a whisper.
Harry got him the water and sat down, and the two began to eat. Most of the meal was passed in relative silence, mainly because Harry was scarving down his food like a ravenous dog and Draco didn’t know how the fuck to start a conversation with this secret hanging over his head. Funny how Draco was used to silent meals with his family, but with Harry it felt wrong.
“That’s too bad,” Harry said, voice blistering.
“A bloke. He was conventionally attractive, as far as people go. And he was rather . . . Possessive of me that night.”
“It was
“Draco, you can’t go on like this. Retreating into your lair after every fuck, just to resurface again once he initates contact is a hideous cycle. Downright rude to your wellbeing, actually.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but all his retorts died on the tip of his tongue. He couldn’t think of anything adequate that would shut Harry up.
Pansy’s outraged squeak disrupted the otherwise peaceful silence of Draco’s flat.
“-Draco, Draco, open your eyes-”
“Okay,” he said.
Draco knew they’d never be together, but he deserved at least basic human decency. “I normally expect apologies to come in writing.”
“I mean, why do you get all tense every time I bring up your relatives?”
“I told you I didn’t-”
Harry hummed as he continued devouring Draco, reducing him to a writhing, whimpering mess. To his dismay, Draco felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes and his cock
“I-I’d prefer not to answer that right now.”
“I have a bone to pick with you,” Draco said, willing his voice not to shake.
like him back. That much was certain.
“I’ll go the day after.”
was the last time. He would never see Harry Potter or his god forsaken bed ever again.
“So it is about Malfoy. You said you ended things.”
. Without seeing
“Ugh!” Pansy sipped aggressively on her tea mug, before setting it down with a
“Guys!” Hermione exclaimed. “We’re not going to get anywhere by fighting. Harry, if you really love Malfoy, you’ll fix this. You need to go find him.”
“Oh, so it’s Potter now?” Harry sounded hurt.
And damnit, there he went excusing his actions again. Would Draco ever learn how to properly apologize? Why was being good so
“Fine, you want to play it like that? You want to kick every last person out of your life who still cares about you? Have it your way. Consider me gone.”
Harry and Draco had discussed in detail the parameters of their sex life, or lack thereof. No sex was to be had until Draco was ready, and Draco wouldn’t be ready until Harry and Narcissa made nice. Even then, Draco may not be ready right away, and Harry was more than fine with that. He’d be willing to wait the rest of his life.
So he found himself nodding, and sighed as Potter leaned back down to press another open-mouthed kiss on his sensitive neck.
Harry suppressed a growl. Agitation coiled in the pit of his stomach. “Ginny, I ended things with the man I love. For our baby. Would it kill you to have a little understanding?”
“Don’t you say it,” Harry commanded her, pointing his finger at the Floo. “Don’t you dare say he might have anyway. I pushed him over the edge.”
“What. Baby.” Draco vaguely realized he was shaking, violently, as he stood up from his chair, leering over his mother. “What baby?” he asked again.
“I said I love you, you moron.”
“We got in a fight,” Draco began carefully, noting the almost non-existent distance between Harry and his wand. Even though it had been years since Harry hexed him, old habits die hard. “And I blocked you from coming through my Floo. You knew you couldn’t have me, so you went for the second-best option. Not only is it incredibly humiliating to both of us, it tells me how you see me: as a piece of meat, nothing more. Am I right?”
“I’m glad my dreadful soulmate situation is amusing to you all,” said Draco.
Draco braced his hands on Potter’s shoulders, smiling down at him, leaning in to steal a kiss. Potter hummed into his mouth, then Draco was slowly sinking down onto Potter’s cock.
Pansy bought it. “Darling, I have a duty as your best friend to tell you that I may or may not have let it slip that you love him, too.”
Draco flinched back from the words as though he’d been burned.
Draco sighed. “What makes you so sure they’ll take me back?”
Now a panting, moaning mess, Draco could only fist the sheets and plead his needs to Harry.
“Really?”
“Draco, what are you thinking about?” Pansy asked him.
“That’s the thing, I don’t want you to feel like you have to half-arse this just because I’m scared,” said Draco, and he sounded so distressed that Harry wanted to bundle him up in warm blankets and hug him until he stopped shaking.
“Draco . . . You’re my son. I worry about you all the time, even when you’re healthy and happy. It’s what mothers
They both Apparated out of Grimmauld.
Draco gasped, arching his back off the bed. Harry chuckled. “Normally, one isn’t enough for you because you like the burn, but it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
“Harry?”
“Don’t you ever
“What the
Draco drew in a shuddering breath.
“That was . . . Wow.”
“Get out.” Draco crossed his arms to prevent his hands from shaking, digging his nails into the skin,
“Are you married or have a partner?”
Harry sank in a little further, and Draco gasped. Draco’s tight heat felt so mind-numbingly
“Parkinson, I’ve got to go,” he murmured, snatching his coat from the rack and wrapping himself up in the garment as fast as he could.
It was like reality snapped back into place, and Draco at last realized the weight of his decision. Of his mistake. It dropped on top of his chest like a ton of bricks, suffocating him.
“I mean, I was so . . .
“Harry, get off me.” He was firm, perhaps a smidge more than necessary, but assertiveness was a new avenue for him and he was not yet familiar with its many dips and twists and turns.
“I have just the thing,” said Draco, gesturing for Harry to follow him. Harry couldn’t get over just how much more . . .
Draco grinned as the message faded from his wrist with the tap of his finger. So Potter didn’t completely hate the message-him. That was certainly a good thing.
“We have much to talk about,” Pansy said.
And what about his privacy? Did that mean nothing around here?
. Nobody does.”
“What’s going on, Mother?” Draco asked.
that you loved me-”
There wasn’t much to say, because Potter was absolutely right. He watched in dismay as he took another bite of his burger.
“Hey, hey.” Potter’s gentle voice reeled him back to reality. “Relax for me, okay? Gonna take good care of you.”
He’d be breaking the rules if he asked Draco what the argument was about.
“Thought we were Harry now?”
“If you aren’t eating, that’s a problem. A serious one.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, pretty much. You can’t imagine how excited I was when I found out magic existed.”
“I know,” said Draco. “And I won’t fight you. I trust you.”
She was a sweet, tiny little thing, and when Draco held her, he had never felt so important. Significant. Right now, he held the life of a child in his hands, and it was beautiful.
. “Did you tell him you love him?”
He realized something in that moment, something that chilled him to his very bones.
Draco decided to ignore everything that was just spoken. “Just because he’s my soulmate doesn’t mean I can’t see other people. I can find someone else and be perfectly happy.”
Once he was inside, he noticed the inside of the house smelled . . . extra pleasant. Had Harry cleaned?
Draco secretly wished sometimes that he’d had that moment- that moment of realization that there was more to this world, a secret realm tucked away from the naked eye. Being a pureblood, he’d grown up taking magic completely for granted, so he’d never had that. But he rationalized it was not the time to talk about that with Harry.
Anger hit Draco with the force of a bludger, then. Blazing hot anger.
“That’s it. So good for me, just relax.”
“Draco . . .” Harry slid down Draco’s body until he was on his knees, head level with Draco’s stomach. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him in and planting a kiss on Draco’s tummy.
Potter put his head in his hands “Darling, I didn’t- I never meant to- I’m just so fucking sorry.”
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. “You think she bribed me?”
“You care about him,” said Narcissa, and Harry’s heart picked up.
Potter cocked an eyebrow at him, looking at him funny. Draco didn’t like it one bit.
“I know I screwed up, and I don’t deserve another chance with him,” said Harry, blinking the wetness out of his eyes. “But he means everything to me. And he hasn’t told me yet, but I think he feels the same way.”
Resigning, he stepped inside from the frosty cold and shrugged off his peacoat, hanging it carefully on Draco’s coat rack.
Draco moaned as Harry reached down and palmed his cock, squeezing the hardening bulge in the exact way he knew Draco liked.
“I’ve got it,” he offered, wordlessly spelling the stain away.
The first thing Draco felt was an ache in his stomach. This couldn’t be death- Death wasn’t this painful, was it? Could you feel pain in the afterlife?
that!”
So why was Harry still wasting time with him?
“Alright, Harry.”
Harry instantly obeyed, retracting his hands as though he’d been burned and scrambled to his feet. He looked horrified with himself.
“I can’t lose you, Draco. Not like this. Please let me help you.”
over the years. His shoulders had become broader, his arm muscles left him weak in the knees, his hair was just past his shoulders, black and curly as ever, and his eyes, green as a dewy forest at dawn, sparkled kindly behind rectangular spectacles.
can’t do this.” Draco pulled away from his grip, but Harry chased after him like a cat to a mouse.
But he was here on important business, he reminded himself, and he still hadn’t gotten to the bottom of why Draco looked as though someone was holding a wand to his head.
“What kind of sandwich?”
“Look who’s talking,” said Draco. “You look like you were sculpted by the Romans themselves.”
Narcissa’s features softened fractionally. “I did. I’m very sorry to hear about that, Harry.”
By the end of his speech, his heart was beating hard against his ribcage, threatening to escape.
yourself, Draco. You need help.”
Anyways, enough about me, here's what you all came for: the chapter :)
“I mean it with all my heart,” Draco lied again.
“He’s a piece of shit,” said Draco. “I shouldn’t still let him affect me like this.”
, five o’clock rolled around, and Draco began his closing duties. Once he was finished sweeping, he locked up and apparated home.
“Any good?” Draco exclaimed incredulously. “You just gave me the best orgasm of my life, and you’re asking me if it was
When they got to the Weasleys, Harry was swept up in a hug by Molly, and before any words could be said, she was also sweeping up Draco in a slightly smaller hug and saying something about “putting some meat on those bones.”
“N-Need to come, Harry,
“Do you have a pen and paper?” Harry asked. “I’ll write down the address.”
Harry rearranged them so that Draco was lying with his back to Harry’s chest. Draco sighed softly, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“You used his first name,” Harry said, in what sounded like awe. Draco flushed deeply, then, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted to bask in this moment like a turtle in the sun.
“Substances. Like marijuana, cocaine, LSD, or other drugs?”
“That wasn’t his fault,” Harry said hotly. “You have no idea how much pressure he was under.”
to you? What the hell was that? You’re so, so
“Harry,” said Draco, “I told you, I’m fine. Nothing to worry about.”
That was when Draco began to wonder how far Potter wanted to take this.
“How’d you even find the git, anyway?” Ron asked. “He dropped off the face after his trials.”
“We aren’t supposed to be seeing each other, Harry!” Draco exclaimed, causing the Gryffindor to flinch back. “My mother would have my head, not to mention it’s too early anyway. I’m still not over what you did. I need more time.”
“Mother-” He cut himself off with a strangled sound, keeping his arms fisted at his sides to prevent himself from reaching out for her. He didn’t deserve to touch her, not after everything he’d done.
Draco breathed in shakily, an unsuccessful attempt to settle his nerves.
And Harry kissed him.
“Just because we met when we were eleven does not mean you know me,” said Draco. “And if we’re being technical, it’s only seven years for us because the last time I saw you before you came into the shop was at my trial. Which I never properly thanked you for, by the way.”
“Right, your change. I’m sorry,” Draco said, flustered. He handed Potter the pile of Sickles.
“Draco,” said Harry gently, almost as if he were about to laugh. “You don’t have to speak so
“Then where is he?”
“Yeah,” he said, tone clipped.
“I don’t know why I’m so upset,” he breathed, eyes glistening with unshed tears. “He’s not even here yet. He doesn’t even exist, and it feels like I lost him.”
“Yes,” breathed Draco. “Come inside me, Harry. Want your come in me, want you to fill me up-”
Draco giggled, placing a hand over his mouth, shaking his head fondly. Potter was going to be the death of him.
“You’re absolutely ridiculous.”
Harry hadn’t meant for dinner, but he figured arguing the point with Draco was probably moot.
“I know.”
“You were hurt when I rejected you on the train. You sincerely wanted my friendship, you wanted someone your father hadn’t handed to you.”
, Draco reminded himself at the confused look on Potter’s face.
“You’re too pretty for your own damn good.” Harry murmured a spell, and next thing Draco knew a lubed finger swiftly and roughly entered him. He had come apart countless times on Harry’s fingers alone; just one had him panting and gripping the edges of the table for dear life. Harry knew just where to crook and piston so that Draco felt pleasure curl all through his abdomen.
fragile, he
“I know.”
“Draco?” he asked, walking through the small living room.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, walking over to the coat rack and plucking his pea coat from the hanger. “I understand.”
Harry hung his head, and, very much resembling a kicked puppy, rose from his chair and exited the room. Draco almost felt bad. Almost.
“I’m going to ask you a favor, Potter. And you don’t have to say yes, but I think
Harry was absolutely dumbstruck that she was fixating on the
“I’ll have one of the house elves fetch your coat, and then you can be on your way. I am very disappointed in you, Harry.” She was cold, detached, buried beneath her Malfoy mask. Like mother, like son.
“Well, you aren’t going to stay
“Are you unfamiliar with the parameters and guidelines of a proper conversation?” Potter asked, and Draco wasn’t entirely sure it was a joke. His hand continued to make the circles. Draco’s skin was surely sweating by now.
All too suddenly, he was being Apparated into Harry’s bedroom upstairs, and the door closed behind him. Harry threw him down on the bed and climbed on top of him, locking his lips with his and pinning both his thin, delicate wrists above his head. Draco was panting impossibly hard, and Harry hadn’t even
He was in a white room, on a pale, blue bed, and the overwhelming scent of sterilization pervaded his nostrils. Wait a minute . . .
“He’s sleeping right now, and probably will be for a while, since he’s on some pretty strong anesthesia. But you’re welcome to stay for as long as you need.”
“L-Likes would be a- You mean- You don’t mean-” Speaking was becoming a difficult task for Harry, who was finding it harder and harder to breathe.
Harry’s face softened, and he took a step closer to Draco. “That was nice of you, but why’d you think if you were running a successful apothecary that’s far cheaper than the one on Diagon that you’d never see me again?”
“I don’t,” said Harry.
“I make a difference in
“Oh, no, they absolutely
. “Good.”
Potter leaned in close to Draco, which nearly caused him to go into cardiac arrest, and pointed to an option on the menu. “That one.”
In addition to tossing Draco a wink, Harry placed his hands on his hips and stood up straighter, a pathetic attempt, really. But Draco truthfully didn’t have the heart.
Harry had to spend nearly thirty minutes consoling Draco on their way out the door that it was going to be okay, that he was forgiven by the Weasleys. He found Draco in the bathroom of Grimmauld, splashing water on his face, trembling violently, telling Harry profusely that he wasn’t going.
we were only shagging!” roared Harry.
name. “That’s . . . That’s beautiful,” he said, leaning in toward Potter, who did not back away. He was aware that their thighs were nearly brushing; he felt a heat pool in the pit of his gut, a thrill he hadn’t experienced in a long time. Not since before . . .
Mother paled considerably. “You . . . Do know about the baby. Don’t you?”
“No, Draco, that’s not it at all-”
“What about alcohol?”
“So you don’t want to marry Weasley?”
“My father and I don’t get along because . . . I’m gay, and he won’t accept that.”
A month ago, or two, Draco would have snapped in defense of his actions. But today, he only swallowed thickly and sighed remorsefully. “Yes, I did.”
Harry stepped closer, like a predator stalking its prey.
“Draco . . .”
tight.”
“Only if it’s you,” Harry responded without missing a beat, and Draco suppressed the urge to roll his eyes, because
When he got home, he cast a silencing charm and let out a scream.
But instead of looking annoyed, Potter only smiled softly at him and beckoned for Draco to join him under the umbrella. Draco did, and their sudden proximity was enough to send his stomach into somersaults. He stood almost close enough to Potter to touch.
“It dilutes the flavor too much.”
White-hot anger coursed through Draco. As usual, Harry had the uncanny ability to rouse multiple emotions simultaneously.
“Alright, Harry. I’m going to take that bath now,” Draco said, breathy and shrill, as he walked quickly over to his coat rack and handed Harry his coat. “It was good seeing you, as always, but-”
“My mother accepts me. But . . . She and my father . . . Don’t exactly have the healthiest relationship. He handles all the finances, or did, before he went to prison. She depends on him for everything, and it wouldn’t bode very well for her to go against his wishes.”
Harry had figured as much when Draco had agreed to let him in his head, but hearing the verbal affirmation from him made Harry’s heart sing with joy.
, and why was Potter telling him this? Did Potter trust him? There was no way Potter trusted him; they hadn’t even gotten to the main event of their meal. So why was Potter telling him all these things? Was it some sort of test? Was Draco passing?
The minutes blurred together until Harry heard a faint siren that grew louder and louder, and then people were knocking on Draco’s door, and Harry was letting them in with tears streaming down his face.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed. “It’s just . . . When you kiss me like that, it’s hard to remember that I’m still a real living, breathing person.”
“You are,” Draco agreed, because what else could he say?
The days here had been miserable so far. They slept with the hall lights on and the doors cracked, and every so often someone would peek their head in to make sure no one was trying to kill themselves. Because sheets were
“Before anything else can happen, you and my mother need to make up,” said Draco. Upon Harry’s serious look, he tacked on another sentence. “I’ll go with you, of course. I’d never make you face her anger alone. Not again, anyway, but I really can’t be held accountable for the first time.”
“I already apologized for that, Draco.”
Harry cleared his throat. “I told you that I care.”
“Of course,” said Harry kindly, letting go of him. “Take all the time you need.”
. “Do you like it much?”
Draco’s heart nearly stopped. All he’d ever wanted was Potter’s forgiveness. And now that he had it, it felt like a warm blanket was being draped over his aching, shivering heart.
“Then why did you take it back?” Draco asked, feeling like he wrenched the question out of himself like a sword in his side.
“Nice to see your astute observational skills haven’t dwindled over the months,” Draco drawled, strolling to the side and setting down his paperwork on the desk. “Isn’t it obvious? I work here.”
Draco’s vision was blurred with tears. His face scrunched up as he allowed them to fall, one by one. Potter’s horrified face swam into view.
Harry came with a high moan, come stuffing up Draco’s hole. Draco shuddered from the force of it, feeling the creamy, hot liquid inside him.
“Well, we went to the same, erm, boarding school. We were always at each other’s throats, and I harassed him a lot. I tried to make his life miserable and get him to notice me. I wanted him to regret not accepting my offer of friendship. After we graduated, we didn’t see each other for seven years until he wandered into Plot Knot to pick out a book for his god son. Then, for some reason, he kept coming back, and I kept recommending him books. We were very careful not to talk about anything related to our time in school or the w- our amicability. And I eventually confronted him about it. Then the motherfucker kissed me.”
“I never said you weren’t,” Harry told him gently.
“It’s okay,” Harry said again, opening the door. “You floo me when you’re ready to talk, yeah?”
Draco’s heart was about to explode.
“Sure.” Harry stood up, dusting off his pants. “I’ll be right over.”
. Your words, not mine. And now you want to break them all, and confuse me, and-”
