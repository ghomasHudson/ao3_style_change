“The first time I saw you fly in Quidditch, it was like watching a hawk,” Malfoy went on, his expression never changing. “You fly like you were born to.”
, he figured it was time to stop putting it off, and pressed at the hole gently. Malfoy didn’t tense, so Harry added enough pressure to pop through. Mesmerised, he watched his finger disappear. This was it. He was in Malfoy’s body.
Draco stared at her, wondering where George had met this lady. She was such a calm, steady presence—so unlike the chaos of their large family—that he couldn’t imagine the two of them even finding each other, let alone falling in love. But then, what did Draco know about love? Perhaps there was something to the old “opposites attract” adage after all.
Malfoy snorted and pulled away. His eyes were so red-rimmed they looked painful. “My parents,” he said scornfully, “have their heads so far up their arses, they haven’t even noticed there’s an epidemic.”
P.S. Are you sure you’re not high? George didn’t use you for a tester or something did he? I asked him, but I dunno… you’re running around France after
“Malfoy,” Harry attempts, his voice only cracking a little. He thinks it might be from hysteria. “Why did you drink from the shoe?”
“Children sulk,” Malfoy answered, before pointing out a trail and following it. “I simply have nothing to say to you.”
They heard a stifled sound of amazement and turned to see Ron and Hermione coming through the doors, an eager Rose tugging at her father’s hand.
He thought he heard a confused sound behind him, but he ignored it and kept his eyes straight ahead at the foyer doors until all he could see was the twinkling Christmas lights casting a soft glow into the night.
Draco swallowed. He could let it slide, do what everyone else did and avoid the difficult stuff. Or… he could ask. He could find out a little more about Potter and be one step closer to working out how to help him.
Several more bees arrived, and Harry realised distantly there were two different kinds of bee up here: one familiar, and one with white stripes on a black body.
There was a cricket somewhere on the roof. It sung loudly and with relish, unconcerned with the lack of response from any of its fellows.
“Say one nice thing about your partner—give them a compliment,” Harry read out. “Is this kindergarten?”
Granger cast a glance towards the door and worried her lip with her teeth. Finally, she turned back to him and leaned closer. Pansy and Weasley leant in unconsciously.
had reminded him of Potter. He could smell Potter’s shampoo on his bedsheets, feel his heavy presence lingering in the foyer—even Draco’s shirts reminded him of Potter because all he could think was the was the man reveled in peeling them away button by button.
“We need it to be believable,” Draco said slowly. “We’ve only just started attempting to be respectful around each other; we can’t jump straight into amorous behavior. People will just think we’re under a love potion.”
Finally, the shimmering green light settled over the box and Potter stepped back. For several moments, it sat in the centre of the circle, and neither of them dared to breathe until finally, with a little movement like a sigh, it sank into the wood and disappeared.
As far as Draco could tell, it seemed to be as much for actual balance as it was for intimidation, and to his absolute horror, it was working. Though, perhaps not in the manner that Potter intended.
,” Draco interrupted, pouring them both a hefty dram of scotch. “And neither do you, if that piss-poor suggestion is anything to go by. As if anyone is going to buy that the Saviour became a
The music shifted into something so cheerful it was obscene. Harry felt himself slipping away, his eyes unfocusing and his heart beat speeding up. His friends were all out on the dance floor—no one was around to see him, to bring him back. He turned, looking for an exit, a place to run.
“I guess,” he mumbled. “Look, if you’re not interested, you can forget I said anything. It’s not a big deal.”
Potter dropped down beside him, pulling the threadbare duvet over them, and Draco decided, fuck it, the bed could go right now.
Weasley was good. Fortunately, they had anticipated as much. Draco raised his eyebrows, pretending to be impressed.
There was no change in Potter’s features, no flash of emotion anywhere to be seen. His face had closed off, the walls creeping up brick by brick until there was nothing of the man Draco knew left on the surface. Potter was meant to be fire, fury, and justice. Only a moment ago, he had been just that, but now… There was no sign of it.
It took him some time, but eventually he recalled the Stevenses had Veela blood in their line back around the fourteenth century, and the Malfoys had been responsible for Roderick Stevens’ mental deterioration after the war. He called his pinboard in, his wand movements so sloppy he nearly took his own eye out, and marked a tally on the board between a line of red string and several photographs. The number of people Draco had wronged could not accurately be counted, of course, but Fate liked a round figure. By his calculations, one hundred was appropriate, and he had counted ninety-eight so far. Ninety-nine, including tonight. One more, and he would be free of his own curse, self-administered, painstakingly healed.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was strange, and Draco’s eyes snapped open to see a peacock feather floating between them.
“I keep thinking… it’s like Fate is guiding us. Like she’s always wanted us to be more than what we are, like she wants to see what we can do. Even now, it’s as if she wants me to forgive you for everything you’ve done.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, and he was so fixated on the look in Potter’s eyes that he nearly missed the moment he pulled off his trousers. Then, his brain caught up with him and realised what he hadn’t noticed in the dream-state.
Draco made a wounded sound and wanked madly until he, too, was coming in long spurts that seemed to pull all of the energy out of him. Afterwards, he slumped down on top of Harry, forehead pressed uncomfortably into the junction where his neck met his shoulder. There, he mouthed lazily at the skin of his throat, pressing sloppy kisses where he could reach as he caught his breath.
“Draco,” he muttered, voice raspy from disuse. Or from yelling. Draco wasn’t sure. “What are you doing here?”
The windows had been opened, filling the room not only with sunlight but with the sweet, heady scent of the honeysuckle that was planted in the bed below. His mother and Pansy were deep in discussion and only waved at him absently before turning back to their conversation. Draco caught a few words along the lines of fabric and swatches, and promptly tuned the rest out.
Potter followed Draco’s line of sight and froze. “That’s the curse,” he said quietly, and Draco nodded as though he had already figured it out.
It would take him less than three hours to pack up everything he owned here in France and return to England. Less than three hours to turn everything around and take that first, terrifying step into the unknown—acknowledging that there was something there between him and Potter. Acknowledging that it was worth pursuing. Knowing that their individual sanities and health were just as important.
“If you can’t erase the invasion, you can at least dilute it. Spread a few rumors. Give a ridiculous interview. Have a little fun with it.”
Draco grimaced at the memory. That night had been particularly awful. “Yes, yes, Potter, I remember. Are you going to get to the point any time soon, or do I check back in with you in thirty minutes?”
“I bet this was your idea,” he said savagely, then he sniffed, a familiar scent catching his attention. “Is that… is that chocolate? Potter, where the hell did you get chocolate from?”
? How was he so certain that the two of them, here, could make this work without killing each other?
They stared at each other for several seconds. Potter was the one to break the moment, draining his coffee mug and dropping it onto the table with a dull thud. “Your wand overcame its melancholy by drawing a second core to it, long before Hogwarts,” Potter said softly, his eyes darting to the kitchen window.
Potter looked up in surprise. “It’s all right,” he began, the words rolling off his tongue like a rote response. Then he sighed and set down his spoon. “It sucks.”
“It worked excellently,” Draco admitted. “They are convinced we’ve had a truly dreadful fight—our worst since Hogwarts—and that I’ve come chasing after you to soothe your poor, bruised ego.”
Because the curse hadn’t needed to make Draco love Potter, after all; it had only needed to make Draco remember him. Draco had done the rest.
Pansy gave a fake gasp and fluttered her hand over her chest. “How very un-Slytherin of you. Clearly, you’ve been spending too much time with this Gryffindor lunkhead.”
Draco let out a groan of frustration and sat up on his elbows so he could see Harry properly. He glared down at where they were joined—or tried to. His neck was straining with the effort, and he quickly changed the direction of his irritation to Harry. He’d slowly been losing his erection, and now lay half flaccid against his stomach. “What’s the problem?”
He waved his hand and cleared up the mess but left the glitter. He liked the way Draco looked with his cheekbones glistening and the hollow of his neck shining like diamonds.
But he held back, which was also nothing new. It hurt him like a physical ache somewhere in his chest, he wanted Draco so badly. But if anyone had asked him ‘is it difficult? Are you struggling?’ the answer would have been simple: no. Never.
Draco considered how different they were now, even to when they had met in the shop just the other day. Something had changed.
Draco found himself both surprised and grateful, and then surprised again once he acknowledged that Potter would have to have mentioned this
That’s when he understood. The memory of Potter taking his wand hadn’t been stirred up by the appearance of the man himself; it was a memory Potter dwelled on, a dream he dreamt. It made sense, given everything that had happened to his magic since the Elder Wand, but then, why return to the moment he had taken Draco’s? He knew, vaguely, that the event had been complicit in giving Potter the Elder Wand, but this felt… like something more.
They slipped back inside, into the warmth and comfort of the party. The guests were well and truly relaxed now, Pansy’s excellent catering and open bar doing their job well. By the time they’d made it back to Granger and Weasley, they each had a drink in their hands and several cocktail delicacies in their stomach.
The other three were stifling laughter across the other side of the table, which was precisely what he and Potter had been angling for. Now came the difficult part. Draco glanced above them, to where the hovering candles cast gentle light across the table. It made everyone look just that little bit ethereal, like they were one breath away from melting into the shadows. Places like this made a person feel like they were removed from time, like anything could happen. It was perfect.
“Nesting already, Potter?” Draco asked flatly as he stepped into the living room, forgetting for a moment that Potter didn’t know the nature of the curse that had hit him.
“Keeps me focused,” Potter said, grinning widely up at Draco before he slipped the pendant back into his shirt and stood up. “Did it work?”
There’s only one man Harry wants, and it’s not worth even imagining. Besides, if he ever called Draco ‘Dazza’, Harry is fairly certain Draco would hex his balls off.
“And hello to you too,” Draco sneered. “Don’t worry—I’m just browsing. No need to stretch your conversation skills.”
“Hey, Potter,” Malfoy said airily. “Why is it that the curse is targeting you? Do you think it knows you’re the useless one out of the two of us?”
Tears pricked his eyes, and when he looked up to meet Eleanor’s he saw a depth of empathy that he’d never found anywhere else. He took a deep breath and began to tell the full story.
“It’s not that.” He propped his elbows on the counter, green eyes fixed to Draco’s. “I’m just not the dating type. I thought that was obvious. I tried it a bit… after Ginny. But I mean, you’ve seen my exes.” He laughed. “It just doesn’t work out. I don’t think that kind of thing is meant for me.”
Draco laughed, the sound harsh and bitter. “Well if the curse is to be believed, it should be very easy to save us. You need to repay me for the wand you stole, and I need to accept your payment. If it’s that simple, why can’t we do it?”
“Hate crime,” the wolf said in Robards’ voice. “Muggle-born shopping for Hogwarts supplies. We were too late on the scene.”
“There’s nothing here.” He held up the book, rifling through the pages in case he’d written elsewhere.
Draco nodded. His fingers moved until he was sliding them lightly over his cock, and Harry found it hard to look away.
Weasley’s eyes widened. “I thought you’d never ask.” He spun Draco around by the shoulders and shoved him towards the stairs. “Right, third door on your left—there’s a supply closet. In that closet you’re going to find a wooden chest. It
Together, they reached up and tugged George down, out of the air, until he was lying passively on the ground. His eyes were shut, and Draco decided the force of the explosion must have already knocked him unconscious. While Morgan checked the rest of the shop, Draco ran his fingers across George’s neck and chest where the explosion had torn his shirt, searching for a tiny bump of metal. After a moment, he found it buried in the skin above his collar bone. He plucked it free and stood aside.
He turned back to see Pansy giggling. He sighed, selected a peanut from the bowl in front of Potter, and threw it at her.
When he put it like that, it all sounded pretty stupid. Childish, even, like something he might have read, not real life.
Movements slow from shock, Draco restored the glamour and shook his head. “Why do you keep holding back?” he asked, voice shaking, the question absolutely nonsensical to anyone who couldn’t see inside Draco’s head.
Draco blinked in surprise. They hadn’t discussed anything; as far as he knew, they were letting recent events settle in everyone’s minds before they tried anything new.
Slowly, Potter turned to face him. He blinked, like he’d only just realised Draco was here, and then his face changed. The vacant stare fell away and his face broke into a smile. If it wasn’t for the sweat and his sickly pallor, Draco would have thought he’d imagined the whole thing.
“What’s going on?” He laughed, cold and bitter and awful. “What’s going on is that I’ve never fucking won anything in my life, and you’re somehow all so fooled into thinking I’m a
Potter shook his head, and then in a gesture Draco found deeply unsettling, extended his hand to Sidealong them. At this point, Draco realised that while the hangover potion had indeed done its job and eliminated the hangover, it had done nothing to correct the fact that Potter was still drunk.
Potter shook his head. “Not yet.” He looked a little sheepish. “I’m thinking about something else at the moment. Did you know that the Ministry hears word about a potential Muggle-born within two years of birth?”
Potter’s eyes flashed, not just with anger. Blue fire flickered there, and Draco forced himself to play nice.
“Yeah, you’re probably right.” His brow furrowed, like he was trying to comprehend something that was just out of reach.
Pansy snorted, the rude noise at odds with her perfect composure. Draco had never known another person to wear heels with such grace. “Yes, I know how it goes. But you seem like something more is on your mind. You just look so tired lately.”
“Blaise,” she said simply. “And Draco, I’m answering your question. This is why I didn’t stop you—because I trust you. It’s your life to live, not mine, and who’s to say my decisions are worth anything? You did what you could, what you thought best. I worry about you. I care about you. But I’m not going to live your life for you.”
He thought this might have been the looming sensation he was trying to escape, the sense of something bearing down upon him. But now that it had hit… he found he could hold it after all. At least, like this, with someone holding him too.
Potter moved in a slow circle, examining the walls closely. “And we’re not going to remember any of this once we wake up?” he breathed, unmistakably awed despite the roughness to his tone.
Draco sipped experimentally after a few minutes, and then nodded. “If you’re drugging me, Potter,” he muttered, pausing as he tried to think of an adequate punishment. Eventually he shook his head and finished, “poor show.”
“I didn’t know he was Veela,” Potter snapped. “I only found that out after I saw him soaring through the bloody sky—not that he even told me then. You waited a good long while, didn’t you, Malfoy?”
Potter laughed, the sound filling Draco with a triumph that didn’t make sense. “Now you’re talking, Malfoy.”
Potter opened his eyes, and the storm of emotions were gone, leaving a horrible, blank emptiness in their wake. He drained his glass in a single gulp and wiped his mouth.
After a moment of silence, Malfoy stood up and walked back to the rest of the group. They’d missed their chance at being the first now, and the groups were already peeling off to go search for the various components they needed to complete their summer courses.
“Perhaps they thought you might want to eat your hot chocolate instead of drinking it,” she remarked thoughtfully.
They stared at one another, the flickering fluorescent lights of the hospital room giving everything a surreal sensation that Draco couldn’t seem to shake. It was like watching something from under water, or coming off a sedative after surgery. He ached to reach for Potter, to climb into the bed with him and just hold him, but he couldn’t. They didn’t have that sort of relationship.
His eyes snapped open, and with the careful, deliberate grace of the utterly smashed, he set the Firewhiskey down on the coffee table, out of reach. Even in his imagination, he ought to know better. That wasn’t how this scene with Potter would go. No, because Potter was convinced that Draco was an arsehole. He was certain that despite all the painful lessons of Draco’s youth, the fact that he was blunt and snide meant that Draco hadn’t learned a goddamn thing, that he was still the idiotic sixteen-year-old eager for his Father’s approval. And yes, all right, perhaps his sense of humor was a little sharp, and maybe he sometimes took a joke too far, but that was just
Harry had no idea what he was talking about, but the sheer exasperation in Malfoy’s tone—along with the faint but undeniable lack of vitriol—somehow made him smile, despite his best efforts.
If they kept going like this, it was going to be over too quickly. Draco was more than up for multiple rounds, but he wanted to draw this out—to keep Potter on the edge as long as possible. He pushed backwards and let his hands fall to the top of Potter’s knees, resting them there as he slid down and settled himself between Potter’s thighs.
“The mystery unravels, but it’s still just as useless as words,” Draco muttered, closing his eyes and waiting for death.
Harry nodded, kneeling beside the copper dial and studying the symbols. “And a hex we can trace because we know the intention.”
“She isn’t doing this out of malice,” Harry breathed, leaning into the arm that hooked around his waist. “She’s just afraid.”
“No, I don’t. All I know is that someone owled me a timed curse, and it wasn’t you. Everything else is uncertain, and I want to know who’s behind it.”
Somewhere in the last few weeks everything had shifted. Their game hadn’t changed, but the stakes had skyrocketed. Since Potter didn’t seem to even acknowledge that, Draco was playing for both of them.
“When he came to me with this plan to win that drunk bet, I thought it was just a lark. Something stupid to fill in the time, and I’ll admit, it was nice to think of spending a little time with Potter for once. We never really did get to know each other after the war. But now that I’ve spent time with him, I’m seeing things that…”
is to make it think you’re a part of it rather than some interloper. It can turn nasty if it realises you’re there and you don’t have an anchor with you to make sure the curse doesn’t—” he paused, and then finished lamely, “eat you.”
Potter had the grace to look apologetic. “Right. Of course. Forgot how you were raised for a second there. Well, yeah, they tend to jump to demonic possession and other things. But there are only rare cases that a flagged Muggle-born turns out not to possess magic, and even then it’s quite likely they have a small strain of it even if it isn’t enough for Hogwarts.”
Harry loves lasagne, and he loves Wednesdays because that’s when he gets to cook it. He’s not sure if it’s the fact that it’s such a simple dish—something the Dursleys never allowed him to cook because it was messy—and so it feels almost like a rebellion. Maybe it’s just because he likes cheese. Or, maybe it’s because of the look on Draco’s face when he sits down, glass of red wine in hand, and tries to not to smile at the plate in front of him.
Another mum came to stand beside them. “Are your kids on the field today?” she asked, rubbing her hands together to warm them and glancing over at them. “My Ben couldn’t make it today, but he insisted I come along to make sure they hadn’t started the new fixture without him.”
So, Potter truly didn’t know that Draco was the Veela he’d pissed off—or rather, the Veela with whom he would have to make amends. Since Draco was not in the habit of lining his house with peacock feathers, Potter’s method was also unlikely to work.
The next thing he knows, something light touches his wrists and ankles. He laughs for a moment, wondering if Draco has decided to explore something with feathers—he wouldn’t mind that at all—and then the thing draws tight, and his whole body goes stiff.
“Even though I’ve probably done better on my own, I... I liked it.” Malfoy continued in a small voice, and Harry’s eyes flew open. Malfoy looked both nervous and overwhelmed. Harry’s arms felt almost like jelly.
“Don’t worry about the anchor,” Potter growled, shoving Draco’s hands aside and undoing Draco’s fly in one smooth movement.
“Well, this is professional,” Draco muttered, steadying himself against the desk in the back room of the shop.
Harry shook his head. “They’ve hardly seen me at all, even when we’re fucking,” he confessed, thinking of dark rooms and blurry, drunken hook ups.
He moved lower, tasting Harry’s skin and pulling gently at each new centimeter of fabric, the buttons popping away one by one beneath his mouth. He stopped halfway, drifting back up to drag his lips across Harry’s nipple, making him squirm and breathe louder still, before returning to his task.
Malfoy nodded and tentatively reached up to brush Harry’s hair out of his eyes. The gesture seemed instinctive, and his eyes widened a little as he did, like he had surprised himself with the action. His eyes fell to Harry’s lips, and Harry leaned forward, carefully, hesitantly, until their mouths were barely touching again. Malfoy tasted like chocolate and citrus, like he’d just eaten a chocolate orange. Without even thinking about it, Harry deepened the kiss just to taste him more.
! What in Merlin’s fucking name are you talking about, losing battles? You win! You always win! That’s your thing, Potter. What the hell is going on?”
“Don’t let the door hit you on your way out,” Draco murmured, crosschecking one of his notes against the open ledger on his desk.
As he considered the familiar checklists, Draco began to wonder, with an air of sickened dread, if he should whip out the old symptom-tracker journals once more.
“How do you propose we do that?” Draco asked slowly, wondering if Potter’s thoughts could possibly have taken the same turn that his had been obsessing over ever since the other night.
On the plus side, their investigations allowed Malfoy to develop a potion that would allow the infected to pass from their frozen state into an ordinary spell sleep. But they couldn't yet wake up. On the other hand, prodding at the hex and the hexer like they had meant a whole new spate of infections popped up across Scotland, and Harry wasn’t sure how much more he could take.
Blaise raised one eyebrow. “Certainly not a Slytherin.” Then, he pulled a thoughtful face. “Or possibly the most Slytherin of us all.”
A tall man with eyes a strange, deep red appeared to take their coats, and they handed them over without a word. Then, they were ushered towards two enormous double doors and into the wedding hall.
“I shouldn’t have left you to deal with them alone,” he says, forcing himself to look Draco in the eye.
The words echoed in the empty room, surrounding Draco and filling him with a sense of inevitability.
It took Draco a few seconds, but when he finally managed to recognise the heat in Potter’s eyes for what it was, his blood ran cold.
Dressing gown clutched around his thin frame, Draco had tugged open the Sanctuary’s front door at midnight—equal parts concerned and infuriated by the incessant knocking—and found the Saviour of the Wizarding World slumped against the doorframe. He shook his head, the remnants of a strange dream fading rapidly away, along with the repeated words
Harry sipped his drink and tried not to smile. It was the first time Draco had seen his flat, and Harry was suddenly pleased with the careful choices he’d made when decorating the place. He hadn’t done it for the prestige of owning something bespoke; he’d done it because of the enjoyment he got out of supporting local artisans—wizard and muggle alike. Every time he looked at the coffee table or the ceramic bowl on top of it, he’d think of the people who made them, their lives, their stories.
“I have to go,” she said, and it was like listening to an icy stream pouring down the side of a mountain.
“You were telling me you were trying to heal the families you’d hurt, and I told you it wasn’t enough, and whether it is or isn’t that doesn’t matter because you’re trying.”
Malfoy continued to stare at him. It should probably be awkward, but Harry couldn't find it in him to care. Finally, Malfoy said, “What the fuck happened to you, Potter?”
And then, suddenly, he’s there. The city of the Gold Coast lives up to its name; it’s golden and busy and full of bustling crowds in a way that is subtly different to anything he’s used to. He’s surrounded by tanned skin and people walking the streets in bikinis. The barbecues across the road from the beach are sizzling away with sausages, punctuated by the crisp sound of cider caps being popped no more than two feet away from a No Alcohol sign.
As it happened, she arranged an extra session in her schedule to see him the next day. When he woke up to her ferret Patronus skittering about the living room, he’d just about cried from relief. He hadn’t known how much he was holding onto until that moment.
When he got home that night, he had barely shut the door before he unzipped his jeans and slid his hand into his pants, leaning back against the wall of the corridor and jerking himself off in quick, rough movements until he was coming all over his sweat-soaked shirt. It wasn’t the first time he had thought of blond hair and grey eyes while he did it, but it was the first time he had allowed himself to imagine the eyes looking back.
On his way over the balcony, Harry had somehow grabbed one of the books the women were waving at them. He has a vague recollection of snatching it so she’d stop hitting Draco with it, but he can’t be sure because most of the last twenty minutes is already a blur.
“I’m going to leave now,” he said, trying to ignore the way Potter seemed more distant than before. “We’ll keep working the day after tomorrow, unless you have any objections?”
A noise by the doorway made him look up. He nearly spilled his coffee when he realised the nurse was standing there. He lurched to his feet and stumbled forward.
“Feels good,” Malfoy told him. His head was to the side, the long column of his neck exposed. He’d stopped stroking his prick vigorously in favour of shorter, more languorous pulls that were in time with Harry’s fingers moving in and out.
“I can’t take back the hurt I caused,” Draco said with his back turned. “But I would. I need you to know I would.”
“So, everyone else is going to be stuck out on the grounds all day,” Draco said, breathless, when they broke apart. “Perhaps we could take advantage of our unexpected privacy and try something new?”
Harry wondered if there was a great big sign painted on his forehead. “Yeah,” he said, then filled his mouth with three forkfuls of food so he didn’t have to answer anymore questions.
He was still shaken up that George Weasley had personally requested his services. It felt… somehow momentous. Before today, if anyone had asked him whether he cared what any Weasley thought of him, he would have politely suggested they get a Healer to assess them for spell damage. But here he was; colour him surprised to discover just how much he didn’t want to screw it up.
They stayed there for long moments, their breath a visible white mist that mingled together. Draco turned his head, reaching for Potter’s mouth with his own until they were kissing again, languid and slow.
They Apparated back to Draco’s to get ready for the pub, taking their time with languid kisses and conversation. By the time they were ready, the light had almost faded. Potter’s eyes glittered in the lamplight, bright with affection and simmering heat.
“Or twice. Maybe several times. At Hogwarts.” Draco could hear the rough desire in his own voice, and, beneath it, he could hear something warmer, something softer. “We’d just had that fight on the Quidditch pitch.”
Potter nodded, and they Disapparated. That must be how they were playing it—Potter’s been promoted in the Auror team. Less fieldwork, higher duties. No one needs to know. Surely, he had to understand that word would get out. Word already
“How did it go?” Draco asked as Harry handed him a pile of shrunken brooms and moved past towards the storage lockers.
“You think I broke us out of an important trance, two hours early, because I forgot a pen.” Draco couldn’t believe it.
Malfoy sneered at him, pale face drawing tight and turning, if it was possible, even whiter than Harry remembered it being.
Slowly, Harry tuned back into his surroundings and realised he had been staring at his hands for a very long time. The air was oddly silent, like even the birds had left for a while. He could almost hear the scratching of Malfoy’s quill as he worked all the way at the other end of the corridor.
He heard a choked sob and opened his eyes to see Potter staring down at a ghostly image of Draco’s own prone body—he looked so young, lying there—covered in blood on the bathroom floor. The guilt and regret of a teenager looked strange on an adult’s face, but just as Draco’s shame and hurt still lingered, he knew that Potter’s would never be far from the surface either. Even after all these years, that pain was raw.
Malfoy’s words hung in the air. It sounded so strange, hearing it from his mouth, in his aristocratic tones. It was so matter of fact—so straightforward—that for a second Harry thought he’d misheard. When he realised he hadn’t, a shiver ran through him and he reached the sudden and unexpected understanding that he liked it, possibly more than he would have if Malfoy had said it in a way that was dirty or loaded with meaning. There was just something about the way Malfoy looked when he said it—a little bit flushed and unsure, but committed to being open and honest despite his reservations. It made Harry feel close to him, in a weird sort of way.
But he shook his head. “I have the animals,” he said, forcing himself to laugh. “They’re more valuable than you realise.”
Flashes of memory burst into Draco’s mind, contrasting his image of Potter as he used to be and the Potter he’d come to know in the last week. It was true that Potter had always been a little reserved, a little less likely to lose himself in drink and laughter on their pub nights and more likely to watch the door and Apparate them home. It was equally true that Potter had seemed… different, this last week. He’d been quick to smile with Draco, full of wit that Draco had never seen before.
“Easy,” Potter repeated, creeping his hands slowly above his head but remaining on his knees. It soothed Draco, somehow, seeing him like that. Knowing he wasn’t about to run. “This is your house. We’ll work this out together.”
So Potter had messed with a Veela, had he? That was the only plausible answer. Veela mating rituals could occur naturally, of course, but for that to happen one needed to have been courted by a Veela. And Draco for damn sure hadn’t courted the Boy Who Lived.
“I won’t disturb you.” Draco lifted his hand in farewell, but George made a noise of protest, and Morgan reached out to grasp his hand.
Something inside Draco snapped. “Is it so much of a hardship to save me from that awful place?” He pushed open the gate to the chicken garden and strode towards the coop to let them out.
“I mentioned something similar to Robards, once. Not the security spells, but I wanted to provide a detail for a family on their first journey to Hogwarts. Nothing too flash—just an Auror accompaniment to Platform 9 ¾.  Their son had been threatened by pure-bloods in the neighborhood for years, and the mother was terrified of sending him off on his own.” His eyes hardened. “Robards went on for a full thirty minutes about how it wasn’t the Ministry’s place to interfere with schoolyard bullying. He kept saying how it wasn’t sending the right message and that it was a waste of funding. I tried to explain that it had nothing to do with the kids—it was about sending a message to the parents, so that they knew the Ministry wasn’t turning a blind eye to old prejudices. But he didn’t get it.”
Norman, it appeared, was a large mop with a fiery orange head, leaning upside down against the back wall with a bow tie stuck halfway up the handle.
“Would you like to come for a walk with me?” Draco asked, because there was every chance they would both die soon and it seemed a wasted opportunity to not at least attempt to make Potter step in chicken dung.
When he looked up, he noticed Potter staring at him with wide eyes. The bizarre thought occurred to him that, for all their shared glances, Potter had never truly looked at him before, and now he was, and Draco didn’t know what to do about it.
And therein lay the most malicious part of the curse: the fact that it relied on the unparalleled heights of a wounded mate’s fury and creative malice to ensure its justice. The curse was more than an execution; it was a vindictive, calculated slaughter. Veela needed very little justification to go to war on behalf of their blood. However, because they were above all else creatures of fate and family, the mating bond should also be taken seriously. The curse had to first connect them so wholly, so completely, that the inevitable destruction of the offending human would become a blow that rippled through the entire community. A tragedy. A lesson in tradition and honour and the lengths to which one should go to defend those.
For a second, he thought there might be something there—a question, a plea. But he didn’t speak Gryffindor and he was far too tired for this shit any longer. Besides, it was late and he was probably imagining it.
“It doesn’t make sense,” Draco spat. “You’ve never liked any of this—the Ministry, secrets, gossip. It’s not
Draco laughed, remembering the punch from third year with no small amount of discomfort. “Well, shall we return to the party?”
Harry stared at Malfoy, watching the way he gazed down at the city with distant interest. The dullness was still there, and Harry wondered if it was a mask—a careful shutter that hid something far more painful.
“Are you sure these hoops are low enough?” Draco asked, looking at the highest hoop which stood at eye level.
Granger looked up with an indignant frown, but the moment she laid eyes on Draco her expression softened. She put down her parchment and smiled at him.
“Yeah,” Potter agreed, smirking a little even though his cheeks were still pink. “We should try it some time.”
“Okay,” he exhaled deeply, steadying his nerves and allowing Malfoy to pull him away from the desk and toward the bed. Just as he’d said, there were three vials full of lube lying on the comforter. They glinted under the dimmed lights as Harry approached, and he swallowed.
in his expression holding Draco captive. With a start, Draco realised there was something warm and wet on his chest, and he looked down just as Harry dropped his head and began to lick the chocolate away with slow, teasing kisses.
“And ruin their fun?” Draco shook his head. “Not yet. Maybe I’ll add a weak spot for them near the hydrangeas.” He frowned. “I don’t think I have any hydrangeas.”
Potter’s eyes closed and he hummed in pleasure. “I’m flexible.” His voice was already rough with desire.
The walls flickered black, and suddenly they were standing on a hill. It was the kind of night that was icy quiet, and as Draco’s eyes adjusted, the dark shapes of the giant rocks emerged. Morgan and Kalen walked slowly forward into the circle of stones, their faces upturned to the moon and their eyes reflecting midnight. Draco felt a chill run up his spine, and George staggered backwards, a hint of fear in his expression. Before now, Draco wasn’t sure he had truly believed Morgan and Kalen were half-fae, but he believed it now.
“Well, she’s gone and made you my soulmate,” Draco said flatly as he pushed away from the sink and walked towards the bathroom. “So I’d say take it up with her, but it looks like you’re in agreement—she wants to punish me for eternity, as well.”
Draco had almost forgotten what they were talking about, and then he registered the strange tone to Potter’s voice. When he looked up, Potter wouldn’t meet his eye, an odd sheepishness there that didn’t match Draco’s maudlin thoughts.
Then, it was a mad rush of everyone talking at once, getting in each other’s way, insisting they be the first to see him. Draco fell back, having no desire to see Weasley at all, and wanting only to speak to the nurse. After a moment, it was determined that Molly, Arthur, and Granger would be the first, and then, if he was up to it, the others would file in two at a time.
which he wanted to purchase simply to watch his mother twitch. They had to be talking about Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. He couldn’t imagine any other place that was cashing in on the idea of the Giant Squid as a marketing ploy.
“Yeah.” Harry chokes a little as he tries to speak, his chest heaving against Draco’s palm as he coughs. “Yeah of course it’s bloody all right.”
Potter lifted one shoulder in a shrug—an echo of the same moment earlier in the night. Except, now it was different, a little more exposed, a little less for show. Draco wondered where all the confidence he’d always associated with Potter had gone, because he knew now that it had.
Potter side-stepped out of the way and spun around so that he was walking backwards into the store, just so that he could keep looking at Draco while they argued.
Malfoy turned back completely and came to stand in front of him, so close he could feel warm breath ghosting across his cheek.
“I think Hannah might have gone home with a bit of gossip, tonight,” Potter said with a grin, and it was like the previous conversation had never happened.
“One thing I don’t understand,” he said slowly, “is why you even acceded the bet in the first place? It was clear we weren’t in a healthy or mature relationship at all, even if it was at least obvious we were fucking.”
“See you on the other side, Potter,” he said, his lips twisting bitterly as their eyes caught and held.
Potter’s eyes darkened, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. “I’ll see you soon,” he murmured then disappeared.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Because I thought it’d be a fun activity. I need it to stop the curse, you git.”
In the quiet of his apartment that night, he felt a lingering sadness at the thought of Potter all alone across the sea. He hoped Potter chose to listen to him, to seek help, but he also knew that it could take years. It had taken Draco himself this long to be ready, willing, and able, and he’d started with a desperate need to feel anything different to how he always felt. It hadn’t been enough, and he wasn’t sure that Potter even had that.
Draco pressed his lips together. He didn’t want to tell them that Potter had laughed it off, since the entire purpose of the exchange was that they imagined that he and Potter had bonded.
Potter paused, looking faintly impressed. “I suppose.” Then, he lifted a finger. “But what if he wasn’t? Half the lesson was just copying his notes off the board; why couldn’t he just write the same notes on the board as he wrote in his textbook?”
A noise came from outside the window. Harry glanced through the gap in the curtains, a slow smile spreading across his face.
Weeks turned into months, and they slowly built up the friendship they’d never allowed themselves to have. At first, Draco had thought he didn’t need to. He already knew he was in love with Potter—what else was he supposed to learn from this exercise? It was for Potter, really. For Potter to learn how to reach out to others, how to make meaningful connections. For Potter to learn if he could love Draco.
“You’re insufferable. Why did I think this was a good idea?” Malfoy groaned. He got up, apparently unselfconscious of his nudity, and frowned at the mess they’d made of themselves and the bed. He fished for his wand in the bunch of his pants. “I hope you’re decent at cleaning charms, Potter. I won’t clean up after you every time.”
He’d fantasised about what it would be like to be inside somebody before. He’d even fantasised about being inside Draco once he’d known that was on the table. Once they’d started experimenting with fingering and rimming, he’d thought he had a fairly decent idea what the experience was like, but he’d been wrong.
“Two years. They signed Hedley for seeker and Fayose and Carilo for beaters,” Harry said distractedly, thoughts whizzing through his head at a million miles an hour. He hadn’t thought it was common knowledge; Ron seemed surprised if not disappointed he wasn’t rooting for
So, I haven’t left France yet, but don’t worry, I’m not going to harass you or anything. I just wanted to send you a letter. As in, for me. I wanted to send you a letter for me. Not for you. I’m not making sense.
Weasley smacked his forehead. “Right. I forgot I sent her there for the tea towels. I left them at the office. Shit.” He hurried away towards the fire and stuck his head in, yelling for his sister.
Malfoy was here, and that was what mattered. It was as though Harry was warm again for the first time in months.
He fell back against the couch and closed his eyes. Unbidden, his thoughts turned to Potter and what it would be like if he was here with him. He imagined Potter staring at him from across the pile of presents, eyes bright and cheeks flushed from the wine. He pictured sending tiny pieces of tape flying across the room, sticking themselves to Potter while he spun in a circle trying to pull them off.
Her face broke into a smile, though her forehead was still creased with nerves. “Oh that’s lovely. He does such a wonderful job. My friend has been raving about him for weeks, but she couldn’t come today. Her kids have all got the flu and she’s racing around trying to make enough vegetable soup for the lot of them.” She let out a high-pitched laugh and then shut her mouth quickly, as if worried she was too loud.
He knew they hadn’t exactly come across like they were falling in love with each other; the ruse was off to a terrible start.
For some reason, its progression had slowed. He watched one single grain fall, fall, fall, still inches from the bottom, with two more poised above it waiting for their turn. It was as though the curse wanted to give them a chance, which was absurd, because the curse should have wanted to kill them.
Harry can’t quite manage a response, but he does succeed in dragging Draco free from the circle while the lads cheer and another man refills the shoe and takes his place.
” She grabbed his chin and spun his face so that he was looking at her, but his eyes remained fixed and unseeing.
“Have to know what you’re agreeing to first, right?” He didn’t look offended; his eyes were crinkled with amusement.
“I dream about you,” Potter said so suddenly, Draco choked on his own spit. “I dream about you, and when I dreamed too many times to take it anymore, I changed the dream, and it changed the future.”
“Yes, and you complained the entire time you were getting ready,” Granger said, failing to hold back another laugh.
Granger frowned and leant forward on the desk. Her long, bushy hair fell into her face, but she didn’t seem to even notice. Draco had no question that he’d already had her full attention, but he suddenly felt like he now had her scrutiny.
“Did you know that Hermione would go spare if she had any idea that you knew something about me that she didn’t?”
“Because I didn’t repay my debt fast enough,” he said, wriggling his shoulders to see if wings came out. They didn’t—not yet.
Draco took a sip and closed his eyes in bliss at the first taste. It was a rich vegetable soup, full of flavour and a sharp tang of spice that he couldn’t name. He arranged his napkin and set to it, trying not to look like he was as starving as he suddenly felt.
Harry pulled him close and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Yep. Did you want to take the wards down?”
The dream whirled strangely around him, and he could feel the rage mounting beneath his skin. The curse sensed its end approaching, the Veela in him scenting the proverbial blood on the wind, because if this was no execution curse it was a redemption curse. For both of them. Perhaps the curse didn’t always bind the transgressor to the Veela they had wronged, but in this case, there was no one who could fit the role more appropriately than Draco. Potter wanted to forgive him, Fate or no Fate, and Draco wanted to forgive Potter for leaving him there. They both held that power, and if one of them would not see then it would destroy them both.
He frowned, staring at the shadows from his ceiling lamp and trying to latch onto the thought that kept eluding him. What was it about those words that bothered Draco so much? Potter had just seemed so certain. Not even concerned or upset—just matter-of-fact. He attracted creeps; that was that.
“Maybe because they were never really yours, not like all of your animals together are,” Harry suggested, and then he reached out and took the feather from the air. Light bounced off the radiant colours, reflecting in ways that spoke of magic rather than physics, and Harry said, “These are the last two birds for your Sanctuary, aren’t they? Your flock have all come home now?”
His honesty drew forth a strange hitch of breath from Potter, and the judgement, bizarrely, disappeared.
He warred with the idea of just ignoring it, of pretending he hadn’t noticed and waiting to see if anything came of it without his interference, but he’d had enough of letting everyone else lead him around. He wanted an answer.
Draco held up his hands to remind Potter that he, at least, was the picture of innocence. For once, they were in this together.
At the desk, Malfoy released a little sigh. His shoulders were hunched almost imperceptibly, and he started to turn away. Harry could tell that if he didn’t say something right now, all progress they’d made toward trusting each other and building… building whatever
marshmallows,” Percy muttered, while Ginny covered her mouth with her hand and nodded very seriously. “Who puts five marshmallows in
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, grow up. If you want to take down a system, you have to be prepared to work it from the inside.”
It was only after the morning sun was well above his kitchen window that Draco realised Potter hadn’t shown any sign of knowing Draco was part Veela at all.
in front of all their peers. It left Harry feeling weirdly uncomfortable and wrongfooted to hear the complete lack of malice in Malfoy’s voice.
“There was an article in the Prophet, and it said we were in a slump, that you were getting bored. I know it's stupid, but the way it was written felt like if it wasn't true now it could be someday and before I knew it I just kept reading those blasted articles and it took me to a bad place. I thought... I thought I was past that and I let my insecurity almost ruin us... I let it make me think I needed to fix us when we were perfect as we were, and I am so fucking sorry, Harry.”
He made a note of the booking time—8pm, well after her last appointment—and left the apartment in search of food and clothing.
“They’re too busy trying to justify to their kids why they can’t buy the new Cleansweep Jr,” Harry murmured, crossing the room and drawing Draco close.
Harry exhaled sharply, annoyed with the way Ron was just expecting Malfoy to have an ulterior motive, and the implicit assumption that Harry would have gone along with it like they hadn’t spent most of their lives bickering and being nasty to one another. If anyone was qualified to understand how vile Malfoy had been in the past, it was Harry.
unknown. He staggered to his feet and almost ran to the fireplace. Pinching a handful of Floo powder, he threw it in and called out Potter’s address, resolutely ignoring the fact that before today they hadn’t even been on friendly speaking terms, and now he was making house calls.
“Potter,” he said softly, carefully. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve seen plenty of them. They really do help.”
Draco hovered awkwardly by the foot of the bed. He wanted to reach out, to clasp Potter’s face between his hands and reassure him that it would be all right. But how did he know that? For all he knew, it wouldn’t be.
Draco couldn’t decide if the move had been intentional or not. Then, he processed what Weasley had said and shuffled awkwardly sideways across the bench seat until he and Potter were pressed together from shoulder to hip, staring down at the offending article in horror.
Had the curse always known it would hurt Draco more than Potter? Was that the bitter twist of irony sealing his final debt to Fate? Soulmates or not, Potter would never want him after this, and even when they finally managed to fix the curse, Draco would have to live with the knowledge that he had never wanted anything more than this cryptic, golden-hearted, puzzle of a man. Alone.
The air froze, dreamlike and wispy as it caressed Draco’s face and then fled the clearing. Potter stared at him, face slack with shock, and Draco struggled to breathe.
Potter was an Unspeakable these days; who knew what nasty thing he’d become embroiled in? And what Draco had to do with it.
He looked down just at the moment that Harry’s eyes opened again, looking up and searching Draco’s face. He smirked, his mouth still full of Draco’s cock, and sight of that wicked grin sent Draco soaring over the edge.
Long, long moments passed. All Draco could hear were the excited whispers of the people around them, the faint whimper from Granger when she could no longer hold it in, the steady tap of Pansy’s nails against the table. It was excruciating.
Harry raised his eyebrows, taking in the magenta backing and the fifty hoola-hooping Santa Claus that he could see just from that small strip alone.
Potter laughed bitterly. The remains of the mystery fell into place, and Draco decided he probably no longer had to wonder why Potter was all sharp edges and hollow stares, these days.
each other—at the Manor, in the Fiendfyre, at the trials. Now. Because you know we’ll somehow save each other now, too.”
“Professor,” he said, forcing his mouth into something like a smile as Professor McGonagall rose from her seat and crossed the almost empty hall to meet him. It wasn’t as difficult as he expected; at the sight of her, a spark of the nostalgia he had hoped for ignited.
Still, it was horribly annoying to discover that he was becoming less distracted by Potter’s uniquely wild form of attractiveness, and more distracted by… well… him, just him. It was disgusting, and Draco tried to push it from his mind.
“Even if your dream comes true?” There was amusement in Weasley’s manner now, and rising confusion in Draco’s own. “I know it’s come back. I can hear it in your voice.”
His last thought before he fell asleep was that there was no use hiding from himself any longer. Pansy had tried to get him to admit to it, but he’d only run away like the coward he was. But he couldn’t run anymore; even his own body was betraying him. It was time to accept what he had tried to deny, perhaps for years.
Oddly, Draco found himself wishing Potter would confide in him. The confusing mess of animosity and competition that had always stood between them began to melt away, leaving behind something familiar. It was like he was eleven again, sitting at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall at breakfast, head still foggy with sleep. The hospital walls faded, and once again he was staring across at the vibrant, laughing, messy-haired boy with a longing that could only exist in those moments between sleep and awake when he couldn’t quite remember his father’s expectations and the pressure of the indefinable role he was expected to play.
The elf blinked, and with a sharp crack the bed disappeared. There was a brief moment where it felt like they were falling, and then there was another crack, and Draco sighed in relief at the familiar feeling of Egyptian cotton.
“It’s just a bit strange.” She tilted her head to the side. “I’d think you were trying to convince me you cared about Harry so you could win that bet, but this would just be such a strange way to do it. I’m puzzled.”
Potter’s eyebrows shot up, incredulous. “You think I want to stay here with you? The curse is keeping me here!”
“Seriously though,” Potter said, shoving a large tome aside and glaring at Draco. “I think we really do need to improve your wards.”
Draco stared at his reflection. He’d arranged to meet Potter, but an owl had come from Pansy asking them all to meet her at work. She’d probably been given a promotion, or otherwise was attempting to rope them into free labor, but either way he needed to make sure he was dressed to impress. Pansy was vicious about who she allowed near her work and in what state. She’d once set security on Theo for stepping foot in the building while wearing flip flops.
“So, this was entirely a ruse to make them think we’re bonding,” Potter said, taking a large gulp of tea and sighing with satisfaction.
“That wasn’t me,” Potter said in an odd voice. “That was the version of me you conjured in your head. I was… floating around. I work with dreamscapes, Malfoy. Of course I can recognise one and remember it.” He cast him a sideways glance. “When were you going to tell me you were the Veela?”
Potter snorted. “Just last week we had a case where a half-blood shopkeeper was targeted. His whole shop was destroyed, horrible messages painted on the walls, family threatened… the works. Do you know what the Ministry did?”
They set off down the path, bees buzzing around their heads as the garden flourished into spring. Hydrangeas bloomed along the wire garden dividers, and daisies sprouted amongst the stones of the path beneath their feet, defiant as they speckled the property with the least pure-blood flower Draco could imagine. He loved tending to the orchids, but daisies were his favourite.
Draco wasn’t even bothered by the sound of carolling in the distance, though he had grown up in a household that found street choirs awfully pedestrian. As a child, he had secretly loved the carollers that went from door to door, and he used to find any excuse to linger by them when they came to Diagon Alley. Looking back and remembering the fond smile his mother would give him as he stopped to tie his shoelace or point into a conveniently-placed shop window, he had a feeling he possibly hadn’t been as discrete as he’d attempted.
The fire flared green as the parchment disappeared. After a moment, it flared again and a new ball of parchment shot out onto the heart. Draco kneeled forward to grab it.
Draco eyed the package, taking in the way it pulsed softly in the light. Hellfire curses didn’t pulse; only transfiguration or ignition curses had enough residual power to hum like that, and they didn’t explode. It didn’t make sense.
He almost didn’t care about what Ron and Hermione had to say after that, staring slack-jawed at Malfoy. The hand at his back pressed in in what might have been a comforting squeeze. Harry’s jaw closed with a clack, and he was taken over by a savage grin.
“What was the prophecy? Was it the one I heard in the dream?” Potter nodded, and there was something in his features, something that made Draco’s blood run cold as he realised the rest. “What line did you change?” he asked, even though he already knew. It was the line he had dreamed of, the night Potter first appeared and this whole mess began.
“I may as well just hand him a bloody mirror and be done with it, for all he’s going to care about these,” he snarled, tossing the parcel onto the pre-cut piece of wrapping paper he’d selected—lime green with tiny cherubs fluttering across every square of space. He affected a preposterous tone, pushing aside the growing realisation that he was far drunker than he meant to be. “Why, thank you, Draco. I don’t believe you’ve ever bought me a meaningless accessory before. How very kind and thoughtful of you. You must think so highly of my intelligence.”
A face came into view—worried eyes and a fierce black bob. Pansy reached out and smoothed the lines of his cheek with her fingers.
He looked up, and his eyes met Potter’s. They were just as blood shot as last night, still rimmed with black, and Draco wondered if, rather than get a good night’s rest, Potter had even slept at all.
He can’t hear much through the sound of gasping from both of them, but what he can hear sounds a lot like “shut
Having had just about all he could take of Potter and curses and dreams that lit his blood on fire, Draco went to bed.
Potter toyed with a priceless figurine on Draco’s mantle, spinning it this way and that. “Except, apparently, a prophecy-child.”
He took the tiny bead and examined it. Up close, he could see it was covered in hooked spines, presumably to latch onto the victim. Likely, it had burst into the room with the initial explosion, although Draco wondered what possible purpose that could serve, since it rendered the recipient unconscious before they had a chance to open the package.
Draco looked at Potter properly then, for the first time, and he was thrown by the strength of the bitterness he saw there. Potter was staring at the package without moving, his eyes lost in thought. Had Potter always looked like that? In school, he’d always seemed to take an attack like a personal challenge, rising to meet it and all that Gryffindor rot. Potter didn’t look like a Gryffindor right now; he looked jaded and full of harsh edges.
Malfoy’s concern vanished in place of one of the biggest eye rolls Harry had ever seen. It looked painful. “I don’t know, Potter, maybe because I’ve been cursed to live in
“I’m sorry I trespassed,” Potter said slowly, and the bastard even sounded like he meant it. “I didn’t mean to make you feel… unsafe.”
.” His face grew tight and walled-off. “Maybe I don’t want them to know quite as much as I thought.”
Harry stroked him, unable to look away, and before long Malfoy was coming, too, his neck flushed as he turned away from Harry into the pillow.
Harry pushed himself back so that he was lined up between Draco’s legs and began to ease carefully forward until they found themselves back how they were before. He felt a flutter of anxiety to get it right this time.
Draco frowned, trying to work out what Potter was babbling about, and then it hit him. Dread filled his stomach, and for a second he thought he might throw up.
“Oh?” Potter turned to him and propped his chin on his hands in a gesture that was entirely too sober. “So, has it been longer, then?”
Draco nodded, his throat swelling with an unnamed emotion. He took a breath, closing his eyes for a second to regain control.
“Two teas, one hot chocolate, and one black coffee,” George was muttering repeatedly, before he realised that Draco was blocking his path. “Oh, Malfoy. How long do you think Percy will complain if I bring him a hot chocolate with extra marshmallows instead of his black coffee? He managed fifty minutes one time, but that was without the marshmallows. I reckon I can get him up to two hours.”
The decorations had been out for weeks in Diagon Alley, but now that the first of December was behind them, the feverish excitement of the place seemed to have exploded all around them. The tinsel that lined the lampposts was lit with tiny lights that sparkled against the falling snow, and enchanted snowballs could be seen bobbing along behind children as they darted through the crowd after unsuspecting friends.
The realisation that he had become every bit the pathetic, love-struck teenager he thought himself above had made him so angry he’d left with nothing but the clothes on his back.
If you want it to be, this will be my last letter. I don’t know what’s going on with you—why you’ve left England, or why you’re so hot and cold all of a sudden. Actually, it’s not really all of a sudden, I suppose… Anyway. I don’t know what’s happening or why I’m involved, but I do know why I haven’t left yet.
“Christ, Malfoy.” He coughed, stumbling through onto the carpet and rubbing the soot from his eyes. “Don’t you ever clean your Floo?”
But intention aside, time was of the essence, because it was clear their sender was only getting more invested. And with such unpredictable, amateur magic, who knew what the next parcel would do? It was probably some pimple-faced fifteen-year-old wanting the attention of the Saviour and his friends, and the longer he was ignored the more desperate he could become.
“Why? Is Ickle Potty afraid of the Forbidden Forest?” he asked condescendingly, and if he wasn’t holding Harry’s wand and extracting something as ridiculously precious as unicorn hair, Harry would have hit him.
Sure enough, by the time pub night rolled around, it was as if nothing had changed. Draco tried to act the same, but it was hard. How could he act like everything was the same when he didn’t even feel like the same person? He wondered if anyone else knew what Potter had gone through as a child. Did they know it had never truly left him?
He tuned slowly back in to the sound of Potter’s voice, realising that he was still talking, droning on and on in an increasingly desperate sort of way.
Draco stopped and stared at her, but there was no shrewdness in her gaze, no strategic calculation. Her expression was uncharacteristically open.
Potter’s smiled faded, replaced with a more sombre expression that Draco usually associated with Auror work and late-night cases that went south. His stomach flipped.
Draco made a growl of frustration and grabbed his coat. Stupid Potter and his inability to think for five seconds. He looked down at his hands and realised they were shaking. When had he started to care about a Weasley? He locked his front door behind him, shivering in the icy air of the hallway, and Apparated to St Mungo’s.
“There’s a way you can…” he continued, “I don’t know how to describe it—make an echo of an object. So long as you have a residual piece left behind, you can create a kind of pair.”
Even in the darkness, his fingers kept moving, caressing Potter’s face, his jaw. When Draco opened his eyes, he was struck by the fierce longing he saw on Potter’s face, the white-knuckled grip of Potter’s hands against his jeans.
Potter was groaning now, breathing unintelligible noises and panting as he thrust into Draco. His head dropped back, and he stopped teasing and gripped Draco’s cock, sliding his hand roughly up and down so that before long Draco was whimpering, begging him for more. The ancient bed creaked beneath them, and Draco half thought it might fall apart, but Potter didn’t seem to care as he suddenly sat up on his knees, grabbed Draco’s arse, and pulled him closer.
Draco read the letter three times, then crumpled it up and threw it at the wall. Then he remembered Potter was stuck here, nosing about, so he retrieved the letter, smoothed it out, and stored it in a locked drawer. So, his father was nearly dead. He’d been dying for ten years—it was about time. Not that Draco wanted it to happen; he merely wanted to stop fucking witnessing it. He’d long since given up having any control over Lucius Malfoy’s stubborn decisions, and he refused to watch the man slowly wilt into nothing.
“I do have one question,” George said sheepishly. “I don’t understand how you can know that at all if you can’t remember what happens while you’re working. That’s right, isn’t it?”
“Hurry up,” Malfoy snapped, and when Harry stepped out after him, the back of his neck was a faint shade of pink he’d never seen before on Malfoy. “I’ve probably already missed getting any of the decent bacon.”
Anger wars with indignation in Harry’s chest, but he’s too tired for either, so he just says, “Why do you
She gave the wand a tiny little shimmy, and a cloud of breathable air descended around Draco’s head. He drew in a deep breath and smiled.
Draco looked up at the sound of howling laughter, and after several seconds of unsuccessful focusing, admitted to himself that he was sloshed. He blinked a couple of times, pushed his wine glass away, and propped his cheek onto his fist because it felt like that might make everything stop spinning.
When he looks past the fence and tin shed he Apparated into, there is nothing around them for miles but tall, spindly trees with white bark and a few low-lying shrubs. He doesn’t know what he expected from Alice Springs, but the name suggested there might be water at least. Maybe the Apparition point is in the middle of nowhere, near the city.
He felt faintly self-conscious, as he remembered choosing his clothing carefully this morning, trying to pick something that was perhaps a little tighter, a little more fitted than usual. He hadn’t given much thought as to why, but he was starting to get a few ideas now.
He didn’t get up until the bell for dinner sounded and Malfoy had to kick his shin to rouse him from his thoughts so they could go together, something that was becoming tradition more than habit it seemed. Harry was distracted all the way through the rest of the evening with turning the thought of Malfoy over and over in his mind and examining what had happened at great length.
When the sky had turned dark and his head felt more full of exciting new things from the books than anything he’d learned since starting his summer courses, he reluctantly dragged Malfoy out of the library and to their room—though not before he had re-transfigured the books, of course.
“I know you have trust issues,” Blaise said drily, “what with having a wretched upbringing and all, but has it ever occurred to you that,
It felt different to how it felt in the dream state—sharper, almost painful. He opened his mouth to say something, but found himself choking a little, unable to speak.
Malfoy wasn’t touching him, but Harry could feel every word like a caress on his skin. Malfoy’s eyes were alight with desire, so deep and warm that it was all Harry could do not to lean forward and kiss him.
The midday sun had begun to drift behind the trees lining his house, and the creeping disappearance of its rays left Potter’s face in shadow. Draco swallowed.
The nurse held up a hand in apology. “I understand, but I really must stress he’s not in the most appropriate condition for visitors. Unless you’re a relative or spouse, I can’t let you through yet.”
Harry lets himself be soothed by the gentle words they whisper to each other and just sinks into his lover’s arms. Soon he is surrounded by the smell, the sound, the warmth of Draco, and it’s exactly where he’s meant to be.
The words ran through Draco’s mind long after the conversation had moved on. The party faded around him—the noise, sights, smells all paling in comparison to the direction his thoughts had taken. There was something in those words, some key, if he just knew how to look.
“Well, I…” Draco takes a breath. “I thought you might be running away and I happen to know a thing or two about that. I didn’t want to see you make the mistakes I did.”
“Shit, sorry, sorry,” he apologised, grabbing his cock and lining back up, slipping back in for the third time.
A dark expression crossed Potter’s features before he looked away. “Congratulations? Why the fuck do I care?”
Draco froze. Surely, this was a trick. If he’d been George Weasley, he would have suspected Draco of being
Draco groaned, burying in closer like he was trying to ignore him, but Harry could tell he was listening closely.
For a long time afterwards, Harry can still hear the echo of their gasps in his mind. Their legs are tangled in the bedsheets, waves are lapping against the shore in the distance, and the room smells like Draco’s cleaning spells. Harry is surrounded by him, and he doesn’t want to be anywhere else.
“I have been well.” As he said the words, he acknowledged both the truth in them and the lie he hadn’t wanted to admit, even with everything that had happened. “But I should have come to see you sooner. Not even because of all this, but—” he stalled, trying to think of the words while Eleanor sat patiently and waited. “I don’t think we ever finished here. I just sort of… disappeared.”
But there was something strange about that thought. He thought it around scents that humans could not smell, around trails of prey he should not see. He had become the Veela again, but he had not meant to.
He’d gotten home early and found Malfoy in his kitchen mere seconds after he had eaten the Daydream Dessert. They usually take up to ten minutes to take effect. And Malfoy hadn’t bolted or hastened to make excuses. He had been expecting Harry.
Potter frowned. “But it’s late. And Pansy… I mean, the receptionist isn’t even here, though. Pansy must be working late or something.” The words came slowly, like Potter had to force them out. Like it took him a second to remember which order they were meant to go in.
He gasps, the sound loud in the quiet kitchen which usually hears only the dull sounds of domestic routine. He’s sure that in all the centuries of Blacks that have lived here, it has never experienced anything like the desperate moaning he is making right now. The ceiling is higher than an average house, even on the lower levels, and soon his gasps and pleas are echoing back to him until they are both surrounded by the inescapable sounds of Harry’s pleasure.
“I have the figures,” Draco tucked the book back into his shirt pocket and patted it carefully. “So, I can start the map now.”
Potter gave a wry smile. “Embarrassed. I don’t know what the fuck came over me. It was… it was really strange.”
“Well there’s a resounding show of conviction,” Draco muttered. “I’m perfectly happy to risk my life now.”
“Half-fae,” she said, but she didn’t sound angry anymore, only tired. “And yes. He’s not very good at keeping secrets.” She smiled wryly.
Eleanor grinned and shook her bubblegum pink hair back from her face. “How do you feel now about the idea that therapy might take years?”
There was a frantic edge to the way Potter was moving, like he was pushing his way through mud and kept getting caught. Then, he looked up at Draco, his expression calm and ordered, and the moment passed.
Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t interested in him. He had made that abundantly clear with the way he retreated every time Harry made an advance. So, Harry contented himself with keeping a friendly distance the next time they met—dancing together, hands touching, guiding, communicating in the noisy club with a purely platonic intimacy.
“Did you study Ancient Runes?” Potter asked, leaning closer to inspect the shimmering symbol that was hovering in the air. “I didn’t, but I’ve looked into them since, and I don’t recognise that.”
With that, the mystery of how Potter had remained so silent for the last ten minutes was revealed as his Patronus scampered back into the room, whispered something into his ear, and disappeared. Then, he caught Draco around the middle and Apparated them straight to Kalen O'Fearadhaigh’s address.
Draco knows he likes lasagne. It’s Harry’s favourite food, just like Draco’s favourite food is filet mignon; they laugh about it all the time. It’s like the perfect representation of the two of them. They are so opposing in their tastes that no one in their right mind would have thought they would work out. And yet here they are; or at least, so Harry had thought.
“No,” he said roughly, shaking his head. Their eyes caught briefly, and for one breathless moment Draco could have sworn Potter’s gaze was heated, staring into him with an intensity he’d only imagined before, on nights that he was particularly drunk and lonely. Then, Potter turned away. “Nothing happened.”
When he stumbles into the kitchen, eyes still heavy, the sight of Draco nearly takes his breath away. Straight after the war, Draco went through an intense phase where he wore nothing but Muggle fashion; it was one of the things that made Harry stop and pay attention to him. Harry couldn’t even attempt to name the labels Draco is wearing, but the tight cut of his jeans coupled with the rolled-up sleeves of his shirt make him want to grab hold of his man and drag him straight back up to bed.
He had just finished checking the last of the spells for the fifth time, when a knocking so loud it could only be Potter came from the door, jolting him abruptly from his concentration and giving him a strong sense of foreboding for their impending work relationship.
Pansy moved in front of him and began tapping Potter on the cheek, lightly at first and then harder as she became more panicked.
“I had an illustrated version, you know. She and her sweetheart—the aforementioned—escape her by transforming themselves into all manner of things: a lake and a duck, a rose and a fiddler. It’s all very romantic and intense, and they defeat the witch, but her lover is ensnared by another and soon forgets her. The original translations skip over this part, but Pureblood memory is long.”
“Technically the slugs were your fault,” Draco pointed out, lips twitching despite his attempt to remain serious.
Long seconds ticked by, the sound of Malfoy’s frustration whistling through his tightly controlled breath. “They do,” he said finally, when he’d obviously gotten his emotions under wrap. “Me.”
Love took all sorts of forms, Harry supposed, and was shocked to realise he now held the most unexpected of them.
He cleared his throat, but Potter didn’t jump or turn around in alarm. He merely glanced over his shoulder, registered Draco standing awkwardly at the entrance with his broomstick slung over his shoulder, and turned away.
“What happened?” he asked, and then Kalen shifted awkwardly and George’s eyes were drawn to the fifth person in the room.
After a long, long time, Potter lifted his head. He reached out and picked up the box from the table, turning it over in his hands and studying it.
The room seemed to hold its breath as they stared at one another, each surrounded by lonely memories best forgotten. After a moment, Potter reached out to clasp him on the shoulder. It was only brief, the barest touch of skin on fabric before he turned away, but it was like nothing Draco had ever felt before: warm and gentle and a little bit awkward, but all the more powerful because of it.
“You opened the curse,” he whispered. Then he snapped his eyes open. “You didn’t think to mention this?”
Draco wasn’t sure how long he stayed at the counter, staring at the small pool of liquid around his coaster. He didn’t remember spilling it. Although, now that he was looking, he could see that his hands were shaking. He steadied them against the wood, pressing his fingertips against the lacquered surface and trying to remember how to breathe normally.
“Of course,” Potter said, still with that strangely distant expression. “Sorry, I think it’s just been a long day.”
“What if there was a way that the Ministry could provide basic protection spells for at-risk wizarding families?”
A horrible thought occurred to him. “You’re not doing this as a birthday present, are you?” He asked, knowing even as he said it that the thought was ludicrous.
“Of course I have a winning smile,” Draco protested, displaying it to full effect. “I am my father’s son.”
“I heard the seminars have only been added to the curriculum this year,” Hermione told him as they filed out of the hall. She was so excited she nearly dropped her book bag three times as she was trying to shove her schedule away. “Previous years only had to complete their assignments and report to their assigned Professor. Isn’t that wonderful?”
Thanks so much for your lovely comments! And special thanks to hootiepatootie for looking into Noirot (so cute!!!) And Hino_Hatari for giving me the inspiration for the setting in this chapter :)
Then he remembered Ron and Hermione, holding him in the Forest of Dean, giving him the strength to carry on, and found maybe he was experiencing something else altogether.
Pansy laughed and strode over to join them, linking her arm with Granger. “I was just telling them.”
With a wave of his wand, he locks and secures the front door. When he blocks the Floo, Malfoy looks up at him with a knowing, hungry expression, and he can’t hold back any longer. He crosses the kitchen floor and brings his hands to Malfoy’s waist, pausing for the merest fraction of a second before resting them there. For a moment, he is overwhelmed with the desire to just rest his forehead against Malfoy’s and stay there, breathing in synchronisation until the weight of the day has drained away, but he doesn’t do it. He only has an hour, and that tiny action feels like too much, like it might break him with the strength of how much he wants it, how much he wishes it were real. It’s easier to keep this daydream to something he might have a chance of walking away from.
The argument devolves into yelling, and Harry feels himself growing more and more distant, almost like he’s hovering behind himself, looking down at the two of them. He doesn’t know why. It’s not as though he and Draco haven’t fought before; their entire youth revolved around it, after all. But this feels different. This feels real.
Potter joined him, his shoulder brushing against Draco’s arm so briefly Draco thought he might have imagined it.
“Ah.” George nodded. “So, it’s a little like reverse engineering a tracking spell—you have to locate all markers before you can get to work on the whole.”
From the other side of the room, Harry thought he might have heard Malfoy sniff. Looking over at him, he thought perhaps he saw his shoulders shake, or maybe twitch. Harry found himself in the odd position of sympathising with Malfoy. Umbridge was an entirely other level of PTSD that left a lasting impression.
His mouth twisted into a grimace, and he took a step away from Harry, sitting back down on the bed. Harry felt like reaching out and pulling him back, but he didn’t.
He caught the Quaffle Potter sent sailing in a high lob above their heads, then sent it back fast and low. “I bet your house is Gryffindor party central?” he asked, an undisguised mixture of disgust and longing in his voice.
The second he wrapped his hands around his cock, he was gone. Malfoy’s eyes met his, dropped lower to where Harry was palming himself, and suddenly Harry could feel the weight of that gaze like hands on his skin. It was electrifying. He bit down on the knuckles of his left hand and closed his eyes, focusing on the way his fingers slid slowly up and down over skin that was slick with pre-come.
Granger shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “Well, to a certain extent, those are just Harry. He’s an emotional person.”
Potter’s frown deepened, although Draco had the impression he was only half-listening, as he stared around the room with the coffee pot half-raised, searching for a place to put it.
As the heavy wooden doors fell shut behind them, finally hiding the whispering couples and curious faces, Draco didn’t feel triumphant that their ruse was taking shape; he felt exposed.
When they were finally in front of the parcel again, potion in hand, Draco began to feel the first twinges of doubt. Last night he had been… not in the most coherent frame of mind. What if it truly was a dangerous curse? What if he had doomed the two of them with his hairbrained, wannabe-Gryffindor plan?
Potter tried the latch, it failed, and he walked back up the steps without meeting Draco’s eye. They remained standing side by side for several moments, staring out into the night.
Didn’t remember handing over his coat. Didn’t remember sitting down at the best table, high on the mezzanine with a view of the beautiful pond outside. He knew that Potter’s hands were on his waist for most of it, knew that Potter kept leaning in to whisper commentary in his ear, like they were actually lovers instead of just one big fucking mess. Draco made sure to smile and laugh when necessary, but he felt like he was floating. The sounds of surrounding conversation blurred into one, and he couldn’t focus beyond the painful tightening of his chest.
The argument rose from nowhere, but it was like they’d been in the middle of it all along. Something that had started years ago and never been resolved.
wanted. Why the hell would he be wanted? But Harry had heard the whispers and seen the articles in the Prophet. He knew that whatever else Malfoy was doing, whatever else he was, he was trying. Not just with money, like Lucius would have. Every week he was doing something new: working with laborers to rebuild what was destroyed, clearing out the Manor with donations to Ministry archives, providing much-needed space to St Mungos so they could transfer their therapy work—occupational and mental—to external premises.
Did Draco want to be reborn? Or had he wanted merely to suffer, thinking he had nothing else to offer?
It took him a second to recognise the face, but he soon realised Zach Smith had just stumbled in, drunk as a skunk and with his arms wrapped around the shoulders of two older women. It seemed as though he must have bumped into a family who were on their way through to the bistro. They all stood in the doorway arguing with each other while the mother shielded her children indignantly.
With his head tipped back, still grasping the headboard, Potter moaned. He was making a clear effort to stay still, to keep from thrusting his cock up to meet Draco’s mouth; Draco smirked and wondered how long he’d remain still when he realised what Draco actually had planned.
“Well, there’s your problem,” Morgan said with a grin. “You have to suspend your disbelief for a moment.”
Draco makes a noncommittal noise. “Not sure. What about you, Potter? Keen to get back to the Weaslette? I’m surprised she let you off the leash this long.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Clearly, I’m being facetious. And why are you calling me ‘Draco’ all of a sudden? Have you had an aneurysm?”
“We’ll have to disarm the second box,” Draco said finally. “It’s our only clue. It shouldn’t be too hard, using our notes—we can just apply the knowledge to the new curse and get back to where we were in a matter of minutes.”
Potter shook his head. “Nothing, just…” He sighed. “Ron’s working late in the Department of Mysteries, and he says my prophecy is glowing. It’s probably nothing. I mean, we’re in the middle of it, aren’t we? Of course it’s glowing.” He fell silent, staring ahead at nothing.
“You didn’t seem to mind,” Potter replied, taking a long pull from his glass and letting his eyes roam across Draco’s body.
He wanders down the beach, hitching his Transfigured shorts up around his waist and hoping they don’t turn back into a pillow before he’s returns to the hotel. There has been no word from Draco, and Harry is nervous to find out what happened after he left. He hopes Draco knows he wasn’t trying to leave him to deal with the problem alone; Harry was removing the problem altogether. And since the witches were there to see
There was nothing there on his face, no expression, no emotion, nothing. Draco grabbed Potter’s arm and shook it, but when he dropped his hand, Potter’s arm remained in place—stuck out rigidly and almost inhuman. True fear hit Draco like a tidal wave, rising in his chest and threatening to spill over.
Something white-hot and painful settled deep in Harry’s stomach, fuelled by years of loneliness and the deep-seated belief that he wasn’t—never would be—good enough. He had thought Malfoy wanted him, that he was new to all of it and just wanted to take things slow. Maybe that wasn’t it at all. Maybe Malfoy didn’t care very much, and he didn’t want to take Harry home because he knew he would regret it in the morning.
Just as the room began to fade, Potter leaned back in, their lips meeting in a gentle kiss that lingered a moment after everything else disappeared. Draco tried with everything in him to hang onto the memory, but after a few moments more, it faded too.
“Draco,” Pansy drawled, summoning a new bottle and uncorking it with a faint pop. “Don’t you think you’re too old for these childish tantrums?”
“Then what is it?” Malfoy asked, peering up at Harry through thick-rimmed glasses as he blinked his attention away from his notes.
The streets were covered in a light, dusty snow when he left, and he found himself thankful for the extra scarf he’d thought to grab on his way out the door. Since his apartment wasn’t far from the Leaky Cauldron and the entrance to Diagon Alley, he opted to walk instead of Apparating, mostly in the hopes that it would clear his head enough that he could make sense of the last few hours. His mind was a swirl of horrible, festering emotion, and if he couldn’t clear it with a walk at least he could be certain to drown it with alcohol.
His earlier nerves were beginning to fade now that there wasn’t quite so much pressure to be in charge, and he started to lose himself in the sensation of Draco’s hand between them.
Malfoy gasped then, and the pure delight in the sound had Harry coming, coming all over his fingers and shirt while Malfoy watched, his eyes dark in the moonlight.
It must have shown in his face, because Malfoy just nodded. “And I can’t get anyone to fetch it for me, because my apartment is warded to hell and back.”
into his tone as possible, “and it’s not a curse. They should have someone else. Someone who can actually help.”
“Or you,” Potter said, something unreadable in his tone. He opened his mouth to say something else, but seemed to change his mind and shut it again without speaking. Eventually, he simply said. “When I get these feathers…” He trailed off.
Draco mulled it over. After so long racing against the clock—to live, to save his family, to save Potter—it was difficult to identify the feeling, but eventually he did. Everything about the curse, about his destiny, had so far been a mounting pile of problems. Even the good parts were still something new added to a pile of stuff that got taller and taller and wobblier and wobblier. Knowing Harry was with him for good didn’t feel like one more thing to add to the pile; it felt like the pile had disappeared. Like time no longer existed, and fate was something he could choose.
He must have grunted or something, because Morgan stuck her head around the doorway—moving at a speed that seemed, comparatively, lightning fast—and made a noise of comprehension. She waved her hand at him, and suddenly he could move again.
The moment of true realisation had come two weeks ago, when Harry had sat down at Draco’s kitchen table and launched straight into a story about a Muggle-born child, Stacy, inviting three pure-blood children she’d met at the Junior Quidditch League to her birthday party. The three pure-blood children had been so honored that they were trusted to keep their secret. They’d spent days planning their outfits with Stacy’s help, reminding each other of the written list of words they couldn’t bring up, and basically amping each other up with excitement about this birthday party full of Muggles.
“That’s my grain basket,” Draco explained, smiling with all his teeth. “Igrelda will be nicer if she thinks you come bearing gifts.”
He waited for the bubble to burst, for the fear and uncertainty of being a Malfoy to come seeping back in, but it never came. He was an adult now, and he’d left all of that behind him.
Harry moaned, gripping himself tighter as his fingers slid smoothly across the slick skin. He knew what was coming. He’d grown up believing that desire was best achieved through secrets and veiled meanings, but with Draco, he’d come to love the sweet torture of words—explicit declarations of intent, of desire, that somehow teased him more than any number of ambiguous gestures would. He could follow where Draco led, or he could take them in a different direction altogether—he only needed to say.
“I was just about to find you,” she said with a warm smile. “You two are in charge of the case, I presume?”
Very soon, he realised he was far more interested in watching Malfoy than listening to the Professors talk. He found himself trying to remember back to eighth year and what he’d been like then. He couldn’t imagine Malfoy doing anything without a pack of cronies around him, but here he was, and surely he had been then as well? Had he always listened so carefully to the Professor? All his memories of Malfoy were of snide whispers and hidden smirks. This quiet Malfoy was someone new.
Malfoy pretended not to realise that Harry was watching but angled his face towards him all the same, allowing Harry to drink his fill of the sight. And when Harry turned away, he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him as well, saw Malfoy’s head tilt as his eyes traced a slow path down Harry’s body and up again. Something inside him shivered and ached for more, but he remembered what Malfoy had said and remained still. Somehow, that small decision to wait made it even more delicious—knowing that Malfoy wanted him, knowing that he wanted Malfoy right back, knowing that the two of them were building something together beneath these city lights.
“Talk about what?” Potter asked, leaning into his space. “What I’m going to do to you the second you say yes?”
There was no way to have anticipated the wet slide into Draco, the shiver that rippled through him as he inched his way inward. It was like all of his other senses abandoned him so that he could focus on the feeling of his cock encased by the hot, slippery tunnel.
The room they were in, now that Draco looked around, was very obviously not the workroom they had left behind in the physical world. It was approximately four metres square, and its most striking feature was its walls: they looked like the inside of a mechanical watch, interspersed with sections of metal lattice that pulsed gently with a faint white light. Draco turned around slowly, looking the walls up and down and determining that there was definitely no door. Thankfully, the floors and ceiling were ordinary floorboards and plaster, and they had no sensation of hot or cold in here, so, apart from being surrounded by imposing layers of moving metal, it was a relatively pleasant place to be stuck for the next few hours.
“How do you feel?” he asked finally, perching on the edge of the bed. He didn’t know if he was allowed any closer.
can’t see someone. Find a professional. Educate yourself. Get some support. Thousands of people have gone through this before you, Draco; there’s simply no sense in trying to do it alone. Don’t rush in there blind, and don’t
“Surely,” Draco echoed, thinking of all the petty arguments they had had, how volatile they both were, and all the ways that they refused to listen to the most reasonable of conversations.
Anthony Goldstein, with his trousers around his ankles, and a semi-naked lady friend had somehow ended up against a wall and were just about to get on with it. It looked like they would have, too, had Harry not stumbled upon them.
Draco gritted his teeth together, furious that he hadn’t figured that out himself. “Words, feathers, blood—this curse is getting awfully fucking complicated.”
Harry felt like tearing out his hair. Just when he felt he’d begun to figure out Malfoy, he pulled something like this and Harry couldn’t make heads or tails of him. After last night’s conversation, he’d expected… he didn’t know what he expected, but reverting back to snappish, standoffish, teenage Malfoy wasn’t it. The night before, he’d said he was trying. What exactly that meant, Harry wasn’t sure, but it sounded like… self-improvement, maybe? Not being such an arse at the very least.
He held his tongue all through the rest of the exchange with Hannah, playing along when Potter smiled at him, letting Potter get the door and take his elbow to Apparate them home.
A vision flashed in his bathroom mirror, there and gone in seconds but marked by the familiar blue flame that told him it was no hallucination. Potter stood in a blackened room, gripping a glass orb and staring at it with his face twisted into anguish. But not only anguish.
Draco felt a flutter in his chest that he hadn’t felt since he was a teenager, spending far too much time fantasizing about stupid boys paying him attention. It was like a secret note passed over in class, a present left under the Christmas tree by a secret admirer. He grabbed a cushion from the couch and perched on it so that he could be close to the fire. He scrawled another note and threw it into the fire.
If Draco didn’t know any better, he’d say Potter was teasing him. There was a heavy amusement in his tone, and he was lounging against the counter like some kind of visiting royal. It was distracting. But he’d never backed down from a challenge from Potter yet.
A sinking feeling began in his chest and dropped straight down into his stomach. This couldn’t go on. If there was even the faintest chance that this was real for Draco, then… well, he owed himself more self-respect than that. He’d fought hard to get to a place where self-respect was a hill he’d die on, but he was here now, and he wasn’t backing down that easily.
He felt Potter come to stand behind him and look around the room, and when Draco turned to look at him, he had an expression of calculated interest in his eyes. It made Draco feel unusually self-conscious, and he covered it with a fierce glare.
Draco’s mind returned to the night when Pansy had made her ridiculous bet. He remembered thinking how oddly sober Potter had seemed, even with all they had been drinking. He watched Potter closely now and realised that the drinks were disappearing far, far slower than he had ever realised. For every three drinks that the others consumed, Potter only had one, and he was constantly on alert. Draco catalogued the subtle twitches, the glances—the many ways that Potter responded to the
Draco blinked. “When did you all get so bloody intelligent?” he snapped before he could stop himself.
There is a steady flush rising along Draco’s chest that could be confused with sunburn except Harry knows it isn’t. It’s there because of him, and Draco is here because of him, and somehow Harry must have missed a hundred signals in the last few days because it really feels like he should have seen this coming. Should have at least suspected it instead of being blind-sided into being blown and ridden before he could even taste Draco in return, when that’s all he’s wanted for about two years.
He ran his fingers across the tiny, embroidered chest. It was satiny smooth, even after all these years. He frowned; something was bothering him. It was something about the chest and gifts inside it—he felt if he could just lay his finger on it, everything would fall into place.
It felt, for a second, like something was watching them—an invisible eye scouring the darkness. But then, they were gone.
“That would be somewhat limiting,” Professor Staltwort said with a genial smile. “Select your partners, please. I understand we have an odd number of students, but no more than three to a group!”
“Hmm,” Harry said, staring up at the gently swirling grey. “Can’t say I’ve ever shagged in a cloud before.”
Rose waved to him as Granger hustled her out of the shop. Morgan paused a moment more to say goodbye.
“Do you mind which side you sleep on?” Potter asked with a yawn, already fluffing up the pillow. “I usually take this side, but it doesn’t worry me.”
The peacock crept closer, closer, and as Draco suddenly registered the present day again, she darted forward and bit Blaise on the bum, warbling as he yelled and hunting for the grain in Draco’s basket.
Malfoy startled and leaped from the bed, spinning in a circle as he surveyed the room. There was no one there.
It made Draco smile, though the feeling was bittersweet. He couldn’t imagine any of those gifts contained a meteorite cufflink or a poor compromise in the form of a bright orange silk scarf from Paris. In the end, the children probably wouldn’t even care about the gifts—they had each other, and they would spend the day sharing whatever toys they had been given and enjoying each other’s company.
Then, he got up and stalked away. The plan was that Draco would follow, insisting to the others that he needed to fix things, but he found that all he could do was stare after Potter’s retreating figure in shock. Finally, he turned back to the others and saw a mixture of confusion and pity on their faces.
He wants to push Malfoy back down on the table, to take him apart with his lips and his tongue, but before he has the chance to do so, Malfoy drops to his knees. His fingers are shaky as they unbutton Harry’s trousers, shoving the fabric aside so haphazardly Harry is sure a cheaper material would have torn. When he reaches for Harry’s pants, he pauses, breath coming visibly shallow and harsh. He wets his lips. Then, very carefully, almost reverently, he pulls Harry’s pants down to meet his trousers around his thighs.
“Yeah,” he said finally. “But the thing with Robards is, if he doesn’t want to hear it, he doesn’t. He’s got too much on his mind to think about a new program. He’d rejected it before he even knew it existed.”
“Wizard clocks?” Draco asked, taking out a box of fine purple powder from his toolkit and walking over to the area of the mechanism he had started on yesterday. “I thought Muggles had mechanical clocks as well.”
Now confident that he could contain the curse if it exploded, Draco unwrapped the parcel that evening. He did it from a distance, well away from the protective circle of red chalk, and when the cardboard fell away in wispy threads he felt a surge of disappointment.
“Hannah Abbott, right?” He slid his eyes to Potter briefly, warning him to drop the argument before it ruined any chance of their fake relationship taking root in people’s mind. Then, he turned back to Hannah. “It’s been a while.”
“Well, I think the likelihood of us holding a stable trance is slim to none at this time,” Draco said stiffly. “And since time is of the essence, I fail to see that we have another choice.”
Harry frowned down at the vial as Draco dropped the last hair inside and corked it. “So, it doesn’t want to come in contact with your wand because the hair isn’t pure anymore?”
“Yeah,” Ron snorted, “You mean like wanting to get into a fight all the time.” He turned to them, then. “You can’t tell me you and Malfoy don’t argue anymore.”
Potter’s eyebrows shot up, and he followed, leaning forward to study the links Draco had drawn to each family. “You said something to me recently,” he said slowly. “What was it? It was really appropriate—oh, right. Were you dropped on your head as a child?”
.” He took a step closer to Harry, so close his breath brushed over Harry’s skin and sent every nerve-ending into chaos.
Draco had written one night after far too much wine. The parchment was blotched and torn where he’d tried to grab it back from the owl after it had taken flight.
But the more he thought about it, the more convinced he became. This curse had never made sense, not from the start. A secret box that compelled the victim to open it but exploded before they could? A simple somnolence inhibitor that was easily removed with no lasting damage?
Harry’s response was lost as the garment gaped open with each button, exposing more and more of Malfoy’s pale chest. Finally, it was loose enough that Malfoy was able to, with some wriggling, pull it clean over his head. He threw it to the floor on the other side of the room. Harry would have commented on how unMalfoyish that was, who always seemed the picture of a perfectionist, except Malfoy had foregone pants at all, and was now completely nude.
It was a long table, crafted from a cross-section of some enormous log that had been struck by lightning, the gaps in the grain filled in with resin. It was just the right length for Draco to sprawl back on it with his thighs spread.
Draco wrinkled his nose but kept watching. He’d never liked Smith. The guy had always been far too ready to kiss the arse of whoever was closest.
Potter’s voice, though back to his normal timbre, still grated like metal over concrete. Draco tried to think back to the moments before the explosion; had he still sounded like this? Draco thought he had, but at the time it had seemed plausible that he was just irritated at his secret being compromised. That answer no longer seemed so likely.
When they ended up out in the alley again after everyone had left, and Malfoy turned to him with eyes so heated that Harry stumbled backwards in surprise, he wondered what the fuck he’d missed. Then, just as quickly, the expression was gone.
This time, when he looked at Potter kneeling in front of him, eyes downcast in self-preservation, he didn’t feel relief—he wanted only for Potter to notice him, like Potter always did, and for the noticing to mean something, like Draco had always hoped.
Malfoy’s boots echoed in the barren hall as he strode toward the table. Professor McGonagall met him halfway, guiding him to the table as she had done Harry, and turning a blind eye to the restrained nod the two of them gave each other.
“Yes.” Draco felt like he was treading on broken glass. “Things will just return to how they were before. It was a silly idea, after all, really. We’d need to be married before Pansy would believe it, and even then, she wouldn’t trust me.”
“If it is, you’re losing,” he spat, distantly acknowledging that it didn’t make a whole lot of sense and just going with it anyway.
Moments later, he felt Draco withdrawing from his body, grunting as he fisted himself and started pulling furiously, all the while looking at Harry. Harry looked back unabashedly,. watching Draco wank from under his lashes.
Then, he felt the tingle of someone else’s magic washing over him as his boxers and jeans slid slowly down his thighs. His eyes snapped open to the sight of Malfoy’s wand pointed at him. For a moment, an instinctive jolt of fear ran through him, but then he saw the way Malfoy’s pupils were blown wide with lust. There was a pink flush riding high on his cheeks, and his lips were parted so that his breath could come heavy and uninhibited as he watched Harry touch himself.
Because the weather of the British Isles had changed with all the suddenness of a menopausal hot flash, the air surrounding the Black Lake had turned muggy and oppressive.
“Yes, Potter, I have the lubricant. I only made it myself and have told you this half a dozen times.”
Draco felt his stomach flutter pleasantly, and he bit back what he sure was an embarrassingly giddy smile.
He’s never been someone who argued over tea before. Sure, he prefers things the way he likes them, but he’s fine with a little bit of change here and there. He doesn’t mind trying new things, even if the new tea Draco bought him was absolutely horrid. But the last few weeks have been nothing
Malfoy heaved a great sigh and elaborated: “7:00 is when our neighbours like to demonstrate their inability to produce an adequate silencing charm.”
His abdomen tightened with heat, delicious waves of desire spreading lazily through his body. His cock was already stirring at the thought of what he could do with Potter, of what Potter could do with him.
Malfoy sniffed. “Hardly. At least preschoolers have the ability to stop activities when they want… more or less.” He sighed, then lowered his voice. “Fine. Potter, you give an excellent hand job,” he drawled, his voice laced with sarcasm. “Your turn.”
“What kind of inhibitor?” Potter asked suddenly, taking a seat on one of the wooden chairs lining the wall.
He considered refusing to allow Potter to join him, childish temper tantrums be damned, but there was a strong, undeniable part of him that was looking at the situation objectively. Potter knew the spell. He had access to information no one else did. Once they were inside the mechanism, there were no second chances. They could re-engage as many times as they liked, but they couldn’t introduce someone new or it would weaken the structure.
Harry’s face twists into horror, then confusion as he looks around at the grinning, triumphant faces of the men beside him, then horror again as he realises that yes, the man is definitely drinking beer out of a shoe, and no, the shoe does not look clean.
“And it’s hard not to—” He broke off immediately and shook his head, cheeks colouring a little beneath the moonlight. “Never mind.”
But there could be. Draco didn’t need to hear her say it aloud to know the danger. They said goodbye to the Healer, but Potter stopped him in the corridor.
“I’m not sure.” Draco felt suddenly hesitant. “The note only said to look for an inhibitor, but the readings above it show that we discovered psychical tendencies in the curse. It means he’s likely under a sleeping spell, but since it has lasted longer than twenty-four hours, I strongly suspect there’s something attached to him that’s dragging it out.”
“I’ll get her taken off the guest list,” Draco said firmly, staring down the path to where the blonde had disappeared.
When Harry opened his eyes again, something had changed. He hadn’t dared hope that when Draco had agreed to come back tonight, it might mean anything. As far as he knew, they were simply adjourning to somewhere more private, continuing the celebrations in comfort.
Draco hummed in thought. “I don’t recognise them.” A conflicting thought hit him. “Should I be morally opposed to taking pleasure from this?”
And he stumbled, the earth catching him as he fell, branches snagging on his clothing, before the dream faded away.
Draco wasn’t sure he’d ever forget the moment Ron Weasley had taken him aside one night, nearly six months ago, and hugged him. They hadn’t needed words. Draco knew that Harry was smiling more lately, that Ron’s owls were being returned with long letters in reply. He knew that they were seeing more of each other than they had in years, and the stilted conversation he had witnessed in the hospital so long ago had become a distant memory. He had tried to tell Ron that he hadn’t done anything, but Ron had just told him to shut up and accept the gratitude, so he’d simply smiled and nodded. Maybe he did speak Gryffindor after all.
? You know I was only joking the other day when I mentioned you together. This is a bit far to take for a joke, mate.”
Potter stared out at the party, eyes strangely unseeing. His hands shifted by his sides, like he was itching to reach for something. Draco wondered how far Potter’s wand was from his hands.
“You cried when you fixed the cabinet,” Potter snapped, and Draco suddenly felt like he couldn’t breathe. “You walked through, spoke to Borgin, then came back and cried. I read it all in your journal and for once I really, truly understood what you went through with Voldemort. I thought you’d changed, but you’re still the same little git you’ve always been, aren’t you?”
Their eyes met for a fraction of a second, and despite the fact they had said nothing cheerful, some of the pain in Harry’s chest eased.
Draco took a sip of the wine—surprisingly good—and tried to think how best to sum up the experience without becoming too technical. “We can’t remember it, no,” he agreed. “In the past, curse breakers had to scrawl notes on their body, so that they could read it when they awoke from the trance. Fortunately, we’re not so backwards now, and we can take items in and out of the dream-state with us, so long as they’re on our person. I can see from my readings that we’ve succeeded in plotting the first—” he hesitated, “layer, for lack of a better word. Once we’ve plotted all the necessary points out, I can look at my notes, map out the curse and its constituents, and then dismantle it from the outside with relative safety. When the curse unravels, it triggers the last part of the identification spell, so our defences can come down and the barrier that the potion and the wards constructed between us and our memories will disappear. Then, we’ll remember what the trance looked like.” He allowed himself a small smile. “I have to say, I’m dying to know what it looks like.”
“I’m serious, Potter. This is good news, excellent news. Best news I’ve had since you graced me with your unwelcome presence.”
“Yes.” Draco nodded. “It looks like a variety I’m not familiar with, judging by the residual thickness of the air, but I’m sure it’s just a slight modification.”
Potter twitched, like he wanted to reach for Draco. It didn’t make sense, because Draco had already determined the curse didn’t manifest anything physical.
“I like Earl Grey with breakfast,” Draco informed him, and then, just as he could feel Potter’s lips curving into a smile against his forehead, he fell asleep.
Neville shifted his feet. He didn’t look at Malfoy when he responded, “I overheard Mindy asking to swap rooms. She’s been put in with Anthony Goldstein. They had a thing a while ago. Nasty breakup. It was all over the department for months. McGonagall wouldn’t switch them, so I doubt she’ll let you.”
Potter fell blessedly silent, and Draco closed his eyes, feeling out with his magic for the edges of the curse. He always preferred to do the actual disarming wandless—he could feel all the little changes in the curse that way, all the ways it tried to push back or get around his defences. His mind drifted back to the first time he’d tried this, when everything had been confusing and nonsensical. He remembered his irritation and panic, and it was a relief to feel it all drift away now. He’d seen this before, even if he couldn’t yet remember it. It was all there, just as predicted in his notes: a line of mercurial for the explosion, a hint of psychical to compel the victim closer—and there, something strange and unknown that the bizarre note on his arm told him would trap and ensnare one of the Fair Folk forever.
If anyone else had said it, he would have hexed them before the words had even finished leaving their mouth, but from her, it sounded different. She wasn’t trying to impress him, to make him into something he wasn’t like some kind of poor, lost, misunderstood soul. She was simply recognizing something in him—something real and true, and that few other people had ever been interested in knowing.
“Don’t presume to tell me how I may or may not act around you,” Draco spat, his words becoming more clearly enunciated the angrier he got. “We are work colleagues, and we will remain in a civil arrangement until this endeavour is over.” He turned to leave, and then paused. “And for what it’s worth, Potter. I genuinely thought you might have changed too—I thought it possible we could have ended up friends after this.”
Potter shook his head, throwing a few Galleons down on the table. He shook his head distractedly. “No. No, I’ll catch up with you later, yeah?”
The girl rolled her eyes. “Duh, that’s because the tentacles have a hovering charm, like on a baby broom, so you can get away faster.”
The room stunk of singed feathers, but nothing else was damaged. Downy fluff floated past his face, its edges still crisping in fiery embers.
It was a dangerous thing to make promises he didn’t know he could keep; more dangerous still when the one he was making them to was staring at him like he might actually believe them.
“There are cushioning charms all around the hoops,” Harry explained, draping an arm of Draco’s shoulder and pulling him in close. “Two metres is the maximum height these brooms go to, so you can be utterly certain these kids are going to fly that high anyway.”
“Potter, listen to me carefully,” Malfoy said, his voice level and yet strangely urgent. “I wasn’t sure earlier, but now I’m certain. It’s
Draco felt like his skin was humming, burning with something unnamed and unknown. He allowed himself to fall into a quiet space that he rarely indulged in for fear of ambush—watching, listening, waiting. There was something comforting about Potter’s presence in his kitchen, making notes and humming to himself out of tune.
“I just—” Draco broke off, ran a hand through his hair, searched for some way to explain what he meant without giving himself away. “Don’t you think it’s a bit ridiculous? We should just… I don’t know. Go back to our ordinary lives and pretend it never happened.”
Potter laughed at the expression on Draco’s face and then reached for him, tugging his clothing away with eager hands and replacing it with his lips, his tongue, his teeth. They fell back onto the bed, naked except for their socks which had been too far away to waste time reaching for. Draco’s heart still hadn’t slowed, and he could feel a flush rising on his chest. It was almost embarrassing; they’d barely even started. He tried to hide it by pushing Potter down and pinning his wrists to the bed, writhing against him.
Harry strode forward and examined the closest artefact—a broken Sneakoscope he assumed was from the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. “Then the curse is airborne, not just through physical contact.”
He didn’t really mean it. It hadn’t been her responsibility to stop him, and he wouldn’t have stopped even if she’d tried.
He lowered his hands to Draco’s thighs again, spreading them a little and licking a long stripe along the underside of Draco’s hard cock. The answering moan nearly sent him over the edge, and he licked again, and then again, and then drew the tip into his mouth to gently suck while Draco begged him to stop teasing.
The memory of Potter’s face when they’d last parted ways shoved its way into Draco’s mind. He dropped his head back against the lamppost and groaned. Whatever positive thing Potter
Draco hadn’t even realised he was standing, walking around the table, until he came to a halt just before Potter’s chair. Potter leaned back, legs spreading just a little further, and looked up to meet Draco’s eyes.
Potter nodded, staring vacantly into the distance. He looked like he was coming to some sort of decision.
Remembering his recent determination to keep things civil between the two of them, Draco let go of his rising ire and held out the Sickles in his palm like an offering. They glinted in the bright light of the hospital waiting room, and Potter stared at them in confusion.
Potter stared at him. “I thought this was meant to be an execution curse,” he said thoughtfully. “But it can’t be if it’s possible to accept reparations.”
One of the witches tries to use her copy of the book as an impromptu battering ram, breaking through the shield charm and hammering at Draco’s chest with it while he stands between Harry and the witches. Draco’s only armor is the soiled bedsheets clutched around his waist, while Harry makes creative use of the pillow and tries to recall how Transfiguration works under stress.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, though he could tell from Potter’s voice that there was a ‘barely’ hidden in there somewhere.
Anger rose in Draco’s chest, banishing the lingering peace of his orgasm. “I’m not talking about the sex,” he snapped. “Something is wrong.”
Potter contemplated this as Draco thought of curses that were really gifts, and the idea that they might die for them anyway, and then Potter nodded.
The whole time, Malfoy just watched him. As with most things these days, the judgement felt oddly distant. Unnecessary. Not worth Harry’s time.
Malfoy blinked. His mouth opened and closed several times as he struggled to find something to say. Harry hoped it wasn’t going to be something that started an argument; he didn’t have the energy to be pissed off.
Suddenly, Malfoy sat up and straddled him, his fingers tracing a line up to Harry’s neck. “I want to try something,” he said, slightly unsure. “It’s a little strange.”
Though they were both sweaty and disgusting, Harry couldn’t help the euphoric grin that spread across his face, or the arm that came up around Draco and started playing with the fine hairs at his nape.
He pulled the scarf down and glared at her. “Do you mind?” he snapped, before realising that it was the woman he had seen in the shop yesterday—George’s partner.
The moment drifted around them, and between the time they laid down upon the sand and the time they stood, Potter reaching down to help Draco up with an offered hand that Draco gratefully accepted, they became friends.
“Malfoy.” Potter stared at him over the glass. “I’m here because I think I can pretend to be so madly in love with you that even Hermione is fooled. I think I can manage a little swooning.”
They fell asleep in their arm chairs that night, and when morning came, they barely had the chance to say two words to each other as they raced to get ready and run out the door. But they promised to meet again on Saturday, ready for their first date.
“Why doesn’t the defending mother just do it?” Potter asked, looking away. “It’s all about infringed territory and safety, right? Seems odd to get anyone else involved.”
Later that night, he met Potter by the corner of a small Wizarding district he’d never been to, on account of it being far from any area his parents had allowed him to go. He was pleasantly surprised to find the area bustling with activity, full of laughter.
For the most part, Potter didn’t even acknowledge their argument. There had been a small moment there where Draco thought he might be getting the cold shoulder, but then Granger had bumped into them and received the same treatment. He decided then that it must simply be that Potter’s bad mood had not yet evaporated.
At that, Draco laughed, the sound bubbling up from somewhere deep inside him with a hint of hysteria. “Potter, we could never be casual.”
Draco nodded, removing his toolkit from his front pocket. He selected a pot of blue dust and took it over to wall he had been working on.
Potter levelled him with a stare. “I don’t know,” he said pointedly. “It aches a bit, but since this is only a metaphysical representation of the curse rather than a real room, for all I know I’m bleeding to death on your workroom floor. There’s nothing we can do about it now, so let’s just get started.”
Draco’s eyes pleaded with her, silently begging her to see through the lie. He felt a hand clasp his shoulder, and on reflex, he turned. Potter was there, green eyes shining with mirth and triumph. Beneath it, something strange simmered—the same thing that had been frozen in Potter’s eyes when he’d first stepped through the doors. It was a little cold, a little tinged with a blank emptiness that sent warning bells ringing in Draco’s mind. Draco frowned, but he couldn’t think of what to say to address it, couldn’t think how to help.
They began to move slowly against each other as the kiss deepened. Draco reached out blindly for the lube and poured it over the both of them, making Harry yelp at the sudden cold before Draco took hold of both of them in his hand and began to stroke.
He wondered if, when this was all over, he might get the chance to spend years with Potter, working to find the many ways they fitted together and the many ways they could overcome it when they didn’t.
Oddly, he did trust Potter. It wasn’t just that he was emotionally invested in this case, which would certainly override any feelings he had about Draco. It wasn’t just what George had said to him—that Potter thought he was the best—and the certainty that Potter wanted him on this case. It was the look in Potter’s eyes, how everything seemed a little bit dull around the edges. It was the certainty that nothing was hidden, not around Draco—the knowledge that there were no simpering smiles that could fall away as soon as his back was turned.
“Then please, by all means, make it stop,” Draco replied. “But until then… all you can do is stamp on it when it rears its ugly head.”
Potter gaped at Draco. Whatever protest he’d been going to make had disappeared, and his face was open instead with a fierce sort of hope that made Draco’s breath catch in his throat.
The second he could break away from his friends, claiming tiredness and a need for an early night, he did. Malfoy had already left, and for a moment Harry was scared that he wouldn’t find him in their room, that he’d have disappeared somewhere in the castle. But when he opened the door, he was sitting there on the bed, leaning against the wall and frowning down at his hands.
Everything feels right when it’s the two of them like this. Draco teases him, his lips and tongue as wicked when they’re on his skin as when they’re whispering filthy words into his ear. He loves this side of Draco—the push and pull between his impeccable manners and the fierce desire he hides so well.
Potter bucked beneath him, surging forward to meet Draco’s lips. Draco braced his hands against Potter’s inner thigh and began to set a steady rhythm, laving the soft skin with his tongue again and again while Potter writhed beneath him. The sounds he was making had turned from rough and sensual to downright filthy—whines mixing with muffled curses as Potter turned his head and bit down on the pillow.
“After the war, I could feel it. Dead, but lingering, rotting away in my blood. The Unspeakables wanted to study me, like I was some kind of lab rat. Given half the choice, I reckon they would have left it inside me just to see what it did.”
He was just starting to believe that Malfoy would never respond when he finally moved. It was just to lean back against the chair more firmly as he perused Harry with what might have been interest or perhaps curiosity, but it made Harry feel loads better.
“Well,” he said slowly. “You are. So, next time, you can use the front door like a normal person. Is everything all right?”
you always get the creeps, though?” Weasley mused, his tone serious for once. “I mean, look at you. You’re a bloody catch. Smart, fit, saviour of the wizarding world; is it too much to ask that someone decent asks you out?”
Draco opened his mouth to answer and then frowned. “Well, because they’re so familial. It’s all about defending their bloodline with the harshest justice possible, and you don’t get much harsher than a scorned lover. Which then proves the Veela’s loyalty to their flock: they’ll destroy their own soulmate if that’s what it takes to defend the territory.”
