Draco decided to interrupt this, he knew where this was going. Jeremia didn’t make it. He needed to ask Pansy to stop reading dramatic stories or fairy tales. And yes, this book was in French and Pansy probably read it to him so he could train his language.
“Which you won’t do” Pansy grinned, not even looking at him. “Because if you do that, our friendship is officially over!”
Well, Draco wasn’t sure he would be telling them all he’d find out, especially since it might not be all that good… If it wasn’t that bad, he would tell them, but if they had been hurting baby Potter, he wouldn’t say a word. Maybe. He wasn’t sure about it yet.
“You know she’s capable of doing exactly that, right?” he asked and motioned towards Pansy.
The Headmistress nodded. “I believe the news have travelled fast though not only from my side of things.” Harry grinned and looked over to Ron who was currently holding a heated discussion with Professor Sprout and Madame Hooch as well as Dean, Seamus and Daphne. They were most likely discussing some Quidditch, as only this had Ron so riled up and passionate.
“I think I would die without you.”
“Harry…” Draco said and closed his eyes, shaking his head. “Did you just change my hair to blue?”
“I think I remember Sirius” Harry said thoughtfully. “But I remember a lot of confusing things. I wanted to live with him, I think? But he was a murder?” He once again turned to Draco as if he was looking for some direction with his help.
Draco laughed and kissed him, before freeing himself with some difficulties. “You
“He’s not really into brewing potions. If I’m correct, he will be working in the hospital wing, once Madam Pomfrey gives him her blessing hopefully.” He looked up to the castle ad smiled softly. He was surely getting the job as Hogwarts’ healer once he had finished his apprenticeship finally.
Yes, I know Ginny is holding a party and no I won’t be bringing anybody. Don’t worry about Malfoy, we’ll talk later.
They had been living here for five weeks already and Eric had shown absolutely no respect for the Muggles over the street. One week, he had – of course accidentally – charmed the postman not to give them any mail and the poor man had kept putting it into their box. Every morning, Eric had marched over the street to personally hand Vernon Dursley his mail. One day, all the water had mysteriously turned into syrup and Eric said it was an experiment that went awry. And that other week he had completely ‘forgotten’ his address, since they lived here for only a few weeks and given the landscapers the wrong address. While the Dursley’s were gone, these poor workers dug a hole so deep you could fit a whole donkey in there. And when Harry’s uncle came to protest, Eric had shrugged his shoulders and with a wave of his hand completely undid the hole in the earth in front of him. He seemed about to explode.
Ian glared at Potter and then at Draco as well. “That will be a negative article, Evans.” Potter simply shrugged his shoulders and continued eating as if nothing was going on. However, his ex wasn’t done talking. “If I have to wait this long, I’d like to have a room!”
“Blaise!” Harry called out to finally make his new friend stop and he grinned, when the Slytherin looked at him with wide eyes. “Give me the letters tomorrow and you’ve got a job for next year.”
Harry’s eyes darted over Neville who had a miniscule smirk on his lips, as he shrugged his shoulders. He then looked at Hannah who seemed to be more relaxed. So… ‘talking’ must have been code for… something else most likely. Or they really were going to talk and that made both of them feel better.
Draco had almost burst out laughing. Potter, a snob? That was the most amazing thing he had heard in a while.
Frowning, Draco turned to Harry. “Why are you awake, then?”
Well, his ward beamed. “I am a good wizard! Look!” He closed his eyes, pretending to try his hardest to do some magic.
“Draco!” Harry laughed and shook his head. “You are aware that one day you’ll have to talk to him, right?”
“No” Harry repeated. He was aware that he was cutting off his friend, but he really needed to drive this point home. “I’m not helping Draco Malfoy. He’s made my Hogwarts years a living hell. He is responsible for so much bad shit! I am not going to do this.”
“No, thank you” the Gryffindor chuckled. “Could you just tell her that I don’t think of Slytherins that way and that I’d like to see her again?”
The empty looking room with a wallpaper of the Blacks. He walked in, looking at all the names there, even his own name appeared there. Some heads were blacked out, almost burnt, while others seemed to be kept in very good conditions.
Rolling his eyes, Ron took his book again and rubbed his forehead. Hermione shook her head and turned back to her book, before she mumbled something that sounded like ‘You need to be nicer to the books’.
Draco chuckled, leaning against him. “Not really.” He grinned and turned slightly to kiss the corner of his mouth. “Except that I love you. I would probably sleep in the shower tonight, if it weren’t for you.”
“Yes, sir.” Severus nodded, while Albus smiled sweetly. Yes, asking people if he could trust them was the best kind of manipulation. Nobody wanted to be untrustworthy! They all fell right into his trap; after that, they would usually do what he wanted them to do. Albus was sure that Severus was one of them as well.
“Could you maybe… Could you call me bear?” Harry asked rather sheepishly and he seemed to be unsure of whether or not he had overstepped some nonexistent line. “It just… It makes me feel safe and home and… loved.”
Ginny chuckled. “After the war, both of us had quite a lot of trouble, understanding what our relationship was. That was when we decided to take a break, figuring ourselves out first, before we would be back together.”
It was somehow funny to him how he called Potter ‘bear’ and now his favorite childhood book was something about a bear…
Harry grinned mischievously, while he answered: “You definitely eared that!”
inhibition of magical control, hindrance in eye sight, containment of animal language (exception: snakes), food surveillance, disdain mechanism against Slytherins
Unsurprisingly, everything his friends had looked into had turned out to be a dead end. Gringotts had refused to give him any of his former inheritance, since Narcissa had taken his name in front of two witnesses. And well, they claimed that she was capable of thinking clearly – for which they probably received money. Since the last witch or wizard who had lost their name had happened over three centuries ago, none of Blaise’s contacts could help even a little. And well, while Pansy and Theodore had used all their free time – Theodore even some of his study time – to find a way in giving Draco his name back (that wouldn’t require marriage) they had found nothing.
When he entered the Common Room, with Millicent and Theodore in tow, Pansy jumped up immediately and led him to their secret spot. “How are you feeling, Harry?”
While a house elf picked up the teddy and gave it back to Potter, Draco turned to his friend. “If I’m not wrong, Pansy, I think you’re starting to like Potter.”
“Oh, by far walking into that forest to die. That’s just crazy on another level.”
“Wha…?!” Harry looked up and laughed. “You should probably tell whoever you’re bringing here that there’s a game going on between us and the rest of them, just so he knows that people might hate him even from the start.”
Draco nodded. He was just about to tell him that he might come by his shop again to look for an owl himself (since Draco thought that his former parent’s owls weren’t really made for him anymore), however Oliver interrupted his action.
“Nope” Harry had answered, still grinning.
“Yes! You’re that. And people don’t feel safe depending on where they are. Like, when they’re on top of a waterfall on a boat! But if they get to see you, they know that you are beautiful and nice and you can protect them. Like you protect me.” Harry explained and smiled at Draco. “So I like your hair!”
“How long ago did that happen?” Draco shook his head. If he would have called any of his friends ‘teacup’ that would have probably resulted in a not so friendly duel.
Draco chuckled and ruffled Potter’s hair. “Don’t worry, bear, you’ll get it soon enough. What did you do today?”
“I’m pretty sure this is how it’s going to stay until I die. The darkness just… gets me all the time.”
Harry opened one eye, still grinning. “If you do that, I’ll tell Pansy that it’s not justified. And once I’ve eaten her dessert, I’m going to visit Hermione, Ron and Neville and tell them that you didn’t give me any food today and they’ll do a festival in my honor with a lot of food!”
They walked into the kitchen, once Harry had taken Draco’s jacket, and he made his visitor a cup of Christmas tea as well.
Rolling his eyes, Harry shook his head. “As soon as I was gone from the Aurors I just became one of the lying citizens to him.” He glanced through the door and saw Kingsley turning his wand it the upper few levels and scanning the house.
“Sure he does, mate” Harry smirked.
“Probably closer to curfew” Draco answered and Pansy smiled, waved at him and went to their Common Room, quite clearly deciding to wait in there for him. Draco knew she was even going to be there if he came back past curfew.
For now, it seemed as if even Pansy was unable to place the letter. “I don’t know, Dray. It does look sincere, but then again…”
Draco noticed that the Gryffindor looked at him for a little help and so he bent down and whispered (loud enough for Theodore to hear) “James.”
That made his husband smile weakly. They waited until it was clear that nobody was standing in front of the tapestry and Harry peered out, walking into the hallway again once he had confirmed that there was indeed nobody else left.
“That’s not over, Malfoy” Ron said and raised his eyebrows.
How is this going for almost three hundred days?! Is there ever an end to this?!
Eric chuckled softly and a ruffling of sheets made Alamar think that he likely sat down on Harry’s bed. “She’s a protector, you know. And I think all she wants to do right now is to make sure that you’re doing okay. Are you okay, Cowboy?”
Neville chuckled and leaned back in his chair. “It will be fun though.” With seeing Harry’s raised eyebrows, he continued half laughing: “I mean, seeing how everyone is teaching their children. I heard Nott has a baby girl as well.”
“I’m counting on it. Same type of whiskey, or would you like some wine?” Severus asked with a lopsided grin.
“No! Please don’t! I didn’t even want this!” Draco called out and tried to get up from his bed, but he was held back. He turned around and found the girl his mother had wanted to marry him to in his bed.
Fleur motioned to his stomach. “It counteracts the fertility potion. If you take this within the first ten hours of the first potion, nothing happens to your body.”
Smirking, Harry turned to look at her. “Wouldn’t this condition make it better to keep secrets, because you keep forgetting them?” he offered.
“We need to figure out what kind of love potion that was, love.” Draco’s voice was so far away, making Harry realize that he had almost fallen asleep. Inhaling deeply, he opened his eyes.
“That is a good question, Harry” Neville frowned and looked at the book. “I mean, the only thing you can really do is to just... ask them something. Maybe you can ask them for help in a specific area where they are the experts? Ask for homework help? That would however only work if this person was on a higher level than you. If we’re talking about a younger student, maybe offer them help?”
“Twelve years ago, yes.” Alamar smirked and nodded when Eric looked at him rather surprised.
Before they reached the castle, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand. “Hey, I’m proud of you for taking Madam Pomfrey up on her offer. You are an amazing healer and I know that you can do great things here, at Hogwarts.”
How could it have been differently? They had discussed it last night. Harry had probably woken up and freaked out by where he was. Maybe he had raced out of the Common Room, where Draco had been sleeping and he had run up to the Gryffindor tower. How had he not heard a thing?!
Once Harry had gotten his official room, Draco had gone to his now-father and asked whether or not things were okay. Apparently, Harry had finally gotten to hear all the rules there were in Slytherin. For some unforeseen reason, however, the former Gryffindor had joked that it didn’t really matter to him, since he would be gone in about two or three months anyway.
“Waiting for the perfect moment, when the uncle’s coming home.”
“Thank you, Draco.”
“Sometimes I forget that you two used to hate each other” Weaslette said and grinned at Draco. She put everything back where it belonged, while he looked at his ward and shrugged his shoulders.
“We’ll be going to Russia first thing tonight.” Eric told her and placed the arrow on the table, charming another one to float over to him, so he could continue to clean them.
“Good night to you too” the Gryffindor answered and hugged Draco even more, until the door was closed and he kissed his forehead.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Here we go again.”
I can’t believe this song apparently doesn’t exist in English? I couldn’t find the exact translation of it. Well, it means: “There between the ox and the grey donkey” and is a sort of sleeping Christmas song (it’s so beautiful!) I love Christmas music xD
Before he could say more, Draco was already standing next to him and Blaise appeared right next to him. Neville too had walked up to him, not willing to be left alone.
Looking up, Eric let the garden hose fall down and looked at it without showing any intent of getting it again. A malicious smirk appeared on his lips, as he turned to Alamar with a sudden sweet expression. “I’ve got no idea what you’re referring to.”
“No! It’s the wrong thing to do. Besides, there’s nothing we can do with spells and magic or whatever to stay out of their sight for a long time.”
Theodore rubbed his forehead. “Alright, what would happen should the Hat choose Slytherin?”
The man standing at the front door had slightly pointy ears and seemed a little taller than Uncle Vernon, though that wasn’t a huge achievement. When Boy finally sat down at their kitchen table, the man with pointy ears placed a cup of hot chocolate in front of him.
After a sweet kiss, Harry whispered into his ear: “I mean, you stole my heart without trying!”
Draco smiled weakly. “No worries, Harry. It was quite easy to take care of you.”
Draco smirked and turned back to the lake, when the boy apparently had seen him. He let go of Olivia and came closer, while outstretching his hand. “You must be the stranger, everyone has been talking about! I’m Aaron Cooper.”
Neville nodded. “Yep. I’ve met him plenty of time there.” He grinned when Hannah rolled her eyes, clearly not happy that Neville had to apparently spend so many days in the hospital.
“What the hell is going on here?”
Potter chuckled. “You’re not eighteen, yet, Aaron.”
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “Severus is taking care of him today.”
Chuckling, Eric shrugged his shoulders. “Time is rather irrelevant when you live for a few hundred years, Dwarfbart, we both know that. So, I do believe we’ll see each other soon. Whatever that might mean.”
Draco rubbed his forehead when he read through the Injury Parchment. There were no more words left. It wasn’t even surprising anymore, but the sheer amount of
Draco smirked and leaned at the rock as well, still having Harry’s arm around him. His boyfriend was wrong – completely. He was almost perfect boyfriend material. At least for him. Honestly, he couldn’t think of someone who would work with him as well as Harry did.
But he couldn’t say that. Dudley was always more trustworthy than he was. Even though Boy rarely spoke and when he did, it was the truth. However, in his short life he had learnt two important things. One: His cousin was always right and two: not to trust adults. They never believed him. It also hadn’t surprised him that Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon kept him in the house most of the time, hidden from any official people. They didn’t want to spend money on him and well, apparently school was money?
Grinning, Harry picked her up and spun around the small space. “Dominique, how are you?”
Neville threw his hands into the air and shook his head. “How dare you!” he laughed. He quickly planted a kiss on Harry’s lips and smiled softly. “Well, I have been thinking about your proposition.”
“I can hear you, you know!” Eric shook his head, clearly unable to believe that his husband would give away a secret like that. Well, there was also a fond expression on his face and he turned to the batter with a smile on his lips.
Well, Harry apparently wasn’t going to say it, as he turned back to the story and shook his head. “I can’t believe you didn’t correct me, Draco! A penguin in Madagascar?”
By the way, yes I know half of these comments are mine, answering your comments, but without your comments first, I would have had nothing to answer to, so in my opinion, this is still worth a huge thank you and another chapter ;)
“Apparently not” Harry answered and shrugged his shoulders. “I haven’t seen him. There was no one in the cell.”
Blaise looked at his hand and turned around to face Draco. “Hey, Dray, can you please get your ward under control again? Something weird is going on today…”
Pansy had been with them, there was no way he could have seen her as they had not hidden her and nobody had taken any more of Hermione’s Polyjuice Potion.
Harry frowned at him. “Are you sure?”
Thank you so much for this uplifting notice, Ginny. Really helped me in not thinking about my death… Anyway. Let’s hope it stays like this for a few more days or maybe weeks…!
Harry turned around and widened his eyes. “What?!”
The Ministry had destroyed all contracts with the Slytherins and offered actual jobs to most of them. Each and every one of the Slytherins had politely declined and sworn to build a life far away from the magical society – or at least the Ministry.
“No!” Draco sat up and shook his head. “That I do not question one bit! I really want to go through with it!”
He turned around and walked back into the house, while Boy nodded and picked up the shovel, hearing the car doors open and close, chatter and then the engine starting to drive away. At least now, he could work on his own without fearing that someone might try and destroy his progress.
“I will stay here until you have eaten everything on your plate. I’m not going anywhere and you’re not going anywhere either. Eat!”
“You hate everything” Eric grinned, while Harry agreed to some pancakes.
cat that could eat chocolate!?”
The fact that Harry was having visions was also something that confused Draco. From all his knowledge, there should have been no curse handing out visions just for the reason of having visions. Usually, it was something like what the Dementors were doing: showing the worst memories as visions, having people from your past telling you off and all that other shit.
Smiling, Draco shook his head. “I loved it, bear! Don’t worry, you don’t have to ask me. And I don’t think Pans, Theo, Ze or Mil have anything against your magic. But you do have to ask strangers, okay?”
Neville beamed at them and shook his head. “So, what have you planned for today?”
Harry had wanted to ask what was going on, when he heard them too – a few of their classmates walking the halls after midnight, just talking to each other.
Draco was not going to give away Pansy who had dressed him in it and the rest of Slytherin apparently wasn’t giving away that Draco called Potter bear so the costume was matching everything. Severus frowned and looked around, however, when he saw that nobody was talking, he turned back to Potter. Since Draco’s ward wasn’t showing any signs of hate for the costume, Severus shrugged his shoulders. “Alright, don’t tell me then. Just don’t go to the play date with a dressed up Potter.”
“Of course” Draco answered and changed to sit Indian style on the grass. Aaron followed his example.
“Alright, okay. We’re naming the cake.” Draco looked at the parchment and started writing again. “He packed his little bag with two pieces of Chocolate, a piece of strawberry cake named Ian and his favorite teddy bear called Herbert.”
Harry nodded and rubbed his eyes. It seemed as if there had been some kind of unshed tear hiding. “Don’t worry, bear. We survived that year as well.”
“No, he’s not, Harry!” Ginny said vehemently and crossed her arms over her chest. “Just because you told the Aurors not to imprison Malfoy and them realizing that they totally forgot about him, doesn’t make it’s your mistake!”
“Hey love” Pansy leaned over and kissed him.
“What?” Harry smirked and looked at Neville. “Tell me, do you smell get strawberries from this wine?”
Ginny stopped in the middle of her action, her hand raised in the air about to take another Christmas cookie, when she turned to him. “So, you’re talking to Nicolai again? Maybe that’s what this weird feeling is?”
!” He got up and took one step closer towards Harry. “All this time, I work my arse off and what do you do? Nothing! You play pranks on me, destroy my reputation and worst of all… you bring back my nightmares!”
He felt the house shiver and within a few seconds, a Pensieve lay on the floor with a memory floating inside. Harry stared at it in shock.
The man, which was probably William, sighed and hid it in the drawer again. He then turned around and pulled out a parchment on which he started writing quickly. There were tears in his eyes as he continued writing.
Harry smiled and moved his finger in tiny circles on his neck. He knew that his husband always relaxed that way and he was right again, as Draco leaned closer to kiss his earlobe again, his eyes closed.
Theodore laughed. “You trained him well!” he said to Harry who rolled his eyes.
His home looked… normal. Still cold, unwanted to all kinds of visitors and it still seemed to have an air of death around it. Great thing to get a relationship back on track.
McGonagall chuckled and nodded, before she turned to Draco. “I’ve talked to the other professors, Malfoy. Professor Babbling would prefer for you to be part of her Studies of Ancient Runes classes and Professor Sinistra believes as well that you would learn more in her classes than learning Astronomy by yourself.”
“I absolutely do. Not for the first time.”
She sat down on the couch, next to Harry and sighed. “He was a very bad man. And he lived with Draco until he died.”
Harry rolled his eyes, knowing full well that Draco – his apparent
When Alamar snuck up the stairs, he passed a lot of old looking portraits of witches and wizards. Stopping in front of one that vaguely reminded him of a former head teacher in Hogwarts, he sighed softly. For their own safety, he secretly placed a reversed notice-me-not spell over all the portraits in the house for the time being. Like that, they could walk around the house and the portraits wouldn’t even realise anyone was in here.
Potter shrugged his shoulders. “It wasn’t his dream job. When I first met him, he was a carpenter. Life is weird like that.”
“Wizards?” Harry frowned. “But that’s just fairies and… things. Not real.”
Please have patience, I'll continue as fast as I can :)
Gregory Goyle,
I took Nora out for a walk. A walk! It went so well, I even bought myself some ice cream
“No.” Draco called out while Harry started laughing. “Why should we have slides? Our dungeon is rather flat, mate.”
“Someone taught you manners” Severus commented and chuckled, before copying the action as a sign of mutual respect. “Welcome to Slytherin, Harry Potter.”
Pansy smirked. “It sure did. I would say: Good job in raising a perfectly normal child.”
Pansy smirked. “Which is why I’m going to ask him today.” With that she walked out and it took Draco about five seconds, before he realized what that meant. Widening his eyes, he raced out of his room, almost crashing into Theodore, before evading him at the last second.
“Then what have I been telling you about my company?”
know about that?”
“I know” Draco answered and returned the grin.
The sentence which Draco thought was so stupid had been changed to something else, and Harry actually liked it very much.
“Oh, big words, bear!” Draco was impressed, when Millicent chuckled. Raising a questioning eyebrow at her, she explained quickly.
Draco had brought the letter back to the Head Auror, claiming that he had just seen it and decided to bring it back personally – unopened of course. His skills at opening a letter were a thousand percent better than Connors.
“As I said; official Ministry business. Can’t tell anyone.”
“I just wanted to know how you would ask someone out, if you liked them?” Strange how easy it was to ask that question...
To distract himself, he turned to Potter and frowned slightly. “So, what’s the story with the winery?”
“You need to think Slytherin, Draco! That could actually help you getting through the next months. Being friends with the Golden Boy could help you in all kind of ways. Maybe you could get your father out of Azkaban or…”
“Don’t worry, Draco. It’s perfectly fine.” He turned to Harry and smiled. “What flavor do you think it should have?”
Kevin shrugged his shoulders and chuckled. “He’s doing a lot of work for the company. Sometimes, he just needs a day off. It’s nothing new, so don’t worry.” He pulled a paper out of a folder. “Let’s talk about your experiences. You had two dates until now?”
How was he supposed to tell what had happened? He had never really dealt with what had happened. He had never really forgiven Harry for what he had done. For Merlin’s sake, he could have died!
“Anyone give you this, Harry? Hm?” Draco asked breathlessly, grinding back into Harry’s erection, making him groan senselessly.
"So what's for dinner? I'm starving!"
“Harry -,
"Draco? Wake up, Draco!" Harry was beyond perturbed as he tried to shake his husband awake.
“Don’t,” Draco pleaded.
“It’s NOT my frigging fault,” Draco spoke through gritted teeth.
“Thank you,” she smiled sweetly and threw a pinch of Floo powder into the hearth. “Meet you on the other side, Draco. Diagon Alley!”
“No, I meant, how much longer?” Draco emphasized and Harry let out an “Oh!” of understanding.
"I was already planning to meet him after my next session, 'Mione. I'll take care of everything, okay?" he cupped her face and smiled at her encouragingly while Ron sat behind her and hugged her.
"I'm sorry, really, but you have no choice in this, Draco. You will only be granted release if you're not a Malfoy," Harry said ruefully and with such sincerity that Draco momentarily suffered from emotional whiplash.
Harry Potter straightened his jacket again and sighed under his breath, leaning against the door frame. He couldn’t wait to get out of these terrible clothes and head to bed. He was happy that the wedding was going so well and that another client of his had successfully found a wife, however, weddings never were his things. No matter how beautiful they were – and this one was one of the most stunning ones he had been invited to. Even though he was technically working here anyway.
Draco noticed Aaron looking over to her quite amused. “You were talking to someone without introducing you?”
I’m in the office, finishing paperwork. I shouldn’t be gone longer than two or three hours. I didn’t wake you up, because you looked so peacefully asleep.
He snorted and shrugged his shoulders, making sure that Draco was still asleep comfortably. “One word: Bingo.”
Draco’s ward frowned but shrugged his shoulders. “Okay, what is it?”
Draco chuckled and quickly grabbed his hair, pulling it into a messy bun at the back of his head. “It’s crazy.” He sighed.
Draco sighed. “We have quite a full day, Severus. The best I can do is after dinner. But it might be too late by then. I mean, it’s Thursday, so he will age another year tomorrow.”
?!” Draco rolled his eyes.
Kingsley nodded and seemed rather impressed. “I would have never thought that my youngest team of Aurors could track down all free Death Eaters in less than a year.”
Parkinson looked up and frowned at him. “No. You should leave, maybe I’ll feel better then.”
Eric smiled softly and tried to stifle a yawn, even though he didn’t manage. “They are scary creatures, let me tell you that.” He smiled with his eyes closed and hummed. “They’re basically huge ravens with pitch black eyes and holes in their wings. They used to live in Germany, but travelled up to Sweden. People said they would kill and eat humans.”
He pulled his hand free and placed it around Draco’s neck, pulling him into another kiss, before he smirked against his lips. “Says the man who has been teasing me the whole evening. You have no idea how close I came to tearing off these clothes on your body right then and there and have everyone watch me getting you off in the middle of the Common Room.”
Harry stared at him, as if he had been talking in a different language. “Wizards? Like in a fairy tale?”
Draco chuckled. “Once again; don’t worry about waking me up, Harry. Sleep tight, now.”
The door opened with an almost comical sound and out of the shadows, a figure appeared. Out of the wardrobe walked Hermione. Draco frowned and it seemed as if the other two people did so as well. Hermione shouldn’t be Harry’s greatest fear, right?
“Then let’s get this fucking party started!” Pansy said it just as dark as Draco had answered. These relatives were going to regret ever having messed with their Harry!
“I’m also happy to be back.” Remus looked over the lake that was today exceptionally beautiful. He did quickly turn back to Harry and Draco, smirking at the latter. “How is your studying going? Transfiguration?”
“Yes?” Two voices sounded. Draco smirked at Harry, while the little Ravenclaw ran closer. “Sorry, Professor Potter-
“Instead of joining,
“You know what?” Draco grinned at Weaslette. “I stand corrected” he said, while he ruffled through Potter's hair fondly.
Opening his eyes, he looked up, though found the black haired man almost half asleep with closed eyes. That made Draco shiver and he smiled happily, placing his head back on the pillow. He yawned and tried to get even closer to Harry’s warm body, where he closed his eyes again.
Baby Potter looked up and laughed loudly, when he saw the situation at hand. Blaise snorted again, while Pansy smiled at the black haired baby wizard. She put both her feet onto the couch and leaned over so she could reach the Savior and ruffled through his hair. “You’re being a good boy, aren’t you?”
The other wizard actually seemed pissed that he couldn’t get him, though Draco wondered whether or not that was actually professional – actually he knew that it wasn’t professional. Kingsley gave him a warning glance and continued. However, he was interrupted before he could even get two words out.
Since the pain in his stomach wasn’t really getting better, Harry decided to just try and get up. Hopefully today was another good day. He wouldn’t like for Draco to see him go from a very good to a very bad day.
Harry tightened his hug around Draco, once he wanted to get up. “I’m not letting you go now!”
Draco frowned. “You didn’t?”
“Point taken” Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes. “You could have told me where you’re going.”
Placing the Chizpurfle into a magically sealed box, Draco stepped over a carpet and looked at the books, hoping they were in a state where he could move them without needing too much magic. The parasite needed quite a lot of magic for it to happily stay inside the box and since Draco hadn’t really used magic in the last ten years too much, he wasn’t sure how much strain he could put it under. Luckily, all six masterpieces seemed to be in a nice state.
Sorry for posting this here, but I just needed to tell you so you wouldn't think I'm ignoring this story. I actually like it, but I don't have time to continue. As soon as something changes I will delete this "chapter" and give you a real one.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco sip his Espresso and smiled to himself in triumph.
At his admission, something in Harry’s vicious demeanor changed. It was like watching a hurricane die down in an instant without a reason or an explanation. The Chosen One backed away from Draco, studying his own hands as if they were precious relics but were painted in filth, before storming out of the house. Only the echo of the front door banging remained as Draco allowed himself to cry aloud in the lonely confines of his prison that was Harry Potter’s house. He knew that Potter would be back with another apology and the same Healing Salve but until then, Draco decided to let his fears out completely so that when Potter was back, he'd be able to accept the man's kindness.
'Put him in his place, Harry. Tell him how much he deserves pain!'
"I deserve it," Draco whispered this time even though Harry didn't ask him to say it. Harry smirked in triumph.
Harry scoffed. He bent close to his husband, his hands gripping tightly the cold white railing of the hospital bed, their faces not more than five inches apart before hardening his face into one filled with such rage that Voldemort would be dying in his grave once again if Harry laid his eyes on him. And, Draco knew what was coming.
Since it had come down to this, Draco supposed there was no point in lying to either Ginny or himself. The thought of going out really did excite him. It also made him nervous in huge amounts. The ‘what if’ scenarios his mind conjured up were uncountable and none of them ended on a remotely positive note. And then there was a nagging question at the back of his mind – Did Harry know about this?
damn mug.
Without wasting another second, Draco pushed the cigarette into the Dark Mark's skull and the burn caused him to groan. He was high again. His burning flesh induced the same high nicotine had produced in him a few minutes ago and he plunged the butt in harder, twisting it, till his eyes watered.
Harry was waiting for a response Draco could never give. Not in this lifetime. The day he
Everyone congratulated the couple. Draco did too and he truly felt happy for the couple. They could have something which he couldn't have in his life. Not while married to Potter. There had been a time when all that mattered to him was to marry a pureblood woman and produce a Malfoy heir. Now that his name was just a history to be told during the darkest times, he couldn’t care less about an heir. Or a child, for that matter. Maybe, someday, Potter would want one and then, he’d look for a surrogate mother to carry his child. If Potter wanted one, Draco had no right to stop the man but he wasn’t so sure that he wanted to raise a child. He would just be forced into parenthood like he had been forced into being Potter’s husband.
“She’ll be up soon so you can come with me now. After she wakes up, we’ll be registering my baby girl’s name and other details. We chose to name her Rose, by the way. You know you’re her Godfather, right, Harry?”
day. Would he stay the same when his mind was crippled with agony or would he once again revert to his old self and hit Draco? And if that happened, Draco was sure that day would be his last, if there was no one to stop Harry, given Ronald and Granger were busy with their own problems. Draco gulped in fear and looked away. He didn’t want to take that chance with Harry.
“Please just leave,” Draco mumbled, trying to get up yet again but failing miserably. He huffed out irritably and made himself as comfortable as possible on the sofa, resting nude in an awkwardly spread position. The sex had left his already weak body completely exhausted and it would be a while before he regained his bearings. He only wished for Harry to leave so that when he did, Draco could deprecate himself thoroughly for bowing down to his extremely twisted desires. Then again, he wanted Harry to stay and tell him over and over again that they’d be all right, if not now, at least in the far future. It was his Father first, and now it’s Harry. Lucius might not have laid a hand on Draco once but the way he strutted around their Manor, pointing out Draco’s faults at every corner only spoke volumes about how disappointed he was as a Father in regards to his son. There seemed to be no hope for him as he always sought out the love and affection of the people who only abused him either verbally or physically.
, who wants to go shopping, of all things, with Harry’s current partner or obsession or whatever and a Malfoy at that! He wouldn’t giggle, ever but the situation did call for him to burst out laughing, a few droplets of coffee spilling from the corners of his mouth which he wiped away immediately with the back of his hand.
“Coffee with milk and cream, French toast with extra butter, and a bowl of freshly cut banana for one Harry Potter,” Draco announced as he set the tray in front of Harry.
Giving up on his hair and the comb which now had its teeth broken at a few places, Harry placed a stool beside Draco's side of the bed and sat down on it before taking Draco's left arm in his hands, their rings touching as he laced their fingers together.
Everything was too rough, too fast and Draco loved it. He felt needed once again. His depraved body sought out more of Harry, just like his magic which was now feeding off of Harry’s, and he unintelligibly found his hand resting on his husband’s thigh and gripping it tight, silently begging for more magic, more pleasure. Hard pleasure. After this high collapsed, Draco was positive that he would loathe himself for becoming the whore Harry wanted him to be but right then, he absolutely wanted nothing else other than the twisted and imaginary love and care his husband offered him in the name of sex. And Harry obliged Draco’s silent plea by roughing up his hips and tearing out yelps of pain and moans of gratification from his blonde husband laid out pliant underneath him.
“Nothing you say will ever make me forgive you for that,” Draco narrowed his eyes.
She couldn’t be more right that she already was. He wanted to change. He wanted to be a man who forgave himself so that he could be rid of his past transgressions. Yet, he could only see that road closed on him permanently after his miscarriage. Harry
Hermione had the sense to inform Harry before rushing to Draco’s aid and helping him heave out all the food that he ate not long ago.
Draco got a Remembrall from Ronald as a joke, shoes that changed color according to the dress you wore from George, and a protective charm bracelet from Hermione. Ginny and Thomas gifted the couple a flower vase that always kept the flowers fresh and alive until you took them out. Harry received a musical box from Hermione that would calm him down with its therapeutic music, according to her. Without an ounce of shame, George gave him a carton of various flavored and tingling condoms, complete with a set of flavored and tingling lubes and said, "Give me a detailed review, Harry," and winked at them. Draco never thought he'd be anymore redder than he was then. Neither did Harry. Though he was quite successful in maintaining his composure, Draco couldn't say the same for Harry as he watched the man mince his words in embarrassment.
“Point number two, I love that I am an Auror,” the smirk on her face intensified her round cheeks.
~ Wheezy
“This is why we need to stay as far away as possible. If you really mean it and want
“Well, think now. I’ll wait,” she lounged back in her chair as she observed Harry’s body language. Though a hero, she could tell that the man sitting in front of her had low self-esteem. Not as low as the patients she encountered to date, but low nevertheless. He couldn’t even pick out his positive traits. His hunched shoulders meant that he felt helpless all the time – maybe because something in his life was out his control, and she had the faintest idea what it was as soon as the Chosen One walked into her office. Anger without reason.
Harry shrugged noncommittally. “It doesn’t matter.”
"When is your birthday?" Harry asked Draco as he sat down on the sofa to cut the cake.
“Talk? What will we be talking about?”
He was tempted. His wand sat on the counter invitingly and he wanted to do what his counterpart was telling him to do. Yet, deep down, he knew that it was wrong. The person in the mirror is wrong about everything! He wasn't Harry Potter's whore. And Harry never intended to kill him. They just had too much bad blood between them to actually live together, that's all! After all, they hadn't the floweriest of moments in their past. For Merlin's sake, they had always been enemies and were at each other's throats for years! This incident was nothing new, right?
“His presence made me angry. All the frigging time! I was partly angry at myself for saving him from Azkaban. Draco deserved what he got for killing all those close to my heart and I saved him,” a couple of tears fell down Harry’s face and wiped them away furiously.
“It wasn’t pity and it wasn’t that I could relate myself to him in any way. If there is one person in this world who I cannot relate myself with, it would be Draco. We fought on opposite sides. He pledged his services to the wrong person despite being given a chance at freedom and safety. It was HIS choice which he hadn't even thought about for a minute,” Harry’s voice sounded dangerously cold and the reporters could physically feel that icy chill in the air around them.
“Please be seated, Ma’am. Your order number is five,” the boy passed a token to Ginny.
“What if I can’t complete your assignments or whatever?” Harry asked.
It wasn't your visits at first but the time you spent with me. I had no job. I was just a burden to you. You might not have said it outright but I knew it, my love. I could feel it whenever you talked about the stress involved in your job as an Auror. I respected you enough to not retort whenever you heaved a big sigh and said – 'You wouldn't know, Draco. So, what's for dinner?' Yes, I would not know because I was a culprit who wasn't allowed a job where I can supposedly work! But, it did not matter to me. I swerved out of our home with an air of determination and started looking for a job. I would take anything, even the lowest of jobs, just to understand you and be a man in your eyes. I did not want to be someone who smooched off your riches or the gold left to me after the Ministry raided my family's vault for reparations. It was hard trying to find a job without any support. I suppose now that I could've asked for your help but that wouldn't serve my purpose of trying to be on an equal footing with you. I did not know then what an ID was and how it was essential for me to get a job. But then, some muggles were kind enough to create a fake one for me, for a price and I gave them a few gold coins as payment. It got me a job and I earned muggle money. My Father would roll in his grave and call me names if he'd ever got to know that I live on muggle money. That wasn't my concern though. Your face filled with utter shock and elation after I told you that I was working as a Helper at a café a few blocks away made me realize that I was finally at peace, and it feels like home in your strong arms.
Harry kept telling himself.
“I want to know why you offered me two choices, Harry,” Draco said, placing Harry’s glasses back where they belong.
"Really? It doesn't look like it though," she came closer and Draco could smell a vanilla scent wafting from her. She was probably baking a cake for all of them, he thought inwardly.
Do you remember?
And I remember a whole lot more.
"How long before the baby?" he asked as he stood up weakly, holding on to Hermione's hand for support.
, the voice rang again but gently, this time. How chivalrous of Harry, Draco thought, to be kind to the man he was about to kill! Nevertheless, Draco’s body went limp as he prepared himself for the final kill – himself.
Harry seemed to not have heard what he uttered and Draco wasn’t bothered. He sighed in defeat. “Fine,” he grumbled before marching past Harry, towards the staircase, knowing well that Harry would soon follow and catch up with his him.
She winked at Harry. “Oh no, don’t you worry. My mother named me Charlene Genevieve, but what kind of a name is that? So I’ve been calling myself Charlie ever since I can remember.”
No, it was a great feeling. He was finally able to start his family! Harry smirked as he felt the magical non-apparition barriers on his skin, when he passed through them. Maybe he should thank Hermione for that amazing feeling.
My son shall receive the contents of vault 10777. Its documents include Harry’s birth certificate, a few birthday presents that were too fragile to keep around a toddler. There are also a few other valuable items in there, including some of the Potter’s patents and everything else which could be helpful to my son. There is also an unsigned magical marriage document so that should my son desire to marry with his parents blessing, the document will give our statement. Harry, I know you might not want to find out whether or not we approve of your partner choice – you do not have to do something like this.
“Well Harry, I
“That sounds terrifying” Harry answered and sighed. “But I don’t have any memories alone… I have a huge mush of memories from all kind of different ages. How can I comb through all of these to find the one that is making me happy?”
Harry burst out laughing while Millicent shook her head. “
“I’m sorry for not protecting you” Draco finally whispered into the silence of the night.
Ron next to him laughed and placed his arm around his neck. “Really? My memory must be flawed then as well, since I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Hi bear! How are you doing? Can you see
“You can’t stay up there forever, Harry!” Blaise called up there, when Harry showed his face between the branches.
Even though Draco understood her, he also understood Harry – a little bit at least. Before Harry could say something, Severus called for them to meet in the kitchen again. Well, the Golden Boy sighed and walked to the kitchen.
“You didn’t kill him, Harry.”
Yawning, Draco turned on his side, not removing the arm he had over his ward, to keep him safe, and grinned at his childhood best friend. “Alright, Pans. Next time he comes looking for me after a nightmare I’ll send him to you.”
“What story?”
Taking another sip of the tea, he suddenly stopped in the middle of his action, though not before swallowing. What was that?! Why did he just say something like that? How was he being so out of his mind?
“Not even close. I’m oblivious as well. Pansy told me this morning I should finally go and talk to you instead of staring at you.” Malfoy frowned slightly. “I wasn’t aware it was
“She’ll have to go in front of the Wizengamot to defend herself.”
Draco wasn’t sure what he should do. He had spent the happiest time of his life in Scotland, but he wasn’t sure if he was even allowed back into their community. For almost two weeks he had stayed in the guest room of Pansy’s new apartment, but she had thrown him out, because she didn’t like him moping around. He had moved to Thedore, then Blaise and in the end, stayed in a room in Gregory’s apartment. He had spent almost two months like that and finally his friends had enough.
The Gryffindor smirked and shrugged his shoulders. “Then I hope you don’t mind a Gryffindor tagging along.”
“I’m talking about my past, no one’s hurting me now.” He looked to the Common Room and cast a quick
“I’ll go back to bed and come back in a few minutes, you go eat” he offered.
Harry was unsure of how people could even focus on anything. There was another memory playing from one of the students that had been fighting. He looked over the castle walls right into the court yard; Voldemort walking up at the castle, Hagrid next to him with Harry in his arms. He really did look dead. He heard the screams from his friends and turned away from the memory.
Madam Pomfrey smiled and put a bandage around it. “It will not stay here forever. Keep the bandage on for about twenty four hours. You’re aging so quick it should be helping in removing the scar. It was a ritual, not an actual magical scar. You’re lucky.” With that she nodded at the two of them and walked back to her desk.
Potter stepped closed and shook his head. “No, I don’t. I didn’t even tell you what happened to me. Benjamin knows so much more than you do.”
Draco looked up, slightly uncomfortable, almost scared and swallowed a lump. Why was he so nervous to talk to Molly Weasley? He quickly got to his feet, even though Harry was hanging around his neck and propped the toddler on his arm, so he could continue talking into his ear. Which he luckily decided to take a break from.
Okay, so Draco had a terrible secret. Not really terrible, but he would never ever want anybody to find out about it. He loved… Muggle romance movies. They were terrible – nobody ever met like that in real life anyway and how they portrayed the love and things that happened had always annoyed him.
Smirking, Draco turned the teddy bear over and checked the seam. “All good” he said satisfied and held out the bear to Padfoot. “Mr. Cuddlesworth is back to normal, Paddy.”
Harry shook his head. “How do you know so much about this stuff?”
Well, shit. Where was Pansy when you needed her for a good story telling and explanation?! And why didn’t he remember earlier? Maybe he had remembered but he didn’t want to freak out anybody. Looking around, Draco only found some smaller Slytherins who all were not really what he needed right now.
Harry grinned, when Hermione stepped back and smiled at him. She looked at him, as if she was inspecting a very rare diamond and placed her hands at her hips. “I haven’t seen you in such a long time!”
Draco chuckled and rolled his eyes. “Thank you, E... Sirius. I’m pretty sure they were stoked.”
Since Harry was so secretive, Draco frowned at him. “Death Eaters?” he offered and even Pansy frowned, putting her legs onto the couch as well.
Good evening Remus
And the final transformation was Draco. Widening his eyes, Draco found an almost exact copy of himself standing there, scoffing at Harry. “You think you’re so high and mighty, now don’t you? You’re not worth
Harry frowned at it and looked at his husband slightly confused. “And? You make a lot of potions, Draco. Why is this one special?”
“Probably” Harry shrugged his shoulders. “It’s the first time where I feel free. Last summer, I’ve talked to Severus about it a lot. And… talking helps. I don’t know if it ever gets easier or normal.”
Draco smiled at her. That explained a lot. “Nice to meet you. I’m... Benjamin Brown.” There was an obvious pause between him telling her his name... He needed to fix it, though before he could say something, she chuckled.
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Half believable, actually. The only person slightly out of character would be Millicent. I’m not sure if she would have helped Blaise getting chocolate if Pansy hadn’t told her to do so.”
Hermione chuckled. “It was meant for Draco” she explained as Ron walked closer and stepped behind her so he could hug her from behind.
“I’m sure.” Harry nodded. She copied his actions and seemed to come to the same conclusion. When he turned to look at Draco, he walked closer as well. Draco smiled softly at Harry, which made him return the smile. “I for one can say that I’m willing to try with the man I love” he added and Draco felt so many emotions rising that he had no ideas how to control them. He was tearing up and cleared his throat, walking over faster to Harry and hugging him.
Nodding weakly, Draco traced Harry’s cheekbone, making him look at him again. “True. You did look a little evil, but she had it coming. And it’s not as if you’re running around torturing everyone you see. You had a good reason to do so.”
Harry shrugged his shoulders as he turned to Theodore. “I had a nightmare last night and went to Ron, but he wasn’t really helping. So I came here.”
McGonagall walked closer and seemed a little upset. She was holding a scroll and magically opened it in front of Draco. “Madam Pomfrey did a ‘Magical Guardian’s Test’. His magic chose you as his guardian.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t want to go back. They don’t even know my name.”
So, he pulled Potter onto his lap and got hold of his wand without taking it out of his sleeve. “Should we shower them with a little snow, bear? What do you think? Wet, cold snow?”
The old man took some measurements, while Draco sat down on a small chair and watched his ward closely. Something seemed weird all of a sudden. However, Draco couldn’t really pinpoint it. He only realized that Harry had some problems with Bridger touching him. Even if he just told him to turn around and touched his shoulders to indicate where he should turn to, Harry would startle, but follow what he wanted to have done. Draco needed to investigate sometime.
Before he could think more, his husband grinned. “The way you move makes me…”
Teddy agreed. “He does! He loves you the most!”
Before anything else could happen, Dag hooted again and flew up, towards a man approaching Hogwarts. Draco quickly recognized him and smiled broadly, walking towards that man.
ask questions.”
Draco carefully removed the dust from the spines and read their names.
He had arrived a little early to talk to High Executor Nelson, and she had been quite surprised to find Harry Potter as a baby. She was very welcoming and just now entered the room again, though nobody else had been with her.
I plead thee. Answer me. Let mine heart heal with thy love.
Potter looked completely gobsmacked, before shaking his head and grinning at Draco. “Dada!”
Harry rolled his eyes, though accepted whatever he could get.
Draco frowned and turned to look at Weasley. For everyone else this could have looked like he didn’t believe what he heard from this Gryffindor. In reality, he was completely blown away by Weasley
Harry confirmed Draco’s suspicion, when he shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know, I’ve never seen that!”
Draco nodded and took out a little notebook.
Ginny smirked. “So, first you say how much you hate me writing letters and now you want me to write a letter?” She shook her head, though she still had that smirk on her lips. “I’ll do it, if you buy me any couch I want.”
Draco rolled his eyes over such a stupid sentence, but sighed. “Yes, I did.”
Pansy had brought in two slimy looking Slytherins. Blaise and Millicent were covered in green glue like material and it kept dripping from their skins. It looked as if they were highly poisonous and well, their glares could definitely kill.
“I did” Harry smirked. “In all honesty though, I’ve been in love with him for I think three years. How come you’ve never realized that?”
“Draco Malfoy, I suppose, is the patient?” he asked first.
"Granger, do you know what you're doing?" he asked and then chuckled at his stupidity. Of course, the know-it-all knew what to do. How foolish of him!
“Eastoft, please,” Hermione gasped.
Harry didn't expect Draco to reciprocate his feelings when he admitted that he liked the man. That would be a long road they needed to travel but if anything would bring them closer than they already were, Harry would choose it. So, he kept on kissing his husband, hoping that Draco would understand how much Harry needed him. Whatever Harry did in the past or would do in the future, he hoped that Draco had in it him to carry all his burdens and mistakes so that they could live a life together, no matter how deviant it would turn out to be. Neither of them was perfect, and Harry needed someone - he needed Draco, to face his imperfections as Harry couldn't do it alone.
Now feeling many pairs of eyes at them, Harry let go of Draco and cleared his throat. “The hospital isn’t an apt place for our discussion, Draco. I don’t know
“I feel so angry all the time,” it was the second time in his life he spoke this statement aloud but the one listening to him wasn’t Dumbledore. It was Mind Healer Arya Reynolds. And the one causing the rampant anger inside him wasn’t Voldemort. It was himself and his untreated fears which now manifested as the evil inside his heart.
Maybe, living with Potter wouldn’t be that bad after all.
“Damn it! Slow down, Harry,” tears of pain gushed out of Draco’s eyes and Harry lapped at them like a thirsty man.
“Okay,” he answered, turning the book over in his hands, thinking of what he could possibly write in it.
“I know it isn’t
'I want to be alone tonight. Can you take the children home, Ginny, please?' I plead so that only my wife can hear.
“I’m fine, thank you,” he replied, subtly pulling away from Harry.
"Sod off, Potter," Malfoy rasped and broke into a coughing fit for speaking those two words.
“Does that mean Draco can perform magic now?” Harry asked, his heart fluttering in happiness at the good news.
When Draco didn't get any response from his husband, he laughed mirthlessly and despite everything that happened between them, in the heat of the moment, before he slipped into unconsciousness, concluded that Harry was a way better drug than nicotine and he could get addicted to this one instead, if only he stayed after. Maybe, there was a one hundred percent chance that he'd regret ever thinking so, but at the moment, he didn't care for he was lonely and needed Harry in all his glory to satiate his heart and magic.
“It was all you, love.”
Harry closed his eyes. It was too dark for him. He felt his throat close and his breathing quickened out of fear that something might hide in the shadows. Only a few seconds later, Malfoy lit up the room and looked at all of them, even though Harry thought that his gaze lingered on him a little bit longer. He closed his eyes and tried to control his breathing, so his heart could hopefully slow down again.
Daphne crossed her legs and smiled at him. “So, you’re going to get your service dog now? What will happen, when he’s here?” She motioned rather accidentally towards Draco. Her action was so skilled that Harry was sure nobody would be able to realize what she meant with her action.
Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “Are you telling me that you don’t think Potter makes a cute baby?” She grinned at him as if her seemingly shallow question had nothing to do with the fact Potter was still an annoying human being – even in baby form.
Parkinson shook her head. “We were scared, Draco! They just don’t believe it.”
“Actually yes, we wanted to talk to Granger and Weasley” Pansy said and smiled.
Draco nodded. “Don’t worry, I would have probably reacted the same if any of my friends were babies in your custody.”
Draco placed a kiss on his cheek. “How about that Christmas market now? I think we could both need a little bit of Christmas happiness.”
Maybe Pansy and Millicent were successful? Draco rushed up the stairs, almost crushing into his Potion’s Professor and came to a halt a little bit away from the doors to the Great Hall. Severus had called out to him and so he turned around.
“Nice of you to come by” Harry chuckled and winked.
Harry
“Can I stay here?” Harry asked, lifting his eyes again.
Draco ran till his legs gave out. Harry caught up to his trembling weak form.
“Here’s a chocolate frog for your success,” Arya held one in her palm and Harry took it graciously.
“Yeah, okay. We can discuss this later,” Harry said calmly, wrapping his arm around Draco’s shoulders, like a half-embrace.
She visibly winced at Draco's harsh statement and her stature showed how sorry she was for leaving Draco to his devices after Harry almost killed him. She should've been there for him despite all the bad blood between them. Besides, it was in the past and as adults, after almost a decade, Hermione wanted to let go. To forgive, if possible, where you could never forget.
They were happy, weren’t they? Or was it all merely an illusion? Cooking for Harry, eating together, movie nights with him when he excitedly but unknowingly spilt popcorn and beer all over the sofa and the floor, and Merlin, the sex after - which always was incredibly suffocating and pleasurable and most of all, intimately painful… Draco couldn’t understand what it was he felt towards Harry after all. Then again, he supposed, he was trying to justify his feelings for the man by carefully picking out the good times they spent together.
“Why now, Draco? You weren’t eager to know
When Draco nodded in acceptance, he said “Good,” and promptly left the house without a destination in mind.
"Yes. We'll sign the papers and please complete our bond," Harry's stoic self was back.
"You don't need to if you don't want to," Harry snapped, his back to Draco. He was busy trying to tame his nest of a hair with a comb so small that it wouldn't even touch his scalp. He resolved to get a new comb - a bigger one this time; maybe some gel or wax too just so he could push his hair into some direction.
"This is for what we would've become before you spoiled everything," Harry proclaimed before proceeding to give Draco a black eye.
Thin cords of strong rope coiled around Draco’s wrists and held them in place. Draco’s wriggling like a caught fish only worsened the condition of his bound wrists but did nothing to keep Harry at bay.
I hope you remember me.
Draco laughed mirthlessly at the absurdity. Harry KNEW how loss looked like and he didn't particularly need to marry Draco for that. For heck's sake, he lost many people who were dear to him on the battlefield and no one better than Harry knew about Loss and the gaping black hole it always left behind.
“What do you need?” Draco managed to ask though all he wanted right then was to escape Harry’s hold. Draco's voice broke the wall Hermione's voice built inside his head and he chose to go with the flow he and Draco established. Harry desperately wanted Draco. By the looks of it, Draco wanted him too. Any conversation could be resumed after they had their fill of each other.
. They decided that they would take some time apart for healing, though there wasn’t much of that on Draco’s end and he wasn’t sure how good Harry had gotten with the help of his Mind Healing sessions. Did Harry’s condition not improve at all these past few days?
For that, neither of them had an answer.
Draco sighed, the fight leaving his body in a huff. These people never failed to give him a hammering headache. He closed his eyes and rubbed circles on his glabella with his index in order to curb the pain spreading around. When he finally gathered enough strength to open his eyes and face his unwelcome guest, he saw a mug of coffee hovering right in his line of sight.
Draco nodded in greeting and made his way towards the small open window on the far side of the tiny room.
"Yeah, I guess so," Draco replied and Hermione pointed her wand at a sleeping Harry.
“Draco?” a voice filtered in from behind him suddenly and Draco stiffened. So did Ronald. Draco could recognize the voice even in his sleep. Harry.
"Dra -,” Hermione started to address the blonde. She wanted to tell him that he was nothing like Lucius. Draco was better and he did better than most others. He was reformed and this incident would never define what he once was or wasn’t.
, not Malfoy. And no, you may not.”
“I want you to rediscover your love for flying. Pick up your old broomstick, or buy the new Nimbus Swift 2007 edition and fly, Mr. Potter. Check?”
Thank you for all your warm Kudos!
“Ah, thanks, Draco,” Harry took the paper from his hands and feigned glancing through it as he ate his breakfast.
Eraramech - I'm really so sorry to disappoint you but this is a dark fic and not a fluffy one. If it's any consolation, it will get better as I mentioned in the tags.
Harry was swaying on his feet, blinded by unadulterated anger towards Draco and the latter found no escape. Draco's fingers clenched his wand so tight that he feared he'd break the wood into two. To quote that he was afraid would just be an understatement as he could literally feel the flames of Harry's fury licking him in entirety.
“Like what you see?” she asked.
“Merlin, help me!” Draco whispered against Harry’s neck, tentatively licking it and savoring the forgotten flavor of his husband. It tasted like Heaven; better even.
“But?” she prompted and waited for Harry to continue.
“Congratulations, Ron!” Harry stood up and pulled his gangly ginger friend into a tight embrace, patting him on the back in ecstasy. He held onto Ron by his shoulders after pulling away. “How’s Hermione? She okay?”
Draco watched the two friends leave towards the stairs, deep in conversation, and wondered if he should stay or leave. If he considered Weasley’s invitation, he could follow them to the ward Granger’s been put in and glimpse at the nauseating sweetness from afar. They’ve earned it, haven’t they? Not like him at all who deserved nothing but a Hellhole deep enough to break all his bones after a voluntary fall or a contemptuous kick into the tunnel.
“Draco has no magic inside him,” Harry corrected and his friends shook their heads in assent.
“Yes, Harry. It’s barmy but that’s what we all think,” Ron came to his Mom’s support and Harry clucked his tongue in annoyance before applying new tactics.
“No,” Draco murmured and Harry punched him so hard that he saw stars, literally.
“What do you mean by that?” Harry asked, confused.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
Draco exhaled a big cloud of smoke before saying, “It reminds me of what I’ve done, the choices I made. Just like the Mark.”
"Clothes. Off. Now," Harry was reduced to single syllables as all he could think of was molding their skins together.
Barbarians. They threw questions upon questions at him without mercy or consideration for his feelings. The worst of the lot award still went to Rita Skeeter, the old hag. All the money she earned went for youth potions. If only she utilized that money to mend her brain and her filthy frigging mouth, Harry would be rejoicing!
his mind repeated and without a second thought, Draco’s face flashed in front of his eyes.
"You stink, Potter," Draco pointed out harmlessly as a matter-of-fact.
'I'm truly sorry, Draco. I hope you will get better someday. Harry is married now. He's happy. I don't want you to spoil that for him. After a lifetime of war and bloodshed, he deserves to be happy,' she said.
Gently, Harry picked him up in his arms. He could’ve used a levitation spell but at the moment, he wanted to hold the blonde in his arms and whisper how sorry he was. He settled Draco on their mattress and went into the bathroom to wet a hand towel. He cleaned Draco’s face and the chafed skin of his wrists and ankles before draping him under a warming charm.
"After Ron and 'Mione took me away to their home," Harry started, chancing a glance at Draco once again, referring to him beating Draco to a pulp as decently as possible, "they forced me to see a Mind Healer."
“This is my favorite,” Harry said, pointing at a neon green bottle of Mountain Dew.
“I think I’ve sprained my back,” he moaned as he took the witch’s hand.
"I always thought you hated my glasses," Harry smirked playfully.
“No, we’re not having this conversation anymore,” Draco rummaged in his sock drawer for a cigarette and after he found one, he rushed to open the window and lit it with sweaty shaking hands.
Somehow, it sounded like a blatant lie to Draco’s ears.
“I usually am more immaculate than this,” Draco commented, allowing Harry’s hold to linger on him for a bit longer before he set right his clothes.
They were sat next to each other and the warmth from the place where their sides – from shoulder to thigh to toe touched, felt good. Therapeutic.
“Ah, yes, my apologies. Mr. Potter, your husband is physically fine. But we are not sure about the baby. So, we need to monitor him for some time before we can come to a conclusion,” he replied.
Bloody Graphic sex (No penetration).
“I’m learning to live with my failures, Draco,” Harry spoke when he couldn’t take Draco’s silence anymore. He needed to make Draco understand that both of them needed help if they wanted things to work between them. Harry just hoped that the burning in the back of his mind was anything but the temper he knew was oncoming because of Draco’s stubbornness. “Just because I defeated the Dark Lord doesn’t make me the perfect man to walk this Earth. In fact, I’ve only gotten worse. I hurt people who love and care for me. I hurt you,” he lifted his head and a few droplets of water rolled down from his wet, now tamed hair. “I hurt you, didn’t I?” he asked.
“Who are you to keep my husband away from me?” he muttered darkly.
His part in the Wizarding War was huge. Had he not found a way to infiltrate the Hogwarts castle, one which he felt like home, there would not have been those many deaths. Every single person that fell, they did so on his heart and Draco promised to carry their weight to his grave. He wished for death to befall him so that he’d be free of his crimes yet life was not so forgiving. He loathed himself for choosing Harry the moment he walked into his cell, yet, Draco believed that only Harry could set him free from his contrition. In the beginning, he tried to get away from the sheer unadulterated bursts of anger Harry directed at him randomly solely because he couldn’t believe the great Harry Potter had in him the will to hurt anyone. Then he had to make himself remember that the man he saw was a boy when he killed the Dark Lord; a boy who let his wrongful peers and above rightfully serve their time in Azkaban. Once he established it in his mind, Draco invited the pain. Every punch Harry landed on him was liberating in a way others would call twisted. Every drop of blood he shed sang choruses of praise which had connotations of pleading for forgiveness for the bloodshed of many men and women he voluntarily caused.
Shacklebolt watched them with an expression that was unfathomable and cleared his throat when their exchange was finished.
“What the hell are you looking at?” Draco snapped at the senile witch who was now smirking.
His gaze was hard and challenging. It was as if he was asking Draco to say something against the deed he’d been doing. And the last vestiges of Draco holding on to their relationship snapped. He never felt that he deserved happiness. After all that he had done to countless muggles, wizards, and witches, no matter how unwillingly, he never thought that his life would gift him with happiness. So, he made peace when he was thrown into Azkaban. The punishment felt liberating to him though he had been scared beyond wits. He couldn’t imagine a pain greater than losing himself in the Azkaban or losing his parents but as his eyes found evidence of Harry rejecting him in the most heinous way possible, Draco let his heart shatter into a million pieces and kept repeating to them that he deserved it for all his crimes of the past. This was the payback he’d been offered. It was his retribution. Maybe, this was why Harry had brought him out of Azkaban. To make him suffer by giving everything and then taking it all away in a jiffy without an ounce of kindness.
“Your apology will fix nothing,” a spark of anger flared inside Draco and it spread throughout his body like wildfire. “You want to know the reason? Here you go then. You.”
"I'll be going with you?" Draco asked half in apprehension and half in the excitement that he would finally be walking in the streets, taking in their structures and the scenery around them.
“When are you going to return Sebastian?” he asked curtly.
“She’s upstairs in the Delivery Ward, I guess,” Harry said.
“Maybe’s good. That means you want to fly,” she answered.
“I don’t understand you,” Draco shook his head exasperatedly. Harry’s moods and words to him were worse than an unexpected whiplash. Just a few moments ago, the man was quivering with unbidden rage, and then was jumping in joy and now; he’s acting all saint-like. Like the Savior Draco always despised.
“I need to speak to him privately and oh, I don’t owe you an explanation. Out, now!” anger laced her voice like venom as she stood there in front of them, pointed her manicured index finger at the door.
"Good day to all," Draco wished with a smile and Harry squeezed his hand in encouragement.
“God! You know what I’ll choose. You know!” Draco stressed and Harry could clearly see Draco’s rapidly reddening face even in their dimly lit room.
So let me tell you that I shall always remember, Draco.
Draco was at a loss for words. They already had this discussion. Another one would entirely be fruitless and a waste of time. Why couldn’t Harry understand that? What would it take for Harry to let go of him? Draco would go back to Azkaban any day if it meant the separation would do both of them at least a modicum of good.
"Does Harry know?" Draco observed that Ron was in his Auror robes. His arrival must've triggered the wards the Ministry placed on the Manor, Draco concluded. But he didn't understand why Harry hadn't removed the Ministry wards after purchasing the Manor legally.
Suddenly conscious of her gaze, he scratched the white line where once his wedding ring sat.
“The baby?”
“You could’ve given him at least that. You have Lordship over all his estates even before your marriage so why didn’t you give him the tiniest of reprieves?”
By evening, Harry was back with a bouquet of white and red roses and an apologetic look on his face.
“Are you okay?” she asked, her eyes straying towards his hands.
Harry nodded his head.
“Filth like you don’t belong here,” her batty voice quavered not in fear like Draco’s did but merely because of her age. Yet her voice had a derisive edge to it which Draco couldn’t ignore.
“I told you I’ll answer your every question,” Harry reiterated, momentarily forgetting that he wanted to talk Draco into seeing a particular Mind Healer.
Ron could see Draco calculating his options. The man was visibly trembling and Ron didn’t want to imagine or know why. Besides, he already knew and saw enough. A part of him could already guess why Draco was so overcome with fear. Harry. There had been a time when all of them were far from okay but they recovered. In retrospect, Ron felt utterly ashamed and guilty for leaving Harry to his own devices. He now believed that, in an attempt to get better, some part of Harry’s mind only repressed his trauma from the war as the people around him got help and walked out of the Darkness. A lot of what-ifs took up space in Ron’s mind but there was nothing he could do about it now. He could only think about what needed to be done henceforth.
And now, that he finally knew his actual name, Draco was sure that nothing could tear them apart ever again.
Chuckling, Harry finally said out loud what had bothered him the whole day. “I was thinking about a way to get Nicolai.”
“I…” Harry licked his lips, knowing full well that there was one topic where they couldn’t see eye to eye. “In my future, I see children.”
Minerva chuckled. “I had a feeling it was because of that game. Well, I’m glad you’re having fun; that was all I had intended.”
As they left, Harry grinned and turned to Draco. “Do you think I can change her hair too? Maybe if I concentrate really hard?”
Harry rubbed his forehead, accidentally spreading the ink to his head as well. “Hi Dray, why are you still awake?”
Harry could see how Draco tried his hardest to keep a grin hidden. He rolled his eyes, though smiled weakly as well. Motioning to the fire place, he continued. “And I took my fireplace off the Ministry network when I retired to figure out what’s wrong with me. The only people knowing how to get here are Hermione and Ron and they’re on holiday again, so they won’t be here for a few days or maybe even weeks. Who knows anymore.”
And so he quickly stitched it, while Harry was once again facing another dilemma. He had wanted to quit the Aurors a few months ago. Now was definitely the time to do so. Ron could have died! He had a small baby girl at home! If he had died tonight... Harry would have never been able to let go of this guilt.
A hand on his shoulder made him look up. Pansy was kneeling in front of him and smiled weakly. “I know, Dray. I know.”
He quickly helped Harry to his feet and they walked up to the Infirmary, where Madam Pomfrey for whatever reason seemed fully awake. Maybe she had somehow calculated them arriving around now. The mediwitch took a quick look and made Harry lie down on a bed, wrist towards her. Draco stood on the other side of the bed, holding his ward’s hand.
Draco smirked. “I found some pre-made Polyjuice Potion from the Black family. I took that and went out then. Are you happy now?”
“She’s not my mother anymore. In fact, she’s not even my family. And neither are you.” Draco felt his anger slowly rise and he calmed himself quickly. At least his former father couldn’t look inside their apartment and see Draco’s little angel or their baby boy. He was going to fight to death for them. And he knew Harry would do the same.
Turning back to his ex, Potter smiled a fake sweet smile. “See? No threats being said in this pub. If you want to eat something, we’re open in exactly ninety minutes.”
Draco left the library again, way too early to get Harry from his healer session, so he walked back into the dungeons, looking for Pansy. Inside the Common Room, almost everyone sat around a community game and they were loudly laughing, playing and discussing different topics.
Shrugging his shoulders lightly, Draco smiled. “Reminding myself that he’s no longer here. That I am safe, I have my friends around here. I think about how I survived the war, but he didn’t.”
I really like this story and I hope you start to like it as well!
“It’s important to get married early, and you’ve already wasted too  much time in your life.”
He hadn’t immediately seen Harry only after a few moments, where he wandered down another path, hidden by the rocks on which the castle was built, did he see a shadowy figure lying in the grass.
“Fine. He can do that inside.”
“Bring Draco too!” she called after him.
Anyway, thank you for staying with me (and the story) through this!
“Oh, I thought I might find you here” a familiar voice sounded.
“I hope I didn’t wake you” Harry said, seemingly startling the Slytherin. There was a hint of fear in his eyes for just a second, before it was gone again, replaced by an incredible warmth Harry had never seen before. Especially not on this man.
Hermione frowned. “And how have you figured out that someone took Harry as a base or this spell? Maybe it’s someone different?”
Frowning, he turned and followed her voice. She stood next to the kitchen entrance and pointed up the stairs, which led to a second level inside this apartment. “You need to see this, Dray!”
“Yeah, mate” Ron nodded, even though he didn’t seem to know what he should do with his expression. Harry was happy that they still somehow were there for him.
Ron Weasley
Opening the book, he found a very neat handwriting. It couldn’t have been Harry’s fast and messy one he had seen at Hogwarts, right?! Draco took a sip of his tea, closing his eyes. He couldn't suppress a groan at the sensation of this amazing tea and needed probably almost a minute until he started reading.
“I have absolutely no clue what you’re talking about.” He winked at Draco and started working on different tables, while Draco quickly excused himself.
Draco rolled his eyes, as he turned to Neville’s wife. “Hannah, please. Don’t buy everything he’s telling you. There is no strawberry inside and nothing close to berries. It’s wine for Merlin’s sake!”
“Severus came by and got Lily to go shopping for Hogwarts and Caellum wanted to go as well, even if he’s not going to Hogwarts for another three years, but you can’t separate these two now, can you?”
The Slytherin stared at him blankly and whistled then. “Shit. Next time you really need to warn me before you tell me a story like that. But why did you tell me that?”
Harry looked at Ron and raised one eyebrow. “Is that mind erasing thing dangerous?”
Jumping from surprise, Draco faced to where the voice had come from. Harry stood there, frowning slightly at him. He was still wearing his pyjamas and his favourite teddy was in his arms.
Potter nodded silently, before shrugging his shoulders. “Don’t worry, Benjamin. I’m not falling in love with you. I’m just a fairly happy person. People tend to think it’s love.”
The moment he entered his office and looked at everything, he knew what to do. Walking around the desk, he sat down, quickly writing a letter to Kingsley and the Head Auror. He then shrunk down all of his belongings and put them into a small bag. The paperwork, he looked through and finished the ones that were the fastest.
So, he turned to the scenery in front of them. They were surrounded by forest and with the singing birds and the deep blue sky; this early spring day seemed to be the most perfect one yet. Nott held out a compass and motioned towards the place they needed to check out. And so, they followed Nott’s lead through the quiet forest. The cracking branches under their feet were probably scaring away all wild animals and within a few minutes they had safely reached the end of the woods.
Harry climbed down from Draco’s lap and walked over to the tart, pointing at the piece he would like to have and while Molly gave him this piece, the door opened and two identical people entered, stopping once they saw Potter. Draco was already suspicious. He did not like the curious glances they were throwing at each other, even though they also looked very curiously at the presents under the Christmas Tree in the corner.
He had especially liked to see his former class mates at a loss for words. How they just stood there, while Draco and Harry had basically screamed at each other. It was amazing! And so, Harry lay there on the floor, looking up the rather cloudy sky, Padfoot laying next to him, seemingly enjoying his life to the fullest. Harry grinned and ruffled through his fur, happily. This class reunion sure was the best one he could have imagined.
“Pizza’s here!” she called through the offices and Harry grinned, when Draco appeared from wherever he had been. They all sat down in the company kitchen, which was actually a rather good one. Sometimes, Harry would teach the rest of his buffoons how to cook and it was always absolutely funny and amazing.
“I love you too, bear.”
“Right, the will from James Fleamont Potter has been found recently, hidden in a vault at Gringott’s. Here are the paragraphs that are important for the present people” she looked at the will and started reading. “
Draco widened his eyes. “I forgot the silencing charm! How did that happen?!”
Remus chuckled. “I guess Slytherin could use that? Especially after the war; your house has been blamed for too much.”
“But Draco went with someone to…” Hannah shook her head and looked at her husband. “Did you know? You always looked so suspicious whenever I wanted to talk with you about their relationship.”
The silence was onerous and no one really knew what to say next. That was until Gregory had enough of this weirdness in his home. “How is he doing? What is he doing? Rumour is, he found a boyfriend somewhere in Canada.”
“To be honest, I’ve always wanted to be a Herbology professor here.” Dean blushed and shrugged his shoulders again. “Everything I did was to one day get that job. I was going to write an application for next year’s job offer – I heard Professor Sprout will be leaving with McGonagall and then… Blaise said he got the job just by asking you…”
As predicted, the worker seemed genuinely upset. “You don’t understand: He’s unable to show trust or even to let someone close to him. We have to feed him by throwing his food at him…” He threw his hands in the air, though stopped in the middle of doing so.
Boy nodded. “They do that. I’m fine, thank you.”
The school uniform fit him so well, and he could still see that Harry was ripped under his shirt. Too late did he realize that he had stared at Harry’s stomach for a while. Draco wet his lips and turned back to Harry, slightly flushed.
“Igo Tago? Ah, I see” Mrs Williams answered and smiled. “Well,
“Exactly” McGonagall said, though clearly she had heard this information for the first time today. “Madam Pomfrey will need to have him checked regularly; she’ll tell you when you have to be back with your ward. For now, I have enlarged your room and tasked the elves with putting a crib in there. Maybe you should spend a little time with your ward and try to get to know him.”
His best friend chuckled. “Have fun, then. Maybe also sleep, if possible?”
Draco looked worriedly over to his ward sitting between Pansy and Blaise. It had been two days since he had woken up with the nightmare of the Dark Lord. And it had been two days since he had stopped properly eating. Pans had made sure to give him healthier food so that he would at least eat healthy. And Theodore had continued sneaking food from the kitchen, mostly sweets in hopes that Harry would eat that. Nothing had worked.
Draco sighed and leaned back in the arm chair. “That’s a hell of a good question, Pansy. I don’t know. I honestly have no idea what’s going on and how I can improve anything or…”
“Oh, I’m sorry about that” she said in a not really apologetically voice. “You’re Joseph Cambell, right?” The Hufflepuff nodded half-heartedly. “Thank you, Cambell, that’ll be fifty points from Hufflepuff.”
“I like, when you make me feel good, Draco” Harry finally said when they left their hiding spot and walked up towards the headmistress’ office. “But I prefer it not to happen when just a thin curtain is separating us from other people.”
His best friend since childhood grinned. “Do you remember how I told you about this professor for Memory Recovery things?” Draco nodded silently, which made her continue. “Well, I got a letter back, once I said that I wasn’t kidding and that it was important.”
“Do you want any specific cake? Otherwise, I’ll just bring you one” he asked while getting up.
Harry snuggled into the embrace and sighed. He could smell the Slytherin’s aftershave so intense, that it made his head spin. And the warmth of his skin relaxed him even further. The tension had been so high, he hadn’t even realized how much there had been.
The following silence made Draco frown. What was going on? He sat up straighter and looked at the sun that was now sinking behind a few mountains on the horizon. It coloured the little batches of sky in a beautiful pink and the clouds at the sky went red.
story and no one’s going to eat Ian!”
“I… I do not approve of this!”
Draco smirked as he walked back into the garden, where Theodore was calling for help, as Harry was in top of him, fighting his hardest to stay there. Without any problems, Draco pulled Harry up and over his shoulders – that young man was getting heavier by the hour! – and laughed.
Laughing, Harry shook his head. “I am so happy she’s no longer working there! The last year of her work, she just invented everything about me. I just had to do something.”
His friends sat behind the book cases, well Theodore, Blaise and Millicent were. Theodore had a few novels next to him and he seemed to try and figure out which he wanted to read. Draco wondered how he found time to read other things except school notes. Blaise and Millicent were discussing something from Potions, which Draco had not bothered to figure out. He waved at them, before heading to Pansy’s room. In fact, he found her there, lying on her bed, a pillow on her chest and a somewhat sad expression on her face.
“Why didn’t you just do something? He’s having it really bad in there” Alamar said, ignoring Eric’s worried look on him. He was going to tell him everything when their guest was gone again.
“Of course, Sirius” Draco smiled and walked out of the kitchen and out of the pub without looking at the guest, even though he thought he had seen a rude gesture towards him.
The man by the stove who seemed to be called Eric rolled his eyes, only for Boy to see, and winked at him. “I am always right. Though, your name we don’t need to guess, Chico.”
Harry chuckled. “Wouldn’t it then be even weirder for you to disappear from Azkaban and no Aurors knocking on my door?”
We’re going on a holiday for a few days, so you can let off some steam. Once we’re back, we’re coming by again. You’re still our best friend and neither Ron nor me would let anything happen to you, you know that, right?
Draco scoffed and shook his head. He wasn’t his father and the color was matching Harry’s color quite nicely. Actually, Weasley had given him a few more jumpers when they had their last play date (he had been a lot nicer and Draco somehow suspected Granger to have something to do with it, but he didn’t say a word). Well, all the jumpers were growing with Potter, though not all the way. It was still something nice to have.
“What happened?” Harry asked and Draco asked himself the same question, though he did remember that the girl he had been in love was Harry’s mother. Severus had told him once on his yearly drunken day. Halloween to be exact.
So, when everyone was tired, the food surprisingly almost gone, Draco stayed back with a few others to clean up the Common Room. A shadow made him look up and he found Harry standing next to him. He started to grab a few things for the trash as well.
“Of course” Luna turned to look at him and her huge grin made Draco chuckled slightly.
Weasley played with the folder in his hands, but seemed to genuinely think about the question.
“Harry!” Hermione sighed. “If you have to, I’m sure Molly would be fine with inviting him as well. But you know he’s fifteen years older than you, right? He was fifteen, when you were born?”
Breaking in deeply, he sat down and opened the letter with shaking hands. Why was he so nervous and scared? His mother had always supported his decisions… right?
“Or I’ll follow you wherever you are and make you pay!” Pansy grinned and lightly slapped his cheek, which made Harry chuckle and roll his eyes.
“Well then” she smiled at him and levitated a few pieces of paper towards them. “Since you’re already here, do you mind helping me with setting up a few things for the next few days? Actually, I only need you to do one thing.” She handed him the small stack of paper.
“Never better.” He glared at her, which made her shake her head.
Harry frowned, but shrugged his shoulders. “I still don’t like it.”
“I have a very nice big kitchen here, let’s sit down and have some hot chocolate, before we start going out for a hunt, right Harry?” Remus asked.
“I know. That’s why I said it. Back to bed!” Draco demanded and pointed at the door, where Harry’s room was.
Harry chuckled. “Mate, go home! I’ll be gone soon as well. There’s no point in doing them now and then having to correct them tomorrow, because you made too many mistakes. Just enjoy the evening.”
He resumed eating, while Ian glared at him. The git started bad mouthing Potter and all of his choices and things he had done wrong in the time he had known him. Draco sat Indian style and concentrated on his food, which was why he was as surprised to find Potter suddenly standing next to him as the Muggle was.
Pansy grinned and nodded. “We did try and help you with your reading and writing. Blaise for some reason had such a talent in teaching you. I think he would have made a great teacher.”
This is part two from my wife’s letter to whomever it my concern:
Nott shrugged his shoulders. “So, we need to find out, why you – Potter – don’t want us to leave und what it could be, you really want.”
Harry grinned. “Again, Draco, that’s what
Harry chuckled. “If you say so, Ron. I don’t really drink wine.” He had indeed seen Draco wandering over to the listing and filling out an order, so there might be something waiting for them when they would finally be home again. Harry hadn’t had time or even a reason to walk over there and see which one his husband had ordered.
The way they tried to secretively communicate with only their eyes, trying to hide it from Harry was too funny not to laugh, though Harry managed it rather well. Anything was easier than what he had gone through this morning.
Alamar smiled and then turned to Dwarfbart as if there was something else he had wanted to ask, but completely forgot until now. “Since you’re still here, the parchment said something about creature power and creature ability. Why does Harry have creature powers, even though it’s not clear if he’s a creature? And what’s the difference between creature power and creature ability?”
Frowning slightly, Draco narrowed his eyes. “Invent a…? Oh, um, yes. But I’m not that creative, bear.”
Theodore shook his head, opening his Astronomy book, when Pansy sighed. “I think we raised you wrong.”
“Well, where we come from, every child knows your name” the man who wasn’t Eric said and motioned to his own forehead.
Oh, he was so wrong. Basically nobody paid attention, as small Harry was apparently everything people would talk about. And yes, he did look precious and adorable with his wand watching Flitwick with big eyes and then reading in the books what he should be able to do. If Pansy hadn’t been used to this scene (minus the wand), he was sure she’d be on the floor, squealing and rocking back and forth over the purity of his ward.
I have finally managed to get free from the Ministry’s clutches. They tried to get me to continue their Auror program and I’m not the only one leaving. I may have corrupted Neville on the way as well (you’re welcome Pans, again…). Anyway, if you still want to see the apartment, I’ve told you about, I got the keys and we can just go and look at it during this week.
“Pans! What are you doing?!” Draco widened his eyes in shock, while his best friend simply shrugged her shoulders.
Sighing, Draco nodded. “I guess. So you haven’t lost your sight for what people need then.”
Harry floo’d right into the Burrow and landed in the middle of chaos. Children running around, people screaming, calling names, joke fireworks exploding and Molly about to tell everyone to go back to their own homes.
Harry grinned, putting his arms around Draco and pulling him closer. “No assistance, dear. Just a… a wish.”
“Very good, Harry. I hope you find something soon that hopefully is also curing whatever curse you’ve got thrown into.”
“Touché!”
They passed by Harry and Draco without having seen them. Only once they were out of earshot did both sneak out of the door entrance. They took another route to the Room of Requirement, just so that they wouldn’t meet the two other love birds and had to explain what they were doing together in the middle of the night.
you’re spending time with him. It’s not because you were chosen by a magical parchment, mate. But because
Don’t say anything nice. They have a listening spell activated.
Ron shook his head. “That’s Ginny alright.”
They were all quiet, while Potter settled down on the carpet again, starting to draw something else, while he was humming or mumbling something. Draco carefully watched his ward, though nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The drawing of the Thestral hadn’t messed with him and he apparently hadn’t understood what he was doing.
Kevin nodded and tried unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn. “Sure. Do you need any help?”
Harry laughed and shook his head. Hermione would most likely do exactly that. “I promise, Ron!”
In fact she was giggling so much, she almost couldn’t get her sentence out: “… loves you!”
Meanwhile, Harry turned to Draco, slightly scared and nervous. “Are we here for another evaluation?”
“How many nights?” the man, who seemed to be a doctor, asked.
Fred grinned at Draco and then turned to Harry. “You chose wisely, Harry.”
Wait. Was he the one who was oblivious? How long had Malfoy been talking to him and he hadn’t noticed the way he looked at him? Had this been going on since they had all come back to Hogwarts? Did he even feel the same?
Harry seemed so frustrated over how this story was written, that Draco couldn’t stop himself from laughing loudly. “We’re not re-writing the story, Harry!”
Yawning, Alamar grabbed a parchment and wrote down a few things they needed to do in the next few days. Harry should start going to school here and he needed a wand. Eric also needed to write a message in the creature news so Minerva would know where they were and hopefully visit them soon. And he needed to tell his extraction team where he had moved to, just so they knew where to reach him.
Harry was shocked to see her, but he quickly caught himself again. “It’s nice to see you too, professor. Would you like something to drink? Or to eat? It would be my treat.”
Draco smiled weakly. “I don’t know, Harry. But I do know that you’re the strongest person I’ve ever met. Even though you went through traumatizing shit, you somehow kept it all together to have a somewhat normal looking life.”
When he finally turned to the book again, he sighed. Harry was looking very pale and almost half dead. His eyes had seemingly lost all hope and even if he wasn’t per se saying it… he was hoping Draco could save him. Frankly, Draco was unsure he could do that. The Golden Boy was in such a bad state; he could really understand why people wanted him to be in St. Mungo’s awaiting his death. On the other hand, he could also understand Harry who didn’t want to give up hope. Who was ready to die after only almost forty years?!
Harry smirked. “Thought so. Now, come here, you old fluff ball!” He picked up the Kneazel and put him on his shoulders, where Merlin, looked down at the eggs with excitement. He seemed to love being so close to Harry. Sometimes, he even chased away Draco, so he could be closer. However, Harry was having none of that and Merlin even accepted that Draco was Harry’s favorite human.
Draco stared at the booklet and then back at the baby who was by now asleep. He groaned in defeat. “Okay. How long is this going to take?”
“I am now” Draco breathed into his ear and nuzzled into the crook of Harry’s neck. Just for about two seconds, as Padfoot also wanted to have some attention from Draco and the Slytherin was more than happy to pet him.
Draco bowed to the ladies and turned to Harry, grinning. “Let’s go to the party room, bear, we’ll have a lot more space there to perform the spell.”
“So, what have you been talking about?” Seamus asked and sat down next to Hannah, who moved closer to her husband.
Draco was fuming. Not really because Harry hadn’t found a way how to undo his hair changing spell (and Draco kind of liked his new blue and purple hair style and Harry’s rainbow coloured hair strains). They had just had their weekly Hospital Wing trip and what he had learned from the Injury Parchment had once again killed him on the inside. His aunt (called Marge apparently) had been visiting and actually
Mine dear Lion
“Not really. Well” Draco frowned. “Purebloods have to play instruments, so most choose piano, since almost every family has one in their house and you can use this skill in parties. But violins and guitars or the flute is just as adored.”
Right now, Draco had a little bit of quiet, since Pansy and Millicent had offered to take Harry to the owlery to take care of Dag. The owl had gotten so much better under Harry’s care and he even let Draco pet him for a bit without being scared. It seemed as if what Draco had done for Harry, his ward now gave to his owl. Well, he was just happy that Harry had someone to help, since this trait did belong to him.
“Okay…” the Slytherin seemed to looking for the right words to say, when Neville cleared his throat too.
“Draco.”
“You don’t like it here?” He asked slightly chuckling.
“Don’t talk; just do exactly what I’m saying. Drink this.” He motioned towards the vial. Then he turned to his shrinking dog and put her into a box for bugs. He carefully put it into his robe and looked down the corridor. If anyone would be seeing this, he would be in serious trouble and he doubted that Draco would get away with it. He turned back to his former classmate.
Theodore nodded, apparently willing to go this route. “I don’t like noise. In the library, there’s just too many people coming and going. We have a hide-out spot in the Slytherin Common Room where I can sit and study without being really caught up by who leaves and who comes. But I wasn’t completely alone. Millicent was there as well.”
Snorting, Harry looked at his best friend. “Why is that a question, Ron? Do you
Oh, that one. Yes, that name needed to go. Draco nodded. “Yes, how about Severus?”
“Guess we’ll have to go down?” the blond wizard asked with a hoarse voice.
McGonagall chuckled warmly. “I must admit, I saw you two getting along quite well in eighth year and when I heard that Astoria’s and Draco’s marriage contract had been terminated, I assumed you had started courting.”
The door to the Room of Requirement appeared again and Harry turned to the entrance, where not even a second later, Draco walked through quickly. He stopped and looked around, probably surprised by the huge bathroom in front of him, until his eyes fell on Harry.
With that, he walked out of the room, while Narcissa followed almost hysterically. “Draco, you cannot just walk out of here! I have made an arrangement for your future! It took quite a while to finally have this done! If you don’t go through with the marriage, what kind of a future do you think is waiting for you?!”
Draco scoffed. “That wouldn't be beneath her.” He sighed. “Last question: What happens to this magic, if you take someone's name? Couldn't she just take her part of the family magic back?”
Draco frowned. “How do you have a potion already?”
Just one more thing here: I'm slightly evil so I have cut this chapter (also it suddenly got very long) and it's now a two-parter so you have to be patient.
“Oh darling, we would never do that!” Pansy smiled at him and rubbed his back, which made Harry smile weakly.
Harry smirked. “Like what?”
And that was also typical. Alamar nodded and grabbed his jacket. “If you’re staying awake, I will do so as well.”
There was an uncomfortable silence in the air, before Harry got up from his couch and sat down next to Draco rather scared. Draco frowned; he had thought that he had calmed down his ward. However, he looked as if something was killing him on the inside.
Nott rolled his eyes and pressed the door handle down, as if to show that it didn’t work. The door clicked and the Slytherin widened his eyes, tearing open the door and walking out with out-stretched arms. “Freedom at last!”
Before the Potion’s Master could say anything, Millicent walked out of the Great Hall, looking at Draco and shaking her head. “He’s not in here. Let’s hope Pansy found him!”
“I keep trying!” Harry grinned as he turned around, blew a kiss to his husband and walked to their office, hoping Draco wouldn’t be far behind.
His husband was thinking a little and was just about to say something when the magic around the silencing charm vanished. Harry jumped over the table and sat down next to Padfoot while Draco grabbed the cup and stood ready for when the door would open. Not even five seconds later, it did and Draco threw it expertly next to the person entering.
Nodding, Harry followed the guard, who was walking too fast. Harry felt his lungs burning, as he tried to keep up with him. He bit back a cough, knowing full well his coughing fits would almost never end once they started. Draco walked next to him, giving him a concerned look. Even as a dog, he was able to throw looks.
Dean seemed to take pity on him and quickly changed the subject. “So, who is still missing? I know that Nott and both Patill twins are coming. Anybody else?”
Frowning, Draco opened the pamphlet. Inside were only three questions next to the company name and address for the owl post.
Harry belted out his laughter and turned to his side, shaking his head. Draco chuckled, watching his boyfriend, slowly gaining back control over his laughter. There were tears running down his cheeks and he held his stomach. All of this made Draco laugh softly as well.
“To me, you’re the biggest mystery of them all, Draco Alexander Snape.”
Before he knew it, Harry pulled him down so he was lying next to his ward. “Thank you” Harry whispered and snuggled into Draco’s side.
Nott turned to Harry and raised his eyebrows. “It let us inside when you touched the door, Potter. The house has feelings for you.”
“Listen, you guys need to stop sending Errol! I’m pretty sure he’s going to die on my bed one day, because this long flight is killing him.” Potter explained and laughed a little.
Within seconds, their grunts and breaths mingled as they released together. Not for a second did they let go of each other's hands even as they came down from the high, their hips still thrusting against each other in the afterglow in small jerky motions. Harry felt too weak to even get off of Draco and allowed himself to be pushed to the side.
Yet, he couldn’t agree with Harry when the man said he was broken beyond repair. That wasn’t true. Harry had loads of people around him who were willing to help him after the war. He was the one who shut them out. Harry hadn’t been thrown straight into the Azkaban and left alone with nothing to deal with the war’s trauma and the Dementors’ presence. He hadn’t been the one who was jerked awake from nightmares filled to the brim with the merciless Dark Lord only to be faced with another nightmare, a ghastly Dementor, sucking the life out of him. Harry hadn’t been the one to fight for eight years trying to protect himself, his Mother, and his good for nothing Father from the other inmates who apparently found closure in the death of Malfoys.
Someone, he couldn't see through the blur, was looking at the burning hole in his left arm. Yes, the mark was supposed to burn away into ashes. Just like it deserved. Just like he deserved the pain of having it on his arm, he also felt it fitting to feel the pain of losing it. But, he would not be able to get rid of it, would he? There is no salvation for him from the mark that tainted his life. Not even death could grant him absolution.
“It won’t be the same every time and you know it more than any of us,” Ron said.
And, Draco gave in by lying back and shutting his eyes.
“Oh, no, you don’t,” Hermione grunted but as she was about to get up to go and give Harry a piece of her mind, her legs gave out and she fell back down onto the sofa she’d been sitting on. It was as if an infinite number of needles were pricking the insides of her enlarged stomach; an immense pain greater than anything she’s ever felt before. Her eyes welled up involuntarily as both her hands encircled her stomach in an effort to reduce the pain.
“Well, the baby was conceived using magical means, I believe?” the Healer queried with a raised eyebrow.
Mirror-Draco cooed.
I hope you remember me.
At last relieved of the tension he’s been through for the past couple of minutes, knowing that Hermione was now in safe hands, Harry’s heart gradually stopped pounding at his ribcage. For a moment, he let his head fall back onto the wall and closed his eyes. Even the bustle around him seemed no bother as he felt the potion work on his back. It was as if someone was expertly massaging the knots away. Magic, it never ceased to amaze him. A wide smile graced his lips and he let out a deep breath of contentment. Like a thorn under the rose petals, a sudden increase in the noise around him seemed to prick painfully at the peace his heart sought out. Unable to ignore it any longer, he opened his eyes. The entire reception hall was stock still. It seemed as if something amazing caught everyone’s eye and they couldn’t help but talk about it. But why were there sneers on their astonished faces?
Right outside the door stood Harry, with an angry expression, and Hermione, with an equally furious face. Ron had been leaning on the wall but stood upright when Draco walked out and was now looking at him with concern mixed with what Draco could only point out to be sympathy. Molly was crouched on the sofa with an expression similar to Ron’s and Draco could say that something was definitely wrong.
"With a person like you? Never!" Harry slurred, dragging the last word he spoke.
- OOC Molly, I agree. That is why I mentioned 'OOC characters' as a warning in the chapter. In this universe of mine, let's say, people want to move on positively. Still, taking into account my future chapters (spoiler alert?), I don't think Molly or anyone has completely forgiven Draco and his kind for their loss.
I hope you remember that I once loved you.
"Good day to you, Mrs. Weasley. I fell down the stairs the other day. Rather disgraceful of me, I must say," Draco gave his best fake smile and willed Molly to believe his stupid but convincing lie.
"I'll give you two choices and one minute, Malfoy. Choose well," Harry's voice echoed in the confines of Malfoy's Azkaban cell.
Harry jerked out of his trance at her very obvious question. Everyone knew he was an Auror. “Uh, yes.”
“I was gifted another one by my Godfather. The Firebolt,” Harry’s voice wavered. So did his smile.
"Wow," Harry breathed out.
“Here you go, Mr. Potter. Drink this. Allow a five for it to work. Mrs. Granger-Weasley has been taken to Ward number 10 and Healer Eastoft is with her. Mr. Wesley, your presence is required,” she said the last part to Ron. She smiled at both of them and Harry returned it before gulping down the potion and handing her back the empty vial.
The drag hit his head at once and his shaking stopped almost instantly. Sitting on the window sill with his head lolling on the frame, he watched the clouds of smoke he exhaled with genuine interest when a sharp pain laced through his nose. The Skele-Gro was starting its work on him, he reckoned.
“At least you learned to apply a salve, Potter,” Draco retorted dazedly and Harry laughed. His eyes didn’t miss the empty whiskey bottle downstairs which might’ve been why the blonde was currently expressive.
“I’m not the only one,” he repeated as he openly broke down in front of his Healer. And she let him. He cried till there were no tears left for him to shed. He’d been alone. No one had come to his rescue and he never asked anyone to help his deal with his grief. Looking at his loved ones, he believed he should be stronger so that they could lean on him for much needed support. When they did, he took comfort in soothing their pain but never once did he stop and think about the pain stabbing at his insides. It consumed him and filled him with Darkness. Never finding time to grieve, he boxed it up well and let the pain take over. And everything crashed.
And Draco's healing will shortly begin!
Draco was currently feeling it as he moved about the kitchen and as he sat down to eat breakfast with his husband.
“I talked about this with ‘Mione and she too thought it was better for you guys to heal separately. We will help too. Right now it’d only be me as ‘Mione has to look after Baby Rose,” Ron replied, smiling faintly.
“Happy birthday, Draco,” he wished himself as he still lay on the bed though the clock ticked eleven in the morning.
"I know. But I want to," Harry replied.
“Does that mean you’re okay with breaking up?” Harry asked as his brows disappeared under his tousled bangs.
“What do you mean why?”
“After the Christmas party, Harry came back to me asking about the Artificial Pregnancy Potion, how it worked, and where it is available, and so on. I shouldn’t have told him anything. If I’d known that he would spike your drinks to get you pregnant without your consent, I would never have told him about the potion,” Hermione started crying and she partly blamed it on her hormones.
“Gee, thanks, but I can protect myself,” Draco huffed to make light of their current situation. He didn’t want her to pity him more than she already did. He didn’t want to turn into a charity case.
The only change he could make but wouldn’t was - shopping for one instead of two.
“Because you’ll be coming with me,” she said simply.
Outside, a storm began, lighting the evening shade with flashes of lightning. A few minutes later, there was a blackout in the house and Draco leaned back on the sofa, looking out the window at the flashes of lightning not coupled with thunder. Not yet. By then, he was down four packs of Lights, a couple of fresh burn marks sizzling on the Mark and was on the first bud of his third, maybe even the fourth – he didn’t count anymore – pack. If he feared that he consumed more smoke than food or water, he never let it cross his mind at all because he liked the escape nicotine gifted him with – lightheadedness he wanted amidst all the shit his life had turned out to be.
“Mixed-fruit tastes yummier though. I don't think there will be much difference in terms of taste,” Harry countered.
Draco simply nodded his head. Back to Azkaban now; back to where he belonged. Right now, even it seemed a better option than staying and being judged by Harry, the one person who gave him a second chance which he wasted with impromptu decisions of his own. His life had been a mistake after all. People like him never change. They commit the same mistakes over and over again and reap what they sow until they end up dead. Death is the only respite he and people like him were ever going to get from all the drama.
Just out of a perfectly dreamless sleep, Draco couldn't decipher where he was or to whom those gorgeous glassy eyes belonged to until he remembered the events of the previous night and stiffened for a moment in Harry's embrace before relaxing.
Draco’s heart raced rapidly, fear filling him like wildfire as various bad scenarios sprang up in his mind; Harry poisoning him taking the cake above all. But, why would Harry do that, Draco thought, as they had been building their relationship steadily and there was no reason for Harry to do whatever he did.
"Let's get these fitted with lens tomorrow," Harry said.
The war had done something to all of them and now, seven years later, they still are haunted by the war and the dead Satan, Lord Voldemort. One cannot imagine the horrors Harry faced in the months after. And he never spoke to anyone about the fears that gripped him tight during the dark nights that followed. He remembered sitting up alone in his bed and crying like a baby, screaming for peace. Ginny couldn't offer him what he wanted. Yes, they loved each other but it wasn't enough to cure him of his spiral into nothingness.
"I chose you, yes. That doesn't mean I have to give up on my bloodline," Malfoy countered.
- Please heed the warnings I give. Don't complain later if you're going to read it anyway.
“I suppose she sent something else too?” Harry asked.
“Remember the day you visited me in the Azkaban?” Draco asked, removing Harry’s glasses and gently wiping Harry’s wet and snotty face with Harry’s robes. They could be washed later. Harry looked a mess with tears and snot splattering his face. He looked a great deal younger and vulnerable as he sat on Draco’s lap, his palms still fisting Draco’s shirt as if letting go would kill him.
Though I wish you do not remember all our memories together, I desperately hope you remember that you walked out on me with my happiness and heart right up your sleeve. You took away my life and the one you don't see now is just a ghost that breathes and lives like a human.
And Draco did let go as Harry asked and fell back against his husband’s chest. Harry put an arm around the blonde’s waist before renewing his slow-paced thrusts, eliciting moans of pleasure and tears of pain yet again, after many goddamn months, from Draco’s neat mouth. Suddenly reminded of Draco’s mouth, Harry wanted to claim all those sounds for himself and he captured the man’s lips in a punishing grip, licking and biting them alternatively till the lower one could no longer take it anymore and split and bled red for Harry to consume.
“I.. I don’t know what I thought,” Draco murmured more to himself, scratching his chin with his index. Then he furrowed his brows.
“I’ve never thought of it,” Harry said a bit irritably.
Without looking at Harry, Draco slipped the woven gold and platinum band onto his left ring finger.
"Caring for a pet would be nice, wouldn't it? Besides, you can send mail too," Harry said, coming to Draco's side and caressing the bird gently and resting his hand upon Draco's which was resting on the bird's head.
"Of course, dear!" she said and spelled a Healing charm over Draco's bruises. They closed up neatly and his face was blemish-free once again. "Now, come in and make yourselves at home," she stepped aside to let them in and they graciously walked in together with their hands clasped together.
Harry’s legs were about to give out, trying to hold both their weights so, he pulled out rather quickly, much to Draco’s dismay and heard the blond make a protesting sound. He then dragged Draco towards the sofa and bent him over the arm. “Hold on, Draco,” he warned.
The first time Harry took him out into the muggle world was a couple of months after Draco had started living with his husband. He had been skeptical and downright adamant about visiting muggle London for groceries. The only delivery boy worked at Fresh Market had gotten into an accident thus delivery services were halted till the shop owner hired a new boy or the old one was fit enough to work again. For four months after, no groceries were delivered to their doorstep; instead, Harry took Draco along with him twice a month to get all they needed. When Draco followed Harry into the lone garage, he supposed they would be driving there, given Harry’s house was close to the Muggle world. But, no. He learned that Harry’s garage was only for show and that he had not the possession of any vehicle, except a few classy broomsticks which lay haphazardly in one corner, a layer of dust piled on them. The garage was only a ruse for a convenient apparition point, the only spot in Harry’s house which allowed it.
Madcheshirefox - When I read the line: Puts shovel on standby, I don't know why but it cracked me up harder than I imagined. I am laughing as I write this one too.
Draco coughed into his palm once. “As you said, this isn’t the right place.” The need to get away from Harry was growing stronger by the second.
He then started conversing with his owl, Sebastian, and when his owl was resting, Draco took to a cluster of DVDs that he played on repeat. Mostly, Supernatural. He could even recite the dialogues! Draco doubled over with laughter - the only time he ever laughs these days was during his Supernatural season one marathons - at the exorcism scene because of Dean’s rather comedic expressions. That man could speak volumes with expressions alone and Draco thought that it’d be nice if he could be as expressive as Dean. Then the people could see him for what he was. A weak recreant thirsting for a hand in friendship and a heart in love.
On the way to the Hospital Wing, Harry seemed to be upset. Once they almost reached the room, he finally seemed able to talk about it. “Why is Ron that way? I remember him being completely different. He was so kind and nice and… and open minded. But now… he’s somewhat weird. Why does he act that way?”
Draco handed back the parchment to the mediwitch and sighed, glancing down at the boy sitting in the bed, playing with Severus’ teddy bear as if nothing in the world was wrong. Madam Pomfrey shot him a meaningful look and walked back to her work desk, where she grabbed a few more potions and salves, or whatever she had stored there.
Pansy smiled and sat down on the blanket again, while Potter beamed at Draco. It seemed as if the time spent outside was indeed helping him to feel happier again. Before he could say anything to his ward, Pansy spoke up. “I’m sorry, Draco.”
Draco stopped dead in his track.
“I’m not your Magical Guardian anymore. I’m your boyfriend!” Draco glared at Harry who smirked.
Ron snorted. “Yeah right. It’s clear to everyone here that you don’t hate each other.”
! Otherwise, he’s going to marry me off to a woman!” Draco placed his head in his hands and sighed.
McGonagall had been fine with letting him use the main office’s fire place as a means to go over to Ginny’s, though it was only available at seven o’clock, which gave Harry another hour to do whatever. As he walked out of the castle towards the lake, where he had seen a few adults sitting and talking, his phone vibrated. He took it out of his pocket, firstly wondering how there was any mobile reception and secondly seeing the name
They walked over to the guard station, where Harry had to fill out paperwork. Behind him, his Husky and Golden Retriever crossbreed walked over the stone ground so quietly, as if she was a ghost. Harry had always been sure that his service dog had some kind of magic in her ancestry, though he had never had the energy to look it up.
Severus only nodded thoughtfully. For a while, everything was quiet, before his godfather leaned over the table. “And how are you doing with Harry?”
“Morning, Connor” Harry called out and grinned at the mail boy. “If you have some mail, just leave it there. I’d like to go back to bed with Draco. I’m closed today.”
Smiling, Draco leaned over Harry, kissing him softly. His boyfriend didn’t want to tell the world about them without his consent. That was the best thing he ever heard. “Harry, as long as you’re by my side, I know I can do anything.”
“Dray, can we invent a story, please?”
“Sure, but why Milos?” Malfoy frowned and looked at him, before he turned back to cleaning his camera. “You could have chosen any other name?”
Harry burst out laughing and shook his head, while Draco pulled him to his side. And with some light banter, they made it to the Great Hall, where breakfast was indeed already being served. Draco was incredibly happy to see Harry’s hungry eyes over the food. He wasn’t sure he had ever seen Harry look at food like that when he had first come to stay with them.
Still, Draco was done quicker than usual and waited in the Common Room for his friends. If he had the courage, he would have gone up there on his own, however, he really wasn’t brave enough. Once they were all finally done, they headed up to the infirmary.
Luckily, nobody thought of looking at Draco, as everyone turned to their walking encyclopedia, and Theodore sighed. “I don’t know very much about it, my family was never intentionally into Dark Arts. I just know that a Horcrux is a dark object where the wizard casting the spell hides a part of their soul to stay or become immortal.”
“I don’t know. But take this and it’ll be fine in a few minutes.”
“Wait, so you don't have a boyfriend?!” Ron asked and frowned.
“Merlin, Harry! You just gave me a heart attack!” Pansy called out and held the place where her heart was. “Wait, why are you here? It’s your free day now! You should go celebrate Christmas with the Weasleys.”
The Headmistress nodded, knowingly and chuckled. “No rush. I’m just glad we have cleared the question of who would want to be the next Headmaster.”
With a simple wave of his hands, the front door was ripped open, almost exploding. And through the dust created by this blast, Harry’s shadowy figure appeared. Narcissa almost ran into the foyer, staring at the intruder.
Potter’s nonchalance did unspeakable things to him. That and the fact he was apparently openly flirting... Draco shook his head, while he closed the door and leaned against it. Maybe he wasn’t flirting. Maybe this was his personality...
Draco’s eyes grew big for just a second. Harry sighed. He had spent enough time around medical people and others who had knowledge in all kinds of areas to know what such a reaction meant.
Of course, Draco being an absolute genius had used this during breakfast, asking who he was texting with and if he’s had a nice time, before they started going crazy. Harry just glared at him and coldly told him that some people would listen to what he had to say. That had been the starting point to their not so friendly discussion.
Pansy widened her eyes. “And forget us? I don’t think so! We have been good parents!”
Before Draco could ask whether or not Pansy – who was acting really suspiciously around Longbottom – had a date with this Gryffindor, he was distracted, by Harry asking a question: “Dray, what is a virgin?”
he could cook. That was impressive, right? A six year old shouldn’t be able to cook... or should he?
Harry chuckled. “Maybe a little?”
“Quite possibly, yes.”
Now yawning himself, Draco just slipped under his blanket and fell asleep almost immediately.
“The Weasley-Granger household." Noticing that Oaskar was about to object, he added some more information. "I’m looking for Potter.”
“They will” Draco confirmed. “Don’t worry about that.”
And I didn’t tell you to go to St. Mungo’s because I want you to die. But they have good potions and the best doctors in the world. They would be able to find something, if there was anything wrong with you.
“Good morning. Are you Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy?” she asked. Her voice was much nicer than her appearance and Harry had to keep himself from rolling his eyes over his own prejudices.
Harry grinned in her direction and then looked back at his Magical Guardian. “What do you want to do, Dray?”
“It’s a Muggle story” Harry explained. “A while ago, when circuses had elephants, they would keep baby elephants there, locked with a chain to a peg. The baby would try to get away, but it would never succeed. And it would keep this mind set even when the elephant was an adult, which was why they never tried to get away, even though it was easy to escape by then. They were brought up with the proof that it was impossible.” Harry paused and smiled at Draco. “So my Mind Healer told me to look at what’s keeping me back from living the life I want and fight for it. The barriers might just be in my mind.”
They turned another page to find little baby Potter playing with a black dog. Potter pointed at him in the picture and looked up at Draco again. “Hally!”
Pansy shrugged her shoulders and completed their telling: “The old man’s lost his mind completely. He just shut down after we left and is now basically a prisoner of his mind, where there’s probably still some pain hiding. The old woman… she’s still there, but from what I’ve heard she begs the guards in St. Mungo’s to free her from her torture. Too bad they don’t kill people.”
Monday: breakfast (from 9am to 11am), Hogsmeade Tour (11am to open end)
“Bear, don’t you worry, it’s fine. I’m not going to hurt you.” This wasn’t working. How could he bring his ward out of his hiding place and into his arms?
Some of you may know this, but I currently speak three languages (trying to learn a fourth). This one is by far my favorite non-English Christmas song. If you want to hear the song in the original language (German), type in: “Es ist ein Ros entsprungen”. There are some amazingly beautiful renditions of this! <3
Heracles took it quickly and flew out of the window. Which left Draco with an unwell feeling. If his mother didn’t want a reply, this letter – whatever might be written inside – was final. He threw it on the table and opened the fridge to take a coke, but decided a beer would probably help him in digesting the news his mother had sent him.
“You are stupid, Theo! He’s cute, I’ll give you that” Millicent said, rolling her eyes. “But he’s also annoying. Let alone… a baby!”
“It still annoys me.”
“What, no, that’s disgusting!” Draco wrinkled his nose. “Why in Merlin’s name would you ask that?!”
Neville grinned. “I’ve been here for a little longer than just the last sentence I’ve said. Even if you were fighting… you two lovebirds look too much in love with each other. And Harry’s on your lap. That’s a weird custody battle over Padfoot.”
For lunch, they went into a small restaurant, where Harry enjoyed the best chips and chicken cutlet he had ever tasted. It was so good, that he opted on never going away from here ever again.
“Hey Ron, I have a question...” Harry decided to just ask it.
Shaking his head softly, Draco confirmed it. “Well, having magic is a gift, you know, bear? And if we want to try and do something to another person, we need to ask them.”
Chuckling, Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “I know, darling. But I think we should start small. So, maybe tell him to make his bed every morning. Then, we’ll go bigger, clean up the Common Room – with our help of course – and then… I don’t know.”
“Draco, darling” Pansy smirked. “Didn’t your mother teach you not to eavesdrop?”
Potter and Ian both turned quickly, though luckily the Gryffindor seemed to grasp the idea of his plan very fast and his shocked expression turned into a huge smile. The business freak looked at Draco and shook his head.
Nodding, he motioned his husband to open the door. Sadly, most back doors didn’t have any welcome mats, so he really couldn’t just go in. Eric grinned quickly and quietly pushed the door open.
“Well” Harry smiled, put an arm around her and followed Luna into the kitchen, where she greeted Nora. “If you ever find a machine that finds these thingies, you can test it on me. If I’m still alive by that point.”
“Everything for Nora, Harry.”
Surely it would be one where they could be together – though all three of them had the opportunity of staying close to the other.
Harry tilted his head slightly and smiled softly. “You’re
“That’s a good thing, Harry!” He looked down and turned a few pages back. Before Harry could even ask what he was talking about the Slytherin turned the book and showed him the list of all possible curses, Harry had written down. “It eliminates about two thirds of all of these.”
“Harry!” Hermione laughed as he appeared in the Burrow in the middle of some chaos. He laughed as he moved away from children running around the corner and hugged his best friend. The baby bump had almost disappeared and their fourth child was lying in a crib. Once again, it had turned out to be a girl.
“Are you still a Horcrux?” Millicent asked with wide eyes.
“Well, you are literally dying right now, so yes, it is bad.” Draco sighed. “Dark spells usually overpower the body, which is why you probably vomited. Did you keep something from that?”
So, he sat down next to Neville and grabbed a glass of wine as well. He could see Draco opening his mouth and shutting it again. Hiding his smirk behind the glass of wine, he took a careful sip. It tasted too sweet for his liking, but that and the intense flavor of just berries was all he could taste. He was sure that Draco would have loved to make a statement about Harry’s lack of wine-knowledge, though that would have very likely ended in another ‘fight’.
This idiot Slytherin had somehow gotten away with stealing his heart. Somehow it had happened and Harry hadn’t realized it until one time in potion’s class when they were brewing with pairs and Malfoy had been in his group. Harry hadn’t been able to tear away his eyes from the fluid movements he made and the totally unearned self-esteem. Especially after he had been in Azkaban for two months. For some reason, Malfoy was looking better than ever.
There was a call going on right now. Just a little interested, Draco looked at it and inhaled surprised, once he saw a familiar shape in the fire. Draco could see Potter’s face appear in the fire place, right this second. Quickly, he pressed the small button at the bottom, so he could hear what was going on. Sadly, as he pressed the button that would tell him the area from where Potter was calling his friends, it came up empty immediately. The Gryffindor was pretty smart in using magic against finding him.
Shaking his head, Harry rubbed his forehead. “I don’t think I can work as an Auror anymore.”
Ron closed the door behind him and seemed to steady himself for this conversation. When he finally looked at Harry, he had an air of genuine concern around him. Harry frowned, though before he could say anything, his friend started: “Look, marriage can be difficult.”
Love, Ginny
Harry rolled his eyes. “I thought I’d just arrive here next year and be the headmaster. And I’d have to figure out everything by myself. That was usually how things were going throughout my life.”
Harry widened his eyes and stared at the Slytherin in shock. Had he just really told a Snake that he was gay? Not even Hermione or Ron knew! The only person who he had told was Ginny when she had wanted to know why he didn’t want to be with her anymore.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. “The standard charms are pretty useful. Though, not when you’re trying to make yourself unknown to a person with a close relationship.”
“Thank you!” Draco said, not before turning around frowning. “Listen, do I need to do something for you? I mean, I would understand it, if you’d like some help, if....”
Frowning, Alamar looked up and shook his head. “What?”
Malfoy stepped next to him and took out his own wand as well. “You’re really good at de-escalating whatever these two are doing right now.” He kneeled in front of the door as well, pointing his wand at the lock.
“He was gone? Just like that?” Draco frowned. What did the Ministry have there? You fall through something and you’re dead? That didn’t sound… legal.
Harry smirked and stayed there until the dust settled around him. He brushed some of the white particles off his shoulders nonchalantly and looked back at Draco’s former mother. “I would like to see you try.”
“No?”
Frowning, Harry shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I’m not sure what you’re apologizing for…”
“But I don’t want
Nodding, Harry sighed. “It was my destiny to either kill him or be killed by him. Dumbledore heard it and once Severus found out my mother had… well me, he asked him to hide my family.” Harry seemed to want to add something else, which he then apparently dropped, before he continued. “The prophecy also said that ‘the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal’ which… yeah” gesturing at his face, Harry rolled his eyes.
“Of course, bear.” Draco grabbed his quill and some unwritten parchment and started writing, while reading aloud what he was putting onto the paper. “Once upon a time, there was a small penguin in...”
Oh… so it was that.
Daphne coughed, though Harry thought she was hiding a giggle, laughter or chuckle. Her expression was absolutely giving it away. Draco bit his lips, apparently trying his hardest to keep calm. Harry could see how he was fighting with himself.
The next time, Draco got woken up was by Harry who sat down on his bed happily playing with his favourite toy. Well, Draco yawned and opened his eyes to find his ward with crossed legs on his bed and pretending that his teddy bear was walking through a scary forest. Well, at least Harry had learnt that he didn’t need to wake up and make breakfast for them.
Looking up at the door frame, Harry spotted the blond wizard walking towards him through the mostly dark hallway with another arm full of… even more clutter. In his arms were about five big items and he was barely able to see where he was going. Harry moved a box out of the way, so he wouldn’t fall over it, and shook his head. “Draco, we can’t take this as well! You have to choose. One more item maybe, I can’t fit all of them in here.”
Nodding, the goblin raised his eyebrows quickly. “The Potters were one of the better witches and wizards: They really tried to help the creatures. Well then, what can I do for you fine young gentlemen?”
Well, not that Harry cared much. Hermione had been right before, Slughorn really seemed like the guy to change something he didn’t like. And if that was the case, he needed to get some more knowledge in Potion’s.
“How are you already finished moving in?” Harry asked intrigued.
“You are terrible, Harry.”
“I said,
Nodding with wide eyes, Harry grinned broadly. “I like that!”
them? Harry, what were you thinking?”
Admittedly, Madam Pomfrey was correct. Draco smiled and turned to face baby Potter again. “So, what do you think happened tonight?”
“Here we are!” Harry said when the keys in the door turned and he opened it, turning on the lights to reveal the apartment behind it.
Love, your teacup
Harry groaned and nodded. “A prick who wants my dog” he explained. Draco surely wasn’t going to say no if anybody asked if he wanted Padfoot and with how close they seemed today, that wasn’t a question. The only problem was that Padfoot seemed to be so fond of them both – though Harry knew about this problem before.
Draco chuckled. “I like you too, my little laughing bear.” He then motioned his ward to walk the rest of the stairs up to McGonagall’s office. How she did this for every meal was beyond his understanding.
How are you doing? Listen, Ron and Hermione really want to talk to you and I decided to tag along to help you out. We’re here and we just want to talk. Please talk to us.
“Strange, huh?” Draco said grinning.
Draco shook his head, unable to believe that his own godfather would use such a potion against him. He couldn’t contain what he was about to say, so he just glared at Severus, while he started to speak again. “It’s the best thing I got so far. He hates me probably and...”
He was slightly afraid that Harry would lose his head and just… freak out, even though he had known the former Gryffindor quite well. It was still a little scary.
Madam Pomfrey interrupted Severus and walked over quickly to Draco who was first of all surprised why they would tell him that and second of all… loving everything here. Potter was a baby!?
While Harry chuckled, downed a potion and walked over to the table, Draco realized how easy it was for him to walk. A few days ago, he had so much pain in his legs that he couldn’t even get up. Draco had made food, helped Nora with taking care of a seriously sick Harry and he had wondered what the Gryffindor had done before he had been in his house. Nora was an amazing dog – and definitely a soul bond dog – but she couldn’t do all the things that were required to take care of a sick human being.
“No teasing” he growled, which made Harry burst out laughing.
Harry grinned. “Don’t worry, ‘Mione. You can buy the books in the front. In the back there’s a library, where the rare books are. Some of them are in permanent spells so they won’t turn into dust if you open them. The oldest one dates back to 700 BC.”
“Can you stay, please?” Dominique asked, with so much hope in her voice that Harry could see his husband melting away. His soft eyes to her as he agreed to stay for dinner was just too cute.
Harry didn’t have the energy to laugh at the angry look the dog was throwing him. Nevertheless, Draco opened his mouth and Harry let the potion flow into the dog’s huge snout.
“Actually, yes.” Harry grinned and waited for his friend to get the stupidity if his joke.
With a food critic in the village (or living in the nearest bigger town), Draco wasn’t sure if he should tell Potter about his real identity. He was still working with Potter, so that he would form a normal eating habit, and maybe the stress of the food critic, who was his ex on top of that, was already too much. If he would have told him that he was in fact Draco Malfoy, how much more stress would he provide him with? Maybe he would stop eating altogether.
“Interesting” Remus said and smiled at him.
And since I am now writing a note at the beginning, I would also like to
“Oh, but I do!” Draco called, bursting out laughing. He pressed a kiss on Harry’s temple. “Now go, love. Get Olaf and let’s finish this circus on a high, before we end this charade once and for all.”
“You’re not mad?” Draco asked. He looked curiously at Harry, who shook his head and put his arm around his shoulders.
Neville laughed and shook his head. “I told everyone you met your lawyer this morning and for you, Draco, I’ve asked an old Auror friend, who loves these kinds of things, to dress up as a divorce lawyer. He’ll be here by four. I do have to warn you, though, he’s a little over the top, but I thought it would be fun, if Harry would start arguing with your lawyer as well.”
to do it!”
However, they quickly found out, what the two of them were doing: They were trying to find the weirdest things to wear. After a while, Harry was also having fun, watching them getting these things. Neville had found a self-aware knitted jumper that would close any holes it would get. However, that included all the useful holes as well: the hole to get inside, where the head should have come out and both holes for the hands were constantly closed and had to be opened again by anybody who wanted to try it on.
In there, he spotted his husband fairly quickly. Alamar sat on a couch, facing the infirmary and rubbed the back of the werewolf who was still there. Eric stopped and smiled softly. Of course Alamar was there to help out.
Draco smiled, but rolled his eyes at the continued knocking. “Trying to make you ignore the people outside.”
Finally, she continued, walking closer to him. “How can you expect me to stay your friend?! You’re with the enemy!”
“No.” Draco chuckled. “Anyway, what are you writing?”
“You’re here, because Blaise still hadn’t finished writing the Anderson-report.” Draco answered, grabbing another piece of his four cheese pizza. “And the Wizarding thing, well, Harry doesn’t know how to do taxes in the Muggle world and on the way of doing taxes, you also figured out how the financial thing of the Wizarding World works so...”
Ginny winked and waved as she headed out the door.
The therapist frowned slightly. “Well, you don’t need this session then?”
Draco sighed. “Well then, it’s not even nine in the morning, I might just go back to my room and sleep more.”
“Can’t they do anything to reverse it with some spell or so? Surely there has to be some sort of magical help!” Millicent asked and frowned slightly, looking at Potter. “I mean he’s cute and all, but I really don’t want him to be around us.”
“Yes.” Harry shrugged his shoulders, as if he was okay with it. Which, frankly, he was. Draco knew his ward by now and he could forgive far too easily. “He was the one who had the most to lose, guys. Hermione had hidden her parents in Australia, mine are dead…” He once again shrugged his shoulders.
“What the hell is that?” Ron asked and stepped next to Harry, as he jerked slightly.
From the corner of his eyes, Harry could see five classmates, including Hermione and Ron as well as Pansy who seemed rather sour that her plan seemingly hadn’t worked out. If she would have been aware that Draco and he had used this time as a quiet breakfast and to just be together without having to fake something – most of the time – she would have probably lost it.
“Dray! Thank you for being here!”
Getting up, Draco walked over to Harry and took one vial. “Well, I’m not. I’ll make you something that helps you and isn’t going to kill you.”
Draco pulled him into a hug and the strong, familiar scent was enough to calm Harry down at least a little bit. “If you need me, send me a text, Harry. You’re always my first priority.”
Everything he had stowed away ever since he had seen Sirius dying in front of him came back. All the people that died for him, all the pain he had to endure, everything. He cried into Draco’s shoulder, holding him so tightly, that he was afraid he was going to break him.
This reminded him a lot of small Harry who would get excited over the smallest things. An owl sitting by the window? It was his new favorite creature! Pansy walking into the room? New favorite playing mate.
“I’ve talked to Granger.”
Grinning broadly, Harry looked at the opposite end of the table. “What’s up, Theodore?”
Thy waiting Lion
!” Draco grinned and softly pushed a few loose strains under Potter’s hood again. It made Potter’s scar much clearer, since he couldn’t hide it under his hair.
Draco nodded cautiously. “He is.” Both were looking at each other, expecting something else. Draco waiting for another question, Molly probably wanting him to elaborate a little. Well, Draco complied after a few quiet seconds, in which only the twin’s counting could be heard. “He has a few setbacks… We need to visit the healer weekly, other than that, he’s very happy. He laughs a lot.”
“Interesting” she said and smiled. “Late yesterday evening, Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Blaise and Anthony had come by and told me that I needed to do something as apparently this class reunion was the reason you and Draco were having arguments after arguments.”
“Love, why would you even need that potion?” Harry smiled warmly, giving his husband a kiss. “Don’t you have so many happy memories right now? Isn’t it good enough to give Lily, Caellum, Sophie and Emmet a happy childhood? We both know Lily can’t get enough of her papa.”
Blaise and Millicent agreed, while Theodore only chuckled. Draco turned around and walked back up towards the castle, wondering how his life had come to this. Not that is was something bad; Harry was now an adult and he was in Slytherin. Most importantly, they seemed to be on good terms which was a good start for a relationship, right? Now he just needed to find the courage to ask Harry whether or not he was gay and if he wanted to go on a date with him. Just minor questions, right?
Eric smiled down at the boy. “We’re going to Russia, Slugger. No one’s going to look there for us and we can live happily ever after.”
school for witchcraft and wizardry with a lot of people looking at it for advice and strength… How could he take over something like that?!
Nott shrugged his shoulders and they silently walked to the Apparating Chamber, everyone with their bag and probably a silent wish that this mission was going to be over as soon as possible. At the AC, the four Aurors showed their badge and were led into a black room. Once everyone was inside and the ddoor firmly shut, the magical flow surrounded all of them and they were sucked up as if they had been standing in front of a vacuum cleaner.
Harry felt lucky, that they had the discussion with the couple’s therapist this morning. If they hadn’t had that, he would have freaked out. They hadn’t been ready for children before this afternoon.  Thank goodness, they had overcome that problem by talking it out.
“Potty Hally.”
Harry grinned as he turned back to his toast. His husband was too tired to even realize what was going on, but Harry absolutely
mad. Who did they think they were?! How was Harry not fucking messed up?!
“Are you okay, young man?” he asked and Boy frowned slightly.
Nicolai cleared his throat and took a sip of the tea. “Anyway, she told me that she wanted to meet my man.” He bit his lower lip and looked at Harry. “I didn’t tell her that we broke up.”
Shaking his head, Harry grinned and leaned against his husband’s strong chest. “I love you” he whispered quietly, though Draco still caught it – or he just correctly assumed what Harry had said.
The valley from the top of a hill. Taking it down, Draco smirked and turned around to the desk, with an idea in his head. However, before he could even attempt to start to do something with it, he heard the door open again and when he looked around, his mother stood there. Widening his eyes, he tilted his head a little.
Fighting the urge to say ‘hello to you too’, Draco instead answered the question. “Not yet. There’s nothing around here. I’ll keep looking.” Why he lied to his boss, he didn’t know. However, he didn’t really have a reason to tell him the truth, since King would always win his laurels.
“What, why? What’s going on?” Pansy frowned, though she walked through the room to actually stay next to him. It was nice to see her actually come closer, but he was still absolutely mad.
“I’m not sure you want to hear the truth” Harry offered and shrugged his shoulders, hoping this would keep them off his back.
“I have to admit, I’ve never seen him this happy. When we saw him at the end of the summer or other times, he did look… well” she seemed forlorn in her mental images. Her whole face seemed to fall, as she seemed to remember something.
Either way: Thanks for the comment, I re-wrote a little part, because you guys were right: Harry needs to be angry at Hermione and Ron :P
“Stranger’s eyes, yes. But…”
Theodore shook his head. “No thank you! Nobody knows how to cast them. There’s a rumor surrounding it stating that murder is involved. That is literally all I know.”
“Animals have healing powers as well” she explained, though Harry was quite sure that all of them already knew that. “I have always wanted to create some sort of Muggle Healing Farm or whatever they were called. People could take care of animals and get the love and understanding they’re not used to in real life. Hi there” she smiled at Padfoot who came closer sniffing her hand and then walking closer to receive some scratches.
“That’s amazing!” Harry called out. “Please tell me the public can vote for the next Head Auror? I’d vote for you!”
Rolling his eyes, Harry shook his head. “You guys are impossible. How about I show you?” he offered.
“Are you okay, Harry?” Draco asked and frowned. From one second to the next, he suddenly looked really ill.
“What are you thinking, Dray?” a voice brought him out of his dark place.
“Eric has a gift for guessing people’s names” the man sitting at the table said. “He’s got a talent, though he’s not always right about it.”
“No!” Draco called out and laughed, when Severus put his arm around his shoulders.
Draco sighed and fell onto a couch, rubbing his forehead. “Better than this morning, to be honest. But still not incredibly well.”
Harry winked at him and he splashed some water over Draco. While the cold water ran down over his clothes, he looked after Harry who had taken off, laughing loudly. Draco snorted and wandlessly made a wave break over his boyfriend who squealed in surprise before he went under.
Draco was sure that there were about twenty magical animals hiding in this room. Nevertheless, he really wanted to see what books were up here and not in the family library. Maybe this would help him more than all the rather well preserved books down in the cellar.
“McGonagall” Harry said and shook his head. “I can’t believe they’re playing bingo with our relationship.” He walked to a couch and fell onto it. Padfoot walked over, licking his hand, before he headed back to his toy.
Harry nodded. “It’s fine.” Blaise looked extremely rueful. “It was actually a good joke, if we ignore the past. So, well done. It took me by surprise.”
“Ravo. The penguin.” Harry turned to parchment, so Draco could see it. There were two handwritings visible, his own neat and carefully placed one and then Harry’s child handwriting.
