"That's very true, though I quite like the work we get. Oh, and before I forget, would you like to accompany me to the library tomorrow after classes? Ginny, you're, of course, welcome to come too."
"I could ask you two the same thing, but I suppose you were too busy moaning and snogging one another's faces off," Harry replied coldly, making both boys blush slightly.
The two Gryffindors  made their way back to their beds, while Madame Pomfrey continued to scold Harry for walking on his ankle.
Do you think they're dating? Harry Potter's really gone bonkers, hasn't he? I heard Snape caught them shagging in the halls.
Harry could hear the murmurs as he shuffled over to the Gryffindor table. Though he didn't know for sure what they were saying, he knew it was about him, and he knew it couldn't be a good thing. It never was.
"For your information, Pansy, I'm no different this year than you are. I simply grew up, and it's time you did the same."
Christ, he really needed to not smoke so much; he sighed as he thought of Draco and how the air in the flat the past two or three weeks had been stale and dead. Draco was smoking like a chimney and Harry knew that he was the reason why. He didn't know why in hell he’d picked up the habit, except that it seemed the thing to do in a bar or club, and sometimes you just needed something to do with your hands.
Harry, for his part, was unperturbed; he was used to this, and as soon as he stepped out of the shadows in his blue jumpsuit with the Union Jack and "The Magical Mystery Tour" embroidered across the arse, the applause started again. He grinned and waved, before hopping gracefully atop the cannon, and twisting his body to slide in.
Ginny was snorting into her corndog, and on his other side, Ron was sharing his pain by blushing along with him. Harry sighed. "Somewhat. It's only been a day or so.”
Harry, for his part, played along, and Draco was pleasantly surprised to see that Potter, too, was a flexible lad, and in Draco's costume, well. The routine was impressive on more than one level.
Draco knew he was falling in love all over again, and when he lay in his cold and empty bed at night and watched the dawn break over the Seine, he couldn't remember why he had ever looked for anything else.
The area was cleaned and the rest of the show did go on, but not without rumblings and murmurs in the crowd…first that terrible fire, now this?
As luck would have it, he passed Wanderlust Wizarding Tours on his way home, and on impulse, stopped in, plopping himself down in front of a harried-looking lady and smiling winsomely. "Hi, my boss wants to get rid of me for six weeks so I can sow my wild wheat, rye, oats, whatever – what would you suggest?"
Harry blushed, and started to say that no, he hadn't, but he was pants at lying and everyone knew it. "He's amazing," he sighed, leaning against the tub. "I think he may even be a natural blond."
"Make fun of me all you want, but it looked so good and felt even better, so thick and soft, with a little wave in it like in fourth year when he looked like a slob, except that it worked for him, of course. Everything always fucking works for him.”
She desperately wanted to know how everything had gone, if Harry had fallen for Aaron, if things were going to be normal again - but she was afraid to, as well. She and Blaise had talked that morning over a late breakfast and both had been forced to admit that Harry and Draco, well, they gave them both hope. Hope that you really could find true love and work through the hard things and come out stronger. And both had admitted that seeing these two apart had been hard because in the end, Pansy and Blaise both had romantic streaks a mile wide that they tried very hard to camouflage, and they both wanted, more than anything, to see Harry and Draco cuddle, touch, kiss, and do all the things that they pretended made them sick to witness. Secretly, both Slytherins loved it.
He was feeling rather mellow when he turned in around two AM and the ringing of his bell at exactly eight AM was not exactly greeted with cheers and whistles, but he tipped the delivery guy anyway and shut the door, scratching and yawning.
"This would make a titillating, if disturbing article on sexual perversion, Potter, but I see nothing that would give us any idea of who wants to get rid of me." Draco handed the paper back and sighed. Why would anyone want to get rid of him? He was so…well, him!
"Yes, but she and Dumbledore go way back. Way, wayyyy back." Harry looked around and then made a rather rude gesture that said it all. Draco shuddered. "Ewww."
Harry returned the smile. "I have a long list of pleasures." This was true, and he had the scroll with same tucked into his back pocket.
The show went well; the new clown routine had been refined and the crowd roared with laughter in all the right places. Bill and Ron had created and worked out a new jump that was almost enough to stop your heart, and was greeted with wild applause. Harry hit the target on the first try, and Filch actually counted to four this time. The Not-Quite-Human Pincushion performed a one-man skit with a nail gun that was a huge success, and the Octo-Sapien created a lovely sushi sampler from his tail. Dumbledore debuted his new Ringmaster costume, which borrowed heavily from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the Malfoys were a sinuous vision in red silk.
Harry turned and smiled at him warmly, leaning over to kiss his lips lightly. "Going to see what they're going to do to Ginny; Lucius is, apparently, not going to press formal charges since no one actually got injured, but Ginny's still being sent away."
"Harry, calm down – no, I don't think he had a choice. I don't think he had any control over what happened, given his family's history and ties and you know this, for God's sake!" Now it was her turn to take a breath. "Why are you asking now, Harry?"
"We need to investigate," Harry said without preamble. "Before something else happens to you, cause it's pretty clear someone wants to kill you, or at the very least, maim you."
Harry knew she was right and he was over-thinking this, making more of it, assuaging some leftover guilt with his theory. But knowing something, as he was well aware, didn't always help.
"I'll certainly try." Harry felt other eyes on him and turned to see Onyx sitting on a chair and glowering at him, sensing his master's displeasure. He met the cat's eyes until the animal jumped down and stalked away into a closet.
"Well, do let me know how it goes. The testicles are a terrible place to have a skin condition, especially when they…"
"It's crowded as hell in here." Hello Captain Obvious, thought Draco with disgust. But Harry smiled.
"No choice? You don't think they had a choice?" Harry's voice was incredulous, and he stopped and took a breath, then another bite of brownie. "You're telling me Draco Malfoy had no choice? He bragged about being a DE, showed people his Mark!"
Harry again stayed behind; he didn't even know why, exactly, or what exactly he was looking for, but like the footprint, there had to be something. This was obviously not the work of a master criminal or else they wouldn't have been this careless in the first place. He got down on his hands and knees at the edge of the mat; something looked rather shiny. He got closer and tentatively brushed his fingertip over the spot; his finger came away with some tacky substance on it. His brows drew together; he'd seen this before. Or, he thought with a sniff, he'd
He voiced this thought to Potter, who merely looked at him and said, "I think you just answered your own question."
"I've apologized to him, though, you know? I've said I was sorry, said I was wrong, said I would do anything to make it up to him, and he doesn't want to hear it." Draco had forgotten momentarily that he wasn't supposed to be talking about them, but about Aaron and Harry's respective boyfriends.
In the ring, the clowns were tripping over each other, having formulated a new routine that was far from perfected – oddly enough, this seemed to make it funnier and Draco found himself giggling along with the crowd. Then the fire-eater took the stage, followed by the chimera, the dancing hippogriffs and the nifflers playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Toad" on the xylophone. A few illusions from the twins – and damned if they weren't good illusions, too - and then the Weasleys took wing.
The next act involved a skit with the Bearded Lady and the Fire Eater which resulted in singed eyebrows and mustaches all around. Then more clownfoolery and then, finally, it was time to close the show with the Marvelous Malfoys.
The mood once the crowd had gone was somber, and each performer went back to their respective homes deep in thought - if not for exactly the same reasons.
"Maggie agreed to this?" His secretary was the most unabashedly honest person he knew and normally would not lie for him under any circumstances; money, theater tickets, expensive meals, spa trips - the woman could not be bought. He had tried.
The Guardian was quiet on a Monday night, and it was not hard to spot the dark head in the last booth near the wall. Harry walked over and reached down, taking Draco's arm. "Come with me."
Harry bit his lip and resigned himself to waiting. And waiting. And waiting some more. That diplomat must have unreal staying power, the bastard.
"Pretend I'm not here and do whatever you normally would. Like put on makeup, or choose an outfit or whatever.”
He set the cast of the footprint down. "The second incident was, of course, the sticking of the Malfoys –specifically Draco – to their mat, so that they were helpless to move. Since charms are not permitted in this arena, save from Dumbledore, it couldn't be a sticking charm, so Muggle means were used, specifically a form of what Muggles call "Super Glue." Not a substance usually found around here, but Seer Trelawney uses it regularly to fix her eyeglasses, which have been broken many times. The culprit stole Sybill's tube of Super Glue and used a minute amount, mixed with a bit of water, to make sure that the spots where Draco and Lucius' hands and foot respectively would land were coated."
"Both of us?" Blaise sighed. "I was planning on getting pleasantly sloshed and chatting up the bartender."
Ginny's face was scarlet and he wondered momentarily if she was just pissed off or choking and pissed off. Fortunately (or unfortunately), it turned out to be the former. "Harry! You should not be lusting after men! You should be lusting after girls, specifically me! Why do you think I wear these revealing outfits and makeup? For fun?"
Potter was scrawny, still, and pale, except for the brilliant red and gold of the phoenix tattoo that spread across his back, its wings raised in victory. Draco traced the outline of the bird, reading the names etched into its feathers – all the Order who had died in the pursuit of freedom. The War had been only nine years ago, but it felt like another lifetime to him and, he suspected, to Harry too.
She smiled at him and turned away, Onyx yowling as he was stepped over; Harry locked eyes with the cat once more, but this time, it was him that turned away, walking down the street. He would never walk the Enge Kirkesteed again, but it would remain, of course, a lovely memory.
Harry watched, completely entranced, and tried not to think about how, erm, limber Draco was and how beautiful he looked as he bent and swayed. This was something no mere picture could convey…not even a wizarding one. This was…well, magic. And he was resolutely NOT thinking about how flexible Draco must be in other ways. He wasn't. At all.
Yes, he was young…they were young. And yes, they were settled together and not every moment was fireworks and shooting stars. But there was love there and Draco cursed himself regularly for ever finding love – real love - either scary or boring.
Draco lay there in the dark room, still sticky, still feeling Harry's heat on him, and felt, for the first time in years, tears prickle the back of his eyes.
Dumbledore looked at him hard, but nodded, and casting a quick Sonorous called for everyone - everyone - to assemble on the bleachers. Harry led Draco over to sit beside Molly Weasley, figuring if he was right, then Molly was perhaps the one person in the circus the perpetrator wouldn't dare cross. Draco was as safe there as he could possibly be.
He looked around in interest; no windmills and no one seemed to be wearing wooden clogs. There weren't even any dikes in sight. He thought of the inevitable rejoinder Ron would make to that observation, and had to smile as he lugged his suitcase into the hotel lobby, showing the bored desk clerk his receipt.
"Well," said Draco, standing. "I better go get ready; let's hope that tonight goes better than last time."
"No, no, I mean it's his problem, what he did." Draco leaned forward, desperate to make his point. "It didn't have anything to do with not loving you or wanting you anymore. It was solely his own stupidity, his inability to express himself, his fear that you wouldn't understand how scared he was, his lack of faith in himself, not you. He loves you more than anything."
If he did; Draco felt like he knew Harry better now than he ever had, and knew himself even better. But what if it still wasn't enough?
"Luck – pure, unadulterated luck, is all. And the flounder is not fictional. I saw him with my own eyes." Harry scratched in places only men felt comfortable touching in public. "Ask Simons, he was there."
Draco nibbled his lip. "He, well, he actually didn't talk to me about things either. Instead, he just started acting differently than he'd ever done before. He stayed at our flat but pretty much ignored me. If I tried to talk to him, he'd just say something nasty or something designed to make me feel like shit - like I didn't already feel as horrible as I could possibly feel."
He wrested his attention back to the situation at hand and cleared his throat. "I plan to expose the perpetrator of these incidents, so if you will all direct your attention here," he indicated the bag. "We can begin."
Harry turned even redder; goddamn Charlie anyway – he was going to kick his arse the next time he saw him
He fell asleep on the bed and woke late afternoon, as the sun was setting. He made himself eat some toast, drink some tea; he smoked half a pack of cigarettes, staring out the window at nothing. His fight with Harry had left him drained in ways he couldn't explain to anyone if he had to.
Draco was shaking uncontrollably, and fancied he could feel the hot, rancid breath of the creature on him still. Harry was at his side in a moment, and for once, Draco was absurdly glad to see him.
"Do you?" It was an automatic response; Harry knew full well that curiosity could kill both cats and full-grown men, but reasoned that having avoided certain death by Unforgivable and traveled through the train station of the afterlife, that he was probably safe from this particular danger.
Harry rested his forehead against Draco's shoulder and twined his fingers in Draco's hair, his other hand reaching into his shirt, ripping the buttons away so he could rub the rough pads of his fingers over tender nipples before reaching down to stroke, tug and twist Draco's cock, smearing the pre-come over the head and using it for soothing the friction of his hand against the soft skin. He set a rhythm in time with his thrusts, his body remembering everything about Draco; how to rock against him, how to move his hips to change the angle and force of the thrust, and Harry let his body take over, his mind echoing one word over and over.
Besides, Harry was a big advocate of "going green" and figured he was doing his part, organically speaking, plus supporting local entrepreneurs. Think globally, act locally, right?
Harry was making designs with his coaster mat on the dampness of the table and looked up when he came back and slid in opposite him. "Sure you're okay there?"
The day passed remarkably swiftly; Harry made his rounds, and found that most people were quite pleased with what the Malfoys had added to the show, although a few grumbled about how show-offy an act it was, and what was wrong with a good old elephant, flaming hoop and freak show? As always, Harry listened and nodded and watched; he really couldn't imagine a more interesting place to live and work. He had some minor words with Filch about his lack of aim, and engaged in further speculation with Ron about just what could be causing that rash; Ron was his best friend and was really the only one Harry would consider discussing an upper-thigh skin condition with. They both agreed that Filch was probably on the take and using a lower-grade blasting powder and resolved to get some to test, because after all, if Harry ever did get a chance with Draco, a red, bumpy nether region was the last thing he wanted to worry about.
And he was going to be here. Here at The Magical Mystery Tour, in the ring, in the spotlight! All of him in that tight white costume, or maybe the silver one with the rings or the black one…oh Merlin, the black one with the sides held together with thin silver cords ... Harry sighed and lay back on his pillow, taking matters in hand.
Harry grinned; he had a distinct fondness for a 'certain substance' and this seemed like an opportunity too good to pass up.
Dudley had seen him off with a clumsy hug and a baggie of green stuff and since then, Harry had managed to keep himself supplied – he figured it was better than booze and less expensive than designer potions, geared for the old-money set who were now out on their collective butts, armed with only whatever they'd been able to hide before the Ministry seized their assets. The potions were cheap, with substandard ingredients badly mixed and Harry had seen them cause more trouble than they were worth.
It was a dismissal, and pleasantly high though he was, it still stung, and he moved several steps back, standing there for a long moment until he turned and walked away.
Draco's lip turned up at the edge. "Good." He looked around. "So what do you do on days when there are no performances?"
The smile became a tad more genuine. "I would have to tell you, then, that I am a miserable cook, and have not followed footie in years and years." She reached back then and pulled the black silk tie out of her hair, letting loose a silky fall of blonde over her shoulder, the movement obviously deliberately choreographed to be seductive.
“You are fucking unbelievable!” Harry had looked like he wanted to say more – much more - but the words had caught in his throat and he had swallowed and turning, grabbed his jacket and left the room. Seconds later, the crack of apparition had echoed in the foyer.
They reached the tent and Draco went in first, as befit his status, and looked around. Serviceable enough – with a few touches here and there, it might actually be live-able as well. Lucius followed and was able to keep his lip from curling only by a supreme act of will. While he outwardly chastised his son for being a pessimist, he himself had to admit that this was a rather discouraging comedown. But surely it was only temporary, and soon, the funds they would be generating would allow them a serious upgrade in accommodations. Until then, he chose to think of it as a fun sort of "roughing it."
She tilted her head. "Certainly." The voice was soft, deep, vaguely husky. "Would you rather conduct our business in English, then?"
He thought about the rest of his life with no Draco in it - and only then did he finally break down and cry himself to sleep.
Lucius clapped a hand over Draco's mouth before he could say anything else, and shook his head. "No, Harry - that will be all."
"Really? Wow. I am a dedicated employee." Harry nodded. "But fine, I'll clear up my files and go in a few days."
Blaise took the nearly gone cigarette from Draco's fingers and finished it again. "What were you looking for on www.comeandgetit.com? A book club partner?"
It had started innocently enough; both of them tired, both of them just wanting the other to tend to their needs, neither wanting to give, only take. For Draco, that was par for the course; for most of their relationship, Harry had given, and he had taken, and it had gone along like that until Draco had nearly forgotten what it was to be concerned for another before himself. And most of the time, Harry went with it, occasionally rolling his eyes at some of Draco’s demands, but doing it all the same. Tonight had been different.
"I guess," he said, looking around blearily. "But what you see is what you get. No smart ass comments."
Harry stretched then, and Draco saw something small and gold flash in the lights; but then it was gone again. "Do you - I mean, are you a regular here?"
Harry shrugged and looked down for a long moment before looking up again. "What about you? You said you were in the same boat, so to speak."
He sank back down on the couch beside her then and they sat in silence for a while, until Pansy said casually, "I saw Harry this morning, on my way here."
Dumbledore spent the entire next day questioning people, asking them if they had seen or sensed anything, and if so, would they describe what it had been. He got a lot of nonsensical answers and a few worth thinking over, which was about what he had expected. Harry didn't mention the footprint he'd found, but wasn't quite sure why he didn't, except that he had a feeling it would be important somewhere down the road. A new big-top tent was procured, and the elder wizards all participated in raising it and casting a host of protective spells on it; this time, a handful of others were granted access to the wards inside the tent, to ostensibly prevent such a disaster from ever happening again.
Once inside, the door shut and locked and barred against the rest of the world, Draco turned to Harry and asked simply, "Now what?"
Then he shoved his ID and some money in his pocket and went looking for – well, he didn't know what he was looking for.
The next morning found him longing for coffee, pastry, and weed, and not necessarily in that order, so he dressed and left the hotel, finding another shop that appeared to exist merely to cater to his special needs; specifically, his need for Irish coffee, which was a fabulous way to start the first day of the rest of his life.
The stylist was waiting expectantly and Harry mentally shook himself, instead thinking of how completely pissed off Draco would be to see him now. Good.
Blaise and Draco exchanged pained glances. "Darlingest?" Draco mouthed to Blaise, who made kissing noises and a rather obscene hand gesture at the same time, causing Draco to nearly choke on his vodka and Pansy to glare at both of them in turn. Draco chose to tune Pansy out then, his thoughts returning to Harry in those leather trousers and mesh shirt, and okay, fine, the hair too. His own trousers were feeling uncomfortably tight and he looked up only when Pansy snapped her mobile shut. "We're in luck! Paul has time this afternoon since someone cancelled. But we need to go NOW." She pulled out some money and left it on the table. "Up, up boys!"
While it was mostly the younger Weasleys who attempted the most daring moves, the elders were no slouches and on the ground, Lucius Malfoy had to grudgingly admit that the rather stodgy appearances of the parents belied their strength and grace. And while the daughter had a rather large posterior, it hadn't affected her ability to fly through the air with the greatest of ease, as it were.
Harry nodded and dug into his jacket pocket for his pack of cigarettes, but Draco beat him to it; they sat back against the leather seats of the booth and smoked in relative silence for a couple of minutes, each thinking his own thoughts, Draco covertly watching the other man. Harry finally broke the silence.
When he opened his eyes, Harry was staring at him and when he spoke, his voice was quiet again. "You don't need to apologize – hell, it wasn't you, after all. And it's nice of you to try to encourage me. I appreciate it."
He hadn't set out to be the lead singer in a rock band; in fact, he hadn't set out to be anything at all in particular, but when the Ministry of Magic basically tossed out the scions of the pureblood houses on their asses, he'd had to do something – and he'd be damned if he took some menial job, some low-rent position in the Ministry just to show how supposedly humble he now was. Draco Malfoy was many things, some unprintable, but humble was not one of them. He'd turned his back on wizarding society and began to explore the very world he'd been taught to despise, finding that his esteemed father had been wrong about that, too.
Paul laughed. "That's descriptive. Yeah, this guy told me he used to be pants at dancing, but he'd been coming out for about a month and finally just gave in and went with the beat - good call on his part. And the other thing that was incredibly sexy? He has this tattoo of a dragon on his back; I saw it the night the air conditioner broke at Goo Lagoon, and everyone was stripping. It was a huge dragon that curled around his spine and had some writing circling on it in gold, very cool."
"Oh, shit, Draco!" he responded, slipping his jacket off. "Ever heard of a simple hello? It's a general colloquial expression that has been around for ..."
Harry shrugged and stubbed out his cigarette. "I like your band; the music is pretty good, even considering that you sing it. And I do occasionally get out of the house. Scotch, cigarettes, and food don't appear on their own, you know?"
Harry sat there on the couch like a stone, unable to think of anything else save Draco's halting words.
He thought about himself, how angry he'd been and still was, how hurt and afraid he'd been when he saw that same number, over and over again. How he'd deliberately set out to change everything Draco knew of him, everything he knew of himself as well. He thought about coming home, being in the same bed and not being able to reach out and touch; how just the sight of Draco on his desktop computer made him want to Incendio the whole setup. He thought about going to bed alone, or worse, with someone he never wanted to see again, and waking up alone.
"If that's what you do – I'm not going for pornography here, though. Just be yourself. Be whoever you are when you're not being a, a – lady of the evening. Or lad of the evening, or whatever, all right?"
A pretty ordinary week day night actually; Draco was leaning forward on his elbows, busily writing stuff down in his planner while peering at the screen of his desktop computer, while Harry stretched out on the couch, reading. Occasionally, one of them would look up and catch the other one's eye and smile, then go back to what they were doing.
He stood there for a long moment, stunned; Draco had not only visited this website every day for the last month, he had also made God knows how many calls to what amounted to a male escort service. "Fun and companionship," his fucking arse!
The crowd roared and waved, and the family waved back before going into their first drop, one so sudden and so unexpected, that it always caused gasps, as it did this time as well. Bill flipped over three times before his brother Ron caught his hand and pulled him up, only to fling him at Charlie, who rolled over him on his way to the other side.
There were many things Harry could have said in return to that, but he settled for, "He may be drunken and a tad indiscriminate but he always gets his bloke. It will be fine, Malfoy. I can take care of myself."
"I just wanted to go to sleep; it had been a night where everything had crashed in on me, I'd had a horrible time out, felt guilty, all that shit. I felt him slide over to my side and wrap his arm around my waist and start touching me. And no matter what else I'm feeling, he knows how to touch me. We started having sex, and I had to push it all down and pretend it wasn't my Draco, that it wasn't the person I love more than anything stroking me and kissing me, but I finally did it. Then I looked up at him and saw his face and had this sudden thought of how many other guys have seen his "come" face?"
Around him, girls were screaming Milo's name and, as expected, flashing him their chests, stomachs, and in an extreme case, below deck, as Oliver Wood used to say. Harry barely noticed – his eyes were fixed on Milo.
"Hi yourself," replied Draco, catching his breath a bit. Tonight, Harry looked more like the boy he'd wanted all those years ago than he had since, well, all those years ago. And it took all Draco's resolve to not reach out and touch him.
"No, by myself; I'll be late, I think, so don't wait up, k?" Harry rolled up the important mail and tossed the rest in the bin. He pulled out his wallet and checked his funds. "Excellent. I'll see you when I see you."
He'd get a badly watered-down drink – unless it was beer in a bottle, and Draco DID have his standards – and go the balcony that all clubs seemed to have and scan the crowd for a black-haired man who would no doubt be either merely swaying in place or awkwardly cavorting around like a newborn calf; Harry couldn't dance to save his life. He was also terrible with chatting people up and generally rather socially awkward in crowds, which is why Draco usually arranged their social calendar - or had. It had been empty now for over a month.
Kingsley bit his lip so as to not laugh - it was better to not encourage Potter these days. "Have you partnered with many pixies in such a state?"
The words were coming hard to him now… Harry didn't get it. He was looking for reasons to reject him. "You…I…I tried Harry! I tried but you were angry and hurt and didn't want to hear it, and by the time I realized why I'd done what I did, it was like you had moved to another fucking continent, emotionally! What the hell else was I supposed to do? Body-bind you and make you listen? No! I wanted you to listen because you cared and wanted to know why I was an asshole. And if you would only listen to Aaron, then you would only listen to Aaron! I did this…" he swept a shaking hand up and down his body. "For you! To get inside your head, to understand how you felt, to, God, fuck, to be with you, Harry. I love you."
"I'm already beautiful, Pansy – wait, no, no, no, I am not changing one single damn thing about myself!”
"It was brutal." Harry's tone was flat. "I've never been much of a liar, but I rose to the occasion that one time – and I won't ever forget his face when I said it. Draco's not - he's not an open person. He makes getting to know him work. It took me two years to crack that shell of his, I thought I knew him, thought he knew me, but for the whole last month we were together, he was ordering up sex like takeaway because I wasn't enough anymore, apparently."
Harry had shrugged and handed him the cue for his turn, not saying any more about it; and for the rest of the night, Draco had watched him, trying to sort out all his feelings so that when the day DID come, he could express what was in his heart and head in a way that Harry would understand – and not take as his fault. Because it wasn't, and it never had been. Never in all the time they were together had Draco truly felt like he deserved Harry, or been sure that Harry would want him forever. But the long nights alone – then watching Harry relate to other people who wanted him – and now, talking to him, truly TALKING to him? He knew he was wrong. Harry did want him, as much as Draco wanted him in return; and God, did Draco want him. It was the way he moved; the way he used his entire body to do even the smallest things. It was the half smile that played across his lips or the big open grin, the way he propped his head against his palm and listened to Draco like he was the most fascinating person in the world. It was the offer to walk him home to make sure he got there okay. It was the questions he asked after Draco had told him something, the way he reasoned things out in his mind before saying anything, as if making sure he gave good feedback. It was the way he got shy once in a while and cast his eyes down, then looked up through inky lashes.
The Colchester gambit paid off; Harry did call Maggie to see if it was legit, and God bless her, she'd lied her innocent little heart out for Draco, thereby earning her raise handsomely. Draco stayed in his small flat in Paris, Apparating when he trawled the clubs.
"Hmmm? Sorry, did I miss something?" Harry was watching him, one eyebrow raised in the first familiar gesture of the night.
The Magical Mystery Tour was also home to a generous helping of what could be loosely termed "freaks;" the Bearded Lady, who had recently changed her look to a very distinguished goatee; the Vampire Pomeranian who would suck the blood from your ankle if you should meet him in the dark of night; the Human Pincushion, who was not human at all, but a goblin with identity issues and an unholy tolerance for pain. These folk, along with various and sundry others comprised the circus, and like any other group of people forced together by proximity and need for money considered themselves a family.
"Either way it packs a punch; three of those and I'm on the floor somewhere or against the wall and won't remember a damn thing afterwards." He gave the shot glasses to the bartender. "I'll be sticking with tequila for my shots, thanks."
"Fuck you, Zabini - and buy your own cigarettes." Draco took it from him and dragged deeply, exhaling a cloud of smoke. He'd smoked more in the last couple of weeks than he had in six months total. Harry hadn't said anything about the gray layer of stale smoke hanging in the air in the flat, just casually opened a couple of windows on his way through; in the past, he would have nagged Draco to distraction over it until Draco stopped just to shut Harry up.
Harry got up abruptly and left the flat himself, not stopping for his wallet, his keys, anything. Fuck it.
A million feelings were spinning through his head as he took Draco in. There had to have been a glamour, true, but the face wasn't that different. How in hell had he not known? How had he not seen Draco underneath?
"Living" was waking up next to someone you loved and feeling them curl against you in their sleep. It was knowing how they took their coffee and what part of the paper they'd want to read first. It was drying them off when they stepped out of the shower, and smiling when your mobile rang and it was them. It was falling back asleep at night, thoroughly shagged and smelling your lover's scent all over you.
"Isn't it?" Charlie looked over his shoulder and admired how the satin clung in all the right places.
"Oi," said Draco, resting his forehead on the table. "Pans, Blaise - you don't really think he might…?" He trailed off, not even wanting to say the words.
When everyone was present and accounted for, Dumbledore ordered everyone to take a look around and check their quarters for anything suspicious. Knowing the Weasleys would scour their home, Harry decided to go with Draco and Lucius to check their quarters, which proved to be difficult ... because they were gone, burned to a cinder; nothing remained of their tent, or their belongings.
Harry was pulling on his jacket and sliding his wand into his pocket. "Ron was here; he came in to tell me the news and say sorry on behalf of the family, which is rubbish, cause I don't blame any of them, ever…and then he saw you there and had a fit of temporary hysterical blindness. He'll be all right though, in time." Draco had to laugh, and got up as well, dressing quickly. He wanted to see this.
Cheered, he went back to his office, which he shared with another Auror, the aforementioned Adams. "I'm going on vacation, Sam," he told him. He enjoyed the irony of the name, as Adams was a rabid teetotaler, hence his deep need for coffee. "Apparently, I have a lot of time, and Shacklebolt is afraid I need a break from the rigors of work."
"No - why, was one of your escorts supposed to call? Do they miss you? Are you funding their gym memberships?"
At that point, he'd usually be hustled away to meet the Premiere of Some Country He'd Never Heard Of, with whom he'd have to converse in awkward sign language for the next half hour.
He hadn't called in days – when Harry came home from work, there were no messages flashing on their machine. His mobile rang, sure, but it wasn't Draco - it was Ron, Hermione, sometimes Neville, or Ginny or whoever.
"No problem." His throat felt dry as dust and he sipped his vodka to moisten it. Harry didn't move away, just turned his back to the bar as well, surveying the crowd.
Draco stared at the spot where the tent had been and had to bite back tears; Malfoys never cried. Harry had caught his breath when he saw the ruins and hesitantly placed a hand on Draco's shoulder, which was rudely shaken off. "I don't like to be touched."
Even Lucius was pleased; he had negotiated a profit-sharing arrangement with Dumbledore and tonight he had netted a fair amount of funds, which he had sent directly to Gringott's. The Malfoy vault was looking a tad low these days but with luck, that unfortunate situation was temporary at best. Something decent had to come out of all of this.
Harry looked up with that "skrewt caught in the headlights" look that he was rather known for, and blushed. "Molllllllyyyyy!"
She pulled Draco into the door of a very tony, very posh salon and up to the desk where a young man was idly doodling in the appointment book. "Paul, my love, how are you?"
The crowd regarded this with a bit more trepidation; it was true that Hagrid was of the opinion that half the fun of having an animal act (if one must be had at all) was audience interaction. He frequently brought the gentler animals to the front row so that the braver children could touch them or speak to them – the only issue arose when Hagrid and the crowd disagreed on what could be termed "gentle." Hagrid was of the opinion that if the creature wasn't foaming at the mouth or snarling, it was gentle, while others insisted that if the animal was eyeing the human as though they were an all you can eat buffet, that it wasn't safe. These disagreements often became loud and included a lot of gesturing, raised voices and an occasional threat of a hex or two. However, tonight was not one of those nights and after a niffler had turned a series of somersaults for a biscuit, and two love-struck kneazles harmonized on a feline version of "Can't Get Enough of You Baby," it was time for the Winged Weasleys.
A few feet away, a match struck brick and a brief flare of light illuminated the face of his unexpected companion.
Frankly, Draco wouldn't put it past Lucius to find a way to bitch at them from the underworld, and of course he'd find a way to do it while they were both naked, the pervy bastard. So, Harry was dressing in a slutty manner, doing shots of liquor that resulted in him being pinned against the wall, having Merlin knows what done to him (although Draco could well imagine), smoking and talking to strange men like he'd been doing it all his life.
Or had he just stopped noticing his lover's body about the time he started taking the man who inhabited it for granted?
He caught up with Hagrid outside the animal tent, and as usual, the half-giant was muttering about the animals in his care, how no one except him cared for them, that with all these new acts coming in, they should just let them go, and so on and so forth. Harry had heard it all before, so he just listened as they walked down to the cages to check on the animals for the night.
Blaise snorted in the corner but said nothing. Draco sighed. "I want to find Harry, yes, more than anything. But I don't see the point of this. If I pick him up, so to speak, he will eventually figure out it's me and be totally pissed off that I resorted to less than honest means to find him."
"Uhm, well, probably not," he replied, realizing he had no idea what she was saying, but deciding it was probably dirty. "But thank you."
He squeezed her hand again and let go. "Okay. You're right, and I'm overreacting, as usual. Thanks for being the voice of reason."
"It was, surprisingly. And I enjoy it; the money is ridiculous, even by my standards, and I have my pick of bed partners, booze, and whatever else I want. It's a good life for those who can handle it. Plus," and he looked around casually, "It's nice to have our powers in this world."
After satisfying himself that the money count was correct – thereby inviting the ire of Minerva McGonagall, who had bristled when her addition was questioned – he betook himself off to his tent for a little quiet reflection, and to steam his velvet gown with the real Italian gold trim.
"Well, this is an improvement – now you're actually calling in the morning and not in the middle of the night. And you addressed me by name and said you had a question. AND you have on pants. Good job."
"That's not the point, 'Arry," Hagrid grumbled. "The point is that these poor creatures are caged and kept captive an' they were never s'posed to be. Now, here, looka this one. Bobo was meant to roam free, if 'eva an animal was. Weren't you, Bobo? Ain't he a beautiful creature, 'Arry?" Harry looked at Bobo doubtfully; a dwarf pigbear wasn't HIS idea of beauty, but it was all in the eye of the beholder as they said. "If you say so, Hagrid."
He closed his eyes as they kissed; the lip ring was exciting, it’s cool metal rubbing against his lips as the kiss deepened. It was a surprisingly gentle kiss, more so than he would have expected, and the touches were almost affectionate, familiar. Again, Harry was struck by a feeling of – not déjà vu, but something, something.
Harry was still smarting over the very idea that he could be sexually inadequate. "I'm sure Management would." He dragged his suitcase over to the elevators and waited alongside what looked to be a professional party person, complete with way too much makeup and conversely, far too little clothing – not that Harry was complaining. He did love sightseeing.
Harry was barely awake when the knock sounded on his front door the next day; he hadn't fallen into fitful sleep until somewhere in the vicinity of five AM, and he'd been so wasted that he had never made it to his bed, but had tumbled off the couch into a pile of laundry that needed folding. It was comfortable enough down there with the pajama bottoms, t-shirts, towels and the like, and it was there he remained until the banging on his door caused him to blink, raise his head, and then rap it smartly on the table.
Harry might not be at the top of his game, Auror-wise these days, but when something tickled at the edges of his mind, he listened. His actions might be a tad unorthodox but his instincts were rarely wrong. And somehow, something here felt odd, off. He studied her for a long moment, until she shifted under his gaze and looked down, then back up through heavy black lashes. "All right, lover, are we doing this tonight, or not?"
"Nice. So, what you're saying is that you saved the world, were feted by the Ministry, were poised to be the next Everything and then bailed, hid, and now drink and smoke your days away – when you aren't fanboying Muggle bands."
Draco was so used to not sleeping at night these days that he reflected that he better adapt the nature of his business to something nocturnal if he had any hope of ever actually being there to inspire his employees to – to what? Hell, that's what he had minions and yes men for. Actually, he could probably never show up again and no one would notice. Two months ago, that realization might have dismayed him; now he saw it as more time he could spend with Harry, assuming he could convince Harry to ditch work and agree to never leave Draco's bed/whirlpool tub/side ever again.
"That's what people say," Harry replied, thinking that the special he was referring to was a mite different then what Darcy probably meant, but whatever.
"I look like a rentboy - an expensive one, yes, but still, fuck, Pansy, I still need to go to work every day!"
Harry nodded and pulled up his pants, giving him a manufactured smile, the same one he gave to his superiors, the Wizengamot, his dealer, and Ginny when she was in a mood. It was sincerely insincere and had gotten him slapped more than once. Darcy didn't look any more fooled than Gin normally did. Damn women – or men, as the case might be.
His breathing quickened as he felt his orgasm build, and Draco strained against the knowing hand on his cock, wanting more friction, demanding it, even as he pushed harder and harder against Harry, their damp skin slapping wetly together. Draco was squeezing the back of Harry's neck, the other hand clawing at his back through the thin fabric of his T-shirt. His head was thrown back against the cement and he was sure he would be bruised all up and down his shoulders and back.
Harry usually didn't like to be ordered to do anything – in his mind, he'd already spent a lifetime taking orders and doing what everyone else wanted, so when he was sitting in Shacklebolt's office, fidgeting on the worn velvet chair and lacing and unlacing his fingers, he was already on edge.
"Yes, sorry." He rubbed his face. "And before you ask, no, I'm not high – yet. So, what was this experiment?"
"Fine, four – I forgot about your personal space issues. And besides, there are roughly 3,000 working prostitutes in Amsterdam, so you have 2,999 left to choose from."
He closed his eyes again, but it didn't stop the tears sliding from underneath his lashes and down his cheeks.
It's not like they both hadn't looked at online porn before; hell, Harry had discovered it (by accident, of course) and yelled for Draco to come look. They had spent time discussing various personages on screen and rating them on a scale of one to ten - sometimes twenty - but they had done it together.
Always pure my arse, thought Draco sardonically. A clan that had produced both his mother and darling psychotic Auntie Bellatrix was a winner for sure. He opened the book to where the parchment was bunched and smoothed it out, sliding it back into the binding and scanning the words written there.
Had he moved on? Grown tired of them not talking, gotten irritated, decided he didn't need this, didn't need him? Harry knew Draco had tried to talk to him many times but he hadn't been able to get past his hurt and anger. He would decide mid-day that yes, they needed to talk, they would talk, he'd come home early and they'd sit down with a bottle of wine and talk it all out, everything. And then they would be okay.
Harry had drunk half a Heineken when he was approached for the first time; he'd been there all of five minutes. He smiled, downed the rest of the beer and danced.
Harry was tempted to ask if the fact he was a dude who looked like a lady was supposed to be a secret, and then decided to keep quiet and eat a brownie, which he did as he followed Darcy into her room and shut the door behind him.
"Isn't this brilliant?" she continued. "Draco Malfoy…here, in our midst! He is SO HOT," she sighed, her eyes becoming dreamy. "That blond hair, those pecs, that tight arse…"
"Stay with me tonight?" Draco's voice was low, meant only for Harry, and Harry nodded. Together, they left the tent, and when Draco reached for his hand, Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco's and smiled.
Draco raised his glass, thankfully only saw water spots on the rim, and drank. It was good stuff, Courvoisier, and must have been a gift. When people were reduced to just giving you booze on special occasions, it meant no one knew you well enough anymore to give much thought to your interests. Or maybe it meant that your friends did know your interests, and therefore gave you booze -  he suspected Potter's situation was the latter.
Draco stared at the phone in his hand – he wanted to cry, but his tear ducts were empty, his eyes dry and head pounding.
The windows were blue tinted so as not to be patently obscene and run the risk of being shut down, but behind them he could glimpse people moving, see heads thrown back and arms raised. Shadows, yes, and profiles. One profile, at least.
The crowd was getting restless as Draco tried to move, tried to tug his hands up off the mat, but they were stuck fast. Above them, the light shimmered and swayed, as the wires holding it there started to fray…and then tore free from its moorings altogether and plummeted down towards the two trapped men.
"Draco." Blaise sat down beside him on the chaise lounge he kept in his dressing room for, well, lounging. "Tell me something; you had a boyfriend who loved you, was in love with you, did what you wanted him to do even if he hated it, who, by your own admission was fabulous in bed, and just basically perfect otherwise. What in the hell possessed you to go and fuck that up with whores who'd been had by Christ knows who? I don't understand."
"Indeed," agreed Kingsley, who had heard wilder stories. "But no, that is not the reason, though I endured quite a bit of heat over that little switcheroo of yours. No, I've been reviewing your personnel file."
Sometimes, when Harry had seen a particular episode of a show forty-seven times, he'd mute the sound on the telly and flip on the radio, scrolling through the stations till something sounded interesting. Not necessarily good, but interesting.
"Don't worry, handsome – he'll be back. He's got himself a live one, a French businessman; kinky one, him, but harmless. I say give him half an hour." The whore leaning against her door was an older woman, but still firm, still ripe. She took a long drag off her cigarette and blew smoke at the sky. "I'd be happy to entertain you while you wait."
"It's fine?" This was a trap, if ever one had been laid. Being a sneaky, underhanded sort himself, he had a sixth sense for this sort of thing.
God, he was beautiful, and Harry couldn't remember the last time he had found someone beautiful. But Milo? He
Harry hadn't missed the stammer. "Sounds like you aren't sure what the status of your relationship is."
Harry glanced over at McGonagall, who looked stern and forbidding; Harry could almost hear her racking up the lost galleons from the past few performances and almost pitied Ginny
"Stay with me, Malfoy," Harry whispered before resuming his sucking and biting, and Draco wasn't sure if he meant in the moment or forever, but he didn't much care at this point; Harry was wrapped around him, and his hand was steadily moving - up his arse cheek and down inside the waistband of his trousers, his finger dipping and stroking up the crack till Draco gasped and clenched around his hand. Harry smiled against his skin at the sound, and still pinning Draco with a leg between both of his, Harry deftly unbuttoned the trousers and shoved his hand down the front of them, giving Draco's cock a rather hard squeeze and eliciting more moans. Draco kept one of his hands lodged in Harry's hair and reached down to fumble at Harry's jeans, ripping at the buttons and bruising his fingers in the process until he had yanked down the zipper and could rub his hand along the hard bulge and feel the heat radiating off him.
He wandered the streets idly until he came to the entrance of Amsterdam's famous red-light district. The day was cloudy and darker than it should have been, so the line of red lights glowed eerily in the murk.
Harry stared in the mirror when he was finally allowed to look; he was glad he'd worn his contacts and not his glasses, inexplicably cool though they now were. Though skeptical at first, he had to admit that the burgundy tones looked good, almost purplish -  they set off the black of his hair well. Well, what was left of it at any rate; most of his hair was being swept up, the remainder gelled into soft spikes. He looked like a character from Bleach, an anime show he'd gotten Draco hooked on. They'd always watched it weeknights together before bed, before Draco had…
After an hour or so of aimless wandering, he found a small coffee shop that sold both excellent, thick coffee – on purpose, and not because it had been left too long on the burner – as well as other herbal necessities, and settled in for an hour or three, making conversation with a few pretty girls. Harry had found that a little weed always helped things along for him socially, and now was no exception.
Draco didn't know how long he'd been in there when he heard the door open and Harry's voice. "Aaron, mate? Are you all right? You’re not sick are you?"
Harry was biting his lip now. "I waited till I knew he was about to orgasm, and then said, "Are you almost done?" Harry laughed, but there was no amusement in the sound. "His face changed then and he was so hurt. And then the next morning he was really pissed off at me and I just thought, "Yeah, see how it feels to have someone you love act like they don't want you.”  That's what I mean about power."
Harry looked up at Draco, who was standing opposite him at the table, his hands gripping the curve of the chair. "You got me there - I don't know what the fuck, Malfoy." He went back to his paper, a moment before it was ripped away from him.
Harry was about to stop shooting when a large black cat with green eyes streaked past his legs and jumped on Darcy's lap, rubbing against him and making soft noises. An entirely unguarded smile crossed Darcy's face then, and Harry felt an odd jolt of recognition that was gone as soon as it had appeared.
While still scorning most things Muggle, Draco had developed what Harry thought was a rather disturbing attachment to information technology, but every time he started to harass Draco over it, he would be forced to admit that he loved the laptop Hermione had gotten him for his birthday and would settle for rolling his eyes as Draco demanded that Harry come peruse his latest E-Bay purchase.
Harry was staring somewhere over their heads. "He's always awake when I come home. He pretends he's not, but I know when he's sleeping; he wheezes like an old teakettle, this little, constant whee, whee, whee sound." The corner of his lip quirked upwards. "It's a weirdly comforting sound that he absolutely insists he doesn't make, but anyway. He's never asleep. So, one night I came home and got into bed - and yeah, we still sleep in the same bed, how fucked is that - and I turned on my side to face the window, like I always do nowadays, cause facing him hurts." Harry took a deep breath, and lit a cigarette to momentarily distract himself, taking a deep drag and exhaling upwards towards the ceiling fans whirring lazily above them.
The day seemed interminable, and when five o'clock came and they still hadn't showed up, Harry moped off into the field just beyond the cluster of tents and climbed a tree to pout - and also to hide from Ginny, who seemed determined to snog him today. They had to be coming, right? Dumbledore wouldn't lie. Well, actually, he would, but generally not where funds were concerned. All the performers in the show answered to him, but he only answered to Minerva. Frankly, Dumbledore was less terrifying.
"Down Under" was a popular place; not just for its servers who were all gorgeous men, with equally gorgeous Australian accents, but also because its back room came equipped with padded walls and padded benches, so that when someone did go "Down Under," their knees wouldn't give out. Ever-changing fountains provided a means to wash out one's mouth and complimentary mints and handy-wipes were close at hand, offered by a ubiquitous little man who was, rumor had it, a human tripod and available for threesomes.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Don't be a wise-ass." I could only BE so lucky, he thought, then shook his head. "No, the first rule is "Keep your friends close, and your enemies stupefied." Its classic … also good advice. And unless you're a whiz at wandless magic, your wand should always be at the ready. So?"
The night was growing chillier by the moment, and Draco wished he'd brought something heavier to wear. He tried to pull down his net shirt, but it wasn't made for warmth, only for show. His shiver must have been noticed, because a jacket was handed to him then, and Draco hesitated for only a moment before slipping it on; the worn leather jacket smelled of smoke, cologne, and some other faint smell that must be just Potter; it wasn't unpleasant, at any rate. He nodded to Harry. "Thanks. So, well, I started exploring Muggle London, and met some people at a pub one night; they were singing along with that blasted karaoke machine and persuaded my drunken self to try a song. I did, they liked it, one thing led to another, and here I am. Voilá."
Draco had reflected in that moment that if there really were a hell (well, one worse than having Voldemort randomly killing Muggles on your formal dining room table) then his own personal one would be to have to relive these small moments when he knew for certain how his actions had affected Harry – and forever and ever, he would have to see the hurt in those eyes, hear the uncertainty in his voice, see the shadow pass over his face when he spoke about the night he'd found out that Draco had cheated on him and how afraid he was that Draco really didn't want him anymore.
A moment later he was back, looking flustered. "Shit, Zabini, home! I can't go home looking like this -  the game would be over in a hot minute.”
Girls and boys alike sighed over the oldest boy, Bill, whose actions were often reckless and impulsive; Charlie, the second oldest, whose costumes were a tad revealing; and the twins, Fred and George, whose feats in the air were nothing short of extraordinary. They often assisted Ringmaster Dumbledore in the main ring as well, and their constant patter was a source of much amusement to the crowd, as were the illusions they seemed able to pull out of thin air. Ron, the second youngest was the anchor of the group, his extreme strength holding many of the most difficult feats together. The youngest, Ginny, was the flirt of the group, and owls had finally been banned from the Big Top, when one too many met its end in a mid-air collision with one or the other of the Weasleys as it attempted to deliver her a message of undying love.
He didn't know, but before he could ride further on this train of thought, the light in the window behind him came on and he turned to see Darcy reclining on her daybed – his daybed, rather, looking a bit tired, but lovely as he remembered. Harry swallowed hard, and walked over to the window.
Harry got up and used the loo, taking a cursory glance in the mirror; his skin looked a little pale and he looked like he hadn't slept well, which he hadn't, because Draco wasn't there. Even angry, even jealous and hateful, whatever the emotion they were embroiled in at the time, as long as he was in the bed, Harry would sleep. And more often than not, when he awoke, those cool grey eyes would be watching him and if he turned and smiled at Draco, and reached out to stroke his cheek, the eyes would grow warm and he would open his arms to Harry who would willingly crawl into them. Because Draco was his home, no matter where he was.
Harry too was finding this all a little hard to take. He had seen the imprint and was pretty sure he knew who's it was, but he still didn't want to believe it. He tried to put it all out of his mind and was mostly successful. Mostly.
All his own 'boys' were blonds, without exception; he'd become known for it. And no matter what they wanted, he never gave them his name, never kissed them on the lips, and never let them do more than blow him, and it had taken him more than a month to let that happen.
Darcy moved his mouth down to Harry's jaw, his neck, nipping with sharp teeth, then licking the bitten flesh with a warm tongue; Harry closed his eyes and slid his hand into Darcy's hair, fisting it and tugging till his head tilted back and Harry could look into his eyes.
When all were assembled, Harry went behind the cannon, into the box of explosives clearly labeled "DO NOT TOUCH…OR ELSE!" in Filch's shaky handwriting, and came back with a small bag.
He felt Harry's chest rising and falling against his and felt his breath against his skin; and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's soaked back and buried his face in thick black hair. "I am yours and you're mine, I swear on my life."
“Just now.  Hermione and I apparated back early instead of taking the Express.  They’re letting the Seventh and Eighth Years do that this year,” Ron informed him.
Two hours later, Harry was finally finished his arduous task.  It had taken a toll on him to relive the ordeal. But now that he was finished, the real strain would begin.  With nothing else to divert his attention, Harry’s eyes traveled to the chair across from his desk.
“I’m not very good at babysitting.  I would have completely fallen apart if it weren’t for Draco.”  Sighing, Harry admitted, “I used Silencio on her. I’m so sorry.”
“Oh, it’s not only that,” Draco groused.  “I may as well not have come. They’re all only interested in your story.  Can’t say that I blame them.”
“I thought that once you had a taste, you would have gotten him out of your system,” Blaise said.  “All these years, I figured it was just lust after something you couldn’t have.  But you really love him, don’t you?”
Reluctantly, Draco gave up Harry’s hand to shake the one in front of him. “I thought you looked familiar,” he said unenthusiastically. He didn’t offer his own name.
“I want to get her something really special.  Believe it or not, Malfoy gave me a great idea,” Ron admitted.
Draco gave Harry the shorthand version of the story his mother told. Underemphasizing the part about his sister.
The Potions room was decked out in candlelight, rose petals and black satin.  Harry had outdone himself on the decorations. Valentine’s Day had never been particularly successful for him, but he was determined to make the night special.
In a restless mood, Draco took the Sherry from his ill- supplied liquor cabinet and poured a glass.  He settled onto his settee and opened the parchment book Harry had given him.
“I’m afraid you need to finish the potion by the end of class.  You’ll not pass on good looks alone, my boy” Slughorn laughed.
“Lie down,” Draco ordered, and pushed Harry back onto the bed, his head at the foot of the mattress.  “I think it will be better if I have control.”
Tracey thought she wanted a quick rubbing off, but she had to admit, it was wonderful to be given tender attention.  Anthony didn’t seem the sort at first, but at the moment she was very glad to have drawn his wand.
stupid, but I guess I am.  What’s it for?  I mean, I think I’ve figured out where to put it, but why? Is it jewelry?”
“Seriously?” Harry asked. He grabbed hold of Draco’s hand, not caring who saw, and prepared to disapparate.
Because so many professors left Hogwarts at times during the summer, only a handful of them were at any given meal. McGonagall was there, along with Professor Margeaux Bissette, who replaced Knox as Charms professor, and Madame Pomfrey.
“Supporting Harry,” he answered.  “Well, come on,” he addressed his House.  “Stand up for him.”  He motioned for the Gryffindors to join him.
“Good evening.  Uh, well, never mind . . . I guess,” Casper stammered.  “Good night.”  He turned on his heel and bounded down the staircase as fast as his legs would carry him.
“I don’t know.  Maybe.  Ron and I haven’t even discussed it much anyway.  This Christmas is much too soon, and I don’t want to wait a whole year.  What about you?  Have you thought about your wedding some day?” she asked.  She deftly picked up a piece of sauce covered shrimp with her chopsticks.
Harry paused to see if the journal would change anything.  He felt he was being honest with himself, so he was pleased when nothing changed.
Percy’s daughter, though only two months older than Rose, seemed to have grown a distinct personality already.  She smiled easily, and took in the world around her with wonder.  But Harry had a special place in his heart for Ron and Hermione’s daughter, and he suspected no other little girl would be able to wiggle her way in, no matter how adorable.
Harry smiled at the prospect.  “That’d be brilliant.”  Then he remembered that he already had plans.  His smile dropped.  “I can’t.  I forgot I have a . . . date, that night.”
“I could do that for you.” She reached out and placed her hand over his.  He slid his hand out from under hers and let her take over.
Draco and Harry looked at each other. Apparently, no one took them seriously when they said they were planning to hyphenate their names.
“Eight?  That’s hardly trying. I’ve read that some of the muggle best sellers had been rejected dozens of times before they were picked up.  You just need to find the right agency.”
Finally getting the box open, Harry removed some tissue to find a metal ring.  He held it up with a puzzled look on his face.
“Because, Miss Granger, it’s always good to know all sorts of potions.  You never know when this one might come in handy.  Plus, you should be able to recognize it should someone try to slip it to you.”  He winked.  “As you all know, this potion smells differently to everyone. So after you make yours correctly, I’d like you to go around the room and test out one another’s finished products.  Every potion should smell the same to you.  If it doesn’t, something is amiss with the potion.”  Slughorn smiled.  “I rather like this one.  I’m always curious as to what other people smell.”
“Shh,” Margherita held her finger to her lips.  “De baby is sleep,” she told them in her broken English and thick Italian accent.  Luckily, she understood and spoke English well enough to communicate in a land strange to her.
A swift swipe over Harry’s arse and his own cock, and Draco plunged in.  Harry cried out from the force.
“That’s all right,” Harry said. “Go ahead and tell her when you get back to the Ministry.  I won’t get a chance until tonight.  Frankly, I don’t think I’ll be able to hold it in around here.  But I wanted you and Mione to be the first to know.”
Since none of the Eighth Years wanted the responsibility, Ginny had been made Head Girl and she split off from the other Gryffindors to find her room.  For similar reasons, Michael Corner, from Ravenclaw, was named Head Boy, and the two shared a space that included a common room, two separate bed chambers and a very large shared bath.  Ginny was most excited to have a private room to which she could sneak Harry occasionally.
Draco’s eyes roamed hungrily over Harry’s body, lingering on the conspicuous bulge in his boxers. “If you don’t call yourself fit, I can’t imagine what you’d call me.”
“Clearly, I no longer shop there,” Draco said as he drew his hands over his outfit to make his point.
“They’re all still looking over here,” Ginny observed.  “Did you really shag Pansy Parkinson of all people?”
Harry and Draco kissed to commemorate their first New Year’s Eve together.  Other couples did so as well.  Theo, not being part of an official couple swept Pansy up and dipped her before planting a memorable kiss on her lips.  She was grateful not to be left out as she observed the other happy couples.  Theo then made his way to any other girls that didn’t have a partner and repeated the gesture.  Susan Bones didn’t particularly enjoy it, but she appreciated the thought.
As the last of the potions were finished, the very last being Blaise and Mandy’s, students began walking around the room to sniff the others.  Michael hurried quickly out of the room.
“I’ll give it ten more minutes, then I’ll call it a night.  You two have fun.”  Harry walked about the Hall once more, in case he simply missed Draco.  Several students beckoned him to join them, as they had been doing all evening, but he waved them off.
Harry blushed while Draco continued to admire the wand. “That doesn’t sound so bad. What is the core?”
Justin Finch-Fletchly stood at the entrance to Slytherin gathering up the nerve to knock.  He thought long hard about whether or not to bother trying to smooth things over with Millicent.  For the past month, he’d watched her sneering at him, then avoiding him, then finally going about her business--ignoring him.
“Oh, fuck it all,” Ron grumbled.  He bent down lower to Harry so no one else would hear.  “It smells like Hermione’s snatch.  And if I have to sniff one more fucking cauldron, I’m gonna cream my pants.”
After knocking on Draco’s door, Harry frowned and began to walk away.  He spotted Draco on another staircase coming up.
Harry carefully lay down next to Draco on the marble floor. That was half the problem. The floor was keeping him cold. Harry needed to put something between Draco and the marble.
Harry awoke with a start.  He’d been having a disturbing dream, which he often did since the war.  He slowly opened his eyes to find Draco’s face mere inches from his own.  It took a few moments for him to realize where he was and why.  Lying still so as not to wake Draco, he looked at him.  Really looked at him.  Harry had never had the opportunity to observe Draco so closely while he was so relaxed.  The crease in Draco’s forehead was gone, as well as the line between his brows.  He was peacefully dreaming, eyes hidden behind closed lids.  His lashes were surprisingly thick, not quite as light as the hair on his head, but unnoticeable from a distance.  Draco’s nose had changed over the years.  Less prominent, it suited his face better and was no longer what Harry would describe as pointy.  His lips . . . his lips were a pale rosebud pink, curvier than most and surrounded by very light stubble due to lack of a morning shave.  He really was quite handsome.  Not that Harry thought of such things.  His gaze lingered on Draco’s mouth, then traveled back up his face.  When it reached Draco’s eyes, they were staring back at Harry.  Grey and intense.  Harry froze, wondering how long Draco had been watching him watch Draco.  They stared silently for what seemed like hours but was only a matter of seconds.  Harry could have sworn he saw Draco’s chin tilt, almost imperceptibly when suddenly, a shower of sparks flew from their wands, distracting them.  Turning away, Harry looked at the mantle clock.  It read eight o’clock.
“We dozed off a bit while the babies were in their cots.  But once they were up for a feeding, we couldn’t put them down,” Harry said sheepishly.
“I’d recommend counseling as well,” the Healer said.  He chuckled, “But you won’t go.  The Aurors never go.”
“You’re not fat.  You’re curvy.”  As soon as he saw the look on her face, he knew he said the wrong thing.  But he said it with the best intentions.
Narcissa looked to Lucius.  “There was a name.  I suppose it’s the one I think of when I think of her.”
Harry swallowed and licked his lips nervously. In light of Draco’s earlier frankness, Harry simply answered, “Yes.”
“Aw, Harry, don’t be like that.”  Draco put his arm around him.  Harry’s shoulders began to shake a little.  Draco rolled his eyes, making sure Harry couldn’t see.  “Are you happy Weasley?  Now he’s cry–” Draco looked where Ron had previously been standing, but he was gone.  He narrowed his eyes at Harry, realizing that he was laughing, not crying.
The author of the Standard Book of Spells smiled coyly.  “Well, Horace, as a matter of fact I have been working on putting together a compendium of new spells.”
“So, you’re suggesting that Draco and I not have a personal life outside--or rather, inside, of Hogwarts?”
“I knew it was too good to be true,” Harry said to himself.  “So what am I not content with?” he asked the journal.
Harry hung his head.  He wasn’t sure why he was embarrassed.  Maybe it was because, at eighteen, he should have had this figured out already.  Or maybe it was because he basically came out for the first time to his Hogwarts nemesis.  Former nemesis.  Or possibly, it was the fact that he’d chickened out when the moment came.
Around eight o’clock, Ron, Harry and Hermione met up in the common room to walk to breakfast together.
Ron placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Tell Malfoy he’ll still have a manor to come home to. We’re not taking everything. And, Harry, don’t fuck this one up like you usually do.” Ron turned to walk down the hallway to look for Hermione, since Harry was busy for lunch.
“Hopefully, that won’t be necessary.  I’m going to talk to her as soon as she gets back.” Harry bit his lip.  “It would be nice to have someone on my side.”
Harry put his hand up to stop Draco from saying anymore.  “I know.  You didn’t let me finish.  I thought time apart would help us figure out if it’s real or not.  But after talking to Tracey, I don’t think it’s necessary.  I’m pretty sure that if it was just the game, we would have already lost it.”
“I wasn’t trying to ruin it, Hermione.  I was behind and it got messed up when I tried to put it together too quickly.”
Harry put a gentle hand on Draco’s arm.  He sat back down and made a show of putting a biscuit on his plate, though he didn’t eat it.
“No pink.  But for now, I guess I’ll go with the green.”  Draco slipped on the shirt and began to button it up.  “Is that what you’re wearing?”
“Fuck.  I didn’t mean to do that.”  Harry lifted his head to face Draco.  “I mean, I did.  But not like that.”
Draco stepped in behind him, purposely brushing against him.  “Great.  I’m going to have a permanent hard on all day just thinking about it.”
“Great.  See you then,” he said awkwardly.  He walked out of the classroom and into Ron, who had been watching.
The pair left the sofa and the Slytherin common room to head for the Potions room.  Draco lit a few of the lanterns with his wand.
“I know I’ve sent you into emotional chaos since . . . well, probably since this term began,” Harry laughed. “But I don’t ever want to make you cry again.”
“I mean, all the couples that got together, broke up afterward.  It was the game the whole time.  It was like a matchmaker.  But it only worked while the game was still going on.”
It was Harry’s turn to drop his jaw.  His neck was covered in hickeys.  Instinctively, his hand covered his neck. “Shit,” he swore. “I’m going to kill him.”
“Go ahead then, get stuck with some rich bint you don’t love or even like.  You’ll be led by the nose for the rest of your life, for money.  You’ll sacrifice your happiness.  For money.”
Laying a hand on Draco’s back, Harry whispered his name.  The hand traveled down to the bare skin on Draco’s baby soft arse.
“Yes,” she replied.  “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’m afraid your mother has had an accident.”
“Then let yourself,” Hermione smiled.  “Love is never wasted.  And it might be returned. But even if this doesn’t work out.  Even if he doesn’t love you back.” She muttered, “He’d be a fool,” under her breath.  “You’ve learned something about yourself.”
“You don’t even know if it’s his.  It’s more likely mine,” Dean reminded her.  “And even if it is his, he can’t give you the life you’d want.  What are you going to do, share parenting with him and Malfoy?  He’s gay, Ginny.  Is that the lifestyle you want your baby to be raised in?”
“Draco,” Harry finally broke the silence. “I need to know.” He paused, knowing that Draco’s answer could completely change the nature of their relationship one way or another. But he didn’t think they could go back to the pretense of obliviousness they once had. The innocence of cautious flirtation was now behind them. “Did you really mean what you said in the Manor? I need to know, one way or the other.”
Ordinarily, the pair would have cast a spell to soundproof their room.  But with the castle mostly empty, they didn’t bother.  On the contrary, Harry was turned on even more by the thought of being heard by any staff that may be around.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Harry cut him off.  “We’ll both have to compromise to make this work. Besides, I don’t see how I could be any happier than I am right now,” Harry grinned.  “Plus, I’ve decided to take your advice and write my own story.  Well, a version of it.  There are some things I’ll leave out.  So, what was it that you figured out?”
Suddenly awake, the small crowd rose to their feet and began offering congratulations.  Hermione glanced at Harry.  She knew the older child in his dreams was a boy.
It was then that Harry noticed the two items in Draco’s hands.  A book and the one-third full bottle of firewhiskey.
“Does it matter that I wasn’t sure if I meant it before?” Harry’s gaze silently pleaded with Draco. “I mean it now. I didn’t realize, until I’d lost you, how much you mean to me.” He waited for response. Some sort of sign that Draco understood.
Ron and Hermione remained glued to one another’s side, visiting with their former professors, as well as Charlie and Percy, who’d both been out of the country for the past year.
Draco hissed at Blaise.  He’d come a little closer to home than Draco preferred.  His biggest worry was that the changes in him were temporary.
“I’d like to be able to say no, but Ron knows I asked you to study and he’ll badger me until I give him at least some details.  But that’s all, honestly.”
They could love and care for a child the same as anyone else.  But they would never have a child that was equal parts Harry and Draco. Only one of them could be blood related to their child. Logically, Harry knew they could adopt and the child would be theirs regardless of blood ties.  However, seeing the miracle that was Rose Weasley was a bittersweet moment for him.  Another piece of his dream for a family faded.  And once again, Harry would have to readjust his expectations  for his future.
Harry’s hand shook as it left the parchment.  Would the diary leave his words as truth?  Is that truly what Harry wanted or did he want the family of his dream?  He loved Draco, but he was also beginning to fall for those adorable children.
Draco awoke with a wide yawn. He sighed it out contentedly and opened his eyes.  His husband was still fast asleep lying next to him.  Even in his unconscious, disheveled state, Harry was a thing of beauty.  His hair was covering part of his face, but Draco could still see the thick fringe of dark eyelashes.
As Harry and Draco continued to walk, Stephen slowed his pace and dropped back from Mandy and Boot. He stopped to wait for Harry and Draco to catch up to him.
They sat in silence while Harry waited patiently for Draco to begin. His palms were getting sweaty, so he rubbed his hands on his trousers. The wait was excruciating.
“Ha!  You, comforting someone.  Since when do you give a shit how anyone else feels?  You and Pansy, you both think you’ve changed or something.  I know deep down inside, you’re both still a couple of self-centered Slytherins to the core. As soon as we leave this place, you’ll go back to your old ways.”
“What?” McGonagall interrupted the conversation.  “I’m sorry, did you say that someone is failing Potions?”
Grumbling, Harry pushed food around his plate, stealing glances between the door and Draco’s vacant spot.
Padding back to his bed, Harry lay down and tried to will himself to dream about something more pleasant.  Fortunately, he didn’t dream about Draco duping him.  Unfortunately, it was because he didn’t sleep at all the rest of the night.
“I was just thinking, now I know why the Weasleys had so many children.  They probably went at it like jackrabbits.”
They chatted a while and ate, which Harry hadn’t done since breakfast.  When they finished the Yorkshire puddings, Draco gave Harry the bag with the chocolate roses inside.
“You know how a lot of couples that were paired stayed together?  Did you notice how many have recently broken up?”
The boys broke apart, Harper scrambling to get away from Draco.  Draco merely remained as he was, he had done nothing wrong.
“Oh, yes.  She made you look like a fool on the very first question.  I couldn’t bear to read any more. Now, not only will people be snickering at my supposed fetishes, but she’s reminded them that I still carry the Dark Mark.  How in the name of Merlin did that make things better for us?”
“No,” Draco grumbled.  “You should stay and have fun.  It’s my own fault I can’t go.  I’ll be fine.”
“I think you’ll find he’s not the same person that he was during the war.  Please, read this.”  McGonagall handed him the letter again.  This time he took it.
The first time he mentioned it, it was insulting.  Somehow, the second time he said it, she found it less so.
“Absolutely,” Harry said.  “You’ll not only apologize for this latest slander, but you’ll also apologize for those series of articles you wrote about Draco a few years back.”
The pair lay, foreheads together, panting into one another’s mouths. Eventually, Draco extricated himself and lay down next to Harry.
Boot walked back toward Ron, while the red head left his seat to meet him. “I’ll tell you what my problem is,” Boot began.  “First off, this so-called hero is nothing but a fraud.  Some of my good friends died because of him.  Because he was too chicken to give himself up to you know who.”
Harry smiled. “Simon got stopped more than I did. But no, he probably didn’t get jealous because he was too much of an arrogant prick.”
Harry found the largest container and emptied it to hold the water, plus a cup for Draco to drink from. Remembering that Draco was cold, he searched for a blanket of some sort. Most people didn’t store blankets in their kitchen and the Malfoys were no exception. He did find several small dish towels, but they were too small to provide much warmth. Harry took them anyway.
“I wish I was.  She’s lying about how far along she is.  She had no intention of telling me,” Harry explained.
“I’m going to do a spell first.  It’s to, um, get you ready for me.  I already tried it on myself, so I know it’s safe.”  Draco grabbed his wand and was about to say the incantation.  “It . . . tickles, a bit.”
Draco completed his potion, in fifth place, and cleaned up his station.  When he finished, he noticed that Harry was already gone.
When the waterworks started, Harper clutched onto Draco, who sat stiff and uncomfortable. Draco wanted nothing more than to get out of there, but he tried to put himself in Harper’s shoes.  Blaise, like Draco, was sometimes aloof and appeared unfeeling.  Not necessarily a good match for someone like Harper, who wore his heart on his sleeve.  But obviously, there had been something there, or the two of them wouldn’t have lasted as long as they did.
“What are you doing? You’re supposed to warm me up, not make me colder,” Draco protested, though he was in no shape to fight Harry’s efforts. And so his jumper was removed. Harry began to unbutton Draco’s shirt.
After their goodbyes, Harry took Draco’s hand and led him into the sitting room.  Arthur was in his favorite armchair, with his older sons on the sofa.  George and Ron sat on the floor near the coffee table, and Harry joined them. Draco took a seat in a comfy chair off in the corner.
Bert had joined them, to serve as a witness, as requested by Harry.  A witch who called herself Duchess also joined them to scribe.
Harry’s clenched his jaw.  “You’ve known about this since Christmas break?  And you’re just telling me now.  You were planning to keep me under the spell?  That’s why you had such a strange look on your face when I said I wanted to lock you away.”
“You have no idea,” Lucius said softly, just when Draco was beginning to think his father had nothing to say. “I had just lost a child.  I was in danger of losing my wife. I was helpless.”
Greyback was a man with his back against the wall, fighting for his very life. Harry would have preferred to take him alive, to stand trial.  But he would kill him if he had to.  Harry’s own conscience and concern for Malfoy’s safety were hindrances the werewolf didn’t share.  Greyback was out for blood from the start and it only incensed him more that Draco, a Death Eater himself, was cooperating with the Dark Lord’s murderer.
Casper shrugged.  “Everyone assumed she had been asked weeks ago, when the dance was first announced.  But no one I asked said they were going with her.  So, I figured it was worth a shot.”
“Perfectly,” Draco said.  “It’s only a matter of time before he falls for me. I can see that he wants to.  He just needs to let go.”
The beginning of another new year at Hogwarts. In a little more than a week, students would arrive, eager to learn new spells, charms and potions.  Well, most of them.  Harry knew all too well that not all students were cut out for the discipline of a school like Hogwarts.  He fondly remembered the Weasley twins in that regard.  It was a little easier to recall their mischievous grins these days than it had been in the past.  Six years of healing went a long way.  Even Molly was able to speak about Fred without breaking down.
Harry held up the bag with food he had taken from Draco at some point during their trip back.  “Aren’t you hungry?”
“Yeah, we’re all going to the Burrow.  Me and Hermione, Ginny, and all my brothers, and Harry.  It’ll be crowded, but why don’t you come too?”
“Gross,” Draco replied.  “But I’m certain the game is finished.  Eew, they must have gotten together on their own.”
“The marks are still very faint.”  She pulled his scarf a bit tighter around his neck.  “There.  Now they won’t show at all.”
“As you wish,” he grinned. By now, his previously unimpressive appendage was at full capacity.  Perhaps it wasn’t the largest one in the locker room, but he knew how to use it.
He went to the roll top desk and took out a neatly wrapped thin box. As he handed it to Draco, he said, “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
Daphne gave him a fake pout.  “Aw, poor thing.  Let me take care of that for you.”  She unzipped his trousers and slid her hand inside.  He moaned.
“It will be a pleasure,” Draco replied, pulling Harry flush against him.  “I may show you a few different moves, however.”
“To be completely honest, I wasn’t entirely certain it would work. When I’ve used it before, we stayed in one place,” Harry confessed.
Pansy and Blaise traveled to Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw to give the same address to those students.  All in all, interest was mixed and many of the students were skeptical of the Slytherins.  For the following two days, it was all the older students at Hogwarts talked about.  By the time Friday rolled around, the anticipation was a distraction in all their classes.  Girls giggled, discussing which boy’s wand they were hoping to choose. And whose they definitely did not want.  Of course, most of the girls were hoping for a chance at Harry, now that he and Ginny had broken up.  Low on the list, were Justin Finch-Fletchley and Michael Corner.  But lowest were Blaise and Harper, who many suspected were homosexual. Few of the girls seemed to relish the idea of sharing their man with other men.
“Oh, all right.  It was right after the battle was over.  But we were so filled with emotions, of every sort.  Relief, but mainly grief.  We needed to feel something positive.  It probably wasn’t the best timing,” she conceded.
“It’s a shame you’re my sworn enemy,” he joked.  “I’d ask you to dance.”  Hiding behind a mask gave him new found confidence.
“Yes.  O.W.L.s aren’t for another four months.  And yet these students are already stressing over them.  Not that any of them need to.  So far, they’ve all got Outstandings for the year.  Was Granger, er, Hermione this bad?”
“Maybe we knew each other too well before we got together.  I’d had a crush on him for so long and he was practically part of my family.  He probably thought of me more like his little sister.”
Harry didn’t know why he didn’t think of it before.  It was how he and Draco first got to know more about one another.  There wouldn’t be any binding spell here tonight, but the conversation would get moving.
Nodding, Harry continued to follow Hermione to the bar. Draco side-stepped Harry and caught up to Hermione, speaking close into her ear.
“Actually this morning.  Just past midnight,” Harry told her. “So they share a birthday with Draco.”
In a rare moment of faith, Draco answered, “I do.”  He smiled and kissed Harry.  He performed a quick clean up spell and covered them both with a blanket.
Blaise continued. “Look, I’m not one to judge.  And I’m certainly no Potter groupie.  But I haven’t seen you this content in . . .
Draco hated to put it down, but it was supper time and he was hungry.  Hungry for the first time in days, it seemed.
“It’s gold and platinum,” the blonde explained.  “Of course I’d give you a discount, but I don’t suppose either of you are interested.”
“I just let you jerk me off right outside the library.  So, obviously no, I’m not always a goody-goody.”
Though the circumstances were slightly off, Blaise still had the presence of mind to stick to the plan. “I’ll take Weasley.  I mean, Ginny.”
“It was lovely.  We ate by candlelight and talked.  About everything.  We got a lot of things out in the open.  I think we’re back on track.”
“No, Ron, it can happen that way.  It just usually doesn’t.  The Healer we saw told us.  Anyway, that isn’t the part that’s exciting.  It drove out the dark magic in Draco’s Mark and the tattoo disappeared.”
Harry bit his lip.  But the sincere expression on Draco’s face was enough to convince Harry to trust him. Without further explanation from Draco, Harry agreed.  “All right.”
But this day, Draco brought a book about the most amazing Quidditch matches in history, according to the title.  It described in vivid detail the longest, closest or even bloodiest matches.  He defied Harry to doze during that.
“I was eleven.  What did you think was going to happen?  I told you it wasn’t much of a story.”  He wavered.  “But the way I felt watching him walk away . . .  it made me realize that the girl was right.  I was definitely a pouf.”
Ron sat up and pricked his ears.  “Ooh, your night already sounds worse than mine.  What did he keep from you?”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t rather be at the Ministry?” Harry asked Draco as they settled on the sofa together.
“That was lovely,” Harry said.  “It’s not often I get to see you flustered.  And look, we’re nearly there.”
Ready to defend Harry, Draco could feel the anger rising.  He had to remind himself not to say anything foolish.  “Potter is adequate at potion making.”  He grinned, “And my brilliance more than makes up for it.  But good luck anyway.”
“I enjoy teaching.  For now. But I became a Potions Master in order to go into business for myself. I thought you knew that.”
Now that he was committed to telling a gay romance, Harry was excited.  He’d never written anything particularly naughty, but he found himself visualizing the things the boys would do.  He’d read some books with graphic sexual details, and though they had been heterosexual in nature, he found them arousing.  He wondered if writing them would have the same affect.
“It’s a good thing,” Harry choked out. Without thinking, Harry hugged the man in front of him.  He was more relieved to see him than he had words for.
“I need to finish. I might not get the chance later.” Draco continued with his confession. “You’re predictable, Potter. Did you know that? I knew when you’d be at the cafes in Diagon Alley and when you’d lunch in muggle London. I knew which restaurants you favored. I tried not to show up too often. You never found it odd that we’d run into one another so often?”
“What’s the big deal?  I don’t think there’s any doubt as to who we are. Not really any other ginger boys.  And who else would I be with?”  He nuzzled her neck, then lowered his mouth to her décolletage. “Come on, let’s go.”
“I won’t tell anyone, Harry.  I’ll even cover for you with Ron.  You’re meeting someone, aren’t you?”
She couldn’t help grin in return, not having a clue why.  Draco pushed the left sleeve of his jumper up to the elbow. Narcissa stared for a moment, the bareness of his arm not quite registering at first.
Draco stiffened, but answered Harry.  “You’re right Potter.  My handwriting is much better than yours,” he smirked.  “But then you’ve got to give me a hand elsewhere.”
Harry glanced at his friends, who gave sheepish grins.  Ron and Hermione didn’t see any of the signs Harry showed.  Even though he consciously tried not to, he couldn’t always help himself from appreciating a male form.  And more than a few times he caught himself saying something a straight man probably wouldn’t say.
They made their entrance in the middle of a particularly raucous musical number and went largely unnoticed. Sybill walked by and smiled absently on her way to the refreshment table, where McGonagall was keeping watch.
Cummins gazed into the expectant faces of the four Hogwarts students. Deciding not to add to their anxiety any further, he answered Ron’s question curtly.
They showered together, though only washing themselves. Neither one trusted himself with touching the other’s body.  Breakfast would be over before they got to the Great Hall if they had another shag.
Blaise and Draco walked into Potions that day arguing.  They had been nitpicking one another all week, putting on a fair show for everyone.  The irony was that this day’s argument had been real, and they hadn’t planned to have their public falling out until the next day.  It seemed that Draco was growing weary of being locked out of his own room by Blaise and Harper.  Especially without notice.  The boys had been arguing about it since breakfast.
Draco silently glanced anywhere in the room to avoid eye contact, his mouth opened to speak, but no words came out.
Harry laughed along with him.  “I really didn’t need that image in my mind. But I’m going to have to recommend the binding ceremony to Ron and Mione.”
Harry took his time, making sure Draco was comfortable before proceeding further.  When at last he was fully enveloped, he leaned over and kissed Draco.
“Well, it’s not just any party.” Pansy glanced around and leaned farther over the table toward Harry, her cleavage at his eye level. He couldn’t not look.  “I can’t tell you here,” she whispered. “I’ll come to your common room tonight. Say, half-eight? Gather up the seventh and eighth years.”
“Keep telling yourself that.  Look, our families aren’t that different.  Well, other than the fact that you
“I’ve been upstairs,” she replied.  “Harry, there’s something I need to talk to you about after supper.  Privately.”
They continued to walk in silence among the chatter of the crowd, and music playing over the loudspeaker.
He was fairly certain she was ready for him, but to be sure, he ran a finger through her slit.  It was juicy and ripe.  He wasted no time entering her fully.  Unlike Ginny, with whom he’d only had intercourse three times, Pansy was loose and experienced.  Not needing to be especially gentle with her, Harry thrust himself in her over and over.
“Strawberries, lavender and cedar,” he answered. Glancing quickly at Hermione, Draco added, “We’d better make the rounds like everyone else.”
you.”  He couldn’t take it anymore and began rubbing himself.  “Don’t look if you don’t like it.  But I’m so fucking horny, I have to.”
The moans grew into fevered pants, signaling the nearing of his climax.  Millicent couldn’t help turning in her seat to watch. Justin had his head thrown back and his eyes closed.
“He’s probably an old queen himself,” Draco snickered.  Harry laughed as well, thinking Draco could very well be correct.
The situation with Casper Montague being managed, Draco felt the stress ease up.  Perhaps there would be no more private potion making. Ron was investigating Narcissa’s accident, and there was little Draco could do to help there.  He was free to concentrate on his relationship with Harry more diligently.
“Yeah, sure, mate. Get some rest. I’ll see you in the morning,” Ron stood and clapped him on the back. “Oh, wait. I’ve got something for you.” He walked to the cupboard and brought out Harry’s wand to hand to him.
Harry wasn’t watching where he was going.  His mind was still on Friday night.  It had been five days and he still couldn’t remember what happened.  He hadn’t noticed that the person in front of him had stopped to let another student pass.  Harry walked straight into Malfoy, pinning him against the wall.
“Okay, so you’re a shirt lifter.  That I can handle,” Ron said matter-of-factly.  He glanced over at Malfoy.  “But him?  There have to be a thousand blokes you could choose over him.”
Draco stood, stunned for several minutes before sinking down to sit on the sofa.  He cradled his head in his hands.
“Which one of you would like to go first?” She saw the glint in Draco’s eyes.  “Perhaps you?”  She held her hand out to him.
As he stepped into his room, he took out one of the books Hermione had given him to read over the summer.  He knew she would ask about it, and he wanted to be able to say that he had at least started it.
“Because,” Hermione glanced up at the clock.  “In,” she paused to look at the clock, “twelve minutes, your charms will disappear.  Everything will go back to normal.  Your hair, your glasses, Draco’s hair.”  She was proud that she remembered to call him by his given name for a change. “Everyone who is here will be revealed.”
While Harry made it through another day of stares, giggles and sneers, Draco did Potions research in his room.  He kept expecting McGonagall to come in to tell him he’s been sacked.  Minke continued to bring him meals in his room throughout the day as he was still too embarrassed to face the rest of the staff.
“Pansy told me some old witch’s tale about powerful wizards giving off magic during sex.  Well, I thought it was an old witch’s tale.”  He finally tore his gaze from his arm and settled it on Harry. “I think you made the Mark go away.”
“Hm,” Draco mused. “When I encouraged you to write, I thought it would just be a pleasurable diversion, not a way to make a living.”
He got up and walked to the bath.  Harry sighed as he watched him, thankful to get another chance.  One thing he would definitely change, would be his entire relationship with Knox.  As Harry lay listening to the shower running, he wondered what was going to happen when Knox and Draco saw one another face to face.  He wouldn’t blame Draco for any retaliation he might have planned, but he hoped his lover would take the high road.
Their lips smashed together in a frenzy of emotion.  Draco had been on such a roller coaster for the previous few days, he went limp in Harry’s arms before long.
“It’s all right, Harry,” Ron offered.  “I would have had Mione with me over the break, ‘cept Mum wasn’t having any of that.  Not after Ginny.”
Harry frowned.  “You’re saying, it’s like he talked me out of it. Or, more like, scared it out of me?”
Rolling his eyes, Draco took Harry’s arm and pulled him into the loo.  He locked the door behind them.
“Relax,” he said to himself, realizing that he was holding the book in a death grip.  He cleared his throat again.
“Except that you do know better.  If anything, I was envious of the child. My parents didn’t read to me. I read that very book to myself as soon as I learned how. My parents were too busy being secret Death Eaters and hosting high society in our home. I wouldn’t know the first thing about being father.  I had no good role model.”
“I will.  I do.  I won’t waste this chance I’ve been given.”  He embraced his usually rather stoic mother, who, in return, hugged him fiercely.  He now better understood her dispassionate nature as likely self-preservation.  In the wake of his own joy, his heart ached for her.
Draco walked back into the room. “My parents will be on their way a little later.  No doubt Mother wants to pick out the best layette for them.  And I’ve flooed Headmistress McGonagall.”  He turned to Ron. “If you wouldn’t mind passing the news on to the rest of your family.”
As they approached Harry’s door, Ron didn’t hesitate to simply turn the handle and stroll in.  He took only a few steps in, when he stopped short, causing Hermione to bump into him.
Draco quickly scanned his memory for incidents of swearing in front of the Headmistress.  He knew he swore under his breath around her, at the very least.
“We just picked those because they’re flower names.  Because of Lily.  Even our House Elf has a flower name for crying out loud.”  He looked down at his daughter.  “She deserves something special.  Perhaps a family name, like the other two,” Draco suggested.
Draco, in turn, gave Harry the once over.  His hair was disheveled a bit, but it normally looked that way.  He shrugged.  “Your hair is a little messy.”
Finch-Fletchley stood blinking in disbelief himself.  How could this girl, this lovely girl he’d been talking to and flirting with all night be Millicent Bulstrode?
“So, you’re really a little bit in love with me?” Draco asked, remembering Harry’s words in the Manor.
“I didn’t pay much attention, but now that you mention it, I guess I haven’t seen as many couples holding hands as there used to be.”
“That’s very commendable, Harry,” Hermione smiled.  “I hope you’ll be happy doing that.  I, myself, am slated to begin work in the Ministry in August.  I’ll be working in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department to start.”
“No, you should stay.  You’re exhausted,” Harry said, stroking his hair.  He reached over to the bedside table for his wand.  After a quick clean up spell, he covered them both with the blanket and settled back into position.  By the time Harry’s arm draped back over Draco, the blond was lightly snoring despite the relatively early hour.
That time, he distinctly heard him say ‘he’, when referring to his future love.  Suddenly, the improbable seemed possible.  If only he could find a way into the Gryffindor’s lonely heart.
Harry laughed.  “It’s not that I’m so confident, so much as I don’t give a fuck what people think of me anymore.”
“No, she isn’t. Babies come when they come.  Sometimes they’re early.  This baby isn’t mine.  Maybe Ginny and Dean didn’t wait to have sex as long as they said,” Harry suggested.
“Because I love you,” Harry said.  “And you love me.  Shagging is so much better when you’re in love.”
“That’s not the same.  Heterosexuality is normal.”  Rita glanced at Duchess.  “Scratch that.  Shit.”
“Could we please stop at the library on the way down to Harry’s chambers?”  Hermione begged.  “We’re still a little early.”
Nodding, Harry agreed.  “What about you?  Do you think you’re single, or will Hermione take you back?”
“I’m not running off,” Harry insisted.  “We’re just tired.  And people are still staring.  You two should enjoy your meal in peace.”
“I was wondering,” Draco began.  “I’d like a favor.  Actually, it shouldn’t be a favor.”  He was tripping over his words uncharacteristically.  He cleared his throat again.  “I’d like my wand back, please.”
“Yeah, I get it, Ron,” Harry said sternly.  “You don’t have to keep harping on it.  It would be disgusting if I were bent and had a thing for Malfoy.  Don’t worry, not gonna happen.”
“Do you like it?” Parvati asked, spinning around and running her hands through her now, much shorter hair.
Before going back to his chambers, Knox decided to take a quick trip to the kitchens for a snack.  As he walked down the corridor in the dungeons, he heard hushed voices. Creeping nearer to the Potions room, he realized the sounds were coming from the classroom.  Stealthily peeking in, he spotted Draco with his arms around Casper Montague.  The boy was clutching at the Potion professor’s robes.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, then burst out laughing.  They quickly gathered their things and left the library together.
Casper shook his head, which was buried in Draco’s chest.  “Everyone will see that I’ve been crying,” he said, his voice muffled.
“Oh,” Hermione said. “Actually, Ron is my partner.” She would probably never admit it to Ron and Harry, but she was flattered that Draco sought her out specifically.
“Come on Granger,” Daphne smiled.  “I’ve been dying to get at that hair for years.  We’re going to fix you up.”
“It’s lovely,” Harry said as he opened it.  “It’s exactly what I could picture Hermione wearing.  Ron, brilliant choice.”
Draco frowned as they walked from the nursery window.  He was certain that was their baby.  He looked exactly how Draco had pictured, with Harry’s hair.  And then, they would have a blonde, a brunet and a red head.
Knox held out a list to Harry.  “I have a list of students.  Well, it’s only two really.  But I don’t know what to do with them.  It doesn’t say.”
Harry glanced around the room.  Three generations of wizards–pure-bloods, half-bloods, and muggle born, all peacefully celebrating together in Malfoy Manor.  Years ago, he never thought he’d see the likes of Narcissa Malfoy raising a glass with him, much less with Molly and Arthur Weasley. Harry caught Draco’s eye, and the pair shared an unspoken moment of tenderness.
Harry ended up taking the journal.  He decided that he would not have been nearly as mortified if he read it on his own.  Intending to leave as quickly as possible, Harry was once again caught off guard by Draco.
Draco stopped in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady. “The thing with Pansy seems a lifetime ago.  We were kids.”
“That’s only one aspect. A lot of diagnosis requires excellent spell skills.  And frankly, we could use someone as familiar with the Dark Arts as you.  Most of them want to be Aurors.  Healing injuries caused by Dark Magic can be tricky.”
Sensing Draco behind him, Harry cut the conversation short.  Another waitress was handing Draco their boxes of food.
“Yes, we’ve been expecting you,” the witch told him.  “If you’ll follow me . . .” She began her usual routine by rote.
Draco stood where he was for a few minutes, convinced that Harry would be back to continue their discussion.  Hopefully, they’d be able to speak more calmly about the situation.
Poppy appeared with a small pop, bowing low.  “Missus, supper is ready in the dining room.”  The tiny elf looked up at Harry with wonder.  “Forgive Poppy for asking, but will Mr. Harry Potter allow Poppy to call him Master?”
Looking across the table, Draco noticed a melancholy smile on his mother’s face.  He didn’t need to strain himself figuring out why. As if there weren’t enough Weasleys, two new family members would be added before the end of the year. The paltry Malfoy family may or may not grow, and may even end with Draco. Not only that, there were precious few Blacks as well.  The other side of his ancestry was down to himself and Teddy Lupin.
Harry furrowed his brow.  “The healer said it isn’t mine, Ginny.  I trust him.”  Changing the uncomfortable subject, Harry asked Ginny, “Where do you and Dean plan to live when you leave here?”
Pansy rolled her eyes.  “Yeah, walk in on us talking,” she chuckled.  “Although that would be shocking, to find you actually talking to a girl.”
He opened the journal he had brought out with him.  The last few entries were written while back at Hogwarts, concerning N.E.W.T.s and the impending birth of Ginny and Dean’s baby.  Most of the entries centered around difficulties or worries.  He found that he usually forgot to write when his life was going well.  But he decided he wanted to chronicle the happy times as well as stressful.
“Ooh, that’s pretty juicy, Dra,” Pansy grinned.  “I think I’m going to like this game.  But what makes you think everyone will answer honestly?  She probably won’t–”
“I’ve been dying to run my fingers through your hair since you first walked out of the loo,” Harry said, doing just that.
“Harry, you don’t need to explain,” Hermione said.  “I think Ron and I can figure out what’s going on.”
And it was settled.  At least it appeared that way.  Ginny couldn’t help but be a little hurt that Harry wanted to go.  It was a thinly veiled excuse to shag someone otherwise unattainable.  Or perhaps a push in the right direction for the painfully shy.  Ginny wasn’t ashamed to admit to herself that she was going to relieve her own sexual frustration.  Of course, she told her brother, it was merely curiosity -- she’d never been inside Slytherin House.
Beside him, Harry grinned.  After saying their hellos to him, Bill and Fleur had received Draco without hesitation.  When the Weasleys accepted someone into their lives, they did it whole-heartedly.
“And that was worth risking spending the rest of your life playing cards with this lot?” Draco asked.
When he reached his room, Harry got out his favorite quill and a book of parchment.  He’d begun writing for pleasure a few years back when someone suggested he write his memoirs.  Whenever he’d sit down to it, his mind wandered to what ifs and ways he would have liked his life to go.  Giving up on his autobiography, Harry took to writing stories about a fictional teenage boy and his adventures.  The stories were usually character and relationship driven, as the boy’s parents were alive, as well as extended family.  Harry often fantasized that it was his own life that he was writing about, with much happier scenarios.
“It’s not a bad idea, Ron,” Hermione chimed in.  “If things work out between them, we’ll all be spending more time together.”
“Oh, I know.  Why don’t you play chess?” Harry suggested.  “You know I’m not a challenge for you.  He’s very good.”
someone asks.  That would be the question on everyone’s lips.  He didn’t know if he should admit to the relationship or act as though Draco simply got caught up in the moment.  He needed desperately to talk to the Slytherin before someone cornered him.  Unfortunately for Harry, having to clean up by himself kept him in the classroom much longer than usual.  But he was nearly finished.
She pulled a book from behind her back and handed it to him.  They stared at one another, each trying to force the other into talking first.  Draco could see that she was too stubborn to ask him to read to her.  But he wasn’t about to volunteer.  He could be equally stubborn.
“You shouldn’t talk. The coughing fits are taking a lot out of you. You need to save your strength.”
“Yes,” the girl said.  “Occasionally we’ll get muggle items in here. I’ve seen one of those that you’re talking about.  But this one is magical, of course.  The story goes that when he gave the pin as a gift, it wouldn’t open.  It meant that his love wasn’t truly returned.”
He joined his fellow Gryffindors as they snuck down into the dungeons and gave a special password for use only as entrance to the party.  It looked to be the same crowd as before, minus Ron and Hermione.  Lavender slipped next to Harry and asked where Ron was.
“Uh, well, I don’t know. I’ve been busy.”  Harry wasn’t about to tell them about his latest foray into the world of the muggle bar scene.  In reality, it had only been about a month since he had a date.  Well, not a date exactly.  More like an encounter.  But that was all Harry ever had.  It had been good enough for him. Up until Draco Malfoy showed up at Hogwarts, Harry didn’t think he wanted any kind of commitment.
“I suppose,” she replied.  “I’d rather not get called weasel or she-weasel anymore.  Are you sure we can’t still call Malfoy ferret, though?” she snickered.
“It was excruciating to watch you and not be able to touch you,” Draco breathed across Harry’s throat.
“Evanesco,” he said without emotion. He watched the lovely things Harry set out disappear, leaving the dank, dark Potions room as it was originally.  The metaphor was not lost on Draco.
The waitress came to check on them and Harry ordered more liquor.  He thought he may screw up enough courage to suggest to Draco that there could be a real friendship between them.  Perhaps even something more.
She opened her mouth but hesitated to speak.  Draco folded his hands in his lap while Harry looked uncomfortably between the pair.
Pansy grasped his chin and made him look at her. She then removed his glasses and tossed them on a desk.
She took a few steps down the bleacher stairs. "Harry, you can't mean that. It's always been you and I, it was destined to be!"
After three more days had passed in either silence or the occasional cutting comment, Draco had had it. He was angry, frustrated and he was determined to find wherever Harry was going, brace him there and force him talk to him. From the way he was dressing – a bit sluttier and more come hither-ish every night - Draco figured he had to be going out clubbing. Fine then; he would just go and search his boyfriend out and put a bloody end to all this bullshit. It was a plan.
Draco reached out for his arm as Harry left the kitchen, catching it. "Harry, what can I do? What can I say to make this better?"
Finally, as the room grew overwhelmingly crowded, Draco rose and grabbed the bottle of vodka in front of him, making his way through the crowd and out the door, down the hall and out a little-used back door.
Harry took a couple of steps back until the back of his knees hit the sofa and he sat down hard. He stared at Draco, who looked back at him with all the calm he could muster.
Draco never begged; he shouted, he screamed, he slammed things down and threw things, but he never begged or pleaded. And somewhere in the back of Harry's mind, he knew this was costing Draco everything to say.
He knew that Dumbledore had provided them with a new tent out of his own pocket, and that it was quite a luxurious one; he'd probably never know, since Draco seemed determined to avoid him and he doubted highly that tea and scones were in
Draco was looking down at his hands. "I do know that, yes." He lifted his eyes then, to meet Harry's. "But it doesn't mean I can help it."
Draco didn't say anything, just thought to himself that this conversation would amuse Potter to no end.
Well. This was an unexpected twist. Harry had never made love to a boy, and while he couldn't rule the possibility out, he wasn't sure that a girl who looked that hot but was a boy was fair play. He felt duped. Maybe that was what had felt wrong last night – maybe it was a sense that all was not what it seemed.
"I guess so; I don't really have much choice in the matter, do I? If I want him back – and I do, more than anything – I have to play by his rules, even though I have no bloody idea what those rules are."
Grumbling ensued but the steps shuffled away. Harry lifted his head from Draco's shoulder and turned his face to brush his lips over Draco's cheek. "Let's go home."
Harry took his dinner at a small café, and after a dessert that was both sinfully chocolate, and handily packed with pot, he returned to the Enge Kirkesteed, still carrying his camera around his neck and a small supply of "special" brownies. He walked with more purpose this time, looking for a certain window, but when he found it – or the one he was sure had been hers – it was empty, the light turned off. Harry stood in front of the window, feeling very stupid all of a sudden – and truth be told, more than a little forlorn.
The first notes of "Mirror Image" sounded, and the still figure came alive, prowling the stage, giving each lucky person who caught his eye a special smile, one only for them.
“I hope not; I don’t know.”  Draco felt a cold kiss on his cheek – then Harry was gone and he was alone in the shadows of the dead.
Harry stood – a bit unsteadily, but he stood – and held out his hand to Draco, who rose and grabbed the jacket, following Potter into the bedroom, which was just as bad as he'd feared.
Harry stopped him long enough to walk them two steps back, so the wall would take his weight – his knees were shaking with strain of standing straight – and to be honest, it was arousing as hell to see him, Darcy, on his knees, moving with him. Propped up, Harry closed his eyes again, stroking Darcy's hair, his other hand pressed against the wall behind him. He was taking an unusually long time to come, he thought, but then again, he'd been a bit rough on himself the night before, so perhaps that was to be expected.
"Lumos," he murmured, and a thin ray of light spun from the tip of his wand and illuminated the area around him. He slowly walked in a circle around the perimeter of where the tent had been, stepping lightly in his battered trainers. On his second turn 'round, he saw something and knelt down. A footprint, clearly defined from where the shoe had sunk into the muddy ground.
Harry turned scarlet and she looked surprised. "My dear, I thought everyone knew; first those unfortunate centerfold cleaning charms, and then, of course, Ginevra has been in quite a state about it all. She's been here several times asking for readings." She surveyed her glasses. "Good, all dry. I do love Super Glue. Muggles do come up with the cleverest items!"
Several games - and several ales - later, they were both royally pissed and had to occasionally prop themselves up on the other in order to shoot. "Thishh," said Harry finally, "Ish dangerous. Gonna put an eye out here."
While Potter was busy sipping away and studiously not making eye contact, Draco took note of his surroundings. The décor consisted of papers and magazines, take away containers, several 'dead soldiers' and at least three overflowing ashtrays – and that was just in the living room. He didn't dare consider what the loo or bedroom might look like. Potter was a lush, apparently, and it didn't look like anything had been dusted or vacuumed in eons, and nothing looked particularly cared for or about. The air was saved from being unbearable only by the fact that every window seemed to be open, or else Draco was sure a fog would settle over the room as well.
A ruckus broke out and Harry looked around as voices rose and people started to gesture (rudely and otherwise) and wave their various limbs about. Next to him, Ginny was grinning around a large mouthful of food. She chewed and swallowed. "Corndog, Harry?" she offered, but he demurred. He knew better than to come between Ginny and her junk food, no matter how nicely she offered.
"I have no idea, really; either wonderfully right or very, very wrong." He got up and started to pour himself a shot of vodka, then put the bottle down again; liquid courage wasn't going to help here…only old-fashioned courage. God help him, he was channeling bloody Godric Gryffindor here.
The afternoon stretched long as they lay tangled in each other, and there were few words spoken, because there were so few words to say.
Pansy ignored him. "Harry has started going out without Draco, which upsets our boy here. He wants to find him. But Harry will no doubt either ignore him or leave if he should attempt to, mmm, connect with him. So, we thought that if Draco could look much, much different, then maybe he could chat Harry up and things might progress, you see?”
Pansy looked at Blaise and raised her eyebrows; Blaise shrugged. "Have you tried places like The Factory? Down Under? Goo Lagoon?"
He'd ordered a t-shirt featuring Milo in all his pouty-lipped goodness and slept with it under his pillow. He knew all the words to all the songs, even the foreign translations. And he'd listened to hours of interviews, memorizing the sound of Milo's speaking voice. It sounded like southwest England to him, Wiltshire, maybe, the accent slightly less clipped than his own.
That last wouldn't be so bad, really - the refreshment tables at such rallies were usually filled with some pretty good stuff, like lemon bars, mushroom tartlets, the odd chocolate chip cauldron cake or gingerbread.
He'd had three drinks since noon, and it was now almost half nine – for him, that was tantamount to being stone cold sober, and he found himself casting yearning glances towards the familiar bottle with its amber forgetfulness. It seemed to mock him from its perch on the table. But he was determined to hang tough - at least till after the show.
Harry rubbed his forehead. "That's very kind of you, but I must have the wrong window. I'm looking for a beautiful girl." He paused, then added hastily. "No offense."
"Then you better come up and give me a reason to stay awake." Draco smiled over his shoulder as he went up the stairs, wiggling his butt for good measure.
Harry's eyes were fixed on him, and Draco was proud of himself for not looking away or down or fidgeting.
He spent the greater part of the day exploring other parts of the city, and taking pictures, which he loved doing, and was actually very good at. He preferred Muggle cameras, liked capturing things at a certain moment in time, freezing it. He took photos of buildings, of landmarks, and most often, of people. People were endlessly fascinating in the range of expressions they showed, and for whatever reason, Harry seemed to be able to capture ones that were perhaps best hidden; Harry didn't mind waiting and waiting till the perfect moment presented itself. It made for some memorable images.
"Oh. Oh, well, then. I can show you to your tent if you want." Harry wasn't discouraged for more than a moment or two. He had time, and the most famous seductions in history took time, right?
"Will you refuse me tonight again?" The head was tilted, and again, the pink tongue worried the ring, and the chemise shifted – it was purple, tonight, a pale shade of lavender and it turned light eyes dark. Black rimmed with black.
future. He was surprised, then, when there was a light tap on his shoulder as he sat on one of the drums and watched the clowns.
After bidding the other family members good night, it was to his room, and the latest centerfold that Harry retired to. He pulled it out carefully, smoothing invisible wrinkles out, casting yet another protective charm on it – he'd heard of this Muggle process called "laminating" and decided to look into it, since the charms were apparently nothing compared to his, erm, outpourings.
Adams looked up in exasperation. "The most rigorous work you've done lately is lip-ups against your coffee cup after Ginny told you your kisses had gotten limp and mushy."
"I don't know, Draco love, but if you've looked everywhere else?" Pansy shrugged. She was glad that she was so marvelously adept at keeping a straight face, because honestly, the thought of Potter, all dressed up and looking even hotter than usual, in a gay bar? Well, it made her feel all sorts of squirmy and damp in places her husband couldn’t even buy his way into anymore. She casually smoothed a perfect eyebrow as Draco lit his umpteenth cigarette of the afternoon.
"The Malfoys." Harry took a bite of brownie, the breakfast of champions. "Lucius and Narcissa – they both went to Azkaban, right?"
He shrugged. "Whatever – I would have given you a deal, but since you're not interested, that will be two hundred forty Euros; you were ten minutes into the second hour, and I bill like a doctor. I bet I do more good and solve more problems than they do, anyway." He held out his hand, waiting.
"Mine too; I make my own treats, however, so I can be sure of quality ingredients, baking being much more fun than plain old cooking."
Harry slid out of Draco and Draco almost sagged from the loss of Harry's legs holding him up; he clutched the sink for a moment before he could stand on his own, reaching down with one shaky hand to pull his trousers up. Harry had made swift work of his, and was washing his hands; he caught Draco's eye in the mirror and smirked.
Harry personally had re-termed it the "Harry, you piss me off and I don't see a future with us, but since Mum does, let's call this a break and I'll go fuck Dean Thomas, okay?" And the hell of it was, he didn't really care.
Darcy smiled at him, and slid his hand down Harry's front, to his belt buckle, undoing it expertly with one hand, the other hand still stroking his hair.
"So, there was this new guy there; I mean, I'd never seen him before, you know, he could have been a regular, but I don't think so. Anyway, beautiful? Oh my God. He was amazing, honestly. Not that tall, which is normally kind of a turnoff for me, but he more than made up for it with how he was built. Compact, you know?" Paul set the bowl of color down and pulled off the gloves, "There, let it set a bit and we'll see how it takes. So anyway, this guy was just - his eyes, the greenest eyes I have ever seen anywhere, and this full lower lip that was just guh. He had a line of guys waiting to dance with him."
After several moments of silence, Draco decided to break the ice. "So, when did you become a drunken sot?"
For some reason, that made Harry laugh and laugh and then finally Draco had to as well - then Harry had pulled him down onto the couch and made love to him, again and again until they were both exhausted, mentally, emotionally, and physically.
"Mmmhmmm." The older women stretched out her leg. "Damn, I have a run in my best stockings. Oh well. In a few hours, the men will all be drunk, and won't notice anyway. Makes me wonder why I still bother for them, the sots."
to do anything is beside the point! You simply demand things and expect me to do them! What about me? What about what
"Thanks." Draco looked around and then pulled up another drum and sat down. "No one's owned up, huh?"
When the DJ finally called a break, Draco made his way to the downstairs bar, fighting his way through throngs of men, some of whom would normally would have caused him to stop and stare or flirt outrageously until a frustrated Potter would drag him away. But tonight, he saw only Harry.
His mobile rang as he was putting on his coat for work; a bit late, but he had hours and hours of personal time accumulated and no one seemed to mind if he was a little late now and then. He picked it up, not recognizing the number, but "Hello?"
"Harry James, focus." Hermione sighed from the fireplace. "Look. If you feel that strongly, figure out what was off about her and then go back. I doubt she's going to hold a grudge. It's business here, not love."
He did not envy Bill, and from the look on Bill's face as he took his brother's arm to drag him away and back to the wings, Bill didn't envy Bill either.
"Hmm." Harry was pondering, then brightened. "And is it true that certain, erm, substances are also legal there?"
Underneath the date was a picture of a smiling Sirius holding a baby, surrounded by a woman with red hair and a man who looked suspiciously like the one who shared his bed.
"Harry.” Draco struggled to stay calm. "It wasn't you, I can tell you that. It was all about Draco."
Harry scrambled out of the tree when they were nearly below him, startling them both. "I can carry your luggage," said Harry somewhat breathlessly. "I don't mind. I'm just so happy you're here!"
"Well, he's doing things that are new to him, so guess you'll be doing things that are new to you too."
Draco swallowed. "Yeah, he'll want to do me on the spot. Go me." He took his eyes away from the mirror and faced Paul. "How much do I owe you?"
Aaron was an excellent dancer; he moved with a lot of grace and obviously enjoyed it. Harry's smile at him was shadowed by memories of Draco on the dance floor – another man who loved to dance and was very good at it. He found himself wondering what Draco was doing right now, and with whom. Harry might look different, act somewhat different, but his thought process had not changed, nor had his complete inability to keep his thoughts from being plainly evident on his face; Draco could read his mind, almost. Being almost painfully glad that Harry still thought of him at all was tempered by the extreme irony of the situation.
Three drinks and two more bouts of dancing, and Draco felt the emotional rigors of his day catch up with him. "I'm sorry, but I'm knackered," he finally had to say when another set of songs began. "But this has been a lot of fun. Thank you."
"God I hope not. I'd hate to trample your tender heart. I was checking out Lucius," sighed Charlie. "Too bad there are no centerfolds of him."
He finished the brownie and his coffee, then folded his hands. "You know that whore I told you about? It's Draco. Darcy – that's the name he used – is Draco."
Draco let himself be pulled along -  thinking of Harry not wanting to be near him had sobered him entirely and he felt nothing but sad now. He vaguely heard Pansy and Paul discussing him. "Well, he can't be a blond, it’s too noticeable, at least not that shade; Harry always did like blonds though.”
"Potter, O'Sullivan is a fictional character," said Draco through gritted teeth. "A drunken, whorish fictional character at that. We are not putting you in a position to get mauled, fried or bent beyond repair."
He started his stroll on the Monnikenstraat, walking slowly and surveying the wares; it was odd to see that the older whores were just as proud of their bodies as the younger ones, given the way they dressed and posed – even when the merchandise was clearly marked down due to wear and tear, and in some cases, an apparent fire sale. He was all in favor of flaunting it while you had it, though, so he waved to them and kept walking.
"Possibly," Harry agreed. "But, you know, I know you have your escorts when you're in need of "participation," so I'm sure you're…"
"Four years ago, give or take. Is it obvious?" His tone was a mix of tired and sarcastic. "And you’re horrified, right?”
The next two nights went pretty much the same way; they talked, though not as intensely as they had the first night, and played billiards or darts, or even pinball, and drank. The night after that, they went to dinner. Draco had asked Harry this time, who had agreed, then, somewhat nervously asked if this was a 'date."
"Draco." He felt a wave of something wash over him and he sat down hard on the back of the couch. "Hi."
When he would wake, he would smile at Draco – odd in itself because Harry was by no means a morning person – and lean over to kiss him on the cheek. If miraculously, he kissed him on the lips, it was brief, and if Draco tried to reach for him, pull him down, Harry might let him. Or might not; it seemed to depend on nothing in particular.
He finished his bottle of rum, and crawled into bed, sleeping until the streetlights outside his un-shuttered windows woke him. He sat up, ran a hand through his hair and tried to figure out what exactly he needed. It took him a moment or two, but then he knew.
Harry smiled his thanks and pulled out the chair next to him. Draco sat down with his vodka, trying not to get too close, trying not to act like himself. "Like to dance, huh?" he managed, taking a sip of alcohol immediately.
After kitty-petting came the ritualistic moaning and whining as he forced himself to stand up and take the four long steps to the loo, where he sat down on the toilet with his head in his hands – his ability to aim had been shot a long time ago, along with his sense of self, sense of purpose and ability to balance his checkbook – and propped his chin up on his hand, closing his eyes again. He did all his deep thinking in that pose. First, it was second nature to him by now, and secondly, it was really the only time in any 24-hour period that he was reasonably sober.
“Because you are a spoiled, self-centered man who is shamelessly adored by someone who should know better but allows you to continue your Peter Pan-like existence anyway.”
Blaise poured himself a drink and flopped down on his couch, saying a small prayer to the gods of clubbing and hooking up that Potter would be easy to find; and wouldn't catch on; and that they'd talk and fall back in love and everything would be perfect again.
"Okay, so I found some important clues at the sites of both incidents, and I think we need to start looking around at some prime suspects." Harry narrowed his eyes and looked around suspiciously.
Pansy nodded, draining her appletini and signaling for another round. "Blaise is right Draco. Harry needs to come around on his own time. He's stubborn as hell, you know this." She smiled at the Muggle waiter and discreetly slipped him her number written on a coaster in eyeliner. Blaise rolled his eyes.
There were several moments of silence as they both contemplated the bollixed-up turn their lives had taken, then Harry stood up.
Staring at the screen, Harry noticed something he hadn't before, a number you could call to send one of the "models" to your home for "fun and companionship." His eyes flickered down to the number.
"Sets off your eyes, along with the darker hair, which, despite your bitching and moaning about it, does look hot." Blaise handed him the clothes. "Get dressed and I'll do the glamour."
“Harry…” he felt panic rising in him. “You don’t need to make a statement. I understand, I will change, you just need to give me the chance.”
Next to Molly, Draco shuddered, and Harry noticed that Lucius had taken a spot beside Draco, and Charlie was sitting behind him, braiding his hair. It had to be love.
Harry looked her over; it was true that she plastered with eyeliner and lip gloss, was spilling out of her tank top and that her shorts seemed to be showing some cheek, but…"I didn't know they were supposed to be revealing on purpose, Gin - I thought you were just getting fat”
Harry shrugged. "It is to me…but I've basically spent my whole life here so it's my family, you know? A little odd, a little off beat, but they've mostly all known me since I was a baby, so I'm kind of their pet. I know, it sounds weird."
The thought remained unfinished however, for as he looked up from his popcorn, he saw the huge Graphorn come hurtling towards him, galloping from the center ring where, Draco was sure, it had not been a moment before.
If he was extremely lucky, Harry would turn on his back as he slept and Draco could watch his face, watch the black lashes flutter as he dreamed, watch the lips part slightly as he breathed. Harry smelled like alcohol and cigarette smoke and sometimes cologne which may or may not have been his; it didn't smell like anything Draco had ever bought him, and he'd never known Potter to buy his own.
“No,” Draco said. “It’s all right.” It occurred to him that if he was busy reading, he wouldn’t be asked to join in with the rest of the men.
“Fuck.  Fuck.”  Draco gasped and came hard into Harry, his knees weakening.  “Oh, ffffuck.”  He leaned forward onto his lover for support.
Harry laughed.  “I suppose I was never one to care much about material things.  Besides, if my aunt and uncle caught wind of my account at Gringott’s, they’d have found a way to take it.  I kept it a secret from them.”
“Other way around.  So Harry says.  The git has been coming on to him since he got here.  And Harry is either too Gryffindor to see it, or he sees it and . . . “
Draco looked back and forth between them, the wheels in his head spinning along with Hermione’s.  “She’s right.”
He grinned, trying very hard to suppress the urge to say something that was sure to further embarrass Cicely, as Draco recalled her name to be.  But of course, he couldn’t be completely gentlemanly about it.
Draco suddenly stood and bowed slightly to the Headmistress.  “Excuse me.  I just remembered a matter which requires my attention.”
“That my father didn’t handle the situation better.  That he couldn’t care for his wife and his child. And that my parents kept the truth from me, then tried to make up for it by spoiling me with things and turning me into someone . . .”  He clenched his jaw.
They regarded one another briefly.  Draco appeared unusually uncomfortable and Harry just knew it was because of what happened Friday night.  He just didn’t know what it was.
Anyone? Harry wondered.  Sure, lots of witches were impressed by his heroism during the war.  But Draco wasn’t sucked in by the drama.  He knew Harry was just a regular bloke deep down inside.  A plain, ordinary bloke. No match for the suave, sophisticated pureblood.
Harry looked around to see if there was anyone wandering nearby.  “Look, I know what you did last night,” he said in a hushed voice.
“We just got married yesterday.  The only thoughts I’m having right now involve ropes and a dildo,” Draco said.  He meant to lighten the mood, but sounded more annoyed to Harry.
Pansy reached over and took his hand, squeezing it gently. "What time did you tell him you would be back?"
“What are you doing here?” Harry’s voice was clotted and he cleared his throat, the sound incredibly loud in the silence.
Harry would think about life, love, whether the Prime Minister favored dressing in tulle ball gowns in his spare time, whether he should switch to oyster crackers as his main source of fiber and whether or not mold, once ingested, just as good as penicillin. He rarely came to any solid conclusions, but it passed the time.
Word had spread about the Malfoys, and the tent that night was packed to the brim with people; Minerva was in seventh heaven at the ticket booth, and even Hagrid laid off his usual grumblings about putting his "poor creatures" through their paces.
Harry, for his part, was enjoying himself; he'd found he really liked to dance, and blamed his former reticence entirely on 4th year and being traumatized by McGonagall and Patil. He doubted he'd ever waltz again, but fortunately his current lifestyle didn't entail many ballroom moves other than an occasional dip when Draco decided to get romantic and put on soft music before bed, but since that kind of dancing led invariably to shagging, he was okay with it. Come to think of it, so did this sort of dancing, for some people, at least.
"Yes, that many. And despite his oft-professed love for me, his adoration of how I looked - or used to look, anyway, its different now - and his apparent worship of my body," Harry's tone had turned thickly sarcastic, "…I was, apparently not enough to satisfy him. He could, of course, merely sat me down on our couch and said, "Harry old brick, you're not bad in bed, but honestly? Little boring. Little stale. I'd like to fuck other people. How are you with that?"
is not about you? Ever? This is about me, how *I* feel, what I'm doing, but of course, nothing is ever about me, it’s all you; how stupid of me to forget that!"
"Sure, I mean, it's not like we ever planned on being exclusive or committed, and it's not like we're in love with each other." Harry's voice was expressionless. "You like me, I'm fond of you, but that's about the extent of it, so yeah. I'm fine with it." He drained his beer. "I just came by to check up, say hey, and pick up a change of pants." He looked at Draco, who appeared stunned. Harry smiled. "Close your mouth, Malfoy. I am going out tonight, though, so you know and won't worry."
"Someone else, someone he doesn't know, but might be attracted to, someone he might open UP to …” Pansy deliberately let her words trail off as her brain worked busily.
Something had to be perfect in this world; it might as well be Potter and Malfoy. No one he knew deserved it more.
"YES! See, you understand perfectly. We thought of Polyjuice, but that's nasty and imprecise. We know there will need to be a bit of a glamour on the face, different clothes, but the hair transformation is what we need from you."
"I don't know," answered Draco, after clearing his throat a couple of times. "I hope so, more than anything. It's pretty much all I think about – him coming back to me."
"Not that I know of; that usually doesn't happen till Tuesday." Harry smirked, and Draco, unwillingly and rather unexpectedly, smirked back. He reached out and touched his cheek, startling Harry.
He looked around the room, which was decorated in what interior designers would no doubt term "shabby chic," except that he was pretty sure that wasn't the intended result. But he was hardly one to talk, considering his own flat was decorated in early rummage sale, with a healthy dose of church bazaar thrown in.
Draco had sighed theatrically then. “Look, Harry, it’s been a long day and I could really just use some pampering and peace and quiet. Can we discuss my personality defects later?”
"Can't be Harry then," said Blaise, who hadn't let go of Draco. "Harry has all the grace of a Hippogriff in heat on the dance floor."
It was a little after 9 AM that same morning and Harry had the day off from his job as an editor at Equinox Publishing, a Muggle establishment in London. He was sitting in the kitchen, drinking his coffee and reading The Daily Prophet for the Quidditch standings. Some things had not changed.
"Okay, then, well, cheerio and all that rot." Harry stood and stretched, then absently picked his underwear out of his butt before slouching out the door. He heard the clink of glass against glass in his boss' office, looked at the clock and thought that Kingsley was starting a little early today – probably because he was going to miss Harry tons and tons.
Walking out to the carriages, Harry stopped and stared at the creature that was between the shafts of each one.
"So you aren't worried then? What makes Luna different from you or Hermione?" Harry questioned, ignoring the second half of what he'd said.
Vernon grabbed his trunk and cage, and threw them onto the ground, then pulled Harry out of the car, and they were gone as soon as they'd arrived. Sighing, Harry stood up, brushing his pants off, and didn't even bother getting something to carry his trunk. When he finally made it through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, he only had minutes to get on the train.
Climbing into his bed, Harry adjusted his pillow, fluffing it up to make it more comfortable. He didn't care what time it was, he was going to sleep. Resting his head onto the pillow, Harry sighed in content, letting his eyes flutter shut. He kept the curtains open, as he always did. Closing them made him feel confined, taking him back to his cupboard.
"Well, to the library then? I have an essay due in a few days that I haven't finished yet, and I'd rather not do it last minute." Harry blinked a few times at the sudden shift in her mood, before shrugging.
"Well, seeing as I am the Queen of Bisexual, I'm going to have to say Luna," she replied with a wave of her hand, as though it were a regular thing to be discussing. Harry wondered how she'd come out so effortlessly to him, seemingly thinking nothing of it.
"Alright." Ginny turned to leave, but Harry stopped her. "Hey, Gin? Keep Luna company for me, will you?" he asked, smiling. The ginger rolled her eyes at his not-so-subtle attempts to get the two to spend some time together but smiled nonetheless.
"Malfoy, why are you hiding behind a wall?" Knowing he'd been spotted, the Slytherin revealed himself fully, head down and staring at the ground. He mumbled something Harry couldn't make out, and the raven-haired boy rolled his eyes.
"Fine, let's go." If Ginny noticed the strain in Harry's voice when he said that, she didn't say anything about it.
There was the small matter of the entire school hating Dumbledore and him. People whispered about him as he passed in the halls, though they usually did that. It was different now, they all thought he was going mad, and lying about Voldemort's return. Just hours ago Seamus had confronted him about it, and accused him for not wanting to talk about traumatizing events. Who would though, why should it be any different for him? Maybe the ministry should stop acting like children, and believe Harry when he says that the Dark Lord was back.
"Oh, umm...I had a tad bit of a crush on you. But over the summer, whoosh, the feelings just washed away, so no need to worry about that anymore. Why do you ask?" she replied, blushing slightly from the embarrassment of it all. Who'd have thought Ginny Weasley could get embarrassed?
Harry nodded and looked out the window, something he seemed to have taken a liking to. He shifted in his seat, wincing when there was a sharp pain in his chest. Stupid fractured ribs, he thought as he gripped the seat as if it would help subside the pain.
"Yes sir," Harry said, walking outside and attempting to lift his items into the trunk of the car. It was difficult, especially with Harry as weak as he was. Dudley came up behind him, and Harry flinched, expecting a punch to the face or something of the sort.
"Isn't she? Come to think of it, you've never had a girlfriend, have you? I can't understand why with all the girls you've had chasing after you. Forgive me if this leads me to believe that our very own Harry Potter is...a faggot," she sneered, taking a step forward. Malfoy tensed, going unnoticed by the other Slytherins, and Harry's eyes darted towards him before looking back at the bitch that was now a few inches from his face.
"Merlin no, I'm in here enough as it is," Harry muttered, sitting up in the bed and getting out. He winced at the sharp pain that shot up his leg, and his eyes shot down to his ankle.
Unlike Hermione, Ginny, Fleur, Gabrielle, and Merlin knew who else, who all found him obnoxious when he was high, the female residents of Amsterdam seemed to take him in stride. Either they were extremely tolerant people, or, as Harry suspected, they all partook in various calming herbs as well, for they listened to his stories, applauded his impressions and cheered him on in karaoke. He thought his rendition of "Rocket Man" was particularly impressive, and no one told him any differently.
- are telling me to man up? The man who was distraught when his purple velvet hostess gown was wrinkled?"
Days went by, and Harry was often not home until the early morning hours. No matter how soundly he was sleeping – which wasn't very – Draco would wake when Harry came in. It wasn't that he was loud, or drunk - well, all right, occasionally drunk. It was more that Draco just knew when he was there; the air shifted and changed. Draco wasn't sure if it was magic or if it was just that he was super-sensitive to Harry's presence. But he always knew.
Draco blinked and opened his eyes. "What the fuck?" he complained, rolling over. "Why did you do…" He caught the look in Harry's eyes. "…Harry? What's the matter?" He sat up.
He rapped his wand on the wood to call for order – a signal that went largely ignored. He sighed. "Silence!" he called, his voice lost in the babble. He then shook his head and pulled out his wand, casting a Sonorous charm. "SILENCE!" he boomed. This time, the room quieted, until the only sound was the Fat Lady trying to cross her legs…it sounded much like two rubber rafts being jostled together in the back of a very small wagon. Finally, she managed, and folded her arms, staring at Dumbledore. He stared back for a moment, before turning his glance to the rest of the assembled folk and decided to dispense with preamble and pleasantries. "You have, I trust, all heard the rumors that the Tour is to acquire a new act."
"Yes. You both have a similar way of speaking, and you use your hands like he does. He thinks I talk with my hands, but I'd swear he was an old Italian woman and I’ve threatened to tie his hands behind his back when we argue; I'm always figuring I'll wind up cracked across the face one of these days."
"You remind me of him." This was said abruptly and Draco looked up, his face a careful mask. "Do I?"
The club had tiny, two-person-at-best tables scattered along the perimeter of the floor, and it was there Harry headed, to one near the stairs; he flopped down and sighed, picking at his soaked shirt and trousers. Draco maneuvered his way over, holding the scotch neat high to avoid spilling it. When he reached Harry, he looked down. "Is this seat taken?"
Harry stood and looked him in the eye. "I'm doing what *I* want from now on, get it? And even better, I'm telling you now, not hiding it or waiting for you to find out by accident!"
Darcy sat back on his knees and smirked. "Partaking in all the city has to offer, are you? I taste cocoa and hemp."
Harry's brow immediately furrowed – Ministry "experiments" had abounded after the War, some with disastrous results. In public, and at state events, Shacklebolt was fond of saying that you never heard about all the good results, only the bad. Harry had always been quick to point out that it was because, as the saying went, "When she was good, she was very, very good, and when she was bad she was horrid."
The act was somewhat abbreviated, but had gone on well enough, and then it was time for final skits and such. There had been no attack, not even the slightest sign of danger, and Draco found himself breathing a sigh of relief. Obviously those other two incidents had been just coincidental…terribly bad luck, granted, but happenstance only.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Is this just a passing phase? Please tell me it is, and I will stop by the barber tomorrow morning. I’ll take a picture of this on my mobile to remember it by.” He glanced at Draco and sighed. “You’d cry, wouldn’t you?”
"Yeah, I guess you would be." He didn't want to talk about it anymore, so changed the subject quickly. "I think the only real option is for me to dress up as you next performance and see what happens."
Draco grumbled, but slipped into the outfit and looked at himself in the mirror. He did look good, not much like himself, but still good. Blaise nodded behind him. "Okay now.” He muttered an incantation and Draco's face changed subtly; the shape of his mouth was a bit different, the slope of the nose, the contours around his cheekbones. It was not drastic, but it was enough. Blaise nodded, satisfied. "There, you're gorgeous yet not Draco-gorgeous."
Closer, he could see that Harry was as close to the stone as he could be without actually becoming one with it, that his cheek was laid against the smooth surface and that his eyes were closed. That he could deal with.
Harry was not an aerialist, but rather performed various odd jobs around the circus – he often acted as the straight man for clown jokes and had gotten hit in the face with more pies than Chaplin. He helped dress the dancing bears and once in a while, stuck the needles in the Man Who Felt No Pain. But by and large, he was most known for his unerring ability to hit a target when shot out of a cannon, hence the moniker, "Cannonball Harry, the Hardest-Headed Man in Britain."
This afternoon he decided that nine viewings of the Fawlty Towers episode where all the guests were shagging each other (and Manuel, to boot) was enough, and flipped to a heavy metal station, coming into the middle of a song he'd never heard before. He listened, entranced, to a voice that was partly a sober Ville Valo crossed with Chris Isaak on acid, and tossed with a bit of Keith Richards. Whether Richards was sober or not in this mix was debatable, but the fact remained that while the song was rather unremarkable, the voice was, well, entrancing.
Later, lying there dazed and panting, Draco wondered how many passers-by had heard their moans, whimpers, or his own outright yelps as they made their way to the market, or work, or the nearby school to pick up their children. Or how many children had heard the filthy, awful things they had called each other during their sweaty entanglement -  each of the four times they'd gone. And frankly, he thought if the leather of that jacket wasn't 'seasoned' by now, it never would be.
"People love the animal acts, Hagrid," Harry said, petting the three-headed llamabull, "They'd be sad if they came to the show and they were gone. Granted, the chimera might not be missed – except at the company barbecue – but still!"
"As you may recall, I did try and talk to you, several times. You chose to either dig at me or ignore me; I had to do something, Harry! The regular ways for people to communicate weren't working, so I…"
She rolled her eyes. "Yes. I'm here every night, all night. Are you interested or just looking for a chat-up? Because charming as you are, idle chit-chat isn't a luxury I can afford, off the clock. So…?"
As it turned out, Ginny did share her bun - by walloping him in the face with it, and then running off crying. The running seemed to be somewhat hampered by her stiletto mules, but she still made impressive time. From the depths of Trelawney's tent floated a voice. "That was not a wise answer, my dear boy."
Draco lifted his head. "What do you mean, if it looks like me? Who the hell else would I look like?"
The next morning found Draco leaning on the window sill, staring out over the river as the sun rose, but this time it was the Thames, in his own home, and while he still hadn't slept, he had good reason; the reason lay about five feet away haphazardly covered with a sheet, arms thrown wide and a decidedly shagged expression on his sleeping face.
Up front, Dumbledore was once again whipping out his wand, and to preserve their eardrums, people quieted. "Now," he continued, "I know that many of you are concerned and feel, perhaps a bit slighted, but that is simply not the case. Their troupe is disbanding due to financial pressures, and their act needs a home. I am happy to be able to provide one and am confident," he added, his beetle-like brows furrowing ever-so-threateningly, "that you all will make them welcome in our home."
"Fuck me,” he groaned, but he had to give Blaise a small smile in return. "Thank God Pansy doesn't run my office, I'd be bankrupt."
Fuck, why, why, why did you say that? Harry closed his eyes and wished the words back as hard as he could.
Draco felt bad – bloody fucking conscience again. It wasn't this guy's fault that he'd found Harry hot. Apparently, a whole shitload of people now did. "No, no, it’s not that, the result is fine, it looks good, you did a tremendous job, er, Paul. It's just the whole reasoning behind this change that has me bothered. So please, what do I owe you?"
The lights were hot and he tossed the kernels on the ground before wiping his face. "I didn't think much of you and Ron tossing stuff off the upper catwalk the other day; I figured you two were just passing time, and Ron was. But you were seeing how fast something would fall, and you made sure that you were on that catwalk before the show, "testing the ropes," when what you were really doing was cutting the anchor wires on the lamp, leaving one to fray. When the cannon went off, the vibrations shook the last remaining wire, so that it would drop momentarily. You figured one way or the other, someone would get hurt. "
Draco listened; he knew what Harry had probably made - Muggle dishes from his childhood, pathetic though it had been -  and true, he wrinkled his nose at it usually, but swore on the spot that if he ever got presented with it again, he would eat it, and happily. "I stayed in, myself, but I'm afraid I didn't do anything that productive. I kind of lay on my bed and stared at the ceiling, watching the patterns of light change till it was pitch black and I finally slept."
Blaise sighed and guided Draco back to his flat where he poured them both a stiff shot of whiskey and sat next to Draco while he downed it. "You gonna be okay, Drac?"
Draco was watching Harry through half-closed eyes; his eyes had fluttered closed with pleasure when the fingers first breached him, but he forced them open so he wouldn't miss a moment of Harry's face as he entered him and filled him. The fact that Harry was taking him, being forceful, being rough, only served to increase his arousal; and when Harry pulled his fingers out and pushed into him in one smooth move, Draco bit down hard on his lip to keep from crying out - fuck, it felt so good, so right to be filled by Harry, to smell him, taste him, feel his skin under his fingernails. He wrapped his legs around Harry's waist and groaned as he was slammed into over and over again.
"I know, right? Luckily that's the only thing that got limp – besides, I'd just had too many fireballs from the front desk candy jar and my lips got temporarily numb. It was easily remedied. Oh, and Kingsley says you get all my open files. Try not to spill Jamaican Rasta Roasta on 'em will you?"
Twenty minutes later, he came back downstairs. Draco was sitting on the couch where they usually watched the telly, but it was off, as were most of the lights. He looked up when Harry entered the room, then stared at him.
The search was immediately fruitful, as the band had its own website, complete with pictures, biographies, tour dates, and links to download their latest CD. Harry read it all, taking a particularly close look at their lead singer, the possessor of that brilliant voice.
The crowd was murmuring to themselves, as Dumbledore knelt over the mat and muttered a dissolving charm, freeing Draco, and therefore Lucius from their now-painful positions. They struggled to their feet, Harry taking Draco's arm to steady him, Dumbledore at Lucius' side.
"Are you a photographer by trade?" Up close, the eyes still looked bruised, although there was no trace of physical damage. Up close, it was just another illusion – Darcy seemed proficient at creating those.
"No, you fucking git, it’s ours, except you won't let anything go, you won't talk to me, and instead you ignore it, ignore me, and seem content with our life together going to shit!"
"Yeah? Me too." Harry stubbed out his smoke and took a sip of scotch. Draco took the moment to look at Harry, really look at him; the messy, slightly spiky hair, the curve of his cheekbones, how his lips moved when he talked, smoked, drank.
Draco was having a hard time breathing, and Pansy sat down beside him. "Breathe, darling, in and out, in and out.”
"All right, Just Harry." He smiled. "Now, you do know the rules, right? Pay by the hour or the night – an hour is one hundred twenty Euros. A night – four hours – is a flat fee of four hundred Euros. This is straight sex, which does include blowjobs – if I like you, I swallow, and if not, I spit. Get over it."
The sarcasm had turned bitter. "At least then I could have said "How can we fix this? How can we make it better? I could have told him I loved him and I wanted it to work. Or I even could have said fine, fuck you, asshole, I'm out of here -  but no. He kept it secret till I found out one night, and then the fucker had the balls to tell me it meant nothing, it was a diversion!” Harry's voice had risen. "Breaking my fucking heart was a bloody
A ruckus on the dance floor caught his attention - apparently someone had just been proposed to, propositioned, possibly punched out; it was hard to tell. But whatever it was, it called for a round of shots - Jägermeister being the poison of choice. Draco fully expected Harry to demur, being a strictly scotch and beer man, but as the shots slid down the bar, Harry grabbed two, pushed one at Draco and picked up the other, tossing it back easily. He shook his head after swallowing and gave Draco a smile. "Tastes like Nyquil."
