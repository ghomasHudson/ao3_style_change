“We always held out hope that you would make your way back to us,” Blaise says.
Potter looks the same, hair wild at the top with a few longer curls covering his scar. He’s wearing a jumper and dark jeans because of course he is and, god, he realizes he's staring when Potter frowns a little. It’s hard not to. It’s been five years and somehow Draco still finds himself speechless when it comes to Potter. He’s always managed to roll into Draco’s life like a bombshell. He hopes he’s not being too obvious, but also expects Potter to call him out on it. He always did.
Draco looks up and sees Padma walk around the Rig in circles, her hands slowly tracing through the air and a visible ripple appears. The wards are new, something she’s been practicing. The first time she had successfully done it, Draco had been her test subject. With the barrier up, he couldn’t see or hear the Wives despite the fact that they were in the same room, standing just a few feet apart.
He pulls up his scarf and pulls down his goggles. He knows he can lose them in the storm. He’s driven through them and made it out every single time. As they drive closer, he gets a thrill at seeing that there is no horizon and instead a wall of dust and wind, impossibly large and daunting.
He keeps calm when he looks over to Ace. “We’re heading East.”
He leans up and looks at Draco. “However long it takes. I can wait. When you feel ready, I want to show you how beautiful you are as much as you’ve shown me.”
. Sweat beads down his back and forehead, salt stinging his eyes. They’re both breathing hard, gasping for breath in the dry air under the sweltering sun.
“Darling,” she says, pulling back from the embrace and eyeing him. He doesn’t miss the pointed look she gives him as she sees who's behind him. He knows that Potter is behind him and yet he is so unprepared for her mischievous look.
“Of course everyone misses me,” he says instead, playing with the spine of the champagne glass. “Leaving becomes much harder every time. The way you all look at me.”
“Draco Malfoy, old habits die hard, hm?” Pansy says, looking at him with brows raised and a slight smile tugging at her lips. Her lipstick is pristine red, sharp, and gorgeous. He looks at her, breathing out the smoke.
After minutes of making out, they pull apart, both panting.
“So it is Draco now?” Ron made a face.
Draco takes in their height difference. ‘What the fuck happened to you, giant?’ Though he sounds a bit impressed.
When Harry walked towards the entrance of Hogwarts, Draco was already waiting for him. Harry was dressed in blue jeans and a Gryffindor red sweater. Draco was dressed in black jeans with a black slightly oversized sweater. Harry thought he looked amazing.
Tears watered her eyes and she had to bit her lip to stop herself from crying. She took a deep breath and then called a house elf for some wine.
One of the student boys spoke up. “He is a deatheater though. He deserves it.”
Draco visibly blushed. ‘And you are my lion, Harry.’
Draco jumped from her lap and started walking around in childlike energy. “Okay! I can keep a secret. Pinky promise?”
“Dear Alexander,
She walked up to the record player and started to play some pretty French music.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Definitely. I mean, if you want to,’ Draco looks up to him.
Narcissa sighed and leaned back in the couch while drinking straight from the bottle. After awhile she started to feel drowsy.
Harry chuckled. ‘The monsters, huh? And who were the monsters?’
The curse kept going. It seemed to be never ending. Narcissa felt weak. Just hold on.., hold on, keep fighting, for Draco.
“What do you think of playing hide and seek with the house elves after your bath?”
Lucius moved on top of her. She closed her eyes.
“That would be such a shame of my nails,” Narcissa said playfully. “I just painted them red this morning.”
I posted this chapter a bit sooner than planned :) hope you enjoy it!
Draco didn’t know that yet.
Draco looked at her. “Are you going to teach me how to dance, mom?”
‘For years? Merlin, Draco. Then I guess I should introduce you to my friends fast,’ Harry takes Draco’s hand in his.
Harry responds hungerly to the kiss. Both panting, they break apart.
“Nooooooo”
“Do you really think that, mom?” Draco asked.
“Pretty like you,” Draco almost whispered.
Narcissa stiffened. It was an innocent question, she knew. Just curiousity from a little child. Personally, Narcissa didn’t have a problem with gay people. She accepted them just like she would accept a straight couple. After all, love is love.
“None of your business.”
Draco smiled against him. ‘I love you, lion.’
Pomfrey moved Harry out of the way. He watched as she performed several spells on the blonde. He cried out in pain a few times after which Pomfrey forced him to drink a pain relief potion. It all took just a few minutes before Pomfrew was done.
“Sure thing, dragon,” she smiled. She doubt that Draco could actually read all the words. He was already able to read. After all, Lucius made him learn that at a young age. But still, big words he may find hard.
“Thank you, for helping me to the hospital wing yesterday and chasing those students away. You didn’t have to do it,” Malfoy said softly.
”I don’t care.”
Narcissa walked over to the tree. Suddenly, her arms were filled with her little boy.
Narcissa placed her hand upon Lucius’s, hoping to calm the man a bit. Yet, Lucius aggresively shrugged down her hand and stood up.
I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment to leave your opinions! :))
The Slytherin looked up, meeting Harry’s eyes. ‘You know?’ he whispered.
Harry bit his lips as he watched how the Slytherin breaks down in front of everyone. He was crying, shaking and gasping for breath. Hermione and Ron look horrified, so do others.
I am really sorry for the delay tho :( School proved itself to be more busy than expected! For you all who are also in school: goodluck!!!)
‘The seeker from the Australian quidditch team is gay, thats the news?’ he said confused.
Narcissa grinned. “Alright, silly. Mommy will wait for you.”
”N-Narcissa? I was wondering if...”
“Yeah, of course! And I am happy, darling. Because of you. You are the sunshine in my life. You are my little dragon,” Narcissa chuckled while hugging him.
“Whatever.”
They spent the whole week dancing. They laughed until it hurted and they swayed and twirled until their feet grew tired.
Harry smiled. This person was definitely not a Gryffindor. This person sounds very sarcastic as well. Harry rather liked it.
“It is okay now, they left. They won’t hurt you anymore,” Harry spoke in such a soft voice that it even surprised himself.
Harry didn’t let Malfoy finish his rambling. ‘Don’t worry. Really, I don’t mind. Besides, you’re cute when you are asleep.’ Well fuck. He didn’t mean to say that.
Draco felt someone spit on him, a harsh shove causing him to leap forward, the edge of the table stabbing him painfully in the stomach. He doesn’t care about that though. He just lost his friends.
”My little dragon, take this. It helps against your tummy.”
‘Oh hell yeah.’ was the answer Harry got.
“But you already did! I always feel way better when I am with you. Don’t you worry, dragon of mine!”
“It is Malfoy, Harry. Have you forgo.. OW HERMIONE,” Ron yelled as Hermione kicks him from under the table.
And more convo between Harry and Draco! :D
Lucius was not arrogant at all. He never drawled about his family wealth. He kept mostly to himself. Narcissa always saw him studying at the late nights. He was ambitious, of that she was sure.
They felt complete.
The man grabbed a box and pulled something out. It was a dragon figure. Narcissa barely contained a chuckle, the man didn’t even know her son is literally called Draco which means dragon in latin.
She cried tears of happiness. She rubbed her belly softly.
Draco flushes red. ‘Yes, I do.’
”I don’t want to.”
Such an innocent little boy.
I’ll do a little Hermione POV at the beginning :)
“Merlin, no! These were horrible. Damn, I didn’t know you could fail so hard at making chocolate,” Harry laughed.
Harry smiled a bit at the sight. Malfoy is easy to carry, he is very light, Harry noticed. He made his way over to the bedrooms. Once there, he found himself fucked. He didn’t know the password to get into Draco Malfoy’s room. Only one option left him. Harry pulled the Slytherin a bit closer, not wanting him to fall out of his arms, and made his way over to his own room.
It is so bloody hot!, is the first thing that comes to Harry’s mind as he walks on the sand.
It changed to blue. She was having a boy.
Lucius face changed to annoyance as Draco kept on yelling ‘mommy’ while running off the stairs.
“Alright then. Now lets try not to fall asleep through this class,” Harry joked.
“Don’t pretend like you weren’t listening. I’m getting rid of that stupid toy Draco owns. It was a bad idea, Cissy.”
”Yes! Oh this is brilliant mommy! You are a pureblood girl and I love you. We can get married and then you won’t have to be with father anymore! We will move away and live happily together,” he sighed happily.
Draco shakes his head. “You couldn’t have known. I never even told you that I am.. you know..,”
Draco felt heavy and his urge to leave grew stronger by seconds. “I am, aunt Bellatrix.”
“Ofcourse honey, don’t worry about it so much. I trust in it,” Narcissa smiled. “I must go now, I’m babysitting Teddy today. I’ll see you again soon dear.”
Harry smiled and cuddled with Draco. “Goodnight Draco.”
It was already dark outside, as it was night time. The stars were shining above them, the moon and street laterns providing the only lights. Both smiling at the romantic vibe, they held hands and stood in the streets, staring above them.
“Fine.”
Narcissa smiled slightly at the elf. “I’m fine. Can you check on Draco though? Make sure he is asleep. After that you can do something fun for yourself, okay? Go treat yourself,” Narcissa answered while handing Marty some money.
Lucius would never join them.
Malfoy stares at him for a second, before shaking Harry’s hand. ‘I’m Draco.’
Draco started reading but soon he started stuttering over the words. He frowned to himself disappointed. He was trying so hard but the word just wouldn’t come out.
Harry glanced at the clock. It read 11:49. Harry groans. Why the fuck hadn’t he think of his stupid homework earlier? Oh yeah, he was too busy playing chess and other games with Ron and Neville. Harry sighed and grabbed his stuff. He decided he would make it in the eight year common room. Maybe sitting in front of the fireplace would give him some motivation to actually make the assigment.
Excuse me for spelling mistakes!
‘I don’t. I stopped ‘hating’ you in sixth year. How can I still hate you after seeing these things you were forced to do, though you didn’t want to? You were falling apart in daylight, and you still are. Pity, because you seem like a nice guy. I like those cookies you made.’
Draco turned to his mother, shocked and cheeks blushing greatly. “What?”
Narcissa nodded. “Okay then. I assume that Draco and I won’t be coming with you?”
He put the letters in his bag and stood up, heading for the library. Tonight he will make the brownies.
She tried to hold back the tears but eventually they fell down her cheeks. A little finger wiped them away.
“Draco.”
Her belly started to show. Narcissa loved it. It showed that he was there. A little boy was inside of her.
‘Like who, exactly? Potter, not only am I gay but I’m also an ex-deatheater. You haven’t forgotten yet, have you?’ Malfoy says matter of factly.
Draco cried out in agony. He fell onto his knees and then threw up over Lucius his feet. Quickly, Draco scrambled back, crying in fear and pain, still holding a hand on his aching stomach.
Narcissa smiled. “C’mon, lets do another dance. We still have the whole evening.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “No! Father I am really sorry! It is me, not the toy! I’ll make it up to you!”
“What is up?” She asked.
‘You promise?’
“No, he doesn’t. He wasn’t one by choice, nor is he one anymore. Leave, now,” Harry spoke in a low voice.
Draco smiled back. “Okay, Harry. I’m going to take a shower now. See you around.”
Harry only laughs. “Getting a midnight snack. Real question is, what are you doing here? Wouldn’t think the kitchens is a place where you come.”
Lucius roughly grabbed Draco’s chin to make him look up. “Look at me when I speak!”
“Are you ready for a child?” Lucius asked her one day at the dinner table.
A soft sniffle brings Harry out of his thoughts. He looks at Draco only to see tears falling down his cheeks which he is trying to hide. Harry quickly moves over to Draco and holds his wrists.
“Good morning, father and mother.”
Draco had been on the edge of the couch the whole time, almost bouncing up and down in barely contained excitement. He grinned happily.
The deatheaters laughed obnoxiously. “He will catch some muggles for us and torture them!” Someone called.
Draco felt sick too. He felt faint to his head as he realized that this might be his future. Becoming a monster like all of them. He didn’t know what to say but fortunately for him, Greyback already spoke up.
Harry laughed and pushed Draco playfully. “You were the one to bring up Snape in grandma clothes?”
Lucius wasn’t amused. “I don’t care, I don’t want a fat wife,” he said matter of factly.
‘Hi, I’m Harry. What is your name?’ Harry says, sticking out his hand.
“Miss Narcissa. Please excuse my sudden appearence while you are studying. I had a request. It would be my highest pleasure to take you to the ball. You don’t have to answer just now. Just keep in mind that I’ll be waiting for you.”
“Right.”
Draco wasn’t fooled. “Father was killing you,” he said in a teary voice.
“What is wrong?” He asks concerned.
Love, me!
‘Nothing! Sorry to wake you, you can go back to s-sleep now’
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Oh please, I am over that. We were all victims of the war. He had no choice. It not his fault he got placed in that family. And he never meant it. He was just scared.”
‘You ate them?’
‘Yes?’
Narcissa nodded. “Of course, darling,” she said while unbuttoning his shirt.
“No,” the Slytherin quickly answered. “Also, call me Draco.”
I was going to ask you if you would like to go for tea sometime. The offer still stands, although I understand if you don’t want to, considered you are married.
Harry kept in his laugh. Draco was being so fucking oblivious.
It colored white. Tears rolled over her cheeks.
Finally it was over. Lucius watched his now unconscious son on the ground. “He is pitiful. I won’t let this ruin my dinner though,” he scoffed.
“Step aside, Cissy.”
”Oh little dragon... Mommy missed you too,” she smiled softly. She grabbed him gently and then swirled him around in the air, melting at his laugh. She eventually sat him down again and kissed his forehead.
Narcissa grinned back. “Perhaps not this time. I am thinking of a new hiding spot and it is really good.”
“Oh, shut it silly! You will always be my little dragon.”
Draco didn’t look happy at all. Perfectionism, at the age of six. Damn you, Lucius.
Narcissa wanted to grab his hand. Tell him that it would be okay. Mommy can handle this. Mommy is strong enough. But she couldn’t.
How are the flowers in the garden going? Are the roses growing already?
Draco shook his head. “Nothing, mom. Don’t worry,” he tried to smile reassuring.
They kept dancing for hours till no end. Dancing until their feet grew tired and the music lost its sway. Dancing until they lay down on the ballroom floor, listening to the last notes of ‘La Vie en rose’ by Édith Piaf.
Draco nodded but tears were shining in his eyes. Narcissa hugged him close and grabbed his hand. “It will be okay, Draco. I promise.”
“Are you attempting to make a chocolate cake, Draco?” Harry laughs.
“Yes, father,” The child barely contained his shaking.
“Fine,” Lucius spoke dangerously calm. He stepped back, never keeping his eyes off the trembling forms of his wife and son. “Let’s have it your way then. Crucio.”
Harry recognizes the unoccupied bed as that of Draco. Where the hell could he be? It is long after curfew and Harry swore he had seen Draco getting into bed just a few hours ago. Maybe he had a nightmare and went out to get some fresh air?
‘Don’t look away from me, Draco!, I love them. They suit you.’
Greyback snickered. “Do we have a shy one here?”
She looked away respectfully when Draco relieved himself and she helped him move to wash his hands. They then walked back to his bedroom and Narcissa tucked him in. It was then that she noticed the tears.
Too shocked to react, Harry let it happen. It didn’t last long though because Draco pulled back, looking panicked.
P.S I hope I didn’t fuck up this time.
Harry thought. “No idea. The other boys think it is a hufflepuff girl. Do you have an idea, Malfoy?”
Narcissa screamed in pain with the last push. The sheets below her were soaked in blood. But then she saw him. A tiny little baby.
Harry moved over to the bed as soon as the witch left.
Draco only blushes deeply, looking down at the ground embarrased.
‘What the fuck, Draco?’
It was all Draco’s fault. If he was better then maybe he and mom could have moments like this forever and always. If he was better then mom wouldn’t drink too much wine and cry herself to sleep. If he was better then everything would be better.
Harry chuckled as he heard Draco’s breath evening, as he fell quickly asleep. Harry smiled, and let the sound of the soft breathing make himself fall asleep too. Pretty soon, both boys were asleep, limps tangled together.
Lucius kept on glaring. “It is that toy of you, isn’t it? It keeps on distracting you from what is important.”
Narcissa’s eyes widened. No, not that. He wouldn’t...
‘Hmm?’
“No problem. And what else were I supposed to do? Just leave you there? I’m not like that,” Harry said. He was surprised Malfoy actually thanked him.
“Don’t deny it, mother. I’m not stupid. Father says it himself! If I wasn’t such a bother then he wouldn’t resent us,” Draco said sadly. “Everything would be better if I wasn’t such a disappoi...”
Narcissa heard Draco whimpering in fear and then moving to hide behind her. “He just has a stomach ache, Lucius. I’ll get him a potion. Go back to sleep,” she said calmly.
Narcissa turned to face him. “What did Harry Potter think of your brownies?” She smirked.
There was a small trickle of blood coming from Malfoy’s lips and his right cheek was bruised. He was slightly holding his midribs and a bruise in the form of fingers was seen of his wrists.
Narcissa thinks. “He likes drawing a lot but also reading. But I am not looking for books or coloring stuff. I am looking for a toy he can play with it.”
‘You aren’t denying anything, I see?’ Theo said, looking over at Draco.
“You are trying so hard, little dragon. I’m sure Harry appreciates that. And I think the chance is big that he might likes you back.”
“Sleep well, Harry,” came the tired response.
They weren’t alone. So many deatheaters were within their company today. Bellatrix, Greyback, Yaxley and way more. Oh, and of course the snake. Nagini slid under the table, sometimes climbing over someone’s lap to go onto the table.
“I’m not shy!” Draco spoke up. “I just... I was in thought. Excuses.”
‘No, it is not. I just want to sit with you if that is alright with you,’ Harry smiles gently.
She threw the wine bottle at the floor and it broke on the floor. She sighed as she looked at the damage she did. Narcissa put her head in her hands and started to sob in sadness, frustration and anger.
“I’m afraid I’ll stand on your toes, mom,” Draco chuckled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiles at him. ‘So I’ve noticed. Doesn’t mean I want to be there too. I’m good right where I am.’
They were silver, unlike the dull grey that Lucius had.
”Oh, well... would you like to marry a girl?” She asked.
“Thanks.”
‘I mean, not only when you are asleep, if you thought I meant that. You are cute awake too. I mean, handsome. Like, you know, not that I.. I mean, shit. You just have you know.. grey eyes?’
They made the rest of the journey to the gardens companionably. Draco answered any questions they had and pointed out various magical items they might find interesting. The problems didn't start until they actually stepped out of the house.
Lucius flicked his gray eyes from the barrel shaped man and his pretty wife to the two charming children staring enraptured up at his wife. "Interesting. Recessive gene, perhaps?" he inquired blandly as he sipped at his tumbler of scotch.
"Quite," he agreed. "Tell me, Draco. What possessed you to seek an acquaintance with Potter after all these years? If I'm remembering correctly, neither of you got on during school regardless of political disagreements," Lucius asked with careful neutrality.
Despite all of their bad history and past decisions Draco knew his parents had mellowed, especially his father. His forced period of trying to kill Potter had lost Lucius all of his taste for the death of children. Of course it had never been all that strong to begin with. Watching his son suffer through the war and seeing the birth of his beloved grandson had smothered any lingering inclination.
Draco popped from his seat as if pushed and quickly strode toward her, kissing her cheek lightly. "Grand-mère, I hope your Portkey travel was satisfactory?" he inquired out of obligation.
Scorpius looked at his grandfather doubtfully. "We can go, then?"
Smiling lightly, Narcissa stroked her hands up his chest and curled them around his neck burying her fingers in his long hair. "It's not all that unexpected," she almost whispered as she leaned closer to him feeling his arousal press into her through her silk nightgown. "He is in love with our son after all."
"So we're to have muggles on Saturday," she concluded curiously. "Is there anything I should tell the house-elves about? Nothing muggles can't eat or are allergic to?" she asked with a charming level of ignorance that made Draco smile.
, the tea bag had read- and reflected on the change.
Feeling a tad flushed even in the shade with the cool breeze, Narcissa fanned herself with her hand. “What is it, Dinky?” she asked as she carefully saved her place and closed the book.
He decided to start at one corner and wind his way around, Lucius following in his wake.
"Wow." Harry smiled crookedly in awe. "Well, what about us meeting up at your shop, then? How did they engineer that?" he questioned eagerly, definitely more impressed than annoyed.
It was almost too much for Harry to bear.
Harry was dwelling on the thought of having to go through his heirloom vaults with his once sworn enemy at his side. While Draco was worrying over the apparently upcoming dinner at the Weasleys'.
A sour look came over Lucius’s face. “Ah, yes. It seems that they have been quite successful at it, too. Making full use of our house-elves and those snakes as I understand it.”
Audrey nodded thoughtfully before answering. "The research that's been conducted has shown that most wizards have a pretty average sperm count and that the problems, the miscarriages occur partway through the first trimester in women and matris. The embryo will attach to the uterine wall and begin to grow then for no apparent reason detach itself and begin to disintegrate."
"Ah." Molly smiled in understanding, reaching over and stroking a soothing hand over Harry's messy black hair. "It's alright to be cautious about these things, dear. It never helped anybody to rush in when they weren't ready. Take your time and be sure you're moving in a direction you're comfortable with," she advised.
He tuned in just in time to hear Scorpius hiss something that roughly translated to, "GshfjGH ASS djfiMYhg bollocks."
Stumbling out of the fireplace and into an elegant Welcoming Parlor, Harry set Lily on her feet then turned as the floo flared again to help James and Albus out of the grate.
"Yes." Draco nodded. "He's known about the Wizarding World since Harry left for Hogwarts and apparently both of his children will be attending Hogwarts when they turn eleven."
And just as they'd rehearsed all morning, Lily took off after her snake as she slithered away into the crowd.
"No, Teddy will want to be left alone," Harry answered. "He's the kind of kid that won’t talk until he's absolutely ready."
George had watched in some fascination the familiar banter between as his brother-in-law and their once sworn enemy. "Malfoy. What a lovely home you have," he complimented with a cheeky grin.
“Our friends, my family, our children,” she explained sounding strangled. “I can barely keep myself functioning. I haven’t been able to take care of the kids properly in I don’t know how long. I haven’t been much of a mother to them. I can’t be much of one. Not now.”
"But that was over ten years ago," she continued. "My family has closer ties with Harry Potter than the Wizarding World realizes. When they met up again after Harry's wife left it was hardly the farthest leap that they would end up letting bygones be bygones."
He wasn't oblivious to the fact that there seemed to be some sort of history between his grandma and Mrs. Malfoy, but that didn't keep her or Draco from being really nice to him. And he hadn't seen Harry look as happy as when he was with Draco. Before, when he was married to Aunt Ginny, truly happy smiles and laughter were rare. His smiles almost never reached his eyes. Harry hadn't been happy for a long time.
"Very well." The goblin stepped off of his stool and called to another goblin measuring rubies at one of the tall counters on either side of the room.
Lucius was still studying him intently, thinking over his words before he answered. "I will warn you, Mr. Potter, that my son is possessive and what he takes to claim, he keeps." And with those cryptic words the older man strode off to speak to the stable manager leaving Harry feeling uneasy and even more confused.
"They choose to be in servitude?" she asked incredulously, a bit of an angry glint in her eyes. Draco could tell that she was becoming quickly disenchanted with the Wizarding World. Dudley didn't need to see the unpleasant truth. He'd been forced into hiding during the war and attacked by Dementors. He knew it wasn't all charms and lights and old magical things.
Albus weaved in and out of shoppers as he ran as far away from his father as he could. Angry tears streamed down his face, but he kept going until he bounced off of a portly wizard and tumbled to the ground.
Lily hummed in thought then nodded to herself resolutely. “
This is one of the inscriptions that traditionally is rumored to be etched into the blade of Excalibur. Alfred, Lord Tennyson described the hilt of Excalibur to be like this in his poem, "Mort d'Arthur".
They both nodded to him as they stepped up to the door. Harry pulled out the key and slid it into the lock. He tried to turn it, but found it stiff and jerky as the mechanisms grinded like rusty bolts. Finally, he had it turned all the way and a reverberating clang signaled the end of the revolution. Harry waited for the kinds of sound that had followed at the Potter vault, but he heard nothing.
Pulling back, Draco stared at her stunned before stuttering a choked thank you of his own. Molly just smiled sweetly at him and patted his cheek before moving away letting Arthur take her place.
Muggle-born children were coming into the Wizarding World knowing next to nothing about wizarding customs, history, tradition, or even how to function like a wizard. As a consequence they’re ignorant influence was losing the Wizarding World much of its culture to accommodate them.
"What're you guys doing?" James whispered from his place by the door.
Cassiopeia sipped at her tea seeming completely unaffected by the past few moments of conversation. It was easy to see who Lucius got his intimidation techniques from.
The children had long since lost patience with sitting at their own table and were now scattered in the back field playing games and chasing each other. Scorpius had pulled his outer robe off and practically threw it at Draco before he sprinted off after Albus with a wide smile plastered on his face.
"I don't hate you!" Lily piped up from her seat. "You're not bad anymore, and you're really nice to us, and- and- I like you!"
"How do we do that?" James asked sitting up again, his eyes bright with excitement Mischief slivering down to stretch across his lap.
They headed out to the backyard. Soon enough, Marianne was seated comfortably in a lawn chair transfigured into a cushy recliner and Harry's kids swarmed their cousins eagerly, showing Eddy and Chrissy their new snakes. Of course, Harry spent ten minutes reassuring Dudley and his wife that the snakes were not poisonous and that the kids had them under complete control.
Teddy and his coconspirators were basking in the glow of their voctory. They fairly shined with happiness every time they caught their fathers looking at each other in the way that James dubbed "moony-eyed". Of course, despite his teasing, James really didn't mind all that much either.
Dudley and Marianne were silent for a long moment before Dudley met Harry's gaze. "How would I go about enrolling them in magic school?"
"Dueling Club second year wasn't actually the first time I'd ever talked to a snake," Harry said grinning at the assembly in front of him. Seeing the complete lack of negative reaction on the Malfoys and the eager smiles of his kids made him feel a whole lot better about their secret being revealed.
Taken aback, Lucius stared at her for a moment before he found his voice. "Thank you, Lily. I'm quite... fond of you as well."
Taken aback by his forwardness, it took Draco a moment to answer without sounding affronted. Surely this redhead realized that he and Harry were in a relationship.
"So, you did." The older man smirked and leaned back in his deep brown leather chair, his fingers pressed together in front of him. "Then may I inquire as to the purpose of this meeting? I do not believe you are an Auror any longer and I have nothing to hide in any case."
"Wow. Mr. Malfoy actually went to Azkaban," James breathed, not sure if he was impressed or terrified at the thought.
She reared back looking affronted. “
"No, sweetheart," he assured her.
Harry did the same, turning to the doorway just as Luna skipped in, dreamy eyes scanning the decore with interest, her necklace of butterbeer corks and radish earrings firmly in place. They didn't really look out of place when paired with her sunshine yellow robes printed with large daisies.
"Come along, then, Hermione," she ushered as the girl stood up as well, followed closely by Draco. "You're in no condition to be going anywhere and I'm sure your husband and children aren't much better. I'll show you to a guest suite then Draco will send Ronald up to you."
Draco grinned, happy for the distraction. "I know, isn't it? I had it remodeled after I kicked Astoria out. She had it fucking pink, for God's sake." He scrunched his nose in remembered distaste and climbed under the covers.
At least Harry had the presence of mind to put it somewhere out of sight. The last thing he needed was to be asked a bunch of questions that their children didn't need the answers to just quite yet.
Chrysanthemum Dursley was a very sweet, lovely child. Just a few months younger than Lily the two girls got along rather well. Chrissy was smart like her mother and fierce enough to hold her own against her older more pushy brother. Harry was really rather fond of her.
"Your grandfather let other Death Eaters stay here?" Teddy asked in disbelief.
Narcissa watched the children stuff their faces with a distracted furrow between her brows as she sipped her tea and nibbled delicately at a tea cookie.
His wife just hummed contentedly a smile in her voice. "Goodnight, my love."
Lily hummed tiredly. “
He lifted his hand and looked at the healing pink scar on his index finger from where the garden gnome had scored a lucky bite. Draco had healed it for him with a special potion he'd made. And Draco had made cookies that day too and always hugged them all when he saw them.
She had a hand pressed to her heart and had to almost visibly shake herself from her thoughts before she was able to nod "Yes, dear. I'm sorry, it's just the last time I heard that was when
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
"Yeah, well, he'd know, wouldn't he? He's an Auror," he defended.
Slipping his second sapphire cufflink into the cuffs of his dress shirt, Lucius shrugged on his midnight blue business robes and smoothed out the wrinkles with his hands. He picked up his cane on his way to the bedroom door and dropped a light kiss on the top of his wife's perfectly arranged head.
"Weasley's said something in Parseltongue?" Draco asked, intrigued.
"What?" Harry stared at his friend in disbelief.
When he did realize Dudley and his wife were looking just a wee bit panicked he grimaced apologetically. "It'll be alright, Dudley. If they go to Hogwarts, they'll be there with my kids and the Weasleys. They won't be alone. You have plenty of time to prepare for it."
"Fix us some tea then return to your regular duties," he ordered then turned to find Potter had planted his forehead on the table and was rocking it back and forth miserably as his arms hung loosely at his sides.
"Is something wrong?" Harry asked
Once they arrived home, Harry extracted promises of loyalty and allegiance from every single snake. They were eager to agree and Harry was able to get a feel for what kind of trouble he'd just gotten himself into.
Harry shook his head and nearly laughed at the look of relief that washed over Lucius's face before he wiped it off again. "I had all three at one time. But now..." he trailed off and shrugged nonchalantly.
"He's not like he used to be, Ron," Harry protested.
Harry raised an eyebrow at the dreamy sound of his cousin’s voice. "Did you get Marianne pregnant again, Dudley?"
It was nearly a week until Teddy's birthday party and Draco was trying to keep his mother from throwing the poor boy a formal ball and inviting half the population of Great Britain.
Shortly after the plates had been cleared away, spelled to clean themselves in the sink, and the strudel brought out and served, there was a disturbance in the vicinity of Lily and Hugo.
It couldn't continue on like this, he knew. They needed to be independent, fearless children again and it seemed that for that one day, at the Manor with Draco, Scorpius, Narcissa, and yes, even Lucius, they had been just that. They'd simply been children again.
They read dry passage after dry passage, monotonous entry after monotonous entry and still learned nothing they didn't already know or that didn't have anything to do with what they were looking for.
Because she hadn’t spoken to her older sister since she’d left Hogwarts.
"I'm- I'm sorry, about what I said, you know," he mumbled, face turning red, unable to meet his father's eyes. "I know Mum leaving wasn't really your fault. And I know that you- that you want us," he said sounding more hopeful than sure.
Harry grinned at him then tilted his head back and relaxed. It was late afternoon and soon the sun would start to set. Already a specter of the moon was low in the sky. The breeze was pleasant and the temperature comfortable.  It had been a nice day.
"I remember when my Bill started his first year at Hogwarts." Molly smiled absently as she looked off into the field watching her grandchildren and one extra Malfoy blond head running and playing. "He had his heart set on this one broom. Good lord, it was so long ago I can't even remember what it was called, but he was so excited when he opened it up, I could have cried."
Turning in his seat to give the child his full attention, Draco placed his hands in his lap and asked very politely, "What can I do for you, sweetheart?"
Peeking out from behind his father, James studied the oldest Malfoy for moment before he nodded decisively. "Yes, sir."
“Thank you for coming, Draco dear,” Molly whispered into Draco’s ear as she gave him a tight squeeze ever mindful of his little girl burden. “And thank you for taking care of Harry and the kids. It’s easy to see just how happy you make them.”
Draco chuckled and bent down to lift her into his arms. "I know, Lily-flower, but it's past your bedtime."
The children all traded surprised looks before he called for attention once more.
Lucius blinked in surprised for a split second then turned his steel gray gaze on Teddy. He stared at the boy unblinkingly for a long moment, watching the poor boy fidget and wipe his sweaty palms on his jeans.
Nearly all of the Weasleys were milling around their gardens now, the children chasing each other through the garden and bouncing off the wards. Lucius looked downright overwhelmed by the sheer amount of red hair around him and Narcissa was getting along famously with Molly and Fleur. Which was either a good indication of future family gatherings or a sign of the apocalypse. Could go either way.
"Sounds bloody boring to me," Ron grumbled back as he lifted the lid on a huge pot on the stove and stirred the contents with a giant wooden spoon.
Harry looked like he was thinking seriously through something. Hesitantly, he began to speak. "You know, if we stay together, if this works out, Teddy, and James, and Albus, and Lily will kind of be your kids, too. Like Scorpius will kind of be mine."
Despite Andromeda’s assurance he still felt the heavy weight of guilt in his chest.
He smiled back thankful for her calm acceptance.
Draco had never been more in love.
Harry marveled at how level his voice was. It was old news to Draco, his pain and anger had long since faded. Harry couldn't feel that unconcerned though. The thought that Draco’s wife, Scorpius’s mother, could be like that was enraging.
"There. Much better, wouldn't you say? Now, what’s your name, starfish?" he asked with a charming smile as he slipped the snotty handkerchief back into a pocket.
Soon, Shotzy popped up next to Draco just as he was shoving a stuffed mushroom into his mouth. "Master Draco, Master Harry has arrived with Masters Scorpius, Teddy, James, Albus, Mistress Lily, and two redheads."
Narcissa cleared her throat and set down her napkin next to her empty plate. "Are you going to write the Headmistress, Harry?"
Lily gave another great sob that shook her little body and made Harry scared she was going to hyperventilate. "I don't want you to go, either!" she confessed tears still soaking his neck and shoulder. "Please don't leave too."
"So those are the muggles you didn't tell me were going to be in my home," Lucius drawled, suddenly appearing next to him.
A beautiful smile broke over Harry's face and Draco was thankful that he'd witnessed it.
"It doesn't matter!” she snarled at him. “You still took my grandson to the house of former Death Eaters, and continued to put him in danger without even thinking about what I might have to say on the matter! Do you even know what they would have done to him during the war just because of what his father was?"
Harry just looked at her in surprised confusion. Ron was supposed to be the loud naysayer, she was supposed to be the voice of reason.
"No, of course not, dear," Narcissa cut him off with a dismissive wave. "I did not pack them wine. I simply picked out a few jars of your more popular salves and rubs and maybe a package or two of your tea cookies."
"You are beautiful," Harry murmured against Draco's salty skin. "Amazing."
Harry just chuckled and shook his head. "Sorry, James. It's time to go. Put up the game and let's head downstairs," he instructed. "Who was winning anyway?"
Harry had no time to take exception to being ordered around in his own home. He could only blink bemusedly at Malfoy as he steam rolled through his home like a freight train.
Harry felt like he'd been slapped. "How could you know that? How did you see it when I, her husband, didn’t?"
"Mum?" Draco felt somewhat wary of her mysteriously one track mind.
Ron raised an eyebrow at him. "You're sleeping with him aren't you?"
"It's alright, Lily," Teddy soothed, wrapping his arms around her and squeezing comfortingly. "We'll think of something. It'll be alright."
She chuckled delightedly. "You are a handsome young man," she said, pleased when his blush darkened a shade or two. "And so well mannered, too."
Draco thought about that for a moment. "So, you're saying wizards could actually learn to be Parselmouths?"
Sometime in the night, Draco had rolled to Harry's side of the bed and sprawled out over him laying his head on Harry's shoulder and flinging a leg over his thighs.
"I'm alright, Harry," Teddy responded quietly as he turned around and buried his face in Harry's stomach for a moment. "I'm gonna go to my room now," he mumbled, stepping back. Then he bolted for the door.
By now he would have had the tree decorated as soon as the start of the month, but this is something he loves to do with Teddy. So he leaves it for last. The rest of the house, though, is already decorated to the gills.
“No,” Harry says. “No, no, no.
"This is one of my favorites," Draco explains, stunned because he wasn't sure he would ever see this in person. "I read a lot about it during my studies. It's an allegory about love and loss. The candy pile represents the artists' partner who passed away from AIDS. You can touch this one, it's encouraged even to take some of the candy. It starts off weighing the exact weight as their partner and the shrinking pile represents the eventual loss of life.”
“I have always wanted you even if I lied to myself about it,” Draco adds, quietly. He opens his eyes and Harry is watching him, patiently. “I was so afraid.”
“We could start again,” Blaise says and smiles.
They take off and drive and he doesn’t look back. When he looks to his left he sees Hermione driving next to him, her hair blowing in the wind and a determined look on her face. They’ll drive until sundown and rest. He’s unsure of what they will find across the salt, and a part of him is afraid. He looks ahead and sees nothing. Just a bleak horizon.
“Draco, son of Narcissa Black, clan member of Swaddle Dog and my Initiate son,” Minerva says. Her robes full of patches, belts and other trinkets clink as she steps closer to Draco and puts her hand on the one holding the knife to Draco’s throat.
“Well, invitations were sent out earlier this year and we’ve been working with the commissioners and artists on their works. Mind you, there’s still a lot to be done. I’m due back in Venice later this week to present our curatorial statement. To the muggle board of directors, if you will.”
“I know,” Harry says, “But I’m willing to take that chance now.”
” Harry moans breathlessly, “God,
“Look out!” Pansy shouts and Draco looks up to see jagged rocks straight ahead. He pulls the spanner to the right, but it’s too late. The impact slams Draco into Potter as the Rig hits the rocks. He has a brief moment of horrible sheer panic as it dawns on him that Ginny was still outside. He looks back and doesn’t see her. The door is knocked loose and hanging off its hinges. He stands again and looks out from the roof. There's a cloud of smoke and fire back at the rocks and as it clears, Draco sees the upturned undercarriage of Lucius' vehicle and the guzzoline pod going up in flames.
He takes one final look around before he turns his back. A second later, the sound of bike engines roar everywhere and Draco’s surrounded. The first Rock Rider appears at the top, over a ridge.
“Always knew you’d be good at sucking cock,” Draco moans and Harry feels hot all over. He opens his eyes and looks at Draco, eyes going hot when he sees the blush blooming on his chest going up to his neck and the way his lips quiver. Beautiful. Then Draco meets his eyes and Harry moans, mouth full.
They could make it out of this alive and without spilling a single ounce of blood, if they just stay still and keep quiet. Easier said than done, though. The one in front of Draco trots past him, smelling the air and starts to growl, the noise rippling from its chest, deep and hollow.
“There,” Ginny then says, standing, and Draco looks down at his leg. “I was able to stop the bleeding. And at least it won’t get infected... as far as that kind of thing goes around out here,” she quickly adds and smirks. The wound isn’t completely closed but it’s close enough and Draco feels loads better. He eyes the claw marks that had torn his skin. She whispers words that he doesn’t understand, a language that she and the others learned in the books Miss Sybill kept.
“Not you,” the blood bag says, voice low. He then aims at Luna. “Her.”
“Water,” Draco also says at the same time.
“Flying helps too. I finally got around to finishing fixing Sirius’ bike.”
series. It's a portrait of a woman wrapped in a dress full of constellations. They dim and glow in time and the stars behind her twirl bright. The fabric of her dress flows in the wind. The thin moon crescent behind her also glows brightly.
Later, Draco feels himself on the tether of falling asleep. Harry lazily runs his fingers up and down his back.
“Come on. Grab some of those treats we made such a fuss about,” Blaise says and leads him back out to the living room.
There’s a pause and Blaise frowns. “We’re all that’s left.”
“I haven’t felt that feeling ever since...” Harry continues. “And you haven’t been over since that day.”
“So we wait.”
Just then, she lifts her other hand and he feels the cold press of the barrel of a gun at the side of his head. There's a loud bang, followed by the ringing in his ears as he falls. He can hear more laughter in the distance. He’s still alive.
“You keep moving. Forward,” Potter simply says like it’s obvious.
Draco sucks Harry’s cock and relaxes his throat to take him the same time his fingers inside Harry
They sit there long after the tears on his face have dried.
At the same time the war boys call out to Draco. Out the window he sees the flares in the sky, far in the distance.
“Merlin,” Draco mutters under his breath. He does not need the mental image in his head of Potter riding that bike. He’s seen it and it’s criminal. Once when Draco was visiting England, Potter had met him and their friends for a night out and had arrived on the bike. Draco pointedly avoided staring at how perfectly Potter straddled the bike, how his tight jeans were, practically bursting at the seams. That night Draco had wanked himself twice until he saw stars.
Draco has a spare moment to really see him this time and finds that he’s easy on the eyes. He’s tall but Draco is taller by a few inches, and he’s got messy brown hair even after his unfortunate haircut with Gertie. There are a few lines on the sides of his head where Gertie went too close with the clippers and he feels like smiling, remembering that there was a time he was foolish enough to get his hair cut by Gertie. Nowadays Luna does the cutting. Still, though, it’s not a bad look and Draco considers it an upgrade. He also notices the impressive scar on the right side of the blood bag’s forehead. Hard lines shaped like a jagged thunderbolt. One scar line goes past his eyebrow and narrowly misses his eye.
They settle in front of the fire and talk while sharing the wine straight from the bottle.
“Go with Harry,” he tells Teddy. His hands still on Teddy’s coat, his mind registering the slip-up, having said Potter’s first name. When he turns, Potter is looking at him, expression expectant and turning soft. Draco's surely blown it now. Luckily Teddy is there and Draco has never been more grateful for his cousin.
Potter extends a hand to Pansy and she takes one more look at Draco and she smiles, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. Draco hates her for it.
Draco watches, body frozen as they snap their jaws, full of teeth and impossibly wide. They make a run towards the Rig. They run on all fours and another low keening cry rips out of their throats again. They come to a stop at the tracks, their snouts pushing against the mud, sniffling loudly.
“The need to protect.”
He hears Luna softly sing behind them. Padma’s head is on her shoulder, fast asleep. They have a lamp light fire going settled between Padma’s legs. Out here in the desert, the night sky is beautiful. Moonlight shines off the sand and glitters like gemstones.
“You sure you don’t want that taken care of?” she asks him, motioning towards the cuts along his arms. They’re not as deep as the ones Draco has, but probably still a bit bothersome.
“You’re right,” Draco says as he fits himself between Harry’s spread legs. He lovingly runs a hand along the underside of Harry’s thighs. “I fucking love it.”
“It bloody hurts, what else would it feel like?” she says.
Draco runs his hand through Phoebe's fur and shakes his head. “Not really, no.”
“I know it’s a little overkill but, well, there’s plenty of food left,” Draco then adds after moments of silence and dread.
“But I’m asking you now, would you?”
Today they’re heading to Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Today they are hauling Aqua Cola and Guzzoline.
Draco can’t help but laugh with him too. That was the thing about Blaise. The boy who he once knew as quiet and serious during the war had managed to also put to rest his grievances. After his mother’s death, Blaise inherited many things including the Zabini estate and the home he now shares with Ginny. He became a fashion designer and tailor and got by with a fine list of clientele, both muggle and wizard. Ginny was still a professional Quidditch player and still playing for the Harpies.
“You’ve got one bullet left,” Pansy tells him.
“Get up,” the voice says again and Draco stands, wincing.
Draco lifts his hand and runs his fingers over the rough fabric of the scarf around his neck. He tunes out the rest of the speech, not caring for another word Lucius has to say. Water falls from the walls of the Citadel, released from the pumps, and he watches as the stragglers go rabid—refugees living outside of the Citadel and displaced from the War with no home to call their own.
“West. The Citadel beyond the mountains.”
“Harry, bedroom, now please,” Draco manages to say and is relieved when Harry finally pulls back. His glasses sit askew on his face and Draco smiles.
“New blood, eh? Heard he’s a real tasty one,” Gertie tells Draco, smiling and motioning towards the chair.
In the morning Draco wakes before his alarm, gets ready, and meets Pansy at Blaises’ home. Ginny and her party would already be at the estate having spent the night prior. The early morning is still brisk from the evening shower prior.
Ginny smiles knowingly and Draco knows that smile. It’s too early in the evening to be the recipient of that smile. Merlin help him.
Then, Blaise comes up behind Ginny in the entryway, and Draco smiles and reaches for his best friend. He hugs Blaise tight, with every fiber of his being and it’s like coming back home after a long weary walk. He then remembers the wine bottle in his hand and offers it to Blaise, a smirk on his face.
“I’ve always been yours,” Harry says, shaking and opening up so beautifully for Draco.
“Don’t blow my engine,” Draco tells Potter when he opens the door and starts moving towards the air intakes atop of the engine. Potter grins back at him.
He takes the wine glass from Blaise. Almost immediately he can smell the robust ripe fruit, subdued by dark cherry and plum, surrounded by violet floral tones. Its rich finish is exactly what he needs.
“You stayed, right?”
Luna nods. “I saw your mother at Gerbert’s just this week picking up some new seeds and a bouquet. She looked well. I think she’s in the middle of planning a redoing of the Manor gardens and fountain terraces. I’m sure she’s going to be so thrilled to see you.”
"That's alright, Harry." Kingsley waved him off. "Take all the time you need, but remember there's always a place for you here at the Ministry." The tall dark man stood from behind his desk and held out his hand.
Immediately, the kids all made loud unintelligible sounds trying to make it seem like someone was losing and someone was winning the game in front of them. They more or less succeeded
"Oh." Ron didn't seem to know how to respond to that. "That makes sense, I guess," he hedged. "At least now I know why they wouldn't ever let you pay for anything."
Teddy loved his grandma, but he yearned for Harry to be more like his dad.
!" the little boy shouted with a bright smile directed at Fleur who smiled back at him momentarily distracted from her scowling.
Lucius was at a loss, but his expression remained impassive.
reading over my shoulder, thank you very much."
Lucius shot Harry a scolding look, like Luna’s eccentricities were entirely his fault, before he followed her out of the sitting room and toward the floo. Harry just sighed, already dreading their lunch and shuffled off behind them.
"Actually," Harry hedged, "I would rather the meeting be with Luna herself. She handles most of the actual business for the
"Nope, I want to see if you all can do magic yourselves." Harry grinned and forged on despite Chrissy's skeptical little frown and Eddy's dubious snort.
Draco stiffened. "Mrs. Weasley knows about us?"
"That sounds perfect, Luna," Harry smiled widely, almost a little gleefully, at her. "Shall we meet you there, then?"
"Where's Hermione at?" Harry asked as he reached over to pluck a slice of cucumber off the top of the salad bowl sitting on the counter.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat a moment before Harry's lips fell on his and suddenly their arms were around one another and all either of them could feel, other than their lips and hands and tongues, was heat and need.
"That's my Grandmama," piped up Scorpius from around the vicinity of Draco's hip.
Draco nodded. "That's understandable. It's extremely rare, and sometimes regarded as Dark magic. Personally, I think anybody who thinks that is completely idiotic."
Lucius didn't say anything, just returned the nod. Harry hadn't even been expecting that much.
Harry took one look at his son's hopeful face and tried to fight down the panic. "I don't know, Mrs. Malfoy. Didn't you say he was dangerous?"
"Harry!" The dark man looked up in surprise. "To what do I owe this visit?" he asked, eyes flitting to each child's morose face then back to their father's.
Lucius glanced at his son a beleaguered look over his shoulder, as he consoled his crying wife patting her on the back. "Now, now, Narcissa. There's no need for these drastic measures. If the plants won’t be pulled then I'll ward them into harmlessness."
, Harry,” Draco protested indignantly. “You can’t hold me accountable for what my immature childish self may have thought necessary. Besides, Professor Snape was a good friend of the family. I’d known him since before I started Hogwarts,” he justified. Then a sneered muttering, “But those Ministry toadies were adults kissing an eleven year-old’s ass. They had no excuse.”
Lily stared at her wide eyed. She'd never heard Belle sound so angry. It made the fact that her mum was gone even more real. Laying her head back down on Draco's shoulder she sighed, partly in sadness and partly in pleasure when he lifted a hand and began combing his fingers through her hair gently.
"Can we call you Uncle Lucius?" Lily asked excitedly with an innocent smile.
"I was, yes. I believe that first task was my favorite," Draco said with a glint in his eye.
"That's what I said, wasn't it?" Harry frowned back. "Yesterday I entered into a business arrangement with him and signed a contract. He explained to me that two copies of the contract were for us, but the third would be sent to the Ministry because apparently they were keeping tabs on him since he’s the only free and pardoned adult Death Eater."
” he said as he studied her burnt orange body and thin black pinstripes.
They didn't find much. One dark wizard on the Malfoy side wrecked mayhem sometime in the fourteenth century, one witch was convicted of human sacrifice in the sixteenth century, and a whole bunch scattered throughout were awarded various metals and honors for services to the Ministry and such.
"No, probably not," Draco answered with a smile and snagged a ripe red strawberry, before shouting, "Scorpius! What have I told you about trying to pluck the peacocks!"
“Nevertheless.” Lucius watched him blandly as several thoughts and emotions passed through him.
Harry straightened in his seat and snapped, "Albus! What exactly are you teaching Scorpius to say?"
"I haven't been around all that much since the Aurors starting sending me on foreign assignments and the Minister started using me as an Ambassador," Harry began to explain. "It took me away for weeks at a time, sometimes for a month all together, and when I was actually home," he trailed off with a shrug. "I didn't realize things had gotten so bad here until I came home a week ago to find that the house was abandoned, the kids had been staying at the Weasleys', and Ginny hadn't been heard from for three weeks."
"Oh dear lord, Lucius," Narcissa breathed and turned fiery blue eyes on her frozen, horrified husband. "Please, tell me that's not who I think it is."
!" He intoned clearly only to grin in satisfaction when the wand spit out a round of emerald sparks.
"Oh, I can from the sounds of it." Harry chuckled and stroked his hands up and down Draco's back. "Has Narcissa been running herself ragged getting ready for this?" he asked, a touch of concern wrinkling at his brow.
"Oh tosh, Draco!" Narcissa interrupted her son's lecture. "I'll do nothing to the boy. He isn't at fault here. I have long since regretted isolating my sister. It was bad enough losing one to insanity. I wish I hadn't lost the other to pride and prejudice. Her grandson is welcome in my home regardless of whether we are on speaking terms or not."
"I don't think there's anything more we can look up with these," Albus said, catching James's hint. "We'll have to wait until we go to Manor and talk to Scorpius."
He returned it and caressed her soft cheeks adoringly. "Goodnight, my dear." They curled up together, the room now dark and quiet. It took them both a long while before they actually slept.
"Potter!" Lucius exclaimed in shock. "Have you no pride for your heritage?" he demanded. "I cannot speak for the Potters, but the Blacks were an extremely proud and tradition orientated family. The heirlooms in these vaults will be positively steeped in magic and history from both families. It is tantimount to an ancestral snubbing for you to be so callously blasé about the heritage and gifts given to you from your ancestors."
"You're Lucius Malfoy," one of his lift companions blurted out quite obnoxiously, he thought.
Harry and Ron sat in silence for a few long moments as the event sank in. Turning to his best friend, Harry couldn't keep the incredulous frown from his face.
Harry smiled and scanned the tapestry for another name. "Ah! Look. Theodore Remus Lupin. It is a complete family tree! No one is blasted off of it," he exclaimed in excitement.
Narcissa had decided to have afternoon tea in the garden today. It was a lovely day, all bright sunshine, great golden fluffy clouds, and a nice April breeze. The only thing that would make it more perfect was if Lucius would abandon his study and come sit with her.
He laughed and squeezed her again before turning to put the kettle back on the stove to brew more tea. "I'm sorry for not coming to see you both. It's just been really hectic lately."
"Does everyone have their snakes? We don't want anyone getting lost,” he asked as they lined up by the door ready to make the trek home. He received three affirmative hisses and one English yes. Rolling his eyes, he pulled the door open and stepped out onto the street.
Only when Harry resumed his place next to him did Draco pull himself away for a moment to smile brightly at his lover before turning back and delving into the mating habits of some obscure Asian breed or other. Harry just shook his had in amusement and began a conversation with Arthur about the newest muggle technology he'd discovered.
The snake sank the rest of the way down with his belly on the ground. It continued looking up at Albus and replied, “
Draco, shrewd man that he was, just grinned at him and nodded. "Yes, they were curious about the story after this afternoon."
"You're named after a flower too!" Chrissy cheered, a grin pulling at her blushing face.
"I know," Draco said soothingly as he stroked the back of her hand with his thumb. "I think it will help if you talk about it with him, though. It will help both of you."
"Louis!" the little boy cheered.
She opened her mouth say something, she hadn’t decided what, but she didn't get a chance.
He nodded and grinned.  "Yeah, we get along pretty great actually. He's really great with the kids, completely natural. Charming, funny, and easier to talk to than I would have ever thought. Even if he can still be snarky and sarcastic when he feels like it." Harry paused suddenly, his enthusiasm melting into a wistful sigh. "And he's gorgeous."
As if on cue all the other children began shuffling guiltily putting on bashful little grins. A couple of them surreptitiously snatched handfuls of the barely touched cookies hiding them in their pockets.
Almost from the moment Scorpius had set eyes on him, he'd wanted to be friends with Albus so badly. It made him so happy now that they were friends it felt like he could burst sometimes. And James and Lily were so cool too.
Slowly turning his head, he caught Hermione's eyes and held them, the warning plainly clear. She didn't open her mouth again, but the sour expression on her face remained.
"Grandma?"
At this, Harry frowned in confusion. "Why is that? I wasn't aware that the Ministry kept tabs on private business arrangements."
"Ah." Draco nodded and smiled at them reassuringly. "Well, don't worry. You'll be able to jump right back to London when the party's over."
Looking out across the beach, Ginny was easy to spot. Her fiery red hair was a blinding beacon against the white sand. Harry slowly trudged through the sand toward her, his Auror robes and long sleeves were hot under the sun, his hair was already sticking to his head in sweat.
They shook hands and Harry gave him a strained smile. "Thanks, Kingsley. I appreciate it."
"Thank you, Draco." Albus blushed then impulsively rushed forward and wrapped Draco's waist up in a quick hug before he darted away again, head ducked and face flaming red. Scorpius couldn't have looked more pleased.
Draco watched him leave the gardens for the floo room and shook his head. This thing with Granger was getting out of hand.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him in a silent request for clarification.
, by definition, and Draco had been surprised to discover that he was one. Malfoy Matris were never only children. That was just how the trait always manifested in the Malfoy family.
"Albus!" Harry snapped, but it was too late. The angry little boy had already shoved away from the table and dashed off the patio disappearing into the crowd.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy! Go right in, the Minister's waiting for you," she told him with a slightly apprehensive smile.
Draco lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder and looked at him understandingly. “I feel the same way, Harry. I think every parent does. But going to school, to Hogwarts is a happy thing. They’ll always be your children, Harry. Teddy will always be your son.” He smiled and shrugged then. “Just maybe a little more grown up than you would like.”
Tal started hissing to Albus again and the little boy frowned in confusion glancing from the closed
"Okay, munchkins." Harry smiled down at them all. "Now, Eddy and Chrissy, you both know that I'm wizard and can do magic, right?"
Draco sighed, teasingly annoyed. "We missed you all, too. Quite a lot, actually,” he admitted, “It seems Potters start to grow on you after a while. Almost like a fungus."
He had failed Ginny and he had failed their kids, but he had long since learned not to repeat his mistakes. Harry wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice not this time.
A shy blush stained her cheeks and she ducked her face mumbling, "You too, Mr. Malfoy."
That left Harry and Andromeda standing in the kitchen, the air thick between them.
Harry had realized two things that day. There was life after Ginny's abandonment, and Draco Malfoy was a vastly different person than he was in school. The first made him feel relieved, and the second made him weirdly fascinated.
The house-elf nodded somewhat unsurely now. “That is what she said, Mistress.”
They stood in silence for a time. Harry thinking about what Draco had told him. Ginny had loved their kids, even if it just wasn’t enough. She still loved them despite her break down and abandonment. Astoria on the other hand sounded like she didn’t care for anything except money and things.
He was almost projecting his younger self and his father. It made Ron distinctly uncomfortable on top of embarrassed by his wife’s rudeness.
"Sure, it worked." James shrugged as he leaned back against the wall where he was seated on the floor next to the bed. "But it didn't work for long. Dad and Draco haven't seen each other since then and we haven't been able to talk to Scor and come up with another plan."
Needless to say he hadn’t felt that guilty in a while.
"He's the one that got you looking like something other than the living dead." Ron nodded in realization, then asked, "He's really changed?"
The sight of him, so different, yet very much the same, had brought back long buried feelings that Draco almost didn’t even remember having. He’d always reluctantly found Harry Potter attractive and now, grown and matured as he was, even more so. Even with tired smudges under his eyes and the lost, confused, pale unhappiness plastered across his face.
Molly sighed sadly as she watched the children play. She supposed they weren't really her Ginny's babies anymore. They were Harry's now since Ginny left them. And Teddy, of course, had always been his godfather's pride and joy.
"You sure did," he assured her as he shot Dudley a meaningful look. Dudley just stared at his daughter with something akin to awe on his face nodding to Harry in understanding.
Harry frowned as he answered. "Ginny didn't even want three. Said she didn't want to have so many kids like her parents." He shook the memories away and focused back on Draco. "Did you want more kids?"
Ron stared at his wife's, his best friend's shaking back completely at a loss. His heart was physically aching and he felt like his throat was so tight that he couldn't breathe, but still he didn't know how to console the woman he loved with all his heart.
Despite these sad recollections, Draco had the ability to give Scorpius more siblings. He'd just chosen not to. He asked himself if it was selfish that he'd held back because he was wary, scared of romance now, but he couldn't come up with a definitive answer.
"What are you little heathens so happy about?" Draco drawled.
Scorpius sniffled a little bit then pulled away with a small nod. "Okay."
Her breath hitched. “I love them, Harry. You know I do.”
Thinking of Scorpius and the four Potter kids reminded him that he'd always wanted more children. He could admit that part of the reason was that he knew just how lonely it had been growing up in the Manor with just his parents and the house-elves for company. He’d longed for siblings to play with.
"Yes, exactly like that."
Turning back to the other visitor in his kitchen, he smiled as she pulled him into a hug. "Good morning, Harry." She smiled and squeezed him.
"No, not complaining." Draco grinned at him as he watched their kids run around the yard shouting happily and playing with their snakes. "Just pointing it out. You do realize that for former enemies we spend an inordinate amount of time together."
"The Triwizard winnings," was his quiet answer.
“Thanks.”
Both women shared a highly entertained look as Lucius wrinkled his nose beleaguered at the very thought.
"Seriously?" Harry blurted out lamely. He hadn't realized that Draco had been waiting nervously on top of him while he spent an inordinate amount of time processing this new revelation.
"No, it was not." Cassiopeia looked him in the eyes, her face unreadable as ever, and harshly beautiful. "The floo trip from the station was most disappointing. It seems that the Manor floo has acquired the habit of spitting soot onto your guests. Fix it."
"Come along, ducklings," he called standing up and nudging the two little boys out of their chairs. "I believe a tour of the stables is the best place to start."
"You're right." James pursed his lips in determination. "I'm sure Draco didn't realize just how horrible Voldemort was when he became a Death Eater. I mean, his dad was in Azkaban so he couldn't very well warn him, could he?" he declared, receiving too enthusiastic nods of agreement from the other kids.
"Did all of you inherit your father's messy hair?" He sighed in playful exasperation when he realized that no matter how many times he tried, the part in her hair was still going to be a crooked zigzag.
Gotta work, gotta work, gotta work! James chanted to himself as he kept his eyes on Teddy's bright purple hair. The plan had to work, because their dad had to be happy again, and Scorpius would be a cool little brother, and Lily wanted a little sister. He just knew it had to work. It just had to work.
Shrugging, Albus shifted uncomfortably, unwilling to discourage his friend. "You didn't really say anything. It sounded kind of like Lily used to when she was baby and couldn’t talk yet."
Harry was distracted from the scene by a hesitant tugging at the hem of his shirt. Glancing down he saw Scorpius with a hand curled in the cloth, cheeks flushed with shyness.
She nodded with a look of determination on her young face. "The spell for red sparks is
Grumbling, Lucius made his way toward the solarium rubbing tenderly at the lump quickly rising on the back of his head.
"Meaning..." Harry hedged hesitantly.
Draco watched the ensuing chaos and sat quietly trying not to attract attention to himself. He felt like a rabbit in a den full of foxes. Unfortunately, his little pocket of peace didn't last for very long and he jumped when a pile of mashed potatoes was dropped onto his plate.
enhanced voice echoed from the opposite side for the Manor. “
"How are Teddy's snakes supplementary?" Hermione asked curiously, her brow creased in thought.
"Nice to see you again, Malfoy." George smiled at him kindly then turned and playfully ruffled Scorpius's hair. "You too, Scor."
Lily situated herself on Narcissa's lap and Draco couldn't help the pang in his chest. His mother loved him and Scorpius to distraction, but she had always wanted a daughter and, failing that, a granddaughter. If things had been different maybe he could have given her one, but then he had married Astoria and that put him off any romantic relationship, male or female, for a long time,.
Harry snorted in agreement and popped a gape in his mouth. "Do I even want to guess at how much money you have?"
Dudley seemed to be reflecting on this and Harry thought, not for the first time, that marrying Marianne really had done wonders for his intelligence.
Harry nodded. He didn't have the energy to even question the fact that Malfoy had a shop. "Well, thanks," he repeated softly, pouring some milk into his tea. "I've been searching for him all afternoon. I don't know what I would have done if he'd-" his voice faltered and he just lifted the cup to his lips and sipped not daring to even finish that thought.
Harry snorted and he looked out the kitchen window to see Teddy directing an ambush on their garden gnome his cousins eagerly hanging off his every word.
Draco's son stepped out from behind his father a bit and stared up at him with hopeful awe. "Really?"
Matris rarely had children into their thirties. Even with their bodies being made to bear children, a pregnancy on a man was always more difficult. It was advised against conceiving past the age of thirty-five. Which was young by magical standards considering that witches could safely carry children all the way into their fifties.
"Sure thing. This is my wife, Angelina," George gestured to the only dark skinned woman in the room. A pretty girl, Draco remembered, that used to be on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Draco shook hands with her and gave her a kind if shaky smile.
Lucius nodded in agreement considering it a compliment.
The Manor was unplottable. No one would be ringing the doorbell if they couldn't find the place to begin with.
They sat down at the table and dug in.
Lowering his head a bit and looking up through his bangs, Harry bit his lip. "So, I should go check them out, then?" he asked needlessly. If Lucius's scolding hadn't convinced him, he would have done it anyway... Eventually, he admitted, grimacing inwardly.
Thirty minutes later the take-away was divided four ways and Harry abandoned the un-salvageable stew pot in the sink.
Marianne asked about Teddy's sudden and frequent appearance changes sounding fascinated. "Can all wizards do that?"
Harry tore his eyes away from the still baffling scene and gave Malfoy a nod. "Good morning, Malfoy. I'm sorry for the short notice."
"I think he was more excited to see the kids than me, Dromeda."
Groaning, Harry laid his head on the table with a heavy thunk. God, he was not looking forward to how the other Weasleys were going to take this.
Of course, he smothered it the moment she turned her highly put out scowl on him. He had no wish to focus his wife's ire on himself. The children held a measure of immunity by age and dearness. He, on the other hand, had no such advantage. After so many years of marriage, a husband learned to be justifiably afraid of his wife.
"I really didn't want that money and as we were getting off of the train I remembered Fred and George and tossed them the whole bag. Told them they could use it to start their business as long as they bought Ron some new dress robes first."
Downstairs in the solarium, Draco, Narcissa, and the children sat on piles of velvety jewel toned pillows covered in gold embroidery and tassels. They were circled around a low table covered in sweets and homemade candies and the conversation was ninety percent laughter.
"Hey!" Harry grinned at his cousin and his family in greeting. "Long time no see, Big D."
Lily shifted and made a sound in her sleep, drawing Draco's attention down to her. He smiled tenderly as he stroked a hand over her hair. She'd crawled up onto the bench with him not long ago and fallen fast a sleep with her head on his lap. It made Draco feel distinctly warm and loved in an entirely different way than Harry did. He loved it all same.
Dudley's eyebrows shot up into his blond hair. "You were actually talking to the bloody snake?" he asked in disbelief. "Can all you wizards do that?
"I'm glad the kids are taking this so well." Draco turned his eyes up to see Harry's reaction.
Draco made him smile and laugh, though. He made Harry’s face light up and his eyes wrinkle when he smiled.
It was different with James, Albus, and Lily, though. He didn't resent them for having to share Harry's attention. They were like his siblings and they loved him like he loved them. Now, that he would be able to visit Harry and his cousins whenever he wanted that ache like something was missing had almost completely gone away.
The older boy just grinned, his hair turning dishwater blue and his eyes bright green. "You are the pretty blond boy with the horses and the ducks, aren't you?" he asked mischievously earning himself an elbow in the ribs from his furiously blushing cousin.
"Yes, James!" she hissed snappishly back at him. "I know what to do."
"Yes, Ma'am." He nodded warily. "I killed him."
Draco smiled to himself and sipped at his tea -
“I’m not necessarily worried about Teddy actually going to Hogwarts. I’m more… anxious about him growing up.” Harry shifted so that he could look into Draco’s warm gray eyes. “I don’t think I’m really ready for my kids to grow up and leave home. I keep remembering Teddy when he was a baby and his hair was puke green the entire time he was teething, or how James would just run headlong into a wall while he was learning to walk because he hadn’t gotten the hang of stopping yet.” He chuckled fondly at the memory.
All the children mulled that over for a time then James made an inquiring sound. "So, if Miss Cissy is Teddy's great-aunt, does that make you his great-uncle?"
Draco's breath caught in his throat when Harry curled his fingers gently tilting his head to just the right angle as he leaned in.
"Nothing." Harry shrugged. "Lily's snake stowed away when we left this afternoon then made a getaway. Lily chased after her and finally caught up with silly thing right outside your shop. The kids wanted to come in, so we did," he obliviously explained the simple story.
A still green haired Teddy crouched behind a boxwood Pegasus listening to his companions periodically shouting in surprise and dashing off to avoid James. It was nice here at Malfoy Manor, he thought. Draco was cool and Mrs. Malfoy was nice, if a little bit odd.
Harry turned to look at him wide eyed and shook his head in disbelief. "Yeah, over horrid mother-in-laws and catty wives."
"Well, how much could it take?" James huffed. "All the times we got to go to the Manor, Dad and Draco always sat and talked together. They were always laughing and smiling."
It took them the better part of fifteen minutes to gingerly place every single book into the small velvet bag, but when they were done it looked like it held a single thin book and didn't weigh much more. Lucius raised his eyebrow at the impressed expression Harry was shooting the bag causing him to blush again.
"I think we should get Draco and Daddy to fall in love," Lily announced suddenly. The boys all looked at her incredulously, but she continued undaunted.
"Believe it, Lily," Albus shot back bluntly. "Dad didn't deny that the Malfoys were Death Eaters and it says it right here that he was caught red-handed at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries."
"Ready?" he breathed, voice deep and rough with the effort of holding back.
Humming, Draco met his expression with an unconcerned smile on his lips. "I'm sure they've just eaten all the cookies."
"And back in those days Harry and I were horrible rivals. We hated each other," Draco told them as the children's giggles over Snape disarming Lockhart so humiliatingly subsided. "It was no secret just how much we disliked one another, so naturally Snape had to pair us together for the disarming practice."
"In that case, Mr. Potter, I will be glad to accompany you," Lucius said with a formal nod of the head.
"Scorpius!" Draco called raising his voice to carry in the monstrous wizard’s space that was the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. "It's time to go, kid."
Draco heard an angry huff from Hermione and glanced over to see that she was glaring at him pointedly, as if she really thought that his and Harry's past animosity would truly make a difference.
"Mm," Lucius agreed, then lifted his finger and pointed to a diamond and the platinum stitched name beneath it. "Draco Lucius Malfoy and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy." He tapped the star beneath it.
Harry just laughed heartily and leaned against the wall where the phone was hung, his fingers twirling the long curled cord absently. "Sure I do, Dud. You only use the phone because you're bloody afraid of owls."
Teddy glanced around him with a serious expression on his young face. He looked at Harry who was smiling proudly at him and at Draco who was holding Harry's hand and watching him with a pleased grin on his face. He looked at James and Albus and Scorpius and Lily remembering their scheming and their adventures and their hopes for the future of their family.
"Why do you say that?" he asked, perplexed and curious. He had never thought that Andromeda had anything against Ginny. The woman didn't seem to have a problem with any of the rest of the Weasleys.
"But I want to stay!" Lily exclaimed pouting.
” Lily explained sadly.
"I think we should do it," he declared not realizing he'd spoken until he heard his own voice.
was staying at the Manor. It brought everything back for a moment."
"Potter, let me reintroduce my parents," Draco said and nodded toward the head of the table where Lucius sat with Narcissa at his left.
"I need you to clarify the whole bloody thing!" the Minister said, scowling. "Someone in my Ministry is illegally requesting financial and business information from Lucius Malfoy?"
Narcissa chuckled and waved dismissively. "I hardly think there will be any suffering going on, darling."
"Oh. No! He's not my son," Harry quickly corrected. "Teddy's my godson. His father had been one of my father's best friends," he explained. "And his mother had been a good friend of mine. He was born in the middle of the war and they asked me to be his godfather. Both of them died in the war," he finished, voice turning low and solemn.
He holds Draco close and shifts so that his face is in the crook of Draco’s neck. Harry is grateful that Draco doesn’t ever ask him to stay, knows him far too well that being at the Citadel for too long doesn’t sit well with him. The idea of finally having a place to call home is appealing but sooner or later his mind convinces him that he doesn’t deserve it. Still, Draco is always there to welcome him home each time. And knowing that he has Draco to come back to helps sooth the furious cold whispers that dwell in the back of his mind.
“How does it feel?” he asks Ginny, looking down at her calf where a trail of blood has started to fall.
“After you left, I felt this sense of calmness and happiness. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s true. That night the house felt complete. It went away the following morning. Ever since then it’s gone back to its normal feeling: hollow and depressing. I know it’s not Pansy because she’s been over at my house loads of times ever since then.”
The first time they fucked, Harry insisted on being on his back even though he was dying to get on his knees for Draco. But there was something about showing the tattoo on his back, the words put there against his will, that kept him from doing so. One could even say he was self-conscious. When Draco had reached for Harry’s shirt, slowly hiking it up his chest, he started trembling. Then he remembered that Draco also has his own scars and brands, also put there against his will and forever a daily reminder of darker days.
“You’re not going to splinch yourself getting home tonight, are you?” Pansy asks out of nowhere.
It’s over in seconds, just as quickly as it started, with Draco pinned face down in the sand. The blood bag takes the gun and lets out three warning shots, all around Draco’s head before he feels the barrel of the gun push hard against the back of his skull. He closes his eyes and feels the fight leave his body.
They are now taller than Draco and wear long robes, full of patches of frizzled and flayed fabric. The collar of their robes are double lined with fur and Draco reaches out and runs his fingers through it.
Pulled back to his thoughts, Draco takes the bottle anyway, “Come now, more firewhiskey won’t kill us. I’ll make us something better.”
Recovery for Draco is long and hard but Harry has all the patience in the world to endure the good days and the hard ones with him. They mourn the Many Mothers who didn’t make it and focus on preserving what’s left. There’s a sadness in Draco’s eyes when he learns that Minerva and Pomona died in the Rig. Harry knows all too well the way grief starts to swallow you until you’re bleak and empty. He doesn’t want that for Draco.
Of course it’s the war boy with the blood bag but he’s no longer at the front perch. The lancer is nowhere to be seen. Draco reaches for the gun holstered under the dashboard. He considers killing the blood bag first, to put him out of his misery but falters at the last second and he doesn’t know exactly why. Instead he aims at the window once, twice until the window breaks and then the war boy has his hands around his neck, fingers covered in blood. The car swerves away and gets enveloped in dust. As Draco switches gears and accelerates, he allows himself a moment of repose, finally focusing on the open expanse ahead.
“After Sirius’ death, the Order started using it less and less, instead deciding to meet at the Burrow. I hated being in there. I felt like I was missing something all the time like something was taken from me too soon. But I could feel the house if that makes sense? I could sense a broken feeling and that it needed someone. So I stayed and renovated it.”
He feels giddy and only half embarrassed. Talking about Potter was always easy with her.
He keeps his hands to himself while Draco fingers himself open. He loves the way Draco sighs at the first touch, brows knitting and mouth falling open in a silent moan when he finds that sweet spot. Sweat beads down his chest and Harry licks his lips.
Draco lifts his arm from over his eyes and blinks, eyes adjusting. He sees Potter standing next to him, blocking the sun. He’s looking down at Draco with a calm expression.
Draco tries to remember but the truth was, he barely remembered that night. “I don’t know if I do? I can barely remember that night with all the drinking.”
Draco is used to the pity and the murmurs of sympathies, but what he sees in Potter’s eyes is understanding. He shrugs. “It’s not so bad. I can’t literally run away anymore, but I’ve found other ways to leave.”
“Breakfast this morning will be a minute,” he says instead. “Would you like some toast?”
“Draco.”
Draco’s impressed, really, he thinks to himself, that the blood bag has survived this far. As he approaches them, Draco notices that he’s got a gun pointed at them and that it’s a dead war boy over his shoulders. He drops the body, the metal chains clinking together; he’s still handcuffed to the body. For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare at one another. Goosebumps tingle under the sweat on his neck. Draco feels like prey, trapped in a gaze that he can only describe as bitter. He makes a show to toss the wrench in his hand to the sand and slowly lifts his hands up.
“Do you have an idea who your secret admirer is?” He asked curiously.
Draco fell to the ground with a loud scream of pain. He curled up on the ground while crying out. It felt like all his nerves were on fire.
She sat down on the coach and got herself some morning tea while watching Draco play with his toy.
It was dark. Only the candle night held them company. The birds weren’t singing. They slept on this cold early January night.
Hermione gave him a strange look. “I know, Harry.”
The cup fell on the table, not even broken. The contents however spread quickly. The table became wet and Lucius his meal too.
His mother is already standing there, smiling and walking up towards him. Before Draco can say something, his mother gave him a bone-crashing hug. He stays in the hug for awhile, enjoying the warmth and safety of his mother. Eventually they pull apart.
Harry walked over to Malfoy and sat on the bed next to Malfoy’s bed. “No, you didn’t deserve any of that,” Harry said matter of factly.
She did not notice Marty cleaning the damage with a silent spell and she did not notice when her eyes started to close.
She changed into her nightgown and got into bed. A cup of tea would be wonderful right now. Not a moment later, a house elf appeared with a steaming cup of tea. She thanked the elf politely and took the cup.
He crouched down beside Malfoy.
Draco chuckled. “Challenge accepted.”
“Where is your husband?”
Narcissa had smiled at the boy with the long blond hair. She knew him. Of course she did. Who didn’t know the son of the Malfoy’s? The Malfoy’s were one of the wealthiest pureblood families, along with the Black’s.
After a while Malfoy excused himself to go to the bathroom. Harry immediately felt a bit alone, without Malfoy’s presence. Somehing about the blonde’s company was very soothing and relaxed. Harry sighed and went on with his assignment. Harry noticed that due to Malfoy’s explaining, he could actually do some of the questions on his own.
“Mommy is okay. I just took a little nap,” she spoke, wanting to reassure him.
“No problem.”
Harry broke from his thoughts again, looking at Malfoy who in return looked at him questionably.
Draco smiled. “Thank you, mother,” he said his goodbyes and gave his mother a last hug. He then made his way to the library.
“Because I like you too!” Harry says smiling wider.
It all seemed to go fast. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Malfoys friends seemed to start insulting the young blonde. Harry raised an eyebrow as he saw how Malfoy’s eyes began to water, eventually tears spilling down his cheeks.
Something was bothering Harry this evening, though he couldn’t find out what exactly. Until he remembered. The bloody fucking potion homework. He had to turn it in tomorrow morning or he would definitely get a bad mark and detention.
“What?”
‘I’m completely alone, Potter. I don’t think I can. Especially after what just happened,’ Malfoy says sadly.
“Ehh..,” Draco didn’t know what to say. “How much I hate muggles?” He desperately hoped to please his father who was watching him carefully.
(Dear mother,
Draco couldn’t keep his curiousity in him anymore. He snatched the paper from Blaise and read it over. He frowned.
‘You ofcourse!’ Draco tugged at Harry’s arm a bit.
“One last push! He is almost here!”
“It is Draco, please answer me”
‘Oh.’
Narcissa wasn’t oblivious. But love makes you blind.
Harry looked over and had to hold in a gasp. Harry’s arms were over Malfoy’s waist, hugging the blonde close to himself. Malfoy had his head buried in Harry’s chest.
Hermione had a look of sympathy on her face. “Poor Malfoy. I can’t believe people are still bullying. I thought we left that nonsense behind in the war. Is he doing okay?”
Harry smiled. “Yeah, it fits you.”
Pansy grabs the Daily Prophet and scans the article over. Her eyes widened and a smug smirk took over her face. ‘No actually way,’ she grinned.
‘I mean, yes. But..,’
My little boy is extremely happy with his dragon toy. He hasn’t let it go since unpacking it. Thank you so much for this product. It makes me happy to see him happy.
‘Yes?’
“Mother, I’ve missed you.”
I’m so sorry this took ages! I had a lot of tests at school so I was busy! Sorry!
There are no clues on why the blonde has left the dorm so Harry grabs his maurauder map. He whispers the spell and the map of Hogwarts appaers. He immediately starts looking for signs of Draco. He spots two Ravenclaws on the astronomy towers and a group of Hufflepuffs sneaking around the fifth floor. Looking further, he finally finds Draco’s dot. In the kitchens..
All the eyes were on him, wondering if the chocolates were any good. They weren’t. Harry spitted it out, coughing as he did so. Ron handed him a glass of water which he gratefully took. Man, that was absolutely disgusting. He wasn’t sure if he had ever tasted anything worser than that in his life.
‘Stop right there, Malfoy. You have never wanted to do these things you did. Your father manipulated you into this mess. They gave you no choice. I could see it. Your heart was never into the things you did. Your heart was in those cookies though, and all those other attemps to make things right. The real you is coming out,’ Harry finishes in one breath. ‘Don’t torture yourself over things you never had control over.’
”Sorry but no.”
Smiling, Draco stood up. “Sure, mom!”
“Oh that is amazing! I’m so glad!” Hermione said, feeling excited for her friend. She always knew that these two would make great friends, if not more. The sexual tension between those two were so strong always.
Lucius turned around, fire shining in his mercury eyes. “Mother is never right. I am the one who is always right. We are getting rid of the stupid thing and you will keep your stupid mouth shut about it!”
Only a few times does he allow himself to look at Potter, startled because he's already looking at Draco, expression soft and serene. He knows he shouldn’t stare, not when this many people are watching them. Potter looks incredible, wearing a deep charcoal muggle suit and long elegant robes that compliment his brown skin perfectly. His wild curls are somehow flawlessly tamed. Draco remembers how it felt to run his hand through that hair.
It doesn’t take long to catch up to the Rig, not after the kill switches have kicked in and the engine sputters, the Rig coming to a complete stop. Draco smiles, unable to hold back the smug look he throws the blood bag as he walks up to the door.
He feels for the water hose, clutches it tight and swings hard and it hits the blood bag square in the head. Draco feels his control start to subside, his patience stretched thin ready to snap. It’s like they’re continuing their fight back at the Citadel with no interruptions this time. Fighting again for control like this brings back vivid memories of when Lucius made Draco and other war boys fight for sport. No rules. Just your bare hands, the hard planes of sand, and the single instinct of winning pumping through your veins. His fight with the blood bag goes on like this with a push that turns into a pull—a fight that never ends. It's almost like a dance as if they’re equals.
“No,” Harry replies. “It’s still hard to get used to this. I feel like I’m going to fall through at any moment.”
“It’s okay,” he says when Pansy moves to go after Ginny. He sits back on his legs, and catches his breath as they watch the blood bag drive away in the Rig.
The Rock Riders live in the Canyons, a bandit clan, having settled to the far east of the Citadel. Normally crossing into their territory is forbidden and considered trespassing, but desperate measures called for Draco to sneak out one night many moons ago to make a deal. He’s broken from his thoughts as they get closer, and he lets his doubts roll off his back. He covers his forehead in grease and oil; the markings of higher ranking officers from the Citadel, and turns back and looks at the others.
He lifts his hand with the need to run his finger over the faded patch, but pulls back almost immediately when Potter violently jerks back. There’s a wild look in his eyes and Draco keeps still.
“You need to take the War Rig up on higher ground away from the mud.” Potter says, turning to face him. “I’ll go. Buy you some time.”
Draco had been away on a supply run to Gas Town when it happened. When he got back to the Citadel it was all everyone could talk about. An ambush on Bellatrix and her Death Eaters. She liked doing her own patrols, loved to hunt and no one was foolish enough to stop her. Gertie had told Draco that no one had survived except Bellatrix. She lost an eye and twelve men that day.
“God,
Arthur Weasley walks her down the aisle with grace. Draco watches the way Blaise and Ginny look at each other, grinning like they’re sharing an inside joke.
“Stay down and out of sight,” Draco shouts over the noise and drives the Rig forward, pressing down hard on the gas. In the rear mirror he can start to make out the war parties in the distance. “We’re about to drive into a storm.”
“You decrepit berk, that was one of my expensive ones,” She hisses and slaps his hand away. She eyes the butt of the cigarette and sighs. “Come on, let’s wake up Blaise.”
He then realizes that Potter’s looking at him again with that crooked smile and Draco realizes he’s been staring. He has to look away, feeling his face go hot. He clears his throat and motions toward the adjoining room. “Shall we?”
Some seconds pass before Harry turns and Draco moves so that he’s on his back and he looks up at Harry with a smile, sleepy and so beautiful. He tips his chin up and Harry can’t help himself, leans over and catches Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Kissing Draco will always feel like the first time: soft, warm and intoxicating. Draco makes a soft sound when his tongue touches his. Harry moves his hands so that he’s undoing the ties that keep his shirt closed.
Harry reaches for Draco and pulls him on top, spreading his legs and hisses when their cocks touch. Harry’s hands slide between them and he wraps a slick hand around their pricks. Draco bucks under his touch. Those hands and wandless magic, they’ll ruin him.
After the war, there was chaos trying to round up the last remaining Death Eaters who fled to the south and east. It wasn’t easy. Pansy mentioned that the Auror numbers dwindled during the raids. Potter had lost a partner. And eventually, Potter had been removed from the active field and promoted to Head of the Aurors which... did not come without its cost. Office life wasn’t for everyone most especially for him. Not for Potter who had spent most of his life right in the middle of it.
Once they’re in the storm it gets dark and the only light he can see are the flashes of lightning illuminating their path.
For dinner, Draco settles on serving beef stroganoff over buttered noodles that he prepares with small help from Teddy. Potter, wanting to make himself useful, goes about setting the dining table.  It should feel weird, but instead, Draco finds it comforting and familiar. It's not different than all the other times he ran into Potter whether at his aunt Andromeda’s home or at their friends’ homes. He’s content to let his mother ask all the questions during dinner, curious to know what Potter’s been up to. He's not ready to find out that Potter's been doing work at the Manor.
Harry isn’t afraid of heights he’s just not used to them. He feels uneasy being at the top of the Citadel. Despite how lovely everything looks from up there and how much he feels at home surrounded by the crops and plants. As long as Luna or Draco is up there with him, Harry doesn’t panic as much, doesn’t feel this fleeting feeling of being in free fall.
“Out here everything hurts,” Draco says, smiling when she laughs. It doesn’t quite reach her eyes. She then gets up and softly cards her fingers through his hair before she walks towards Potter.
to please Draco. And Draco’s smile makes his heart soar. He lets go and gives his control and everything to Draco, knows that his heart and soul are safe with him, always.
“You could have died,” Draco says, sagging in relief.
“Padma...” Ginny says, voice shaking and laced with fear. She looks pale. “She’s on the other side.”
On the morning of Christmas Eve, Draco wakes up to find the streets peppered with snow. He makes an early start, already with a hot cup of tea, and puts on his apron, preparing to get to work. He’s setting the breakfast casserole in the oven when Potter comes through the kitchen, stifling a yawn, and looking gorgeous that he almost burns his hand closing the oven door.
“One man, one bullet,” Pomona says when one pursuit vehicle comes up to the right side of the Rig.
In the Turbine Hall, they walk around a large fountain installation piece. A museum tour guide is also taking a group of visitors around the fountain. They listen along and Draco explains in hushed tones the heavy historical and cultural references.
“Why can’t you stop? What have you done?” he shouts when Draco says nothing. His grip on Draco’s throat is tight and it makes him choke, but he keeps himself grounded and throws a punch to Ace’s face instead, his knuckles coming back full of blood. He narrowly has time to duck before the war boy driving next to the Rig shoots at him.
He leans forward and Potter’s eyes widen just a little before Draco closes his eyes and presses his forehead against Potter’s. It’s the barest of touches. He lifts a hand and rests it over Potter’s heart. He smiles to himself when he feels the beating heart, feeling the heat of his skin through his henley. He doesn’t suppress the shiver when he feels a hand settle on the back of his neck. Draco leans into his touch and lets out a shaky breath when fingertips slide over the raised skin at the back of his neck: the brand of the Citadel. Potter turns so that Draco feels his lips softly brush over Potter’s forehead, his hair so soft against Draco’s jaw. He opens his eyes and stares out into the planes. His own heart thrums against his ribcage to a beat that matches Potter’s own heart, pulsing under his fingers.
“I didn’t think it was possible,” he murmurs.
“Kiss me,” he says and Harry does.
“Andromeda might have mentioned it,” she simply says, turning a page. “I told her that it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“He misses you more. I can tell every single time you go back.”
“I’m going to unhook the pod,” he continues. “You drop the rocks.”
He closes his eyes again. "No."
She means to argue but she can see it in his eyes, his pent up rage finally spilling over. He’s chosen his path. She nods.
Harry obliges and it comes to him so easily. “I love you. So much,” he says against Draco’s lips, “so fucking much.”
Potter was going to be Ginny’s best man. It made sense. The bond between Potter and Ginny was something special and everyone could see it.
Draco has thought about coming back, he’d be a fool if he didn’t admit as much to himself. He does know that leaving England becomes much harder each time after seeing Potter. He doesn’t have the faintest idea of what he would do if he stayed. He would rather stay on the Knight Bus than go back to live at the Manor even though it would make his mother very happy. Preparations for the opening of the exhibition were almost done. But maybe after...
“I used to be an Auror. I was supposed to protect people,” Potter simply says.
Draco opens his eyes and looks at her. “I am perfectly capable of getting myself home, thank you,” he says.
“Nonsense, Potter. You’re welcome to leave if you wish, but we would love to have you for Christmas if you don’t have any plans already,” Draco says.
Aunt Andromeda looks as lovely as ever and Teddy trails behind her. He runs into Draco’s open arms and he hugs him tight.
Harry has never felt anything like it, he thinks afterward, as he gently wipes a wet cloth around their bodies. He presses a kiss to Draco’s thigh and goes when Draco reaches for him. He finds comfort in Draco’s arms as he lays his head on Draco’s chest and closes his eyes. He wants to chase that feeling, wants it so fiercely. Draco’s hand lands on his hip, his fingers moving aimlessly under his shirt. He bristles when he feels Draco’s fingertips start to touch the raised skin on his lower back.
Potter sits at the table and Draco follows him. He looks at Potter and notices that the grey hair strands at his temple have become more prominent and again, Draco withholds the need to reach out to tuck one of them behind Potter’s ear. The dark circles under his eyes have lightened and for that he’s glad.
“Hasn’t been too boring so far,” Potter says, shrugging when Draco lifts an eyebrow. “We haven’t died yet.”
“Hold this, up, up,” Harry tells Pansy as she watches his blood start to flow through. He pulls the second needle from his lips and slides it into Draco’s arm, wincing at the blood that pools around it. The silence that follows is unbearable so Harry does the only thing he can think of in that moment: he starts talking to himself. Muttering and mumbling, suddenly with a need to tell Draco
Drago shrugs, feigning ignorance. “Hardly anyone can keep up with me at weddings. It’s not my fault I’m this way.”
Harry sees her immediately when he jumps back onto the Rig. It’s hard to miss the crazy wild black hair that blows in the wind. Dressed in black. Bellatrix. She’s leaning over Hermione who coughs up blood. He looks for something, anything he could possibly find and closes his fingers on a skull in the lancer’s perch and throws it at Bellatrix’s head. He runs and pulls her off Hermione, fingers clutching hard.
