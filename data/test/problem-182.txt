Draco imagined what Harry might look like in the kitchen, sweat on his brow and a tea towel thrown over his broad shoulder.
Harry froze, staring at the faded Weird Sisters band shirt in his hands.
“You alright sweetheart?” Harry asked as Draco’s eyes cracked open. For a moment, Harry was worried Draco would be embarrassed at having come so quickly, not that Harry minded, he thought it was bloody fantastic how well the omega’s body responded just for him. However, as a lazy, sated smile spread across Draco’s face, Harry realised that Draco probably had no idea what was normal in terms of sex, this being his first real experience with such affairs. Harry was grateful for that, not because he cared about purity or any of that rot, but rather that he could be the one to show Draco that
“When is he being discharged from the Hospital Wing?” Hermione asked.
Harry nodded, feeling even more nervous than he had done earlier. “I wanted us to have a home, somewhere nice for Lyra to grow up and I thought you’d like this place. It’s got a Potions room and herb gardens and there’s a patio and plenty of fireplaces for floo connection. I’ve already got the paperwork ready to get us linked up to the Ministry and Padfoot’s and…” Harry trailed off.
“N-No, I just choked!” Draco told him. “I’m not uncomfortable.”
“Oh dear,” Katie laughed, “you’d better get dressed now Draco. Do you want to borrow a nice big cardigan sweetpea? It’s getting colder out there and you can’t afford a chill.”
Harry grimaced, he had heard of the crazed werewolf who fought on Voldemort’s side during the War. He wanted to snap at Snape again but caught Remus giving him an almost imperceptible shake of his head.
“Wait for it,” Remus sighed, closing his eyes.
“Absolutely,” Draco nodded, “but I think I might change into a different nightgown.”
Draco took a gulp of the water and nodded before frowning back at Harry. “Weren’t you out last night?”
“Papa,”
“And I know if your mum was here she’d be so proud of you and want to take you somewhere nice,” Harry continued as Draco’s heart constricted. “Oh wow, Draco, look.”
The omega’s hair was done up in an elaborate style, gossamer wisps framing his face. Draco’s exposed décolletage and arms were smooth and ivory. There was some sort of pale gloss across his full lips and apart from Lyra, Harry had never seen a sight more beautiful.
A nasty twist of satisfaction settled in Harry’s gut as he watched the two of them descend into rushed, accusatory whispers. To his surprise when he glanced back over at Luna she sent him a small wink. Harry knew that he had always liked the former Ravenclaw.
“I can’t wait to see them,” Draco sighed, leaning up to kiss Harry’s chin before turning his attention back to Lyra who was giggling at a maniacal looking fairy hovering outside the window.
“He’s a seventh year omega,” Pomfrey explained.
^*^*^*^*^
“Oh go chase a ball or something,” Severus drawled, suddenly throwing back a large portion of his robes to reveal something with dramatic flair.
Draco let out another stuttering moan as Harry changed his technique and ran deep groves up beside Draco’s spine. Draco’s breath was loud in the otherwise silent compartment and Harry clenched his teeth every time the omega wriggled in his lap from contentment.
Draco looked incredible on top of him, his ivory skin was still clouded red in patches and his blond hair was darkened by sweat, curling and sticking to his neck. From this angle, his bump looked even bigger than it was and there were pearly lines across his abdomen that were a testament to how beautifully he was growing.
“Oh, well, don’t worry about that,” Harry grinned ruefully, “like I told you, I don’t spend my galleons on anything really and I honestly wanted to.”
“It’s meant to feel safe,” Draco suggested.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, looking rather regretful, “I had a feeling you might say that.”
bad,” Smith smirked, his fingers cupping Draco’s chin more tightly and angling his face up. “There are parts of you that are very,
“This is our home,” Draco repeated, his voice still full of disbelieving wonder and emotion.
“We’d be good together,” Damien snapped, all hints of previous shyness evaporated. “We would actually fit. Venetia Dawson’s an insipid airhead, whilst Draco Malfoy,” Damien gave a musical laugh, “well, us Slytherin omegas have shared a dorm with him for seven years now and let me tell you, you’re not the first alpha he’s tried this game with.”
“Sweetheart, I –“ Harry gasped and Draco could start to feel the older man’s knot forming, a steadily swelling bulb at the base of his shaft. It caught on Draco’s rim, causing him to hiss from overstimulation and turn his head to the side.
“Oh I’m sorry,” Madam Pomfrey huffed, “should I have chosen a different object to suit you Mr. Potter? Your baby is the size of a quaffle.”
“Not the pickled onions,” Ron grinned, “apparently it was different for each of us though. When she was pregnant with Ginny all mum hankered after was ice cream covered in cold tomato soup.”
“Is this bubble bath baby safe?” Draco asked, glancing up as Harry began disrobing.
“He’s so much like his father,” Snape said, his voice seeming to find strength again as he wearily sat back up against the stone bench.
Draco saw Sirius and Remus exchange a look as both men loudly announced they fancied another Irish coffee before disappearing over to the kitchen.
“Shit, sorry,” Harry winced, “didn’t mean to slam it that hard.”
“Draco?” Harry jumped up. “Are you okay?”
“Four weeks,” Draco replied, his other hand going to his stomach again as the betas all exchanged knowing smiles.
Draco smiled again, his posture relaxing as his nose wrinkled up like Harry had seen it do when he was relaxed and laughing with Katie and Hermione.
“Harry,” Draco mumbled, rubbing their noses before catching the alpha’s mouth in a kiss.
“Oh wow,” Harry said, staring at the 3D image that was hovering in the air above them. “The head is ginormous – must inherit their brains from you,” he winked as Draco giggled. The alpha commented on the size of the head every time they had a scan and every single time he received a frustrated eye roll from Madam Pomfrey.
“Don’t tell her that,” Harry grinned, glad that Draco seemed more relaxed again. “Her ego’s already the size of a planet.”
“Yours, Alpha,” Draco breathed back before letting out a small squeak as Harry reached up to spread the younger boy’s cheeks apart, revealing a light halo of golden hair around his dark pink hole. As Harry drew closer, another thick globule of slick was released, dripping messily down to the sheets.
“Shall we give it a go?” Harry grinned, nudging Draco’s side.
’ – pssh, typical omega.”
Harry supportively wrapped a strong arm around Draco’s middle, feeling small, cold fingers immediately clutch at him.
“Oh come on,” Smith drawled, darting his hand out to tug Draco back. He crowded Draco against a nearby wall of pine, leaning over him. Smith’s scent was wood polish and grapes and Draco’s omega did not like it one bit.
His luck was bound to run out sooner or later he supposed. Aunt Bella had already sent Draco several biting letters warning Draco not to come crying back to her when his alpha showed his ‘true colours’.
That was another thing, apparently they
“My flat’s not far?” Colum suggested.
Draco re-read the letter twice before carefully rolling it back up and popping it on the nightstand. Of course it wasn’t surprising that Harry was reluctant to take Draco home over the holidays. Draco wasn’t Harry’s real omega and his godfathers were probably furious that he had apparently gotten someone unintentionally pregnant.
“Good,” Remus replied, “now I hope all of us can move on from such things, put resentments and former enmities behind us.” Remus paused, “Lily would want you in her grandchild’s life, Severus.”
Draco turned around and began rooting through his trunk and Harry wondered if he had somehow offended the boy? “Not that I think omegas should dress a certain way of course, I just…” Harry trailed off as he found himself with a lap full of faded looking fashion magazines, some of them appeared pretty dated.
“Severus,” Remus paused, his voice almost a whisper. “Did you ever use the spell?”
^*^*^*^*^
“N-No,” Draco squirmed, shaking his head in protest. “Y-You’re the baby’s daddy, I –“
“Oh bugger,” Harry said, casting a quick tempus. “Yeah, I’ve got to dash, but before I go, which of these vials is feverfew?” Harry asked, holding up the tubes for Snape to inspect.
“Yes, I know, it was something confidential about another student. But honestly, Harry you can’t be like this, you’re not learning anything!” Hermione gestured emphatically to the now discarded textbook as Harry laughed weakly. Of course that would be what she was most concerned about.
“Alright lads,” Dean announced, walking up to the table carrying a tray of pint glasses. Ginny, Luna, Neville, Hannah Abbott, Michael Corner and a couple of others joined them, pulling up chairs and lamenting how the last of the nice weather had finally buggered off.
“O-Okay,” Draco nodded, avoiding looking at Harry.
“Male omegas,” Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, not really wanting to let on about the research he had done. “pregnancy can be rare for some bloodlines and the abortive procedure is quite traumatising for the womb.”
Draco scrunched his face up, he felt upset and angry. This alpha didn’t know Draco, he had no right to say such things.
Harry decided the beating, and the current smarting of where his pubic hair had been ripped out, had been worth it as Draco gave him a sweet, hopeful smile.
Draco flushed and beamed before tapping at Harry’s biceps. “Why don’t you turn us over? You can lie down on the bed and I’ll be on top.”
“Primrose and Profitts,” Snape repeated. “The historically pureblood’s financial institution of choice when it comes to trust funds, dowries and inheritances.”
“Thank you hen,” Katie replied, coming over to hold Draco’s hands with a slightly furrowed brow. “Are you feeling nervous about something?”
“Look what you do to me, angel,” Harry whispered as Draco stared hungrily at Harry’s blood swollen prick. Harry’s shaft was pulsing and the veins stood out rigidly, leading up to his throbbing bulb, the foreskin already wrinkled down as the dark slit gaped and leaked precome. Harry let go of Draco’s delicate wrists, manoeuvring the omega round so as to bring his round bottom up to Harry’s face.
“Bigger, right,” Harry nodded, waving his wand as the bolster pillows began to lengthen like playdough sausages rolled under your palm.
“Thank you,” Draco said, pulling off his robe as Hermione began looking for some socks.
“The baby!” Draco exclaimed, looking slightly shocked.
part of her.”
“He’s not a lout,” Draco rolled his eyes, “he’s just protective. It’s a good thing Uncle Sev, you should be happy I’ve found someone who loves me.”
“Oh they’re using the diversion charm,” Hermione announced as they drew up to the maze’s entrance and purchased their tickets. “That was used in the Triwizard Tournament as well.”
“I d-don’t think it’s too bad,” Draco told them. He quickly glanced to Hermione who shot him a calm smile, settling his nerves that these women were okay. Draco pushed down the bed sheets and tried not to blush, apart from the other omegas in his dorm no one had really seen him in such a state of undress.
“I brought mince pies,” Severus announced smugly, holding out the silver, cling filmed platter as Draco let out a hiccoughed giggle.
“I’m back!” Madam Pomfrey trilled as she flew through the curtains and bore down on them. “How’s it going in here – oh my goodness! Well I can see that the massage was successful, that’s good. You must be feeling a lot lighter Draco.” She continued to bustle about as if nothing was the matter, as if the entire room wasn’t thick with pheromones and Harry’s arousal.
“I was just wondering,” Draco began, “and y-you can say no!”
“Tell you what,” the lady started pulling some items out, “How about if we combine the crystallised ginger cubes with salt and vinegar crisps and a dash of sour sherbet power but leave out the candy wand?”
“So thoughtful, your alpha,” Katie whispered to Draco, the omega flushed, glancing up at Harry shyly with a pleased expression.
“Oh don’t be absurd,” the woman muttered, “what did I tell you Rodolphus? Omega hormones, that’s what it is. If you think, for one moment we’d let you swell with some mudblood knothead seed then you’re as stupid as your father was.”
Draco laughed in delight as Harry shot him a pleased grin. “What do
Harry huffed a laugh and felt himself relax. “Thank you, you’re very attractive too Damien. I’m sure there must be a hundred alphas and betas who would kill for a shot with you.”
“Yeah?” Harry grunted appreciatively as Draco kissed him again, his tongue pushing into Harry’s mouth. Harry ran his hands up Draco’s arms, thumbing at the thin straps of the dress before pulling them down. Draco groaned, shrugging out of the top of the dress as the ruched silk flopped down to his waist, exposing his pale upper body. Draco was wearing stick on nipple pads to catch any leaks and Harry carefully peeled them off so he could caress his omega’s body in its entirety.
“Why didn’t you tell me they were here alrea-“ Snape fell silent as he saw Harry standing next to the Lestranges.
“So what’s it like?” Ron hissed, glancing round to check Hermione wasn’t coming back yet. “You know, with an omega?”
“Y-You bought me a house?” Draco’s eyes went huge and his mouth fell open.
) liked to describe Harry as ‘arrogant and lazy’, his grades and achievements stood for themselves. Of course, Remus had always been there too, to tone down Harry’s cockiness and remind him to keep his alpha in check. It didn’t exactly help though that Sirius would be pulling faces in the background.
“That’s awesome,” Harry nodded.
In his desperation, Draco had been sidling up to Hermione and letting Katie play with his hair whilst pretending to be very put out about the whole thing. Harry, despite being kind, was still rather formal around Draco and the omega had simply figured the older man wasn’t interested in touching him. The idea that Harry might have been holding back as he was worried about Draco feeling uncomfortable came as a surprise.
“Little one?”
“Looks like I’ll be able to keep her company tomorrow then,” Harry noted, “I’m sure she’d be up for making flashcards about the first Goblin Revolution with us.”
“In all seriousness,” Remus said quietly as there was clanging and clinking from the kitchen whilst Sirius appeared to make a suspicious amount of noise for a few cups of tea. “We’re very happy that you and Harry have joined us for Christmas. I know Sirius has an odd way of saying things, but he really did like your mother. I think it upsets him a little to think about what happened to everybody in the end. I’m sure he would be willing to let you see the Black photo albums and to keep, or make copies of, whatever you would like.”
Surprisingly, Madam Pomfrey was also present and it was unusual to see her looking so grave.
Draco had found himself wiping away hot, angry tears as he had balled the letter up in his fist and chucked it into the fire.
Draco realised after Harry failed to reply that the beta was in fact talking to him.
“You can come out now Potter,” Snape sighed, “you’ve always been useless at hiding your scent.”
“Ah,” Harry’s face fell as he reached for a glass of pumpkin juice and gave it to Draco. “I’m guessing you still feel a bit too uncomfortable around me then?”
that idea. Then he tried to imagine another faceless alpha bonding with Draco,
Draco giggled, feeling absolutely wonderful. With a slight pang of regret he wondered if all these people would be coming here again next year? Draco probably wouldn’t be invited then, no longer being Harry’s responsibility. He shoved the thought to the back of his mind and took a deep breath, the air smelled of peppermint and roasted chestnuts and right now, Harry was holding his hand.
“Please don’t call him a ‘kid’,” Harry groaned, pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes until he saw speckles of colour.
“You alright in there Dear?” Olive called out, peering through the gap as Draco let out a panicked noise and tried to twist himself out of sight.
Then of course there had been the incident with Zacharias Smith. It made Harry’s blood boil to even think of it, to remember how the slimy alpha had deigned to lay his hands on Draco. Harry had been certain that Draco would want to go home straight afterwards, that the omega would be horribly shaken by what had happened. Certainly Draco’s scent when he had fallen through the clearing had been a particularly acidic assault on Harry’s nose. However the omega had quickly calmed in Harry’s presence, his heartbeat steadying and his limbs stopping their shaking by the time Harry had picked him up and held him close.
“Oh, this will not go well,” Hermione muttered, rapidly casting her own cooling charm over the previously hot custard as it began to expand and pulsate.
“Yes please,” Draco replied bashfully, however as Draco tried to twist towards the window to give Harry access, the omega let out a hiss of pain.
“Are you alright?” Hermione asked kindly, glancing at Draco’s sodden robes.
“I do!” Draco exclaimed loudly before blushing and letting out a small whine, burying down into Harry’s arms.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment before shyly replying, “and you’ll be a daddy,” under his breath.
“No, you’re alright,” Harry replied, plastering on a tight smile that he was pretty sure came across as pained. The girl shrugged before turning to a very eager looking Dean instead. A few minutes later, they were up and heading into the dancing throngs with swaying hips.
“Nah,” Ginny shrugged with an amused glint in her eye, “reckon he can grovel a bit first, maybe take me out for a fancy dinner.”
“Madam Pomfrey says you have to eat more,” Harry frowned. “Especially as you’re not fully mated,” he looked somewhat uncomfortable saying the last part.
“You haven’t let Bella anywhere near the bump have you?” Sirius grimaced. “She hasn’t been chanting Latin or drawing any dark looking runes?”
“I have potions that can dissolve such a bond,” Snape replied quickly, his voice hard again. “And if I ever get so much of a whiff that Draco is unhappy –“
NEWTS.”
On the walls were several large canvases sporting paintings of the like that Draco had never seen before. Vibrant splashes of bold colour forming amorphous shapes that as soon as Draco thought he had figured out, the paint strokes seemed to reform as if tricking him. At the bottom right of most of the paintings were the black initials ‘L.E.’, bar the canvas that hung above the stairs, which read ‘L.P’.
“Love, yes,” Severus spoke, his voice was soft and almost wistful, “what a terribly powerful thing.” He glanced over at Draco, “and it can lead to such miracles.”
“Draco?” Harry called out, opening the bathroom door in a cloud of steam. The older man was still clearly mid shower as there were shampoo bubbles in his hair and he had hastily wrapped a towel around his waist. “I could smell distress, what’s happening?”
Harry sighed and sat back down on the chair, he had been wondering when Draco was finally going to be brave enough to bring this up.
“M-My what?” Draco stammered, his heart lurching in his chest as Harry’s eyes widened dramatically and he shuffled round to the front of Draco’s chair, peering between his legs.
Venetia was a seventh year omega with perfectly curled hair and a porcelain doll face. She was objectively incredibly beautiful and always made it blisteringly obvious that she was hoping Harry would suddenly invite her to Hogsmeade.
we’ve been trying to find a pureblood alpha for you Draco. Can you imagine if it got out that you’d already been knocked up? The Sourbolls would laugh in our faces!”
Draco kept fretting that Harry was going to come to his senses and change his mind. The alpha had even insisted that Draco be allowed to complete his school studies rather than being sent away somewhere to avoid gossip. Draco knew of course, that whilst his own already tattered reputation was going to be irrevocably stained by the whole affair, as an alpha, Harry shouldn’t bear too much social consternation. However, Draco still found it very hard to believe that Harry was okay with everybody thinking he had actually gotten Draco pregnant.
“I know,” Draco whispered, ashamed of the slight pang of regret he felt at Harry stating so clearly that he didn’t want him. Draco’s omega was taking the gentlemanly reassurance as some kind of rejection and Draco was doing his very best to shut down such silliness. He
to know what’s happening,” Harry urged firmly, “I’m worried.”
“I feel sick,” Draco whined, his head turning to one side and his grey eyes opening to look pleadingly at Harry.
“Like the Duomo in Florence,” Harry beamed proudly. “We’ll be the Brunelleschis of nest building before you know it.”
Harry crossed over to the large oak door, studded with iron nails and creaked it open. On the other side stood the Hogwarts headmistress, Professor McGonagall, looking extremely harassed.
“Would you like me to show you how it’s done?” Madam Pomfrey asked. “You’ve got such sensitive skin, I think it would be best if we could avoid using a pump as much as possible. Mr. Potter, unless you are going to be assisting young Draco with this, may I suggest you might wait outside?” Madam Pomfrey asked, looking questioningly up at Harry. “I am aware that as Draco’s legal alpha I cannot ask you to leave, however –“
“I like it,” Draco smiled, biting his lip.
“That’s better,” Harry declared, giving Draco a small wink before summoning a very wizened looking house elf.
“WHAT THE
“Harry,” Draco murmured, biting his lip. “Do you think we could maybe have more than one godmother?”
antiquated views about omega / alpha fraternisation.
going to think? First you let him keep the baby, then you’ve been practically glued to his side, then you nearly killed that Eighth Year alpha who made a lewd comment about him in the corridor the other day and…and now you’re saying you might invite him to live with you? You’re messing with the boy’s head Harry, his omega hormones are already going to be confusing all his senses. You don’t need to take responsibility like this…you didn’t fuck him.”
“Oh,” Draco glanced up at Harry who was smiling at him encouragingly. “I…” Draco reached inside his robes to pull out the duplicated photo of his mother. He hadn’t wanted to risk bringing the real thing all the way down to London. He walked over to the counter and proffered it carefully forwards. Olive peered down at the picture before her face lit up.
The intensity of Draco’s distress at the Winter Wonderland, however, had snapped Harry back to his senses. He had promised Draco he would never take advantage of him and Harry had wrestled his salivating inner alpha back into submission. It didn’t help that Draco had then trusted Harry to carry round the bag containing his soiled clothes for the rest of the day.
“Well it’s the truth as far as Harry and Draco are concerned,” Remus informed them. “Technically you see,” he turned to Harry, “the inheritance will be under your guardianship, and only your signature will allow Draco to make withdrawals.”
“Oh!” Harry said in realisation. “You’d like a piece of my clothing right? I read that the alpha’s scent helps during pregnancy.”
“Oh bugger,” Harry said, having evidently had the same thought, “should I have just gotten on top? Shit, sorry Draco.”
“That was the day your father graduated,” Remus told Draco, “it was also the day he proposed to Narcissa.”
Harry tried to imagine a tiny pregnant Draco in the middle of the Weasley kitchen, surrounded by giant red headed alphas and betas. At least Molly was an omega, perhaps it might actually help Draco to speak to someone who had been through omega pregnancy before.
“Oh sweetheart, don’t be scared,” one of the other women smiled, walking towards Draco. She had short golden hair and tortoiseshell glasses. At least Draco could scent that they were all betas. He had never been very comfortable around alphas and especially now so that he was pregnant.
Draco leaned closer to the door.
Draco pouted and reached for a ripe persimmon, not bothering to cut it into slices before he bit into it. Juice exploded across Draco’s tongue, it was sweet and rich and he smiled happily up at Harry.
Eventually, Draco reached the altar where he peered shyly up at Harry.
“How’s he doing?” Hermione asked, cracking her eyes open and yawning. It was nearly midnight and yet she had insisted on staying until Draco woke up. Even Ron was about, although he had momentarily nipped out to get them all some sustenance.
“I guess he isn’t bored of you yet,” Bella continued, flagging over a waiter and ordering for the both of them without giving Draco a choice anyway. “I see I was right though.”
Draco drew away from the kitchen, not wanting to hear any more. He padded softly back to the living room and found Harry through the crowd. The older man was talking to a petite blonde woman that Draco could tell was an omega, the two of them were laughing about something Draco couldn’t hear. The woman was wearing a tight fitting purple dress that cinched in at the waist and highlighted how incredibly trim she was. Draco absently reached up to finger the straps of his pinafore, having had the horrible realisation that such a style of garment was probably only emphasising his immaturity.
Oh god, what if Harry thought that Draco had
“Are you surprised?” Hettie Smith laughed, joining in on the discussion. “Look at what he’s wearing, I mean talk about an image overhaul. You really wanted everyone to think you were some harmless, drab, little omega before didn’t you? I guess that’s why they call Slytherins ‘snakes’!”
“H-Harry? Is everything okay?” Draco asked, looking around them.
A small voice whispered in Draco’s mind.
^*^*^*^*^
“Ginny,” Harry hissed, scrabbling to sit up.
“Hey Harry,” Seamus voice bellowed out across the dorm room and a second later the curtains were wrenched back. “I’ve got your omega here. He was standing outside looking worried and saying something about shopping…oh…”
“Do you want me to rub it for you?” Harry offered. He was pretty good with sports massages that prevented cramp after particularly intense quidditch games.
“In here,” Severus’ voice called out from one of the antechambers. Draco walked over, entering to find his godfather hunched over a large pewter cauldron, his lips moving wordlessly as he counted the number of stirs.
Draco blushed but felt pleased as his stomach let out an embarrassingly loud gurgle.
“For all his impulsivity, my Padfoot is fantastically predictable,” Remus told Harry fondly as he passed him a cup of hot mulled wine, it smelled of nutmeg and star anise. Remus sighed and took a sip of his own mug. “Has it really been seventeen years? You know it shocked me when he said that. Sometimes I forget I’m not twenty-one anymore.” Remus glanced over at Sirius, who now appeared to be in the middle of telling Draco a story about Narcissa putting spiders in Bellatrix’s cereal. Draco looked equal parts horrified and delighted.
“Oh dear,” Luna laughed upon seeing Draco’s expression. “Well then, I suppose we had better be getting to Madam Pomfrey.”
Draco gaped at the festive flurry of sights, sounds and smells rolled out before them. The Winter Wonderland was absolutely massive. Much bigger, Draco suspected, than the one in Hogsmeade would have been.
“You done in there?” the woman’s voice called out as Harry and Draco jerked apart as if burned. Draco remained kneeling on the snowy ground for a few moments before he felt Harry’s hands gently help him up to his feet.
Sirius was sat on the sofa reading a travel book about Bolivia. Remus was leaning against the mantelpiece, offering Draco advice whenever he reached a confusing set of German instructions.
“Would you present for me?” Harry asked, his voice so low as to almost be a rasp. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to mount you, I promise. I just want to see you.”
Draco chewed on his lip before nodding, still averting his eyes as he rolled over. Harry had to help him slightly due to the weight of the baby bump. However, soon they found a comfortable enough position as Draco rested his head on his arms and tilted his hips so as to present his arse to Harry.
“H-Harry,” Draco whimpered as the older man looked up, breathing heavily but not slowing down his fingers even for a second.
“I think I c-can still fit into them,” Draco nodded. He had actually noticed an entire maternity section along the far wall but obviously hadn’t wanted to say anything to Olive at the time.
“Draco?” Harry asked again quietly. He could sense movement and when he looked down he realised that Draco’s right elbow was rhythmically jabbing into the meat of Harry’s thigh.
“Oh calm down Potter,” Smith snorted, “I’m not blaming you, he’s got a nice mouth.” The alpha smirked unpleasantly at Draco, who immediately clapped his hands over aforesaid mouth.
“What do you mean is there a bu-“ Olive began when the mechanical bluebird started singing again. “Oh bother, another customer and Agatha’s gone for early lunch. Okay right, please excuse me boys, oh and Draco,” Olive turned back from where she had been about to descend the stairs. “Try on the blouse combo first, it’s sure to be a knockout.”
“The spell,” Draco sniffed as great fat tears began to roll down his cheeks. “I w-was reading one of your old journals Uncle Sev,” Draco turned to his godfather pleadingly, “it was the one with the drawing of the lily next to it.”
“Oh,” Harry laughed but there was no mirth in it, “well if
Draco whimpered, nodding erratically as his head tipped back, allowing Harry to eagerly mouth at the scar of their bond bite, tracing it with his tongue, tasting cinnamon and apples.
’ Draco begged the trees,
Eventually, Harry seated fully inside Draco, his wiry hair pressing against the sensitive skin of Draco’s buttocks.
Draco glared at Harry before looking round the café, “Don’t make me start smelling weird,” he hissed.
The issue was that Draco hadn’t quite worked up the courage to wear any of his new clothes in front of other people yet. Even though Professor McGonagall had told Draco that he was permitted to forgo the usual school uniform. Harry had seemed a little disappointed at first, questioning if maybe the omega didn’t like them after all.
“But why can’t you tell people it was a spell?” Ron blurted out. “That’s what I don’t get, I mean, it’s not your fault and people are going to think…well.”
“I see,” Severus nodded. “Well in that case I suppose I had better write you a reference.”
“Um,” Harry cleared his throat and fiddled with his glasses for a moment. “Fretterling Fevers are more like an echo of your actual heat,” he said, as if reciting from a text book, Draco could imagine that the alpha probably had done some reading on the matter. He was always telling Draco about odd facts he had learned from omega pregnancy manuals, like Draco should avoid liquorice due to an omega’s fluctuating potassium levels.
“Probably no one will even care,” Harry finished bitterly as Hermione raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Don’t you remember last year? That scandal with Colin Brinespawn?”
Harry leaned in, sticking out his tongue and licking a long stripe up Draco’s crack, eliciting a loud cry from the omega. Draco’s back arched and Harry grinned as he found himself presented with a face full of Draco’s dripping hole. Harry happily obliged, diving in to feast on Draco’s arse like a starving man. He laved the dark whorl lovingly before poking his tongue inside, pressing at Draco’s walls as the younger boy began to writhe on the bed with hiccoughing sobs.
“She was always a snob,” Sirius announced as Draco lowered the photo and looked back up at him. The other man’s face was sombre again as he eyed Draco curiously. “But she knew how to have a laugh did Cissy, at least until she met that reptile –“
Harry wrenched his gaze away and locked eyes with Draco again, the omega’s mouth fell open as his entire body started to spasm.
“Mm,” Draco nodded, seemingly placated. He turned his head to nuzzle sleepily into Harry’s chest. “Thank you alpha.”
“Is that my dad?!” Draco blurted in amazement. Whilst Bellatrix had retained some childhood photos of Narcissa, any pictorial representations of Lucius Malfoy that weren’t damning cuttings from newspapers, were few and far between.
Draco’s heart fell as he braced himself to be thrown out of the shop. Olive would be perfectly within her rights not to want an unmated pregnant omega as a member of her clientele. It was painfully clear in this state, and also from his scent, that there was no bite on Draco’s neck and he had already mentioned to Olive that he was still studying for his NEWTS.
Harry moaned in pleasure, tipping forwards and running his hands down Draco’s arched back. He was delighted to find that he could still reach the omega’s arse, wasting no time in rubbing insistent circles around the slick soaked hole.
Hogwarts champions. One from Seventh Year in the form of Cedric Diggory and the then Sixth Year Harry Potter.
“Madam Pomfrey told me,” Harry lied, hoping Ron didn’t notice the books stuffed under Harry’s bed, “that omegas bond with the fetus immediately…like, from conception.”
Remus gestured for them to all go over to the sofa area, offering to take their coats which he hung up on what looked to be a repurposed muggle traffic light.
“There you are!” Katie grinned as she jogged towards Draco. She was wearing a loose white blouse and blue and white striped linen shorts. “You’re going to be late for your own birthday party.”
Hermione laughed as Ron walked back in carrying a tray with three steaming mugs on top.
It was a relatively clear day and Harry found himself watching the familiar landscape go by rather nostalgically. By the second hour, however, Draco had started to fidget a lot more, letting out small huffs of breath as he shifted about on the seat next to Harry.
“Wait a moment,” Harry frowned, “there’s an otter too, and a Jack Russell…” he look quizzically at Draco. “Draco, have you ever mentioned to Hermione what your patronus is?”
Draco moaned before Harry pushed more of the silk into his gaping mouth with his fingers. Draco immediately sucked on the digits through the fabric, laving them with his own tongue and hollowing his cheeks.
“Are we expecting anyone?” Sirius asked as Harry and Remus exchanged guilty glances.
“Alright then,” Harry replied, “only show me if you feel comfortable though.”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “Remus taught me. It was great actually as he’d learned a few of my dad’s recipes which he then passed on to me. I make a mean chicken biryani.”
“Harry,” Draco repeated, his speech was slurred and he could feel his eyes start to glaze over. His own cock was hard again, pulsing and throbbing almost painfully. “P-Please – bond me.”
“No,” Draco replied, holding his breath as the mattress dipped heavily and the much larger alpha got into bed beside him. Draco couldn’t help the small strangled noise he let out when he realised that Harry had actually gotten in
“I’m fine,” Draco replied, amazed he hadn’t stuttered. His trembling had died down and he was surrounded by Harry’s scent and Hermione’s warmth.
“Oh, um, I don’t mind,” Draco replied. Harry rolled his eyes, he was pretty sure that Draco hadn’t actually liked the idea of getting married in the Weasley’s back garden. He didn’t think it was anything to do with it not being grand enough and more to do with the fact that Harry had previously been involved with Ginny.
Harry nodded dumbly as the older witch waved her wand before passing him a wipe for good measure. Draco was still staring at Harry, his eyes huge and wet as if he was going to cry. Harry’s first instinct was to run away, maybe go and drown his shame in the Three Broomsticks. However, as the first watery droplet spilled down Draco’s cheek, Harry made up his mind.
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall levelled him with an unimpressed glare. “I think you should.”
“Am I a self absorbed arsehole?” Harry blurted out under his breath. Hermione froze for a moment, staring at his questioning expression before snorting a loud laugh. “Oh thanks,” Harry muttered, “that’s reassuring.”
“Sirius is a five year old perpetually either crashing or surfing on a sugar high, whilst Remus here has a sense of humour drier than the Sahara,” Harry explained. Remus nodded in agreement with an apologetic grin at Draco.
Harry waited but no more explanation seemed to be forthcoming. “Um, Draco, I kind of need to know what it is in order to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Harry grinned, crouching down on the floor beside the omega and trying to make himself seem as least intimidating as possible.
Harry cursed himself as he realised that he must still be carrying some of Colum’s cherry and almonds scent on his clothes.
“Yes, that’s fine,” Draco replied, going back inside.
Harry very carefully rolled them over so their positions were reversed. In the end they settled with Draco’s buttocks and back supported by Harry bending his knees up like the back of a seat. Harry sighed with relief as he sunk down into the soft bedding, not even minding how drenched and sticky it was.
Draco groaned, the touches were wonderful, incredible but it wasn’t quite enough. Here, in their nest, Draco knew he needed more. He was nervous though, the idea of being with someone for the first time was already overwhelming enough and now his brain was trying to process the sensations of the nest, his alpha and being pregnant simultaneously.
Draco’s eyes wandered across the little symbols and drawings. There was an Igloo Café, an ice rink, various rides, a carousel, about a hundred food stalls, Santa’s Grotto, a Christmas tree maze that the others seemed rather keen on, a market area and so much more that Draco struggled to take it all in.
“What would you like sweetheart?” he asked as Draco felt himself swell with happiness.
“Please tell me,” Draco begged, he didn’t think he could bear all the horrendous hypothetical images that his imagination was currently conjuring. Harry turned to regard him closely for a moment before giving a brief, tight nod.
“Maybe you should go on a walk?” Neville piped up. “It always clears my head when I’m in a funk. You never feel worse after a walk you know.”
“You want it harder?” Harry asked, he could feel his voice sounding harsh and rough, his alpha turning wild and possessive. “You want your husband to fuck you harder little one? Make you scream? Make you come so hard all over your naked little body?”
Draco laughed and shook his head, “I was worried about one of the answers I gave on the Arithmancy paper, I used the Porrage-Colson formula but Hermione said that –“
Draco let out a little gasp, the glass slipping from his fingers and the water spreading across the bed sheets.
“Can I c-call you the other thing as well?” Draco asked tentatively, his blossom pink tongue darting out to wet his stretched lips.
“Actually, Ginny kind of already knows, so do Hermione and Ron,” Harry winced slightly as Draco gasped anxiously. “But trust me, they won’t tell
Draco’s face fell as he thought about how the other omegas would cuddle up together and buy things for each other’s nests.
“You’re beautiful sweetheart,” Harry stated calmly, marvelling at how such a sweet, wonderful creature was placing so much trust in him. “Would you like me to touch you?”
“Don’t complain when there’s no presents left for you!” Ginny shouted after him.
Hogwarts had been…difficult for Draco. After his parents fought and died for the Dark Lord’s side in the Wizarding War, the Malfoy name acted as a social deterrent. Draco had attempted to make friends of course, and for the first three years he had enjoyed the somewhat dull company of Crabbe and Goyle, whose families were also not exactly flavour of the month at wizarding social events.
“Your legs will t-turn blue as well!” Draco told her.
Draco flushed and hid his grin in his bouquet, which was composed of delicate summer flowers such as sweetpeas, lisianthus and freesias. Snape still managed to send a piercing glare as Harry heard Ron gulp from somewhere behind him.
Eventually, Draco gave up on the robes, having transfigured them as much as the fabric was going to allow. Instead, he warily eyed his now rather full looking wardrobe.
Harry’s mind flashed back to Draco’s hiccoughing sobs and desperate pleas whilst his aunt laughed cruelly.
“Draco Malfoy,” Snape snapped irritably beside Harry.
,” Damien stage whispered.
Ron paled slightly, “Okay, I get why when you put it that way it’s a bit off, but this is an unusual situation right?”
Hermione was standing on the other side, with Lyra gurgling contentedly in her arms. Katie was already disappearing down the stairs, having brought up the bag of clothes. She let out a peal of laughter, however, as she glanced back and saw the state Harry’s suit was in. Harry cringed slightly but figured he could probably put up with the inevitable teasing later.
The omega was wearing a dusky pink satin blouse that was artfully loose and showed just a hint of his delicate collarbone. The blouse was tucked into high waisted, light grey trousers with a sharp crease down the centre. To top it off, Draco was donning cream coloured ballet shoes with mother of pearl rose motifs on the top. The whole effect was incredibly elegant and far softer on Draco’s pale skin than his usual black robes.
“Did you notice though? No bond bite,” a voice came from the kitchen. Draco tiptoed a little closer and peeked through the gap. He could see a rather stern looking older woman that Ron had mentioned was his great aunt Muriel. She was chatting to another couple of ladies all sat round the dining table.
“Mm,” Draco nodded, rubbing his stomach. “A very big turnip.”
“I mean,” Harry coughed, “It’s
“So my darling,” Olive conjured two mugs and popped in some bags of breakfast tea. “Were you after anything in particular?”
I…” he smiled sheepishly.
Maybe Bellatrix was right, but Draco was fully prepared for being unwanted by everyone for the rest of his life, so long as he could keep his baby.
“Stupid cow,” Sirius muttered. “You know five years ago she tried to set me up with her niece? As if I haven’t been shacked up with a sexy werewolf for the last seventeen.”
“Well, what about the London one?” Hermione asked, “The one we all went to two years ago, just north of the muggle version in Hyde Park? That’s going on all season, I reckon you could still get tickets.”
“I – I guess.”
Draco opened his mouth to talk but upon seeing Katie’s expression simply allowed himself to nod again.
“It’s b-been happening this month,” Draco sighed. “Madam Pomfrey says it’s natural and I shouldn’t w-worry.”
“I don’t care what you think of me Potter,” Snape stated. Harry noticed that two fighting, or perhaps mating, May-bugs had fallen into Snape’s lap, jousting at each other with amber feathery fronds. Snape seemed either unaware of, or apathetic towards, the aggressively sparring scarabs upon his person. “I just don’t want Draco to pay for my past mistakes.”
Instead, Harry got up and wandered over to have a look at some of the shirts hanging from a nearby rail. There were a few in alpha sizes and the kinds of colours he liked on himself. He picked one up and held it against his chest in front of the floor length mirror. It was a wine burgundy with gold buttons that were a little flashier than Harry’s usual taste but seemed to suit his skin tone.
Harry’s stomach felt uncomfortable as he got out and towelled himself dry, roughly as if in penance. Merlin, he was the worst. Draco was the sweetest fucking kid whose trust he had finally earned. Harry sighed as he picked his glasses back up and rubbed the steam from them. He could get through this but he needed to pull himself together. Draco didn’t deserve to be lusted over by some drooling knothead.
“Ah, that’s a wicked shame,” Ron said in commiseration.
“It’s fine,” Draco smiled tightly, hoping that the three of them didn’t really still see him a some dumb school kid.
“You’d be bloody lucky to be marked by someone like me,” Smith growled, his pupils growing larger as he stared down at Draco. “Your last name is worth shit and you’re already tainted.”
“Bloody hell, there’s Neville, Hannah and Luna!” Seamus laughed as he pointed up ahead to where the three other Gaedere students were just coming onto the path. “What’s Nev doing?”
“Yes please,” Draco nodded, his cheeks were obviously red and he could see both Remus and Sirius looking at him with degrees of amusement.
“Is that you Harry?” A dark haired beta woman who looked to be in her late thirties was beaming at them. “You know, my assistant Agatha told me there was a rather dapper alpha looking through my windows but imagine my surprise when I saw who it was.”
“You better bloody believe it,” Harry grinned, “Woman knows all my weaknesses and she’s learned a whole load of fancy spells from all those books of hers.”
“Don’t know where he is,” Ginny shrugged, “wasn’t in bed when I came in. Probably trying to smooth things over with Hermione.”
“What would do this?” Madam Pomfrey asked, her voice calm and measured.
“Plus I was lying before,” Ginny continued, completely undeterred, “I do think he’s pretty. I reckon most people do, they're just too scared to admit it because his family were all Death-Eaters.”
After going to the toilet and washing his hands, Harry emerged back into the body of the train only to come face to face with a very attractive omega boy. The boy looked like he might be in Sixth or Seventh Year, with curly dark hair and doe-like blue eyes.
“Shit, shit,” Harry swore, he could now also see that Draco had managed to kick down his grey underpants so they were floating in a bedraggled heap on the water’s surface.
“Y-You were my mum’s cousin?” Draco asked. He could feels his eyes prickling with tears, as often happened when he thought about the woman he had never gotten to know.
“Wait until she’s a teenager,” Draco smiled, rubbing the tip of his finger against Lyra’s pudgy cheek.
“Remus might,” Draco frowned, “he cooks.”
“We bitching about Harry’s fan club again?” Seamus asked enthusiastically as Harry rolled his eyes. The others liked to give him grief but it wasn’t Harry’s fault he was the subject of so much attention. He guessed it helped that after presenting alpha, Harry had filled out nicely and grown into his adolescent lankiness. He now stood tall and broad shouldered with thick black hair, green eyes and coffee coloured skin.
“That’s some nifty spell work,” Harry nodded, looking impressed.
“It’s to do with the venue,” Remus smiled, drawing his briefcase up onto his lap and rummaging through it for a blue binder which he passed over to Harry.
Draco moaned again, half covered by a choked gasp as he shut his eyes tightly, his knuckles were now white as he held onto the mattress.
“N-No please,” Draco hiccoughed. Harry tensed, if Draco didn’t want this family healer then surely Harry could do something about it? The fucked up legal system must have some perks in that Harry could insist Professor McGonagall brought in the St. Mungo’s one instead.
“Oh!” Draco gasped, before shutting his eyes tightly.
“Draco?” Harry asked, sounding anxious.
“I’m so sorry I lost you,” Harry murmured into Draco’s ear.
“It’s okay sweetheart,” Harry breathed out deeply, shutting his eyes and squeezing Draco’s trembling shoulders, “I’m here.”
Draco had resigned himself to a lonely life and most probably a loveless marriage, but this baby represented something else. He wouldn’t have ever bothered Harry with it, hoping instead to somehow secretly steal away from school, maybe to their French relatives or something. He knew he would make a good parent, Draco often dreamed about having a sweet little baby in his arms, teaching them to read or buying their first cauldron.
talking.”
“Let’s do that now!” Draco gulped, scrambling to try and get up but accidentally slipping on the snow and careening down. Harry caught Draco immediately, one hand bracketed gently on his belly and the other on Draco’s left hip, holding him tightly. Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body and realised that this new position meant that Draco’s bottom was pressed backwards into Harry’s crotch.
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted.
“Okay,” Harry nodded slowly, his heart starting to slow down again. “So have you broken up with Dean then?”
Draco could feel himself start to shake, his nerves had been growing steadily worse over the last month as Madam Pomfrey said a lot of his energy reserves would be diverted to the foetus.
Draco glared daggers at Harry whilst the older man attempted to make himself look suitably contrite.
Draco let out a small huff, stroking his slender fingers through Harry’s mop of black hair. Harry smiled and pressed a loving kiss right in the middle of the bump. He could smell Draco’s scent projecting happiness and contentment as the room filled with apple pie. Wanting even more, Harry began to pepper Draco’s belly with kisses, even as the omega started to giggle and try to push him away.
“Ronald!” Hermione snapped, looking shocked, “That is a terribly outdated mindset and quite frankly I’m appalled to hear you say something like that.”
“You figured out where you’re going to live next year?” Ron asked, leaning back in his deck chair. Harry knew that Ron was moving in with Fred and George so as to save money. Their apartment over Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes had a small spare room and a well connected floo point so Ron could commute every day to the Ministry. Plus, that way, when Hermione returned from America they would hopefully have enough for a deposit on a place of their own.
godfather running me over with a magically modified motorbike, oh and I’m deathly allergic to treacle tart.”
“Sirius,” Harry growled, his eyes flitting between his smirking godfather and the still closed patio doors. “I have
On Boxing Day, Draco dressed up in about five different outfits, eyeing himself critically in the mirror. By the time forty-five minutes had gone by, he was close to tears. Draco had tried to subtly extract from Harry what sort of thing the Weasleys would be wearing, however Harry’s response had been vague and terribly unhelpful.
puts courgette in a muffin?”
“Okay,” Harry sighed, crossing his arms defensively. “What did I do?”
“Harry did not ask for such things and it could have turned out dreadfully,” Remus told the other man. “We are all fortunate that Draco is such a sweet boy and Harry is such a kind man,” Remus finished his sentence looking back at Harry. There was a fierce pride and love in the beta’s brown eyes as Harry looked back at him through his own tear filled ones.
“Sort of,” Draco’s eyes flicked downwards, showing off his fan of blond lashes as he opened the door.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, looking up at the older man with so much adoration that it made Harry’s chest swell.
Draco flushed before grinning shyly.
Draco whimpered, tipping his head forward so his long blond fringe covered his face.
Draco felt himself start to shake with nerves and adrenalin as Luna called out for the others to start helping them. Draco could hear Ron swearing loudly before Hermione rushed over with a very diplomatically controlled expression, clearly not wanting to alarm Draco futher.
“Hermione let it slip after your accident,” Harry nudged Draco’s side. “It’s bloody brilliant. I thought maybe we could go celebrate? Hyde Park have got this wizarding winter wonderland festival on?”
“Fuck her,” Harry blurted out loudly, shocking Draco so much that the omega nearly slid off the sofa. Harry jerked his hand out to clasp Draco’s shoulder to steady him, his skin warm through the thin white nightdress. He grinned as Draco started to laugh.
“Do y-you have anything with ginger in it?” Draco asked. “And maybe something sour? Actually do you have anything pickled? Or m-maybe caramel?”
“Look I’m sorry Mione, it’s just I can’t find –“ Harry stopped short, staring wide eyed across at Draco who was still clad in nothing but his white underpants, his thighs glistening from the burn cream.
Without consciously being aware of it, Harry had risen to his feet and crossed over to stand next to Draco, looking down at the omega. Harry could remember students from his year at Hogwarts wearing dresses similar to this at events like the Yule Ball, but none of them had ever looked quite this alluring.
“Ah, no Harry,” Professor McGonagall shook her head awkwardly, “you may leave and well done for the match yesterday.”
“What?” Draco frowned, looking quizzically at Harry.
“Yes Ron,” Harry couldn’t help but laugh, “I happen to fancy the person I just asked to bond with me.”
“No,” Harry muttered, squeezing the omega a little tighter, “not yet.”
“There we go,” Sirius grinned, reaching up to squeeze Harry’s shoulder.
“Was that your impervious Harry?” Katie asked as her and Draco looked across at him. “It smells like cinnamon.”
“Oh yes,” Snape pulled an expression of distaste, “I had forgotten that your other half was also predisposed towards the canine form.”
“Of course not,” Harry replied.
Harry seemed to sag in relief, tucking his wand back into his sleeve before dragging Draco into a tight hug. Draco let out a small squawk as Harry’s hands suddenly clasped the backs of Draco’s thighs and hoisted him up into the air. Draco’s arms instinctively wrapped around Harry’s neck and his legs around the alpha’s torso. Draco’s bump nestled against Harry’s chest but somehow they managed to angle themselves in a way that didn’t compress it too badly but still allowed for closeness.
“Right then,” Harry nodded his head, “you be the architect and I’ll be the builder.”
“And you wonder why I gave you a P in Potions?” Snape drawled, clearly back to his old self as he regarded Harry with an expression of amused derision. “You realise you will have to pass a Potions proficiency test for your annual Auror license?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not at all,” Harry replied, doing his best to sound reassuring. “I can give you more tomorrow yeah?”
“Potions Master?” Snape raised his eyebrows, “I don’t think an omega has ever held that official title before.”
Thankfully, over the next few seconds the snow began to settle and soon a completely sparse space was revealed, the snow clad ground glistening in bright sunshine.
“I, um,” Draco fidgeted with the hem of his fluffy cardigan, half wishing he had a nest to crawl into right about now, “I’m not particularly popular with the other omegas.”
Draco nodded before reaching up on his tiptoes to pull the curtain shut again.
Harry blinked as Draco looked horrified for a moment before clapping his hands over his mouth.
good.”
“I-I’m a good omega?” Draco asked, a thread of uncertainty running through his voice.
“Really?” Draco squinted up at the older man, things were rarely so easy with Severus Snape.
Draco looked up to see what had previously been a path into the maze and turning left, was now a path that turned right as the trees magically warped and rearranged themselves.
“Draco, I can’t leave when something is very clearly wrong,” Harry said. “Are you in pain? I can summon Madam Pomfrey?”
The bond was starting to take effect, Harry had already thought that Draco smelled like his due to the pregnancy, but now the intensity was tenfold. Thankfully the flow of blood had already subsided and all that was left was an angry red mark, sore and puffy on the omega’s scent gland. Hopefully it would heal into a clean silver scar below the three dark freckles.
“H-Harry made me a cake?” Draco asked excitedly. The House Elves had used to bake him cakes when he was little but eventually Bellatrix had informed them not to bother anymore as there was only Draco to eat it.
“By the way,” Harry cleared his throat and turned to the Lestranges, “I think you’ll find that medical custody of a pregnant omega falls to the alpha they coupled with.”
“Then
Draco tried not to pull a face as she carefully dabbed the gloop onto his reddened thighs, they were stinging a bit more now but at least the ointment would help.
“Well he went the wrong way about it then didn’t he!” Snape spat.
“Omegas shouldn’t be desperate,” Damien smiled beatifically. “And an alpha like you deserves the right one.”
Draco let out a stuttered whine, his mouth still full of Harry’s cock as Harry pushed in a digit, slowly and only to the first knuckle. Draco’s walls contracted around him, squeezing the intrusion as if his body wasn’t sure whether to suck it further up or push it back out.
Harry looked out of the Hospital Wing windows, the day was rather pleasingly sunny and any cloud cover had been burned off already. He could hear Draco and Madam Pomfrey talking in low murmurs from behind the curtained off cubicle. Harry couldn’t believe how big the baby was now, it wasn’t even going to be too long before he held them in his arms.
“Of course,” Venetia was announcing proudly from the Hufflepuff table across the way, “Daddy says Harry is very keen on initiating courting with me. He’s even considering coming to our Mirabel chalet for the skiing season.”
“If it will make you feel better we can stop along the way and pick up some wine okay?” Harry suggested, his eyes following Draco as the omega moved to pull off the cardigan and walked towards the wardrobe to hang it up.
“Have you bought some things then?” Ginny asked, peering over to the bags that Harry was carrying. Draco tensed as Harry yanked the bags away from the curious red head, he knew full well that one of them contained his bunched up slicked jeans and underwear. “Smells a bit…” Ginny frowned and sniffed the air before her face split into a shark like grin.
“How is your pregnancy going Draco?” Remus asked kindly picking up a mug that smelled like camomile.
Harry smiled softly as he guided Draco back over to the curtained section. “It’s okay, I understand Draco. Why don’t you take that dress off now, you know you’re getting it and you can try the rest of the stuff on.”
“Whatever,” Harry shrugged, “he’s obviously not suffering like I am if he made it to morning lectures.”
“I daresay you might need a little bit of healer help,” Molly smiled kindly at Draco who was perched on the edge of a seat by the fire. Harry was sat on the upholstered chair’s arm and had his arm swung casually behind Draco. “What with you having narrower hips than I ever did,” Molly explained. Draco blushed as he noticed some other party goers listening in on their conversation with interest.
“Baby trapping the great Harry Potter,” Ron huffed a grim laugh as Harry nodded miserably.
There was a loud pop as the bag of cheese and onion crisps exploded in Harry’s hand.
“He’s not my omega,” Harry frowned, “and you’ll see him soon enough.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut in concentration before opening them and finding that a large, frosted snowman had appeared beside Harry. It was nearly as tall as the alpha with a bright orange carrot nose and shining coal buttons.
“Oh dear god,” Hermione breathed out deeply, “you’re actually going through with this?”
Draco nodded and he was wearing a small smile as Harry walked over to the door.
Of course, working out knots on a lower back was several thousand miles removed from offering to rub Draco’s newly swollen breasts, Harry knew that. He glanced back over to Madam Pomfrey, three more bedraggled looking students had seemingly appeared, along with a First Year who couldn’t stop sneezing raisins.
“I d-don’t have a lover!” Draco protested. “I don’t want anybody. I just want my baby,
“You’ve been touching yourself,” Harry rasped, causing Draco to shiver.
Draco wasn’t sure how much time passed before sharp fangs descended into his skin, piercing the flesh. He could hear himself scream although he hadn’t even realised he had opened his mouth, the sound a high and desperate wail as he found himself tripping into another orgasm before the world went dark.
“What are you doing?!” Draco squeaked, causing Harry to freeze and peer down at the omega. Draco’s face seemed to be a mix between scared and affronted and it almost made Harry laugh before he shook his head.
“You’re not angry at us are you?” Remus asked as Harry helped him fold away laundry. Draco was taking an afternoon nap whilst Sirius had popped out for takeaway.
Harry drew back and stared at the evidence of his own release before grimacing. He quickly detached the shower head and sprayed the wall until it was clean. The last thing he wanted was Draco smelling anything like that when he used the bathroom after Harry.
“Mm,” Draco snuffled before falling quiet. Harry listened to the rise and fall of the younger boy’s body for some time before he too succumbed to sleep.
Draco tensed as he realised that Smith was bringing his mouth down towards Draco’s. Draco scrambled backwards, wincing as the Christmas tree branches dug painfully into his back. One of his mittens had fallen off and he felt himself wrapping his fingers around a nearby branch, the wood rough and strangely warm under his grip.
Draco had evidently already noticed as he was staring at Harry’s reflection with a burning intensity, biting on his reddened lip as his flushed chest heaved. Harry’s eyes flickered downwards before he could stop himself. Draco’s fingers were wrapped painfully tightly around his small, swollen prick, jutting out from underneath his bump. Every time he jerked himself his knuckles would skim the slick puddle on the floor, creating sticky trails that glistened in the candlelight.
The other girl, however, was Narcissa Malfoy. Draco took a sharp breath as he watched his mother smile and put her hands on her hips. Her hair looked a little more yellow than usual here and was evidently wet as if she had been swimming. A moment later, the young Sirius winked at the camera before revealing the large, snapping crab he had in his hands and rushing with it towards the suddenly shrieking pair of girls.
“Ungh,” Draco whined, looking a little like he was in pain. The omega’s fingers gripped tightly onto the edge of the bed. “Y-Yes, I think that’s doing something.”
“Seamus said it wasn’t like you to wait when you want something,” Ron carried on obliviously.
“Oh?” Harry whispered, his breath hot and ticklish. “You want my tongue?”
Draco let out a strangled noise before turning away and settling his forehead back on his arms. “How…how can you just
“I mean,” Harry cleared his throat, “of course if Lyra wants to feed again –“
“No, of course!” Harry exclaimed, giving Draco a reassuring smile before backing out through the curtains.
“Yes, apples – your mother couldn’t get enough of them at school. She even used this expensive apple shampoo from Paris, claimed anything else was no better than toilet water,” Remus grinned.
Lyra blinked at him with a pale eyes, wriggling a little under the oversized yellow cap that Madam Pomfrey had tucked over her tuft of dark hair.
A little while later, Draco excused himself to go and get another drink of water. Harry was engaged in a heated discussion with Percy Weasley regarding something to do with beneficiary trusts. Draco smiled as he saw Ron and Hermione playing with Bill and Fleur’s young children. A ginger three year old was attempting to mummify himself in a pixie infested Christmas garland, despite Hermione’s best attempts to distract him with a set of colourful building blocks. Draco smoothed his hand over his bump and wondered if in a few years they would be doing the same with his and Harry’s child? Would Draco even be invited again so as to see it?
Draco nodded in thanks as he hurried to pull on the clothes before wrapping himself in a very large, fluffy buttercup yellow cardigan that smelled like the nice beta.
The bell rang and Draco, having pre-emptively packed his bag, sped for the door before anyone could stop him. The Great Hall was already plenty busy as Draco walked in, however a significant hush fell as he went to take his usual seat.
Harry quickly fetched the low, cushioned chair, setting it facing Draco and sitting down so Harry’s head was level with the omega’s.
“You don’t think I’m good enough?” Draco asked, looking up with irritation.
Harry figured he must have drifted off at some point because the next thing he knew was Draco lightly shaking him awake. Harry blinked groggily, noticing that the fire had fully died down to just glowing embers. “What’s happening?” Harry sat up, immediately concerned something was wrong.
He had read that omega mothers who didn’t normally sport breasts would often grow, potentially even up to an A cup.
Harry swallowed thickly, glancing down as Draco let out a snuffling murmur and burrowed closer to Harry’s chest, as if seeking out his warmth. Harry nodded his thanks as Ron stood up to pass them another fleecy blanket which Harry quickly pulled over Draco, tucking it in underneath his light frame.
Ron made a small squeaking noise.
“Yes,” Draco nodded sleepily, “but I want Lyra.”
Draco nodded tentatively, feeling himself slick further, the scent of his own sweetness mixed in with the comforting pool of the nest was causing his head to go fuzzy.
“You didn’t do anything to worry about or be ashamed of,” Harry sighed, but something in his expression made Draco’s stomach fall.
, he told himself,
do, it’s about feeling good with your partner.”
“I – I want,” Draco whined, “I want you to make love to me, Husband. In our n-new home.”
“Well I haven’t,” Harry retorted, frustratedly, wondering if the rest of his life was going to be spent defending his child’s lineage. He suddenly had a horrible vision of his and Draco’s kid at Hogwarts, being teased about his parents like Draco often was.
Although he wasn’t sure what the vibrations were, he knew it couldn’t be anything to worry about as his alpha was actually giving off feelings of happiness in response. Harry frowned before he realised that the noise was coming from the small omega in his arms.
“Oh wonderful, I’d love to hear some new opinions on a couple of my more recent designs,” she said, clapping her hands together. “Oh but for Circe’s sakes, you’d better both come in before you catch a chill. Deadly this wind is, it’s coming from the north.”
“Draco!” Katie held up her fingers, pressing them against Draco’s lips. “What was the
“No!” Draco interrupted, “It looks just like it, I meant…” Draco chewed his lip, “it probably cost too much.”
“It’s a snow globe creator,” she grinned. “Right now it’s blank, but if you go inside you can start designing your own snow globe. When you’re done you can come on out and get a handheld version that’s an exact replica.”
“It’s fine,” Colum shrugged, “I get it, who the fuck can afford to be a saint nowadays anyway? Although did you say you’re responsible for him? That’s got to be annoying, how many more months until you’re free?”
After Harry had arrived back to Gaedere, he had found that Hermione had already called for Madam Pomfrey, who in turn had summoned an omega specialist from St. Mungo’s. Healer Sweetbridge had performed various scans before informing them that it was a bout of Frettlering Fever, a common ailment amongst pregnant males.
“Harry,” Ron sighed, sitting forwards and putting his can down on the small, foldable camping table between them. “What the hell are you doing with that omega?”
“Actually,” Harry swallowed, fidgeting with the sprig of flowers in his button hole. “This house, it’s um, it’s a wedding gift.”
“You hid his wand, right?” Harry hissed.
“Look at you, Draco. Merlin, you’re so good, letting me take care of you like this,” Harry whispered hotly against the blushing shell of Draco’s ear. Harry’s right hand trailed further down to splay across Draco’s stomach. “Carrying my baby, you’re going to be the sweetest mother and I promise Daddy will always look after you.”
“Oh Merlin, not ‘Mr. Potter’, please,” Harry laughed, shaking his head. “That makes me sound ancient, ‘Harry’ is fine.”
was he saying? As if to try and prove a point, he held up his own large hands despite Draco not being able to see them through the curtain.
“Oh dear,” Hermione laughed, “that does sound like a pickle. I thought you and Harry bought some maternity wear in London?”
Draco groaned as he realised he had completely forgotten they could do that, it’s what he should have done the moment he knew he was lost.
Harry seemed to snap out of his daze, pushing back inside Draco. This new angle caused Draco to groan and throw his arm over his face, it was deeper and somehow now on every thrust, Harry was rubbing the most sensitive part of him.
is a decorative throw you ignorant banana,” Olive retorted despairingly.  “What
Draco squirmed slightly, he knew that Ginny Weasley would also be there on Boxing Day and whilst apparently there were no hard feelings between her and Harry, Draco couldn’t help but still feel a little uncomfortable around the fierce and accomplished woman.
“Merlin,” Ron yawned, stretching up and cracking his back from side to side. “our DADA coursework next term is being organised along with the Auror Programme.”
Harry huffed, pushing her off of him with his foot and causing Ginny to giggle and roll over on the bed.
Oh yeah, he was completely screwed.
Harry winced, he knew Draco’s pregnancy was going to be revealed within the next week or so. Omega scents changed quickly to reflect their fertile status.
Draco let out a horrified gasp, everyone knew that sugarplum silk had to be dipped in cold honey water in order to be cleaned.
Harry winced as Ron pulled a sympathetic face. “She is right mate, it’s pretty bloody weird. I mean, what are you gonna do? You’ll have a kid!”
“She stayed friends with me,” Snape nodded. “Even though I made some…mistakes.”
“Good day Mr. Potter,” Snape smiled again, it was actually becoming a little unnerving, as he turned to stalk out of the herb garden before pausing. “Oh and you may want to check your hair, I believe there are several cockchafers using it as a nest.”
“I’m sorry, it’s the shirt,” Harry explained, “I was wearing it in the club and there were a lot of people in there.”
he should have stuck with sleeves. No one could accuse someone of being a wanton whore when they were wearing a good pair of sleeves.
Draco’s chest was puffed up with two small breasts crowned by rosy pink nipples. Just like below his right ear, there was a group of three small freckles on the swell of his right breast in a perfect constellation line.
“I’ll get it right,” Seamus grumbled, his face paling as he noticed Filch approaching them whilst aggressively wielding a mop.
“Okay!” Damien beamed, rocking on his tiptoes. “Can we walk this way?” he pointed in the opposite direction to Harry and Draco’s compartment. “Only that’s the direction I was going in when I ran into you.”
Draco shuffled nervously as he and Harry stood outside a wide metal door, having rung the bell a minute ago. The building was a sandy coloured brick and looked like a warehouse, large and industrial with a few big arched windows. The smells of the nearby Thames were funnelled down the quiet side street which, due to the tall buildings, was relatively sheltered from the December wind.
child being seen by someone else in um…that. Not that you’re her child…just…”
There was resounding response of excited squeals and Ron’s groan of relief as everybody hurried forwards.
was okay, so long as it felt good and they were comfortable with each other.
“You going to have a proper wedding?” Ron questioned, “Mum’ll always let you use the Burrow if you like.”
“Steady,” Ron warned under his breath, disguising it as a cough. Harry felt fucking furious, what right did any of these people have to start talking about an omega they didn’t even know like that? Besides, it wasn’t even true, now that Harry had seen Draco without a tear stained face and bloodshot eyes, the omega was actually quite pretty. His white blond hair had turned shiny from the prenatal potions and since Harry and Madam Pomfrey had been forcing him to eat better, Draco’s face had rounded out a little. His features were sharper than most omegas but it just served to make him look more elegant and refined, like some sort of aristocratic lordling.
“Firstly,” Hermione muttered darkly, “Molly was the same age as Draco when she was bitten,”
Draco’s cauldron was still bubbling happily away in the corner. His latest project came from one of Sev’s diaries and was linked to a seemingly self composed spell. Draco had interpreted as much of the theory as he could from his godfather’s faded calligraphy but it seemed the spell was to prevent someone from feeling alone.
“Well,” Harry coughed and looked a little awkward, “as much as I detest Bellatrix Lestrange, I do have to admit I perhaps wouldn’t like having to imagine
to you, I didn’t touch you intimately in any way.”
I want to bond with you okay?”
“Hermione and I,” Draco paused thoughtfully. What
“You have,” Katie smiled softly, “we’re all so proud of you Draco.”
“Why?” Katie scrunched up her face, “Your last NEWT was yesterday, you do realise the beauty of that is
“You alright doing this?” Harry frowned as he turned to Draco.
Draco took a large enough sip to make his eyes sting before he looked back at Harry.
“Where will you go?” Hermione asked, reaching across Harry to grab the nearest pitcher of pumpkin juice.
Eventually, Draco emerged back up as Harry helped the omega shift into his lap.
“I see,” Harry grinned, “well I’ll catch you later then.”
“You okay?” Harry asked as he cautiously reached out one hand, stopping a couple of inches away from Draco’s goosepimpled skin.
Pomfrey pulled back the curtains, plastic hooks running along the overhead bar. Harry’s eyes immediately fell on the occupant of the bed. The omega was small and thin, probably too thin as his collarbones cut sharply across his milk white skin where the medical gown gaped open. His hair was a silver blond and his wide eyes were a pale grey fanned with fair lashes.
“I’m sorry,” Harry apologised with a friendly smile, trying to make sure he wasn’t giving off any intimidating pheromones. The boy was more petite than Draco and Harry was very aware of his own large size.
“Oh wow, I
“Just a little taster before our wedding,” Harry grinned, rubbing his nose against Draco’s, “only by then hopefully you’ll be able to dance.”
Draco smiled and gave a muffled reply through Katie’s hand, “Never compare answers with Hermione Granger.”
Draco flinched guiltily.
“Just go talk to her,” Harry grinned, stroking the stubble on his chin. Ron and Hermione had been dating for four years now. However, recently Hermione had been floating around the idea of doing an internship with the U.S. Ministry of Magic after graduating.
“I-“ Draco began, swallowing nervously, “I think so. I’d like to be a parent and I’m b-being allowed to get my NEWTS which is important to me too.”
“That’s not,” Harry huffed, “we were never exclusive Gin,
Draco knew that most of the alphas in his year at school were always going on about the pertness of Damien Tuppence’s bottom. The other omega probably had baby smooth skin and not a bit of dimpled flesh in sight. Ginny Weasley was a professional athlete, Draco remembered mournfully, the red head was bound to be svelte and toned. Currently, Draco was feeling a bit like a stick insect with engorged wobbly bits.
, just tell me alright? I could never look my future child in the eye if I knew I hadn’t done the right thing by their papa.”
that he hadn’t been here when Draco fell ill. His inner alpha was in a terrible strop with Harry for the mistake and now was desperate to try and comfort the suffering omega in any way.
“Spoiled?” Harry frowned, peering over at Draco’s dress.
“You have more?” Draco asked urgently. Bellatrix had told Draco that most of his family albums had been lost in an auror raid and what little Draco had of his mother, he treasured dearly.
Draco stared at his alpha in surprise, he hadn’t realised they were going to have a proper wedding ceremony as well as a mating. Bellatrix looked between the two of them for a moment before letting out an angry hiss, flying to her feet and storming out of the café.
“Well,” Harry cleared his throat, “I would love it if we stayed for a while longer. I think you’d really like the rescue penguin section, you can buy a bucket of fish to feed them. However, the last thing I want is for you to be walking around cold and uncomfortable. I don’t think cleaning charms work very well on…
“I think I might just sit it out,” Harry sighed, hoping everyone wouldn’t give him too much grief about it. “I promised Draco I’d help him revise for History of Magic.”
Harry, however, evidently caught it as he looked over to Draco with a knowing expression. “Tired?”
“Don’t get too excited, I’m not your omega,” Ginny smirked.
him!” Harry protested.
“Well I wouldn’t call it dating,” Ginny replied wryly, “and I’m not expecting us to end up married or anything. In fact, I’ve been scouted for the Harpies and you know how fit I think their seeker Angharad Lewis is.”
“Oh my goodness!”
“You’re b-back!” Draco exclaimed, pushing himself up from the seat.
“Autumn first,” Harry murmured absently. It was early October and already the leaves on the trees were changing into dappled hues of red and brown.
“Ah,” Harry winced and rubbed the back of his neck, “you think it’s a bit much yeah? Like ostentatious? I tried to get one exactly like your mum’s. Fleur Weasley’s uncle works with antiques in Paris so –“
“You’re not
“But a whole bunch of people from Fred and George’s year are coming too!” Ron exclaimed. “You know how fit some of Angelina’s friends are. Remember Gabby Baldan? She’s single now.”
, Draco?” Harry added, he sounded amused and when Draco twisted his neck round he could see a wicked gleam in Harry’s eyes.
shoes.”
Draco glanced back in surprise to realise that the party had been set up just by the familiar scenery of the photograph Sirius had given him. There was a thick trunked oak tree and the Great Lake was sparkling in the background.
There it was, Harry grinned. He could feel Draco’s horror through the bond and tried not to let himself laugh.
“That sounds like a brilliant idea,” Harry agreed earnestly.
“Draco my boy, you are growing in my estimation with every passing moment,” Sirius grinned.
“The influx of eastern trade links and the adoption of the magical linear system,” Hermione finished, beaming at Draco.
Once everything was settled, Draco returned from the bathroom to find Harry waiting by his bed. “You could have gotten in b-before me,” Draco told him.
“Wait,” Ginny said, interrupting and causing Harry to glance back down the table. “which one
Harry thrust in one last time before pulling out his fingers and pushing Draco down onto the sheets, gasping and whining. Harry straddled the omega’s face, reaching down to take himself in hand and barrelling towards orgasm with hard, angry strokes. Harry snarled as he felt himself begin to come, spurting ropes and ropes of thick, white come across Draco’s face. Draco coughed as a substantial amount landed in his mouth, the slender column of his throat convulsing as he tried to swallow it all.
Harry was quite excited about that feature himself actually. The shared Gaedere kitchen was more often than not left in a pretty poor state, so whilst Harry enjoyed cooking he didn’t really have anywhere to do it.
Harry smiled contentedly as Draco pulled open his loose hospital gown to reveal a swollen breast with pink nipple. Draco carefully guided Lyra towards the bud before she latched on and happily began to suckle. Draco let out his own sigh of satisfaction, leaning against Harry and pressing a kiss to the alpha’s shoulder.
Harry groaned as he imagined rubbing his hand over Draco’s stomach, caressing him lovingly before travelling further south to pleasure his small omega prick.
“I’ve already done so,” Snape announced with a strained exhaustion.
“Oh it’s just like the Triwizard Cup all over again,” Hermione sighed, firmly grabbing Draco’s hand and leading him over to the Gaedere table.
“I know, I’m sorry, but we have to get your temperature down,” Harry sighed, shifting on the slabs of the bathroom floor. Draco’s eyes were closed and his blond lashes were twitching against his flushed skin.
“Don’t touch me,” Draco hissed, glaring up at the alpha and baring his teeth. Smith, however, just looked surprised for a moment before dissolving into laughter.
“Oh, no,” Draco shook his head, looking a little embarrassed.
“Good,” Harry replied, his face stretching into a wide grin. Draco was still undressed and Harry brought up his hand to rub gently down the omega’s back, his fingers dipping into the notches of his spine.
“So it turns out this heat wave is a worthy opponent for even
“Y-Yes thank you,” Draco replied, nervously eyeing the crowds. Bellatrix had never been much of an advocate for Draco getting to go out on day trips and Rodolphus certainly hadn’t offered to chaperone him. Severus had brought Draco to an Edinburgh apothecary once or twice to stock up on potions ingredients but somehow Draco’s aunt had gotten wind of it and that was the last of those excursions.
Harry picked up a glass from the bedside table before casting aguamenti and holding it out to a still terrified looking Draco.
Harry knew what she was asking but he wasn’t really in a decent enough state to consider his answer. Instead, he shook his head and ended that line of questioning.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, “where I would like to get married. Somewhere with a stone p-patio, the ones that have balustrades and gardens behind and…” he trailed off.
“Sorry, my omega’s pregnant and his lower back is giving him grief,” Harry announced cheerfully.
“That may well be,” Professor McGonagall tipped her head, “but it is the law.”
“I don’t really see why it matters what Mr. Sourboll thinks of me,” Draco stated. “Considering I’ll probably never see him again.”
“Right!” Sirius exclaimed loudly, causing Draco to yelp and drop the rotor. “That’s it,
have to come?” Harry asked as Snape shrieked next to him. Honestly, Harry knew the man wasn’t his biggest fan but his reaction seemed to be a little overboard.
“And secondly, keeping his pregnancy was already a massive decision. Draco is mature enough to know what he wants and if he wants to be with Harry then you’re going to have to get off your stupidly high hippogriff and accept that.”
“Just a headache, Nev,” Harry replied as Colum Tidewell sat down beside them, laughing and panting from having been dancing for a while. Harry could see Ron’s raised eyebrows as his friend made some unsubtle encouraging gestures. Harry tried not to tense as he felt Colum’s thigh press up against his own. The other man was a beta with a tanned complexion, coppery curled hair and hazel eyes.
Harry grimaced and laughed as Draco’s eyes lit up with obvious enthusiasm for this idea. He passed over the necessary coins whilst the lady gave Draco a paper plate to combine all the ingredients on.
“I’m worried people will stare,” Draco admitted, knowing that everybody already did anyway. As was typical of Hermione though, she didn’t scoff or dismiss Draco’s concerns, instead she nodded thoughtfully.
“You look b-beautiful,” Draco smiled at her.
“Fuck no,” Harry replied, “I wasn’t lying when I said that was the best I’ve ever felt and we didn’t even knot.”
“Yup,” Harry nodded, “well, one of them is a peahen but I think you’ll like them, they’re very beautiful, if a little stroppy.” Harry cleared his throat with amusement as Draco narrowed his eyes in a momentary glare.
“Goodnight Harry,” Draco replied as the door closed between them.
“Thirteen of us,” Draco explained as Harry let out a low whistle.
“You made me a cake!” Draco exclaimed, extracting himself from Harry’s arms and waddling over to the table.
“You know Draco got his mock NEWTS results back yesterday,” Hermione shifted on her uncomfortable looking chair that Madam Pomfrey had fished out of a cupboard.
, Draco is still an unmated omega and there is a line that you probably shouldn’t cross if you don’t want to confuse him.”
Draco tried to imagine asking one of the other omegas like Damien to nest or cuddle with him. Evidently his emotions played out on his face as when he looked up both Hermione and Harry were eyeing him critically.
“Oh we are,” Remus said brightly, “We’re staying with a lovely family called the Prices, did you know there’s a sizeable Welsh community in Patagonia?”
Harry groaned as he turned, still topless and with Ginny in his bed to see Seamus awkwardly standing next to a very shocked looking Draco.
Harry fidgeted with the buttons of the burgundy shirt he had bought from Olive’s. The club was densely packed and sweaty and Neville had returned with a teetering tray of their fifth load of shots. The lights were neon and strobing in flickering pulses across the dance floor and charmed decorative bubbles bobbed in the air. If you reached out to burst them you would be showered in a temporary spray of artificial scent enhancer.
A moment later, Severus Snape appeared at the top of the stairs, long black dress robes trailing behind him and a silver brooch in the shape of a sprig of holly pinned to his chest.
“Pregnancy brain I’m guessing,” Katie smirked as Draco blushed. “Plus you’re forgiven on account of being so ridiculously huge. You can definitely tell it’s Potter’s baby in there, you poor thing.”
Draco was panting when he finally looked up, the omega’s face turning horrified as he registered the mess across Harry’s.
“But like you said,” Remus commented sadly, “we don’t get to choose the results of such spells and you Severus, loaded your own grief and resentment onto the shoulders of an eleven year old boy.”
woken up at four in the morning and wanted something like a ham and fudge sundae and I’m not there to get it for him?”
“You are going to have a baby,” Severus stated, although not unkindly, “do you really think you would have time for this?”
“It’s this one,” Draco glared down at his own chest. Whilst his right breast was looking a little smaller already, his left remained a pale, swollen globe, heavy with milk that hadn’t yet released.
,” Draco whispered, looking miserable.
“Never,” Harry replied, looking affronted before winking and adding, “you only ever smell delicious.”
“Not as much as you might think,” Harry’s smile turned fond. “Sometimes I get the impression that Sirius was a bit disappointed I wasn’t more of a rebel, like my dad,” he added softly.
“Merlin, no,” Harry shook his head vociferously, his worst fears confirmed. “Shit, do I really seem like that kind of alpha?”
“What? Don’t you fancy it?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrows. Traditionally every year for Seamus’ birthday they would all apparate down to London and go out to some wizarding club. The night could get pretty raucous and give everybody blackmail material for at least the next year.
“I suppose one of the benefits about bonding with Draco whilst he’s still under your legal alphaship is that you won’t have to get permission from the Lestranges,” Hermione said thoughtfully, sucking on the end of her straw.
There was a knocking on the door as Draco sighed wearily, pondering on how to handle the matter.
“Yeah, well,” Ron shrugged bitterly, “better sooner rather than later when I’m more invested eh?”
“And someone who understands and appreciates my purity,” Damien concluded. “I think omegas who jump into bed with every alpha they see are just the worst aren’t they?”
Draco knew he was producing a large amount of slick, it was running down the back of his thighs and causing squelching noises every time Harry inched forwards a bit more. Draco couldn’t even bring himself to feel embarrassed though, his entire body was alight with the fact that his alpha was inside him. And by the sound of the noises Harry was making, the alpha was pleased with how Draco’s body felt.
“Quidditch pile up,” one boy explained, he was wearing Ravenclaw robes and had a thick trail of mud up one side. “Bernie whacked the bludger and Maisie didn’t see it but Constance did and she called out but by that time Jodie had flown straight into the back of her because the snitch was –“
“So if I remember correctly,” Harry said, turning them off of the main alley and onto a pleasant tree lined avenue, “Percy Weasley’s sister-in-law runs a shop that should be ah!” Harry drew them to a stop outside of a wooden painted store front, “Right here!”
In order to facilitate more cohesive unity between wizarding factions, Hogwarts had been one of the first European schools to start offering four year university level programmes once you had finished your now compulsory seventh year. Harry had been pleased to find that nearly all of his friends also decided to stay for the course. Furthermore, the diploma received at the end of it made it easier to gain higher level entry into the most desirable career paths.
“It’s just,” Draco felt Harry’s other hand curling reassuringly around the back of his neck. “I never had anyone to teach me…I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Draco felt his hackles rise, he was sure if Harry had actively been pursuing an omega then he would have told Draco by now.
Draco may be young but Molly and Arthur had bonded at his age. Harry knew it was a little different as he was older, but surely four years couldn’t be that damning in the grand scheme of things? Although, would Draco even want to bond with Harry? Harry worried that maybe the omega simply tolerated him so as to better support their baby.
Draco nodded, looking pleased that Harry had understood so quickly.
“Right,” Harry said before calling over the waiter and politely asking for the dishes to be taken away, assuring that he would still pay for them. Harry ordered himself a cappuccino and a slice of banana loaf before looking across to Draco.
“What is your problem?” Colum huffed. “Your mates told me you were out looking for some fun?”
Harry had never known an omega to produce quite this much slick, although he certainly wasn’t complaining.
“Real hilarious,” Harry muttered, taking another sip of his beer and reaching for the cheese and onion.
“L-Like you?” Draco asked bitterly, trying to struggle free but very aware of not hurting his bump.
“Um, I’m going to guess from yours and Draco’s reaction that that’s bad?” Harry ventured.
“Y-You can turn around now,” Draco said after a minute. Harry hesitated before looking back into the room. Draco was now fully dressed in a navy corduroy smock with dark tights and blue plimsolls.
“My dad actually,” Harry beamed, “but I’ve been told we look alike.”
“Not really my type,” Harry shrugged. He supposed that was true, he normally went for stronger looking builds, people who exuded confidence and were up for some fun, like Ginny or Justin Finch-Fletchley. The last omega Harry had been with had been a cousin of Fleur’s, however, and Harry guessed that she had looked like the perfect vision of an omega in every way.
“Y-Yes Daddy,” Draco mumbled, wrapping his mouth around Harry’s cock and moving his head slowly down. Draco still struggled to take all of the alpha into his mouth but Harry loved every earnest attempt. Hollowed cheeks massaged his dick as Draco’s tongue pulsed and moved as if still unsure what to do with itself.
He nodded goodbye to the two men before strolling back up towards the castle. Harry paused when he realised he had forgotten to ask Snape which vial contained the stabilisation potion and which the feverfew elixir. He knew Draco would probably be able to figure it out but it didn’t hurt to be certain. He jogged back down towards the walled herb garden, pausing by a topiary box shrub of a phoenix as he heard Snape and Remus still conversing.
“The who?” Harry frowned, looking bemused.
Harry shifted his hips, marvelling at the contrast between his fabric covered body and Draco’s bare form. The friction had already caused red clouded patches across the omega’s creamy skin. Harry ducked down to kiss where he could and Draco wailed at the change in angle. Harry felt the omega’s walls contract and pulse.
“For you, Daddy,” Draco agreed, leaning down to nuzzle their noses together. Harry sat them both back up, wrapping Draco in his arms and helping the younger man to move without becoming tired. Every time he fell back on Harry’s cock, Draco let out a high pitched moan. Harry flicked his thumbs over Draco’s pebbled nipples, staring in rapt appreciation as Draco’s cock bounced rhythmically.
“Merlin, no!” Harry shook his head quickly. “I’m not thinking of doing that.” He shivered, having heard nothing good from Percy Weasley about the way omegas were treated by the legal system.
There was absolutely nothing wrong with sexually confident omegas. Harry thought everybody should be allowed to explore their own appetites and sexualities free of any stupid stigma. In fact, if you had asked him before, that would have been the type that Harry would usually go for. However now, the way Damien had been trying to impress him just seemed so silly and contrived compared to the painfully genuine manner in which Draco conducted himself.
Harry gasped as Draco let out a loud moan and a jet of sticky white milk spurted from his left breast, splattering across Harry’s face.
Remus smiled softly as his eyes flicked to Sirius.
?” Sirius frowned, looking incredulous. Draco stared between them all in utter confusion.
“Make a wish!” Ron instructed, peering over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco snorted a laugh, smiling shyly back at Harry.
“I think y-you should buy that shirt,” Draco said, almost too quickly to be intelligible before disappearing back behind the curtain.
Draco shuddered, pushing the bowl of green soup away from him, pretty sure he couldn’t even stomach a spoonful of it now.
Hermione reached to pick one of them up as a burst of music rippled across the grove,
“He’s the pointy little ferret faced one,” Dean smiled like a Cheshire Cat, “looks like he thinks he’s better than everyone.”
This new position, however seemed to have allowed Draco to finally get better access to himself as he let out a sigh of hiccoughing relief. Harry closed his eyes and tried to think about literally anything else. He could do this, he could get through this if it meant looking after Draco. He could only hope that Draco’s memory of the night would be hazy enough so as to not cause him any unnecessary mortification.
“Right then,” Harry nodded decisively, “Sorry Ron but I’m probably going to trust Hermione and Draco.”
“How about I take you shopping?” Harry offered, slightly surprised at himself for voluntarily suggesting an activity he normally avoided like the plague.
,” Harry snarled as Smith’s shit eating grin dissolved into panic. Harry tugged Draco against his chest as the alpha raised his wand and sent Smith flying backwards, landing in a sprawled heap on the snowy path.
“Are what?” Harry frowned, already knowing he was going to feel angry.
“What is it?” Harry asked, looking at the witch who was clearly some sort of vendor.
“Don’t listen to these pillocks,” Sirius told Draco, picking up the set of wooden slats. “We’ll get this fixed in no time, pass me that glass rod would you?”
Harry hissed as he felt a bulbous knot form at the base of his dick, swelling rapidly as he continued milking himself, drenching the trembling omega beneath him in his scent and seed. When he could hold himself up no longer, Harry collapsed boneless on the bed, tugging Draco in close and wiping his face clean, placing apologetic kisses across his pink stained skin.
Harry’s head reappeared a moment later, his cheeks flushed and his brow looking decidedly damp. “There’s a big wet patch,” Harry murmured, “Draco – I –“
“Okay,” Harry frowned, wondering where this was going.
“You do look just like her,” Remus gave a small laugh, “you have the same scent too.”
“I think he was waiting for the weekend,” Hermione cleared her throat. “You know they’ve got the Winter Wonderland festival on in Hogsmeade.”
“You want something else?” Harry asked, knowingly, a wicked glint in his green eyes. “
“Well,” another of their year piped up, “everyone knew Venetia’s family were in talks with Harry Potter regarding a potential courtship.”
“Draco,” Harry smiled, “this is
That was what Ron had said whilst cracking open another beer. Harry glanced up to see Draco still staring at him, his lips open now and small, relieved breaths puffing into the air every time some more milk came out. But what if Harry didn’t want to confuse Draco? What if he just wanted the omega to be his, properly his?
“Because I want you to know what I’m feeling,” Harry replied, his thumbs digging in and massaging the meat of Draco’s parted buttocks. “I want you to know what you do to me.”
“So underwear was too visible but you still managed to conceal your wand?” Harry asked, raising a thick eyebrow as Draco flushed and bit his lip on a smile. The omega twirled his wrist and Draco’s patronus appeared. An elegant white peacock who seemed to eye Harry rather disdainfully before strutting through the still closed doorway with Draco’s request to ask Katie to bring up spare clothes and leave them outside the room.
“He mentioned you, of course he had heard about your…
“However,” Harry said nervously, “you would have to want me too.”
Draco shivered and whined, pawing at Harry’s shirt and dislodging his flower button hole. Tiny white petals stuck to Draco’s damp hands and then his cheeks as he hid his face with his fingers.
“I guess,” Harry replied, feeling secretly very relieved. He really loved Molly Weasley and it would be terrible to have disappointed her.
Draco didn’t respond right away but Harry could see thin tear tracks down his own white cheeks. When Draco did speak, his voice was wobbly with emotion. “I love you Harry.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Remus said quietly, “I wasn’t accusing Draco of anything. I’ll admit at first I thought perhaps with your innate sense of honour maybe you had simply stepped up to the plate when another alpha had run for the hills.”
“She didn’t feel tiny coming out of me,” Draco grouched as Harry rumbled a laugh, wincing apologetically as Lyra paused in her nursing to stare at him. Harry had had no idea that a newborn could look so indignant.
The other man had taken off his glasses, further highlighting the green of his eyes. Harry had shaved recently but now was sporting dark five o clock stubble on his light brown skin.
“You smell happy,” Katie remarked, her eyes sparkling with mirth, “apple pie all round.”
“Yeah,” Sirius nodded, a little more softly now. He sat down on a nearby armchair, Draco absently noticed that it had a lever attached as if to turn it into a more reclined position. “We got on pretty well as kids. You can keep that photo if you want. I’ve got loads that I never look through.”
Harry flipped the covers back and rummaged around for some clothes, grateful that he’d had the mind to at least put some boxers back on last night.
Draco looked back up, chewing anxiously on his lip as a stunning red headed woman made herself comfortable on Harry’s lap. Draco had seen her with the alpha before, the two of them exuding power and confidence. Perhaps Potter didn’t even like omegas? Even if he did he certainly wouldn’t be interested in Draco.
“No,” Harry, scraped his hand down his face, dislodging his glasses. “It’s not – I didn’t mean it like that.”
Draco cried out, threading his fingers through Harry’s black hair, pulling hard enough to hurt. It felt amazing but Draco’s body and inner omega was craving more. Now that he knew this was
Currently, Draco was sitting on the big squidgy armchair in the Morgana Suite with his feet tucked underneath him. Harry, Hermione and Ron were spread out across the other pieces of furniture comparing lecture notes.
that fox is Katie’s when she chooses to make it corporeal.” Harry explained. “Oh gosh, there’s Luna’s hare!”
“Even if he did, there’s no way Potter would let Draco stay pregnant,” someone drawled apathetically from their table. Draco knew it was probably Blaise, an alpha in his year. “Can you imagine the shame?”
Draco waddled down the school corridor. The last three months had absolutely flown by in a complete exam panic. He hadn’t even had much free time to spend doing fun things with Harry due to revision demands. This was another reason why having the bond had been so brilliant, Draco felt reassuringly connected to his alpha no matter where they were or what they were doing.
“I know that,” Harry said, “but I just feel like I
“And I can see that you’ve already got a good number of my clothes on there,” Harry nodded, “so surely it smells like a mixture of the two of us?”
“Is that what you’d like?” Harry asked, grinning, reaching up to move them around, Harry still almost fully clothed in his suit whilst Draco sat exposed and naked atop of him. The omega’s chest was rising and falling in puffed pants of air. Harry sat up further, pressing his mouth against Draco’s ear and whispering hotly.
“I’ll come back later then,” the man snapped, taking a wary step back as Harry began to bare his teeth. Olive shot Harry an apologetic look before hurrying the man downstairs.
“Thank you,” Harry said before glancing up at Snape, “you said you wanted to give Draco something?”
Draco gasped silently, clutching at his belly. He knew that some people suspected he had somehow magically bewitched Harry into sleeping with him but the suggestion that a potion might damage the baby hit far too close to home. Draco was fully hugging himself now as the corridor remained clogged up with confused students. Somewhere in the fray, Draco could hear Professor Flitwick’s voice shouting about a spare classroom on the sixth floor.
The picture showed a young woman with almost white hair, standing out on a balcony overlooking grand formal gardens. It looked like it was probably part of some manor house. The woman was laughing and leaning back against the balustrade as the breeze caught her blond locks. She was wearing a dress almost identical to the one Draco was in, only hers was perhaps more lilac in colour. She also had on glittering, expensive looking jewellery and her hair was in loose waves behind her shoulders.
Draco whimpered as Harry blew a gentle breath of air across the omega’s hole, the wrinkled furl contracting and gaping in turn.
“I’m just warning you!” Damien exclaimed indignantly as a few compartment doors slid open and people poked their heads out. “How do you know it’s even yours? Magical signatures can be faked!”
“Sour, pickled ginger caramel?” the lady grinned, throwing a wink at Harry. “I’m not sure those would sell all that well on a confectionary trolley love, I reckon you’re having a craving aren’t you?”
“Oi,” Sirius called from the kitchen, “can we come back now? Only I want to get on with the day and you know how ratty Remus gets when his parsnips are overcooked.”
“I’m not,” Harry replied, “sorry you were misinformed. I just came to celebrate my friend’s birthday.”
“My b-baby,” Draco murmured anxiously before the world slipped into darkness.
“June fifth,” a dark and furious voice announced from behind Draco, causing Bella to fall silent and snap her gaze up. Draco squirmed as the pervasive alpha scent of bonfire and cinnamon saturated their area of the café.
“You don’t know me,” Draco replied, his nose wrinkling up. “Aunt Bella says I’m difficult and s-stroppy.”
. I know you can do this. You’re going to get to meet our baby sweetheart, you’re going to be a papa.”
“I think I m-might like to be called Papa,” Draco told them shyly. He fixed Harry with an earnest expression. ‘You could be Daddy?”
“Yeah?” Harry looked up brightly.
“Oh f-fuck,” Draco whined, squeezing his eyes tightly shut and trying to focus on not coming too soon. He knew Harry wouldn’t mind but Draco wanted to hold on to this current thread of pleasure for as long as possible.
“I know I d-don’t have any occasion to wear it,” Draco whispered, turning back to Harry and smoothing out the front of the dress self consciously.
. They’d never do anything to hurt me and they certainly don’t hate you Draco. I don’t see how anyone could to be honest.”
The younger boy let Harry lick along the seam of his mouth, parting his lips enough to delve his tongue inside, hot and searching. Draco’s own tongue pressed against him, sloppy inexperienced movements that set Harry’s heart on fire and made his bones ache with want.
Draco looked out across the Great Hall from an empty corner of the Slytherin table. He had been pushing the peas around on his plate for the last ten minutes. Finally, the doors swung open and the Gaedere students came traipsing in, laughing and talking.
Even so, Harry didn’t want a single bit of their ceremony to not be how Draco wanted it, so it was imperative he try to get the omega to confidently voice his opinions.
Harry had spent the last few months trying to imagine a future where he was bonded with someone else, only seeing Draco through the doorway as their child was dropped off at weekends or something. He
“That selfish spell is the reason Harry now has a mate and child,” Severus let out a jolted awkward laugh.
“Bloody hell, I’m not looking forward to my hangover tomorrow morning,” Ron groaned, slumping into the armchair next to Harry. Ron’s face was flushed nearly as fiery as his copper hair and Harry could see that his friend was shooting furtive looks across at Hermione.
“Was,” Harry cleared his throat, not wanting to sound rude but also desperately wanting to just forget all about this and go crawl back into his bed, “was there anything else Professor?”
“What list?” Ginny snapped, her eyes zeroing in on a suddenly very nervous looking Dean.
“We should have put a towel down,” Harry laughed, “although with how wet you get I don’t think it would have made much of a difference.”
“Um, actually,” Harry cleared his throat as Nadia turned to leave. Harry turned to make sure Draco was comfortably sitting back down with his treats before he gestured for him and Nadia to go into the corridor.
Harry awoke the next morning feeling at absolute peace. He glanced down to find Draco pushed up against his side with one leg hooking over Harry’s thigh. The other boy looked so tranquil and sweet, his blond hair in disarray and his lips slightly parted. Harry permitted himself a few more minutes of revelling in the sensations of having a content omega in his arms before he heard a low rumbling noise.
“I’ll give you a moment,” Olive whispered, patting Harry on the shoulder before getting up from the sofa and disappearing quietly down the stairs. Somewhere in the background Harry registered the bluebird trilling again.
“I’d prefer that,” Draco agreed, sitting fully upright and smiling.
“How come?” Harry asked. “You might regret it if you wait till the baby comes, didn’t Olive say this was a unique piece? It’ll probably be gone by then.”
the covers.
“I like it when you eat,” Harry hurried to reassure him, “I mean, I don’t want you to feel ill but it’s good to know you’re getting enough sustenance.”
Eventually, both Ron and Hermione went to bed, bidding Harry and Draco a good night and that they would see them in the morning before everybody began their journeys home.
However, after Crabbe had presented as an alpha, his parents had transferred him to Durmstrang in order to try and make a new start, hopefully resulting in a good mating arrangement. Goyle had followed soon after, which had stung Draco slightly but he couldn’t begrudge that Greg had probably always been closer to Vince than he had Draco.
“Are you?” Draco gaped.
those things?”
and spoke at length on what a shame it was,” Bellatrix eyes went slightly misty as she probably envisioned the grand plans she had had for Draco’s future. “Apparently though, he could be persuaded to overlook your little slipup. Turns out he really was quite taken with you that Beltane – you remind him of his first wife.”
“I think left,” Draco replied.
“I might do,” Harry laughed, “what’s in it for me?”
“He hasn’t actually,” Draco frowned, “we said we would decide when the baby arrived, see what they suited.”
“It’s alright,” Harry spoke through the hanging fabric, “I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it – what exactly are you trying to do?”
“Y-Yes,” Draco replied, whining as Harry lowered his hips so the thick jut of his now erect cock pressed a tacky line along Draco’s belly. “Wanted you here Alpha.”
“Hello Lyra,” Harry smiled, starting as a splash of moisture dropped down onto his baby’s face. He realised a moment later that it had come from him, as another teardrop rolled down his nose. Harry chuckled tiredly at himself, removing his glasses and wiping at his eyes as Lyra made another gurgling noise. “Your poor papa is having a little rest,” Harry told his daughter, “you took your time coming out you know?”
“I w-wasn’t an ugly baby!” Draco protested, although he didn’t actually have any evidence to prove otherwise.
“I mean it’s just the mocks and the real things as we know are much tougher and…” Hermione trailed off upon seeing Ron’s and Harry’s expressions. “Right, okay, yes, he did very well and if he feels up to it you should probably take him to Winter Wonderland.”
Harry resumed his task with enthusiasm, Draco’s slick was like ambrosia feeding his own arousal until he felt like he might burst. Harry groaned as he laid himself down against the bed, allowing himself to rut against the friction the sheets provided, whilst continuing to eat Draco out. Harry’s thick tongue wiggled and thrust in and out of Draco’s hole whilst the omega squirmed and thrashed, trying to lift his hips back further, seeking his own mindless pleasure.
Harry froze as the younger boy let out a low moan, quite unlike the other sounds he had been emitting so far. Draco’s eyes widened and his mouth fell open as he stared at Harry in shock. “I…I – “ Draco gaped.
Draco’s cheeks flushed crimson before he scurried back over to the other side of the room and began fussing with unpacking things from his trunk and hanging them up in the wardrobe. Harry noticed that Draco didn’t seem to have many items with him.
“Makes sense that Narcissa was so happy during exams,” Sirius muttered, “Her, Remus and Snivellus always got top marks.”
“Oh yeah, this suite is actually one of the rooms meant for couples or pregn…” Harry trailed off, eyeing Draco critically as the omega stared back him. “Actually, where are you rooming now?”
“You do,” Harry readily agreed, loving it whenever Draco showed some confidence. He had recently found that the little omega was more willing to share newfound aspects of his personality with Harry. There were wonderful flashes of snark or sarcasm, along with a steadily growing sense of self belief that Harry had been doing his utmost to help nurture.
“I do,” Draco nodded, trying to hide his blush behind the swathes of green knit. He hadn’t quite been able to look Harry in the eye since the incident in the bedroom the previous day. Draco was 99% sure that Harry Potter had seen his naked bottom and unfortunately, due to lots of strenuous twisting to observe his own behind in the bathroom mirror not ten minutes later, Draco was also 99% sure that he was sporting a fair bit of cellulite and stretch marks thanks to his pregnancy, along with some hormonal pimples.
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise that Harry was interested. “I stay in one of the Slytherin omega dorms,” Draco told him.
Harry ushered Draco back into the changing room, winking at the omega before pulling the curtain shut.
“Mm hm,” Draco nodded, not trusting himself to speak as he tried to process what Harry had been saying right before Seamus interrupted.
,” Remus sighed, closing his eyes as if gathering strength.
The door opened up with a cool gust of air a moment later.
“Are you okay sweetheart?” Harry asked, pressing his lips carefully against each pale eyelid before Draco finally opened his eyes again. Harry frowned as he noticed Draco was shaking, he quickly sat up and ran his hands down Draco’s arms before reaching for the blankets to cover him. “Draco?” Harry started to panic, had he gone too fast? Had he hurt the omega in some way?
“So, do you like it?” Harry asked, turning back round to see Draco smiling dreamily up at the patterned ceiling. An aged fresco of constellations adorned the exposed surface, dry powder pigments in hues of blue illustrated astrological charts overlaying alabaster stars.
“Oh, of course sweetpea!” Katie exclaimed, a pleased flush colouring her cheeks. “I’ll just grab my dress and come to your room in a moment.”
“Sweetheart?” Harry asked, his voice already hoarse with desire. “You remember I said I wanted to take you in my mouth? Well, how would you feel about me using my mouth here?”
“Won’t mind that I’ve got a pregnant omega back home?” Harry asked drily, hoping his voice sounded as unimpressed as he felt.
“Where would you like to go first?” Harry asked Draco, handing him a beautifully illustrated map of all the event’s facilities and attractions.
The omega’s grey eyes darted between Ginny and Harry, his face growing progressively redder before Draco turned and fled from the room.
The thing was, they were both right. Harry knew that Draco was inexperienced and whilst he didn’t want to rush him, bonding bites always took better if they were administered during a mating. Harry wanted Draco to feel comfortable, yet on the other hand, his inner alpha was practically chomping at the bit now. Every time Draco smiled or looked Harry’s way, the older man felt like he was drowning in the desire to mount the perfect little omega carrying his pup.
Draco squirmed awkwardly, the necklace did look very expensive. He had honestly expected Harry to give him something for the baby, so it had come as a shock to realise this was most certainly just meant for Draco.
A charmed paper plane jabbed Draco in the cheek, jerking him from his thoughts. The sharp point continued to nudge him, resulting in a stinging paper cut until Draco finally snatched the contraption from the air. Thankfully, Flitwick hadn’t noticed anything amiss, still turned with his back to the class and chalking something up on the blackboard.
Harry bit his lip, he knew that omegas liked to be praised by their alphas and it seemed that Draco was particularly affected by it.
Draco gasped as he recognised the descriptors of his own scent. Before he could back away however, the door was jerked open.
“I take it we’re not going to Ursula White’s Yule party this year either?” Harry grinned wryly as Sirius let out a snort.
. So how about tonight we crack open some beers, wheel out the last barbeque of the year and pretend like…” Ron trailed off
“What do you mean?” Harry huffed, “He’s going to be the mother of my child, I think it’s only natural to want to be close.”
“Oh stop, Muriel,” the third woman sighed. “Harry Potter is a fine young man and we shouldn’t be gossiping about him like this. I’m sure he’ll grow bored of the Malfoy child soon enough and realise there are better matches out there.”
“That’s settled then,” Harry beamed. “You free tomorrow? Or there’s always next Saturday?”
Draco groaned before frowning down at Harry’s trousers, hurriedly attempting to undo the buttons.
Harry’s mouth went dry as his gaze lingered on the unmarked juncture between Draco’s neck and shoulder, right where a mating bite would go. The skin was so white and creamy, with the three recognisable dark freckles. Harry couldn’t stop himself from moving one of his own hands to rub the back of Draco’s neck, just to see the satisfying contrast in their complexions.
“Harry?”
It had been incredibly awkward, Draco would stand stiffly and try his hardest not to look at Harry whilst the other man splayed a large, warm hand over his still flat belly. Thankfully, Draco’s utter humiliation and nerves mitigated any potential embarrassing bodily reactions that he might have otherwise had with a handsome alpha that he liked touching him.
“I’ve already repeated it,” Harry sighed, “twice.”
“I had to get you in an ice bath,” Harry began, “to cool your temperature. You were pretty out of it but I promise I left your underwear on. I was just worried Draco, you were burning up and the healer said it was the fastest way. You started showing signs of going through a semi-heat but I
Draco nodded, “Yes, but I’m an omega so Bellatrix is in charge of the account.”
He was, but maybe not as much as Harry was thinking. A large part of Draco still hadn’t reconciled the fact that he was actually pregnant with the Victorian sensibilities he had been brought up with. The idea of brazenly asking the alpha to touch him seemed just far too humiliating and shameful. However, despite whatever Madam Pomfrey’s book said about trimesters and touch, Draco had very much been craving physical contact for the last two weeks already.
“Maybe they should,” Harry snapped.
“Potter was a fool,” Snape scoffed and it took Harry a moment before anger set in as he realised Snape was referring to his father. “He was taking unnecessary risks, throwing himself, and by extension, Lily, into danger at every given opportunity. Never one to shy away from playing the hero or grabbing the spotlight.”
Draco kept walking for about five minutes before admitting he was completely lost and disorientated. He could still hear shouts and laughs from other people in the maze but every time he tried to travel towards them, they seemed to fade away.
After a hearty meal of different dishes from various stalls, everyone decided on tackling the Christmas Tree Maze. Seamus informed them that if you managed to reach the centre of the maze you would be able to pick a mystery box present from underneath the central tree, which was also the only one that would be decorated with ornaments and lights.
“What have you eaten this morning?” Harry asked, picking up his plate and moving to sit next to Draco as the table was now nearly fully vacated.
“Yeah, they want us to be prepared,” Harry answered. Colum had sat back further in the seat next to him, arching his neck as he fanned himself with his t-shirt, letting it gape open to reveal his glistening caramel skin. Colum was twenty-four and worked for the Department of Magical Creatures, Harry had been informed that he owned his own place in Pimlico and enjoyed playing amateur quidditch with his local team.
“Good,” Harry nodded, ushering Draco inside. “This is the Morgan Le Fay Suite by the way. Don’t worry, me, Ron and Hermione have somewhat claimed it, so we won’t be bothered.”
“Well if they’re anything like you as an infant I would imagine the moniker ‘squashed mango’ wouldn’t go amiss,” Severus stated drily as Draco’s mouth fell open in indignation.
Suddenly the door blasted open and Draco let out a small cry of surprise, jerking his head round. Harry was standing in the doorway, absolutely drenched and with a good deal of mud caked to his trousers and even his sleeves.
“Yeah, so have we,” Harry laughed, following her into the store with Draco close beside him.
ARE YOU MORONS DOING? YOU CAN’T FIRE A SPELL AT A PREGNANT PERSON!”
“I do?” Draco asked, his eyes widening. It wasn’t unheard of for omegas to inherit one of their parents’ scents but it was quite unusual, especially if the child wasn’t raised by them.
Harry shook his head as Ron and Hermione made noises of protest. “I don’t mean I think he’s still quivering in fear every time he sees my face. But just, because of
“Maybe he’s done a runner,” Sirius remarked brightly in Harry’s ear. “Finally realised he can do better than someone who leaves the toilet seat up and thinks that savoury muffins are acceptable.”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry frowned.  Olive will have told him there was an omega changing up here. He shouldn’t have come up the stairs in the first place.”
“It’s okay alpha,” Draco grinned, “I like that you’re so possessive.”
“Ooh, what about Hagrid’s Hut?” Harry said brightly as Draco’s eyes widened warily. “I reckon we could string some fairy lights up around the guttering.”
“Shall we put them out of their misery?” Harry whispered questioningly to Draco, who nodded before grabbing Harry’s hand.
“Yes!” Draco nodded enthusiastically, “And the Beowulf ones, they had different runes due to –“
“I can assure you that you were,” Severus drawled, “luckily the years have been kind to you.”
“My grandfather designed it,” the woman beamed, “One of a kind patent, you won’t find anything like it at any other festival.”
“You should get to bed then,” Harry stood up before reaching down to help Draco out of the armchair. They had previously joked that if everybody left without doing so, Draco would be helplessly stuck there all night.
“Never say no to chocolate,” Harry grinned before giving Draco a quick squeeze. “Do you want anything?”
“Knickers kept showing through the silk,” Draco explained, fidgeting a little shyly. Harry’s breath caught as the moonlight filtered in through the windows, kissing Draco’s exposed pale skin. Slowly, the omega dropped back down to his knees, crawling on top of Harry and settling on his lap.
“To go with your dress,” Harry had mumbled as his godfathers stared wide eyed at the necklace before whistling loudly.
“You okay?” Harry asked as Draco fidgeted with the magazines he had stacked on the coffee table.
After about five minutes, Madam Pomfrey was still dealing with various injuries, the ankle having turned out to be fractured in several places and not just sprained after all. Harry heard a distressed whine from inside the cubicle.
Harry was dressed in luxurious looking black robes with a strip of Gaedere purple down one of the sleeves. He still hadn’t shaved and his natural scent of bonfire and cinnamon was filtering thickly through the air. Draco tried to subtly inhale a large lungful as he found the alpha’s smell calmed him, his worries falling away to background noise.
“N-Not Ron or Seamus…” Draco added, chewing on his lip.
“You sure?” Harry asked, giving Draco a careful look. “Luna told me just the other day that I can come off as kind of intimidating, I don’t…I don’t want you to feel that way okay?”
“If you’re trying to imply the baby’s not mine, you’re wrong,” Harry snapped irritably. “Circe, not you too Remus. Draco isn’t after money or my name, he isn’t trying to ‘lock down’ an alpha as Sirius so tactfully implied and he bloody well isn’t lying about the baby’s paternity. I was there when Madam Pomfrey cast the magical signature spell and there again when a St. Mungo’s healer did exactly the same thing.”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Hermione whispered, nudging Harry’s shoulder lightly.
“Did you get a look at the boy?” Muriel asked, “A
“And I’m Sirius Black,” Sirius announced, making Draco jump, he hadn’t realised the other man had returned. Sirius was smirking as he held out a photograph for Draco to take. “Your first cousin once removed.”
“What do you reckon?” Harry asked, leaning down to nudge his nose against Draco’s temple. Draco closed his eyes briefly as he savoured the touch.
“Did you
Harry blinked down at the shirt he had forgotten he was still holding.
Harry stared, open mouthed, as Draco appeared, his arm linked around a very haughty looking Snape. Draco was wearing the pale peach, silk dress from Olive’s along with the necklace that Harry had bought him for Christmas. The lustrous thin fabric clung elegantly to every dip and curve on Draco’s slender body, shimmering with his movements.
For some reason, Hermione’s words settled uncomfortably in Harry’s gut. His alpha really didn’t like the sound of Draco being far away from him. They hadn’t even sorted out
“Oh,” Draco breathed softly, “that’s perfect.”
Harry figured though it didn’t matter how beautiful Draco was, Dean was clearly set on earning brownie points with his girlfriend.
Draco’s scent turned slightly sweet, from crisp fresh fruit to apple pie, Harry realised it must be because the omega was happy. He felt a little saddened that he had never actually smelled that on Draco before.
“He’s going to curse us!” someone squealed before another voice yelled “Expelliarmus!”
“Bit harsh Hermione,” Harry sighed before reaching out to squeeze Draco’s shoulder. “She’s right though, you do need to eat something. I’m really fucking sorry about the soup, I didn’t realise I’d done that.”
“Oh,” Draco looked surprised, “I was trying to move the bed against the wall, it’s better for nesting that way.”
“Everything alright in there Mione?” Ron asked.
“Would you like a cuppa, Harry?” Olive called out as she walked towards the till.
“Potter won’t bond with you,” Smith stated, bringing up his index finger to stroke the bottom of Draco’s chin. “If he’d being going to, he would have done it when you first told him you were with child. You need to start thinking about your other options pretty omega, before it’s too late.”
“As I thought,” Bella clapped her hands together, “He was a total stranger when you tumbled into bed with him.”
After Harry had rearranged the furniture in the room to how Draco wanted it, the other boy’s scent had turned nervous again. Harry tried to figure out why, surely the omega knew that Harry was going to leave for his own dorm and wouldn’t try anything with him?
“Right you,” Harry snarled playfully, stalking forwards as Draco yelped and tried to run away. It was no good however, the alpha’s strong arms wrapped around the omega not a moment later and Draco found himself hoisted backwards so Harry’s front was pressed against his back. “Got you,” Harry growled, the low rumble of his chest vibrating against Draco and making him shiver.
“I-It’s quite tight with all the vehicles,” Draco stammered, “I don’t know if there would be enough room for –“
“Easy for you to say,” Ron grouched, “everybody wants a piece of Harry Potter.”
“So, what happens now?” Harry asked, shifting on his seat. Despite being twenty-one he still felt like he was a nervous eleven year old whenever he was in the headmistress’ office.
Draco peeked at his aunt from over the top of the café menu. They were in a small, relatively new establishment off a side street in Hogsmeade. Draco hadn’t actually told Harry that he would be meeting with Bellatrix that afternoon. The alpha would have undoubtedly insisted on coming too and Draco had thought it best to avoid his aunt and Harry interacting as much as possible. The last thing he wanted was for any wands to be drawn.
“Oh don’t start again,” the woman sneered. “You’re acting ridiculously.”
Draco looked dejected, “that I’m a g-gold digger who got pregnant on purpose.”
“I-Is it silly? Draco asked, looking down at himself critically. “Am I not old enough to wear something like this?”
“Katie is muggleborn,” Hermione announced, “as am I. I think perhaps our perception of omegas is a little different to how you may have been brought up Draco.”
Harry’s dreams that night were colourful and vivid. In them, he watched as Draco methodically pulled silk stockings on and off, scandalously revealing the lower part of his leg like some sort of saucy Victorian. Harry really hoped that no one he ever met would be a powerful enough legilimens to find out that once, at two am, Harry had found himself jerking off in bed to the thoughts of a slender, pale ankle.
“Okay,” Harry bit his own lip in amusement. “Well, I certainly haven’t found you to be either of those things yet. Even if you were, that’s okay, people can be stroppy sometimes. You should see Ron after the Canons lose a game.”
you want to do this?” Ron asked, nursing his pint.
“Thank you Harry,” Draco replied, his throat felt swollen. Tentatively, and ever so slowly, Draco raised his own hand, moving it towards Harry where his fingertips pressed up against the alpha’s muscled chest. Harry’s body always gave off such a comforting wave of warmth and his scent was soaking into the sheets that Draco was wrapped in.
He turned round to find Olive stood at the top of the stairs smiling knowingly at him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, affecting a solemn expression. “How about here?” he pressed another kiss to the side of the bump as Draco squirmed. “Here?” he leant round to peck the curve of Draco’s waist. “Maybe…” Harry breathed out slowly, letting go of Draco’s hips so the omega could move away if he wanted. Harry locked eyes with Draco whilst bowing his head even lower, to where the silky nightgown was bunched on his lap. “Here?” Harry asked.
“And that would be me,” Severus concluded, a small smile playing upon his lips. “I see.”
“You’re still not bitten then?” Smith distractedly licked his lips as his gaze fell on Draco’s neck. Draco knew the alpha was hazarding a guess, the knitted turtle neck Draco was wearing covered up his throat completely.
“I was talking to Professor Vector,” Draco replied.
Harry smiled as Draco let out a soft moan of relief as the alpha dug his fingers into the tensed up flesh. “Let me know if you want it at a different pressure,” Harry told him. As a much bigger alpha, Harry was a little concerned he might not know his own strength when it came to Draco’s delicate body.
“Alright then, I’d better be off, I promised my girlfriend I’d meet her for a late lunch at the Three Broomsticks,” Felicity told him, reaching out to ruffle Draco’s hair.
“Ron’s just grumpy that he’s started needing reading glasses,” Harry whispered loudly, winking at Draco.
Draco waited patiently, glancing with interest at the various parchments and tomes that were spread across the desk. Finally, Severus looked up, a thin, black eyebrow arched.
need to eat properly. We’ll call up Mipsy and ask for something gentle on your tummy.”
“Well at least that’s one of the things I’ve heard people say about me over the years,” Harry shrugged, forcing a cheerful smile. “When I was sixteen a whole article was run in the Prophet about how my parents killed Voldemort but at the last moment he managed to stash his soul away in me so he couldn’t die.”
“How I wanted to get my cock inside you whilst I fondle your swollen tits, make that little omega prick of yours bounce as I fuck you hard.”
Harry glanced to observe the younger boy on the bed beside him. Draco had evidently fallen back asleep, his face half smushed into the pillow and his other cheek bearing crease marks, red against his milky skin. The omega’s hair had been growing quite quickly since he became pregnant and it was spread out around him like a silver halo. In truth, he did look like an angel, albeit with a small patch of drool on his chin.
Draco sniffed and nodded, tipping himself forwards as much as he could into Katie’s warm hug. There was a knock on the door a moment later before Hermione poked her head round.
“I think I do,” the golden haired woman nodded, going over to her trunk and popping the lid.
“H-Harry,” Draco whispered, his eyes shooting open in horror as he felt his underwear flood with a sudden rush of slick. Draco was frozen in mortification as the sticky substance dripped down the back of his thighs, soaking into the material of the dark maternity jeans he had bought from Olive’s.
The other boy was wearing a floor length, pale peach evening gown. The fabric was silky and rippled down his slender body until it got to his stomach where it tightly hugged a small but noticeable bump. The dress had thin straps and a scooped neckline and Draco had managed to pin the longer sections of his hair up so that all of his creamy white throat, décolletage and arms were on display.
“Right, this is a women’s dorm for Eleventh Years,” Hermione explained as they stepped through a set of velvet amethyst curtains and into an area that wasn’t too different from Draco’s Slytherin dorm, albeit the beds looked a little larger and more spaced apart.
“Just like your father,” Snape stated venomously.
go near him again I will crucio your fucking brains out, Merlin help me.”
In the end, both alphas had been allowed to compete. Right before the final trial however, an auror enquiry had revealed a nefarious plot by a former Death Eater that was quickly dismantled. Despite having been two points in the lead, Harry had graciously volunteered to step down from the competition after the tampering was brought to light. This had allowed Cedric Diggory to go on and win the tournament.
I used she/her pronouns for Lyra because that’s what Harry and Draco decided to use until Lyra is old enough to let them know which ones are preferred. ‘Lyra’ is a constellation name and also the letters come from a mix of Lily and Narcissa.
“We’d really be bonded?” Draco asked, frowning as he stared at Harry, their noses almost touching.
“Professor Turpentine promised we’d get to do more practical come the summer,” Harry murmured absently, using his middle finger to slide his glasses back up his nose before he sighed and gave up on his own reading material.
Draco shook his head, his nose brushing against Harry’s chest. Harry gently stroked the younger boy’s hair, marvelling at how it still felt like silk whilst Harry’s was coarse and rough.
“We’ll do that,” Harry nodded enthusiastically, “It’s Draco’s money and should be under his control.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione gave him a sympathetic look. “You’re being unfair to yourself. You know this situation is completely different to Molly’s. She and Arthur had been together for years and they were married. You didn’t even know Draco before he got pregnant.”
“Look Draco, I know you don’t like to ask me for things. I know this pregnancy is…
“I’ve ruined your makeup,” Harry frowned, knowing that was probably the least of his worries right now, “Wait….you love it?”
“Oh wait!” Harry snapped his fingers, “I’ve got it – Sirius’ garage! I mean he won’t let us move the motorbikes but I’m sure we could charm them into pretty colours for the day? Plus we could put flower arrangements in all the spare helmets.”
Draco relaxed as he heard shuffling footsteps moving away from the door.
“Probably worried Harry’s eyes might wander,” the second woman laughed, dunking a chocolate hobnob into her cup.
Draco shot the alpha a small smile and shook his head, “It’s fine, your friends were really n-nice and helped me with it.”
“Draco?” Harry prompted.
He looked down to his arms when his daughter let out a spit bubbled gurgle. A small hand reached from beneath the swaddling cloth and closed around Harry’s index finger.
Draco had a horrible vision of Harry Potter and Venetia curled up together somewhere in the Alps with mugs of hot cocoa and a fuzzy blanket over the two of them. He sighed despondently, giving his peas a final push for good measure before vanishing his plate and leaving the Great Hall.
“What else would you expect from the offspring of Death Eaters?” Iona declared. “You know as soon as that thing’s born Harry will get shot of them both.”
“Oh don’t be so hard on him,” Hermione tutted, “he’s still scared of you. Remember, you’re a strange alpha and his emotions must be all up in the air right now.”
“I’ve tried those as well,” Damien sighed. Harry noticed that the boy had released quite a lot of his scent, probably inadvertently. It was a mixture of hyacinth and wood shavings, very pretty and delicate. Harry thought of Draco’s scent of apples and frost and how he could never seem to conceal his emotions with it.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “You developed something called Frettlering Fever, don’t worry everything with the baby is okay,” he added quickly as Draco made a distressed noise. “Apparently it’s something that can hit pregnant omegas when they would otherwise have been having a heat.”
Draco shuddered, imagining Bella attempting to cuddle with him. Thank Merlin his aunt had such an aversion to touch, Draco didn’t think he had even seen her scent Rodolphus over the years. As for Severus, they just didn’t have that kind of physically close relationship and Draco knew he would probably perish from embarrassment if his godfather ever tried to change that.
signature?” Harry frowned, for some reason he just really didn’t want to pick up that quill and put his name to this whole affair. “Call up his guardian and get them to do it.”
“I notice you haven’t made a nest yet?” Harry asked, moving over to look at the still very normal looking bed.
Harry shuffled across to inspect the mobile as Draco held it up with a wide smile. It was a beautiful piece of art, each of the animals was made out of a frosted bluish glass but Draco could sense unbreakable charms. As he lifted it higher, so each string was able to hang to its full length unobstructed, the animals began to glow and spin in a circle.
“I can’t believe I don’t even know what your omega looks like,” Ron snorted in disbelief.
Harry chuckled as he quickly cast a shield around the struggling but determined creature, allowing it to reach the roof with its prize.
“Draco,” Severus’ lips finally twitched into a smile as he caught sight of his godson, his face however turned to one of disgust as he regarded the large knitted jumpers that all the men were wearing. “I see pregnancy has driven you to join a cult.”
Draco remembered the Triwizard Tournament. He had been a Third Year at the time and there had been a bit of a kafuffle when the cup had selected
Gingerly, Draco turned round and looked up. Harry had clearly washed and changed from his quidditch practice, now wearing heavy black robes, his hair shiny and tousled off his face. He looked huge compared to Bellatrix and he towered domineeringly over the table before laying a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’m g-going now,” Draco snapped, turning to walk back in the direction he had come from and praying the trees hadn’t closed up already.
Draco screamed, the sound trailing off into a wrecked sob as Harry drew back to watch spurts of white come fly from his omega’s cock, splattering across Draco and Harry’s fronts in ropes of little glistening pearls. Harry snarled ferociously, driving himself up into Draco’s hole for a final set of pulsing thrusts before his knot inflated, so rapidly as to almost be painful as they were tied together.
“Is he pretty?” Ron asked, earning him another daggered glare from Hermione. Sometimes Harry couldn’t help but think that Ron really did make things more difficult for himself on purpose.
Draco eyes were wide and amazed as Seamus levitated the amorphous blob over the table where it went shiny and taut, stretching into the recognizable form of a sausage dog.
“Bloody hell, alright,” Ron retorted, “I was only checking ‘cause Harry’s been roped into helping Professor Sprout carry some compost sacks over to the greenhouses and I promised we’d meet him in the hall for breakfast. Plus me and Michael are scheduled to assist Flitwick with his ten o’ clock class.”
Draco glanced to Harry, he wasn’t sure how the alpha would feel about it considering Lucius Malfoy had been in the picture. Harry, however, was nodding enthusiastically. “You’re right Katie – I reckon this is the same spot, I wish I could claim to have planned it that way.”
“I mean,” Harry huffed, “it’s not meant to be like this is it? By the time an omega becomes pregnant you’re normally meant to already be close with them so stuff like this would come naturally. I feel like I’m cocking this up royally. When I tell Draco to eat more, he gets nauseous, when I don’t nag him, he loses too much weight. If I try to chaperone him everywhere I feel as if I’m acting like some sort of dominating alpha and scaring him, but when I let him go by himself…” Harry trailed off and looked miserably down at the sleeping boy. Draco’s fan of blond eyelashes were twitching as if he was dreaming about something. Harry could only hope it wasn’t a nightmare on top of everything else.
“Yes,” Draco told her proudly. Only students with the highest grades were expected to take advanced Rune Studies. “Professor Babbling let me see her private collection of Ottoman runic texts,” Draco announced, pleased that whenever he got excited about a subject and was feeling calm enough, his stutter would leave him alone for a while.
Harry frowned, wondering if he could excuse himself yet and go see if Draco had made himself sick on pickled ginger.
“No, it looks great,” Harry said hurriedly. “Very sophisticated.”
“I need the loo,” Draco said quickly, putting down the mobile with a faint jingle of glass and lifting himself up. He felt Remus quickly come to his aid as the beta helped Draco get to his feet. Draco nodded at him in thanks before hurrying over to the nearest bathroom and locking the door.
Draco nodded, chewing his lip for a moment, “I would like a wedding ceremony Harry.”
“Well, Draco’s different,” Harry snapped. “He’s quite…”
Harry moved back slightly so as to get a better view. Draco was kneeling, his head turned to one side submissively as he held his nightdress bunched up for Harry’s viewing pleasure. Below his swollen belly, Draco’s omega cock was stirring slightly from a nest of light blond curls. Little pink balls hung behind, the skin taut and shiny, pushed forwards by the meat of Draco’s thighs and the manner in which he was sitting.
The next morning Harry had promised he would teach Draco how to bake brownies. As usual he had awoken with a sleepy, snuffly omega curled up in bed next to him.
“Well, that Potter boy’s got prospects hasn’t he?” one of the women replied, sipping noisily on her tea. “He’s going places, wouldn’t want to be tied down too young.”
“Oh,” Draco blushed, Harry said it so matter of factly, like it wasn’t something that should be concealed from polite society. Bellatrix had even refused to use the word ‘heats’, instead referring to them as ‘tri-monthly flushes’. Draco’s eyes suddenly widened as he looked back at Harry, “I d-didn’t do or say anything did I? It wasn’t like a real heat?”
Draco looked surprised but allowed Harry to lead him up the stairs and around the rest of the house. They ended up in what was presumably the master bedroom with a stone balcony looking out onto the gardens and mingling guests below. Harry could hear the low trills of music and the clinking of champagne glasses. He snorted as he caught sight of Ginny Weasley tugging her girlfriend Angharad behind a particularly dense bush.
The Burrow was a very topsy turvy looking house, with one of the sloping gable ends clearly only staying up by magical scaffolding. Draco felt himself shrink behind Harry as they walked through the huge amount of guests squeezed into not the biggest space. Molly Weasley had introduced herself immediately, sweeping down on Harry and cooing over Draco’s bump. Draco thanked her graciously for his jumper before Molly began regaling them with quite frankly terrifying stories of her own children’s births.
“No,” Harry growled darkly in response. Suddenly, the mood in the room changed as Sirius’ face lit up and he shrugged off his jacket, jumping up from the chair.
“Oh,” Harry said, “that’s unusual isn’t it? I mean, shit, sorry if I’m being insensitive. I’m finding out every day that apparently I know next to nothing about omegas.”
Draco had yelped as he had stumbled into the cold stone wall, his books scattering across the corridor. With a resigned sigh he had crouched down to gather them all back up, hoping the ones he had borrowed from the library weren’t damaged enough to warrant a reprimand from Madam Pince.
“Of course not,” Harry stated, shaking his head, “so please don’t let this affect your day okay? We’re meant to be celebrating how ridiculously smart you are.”
Unfortunately, as Harry quietly cracked open the door, his nose was assaulted by rust and acid. The rest of the beds seemed empty, Harry supposed the first year must have already lost her transfigured trunk. The curtains around Draco’s bed were firmly closed but Harry could hear raised, angry voices.
“You okay Harry?” Neville asked, peering across the semi circle of leather couches.
^*^*^*^*^
“Swear on Merlin’s beard,” Harry said. “Remus reckons it was all good practice though for dealing with me and Sirius after I presented.”
Draco squinted to see that the tall alpha was sticking his head in between the pine filled branches.
“Oh bugger, yeah,” Harry laughed, “well at least it’s only the day after yours – still easy to remember.”
“Yes,” Draco keened, opening his mouth as Harry brought a hand forwards, allowing Draco to bite and suck on his fingers. “Yours alpha, I’m always yours.”
Draco whined pitifully as Harry plunged in and out of his hole, gaping now and dripping with slick. Omega instinct had kicked in and Draco could feel his body trying to cling to Harry’s shaft, suck it up deeper still. Draco bit his lip hard enough to taste rust, but he couldn’t stave off his own orgasm any further, crying out loudly, wailing as he felt himself come, his cock shooting across the bed and his balls tightening against his perineum.
!” Harry shouted again and there was another whip like crackle of a hex being cast.
The loud clang of the doorbell caused all four men to pause and look round.
Draco nodded forlornly and went to follow Harry out of the globe. He jealously wondered how Harry knew so much about omega slick as the two of them collected their miniature sized version from the vendor, stashed safely in an unbreakable charmed paper bag. Draco winced and tried to look as invisible as possible as Harry asked if she knew anywhere in the festival to pick up some clothes.
On Christmas Day, Draco had found himself rather overwhelmed with presents. There was a huge knitted jumper from Molly Weasley, who he hadn’t even met yet. It was a rich holly green with a purple ‘D’ in the middle in purl stitch. The older omega had even included a handwritten note explaining that the wool was threaded with accommodating charms, meaning that it would grow and shrink depending on the size of his baby bump.
There were about fifteen guests, including Luna, Neville, Padma, Felicity, Ron, Hermione, Katie, Seamus and more. Draco realised he had stopped moving to gape in shock as Harry hurried towards him, cradling Draco’s face in his large hands.
“No worries,” Harry shook his head, “are you alright?”
Draco chewed the inside of his cheek, fidgeting with his hands before Harry laid his larger one over them, stilling his fingers. “It,” Draco sighed, “it doesn’t look like the other omegas’ ones, in Slytherin.”
Harry thought that was understandable, especially as Molly had already put her foot in it slightly by talking about how she had already been thinking about decorating the garden for Harry’s eventual coupling over a year ago. This, having been before Draco was even in the picture, had led to the omega unhappily assuming it to mean that Molly had originally had a different bride in mind.
“Deal,” Draco nodded, still smiling widely, his ivory cheeks flushed.
Draco’s eyes widened as Katie smiled smugly at him.
“What if I don’t want to hear the answer?” Ron frowned. “What if she’s grown out of me and wants to go find some ‘all American’ alpha?”
“Second question, did Professor Vector tell you that in fact it was perfectly fine to use the Porrage-Colson formula and you should stop worrying about it?”
Draco smiled and rubbed his belly with his free hand, he didn’t mind how big his stomach had grown. In fact he was pretty sure he was going to miss his bump when it was gone. However, he was rather desperate to meet his baby and be able to see his feet again. It had got to the rather embarrassing point of having to ask Harry to help Draco put underwear on. Then again, the alpha certainly hadn’t seemed to mind, although often the underwear came straight off again as soon as it had gone on.
“They own Primeltränke, you know the European chain of apothecaries?” Damien continued. “Noah Bachmann is the deputy finance minister for the Swiss Wizarding Commerce Chamber.”
Draco knew the older beta was probably referring to Draco’s stutter and lisp which were slightly more pronounced today than they usually were around his friends. “I’m okay,” Draco replied truthfully, “I think it’s left over stress from exams, I really wanted to do well.”
“Okay,” Remus nodded. “And Draco?”
“On your knees,” Harry explained, helping Draco to move about, “I’ll support your weight but it will be best this way for your first time.”
“It was bloody annoying during exam season,” Sirius huffed, walking over to them and depositing a load of levitating mugs on the table. “They’d make us sit in alphabetical order so I was always next to Cissy and by the second hour I’d be starving and there was your mother smelling like sodding apple pie.”
Harry was torn from the mental image of a paper, pole dancing praying mantis by a tight squeeze on his arm. He blinked down in surprise to see that Damien was holding on to him.
Harry grinned as the baby kicked again and Draco let out an ‘Oof!’
Of course, it was irresponsible to try out a new spell on himself, but Draco had had enough. After years of being touch starved and excluded, Draco couldn’t bear it anymore. If a spell was what it took to suddenly bring him friends, then so be it.
“Are you angry I met with her?” Draco asked hurriedly.
“Thank you,” Draco nodded. He grabbed his nightgown out of the drawer before hurrying over to the ensuite bathroom. “I’m j-just going to change, don’t leave yet.”
From that description, Harry didn’t really think Sirius had changed much at all.
“How are you so quick?!” Harry exclaimed as he dodged another icy projectile. “I swear someone with a belly that big shouldn’t be able to move like this!”
“N-No,” Draco shook his head firmly, wrapping him arms protectively around his stomach. “I haven’t seen my aunt in months.”
Harry groaned at the mouth-watering sight before him, reaching down to squeeze the base of his own throbbing prick. Waves of slick were spreading down the backs of Draco’s pale thighs and his buttocks jiggled slightly as Harry moved on the bed, making the mattress dip and bounce.
“Well,” Harry grinned, “they’re sleeping in their coop right now at the bottom of the garden but tomorrow I can introduce you to our peacocks.”
Harry narrowed his eyes as Snape took a step forwards, reaching out to place his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“May I come in?” Harry asked, his voice already a low growl as he clearly forced himself to wait by the side of the bed. His entire body seemed to be vibrating.
“It’s nice,” Draco said, as looked around. The study was a pleasant, comfy area with a sofa and a deep armchair along with an antique rocking chair upholstered in a dark blue. There were several tapestries and paintings on the walls and a fireplace with a wrought iron grate. Draco peered around the corner to see that there was also an area with a large four poster bed.
“And sometimes I can’t believe I was actually brave enough to get on the back of that scoundrel’s motorbike. You should have seen him back then, all leather and cocksure grins. Thought he was invincible.”
“You reckon?” Harry asked, stroking his thumb against Draco’s cheek. “I think if they’re already throwing a strop they might be more like their papa.”
Harry shook his head, he had only just learned the omega’s name let alone considering mating him. Bond bites were given during mating from the alpha to the omega, marking them as taken. Whilst bonds could be dissolved, it was a painful process and not something to undertake lightly. Of course, alphas could bite multiple omegas if they so chose, although this was rather frowned upon in polite society.
Draco keened as Harry let out a laugh, the alpha’s hand snaking down, bypassing Draco’s hardened prick and instead caressing his balls. “You want my fingers?”
this.”
Draco laughed delightedly as the song died down and Hermione flapped open one of the boat’s sails to reveal a rudimentary map. “A clue!” she announced, beaming round at them. “We need to head this way,” she gestured to a gap in the trees, hurrying through it before letting out a small yelp as her sleeve got caught on a branch.
“Well,
Harry hadn’t even considered this, it hadn’t even crossed his mind as he had put the quill to paper. Whilst another omega might have used the pregnancy to get something out of Harry, it had become quickly evident that that was not Draco’s intent. So Harry hadn’t for one moment contemplated that Draco might actually
is my point,” Olive sighed, looking at Draco and rolling her eyes conspiratorially. Draco felt himself grin back, he much preferred the atmosphere of this nice shop compared to the intimidating busyness of Diagon Alley.
“Morning,” Draco mumbled, partially sitting up and rubbing sleepily at his puffy face.
“I’m s-sorry,” Draco whispered miserably.
“Oh I gave up on that long ago,” Remus replied breezily, “But Sirius has a nice bottom so I decided to put up with it.”
“Oh,” Draco murmured, looking down, “I think I can move now.”
“What?” Draco squeaked.
There was a moment of silence before Harry chuckled wryly and shook his head. “Making a right pig’s ear of this aren’t I?”
Draco’s mouth fell open as Harry made a noise of surprise beside him. Draco looked down at the photograph that Sirius had handed him. It was of three teenagers, a little younger than Draco. One boy and two girls, the boy was devastatingly good looking with long dark hair and Draco immediately clocked him as a young Sirius.
“I know it well,” Severus nodded slowly, “and you…wish to work there?”
“Yeah – environmentally friendly! After the reception everyone can just dump their leftovers on the pile,” Harry nodded enthusiastically. Draco was looking a little pale as he shrugged.
Draco closed his eyes and wished for the health and happiness of his baby, before he shuffled closer and blew as hard as he could. There was a jubilant cheer as Draco blinked to see he had managed to extinguish all of the candles at once. The dragons were now settling down onto the icing and retiring their charm.
“I guess, yes,” Draco looked back up at the bed. “I just…it’s not pretty like theirs were.” Draco blushed when he realised that it was embarrassment he was feeling. He just knew if he had attempted to build something like this in the Slytherin dorm he would have been laughed at. Everyone had thought him so uppity they would have probably found his attempt with the columns pretentious, and the fact he couldn’t even get it to work anyway just undermined the whole endeavour.
The shop had pale wooden floorboards and painted yellow walls. There were racks and rails of clothes, including an entire display section for shoes. Draco struggled to take it all in before realizing there was even a staircase leading to a second floor.
Draco hadn’t trusted himself to speak again, simply nodding and staring down at the reassembled pile of books in his arms as he clambered back up to his feet.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered miserably, staring down at the book on object curse removal that was sat open in his lap. He must have read the same page on curse dipped ink used in manuscript illumination about ten times by now.
^*^*^*^*^
Draco smiled to himself as he crawled into the nest, it felt divine. Harry had even cast some softening charms on the fabrics and everything was pillowy and warm. Draco wriggled round so he was lying down facing the alpha, one of Harry’s shirts wrapped around his bump.
were Draco’s guardians?
if Harry didn’t just want to wreck him completely.
Draco huffed as he tried to button up his school robes over his ever expanding stomach. There was a frost on the grass outside, like a layer of crystallized sugar icing. It was early December and already a festive, red breasted robin had taken up residence on Draco’s window box.
Eventually, Draco settled on a mix of small slices from each layer.
Draco was lovely, Harry concluded. He was sweet and clever, albeit painfully shy and at times amusingly innocent and proper. He was earnest in his feelings and didn’t ever use his omega status to try and manipulate those around him. Despite having been raised by the Lestranges, he was nothing like the calculated harshness of his aunt or the blustering pretensions of his uncle.
“Don’t stress over it,” Hermione told him, as if reading Harry’s mind. “Just hold him close and he’ll be alright. Everyone knows you run like a furnace.”
“Draco’s scent turns to apple pie when he’s happy,” Harry told them. Draco blinked in surprise, he hadn’t realised that Harry had become so in tune with his emotional scents.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, “you’d be my omega and I’d be your alpha.”
“Thank you,” Draco smiled with a rose coloured blush. “You look very handsome Harry.”
“Yeah,” Harry huffed, “I know, that’s why I was trying to find him. He just ran off and I was worried.”
Suddenly, a warm hand spread across the back of Draco’s neck, causing the omega to let out an inadvertent whimper.
“Ye of little faith,” Seamus snorted, “I’ve been practising this all week.”
“Good,” Harry nodded, “I’m glad you’re eating better this week. Proud of you for trying.”
“That’s it baby boy,” Harry groaned, clasping Draco tighter to him and licking a stripe up his flushed cheek, he could taste the faint salt of tears. “You can scream for me if you want.”
“Are you going to suck me angel?” Harry asked, squeezing the omega’s hips and blowing onto Draco’s hole, causing it to twitch and the younger man to shudder.
“Someone who clearly wanted their wedding day ruined,” Harry muttered, shifting anxiously in his new dress shoes which felt altogether too tight. In fact, his entire suit felt too tight and he pulled the shirt collar away from his throat.
“Ah,” Harry tutted, shaking his head, “don’t be shy. If you want it, you can ask for it. You know I’ll give you anything you ask for.”
“Oh,” Draco murmured quietly, his eyes prickling with tears. His baby was always going to be safe, always going to be loved. Draco had been worrying so much for the last three months that his child would grow up like he had, without support. Apart from, of course, what Draco could give them and what Harry would kindly offer. Yet here were about twenty different people vowing to protect and care for his child.
Draco huddled into his blanket, looking out through the wrought iron fenestration. It was too dark to see anything, but when the lightning flashed it illuminated recognizable shapes such as the Great Lake or the tops of the quidditch pitch goals.
“Relax,” Ginny said, her face turning serious. “No one else knows and I only got it out of Ron because I think he was feeling a bit sorry for me. I’m not going to tell anyone Harry. I know that might lead to an army of magically impregnated omegas and Draco would get a criminal record.”
Draco stared wide eyed at Harry for a moment before bursting into giggles.
“A mother’s love,” Snape spoke woodenly, “they say a mother’s love saved him, but would that not be an insult to every other mother who has lost their child – that
“I see,” Snape smiled, the corners of his thin pale lips curving upwards. “Well then, I’m sure you can get your future Potions Master to explain to you why any First Year with half a brain would be able to recognize the difference between a feverfew draught and a gurdyroot suspension.”
“Yes,” Snape sighed without inflection as he gazed up at Harry with beady, almost black eyes. “And I am glad for it. Draco inherited none of his father’s pompous manipulation and deserves to be cared for in the way he so craves. I trust you will take good care of him.”
“I don’t claim to understand what happened sixteen years ago,” Harry said carefully. “All I know is that my parents loved me and they died to protect me, and everybody else, from a genocidal maniac and they were successful in that endeavour. My godfathers adopted me and gave me the best childhood I could have hoped for and now I have a mate who couldn’t be more perfect if he tried and soon I’ll be a dad myself.” Harry paused for breath, “All I’ve learned today is that you were in love with my mother. Well, from what Sirius has told me, so was half of Hogwarts.”
“Ah,” Harry grinned, “so
Draco realised he was going to have to swallow before he accidentally drooled all over Harry Potter. He quickly ducked his head to do so, causing himself to splutter a bit.
“Is it true?”
Thank you for reading and being kind. I wrote this as I have been feeling terribly down and I appreciated your kindness and support immensely. I hope you enjoyed it and are well.
“She’s stunning Draco,” Harry said truthfully, looking up to see that Draco’s grey eyes appeared slightly watery. “You look just like her.”
“No,” Draco replied firmly, standing his ground.
“MOONY YOU UTTER BASTARD WHY THE
“A lot of the more traditional alphas don’t approve of their omegas seeking employment,” Severus hummed thoughtfully, “believing it to reflect badly on their ability to support and provide for the household themselves.”
Draco swallowed thickly, averting his eyes from Harry’s and instead staring at the wiry chest hair that was poking out from the top of the older man’s pyjama shirt.
“Sirius!” Harry shouted angrily.
“He didn’t ‘run off’,” Hermione snapped, “I took him away because the poor thing looked like he was going to burst into tears.”
Harry paused and raised his eyebrows, “Funny, I thought that would be my line.”
“Yes,” Snape replied, reaching into his robes and bringing out two small vials of colourless liquid. “One is a stabilisation elixir for omegas about to give birth, I found the recipe in an old manuscript but it’s been tried and tested many times.”
Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck, swiping his tongue delicately over Draco’s scent gland before groaning. A thick honeyed apple was released into the air but the element of frost was there too, sharpening the tang and making Harry burn with want. He lathed up Draco’s throat in kitten licks, making sure to imprint his own scent in every dip and groove of the omega’s body.
Harry shifted and sure enough, his knot had finally gone down. Very carefully he rolled them back over so he could slip out of Draco’s very reddened and puffy hole. Harry stared in amazement as Draco took a sharp intake of breath, Harry’s own come gushed from Draco’s entrance, spreading across the bed.
“Draco?” Harry said, running his fingers through the omega’s damp hair. “Draco I’m going to get in with you okay? Please don’t be scared, I just want to wash this off whilst holding you up.”
is where you’ve been storing all your body heat.” He laughed as Draco glared up at him. The younger boy’s petulance quickly dissolved, however, as Harry began to thrust his finger in and out of the omega’s writhing body. As Draco lurched forwards, more of Harry’s cock was forced into his mouth but as he jerked back, Harry’s finger slipped deeper into his body.
“Um, the name sounds familiar,” Harry answered, wracking his brains.
“Well you needn’t concern yourself with it Lupin,” Snape snapped. “The fact that Draco conceived via a spell will have no influence at all on the infant, or anything else for that matter. The spell performed its purpose and now it is over.”
“A little,” Harry admitted with a laugh, “but it’s the best feeling in the world.”
“Well,” Ron shrugged, “I don’t reckon people will care too much if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“We had the Sourbolls over for tea last week,” Bellatrix continued as Draco tensed. “Enjoyed a lengthy discussion with young Atherol.”
Draco felt himself flush with pleasure, both at his alpha acting proud of Draco and at the festival suggestion. Draco had really wanted to go to the one in Hogsmeade, never having had anyone to go with before. When he had heard his accident meant he would miss it, Draco had felt rather disappointed.
Draco beamed at him, taking the plate as their fingers brushed. Harry wasn’t sure if the scent of caramelised apples was coming from the dessert or the omega but he liked to think it was the latter.
“Not because it’s bad!” Harry rushed to say, having noticed Draco’s shifting scent. “Quite um, maybe too much the opposite?”
“We took a bit longer,” she explained, looking at the others accusingly, “I think Philip’s sprained his ankle.”
“He’s not mine,” Harry admitted.
“I- I’m sorry,” Draco stammered, hugging his arms tightly around his upper body which was still violently shaking. “I’m so sorry, I d-didn’t mean to. I made a mistake.”
“How much calming draught has he had?” Harry whispered to Remus, unsubtly gesturing to Sirius.
“I’m serious,” Harry grinned. “When our kid starts wanting galleons for the latest broomstick I’m going to be sending them your way, deal?”
“Knew it, you haven’t slept with him yet,” he announced cheerfully. “Seamus owes me a pint.”
Snape eyed Remus for a moment before inhaling slowly and nodding, “that will not be necessary, I’d hate to think what such a spell could do to your mutated werewolf genes. I wouldn’t want to be responsible for the next Fenrir Greyback.”
Draco clutched at his belly, realising that his stomach cramps might not be from overindulging on cake after all.
“Oh you’ve changed your tune then – what happened to ‘
“I’m so excited for Christmas,” Damien told Harry excitedly, “our family friends the Bachmanns are coming to stay. Do you know the Bachmann family?” Damien asked, looking a little hopeful.
“Calm down, he’s already mated to you,” Sirius scoffed. “Then again, apparently old Snivellus has a potion –“
“I’m just asking! Although I guess as an alpha you can always change your mind, Draco’s the one getting bitten.”
“I’ll have to l-learn your weaknesses first,” Draco beamed, walking past Harry and into the bathroom, where Harry could hear the omega start to brush his teeth.
Draco was beautiful, delicately swollen with child, his paper white skin stretched thin over aristocratic angles. His sharp nose complimented his petite face and his ash grey eyes, although closer together and less doll like than most omegas, were intelligent and at times, even fierce. Harry thought of the graceful curve of Draco’s neck, the three freckles under his ear and how his hummingbird heart would beat a tattoo as the vein in his throat pulsed whenever Harry touched him. The way Draco’s blush would blossom like spring sakura, darkening to candied cherries as it spread across his chest, now puffy with the beginning of small breasts.
“Okay,” Harry sighed, figuring out how to proceed. A moment later, however, Draco reached across to the folds of his dress, pulling out his hawthorn wand.
Did you think this fic was going to be vanilla? No, 'tis breast milk flavoured. Bon appétitty.
“It’s fine,” Draco shrugged, trying not think of how his heat suppressants had left him shivering and cold in his dorm bed whilst the other omegas played exploding snap and swapped stories of courting alphas.
“N-Nothing,” Draco stated quickly before Harry could even defend himself. “Please Sev, d-don’t tell him.”
“Oh,” Draco breathed out softly, “it’s snowing!”
“I suppose the others must have been firing blanks or something,” Damien sighed, casually inspecting his nails, “can’t blame a boy for wanting a leg up in the world I guess, even if it means letting everyone else get a leg over.”
“Are my godfathers okay?” Harry frowned worriedly, rushing back over to his bed and quickly changing into jeans and a pullover, not giving a damn if he inadvertently flashed the headmistress. Sirius and Remus were still touring the world as they had been doing for the past five years but they were the only family Harry had left.
Harry bit back a grin as he felt Sirius stiffen next to him. The other alpha was still intently staring at his book and ignoring everyone, but Harry could see his knuckles had gone white from tension.
“You may,” Harry laughed fondly, “but I don’t think I’m done with you quite yet.” Harry made sure Draco was watching him as he brought up the hand still covered by the omega’s release and diligently began to clean it with his tongue.
The original date of the wedding, the fifth of June, had actually proved a little too soon for all that Harry had wanted to set up. Instead, it had been moved to the fifth of August, meaning that Draco would have already given birth and had some time to recover. Harry couldn’t quite believe that in only a couple of months he would have both a child and a husband.
“Seamus already nicked it,” Ron announced. Harry peered across to where his friend was sat up in his own bed looking like Harry felt. Ron’s skin had turned a queasy shade of green and his eyes appeared to be having trouble focussing.
“When Molly wrote to me about her pregnancies it was all these sweet memories of Arthur cuddling her on the lawn, rubbing her feet when they got swollen. Sending him out for pickled onions at four in the morning,” Harry continued.
“Get some sleep Draco, okay?” Harry said, opening it up and throwing the omega a cheerful wave.
“I know,” Remus replied simply, “I wasn’t implying as much, rather that standing beside him as a traitor must have been even harder.”
“Yes, well, no one’s ever accused you of being a blushing wallflower Harry,” Remus replied looking amused. “Draco on the other hand…”
“Not to mention that that sort of ridiculous display is only going to cause stress for Draco and the baby,” Hermione finished.
“Oh dear,” Hermione sighed, “was he that angry?”
“You can come in,” Draco said, so quietly that Harry nearly didn’t hear him.
“That’s right,” Harry nodded, “we’re here for a scan.”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, walking over to the omega and frowning at a reddened, sore looking section of Draco’s lower lip. The boy had evidently been chewing on it as he tended to do when he felt anxious.
After Draco had admitted what he had done, desperately telling them that he hadn’t meant for this to happen, the omega had simply become too distressed for any sensible conversation. Harry had been quickly ushered away by Professor McGonagall whilst Madam Pomfrey had forced a calming draught down the hysterical boy’s throat. The smell of acidic rust had become so strong that Harry thought he might be sick.
The furniture was dark wood and quite a few pieces were South Asian in style with intricate lattice work. Above them, hung industrial light bulbs framed in strange angular wire shades that doubled as contemporary art.
“Which flavour do you want?” Harry asked, picking up a large knife and a paper plate. “There’s apple, ginger, chocolate, honey, vanilla and rhubarb, which I know sounds a bit like a weird mix,” Harry spoke a little louder and pointedly as Ron snorted and hid behind his hand, evidently having already commented on the flavour choices.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione smiled fondly, “you’ve been the person you needed to be. So many people have ulterior motives, we’ve found that out the hard way. I don’t think you’re an arsehole no, in fact I think you’re perfectly lovely.”
^*^*^*^*^
“Never,” Harry snapped, “considering being a father is sort of a permanent deal.”
,” Sirius shook his head at Harry with a look of a disappointment, “
“Does he now?” Severus enquired, looking amused again. “Are we to see a complete reversal of societal norms then? Is Potter going to be staying at home eating grapes whilst packing you off to the workhouse?”
“P-Perhaps, if that’s what you want?” Draco replied. Harry knew he was going to have to push a little harder.

“You won’t feel trapped?” Harry asked as Draco clambered into the bed and shuffled over towards the wall. His sheets were white and soft, specially designed to be scentless for nesting use.
“Yeah I know,” Harry smiled, “It’s just I’d like to find something nice to wear for the Weasley’s Boxing Day party, so I need to go out anyway.
