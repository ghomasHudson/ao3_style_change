“Ok, thanks,” Draco agreed and moved back to his spot to sit down and have a snack. He chatted to Hermione about how her studying was going and was happy to hear about a current project she was working on. They also chatted about one of the essays he was creating an outline for until her alarm went off and the room succumbed to a quiet working environment.
We hope that the time you have taken from your education has been fulfilling and gave you the space you required to return to your studies. After this coming semester, your ability to maintain a place at this school without taking classes will have run out and your spot will be given away to a transfer student on our waiting list.
Harry grabbed one of his sandwich halves and said, “It feels like years, but it’s only been one. Mom told me he’s getting in in about a week, and he misses using the car, so he promised her he’d come get me,” before taking an enormous bite out of it.
Food shopping with Ron and his new roommate Draco was an adventure. Hermione had opted out seeing as her refrigerator was still out of commision so it was just the three of them. They had managed to put it off until the day before classes started, relying on the food they brought from home and the occasional meal at the dining hall or coffee shop - or at least, that’s what Harry was assuming. He hadn’t seen his friends much after their movie marathon. He constantly had to be around when the kids on his floor were moving in to help answer questions, direct them to the right places, and encourage them to actually participate in the Orientation activities. He wasn’t all that successful in that regard, most of them elected to stay in their rooms or hang out with their new friends rather than follow him to the admittedly awkward events the school’s Student Government Association whipped up, hoping to excite and welcome their new students.
Draco who turned back to his suitcases said, “Cool.” Ron texted his friends back, putting the ringer on silent so he didn’t annoy his new acquaintance as he typed.
“Well you seem to have thought through a lot of your feelings.” She bumped her shoulders with him again, “I mean yeah, you’ve only known him for a little bit of time, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get to know each other through a relationship that’s maybe a little less platonic. Don’t sell yourself short.”
Harry and Ron had dropped Ron’s bags of purchases and Draco off at their dorm, before making their way over to Harry’s. He side-eyed his red-headed friend as they began their walk, not wanting to push him into revealing whatever was bugging him, but he knew Ron would spit it out eventually, no matter how weird or embarrassing it was, though, at this point, Harry didn’t really know how Ron could think anything was embarrassing between the two of them. They’d known each other for so long and literally talked about everything that there wasn’t really a subject that could phase them, probably. And it’s not like they didn’t hang out over the summer and know everything about each other anyway. But Harry let Ron think through it and take his time. Eventually Ron decided to just make small talk on their way to Ravenclaw Tower and Harry went along with it, prattling on about classes and what their professors might be like, not wanting to make his friend any more uncomfortable than he already was. It wasn’t until they closed the door behind them and looked around Harry’s new living area that Ron turned to Harry, ears burning.
“That’d be nice,” Draco said softly in return, “We can talk about the space and all that stuff too, right?”
“That zombie comedy show with Drew Barrymore, it’s actually amazing! I just got to the middle of the second season.” Ron explained as he reached his doorframe, picked up his backpack, and turned back to face Draco.
“Oh that’s so nice, I was wondering how you knew her. I saw her around a bit last year, but I never knew who she was. Her hair is pretty noticeable”
At some point, Ron wandered out of the dorm to let his boyfriend in the building. Draco was confident the two of them had been texting consistently since Draco had arrived. He mentioned that to Harry and Hermione in Ron’s absence, in a joking way, and they smiled almost identical knowing smiles at him.
“Okay, yeah,” Ron said, “so what would be something that you haven’t done yet that you would be nervous to do?”
Draco considered, at this point used to how comfortable Ron was with other people, and then nodded. He kneeled up from where he was sitting and Ron scootched over so he was able to lay down on his back, his side pressed comfortably against the wall, head resting on a pillow. Draco unfolded himself beside him, laying his own head on a pillow and stretching his legs out towards the end of the bed. There was a softness between them, that relaxed Draco more than he thought it would.
“The three of us are sophomores,” said Hermione, “but I’m the only one with a declared major. Do you have a major?” Ron and Harry both rolled their eyes at her, but in a loving kind of way, Draco noticed. He made a mental note to ask Ron about his friends later.
They smiled at each other and Draco can’t think of anything much to say. He looked down at the school supplies in front of him and tried to come up with something to add, feeling his face flush in embarrassment. Harry beat him to it, thankfully, by continuing to talk and not letting the pause last beyond slight discomfort.
They ended up both sitting on Ron’s bed, Ron leaning against his pillows and Draco cross-legged and hesitant. Ron had retrieved the last of the ice-cream (mint chocolate chip) from his freezer and two spoons before situating himself and Draco found it relieving to have something to focus on aside from his roommate. He was a bit lost, however, not sure how to proceed now that he and Ron were in this position. Draco fiddled with the spoon in his hands before reaching forward and scooping out some ice-cream, figuring that it was better to do something than just sit and wait. He wondered briefly at the fact that he hadn’t had real food that day other than the sandwich at Madam Puddifoot’s, but shoved that thought away as the cold cream melting in his mouth and flooded his taste buds with overwhelming minty sweetness.
“Definitely, but not in a bad way,” Draco said and then moved over to his second to last box, pulling out a water heater, some non-perishable food, and plastic eating utensils. “The barista at Puddifoot’s, Tonks, she was in that class with me two years ago.”
“I can help you too,” Hermione offered, “I’m pretty decent at these kinds of things, too.” She said this in a way that implied she was good at school in general not just statistics, the type of person who never got grades lower than a B.
We hope that you return to your studies and this school, but we understand if you chose not to. Please make a decision as soon as you are able, preferably before this coming Fall semester starts or the Spring semester after it so that we can give our transfer student the time they need to prepare.
[to Scarface 1:27] my mom just left too - maybe theyll run into eachother. new roommate’s here. gonna say hi. txt me when you get to prefect ill let you up.
Ron Weasley was tired and bored. His mother had finally finished organizing everything in his room without consulting him at all about what he wanted. His father had already come and gone, making sure Ron was comfortable and had what he needed before giving him a short hug and wishing him good luck, before running off to his job he was already late for. Ron’s mom didn’t stay longer than she had to, either, though it felt like she had been there for a good amount time. She left him with a quick kiss on the cheek, a tight hug, and a promise to take him out to dinner in two weeks. He was used to it by now, they had done the same thing last year, and he saw them do the same for all his older siblings when they moved into their dorms or apartments, no matter how old they were. He found it quite endearing, if he was going to be honest with himself, and felt a rush of love for his parents as he watched his mother make her walk down the hallway to the elevator that would take her away. Ron knew this tradition was coming to a close, however, as he was the last and youngest child of the Weasley family. Of course, his parents would always do this kind of thing whenever he or any of his siblings moved locations, but it was strange to realize that this year and the next two were the last times they would ever move one of their children into a college dorm.
Fifteen minutes later, he was still sitting in the waiting room, struggling to balance picking classes, making a schedule, and the effort to feel motivated to do those things. Draco had sighed to himself more than once, each time, catching Harry’s attention away from his book. Finally, at the fourth noisy sigh, Harry called out to Draco from his desk, “Do you need some help?”
“Nice.” Harry said simply. Draco figured he either wasn’t interested in why Draco had taken time off of school or had picked up on the fact that he didn’t want to talk about it, because Harry shifted the subject and began asking him questions about classes he had taken before and what he wanted to study. They worked on a class list and a schedule for a little while, Harry reminding Draco of general education requirements he needed to complete and helping him research the professors to make sure they were the kind of teachers that Draco could handle. It was a mostly easy process; Draco found that he was feeling calmer and only sighed a few more times. He ended up enrolling in five classes, but knew that he could drop one of them if he wanted to - if it ended up being too much. His schedule was kind of a mess and he had classes on Fridays, but that wasn’t a big deal and he couldn’t think of anything he would be doing over the weekend anyway. Harry was actually going to be in one of the classes he was going to take - History of Sexuality - and Draco was slightly relieved. He was sure that Harry would have other friends in the class and might not remember him, but it would be nice to see a familiar face every once in awhile.
“Of course,” Draco said, “thank you for telling me, though.” He would not have guessed it, but that spoke more to his general obliviousness than anything, he was familiar with how close Blaise and Hermione were.
Draco was taken aback by the question and merely shook his head, weirded out that she would offer him a cookie in the first place. Ms. McGonagall seemed to notice his surprise and her eyes crinkled in a way that seemed like she was hiding a smile.
“Good. Follow me, please.” She turned back the way she had come, Draco stood swiftly and followed her, watching the tight bun she had pulled her hair into at the back of her head move up and down as she walked. The hallway wasn’t very long, but they passed a significant amount of rooms which Draco assumed were offices before they turned left into Room 1031. Ms. McGonagall stepped behind her desk and sat down, motioning for Draco to settle into the seat opposite from her. Draco noticed a jar of cookies and a small stuffed dragon that disrupted the organized desk in front of him. She saw him looking around and said, “Mr. Malfoy, would you like a cookie?”
Draco took the card from the box and flipped it over to read the back. “It’s one of the librarians, Irma Pince. I remember her. She was rather unpleasant.”
“Give us a second,” Ron said standing up and looking down at his boyfriend, “I have a present for you, remember?” Krum nodded and pushed himself off the floor. The two of them walked to Ron’s room and shut the door behind them. Draco got up as well to get his phone and wallet from where he left them on his desk. He looked over at the unmade bed with posters laying on top of it and the boxes scattered around his room. He sighed as he realized he probably wouldn’t have the energy to deal with all of it that night and resolved to have it all unpacked by tomorrow evening, even if he wanted to spend time with these new people.
Ron was glad to note that no one had been sending them annoyed, though usually amused, looks or anything, so he assumed his and Krum’s moment hadn’t caught anyone’s attention. He liked being sappy with his boyfriend, and usually, his friends didn’t mind, but with a new person with them, it made sense to keep their PDA to a minimum. He wiggled up from Krum and the bean bag just as Harry managed to bring up Deadpool on the TV and headed for the bathroom.
“Thanks Ron,” He said, before continuing to expand, “and yeah, no, nothing weird or bad happened. I just had a lot of thoughts that came out of it. And I thought you might be a good person to talk to, seeing as you and Harry and Hermione are kind of the center, and you have an established relationship. I figured you might have a more holistic viewpoint to share.” Draco talked with his hands, but only noticed them in his peripheral vision, his eyes trained evenly on the bumpy white texture of the ceiling above.
“We’re happy to know you,” Hermione said kindly, “and you can meet a few more of our friends if you come with us to dinner. You game?”
Draco placed his messenger bag in his lap and opened it in order extract his laptop and earphones to shuffle through his music as he scrolled mostly aimlessly through the internet. Placing his bag down on the floor in front of him a moment later, Draco slipped off his shoes and curled up on his couch, his computer secure on his stomach, warming his belly as it worked. Over the next hour, there was movement around him, his fellow Lounge loungers shifting in their seats with an occasional person stepping into or out of the room, but Draco was lost to them, so engrossed in his own endeavors that he almost forgot to check the time. Luckily, he managed to glance at the clock on his screen to realize that he only had ten minutes to get to his next class. He knew he didn't really need to worry that much, after all, it was syllabus week and it never took that long to get through the various buildings in Hogwarts - but that didn't stop Draco from unceremoniously untangling himself from the comfortable seat and scrambling to pull his things together. He made his way as quickly and quietly as possible out of the Lounge, nodded awkwardly to one of the students who looked up as he passed, and made his way out of the Common Room.
Hermione voiced her agreement and also suggested that they start popping the popcorn now, rather than waiting for the two boys to arrive.
As Sirius walked confidently down the path leading to the walkways that are framed by university buildings and fall accented trees. He could feel some of the appreciative glances shot his way by passersby, but he didn't spend the energy engaging, as most of them are probably his godson’s age and that’s just a no all around. At some point, he felt a buzz from the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out his phone. As he texted, he walked slowly forward, trying not to get in anyone’s way but not wanting to halt just yet
“For sure, and he’ll be coming with me and Mom and Hagrid to the Weasleys, for at least one meal. I mean I miss Molly’s cooking for a few months here and there, I can’t imagine not having it for a full year.”
The three of them ate quietly for a few moments. Draco then stood up to get himself a glass of water and asked if either Harry or Blaise wanted some too and they both said yes. A few minutes later, Draco was making his way slowly across the Great Hall, his fingers stretched over the three cups, so as not to spill any water. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone approaching him so he came to a stop. Turning his head slightly he realized it was one of Theo’s friends and found himself unsure what to do. The man walked up to him and offered a strange smile which Draco did not return.
Draco looked up to see Ron nod knowingly before informing them that Harry was on the way over from Ravenclaw Tower but Hermione would just meet them there because her dorm in Gryffindor Tower was really close to Madam Puddifoot’s coffee house. Upon hearing this new, the three of them rose from their seated positions and began the descent out of the building. Draco wondered if any of his new friends did anything without each other but was kind of glad for it. It would be easier for him to get to know them in groups rather than individually, if only for the fact that he wouldn’t have to worry so much about carrying a conversation without the support of other people. When they met Harry at the front edge of the courtyard outside the Prefect dormitory complex, he gave Ron an enthusiastic sideways hug and smiled brightly at the other two men. As they walked, Draco and Harry fell into step together, Ron and Krum trailing after them holding hands and talking quietly to each other about the next venue Krum and his band were going to perform at. Harry asked Draco if he had bought his textbooks yet and Draco stopped feeling so unsure of himself. Their conversation could be easy and safe, flutter around Draco in a comforting cloud which boosted his confidence.
“Not yet. I looked over the textbook list once you helped me chose the classes,” he answered, looking out in front of them, noticing the buildings and people around them, “but I remember what it was like when I was here a while ago, so I figured I would wait until classes start to see what the professors actually want from us.”
Startled, Draco complied and took one. As he bit into it, he remembered one of the questions that he had forgotten. “I remembered one of the questions that I wanted to ask you!” He said and Ms. McGonagall inclined her head in a manner that told him to share his thought. He chewed his bite and swallowed before asking “Do I need to get a dorm on campus? I, uh, I, have a house already. It’s not too far away, but I was just wondering about that.”
“I thought so as well,” he said. “Would it be ok with you if I moved my minifridge into the main area? It doesn’t hold much, but it takes up space in my room and it could be useful out there, especially if we have nights like this again.”
The Common Room was a tall, beautiful building in the middle of campus. One side of the building - the one facing away from the school buildings and on-campus housing, and instead looking out at the forest and greenery off in the distance - was made completely of glass, displaying the large array of comfy couches and coffee tables within, along with computer labs and small office spaces throughout its three floors. Draco made his way through a set of glass doors and his nose greeted by the smell of fresh coffee and baked goods. He walked slowly through the first floor of the building until he got to a set of elevators. Stepping into the one that opened and spilled a few people out, he pressed a button for the third floor and waited, listening distractedly to the muffled sounds of the elevator mechanics working around him. Upon reaching his destination, Draco made his way to a sizable room labeled “The Lounge.” The Lounge was a cozy space with a fireplace that was almost always lit and full of soft, slightly worn couches which one could sink into comfortably. Draco had discovered the Lounge during his first semester at Hogwarts while looking through the Common Room for a place to sit away from the swarms of students. He had stumbled across it his fourth week into school and ended up spending a lot of time there. It was nice to find that the Lounge had not changed at all during Draco’s absence, and that in itself was surreal and slightly disorienting. It was blissfully quiet with only a few other students in the room, far enough away from each other that it wouldn’t be awkward for Draco to pick his favorite spot - the huge light grey loveseat by a window - and plop himself down, resituating himself in such a familiar place.
“Yeah” he said and Krum wiggled down his body faster than he had the last time. He pressed kisses into Ron’s thighs before placing his hands where he wanted them. As Krum let one of his fingers dip into him, he moved it slowly and gently. His other hand reached for the bottle of lubricant that had slipped onto the floor when they removed the blanket. He uncapped it and took his finger out of Ron’s body so he could coat it in lube.
“Oh, I’m not,” She smiled over at him, her hair fluttered slightly in the soft end-of-summer air, “Sometimes I like sitting in classes I don’t have to see what they’re like. Professor Vector was nice about it last semester.”
They were in an odd position on the bed, with Ron lying down fully on it a bit sideways, the pillows and blankets mostly still in place, and Krum somehow half on the bed, half kneeling on the floor as he continued his descent. He smiled into Ron’s hip as he noticed this and then pushed his legs straighter so he could get back on the bed. Krum moved between Ron’s legs, folding his own under him, and placed each of his hands on one of Ron’s hips. He trailed his fingers along the skin, along the tops of Ron’s legs, moving closer and closer to the warm, soon-to-be-if-not-already wet v between them. He flicked his eyes up to meet Ron’s and sent him a silent question, making sure it was ok for him to proceed.
When he returned, Krum had snagged another butterbeer and replaced their empty bag of popcorn with and movie-theater box of snow caps. Ron snatched up a Hogwarts University-edition™  chocolate frog box before sitting back down and accepting the bottle from his boyfriend. He drank from it before passing it back and opening the box. He groaned softly after pulling the card out from under the chocolate frog and checking who was on it.
“Creevey was also a bit of a mess. He stayed up really late a lot, he’d let me turn out the light, but he wasn’t very quiet.”
Sirius grinned easily before answering, “That’s a good question; one I am trying to figure out myself. I used to help run a daycare and tutor high school kids in English on the side.” He paused, and added, “But I took time off to travel Europe for a while and haven’t decided what to do with myself now that I’m back. Mostly been spending time with family and babysitting the grandkids, you know how it goes.”
It took Ron and Krum a few moments to untangle themselves, Draco noticed and thought it was very endearing. As the day passed, Draco felt more and more comfortable with this group of people, letting himself curl up on his chair in a very un-Malfoy-ish way, with his knees drawn up to his chest so his entire body was on the seat and under the blanket he pulled out of his room during the second movie. His blanket had kept him warm and cozy when he shifted under it every so often, but he certainly hadn’t felt as comfy as Ron and Krum had, cuddled up together sharing body heat. Even Harry, Hermione, and Blaise managed to make a notably uncomfortable couch warm and welcoming. Draco and Cedric had been the only one without people to share space with, which didn’t seem to phase Cedric in the slightest as he burrowed into Blaise’s bean bag chair. Draco didn’t let this phase him either. In fact, he had had quite a fantastic night by all standards - with good food and good company and fun, silly movies to enjoy. But he as he watched his new friends beginning to move around the room, eat little snacks here and there as they cleared the garbage and tried to return the room back to its original space, he couldn’t help but feel exhausted. It was a good kind of tired, though, not like the empty tiredness that had plagued him throughout the summer. It seeped in his bones in a very different way, heavy, but not debilitating. Draco unfolded his body from his chair and wrapped the blanket around his shoulders, not wanting to part from it. He collected a few wrappers and the chocolate frog boxes into the trash bag that Cedric passed to him.
Throughout the chocolate-frog conversation, Hermione and Blaise had turned on the closed captioning of the movie and were commenting to each other about what was happening. Ron glanced down at Rowena Ravenclaw smiling up at him from the card and shared an annoyed look with Harry. He tossed it to where the other two cards lay and then settled back against Krum, who took a bite out of the frog when Ron offered, to watch Deadpool.
“No problem. Honestly, It’s nice to say out loud every once in a while.” Blaise turned so that he was once again sitting with his back against the wall. He leaned his head back against it, his neck elongated and beautiful. “I like to be able to appreciate how amazing she is, even from a friendly distance.”
“Moms are like that I suppose.” Sirius wouldn’t know, however, as his mom had never been proud of anything he did and had cut him off when he turned 16 - but now was not the time, especially when he was getting to know this new lovely man that he definitely wanted to spend more time with. Remus nodded sagely at his words and took a rather enormous bite from his croissant. Sirius, not sure what else to say, mimicked him and they chewed in happy silence for a moment.
Blaise said, “They’re always like that,” to Draco. But before he could respond Hermione laughed and said, “He knows, we warned him already.”
“So sorry,” he said, handing the items over to the person he assumed was a professor or at least a TA based on appearance and material alone.
“We got everything!” Cedric was saying to the general room, “candy, chips, ice-cream for later - hope you don’t mind if we use your freezer Ron, figured it wouldn’t be a problem. Oh, and some things called Cauldron Cakes,” he lifted his left arm, as if to show off the cake buried deep within the selection of grocery bags hanging off of it,  “the Honeydukes owner, can’t remember her name, lovely woman, though, said they were the new dessert of the season! And the sample she gave us was delicious.”
Harry and Hermione moved to sit on the couch which wasn’t a very big or comfy one so  Ron went to his room and pulled out one of the folding chairs his dad left him. He sat down on the other side of the coffee table. He was about to ask the two about their summers when Draco emerged from his room.
Draco went back into his home, into the now empty entrance hall, his hair still slightly damp from his shower not having dried in the cool morning air. He stood on the marble floor and slowly turned, eyes roving over the staircases that lead away from him, the heavy wooden doors, the side tables and vases of flowers and the paintings on the wall that he had known his whole life. He had done this two years ago when he first embarked on a journey to college, and now, doing so once again, he felt a few loose pieces fitting together in his chest. He knew he had made the right choice.
“Yeah,” Ron said, looking up from his own phone, “he texted me too. Are we doing anything? I mean, none of us really made plans.”
By the time it was Midterms, Harry was pretty confident in his new friendship with Draco. There were a lot of things about each other that they did not know and so many boundaries between them that only needed time to fade away, but none of that was bad, it felt good, and it left a lot of room for them to grow into their relationship. Draco, however, did not seem to be very confident about anything at present. Whereas Harry often thought of himself as an average student, he managed to be quite good at time management and diligently working through stress rather than succumbing to it. His new friend, on the other hand, seemed to drown a bit under the stress of due dates and large graded assignments. Draco’s time managing skills were decent when he had encouragement of others and felt passionately about the work that he had to do, but due to anxiety that often felt crippling and assignments that either were too important to him or not important enough, those skills did not matter - Draco could plan all he wanted, but it was really difficult for him to just
“Yeah, that makes sense, and being on campus when it’s quiet is nice.” Harry mused and then answered the question, “I’m gonna go see my mom and step-dad for a few days and then spend the rest of it with Ron’s family. Hermione’ll probably join us at some point. And I wouldn’t put it past Krum to show up too, at least once.” He paused and glanced up at Draco’s eyes, ensuring his attention, “you’re more than welcome to come by as well - if you want a break from the monotony of campus. Ron’s parents love hosting people.”
“Well I have to finish unpacking,” Draco spoke up, the corners of his mouth turning down a bit, “so I’m just going to head back to Prefect once I finish my coffee.”
“It’s either Clara or Aidan about music stuff or Cedric about dorm stuff,” Ron supplied needlessly, though Draco was quietly grateful for it. They all nodded - Draco doing so because everyone else did.
She laughed and then said, “Blaise and Luna are gonna join us. I saw them come in. They’re just gonna get some food and then head over.”
They walked back to the original study room and rejoined their friends just as they began the next, and last, study break. Harry smiled, a bit knowingly, at Draco and the hickeys that were beginning to form as he sat back down in his chair. Draco didn’t let himself dwell on it too much. He chose not to say anything, but return to his flashcards once more. He really needed to process this development - not in a bad way, he had never done this kind of thing before with friends with this much intentionality. But maybe, in this group of friends, platonic kissing was a normal thing. He didn’t think Blaise would have been this forward with him if it wasn’t an established kind of thing in some way. Draco definitely didn’t mind it. He wondered if that meant that more people were randomly making out with each other. Was Harry? And what about Ron and Krum - did they ever let someone else into their relationship? Now that he thought about it, if his own interactions could be understood as flirting, there was a fair amount of it that everyone seemed to engage in. He hadn’t thought anything more of it before, but thinking back on his own conversations and those he had seen around him... He wondered about Tonks and if it was possible they had been flirting too, even when he didn’t know it.
“Yeah, and I mean, it really hasn’t been all that bad. The first week of classes went by really smoothly - though, admittedly, it’s only syllabus week, so who really knows - and I’ve made a couple of friends since I got on campus, which I guess was about two and a little weeks ago.”
Unsurprisingly, Draco had a nightmare the night before the day he moved to school, it was mostly due to the anxiety coursing through his veins, but he blamed it on his Criminal Minds marathon the day before. Draco woke up and blearily blinked up at the clock on his bedside table, realizing it was two hours earlier than he wanted to wake up. He shakily tumbled out of bed and into his shower, willing the heat of the water to melt the tension away. Draco spent a long time in the shower. He sat down on the floor of it, the water rushing down on his head, and breathed. The warmth helped him feel better, quelling the doubts and fears that clouded his mind and the after-effects of the terrible thing he dreamed about but could no longer remember. He took pleasure in of his morning erection just because he could, letting himself relax even further. Draco gave himself the mental space to think through everything - just in case - so that when he stepped out of the shower and faced the reality of the day, he would be okay.
“No one will, I promise,” he said, setting his bag down on one of the sides, “I do this all the time. Everyone’s too focused on their own lives to notice other people leaving their stuff around. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone getting their stuff stolen - at least not in this way.”
[to Krumcake 2:12] yeah come over when you want. it was pretty easy moving in and mom left me trix yogurt can you believe that? ill give you one if you want :) the new roommate seems nice but quiet probs wont be as bad as last year. missed seeing your face - come over soon pretty please with a [cherry emoji] on top
Ron flashed him a tiny grin and said, “It’s silly really, and you probably don’t want to hear about mine and Krum’s sex life, but…” Ron trailed off and looked down as his lap, freckles bright.
It didn’t take long for Draco to decide that he wanted to go back to school. In fact, he barely had begun his process of pro-con-ing the idea when he realized it was probably the right thing to do. He was endlessly bored in his home and very much did not want to re-join the general workforce. He was sure there were other options to consider, like traveling or creating some kind of project for himself, but both of those things probably took an extraordinary amount of planning in comparison with returning to his studies. He filled out the forms and faxed it to the school, figuring he had already opened the letter later than he was supposed to and did not want to have them wait much longer to answer. He also asked Mr. Dobby to place a call to the university in order to schedule an in-person meeting with Ms. McGonagall and set everything in order.
“Malfoy, right?” She asked before he could say anything. He nodded and she smirked. “Oh yeah, I have a great memory. We had a class together my sophomore year.”
“Well I thought Deadpool was a good option. I mean I don’t really know what kind of movies you guys like, but that is of one of those movies that are good for a group. That, or maybe we could watch a few episodes of Bob's Burgers - can’t go wrong there.”
“Definitely!” Sirius assured before making his way over the counter once more, this time to place a much different order.
Before he could say anything else though, Harry said, “Yeah, um, and you’re Draco. Nice to see you again, man!”
“Hey,” he said softly, and Krum got lost for a moment in his wide clear blue eyes as the finger fell away.
In the week following the phone call, Draco split his time actually readings the some of the books scattered around his room, caving into watching Netflix, and anxiously checking his suitcases to make sure he had everything he would need. He tried to reassure himself that because the mansion was close to the school, he could always drive back to it and get what he forgot, but the thought of leaving this home tied his stomach in knots every once in awhile - and he had to make sure. The new worlds he read and watched took his mind off most of it and the food that Mr. Dobby had started to bring to him, either in his room or the entertainment room, helped made him feel more substantial. Draco hadn’t asked his butler to do this, but allowed him to without protest once he started. He figured that this was just Mr. Dobby’ way of showing that he would miss him and left it at that.
“One minute,” he said loudly in the direction of the door as he slipped a shirt on and then proceeded to stumble across the small room to open it. Ron stood in the doorframe, his day clothes and smile making Draco self-conscious of his disorderly appearance.
I guess I just wanted to add a quick reminder that this is literally just self-indulgence. and that I'm a cis, white, queer woman so I don't know everything - but I have been consulting with my trans and nonbinary friends as well as doing research - if I write something that's not ok or offensive, it was an honest mistake that I would love to learn from, so please let me know. also - in the market for a beta, because I am definitely editing this on my own right now
Draco’s eyes opened to the bright summer morning having forgotten to close his windows and curtains the day before, which was not something unusual. In response, Draco generally would shift onto his stomach, stick his head under his pillow and hope to fall asleep once more. It only worked half the time. This morning, Draco allowed himself to be woken up by the light and the sounds of summer insects that never truly went away. He sat up slowly, heard his joints cracking with the movement and enjoyed the stretch of his skin and muscles as he began to use them. Yawning, he headed to the bathroom down the hallway from his room, removing his shorts as he went. After a shower that helped relieve the knots of tension that had formed in his sleep, Draco dried off, put on a new pair of boxers, and made his way down to the small dining area where he knew breakfast would be. He hadn’t been down to this part of the house in over two weeks, choosing instead to utilize the small kitchen in a separate wing of the Manor that was kept well stocked but did not have much traffic. His mother’s butler, Mr. Dobby, brought him a stack of mail to look at as he sat down.
Harry sighed, slightly frustrated at himself at his lack of self-control the night before, “yeah, you’re right.”
Draco looked down at his hands which were holding twisted strangely around the half-eaten sweet. His experiences of the past few months floated through his mind - the boredom that snaked its way through his veins, the dust that settled on his skin from the unused air of the still and quiet mansion that surrounded him. He took a small breath before meeting her bespectacled eyes, “I’ve thought about this a bit since I sent in the fax with my information. I do want to live on campus in a dorm - but in a single. I don’t think I could handle living with another person.” He flushed slightly and looked away. “ There wasn’t anything wrong with the roommate I had a few years ago - Theo was fine. I think I just need my own space.”
“You don’t have to, if you don’t want, but we talked about this kinda thing a little at the end of last semester, so I thought I get one just in case, you know, just to see. I’ve tried it on a few times, to see what it was like, with a vibrator in me.” Ron’s words came out in a rush, but not a nervous one which Krum was relieved to note.
Please do not hesitate to call for any questions or concerns regarding this letter, the additional documents, or anything else.
Krum looked up sharply as Ron came back into the room and his face must not have looked normal because Ron set his bathroom kit down hastily on his desk and climbed onto the bed. Ron moved into Krum’s space, took the pillow out of his hands and replaced it with his own. They sat facing each other for a moment before Krum rushed forward, pecked Ron on the lips, and leaned back against the wall to watch Ron’s reaction. Ron didn’t skip a beat. He unfolded his legs and crawled into Krum’s lap, pulling Krum forward so he could wrap his arms around his neck. Krum shifted so that Ron’s legs could wrap around his waist as well.
“Yeah I mean I don’t mean to, it just happens, you know that.” They smiled at each other, and he pressed on, “I’ve noticed him and Tonks, they’ve gone out for drinks a few times. Who else does he flirt with?”
“Yeah, sure it wasn’t a big deal. Someone staying in your bed doesn’t really affect me,”  he tried to say a teasingly. Ron sent him a little smirk before softening his face and informing him that it might be a common occurrence and Draco reassured him that he didn’t mind.
“Well I guess we’ll just have to see.” Krum responded distractedly. His train of thought regarding family reminded him of the picture on Ron’s bedside table. He felt the warmth wash over his body once again - not that he was cold or anything to begin with. He moved his hands so they were resting on Ron’s hips. “I just wanted to say, though - on a different note - I really like that picture of us and that you put it on your bedside table. I get that it means a lot and I just, it makes me happy, and I love you a lot.” It was Krum’s turn to blush, thought he saw the happiness in Ron’s eyes as they flicked from the table back to Krum’s face.
Draco straightened up and looked over to where Hermione and Harry were sitting - on his bed. He smiled and leaned against his desk to talk to them.
“Yeah, but that’s okay,” Krum said, “I want everyone to know how much I love you, even if we gross ‘em out a bit. They don’t really mind, though. Well I don’t know about your new roommate, but everyone else is -”
Harry, in a similar fashion to Ron, changed position as he talked. He moved so he was laying on his side, facing Ron, wanting to look at his face. He lifted his head on the pillow to be more comfortable and bent his knees slightly in the space under Ron’s own bent legs. “Hey, wait, Ron, you know sex isn’t all about penetration and you
“I’m excited to see Quidditch International with you all over break,” he ventured after a little while.
To the soft sounds of Ron’s sighs above him, Krum got his boyfriend off. Ending up with three fingers in his cunt and a thumb rubbing at his clit. Krum moved his fingers playfully, rubbing with intent against the walls of Ron’s vagina, taking his time to make sure Ron was open and ready for his cock, ensuring that there would be no pain in this interaction. Though Ron eventually had to a hand over his mouth to muffle any sounds he was making, so as not to bother their neighbor, his body responding enticingly to everything Krum did. It wasn’t until Ron came twice before he asked Krum to grab the condom and told him he was ready. Ron grinned at his boyfriend and shifted in the bed so that he was half sitting up once Krum grabbed the condom with his free hand. Ron brought a finger under Krum’s chin, moving his head so they could look at each other again. Krum let breathed out wetly against Ron’s hand, his eyes and face flushed with desire as he refocused. “Come on, Krumcake, get that cock inside me. Don’t wanna wait any longer.” It didn’t take long for Krum to do exactly what Ron wanted.
“I don’t know, it was weird.” Draco answered, “This random guy walked up to me and asked if I was Theo’s - my roommate a while ago - friend and if I had said yes, would have asked me to come sit with him. I didn’t recognize him at all.”
“Parvati said there’s something weird with the minifridge we ordered,” Hermione informed Harry while texting Parvati back, “how’s your RA dorm by the way? You haven’t said anything about it.”
The man smiled, “sure, I got time.” If Sirius would say so, and he would, the man seemed rather pleased by the offer.
The blonde one, most likely his roommate, nodded and said, “Yeah, if - if you want. I just got some more boxes and a suitcase. Oh, and I’m Draco by the way, Draco Malfoy.” Ron recognized the last name, from where he wasn’t sure.
She paused before speaking, as if she wanted to chose her words carefully for him, and she probably did. He knew that she didn’t want him to feel guilty about their lack of correspondence, but his life and his choices did not exist within a vacuum and they affected her as well, to some extent. At the very least, she was his best friend who had a right to know what was going on his life and be able to help him through it. He knew all that, but was glad she took her time before sharing her next words - the words themselves not being that important, but her understanding of him and what he needed to hear was, to show him that she truly was a friend of him and was someone he could rely on. “It’s ok, love, but I didn’t want to push you too much before, and now to see that you’ve managed to change you life so completely is startling. I just want to know how you are and how I can fit in. The drama and ridiculousness of my life can wait a bit until we talk more about
Ron huffed out a semi-amused bread and said, “Well yeah, but like, I mean we’ve never done the Ron-is-on-top in a penetrative kinda way, you know?”
Krum chuckled and then pushed off the bed. Ron scrambled up after him and quickly stripped the top blanket from the bed. He bundled it up and put on in the chair at his desk. Krum pulled back the normal blanket and top sheet to the end of the bed. Ron came up and pulled him into another kiss, moving their bodies back onto the bed. Krum shifted his weight to begin to move down the bed again, but Ron held him close to his body, “just wanna feel you for a bit,” he muttered and nipped at Krum’s jaw. Krum indulged his boyfriend’s request by pressing a little more firmly on his body and peppering his face with kisses. Eventually he asked into Ron’s neck, “is it ok if I finger you a for a bit, it’s just been so long since I’ve made you come.”
Once in Madam Puddifoot’s, Sirius took Remus’ order as the man went to grab a table, heading over the counter to place both with the barista. It was short work and Sirius decided to add in a couple of chocolate croissants as well, hoping that Remus liked butter and chocolate.
“He didn’t use to be like this, you know,” Hermione said pointedly to Draco, “Harry learned his bad habits from the red-haired devil sitting across from you, or at least that’s what his mom says. Don’t let Ron’s lack of barbaricness now convince you otherwise.” Harry began nodding again enthusiastically and Hermione told him to swallow his food before he choked himself. Draco picked at his food, letting their conversation wash over him in a comforting way. He was a bit dazed at how accepting of him they were already, but it didn’t feel wrong, just new and different.
“Oh nice! So he’s back from Europe then? How long’s it been?” Before Harry could answer, one of the servers came by with their sandwiches. They both sat quietly as he placed them in front of them, before thanking him as he walked away.
“No worries,” Hermione assured him, smiling at the newcomers. She looked over at Cho and introduced herself and Harry along with their pronouns. Cho returned the gesture with her own name and pronouns, throwing in her major and class year as an added measure. It turned out she was a senior - older than all of them, including Draco. She and Luna had been platonically dating throughout the semester so far and they had decided maybe it was time for her to meet the rest of Luna’s friends.
“True. No, I don’t go to Hogwarts, but my godson is a student here. I’m picking him up for the break. He has classes still, so I’ve just been walking around while I wait.” Sirius sipped from his own drink, “That’s a really interesting spread of subjects you cover; I studied English Lit when I was in university and took some of those kinds of classes, mostly to fill out electives. Never took Judaic studies though.”
sorry for presuming we were on the same page. I’m glad you think I’m kissable though” Draco could tell he grinned out in his peripheral vision, “I did mean the question in a platonic way, just so you know. I thought I would ask you now since we’ve been getting along rather nicely and we’re alone.”
“Oh god, same,” They smiled at each other. “Not to abruptly change the subject, or anything, and we can definitely return to this line of inquiry if you want,” Harry said with amusement, and then continued, “but have you figured out your plans for break yet?”
“That’s true,” Blaise said, and they sat in the room in silence for several beats. “Well, maybe we should head back, unless you want to review some more of the math...?”
Draco returned Harry’s phone and thanked him. They walked in silence for a few moments. He realized that he hadn’t really been paying attention to where they were going - he was watching the things around him, but zoned in on the small exchange so much that he was surprised when they turned a corner on the sidewalk and were only a few steps away from the coffeehouse.
“Yeah, um, well, I guess because we both have our own rooms, we don’t have to worry about getting in each other’s way or messiness. But we do share the bathroom and the common area.” Draco answered, gesturing behind him to Ron’s open door.
sincere apologies for this taking so long and that is is a bit shorter than my previous chapters. will try to post the next one a bit sooner, but no promises, mostly because of school and anxiety. hope this chapter is as enjoyable to read as it was for me to write!
“Do you wanna tell me what’s been on your mind the past few days?” Ron asked, quietly. Draco nodded.
“I guess I don’t actually need help, I just wanted to talk to someone about it other than Krum. I mean he’s my boyfriend so of course we talked and are talking about it. But like, I’ve never done something like this before! It’s a bit nerve wracking.” As he talked, Ron moved to lay on his back. His head lay in the space below Harry’s extended arm, and his his knees folded up so his feet were flat on the bed. Settled, he rest his hands on the flat of his abdomen and joined Harry’s observation of the ceiling.
That night, as he picked his way though General Tso’s chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce, Draco contemplated the life he was currently embarking on. His parents had died when Draco was just about to start his Spring semester of his Freshman year, a year and a half ago. He pulled himself out of school and took some time away from, well, everything. He found himself a few menial and mind-numbing part time jobs throughout the later progression of months to keep himself from dwelling too much on the reality of his life. At the beginning of this specific summer, however, he decided to quit his job and spent most of it moping around the house his family left behind. It wasn’t like Draco really needed the job, but it had been a nice thing to pass the time and find some sort of responsibility. The problem was that the job that he managed to acquire ended up boring him too much, which was why he quit in the first place. But it also had become tiresome to interact with customers and often Draco left his job feeling more uncomfortable than not in his own skin. In leaving his post, he created a situation that allowed him to be just as bored and uncomfortable, but in the privacy of his own home instead of at a commercial institution. That night, Draco didn’t so much fall asleep as he did melt into his bed and let his consciousness bleed away once he had finished his dinner, mostly because he couldn’t think of anything better to do. The next morning was a little different.
Between all that and managing the front desk of the administration building every other morning, Harry had been the busiest he could remember being at the start of a semester. It was a relief when Ron texted, asking him to accompany him and Draco to the on-campus supermarket-type-thing, Diagon Alley. The building had always seemed a bit weird to Harry, it’s lopsided walls and strange, swirly decorations gave it an eery, fluorescent vibe and the merchandise it sold was honestly a bit wacky. It, of course, had most of the necessary foodstuffs that small grocery stores should, but it also stocked rows and rows of large, strangely colored objects and had tanks of polkadotted lizards in random aisles.
“Yeah, of course. I don’t really wanna try something new right now anyway,” Ron said and then moved back onto the bed fully, pulling at Krum’s arm as he did, “just wanna keep it on the table.”
Harry took pity on the look of mild confusion on Draco’s face and explained to him that Clara Ivanova and Aidan Lynch were two members of Krum’s band. They had an on-and-off drummer, Tony Silva, but they could never really count on him. They had been working together for about three years now and had a small following. “They’re band’s kinda weird. Because we know Krum to be mostly a fluffball, but when he’s on stage he looks grouchy and mean and his eyebrows scrunch up into a unibrow. And Clara’s like that too. She kind of reminds me of Ginny - Ron’s sister- because of the red hair and she’s a really nice person but when she’s up on stage, she looks like she could reach her hand into your chest, tear out your heart, and eat it, just for the fun of it. Aidan’s kinda chill all the time though, but that’s mostly just because he’s a stoner.” Harry continued, “Band’s called Quidditch International, it was supposed to be a joke, but no one understands it except for them, I think even Ron doesn’t know what it means.”
Pushing these thoughts away, Draco made the decision to masturbate in the shower and not in bed like he would have normally preferred. Even if he was in a room by himself, it was still new and uncomfortable. He stepped a little bit away from the spray of the water so that it was still warm on his back, but so that it wouldn’t wash away the body soap that he used as like lubricant to move his hand smoothly up and down his cock. He took his time, squeezing at his head and thumbing over his slit, teasing himself and enjoying this simple, familiar pleasure. When he felt it building and the tell-tale ache in his lower abdomen, Draco turned around back under the water as he came, breathing deeply through his mouth, letting some of the cascading water in. He watched his come and the soap mingle together on the floor of the shower, before being swept quickly away down the drain. Draco gave himself a moment to collect himself, feel the hot water on his skin and against his oversensitized body.
“Nymphadora, but I go by Tonks. Got tired of purple in the middle of last year. Anyway... what did you want to order?” She seemed pleased that Draco recognized her and he was pretty flattered in return that she remembered him to this degree. He smiled and placed an order of a medium-sized regular coffee and a BLT sandwich with a pickle and chips on the side. After ringing up his order, Tonks took a purple pen out from her apron pocket and wrote her number on his receipt, telling him to “text me, if you want, we could get coffee - maybe not here though - and catch up sometime,” before turning to Harry and asking what he wanted to order.
Before she pulled up any of the projects she was working on, Hermione said, “Hey, so Harry invited Draco over to your house over break. I’m sure you wouldn’t mind that, but we both kind of realized that maybe it was a bit much, especially since he’s a mostly new friend…”
“Well it’s a small school. I’m Hermione by the way and I use she/her pronouns, what are yours?” Hermione said, raising her hand so that Draco could shake it, “Why don’t you sit with come sit with us?”
“What if someone takes our stuff, though?” Draco asked as they waded through the sea of tables until Harry found an open booth that he liked.
His new roommate hadn’t arrived and no one had texted to say hi yet so Ron slipped into his room and flopped onto the neatly made bed complete with extra pillows and a handmade blanket. He messed around on his phone while he waited for something to happen, whittling away an hours staring at an overly bright screen and giving himself a headache that he definitely did not deserve. Hungry and waiting to hear from Harry or Hermione or Krum, Ron riffled through his newly stocked mini-fridge to see what treats his mom had left him. He laughed out loud when he found a box of trix yogurts, and made a mental note to send his mom a nice text to thank her. He opened it and emptied the yogurt cups into the fridge, stacked them neatly, and then took one with him to the bed. He licked at the cup without bothering to find a spoon, happy to get a little messy with the sugar-filled treat.
“Yes.” He replied, hoping there wasn’t anything else he was supposed to have said to the desk operator earlier.
Ron checked his phone after depositing the two boxes he was carrying onto the floor near Draco’s unmade bed. The long string of messages filled him up with right-ness and warmth. He smiled as he read them, sitting on the couch in the common area of the dorm.
Krum let his own hands pull Ron’s body closer as they kissed, rubbing up and down his back until his fingers caught on the hem of his shirt, causing it to ride up. His hands slipped under it and began to pull it up. Ron leaned back, separating their mouths, which were now a little redder and a little more swollen then they had been, so that he could take the shirt off himself. But before Krum could reel Ron back in and trace the lines of his body, over the bumps of his spine and seams of his binder and the small moles that littered his back, Ron placed a stalling finger on his lips.
The two friends lapsed into a calm silence; Harry reached for his phone laying facedown on the table to text Draco to see when he had time to talk. As they exchanged messages, Harry considered how dark Draco’s lovebites would look as they matured. He thought about how delicate they would make his neck, how inviting. He thought of what it might be like to add to the collection, to pepper his skin with more bruises, what kind of sounds Draco might make, the way he might flush at the attention. Hermione setting her coffee cup back on the table after taking a sip jolted him out of these thoughts, but they still lingered and danced at the back of his mind. He reached for his own mug and took a small sip of it.
As the movie was coming to an end, Krum pressed a tiny kiss to the side of Ron’s head and whispered, “no, he’s a pirate” along with Elizabeth Swan, causing him to flush a little and glanced around. Ron then grinned and kissed Krum fully on the lips and brought a hand up to rest on his chest. They returned their focus to the screen after tonguing at each others mouths quietly to see that Harry had the remote back in his hands and was preparing the next movie.
“It’s nice and actually pretty similar to Ron and Draco’s set up, except that it’s only one single room instead of two. The freshmen on the floor seem nice enough I guess, maybe a bit bookish -  but I’m used to that.” Harry sent her a knowing smile. “And their mostly cute and terrified!”

Draco reread the letter three times, worrying the edges of the paper with his fingertips. His heart clenched and thumped loudly in his chest at this new information. It was something to think about that he had not even considered. He wondered if going back to school might help cure this apathetic attitude and listlessness that hindered his human experience this past summer.
[from Pansy Parkinson 12:50] definitely. Let’s try on friday after the first week of school’s over? You can tell me everything and ill catch you up on the ~drama~ which of course has already started Daphne had an interesting summer.
“I don’t know if simple is the right word of all of this,” Blaise poked at Cedric with the tip of his index finger, “this is a shit-ton of food, man.”
“Ok, well, yes, Blaise and I, um, hooked up a little bit” Draco could feel himself blush at this, he hadn’t actually acknowledged it out loud before. He offered Ron a smile before looking away again, but he knew that Ron smiled back. “It was really nice and fun. I guess I was wondering if it was weird that Blaise and I did that? And if it was like a
“Yeah. No strings,” Blaise said, though Draco wished he maybe framed it another way. People in movies said ‘no strings’ but there were already so many strings. It was like Blaise could see Draco’s skepticism forming, when he continued, “I mean it though, I like kissing my friends, and I don’t expect anything else from them, other than, obviously, friendship. But I completely understand if that’s not how you do friendships. I asked because I wanted to know, yes or no and either way, I want to be your friend. I won’t think any differently about you or what our relationship is.”
Having been given the all-clear, Ron had practically flung himself into Krum’s lap, much to his boyfriend’s amusement. They ended up sharing a packet of gummy worms while chatting quietly to Cedric, who had thrown his pen down and cracked his knuckles in front of him dramatically, releasing some of the tension in his tendons. He nodded at something Krum said and Ron grinned widely. Luna had chosen to continue her studies instead of taking a break, and Dean had started laying out his own study materials in the small table space left. Seamus, instead, had dropped his bag on the ground and bounded over to Blaise to talk enthusiastically at him about a new bar someone had told him about. They agreed to check it out over the weekend.
“Cedric said he’s finally completely unpacked and starving, so he’s on his way here,” he looked over at Draco and informed him that Cedric was his roommate and a soccer player. They had mostly finished eating and were on seconds of drinks by the time Cedric ordered and sat down with them, squeezing between Krum and Harry. Draco introduced himself and Cedric politely did so as well before turning his attention down his own meal, eating it a pace that made it seem like he was trying to catch up to everyone else. Hermione and Harry had gotten back into arguing over books again sometime during all of this and Draco elected to simply sip his coffee and listen.
Ron let her trail off and then replied, “Oh, I wish he had asked me first? But I guess I wouldn’t have minded…?” He looks at her a bit helplessly, before fishing out a piece of cantaloupe from his fruit cup.
The other documents in this letter are for you to fill out if you decide to return in a few weeks for the Fall semester. Please mail them back as soon as possible or fax them to our admissions office.
Ron called over to Draco who had begun to unpack his stuff, “I have a few friends coming over to say. I hope that’s ok.”
Ron laughed and added, “we’ve tried to train him better, but you know… old dogs, new tricks, not a great match.” Harry scowled at his two friend, and swallowed loudly.
Ron grinned, “I will!” and then stepped into his room. He chose not to close the door fully so that if Draco wanted to come in, he could feel welcome to. Ron toed off his shoes before climbing into bed, disrupting the mess of blankets and pillows, left untidied in the morning. He set the backpack against the wall and pulled out his laptop and headphones, so he could watch things without distracting Draco. It really was an amusing show and he laughed out loud a few times over the next two hours, pausing only to grab a snack and something to drink.
Blaise stood up as well and winked at him, “Anytime.” He leaned over and placed a soft kiss on the corner of Draco’s mouth before sauntering over to the door and holding it open for him.
“Um, hello?” Draco ventured, taking a half step forward, “I have an appointment with Ms. McGonagall in about ten minutes. Am I in the right place?” The man behind the desk quickly looked up and focused his startling green eyes on Draco. He pushed the glasses back to the top of his nose, Draco’s eyes followed the movement.
“Mr. Dobby!” Draco called over his shoulder, to the general area where he assumed he would be. “Do you mind coming here for a moment, I have a question!” Mr. Dobby came a few moments later, looking a bit out of breath and actually surprised to be acknowledged.
“I understand.” Blaise assured him. He then leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco’s slowly, giving him the chance to pull back. Draco met his kiss with tentative eagerness. It really had been quite some time since he had kissed anyone, and did not want to do it wrong.
“Mr. Malfoy,” he said, in a quiet but strong voice, “Mr. Malfoy, you need to wake up. You have an important meeting in an hour and a half.” Mr. Dobby poked Draco gently on the shoulder as he talked, “Mr. Malfoy, you were supposed to be awake twenty minutes ago… Mr. Mafoy, Mr. Malfoy,” and finally Draco began to stir, shifting the laptop along with his body. He murmured indistinguishably as he did so and Mr. Dobby smiled softly and allowed him a moment before continuing to wake Draco up.
Pansy raised her eyebrows at him “No, I don’t know. I’ll answer that after you’ve told me how things have actually been for you. Last time we really talked, you were so bored and depressed you actually wanted to hear the Daphne/Millicent drama. I want to know what’s finally gotten you out of your
Draco nodded again and then spoke up, “Yeah, yes. Um, but just kissing, if you don’t mind. I always like doing that, but I don’t think I’m ready to do anything else, you know.” he wasn’t sure he was comfortable sharing his body with anyone, let alone a platonic hook-up, but kissing was fun and easy. He figured he actually might enjoy doing a bit more than kissing, he had a faint interest in the idea of jerking Blasie off, by hand or by mouth, just to see how pretty and soft he would look post-orgasm, but he didn’t feel ready to express that, especially if he wasn’t interested in letting Blaise reciprocate. The imbalance seemed a bit too strange to negotiate at such a new and explorative experience, and he didn’t feel the need to bare all his insecurities just yet.
Draco closed his computer and resolved to charge it when he found the energy to fully wake up. He pulled it more securely onto the bed and lay back down, staring at the white ceiling above him. Draco wasn’t really sure what to do for the next few days, if he was honest with himself. He figured he could watch movies and lay around in bed all day, but that would be boring. None of the people he met the day before had invited him to anything and he didn’t want to text them first, not fearing the rejection, but more the possibility that he wouldn’t get an answer at all. He lazily drifted in and out of awakeness for about an hour, letting his mind wander and his body relax.
It was late when the last movie, X-Men, ended and Cedric stood up and stretched. Draco watched as his shirt rode up on his stomach, exposing the lower portion of his abdomen and the light dusting of his happy trail. Cedric smiled at him when he caught him looking before asking Krum if he wanted to call it a night and walk back their dorm with him. Blaise stood up as well, tossing a small now-empty container of ice-cream into the trash bag the group had slowly been filling the past bunch of hours.
“Regardless,” Draco bumped his shoulder with Blaise’s, “Hermione isn’t the kind of person to let something like that break up a friendship, especially not the one she has with you.”
Draco, having taken the carton and was spooning the last of the ice cream into his mouth, just inclined his head to show that he heard and gave himself a moment to swallow before telling Ron that he understood and would try as well, “it shouldn’t be that hard, right?”
“No, thanks to you, I think I might actually understand that mess now,” Draco said as he pushed up from the ground and stood up, stretching his body. “Thank you, for the help and the, um, you know.”
The two of them smiled at eat other, Ron pushed the almost empty ice cream carton towards Draco, saying “You should finish it. Also, side note, I’ve been trying to persuade people to stop using the word guys when they’re talking about a group of people who might not be men. Because gendered language and all that, I read an article about it over the summer. I’ve been slacking a bit on it recently, but I think it’s important.”
Draco inclined his head in acknowledgement and popped a berry into his mouth. He hummed to himself as he chewed, formulating  his thoughts on the matter at hand. “Can you make two columns, a Pro one and a Con one?”
“How’s your day been so far?” Harry asked Draco as they walked toward the Great Hall having decided to go eat lunch. Oliver bid them a hurried goodbye, explaining he had a class in ten minutes. Draco felt a bit sorry for him, but his schedule tomorrow was similarly hectic, with his english class and other history class with only fifteen minutes separating them. He was glad today he only had two classes and that they were both in the morning.
“Oh, we could all go back with you!” Harry said, “I mean if Ron sets up his TV, then we could watch something and make popcorn and Blasie can come over,” Harry offered Draco and Ron’s space to the group without asking how they felt about it, but it didn’t seem like either of them minded. Draco even looked a bit hopeful if Hermione was to be honest.
“Yeah, I mean I guess people don’t usually get to keep their best friends when they go away to college. We actually didn’t plan it out - well in a way I guess you could say we did but, it kind of just happened, you know. Do you know anyone here?”
The new friends he had made had been pretty supportive and, to varying degrees, were experiencing similar levels of stress. Harry had approached him a few days ago after class with Remus about doing a big group study session a few times to prepare for and also during midterms:
Harry bumped his shoulder again and moved up the bed so that he was lying down, Ron flopped down beside him and then turned his body so his face against Harry’s side, one of his arms slid across Harry’s abdomen. Harry brought a hand up to tangle in Ron’s hair and started playing with it absently. He felt them both relax as they settled on top of the blankets. “So what are you trying to do then?” Ron answered him, but the words were muffled, Harry smiled up at the ceiling and tugged lightly at the soft strands of hair between his fingers, “come on, you can tell me.”
“Yeah, I started an essay outline for two of my classes, so I’m feeling pretty good. I don’t usually get that worried about this kind of stuff, but it’s nice to do it with everyone here…” Harry trailed off, and Draco nodded.
He let out a breath and tried to figure out how to articulate his feelings, “I know, I’m sorry Pans, we really should have talked during the summer.”
To say that Hermione Granger was intrigued by Ron’s new roommate would be an understatement. His last name rang a distant bell in her mind but she couldn’t place it. Draco was quiet and underconfident. She remembered feeling like that when she first started being friends with Harry and Ron all those years ago. It was rather overwhelming to go from knowing no one to having two best friends who were kind and brave and actually interested in her. So the looks of confusion and happiness that flashed across Draco’s face weren’t a surprise at all, though it was strange to see the emotions that she was so familiar with mirrored by someone else. Hermione kept a half-eye on Draco as she discussed the books she read over the summer, hopeful that he would realize he could fit in just as much as she did soon enough. Not that she knew him very well yet, but he seemed like a good person, if a bit nervous and withdrawn.
“Both, I guess, but mostly the first. I’m really not sure what I want to do in my life, I can’t really imagine what it will be like in a year or five - though I guess going to school for the next three years or so might help with that - which is part of the reason I decided to go back. I just couldn’t sit in the Manor any longer and do nothing. I didn’t want to go back to doing meaningless work and I was just so
They chatted a small while about which songs they hoped Quidditch International were working on, before Hermione turned to her tablet and they both lapsed into quiet. Ron finished his lunch and bent down to grab his computer from his backpack. They typed away on their respective devices, every once in a while pausing to mention something that came to their minds and share a laugh. It was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon
as him, and he wished that so deeply as well. He knew that showed on his face more than hers and that she would be able to see his longing for their physical closeness. “Stuff with your parents is hard, I’m not really sure how I would handle it if I was in your situation. But I think going back to school is a good thing for you, if only to assuage the
“No, I don’t have much in it yet. I was hoping to head over to Diagon Alley at some point in the next few days before school starts to get a few things, but I brought some things from home.” Draco thought about this small stash of food in his room, most of it came at the suggestions that Mr. Dobby made for him when they talked about the details of him moving out of the mansion. He had essentially put together a kit for Draco, full of all the necessary dorm-things that he would need, stuff he hadn’t even realized he needed until they were suggested. Draco had a sudden feeling of being out of place - taking a year and a half to not do school wasn’t that much time, but it seemed to be a long enough time for Draco to forget that he would require things like sponges and an umbrella.
“I’m almost done,” the blond boy said over his shoulder as he arranged his shoes at the bottom of this closet.
“I couldn’t find my second lawn chair - though I probably wouldn’t have been able to carry it along with everything else, to be honest.”
“So,” Ron said slowly, looking at the spoon in his hand like it might hold the answer to what he was worried about. Draco tried not to let the word make him anxious, as it sat in the air heavily. But Ron looked up and met Draco’s eyes. He smiled lightly, a bit tightly, but Draco was comforted by it all the same. “I had some difficulty with my roommate last year and I want you to know. I know that we don’t actually live in the same room, but it’s probably still important.” Ron said, and then added, “Actually, maybe we should talk about past roommates! That way we can make sure things that were hard before are a bit easier.”
“We literally have been flirting for at least a month - or at least I used to think we were,” Blaise said, “but I mean, you’re half right, I am bi, so there is a small part of me that is straight, I guess, if you want to think about it that way. I’m actually crushing on a girl right now, so...”
“It’s harder for me than I thought it would be, but I’m just one person,” Ron shrugged and then yawned. Draco yawned in response, raising his hand to cover his mouth. “By the way, thanks for being cool about Krum staying over last night.”
“I didn’t realize you it wasn’t mutual,” Blaise reassured kindly, shaking his head, seemingly at his own assumptions. “I didn’t mean to be presumptuous, just forward, and open” and at that, he grinned slightly. Draco realized that Blaise was genuinely interested in him to some extent, at least to the extent that kissing was.
“Yeah, we like to, um, expand our horizons when we can. Though, I should clarify,” Ron said, turning his head slightly so their eyes met, “it’s mostly fooling and all that, not so much sex, I guess, depending on how you define sex. Not that we wouldn’t be up to it, theoretically, but we’re not really ready to bring another person in in that way, yet.”
“So.” He said after swallowing, “I never really had a chance to talk about this kinda stuff with my last roommate, so...” he trailed off, trying to collect his thoughts, “I don’t really know how it’s supposed to go. How should we start?”
Throughout the next half hour, others trickled in alone or in small groups: Harry with Ron, Luna, Blaise, and Cedric with Krum. Neville informed them that Seamus would be joining them later, but he wasn’t sure whether Dean was going to make it or not. Harry made room for himself next to Draco, with Ron on the other side of him. Only Luna was able to fit at the table they were sitting at, so Cedric pulled a table from another study room into theirs and made it bigger. Hermione protested that the other study room would need the table, but Cedric just shrugged and promised that if someone came looking for it, they could give it back. After that, everyone was quiet, the sounds of rustling papers, typing fingers, scratching pencils drifted through the space absently. Luna had headphones over her ears and bounced a little in her seat to whatever she was listening to in such a carefree way that Draco was quietly jealous of whatever she was listening to that allowed her both focus and fun.
“Well I’m supposed to enroll in classes from this coming semester. Most of the classes are already full and I know that I should have started trying to do this months ago, but I didn’t decide to come back to school until about a week ago, so I didn’t really have a lot of options.” Draco said all of this in a rush, and his face flushed a deeper red. Harry nodded along with his words and gave him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder.
“I love you too,” Ron said and smiled. They sat quietly, listening to the sound of their own breathing, holding each other. The mood in the air shifted gradually until Ron instructed Krum to take off his shirt. He brought his hands up to Krum’s neck again, his left thumb pressed lightly on his Adam’s apple. Then his hands slipped down to slide down his chest, his fingers feeling the lines of his muscles and pressing into them a bit. “You know,” Ron interjected as his right hand moved towards Krum’s left nipple. His index finger traced circles around the hardening flesh, “the nice thing about this new roommate arrangement…” Ron’s left hand moved to trace the skin right above the top of Krum’s pants. Krum kissed the next words out of Ron’s mouth, before he could say the things they were both thinking, but it didn’t last long. They were both impatient with want, having been teasing each other for the better part of the afternoon. They separated so they could remove the rest of their clothing without bumping into each other. After he was completely naked, Krum sat on the side of the bed and reached into the top drawer of the bedside table, hoping to find condoms, lube, and Ron’s vibrator, and was rewarded by finding exactly what he wanted, and something else.
“Oh, okay, yeah that would be really nice. Are you sure though? I mean you just met me, right?” Harry seemed a little taken aback by Draco’s response, as if he hadn’t realized that he didn’t know him very well, which confused Draco mostly because Harry had just spent the last few minutes explaining his friends to him.
“At least five times probably,” Hermione conceded and hid her red face behind her hands in mock defeat as Draco laughed again.
” Harry’s voice was loud, speaking above what sounded like the general clamour of mass student exodus from a large room.
“I’m interested in history, not sure what concentration though. I haven’t declared anything yet, though, uh, I think I just want to give it time, you know.”
“Cool, I’ll walk back to the car and drive over to your dorm. Want me to grab you anything on the way? I’m at, uh, Madam Puddifoot’s.”
“To be sure,” Krum agreed as he pulled some Hershey bars, a container of small chocolate chip cookies, and a box of brownies out of one of the bags. “Oh, and we got some butterbeer, too. We thought about getting actual beer, but we didn’t know what brands people would like, so we figured, we’d just go simple.”
“What? Why does that matter? Also isn't the point that most men wore white wigs at that time anyway, I don't think it has anything to do with his age...” Hermione asked.
“I’m actually not sure,” Draco responded thoughtfully, “It’s all very interesting, and the idea of studying would be nice, but I think I’m more interested in history, but I haven’t picked a concentration yet. I guess I’m hoping the history class I’m taking this semester, that Harry’s taking as well, might help me figure it out.”
“Yeah, ok,” Ron nodded, and said, “I saw that you brought a thing of toilet paper, my mom and I got a case also, so we’re pretty much set in that regard, at least for a few weeks. We also got some cleaning supplies - they’re in the cabinet under the sink.”
“So you’re the new roommate. I’m the boyfriend,” Krum introduced himself, “my first name isn’t actually Krum, if you were wondering, it’s Victor, but nobody calls me that. He/him pronouns, by the way.”
“I’m just so happy to see you,” Hermione said animatedly, retracting her arm from his body and using her hands to articulate her works as she talked. “We saw Krum on the way to Hufflepuff Hall when we were leaving Gryffindor, he said he was going to stop by later. I heard he as rooming with Cedric again from Parvati, that’s so nice!” Parvati was Hermione’s roommate. They had been suitemates the year before, living separately, Hermione with Lavender and Parvati with Eloise Midgen (who none of them knew very well, even after eight months of sharing the same space), but Lavander had made plans to room off campus this year with her boyfriend (who none of them had met yet), so Hermione and Parvati paired up on their own. Ron nodded in agreement to Hermione and opened the door to his shared dorm.
“I can go with you tomorrow if you want,” Ron proposed, bringing Draco out of his thoughts, “Mom left me with a lot of food, but it’d be nice to check it out anyway. Maybe Hermione can join us, she mentioned wanted to get groceries the other day I think…”
“Do you mind sticking in a dumpster on your way out? I’m sure there’s one nearby,” He asked, feeling a bit awkward, but not sure how else to ask Harry to do something for him. He needn’t have worried, though as Harry just smiled at him and said, “yeah, sure.”
“It would be nice to have an extra set of hands,” the older one added after introducing himself as Mr. Dobby.
“Hey, Draco,” Blaise said, happily, spearing a tomato with his fork and popping it into his mouth, looking at Draco as he bit into it.
A thicker letter caught his attention as he made his way through the small mountain of envelopes. It was from the Hogwarts University, better known as the HU, where Draco had taken a leave of absence for an undefined amount of time from once he no longer had a living family and found himself unable to focus on his studies. Draco gingerly picked up the letter and spun it around in his hands before letting out a huff of air and tearing it open. Inside was a series of documents that he slowly unfurled on the table before him.
“So it seems like Draco and Blaise got it on yesterday,” Hermione said, glancing at Harry over a cup of coffee. She and Harry were at Madame Puddiffoot’s in the late morning the day after the first group study session they had prepared. Before she mentioned this, they briefly discussed the event in general and congratulated themselves on a study session well executed.
“A few,” Draco answered, standing up from where he was kneeling with his clothes to sort out the mess that he left on his desk, “I mean I’ve only completed one semester here so far. I did a math class and a science class to start to get some of those gen-eds out of the way. I’m still taking one of each this semester to finish them up.”
“Yeah, I’m not sure I can ask people stuff like that, at least not yet. Thank you for talking to me about it.”
“That would be nice,” Draco answered, and wished to add something else, not wanting their conversation to stall, but his mind drew a blank. Ron looked like he was mulling something over, the space between his eyebrows up in concentration. Draco figured that he didn’t need to worry about the conversation being over as it was clear that Ron had more in mind to talk about. Draco couldn’t imagine what, but he waited patiently and rewarded himself with another mouthful of the now meltier than solid ice-cream.
They (happily) glared at each other and Draco excused himself to add milk and sugar to his coffee from a small counter on the other side of the building. By the time he made it back, Ron and Krum had just sat down, Ron noticing the looks of indignation on his two best friends faces.
Blaise folded up his unused folding chair, slipped it into its bag, and pulled the strap over his head. He and Hermione watch grabbed one of the bean bags and wished everyone a goodnight before stepping out of the dorm. Harry waited with Cedric as Krum walked quickly into Ron’s room to grab his clothes from the day before and the hat Ron’s mom made for him. Draco tied off the trash bag after making sure that all the debris from their marathon was gone and handed it to Harry.
The hours whittled quietly away, punctuated as well by a few knocks on the doors from Harry’s freshman. Ron stayed on the bed when Harry went to help him and every once in awhile he and Krum would exchange texts. It was hard for Krum to be consistent because today was one of his band practice afternoons, but Ron didn’t mind at all as he pleasantly drifted through the afternoon. Harry was glad for it, it had been a busy week and it was nice to get some time with his best friend.
Hermione nodded along to Harry words. “Dean said something to me the other day about Seamus feeling the weight of the upcoming exams. Neville also - I was talking to him and Luna yesterday and we thought maybe getting a study group together to meet every day might be helpful. Having a bunch of people who all need to do work could be motivating.” Harry considered her words as she continued, “We’ve kind of been doing that the past few semesters, but maybe making it official in some way could create a productive atmosphere.”
Draco blushed, “it was.” He had almost wished he had not stopped what they were doing, but he was feeling like he might have let it get carried away, which he didn’t think he was ready for. There continued a pleasant buzzing feeling in his body, and he was so proud of himself for letting something so unexpected and nice to happen.
Draco tilted his head so he could see the side of Ron’s face, “Oh, that’s interesting,” they both grinned.
Two nights later, on the eve of Draco’s meeting with Ms. McGonagall, he lay in bed, unable to drift off into any sort of slumber, even an unsatisfying one. He was keyed up and anxious, knowing that this meeting was the beginning of a new chapter in his foreseeable future. He ordered Japanese food earlier that night because he had thought it a calming and relaxing meal but now, hours later, he was rethinking his complete ability to make decisions, from food choices to life ones. Finally, after sighing a few too many times at his now dark ceiling, Draco reached over to his bedside table and pulled his laptop onto the bed. He sat up with it and browsed through random tabs and internet pages, unsure of what he wanted to do, just knowing that he wanted to do something until he realized that perhaps he wanted to watch a movie, a feel-good one at that. So Draco found a good, albeit illegal, online version of Josie and the Pussycats and settled into his pillows. It made him feel a bit reckless if he was going to be honest with himself and it was nice to watch something in the comfort of his bed and not alone in a mini-movie theater.
“Yeah. Harry - the guy behind the desk - helped me out. I picked out five classes, but I might end up just taking four.”
Hermione stopped walking and turned towards him, looking for something in his face, which she apparently found. She reached forward and gave him a quick hug before grabbing his hand and pulling him towards her dormitory. “Sounds good,” she said over her shoulder at him, “it’s been too long since we gotten high.” Harry laughed at that and allowed her to drag him along, glad for their comradery and the easy ways that she accepted and loved him.
Draco left his room open wide open as he began to finish unpacking. Ron and Harry were fiddling with the TV Ron had, trying to set it up in the common area. Hermione realized they probably didn’t have enough seating for everyone, so she called Blaise to tell him to bring chairs or something so that there would be more options. The two of them had talked over the summer quite a lot and it was nice to hear his voice again now that she was back in school. Seeing him yesterday with Luna had been wonderful. Hermione then called Luna, not wanting to leave her out of this gathering if she wanted to come, but turned out she was going to a book fair with a few of her friends from the previous semester.
She grinned at him when she noticed him looking and said, “I know someone else who’s taking an astronomy class. Maybe you’ll be in the same one.”
Tapping at his phone once securely in bed, damp-haired and warm, Draco brought up his text messages and clicked on Pansy’s name. He scrolled through some of their more recent texts which were of him informing her he was going back to school. He smiled at the ‘!!!!’ that she had sent him and the multitude of questions she shot back.
“Uh, yeah. You’re in the right place. Why don’t you take a seat over there,” he pointed towards a waiting area, “And I’ll go tell her you’re here. What’s your name?”
At first, he wasn’t sure what he could do to help, but he wanted to show Draco how important their friendship was to him and also that he could provide emotional support for the duration of Midterms, as well as all the rest of them (and Finals) to come. After a particularly short study session with Draco in the library, in which Draco expressed his nerves for an upcoming paper he had due for an American history class with a professor Harry had never had before, Harry made a decision - to go to Hermione for advice. She was usually good at coming up with ideas and had a lot of tools for being a supportive, sympathetic, and empathetic friend and Harry trusted her with basically anything.
Harry finally brought up her comment about flirting again and asked, “what did you mean? Who does Draco flirt with?” hoping she would expand a bit on her point. He knew that he tended to have a habit of flirting with a lot of people without even meaning to, but hadn’t really noticed Draco doing the same. If he had missed something like that about his new friend, he wanted to know.
A few minutes later, a sinister looking woman emerged from the hallway that was previously used by the front desk man. She looked over at the waiting area and her eyes landed on Draco. “Draco Malfoy?” She asked.
“Good,” Mr. Dobby said, nodding again, reminding Draco of a bobble-head,  “I’ll go get something to write down your ideas. Why don’t you take some time to eat breakfast? It might help you think more clearly.” The two men then began moving around the room, Mr. Dobby in search of writing utensils and Draco to fill a plate with food. Along the wall on the left side of the room was a mini buffet table that was mostly empty aside from some bowls of fruit, a bread basket, a toaster, butter, raspberry jam, and a coffee machine with all the necessary ingredients. Draco took a moment to cut himself a few slices of nectarine to add to the collection of raspberry and blackberries he already put on a plate. He prepared a cup of coffee as two slices of bread got crispy and warm in the toaster. By the time he returned to his seat and spread butter and jam on his toast, Mr. Dobby was already sitting in the seat to the right of Draco’s, a pen and a yellow legal pad directly in front of him. “Why don’t you eat and talk while I take notes and then you can make a decision based on that later.”
“What?....oh. ok. Thanks Mr. Dobby. I’m awake now,” Draco mumbling, moving into a more comfortable sitting-up position. The butler left the room quietly, trusting Draco to be able to rouse himself and do the things he needed to prepare for his meeting.
“It’s ok, I do that too, or at least I try to,” he assured her, paused for a moment and said pointedly, “but with better books.” She rolled her eyes and swatted him playfully on the shoulder.
“Well it’s not much of a break, though, is it, only five days?” Draco hedged, as he was not sure what he wanted to do yet. He wished that Harry hadn’t asked, but tries to go along with it and not be too disappointed by this particular segue.
Ms. McGonagall had called a few days after their meeting. She informed him that moving in day for returning students was September first and of the rooming arrangements she had been able to arrange for him. He would get a pseudo-single in Prefect Hall (where mostly upperclassmen lived), meaning he would have his own room but one that was attached to another person’s room with a bathroom to share. He would have his own sleeping space but not his own living space, which was disappointing but decidedly acceptable. He hadn’t expected to get any kind of single and he tried to count himself as lucky. Ms. McGonagall assured him that it was a good option and that the person he was paired with would most likely be someone he could get along with. She also told him that she was sending an email with everything she had just shared and more logistical information for the moving in day, but he could call again if he had any questions.
it's been such a long time since I've updated, but I'm really excited to feel like i can move forward with this fic again!! (sorry for any mistakes - ill probably review it again at some point in the next few months to catch anything i missed)
The woman who took their orders looked familiar to Draco with her bubblegum-pink hair and thrice pierced nose but he couldn’t figure out how. In the end, it was she who recognized him when he stepped up to place his order.
She shook her head, “I think it’s ok, and he seems a bit lonely and unsure of himself sometimes, so I’m sure you inviting him was the right thing to do. Just maybe a bit early, since he’s so new to this group,” she played absently with a spoon in front of her, “and really the only people who ever join us at family things are significant others which isn’t very often anyway… But I don’t think you did the wrong thing! Maybe we can meet him halfway and not subject him to Ron’s avalanche of siblings, and all of our parents, like going to a show or something.”
thing? How things like this fit into this friend group and all that, I don’t know. Does that make sense? ”
“Thanks,” Draco said, but Blaise shook his head at him, and pointed at himself as if to so ‘I’m better than she is, talk to me instead’ but also in a way that was a lot more suggestive of other things. Draco smiled in acknowledgement and glanced over to Luna who was daintily demolishing a very random assortment of food - chicken, sliced nectarine, and two slices of bright orange American Cheese to name a few.
Hogwarts University is a small institution and we care very much about our students. We are informing you of this not to put pressure on you but to inform you of your position so that you can make informed decisions about the next few years of your life.
“Yeah, well I can still think they’re adorable. I’m a year older and much wiser.” He nodded sagely, lifting his eyebrows in an attempt to make a smart-person-face.
Remu’s eyes seemed to brighten as he talked, “I belong to the history department, but I also teach some classes that overlap with American, gender, and Jewish studies depending on the semester and general interest.” He paused to pick yp his mug, and then asked, “what brings you to this university? Are you a prospective student?”
“What?” Harry’s hands paused in their tangle of Ron’s short hair, “Don’t you two already fuck? Haven’t you been having sex for a while now?” He looked down at the top of Ron’s head with incredulity.
“Tell her I say ‘Hi!’” Harry said, which Draco delighted in Harry’s casual extension of friendship. He supposed he had mentioned Pansy quite often to his new group of friends, so much so that he didn’t need to clarify who she was anymore. He knew she enjoyed her tiny pocket of recognition. “I’m so lucky my study group came with me to Uni, otherwise I don’t know what I’d do.” Harry shook his head at the thought. “But yeah, I think it’ll be fun and everything, Hermione has
Harry stabbed a piece of broccoli with his fork, looking down at it for a moment before sharing his thoughts with his friend, “I think that’s a really good idea. We can have snacks and do silly themed fifteen-minute breaks on a schedule. And when Midterms are over we could have a party!” He chomped down on the broccoli in excitement and chewed it while Hermione smiled at him before settling more comfortably down in her seat to eat her own meal.
“You eat like this too, you idiot, you just restrain yourself when your boyfriend is around,” He bit back, smirking at his friend, “‘specially when we order in Chinese food.”
“You two are ridiculous,” Krum said before reaching over to Ron and kissing him lightly on the cheek. “They’re always like this, Draco.”
“See - her father, whatever his name is - they mark the passage of time with his hair. It’s ridiculous, they don’t even try to make him look older, they just make his wig grey!”
“I think it was a spur of the moment kind of ask, he didn’t seem to have really thought about the implications of that, especially to our parents,” Hermione reassured. “I mean he knows the two of them aren’t in a relationship or anything beyond friendship - though I think we know he might want to be. He just didn’t want Draco to be alone over break.” Ron nodded in understanding. “We thought maybe we could try to meet Draco another way, like to see Quidditch International play a set, you know?”
“Hey! You here?” She said into the phone as she walked back into the common area where Ron and Harry had successfully installed the TV and were now trying to get it connected to Ron's computer.
“No,” Harry laughed, “Sorry you had to carry all of your stuff over. How’d you manage it anyway? Those bean-bags chairs are huge.”
“Hey,” Draco called out as Ron walked through the door to their apartment. He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on the coffee table on which sat a steaming mug of what looked to be tea, with a computer in his lap.
They leaned away from each other a bit, to give each other some space to allow their breath to come more evenly. Blaise let go of his hand slowly.
“Well I’ve actually not done it much before. I didn’t really discuss my sexuality with my parents before they died. Pansy was easy, but that’s because she knew I wasn’t straight almost immediately but she let me take my time I guess. This is rather pleasant.”
“Actually I’m seeing him in about two hours, so I can catch him up, but you should talk to Draco as soon as possible, and maybe apologize.”
“I should have done that. Instead, I just took classes that looked interesting, both semesters last year.”
“Hey, so, I was hoping maybe you could help me,” Harry began, before wiping his mouth with a napkin and taking a sip of water. “Draco’s been really stressed out about Midterms coming up and I want to try to help him, but I’m not sure how. I thought you might be able to think something up with me.”
Blaise’s face fell a bit, but did not stop being friendly or inviting, “Oh, I’m sorry. I feel like we’ve been flirting for a while and you might want to. It’s okay if not - that’s why I asked. I misinterpreted, I’m sorry.”
“That’s so exciting, I hope we get to say hello before you head off.” Hermione began nibbling at her own meal.
“Oh right, I remember you saying that when we were talking about classes,” Harry exclaimed, “we’re gonna take the same history of sexuality class this semester!”
Hermione brightened at the question, she loved to talk about her studies. “I’m a social work major. I thought about doing psychology for a while, but I took psych-101 and an intro to social work class and I realized that was more my steam.”
“So far so good,” he answered, “I had Stat earlier today, which was fine. I mean, it’s syllabus week so she - Vector - just went over the quizzes and exam dates and stuff.” He wanted to say something about Luna but was unsure how to approach the subject, not wanting to seem really weirded out by someone who Harry was friends with, but figured it would be stranger if he didn’t say anything at all. “It was kind of weird, though, Luna was in my class. She said she wasn’t actually enrolled in the class, she was just sitting in. It was nice to see her, but it seems strange to audit a class so early in the semester…”
They walk back to the road table where everyone else was getting out of their seats and preparing to leave. Ron said to Draco as they made their way out, “I’m sure you’ll fit right in,” and beamed up at him, in such a hopeful and happy way that Draco grinned back too.
Harry laughed out loud at that, “I mean I have dated girls before but I’ve never… yeah, weird, I know, but I guess it’s the same kind of thing in a way, right? Like both of us are in a time of our lives where these things that are like socially expected of us to have done, but it’s okay that we haven’t yet.”
“No that’s ok, I wanted to wait for you guys - I mean folks - anyway and besides, it’s not like it matters if it gets cold or anything,” she said. It turned out that they didn’t have to wait very long for their food and a few minutes later, they all began to eat. Draco hungrily bit into his sandwich, glad to be filling his body with its first meal of the day. From the corner of his eye, Draco noticed that Harry was making short work of his own food, scarfing it down as if it were the last meal he would ever eat, and wondered to himself if maybe the behavior was exacerbated not just by being friends with another messy eater, but something else as well. He personally took a painfully long time to eat even a small amount of food when he was in public, just like his parents taught him to be: polite, neat, and never a completely empty plate. He never much minded, but he quietly speculated over his BLT about what his eating habits would have been like had he been raised in a different environment, without the pressure of being the sole heir of a well-respected family.
Krum kissed Ron’s belly button and looked up at him, “oh, yeah, we are definitely keeping this on the table.” He shifted back, though, to place the strap-on into the drawer and take out a condom and the lube. Krum placed the items in reaching distance on the bed and then delicately climbed on top of Ron, not wanting to squish him. He leaned down to claim his mouth in another kiss, but he didn’t stay there long. He kissed his way down Ron’s body, mapping his progress pressing little licks and bites into his skin wherever he could reach. Ron hadn’t taken off his binder, so Krum knew to leave that area alone this time. He hoped that Ron would be ok with taking it off later though when they went to sleep - Ron had been wearing it at least all afternoon and it would probably not be good for him to wear it for much longer. He nipped at Ron’s navel and the redhead let out a small sound. Ron moved his hand from where it had been resting on the bed towards Krum’s head and Krum turned so he could kiss it lightly before returning to Ron’s abdomen.
Draco blushed in embarrassment, he hadn’t meant to disturb Harry, but nodded despite himself. Harry grinned over at him before making his way over to the couch and plopping down.
Two people named Blaise and Luna joined their table quickly, Luna sitting between Draco and Krum, Blaise between Hermione and Ron. There weren’t any more empty chairs and everyone sat evenly spaces, with the exception of Ron and Krum who never seemed to be able to extract themselves from each other. Draco noticed they even were sharing the same three plates and reached over each other to get to them.
Fifteen minutes later, Luna rose from her chair and left the room, not fully closing the door so she could get back in without requiring anyone to open it for her - she returned after some time with a cup of coffee and a blueberry scone. Seamus and Cedric were quietly quizzing Dean on a study guide that he had filled out previously. Draco considered asking someone near him to quiz him on his newly made flashcards from before, but didn’t want to disturb anyone, especially when all the people at his table looked particularly engrossed in what they were doing. He elected instead to focus on another subject of study and promised himself that he would ask someone for their help when they weren’t too preoccupied with preparing for their own exams.
Draco left his three companions and headed over to sit by Hermione. She folded over the corner of the page she was reading and closed her book, setting it on the table by her still untouched salad. He bid her a good morning and thanked a blond waiter who brought him his coffee almost immediately. He added Tonks’ number into his contacts and noticed a text from an unknown number which he assumed was Harry’s. He added that number as well. He then looked over to Hermione, not wanting to be rude, and asked which book she was reading, Hermione blushed and admitted it was The DaVinci Code,
“No I know that, and I do want to. It just feels different. Exciting but strange,” Ron also allowed his body to turn towards Harry, bringing one shoulder off from the bed.
“Here,” Harry said as he pulled his phone out of his pocket, “I’ll text you a link.” He clicked around on the screen before realizing, “Wait! I don’t think I have your number? Here, add yourself to my contacts and I’ll forward you the link.” He handed the phone over to Draco with the ‘New Contact’ screen open for Draco to tap away at.
“Who wants to share this with me?” He asked the room and Cedric happily took him up on the offer. Harry made a disappointed sound as he looked at his card and passed it to Ron before snapping the frog in half to hand over to Cedric.
Mr. Dobby took a moment to read it before saying, “Mr. Malfoy, this isn’t a decision I can help you make, but I can help you figure out the logistics once you make one for yourself.”
“Yeah, of course,” Draco said, setting his plates down and sliding down on his side of the booth. He smiled at Harry and Blaise across from him. “Hi Blaise.”
Draco Malfoy lay on his bed half naked, his fingers trailing up and down the fine hairs on his stomach as a warm breeze drifted in his room through the windows that lined the opposite wall, dragging the loose curtains with it as it went. He sighed to himself, not for the first time, as he stared up as the plain blue-ish grey ceiling above him. He was bored. He was twenty years old, and he was bored. He knew he didn’t have to be, but there are only so many times a person can masturbate in one afternoon and he had no interest anymore in the books that lay in scattered piles on the floor around his bed. It wasn’t like he couldn’t think of anything to do, it just that he had no desire to do any of the things he had at his disposal, which was why he was bored.
[from Krumcake 2:06] Saw Hermione and Harry walking to you. Just got on campus. Gonna unpack and then come over Hope your moving in went well. <3
Ron had just pushed himself into a sitting position to throw the now empty yogurt cup into his trash bin when the main door of the living space opened to reveal a tall, skinny blonde man and an older guy in a fancy suit. Just as he was about to go and introduce himself, Ron’s cell phone dinged at him, alerting him that he had a text. He smiled at the new guy, waved a little awkwardly, and said, “Hi, I’m Ron,” before turning to grab his phone off his bed.
For the rest of the meal, the group of five exchanged stories about their weeks and the projects they were working on. Cho was doing her thesis on competition and neo-liberal capitalism within organized sports and how that affected marginalized individuals and Harry was fascinated. He asked her all about her research and methods until Luna started pulling her away for some late night bowling. Cho, smiling lovingly at her datemate, asked for a moment so she could exchange contact info with Harry and, winking, told him to text her sometime.
Later that night, when Ron and Draco were alone in the living room (Krum was in Ron’s room, getting ready for bed, having already bid Draco a goodnight), Draco tried to bring himself to ask about Fall break, but didn’t really know how to. He also wanted to talk to him about Blaise and kissing and platonic sexuality and this friend group, but that felt like a huge topic that maybe deserved time to talk, and not right before they were going to sleep. He also wasn’t sure exactly how he would want to frame it or the kinds of questions he would ask. Not that he thought Ron would react negatively, on the contrary, Ron seemed like probably the perfect person to talk to about this stuff, because of how much importance he placed on friendship, not to mention his flair for public displays of affection. But Draco found it difficult to formulate the words, let alone articulate the thoughts and questions he had. In the end, he wished Ron a pleasant evening and left his red-haired friend behind looking after him with empathy and confused amusement at his sudden departure in favor of his own room. When he emerged about twenty minutes later to brush his teeth and wash his face, the living room light was off and Draco could hear the tiny muffled sounds of two men talking in the room next to his.
“This is me,” Luna told him as they neared a tall building, “See you around, Dragon.” And before he could correct her, she walked off, her bright backpack octopus seeming to wave a goodbye to him as she disappeared through a heavy door. Draco stared after her for a beat,  bemusedly off-kilter, before deciding to head over to the Common Room to kill the time before his next class.
“Ah yes, I did want to discuss that with you. We do require that Freshmen and Sophomores live on campus in the dorms. Your situation is unique, however. I think it would be best for you to live on campus just like everyone else, but you do have the option to remain at your house instead or any other places of residence. It’s up to you.” Ms. McGonagall answered.
Most of the decorations that Ron put up were ones that Krum had seen before in the room he had last year at Gryffindor Tower, but there were a few new ones. He also had a new bedside table - not the makeshift stack of crates as a semblance of shelves that Harry made for him when they were in high school - but a real table with two wooden drawers. On the top of the bedside table, along with the framed pictures that Ron usually placed upon it, there was a new photo. It was of the two of them, sitting close, bundled in the scarves and hats, smiling at each other. Hermione had taken the photo when they weren’t looking because they were too captivated by each other to notice her or the Chudley Cannons ice hockey game they were there to watch. Krum felt a warmth spread through him, as he looked at the framed photograph. He didn’t even know that Ron had it or had taken the time to print and frame it. Looking at the other photos - one of Ron’s entire immediate family, one of Hermione, Harry, and him, and one of the Weasley family’s dogs, Hermes, who died two years ago, and Pig, who was still just a puppy - Krum realized that Ron counted him as part of his family.
It was towards the end of the current episode that Ron was watching that Draco decided to approach his room, almost cautiously. Ron noticed Draco and waved him in, motioning for him to sit on the bed with him. He put Netflix on pause and set his laptop to the side, still open.
“-used it it, yeah I know, that’s what they’ve been telling him all night.” They both laughed a bit at that. “I’m sure he’s fine with it, I mean, I don’t know, but when I asked just now it didn’t seem like he minded all that much.”
He paused, and then continued, with a serious expression on his face, “None of us expect these things of you, unless you made your interest clear. I feel a bit weird telling you other people’s ways of being intimate, but I think most people would be really open to talking to you about stuff, if you felt comfortable asking.”
Draco let himself sleep in Friday morning, having stayed up late reading the night before. He spread out on his bed when he woke up, drowsy and feeling soft, and looked up at the ceiling without really seeing it. He’d had a strange dream - not a bad one, but definitely not normal - involving a gigantic teapot, Harry’s green eyes blinking at him, and an impromptu flight amongst the stars that winked and giggled as he soared past them - and he tried to hold onto it, going over some of the details in his mind so he wouldn’t forget. He did not know what his dream was trying to tell him, but he felt sure it was more positive than anything else and wanted to commit it to memory. Eventually, he hoisted himself off his bed to grab at his backpack in order to put out a pen and his journal, rolling over onto his stomach so he could write easier and remain lying down. Draco tried to write out as much of the dream as he could but it sounded more poetic than he meant it to. He tried to sketch out some of it, and managed a bit of the teapot but it fell short of his imagination and he gave up, choosing instead to put it away.
This feeling of listless apathy was pervasive throughout more than just that single early June day; it bled through the many of them especially the late ones, through the weeks and the months that the made up the summer. Interests piqued and then were put to rest easily and without ceremony. He spent his days holed up in the Manor and resolutely did not feel guilty about his inactivity. One day, when the humid month of August was doing its very best, quite notably so, to ruin Draco’s hair and mood, he spent a lazy sweaty morning creating a rather bland omelet full of things that should have had flavor but didn’t, though that was more due to Draco’s taste buds than anything else, really. The coffee beans, that he found the energy to grind and deposit in his coffee machine, helped make the sticky morning a little more bearable with their rich, comforting aroma. Draco let his coffee grow cold, though it was an act that allowed himself a much needed relief from the monotony of ice water during his summer experience. But, as it were, the coffee grew mildly chilly and a little too sweet as the Manor’s air grew warm and thick. Draco felt the creeping dullness slither around his feet and up into the bones of his toes. The afternoon drew on wearily but at least he found the energy to build himself a small, sweet snack a few hours into the afternoon. What meager drive Draco managed to compile that morning dissipated and left him feeling weak. It was not until the coolness of the evening pressed down on Draco’s shirtless body that he managed to do much more than sigh to himself or flip through pages of a random book. He forced himself to rise from his reclined position and find a telephone to order in dinner, an act that seen as one of laziness but to Draco was an anxiety inducing exercise in social interaction over the phone with a stranger and having to make an actual decision. The thought of chewing and swallowing food was slightly nauseating to Draco, but he knew he needed to eat.
Draco, warm with faint relief, and general happiness at being in close proximity to his friend, mused, “Yeah, that makes sense, I think it would be good for me too. Though, to be honest, I haven’t been part of a study group since, like, high school.” He briefly remembered sitting with Pansy, Vince, and Greg in the middle of their crowded, noisy library, revising messy barely-comprehensible notes and editing papers with quiet academic fury turned inwards. Their finals, ensuring commencement, and uncertain futures tugging at their concentration, the pressure made bearable by the sweetness of their collective work effort. “Kind of miss that. That reminds me, I’m talking to Pansy at some point this evening!”
“No, really, don’t be, I’m actually kind of glad this is what you’re asking…” and Ron did look a bit relieved, “I thought maybe something had gone wrong or strange and I would have to yell at Blaise later. Which, obviously, would have been totally valid of you to feel and experience and express to me.” Ron shifted his weight, looking like he wanted to stretch his legs, “Listen, do you wanna come lay down next to me? Sometimes it’s easier to talk about things when you're looking at a white ceiling and actually comfortable.”
“Everyone seems really nice,” Draco responded, placing the dishes in the dish-rack and the utensils into the tub containing soap, water, and other silverware.
“Hey, Luna,” He said lightly as she began to walk by him. She looked up and over at him, her blue eyes seeming to sparkle under the fluorescent lights. He waved at her with a stiff hand and she nodded.
“I can help you take back your chairs if you want,” Hermione volunteered and Blaise accepted gratefully.
“Better. I mean I still have a shit-ton of stuff to study for and all, but the last hour or so has been helpful. I think this was a good idea.”
The two of them walked toward the coffee house and neither said another word. Sirius wasn’t put off by this however, it didn’t feel like a bad silence. He took some time to consider the man he was walking next to - Remus clearly was closer to Sirius’ age than most of the people they passed, had a disheveled but elegant style, and radiated a comfortable air of authority. He was long and thin and taller than Sirius, but not by much, his curly mess of hair giving him some more height than Sirius suspected he had. Remus’ hands, clasped tightly around his disorganized pile of papers caught Sirius’ attention several times as he glazed over the man as they were spotted with ink and one pinky was painted a bright green. Sirius was completely charmed.
“I’m just that strong” Blaise answered, flexing his muscles and wiggling his eyebrows. He then smirked over at Ron and put a finger to his lips. Ron grinned and turned to whisper loudly in Krum’s ear, “He had a friend help him.” He then looked back over to the rest of the group and asked if they were ready to start watching the movie. The resounding affirmations from everyone made it clear that they were, Ron pointed the remote and his computer on the coffee table for someone to finish setting it up the movie. Harry grabbed the remote and tapped at the computer for a moment before snatching two cookies and a cauldron cake for Hermione, and pressed play.
Now, Draco was on his way to the library, where the first study group would be held in a relatively small reserved room on the fourth floor. He brought with him some snacks to share with everyone, as Hermione had instructed, and his backpack bulging with notes and textbooks. He knew that he’d be early, but she would probably be as well, so he didn’t mind. And sure enough, when he stepped into the room, Hermione was already settled in, with her tablet surrounded by books and highlighters; her beautiful curly hair was up in a big messy bun, tendrils of it falling and framing her face. Draco took that to mean that she had actually been here for quite some time. Neville was there as well, pulling his own school paraphernalia out of his painted backpack. Draco sat down in a rolling chair next to him, and began his own process of unloading. Neville exchanged kind welcoming words with him as they both settled in.
“Don’t worry about it,” the man said, holding up a gratefully long-fingered hand placatingly. Sirius admired him and took in the brown soft curls on his head and the gold flecks in his eyes and made a decision.
In the first month of classes, Harry spent a lot of his time with Draco. Their shared class was held twice a week and they usually had lunch together once it was over. Often times, Harry’s (and now Draco’s) friends would join them - Mostly Blaise, but other others came in and out depending on their schedules. Harry, surprisingly having figured out how to manage procrastination once in university, helped Draco get in the groove of doing school work on a regular and normal basis, by securing a few hours here and there every few days or so for them to spend in the library. Sometimes they would get a study room on the quiet floors so that they could talk to each other and muddle through homework together, and other times they got big tables on the second floor of the library that was notably not quiet at all, and a few of their friends would join them. On top of all that, Harry was frequently spending time with Ron when he wasn’t doing school or RA related duties, and could often be found lounging in bed with him or in their common area. Draco usually would not join Ron and Harry when they were in Ron’s room, but he would happily sit with them as they watched movies or played board games or whatever in the open space. Harry thought it might be nice for Draco to join in his and Ron’s cuddle-times, but he knew it was too soon to invite him along and just had to hold onto the hope that one day they would be close enough friends that he could.
Between the three of them, they easily managed to get everything from the car and take it back up to the rooms. Ron wondered if the two other men were related in some way, but Draco seemed, for lack of a better word, fancy and the other guy was probably his butler or something like that. They didn’t talk much to each other or him, but he didn’t mind. Ron was fine helping out, and hoped that it would contribute to a more positive roommate relationship than the one had had last year. He thought about his freshman year for the amount of time it took to bring the rest of Draco’s things up to his room. Creevey hadn’t been a terrible roommate, but he hadn’t been that great either. He hadn’t been so good at cleaning up after himself, knowing how to interact with Ron after realizing he was trans, and often stayed up long hours into hours of the night. Ron hadn’t let it bother him too much, mostly because his friends were supportive and helped him out when he needed space away from his room and his floor in Gryffindor Tower. Also he knew confronting someone like Creevey would probably not do very much in the long run - maybe that was the easy way out, but Ron didn’t really care. He hoped this year would be different, Draco seemed like a pretty down to Earth guy, even with a (still unconfirmed) butler trailing after him.
“I don’t know.” Blaise sighed, but turned his head to smile down at Draco, “I don’t want to change our friendship, but I think she might feel at least somewhat similarly. I can’t be sure.”
“Then it’s settled,” Krum said and finished his drink with dramatic finality, roughly putting it back onto the table and grinning over at his boyfriend. “I can make the stop to Honeydukes, if you all want to go straight to the dorm to set up.” Everyone nodded and Cedric offered to accompany him. Ron texted Blaise back while Hermione brought a stack of dishes over to the counter and Harry followed her, juggling mugs and utensils a little more precariously. Tonks thanked them and started to clear the dirty dishes away.
“Maybe,” Ron shrugged, “or maybe we’re just pretty good at reading people. This group of friends especially, people tend to put quite some effort into knowing what’s going on with their friends, so as a collective we’re a lot more observant. At least, I think so.” Draco nodded again.
As he said this, Blaise nodded along. “Definitely,” he said, “let’s keep this break though, and then once it’s over, we can head over to the study room Cedric stole the table from. It’ll be quiet and we won’t bother anyone working through all those questions.” He gave Draco a strange, pleased look, before adding as an afterthought, “I’ll bring a book we can lean on since there won’t be a table.”
He fell into step behind her, and was startled by the strange images that were painted on her backpack. It appeared that Luna, or someone else, had painted a purple and pink octopus across the fabric, over the zippers and pockets. The octopus’s tentacles which were covered in violently bright magenta suction cups were wrapped around paintings of various objects including a pencil, a radish and turnip and a pear, and a rather indelicately squashed looking birthday cake; it seemed as though the more he looked at the bag, the more he discovered. Draco stumbled after her hurriedly to give her a compliment which she accepted gracefully and offered to paint his bag for him if he wanted.
And Harry began to understand what his friend was unsure about. It was always scary to try new things even with people you loved and trusted. Ron was nervous about trying out a completely different sexual experience than he’d had before. Harry was a bit nervous in return that he couldn’t offer that much in the way of advice because while he had been a top in the penetrative sense, as well as a bottom, it was probably a bit different if you were a person who had a penis. He wondered if it would have been better for Ron to talk to Hermione or someone else with a vagina about this, but then felt bad for thinking those thoughts. He could and should be able to support his friend, even if their experiences were different. He blurted out the first thing that came to his mind “Oh, okay. So, what, you got a strapon or something?” He cringed a little at those words but Ron snorted.
Ron sent another text to Krum as he walked out of the dorm-room after he told Draco he was going to go let his friends in. Draco waved him off, distractedly, focused on the array of posters Ron saw that he had lay out on his bed through the open door to his room. Walking down the hallway and getting into the elevator seemed to take forever. He tapped his foot impatiently on the thinly carpeted floor, waiting for the double doors to open and let him on the ground floor of the building. He barely had one foot through the silver moving doors before he was ambushed by two of his favorite people in the whole world.
Draco felt himself so a bit pink again, but felt comfortable and completed what he was going to say, “I think I thought you were straight,” Draco chuckled a bit at his own presumptiveness. Blaise smirked.
After that, he didn’t have much patience and brought his hands past his stomach to his sleep shorts, pushing them off him and then the bed without ceremony. It doesn’t take him long to conjure up images in his head of moving bodies and sweat-soaked skin and roaming hands, letting himself sink into the familiarity of his own imagined pornography and his hands do the work. Draco’s right hand came up to pinch at his nipples again, pulling each in turn, prodding them so that they remained hard and sensitive on his chest as his left hand spent time with his cock and balls, playing and teasing. He let his breath get heavy and his stomach grow tight with the slow building pleasure, holding off his orgasm for as long as possible, wanting to draw it out and let this be more than the quick jerk-offs he’d allowed himself the last few days in his shower.
[to PP 2:14] Thanks for letting me know! I’ll be back after dinner probably, if you want to watch another episode of Shameless.
Draco, with his hair damp and newly adorned clothes neatly situated on his body, sat on his bed with a breakfast bar and his travel mug of freshly made tea, and mentally prepared himself for class. The hour-long class was easy to sit through and it was a fairly short walk to and from his dorm. When he returned to his room, he leaned back on his cushions as he scrolled through his emails, waiting for Pansy’s facetime invite to come through. He knew she might be late but did not mind in the slightest - it wasn’t as if he had anything pressing to do anyway and he was looking forward to their conversation. Just as he was about to leave his email behind and check on a blog he liked to keep updated with, a notification came in from Pansy, and he clicked to that instead. It took a moment for the screen to change and his own camera to work, so he adjusted his position and fiddled slightly with his drying hair.
Draco felt bad about shifting the mood in this way and uncomfortable under the meaningful words that Hermione said. He realized that maybe she knew how he felt a little, her smile and eyes empathetic. The whole atmosphere, awkward but tender, was thankfully shattered when Krum came through the coffee shop doors and reseated himself at the table.
“Weird!” Harry said and then handed the box he had taken to Draco, “Here, open one for yourself and see who you get. Usually, they’re just the top people who run HU. The special ones are random professors and staff members. I think half of the ones that Ron and I’ve found were Dumbledore. Once I got McGonagall it was amazing. I showed it to her at work - she smiled at me and gave me a cookie.” While Harry was explaining, Ron watched as Draco opened the box. He lifted the chocolate frog to inspect it, nodded to himself, before peering down at the card.
“I was thinking The Dark Knight would be nice because Heath Ledger, but then also 10 Things I Hate About You for the same reason,” Harry said. Draco inclined his head in agreement. “But those would be fun and Ron said something about Zoolander. I’d rather not watch tv shows, though.” Hermione reached over and patted Harry’s hand which had begun to fidget with Draco’s blanket.
A vibration for the phone in her pocket interrupted her train of thought and brought her out of her conversation. She smiled apologetically at Harry who shrugged before retrieving it and looking at the screen.
“Oh.” Draco said, his eyebrows raising a fraction in surprise, “that’s very kind of you. I wouldn’t want to be presumptuous and intrude though, maybe I’ll talk to Ron about it later?”
The two of them fall silent, bodies laid out comfortably on Ron’s bed, their growing friendship blooming into the room. Draco smiled at Ron in a polite, thankful way and received a smile in return.
fucked someone before. It’s totally ok that this is your first time doing this specific thing and that you haven’t done it before this time. And you can hold out on it for as long as you want - just because you and Krum have been talking about it doesn’t mean it has to happen immediately, well I guess I don't know how long you two have been talking about it, but still. There shouldn’t be any pressure for you to even have sex like that if you don’t want to.”
“Cool,” said Harry, “Ron just went to let Blaise in. Cedric and Krum will probably be here pretty soon as well. Do you have a movie preference? We’re having trouble figuring out what to start with.”
Krum pulled a harness and a blue dildo and looked at them closely. Ron, now also mostly naked, noticed what Krum was doing and moved to sit next to him close enough for their thighs to press together.
“Yeah that makes sense, and it would be a really nice thing to do, in general, and we’ve mentioned it before. I think I should probably talk to Harry about his crush, though. It seems like maybe he’s more into Draco than we thought he was?”
. I know for a fact that you’ve read that Stephanie Meyers book at least a dozen time, so don’t even talk.”
“I don’t mind at all, you know that.” Harry said lightly and then tried to make Ron giggle by asking, “You gonna try bondage or something?” jokingly, swaying a bit to the side so that their shoulders bumped up next to each other. Ron sighed and leaned into him.
“Oh, hi, Harry, right?” He said a little louder than he meant to, and his face felt a rush of heat. He realized that he hadn’t acknowledged his roommate or the girl sitting on the couch next to Harry.
“Well, Harry and Ron grew up together - their families have been pretty close for a long time - Harry knows all of Ron’s siblings really well and they spend the holidays together sometimes.” Harry nodded enthusiastically at the mention, but didn’t bother to add anything, “I met them in high school, because I moved towns, and they were my first friends. Blaise and Luna, I think they might have known each other before last year, but I’m not really sure - they were already friends when we met them, which was through Parvati who’s my roommate.” Hermione shrugged and moved to fill her spoon up once more, “and Blaise and Luna knew Krum, which was how Ron met him.”
“True,” Hermione allowed, “like that Smart House movie was creepy as hell.” That comment garnered her murmurs of agreement and they all turned their attention back to the screen.
“I know places on campus,” Draco looked over at Krum and reminded the two of them, “I was here for a semester already. But yeah, it would be nice to go somewhere other than the dining hall - it was so different from how I remembered it, so…” Draco shrugged, not sure where he wanted his sentence to end, and then looked down at his hands which he hadn’t noticed were twisted in his lap around his phone until then.
Harry put his phone away as he stepped into the Great Hall. He scanned the building for a good place to sit that Hermione would be able to find easily, since it was still early in the evening and most people would not be getting dinner for another forty-five minutes or so, it didn’t take him all that long. Picking a table finally, Harry dropped his backpack and jacket onto a seat and walked towards the buffet tables in order to fix a meal for himself.
“I’m a professor here, I teach several classes. You caught me just as I was heading out of my last one for the day.” A server brought their drinks and pastries. They both thanked her politely. “Thank you, this is lovely,” Remus directed at Sirius, taking a careful bite of the croissant.
“Um, well, I have a history of sexuality class, with Harry -” Harry grinned brightly at the mention, and Draco smiled back “- and I’m taking another history class, it’s an American one, covering the 1940s until now. Oh, and an intro to astronomy class, for the science requirement, but I’m kind of excited about it. Also Statistics, because math. Um, I enrolled in a creative writing and poetry class, but I might drop it if five classes is too much…” Blaise smirked a bit and leaned forward.
“Here, look at this,” Draco said as he handed his butler the letter, “I need help making a decision.”
“That’s really nice of you, Luna’s really talented but people sometimes let her weirdness get in the way of them being friends with or even friendly to her,” Harry said thoughtfully as he stepped in front of Draco to open the door to the dining room, holding it for Draco to walk through before following him inside. “Let’s find a table and drop our stuff off and then get food? So we don’t have to carry our bags around.”
“Let’s go somewhere other than the Great Hall,” Krum said, “we ate there yesterday and we should show Draco the other places on campus anyway.” Ron nodded in agreement.
“I already took Stat, but I can help tutor you if you want,” he said, “I was really good at it.” Draco was sure Blaise was good at a lot of things, but elected not to say as much as he watched the darker man lean back into his seat.
“It’s kind of punk but also kind of cute, but in an angry way? You should just ask Krum honestly, I just like to listen to them, but I’m not really a music person. But you should come see them play! Then you can hear them for yourself.”
Neither of them seemed to know exactly what to say next, Ron knew that Draco had something on his mind that he had been wanting to talk through, but really did not want to push him or presume the subject. He thought it might have to do with the Fall Break thing, but Harry assured him that his and Draco’s conversation the other day had gone pretty well and they were all looking forward to hanging out for a bit during their time away.
Mr. Dobby, when he noticed that Draco had not come down for breakfast like he had informed him he would, went to check on the young man and found him still asleep in an awkward position with his laptop open and dark, half on the Draco’s lap.
“No, no, don’t apologize,” Draco tried to share what he was feeling, without further alienating the two of them, “look, I’d be happy to kiss you, I mean you are a very kissable person, do not get me wrong, because really, really you are. But I haven’t really done that in a long time and I’m not looking for a relationship or anything. I’m sorry if I lead you on, I didn’t mean to.” Draco was sure his cheeks were burned with embarrassment and shame at his own hesitant desire, where before they were inflamed with confusion, though he was glad for himself for getting his words out at least somewhat coherently. He looked down at his lap so that he didn’t have to look Blaise in the eyes.
“Well, math and science, like I said. I took an ancient mythology class which was pretty interesting,”
“Definitely not something to miss,” Hermione said, as she watched her friend viciously devour his lunch. She shook her head at the sight before taking more measured bites of her own.
“Wow is right,” Blaise smiled back. He pecked at Draco’s lips one more time before pulling back. Draco watched his eyes flick up and down his face, probably taking in his mussed hair and red, swollen lips. He took that as an invitation to look at Blaise’s face more closely as well, he truly was a beautiful man. “That was fun, thank you.” Draco reached a hand forward to Blaise’ chest, as if to even out the attention, but Blaise just captured it and held it softly within his own.
“Do you think you might ask her out eventually?” Draco asked. He too shifted so he was sitting next to Blaise, the wall a reassuring cool surface to press against.
[to Sprog 2:25] harry! Got here about half an hour ago, taking some time to walk around and see where you spend your waking hours.
Draco took her advice and stood up from the table, he stretched his arms above his head and let out a small noise. His shirt rode up a little bit and when he sat back down, muscles loose, he noticed Harry turning away from him with a little blush high on his cheeks. Draco let that percolate in his mind as he looked around the room to see what everyone else was up to.
“...the only person who’s let me paint their bag is Neville. I think everyone else just thinks my paintings would be too eccentric for them, but I’d make sure they’d match people’s comfort levels, I don’t think they quite believe me though...,” Luna told him and he could understand why, but it made him a bit sad. He didn’t think he’s like to get a lot of attention and carrying around a bag painted in such a way would definitely get him noticed, but Luna seemed trustworthy and open, regardless of, and rather additional to, her whimsy. He chose not to say that, and instead informed her that he thought her bag was magnificent and would be honored to have something painted by her - though, perhaps, not his backpack.
“I definitely wanna try this, but not tonight, if that’s ok? I want to talk it through with you more, like we’ve done with everything else.”
“And, listen,” Ron continued, “I don’t want you to feel like you have to tell me something, just because I’ve noticed you have something on your mind. But I’d like to hear what’s going on and what’s been tugging at you.”
Roughly two hours later, Hermione and Ron were in the Common Room, searching for a place to sit together. Hermione was carrying with her a fresh mug of coffee and Ron had a late lunch in a paper bag from one of the bakeries. They found an open round table towards the middle of the building, the other tables and occupants loosely in a circle near a staircase. Hermione pulled out her tablet and a bluetooth keyboard while Ron started on his cheese toast and fruit cup.
“I’ll see what I can do for you, Mr. Malfoy. Don’t get your hopes up though, it’s very late for housing requests. I will either call you or send you an email as soon as I can. And if you have no further questions, take another cookie to give to Mr. Potter on your way out.” Draco stared at Ms. McGonagall for a moment, taking in the hard lines of her face and her soft eyes, the tight way her hair was pulled back and the soft velvety look of the clothes she wore.
“Oh not much, just finishing some edits on one of my midterms.” Draco’s mouth twisted with a slight grimace and Ron could really empathize.
“Ok yeah and sounds actually pretty cool,” Draco thought it sounds more than just cool - it sounded amazing and he was a bit jealous and a bit full of aching desire for something like what Ron and Krum have.
By the time Dean and Seamus walked in, about forty-five minutes later, Draco had completed a packet of flashcards for his American history class with terms and important dates, and begun working through the study guide for Stat, making note of questions that we more difficult for him to figure out - he planned to ask Blaise for some help with it later, remembering his offer to tutor. Hermione took their entrance as a cue to take a short break and called everyone to order,
Draco nervously stepped out of his car in the parking lot in front of the administration office of Hogwarts University. He pulled at the sleeves of his jacket and the buttons of his shirt as he made his way toward the building. Draco pushed through the glass doors easily and walked the few steps it took to the welcome desk of the office. A young man sat behind it with curly dark hair and wire rimmed glasses that were falling off his nose. He seemed very engrossed in the book he kept under the wood of the desk, head bowed and unobservant. Draco hesitated before disrupting the man’s concentration, watching him quietly for a second before clearing his throat in a way he hoped wasn’t overly annoying.
Harry and Hermione all but tackled him back into the elevator, hugging him with such enthusiasm that he felt his body press against the back wall. Hermione’s hair somehow managed to make its way into his mouth, but Ron didn’t mind. There was some squealing and jumping before the three of them detached themselves from each other so that Ron could press the (3) button and send them up to his floor. Harry kept his right arm around Ron’s shoulders while Hermione held onto his waist from the left side.
“Cool,” Ron said and Harry nodded, his cheeks full to bursting and looking a bit like a chipmunk to Draco.
“Yeah I kind of got that impression. I’m not really interested in anything concrete or beyond platonic, so I think we kind of matched up well in that regard. Does Blaise make out with anyone else in this group?”
Draco had turned in for the night earlier than he figured he would have if he was normal. On the way back to the dormitories, Draco happily exchanged numbers with Hermione and Blaise and waved goodbye to everyone except for Ron and his boyfriend once they arrived at their hall. He wasn’t all that surprised that Krum followed Ron up to the dorms, but felt awkward about it. He didn’t know either of them very well wasn’t sure how he felt about them doing things in the room next to his. He just hoped he didn’t have to hear it. Upon arriving at their dorm, Draco separated quickly from his two companions and made his way into his room. He saw Ron and Krum head into Ron’s.
Draco interjected, “I’m not sure of the kind of hours I’ll be keeping, just so you know. I haven’t been in college for a while and I want to keep up with my work.”
“I met some people when I was here the first time, mostly just people in my classes and a few who lived on the same floor as me in the Slytherin dorms, I’m sure some of them are still around, I didn’t stay in contact with anyone though.” Draco looked down at his plates, which still had food on them even though his stomach felt uncomfortably full. He had been hungry coming in but once he was sitting down and listening to everyone and getting caught up in the new exciting people, his appetite seemed to have slipped away. “I don’t really mind though, none of them were all that nice or interesting, they were just people I met along the way, I guess. I think it might be different this year, or at least I hope it will be,” Draco offered Hermione a weak smile just as Ron stood up and collected a few of the empty plates around the table. Draco picked up his own, feeling a bit guilty for the leftover food, and followed him to the corner in back of the dining area where people dropped off their plates, utensils, and trash.
“That would be so fun!” Hermione said after some chewing, “though I think you should talk to Draco before we get this ball rolling, to check in with him about this happening and find out if he thinks it might be something that could help him. If he thinks it might not, we can come up with a new plan.”
Harry shook his head. “You know I usually don’t mind those kinds of things. And anyway, like I told you before, whatever my feelings towards Draco are, they don’t include feeling bad about him flirting with other people. Why though? Do you mind? I know you have a bit of a thing for Blaise.”
Draco walked back down the hallway to Ms. McGonagall’s office once more, this time a little lighter on his feet and a bit more confident, carrying his open laptop with him. She called for him to come in when he knocked on the door and she seemed to notice his change in energy, and smiled at him.
“Wait, you two know each other?” Ron asked, looking between the two men. Draco stepped forward towards the sitting friends, “cool.”

Hermione answered “nothing” but Harry said “badly written books.” Ron grinned brightly at the two of them. There was a beat of silence before the same blond waiter brought Ron, Harry, and Krum mugs full of coffee, orange juice, and more coffee respectively, all balanced on a black plastic tray. They thanked him after he assured them their food would be coming soon.
“Oh,” Draco said, not knowing what else to say, “that’s cool that you got to go to university with people you already knew.” Hermione smiled and finished her cake, using her finger to make sure she got all of the icecream and crumbs.
“Well, Nightmare Before Christmas and The Black Cauldron seem to have just as much, if not more dead people,” Ron said after a bit, “it looks like there are actually a bunch of scary, strange, weird movies that Disney made over the years…”
Hermione let her thoughts drift away as they entered into Prefect Hall. She didn’t think that anyone had minded her being lost in her own world as they walked from Puddifoots to here. They probably hadn’t noticed, as the three boys were now busy trying to figure out which movie to start with.
As Sirius answered him, Remus polished off the last of his pastry - his own was relatively untouched as he’d been the one talking more out of the two of them. After sharing a brief rundown of the three weeks Sirius spent in the Netherlands, not going into much detail, though there was plenty to share, he inquired Remus of what he hoped to spend time doing in Amsterdam. As he listened, he munched down his croissant as well, and nodding with interest.
They watched quietly as the first scene of the movie unfolded, grinning to each other a little when Elizabeth Swan sang the creepy pirates song and later when Will Turner introduced himself. The first person who spoke was Blaise, though, after the flashback saying,
Draco nodded, thinking that was fair. He thought back to Theo as a roommate and returned Ron’s soft expression, “My roommate my first semester wasn’t that bad. We had one of those 2 people per room, 4 people per suit dorm configurations. We just didn’t get along all that well, we didn’t say much to each other, and he was kind of messy. He would have his girlfriends or whoever over without giving me warning besides the classic sock on the door handle, which honestly could have been funny if it weren’t so annoying.” There wasn’t much to say other than that so Draco asked Ron worriedly, “What about you?”
maybe, or at least a nudge in a different direction. I mean, I kind of sat there and just realized how little I had done since my parents died and how unhappy I was. I mean I’m not sure if I’m happy now, but you know, the note kind of just helped me ask myself a question I’d been avoiding, you know?”
“Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Remus Lupin, though I’d prefer if you called me Remus. I finished my doctorate a few years ago and am happy to have the honor of returning the education I received at Hogwarts University to all of you.” His smile was kind as he spoke and when he looked around the room, Draco had to stop himself from smiling back, not wanting to seem strange. “Let's start by going around the room so you all can introduce yourselves to me and the rest of your class. Please share your name, pronouns, and majors and/or minors, and a fun thing you did this summer - annoying question, I know, but I was us all to get to know each other a bit better. Why don't we start with you?” Dr. Lupin said, gesturing with both hands open-faced to a girl sitting to the left- and front-most seat of the classroom.
“I just think it’s funny. I mean when I was younger I definitely thought he looked older, but now it’s obvious they just changed his fucking hair style!”
“Yeah, probably. Listen, Remus, this was really great - though again, sorry for running into you and knocking your books and everything. I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you. Would you be interested in meeting me for coffee again?”
Hermione, then, abandoning her plateful of food, extracted her tablet from her handbag and started tapping at it. When Harry inquired as to what she was doing, she turned it around and showed him the short lists she had begun of: people to invite, types of exams to study for, snacks to buy, and short fifteen-minute activities that could break up the monotony of studying. He took the tablet from her and added a few ideas of his own so that she could start eating as he was mostly finished his meal at this point. By the time he and Hermione felt confident in the lists they had created, Blaise made his way over to their table with Luna and a person Harry did not recognize in tow. The three of them were all carrying plates and cups and they easily fit themselves around the table.
“Mr. Malfoy, I understand that you are nervous. It’s good that you came in to talk in person. Maybe next time, it would be wise to write down questions that you have before setting up a meeting. As I wrote in my letter to you earlier this month, this University is a small one and we like to take care of our students, so don’t worry too much. Why don’t you go back into the waiting area and take some time to sign up for classes? After that, you can come back in here and we can close this meeting up. The main thing to remember, Mr. Malfoy, is that we want to make sure this transition is as painless as possible. So take your time, and breathe.”
“Yeah I saw them when I added what I brought.” Draco replied and thought for a moment of how to phrase what he wanted to say next, not wanting to sound annoying or patronizing by wanting the space clean. “I’d really like to keep this space, maybe not completely clean, but orderly maybe?  We’re not children and we don’t need to make a chores list or something, but it would make me feel better if we both tried to keep things from getting too messy or anything.”
As he stood, balancing his laptop and the two cookies in his hands, Ms. McGonagall wished him a good day and followed him so she could close the door once he existed it. Draco walked back to the couch and packed away his laptop, placing the cookies on the coffee table in front of it. Then he made his way out of the building, stopping at Harry’s desk for a moment to pass along the treat.
“Sorry it took me a while,” Blaise said, leaning towards Hermione, “Luna asked if she and Cho could join us. I figured it would give you two plenty of time to talk about whatever you needed to talk about.”
“That’s a good idea thank you.” Draco responded, watching as Harry retrieved the office supplies and sat back down. “I was a freshman here a little less than two years ago, so I went through the signing-up-for-class thing before. I uh…” Draco’s words faded away as he tried to formulate a response that did not require talking about his late parents as being a reason for not returning after one semester, “I just spent some time away, but I’m back now.”
“Yes, I would like that as well. Here, give me your phone, I’ll plug in my number,” Sirius handed it over, delighted, and Remus thumbed at it quickly, “I texted myself so I’ll have yours as well.”
“That was probably nice though, I mean you got to see different options and not take the bullshit filler classes. And I’m sure they covered some of your gen-eds anyway.”
“Maybe give me an overview? Or I could guess? But making assumptions tends to be not the most helpful things…” he smiled sheepishly.
Harry nodded, “again, same. I asked Draco what he was doing for his break and he didn’t seem sure, so I mentioned that we all kind of congregate at Ron’s. He said he'd talk to him and then maybe join us!”
A few hours later, Hermione lay on her bed, belly up and glassy eyes blinking up at the ceiling. She had a friend, Harry, tucked neatly around her body, warm and heavy where he pressed into her. She slowly, so slowly, brought an arm up and started petting at his hair, which was attached to his head that was up against her collarbone, breathing warm air across the top of her breasts through her soft, warm sleep shirt. She lazily twirled a lock of hair around her finger and felt the slide of the thick black strands pull and loosen around her skin. Hermione’s thoughts were lazy and floaty as they lay there breathing together. His seemed to pull him closer to sleep while she drifted along through the high. Eventually she allowed herself to blink slowly into sleep along with him, content with the environment around her, the way her body felt, and how unbelievably soft everything was.
“I have a friend like that - Pansy - I think I told you guys about her. Our parents were close so we were often placed in the care of the same babysitter when we were young and they went to parties and functions and all that.”
Ron watched as his friends debated over movies and then as Draco emerged from his room and joined in on the conversation as he sat down on one of Ron’s chairs. Ron was happy to watch any of the options his friends were discussing so he let them chose and he nodded his head every once in awhile. After they finally decided to start with Pirates of the Caribbean because that was an easy choice and then probably move on to Deadpool or Empire Records, depending on how they were feeling, Ron got a text from Krum telling him that he and Cedric had come. It was Harry who went down to get them this time because Ron was comfy in his bean-bag and didn’t want to go back down again. Hermione started popping the popcorn in Ron’s microwave and Draco looked over at Ron. It seemed like there was something Draco wanted to ask him, like there was a question on the tip of his tongue he wasn’t ready to let go of. But the blond didn’t say anything and just let his face soften into a polite, blank kind of face.
