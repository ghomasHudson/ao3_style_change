“I assume you had good reason for doing so,” Draco says, not at all buying it.
Mari blinks at him. “Oh.”
Harry looks around at the rest of his team. He smiles at Jimmy Peakes, one of the Beaters from his team during sixth year. He gives Jimmy a reassuring nod.
Hermione sets the book aside and joins him on the floor. “You’re wondering—”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says quickly. “It’s just. That’s. Anyway. Now, I don’t want this next thing to come across the wrong way, so bear with me.”
,” Ron says before shoving a forkful of roasted chicken into his mouth.
They’re in the hospital wing, Draco’s one functioning limb around Potter’s shoulder, their hands still pressed together, radiating intense heat. Where he should feel everywhere else, there’s nothing. No jagged pain, no head splitting sensation. It’s all gone now.
It’s not
Ginny snorts. “The sneezing thing happened one time. The rest, he just dropped.”
, he thinks, even as damp skin slips against his fingers.
“We don’t even have to touch. You can just look. It might help you get used to the idea of seeing more in the future.”
“Good. I’d rather like for it to happen again, and soon, if possible.”
“I’m aware.”
“Godric’s Hollow? Where the Potters used to live?”
Bill chuckles and places his hands on her shoulders. “Mum, please sit and eat,” he says and kisses her on the cheek.
problem?”
“So?” Leon asks, looking around to see who’s still in the classroom. Harry notices a slight scowl when his eyes pass over Draco.
“This is fucking stupid,” Harry says as he crosses his arms. “We’re just supposed to sit here and do nothing when we know some kind of ancient magic is loose in the castle?”
Kingsley laughs, a deep chuckle. “I daresay he is, yes. Overall, after the initial shock of this, it seems like Draco has everything working for him here. The chances of being punished for these made-up crimes are slim to none, I’d venture.”
Draco isn’t even able to run forward to yank the other girl out of harm’s way before she starts wailing, the cries making his blood freeze over. He wants to help, but the last thing he needs is to be found here, now. A quiet escape is in order, he thinks. He can regroup and figure out what to do next, maybe double back and pretend he’s coming to address the screaming.
But that’s not the real problem, is it? Of course not. Harry made a mistake—a permanent one, for Draco—but that’s what it had been. Just a mistake. No, the real problem is the context, all of the crushing emotions that gushed from him with the blood on that bathroom floor. That whole year…
“Oh. Hello, Bill,” Harry says, the wind stolen from his sails. He’d rather been hoping to do this one-on-one. Still, it’s a pleasant surprise to see Bill here.
The world does pause for a moment; it’s like a giant glass bowl has been set on top of this moment, everything else outside its curved walls no longer important.
This earns her a few laughs, no easy feat when delivering news like this.
“Of course,” Draco says, “but
“I’m serious. Let’s do this.”
Harry blinks at him. “Right, you still don’t know me all that well. Planning isn’t much my thing. I tend to jump in and figure things out as I go.”
Draco stands in his room, tears staining the collar of his pajama shirt. Harry’s footsteps are angry and heavy as he retreats, and Draco takes a minute to collect himself before throwing his robes over his pajamas and rushing out of his room.
They’re both clothed now. It’s like some spell has broken, like things are a little bit more like how they used to be. Something had enclosed them, blocked out the past—
“Think so. I feel like proper shit, though,” he says with a sardonic laugh.
And as he scans the crowd to find his friends and his boyfriend, he accidentally locks onto a pair of shining gray eyes, ones he’d just seen in an unwelcome fantasy. Draco is trying to say something with his face, perfect painting of remorse, but Harry tears his gaze away and finally finds his friends, struck with an odd sense of regret, of longing, waves of it that almost feel like they’re coming from someplace external.
“Bella knows that
Harry blinks at her, trying not to get angry himself. The situation is a bit insensitive on his part, if he takes a step back. “I already said this is not about that. Explicitly. You can say no. I just figured that if you both agreed to this, once we’re there Leon and I can do our own thing and the two of you can do yours, to a certain extent. Not enough that it’s obvious what’s really going on, but anybody who’s paying attention at all will already know that Leon and I are friends, so the two of us spending time together there won’t seem unusual as long as we come with other people.”
“Is there anything else I can do?” Harry asks, standing up. The vulnerability isn’t gone, but shelved away, determination taking its place. Madam Pomfrey pats him on the shoulder.
“Are they okay?” he asks as he approaches.
…it’s too much.
“Potentially. I have alerted the Minister of Magic of my suspicions and my understanding is that the Aurors will be returning any day.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, dear, you shouldn’t have to cook your own birthday dinner.”
“Why do you say you ‘think?’” She doesn’t sound accusatory in any way. Just curious.
“Well, share what you’re comfortable sharing, and I can try to give you an outsider perspective.”
“I’ll try to keep this short, because time is of the essence,” Dumbledore says; his smile has dissipated. “Draco is fine.”
She sighs. “Draco, I have far more important things to worry about right now than your choice in a romantic partner. While I think it complicates things to a certain degree, I’m not going to tell you that the two of you can’t be together. Especially if it means you have Harry Potter fighting on your side. I’m told that means a great deal,” she says with a smile in Harry’s direction.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Alright, then no big deal!” Leon says with a big smile.
“This is ridiculous,” Harry growls, gently pulling his arm away from Leon. “Why the hell would you want that? In case you missed the rest of the conversation, Leon is my
“I was just saying that I don’t give a rat’s arse about this tri-House Quidditch team rule. McGonagall will allow us to get the Gryffindor team back together if you’re the one who asks, right?”
Harry finds that the words affect him now just as much, if not more. He also smiles slightly to himself when he realizes the sign might be updated to mention he’s now technically survived the Curse
the time for whatever it is he wants?
“Regardless,” Blaise continues, “I’m just saying I care more about the continuation of our house then I do about something as trivial as blood status.”
Some of them are true.
“She still has feelings for you, Harry.”
Harry gives Leon a squeeze on his elbow and a little smile before he breaks off again; he locates Draco as people start to shuffle out of the courtyard.
Her sigh is audible. “With me? With Hogwarts? No. I’m afraid punishing you might draw more attention to the matter. And, when all is said and done, you saved Mister Malfoy’s life, as you won’t allow me to forget. My hope is that the Ministry has no way of knowing you used blood magic, because it’s so ancient and forbidden that they most likely don’t track it anymore. But what with everything that’s happened in the last few years, I wouldn’t be surprised if they started looking for it again, either.”
Which is. You know. It’s fine! Harry reminds himself again that they’re taking things slow, and he knows it will be all the better that they are.
“Well, I think that somewhere, even if not consciously, you were also interested in him. So you didn’t think of it as leading him on, because part of you reciprocated the feelings. But whatever the case may be, he feels rejected and you won’t speak to him about why. He could be feeling a number of things. Maybe he’s worried that you’re not actually interested in men and that you’re homophobic.”
Yay! Another chapter! This one took a much different turn than what I initially had planned but as is often the case, I like it even better as a result! As always, if you're enjoying please leave a comment so we can chat together, I love interacting with y'all!
open. Seems pretty straightforward to me.”
It’s a Tuesday afternoon. Most people are relaxing after a day of classes and trying to enjoy the weather before fall and then winter sneak in. But Draco is scouring the library, looking for a head of bushy hair that he’s sure must be present somewhere.
A murmur ripples through the crowd. That’s less than thirty people, and there are nearly sixty who had tried out.
He nods, still unsure of what to say. McGonagall clasps her hands together.
“What was that all about?” Draco asks, looking suspicious.
“Draco, wait,” Harry calls after him, but he’s already gone, practically sprinting down the hallway. All the while his arm is still ablaze, a warm tingle that washes over every nerve. It almost makes him turn around, but as he puts more and more distance between them, it starts to fade.
“Of course.” Draco swallows thickly, every pore on fire. He doesn’t have time to consider why kissing Harry feels like being reborn, why it feels like
“Perfect—”
“Finally, we will be offering counseling services to any student who feels they might like to take advantage of that. If anybody is interested, I ask that they be in contact with me by means of letter and we can continue from that point. This service will be completely free and the schedule of sessions will be completely up to you. In addition, I can assure you that all of our staff members are here to support you in whatever ways we can. Hogwarts has gone through a horrible, horrible battle and while we admire your bravery, you still are young people and our future. We’d like to make sure that you’re each coping well with the recent events and this is our main priority, especially in the first few months back.”
“Are you sure nobody will hear us here?” Harry asks, glancing all around him.
“But it’s a man?” Draco whispers, leaning forward.
“Wait. I’m sorry, I’m not trying to make fun of you or anything. It’s just. Wow.”
Harry frowns. “You’re fluent in French.”
“You’re awake.”
Alright, that's it from me for now. I hope everybody is having a wonderful end to 2019, and here's hoping in 2020 I'll be able to give this fic a bit more attention (I definitely will when summer comes around but I'm not sure about before then). I've already settled on the idea that it's going to take a good amount of time to finish writing and posting this, and it means a lot to me that so many people are sticking around for the journey. 100k words down, and here's to another 100k!!! <3
Draco waves her off. “Please. My mother has connections. Even with my reputation—”
Mari emerges from the stone with an odd squelch and falls to her knees. McGonagall joins her there and holds her as she weeps. There are welts covering her in a layer where she had been sucked into the wall. Luckily Madam Pomfrey is also somehow there already, pushing through the few bystanders with a large bag in her hands.
Draco stifles a laugh, thanks Madam Pomfrey (who looks less than happy but certainly relieved to have them out of her hair), and joins Luna in their walk to Ravenclaw Tower. To his surprise, she’s silent for most of the trip, until they make their final turn.
about me, which is fair because it was never real in the first place, I guess, but it still feels like I’m going absolute bonkers. On top of all of that, I was really hoping somebody else would ask me to come to this stupid fucking ball so I could back out of this ridiculous plan, but nobody did. So I’m feeling pretty sorry for myself, which I think is more than warranted. I wish I could be a better date for Leon, because none of this is his fault and he seems like a great guy. But seeing you two so happy together…”
The next row pains him the most, though in the moment he doesn’t understand why. He sees Leon Laurent, and Cedric Diggory, and Draco Malfoy. This baffles him most of all, even as he reaches backward and someone grabs his hand, but it can’t be Draco because his body is on the ground at Harry’s feet and his blood is staining Harry’s socks through his shoes and his hair is spattered with his own life.
“We’re going to delay the inevitable for as long as we can, and when it happens we’ll be prepared. Nobody’s going to find you here, at any rate.”
“Well, they’ve had some extra practice,” Harry says. “So, you don’t know yet what form yours will take?”
“I do say so.”
He knocks on Slughorn’s door tepidly, already dreading the inevitable awkward meeting with his Head of House. To top it off, he’d forgotten to write ahead to let Slughorn know he was coming.
“We have a lot of history. Ancient and recent.”
“Maybe going a little far there, but after all these years I can certainly tell when something isn’t right in Harry’s world. Aside from all of the obvious,” she jokes.
“Fine,” she says, scooping eggs onto her plate and pouring herself a glass of juice. “I just noticed, your hair’s gotten awfully long.” Her eyes are red, the echoes of blotchiness on her face still visible.
Harry laughs slightly but is immediately sobered by a stony glare. “I didn’t think about that. Look, Ginny, that’s not what this is about. I promise. Do you trust me?”
A chuckle. “That’s true.”
“I’ll take that as a ‘no.’ Look here,” she says, producing a flyer from her pocket. “It’s in two weeks. A date is mandatory, and inter-house and inter-school mixing are highly encouraged! How exciting is this?”
“How long have you known?” Harry asks, staring at his hand on Draco’s chest.
“Not now,” she clarifies. “And I know you have tryouts today. But afterward, you and I are sitting down and we’re talking about…you know.” She glances at Leon, whose forehead is practically touching his parchment. Harry feels his insides twist at that, trying to avoid his face from heating up.
Draco nods politely to the other three before sitting next to Blaise, dreading any more conversation that includes inquiries about his summer. It had been absolute hell, and reliving it is so far off his to-do list it may as well be someone else’s job. To his relief, Blaise makes almost no effort to indicate he’s noticed Draco’s presence, instead focusing on a very new looking book.
“He’s never had chocolate frogs. Absolute tragedy,” Ron says, shaking his head.
“I do.”
“Possibly. Meet back in the courtyard in an hour?”
“Are you excited about today?” Leon asks quickly, noticing Harry’s glance at his plate.
Harry’s blood goes cold. Of course she had; working in the Hospital Wing she must have overheard that entire exchange following Draco’s near miss with death. Permanent death, at least. Rowan has been killing just to get in and out of Hogwarts, as well as orchestrating a chain of horrible events to torture the students. No doubt the deepest and blackest of magic has been involved in the controlling of whatever horrible things live beneath the castle.
“I’m well aware,” Leon says, venom in his voice. “His energy is just rather...off-putting” he decides.
be a next time.
“This really seems over the top. I’m
Sorry.
“Fair enough. Have a good night, Ginny.”
Harry drums his fingers on the table. “Not fully. I don’t know the whole situation. I’m just wondering if you’re perhaps a bit biased.”
“You’re a lovely dancer,” Luna says as Harry does his best to lead, focusing mostly on avoiding her feet.
Draco swallows, his throat going sore from how hard he’s trying not to cry. “Who is it?” he asks, and his voice is small, broken.
. He’s not sure why, but he’d been expecting a stuffy, older man. This woman couldn’t be more than three or four years older than Draco, and she seems...kind.
“I had to kill him and bring him back to life to get him to the Hospital Wing and out of the wall,” Harry adds, in case it’s still not clear enough.
He feels Hermione swat his shoulder. “Yes, you’ll see.” Ron laughs through his nose as they start forward, Harry listening to his own breathing and the sound of quiet footsteps on stone as they go. He’s desperately listening around him for clues, his heart pounding as they guide him. They make a few turns, the silence around them a bit disconcerting. Finally, they come to a stop.
“There, there,” Luna says. “At least it’s not the first time.”
“I saw him.”
She grins. “I didn’t have the same luxury with my dad. I was underage and all that. Plus, hair growing charms can be a bit tricky. Anyway, the point is, I probably won’t make any mistakes because I’m used to higher stakes.”
Harry looks down at Hermione, whose facial expression is a strange mix of concern and offense. “You do understand where he’s coming from, don’t you?”
“But I—”
“We’re giving students until Friday. Five days, no more. Many have already departed, and the rest of the staff is currently assisting in seeing off another wave.”
. But isn’t that sort of the goal now anyway?
It does feel strange to think about youth in the past tense.
“Quite a bit,” Draco admits, his cheeks flushing. “We didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but…”
“Great to meet you, too,” Harry says as she walks off. Bella’s expression changes immediately when she rejoins Eva and they start speaking in French.
“Thanks for volunteering again, Ron! Why don’t you stand up and we can demonstrate?”
She frowns. “Doing what?”
Hermione gasps and swats his arm. “Harry! You did not!”
“Um, it’s about the war. You know how I told you that Beauxbatons was also attacked around the same time Hogwarts was?”
And it’s creeping up his legs.
something that Harry has ever even considered. Growing up in the Muggle world, he’s heard some things about homosexuals, many of which have not exactly been positive. A few different words keep creeping toward the front of his mind, taunting him. Poof. Fairy. Fag. Queer. Perv. It makes his vision swim and his chest constrict, because he doesn’t agree with those things himself. At least, he doesn’t think so. He’s never even met a gay person before, not that he knows of. But he has no reason to think negatively of gay people.
Harry nods, carefully slipping the stack of papers into his bag and exiting the room, closing the door behind them. They head out to the grounds together, passing by lots of students high off finishing class for the day.
“Well it’s not like I just want a free ride,” Harry fires back, slightly hurt.
Harry looks back up, finally meeting Hermione’s eyes properly for the first time since they’d arrived. He then looks at Ron, his face scrunched in worry. “Thanks, you two,” he says, feeling embarrassed. He’s grateful they haven’t mentioned the stack of frames in his arms. “I think I needed this. It sort of feels like I’ve really said goodbye, now.”
Draco moves slightly closer. Their noses are nearly touching, Harry’s slow, even breaths like mild gusts across Draco’s cheekbones.
Harry sighs. “I know. It is for me, too, if that makes you feel better.”
“Don’t you all have somewhere to be?” she snaps at the rest of the crowd that has formed. They all slink away, eyeing the pair that remain.
He bites at the inside of his cheek and looks down, sighing.
“Is any of this
His breath almost catches in his throat and he can feel desire building in his gut. “Leon,” he breathes. “We really do need to go.”
. He’d woken up in tears many nights after the war, his pores evicting droplets of sweat as if
“That’s why I feel drawn to it at all, I think. Remedying all of the hurt I’ve caused by doing the opposite.”
It’s safe to say it had been the worst of his life, second only to the beginning of this one, perhaps. But things have taken a drastic turn in only a month. Draco from sixth year would never believe where he ends up, that the same boy who tore him open could be the one to stitch him together.
Though he still doesn’t understand the full implications, what Draco does know is that Potter did something powerful, dangerous, and
He knocks on Mari’s door, holding his breath and sincerely hoping she’s in. As he contemplates how odd it is that he’s now so comfortable coming here, the door swings open.
Ron gapes at him. “I know the two of you have some kind of friendship going on or whatever, but this was ridiculous. He spouted all of this
Harry places his hands on his hips and sits down on an ugly, tattered chaise. “I guess it’s possible. We never did quite figure out all the quirks of this place.”
“I need to see Mari.”
Harry walks into his classroom and a hush blankets the room. He’s not sure if he’ll ever get used to that. He surveys the room to see if anybody is missing. Hermione and Ron are sitting attentively and setting a good example. He smiles at a few of his friends as he scans, and then makes eye contact with Draco, who gives him a sort of half smile and then looks away.
“Fine,” Draco says and stands. He thinks better on his feet. As he paces back and forth in the kitchen, he starts to formulate an oral strategy. “So we Apparate into Hogwarts, as close to the Room of Requirement if possible. Hopefully there won’t be anybody around since the school is closed until next autumn.”
He shakes his heads, licking his lips, ignoring the taste of blood and sweat. “Obviously, you don’t know me at all. I’d sooner kill myself than go back on what’s right. And even if you can take Hogwarts, there’s an entire Ministry to answer to.”
book on memory spells, and I’m hoping I can find something worthwhile.”
McGonagall is sitting in her office, writing something furiously. “Yes, Mister Potter. Please, come in, come in,” she says a little absentmindedly, waving a hand and shutting the door behind him as a chair slides to the other side of the desk. He approaches and sits down, hands in his lap.
“Exactly.”
“I…I do appreciate the respect that you’ve shown me so far. It’s admirable that you would treat one of your peers that way without much precedent.”
He groans, his free hand going to his hair.
“You’re serious?” Harry says, and he makes a point to smooth over his tone; Leon hasn’t done anything wrong.
“And that somehow means none of it happened?”
Harry can feel his temper rising, but would really rather avoid a row considering they’d only just returned. He stands suddenly, Hermione and Ron both gasping quietly.
“I mean, you’re correct,” he says quickly. “I’m not trying to convince you otherwise. I’m just a bit confused. I’m sure you understand.”
“Love is a powerful thing, Harry. I know this isn’t the first time I’ve mentioned to you just how powerful it is. A form of magic in its own right.”
My Patronus? I guess you’ll have to wait and see, Professor Potter.
“Promise you won’t tell anybody?”
he fought off Dorsey’s curse and disarmed Pamela so that…”
Draco glances to the doorway, where Harry stands awkwardly, clutching the Invisibility Cloak.
“Just yesterday. She asked me. I’m not sure if it means anything between us or if she just wants to go to the ball, but…yeah…”
. And Draco thought things couldn’t get worse.
“Well, what’s the point of a fringe if you don’t curl it every morning? I don’t think I can dedicate that kind of time right now.”
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” she says and joins him at the table. Bill whistles from the other room, moving Ron’s trunk from on top of Harry’s to levitate it up the stairs. “This sounds serious, so you get my full attention.” She reaches out and gently caresses his chin.
Leon nods and licks his lips. “Well, you’ve seen yourself naked, right?”
“Draco, I…I miss you,” she says. His stomach lurches when Pansy’s voice breaks. “And I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said a little while back…”
“If everybody else could please step to the edge of the pitch. Watch your heads by the way, easier than sending you up into the stands, though. Alright, positions!”
“Oh, no problem, my boy, my door is always open!” he says, standing up himself. He follows Draco over to the door and opens it for him, another pregnant pause between them. “Glad you’re back this year, Mister Malfoy,” Slughorn says, half through his teeth. Draco simply nods and gives him a small upward twitch of the lips, and with that, he’s gone.
Harry forces a smile, sighs through his nose, and takes a step back. He turns and disappears with a pop, leaving Draco alone in the Potters’ living room, his nerves still on fire from Harry’s body pressed against his, from the cold tile against the back of his neck.
“I suppose. It helps that you’re a good teacher. Did you know that? For years I took Defense and always hated it, but you make it fun somehow. I think you’re a really good teacher, P—Harry…” Draco says, trailing off.
She’s closer to the rear of the room, eyes squeezed shut in laughter. Luna sits serenely across from her.
Leon lets out another sob, falling against Harry’s chest. He rubs the smaller boy’s back.
He nods, sniffling. “I just have a lot to think about.”
“Well,
He reaches out to take her hand, squeezing it. “I know how it looks, but things could be a lot worse. What…what did she tell you?”
“Like you did with me?”
By the end of the class, he has several vials filled with his “Mungo’s-level burn cure,” as Slughorn had called it, which he carefully wraps in cloth and slips into his bag. One of the best parts of being an eight year student is this kind of freedom; they’re allowed to keep most or all of whatever they brew, so long as Slughorn approves. One never knows when one could use a burn ointment.
She hesitates. “We need to talk.”
,” he says with a little more force than intended. “Gods, Draco, I’m sorry,” he says when he sees the aghast look on the blond’s face. “I know you’re just trying to be nice and I’m sort of fucking that up. But it’s like what you said about saving David’s life. I’m just doing what feels right. What anybody would do.”
“I’m sure you get so many people crawling all over you these days, and I don’t want you to think that that’s who I am. I’m grateful for what you’ve done, but I also realize that you’re just trying to get through your education like the rest of us. It must be overwhelming to constantly feel like you have to be on.”
Harry laughs. “Absolutely not. Not after what you just said.”
Draco nods. “A…friend…did me a favor.”
One of the Ravenclaws rolls his eyes at the Slytherin intrusion. Draco thinks his name might be Michael. “The Grey Lady has gone on a bender of sorts. She’s been howling around all day, spouting nonsense about old magic and danger in the castle.”
Harry braces himself. He speaks.
Harry blinks, his eyes stinging. It’s clear that Hermione is having some influence on Ron, more than she ever did when they were just friends. Another part of it is just the fact that all three of them have changed. The world is so different now, and they’re starting to think about their futures. It’s exciting but sad to think that they’re really starting to grow up.
Harry sits, trying to garner the courage to leap off the precipice he’s built himself.
“As I’m sure you’ve realized, there is another layer to this.”
could all be fake and I haven’t even realized? It makes me feel sick. And after what happened with Leon, I don’t think I can do that again. And
He looks between them one last time, shaking his head as he ties the blindfold around his face.
“Which was more than justified.”
“I’m going for a walk,” she finally says, her hands still balled in fists as she stomps out of the compartment, slamming the door shut behind her.
Ginny turns to her, scandalized. “Are you fucking Imperiused right now or something?”
But he’s cemented in place, his knees stuck to the ground.
“You weren’t even playing us.”
Harry groans and falls sideways, bouncing on the mattress. “Yes. And it’s stupid. I’m just writing whatever rubbish I think of.”
Harry stirs beside him but doesn’t awaken. Good. Draco likes this moment, this cross section of forever. Harry asleep, body curved along Draco’s, the only sound in the room his even breathing. How had this happened? Is it some kind of karma? Yes, he’s done plenty of bad, but lately Draco feels that all he’s done is try to prove himself, to prove that he’s changed. Even if nobody else sees it, the very fact that Harry is sleeping against him is conviction enough.
Lying on the floor in front of him are Ron and Hermione. They’re both dead. With the pools of blood expanding around their broken bodies, he knows immediately that life has left their bodies. Skin pale, eyes open. Empty.
He tries to feign nonchalance. “Just making sure he knew this is our time.”
Harry,
The silence is punctuated by the sound of a quill finishing and dotting a sentence.
“Well, how is he supposed to know that?”
Plus, he’s just been made captain of a Quidditch team. The fact that his recent…
He frowns at her. “What do you mean?”
Draco furrows his brow slightly, scratching his head. Although he’s not sure talking to some shrink would be the best investment of his time, he still wonders if it might be worth investigation. He recalls some dark moments from his summer when his thoughts suddenly felt like they weren’t his own, shuddering slightly.
“Minerva, if there’s anything you need—”
“Crushed it!” Ron says triumphantly. “And finally, a subject where not only Hermione is the star student,” he adds, puffing his chest out a bit.
She stares at her plate, pushes her eggs around for a moment, and then sets her fork down with restraint. “Do you want the honest answer, or the easy one?”
Draco is about ready to collapse in his bed and never leave it. He starts toward Ravenclaw Tower when someone grabs his arm and pulls him into a dimly lit hallway, causing him to yelp in surprise.
agree to a big party like this.”
He shrugs and sits. “I wanted to help you all get settled in. Wasn’t expecting to be met with so much juicy information, though.”
dubious. “You want me to sit on your lap?”
Hermione clears her throat. “Ron does have a point, Harry. I mean, I understand that the chances of even
He pulls out the chair on Harry’s other side. “But maybe I would if I had halfway decent furniture.”
three Hogwarts Houses, as well as at least one Beauxbatons student.”
She shakes her head and looks around the room. “Ron saw the both of them a few minutes ago, but they’ve disappeared.”
“Under these circumstances, I could allow a pass for you and your date to come separately, if you’d like. As in, on your own.”
“I just think it might be overwhelming to have all three of us barging in, right?”
“Not a problem. See you around.”
Ginny continues to glower into the fire as Luna and Leon take their leave, as if her gaze could add fuel to it.
. It’s so easy to distance yourself from the past that way, to think,
She sniffs. “I wasn’t at the ball, if that’s what you’re asking. Madam Pomfrey asked if I could stay with her tonight in case anything happened. Good thing I did, I suppose.”
“Believe me, he’ll come running. That’s his whole deal, he’s their
Draco and Harry freeze in place as a deep, distant voice wafts through the manor.
” Draco screams, and the young girl closest to them lifts into the air. Draco yanks his wand backward and she zips across the space, her velocity almost disrupted by the pitch black gravity in the center of the room, but Draco pulls harder. Harry has to jump out of the way as she flies past them; Draco manages to slow her fall and she collapses on the floor. She vomits and begins to cry, and Harry wants to help but there are still students in the hall.
Because Leon is marching down the other end of the corridor, his eyes boring into Harry’s. His glasses might melt from his face from the heat in the other boy’s eyes.
Ginny snickers but Luna doesn’t seem to notice.
Draco frowns. “Blackmail doesn’t really seem your style, Potter.”
, and it almost makes Harry cry again.
Harry pulls away, his lips shiny and glasses slightly askew. “We can handle this.”
He stops outside his old room, knowing his friends are asleep inside, then continues upward, resisting the magnetic force that beckons him back to the way things used to be.
“I’ve made an enormous mess of things, haven’t I?”
, Harry. I conspired to kill the very man who’s now trying to help us, among a myriad of other horrible things.” His veins practically groan under the pressure of blood pounding through them, vision dark at the edges.
surprised.
“So now, put the desks back to the way they were and take out a piece of parchment to compare your results to what’s in your books. As soon as you’re done, you can turn it in to me, and you’re free to go. You won’t be getting out early every time, so don’t get any ideas,” he says, directing this last comment mostly at Ron, whose face falls slightly.
“Clearly.”
“I’d noticed.”
Ignoring the twisting sensation in his stomach, Draco approaches and clears his throat.
Granger huffs and grabs the two boys by their arms. “Let’s just go, then,” she sighs, pulling Potter and Weasley (who graciously displays his middle finger) with her.
“No!” he says, a little louder than he’d meant. She pulls her hand away. “No,” he repeats, more quietly. “It’s just not what I was expecting, that’s all.”
She nods. Her eyes are locked on her hands, folded in her lap.
Hermione sighs. “There’s an exception to the Apparition wards that was put in place shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts,” she explains. “It was designed so that…dead bodies could easily be transported.”
Hands on her hips, Molly heaves a deep sigh. “All right, then. Maybe she’ll be hungry later. Bill, would you help me get some pumpkin juice poured?”
“Hermione—”
“Oh, like how you harbored your father?” Harry says with a pointed look. “We’re not working with the typical rules here, if you hadn’t noticed. Why should we play fair when your father isn’t?”
“Yes.”
real that it makes my stomach hurt. When I take a step back and think about it, it doesn’t make any sense,” Draco says with a breathy laugh, “but maybe that’s the thing about us that makes it work. Like lightning hitting the same tree three times. The odds are impossible, but when it happens it’s undeniable.”
“Can I just be honest with you lot?” Harry asks as he sits on the edge of his desk. Faces around the room darken, eyes that had been elsewhere snap to him.
Harry can’t really explain it himself. Something had shifted in him. He’s not sure when it started, but looking back on his relationship with Ginny, it just feels so out of place. Even thinking about Cho doesn’t make his heart jump the way it used to, the way it did even after the odd falling out they’d had.
She smiles sympathetically. “Now,
Draco grunts and sits up abruptly as a voice carries from the other side of the lake. He exhales and rubs his eyes, annoyed but intrigued. Granger.
Plus, even if Harry did actually swing that way, surely… They’ve had
“Bloody hell, what’s this now?” Ron asks.
“I just don’t understand,” Harry says, deflated. “She’s told me on more than one occasion that she’s over me, over
“You can’t take over a school that doesn’t exist,” Draco says, sparing a glance at the rubble still pouring out of the Great Hall. “I don’t know how you’re doing this, but you have to stop it.”
“Draco?” he whispers, but of course he’s not there. Where would he be? Even the ceiling high above is mirror-clad; Harry throws his head back and looks straight up, the vague shape of his own body just visible through the peachy gloom.
? I’ve been nothing but evil to you for nearly a decade, I…” He stops himself before he really hashes out the extent of his wrongdoing. Maybe another time. “And then you just risk your life, possibly your education, your
“We’re going to start really basic for our first class, just to sort of get into the swing of things. Truthfully,” he says, pausing, considering whether or not he should continue his thought. “It’s going to take me a few classes to get my bearings, to be completely honest with you. As some of you know, I have a little bit of teaching experience, but it’s limited, and those circumstances were a lot different. That was about survival, and this is about… Well, ultimately, it’s still about survival, I suppose.” He pauses again, aware that he’s rambling.
Hermione huffs. "How many times have I told you, Apparating onto the grounds at Hogwarts is impossible. Someday I really am going to sit you two down and force you to read
“Would the same day and time work for you? Right in this room?”
“Very good. If I may, I recommend that you speak to Hermione Granger if you want more guidance on the subject.”
“Not by anybody in
Harry stops him with a kiss of his own, on the mouth this time. Leon tastes like peach and mint and summer nights sitting on a porch.
“Bullshit.”
“Yes,” Leon says, pausing, “but in different ways, I suppose. Beauxbatons has a more modern, minimalist beauty to it. But this castle… Well, I already know that recently it’s been through quite a lot, but I can just
“I’m wondering the same thing,” Harry says, approaching frustration.
Part of me wants to just take off running with you and not look back. Another part is so scared. I know rushing things like this that are so new can be the death of them, and I want to give us a fair shot. I also know you still probably need some space to think. I’m aware of all of these things, and yet I can’t stop thinking about what comes next. Things have still been sort of bleak since the war, and you make me feel like maybe that phase of things is coming to a close. I don’t know. Half of this letter is just me rambling. It’s very unlike me to have so many words fighting to present themselves to someone else.
“Salves are for external use,” McGonagall shouts.
The rest of the meeting passes with awkward gaps in speech and stilted small talk. Before he leaves, Slughorn reminds Draco to keep his head low and Draco once again confirms that he’s serious about Healing. Though terrified to walk the hallways now that the (false) news about his father has had time to spread, he has no choice but to brave the potential danger in order to return to his room. If Blaise is there, Draco might ask him to bring him some food. Showing face in the Great Hall is a death sentence right now.
Harry blinks down at the passage, trying to comprehend the information. “I’m not sure I fully understand.”
“No, you’re free to go. Please just inform me as soon as you make your decision, whatever it may be. Oh! One more thing,” she says and Harry halts. “I do hope you’ll continue with Quidditch, even with the new structure.”
as a Hogwarts Professor raises the temperature of Draco’s blood. Not by a lot, but enough that he’s huffing in annoyance by the time he deposits himself onto a bench at the Slytherin table, which is currently populated mostly by Beauxbatons students.
She looks around, the same dreamy look on her face that he’s accustomed to.
He grins. “Right. I suppose I did sort of force people to start using the name. Or at least get used to it.”
Draco frowns, his earlier pang of guilt flaring up again. “For what?”
Harry’s stomach turns in on itself. “I—no, it’s not a
Harry sighs, nodding, because Ron is correct in that it is, in fact,
Harry blinks, then frowns. “He…What are you talking about?”
“I need you to know how incredible it is, what you did,” Hermione says, her voice small.
“But then…you knew…?”
“Oh, Harry…”
really get over. Don’t you get it? I know it’s hard to see it from the inside, but…there is
. McGonagall catches Harry’s gaze from across the room and gestures for him to come. He doesn’t have time for this, he needs to get back to Leon, to figure out what they’re going to do. He pushes through the crowd and realizes that the worst case scenario is that they just don’t go, but for once, there’s no part of him that wants that.
Harry is slightly shocked when Ginny gives him a quick hug as she joins the group, grinning like mad. “I’m so relieved,” she admits before greeting all of the other players. Harry also shakes everybody’s hand quickly as Madam Hooch starts to list off the third team. He hears Dean Thomas’ name, and then Demelza Robins. Good Gryffindor showing, for sure. Everybody is a bit shocked to hear that a Beauxbatons student named Beau Lux—a Keeper—is to be captain of this team. Not only that, but everybody else on the team is a Hogwarts student.
“What do you mean?”
Leon’s ears flush. Harry is grateful that he’s not alone in feeling flustered. “I’m happy you were able to come to terms with that. Because when you turned me down, I thought I was a complete idiot and that I scared you off. And now…”
Leon’s reaction when he finally notices Harry makes his chest expand and his fingers buzz. He’s in the middle of a sentence and stops talking entirely, his eyes softening out and his lips curling into a tender smile.
“That’s the only theory I have,” McGonagall confirms. “The exception to the ward isn’t horribly specific, and because he technically ceased to fit the ‘living’ category for a brief period of time, I have to imagine that this somehow allowed Draco to bypass it.”
“Oh, no, no! I just..” he sighs. “You know what? Never mind, I’m sorry, I’ll just—”
Weasley laughs again. Draco wrinkles his nose.
heard some whisperings. Something about a rogue statue and someone out of bed after hours?”
ended his life in the most literal sense?
“I assume you’re referring to the news in the
“Like…the order of how everything happened?”
“I’ll just be a couple more minutes,” Harry murmurs. Leon hums his acknowledgment, the vibration of it resonating in Harry’s body.
The Hall is gorgeous, tables adorned with pumpkins and root vegetables, the smell of fall in the air. Most impressive are the enchanted trees around the room’s perimeter that occasionally drop beautiful leaves, vivid reds and oranges that collect in neat piles. The ceiling is a clear, navy sky, the stars practically dancing along to the music. Gryffindor is the last House to arrive (Harry supposes his personal drama is to thank for that) and it seems the event is about to hop into full swing. Everybody else has already pushed past the awkward phase in the beginning when nobody wants to dance yet so the floor is crowded and lively. The band—the Death Pixies—is playing something peppy and vaguely familiar, but Harry doesn’t listen to enough Wizard music to really be sure.
She knows that it can’t be everything. For a moment Harry is offended. Does she think that seeing her and Ron dead wouldn’t be enough to block any good memories for Harry? But no. It’s less about the contents of the story and more about the state of the teller. He’s never quite been able to lie to her.
“Skills they
Harry looks at Ron, who grumbles something about being down in a minute and follows after Hermione.
“I thought that was figured out, though!” Ron looks down, suddenly interested in something on the ground. “I was...sort of under the impression that we were all going to be Aurors together,” he mumbles, his face going red.
“But she only means well.”
Selfishly, Draco wishes Ron and Hermione would beat it. He’s feeling much better now and with Harry grinning at him from two feet away, hair still tousled from sleep, all he wants to do is kiss him and never come up for air.
Leon waves a hand at him, chuckling. “This Fat Lady seems like quite the character, but I think I will like her.”
He’s afraid to step into that light, because once he does, everybody on the other side of the window will see him for who he really is. In order to truly bask in the glow, that truthful radiance that Leon turned his head toward—the same radiance that resides in Leon’s skull in the form of his amber eyes—Harry has to take the step forward.
He tries to dissect her tone, but if there’s one thing his mother is good at, it’s forced neutrality.
“He is quite cute,” Ginny says, finally thawing out a bit. “It’s going to take some time for me to fully adjust. But I can tell you two are happy together. And I do appreciate you trusting me with this. So, you really are gay? Fully?”
of the answers. Nor do you have to slap a label on yourself. Not now, and not ever, really.”
,” she says, covering her mouth with a hand and lipping the last two words.
“Er…You’re right, actually.” Aside from being one of the only privy to the evil castle conspiracy, Harry’s status as Head Boy hasn’t changed much about how he exists within the walls of Hogwarts. “Luna, has McGonagall told you about…what’s going on?” He gestures vaguely around himself.
hurt. I…I’ve got you. I promise.”
“Like death.”
Blaise shrugs. “Will it hinder my ability to eat?’
“Really. And she has a partner who is absolutely incredible, and the two of them are very happy together, from what I understand. So the whole concept of homosexuality is just not something so novel and life-altering for me. But I can tell that it’s really shaken you up, because the realization happened so quickly. I just want you to know that I’m not trying to undermine your feelings, and I don’t want it to seem like I don’t care. Because I do.”
Molly squeezes between Ron and Hermione with a large tray of steaming food, bopping Ron on the head as she does. “I don’t know where you got this idea that I’m some raging, emotional psychopath. I was shocked at first, I’ll admit, but Harry explained everything very concisely and brought me up to speed. If Harry says Draco is innocent, he’s innocent.”
Because just like that, her friend is gone. Disappeared. Almost like she merged with the shadow, or it somehow took her away. Either way, she’s disappeared.
Harry winces as the cloth is removed and light hits his face, causing him to blink rapidly. Once he’s adjusted, his heart stops.
Draco laughs through his nose. It’s fascinating, how different they are. Maybe deep down, not so much, but there are so many basic facets of their lives that just don’t line up. All Draco has to return to is the Manor, large, empty. He’s expressed some not-so-respectful opinions about the Weasley home in the past, but right now, a cozy, chaotic home is enviable.
body.”
kind of look, but he can’t quite figure out what it is.
He groans, following Ron’s lead and laying back, his arms behind his head. “I think I’ve had enough surprises for a lifetime, honestly.”
“I’m sure that’s true, but I don’t think I want that.”
Mari presses her lips together.
die, actually. I had to kill him to save him.”
. “I don’t know! I just never imagined myself doing that for a living.”
“That’s true.”
“Are you aware that there was a staff meeting this afternoon?”
“It certainly sounds that way.”
Potter chuckles and Granger exclaims, “Ronald!”
Luna blinks at him. “I don’t, no.”
“Well, here we are,” Harry says when they get to the door. He gives Draco his bag and steps back, looking at the ground. “Thanks again for what you did today. I know it may just seem like it was the right thing to do, but I know some people would’ve frozen up, or made a different choice, or… Well, you get the point. It was brave and admirable.”
“Right. Perfect. So you’ll, er, need to come see me again at some point in order to talk about career goals. Required by the Headmistress herself. No rush, of course. Well, it has to be before the end of the term so we can adjust schedules for your last one, but other than that…” He trails off.
Harry’s eyes narrow, then widen. “Oh. You mean about…”
This does
He has to contain a groan when there’s a knock on the door. “Come in,” he grumbles.
“It’s no trouble at all, Harry, please!”
“Hello,” Luna says casually. Harry fights a chuckle as McGonagall realizes their presence.
Molly frowns, but lets him continue.
She looks at him quizzically. “I ran into him after your class today and we got to talking about some things—”
Harry stands again, not as quickly. “We need to find him first. There has to be something we can do to get him out of this.”
They walk in silence for a second, Harry unsure of how to respond.
“Well, this breakfast isn’t going to make itself!” Molly says and jumps out of her seat. She shoos Bill away from the eggs and sausage; he resumes his position with his feet up on another chair.
they dislike you because they aren’t able to think the same way.”
“Good. I rather like him too, so it seems he’s here to stay.”
“Sure thing,” he says, his eyes trained on the ground.
Harry shrugs. “We can’t be students anymore. That’s the logical next step.”
Hermione and Ron both stare at him for a second. Hermione sighs.
“No, yeah, of course, what is it?”
“But what if it is?”
Draco sits for a moment, stunned. Healing? Why?
I am a few hours late, but technically it's a Thursday until I go to bed, so I'm more or less keeping my promise! Either way, two chapters in two weeks? Very unlike me!
The entire party gasps as Hermione sits up, rubbing her eyes. Ron almost trips as he launches himself out of his chair and throws his arms around her. Draco stands back as Ginny follows suit, and McGonagall also stands to be closer to her.
“For me as well,” Draco says.
“It’s a bit comical to see you so flummoxed by this,” Draco says, “considering you’ve just spent half a Hogwarts term already working as a professor.”
Harry snaps his head around, looks at Draco, and looks at Leon’s hand tangled in his. “Oh, it’s okay. Draco already knows.”
The library is where he finds himself and he enters his body once more at the realization of his new location. He sees his target, face buried in a large, leather-bound book at her favorite table. It’s tucked away in a corner near a window, but Harry can see through vacancies on shelves.
“No worries. Er, so, we were just wondering what exactly you’d like us to do at this point,” Harry says.
He tilts his head, asking for an explanation.
“Exactly,” Harry says; his eyelashes flutter and his lids slide shut. Draco tilts upward and plants a kiss on Harry’s forehead, lips brushing the bolt splayed across the smooth skin.
“I really had myself convinced that you weren’t gay,” Leon says as he shakes his head. “When we started getting to know each other, I could tell that there was
Her posture hasn’t changed, all of her limbs still crossed in front of her defensively, but her face goes through what can only be described as a journey of emotions; they range from shock to blind rage. “This is a
The last few students pile their parchment on top of the pile on their way out.
“Come on Mister Malfoy, up front, we don’t have all day!”
“Right.”
“It’s Ginny,” he says, thinking of Mrs. Weasley’s face, of Ron, of what their family has already been through. “We’re not having this argument. I’m getting her the fuck out of there.” Not two seconds later his broom hits his hand and he swings a leg over it. Before he can kick off, Draco grabs his arm.
, I wasn’t sure what to expect when we met, and you completely blew me away.”
—whether it be about this, or, I don’t know, just anything—you can come to me to talk about it.”
At the end of this row is his father. Lucius shakes his head, a smile on his face. Draco’s already pounding heart slams his ribcage, his pulse prominent in his neck. He tries to swallow down the fear, but his mouth is too dry and it feels like the room is heating up and Lucius is raising his wand, he’s
“Fine. Yours?”
He hasn’t told anyone yet, but Draco is fairly sure he’s been Apparating himself in his sleep to his favorite spot next to the lake. Yes, he’s well aware of the fact that one should be unable to Apparate himself
She shakes her head. “No, no, nothing bad.” She pauses. “There’s no easy way to ask this, so I’m just going to come out and say it. I’m interested in offering you the Defense Against the Dark Arts position.”
“I know the damn incantation!” Ron says. “Saved the fucking world with you and you think I don’t know a shield charm,” he mutters under his breath.
Several flights of stairs later, the trio stands in front of the Room of Requirement, Barnabas the Barmy napping loudly behind them.
“Oh.” His mouth has gone dry.
Harry looks back to Hermione, whose eyes are wide with recognition. She nods gravely. Ron looks between them and scratches his head, still a few steps behind, missing crucial information.
“As much as I’d love for us all to sit and chat, I’m going to be a bit rude and request that I speak with Harry privately. Minerva, perhaps you can take Ron and Hermione down to the kitchens for some tea?”
The voice cuts through him, restarts his heart. He never even realized it had stopped.
this morning? You’re not in any trouble with me, if that’s what you mean. Externally…well, I can’t say for sure. But let’s come back to that, shall we? There’s something else I would like to ask you first. About your future.”
is enough to warrant making a career. But the fact that it’s something you actually find pleasure in doing makes it fairly clear from my perspective.”
Ron scowls as his mother turns around to finish up with some toast. “Harry, could you also tell her that my room needs new furniture? Maybe she’ll believe it coming from you.”
“Let’s hear it,” says Ron.
“I understand. We’re doing everything in our power, monitoring the post, the Floo Network—we’ve even resorted to looking iron some Muggle methods of communication. There’s been nothing so far. If your son is communicating with anybody, he’s found a very clever way to do it.”
Somehow, despite his overactive mind and every nerve in his body screaming, he manages to drift off to sleep again.
Leon nods. “It’s not that I’m not eager to start learning things the Hogwarts way, I just—”
“All right, Harry. That’s enough playing hero. It’s time to let the adults handle things, now.”
“Could it be that you’re afraid of your Patronus?”
Draco shakes his head. “No, no, I can’t
Draco exhales, smoothing his hand over his hair habitually. It’s grown far too long for his liking, but the last time he’d tried to cut it himself was a disaster, and he felt silly going to his mother as a grown man to ask if she could cut his hair. And going out into public was simply
“So there
“Not that we know of,” Harry says, not sure if he should feel proud or just lucky that nobody had been hurt.
be happening now. But I
“Right, your friends.” Draco looks around. Harry notices that not even Blaise stuck around.
“I was just washing up and I must not have been careful enough at the sink.”
be so important—”
“Saving the world wasn’t a good direction?”
Slughorn nods again. “Top notch so far,” he says, ambling off to check on others.
Next to her: Leon. His eyes catch the warmth of the fire and refract it, glinting as he laughs at something Ron says. He’s in the classic Beauxbatons powder blue, a slim-cut coat with a short cape around his shoulders, adorned with darker blue detailing. A matching blue hat is perched on his head, blond curls spilling out under the brim. Harry isn’t sure if he wants to stop moving entirely or sprint over to Leon and yank him off his feet, spin him around. He does something in between, picks up his pace just slightly, relishing in the way his robes move around him as he crosses the room.
Draco exhales, a breath of realization. “I hadn’t even thought of it like that. I mean, we wouldn’t have to tell her
Harry shrugs, knot in his stomach tightening for the thousandth time this morning. “‘Excited’ isn’t the word I would use. Maybe not even ‘ready.’”
The beanbag chair materializes beneath him as he slumps down into it. He scrubs both hands over his face, taking a deep breath in and then letting it all out in a vocal representation of his jumbled emotions.
“Seeing you so in your element somehow allowed me to look past all of the bad blood between us. It’s obvious you’re passionate about it and you have the necessary skillset. Plus, it would be a way to arm future generations of witches and wizards against danger without ever putting your life directly on the line. So yes, it does seem obvious to me. You’re quite good at it, too. And I wouldn’t just say that.”
“No, the bit after that.”
Draco shakes his head. “I think that’s everything, actually.”
“And what if that’s how I
She winces in sympathy when she sees the welts, then tsks and shakes her head. “I’m not going to be able to treat this here, not with the condition this bad,” she says. “Darling, can you walk?”
It blows.
,” he says, lowering his voice but still punching the word with venom.
Draco stops outside the door. He could wait right there and go right in once the class lets out. But the idea of being seen waiting to do anything involving Harry feels like a lot at the moment. Plus, he can’t seem
“Clearly you’ve had a change of heart.”
“Congratulations, you two!” comes Hermione’s voice from behind him. She hugs Ginny and gives Ron a big kiss.
“Yes. I also think so.” Her eyes light up when she sees another younger girl from Beauxbatons “Oh, Marie!
A ripple of murmuring shoots through the classroom. Harry sees a hand shoot up and points toward it, Ernie Macmillan’s voice cutting through the air. “Isn’t that what you used to defeat, well, you know…” he says, trailing off when he realizes all attention is on him.
Ron grumbles something like ‘but I’m still the better Keeper’ as Harry turns back to Leon, sighing. “Sorry about that. I wish I could say that this isn’t a regular thing, but I guess sibling rivalry is bound to happen when you’re so close in age.” He’s not sure if it’s a trick of the light, but it almost looks like Leon’s eyes are glassy. “So what were you saying?”
Draco clutches his pillow closer to his chest. After being denied, he came right back to his room, put on pajamas, and crawled into bed. Cried a bit. That’s been happening a lot recently. Now, he’s considering going to bed. Yes, it’s still only early in the evening yet, but he’s certain he could sleep forty-eight hours straight at this point.
“I’m sure you remember the debacle from many years ago regarding the so-called Chamber of Secrets?”
He whips around to find Mari, a curious and amused smile on her face. “Didn’t mean to frighten you, sorry about that!”
Leon looks at the ground. “Well, yes. Of course I’d heard rumors about you. I never allowed myself to form any real defined opinion on you, but based on certain facts that I knew I suppose I made some assumptions anyway.”
He goes for the door and against his better judgement, Draco swiftly follows and physically turns Harry around. He grabs both of his wrists and pleads, “Wait, please, you have to believe me—”
Leon nods, smiling. “It seems that way. I’ll leave you for now to enjoy your meal, but if it’s not too much to ask, could we meet once the feast is over? I just have some things to ask and information to share.”
“Where are you going?”
“Mothers, I suppose,” Harry says. He looks so perfect by the fire, afternoon glow slanting in through a nearby window. Harry burns golden, an entire spectrum of light performing against his skin. “You know, it’s really quite lovely in here.”
They both cringe as someone on the other side of the bookshelf shushes them. Hermione’s cheeks darken.
“I wasn’t lying when I said that I know him personally.”
Apologies.
If he’s honest, he’s not really sure himself how he feels about his House status. It affiliates him with such vile people, even though the bulk of the evil is either past or simply elsewhere.
Which leads me into my next point. I could be wrong, but I definitely feel like the quality of this chapter surpasses all of the ones prior. I really, REALLY meticulously wrote this one. I think in the past I've seen fanfic as just something fun that I enjoy, but I've recently come to understand just how useful it can be for real-life application (but it's definitely fun for me still don't worry!!). Which means I can experiment with things! I'm in the process of prepping to write my first ever novel and my goal is for the prose in it to be sort of flowery and very purple in the way it is in this chapter. Some people might say it's over-written...and maybe it is to a certain extent?
She gapes at him as her head swivels side to side in shock. “Who are you?”
“But didn’t you consider that I have my own education to complete still? Or that this is an insane idea?”
risk everything?”
Harry huffs and takes a step toward him. “Don’t be so dramatic. It’s a hard spell.” He pauses. “Draco, could it be…”
“The dream’s back?”
“Harry, it makes me a bit sad that all of this is news to you,” she says, grabbing his hand again.
“Even if the emotions aren’t technically coming from you, if
He almost breaks his neck with how fast he turns it toward the door, his mother looking at him as if he’s dead. Which. Well.
“And…what of me?” Narcissa asks, rather tense.
“Besides,” Hermione grumbles, “by the time I’d decided I was going to do it, you’d already gone off with that boy from Beauxbatons.”
“Luna, would you like to go for a walk?” Leon says cheerfully as he stands. “There are a couple of things we should probably discuss regarding the situation in the castle.”
He looks at her skeptically. “You were there, too!”
Unsurprisingly, most of the Beauxbatons attendance takes residence at the Slytherin table, as there aren’t a great deal of vacant seats elsewhere. In the slight chaos, Draco notices an older looking boy—a bit short and lean, with blonde wavy hair—approaching McGonagall and starting an animated conversation, in which she points in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Intrigued, Draco follows her gesture and sees Potter and his friends speaking with one of the Beauxbatons girls. She looks vaguely familiar but Draco can’t put his finger on why.
His insides twist. She doesn’t
But out of pure desperation, he’s able to at least produce a floating silver ball. It illuminates the corridor around him and he almost screams when he realizes his own blood is pouring from the places where his remaining skin makes contact with the cursed stone around him. His whole body is shaking. At some point between casting and this moment, he’d dropped his wand, and he sees that it’s rolled a few feet away as his half-Patronus jets down the hall.
“Y-yeah, I know.” Harry couldn’t help but notice how the sunlight reflected on Malfoy’s white hair, turning it almost golden. Harry recomposed himself, “Well, Malfoy, serves you right for trying to copy me. Now we’re both stuck here for the next two weeks.”
“Then I suppose helping me sneak out of the castle isn’t a good way to avoid that.”
“My father puts the land as priority over everything else. I know you weren’t here when the last battle finished, but it was devastating. But it was over, their head knight was killed. My father is just making sure it’s not happening again.”
After his rehearsals for the ball, Draco slumps back onto his bed, hot and sweaty.
“Harry, I want to- I want to-“ Draco tried to say, but they turned into silent sobs. He watched as Harry walked away, knocking into Pansy as he left.
“Don’t worry, I made Adelaide tell your parents you were ill.”
“Of course you weren’t.”
The halls were empty as he was running and running and running.
Hey there, Reader!
“Yes, father.”
Draco didn’t realise Harry was talking, he was too caught up on that stare, no, more like gaze on his face. He didn’t seem to mind, though. Ever since their adventure yesterday, Draco feels comfortable in Harry’s presence.
“Yes...?” Harry asked, nervous.
Harry settled in his bed, putting his pyjama shirt and trousers back on. Much to Draco’s dismay.
The early morning light filters through the stained glass window, leaving splotches of colour dotted over the dark wooden pews. It’s a beautiful place to sit in, but he’s not as devotedly christian as his parents are.
He tries to hide an excited smile behind a cool mask but it’s not working. Curse this man.
“Hm?” He murmurs back, sated and relaxed.
Harry smiled and nods, and goes back to eating his food.
Draco saw a few Knights dotted around as he travelled to a large cluster of trees, but he decided to swiftly move past to avoid suspicion.
They go backwards and forwards, Harry lifting his sword and slashing it sideways and the other man defending himself by holding his sword outwards.
Draco can’t breathe.
Harry lifts his head up, a small smile on his lips. He stares for a bit too long at Draco’s face, and his mouth changes into a cringe.
“I hadn’t realised it affected you that much. I thought you liked the attention.” Draco said defensively, sinking back into his chair.
“Do you need a formal invitation?” Draco asks after Harry doesn’t proceed.
“What’s true?” Harry questioned. Draco’s face was serious and brutal.
Ron turned to face Harry. “What is he talking about, Harry?” He questioned, panting.
He’s glad Harry’s here, now.
The corridor around them had disappeared, and they were both in their own world. Together.
“Potions.” Draco said blankly.
“He’s alright-“ Adelaide says but Draco interrupts.
It’s the first time Harry’s properly been in his room, the only other time when Harry was half conscious and bleeding from the hip.
It’s childish, but as soon as Celeste turns away to walk back, he wipes his mouth on his sleeve, rubbing away the strange taste.
Draco scowls, pouting.
A quill on parchment. A letter, addressed to Celeste Holloway.
“Draco?” Harry asks, dragging his bare feet through the shallow water. He’s utterly mad for paddling around in this weather. The dishwater grey ocean swathes around Harry, the level nearly reaching his cuffed trousers.
It happened all too quickly for Draco to hug him back, so he just stood there stiffly.
“She’s beautiful.”
“We’re friends now.”
“I’d like that very much,” He says between little pecks, “but I think people would notice if the main focus of the night had disappeared.”
“You better wash that off before it bonds to you.” Draco says to Harry, indicating his chest. Harry laughs and nods, climbing off the bed and throwing whatever clothes there are lying on the floor onto himself.
“Yeah, yes I know.” He admits, rolling off of Harry and slithering up to his pillow. He doesn’t say anything, but he’s certain they both know, and a couple of seconds later, Harry has sidled up beside him, his face inches from his own.
Draco’s eyes drift closed.
“Potter.” A voice whispered.
And Draco does, letting tree branches thwack them and tossing his head back in the wind. Harry loses his grip on the saddle, and ends up with his hands firmly placed on Draco’s hips. Draco woops and Harry barks with laughter.
Enjoy!
He thought he did. Even though their friendship was sudden and weird, Harry thought that Draco could trust him. Would trust him. But what does trust mean anymore? Harry has to now trust Draco with his biggest secret, one that he has to keep from everyone, including his best friends. Would he have told Draco anyway? Would their friendship have progressed in that way?
“Oh, that’s awful.” Harry laughs more, trying to wipe away tears. “I’m always full of surprises.” He concedes.
“Cedric Diggory.” Dumbledore announced. Harry stood up, shouting Cedric’s name along with his friends. He smiled and sat down, sighing to his friends in elation for Cedric and the rest of the competitors.
“Don’t pretend you don’t know. He worships you. Saviour Potter, and all that.”
Her lips are so different from Harry’s, unfamiliar and cold. He doesn’t like it a bit.
Harry’s going deeper, easing Draco onto his fingers, and it gets less painful. Draco is speaking profanity’s right into Harry’s face, and Harry just smirks and jerks his body alongside his fingers, making Draco arch up off the bed.
“Right, you’re dismissed.” Lucius says sharply.
“And just the pain of it all. It meant to feel good to take down their head knight but all I felt was cold. I was numb.”
“I don’t think you do.”
Draco doesn’t say anything to that, just kisses him. Harry puts his arms on either side of Draco’s head and kisses back.
“Fine.” Harry forces a smile. He’s not angry, Draco knows, but there’s something about him that’s sharp and intimidating today.
“You remember?”
“It’s so heavy.” He groans, leaning his face close to Draco’s. “I was hoping I would be back in my room soon, in the warmth and out of this.” He says, trying to be stern but his wide smile giving him away.
December 17th, three days before the ball:
“I can go for you.”
Draco looks at where the sound comes from, and finds Harry standing behind the dining hall’s doors with two swords in his hands.
“Just outside.” He smiles as reassuringly as possible, and squeezes her hand. “I shan’t be long.”
He pulled his body back and Juliet stopped in a heartbeat. The sudden change in speed had left Draco breathless. He choked in a cough but it broke through. His body was shaking in need for air, and as the warm air filled his lungs, his eyes began to blink. Began to feign off tears that began to well. Draco yelled in frustration, but if turned into a loud sob. Draco leaned his head into the crook of his elbow, and bit his lip, trying to hold back another sob. It just kept coming though. Everything was dark and fuzzy. His tears dripped down his pointy nose and splatted onto the saddle that he sat on. He let out a shaky breath and tried to stop the tears. He breathed once again, filling himself with air. Grounding himself. He blinked and blinked and blinked before one last teardrop left his swollen eyes. The sound of the crashing waves returned, and Draco headed back, his head held low.
“You’re wrong, Adelaide.” Draco says, mumbling it into his damp bedsheet. His voice wavers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you doing in there?” He asks hesitantly once he’s just at the waters edge.
“Wanted to stay with you.” He says quietly, suppressing another yawn.
“Mocking me isn’t the same as teasing me.” Draco says, not knowing why his mouth is still moving and words are still coming out when he just wants Harry to-
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He tries to say, ‘I understand Harry. I get it.’ But he doesn’t. He doesn’t understand because he wants to feel it. Wants to know what it’s like, to be loved.
“We changed it. If Draco lost once out of five games then you’d pay up.”
“Hey!” Draco growled loudly over the sound of Harry’s chuckles. He tugged the hood back so that it rested on his head and shot a deathly glare towards Harry.
‘Dearest Celeste,’ Draco scrawls, his hand-writing curved and perfectly balanced.
He pulls the hood of the cloak further down his face, and darts across the connecting pathways to get to the stables.
“Is that the reason why you were sneaking out?”
Harry lifts the present and measures it up, and then shoots a quizzical brow at Draco.
Draco watches as the fish dart around. Watches as the water ripples. Watches as the forest animals hunt for food. He pulls his leather boots off in a huff, letting his feet feel the moss that surrounds the lake. It wasn’t particularly large, Draco could see the outline of the trees on the other side of the lake. On that side there was a small dock with a mouldy rowing boat sitting next to it. Draco had tried and failed at using the boat, and came home with his hair soaking wet and lake weeds between his toes. There was a tiny alcove in the corner of the lake, surrounded by trees giving the area shade and large rocks that he can lean on.
“I have! I go to... somewhere that doesn’t concern you. I’m not a goody two shoes, Harry. I don’t always submit to the needs of the King.”
Draco picked up the spoon he was using from his bowl, showing to Harry that ‘this is the right spoon, you pillock’ and ‘it’s the one that isn’t the size of my fucking palm.’
“It’s not too bad.” Harry grins.
The trees opened into the mossy clearing, and then they could see the expanse of the glimmering lake.
Draco’s tailor was the opposite of Pierre, the castle’s portrait artist. Instead of being eccentric and excitable, Sebastian was stoic and tight-lipped. He took his job far too seriously, but did it with such speed that Draco
“One of the townspeople that looked after me was friends with Ron’s mother, and so we saw each other often. Hermione was local to the workshop and she visited almost everyday. Ron and I had thought that she just had an interest in wielding, but now we know it was because she was in love with him.” Harry said, earning a chuckle from Ron and an exasperated gasp from Hermione.
Ron and Hermione’s mouths both dropped, their eyes widening at the black drawstring bag.
Draco now felt kind of bad, making it seem like he was just so much better because he was so much richer. He began to frown, and he turned to Harry, who was smiling at him. Maybe money never made anyone happy. Ron and Hermione and the rest of them seemed to be doing fine by just simply sticking together. Draco smiled faintly back at Harry, and then turned to look at the two stricken people.
“Are you sure it’s a good idea for you to lead?” He asks teasingly.
He kisses harder.
“Why are you here?” Harry asked, knowing it had to do with Malfoy’s obvious obsession with Harry.
“Please don’t be my Father.” Draco whispers, trying to hold back another flow of tears.
“We do, yes. I’d call him one of my closest friends.”
“There you go! Your crowns all polished, too. It would be a waste of my hard work if it wasn’t put to use.” She pouted.
Draco looks down.
“I am sweaty, my heart is going a million miles per hour and I could quite literally eat a horse right now.”
“Well you should be thanking me. I saw you leave. I could have told your father.” Harry smiled and shrugged innocently.
He slept contentedly with the knowledge that Harry was safe.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat as soon as his nightmare ended. “Fuck.” He sighed, moving his dripping hair that was stuck on his face. When this normally happened, Harry would go for a shower and walk to the quidditch pitch. But that was how he got injured in the first place. And he couldn’t go now.
He presses his face deeply into the bed.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting that.” Monty says on an exhale.
Draco is beyond angry. He never thought he could hate his father more, and yet here he is. He feels sick at the word ‘worthless’, being called that multiple time by the man himself and knowing how it felt. His father would never see anyone equal to him, he always had to be the best.
Harry hesitates.
“Then come with me.” said Harry with his smirk returning.
Preview:
Harry waited until Draco said something, knowing it was coming at the way Draco sighed and opened his mouth as about to speak.
The chain links that hold the swing are ice cold under Draco’s hands but he hardly minds. All he can focus on is Harry slowly kissing his way down his neck. It’s like nothing he has felt before, and he suddenly feels surprisingly warm amidst the chill of the winter air.
“And it’s a shame that you will never get to choose who you will love.”
He could probably drag himself to his bedroom, but the thought of Harry still being in there sends something alarming through his body. His memory of last night comes back in bits and pieces, and now he’s stuck.
Sebastian is shaking his head at an invisible fault and stepping around Draco’s wooden stand to grab his tape measure. It’s taking all that’s in him to try not to stumble and sway. He’s so easily persuaded...
Draco would never joke about it.
“Did it mean something to you?” Harry blurted out, unable to keep quiet anymore. He needed to know, for his own sanity.
“Oh come on, Ada.” He smiles, lacing up the boots. Although Adelaide was his maid, Draco treated her like a best friend. Adelaide was Draco’s honorary mother when Draco’s own had other duties to attend to. Although Lucius had disagreed with Draco’s mannerisms towards Adelaide, he never did anything about it, just letting her do as she pleases as long as she kept Draco alive. Draco learnt a lot from Adelaide, more than he had from his parents combined. She was there when he needed to talk to someone, which was something Draco was raised to never do. ‘No talking about you feelings. No showing empathy. Absolutely no emotions to be shown in-front of anyone. You are a Royal Prince, and you must act like one.’ Draco can hear clearly in his mind. Remembered the first time he was in trouble for stepping out of the guidelines. He had known Adelaide for nearly 11 years, and he doesn’t know what he would be doing now if she weren’t in his life.
Draco sinks slowly onto Harry, the tight heat back again, but it slowly dissipates into bliss. Harry’s guiding him by his waist, lowering him down and lifting himself up, hitting Draco in a spot which rips a moan out of him.
“Right, Mr Malfoy” Pomfrey sighed “Two weeks you will be spending here because of your foolish actions. You’ll have to get a friend to bring you classwork and you will  need to take this medication every hour.”
(ps please let me know if you’ve enjoyed this fic, I love hearing your feedback!)
“I don’t see how that’s a problem. Me and Adelaide are best friends.
He folded up the letter and placed it in one of the drawers, so that no one would be able to see it. One last letter sat in his hands, the paper surrounding it worn out and dirty.
“Yes. Irrelevant.”
“Where? Is if the announcement for the tournament?” Harry asked, walking over to where Draco was standing by the door.
“I heard him shout at you and the other knights earlier. And what was that about an invitation? Surely he’d want you there?” He asks with an irate tone.
After five minutes, Draco finally snaps. “What is it, Harry?”
Draco feels much better. He supposes there’s no making this go away, no amount of therapy from Adelaide would change reality.
“Okay, and? We have a swordsmith in the south wing.” Draco replied, his eyes narrowing in slight confusion.
“I’m sure they’d find you before the ball starts.” Harry says, giving him a grimaced smile.
“We’ve got to get back.” Harry said, standing up from his place.
Harry didn’t reply, he only grunted. He definitely was not a morning person.
“Well maybe you should ask Harry how he feels about me being here? Or do you not trust him, seeing as he doesn’t tell you anything.” Draco raised his eyebrow, and shot a menacing look at Harry.
Draco opens a drawstring bag and pulls out bandages, cloths and a selection of different salves. He sucks in his breath as he moves closer to Harry. His hip was still slightly covered by his tunic and so he delicately tries to pull it up, avoiding any physical contact.
(and p.s please let me know if you like it by leaving a comment. I’m also happy to explain anything that’s going on that may confuse you. Like the time this is set etc...)
Draco gets to his chair just as the trumpet fanfare starts. He and his mother are sat in a special box, overlooking the battling area and all the spectators. There’s a sea of colour, and people who look positively wealthy. Draco can just make out the bright red head of hair and the bushy brown one next it, standing far behind the crowds on the lowest level.
“Yeah...God Harry- Yes.” Draco says, throat constricting as Harry’s hand applies more
“Well...I....” He stumbles, not knowing how to get it out. He knows the answer.
The walk was silent, the only sound being the breaking twigs and the rustle of leaves. The small path lined with trees opened up to a large beach, where the moon reflected brightly on the calm water.
He swallows thickly,
“Absolutely.” She grins, allowing him to twirl her to the middle.
Draco doesn’t pay attention though, as he sees Harry turn, and green eyes meet grey. Harry’s face is chiselled and tanned, and his teeth a bright white beam. His muscular arms fill out his cream dress shirt and as he stands up, he is a good 3 inches taller than Draco.
As soon as he steps in, Celeste pulls him off to the side and talks and talks and talks, only
He has to physically restrain himself from actually writing that, because only he would find it hilarious.
The owner that had just walked through the back door, a large grin on his face at the sight of Harry.
Harry takes his hand this time, guiding him to an open area and showing him how to grip the sword.
But, one time, a week after Harry had borrowed Draco’s book, Draco came back from wine-tasting to find his book on his bed with a slip of parchment rested on-top.
“I haven’t with a girl.” Harry says like it’s common knowledge.
‘I’m sorry I couldn’t return it, but I’ve been so busy. Your father has been pushing us extra hard. I miss you.’
“No, I mean, yes but it was only because you were so loud that I couldn’t get to sleep.” Malfoy explained.
Draco thinks of bright green eyes and tanned skin. Suits of armour and green serpent embellishments. He’s never really been good at ignoring Harry, no matter what the situation was.
Harry accidentally drifted to sleep again, the sound of Draco’s subtle whispers calming him down.
The distance between them had stayed, and neither of them tried to move. Harry lost hope. He wanted to stand up and kiss Draco and tell him he loves him. But Draco didn’t move. He sat, reading the book, occasionally flipping the pages.His body was fragile as it lay vulnerable on the bed.
“Actually no, do go back to calling me a Prince. I want you to tell everyone that the Prince put you in the village stocks.”
“So, Draco.” His father drawls, not even sparing him a glance. “As you are most likely aware, things are picking up here in preparation for the ball...”
“Please, Draco?” Harry asks, without explaining what it was he was begging for.
December 18th, two days before the ball:
“Malfoy.” Harry said, his voice wavering.
“Sure about...me.” He says on an inhale, braced for the worst if that were to happen.
“I don’t want you to mess it up. Everyone outside of this castle is under the impression that you’re a fighter and training to be a knight. I want you to make it believable.” He says with a sharp tone in his voice.
“Yeah...unless you don’t?” He winces at how hesitant he sounds.
Harry thinks he’s funny.
He was sitting at his bed, his surroundings a faint blur. There was an angelic stream of light coming through the windows, and he felt like he was in the sky. He felt like he could fly forever. Draco sat at the end of Harry’s bed, his gaze drifting off to the side. Harry reached his hand out, trying to hold Draco’s hand. He touched it, and Draco looked up, his face blank. ‘Draco!’ Harry screamed as Draco began to fade away, and Harry couldn’t no longer feel his cold hand against his own warm one. The light became dark and stormy, and clouds formed all around him, suffocating him. Where Draco’s body was, a dark black cloak stood, in the shape of his body. Harry tried to move away, tried to reach for his wand but his hand went through his surroundings, and the cloak came closer. Harry felt like his body was clamped down. He couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see. Everything was black.
“Don’t know.” Harry shrugs, watching his movements ripple the water as he steps closer.
Somehow, breakfast is more excruciating than ever, and the walk to the chapel even more so.
“Never said I was a good one.” Harry shrugged coolly.
“But for now try and get back to sleep, a bit of rest will do you good.” She pulls out something from under the chair. “I’ve brought the book I gave you, to get you out of your foul mood.”
“I don’t find you funny.” He says as seriously as he can muster, but finding it rather hard, seeing as he’s almost naked.
Harry snorts. “Anyway, the feast is in ten minutes, but I was thinking I could smuggle some things in a basket and we can have a picnic?”
At the end of the week, Harry had noticed that Draco wasn’t in any of his lessons at all. And he never showed up to the great hall either.
Harry arrived back at the Gryffindor common room to find everyone had already left for dinner. He placed his dirty clothes and stationary onto his bed and got changed into his uniform. It felt odd having it back on after a while of being in pyjamas, but it was good to get back to normal. Well as normal as he could get to, considering the scene that he had just left.
“Draco...” Harry whispers into the charged air between them, but he can’t say any more, because Draco’s mouth has crashed onto his.
Draco’s face was lit up by the sconces that were on either side of him. His face was hard, and he had his mouth clamped as if to stop it from trembling.
“You know you’re parents won’t be happy.” She says to him, trying to say it as though it was a con to the idea, but the grimace she gives says   something else entirely.
Adelaide kisses the top of his head and helps him up.
“Oh god.” Harry groans, but also seems absolutely terrified.
“I’m not in a foul mood,” He explains, “It’s just...Harry...and last night.”
Draco drops his eyes, feeling the tears well back up again.
gonna delete this once the next chap is up but thank you for the love so far and all the really nice comments!! they are very motivational :)
“I was hoping he’d come and pick it up.” Ron shrugged before his eyes widened in realisation. “Not that I don’t appreciate you coming here, of course. It’s just me and ‘Mione barely see him anymore. He wrote us a letter saying the King is keeping him in.”
Harry hummed a reply and started on his potions essay.
He waited for Draco to return. He wanted to see him without his shirt. It was selfish but Harry couldn’t help himself. Draco walked through the door, with Hermione and Ron hesitantly supporting Draco as he slowly moved. Harry silently cursed when he saw that Draco was back into his pyjamas, obviously so that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t see him half naked.
“Be silent, Potter.” Sebastian says, flicking a swathe of limp brown hair from his face. “I work in silence and silence only.”
“Draco!” Harry shouts from where he still stands on the beach. “I’m sorry for pushing you in!”
Ron and Hermione came to visit not so long after Harry and Draco were confronted by Snape. He was glad that Snape had taken house points off of Slytherin as well as Gryffindor, because Draco deserved it. He deserved it after his reaction. Harry couldn’t tell what he really thought about it though, he just seemed to be in shock.
“Great.” Harry said, airily. “Great. Good.” He said again, quickly standing from his seat and making his way to the door.
“Ah, yes Ada.” Draco quickly coughed, putting a smile on his face. “Tea would be grand.” He said warily, noticing Adelaide’s eyebrow shoot up in concern.
“Are you...okay?” Draco turns from Harry, hiding the blush creeping up his neck.
“Good morning.” Draco replied, still unused to the mess of the space. There were completely melted taper candles dotted around everywhere, and the parchment looked as though it had been trampled on by horses. Draco supposed they didn’t have a lot of money, and remembered about their reaction for the bag of money he gave to them not long ago, paying for Harry’s sword.
“Fuck you, Malfoy” Harry said, enraged.
“So if you weren’t betrothed to her by your parents, would you never be with her anyway?”
Find me on tumblr @/ferretboyandpotty <3
Draco stretches—or tries to—on the sofa, his feet hitting the armrests uncomfortably. Harry’s head is propped up on his elbow, and he looks so serene, so sweet that it’s sickly, and Draco would very much like to kiss him.
“Ominous.”
“To...to fight?” It seems a bit unnecessary, being the fact that Draco doesn’t need to know how to fight.
“Harry?” Draco softly asked, still looking up.
Harry put the small cup down and as he did the door shot open, and saw Draco Malfoy being shoved slowly by Madame Pomfrey, who rolled her eyes as Malfoy groaned profusely. He groaned even louder as he saw Harry sitting on one of the beds, watching as he walked in.
“Oh-“ Draco muttered. “Than what is your type?” He slowly said. His heart was beating and he could see Harry’s eyes light up.
“Send this letter off to Celeste Holloway, please.” Draco straightens his back and smiles appreciatively as Adelaide gently takes the letter from his hold.
sorry!!!
“How about you come with me.”
Draco just rolls his eyes and seals the letter shut.
“Is that for Celeste?” Adelaide says, walking further into the study. Harry follows behind, looking at the details of the lavish room.
Before Harry could say anything, a woman walked in, her brown hair frizzy and her smile wide.
“I should hope not. I would give you a detention but it seems that you would be unable to attend.” Tutted Snape, condescendingly.
Fuck. Draco had blushed. Hard. And now Harry was blushing. He wanted Draco to know he liked it when he looked at him like that. And he liked when Draco had wrapped around him. He wanted to wrap around Draco too. He wanted to kiss him.
Draco looked at himself in the mirror. His tunic hangs loosely off of him, and his trousers are tied tightly with a leather strap. His normal clothes weren’t spectacular, but they were hardly anything like what a peasant would wear. The fabric was imported from luxury clothes shops, his tunic was woven delicately by one of the best seamstresses in the Kingdom, and his shoes had been specially made for him, embellished with gold ringlets. He wished he would be able to fill out his clothes better, like Harry did, but he was always naturally skinny and the cloth makers had thought he would be filled out from fighting. He never looked horrible, though, even if his clothes didn’t fit him. His face is one of beauty. He has a naturally gorgeous complexion. The clothes that Adelaide had picked out today were much nicer than what he’d normally wear, but that was because half of the kingdom was seeing him.
“Harry, are you okay?” Hermione quickly said, and Harry turned to see Hermione taking in all of his face.
Draco was being unfair. Totally and completely unfair. He always told Adelaide his struggles and concerns, because she would listen. She would hold his hand and make him tea and nod as if anything Draco is worked up on makes sense. But this was beyond having a problem with the demanding duties of a Prince, this time it was all Draco’s fault. He had no one to blame but himself. He could blame his Father for putting him into a betrothal, but Draco was the one that decided it wasn’t enough. He was such a naive teenager. He regrets it all but there’s nothing he can do. He has to please the King.
“Don’t call me a Prince.” Draco said with hesitation. It felt odd.
Harry places his hands on either side of his face, kissing Draco upside down.
“Right.” Harry says abruptly, and before he knows it, Draco is being carried back through the gardens. “Don’t want you freezing.”
He pulls back, tucking Celeste’s hair behind her ear and putting his hand over hers.
“I love it.” He replied, turning back to look at the lake. “Lake James.” Harry bent down to pick up a small, flat stone. He rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger, before skipping it over the water with 5 littles bounces.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Prince. Is something the matter?” Arthur nods at both Harry and Draco.
“Night.” Harry closes his heavy eyes and felt his heartbeat slow down. Maybe the next two weeks wouldn’t be so bad after all.
Which is what he needs right now. His throat is as dry as a desert.
Draco sits there for a while, pulling up little plants and tearing the leaves off, letting them float on the clear water. He picks up a large smooth stone, and attempts to skip it over the lake. The stone plops heavily into the water, misting up the water with the mud from the bottom of the lake. Draco watches as the water splashes and lands on Juliet’s peaceful sleeping face. She wakes up with a jolt, and Draco decides that he should head back, knowing his mother and father would be expecting him.
Draco pries his face up, looking at Adelaide directly in the eye.
“Fleur Delacour.” He announced. Harry had applauded and wiggled his eyebrows to Ron, much to Hermione’s dismay. He chuckled and turned back to Dumbledore.
The dreaded winter ball is...over?
This time Draco couldn’t hide his sadness. He couldn’t fight back something that was inevitably going to happen. One glimpse of a worried Adelaide at the end of his bed had caused the tears to come rushing back. He was holding back days worth of tears. He held them ever since he realised something that will cause a lot of pain and anger. For himself and for others.
“You coming to the library? Adelaide bought me a new book, and I think you’ll like it.”
“Fine. He’s still annoying though.”
A thrill runs up Draco’s spine.
too long, and it’s overwhelming as some semblance of order comes flooding back, stealing his breath away.
He’s spread wide on the bed, dark circles under his eyes and his chest rising and falling evenly.
As Draco canters deeper into the forest, he can hear the faint running of water from the stream and finds himself at his secret lake. It didn’t belong to him, and he was sure that other people may be accustomed to it too, but he always used it as a private safe haven to get away from his duties as Prince. It was relatively deep into he forest, so he was rarely ever found. He hadn’t had many things to do to spend his time, so he would normally sit at the lake and imagine that he was just another villager, as though his life would be normal and he didn’t have to live under the scrutiny of the noble King. Lucius had strongly advised that Draco take up battling like he did at that age, but Draco became less of an importance to him over the years, and he saw Draco as a family heir to the throne more than he did his own son. So he had stopped the with the direction and left Draco to his own devices. And Draco was bored. Yes, he could take up jousting to please his father and live up to his family name, but he would rather gallop in the woods with Juliet then have them both at risk of death. His life consists of writing to Celeste, talking to Adelaide, attending balls and making public appearances. He couldn’t complain too much, though, as he does live a life of luxury. He would much rather be bored in a large castle than be living in a hut on the outskirts of the land, milking cows all day. He supposes as he grows up, marries Celeste and becomes king, then his life will be more thrilling. For now though, he is  left to ponder and wait. Left to show nobility and family manners.
Instead of leaving, Harry stays put. It’s only a couple of seconds until Draco starts to get impatient.
Harry watched as Ron left the infirmary. He lowered himself back on his pillow and let out a loud groan. His whole body was stiff and aching but it serves him right for playing quidditch out of hours. Even though everything hurt, it was all worth it to see Ron’s face after he caught the snitch for the 3rd time. Maybe it was a good thing that was Ron was a keeper.
“Like he can just tell you he likes them.” Draco said, scoffing.
Harry has recently stopped joining them for
I hope you enjoy this one, I was a bit uncertain about what to write but I’m happy with this :)
“Oh yes! He’s in the office. Please come in, Prince.” Molly offered with her hands.
The sound of the waves immediately washed Draco over with a sense of peace, and he made his way down further, the floor turning from dirt to sand.
“Sorry, Harry.” Draco said.
Harry appears to be in his going-out knight gear, and sits restlessly in the chair.
Draco slides his eyes over to him. “I’ve a feeling you’re planning something.”
“Won’t you get recognised, too? Surely you don’t want that.” Draco said in a small voice, loosing the aim of his argument.
“You don’t love Celeste, do you?” Harry asks softly, but it isn’t a question. It’s so out of the blue that Draco freezes.
Harry lay in silence. Did Draco Malfoy just call him beautiful? No, it must have been one of his infamous sarcastic comments. But why did he sound so sincere? “Well at least you can agree that I do need it, if I hear that laugh one more time I might actually go crazy.”
“Harryyyy...” Draco says in a sing song voice, laughing at how Harry wakes up, confused.
“What are you wearing?” He asks, squinting through bleary eyes.
“Oh.”
Feeling brave, he says “Besides, who said anything about me not being straight too?”
“There’s not much else I can do now. You’ll have to wait for them to heal on their own.” He says, helping Harry shuffle slowly up the bed. Harry manages to stand up, and he clutches tightly on Draco’s arms.
Draco stood back as Harry hugged his friends goodbye, and then walked out of the room, making Draco walk swiftly behind.
He caught a glimpse of blonde and stopped. Draco was at the end of the corridor, his hands on his thighs as he was taking deep breaths.
Draco’s fucked everything up even more.
The fact was, Draco was never going to tell Harry.
“Hey! Some of us didn’t grow up with ballrooms down the hallway. Look, your father is expecting me to at least have a couple dances with a maiden. Can you at least teach me a couple of steps?” Harry begs, stepping back from his close proximity to Draco and holding out his hand elegantly.
“Shit!” Draco stands up quickly. “Shit, shit, shit!”
“Hold this.” Sebastian demands, shoving a pair of fabric scissors in his hands.
Draco rolls his eyes and points at an armchair, indicating Harry to sit down. Sebastian swats at his moved arm.
“It doesn’t change the way you think of me, does it?”
He lifts his head to find his face centimetres away from Harry’s, their breath mixing and their gazes locked.
“Harry, are you sure you’re okay? Ever since you left the hospital you’ve been off. Is there something going on? If Malfoy is being a problem then you can always talk to Dumbledore.” Hermione suggested, trying to offer her support.
“I’m off to the stables, thank the kitchens for my breakfast.” Draco nods and makes his way out of the hall. Talking about Celeste was painful, and it made it that much worse with Harry Potter in the room. How can he be an all-mighty Prince if he doesn’t act like one, in front of everyone. Even though Draco hated his Father for being so controlling, he sometimes did care about his position.
Draco just nods and ushers Sebastian out of the room. He’s almost about to leave to get Adelaide to store away the clothes before a snore resounds from the room.
The match started with a foul straight away, with the hulk of a man trying to pry Harry’s shield off him. It wasn’t going to work, and Harry just stood there with the most confused expression on his face. It looked kind of good on him, but Draco told himself that that wasn’t the point.
And with that he entered. His hood was completely down at this point, and he was able to see everyone in the room, unlike last time when he was rushed past. Most of them seemed to have a polite smile on their face, although they didn’t seem as they were keen about having the son of an almost tyrant in their shop.
“Your choosing, Sir. Go out of your own time though, the castle needs your watch on it. I trust you with my property, Harry, and I don’t want you to disappoint me.” Lucius says, more sternly now.
(and p.s if you want to pls let me know if you are enjoying this!)
There’s a carriage he can see at the bottom of the stairs, and he slowly makes his way down.
Draco relaxes at Adelaide’s words, and knows that she can see though his facade. He really should start opening up more. What was there to lose? “But I don’t, Ada. Soon I’m going to be married off.”
The oak door swings open and Arthur smiles widely at Harry, before he catches sight of Draco and immediately stiffens.
“You sleeping on my bed.” Harry said, standing up. “You left. When I woke up. You had gone back to your own bed. Like it meant nothing.” Harry exclaimed, sadness in his voice.
When the music slows, Draco is able to see Harry from where he is standing and it takes everything in him to not start laughing. He’s not doing too bad, but every few seconds he misses his footing or lifts his arm too early.
“Alright, Draco.” She said, sighing.
“I’ll see you later.” Draco says fondly, and then turns to enter back into the crowded hall.
Once he reaches the brown leather sofa, he slumps onto the couch.
“You like my place?”
“It’s...my book.” Draco says quietly. It was finished just before Harry had arrived.
“Hi.” He smiles sheepishly, lowering himself behind the back of the sofa so that all Adelaide could see was the top of his head.
“Just wanted to see if you were busy. I was going to ask about a book in your library but you’d have to be there to answer.”
“Help me, Harry, my arse is about to freeze off.” Draco mumbles, grabbing at the piles of snow around him.
Harry just nodded and looked from the painting to Draco’s face. Draco knew that he was frowning but he didn’t have it in him to change it.
“I bet you really miss him.”
“Romeo, what are you doing here?” Draco says, knowing the horse wouldn’t be able to respond.
“Well we’re glad you could come, Harry. And Draco, it is truly an honour for you to be here.”
“It’s Christmas day mass, is it not?” He says smugly.
‘I am counting down the 4 years until your arrival, but until then, I hope you keep our betrothment ring by your side. It is a great shame of your distance from the Malfoy castle, but I am not to fret for too long.’ He writes, fiddling and twisting the silver ring around his finger.
Draco, with a lot more elegance and decency, climbed on top of Juliet. And took him and Harry through the forest. Harry was a sure and warm weight behind him, providing with a different type
“I want you.” Harry says simply. “And I think I’ve wanted you for a long time.”
And now, that Harry was alone, in his thoughts and in the hospital, he realised that he was in love with Draco Malfoy. He wanted to tell the world, but he hadn’t even told Draco himself.
Harry studies Draco for a second, before there’s a question evident on the tip of his tongue.
Draco’s breath hitched as he realised that he was in love with Harry Potter. He sighed, lying back. He imagined himself on the bed with Harry and he just lay still for 10 minutes.
“Draco.” Adelaide turned, her hand worriedly clutched around her hair. “Where have you been? Are you alright?” She said quietly, noticing Draco’s slumped posture and disheveled face.
He’s afraid that somehow, if he lets Harry out of his sight for more than a second, something horrible might happen. Draco spends a lot of the time gnawing at his nails, surges of worry apropos to nothing.
Hermione and Ron stood on either side of Harry, helping him get up and walk out of the hospitals and to the bathrooms.
“I- I can’t help it.” Harry muttered softly. Seeing Draco look so dishevelled had made him feel bad, and he didn’t want to anger Draco further.
“Shut it Potter,” Malfoy growled, “It was a potions accident, actually.” He said bluntly.
He trusted him for the shortest amount of time, but in that period that was the only thing he needed trust in. He needed Draco’s trust. He had it, but Draco didn’t have Harry’s.
“Why is everything in this castle green?” Harry asks, standing in the doorway and watching as Draco slowly unclasps the buckles in front of the mirror.
Pierre lifted a large canvas onto the easel, and began studying Draco’s positioning. He gestured with his hands, rather aggressively, to shuffle this way, or jut his hip out more.
“When we were 14, Harry used to get parchment and-“ Hermione started before Harry cut in.
“That’s what my Father tends to do with people he finds exciting. And he says he misses you both.”
It’s very short and I apologise but I just wanted to make it perfect for the ending.
“Why are you smiling? I’m in pain.” Harry sighs dramatically, like a damsel in distress.
“Yes, I see what you mean.” She nods, understanding. “Is Adelaide alright?”
Enjoy!
“I’m joking, Draco, and I’m sure Parkinson says the same about me.” Harry smiled, trying to get his point across to Draco.
Time ticked slower and slower each minute Harry had to lay next to Draco. He wanted to run away. Run as far as he could. But his body was broken and tired. What’s Draco going to do now? Draco can’t get away from him. Can’t escape him. If he had the choice would he do it? Leave Harry? Out him to the school?
“Draco?” Adelaide said as Draco returned to his room.
“Can you help Malfoy, too?” Harry slowly asked, scared for the response. Draco turned his head to ask Harry what the fuck he was doing, but Ron got to it first.
“I suppose you’re right.” Draco huffs, wrapping an arm around the cool metal on Harry’s waist.
Instead of letting Draco storm off and sulk in silence, Harry calls to him. “I’ll be outside. If you wanted to talk.” He sounds so dejected and Draco’s heart aches.
‘Dear Draco,’ He reads, taking a sip of cold water from his sparkling silver goblet while doing so.
Draco stared into nothing. Waiting for Ron and Hermione to leave so he could tell Harry.
Draco groaned. If Harry had this much of an influence on him now, he’s not sure how he’ll survive with the rest of Harry’s stay. If it will ever end. Draco groaned again.
Just pull him forwards by the neck and taste him.
Harry remembered screaming Draco’s name as he disappeared into smoke. He didn’t want to lose Draco. He wasn’t going to let it happen.
“I thought I was protecting you.” Draco panted after holding his breath for too long.
Harry pulls his head back, considering, and Draco can see the cogs working in Harry’s brain, a warning sign for danger.
Instead of trying to fit another word in, as he always does, he just picks up a sword he’d lain on the ground and presses it into Draco’s palm. Draco shoots him a quizzical look, and Harry smiles.
He wants to be happy, and in some moments—the ones where he’s with Harry— he is. He just thought he wouldn’t make it past the ball, and now he has, he’s unsure where to go from there.
The events of tomorrow seem a lot less daunting.
“Yeah, but I’ve been avoiding your father all day. I think he’s pretty pissed. He’d had enough of my recovery and went into our rooms and dragged me out of bed.”
“I might freeze to death.” Harry says through the meaningful silence.
He understood why Harry wanted to get to know him, and fine, maybe Draco wanted to know more about Harry. But Draco was scared. He doesn’t let people into his life that fast.
“Would your father ever wear this?” Harry says, pointing to his serpent encrusted tunic.
“I would have though you had gotten used to the taste of the infirmary’s food.” Malfoy jested, trying to move the direction of Harry’s eyes.
“Speak of the devil.” Harry grins, and Adelaide laughs. The smile drops as soon as she takes sight of Draco’s hair.
“He was in my knight training. We did absolutely everything together. He showed me the ropes because I was so new to everything, and I don’t think I would have won that battle if he hadn’t taught me everything I know.” Harry’s eyes start to well up.
“Well, just for fun.”
“I was just going for a ride...are you okay?” He asks, concerned. Harry slides off of Romeo and leans against the side of him.
“Why do you have a painting of her?” Harry asked.
“You didn’t tell me you were scared of thunderstorms.” Draco says calmly, a hint of amusement coming through. It was rather funny, though. The ostensibly most bravest knight in his fathers land is scared of thunder. He also seems to be scared of admitting he’s scared of thunder.
“I don’t know, he didn’t look great, but when-“ Draco begins, but is quickly stopped by a demanding voice:
“Yeah, I am.” He said, before remembering about Harry’s eagerness about the nature surrounding the castle. What harm could it do if Harry saw his lake?
About an hour into the ball, Draco finds himself leaning against a table, one that has a champagne fountain conveniently placed on top.
Draco quickly finished his breakfast, excuses himself from the table and makes his way to his study.
“Hey, there’s more horrible things to be bad at. If it makes you feel any better I couldn’t tie up my boot laces until I was thirteen.” Harry shrugs, though he acts like he’s proud of that fact.
“Merlin, I-“ Ron gasped noticing that Draco was underneath the dark garment.
Hermione’s mouth dropped at Draco’s statement. Maybe Draco was being a bit harsh, but he didn’t feel bad. Not at all.
“It wouldn’t go with our hair.”
Harry continued his conversation with Ron and Hermione and got caught up on all his work and then they left to go to the library. Harry felt restless even after sleeping the whole day, but he couldn’t help but acknowledge that Malfoy was a couple metres away from him, softly breathing. Harry had never seen him this calm before.
When Draco turns his gaze up to Harry, desire strikes him. He inhales a shuddering breath and tugs Harry down, colliding their faces together hurriedly and messily. Harry swipes his tongue over Draco’s bottom lip and Draco opens his mouth, revelling in the feel of Harry’s tongue exploring his mouth. They push forward and back, wanting as much contact as possible and Draco can feel Harry’s hands tightening on his own.
“What is Prince Draco Malfoy doing here?” She whispered aggressively into Ron’s ear, before shooting a courteous smile towards Draco.
“Harry.” He sighs, riding closer.
“Sure is.” Draco smiles genuinely. Now that that’s out of the way, he’d like to see it tested out.
Romeo belonged to only one person. And that was Sir Harry Potter, the lands most treasured Knight. Sir Harry Potter, who is known for bravery and performing courageous acts on the battlefront. Sir Harry Potter, who the land trusted with their lives. But Harry Potter would never visit the castle. He was too busy fighting in battles and courting gorgeous women, from what Draco had heard. Harry Potter has more accomplishments at age 18 than Draco would ever have in his life. Draco didn’t praise Harry, but there was no doubt he didn’t find him somewhat of a ‘saviour’ to the land.
“Ah, you’re still up!” He smiles widely, swaying from side to side. No damaged hip this time. The only ailments Harry had right now was the inability to stand up. Draco could smell the alcohol from the other side of the room.
“Night.”
“I need my cloak.” He said, scooting around Harry and making his way to his bed chambers down the hallway.
“Ah. No, you’re still an annoying git to me.”
Draco spins on his heel and makes his way back. New mission, ignore Harry Potter.
“Night, Draco.” Harry softly replied, feeling satisfied. “Oh and one more thing, tell  Parkinson to stop cackling like a maniac, it disturbs my beauty sleep.”
“Oh you do make me laugh.” Lucius grins, returning back to his food on the breakfast table.
“Don’t you have work soon?” Draco asked, obviously wanted to accept but worried that he’ll just embarrass himself or they’ll run out of time after his many failed attempts.
“Fine.”
“Why?” Harry’s smile fell, aggravated at Draco’s quick dismissal.
“Like you could do any better, I bet you’ve had food made for you your whole life.” Malfoy confidently stated with a grin, but it went away as fast as it had come when he saw sadness grow on Harry’s face.
His head is on Harry’s lap, and Harry himself is absolutely quaking. His usual coffee-coloured skin is white.
He flipped the letter back over and broke the wax seal that held it closed. He took a deep breath, knowing that he shouldn’t be looking through Harry’s letters, but it he couldn’t turn back now as the black ink revealed itself and he began to read.
Draco’s emotions are so wild right now, so fluctuating that he feels as though he has whiplash. Harry finds him hot. Harry calls him a ‘piece of meat’. Harry says he’s worthy of someone good. Harry insults Celeste.
“I’m intrigued, that’s all.”
“Sorry, Draco. You do know you can tell me anything.” She sighs with a desperate undertone.
At the mention of his name, Will looks up and rolls his eyes, making Harry laugh.
Enjoy! <3
“Oh.” Adelaide softly says. “Draco, what’s the matter? Has something happened with your Mother and Father?” She says, her breath wavering.
“You were when you ignored me.” Harry stated, smirking.
Harry cracked a smile and then started full on laughing. He didn’t know what was so funny, but just the way Draco snapped out of his hard interior had taken him by surprise.
The itinerary is surprisingly short for today, the most important thing being Christmas dinner.
Harry is there almost like he’s waiting for him at the bottom, to greet him and then snatch him away from Celeste. If only.
“Oh.” Harry says faintly.
“Yeah, who knows.” Harry replied, catching Draco’s eyes and reflecting something that Draco had never seen before and something he couldn’t understand.
The sun slowly rose and left a golden light throughout the hospital. The morning owls had visited for the first time since their arrival, and it was all the same stuff. Draco’s weekly daily mail paper and a letter from his Mother. He put the paper to the side and read the letter from Narcissa. Although they had only just arrived back at school, Narcissa still missed Draco. Draco missed her too. Her letters show more and more concern about Lucius and his behaviour. Draco wants to help but he has no power. No strength to stand up to his own Father.
“Oh, I am full of surprises.”
“Yeah. My father has high expectations.” Draco laughs, but there’s no humour behind it.
“Because he’s fun.” Harry announces a bit too loudly. Draco blushes at the embarrassment. What time was the tailor coming again? “Besides, I bet you five gold coins that Draco
Draco shoots a scowl and decides he’s fed up. His new suspicions are true, Harry Potter the ‘Knight in Shining Armour’ is an annoying bastard. And Draco’s having none of it. “I’ll send Adelaide up. And don’t expect me to bring your belongings up, too.” He murmurs, staring into emerald eyes.
Draco doesn’t say anything, and just waits for Harry to open it.
“I heard you two get along well.” Celeste says, smiling at him, oblivious. If only she knew...
“Not how I’d thought it would be.” He starts, trying to find the words. “I remember her being jolly and sweet, and I’d thought that’d be different when we got older. But...she’s sort of like me.”
I started writing this fic a year ago wow,, and two months away from being a year since the first chapter was uploaded...
Harry stops, in front of the azaleas, and makes  sure Draco is looking in his eyes.
He rolls onto his back, body nestled into the snow and looks at Harry. Things were definitely going to change.
“Draco?” A soft voice says, close to Draco’s face on the pillow.
As Draco turns through the halls, he wishes that Harry was there. That they’d bump into each other and Harry would smile and Draco would practically light up. The grey stone corridors always felt empty and cold, leaving an unsettling feeling in his stomach. Harry was like fire. He’d turn the dark stones orange and glow so brilliantly that it takes Draco’s breath away.
His hands snake up to Draco’s belt buckle, the intricate fastenings of the leather nothing compared to Harry’s growing urgency.
Draco listens in very closely and—
“I know you don’t like talking about it much, but I really don’t know what to expect.” Harry says, wiping droplets from his cheek.
“C’mon, Draco. What’s so bad? It makes sense. I know the way you look at me means more than you think I know.” He says confidently, and Draco’s had enough. He grabs his blanket from under Harry, ignoring Harry’s hopeful face at the close proximity and heading for the door.
“Thank you.” Draco replies, taking the compliment. He can feel Harry’s watch on his back as he walks in-front of him, but he still moves with purpose. After a minute of silence, apart from the sounds of Draco’s and Harry’s swishing fabric, Draco decides to speak.
“Allow me.” Hermione said, swiftly moving around in front of Harry and letting him and Draco walk past.
“What?” Harry snaps out of the gaze.
I appreciate all of y’all <3
“I remember hearing about your engagement- I mean betrothal.” Harry starts.
to an understanding.
Draco grips tightly.
“Are you going somewhere?” Harry asked lightly, pointing to the stationary.
“Your friends Granger and Weasley came in early to drop off your work, and didn’t hesitate to wake me up by bickering about how much of a git I was.” Draco grumpily said, getting frustrated about how Harry’s friends saw him. It has never affected him before, but now that he saw Harry as a not so scrawny git, it felt different. Like he wasn’t accepted. He knew Harry didn’t accept him either. He was just waiting until Harry laughs in his face and reveals he was being nice as a joke. But now after spending more than 24 hours with him, maybe it wouldn’t happen.
“They caught the guy,” Potters says eventually.
Potter is biting his lip, looking off to the side over Draco’s shoulder.
Potter smiles. “I know. That’s exactly why I’m here.”
“He would, wouldn’t he?” Granger-Weasley’s voice holds a note of concern.
“Does Harry know? How bad it’s getting?”
running out of time to be able to help you. Let me
“I do, but… you understand I haven’t been able to
“The erectile dysfunction.” Draco is so over pussyfooting around it. “If you can’t say it, you’ll never get past it.”
Draco sighs quietly, but let’s it go. He can’t bully information out of Potter. He can’t bully Potter at all, and he’d know, because he tried for several years at school. So Draco gets up and moves across to the couch, beginning the spells he needs to monitor the curse and reset the Gemino.
“Okay…” Draco almost wonders why it matters, then realises he doesn’t actually care. “Even if you had found someone to take you home, it wouldn’t have been your usual intercourse, would it? It’s new territory for you, different techniques and goals. Would that have gone well with a one night stand?”
A tense silence pulses between them. “Okay,” Draco says.
Hermione giggles. “You don’t really put your things away, it wasn’t difficult. Anyway, as you’ve mentioned, one of your biggest worries about going out into the Wizarding World is all the attention, which is why I brought it. But this weird time pocket has sort of spoiled that plan. We were supposed to be back at the Burrow by now; I’m sure Mrs. Weasley is worried that we aren’t yet.”
“Great. See you then.” Harry brushes past her to exit the library but is stopped by her voice.
“And what of the previous charges? The…the genuine ones.”
Draco’s eyes widen slightly, mostly because he hadn’t been expecting profanity (not that he’s a stranger to it); mostly, he’s impressed. And nervous. He clears his throat.
“One of the rotating staircases vanished completely,” she explains as she takes her place at her desk, “while a student was on it. And one from Beauxbatons, no less. She fell twenty feet, maybe more. Someone tried to cast a Cushioning Charm but just made things worse.”
He finally stands up, shuffling through the other rooms on the first floor, more visions of a hypothetical life washing over him. He isn’t sure where, but somewhere very close by is where his father had taken his last breath.
“We’ll meet your conditions,” Harry says, accompanied by a nod from Leon. “But I have one of my own.”
Ginny’s glare is icy, not even melting in the flames that swirl next to them. “And you want me to be your date to the bloody ball, then?”
“Hmm?” Draco says, not realizing he’d been staring past Harry. “Nothing. Just…going home. It’s not going to be entirely enjoyable, but I think Mother will be pleased to see me.”
Though Draco knows it’s far more than just a stupid grudge, the logic still holds up. If he knows anything, he knows that his father is a goddamn coward. He won’t come anywhere near Hogwarts if it means he could be tracked in any way.
“I don’t want to overwhelm you, Draco, I’m sorry. How about we schedule another appointment for next week? You can come back—or not, if that’s what you choose—after doing some self-reflection. Now that you have a better idea of what we’d actually be trying to accomplish, it might help guide your preparatory process. Jumping off in the beginning is the hardest part. But if you keep coming back, it will only get easier.”
of it,” Hermione whispers, eyes on the floor.
ALSO, just wanted to say that I'm very happy to announce that as of this update, this fic has entered my top 3 most popular fics of all time!! (I am very big on looking at my stat because I'm neurotic ok). Just makes me very happy to know that people are reading and enjoying, so thank you to all of y'all (especially story/user subs, y'all are the fuckin realest). OK now I really am done :)
He pushes away from the wall and turns to face Albus Dumbledore. A portrait of Albus Dumbledore, of course. Draco had been present when the man himself had fallen. A shock of guilt hits him in the throat.
know…Or at the very least, he probably has a vague idea. It’s…complicated.”
“So what exactly is it that you wanted to talk about?” Harry asks as the afternoon air hits his skin, squinting in the light.
“Draco. That’s not what I meant. All I’m saying is my advice in this realm won’t be as informed as most of the other things we’ve talked about.”
. I made a series of very stupid, harmful mistakes, and you were on the receiving end of all of them. I was…so confused. Everything clicked all at once when you held my hand and the idea of such a big change terrified me. So I tried to ignore it, which meant ignoring you. I see now how wrong that was. And I don’t expect you to excuse my actions. Fuck, I don’t even expect you to forgive me now. But I’m here. Before you told me your news, I was actually going to apologize for everything, because I’ve never felt this way about a person before. It
“I don’t forgive you. Not fully. Not yet. That’s going to take some time.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I wish I could tell you, I really do, and maybe I should, but—”
Harry smirks. Draco comes so close to punching him in the face, just retracting his finger and throwing his whole weight into his fist, but instead he pulls away.
“Damn. I really thought that would do it.”
“I’d like to think so.”
“Do you honestly think that was
“It’s a bit odd to see you in here.”
Harry is still planted on the ground, in some kind of shell-shocked state. Hermione has woken up, pale, beads of sweat collecting on her forehead. Ron is crouched next to Harry with a hand on his shoulder; he’s murmuring something close to Harry’s face and Draco can’t hear.
“How are you feeling?” She conjures a chair next to his bed and sits, wrapping her robes around herself as she gets situated.
“I do have a feeling I’ll be taking you up on that.”
“They don’t have to know that!”
Before he can turn to leave, a gentle voice behind him causes him to jump.
Harry doesn’t know what to say, so he keeps his mouth shut.
Leon looks down. It could be in Harry’s head, but there’s a brief, pinpoint of a moment when incomprehensible terror flashes across Leon’s face. But then he’s laughing and shaking his head, and Harry’s sure he’s misinterpreted something.
“I sometimes thought of you. When I kissed him. Usually, if I’m honest.”
Draco finds himself drifting off during Potions. Odd for him. The ultra-strength burn salve he’s working on is bubbling away in front of him, warm odors of eucalyptus and aloe vera drifting past his distracted eyes. He blinks hard, forcing his vision back into focus as he gazes into the cauldron at the mint-green liquid. He allows himself a slight smile, as things are going almost better than he’d anticipated. Slughorn is shuffling around the front of the room, casting brief glances at other students’ work, not concerned with upper-level students. He catches Draco’s eye; he gives the professor a small nod and returns to his own potion, giving it four full stirs around clockwise before turning the heat up a small degree.
“But…Leon?”
“Hello?” Draco says, but it sounds more like a question.
Then he looks into the crowd and sees Ron, crestfallen.
“Here, let’s go find Ron and Hermione. It’s not weird if all of us are dancing together, right?” Harry says.
“Well done Neville!” Harry calls.
Silence.
absolutely mental to you?”
“We’ll send word as soon as we hear anything, that I can promise. Myself and Minerva are working on a plan to defend Draco. She seems rather fired up about it, to be transparent. I think she feels partially responsible.”
says otherwise.”
“It was a coincidence, I
. Of course, it’s his hair. How hadn’t he seen it before? It’s been cut, and it’s styled in a way Harry has never seen on Draco. It makes something in Harry uncurl, unravel, but he’s too busy with the task at hand to think about it.
“But they’ll know it was
“Look,” he growls, “we
He’s fairly certain that she hasn’t, in any case, given the way Leon is sneaking around.
“Y-you! You just came from the Hospital Wing, didn’t you? My brother, David, is he—”
“Yes, I know. It’s just different. I’m not really acquainted with the concept of…homosexuality in general. I don’t think I even know any people who are…gay.”
“Draco, wait!” she calls, but he’s is already gone, his calves buzzing as his chest swells with adrenaline.
And then he’s having visions of walking through the streets, smell of coffee and sweets wafting through the air, a handful of slender fingers slotted through his own. And it strikes him that that could be
“It’s scary to open yourself to anybody,
Ginny is picking at the hem of her dress when they arrive and Leon breathes an audible, relieved sigh.
“Oh, fuck. You’ve guessed who it is, haven’t you?”
“Whoah, whoah, whoah. Hold on. You really are serious?”
“All he did was try to hold your hand?”
Harry frowns, heart dropping. “Who?”
He hadn’t considered that. Thinking of himself as something so different feels like such a big step. A smaller step is admitting he has feelings for Harry Potter. Not much smaller, but much harder to avoid.
“I didn’t tell Luna,” Harry says, again gesturing for her to pipe down. “She just kind of…figured it out.”
for telling me. But overall, you just… You can’t let the world stop spinning around you, even if it feels like it has.”
Her head is in her hands. “I’m sure he took that revelation well.”
He shakes his palm-covered head. “No.” His voice is muffled by his hands. “I’ve never felt this way about anybody.”
Luna shrugs. “I’m not blaming you, but I’m not sure you’re aware how much it hurt her when you asked for this favor.”
“No, no, don’t feel bad! I don’t know what I’m doing, either.”
“Did you get some brand new talent with it?”
“Because you won’t talk to me anymore. Or any of the Slytherins, for that matter.”
It’s Draco’s turn to laugh now. “Technically, no. But if you weigh my mistakes against yours—”
“We’ll probably have to fight to keep it a secret at first.”
“Personally,” Weasley says, a bit obnoxiously, “I think people will be too busy wetting their pants over being in the same room as Harry sodding Potter to care about
Harry nods. “That would be perfect, thank you.”
Harry doesn’t laugh; his eyes are big, worried. “All right.”
Why him?
“It’s okay,” Harry pulls away, smiling. Leon looks concerned. “No, really, it’s fine! I think I need a break, anyway.”
“Because I had one conversation with Harry Potter?”
“Actually, yeah. Later, though. All three of us.”
“You’re a horrible liar. And are you blushing?”
Draco nods and rubs his temples. “Fair, very fair. Much to consider.”
, like a sane person might.”
“Why is that suddenly a bad thing?”
“And this is…okay with you?”
“Functionally, you already
Ron takes his leave as well, and Harry suddenly regrets not reiterating that getting out early wouldn’t be a regular thing. Two in a row would definitely give some people the wrong impression.
that you’ve shared, if that’s what you’re asking.”
A scream. For a brief moment he wonders if it’s just an echo in his head, a ghost of the screams from before, but then it comes again. A strangled cry.
Harry stands. “That’s insane,” he shouts.
Harry looks down at his letter again. “I just need to mull it over a bit,” he says, indicating that he’s through talking about it for now.
A pinch in his head. An ache in his hand. The feeling that everything will be fine, a bubbling feeling in his chest, a vision of his own face, caught off guard, laughing.
After they’ve all had their fill of food and laughter, Harry and Hermione offer to help clean up and are forcefully rejected, so the trio climbs the stairs and convenes in Ron’s room after Hermione breaks off to retrieve something, just like they had so often the past summer. It’s strange to be back so soon, though the time feels like a much longer stretch. So much has changed in the meantime, after all.
“Really? You seem very at home here, I wouldn’t have guessed that.”
“As I said, Pamela has a marked talent for reconnaissance. She happened to overhear a conversation regarding a loophole in Apparition rules at Hogwarts.”
Harry shrugs. “Just wanted to thank me for saving the world.” He laughs as Draco rolls his eyes, and then Hooch is blowing her whistle.
.” He freezes for a second. That’s not true, not technically, anyway. They’d never talked about that label. He shakes off the brief shock of his own words and continues. “In other words, he’s not interested, and can’t be. This is not a competition.”
“I think I might be gay.”
Hermione gasps. “Oh, Harry, I’m sure it’s not. He’s smarter than that, he wouldn’t go anywhere near there, he’s—”
Draco extends his arm fully, nearly gasping as Harry’s extends in tandem. Energy is building in his hand, his mind is screaming, telling him to run in two different directions, and Harry is telling him to cast the spell again and intuitively he knows that if he did, the same silver snake would trust from the tip of his wand, and he opens his lips and tries to get any sound to come out of his dry throat, and the next thing he knows he’s yanking his arm and taking three steps away. A stray strand of hair falls in front of his face. He brushes it back, his chest heaving as he stares at Harry.
He clears his throat, trying not to blush. “As a matter of fact, I’ve sort of been…seeing a therapist.”
Harry swallows a bezoar-sized lump in his throat and follows after as McGonagall bustles through the corridors and ushers them into her office, looking both ways out of the doorway and sealing it behind them. She mutters something under her breath and waves her wand, probably to soundproof the room.
“At least it’s clean,” she murmurs to herself as she finishes. She then returns to her own chair across from him.
with my life.”
Slughorn’s eyes light up and he leans forward. “Ah, of course! What an opportunity! To learn from the very vanquisher of the Dark Lord himself!” He suddenly frowns. “How exactly would that be relevant to a potions-based career, do you think?”
Draco smiles. “That’s all right. Simple can be boring.”
“So I shouldn’t even bother?”
Hermione squeezes his shoulder and he comes back to the courtyard. “I know, Harry. And you’re not so naive to ignore the inevitable drama that will come of all of this. Ron and I were both more than accommodating when you suggested he come stay with us, remember? I just think you need to be cautious. And…you’re going to have to process everything that happened with Leon eventually.”
“Professor, with all due respect, I just don’t think I’m qualified for this.”
knows that Ariana is missing.”
Potter scrunches up his face. “It’s hard to explain because it’s so abstract, but think of it sort of as your soul, or something like that. It’s the intangible thing that makes you
Draco almost slices the inside of his throat on a jagged piece of bacon when Pansy tosses herself onto the bench across from him.
“I thought
“You told me I wouldn’t have to be partnered with…
His honey-gold eyes feel like they’re boring right into Harry’s, a smile crinkling their corners. Harry can’t help but smile back.
end you.”
to consider what would happen if he…No. End of story. Not going there.
“Yeah, I know. That still doesn’t change how I feel.”
“This might sound a bit weird, but would you mind taking a walk with me?” Draco asks, standing up a little straighter.
“We've done plenty of those things too,” he mutters.
you. But Harry, people
Draco falls onto his back as his wand is wrenched from his hand, partially from the force of the spell, partially from the shock that McGonagall cast it. The two Aurors move into the room and toward Draco as McGonagall cries out, “Please, just cooperate for now! There is a way out of this!”
Draco nearly sinks right through his bed. His brows inch higher. “I—Are you serious?”
Of course, he’d argued with Ron and Hermione countless times over just how unnecessary this hypothetical praise would be, but as far as Harry’s concerned, the only thing he’s done is his duty in the grand scheme of things. The words of the prophecy that still sometimes drift through his dreams had been kept well-hidden from the public, so only a select few know that it was always only truly Harry who could’ve vanquished the darkness permanently. He was hoping he’d be able to have some semblance of normality in his life post-war, but as Hermione once pointed out, he’s landed himself firmly in the middle of one of Professor Binns’ History of Magic lessons. Voldemort was perhaps the most evil wizard in history, and to be the one to defeat him…
Draco grabs her forearm. “Wait,” he says and immediately releases his grip when he sees the look on her face. Putting his hand on her had been a mistake. “Sorry,” he breathes.
, your name will stay out of it.”
So bed it is. He’s lucky enough that Blaise is willing to deliver his work to him. For most of his courses, working from bed is not an issue. However, for things like Herbology and especially Potions, it feels like he’s just losing time. The second day of his residency, he considers writing to Mari to see if she’ll visit him, but that feels like overkill. He can pay her a visit as soon as he’s well again, which should be before his next scheduled appointment anyway.
“You’re welcome,” says Harry as Draco flees. It sounds more like a question than anything. Fair enough; Draco is so full of questions himself.
His panic must be contagious; Draco feels worked up again as soon as their eyes meet. Harry closes the door behind him and approaches the bed, where Draco is now sitting with his knees to his chest. Harry’s movements flop back and forth between frantic and cautious, like he needs to comfort Draco but then remembers the current status of the air between them.
Draco swallows a lump in his throat. “All right, go on. It was never really about him?” he says with a little smile of expectation.
“Right. You. Ah, how do I put this gently…Draco, I killed you.”
“Well
Hermione smiles. “No harm done!”
“Can’t. Breathe.”
He isn’t expecting it to hurt as much as it does. She slides the band back over her own wrist, then grabs at his hair, first starting from his hairline and then adding the long strands at the nape of his neck. She pulls it all together, gives it some kind of twist or something—he can’t really tell what’s going on behind him—then slides the band off her wrist once again and over her creation.
whole situation with Mari. Compartmentalizing. Burying himself in his work or simply trying to think about other things. He can’t even get into that in this moment. His reputation is still in the gutter, but he’s hoping the fickle social hivemind of Hogwarts will turn away from him in the near future.
gone.”
“It looks like the rain is letting up, but I don’t think it’ll be finished by dinner,” Hermione says brightly, placing the groceries on the counter next to the stove. Pots and dishes are already whizzing through the air, starting to prepare the food.
“That’s not my angle anyway.”
Sorry for the delay between chapters! Things got a little hectic with the end of summer and the beginning of classes, but hopefully I can stay on top of things and update often-ish :)
of it all,” he says quickly, watching as Leon bites his lip and stops again, turning to him.
A few things happen at once. He sees that Draco is up at his level now, continuing his circles. He then looks down for a split second and sees that, in the stands, Leon is sitting down next to Hermione. She hugs him and points up at Harry, who quickly looks away, thrown.
Ginny stares at him, finger still in mouth. “Like,
The boy trots off, likely to tell his friends about his exciting news, and Draco turns to Harry.
Hermione comes around the table, her grin borderline mad. She throws her arms around Harry, who returns to hug, still at a loss for words.
The truth is, it’s only been a few days since Leon has returned to Hogwarts, only a few days since they mutually agreed to attempt a legitimate relationship. But to Harry, it almost feels like it’s the way things always have been, the way they were
if she needs anything from you. Even if you are Harry Potter.
Draco plants his feet on the ground.
whatever it is, you haven’t told Ron.”
The door swings open. Harry takes a hasty step toward his own bed. “Oh, you’ve been clear since yesterday, lads,” Madam Pomfrey says as she bustles in. “And I’d rather like my own room back, if you’ll believe it.”
Relief seeps into Harry’s expression. Does he really care that much about impressing Draco?
that this first person is lying?”
“Just wait here for a minute,” Draco says.
It might be a trick of the dim lighting, or Draco’s imagination, but Harry’s cheeks go a little pink and he can’t stop his body from mirroring the response. Best of all, he feels an odd accomplishment, an intimacy in the way Harry shared that information so casually. It still makes his throat bend in half to see him hand-in-hand with Leon of all people, but that battle will need to be fought in the morning. He follows them out of the Hospital Wing triumphantly—this night has been a victory in some ways.
Ten minutes prior, all of the students had gathered in the courtyard to be escorted to Hogsmeade and a shriek had ripped through the air. Hysterically, someone inside the castle was screaming about how someone had been taken, but any other details were lost in her incoherent wailing.
“Nothing. I don’t need you to say anything, Harry. You can’t
“I’m not expecting you to trust me. Not right away. Maybe not ever. I don’t know. This is all very new territory.” Draco almost screams in frustration as he pushes his hair away from his face
? It’s a load of nonsense, you have to know that—”
“But you don’t have a date already?”
The old Draco. He’s not so sure there’s a solid line between old and new. The Draco from
“You’re telling me,” Harry says. Something in the air has changed, a stubborn cloud has finally surrendered to Draco’s current, the sun blasting down into Harry’s heart. It’s different than the blinding light he tried to steep in when he kissed Leon; these beams are warm, careful, nurturing.
Finally, he says, “What do you have to thank me for, anyway? I thought we agreed to leave the past where it belongs.”
“Fine,” Draco says politely, not interested in small talk. Slughorn, luckily, is adept enough to pick up on this.
Draco can tell that Weasley—
“That’s not what I meant,” Draco says, crossing to Harry and pulling out a chair to sit across from him. “I don’t think you should be an Auror either.”
When he enters the kitchen, he’s almost knocked flat backwards as he’s met with a deafening shout of “HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY!”
Ron crouches next to him. “What the bloody hell was that? It sounded like…”
“Mrs. Weasley, I—”
“I know,” she says, holding up a hand in an attempt to mollify him. “You have to understand that I’m on your side. I’m on Draco’s side as well. Not only is there no conceivable way he could have been communicating with and aiding his father throughout all of this, I’ve also seen change in him firsthand. I made him Prefect, for Merlin’s sake! And after hearing about more of his history and the reasons he was in his prior situation, I hardly want him to be put away for crimes he committed only after years of being groomed and emotionally abused. But I only have so much power. Regardless of why he did it, Draco resisted arrest
Blaise fiddles with his robes for a second and then stands abruptly. “I have to get to class.”
“Narcissa, he’s still essentially a child. Though the
Harry just shakes his head. “Hermione, would you count us off?”
“Who here—and I’d bet it’s just a select few of you—has ever been able to successfully cast a nonverbal spell?”
Draco clears his throat. “He’s sort of the only reason I’m thinking about all of this at all. A relationship is so far from my desire right now. But we’ve sort of been bonding, and he sees me more for who I am now than who I was. Even though I was never really kind to him. In fact, for years, I went out of my way to make his life miserable.” He bites his tongue, afraid that he’s giving away too much information. “Anyway. There have been some moments recently when lines blurred and I couldn’t tell what was happening. I don’t even know if he’s…you know.”
“That’s infuriatingly vague” Harry says. He’s exasperated but he offers Draco his hand anyway.
gay and that you don’t like him that way. I’ve heard some gay men are rather good at figuring out when other men are gay, even if they’re not explicit about it.”
She approaches the bed, her eyes glassy.
Draco sits up and his hands shoot to his sides. “Absolutely not.”
“Things?” Harry asks, trying to conceal the slight shake of his voice. What could that possibly mean?
Leon chuckles and moves them to the side. “What do you say we go for a walk? It’s so nice out now that autumn is approaching.”
“Sorry about that, here you go,” he says awkwardly, holding the clothes at arm’s length. His hair is messier than usual and he seems rather breathless.
“Yes, on the whole gay thing.”
“Absolutely.”
“I’m so happy for you,” is all Harry can muster. What words are sufficient here? “You’re saying goodbye, I suppose.”
“Right,” he says, shaking his head. “Well if not sooner, see you Monday.”
I told anybody. That’s not my place.”
Draco swallows. “Okay. Try that, then.”
, they’re going to believe it until the
He giggles—he
“I’m fine, Draco, really. Because of what you did, the Dementors didn’t actually touch us. Still, it’s very unsettling to know that so many were here. I mean, where did they even come from? Have they been trapped down in the dungeons this whole time? Something is just not right.”
“I know. Thank you, Harry. But I assured Madame Maxime that her and her students would be safe here, and now this? I’m sorry, you two. You shouldn’t have to see me like this.” She pauses, clutching a hand to her chest. “You may go now. I thank you for your patience.”
Harry crouches and tries to coax her into consciousness, but she’s out cold. He risks a brief glance at the end of the room, where Draco is standing against the entryway, eyes wide, clinging to the stone and scrabbling backward.
“This place...it’s amazing,” Leon says once they’ve finished most of the tour.
“No, Draco. There’s too much at stake here.”
With one last Sisyphian effort, Harry pushes past the spell’s influence, shoves it out of his head. He finds a gossamer thread of feeling that isn’t his, not sure how he can feel it, but grabs hold of the strand of dread that’s hanging solo and anchors himself to reality.
He starts almost every morning by studying his scar. Not because he has any fondness toward it, but because he’s noticed that somehow, it’s started to fade ever so slightly. For the first month at the Burrow he’d been sure it was just a trick of the light, his eyes playing tricks on him, but then the curiosity had gotten the better of him. He’d held an older picture of himself up to the mirror, confirming that it has, in fact, softened just slightly. Not enough to really be noticeable to others, but after seventeen years of seeing it so pronounced, Harry marks a difference.
Draco hums, nodding. He’s not sure what to think; it makes a lot of sense; on the other hand,
“You do sound crazy,” Draco says, “but I don’t disagree with you. Maybe we’ve both lost it.” He’s almost forgotten that they’re not alone, Harry’s eyes the only thing he can see, the only thing he wants to see from now on. “Let me talk to my mother,” he says and takes one of Harry’s hands. “Maybe I’ll go back and forth. I think that might be nice. Weekends at the Manor, the rest of my days with you lot.”
“Well there you go!”
and actually wants to hear about Leon and his hair and his eyes and the way he has to stand on his toes to kiss Harry. Well. Maybe those details are just for him.
He’s crying openly now, not making a sound but allowing the tears to collect in the corners of his eyes and drop onto the desk below him. “It just feels like too much to ever make up for. What if I’m too broken to fix at all?”
Yes, Harry has seen plenty of male bodies in his life, including his own, but something about the compactness of Leon makes him want to touch, touch
He fights the urge to push again, to make another snide remark, because will Ginny even remember any of this in the morning? She’s being childish, and while he can understand the pain she’s in and how he’s only exacerbated it, this is utterly ridiculous.
“How does the afternoon sound? We could meet in the Defense classroom after my class?”
“You don’t have to start anywhere in particular,” she says quietly. “Healing isn’t linear. Nor is our experience of the world around us. Life is such a complicated thing and sitting around trying to understand all of it—and in order— would just be a waste of our time. We talk about what you feel is important, how it makes you feel and how it affects you, and then talk through and beyond it. I can’t promise I’ll always have the answers, or even that I’ll have them
“It’s alright, Ron ate more than enough for the two of us.” She loops her arm through his as they walk. “Wow, Harry, this is so exciting! We can talk about boys together now. Who do you think is cutest in our year?”
professor.”
He chokes on his breath. Something massive and dark lurches at the two girls in absolute silence, not counting the scream of the girl who is left standing there.
He shrugs. “I know how intelligent you are, so whatever it is must be good.”
!” Harry says, outraged.
of it?”
“Hey. Just. Don’t do that. I’m not saying we’re gonna be best mates and play Exploding Snap together between classes—”
A glint of a smile flashes across her face, though a slightly frustrated one. “I disagree.”
Harry grins at him. “Take it or leave it. Really, Draco, I don’t think anybody will be the wiser if I Apparate to Malfoy Manor one time. I’m not the one being monitored at the moment.”
Harry looks between Ron and Hermione, the latter of whom is catching on.
Every pore on his body is practically tingling. “How…do you know that?” are the words that come out of his mouth, and he kicks himself when he realizes that he’s confirmed her suspicion.
Kingsley laughs again; it booms through the manor, rich and warm. “If only that were the worst of my worries. I’ll be off now. Again, if we hear anything we’ll be in touch, and we expect the same of you. Draco turning himself in may be the last piece of this puzzle. Should we find him before the Aurors do, I think it would be wise to convince him to at least consider it. If he comes quietly, I wager the Wizengamot will be more sympathetic.”
“I can’t let you put yourself in danger for me.”
“Not last time I checked, no,” he replies, pulling his arm out of her grip. “Are you referring to something specific?”
He runs his hand along the wall as he takes slow steps, taking everything in. There are a few picture frames sitting on the mantle, most of them of just their little family. He closes his eyes, imagining the house when it was still full of life. A crackling fire, his father encouraging baby Harry to commit some kind of mischief, his mother lovingly scolding both of them. He even dares to think about those three lives growing together, aging. It’s something he spends more time fantasizing about than he’d ever admit, but being in the very place where it would’ve happened is almost too much for him to handle.
Draco takes a step backward, almost steps on Harry’s hands. “You’re insane,” he spits. “The staff will be on their way. They’ll stop this.”
Harry scoffs. “I said I would try to make sure, but you’ll just have to deal for one more week, I’m afraid. You know, he really isn’t
McGonagall sighs and shifts on her feet. “I pay attention.”
A ripple of mumbling spreads through the room. Draco sinks into his seat. He’s never been able to summon his in full. Silver wisps are typically the best he can do.
“Ah, Minerva,” comes Maxime’s booming voice as she walks through a gap in the center of her students’ formation, holding her arms out. “I must thank you again for being so hospitable in this trying time. I am confident that our students will make the most of this experience.”
“‘llo,” says Ron.
before, not on the mouth. There’s no gauge for comparison, but somehow he knows as Harry takes Draco’s top lip between his own two that nobody will ever kiss him like this. Even if the violence of their attraction eventually leads to implosion, as Harry kisses him, kisses him, and kisses him and kisses him, Draco knows it will have been worth it.
As always, I'm going to just give a little disclaimer that I am a sl*t for comments and love responding to people (although sometimes I do forget so I apologize for that if I've accidentally ignored you). But yeah please come freak out at me in the comments, nothing makes me happier than seeing people's reactions to my writing (except for the writing itself hehe). Enjoy! <3
feel about this?” Ginny asks Leon.
“I want to go inside,” he finally murmurs, still squinting slightly in the summer sunlight. He can see where his bedroom must have been by the gaping hole in the side of the cottage. He pushes the gate open, the hinges stiff. Probably, nobody has entered since Voldemort himself, all those years ago. There’s an ominous feeling hanging over him and he almost jumps as there’s a sudden movement from behind him. Ron had made to follow him, but Hermione held out her arm to stop him. She glares at Ron, then gives Harry an encouraging nod.
Potter frowns. “No, you said seek pleasure alone.”
“Well, the guys. The burglars—
“The guy who cursed you,” Draco says, understanding.
“That’s them. This is… I’ve always… You’ll find something. Hermione will find something.”
“Come on, Potter, let’s get it over with. Up on the couch.”
Potter begins to blush.
“For you, right now, sure. But there are people who have had success with less traditional forms of sexual pleasure and intimacy. Erogenous zones go beyond the crotch. Imagine someone kissing your neck, stroking your back, licking your nipples... Do none of those things excite you?”
“You said I should try it with someone else, what else was I supposed to do, ask Ron?”
“It’s fine, I get it. It’s not your fault. It’s a thing—another thing, on top of all the others. I’ll cope until we fix it.”
“I’m struggling,” admits Potter. His eyes are on his hands, which he’s wringing in his lap.
Granger-Weasley’s face is hard as she looks at Draco for several seconds, no doubt assessing his motives and how much time she can afford to waste on the niceties. For Draco, of course, this is more than just a polite enquiry.
“I would. I’d want to know what their favourite song is, what they think about as they fall asleep, what toppings they like on their pizza. What’s physical intimacy without emotional intimacy?”
“I think it’s called dating, Potter. It might have been a while since I’ve had time to try it myself, but I hear it’s still quite popular.”
“See you next week, Potter,” he says as he holds the door open.
Potter’s fake cheerfulness drops in an instant. “You’re talking like it’s a foregone conclusion.”
“Yes.
“What about knitting? I’m sure they’d be lines around the block for an original Harry Potter knitted blanket.”
“If and when you decide to have sex with another person, yes.”
“About our weekend plans? I was thinking about going for a jog, myself.”
Draco raises his eyebrows and hums.
He doesn’t think as he works, focusing solely on the magic in front of him and the person it’s working its way through. He quickly identifies it as a Tabes curse and spares half a second for a wince—there is no known counter-curse. He manages to halt the spread of the spell and, eventually, draw it back to the impact site. He uses the more intense Claudum stasis charm to lock the dark magic in place, giving them time to examine it further and explore what can be done.
The huff that escapes Draco is entirely involuntary. Potter’s first concern would be for everyone but himself. Draco only wishes he could disparage Potter for it.
Wordlessly, Potter picks up the quill and signs.
Potter’s elation turns to confusion. “Then what—?
“Almost everyone was absolutely fine,” Weasley tells him. “Not even any minor injuries.”
Potter is antsy.
“I’ll try, but Potter—”
, not the end of the world I feel like it is sometimes.”
Draco studies Potter for several seconds, but he simply smiles mildly back at him.
. He’s well enough to have
For several seconds, Draco is taken aback and can’t process Potter’s words. He stumbles for a reply, before finally settling on one. He grins.
“Not sure, to be honest.”
“I thought we weren’t talking about your blue balls any more?”
“Next week then, sure. Bye, Malfoy!”
“Reads like a keyboard smash.”
Potter looks doubtful. Draco doubles his restraint to not make a joke.
“I’m not doing this right now. I’ll talk to you next week. Now shut up and help me down.”
“Point is, dating and getting to know someone isn’t going to get me laid and solve this sexual frustration thing.”
, though,” he hastens to add. “I could refer you to one of the urological spell damage healers at St Mungo’s who—”
“The more resistant it will become.” Granger-Weasley sighs, all her questions seemingly answered for the time being. Though she has a small, determined frown and Draco just knows he’s going to be receiving an owl, or, Merlin-forbid, a visit from her once she’s had time to do her own research.
“The, ah, the other thing?”
“Oh, I will.” Potter looks at him with a slight smile. “I don’t think it’s just physical, either. After all the things we’ve talked about, I think I’m starting to, I dunno… open up to the idea of opening up. Does that even make sense?”
This is ridiculous. Draco is the
“Well, the thing is, no one wants to have sex with a cripple.”
“Is everything okay?” Celeste asks, worried.
His peaceful bubble of calm quickly evaporates at the sound of shouting and grunts from the grounds. The event of another attack is rare but not unlikely, and Draco quickly stands up in panic. His first thought, alarmingly, was to Harry’s whereabouts. He wonders what that says about him.
“To town.”
Draco felt his face grow hot, and he looked away before the trio could notice.
“Together?” Draco suggests. Both Draco and Harry knew that last night was the start of something between them.
“Yeah, I know. I’m just...confused.” He replies, not letting on anything else.
The dramatic sod.
A fault in the smile. A breath hitched. He should be in love, his Father said so. You do not disobey the King.
“I honestly don’t know. I asked Adelaide to check. I was going to ask you, but you seemed busy.”
“Draco, when did you...?”
Draco lifted his hood, quite displeased with Ron’s statement. He had trusted Harry enough to reveal himself, knowing that he was so close to whoever these people were.
Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He stared at Draco’s face, trying to read his emotions, but it was empty.
“Are we done soon?” Draco asks, trying not to slur his words.
“Ada.” Draco calls, leaning back on the creaking oak chair that sits in his study.
“Adelaide, I can’t tell you. I can’t- It’ll just. It’ll ruin it all.” He chokes out, shaking his head against Adelaide’s reassuring body.
Harry’s mouth raised into a smile, and he turned to Ron who was nodding in agreement and Hermione who had a small blush on her face.
“Hardly. And it didn’t stop you from acting snotty when we first met.” Harry shrugged, a smirk sitting nicely on his face.
“Hey! You said you didn’t get it the first time either!”
“Oh, Draco.” Harry rolls his eyes, but he’s grinning too. “Never have I been more.” He offers.
Draco wakes up with a jolt, hearing a weak knock on the door. He looks out of the window, and at the fading light of the mid-autumn sky. He must have slept for hours.
“Care to enlighten me?” Draco says, raising an eyebrow and wanting to know more about Harry.
“Betrothed.” Draco added. Engagements were supposed to be happy, and Draco was far from that.
Draco nodded and took a deep breath. What the fuck was he going to do now?
“How do you mess it up this bad?” She grumbles, tugging strands back. “I think it looks very smart!”
“Bad as in?” Draco swings his leg over Juliet and hops down, going to stand next to Harry. He places a reassuring hand on Harry’s forearm, and Harry looks up at him.
“Is that me?” Harry asks, until he looks at the woman next to the man that looks scarily like him. “My parents...” He whispers faintly, pressing down a peeling bit of canvas from the corner, revealing their names.
Draco slowly makes his way through the dark palace, walking past rooms filled with expensive furniture and valuable collections. Draco lives on the west wing of the castle, where he has his own private study, bathroom and library. He chose the west wing because it gave him an unobstructed view of the castle’s gates, and Draco liked to watch people’s as they lived their lives, hoping that he’ll one day be as free as them. The rooms were decorated in dark green and black, and the library was the size of a small house containing a large fireplace that Draco normally found himself sitting in front of late at night. Anything to escape reality, really.
By the time they got out, it was too dark for them to head to ‘Lake James’. Or as Harry liked to call it, ‘James’.
“But, at the same time, I’ve never minded the cold.” He reconsiders, pulling back. “Are you sure you’re okay?” He asks. “I know that you normally treasure your sleep, it’s odd to see you up late.”
“Where should we go, Jules?” He says, stroking her ears. “Beach or Forest?”. Juliet turns her body towards the large towering trees that sit at one side of the caste. “Forest it is.” He laughs, but quickly stopping in case one of the working maids may hear him. He must show royal etiquette wherever he may be. Even if he does not agree with Lucius’ rules sometimes. Lucius’ ‘Royal Etiquette’ was the reason why Draco was called a conceited Prince, but the reasoning behind it was because Draco couldn’t be seen as anything other than a man of class and status. He couldn’t smile and nod and walk through the town smelling the baked goods and flowers. He had to keep a serious face, and was taught not to converse to other’s who were not approved by Lucius. Whoever Lucius respected, Draco was to show that same amount of respect, too.
“I can’t wait to start seeing you more.” Celeste says excitedly as she stands, making her way back to the floor with Draco not far behind. He’s starting to feel a bit weary now, his social battery completely drained, but he feels as though he’s done it.
The small dust particles float around the air, swishing behind Draco’s flowing cloak. It was his favourite one, because it was the one that Adelaide had made him. Even though it was scorching outside, he wore the elegant fabric with pride. He ducked through small archways and went down hundreds of steps.
“Have you seen him?” Draco interrupts.
They’re both sweaty and breathless by the end of it, clinging on to each other like a lifeline.
“Harry...?” Draco says again, concerned. His eyes are blown wide.
“Gorgeous boy, this Malfoy, eh? Cheekbone, lips, very good for painting.” Pierre said to Harry.
