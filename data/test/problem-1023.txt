“I’m fine, love.” Harry laughed as he pulled Draco closer. He took a moment to bury his face in the boy’s hair. “Really I think we need to get out of here for a while if you’re getting this paranoid.”
"Take me to bed, Draco." Harry whispered suddenly, turning to his boyfriend, tears shining in his eyes. "I need to know that you love me, please."
"You can feel my magic now, can't you?" Harry laughed quietly, seeing the confused look on Draco's face. "Good, I want to test if I can control who notices it. We can kill two birds with one stone by visiting the Headmaster."
"Alright I think everyone is here." Harry called for attention when the last few students slipped in. "Today we're going to be running two lessons. For all of the students who have either not been here before, or to those who had trouble with this last year, we are going to have a recap of the simple shield spell. If you feel that you could benefit from this then please stand where the pillows are. Don't feel embarrassed if you think you need help with this spell, while it sounds simple, a well cast shield spell could really save you one day and I want to make sure that everyone here knows how to cast one." Harry waited for the students to move and get situated before he continued with his instructions. "Alright good. Now I know that Professor Williams assigned both the sixth and seventh years to practice the patronus charm. For those of you who need practice, and I'm sure that is most of you, you can move around the barrier to the other side and wait for further instructions.
The fog surrounding Malfoy Manor sent a chill down Snape's spine. He resisted the urge to pull his robes closer to his body. It would be seen as a weakness and the last thing that he needed was to add more fuel to the fire. As he made his way from the ornate gates to the large front doors, he had little time to admire the gardens, though he did notice that they did not look as lush as usual.
“Alright, you win.” Ginny smiled, standing slowly as she began to feel her body tense. She would be even more sore in the morning, but the workout had been worth it.
"Honestly I'm a bit tired." Harry replied smoothly. He hoped that his slight pause had not tipped off the old wizard, but he had been truthful and it seemed that Dumbledore believed him because he simply nodded in agreement.
"Kreacher." Draco called. He knew that Dobby would never talk to him after his father had treated him so poorly and Mipsy didn't know Harry nearly well enough for Draco's purposes so his only option for snooping would be to deal with the unpleasant house elf that used to belong to his mother's family.

The halls were dark and the portraits that he passed all gave him poorly hidden looks of distain. They had all seen him out well past curfew in the past five and a half years and he knew they weren’t about to start reprimanding him now. Luckily Peeves was not in the same section of castle if the lack of off pitch singing and cackling was anything to go by. Harry kept his wand in a tight grip, navigating in the dark. He would not risk a
More people were coming down the hall from the other end, Harry vaguely made out the shape of Hermione's bushy hair and Severus' flowing cape before the two were close enough to actually be identifiable. Along with them were the three other heads of houses and Professor Dumbledore himself.
“I think I’ll stay here for now, I’m sure he will want to see me and speak to me at some point, and I with him, but I’m tired.” Narcissa spoke slowly and while her voice wavered and the pain was obvious, she seemed much more clear minded than she had the night before.
"I assure you that won't be necessary." Harry responded curtly. He did his best not to sound disrespectful. He knew that McGonnagal was a staunch supporter of Dumbledore, but even she had been upset with the old man's actions as of late and Harry still looked to her with much respect as a witch and an educator.
"Severus my boy! What seems to be the matter? Oh and Harry too, I hope you two haven't gone and gotten into a fight again." Dumbledore greeted them jovially, making Harry grit his teeth and Snape want to slap the man.
The core sat around the largest table in the library which was at the dead center of the room and was often referred to as the ‘war table’. Mugs of tea and coffee from breakfast lay strewn about and each of the teenagers were taking notes in their preferred methods, parchment and muggle lined paper mingled with quills and pens. Severus watched the group silently, curious to be seeing them so well organized and sharp. He had to remind himself that the age-range before him ran from fifteen to seventeen. It hardly seemed possible.
While he waited for Draco to take his shower Harry stayed true to his word and began to make a large breakfast, brewing tea for himself and coffee for Draco. He knew what an addict Draco was, living with him for the past five days taught Harry quickly that a Draco without coffee was not pleasant to deal with. He only hoped that if he made things as easy as they could be the blond wouldn't act out without talking to him first. When Draco did join him Harry could tell that he still wasn't quite with him.
With another heavy sigh, Harry dragged himself out of bed, quickly spelling the sheets clean before making his way to his private bathroom. He figured that a cold shower would at least help with one of his problems and with a clearer head he would be able to sort out the others. He knew he had to talk to Draco, he just didn't know what to say. Should he tell him how he felt? It took two days, but Harry was now able to confidently say that he knew what his feelings toward the blond really meant. Much to his surprise somewhere in their brief time together Harry found himself very much infatuated with Draco. He wasn't the one who put it in those terms exactly (again Ginny and her endless insight, though Harry was truly thankful to her) and now he just really wanted to know if Draco felt the same.
The three were looking for books on powerful protection spells and potions. The whole reason for building a house rather than just purchasing one was because Harry wanted to fortify every plank of wood and nail that would go into the building with an array of protective measures that would make Hogwarts look like a shack in comparison. It made it so their work was much more extensive, but with everyone in the Order eventually meant to be working on it as well as with Severus' help, the project would be set to finish around the winter holidays. It would mean weekend field trips and all nighters pouring over books and cauldrons, but the end result would be more than worth it.
"Why don't you tell me, maybe I can help." Harry continued to stay calm externally, but the slight sparks in his eyes betrayed him.
“I can’t tell you everything Harry, soon there will come a time that you will not have me to rely on.” Dumbledore had the nerve to level Harry with a reproachful look as if he had been the one to do something wrong. “You cannot expect that everyone around you give you all of the answers when you are capable of discovering them on your own.”
"I just got out of a meeting with the Headmaster. I think it best we speak in private." Snape looked around at all of his students surrounding him, suddenly feeling very uncomfortable.
“Harry’s right, we should take a break for lunch and then regroup.” Luna suggested and the groups broke up from there, their tasks decided upon.
"It's okay, it's okay to be scared. What happened, we can help." Harry drew circles on his back with one hand, doing his best to calm the blond.
His friends, including Draco, had all been understanding and supportive by giving him space. They could not possibly understand the conflicting feelings that plagued him, keeping him from sleeping at night, and no one dared try. They had all learned that he would come to them when he was ready and he was sure that it was Draco’s quiet support that kept even Ron and Hermione from hounding him to open up.
"Good job." Harry smiled, pulling Draco in for a hug. The blond hadn't expected this of course and let out a very undignified squeak. Harry laughed at the sound, allowing the boy to bury his blushing face into his neck. "I'm proud of you."
"I know you're hiding something, you all are!" And then the metaphorical light bulb went off in everyone's minds. Dumbledore had been letting the attacks and warnings go because he had thought that they where being targeted by Voldemort for information that they where holding back from the Order. Where he had come up with such a theory no one could quite figure out, but the eminent danger of the situation was finally clear.
"Is this true, Nott? What have you heard from your son?" The man in question paled at being addressed, but stepped forward.
“I suppose that makes sense.” Harry conceded. “If you're sure, love, but where does that put us? What do we do from here?" Harry asked sitting back and pulling Draco down to him. He agreed with the others, but he didn't want to upset the blond and he did trust him. However, that didn't mean that he trusted the girl.
"Here. You'll feel better." Harry handed Hermione a cup. She had calmed down enough so that she was sniffling and catching her breath. Her eyes were bloodshot and puffy and she still looked miserable, but she took the tea and sipped it slowly. Draco let go of her to accept the cup that Harry was giving him, still watching his boyfriend carefully. He wasn't accustomed to one person expending as much magic as he just had and he was still surprised that Harry didn't seem to be affected. He was much stronger than Draco could have ever imagined and it made him feel that much safer being in Harry's presence.
"Okay I'm sure that you all have more questions, but it's getting late and we all have classes in the morning. I just need all of you to sign the document that Hermione has kindly set up for us on your way it. It just allows me to talk to Snape about this group existing as well as allow him access to this room while we hold meetings should he see fit to come. If you don't want to sign, please come see me and we can work something out."
“Okay, well then I think we know what we need to do. It’s probably best we if introduce her to everyone slowly for now.” Harry said gently, pulling the attention away from Neville to give the boy a moment to breathe.

"I had to thank you somehow." Draco smiled, brushing the compliment aside as the tingling sensation in his belly started again, it seemed to be doing that every time Harry complimented him, smiled, or even blushed, and Draco found it rather unsettling, but comforting at the same time.
"You're always alone, Mate." Ron complained, not sure what Harry's problem was but he was fed up with his attitude. “What, you don't trust us anymore?"
Draco and Ginny met in the middle of the raised platform and bowed as was customary to in a proper duel. They parted after exchanging pleasantries. Draco stood at one end, wand raised above his head in a duel stance. Ginny stood on the other side, her wand pointed straight in front of herself, her other arm behind her back. They stared each other down waiting for Harry to give the signal.
"Well I'll see you both around seven." Draco’s eyes met Harry’s and a kind smile passed between the two before Draco left the room.
Severus thought it highly unlikely that Draco or Harry would believe that and if they didn’t believe then neither would their band of student fighters. “You will be cast from the school in less than a week.”
Something was terribly wrong and Severus knew that Nott openly goading him like that shouldn't have caused such a reaction in him, but he had been on edge since the start of term. Despite his best efforts, the Dark Lord was starting to doubt him and with how long he'd been under cover Severus could not bare to have his cover blown now. He would have to talk to Albus about this knew piece of information before McGonnagal returned. It wasn't that he didn't trust the woman, it was quite the contrary actually. He really wished that he could talk to her, she had always been like a mother figure for him especially since his own mother died when he was so young, but Albus had been very adamant that no one could know the true extent of his sacrifices for the Light. The fewer people who knew the fewer people who could get tortured and accidentally give him away. With a great, weighted sigh, Severus pushed open the door to Albus' office, not bothering to knock.
"Albus, I know that my daughter is a fantastic flier, furthermore I know that she would not have simply fallen off her broom. That and Ron made it explicitly clear that the broom moved on its own accord, throwing her off. That's a jinx if I've ever heard of one." Arthur spoke in a low, deadly calm voice that sent chills down Harry's spine. He had always known never to cross Mrs. Weasley, but he wondered if maybe it was Mr. Weasley that the Headmaster should be more fearful of.
“That might not be such a bad idea. We’re going to need that in a few days too, I set up with the goblins to have Draco and I go to the vaults to pick out the furniture that we’re taking. I was going to just sort it and then go back when we were done with the house, but if we can manage it all in one run that seems much easier.”
“So I heard, I’m sure we’ll have time to discuss details later.” Severus didn’t even bother to hide the awe in his voice or face as he watched the very clear, easy display of Harry’s magic. It was obvious that in their own home, Harry had no issue with showing the full extent of his power.

"Do you have an appointment?" The goblin asked, his bored tone meant to show indifference, but his face was written with curiosity.
"I've been trying to figure out what Nott has been up to since the beginning of the school year. I knew that with Blaise and Draco gone things were going to change in Slytherin, but I wasn't prepared for just how much. The thing that you have to understand is that in our house, things are very dependent on who you are, who you talk to and where your family ranks in pureblood society. Before Draco defected, as they have been calling it, he was the leader, even when we where younger. Because he and Blaise were so close from the beginning Blaise became what we referred to as second in command. I was one of the few who was also very close to them, while Crabbe and Goyle were simply bodyguards. Nott was always very jealous of Draco, if it weren't for him, then he would be in control. When they left, my loyalties were put into question and I was outcasted by the whole house. Crabbe and Goyle simply declared loyalty to Nott to avoid any problems so I was left alone.
Since that night the two seemed to be avoiding each other. Harry didn't know why, but he just knew that Draco needed space. Ginny assured him that everything would work out and that Harry being understanding enough to give the blond space was a good sign. According to her it meant he knew the man better. Harry couldn’t help, but doubt that. He felt like he hardly knew himself, much less knowing anything about how Draco's mind worked. He knew that he couldn't let things go on the way they had though. Having explosive wet dreams was one thing, Harry could handle that seeing as he had been a teenager not that many years ago, but the tension in his own home, no Harry would not stand for it.
"This lesson ought to be boring." Ron whispered from behind him and Hermione glared at him. All of the Gryffindor sixth years had learned about how to cast a patronus in the DA the year before and while very few succeeded in casting a full one, Harry was confident that they would do well in both the lecture and practical lessons.
"I know, but I'm afraid-" Harry trailed off, but Hermione knew what he was trying to say. While Harry had never directly told her or Ron about the horrible treatment he received at the Dursley's, Ron had told her about the bars on his window and the small things that he noticed on the night he and the twins rescued him.
Draco was surprised that Harry had mentioned his Godfather’s vaults so casually, but the boy had been healing over the past few months and he had been able to mention Sirius in casual conversation more frequently with each passing day. “That’s a pretty good idea, we’ll need to go with a few of us, or else we’ll have to find a way to bring it all back on our own.”
The rest of the day was spent with the three of them spending time together. Draco's things were delivered and they moved him in as well as moving Hermione in with things that Ginny helped fetch for her from her apartment that she’d shared with Ron. Neville hadn't come back until late that night. He had turned Ron in and then gone straight to work on the necessary legal documents to keep them safe. He had been surprised to see the vow that Harry had taken sitting on his desk already. Normally things like that took longer to process, but Kingsley's unmistakable seal shone brightly on the parchment and Neville was glad because that meant one less thing he needed to do. By the time the sun set that night everyone was tired and dinner was a short affair of sandwiches and pumpkin juice before everyone retired for the night.
“You lot will have to get them out of here through the back door. There is an apparition point not to far from here, but the village itself is being heavily monitored. I’m surprised no one has come since your arrival.” The unmistakable voice of Aberforth was gruff with sleep. Severus realized then that he had no notion of just how late he had dropped in on the old barkeep.
“Wretch or not, he’s still a being with feelings.” Hermione protested, though she knew that there wasn’t any hope. It was their best chance at finding the real locket and that was more important at this point. “That being said I understand that this is probably the only option. If we do this, I think that Pansy and Draco should be the only ones in the room with Harry because they are less likely to set him off. We know how he feels about us.”
"Well Harry set up the password and the rooms, It wouldn't do to lock him out." Godric winked cheekily in response and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
"Are you sure you've tried everything?" Draco asked gently. He could tell that his lover was more than a little frustrated by the whole situation and he wasn't about to try and test him.
"I thought you said it made no sense to make enemies of people who should be your friends?" Draco questioned, using Harry's own words against him. Draco was leveling him with a scolding look that would have made Mrs. Wesley proud. Instantly Harry felt ashamed and he colored under the boy's harsh gaze.
"I have! Neville has, hell even Hermione has! We've all grown up Ron and moved past school. We're all adults now and we can look past our history with Malfoy, but you can't. You haven't changed one bit." Harry growled, his feet rooted to the spot. A part of him, the dormant one that fed off of hate that had taken over during the war, was screaming to be set free and teach his ignorant friend a lesson.
"We are, My Lord." Mr. Greengrass said in his silky smooth, diplomatic voice. "We are so very glad our family could be of service." He too bowed, though much lower than Nott Sr. had which more than pleased Voldemort, but angered the other Death Eater.
"Rationally? Tell me what is rational about this situation?" Severus screamed back, staggering back into the chair he often sat in.
As he had predicted the wall behind him closed as soon as he moved further into the room, cutting him off from the hall which lead back toward Dumbledore. It could have been his youth and overconfidence, but he felt no fear, being locked in the cavern alone. He knew snakes, could handle them, and was more than certain that this test would be easy. Voldemort would have built it not expecting the person who would come to face these creatures to be able to speak to them. Harry had an advantage that he would be wise to use it.
Severus had seen Draco come in and while the potion he was working on was so simple that even the first years could do it properly, he was a potions master for a reason and he hadn't risked taking his eyes off his work to greet the boy. He knew that Draco would understand however and was pleased to see the boy start to gather more ingredients and start up a batch of his own. Draco set up his own work station and began the prepping stages for the potion before putting a cauldron on and adjusting the temperature.
Draco returned to his temporary home at half past seven. He had gotten caught up in his meeting and hadn't realized that he would be late for dinner. When he arrived he was surprised to find the kitchen empty though he could hear the unmistakable voice of Harry coming from the second floor.
"If they can't keep up then they don't deserve to be here." Harry replied through gritted teeth. He was on edge and everyone could tell that something was bothering him, though no one dared asked what.
"Well when you say it that way." Harry's mouth met Draco's neck faster than the blond could blink and he threw his head back in pleasure, allowing Harry better access to the pale skin. Harry continued down the path of his neck to the back of his shoulders, making sure to nip and lick along the way. He wasn't going to go much further, he meant what he said about going slow, but the noises that Draco was making were simply intoxicating. Plus, slow was such a relative term.
"I don't mean to make you worry." Harry buried his face even further into the nape of Draco's neck taking in the boy's minty sent. It seemed to instantly calm him and he took another breath before continuing. "I just realized with everything going on, I've completely forgotten about Sirius."
The answer was enough for Draco. He made his way to Harry's bed slowly stopping to stand next to it, "May I?"
before seeming to make up his mind. "I'm going to head down to dinner early, I have something to take care of after so don't wait up for me. Professor Dumbledore will no doubt want to speak to me after this afternoon."
"Master Harry Potter Sir!" The shrill voice of Dobby pulled Harry from his dangerous thoughts and he composed himself in time to look up and see Dobby standing at his bedside. "Master Harry Potter the guest is cooking dinner and asks you to join him."
“Sh, it’s okay, Harry,” an eerily familiar voice soothed and gentle hands ran up and and down Harry’s back. “Everything is okay, nothing can hurt you here.”
“You know exactly what!” Draco complained when Harry moved lower, but skipped his crotch entirely in favor of biting and kissing his thighs.
It didn't take Draco long to unpack. He hardly had anything to his name since the end of the war. His apartment had been modestly furnished at best. He didn't make much as a clerk and he had very few personal belongings beyond his family heirlooms. Those were all locked away at Gringotts, both for safe keeping and because Draco was lacking in the family pride department ever since his father's embarrassing arrest shortly after Voldemort's fall. He wondered what his old man would think of his only son running to Harry Potter for help. The thought made Draco snort in an undignified manner and actually made him laugh a little. He had been freed of all charges after the war, mostly due to Harry speaking on his behalf in front of the Wizengamot, but that didn’t stop society from doubting him and his mother. Draco would like to have thought that it was only his father's bad name that had brought aurors to his apartment, banging down his door and demanding that he leave while they conducted their search, but he knew that he had also made some very questionable decisions during the war and he would just have to live with that.
“I know,” she spoke so softly that even with her mouth pressed into his neck it was hard to hear her. “Draco’s magic. I know.”
"It didn't take long after the war for us to realize that something was wrong. The spark was gone. We didn't have anything to talk about when there wasn't evil to fight. We stayed together because we were too scared to face life without the other. We had been inseparable since the age of eleven! We weren't about to try to face a post-war world alone. The engagement was our way of shutting up Mrs. Weasley. Don't get me wrong! I love that woman to death, but she was starting to ask questions and at that point Ron and I had come to an unspoken agreement that it was just easier to pretend that we were together than to go through the public break-up we had hoped to avoid. We've been engaged for almost two years now. We were suppose to start wedding plans, but then the raid happened. Part of me wonders if Ron planned all this to get away from the planning." Hermione stopped and turned to Draco looking horrified. "I am so sorry, I tend to ramble when I'm upset, I'm sure you didn't want to hear all that. What do you care if my relationship is in shambles. Not that I'm saying that you're not caring-"
“Good morning, love.” Ginny sang, swopping down to drop a kiss on his cheek before playfully sashaying to the kitchen. “Or afternoon, I suppose.”
"So that day when you saved Draco from Nott, I wasn't imagining that I saw more magic than you should have had floating around you?"
"Wonderful, Miss Granger. Five points to Gryffindor. Now I don't expect all of you to be able to produce a full patronus right away, but I want to get you started on the theory behind it. I understand that this is a hard spell to master because it takes more than just your magical ability, you truly have to think of the most happy memory you have and channel that energy into the spell. This type of magic tends to be harder for younger witches and wizards because you must be in control of not just your magic, but also your emotions. Today we're going to go into more of the theory behind it as well as techniques you can use to help you. When we meet again next week, we will move onto the practical portion of the lesson. That will give you plenty of time to research and practice over the weekend."
now is it?" Severus watched him with a calculating stare, but Draco wasn't about to break under his gaze.
"I don't know." Harry answered. The sincerity in his voice seemed to be enough for Draco and the blond relaxed.
"Sorry, we had a row this morning and he's still sore." Hermione said simply, though her tone conveyed that Ron wasn't the only one still upset.
Motioning to the room beyond the one they were in, Harry moved towards the doorway, not once alerting the old wizard. It seemed that Ron’s assessment of his age had been correct and the few moments of true clarity that aging man had were few and far between. Harry was curious as to why he didn’t seem to see Harry, but he didn’t dare question the brief stroke of luck.
Harry thought, glaring at Ginny. "Accio John Donne poetry collection." The book flew to Harry's hand and he took to the floor, leaning against the settee allowing himself to be very close to Draco while seeming to not notice him as he began to delve into his book.
"Honestly, love, you're not really that oblivious I hope." Ginny rolled her eyes. "He didn't move, didn't stop you, not once and I could almost see the tension between the both of you all day. Obviously he wants you."
Harry let the words sink into his bones, settling into his mind until they very nearly became a part of him. “Can you be both? Can you be good and great?”
"I like you too, I thought my patronus changing would have proven that." Draco rolled his eyes, leaning into plant a sold kiss on Harry's full lips. "You're not pressuring me into anything, I want this, whatever it is, just as much as you do."
"Honestly, can you all behave? We’re in the middle of class, a dangerous one I might add.” Harry rolled his eyes, focusing back on the task at hand. He knew that Ron could be impossibly childish, but he was honestly very surprised, and a bit upset over Hermione's catty attitude. He was sure that after their short talk the night before she would have left him alone, but it seemed that the know-it-all couldn't help herself.
“Well we’ll have the time to do it, I don’t think anyone should be leaving the grounds for the time being. It won’t be safe.” Hermione spoke again, whatever annoyance she had just recently shown seemed to be gone, dissolved in the face of learning something new. “Let me take the locket down to the basement, your four should go get some rest.”
“Oh good, I think if we can get some of the others in on it, I might get away with not having to do any the planning. Between classes and all of the extra lessons we’ve been teaching I think I’d cry if I had to plan a party on top of it.”
"I am relieved to hear this My Lord, I was beginning to worry, you know that I wish to be by your side completely, but I understand why this charade must be kept up."
Harry was sitting with Ginny, Blaise, and Ron pouring over more books in the library when the patronus of a fox appeared before them. George’s voice came from the small creature as it spoke. “Harry, he admitted to stealing the locket and he said he sold it to a wizard named Artikus Bruch.”
"I would like to hear your plan further. It's decided. The rest of you are dismissed. One last thing though," Voldemort's face contorted into a look of maniacal delight. "Along with Potter and his friends, young Draco will now join the ranks of your top targets. Remember I only want Potter alive, he's mine to finish. But if you capture any of the others they are useless unless they have information. Kill them." A very feminine gasp rang clear in the open room and red eyes glared down at Narcissa Malfoy.
"I agree, though I don't see why this is coming up now, I don't think that anyone who's been previously cleared should have to succumb to more background checks. You know this is out of Kingsley's hands, though. This is more about the Wizengamot. You know those old wizards and witches can't let go of their ways." Harry reasoned, looking over to Draco, noticing that he seemed uncomfortable with the subject topic. Oh right, he once was one of the wizards that I would have prosecuted without another thought.
"What?" Pretty much every person in the room asked in unison, save Pansy and Luna, the latter looking very nonplussed and rather as if she had been expecting as much.
“What’s wrong, love?” Draco asked softly and Harry shook his head, trying to rid his mind of the sleep induced fog that hung behind his eyes.
"Thanks." The wavering in Draco's voice was obvious and he looked to Harry first before continuing. "Again I'm so sorry for all that I have done, but I want to move past that and prove that I am not that person." He stopped again and this time Blaise began to speak.
"Harry where have you been?" Just as the boy expected Hermione and Ron sat waiting for him in the common room. The whole room was empty, most likely because the two had cleared it which meant that the rest of the students were waiting near the stairs listening.
“I don’t get it, what’s happening?” Draco hissed when the three made it out of the Great Hall and into the main entrance way. “I’m not stupid, I know there is something happening, but Harry kept insisting that it was just a dream. What could be so bad about a dream? And why did he need Hermione and Sev?”
The fake Draco pulled itself fully from the crate, lifting each leg over with difficulty. He wore torn Slytherin robes, though he was missing a tie and the customary sweater was ripped enough that the dirty white button up shirt was fully exposed. Instead of appearing weak, the effort the bogart put into pulling itself from its box made it seem creepy and set Harry’s nerves on edge. It took a moment to look the boy who lived up and down once before it began to speak. “You left me Harry. You let the Dark Lord hurt me and you LEFT ME.”
“The sixth one is Nagini, I’ve noticed that she felt different in recent months. I can’t be certain who he killed to create it, but I am certain it’s the snake.” Severus offered up the little bit of information he had on the topic.
"You're not the only one, Severus was always horrible at cooking." Draco said, rolling his eyes at old, fond memories.
"You're not going to tell me to be careful, threaten me if I hurt him, or tell me not to get involved with him?" Draco was amazed when Hermione only continued to laugh, this time sounding light and genuine.
"What's that boy's name?" Draco asked as the group touched down. Harry was standing so close to him and Draco had to fight off the blush that was trying to make its way up his neck. He wanted so badly to take the boys hand, or even lean into him to know that things between them were still okay.
"Then it was a harmless prank. You know as well as I do that students get testy this far away from home, especially in the beginning of the year. As long as Miss Weasley is alright, then report the incident to Professor McGonagall and then let it rest."
“It’ll be any day now, the Dark Lord is just waiting for the spell to be perfect.” One of the Lestrange brother’s spoke and Harry stopped in his departure to listen in. He could tell from the slight shimmer of magic where he knew Severus to be that he was still doing the deadly dance of getting close enough to Bellatrix without getting caught.
With his small words of encouragement, the group as a whole seemed to breath out a great big sigh of relief and soon there were small murmurs of conversation traveling around the room. Draco, Harry and Blaise each stood by one of the tables, leaving one group of students unattended. Seeing this, Severus left his perch at his desk and walked over to the group of fifth year Gryffindors. He smirked internally when the held back from flinching. He was almost proud.
“Would that really be wise? It seems easy to stumble upon.” Harry asked, skeptical that someone so powerful would be so obvious.
"What do you think?" Harry asked as he looked over his group despondently. "I don't think we have any chasers in my group.
“I think we need to bring the twins in on this. They are on the outside and I trust them to get the job done.”
"Thank you, Rachel, I will have to commend him for his insight." Harry smiled back. The young witch had never ogled over him and he was glad that he didn't have to deal with an adoring fan every time to call.
Sirius smiled then, blindingly, and Harry had his answer before he even responded. “You can Harry, you most certainly can. Now I think it’s about time you wake up in your real body, don’t you think?”
Harry wasn't really paying attention to the conversation. It had changed to wedding plans and while he was happy that Draco was more comfortable, he didn't have any of his own insights to add so he sat and enjoyed his dinner instead, savoring the feeling of having a full house again. He couldn't remember the last time there had been more than just him at the dinner table at night. Neville was often at the Weasleys or out with Ginny. Brushing Draco's leg with his hand had been an accident, though he did notice that the blond made no move to push him away or even acknowledge the contact in the slightest. Maybe I should try again, but maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way.
"Bloody hell." Was the only response Harry got and he chuckled, pulling Draco closer. The blond tried to keep his eyes open, he wanted to repay the boy in kind, but sleep was insistently tugging at his consciousness.
“Then what do we do?” Harry hardly thought there was any choice, they would have to find a way to undo the spells or trick the system.
"That may be so, but who will they put in his place? There are many corrupt men in on the board, there are too many of them who are connect to the Dark Lord. I shudder to think who they would find as a replacement." The color drained further out of his face and the four in front of him were completely thrown off by his reaction. They weren't scared for the fate of the school, but with the way that Severus was carrying on, they also began to worry about the direction that the school and the war would take if death eaters were able to take over Hogwarts.
"Here, do you want butter beer or pumpkin juice?" Hermione stepped between them, defusing the situation. She had a tray of drinks in her hand and she was putting them in the center of the table. Ginny was on the other side of the table with snacks that they had just prepared.
“He knows a lot of people in the underground and would not have looked out of place in Knockturn Alley. I suppose they believed him to be a necessary evil, but the fact is that he is an idiot and a coward and he holds no true value to the Order. They let in men like him, but kept us out on the basis that we are children and too young to be exposed to the war.” Harry said, not able to keep the bitterness from his voice.
"Only if you let me make you lunch." Harry agreed allowing Ginny to floo to his home first. She had practically lived in his home after the war and the wards were set to recognize her as someone who lived there so he didn't need to go before her to adjust them.
Once they both calmed enough to separate, Severus walked over and set the mug of tea in Narcissa’s open hands. The two men watched her sip the drink, gently reminding her not to drink too fast, lest she upset her delicate stomach. Words weren’t necessary as the three sat, Narcissa and Severus on the lounge, and Draco happily on the ground at their feet, and enjoyed the simplicity of the other’s company. Despite the war that raged on outside their walls, the small if someone misfit family found joy in each other’s company.
"It is really nice." Draco agreed, but he was smiling directly at Harry making the other boy blush. "It's nice to feel at home here."
He had returned from their meeting knowing more about Voldemort’s plan, however, and he found that it helped him little. He had known that Draco had never been the intended murderer, but he had never thought that Voldemort would task him to strike down the old wizard. Things must be becoming drastic if Voldemort thought that having Severus openly turn on the Light was necessary for his plans. He would have to report his findings to Dumbledore, but he supposed that he deserved a stiff drink first if nothing else. Of course that would be the moment that a panther patronus leapt through the door and sat in front of him with expecting eyes.
Boneless and spent, Draco let his body fall onto Harry's. Just like the powerful wizard had promised, he undid his own bonds and wrapped his arms securely around his mate.They lay there for what seemed like hours, trying to catch their breath and waiting of their heart beats to slow.
” The spell shot through the air and shattered the shield. The force of the two spells rebounding knocked Ginny off her feet once again and she fell back, her wand gripped tight in her hand. Draco watched her from the other side, not willing to move. This was meant to be a friendly competition and while he wasn’t going to throw in the towel to check and see if she was okay, he didn’t want to hurt her.
"You sure you're ready?" Harry asked, removing his fingers and making sure to coat himself generously to make sure that Draco felt as little pain as possible.
"And I share you with Ginny, it's only fair." Draco shot back and allowed Pansy to keep his arm around his waist, sticking his tongue out at his boyfriend.
When they made it fully into the common room it was obvious that everyone had scattered since Draco had left them earlier that morning. Hermione was reading by the fire, Ron asleep in her lap taking over the rest of the couch. He assumed that Blaise and Ginny where in the boy's room, Luna, Neville, Seamus, and Dean where nowhere in sight. Hermione looked up as soon as they entered the room completely, her eyes trained on the person behind Harry that she would not quite see.
"I was a student once, too." Snape's smirk was answer enough and every person in the room suddenly had more respect for the man. "Keep them safe, Potter. I'm sure you'll be hearing from me soon." Snape took his leave then, presumably to try and get a lead on the person who threatened Ginny.
"I told him that I had it, it was Harry that ended up knocking over all of the boxes, I swear that he's more klutzy than I am." Neville tried to sound affronted at Harry's teasing, but the smile that shined in his eyes gave him away.
"Where have you been mate? We were starting to worry." Ron greeted them and Harry instantly felt guilty. In his mad dash out of the castle, he had really only told Draco where he was going, while the others just had to guess.
"We need to have another DA meeting, and I know that most of the house is listening at the stairs, so I'm sure we will only need to inform the other houses. We will meet tomorrow, in the usual place at 10 o'clock. I will answer all your questions then." Harry was looking up at the stairs while talking, smirking when he saw the edges of robes disappear as the Gryffindors hiding there did there best to leave before being caught.
"Bloody hell that man is a menace." Ron muttered, shaking his head. "Poor bloke, I don't envy him. I'm going to hit the showers, I'll see you lot at dinner." Ron broke off from the group, Hermione and Blaise also took their leave for the castle, leaving Ginny and Harry behind.
"That was a really good demonstration." Neville said as he took down the protective shield and handed each girl goblets of water. "It's getting a bit late though, we might want to wrap up." Hermione nodded, taking the goblet gratefully and downing it in one go. Handing it back to Neville, she moved to the head of the room to wrap up the night since Harry was still busy with the potions lesson.
"It's okay, I'm not asking you to, I'm just letting you know that I am here for you when you're ready." The rest of the room had cleared by this point. Neither boy noticed that they where the only ones left or that everyone had signed the paper with no issues. The rest of the world melted away as they held onto each other. As much as Harry would have liked to bury his own insecurities, the ugly words and threats that his Uncle use to yell at him still came up to the forefront of his mind and haunted him. Nights like this night reminded him that he was loved. Normally he would find himself questioning why anyone would love him, but having Draco was starting to change all of that. Harry knew that when he was ready Draco would be there for him to bare his soul and start the much needed healing process. He also knew that Draco wouldn’t push him to speak before then and he was so grateful that he thought he might burst.
"So good of you to join us." Voldemort's voice sent shivers down everyone's spine, but only the lesser Death Eaters were weak enough to show it. The gentle hiss of Nagini, calling them out for their actions made many flinch, but Snape stood his ground, gracefully making his way to the center as the bodies parted for him. He walked straight up to Voldemort, his head held high, but his gaze down casted, until he dropped down on his knees, his eyes falling to the floor.
"You don't have to, I am fine with any room, as long as I have a place to sleep at night." Draco insisted, something in him didn't want to put Harry out of his way, he had already done so much for him and part of Draco agreed with Weasley, he didn't really deserve such great treatment from someone he had hurt so much in the past."
Aberforth wasn’t even in the room with them anymore to respond and the four looked towards the back of the room where the overly stuffed bookcase stood. On closer inspection, there were well hidden hinges and it was obvious that it swung forward, no doubt to reveal a hidden back door. They went out in pairs, Hermione holding onto Severus’ arm and Neville continuing to comfort and shuttle Narcissa on. As the four made it to the threshold of the pub, Hermione fished out two small bits of parchment.
“Are you asking me to go? When have you ever asked me something before? You have always expected that I follow your word and have I not done as I’ve been told?”
Draco eyed him wirily, waiting for him so say something. When Harry motioned for him to sit as well, he took it as a good sign and took a seat. Harry waited until he was comfortable until speaking again.
"I might not have changed," Ron bit back, "but do you really think this change has been for the best? Look at who you're letting into your house. Are you really telling me associating with
“We will leave from the Astronomy Tower.” He gave no explanation and the reason was hardly important to Harry who simply nodded and stood, following the old man without protest.
"That's not exactly something I can explain." Harry ignored the glares from the two and continued. "He came to me directly. That takes a lot of courage when you consider our past." Ron snorted at that, but Harry pushed on ignoring him as best he could. "He openly apologized, something I never would have thought possible. He was completely open with me, admitted that he was wrong and a total arse. He told me everything that he was tasked to do by Voldemort and then he followed me to Dumbledore to take his stand."
"Okay," was all Draco could manage. This time he knew that he was blushing and he could hardly fight it, much less form a lengthier response. Harry chuckled, he was beginning to really enjoy all of the small reactions he was getting from Draco. He couldn't help but think of all the ways he could tease and flirt with the boy to make the blush come back to his face or to make him lose his breath again.
"Well that can be ignored, can it not?" With a meaningful look, Harry waited for the creature before him to nod. "Good. Is there a more private place that we can wait?"
"Sometimes, Luna, you really worry me." Ron said under his breath, causing everyone but the Ravenclaw to laugh. It seemed to ease the tension that had still been present in the room, and Pansy actually smiled, which helped.
! Why are you suddenly defending him? What's your problem? Wasn't seven years of getting tortured by him enough or are you just a glutton for pain and anger?" Ron spat back. He was beyond being reasoned with and he didn't give a damn that Harry was a much more powerful wizard than he was even though he was the head of the auror department and Harry hadn't trained since the end of the war.
He started sucking and biting on the boy’s collar, ignoring his cock and bullocks entirely. Draco complained many times that he was being a tease, but they both knew that Harry was the stronger wizard and even if Draco tried to make him go faster, he wouldn’t succeed. After making sure to leave at least a few marks on Draco’s pale neck, Harry began to give his nipples the same treatment.
"I'm sure that can be arraigned." Harry took the man's smirk as a good sign. He had been afraid that he might have overstepped unspoken boundaries, but as glad to see that he hadn't. Even with everything that had transpired between the two over the years, they where able to sit together and have a civil conversation, something that Harry found himself incredibly grateful for.
"You really do care about him, don't you?" Blaise sounded surprised as they reached the portrait to his rooms. Harry waited for Blaise to let them in before responding.
Harry looked into the eyes of someone he had seen only as an enemy for so long, searching for any ill intent. When he saw none he let out the breath that he'd been holding. Warily nodding more to himself than to Draco, Harry seemed to come to some sort of conclusion before speaking.
." The chilling calmness in which the curse was cast was even more frightening than Bellatrix's obvious madness. As Lucius fell to the floor in agony, screams ripped from him causing his raw vocal cords to scream in pain, his only thought was that at least Narcissa wasn't alone, at least he could share in her torture.
After another five minutes passed, Snape was about to get up and search for the man when the door to the office banged open and the aging wizard strolled in looking very troubled. Snape stayed quiet while he watched the powerful man set a fire in the hearth without so much as looking at it. He continued on into the room and as he got closer, Snape felt unbelievable dread fall over him. When the man stopped at his desk, he dropped a small object on the surface before taking a seat looking more tired than Snape felt. The Potions Master watching the object carefully, it looked like a ring, but the dark magic that it radiated made his skin crawl.
Draco didn't respond, though he heard the feral growl that that left Harry's lips. He was sure that no one else had heard him, but the boy was so close behind him that Draco could hardly miss anything he said or did. Steeling himself for the worst, Draco gave a jerking nod to his friends before following behind his Professor and Godfather, less than pleased with the man's poor timing.
Harry made his way to his new rooms with ease. Doing his best to keep in the shadows, he moved with a cat like grace. He had made it all the way up by the tower when he heard a small noise to his left that alerted him that someone was waiting there. Before he could turn around he felt the point of a wand in between his shoulder blades. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand at the back of his head kept him in place. If he really wanted to, he could overpower the person both physically and magically. It was obvious that it was a woman, the thin fingers tangled in his hair where soft and slender. As for the magical abilities of the witch, Harry could feel them faintly without seeking them out, but he still could tell that he was more powerful.
"I never wonder about his personal wellbeing." It was childish at best, but Severus was not going to start talking about feelings especially those of a boy he could hardly care less about.
"There is an alcove just like this just outside the portrait. Wait for us there. We will be by in ten minutes."

Harry felt Severus’ magic move in the direction of the crowd about the crazy witch and Harry was thankful to be given the less difficult target, not that he couldn’t have handled himself, but Severus knew these wizards well and would have had an easier time moving around them without getting caught. The younger wizard made quick work of cutting off the tips of several of Rodolphus’ hairs to be certain they had enough before he started to retreat.
Harry barely heard the score, he was so focused on finding the snitch. A quick glance told him what he had already assumed, the other seeker was clueless and seemed to be flying in fast circles around the pitch. He wasn't patient, but he was fast, Harry would have to use that to his advantage. It wasn't until the score was Gryffindor 70-20 that Harry first saw the elusive golden ball with wings. It seemed that Harper saw it too, however, and while he was was closer, Harry knew that he could fly faster if he just paced himself. Taking off at breakneck speed, Harry barreled past the smaller boy, taking off after the prize, tuning out everything around him. He expected Harper to try to out fly him in the end, which was why Harry was flying so fast, though not the fastest that he was capable of. He knew that Harper was right beside him, but that didn't matter. Picking up speed, Harry gripped his broom tight and lay his body out so he was almost flat across the wood. He was going much faster than Harper at this rate and he knew he would be able to stop safely if he could just catch the damn thing. As his hand reached out he barely heard the collective gasp from the stands before his fingers curled around he snitch. He came to a near instant stop to complete silence. What had happened? Hadn't he just ended the game? Why was the entire pitch dead silent? Harry looked down to the floor of the pitch and his blood ran cold. There, lying on her back like a fallen angle, was Ginny. This time Harry took off even faster, not caring that he was barely giving himself enough time or space to come to a safe landing. He saw a few figures making their way to the girl and all Harry wanted was to get there before them. Madame Pomfrey was the first to reach Ginny, but Harry was a close second. She immediately started running diagnostic spells.
The door to the library burst open and Harry and Draco quickly jumped apart. The tense air in the room mounted to a new level as they both watched a very frazzled looking Neville enter the room, looking for something. "Oh I'm sorry, I forgot-" The other wizard seemed to understand what he had just interrupted and simply retrieved his work robe with his wand in the pocket before exiting just as quickly.
The unmistakable sounds of multiple pairs of feet above them made both occupants of the small cellar hold as still as they could. The heavy rug was pushed off of the trap door, dislodging dirt and debris, causing the pair to become covered. Now that their hidden room had been revealed it was easy for Severus to understand the words being spoken above him.
Harry took a moment to simply stare at Dumbledore. From what he could tell he was telling the truth and there was little reason left to stall. “Alright I’ll go with you, but let me just send a patronus to Draco first. If I don’t come back to the rooms soon they’ll worry.”
Harry nodded and closed his eyes. He could feel the magic even though he couldn’t see anything worth mentioning. Of course the entire cave structure hummed with dark magic, but there was a higher concentration of it in this room, more so than in the first room and certainly more so than the weak amount of magic it had taken to house the bogart. It seemed that the strongest point of the magical signature was manifesting in the center of the room stretching from one unremarkable wall to the opposite one.

The three Slytherins nodded, holding on to Harry again, trusting him to keep them safe. They bounced through three more locations, each just a remote as the last, but this time the Slytherins didn’t ask where they were or how Harry knew about them. Their last stop was the vast fields just outside of their property.

"He won't hurt Mr. Malfoy, that's not something you have to worry about." Severus was about to argue, but a knock at the door interrupted him. "Come in, Minerva."
"Consider it payment for letting me stay." Draco shrugged and took a seat at the table as the jam and butter flew to the table.
She smiled at them kindly, if not a little tired, and Severus found himself nodding in agreement, not quite sure how to respond. She showed them up the stairs and down the hall two doors to the left. Neville had been following behind them, but turned off to a door on the right side with a small wave and muttered, “good night.”
"Harry's right." Hermione asserted firmly also turning back to her work, blushing in embarrassment at her behavior. The conversation ended and while Ron was still less than silently fuming, the rest of the lesson went by without an incident.
"Demelza Robins, she's a third year. We should have Ginny's group face hers and see how they work against each other." Harry left them to gather the first two groups and Draco and Katie touched down with the third group. "Okay I am going to release the quaffle and I want you all to give it your best. For this exercise we will have Cormac and Ron play as keepers." Harry called as he threw the quaffle up and instantly Demelza dived for the ball.
"Night." Draco said as he watched Harry leave, a slightly troubled look on the man's face. If Draco didn't know better he would have thought that Harry has actually been coming closer to him before that looked crossed his face. Draco pushed the thought aside and continued to sit staring at the dying candlelight, mulling over his own feelings.
"If I didn't know better, I would say it looks like you're flirting with Draco." Harry joked as he came up to the table. "I've got your timetables, McGonnagal said that all of your professors will understand if you don't have work done today if your class wasn't meant to have it due until tomorrow." Harry handed the two the pieces of parchment over, taking a seat next to Blaise. "And the team list is up in the common room, make sure to check it out when you have your free period."
"I still say that you should have held your tongue. If Snape finds out what we're doing before we've gotten control of the school this will all go under and
“Yeah. That sounds cool. For now, do you want to read me a story?” Harry liked the thought that his two best friends in life and he and the love of his life might share something together, but for now he just wanted to keep Draco to himself.
Severus landed in the clearing before opening his eyes to survey their surroundings. They had made it. Narcissa stood, bundled in her tattered clothes tight within his grasp. The light of the moon was all that aided them and the chill of winter wrapped its arms around the pair.
“We will have to go tonight. There is no time to waste.” The old wizard sat before him, not bothering to touch the food which was easily too much for just Harry. He might have been curious about this if he wasn’t confused by the old man’s statement.
"Good morning? It's just past noon!" Hermione cried exasperated, spelling clothes out of the dresser and onto his bed. "Get up and get dressed. We have a busy day ahead of us!"
"Draco, my son, I am so sorry." Severus' voice cracked several times, it was obvious from the raw sound that he had been crying for a while before he had made it to their rooms.
Hermione was the first to enter the common room, her face set and calm, while Ron stomped in behind her, his anger clear on his face.
“She was tired, I don’t think she could have hid it much longer,” Neville shrugged, though it was obvious that he was uncomfortable.
"Draco's right you know, this has to be him." Hermione nodded and handed it over to Harry. "Well, I suppose you're just going to have to confront him. He might ask why you're reading this magazine, but honestly I think you'll have him cornered, he really won't be able to talk himself out of this mess. Just say you'll go to Dumbledore about it, that ought to scare him."
Harry took a step back, blocking out his surroundings and began to think about his happiest memories. He knew that he would need to think of more than one to achieve the outcome he was aiming for. He thought of how it felt to sit amongst the Weasleys and truly feel like a member of a family. Memories of him, Ron, and Hermione laughing as they shared sweets while sitting by the lake at the end of every school year. He thought of the moment that he had thought that he would move in with Sirius and never have to go back to the Dursleys. He thought of Draco, everything about him, even their past and how overcoming that made him so happy with their present and their future. There were so many memories to choose from and not much time, so Harry did his best to put all of the love he had ever felt into the spell.
Harry woke up before the sun rose. Groaning, Harry rolled over, not sure what had woken him. The wards prodded him again, alerting him that someone was in his house. Carefully making sure to not wake Draco, Harry took up his wand and start down to the first floor. Through the wards he could feel that the person was in the sitting room. Making his way down he fell back into his ingrained instincts from the war. He knew that it wasn't a complete stranger, his wards wouldn't allow someone not authorized to enter directly into his home, but over the past five years many people had come and gone during parties and other meetings and Harry hadn’t had a chance to go through and clear the cache so to speak. He knew that the person was agitated. It was their raw, angry magic that had woken Harry in the first place. Slowly making his way down the stairs, Harry inched across the wall until he was leaning on the door with his hand on the knob. After taking one last calming breath Harry threw open the door flooding the room with light by silently spelling the drapes open to further surprise the person.
"If you keep that up, we might have to throw the whole going slow thing right out the window." Draco said, moaning in between words when Harry would massage a little rougher over certain spots.
"Make lunch for myself and Potter, make his favorite meal and have it sent to the master bedroom and as for me-"
The walk through the many caverns and halls was short, causing Harry a moment of pause to contemplate just how long they had spent in Voldemort’s cursed hideaway. Harry had been half expecting to see the sun rising as he eared the mouth, but was greeted by the same starry sky that they had left under. There was no time to waste and Harry ended the charm he had placed on Dumbledore, making sure to support the man and keep a tight grip on him. He had to believe that Hogwarts would let them in, the other option was too devastating to consider. With a final breath, Harry closed his eyes and envisioned the Astronomy Tower, willing the enormous power of his magic to take hold and guide them safely to their destination.
"Maybe we're all growing up a little." Luna said in her signature dreamy voice and the others just nodded, all too wrapped up in their own thoughts to comment. Across the room, Harry and Draco were none the wiser.
“I believe he has hidden a horcrux in the cave which he hurt those children from the orphanage in.” Dumbledore spoke as soon as they stepped out of the memories.
Slowly the room began to empty out until only Ginny, Harry, Blaise and Draco remained. It was nearing midnight and Harry was more than eager to return to the dorms and go to bed, but the look Ginny was throwing him made him hold back. He hadn't been able to get out of talking to Ron and Hermione and something told him he would also have to talk to the youngest Weasley as well.

“I know you have more magic than you are letting on. If you stop pretending for once and use all of the magic I know you have at your disposal we will have enough strength between the two of us to break this barrier spell.”
“Mundungus Fletcher,” he spat and Harry growled. He knew the others would not know the name, but he was not in the least bit surprised to hear that the old thief stole from Sirius while he was forced to appear for Order meetings.
"It's okay, Bill. We're in a bit of a rush, if you don't mind. I don't need any tea anyways." Harry reassured, smiling at the affronted look that Bill gave him. He really was Mrs. Weasley's son.
“There is a barrier there.” Harry pointed to the empty air with his wand. He dare not cast any spells or touch the invisible barrier until they had a better understanding of what its purpose was.
"Well you see, Ginny gets her temper and her quick hexing skills from her mother." Harry supplied, laughing at the glare set on the girl's face. "So what Ron means is maybe we'll get to see Mrs. Weasley chew Dumbledore out."
"Blimey Harry, we're going to be unstoppable!" Ron, the new keeper, cried from across the room where he was standing with Dean and Seamus, the teams newest beaters.
It seemed that he might have been a professor of sorts and he brought them fully into his sitting room, conjuring chairs with a lazy wave of his wand. The wards alone were proof that the disheveled man before them was stronger than he appeared, but that small feat of magic made Harry tense. This man was not one to trifle with.
"What do you mean he ordered the raid?" Hearing Harry's raised voice, Draco followed it to the library. Peeking his head in he realized that he was having a fire chat with Hermione. He almost made his presence known, but stopped when he heard Hermione's next words.
"Oh alright, just this time." She stood and pulled Blaise up as well, easily transfiguring the couch into a large queen bed. "I'm just going to freshen up and then I think I'm off to bed." She kissed Blaise gently on the cheek before heading off to the bathroom.
"No I think I will, it will be interesting and I always wondered what the Great Harry Potter was teaching his followers." Blaise mocked and Draco glared at him.
"I would rather not say for now, if it is all the same." Harry said, not averting his eyes from the dark ones studying him. Snape saw no reason to distrust the boy so he simply nodded.

"As droll as this small talk is, why are you here? Checking up on us per the Headmaster's orders?" Blaise spoke bluntly, something Harry appreciated. It was refreshing to have a conversation with someone who wouldn’t simply dance around him as if openly addressing the topic at hand would set him off.
"Are you getting tired Gin? We'll leave if you want to rest." Hermione offered noticing that not all the color had returned to her face yet and she was looking rather worn out.
unharmed. Harry didn't put it past the people searching his house to destroy the place. The problem with the auror department since the end of the war was that many of those with actual experience had retired. Many of those still in the field were young and held grudges against anyone connected to the death eaters even if they had been cleared by Harry Potter himself as Draco had been very publicly right after the war. Harry knew that the men meant well, but they still didn't have the field experience to understand that not everyone who had ties to the dark arts was necessarily a threat, nor did they deserve the way many of the young aurors, Ron included, treated them.
The boy picked it up gingerly, just staring at it for a moment. Draco stood by his side, allowing him whatever space he needed. When Harry was done, he outstretched his hand so he was reaching out of the window and set the crane off with a silent spell. He stepped back fully into the tower and felt as Draco's arms wrapped around his waist from behind. More silent tears fell from Harry's eyes as the pair watched the crane soar farther and farther up into the sky, until they could no longer see it.
"We might as well go in and talk to Dumbledore about all of this." Harry extended his hand and when Draco took it, he pulled the boy up with ease as if he hardly weighed a thing. "Are you sure you want to publicly switch sides? Your life will
"You might want to lighten up, Harry, if you want to have a team left." Katie tried to reason with the boy, puling up beside him.
At this many of of the Ravenclaws put their hands down. All of the members of the DA kept their hands up, however, which made Harry smile all the more. He knew that it was a very tough spell to cast and that he had been teaching it to kids who were too young to learn it, but he had learned it at the tender age of thirteen so he had faith in his peers.
"Will he be taking over as leader?" It was another good question, one that the six hadn't actually given any thought.
“That I am not sure of, my boy. I wish I had more to give you, but that is all that I know about the matter.”
"Don't worry, Zabini, it's just a privacy agreement to protect all of the members, but we can talk about it more later, I'm famished." Harry turned and saw that Ron was nodding in agreement to the idea of food and Harry couldn't help but chuckle. "Come on, we have the rest of the night to bicker as much as you want, I just want to eat first."
"For now just look after Potter. I will keep an eye on Albus for you and report to you via the portrait in your chambers."
Harry found the story about the three brother’s fascinating, though the description of the invisibility cloak was unsettlingly like his own.
"Good." Draco smiled back, snuggling deeper into the hug, reaching out to pull Hermione into the hug as well. He was never one for touching, intimacy had never been part of his childhood, but being with Harry and seeing just how much Hermione was going through he found it easy to hug the girl that only a day ago he’d barely known.
The energy was dark, darker than anything he had ever felt and he had faced Voldemort head-on. Dumbledore had already proven that hate could not destroy hate. He wouldn’t have thought about it in such a way, but his conversation with Sirius had made something very clear, love would always conquer over evil.
“That would be brilliant, when this is all over I want to focus more of my time on that, I could really use the help.” Neville blushed under the kind words, but he looked proud. It was a good look on him.
"Draco, you should probably join us, if you need a broom I'm sure there are extras in the shed, but we're going to need more than two people to run the try out." Katie said and surprised the four sitting before her. Katie had never been one to be mean to the Slytherins, but she hadn't really been nice to them either. Her invitation was more than that as it clearly said that she had no problems with him, or with Blaise, and that she accepted that it was possible for them to really change for the better.
Harry's mind was whirling. He knew that Voldemort feared Dumbledore so it made sense that he would have wanted him dead, but why choose a boy when he himself had never been able to complete the task? Why send a child on such a dangerous task that they could not complete, only to have them return and receive a most harsh punishment.
All other barbs were lost when the crate slid open on its own. The heavy wood lid separated from the rest of the crate and toppled to the floor with a loud
The two made their way from the Room of Requirement to their common room at breakneck speed. Luckily classes still hadn’t let out and they made it back to their portrait with little interruption. Harry hissed the password while Draco was catching his breath and then he all but dragged Draco up to their room.
“Ginny's very strong, I would think she'd make a great chaser." Katie nodded in the direction of the red-head who was flying circles around her peers and easily taking control of the quaffle and speeding off towards the goal.
Draco stood at the door of the library watching the entire scene. He had felt something shift in the air while he had been reading and suddenly felt the need to leave the room he was in. When he saw the look on Harry's face he instantly understood. In the case of a very powerful wizard or witch, the protection of their home was linked directly to his or her own magic. That meant that as long as the owner of the home was doing well then the house would be one of the most protected private properties in all of Wizarding London, even if they weren't actually home. This also meant, however, that if the owner was feeling particularly strong emotions then everyone in the radius of the house's protective shields would suddenly feel whatever it was that the owner was feeling. He stood silently while Harry and Ron fought, amazed at the sheer control Harry seemed to have on his own magic, Draco had honestly been afraid for a moment that Harry would lose control and the house would begin to crack under the weight of so much raw magic, but when he realized that it was Harry, that he had nothing to worry about, he focused his attention in Weasley instead, doing his best not to interject and teach the idiot a lesson.
"Do you think you can get us more information? I mean I know that they must be treating you horribly there, but if you can stick around maybe even for a little bit more than we will be able to have a better idea of what they are up to and maybe even come up with a plan to stop them." Ginny suggested.
"It's late, love, go to sleep and we will have plenty more time to get to know each other in the morning." With a flick of his wrist, Harry dimmed the candles in the room and drew the curtains around the bed. Draco shivered at the feel of the raw magic that surrounded him. He drifted into sleep easier than he had in a long time, knowing without a doubt that he was safe in Harry's arms.
"Yeah, nothing to worry about." But Draco was worried. He wasn't an idiot, he knew he was developing some level of feelings for the brave Gryffindor and that was what was scaring him.
“You looked so relaxed, I thought I’d let you sleep a little longer.” Draco smiled, just happy to be so loved by someone much less someone as amazing as Harry. “But I’ll wake you up next time.”
Draco Malfoy was stunned when Harry moved from his relaxed state, jumping up with his wand drawn and sliding easily into a battle stance, eyeing him warily. It seemed that he realized whom he was holding is wand to and faltered for a moment before thinking better of it and regaining his composure. Draco was sure that he had been quiet, but the boy had clearly still heard him. Because of who his father was, Draco knew all about what had happened to Harry and his friends at the end of the last school year and he was sure that he was staring the consequences of that night in the face. Harry looked more prepared to fight than ever and Draco was not about to test him.
Harry was not left to his own thoughts for long. Dumbledore emerged from behind a closed door looking serene as ever. His eyes landed on Harry without really seeing him before he took his own seat and making a show of preparing tea and arranging treats on a small plate.
"Yeah." The conversation died again as they both turned to their food, pretending to not acknowledge the tension in the room. Not for the first time that night, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what he was doing at his kitchen table having a snack with Malfoy like it was something normal to do. Then again, why did anything ever happen to Harry? Because the universe hated him, that’s why. Well after so many years of taking that shit, Harry knew better than to fight back, it was so much easier to hang on with both hands and enjoy the ride.
"I am not Dumbledore's man." Snape said with such conviction that the whole room fell silent again. "I am trying to talk to Draco, but he doesn't trust me. I was hoping to gain his trust to get closer to Potter and figure out what the boy is up to. I know that they are planning something. The filthy Gryffindors that follow him around have been buzzing with hope and life ever since Potter and his gang started to disappear at night again. I think that they are still meeting like they did last year. I hope to infiltrate the group and take them down. I can only do this if I gain their trust."
After they finished eating lunch, the groups went back to their jobs. Harry continued to oversee everyone and was more than impressed with the progress that they made. They stopped working when the sun began to set just as they had planned. The foundation for the house was set and the frame work was complete. It stood an impressive three stories and promised to hold more than enough rooms to house all of core Order members who would need a safe place to live during holidays. The walls were also in the beginning stages, the major hold up being the intensive magic that needed to be cast in each board to insure the house's protection was even better than Hogwarts could ever hope to be. After insuring that everything was packed up correctly and that the many protective spells around the lot of land were still working, the group apparated back to the shrieking shack and turned the time turner back to that morning.
"I don’t think so, prat.” Draco laughed, quickly sobering up, “no I want to go get my things." Draco sighed, pulling away from Harry to stretch. "Once I get fully moved in I'll let you try to convince me to stay in bed all day again." Draco winked his good mood coming back as quickly as it had gone. He laughed as Harry gave him his best pout face. "You know that won't work. Now are you going to join me in the shower or are you going to let me go all by my lonesome?"
"Sh, it's okay love. Ron and Ginny explained a little bit and I don't blame you, you should tell us what happened though." Draco whispered as if speaking any louder would spook the boy.
"I know I've just been following your lead all morning, Harry, but what is it you need from me?" Luna asked finally as Harry started to erect a fence around the land that now belonged to him.
“I know, but this is the only way,” Draco said as he stretched out his arm to take Harry’s hand in his. “Like Pansy said, we know how to talk to house elves. They might not be able to disobey you, but ones as old and as angry as Kreacher will know that their are loopholes to the rules. He will know how to hint at the right things to the right people unless you tell him specifically not to.”
"Thank you, Professor." Nott moved quickly from Snape to the Deputy Headmistress seeming to look for cover.
"Alright then, five points to Slytherin. Ah, Mr. Potter do you have more to add?" Harry's hand had gone up while his mates were laughing. He had seen Professor Williams go towards the front of the room again seemingly to move on with the lecture, but he knew that there was one more point that had been missed.
"Of course Mr. Weasley." Harry smiled, taking the lift that Mr. Weasley had just vacated up to the Minister's office. It took him straight to the Minister's office. Luckily he visited Kingsley often enough that he was allowed to take a direct lift rather than having to walk through the long halls and many security posts before he would be able to see his dear friend.
“Are you going to just stand there or are you coming in?” The croaking voice of an old man called from the open doorway and that seemed to settle the matter for the quartet.
"And just what might that be?" A voice from the door startled nearly everyone, but Harry who had felt more than seen another person enter the room. The level of raw magic hanging in the balance was nearly tangible and he was surprised that no one else had known that Snape had joined them.
"Yes, but if you are politician you should care more for your people then your own personal gain, you would have to have some Gryffindor in you for that."
"Of course not!" Ginny sounded aghast and Harry could only roll his eyes at the younger girls theatrics.
, but didn't know because no one would address it. He hadn't been in love with Harry when he'd first casted it, at least he was pretty sure that he hadn't. No he had to assess every situation and confront it head on. That was what he was meant to do because he was a Malfoy, he was
“The answer is I don’t know. I imagine that there are dark and dangerous defenses in that cave and I dare not guess for I am sure I will be wrong. As for what we will find, I am also not sure. I believe that he would have hidden a horcrux there, but I am not sure what that item might be. It would be something priceless and important in either his own or possibly Hogwarts’ history as he did treat this castle as his home.”
.” The light from his wand was so bright that Harry had to cover his eyes with one hand while he he made sure to hold his wand hand steady to direct the spell at the barrier. He used all of the dreams he’d had of his parents and what type of life he might have had, the love he would have felt, to give more power to the spell. The light seemed to last a lifetime and Harry only hoped that he might have felt enough love in his life that this would work.
"They trust you, love. And for good reason too." Draco said gently, feeling Harry tense at his words.
"Nothing to worry about, have a seat!" Before Harry could protest, the twins physically forced Harry into the unsuspecting cushion. Much to the boy's surprise, the cushion transfigured back into a large throne like chair. It was glittering gold quite lavish. The wall behind it also changed to a gold backdrop with strange decorative carvings. The chair itself was set up high and stairs appeared out of nowhere, placing the older students sitting by Harry on a platform above their younger peers. The ornate design seemed to be a throwback to ancient Egyptian times and Harry tried to stand up, but to his horror found that he was literally stuck to the chair.
"Potter, Dumbledore is correct, I can report this to McGonagall myself and we will meet you at Draco's to check on Miss Weasley." Harry would have protested, but the look Snape was giving him clearly said that he too was just as aggravated with the old man. They left the office together, Snape moving toward the direction of the Head of Gryffindor house's private quarters. Harry turned in the opposite direction to await the man's return and to get the answers to his many questions.
Draco thought that he was going to come right there. He had never seen anything hotter in his life. Without thinking, Draco began to strip off his clothing, leaving them in a pile next to him. He stood only in his boxers as he leaned against the door frame for support. Without hesitation, he pulled his own member from his boxers, stroking himself at the same rhythm as Harry, his eyes glued to the gorgeous man before him.
"Do you think she was the one who left the note on my locker?" Ginny asked, but Draco shook his head.
The conversation wasn’t over, but there also wasn’t much more to say. Harry knew that in the end Draco only had marginally more knowledge about these things than him, but he wasn’t sure who else to ask. It would have to be tabled with the list of mysteries that they had no answers for. Admittedly it was not high on that list, but Harry was intrigued by it none the less. They joined their friends still in a spell of silence, if the group noticed no one made comment. The rest of the break went by quickly and the invisibility cloak flew from Harry’s mind as the day continued on as normal.
Harry saw the opening for what it was. When Vipera lunged again, Jaculus jumped back and Harry used his expansive magic to cast a wandless, wordless
"That's probably the best thing I've heard all day." Harry grinned back, allowing Draco and drag him along until they were standing with the group again. When they finally rejoined the group, most had the decency to pretend that they weren't all just staring at the pair, but Hermione was giving them an indulgent smile.
"I'm hoping to have the construction done before the winter hols. If we're lucky, we can have it open for anyone who needs a safe place to stay. I know that I don't want to endanger the Weasley's by staying at the Burrow." If Luna noticed Harry's clear avoidance of his Godfather's home, she didn't mention it, but merely nodded.
While Draco was beaming and taking in all the positive attention, he failed to notice that Harry was watching him carefully as if he had just been handed a particularly difficult puzzle that he just wasn't sure how to go about solving. When the noise level died down and everyone went back to their own practicing, the smile returned to Harry's face, though their was a sparkle to his eyes that hadn't been there minutes before.
In the privacy of the locker room, both Harry and Draco were forced to see this situation at face value. Had this been Ron or one of his other mates, Harry would not have these butterflies fly around in his stomach, but he refused to overanalyze them. There would time for that later in the privacy of his well warded four-poster bed.
"I saw those in Mr. Zabini's notes, yes." Snape nodded, his eyes scanning that particular section again before allowing the boy to continue.
"Well that is what the Headmaster intended, but I'm here on a social call, I just wanted to make sure that both of you moved in without any complications."
After a murmur of agreement, the four making the journey stepped away from the group and out the front door. Even with their magical signatures keyed on the house and the power of Harry’s own magic, they did not think it wise to try and apparate from inside the house itself. The would risk leaving themselves and the others open for discovery and attack so they walked in silence to the gate to the far west of the property, where a magical doorway had been built to lead them out of the heavy wards to an area where they could safely apparate to and from. Harry held out his arms and Draco, Blaise, and Pansy moved in close all making sure to hold on tight as he apparated them to their destination.
A silver panther came slinking around the corner and sat in front of Harry without a sound. It appeared that Draco was going to keep him company even when he couldn’t physically be there. Harry couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face as his hand ghosted over the patronus. The rest of the journey was much more enjoyable with his companion. For once Hogwarts was silent and Harry tried his best to feel grateful for the change. He was very accustomed to believing that silence was a very dangerous thing.
The room vacated quickly. Ron, Seamus, and Dean left first, as they had no idea how to react to their most hated potions professor sobbing like a child. Luna and Hermione were not far behind, promising to help Harry clean up later, throwing worried looks back at the man on their way out. Blaise and Ginny hung back long enough to say goodbye, asking that Harry let them know when they could come back. Pansy lingered for just a moment longer, looking as if she wanted to stay, but thought better of it. By the time everyone was gone, Draco had moved with Severus to the couch. Even Sal and Godric went back to the hallway and Harry stood near the door, unsure if he should stay.
"No, that's Severus." Draco smiled genuinely. "But don't go telling people, you'll ruin his reputation."
“Yes, and good thing I was with Harry, they’ve had quite a night and even his magic has it’s limits.”
"Me, My Lord?" Snape was completely taken aback. He must be in the clear if Voldemort trusted him enough to allow him to take over such an important and powerful road.
"Well I speak for everyone when I say I'm glad that you can consider this home." Ginny smiled, knowing that Draco was hardly paying attention to anyone, but Harry. "And as much as I adore seeing you two make love eyes across the table, I have an essay to write before tonight." The unspoken understanding that there was going to be a DA meeting that night was obvious and Ginny bid her goodbyes, even going so far as giving Draco a chaste kiss on the cheek while winking flirtatiously at Blaise and then Harry. "See you boys later."
doesn't mean I did. I don't know why you want to know about these things Mr. Potter, but you best just forget it!"
The rest of the match followed in the same fashion. Ginny scored next, after also allowing the other two in her group time with the quaffle, and Demelza tied it up once again. After, Ginny regained control of the quaffle, though she tossed it to one of the boys in her group. The crowd sat on the edge of their seats as the boy raced through the air, taking his moment to shine as he made a particularly daring shot, making the final goal to end the match.
Harry couldn't help but smile to himself as he started out of his room and down the stairs. The wafting smell of dinner hit him when he left his room and he was extremely curious as to what had inspired Draco to cook for him once again. When Harry pushed the door to the kitchen open it took all of his self-control not to gasp. The kitchen was completely spotless, much unlike the mess that Harry normally left it in when he actually cooked for himself. The normal long table and benches had been shrunk down into a much smaller, more intimately sized and the benches were transfigured into chairs. There were candles lit in the center of the table and two places set to perfection. A bottle of Ogden's finest was open in an ice bucket in the center.
"I would have never guessed." Draco's old drawl had returned, but the slight upturn of his lips was genuine and Hermione ignored it entirely, favoring to spread a thin layer of jam on her own helping of pancakes, glancing at the unhealthy amount on Harry’s plate with disgust.
“There might be.” Hermione conceded. “Harry you can send your patronus and give it specific directions. You can tell it not to deliver your message until it is sure that Severus is alone. You’ve shown that your magic is powerful enough already I’m sure that it will work.”
A wailing from the corner of the room brought Severus from his musings. He often found it best to distance his mind from his body during torture sessions to keep himself from going mad. The abrupt sound had brought him back to the present, however, and he had to call on all of his willpower to keep himself from screaming in agony. It took him a moment to register that it was Narcissa wailing, which was odd because she wasn’t the one getting tortured.
"No one should give you any problems, but if they do don't hesitate to reprimand them." Harry nodded to Severus as he watched the rest of the room come together with relative ease. "Just make sure not to take house points, as it would be hard to explain the reason."
"It's Draco, and yes, sorry." Draco smiled kindly to the trio surprising them and buying him enough time to store his thoughts away for further investigation later.
"I can take care of myself." Ginny pushed her over-protective brother to the side and took her place next to Harry besides Hermione.
“Are you saying we could teach each other things about our cultures?” Harry was definitely interested in what Draco grew up reading and learning. He wasn’t sure that he could offer the same information. He had heard the classic fairytales before, but he couldn’t say that he remembered many of them. He was just as ignorant to what normal muggle children did as he was to what wizarding children did.
"That was very insightful and mature." Gryffindor's portrait startled them from his spot above the fireplace. "Sorry to bother, but Professor Snape and Draco are about to return and I figured that this seemed like a conversation of a private nature and that you would want to know."
Harry was just finishing ladling fresh homemade potato onion soup in bread bowls when the duo joined him. Wordlessly they helped him get spoons and a pot of tea, though Harry noticed that they interacted with ease as if they had done this before. He would have to ask Draco later what they had talked about in his absence, but whatever it had been it seemed to bring the two closer together.
The group of four rushed through the front door, nearly causing each other to fall in their haste, as they emerged from the small hut, the Dark Mark looming above them. In the distance, Harry could hear the popping sounds of arriving Death Eaters.
"Of course, that is no matter. They were hardly of any use anymore." Voldemort said while waving Severus off. Lucius began to seethe at the words, but the other two ignored him. "But what of Potter? How is it going trying to get in his favor?"
Class was winding down when Harry felt a hand brush against his upper thigh. Startled from his thoughts, he looked down to see a pale hand slowly climbing up his leg. His eyes followed the arm up until he was looking into the smirking eyes of Draco. Instantly he colored, making sure to hold perfectly still. If he moved even an inch, Draco's hand would come in contact with his growing erection and while he certainly wouldn't be opposed to that happening, he wasn't about to let it happen in the middle of class.
The thought made Draco feel even more sick and he slowly lay down, not even bothering to strip off any of his clothing, and fell into a restless sleep.
"Most suitable? This is the worst room in the house! Hell sticking him up in the sealed room next to mine would even be better! Ron couldn't you put aside whatever grudge it is you have against Malfoy just this once? The bloke really needed a room and he actually came to me for help so you give him the worst room in the house?" Harry's voice was low and the pure anger in it was enough to make even brave Hermione falter. Anger flickered in Harry's eyes and neither had seen the young man look that mad since the war.
"Gin, maybe you should stay on the couch tonight." Harry smirked and Draco couldn't help but laugh at his friend. "I think you're moving a bit too fast for Blaise." The boy in question began to splutter in protest, but Ginny merely pouted at Harry's words.
"I'm going to have to talk to him if we're going to get anything done, aren't I?" Harry asked. As much as he didn't want to have to deal with the man, he knew that he needed the information and he would have to be mature about the situation.
“Wow that nearly sounds normal,” Harry teased and Draco lightly punched him in the shoulder, though his smile gave him away.
"We saw it from the crowd, Snape was even trying to use an anti-curse just like he had when you were knocked off your broom. I'm telling you that someone is doing this intentionally, but I still don't think it's Pansy." Draco chimed in.
Harry paled considerably at his words. He moved from the bed faster than Draco thought he was able to in his current state and Draco followed after the boy filled with dread. By the time he reached the common room the entire core of the Junior Order was sitting around Harry. Severus was still obviously missing. Harry was situated on the couch between Ginny and Blaise and his brother moved aside for Draco to squish between them. When it seemed that everyone was settled all eyes fell on Harry and the both began to speak, albeit with a shaky voice.
"If you want to talk we can, but I understand if you don't." Harry let the statement hang between them before getting his own plate and tea, sitting opposite Draco.
"I'm sure I will be fine, I wouldn't want to bother you." Draco smiled, loving how Harry seemed to care so much about him even though he'd only been staying at his home for about a day. He figured that Harry was this good to all of his guests, but he hoped not at the same time. He wanted to believe that this kindness that Harry was showing was just for him.
that it honestly scared him. On a subconscious level, he knew that the reason the bonds broke the night before was because their bond, their love or whatever magic made it so they were tied as one soul, would not let Harry truly bind him when all he wanted was to get free to be closer to him. It was that feeling, that need to be closer, that pushed Draco on through the drafty halls of the old castle with Ginny, ever silent, at his side. There was something within him that was pulling him closer to his lover and he couldn't fight it any longer.
"I don't know mate, but I think you're going to have to figure this one out on your own." Draco stood, clapping his best mate on the back before pulling Harry up with him. "We're going to turn in too, behave Mate."
"Not now, we've spent too much time here and walls have ears." Draco glared into the empty hall before starting in the direction of their Head of House's office.
"They really are like the twins." Hermione rolled her eyes, but made no other comment. Though she might be a prefect, she often turned the other eye when it came to her boys. "Minus the dating obviously."
"I never thought of cooking like potion making before. I probably would have done better in Hogwarts, otherwise." Harry laughed at the thought, shaking his head more to himself than to his companion, but Draco chuckled as well.
"Did you test the locker for residue magic and get the same results?" Harry asked. It wasn't really a question, he already knew the answer and wasn't surprised when Snape simply nodded.
“Do you think that this will go over well?” Ron asked, voicing the worries that had been on all of their minds since the day before.
The rest of the dinner passed by without any other awkward moments. Neville opted to stay behind to spell the room clean and Ginny, Harry, and Draco retired to the library again. Ginny took the love seat on purpose only leaving the armchair by the fire and the settee.
"Blaise doesn't have to join me." It was the closest that Harry was going to get to him openly agreeing and he knew that. Sighing in relief, Harry nodded, looking to the blond's friend again.
"Harry's right." Hermione sat back down and Harry's words seemed to even sink into Ron and the red-head seemed to understand a bit more the relationship between his best mate and his former school rival. "I really am very proud of you." Hermione pulled Harry into a tight hug and the boy let out a breath that he hadn't realized how long he had held, knotted in his chest. He had missed this, he had missed his friends.
But Harry knew that last bit was just in his mind, that Malfoy had no way of knowing what had happened, what he'd lost and his guilt over the matter. Pushing painful memories aside, he faced the question at hand for what is was.
"Thanks Gin, Luna, you guys start up with your groups. Pansy I want you to stay with Hermione tonight, she will get you up to speed on the defense skills that we've been working on all year and from there she can give you more instruction."
" Throwing up a quick shield, Harry did his best to assess the situation in the few seconds that he had just bought himself. He was pretty sure that he knew who his attackers were, which meant that it had been Nott who he knocked over and the Greengrass girl who had just attacked him from behind.
"Patience, love." Draco chuckled, dropping to his knees. Harry watched through lidded eyes as Draco slowly took his cock into his mouth. The sight of the thin, pale lips parting to wrap around him drove Harry mad. It took all of his willpower not to grip Draco by the hair and force him to take him all. By the smug look he managed around Harry’s thick cock it was safe to say that Draco knew just had his mouth was doing to break down Harry’s will.
Harry was pretty sure that he would be sent to Azkaban by the end of the year. Maybe sooner, Hermione and Ron really were testing his patience. They were in advanced potions and the two were sitting behind him. Snape had made Draco his partner again, though in light of recent events it was much preferable to having to deal with one of his two best friends. Currently, they were stage whispering about his odd relationship with the blond beside him and while Draco didn't seem to mind, or even hear them, for that matter, Harry really couldn't deal with them anymore. Harry wasn’t surprised by Ron’s behavior, but he was more than a little surprised by Hermione going along with it.
Harry had heard enough, his family was in extreme and immediate danger. With a quick glance towards the door he confirmed that Severus had just made his escape back out into the cold. He wasted no time in moving through the bar and back out into the street. If he strained his hearing he could just hear the pop of Severus’ disapparating and he followed suite, taking his time to pop between seven different undisclosed locations before Harry found himself staring at his home, still invisible. He could see the ripple in the wards he knew that Severus had returned seconds before him. Harry made quick work of all the complicated spell he had cast to hide himself, his wards were strong enough that they wouldn’t have even let him in under so much concealment magic and then he nearly sprinted for the house. They had a very big problem on their hands and there was absolutely no time to waste.
"But there's nothing that can be done?" Harry asked annoyed, he knew that Kingsley couldn't just overturn the Auror Department but he was hoping something could be done.
“I am impressed that you have made it this far, but I assure there is still many more tasks to go before you find what you seek. This such task it not for the faint of heart. Before you lie two chests, one holds a key which you may find useful in your journey ahead, the other you will find a potion of my own creation. It is deadly to those already injured, magnifying all of your hurts and pains. There are no riddles or hints, you will select a box if you select the poison you will be forced to take it. If it is the key then you are free to move on to the next room. If you refuse to take the potion all of the oxygen will leave this cavern and the next person to try this foolish task will be the one to find your body.”
The first floor had been very easy to sort through. Because the main stair took up so much of the space the only rooms to really fix up were the kitchen, the sitting room, and the old family tree room. In the end they had left the kitchen just the way it had been though they repaired all of the broken furniture and added more candle holders to brighten up the room. The sitting room had also been easy. Harry was a very simple person and he didn't much like extravagant furniture. In the end they just transfigured the existing pieces to look more sleek and modern. The patterns in the cloth were updated and the stuffing replaced. All of the curtains in the home had been replaced well before so that left a lot less work for the trio. The old family tree room had been the most difficult for Harry, but in the end he decided to wipe the walls clean and instead put up his own family tree, including all of his dearest friends along with his own heritage. Much to his chagrin, Hermione had left the spot next to Harry’s name blank, hinting that there would be a time that he would thank her and so would his future spouse.
Severus made his way from his quarters to the opposite side of the castle. It was just past dinner and he had missed it. He wondered if stopping by the kitchens was possible, but he thought of Harry and the rest of the core who would be no doubt waiting for him and thought better of it. The boy’s message had been clear and he had sound scared, not a common emotion for the boy who had seen more in his lifetime than any person should. He would have to stop to care for himself after he spoke to the children and after he spoke to Dumbledore. The man was standing trial in a week and Minerva had taken over for him, but he still resided in the Headmaster’s quarters until he was called to the Ministry.
, but the icing on the cake for her was when Mipsy had joined Harry's growing staff of house elves. Harry hadn't intended on taking in another house elf, but Mipsy had been very close to Dobby at Hogwarts, once again Harry did not want to consider the implications of two house elves being
The core was sitting around in their usual places around the breakfast table on Saturday morning. They had plans to set out and work on the house, since it was a Hogsmeade weekend and they could easily slip off in the sleepy town. McGonnagal would have been the only professor that they would have had to be weary of, but she was staying in the castle more and more now and it was almost a given that she would not be supervising the trips that normally were her duty. All of the spells had already been researched by Hermione, Pansy, Ginny, and Harry and Draco and Blaise had been busy the past few weeks with Neville, pouring over old tomes of architectural spells. Ron was going to be the chief spell worker on most of the building spells because he knew many from having to help fix up the Burrow over the years. Seamus and Dean were in charge of taking down the trees necessary to build the frame, this was a particularly difficult task because while the land they had was vast and there were a lot of trees on the property, they didn't want to completely destroy the life on the property. Equally they wouldn't be able to go off too far because trees suddenly disappearing would not go unnoticed. Because they were meant to be moving the most around the property, they were also acting as look outs should something go wrong.
"That is a fair point, Miss Weasley." Draco nodded and while he didn't smile, Harry could see the humor in his eyes.
"You're late." Snape glared down at the boy, moving aside to allow the boy entrance. He looked out into the hallway carefully before closing the door behind them, subtly silencing and warding the room.
"I'm sure most of you are pretty tired and want to go back up to the castle, but please remember the time, everyone should spend at least a few hours in Hogsmeade before returning as to not arouse suspicions." Harry reminded everyone as they got their bearings.
"I know you're saw all of that." Harry said after a moment and he was able to collect himself. "Sorry if my magic upset you, I normally have a better hold on it than that."
"Okay sounds like a plan." Katie flashed him a smile before charming her voice so she could be heard over all the noise. "Alright warm up is over, everyone dismount and wait on the ground for us to call you for your try out."
It was raining heavily in Adare when they arrived and the four pulled their hoods up and tight around their face in unison, silently agreeing that the use of magic would not be best. They were up on a hill, overlooking the quaint village below.
Draco was sitting up in bed reading a book when Harry entered their bedroom. The blond didn't seem to notice his presence and Harry smirked to himself, quickly thinking up a plan. Silently, Harry spelled all of his clothes into the hamper by the door, making sure to keep out of Draco's peripheral vision until the last second when he also spelled the blond's clothes away. Draco gasped, dropping his book to look up in time to see Harry tackle him. Laughing, Harry straddled his lover, bending down to capture his lips in a searing kiss. Groaning, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's necks, grinding his hips into Harry's.
”I'm not so much worried about him as I am about all of his followers and everyone who believes in what he stands for even if they aren't or can't be a death eater. When this war is over and he's gone, there are still all those people to deal with and we can't very well get rid of them cause then we would be just as bad as them."
than us." Ron sneered, no longer willing to put up with Harry and his excuses. Harry had to admit, if only to himself, that the words stung even if they were true.
”I asked you all to stay because I wanted to address a few matters that I think are very important and are currently being overlooked. First I want to say that the regular rules of the DA still apply. You are absolutely banned from repeating anything that you learn from this meeting and that includes to other DA members. At the end of this meeting I will be asking you to sign another agreement, except this time it will keep you from talking about this meeting entirely, we as a whole cannot afford to be turned on again. I want to make this perfectly clear so if anyone here does not feel comfortable making that commitment then you should leave now. If you want I or Hermione can remove this memory from you so you don't accidentally tell anyone that there is a group within the DA." Harry waited to see if anyone would stand up and leave, but when no one did, he signed in relief.
"Checkmate!" Ginny exclaimed happily as the long game came to an end. "Well I think Neville and I will head to bed. Good night, boys." Ginny smiled, bending down to hug Harry close and kiss him on the cheek. She even moved to hug Draco and they shared a short, slightly awkward hug.
“No promises there, mate,” Ron joked from his girlfriend’s side. Hermione rolled her eyes and gently shoved him, much to Harry and Draco’s delight.
“Better than I think we could have expected. She understood me when I spoke to her and I gave her the potion already to stop the tremors and aftershocks. I will have to brew more, unfortunately I left my stock at the school and I’m not sure how safe it is for me to return.”
"You are too right, Severus, we will have to keep an eye on them, on all of them." Albus nodded grimly. The conversation was over, there was nothing more to be said, not that the three wanted to say anything more. There was much to do now and too little time.
“Before I forget you will both need to read and memorize these, they are connected to your magical signatures so only you two can, after the paper will disappear. A tricky bit of magic, but Draco assures me that he knows your magical signatures well enough that this will work.”
“She’s Nagini’s daughter and Harry rescued her from Voldemort’s death cave.” Ginny explained casually, her feelings on the matter emphasized with an eye-roll. “You know, normal stuff if you’re the boy who lived.”
The streets of Hogsmeade were empty, but that wasn’t surprising. Between the time of night, the cold of winter, and the reign of terror brought on by Voldemort and his Death Eaters, it was a wonder that any of the lights were still on in the Hogshead as the two approached the door. Leave it to Aberforth to still be up. It was a risk coming here, of course. The death of Dumbledore had been written off as sickness and old age as the only people who bore witness to it had been Harry and Draco, who hadn’t been seen or heard from since that day over a month ago and Severus himself. The guilt ate at him every time his colleagues wept for the old man’s loss, not a single one of them knowing it was by his wand. He violently shoved the thoughts behind his occlumency walls, there would be time later for such thoughts.
"Oy, Mate! Are you trying to kill us?" Seamus complained from somewhere in the back of the pack. Harry ignored him and forged on, keeping an even pace while making sure to watch the rest of his team for stragglers.
"You getting tired yet, Granger?" The use of surnames just seemed to slide back into place as the snake moved slowly around the proud lioness.
"I wanted to come to you guys immediately, but I realized that while I was outcasted they weren't going to do anything to me so I figured I should stick around for a bit to see what they were going to do. It was immediately obvious that something was going on. Everyone in the house was weary to follow Nott at first. Many where still unsure if Draco was gone for good and they where too afraid to defy a Malfoy. There were a few that took too well to him, however, and I knew that something was going to happen. One of them was Astoria Greengrass."
Hermione was determined to fix up the rest of the second floor that day seeing as they only had two more guest rooms, the master bedroom, and the master bath to fix up. They had already agreed that for the most part they would just modernize the existing furniture, fix anything that was broken, and have the house elves pick up new linens for each room after Hermione chose what color to transfigure the walls to. It seemed simple enough and Harry secretly wished that it would take them little to no time. As much as he loved Hermione and Ron he just didn't want to deal with their bickering today. On top of that Ron was clearly in a bad mood and Draco's presence wasn't exactly helping.

Draco walked into the common room first, though Severus was right behind him. To any passer by, it would seem that they were perfectly okay, both with their neutral masks set in place, but to the three occupants within, it was obvious that something wasn't right. Before anyone one had time to react, Harry disentangled himself from Ginny and was on his feet and in front of Draco. While the blond didn't seem to react, Harry saw the emotions flit through his gray eyes and before the Slytherin could protest, Harry had him in a tight embrace.
"She loves Quidditch, but mostly she wants to see the roster to make sure the students we have chosen are on good academic standing as well as to ensure that there is no favoritism going on. Especially this year with only two of us remaining and most of the people trying out being friends of ours, she just wants to make sure that everyone who makes it on the team does so fairly."
Harry had been the room when Draco had described all the of the horrors that he had been forced to face and what had been expected of him. Harry had done his best to listen and remember, but at the time had been so floored by the things that Draco had described, he could only remember the horrorstricken look on the boy’s face. “No I don’t.”
out of our home." Harry waited for them to leave before turning his full attention to his once best mate. "Now you listen to me very carefully. I don't want to make a scene of this, but I will be talking to Kingsley and you will be going on trial. Just know this. No matter what the Wizengamot decides you are no longer allowed in my home or near my family. You are furthermore banned from contacting all of those going by the name of the Noble House of Black, Potter, and Malfoy including those associated with these houses including, but not limited to Hermione Jean Granger. This is a magically binding decree that will be recognized by the Ministry and you will know the consequences if you break it." Harry watched Ron paled considerably as a pained look crossed his face. The wards in Grimmauld Place no longer recognized Ron's magic as friendly and were working against him, causing enough pain to paralyze him and keep him from moving within the home. "Neville can you please take Mr. Weasley from my home and bring him to the Ministry for me?" Harry asked casually acting as if the powerful magical decree he has just made was nothing more than words, but Neville knew better, he had felt the magic shift around him. The last time he had seen Harry use that much raw magic had been the war.
"Jinx? Listen to yourself, Arthur who would want to hurt Ginny? Unless, that is, you're hiding something from me." The dark look in the older wizards eyes made all of those in the room start to grow suspicious.
As far as Harry was concerned, Professor Williams seemed competent in defense and he seemed like a natural teacher, but he couldn’t shake the fact that something was off about the man. It could just be that there was always something off about every defense professor since Harry started Hogwarts but this one in particular seemed odd. Harry had only known him for just a month, but he could confidently say that something wasn't right.
Harry took his seat and watched as if in a trance as Draco moved around the kitchen to serve them. He moved with confidence, as if he had been doing this for years and this wasn't the first real meal that the two were sharing in such a peaceful setting. To Harry's delight, Draco had made a simple pasta dish with spinach, mushrooms, and shrimp. The sauce smelled like lemons and when Draco sat down and poured them their wine, Harry delicately took his first bite.
"I guess my magic was sort of locked up. After the end of last year, I don't know, I think that my body just realized that I really needed this extra energy and magic that I was capable of and just opened up to let me access it. I haven't really had much chance to train or control it, so I'm sorry if I hurt you."
“But naturally you know where it is.” Harry did his best to hide his sarcasm, but he was sure he had failed.
The faces of the crowd slowly began to change as Draco talked. Many seemed surprised and impressed at how open he was being and how he spoke of his father with such disgust. Others were whispering about whether or not they thought that it was all a clever plot to get the secrets of the Light and the DA to report back to Voldemort.
"And this needing to tell you is completely to help me, right? It has nothing to do with you being nosy and needing to know everything going on in my love life?"
Draco followed Harry out of the room and down the hall. They stopped in front of the closed door and Harry moved to open it, his hand hovering above the doorknob for a moment longer than necessary. Draco could have sworn that he heard Harry exhale before turning the handle and pushing the door open. Then he looked up at Draco, a small smile on his face, before stepping aside for the blond to pass him and enter the room first. What Draco saw made his breath catch.
"I think we will be able to do that, you certainly have the money, let me go gather a few properties and the memories of their location so you can review them all. If you decide to purchase the land then the memory will be destroyed and you can wipe my memory of its location, but not of the document being drawn. You can make it so I can't remember it was you who bought it, but if I can't remember that it was purchased we could run into some problems."
"What are brothers for?" Blaise smiled, vowing to himself to have a word with Harry when he could and maybe even lighten up on his scrutinization of the boy.
"Voldemort is torturing her with the cruciatus and possibly other curses." Draco's face seemed to have lost all of its blood. The shaking turned into out right trembling as tears started to fall from his eyes as well. Gently Harry let go of the blond, allowing him to fall forward onto his godfather. He wanted so desperately to help, but he knew that there was nothing that he could do. It broke Harry's heart to see how much pain both men where in.
"You heard correctly, Miss Weasley." Draco responded for Harry. He was sitting at the kitchen table enjoying lunch prepared by Dobby when he heard the duo floo in. His expression was guarded and Harry instantly mourned the loss of the smiles that he had already grown to love.
"Merlin, that would be fabulous." The duo entered the common room last, their conversation breaking off when they heard the loud cheers and cries of congratulations.
“Well it wasn’t specifically for that, but it will be very useful.” Hermione produced a very small beaded bag from her pocket. It didn’t look like very much and everyone stared at it.
“He was furious, screaming about a group of children. Death Eater’s children and another boy who stole from him. It was Potter. He said they got away with his most prize possession.” The other man seemed just a bit braver as he was looking up, facing their master, but not looking far enough up that he might see Severus.
“That’s fine, you deserve it and it’s likely the locket is long gone, if we’re lucky, Regulus was able to destroy it before he died.”
"You don't have to eat my cooking if you don't want." Draco suggested as he sat down at the table, spelling up a serving for Harry, drowning in jam just as the man had eaten them just hours ago. Angry eyes followed his every move, but Ron stood still, just drinking in his own rage.
Giving up on moving for now, Harry switched his focus to his working senses. There were no sounds around Harry. He wasn’t sure if it was because he couldn’t hear, but he was sure that the oppressive feeling of nothingness that existed beyond the awful numbness truly existed. Giving up on using his ears, Harry did his best to remain calm. There was no sense in panicking, it wouldn’t get him out of whatever terrible situation Dumbledore had landed him in. He refused to accept that this was the end for him. He couldn’t be dead, he had to believe that there was more beyond life than this. Whatever this was, there was just nothing and it terrified him.
"I still think you should just ask him to talk after class one day." Hermione said smartly as she, Pansy, Ginny, and Luna organized the many books and piles of notes they'd made all day in the library. Harry and Draco finally joined them in the dorms and were trying to figure out exactly how Harry was meant to bring up the horcruxes to Professor Williams. It was lunch time and Gin and Luna decided to come back and help rather then watch the boys stuff their faces.
“Well introducing us went over better than anyone could hope.” Blaise pointed out which made Draco roll his eyes.
"You give up, Weasley?" Draco taunted from above the girl, a smirk set firmly on his face. He started to walk slowly toward her, his eyes trained on her wand and his body ready to jump back at any moment.
The first thing Harry knew he had to do was get his racing heart under control. He did his best to breathe in and out and focus on his surroundings. He thought of Draco’s laugh, Hermione’s smile, the way Ron looked after a particularly delicious meal. He thought of Luna’s gentle nature and Ginny’s burning intensity when her friends were in need. When he was certain that the ringing in his ears was gone he forced himself to focus on his surrounds. His sight and hearing were gone for the time being and he had to rely on his other sense and instincts. The cave smelt damp, he could tell through the stale air that it had been a long time since someone had visited this spot. He felt around with his wand and found a cave wall. The rocks were jagged and he was careful not to cut himself as he felt for the opening toward the corridor he had gotten a quick glance of before he had been plunged into nothingness.
The made their way into the bar with little issue. Not a single soul noticed when the door slipped open and there was seemingly no one there to have done it as they were all rather drunk and were apparently celebrating if the cheers and maniacal laughter was anything to go by. Harry only let himself worry what a bunch of death eaters might have to be happy over for a second before returning his focus to the task at hand.
"Something was wrong with her broom, she just lost control and fell. It was almost like what happened to you in your first year." Katie looked downright frightened at the dark look that crossed Harry's face, she knew what he was thinking, this could be the work of the student who decorated Ginny's locker.
Draco was completely lost to the sensations sparking across his body. He had never really had the opportunity to experiment with other guys, much less have a relationship with one, so he was quite new to everything that had to do with physical intimacy that wasn't hugging or cuddling with Blaise. While the self conscious part of him wished he wasn't so naive, the part of him currently being worshiped by Harry's mouth was more than glad that he had waited so long to share such an intimate first moment with someone as special as Harry.
"No, actually she is under the impression that you lied about being gay and are actually dating Ginny."
“I’m sorry to interrupt, Harry wanted me to check on you, Lady Malfoy, and see if you needed anything else.”
“No, that’s impossible.” Draco spoke, still in awe as the material came in and out of focus. “Is this how you managed everything these past five years?”
“You filthy brats, stealing from me! Who do you think you are?” He rounded on Harry as soon as the boy made it through the door way. “You! I should have known, filthy Potters sticking their noses in places where they don’t belong!”
.” Harry hissed, punctuating his words with a few more hard thrusts. It was enough to cause Draco to find his release and Harry followed moments later.
Harry didn't have time to respond, Draco's lips were soft on his and his scent all but consumed him. Draco managed to move around completely, his body pressed flat against Harry's, loving the feeling of having the warm, taunt body underneath him. Draco buried his hands into the messy brown locks, moaning when he felt Harry's hands slide down his sides, firmly grasping his arse. Draco growled, pressing himself into Harry allowing the boy to drag him ever closer. They had to pull away eventually for air and when they did, Draco couldn't help but notice that Harry's eyes were completely dilated from lust, a look that Draco was sure he mirrored.
Harry felt like his whole body was on fire. He was so relaxed from Draco's magical fingers and the feel of the blond's naked body pressed tightly against his side made Harry see stars. In the month that the two had been together, they had really only made out before and while Harry had seen the blond with just a towel on he had never actually been so close to him naked. Draco pulled away from the kiss and started kissing a trail down Harry's neck again, his hands roaming over his sides, snaking up and down his ribs, pinching and playing with each of his erect nipples in the process. Harry moaned loudly, having half the mind to cast a weak silencing spell. He hardly cared if the others heard, but he knew Draco would be embarrassed in the morning if he didn't. His mind was taken away from all thoughts, but the blond when he felt his tongue moving lower. Harry was sure he would cum just at the sight of Draco making his way down his body, stopping just before his painfully erect cock. Draco looked up from his spot kneeling in between Harry's legs as if to ask permission. All words had failed Harry at this point and it was all the Gryffindor could do, but moan approvingly and thrust his hips up in a lame attempt to get Draco to move closer and
"Good, now go on I think the last group of students will be leaving soon and I wouldn't want you to miss them."
"When you are in love with someone, some say with your soul mate, your patronus will change to match theirs. It is said that the submissive partner in the relationship is the one to change, though it is possible for someone to have theirs change even if they are not in a relationship with that person."
. Snape nodded and stood to leave, taking one last glance at the man that he had once respected before leaving feeling much more heavy hearted than when he arrived.
When Harry entered Draco and Blaise's common room he was instantly bombarded by questions. Along with Draco and Ginny, Blaise, Hermione and the rest of the sixth year Gryffindor boys sat waiting for him. It took a few minutes to get everyone to stop talking over each other and when Harry was able to get a seat on the armrest of Draco's chair, he told them what was going on. As he expected everyone was outraged at Dumbledore's response and many almost doubted what Harry told him. He had to reassure Hermione a few times that he had in fact been there and that yes, he was sure it was Dumbledore that he had spoken to. Harry had been convinced for a while now that the man was not of a fit state of mind to run the school, though he had kept those thoughts to himself. Not however, he wasn't the only one questioning the old man and his motives.
going to be alone again. Do you understand me? No matter what happens I will always be here to support you. We are going to win this war, not because of some damn prophecy or the meddling of crazy old wizards. We are going to win this war because we have each other and I have faith in the fact that with us and our friends we will find a way.”
"Well doesn't someone look like Christmas came early." The playful voice of Ginny Weasley brought Harry out of his trance-like state as he stared straight into the eyes of one of his best friends. She was talking in the lobby of the ministry, most likely have just finished meeting with her dad or even Neville.
Practice ran smoothly after Draco showed up. Harry left Katie to run the keeper and chaser plays while he worked with Seamus and Dean on beater drills, using Draco as the stand in seeker so he could teach the two some of the basic plays that Fred and George had come up with and perfected over the years. At half past one, Harry seemed satisfied with the team and ended practice, many of the team members look worn out from the grueling work out and Harry began to feel bad for over reacting and pushing them so hard.
Hermione slowly walked the isles of the Restricted Section in the back of the library. Most classes were in session and only the sixth year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs were on break so there were little to no students around to bother her. Pansy was walking in the opposite direction on the other side of the bookcase, while Harry stood seemingly lost in the middle.
"The only person hiding anything here is you." Snape spoke quietly, each word punctuated by a step forward. Harry knew then that Snape was on their side and he could never be more thankful for the man's support. Dumbledore was scary when upset, but Snape was down right frightening.
"God you're amazing, Draco." Harry moaned, realizing that Draco really wasn't going to let him do anything that night, and so he sat back to watch the show. Draco was already so close to his orgasm and he knew that he wouldn't be able to put on a great show, but by the look of heat in Harry's eyes, the boy wouldn't mind. Using his own pre-cum, Draco lubed up his fingers on his left hand, and while keeping up the same fast pace on his cock, he began to circle his fingers around his tight hole. Harry found his hand on his own hardening cock before he realized he had done it. The sight of Draco playing with himself was too much and Harry began to stroke himself in time with him. Seeing this only pushed Draco further. This wasn't his first time fingering himself and when he slipped the first finger in Harry moaned and leaned forward. Draco didn't even bother to brush Harry aside this time and Harry replaced his hand with the one Draco was masturbating with, moving so that their cocks were pressed close and he could jerk them off at the same time. The feel of skin on skin was too much for Draco. He could feel the pressure building and his balls tightening up.
He let himself into Dumbledore’s quarters with ease. The door was guarded by the portrait of an old wizard who spent more of is time sleeping than actually awake. As soon as Severus darkened the portrait with his shadow, the old man had opened his eyes long enough to see that it was him before swing the door open falling fast asleep again. Dumbledore was sitting by the hearth with a set of tea for two as if he had been expecting him. For all he knew, he had been. The old wizard had always seemed to know more than he should and yet he was obviously mostly unaware of Harry and his friends and their scheming. In the poor light of the dying fire, the former Headmaster looked older than ever, his tired eyes filled with something that looked like regret. If he hadn’t been witness to the man’s acts of insanity in the past few months Severus might honestly feel remorse for him.
"And I you, Griphook." The goblin looked up startled, not sure how to respond. "I am not like most wizards, now is Bill ready to see us?"
"Good. I will come by to collect you tomorrow at half past nine. There are some things we must go over before the meeting."
"You look really tired, love." Draco whispered, leaning into Harry's hand on his lower back. "You know that we can run the meeting tonight, right? Maybe you should go back and sleep."
“Oh, I’m not as worried about that. He’s good, there is no doubt, but someone taught him all he knows about mind magic.” The conspiratorial grin she gave him told him all he needed to know about who Snape’s teacher had been. He was impressed.
Harry moved as silently as he could, doing his best not to be noticed by the bogart. He needed to put an end to this. He was beginning to empathize with the old wizard before him and he couldn’t allow himself to do that. Even if it was selfish, Harry knew that if he could relate to the man and understand him in any way he might find it in himself to forgive him and he just wasn’t ready to do that yet.
“I’m sure there will be other students finding themselves in detention sooner or later.” Severus shrugged and motioned toward the door making it clear that their conversation was done.
"I'm fine, Dragon, just stressed." The old childhood nickname make Draco smile even wider. It had been ages since anyone had called him that, though the only other person who used to was his mom.
The hall to the potions cavern had remained open and the wizard made quick work of navigating the dimly lit path until he found Dumbledore leaning against one of the open chests just as he'd left him.
“A friend, or at least I would hope you might still call me one.” Severus pulled his hood down from his cloak, revealing both himself and Narcissa in the process. He could not quite tell if it was the sight of his face, or possibly of Narcissa’s poor state that convinced the man they meant him no harm, but he lowered his wand and sighed. “The back door is open, there is a trap in the floor below the rug, you can crawl into the cellar for now, the rug will right itself when you close the door. There isn’t much down there, but a small cot and a few blankets, but there might be a cloak for the Lady.”
"Oh please, Draco and Harry are far worse." Ginny rolled her eyes in means of defense. Across the room, the pair in question were holding a hushed, private conversation and it didn't escape anyone's notice how Harry's hand was slowly running circles on Draco's lower back.
"Enough chatter." Severus intoned from the the other side which caused both Colin and Draco to fall into a fit of laughter.
"Why are you getting so invested in Mr. Malfoy's affairs?" Kingsley asked, not unkindly but with a teasing tone to it. “I would think that you’re appearance at his trial would have paid the life debt that you owed his mother.” Kingsley had been there during the trials and had heard all about how Narcissa had spared his life and lied to Voldemort, though Harry had helpfully left out the detail where she had only done so to save her own son.
"But can we trust her? She said she might know who the second person is, but how is she going to tell us?" Ginny pointed out. This time it was Blaise who spoke.
"Thank you." Harry smiled warmly at the Slytherin's, ignoring the commotion that his actions started and addressed to room again. "I know that it will not be easy for you to accept that we have Slytherin's in our ranks, but I expect all of you to at least leave them be. Now I know that the other topic many of you want to know about is the events that the Ministry at the end of last year." Here Harry's voice faltered at the thought about Sirius and Hermione took over for him.
The journey through the castle was silent and efficient. They took the quickest root that conveniently had no people due to the late hour. Harry wondered if he would have time to send a patronus to Draco, but he thought better of it. Dumbledore was being more forthcoming than he had in the past and even still Harry had no idea what he was walking in to. Any distractions or delays would most likely hinder them and Harry couldn’t risk that. Draco would understand.
By the end of his impassioned speech Harry found tears that he hadn’t know were building up in him running freely down his face. Draco, who seemed more prepared for them was already there, wiping them away the best that he could while cradling Harry to his chest.
“Naturally,” Pansy spoke in an air that must have come with a pureblood raising. The man before them was obviously of a similar breeding because he seemed to straighten, as if realizing he was in the company of like-minded ilk.
"Fine." Snape groaned, running his hand over his face before beginning. "Do you know what horcruxes are?"
“Nothing, go back to sleep.” Harry tried to soothe, but the words made Draco’s eyes open further and scrutinize him.
." Kreacher glared at Harry before leaving the room, less than happy with his master. "Master Potter has told me not to tell you his secrets." Kreacher informed Draco sullenly as he set food before the blond.
“Artikus, Artikus Burch.” He managed to splutter out and the twins shared a look. They had never heard the name before, but they knew Harry and rest would figure it out.
"Certainly not about loving your Godson." Harry responded genuinely, he linked his hands with Draco and couldn't help, but smile when he felt Draco's thumb slowly draw circles on his own hand.
"Are you sure love?" Draco asked just to be sure. He didn't want Harry to feel as if he had to let Draco be in complete control. He didn't want it to be something that the other boy regretted in the morning. Instead of responding vocally, Harry took Draco's hand and wrapped it firmly around his member. Harry was harder than Draco had ever felt him which was answer enough for the blond.
"Hey Gin, you okay?" Harry sat behind the girl, straddling the bench, pulling her into a hug from behind. He looked over his shoulder at Draco who smiled gently and nodded that he was okay.
“Are you sure?” Pansy asked. It was meant to be a whisper, but with the wind howling as loud as it was, she might as well have been screaming.
Draco made quick work of changing, noticing that the under shirt was rather big for him and he wondered how broad Harry's chest and shoulders must be to consider the clothes too small. Of course this line of thought only brought images of a shirtless Harry into his mind which he instantly banished, not wishing to face the consequences of such thoughts. Without thinking further about his situation, Draco finished changing and cleared his throat to let Harry know that he was all set. When Harry turned around the sight before him took his breath away. Draco stood before him a bit awkward, swinging his hands at his sides and staring at the floor, but Harry was more enthralled with how the uniform looked on the boy. He was sure that Draco had spelled his clothing, because it looked much smaller than Harry remembered. He wondered just how small the other boy was, what it would feel like to press into his smaller frame, would they fit together like a puzzle? If Harry was in the right state of mind, he would have been more concerned about these sudden and random thoughts, but the way that the blond looked with the red contrasting his pale skin and the way the fabric hung to his body was driving him mad. Without thinking Harry slowly walked forward, mildly surprised when Draco didn't move. They were so close, he could feel the breath of the other boy on his lips. Was he really that much taller than the blond? Had he grown that much over the summer? Emotions that Harry could not read were flitting through Draco's eyes, but again the boy didn't move. There lips were
“I think it might be time we learn how to be an animagus,” Pansy suggested as she followed the two, Draco and Blaise not far behind. “If we could have transformed and hid out between jumps, we might have been able to shake them and also get a better look at our attackers from a distance.
"I'm sure he will be fine," Harry spoke when they made it back on the ground level. He didn't really know if he believed himself, but for Draco's sake he stood his ground. "Parkinson came to talk to me again."
"There are rooms near the Gryffindor tower originally meant for the head of House, but are currently unoccupied since Professor McGonnagal decided to reside elsewhere in the castle. Since the rooms empty, Professor Dumbledore has offered them to Draco should he need them." Harry looked to the darker boy finally fully acknowledging him. "I know that moving out is not ideal, but it would be safe." Harry looked back to Draco who had a deep frown on his face.
"I regret that I have not been told much. It seems that Dumbledore is weary of telling me anything anymore, he knows of course that you have not called me. He fears that you have found no use for me and he too is rethinking his allies. I fear that if I do not report good things to him tonight he might have me cast from the school."
After the short break they had taken, the core found themselves well rested and reenergized when it came to studying and working to get their home ready for any manner of horrible things that the war promised. With help from the twins, Severus was brewing potions before long and their storeroom had finally ceased to be empty. Their potions stock rivaled that of Hogwarts’ and Severus had found that the teenagers had actually been paying attention for all of those years in his class as they had all helped to stock the shelves.
"Are we safe, Sev?" Draco asked and instantly Severus was brought back to when Draco was a child and he would go to him when Lucius was being particularly harsh.
The short discussion appeared to set the rest of Harry’s friends at ease and was enough to distract them from his meeting the night before. He relaxed further into his seat and only moved when Hermione and Draco switched places. The couple sat side beside, both doing their own reading while Draco slid from the arm of the chair into Harry’s lap.
"And if I don't?" The man bit back, Harry was starting to wonder if there was an easier way, but he knew that this was the only way. He was just going to erase his memories after anyways.
“Yes, much too much time with Ron.” Harry commented in an attempted severe tone, but the smile on his face gave him away.
." At Draco's snippy comment, Harry's head snapped up and their eyes met, watching the other for a reaction, after a minute passed Draco adverted his eyes. "Sorry, habit." He muttered before returning to his midnight snack.
"Sev, don't take out your nerves on Harry." Draco chided his Godfather when they were within range to hear his whispers.
"Actually we're all here for Ginny, Sir." Neville responded rather boldly which made Snape raise his brow at the boy.
"More like you would just have to have a hero complex." Draco threw Harry a sly grin that Harry laughed off easily.
"We can finish it when you can talk about Harry being his own man." Albus responded gravely, his eyes boring into the dark eyes of Severus Snape. His whole demeanor changed when he looked up to Minerva, his smile back in place. "Lemon drop?"
“I told Draco that, but you know how he is.” She spoke, but if she thought she was fooling Harry then she was and idiot. She might be the newest to their close knit group, but she had carved out a spot for herself and made herself comfortable. She had worried just as much as the rest and her waiting outside the safety of their common room was proof.
"Master Malfoy, what a pleasure." Kreacher spoke in a voice that sent a chill down Draco's spine. He could tell that the house elf was much happier now than how he had been during the war. It seemed that Harry really did treat all of his elves well. Even still there was something very unsettling about the elf.
The day was winding down and the fire in the hearth warmed up the room to an almost uncomfortable level. The girls where all sitting by the fire, chatting and laughing with an ease that Harry nearly envied. The boys where in the kitchenette joking and laughing over drinks. This is the life that Harry wanted, the life he could only wish to have until the war was over. The girls noticed Harry first, their smiles warming the cold feeling around his heart.
"So is that what you meant by you still have connections? It figures they would have wanted you, anyone would have followed what you said." Draco stated easily, no malice or disgust evident in his voice or posture.
"We're not going to make you talk, if you don't want to, but we all think that it would help you to talk this out. We're all just worried about you."
Draco quickly finished his lunch and returned to the library, book in hand, waiting for Harry to be done with the room. If he said that he wasn't anxious he would have been outright lying. He wondered why Harry was doing this for him, the boy whom he once despised stood up to his own friend, his best friend, in order to defend a Malfoy. The thought alone shocked Draco and he couldn't understand why. If Harry had been a Slytherin, though the boy certainly had shown the capabilities of being one, Draco would have assumed that he was treating Draco kindly because he had some ulterior motive.
"I'm not sure I can do that." Snape cautioned, he figured he would be able to convince the boy to pretend to trust the man, but he wasn't sure if he would be able to fool the wizard with an act.
It was not difficult to hear the hatred in the snake’s tone, there was something strange about tonality in Parseltongue, it existed, but only if you were careful to listen for it.
“Do you see any other options? We are stuck in this room with now way out. I can feel the anti-apparition charms in these walls and I know you can feel them too. Would you like to die trying to get out of this place or would you like to take the long way to death’s door?”
“Hey, I saw your mom last night, and she’s loads better than my parents, but I can probably help with figuring out what she should and shouldn’t eat and drink while we sort out if there is any lasting damage. I learned a lot from spending time with my parents, Gran use to take me to see them several times a week before I started Hogwarts.” The words were quiet and gentle and Draco disentangled himself from Severus to face his friend.
It seemed Dumbledore wasn’t sure if he was telling the truth and the older wizard took some time to simply observe his face before continuing. “There is an old chest at a store in Knockturn Alley called Borgin and Burkes. It is said to have a pair which one may enter and reappear in the other chest. Draco was to find its pair in Hogwarts, repair it, and allow the Death Eaters to enter into the castle past all of our protections.”
"They're dark magic." Neville piped up, Blaise and Draco nodded, but Snape was not surprised to see that no one else did. They were very rare magic and he was a bit surprised that the three had even heard about them in the first place.
“Okay enough talk about business, after the meeting today we’re going to have the rest of the day off. What are we going to do?” Draco asked.

"And you want to shag his brains out." It was a statement that made all of the color rise to Harry's cheeks.
“Not nice!” Draco gently punched his arm before kissing it better. “Getting out of here does sound good though.”
"You got it, boss." Neville joked to ease the tension in the room, but noticed that Harry didn't even crack as smile as he left the room, throwing one last loathsome look at Ron.
"I know, Sir. You can trust me too." Snape ended the spells warding the room and stood. He opened the door for Harry and let him walk out first. It was a small peace offering, but Harry would take it for what it was.
"You can never be too careful." McGonnagal said with pursed lips. Carefully, she pulled out an object from her pocket. The gold shined in the dim candle light and it took Harry a moment to recognize the time turner. "This is not the same as the one that I loaned Miss Granger in your third year. That one was my personal time turner. This one is yours. It was one of the many magical artifacts that your parents owned which they had placed in the care of the Order before their death. I motioned to have it returned to your vaults, but Dumbledore said he was still using it. When the Ministry came for him, I was able to take it back from his office. It's more powerful than mine, your father used it often in his time as an Order member as well as in school, though I could never prove it." The small smirk on the witch's face made a small, appreciative smile come to Harry's. He might not know much about his father, and what he did was not exactly the nicest coming from Severus' memories, but Harry could easily imagine Sirius running a muck with the time turner and the fond memories seemed to bring forth more happy feelings then sad as of late.
