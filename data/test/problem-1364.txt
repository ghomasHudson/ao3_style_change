“Ah… That’s true…” Potter looked down slightly, his gaze lingering on Draco’s lips before looking away, his grip loosening. “Well, if you don’t, then I won’t.” His hands let go of Draco’s cheeks, and he stepped back slightly.
They could hear snippets here and there of Ron and Harry discussing quidditch and Auror work passionately from the kitchen and the low murmuring that seeped through into the living room was soothing to listen to.
‘Do I want him?’ Harry thought and tried to picture himself with Draco. Harry sighed. He knew that he liked the guy, but he wasn’t sure if he liked him in such a way that he could do the physical stuff that follows with a relationship.
Draco quietly left the room, and on the way back as Pansy was chatting away about everything and nothing, Draco couldn’t help but be glad that it was Lovegood he was caught off guard by, and not one of Potter’s other friends.
He took both his legs and lifted them slightly before kissing Draco’s inner thigh. That sent waves of pleasure up Draco’s body. He clenched the sheets as he felt his body shiver with each kiss getting closer to his cock.
“So… How are you holding up?” Pansy studied him intently as she asked. Draco knew that she was worried about him. She had been crying endlessly when she got to know that Draco would have to go through trials for his role in the war.
“Please don’t be mad at her! She only worries, and since you haven’t been returning her letters lately, she asked me how things were going. She doesn’t want to tell you, but I think she is a bit lonely at the manor by herself.” Pansy said in a much lower voice now.
“Oh… well, it’s not important. I just thought of buying some pastries on my way home” Draco felt a bit of heat rise to his cheeks as he thought he had been subtle.
That was a major mistake as it gave room for Potter to move. Draco felt his breath getting caught in his throat as a strong grip yanked his hand that was holding the wand to the side, away from Potter’s direction. At the same time, he was forced backwards, as Potter rose and backed him up against the wall.
“I’m not saying it isn’t.” Potter turned his head to look at Draco, and somehow it felt oddly strange to be talking to Potter about the war, the Death Eaters and their experiences through it all in such a calm demeanour while sharing a bed. “However, we do share some similarities.”
“Alright.” Draco mumbled to himself as he stretched his arms above his head, he felt stiff after having stirred the potion for a prolonged time. He then used his wand to carefully extract the liquid and add it into an empty vial, making sure it was shut properly.
“Please, you’re too close.” Draco placed his hand on Potter’s chest intending to push him back, but it felt like a brick wall in front of him. He knew from being in Potter’s body that the guy was well built. He had put on an impressive amount of muscles during the war, which didn’t make the current situation any easier for Draco.
“I thought you said it was all fun and games.” Draco quirked an eyebrow at him before focusing on scouting once more.
“I’m not scared!” Draco barked out, hiding his face in the palm of his hands. Why the hell did his body have to react so damn strongly to seeing Harry completely naked?!
It was already mid-December, and Draco was having a mild crisis at this point. He had been exploring the few stores around the small town, trying to find something that would fit as a present.
Draco waited until he heard the sound of coins hitting the counter and the jingle of the doorbell before he let himself breathe. He sank down onto the floor, sighing.
Draco gave a small smile as he shook her hand. “Friends.” He said, which made Luna’s smile widen as she at once found it appropriate to dive into how wrackspurts were floating around his head and what he could do in order to get rid of them.
Draco, on the other hand, knew he would be lucky to even get a job. He had to focus on his N.E.W.T.s. and only achieving great results in order to maybe be considered for a position where he could actually get the chance to showcase his skills. Even with full scored N.E.W.T.s. his last name could easily make most people turn their back at him.
“You lot! Meeting in Draco and Potter’s room, now.” Pansy looked livid as she barged into the common room followed by Blaise and Potter.
It was a nice feeling, no doubt, but it also somehow made Draco nervous. He was afraid Harry was pushing himself too much. He hated the thought of making Harry uncomfortable because of having to consider his feelings.
“I just can’t seem to recall an instance where you did, in fact, catch the snitch during our tournaments.” Potter said nonchalantly, which obviously ignited a fire in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
“Malfoy,” Malfoy looked up to see Weasley look at him with a strangely apologetic look. “I’m sorry about that, alright. You shouldn’t listen to what they’re saying.” He gave Draco an awkward pat on the shoulder before going into the classroom.
The blonde had exactly one second to take in the sight of who was entering, before he threw himself down behind the counter.
Potter was sitting beside him on the couch, and Draco heard a small snort escape him at the mention of Draco poisoning someone. He quickly disguised it by sipping his tea.
Draco did the same, and a sense of unease washed over him at the thought of it not working. What would they do if they weren’t able to get back into their own bodies? Would they have to tell McGonagall about it, and risk Draco getting expelled and having to face the ministry once more?
“I guess I’ll just apparate you back then, let those guys do as they please.” Draco leaned in closer and narrowed his eyes. “I’m sure you’ve been a real pain in the arse for them, so you might not walk this one off.”
Draco got a bit startled as he saw Harry’s hand about to touch him, but before he could react properly, Harry’s hand reach for his hair and he pulled it back with half a leaf in his hand.
He opened the door and saw that Potter was seated on the couch with papers strewn in front of him. It was odd to see him actually do any sort of paperwork, considering that it had never been an occurrence at school unless Granger was breathing down his neck. However, now he seemed so professional, and the short glimpse of his concentrating face was a new side Draco had never seen of Potter before. The fireplace was lit, and it gave the room a warm, orange light that was mirrored in Potter’s glasses as he looked up once he realised he was being watched.
The castle was still grand as ever. Being up close to it made something inside Draco’s stomach turn. Although the structure itself was rebuilt to the finest details, it couldn’t hide the scars that still lingered in the memories of what had happened there.
With a loud moan escaping Draco’s lips he felt Harry’s cock sink into him deeper than he thought possible. He was so filled up he had trouble breathing properly. It felt utterly amazing. Sure, the sting was there from having something so large penetrate him, but the sheer view and knowledge of having Harry Potter inside of him was making him see stars.
“There you go” Harry said with a grin. He looked up to meet Draco’s eyes, and realised he had probably moved a bit quickly for the blonde. His cheeks were red once again and he looked a bit shocked before he turned his head and muttered a quiet thank you.
Draco jumped in surprise as a door beside the bakery opened up behind him. He turned around to see the all too familiar face of the bakery guy.
“Is this normal?” Draco whispered to Hermione as they both sat there waiting for whatever was happening to finally end.
“Although I suppose any place in the wizarding world would be difficult to navigate through when everyone knows who you are. That one I can kinda understand better than most, I suppose. Though we aren’t exactly known for similar reasons.” If Draco hadn’t been so caught up on the potion, he would’ve spoken with more care, instead of blatantly putting forth bad memories of a past that would never be forgotten.
“Hi…” He heard the familiar voice behind him, which as of late, had been strangely unnatural as Draco was being far more timid around him.
“I like you.” Draco felt his hands twitch a bit as he waited for Potter to process what had been said.
The poor guy had, after several reassurances that it wouldn’t give any weird effects when a man drank it, been forced into tasting the potion and giving Draco an idea of whether the taste was starting to become better. He himself was too exhausted to even properly make sense of it anymore. Potter reassured him it was decent, and even told him he would bring some to Granger for her to taste test. After a day of worrying about it, Granger stopped by the shop all excited about how good the potion tasted now after all the tweaks Draco had made to it. It had been a big relief as he could now rest easy that the others who were buying it, including Granger, would have a high-quality potion that could help them without any bitter after taste.
Then he suddenly gasped loudly as he felt something he hadn’t felt before. “There!” He managed to moan out. “Here?” Harry panted as he tried to hit the same spot over again.
“Calm down, Ron. He’s messing with you.” A startle went through Draco as Potter suddenly popped out of nowhere and was now trying to coerce a livid Weasley towards the Gryffindor locker room.
“Well, he told me that you think, I mean, our previous conversation…” Draco cursed himself for rambling as ineloquently as he currently was.
He watched as it took off in a hurry, its long black wings gliding across the wind. It would surely reach his mother in good time for her to process the idea of her son bringing someone with him for Christmas. He did not think it would bother her much, as she had been writing to him several times about it only being the two of them for Christmas. He knew just how much she loved having guests over as it made the manor a little less grim. Surely, she would be frantically decorating the place the minute she read his letter.
“Not at all.” Potter shook his head slightly as he took in the environment like it was his first time there. “I must say, you do suit the place though.”
Draco had started wondering what was going on when he suddenly had multiple pregnant women come by and asking for a potion to help with their nauseousness. Soon it had become clear to him that Granger might be behind it as Potter told him she had been going on and on about how much it had helped her. Since so many were starting to request the potion, Draco spent long days working on it to make it better, last longer and most importantly taste decent.
“Sure!” Draco said and before he could continue she said “Oh, and the croissant that Harry’s made fits really well with it, do you want to add that as well?”
“What?” Potter looked at Draco with a stern look. “Are you that incapable of acting decent for one bloody minute?”
“Yeah, even the set of baking equipment I’ve been wanting for a long time” Harry seemed overly happy with the gift, making Draco relax a bit more.
“What the hell?! You guys have always hated Malfoy, why do you suddenly act like you’re all best friends now!” The incredulous look on Macmillan’s face was refreshing, Draco though.
“Well, if this is how you’re going to treat me, then you can be certain of one thing.” Draco said, leaning back slightly to look Harry in the eyes.
“The others got some bruises and such, but nothing too bad.” Then Weasley’s face seemed to shift slightly with worry. “Harry took most of the damage though. Despite me jumping in to help, we were outnumbered, and you know how self-sacrificing he can be.”
“Of course you didn’t know. I made sure no one knew.” Draco sighed in defeat before adding. “I can perform an obliviate on you, if you’d like.”
“Here” The guy walked over with a plate of pie in each hand. He put it down on the small table in front of the couch.
“Who are you two roomed with by the way?” Draco asked, trying to steer the conversation over to something else.
It wouldn’t be an ideal scenario to have Potter walk in on him brewing a potion illegally in their shared bedroom. The good doer would probably run of at first chance to tell on him.
“That’s highly reassuring, Potter.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I’ll just become the assistant to the Head Auror, and we can share a broom as we go around fighting crime together.”
“I wasn’t kidding by the way. If you’d like to visit him, I’m sure he won’t mind. He seemed to have quite the headache on the way back, so if you smuggle something for that in, then I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.”
Draco glanced quickly at the shelf in the ingredient room. He only needed one more vial for the potion.
Or well… He tried to grasp the situation, adrenaline still pumping through his body as he frantically took in his surroundings. The first thing he noticed, the most important one, was that he was no longer in full on battle mode fighting for his life. The second thing made him curse inwardly as he launched himself backwards, his robe soaked and heavy, away from the shocked look of none other than the golden boy himself.
His hand traced down Harry’s cheek and stopped at his lips. They were slightly red still and felt smooth against Draco’s thumb. He felt his body react before his mind as he leaned in and kissed Harry.
“Merlin no. She’s horrible at it, but she’s good at managing customers and taking orders.” Draco almost laughed at the thought of Pansy brewing their potions. It had been a secret between Draco and Pansy during school that she had barely managed to pass potion class at all. And the only reason she did so, was because Draco had spent some excruciating late nights with her trying to drill in the basics to pass the bare minimum. It had been halfway through their second late-night study that Draco had come to the conclusion to never become a teacher of sort. Even just the thought of dealing with someone like Pansy as a student was too much for him.
Once the Death Eaters had been sentenced and thrown into Azkaban, Draco was able to finally move around outside of Harry’s house without the constant fear he had been carrying for so long.
“I’m outright terrified. And I have been so for so long now. It wasn’t until I landed in your bathtub of all places and realised you weren’t about to throw me out at once that I actually felt some sort of safety around me. These past months have been the best ones so far in my life. I finally felt safe, and I actually really like you. I have for so bloody long now, and I couldn’t believe it when you said you would consider it. It’s too crazy to believe, and I’m terrified of what you’re going to say now that you don’t have to be close to me anymore.” Draco sighed, looking down at the blanket that was wrapped around him.
Macmillan had loudly taunted Draco about the potion failure from last time as they were stood outside the potion classroom. Blaise had told him to shut up, and Macmillan had somehow found the courage to walk up to Blaise telling him he wasn’t one to talk.
“What?!” Draco jerked up looking down at Harry with wide, blinking eyes. “You’ve exchanged letters with my mother?”
Potter seemed to notice Draco’s hesitation, but before he could utter another sentence, the sound of someone entering through the fireplace could be heard, and then what seemed like two people chatting and laughing loudly upon entry.
“I’ll drink that damn Veritaserum right here and now if that’s what you need to bloody stop all of this!” Draco groaned loudly.
If Potter thought it awkward to be sharing a bed with someone he knew had feelings for him, he didn’t show it. They both got into bed without saying much, and Draco had self-consciously tried to lay as far from Potter as he could.
“What’s wrong with you lately, mate? It feels like your personality is all wrong.” Weasley sighed loudly, and Draco realised he had to say something in order to dim the suspicion that had started to brew in Weasley’s mind.
“You’re already dying from the first transfiguration paper; I’m not really seeing how you’re going to be of much help.” Draco sighed, but put down his transfiguration paper in order to help Pansy anyway. He was already done with his potion paper and he knew Pansy wouldn’t stop whining until she got hers done.
Draco yawned as he sat up in bed. He looked at his watch which showed 4:43. Still a couple of hours until morning, Draco thought to himself.
“Sure! I’m just about done for the day. Give me five minutes and we can head up to my place” Harry said, noticing how Draco visibly relaxed by the answer he was given.
With the comfort of not having Death Eaters at his heels, Draco felt himself slowly sink into the mattress and his eyelids started to feel heavy.
“I’m not trying to impress anyone, especially not you for that matter. My wand is downstairs, and I honestly don’t use that much energy on spells anyway, so it’s fine.” The nonchalant tone and way too honest answer made Draco want to slap the guy. The fact that he admitted to not using much energy on spells in general, wandless or not, made Draco realise just how unfairly overpowered this idiot was.
“The pregnancy! Yes, of course! Please come sit!” Draco felt himself acting erratic and trying to keep calm at the same time. By Merlin if he wasn’t going to try whatever he could in order to make Granger feel better. It wasn’t much, but at least he would’ve done one good thing for each of the people he had hurt so badly in his earlier years.
“Maybe, but she won’t be able to look past the fact that a potion was brewed illegally.” Draco tensed at the word used. The realisation of what might happen to him if it was discovered made him pale. Although the potion hadn’t been a bad one or with ill intentions, it was still brewed without the knowledge of any teachers, and he had indeed taken ingredients from the potion room. With the strict rules related to any self-made projects made after the war, this could be blown out of proportions.
With his other hand he grabbed Draco’s hair and pressed them both closer together as he slipped his tongue in.
God… for a moment he had been too immersed in the brewing that he hadn’t paid particularly much attention to what he was saying, much less who he was currently conversing with. Potter’s tone had sounded so calm and collected with no hint of malice in it, which had somehow, managed to make Draco blabber on for much longer than necessary.
It was filled with a mix of Christmas decorations and New Year Eve decorations. The flat had a certain feel of warmth similar to the feel Hermione and Ron usually emitted whenever they were around.
“What now?!” Granger was erratic as she scurried over to Potter and tried to help him. “Fuck!” Draco heard Potter curse as he was being dragged over by Granger and plopped down beside him.
“Fine, you win. I’ll show you.” Harry grabbed his wand before he swiftly moved it and spoke the word “Patronus.”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed so effortlessly good at baking. Everything he had tasted this far had been better than anything he had previously tasted.
“People change Macmillan, but apparently not everyone.” Pansy scoffed, turning to Potter to check on him as well.
“Oh, most definitely. I tend to ‘accidentally’ knock a few…suspicious… ingredients into them whenever I can. However, with the bloody watchful eye you keep on me at all times, I still haven’t had the chance.”
“Oh! I didn’t realise it was this late already” Draco said, feeling a bit embarrassed for not having realised what was happening around him. He hated being seen as a bother to others.
“He’s also great at potions. He even runs his own potion shop!” Harry was definitely trying his best to put Draco in a favourable light, and Draco appreciated it. Just seeing how genuinely proud Harry seemed to be of him was making his cheeks burn.
“I’ve been meaning to talk to you for a while now” Although it was difficult to decipher what Harry was thinking from his voice alone, Draco didn’t want to stick around to hear what he was fairly certain would be an apology for not being able to accept his feelings.
“You did indeed.” Harry laughed. “Yet, despite how much I love kissing you, I’m also interested in the rest as well.”
“Ah! Shit! Are you alright” Draco panicked a bit, as he saw Harry’s mouth covered in white, dripping down the side of his lip.
“You gave us time… it was enough to allow us to escape.” Potter’s voice was soft and quiet, soothing.
“Oh, sorry!” Harry said without looking particularly surprised at how long he had been holding on to Draco’s hand. He gave it a small squeeze before retreating his hand.
“It’s been…” Draco took a moment to consider his answer. “Different, I guess. Not as easy as I thought it would be either.”
His eyelashes were long and just as dark as the raven black hair that messily framed his face. How could someone who looked so perfect possibly consider Draco, his old school nemesis as anything more than a bother?
“You’re not fooling anyone, Pansy. Fair enough that you got sick and couldn’t do it, but you could’ve postponed it, or at the very least given me a heads up.”
“Please…” Draco could only mutter as it felt agonizing to have Harry touch him all over but not where he truly wanted it.
Draco was quick with his shield, which was fortunate as Granger was unbelievable fast at throwing hexes. She was a strong opponent, and Draco could see how she was a witch to be reckoned with. They switched offense and defense, and as expected her shields were, if not as strong as his own, strong enough to withstand powerful attacks.
“I was just being clever, Potter. There was no way the Death Eaters would be able to find me here, and I just had this notion that you of all people, would be oblivious enough to danger that you wouldn’t even put up a proper protection ward around your own goddamn house…” Draco could feel his irritation seep through his words at Potter’s stupidity. Why the hell was he so laidback? Did he think that no one would ever dare come after him because he was Harry Potter?
“Er… Hi guys…” Sure, Draco had spent a lot of his time throughout his years at Hogwarts staring at Potter and following him around to taunt him whenever he got the chance. He knew his behaviour well but having to act like him was something else entirely. He had to remind himself that he was in Potter’s body, and that’s what everyone else was seeing as well.
“Yes… Yes, I remember some of it yeah.” He could only remember bits and pieces from the conversation, but frankly he was glad he seemed to remember the most important parts.
“This is insane! Why not tell McGonagall?” Weasley cried as he scowled at Draco, while being uncomfortable as the embodiment of him was standing beside him patting his shoulder.
“We’re not judging” Amelia shrugged, knowing full well that Ron was right. She and Hermione had even made it a thing to try out every drink at the bar in order to find anything that could come close to a decent taste. The pink one was the only contender.
“Not if you plan it well. And even if it is dangerous, it’s the best way to get them all. They obviously all want Draco dead, so it’s more likely that they’ll go together to attack him. I think it’s the best option, and with Harry around, he’ll protect Draco. It’s, of course, up to Draco to decide if he wants to do that though.” Draco didn’t know if it was because of Luna’s exceptionally airy voice, but somehow he felt compelled by her idea.
“It really doesn’t!” Weasley looked outraged as he stood there trying to take in what was happening. “How the hell did that happen? And more importantly, have I been interacting with Malfoy all this time, thinking it was you?”
The next couple of weeks, Draco spent a lot of time at the bakery. He felt like he was getting closer to Harry each day, and the guy was so easy to talk to. It was become a habit at this point that Draco would do some taste testing for Harry’s new recipes. He really had no idea why his opinions would be useful, but Harry had insisted that it helped him in choosing which pastry to put on the menu.
The briefs were quickly discarded, and Draco unconsciously tried to cover himself. He had never been in this situation before, and he couldn’t help the embarrassment.
“I can’t believe it. This is actually a bit hilarious.” Ginny continued, not fazed by the frowns sent her way. “Oh, what a story! The two former arch-rivals now have to live with each other and can’t get more than a couple feet away before they are in dire need to embrace one another!” The wicked grin on her face indicated that she found the situation more than a ‘bit’ hilarious.
“I’ve never thought of you as weak, Malfoy.” Potter’s eyes showed an earnest honesty as he spoke, the prior amusement replaced by seriousness.
Draco had stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity, while his mother hugged him sobbing uncontrollably. He had only shared a quick glance with Potter before Potter gave him a short nod and then turned to leave. Draco couldn’t tell whether or not Potter’s expression was filled with pity or with dislike, all he did know though, was that he felt relieved. Not just relieved, he felt like he could break down right there and then joining his mother in crying their eyes out, yet the Malfoy in him would not allow for anyone to see him like that. He patted his mother’s back as he watched Potter leave the room followed by a crowd of people who had lost all interest in the case and was now preoccupied with getting a signature or even just a glance directed towards them from the chosen one. It seemed that Potter was still true to his character of always having that overwhelming desire to save every soul he could find. It didn’t feel good to owe his whole future to Potter of all people, but he already owed him a fair share of lifetimes, what did it matter to owe one more?
“They won’t know what happened once we’re back and I start to mess up potions again.” Potter laughed.
Pansy outright ignored Draco, never letting her focus leave Potter as she smiled her most charming smile. “Thank you, I take that as a compliment. No way this sophisticated place could have grumpy over there be the face of the shop.”
“We’ll see about that.” Draco felt himself actually giving a genuine smile as Weasley opened the door and was about to leave. He halted suddenly and turned around, his face serious.
Draco’s hand trailed up to Harry’s head and drew him closer as he leaned in to kiss him on the neck. Harry groaned at the sensation, inspiring Draco to continue his exploring as he licked his neck before kissing down his collarbone. He grazed his hand down Harry’s trouser and could feel his erection strain against the material. It was sending waves of pleasure through Draco as he realised it was because of him that Harry had reacted so much. He felt himself become more and more desperate to go further.
“Yeah, so… Well, he told me his room number and said I could go visit. Should bring a headache potion if I could.”
“Er…Well…” Harry was still unsure what to do or say at this point. Only Amelia knew of what had happened at the party and with the busy life of everyone, it had been rather easy to play it off as ‘he’s been working’ or ‘he had some other matter to attend to’, which had been fine so far.
Considering how focused he had been on Potter during Hogwarts; he should’ve known better than to think that the guy-who-couldn’t-leave-anything-alone would actually do so now.
With a last cry, Draco let himself go as he felt his hole tighten around Harry and the release shoot from his cock, covering them both.
Draco felt mortified at his realisation. What had he done? Harry didn’t like him… And he had gone ahead and kissed him.
Wow, Draco thought. She really was just blatantly outing him for no reason. Great, now Potter knew about something so embarrassing as him not being able to cast a Patronus.
“I’m not gonna lie, you’re rather attractive.” Potter shrugged lightly with a small smile on his lips. “Having you stand before me like this, I can’t help but want you.”
“but now, you gotta admit” Ginny moved her hand vaguely in Potter’s direction. “he’s become fine as hell.”
“Don’t mess with something like that. And show some bloody gratitude to the fact that you’re able to live as peacefully as you do, all things considered.” Potter’s voice was low and more like a growl that sent a shiver down Draco’s spine.
It had fascinated Draco at first when he realised that he was still missing Harry even after spending most of the day with him.
Weasley turned back to his sandwich with a frown, having taken a hit by Draco’s words that had seemingly been spoken by his best friend. Draco felt a tinge of satisfaction for having managed to get to Weasley so easily this way. Perhaps the switch wasn’t as bad as he thought.
His survival instincts kicked in as he grabbed the hand that reached out to him, and yanked Potter down. It allowed him to snatch the wand from Potter’s hand before standing up and pointing it in his direction.
The past few days Draco had felt something strange when he and Potter crossed paths. He knew what had caused it though, as the previous conversation they had delved into involved lots of shouting, heavy crying and falling asleep tightly locked into an embrace with Potter.
Although Draco still had to deal with certain nightmares that belonged to Potter, he also had dreams that were mostly made up of memories from spending late nights in front of the fireplace with friends, staying at the Burrow with the Weasleys and shooting across the quidditch field feeling the wind sting his face. Those were peaceful dreams where he would wake up feeling refreshed and serene. The lack of constant nightmares had made it possible for him to regain some much-needed sleep. It might be that not everything about being Potter was great, but the amount of sleep he could finally get was a life saver.
“I get that the first time could be wrongly interpreted, but you were literally in his lap the last time. You don’t have to convince me or anything. I’m actually rooting for you to be honest.”
“I just want Harry to be happy is all. Even if that means Gryffindor losing one match, I don’t mind.” Hermione shrugged, with a small smile forming on her lips.
“I always remember you getting good marks in potion. No wonder you decided to work with it. Good choice.” Granger said, smiling slightly at him with a thumbs up in approval.
The great hall was slowly filling up as yawning students entered one after another. Draco was already positioned in-between his two friends who were chatting away about the new defense against the dark arts teacher. “I haven’t heard of her before, but hopefully it’ll be exciting.” Pansy said as she took a big bite of her sandwich.
“Oh really?” Draco barely caught Potter’s gaze drift towards him, scanning him before he himself looked away. Of course, Pansy would have to bring up something about him at every opportunity she got. Definitely trying to catch Potter’s interest towards him at any moment she could.
“Fine… I’ll give it a try. Don’t tell anyone about this conversation though… Not yet…” Hermione nodded and made a show of sealing her lips.
He had walked for a bit before he stopped. ‘What the hell?’ Draco thought to himself. He had just made that interaction way more awkward with the fact that he had been staring openly at the guy in front of him. Probably freaked him out a bit, Draco thought.
“I forced him to practice, Ron. And you should do so too. Just look at the result it can have.” Granger seemed to use the situation to both lecture Weasley as well as save Draco from the trouble of trying to explain himself. It was a good thing, Draco thought, as he would probably lash out at Weasley if he were to speak right then.
After the potion was done brewing, Draco did the final steps in order to complete it. Adding Valerian Sprigs and stirring it 7 times clockwise before waving his wand and pouring it into the sleek vials he had put forth.
“Well…It’s not like you’re gonna find anyone else in this tiny place, anyway, so why not be a bit crazy?” Pansy said between bites, with a shrug.
“Now let me see that burn.” Draco said, getting up and with a flick of his wand, vanishing the paste.
“Great! I’m glad. I was a bit worried with everything that happened these last couple of days, but I’m glad that you came to visit again. And try to take some breaks as well” Harry said as he reached his hand towards Draco.
“If you look at the bright side of things, you’re not stuck in each other’s laps anymore. It might only be a small improvement, but it’s something.” The sheepish look on Granger’s face was not overly convincing.
“Yeah! I got a bit caught up in the book. I’ll go to bed now as well.” Draco said placing the book down on the table and putting his teacup into the sink.
The pyjama set was horrible. The T-shirt was too large, hanging loosely around his thin frame, despite him being slightly taller than Potter still. The pants luckily had a waistband that he could tighten, so he didn’t have to go through any embarrassment of his pants falling down in front of his prior nemesis.
Draco put his pyjamas on and headed into the bedroom. Harry had already climbed into bed and had put his glasses on the nightstand.
“We were paying attention to you from the start and the way you froze…” Pansy cut herself off, looking off into the flames of the fire burning dimly in front of them.
“I didn’t mean to offend you or make you uncomfortable, if you hate me again, then-“ “Hate you?” Draco felt himself bristle at the fact that Potter could think he hated him. “I don’t hate you; I’ve never hated you! Sure, you were a damn pain in the arse for most of the earlier school years, but I never hated you.”
“It worked.” Draco unconsciously reached his hand out to touch Potter’s cheek. “Yeah.” Potter mumbled, looking a bit startled at the sudden intimacy. As Draco realised what he had been doing he quickly withdrew his hand.
“Do you mind turning around?” Harry said, as he had removed his trousers and boxers all together and was coating his cock with lube. Draco noted the size of it. It was thick and long.
How he suddenly became courageous enough to lean forward and meet Potter’s lips was surprising himself. But he wasn’t able to mull over the thought for much longer as Potter’s lips parted, and a hot tongue prodded at Draco’s own lips.
“That’s… good to hear.” Said Draco, his voice low. He still hadn’t had the chance to apologize to Lovegood. She had been held captive in the Malfoy Manor during the war and when he had mustered up the courage to sneak some food down to her, he could easily tell that she had been tortured. Of course, he hadn’t been able to do much at the time, but he still felt slightly responsible for having witnessed it.
The next couple of weeks, Harry had made it a point to ask Draco out several times, going on various trips around the town. It was both fun and helped Draco in getting to know all the interesting shops that were a bit hidden to the public eye.
“Really?” Potter looked slightly impressed as he continued. “I was recommended this shop by a mate. I had no idea Parkinson was so proficient at potion brewing.”
“Look, you obviously like the guy. Hell, I haven’t ever seen you this worked up about anyone before. I mean, I was a bit surprised at the fact that you were gay and all, but it makes sense considering you’ve never had much interest in girls before” Pansy said, not being the type to hold back what she thought.
Draco was sat for a moment not knowing what to do, as Harry had still not released his hand even as he continued eating the strawberry glazed waffle.
Perhaps it was the oddity of his name being used, or the fact that it was Potter of all people using it, but it made Draco stop short.
Draco sighed as he once again exited the vast building named Malfoy Company. He had been working there since he was 19 and it had now been seven years. Perhaps it would be considered a big achievement for anyone to have become the youngest CEO of Malfoy Company at the age of 26, however, to Draco it only meant more work that would add to his already exhausting schedule.
Draco blinked sleepily trying to wake up when he realised, he was being more or less cradled in Harry’s arms. He took note of the potion having worn off as he was no longer glued to Potter’s chest.
Granger sat quietly as she read through yet another enormous potion book. The two of them had spent long days at the library trying to figure out a way to reverse the effect of the potion.
It only made Harry want to do it more. Try getting even closer the blonde guy. He wanted to make him…
“Having a hard time locating the last death-eaters?” Draco said sullenly as he leaned against the office desk. He wasn’t sure why he suddenly decided to start chatting, as he had managed to get by for months with miniscule interaction with the saviour of the wizarding world.
Not having Draco around was… quite frankly… miserable. He had become far too used to the fact that Draco would show up at the bakery, smiling once he got eyes on Harry, or whenever he had come to visit his place and they had been talking and laughing about everything and nothing.
Draco once again looked up from his book as he heard some thudding noise. He looked around only to find that there were no other customers left in the bakery, and the dark-haired guy was currently putting away the chairs and cleaning.
Draco felt a thumb slide over his hole slowly. It was such a tender spot that he couldn’t help it as his legs closed involuntarily.
The next week passed by so slowly Draco almost couldn’t bear it. He hadn’t heard anything from Potter since he visited him in at St. Mungo’s, and Weasley hadn’t been to the shop during that time either. This left Draco with a lot of anxiety and Pansy with a headache from having to listen to it.
“There’s no way me and Potter would-“ Once again, Draco was cut off, although this time it probably was for the best. “Harry’s single, you know. I’m sure he wouldn’t be opposed of it if you made an effort. He seemed fairly unbothered when I thought the two of you were together the first time around.”
“Here, I put together quick dinner for you. Of course, you don’t have to eat it, but I just thought you looked a bit tired, so maybe it would be nice not to have to make it yourself” Harry said as he handed him a plastic bag with a container inside it.
Ron seemed to find the concept of it equally as hilarious as his sister. However, he seemed to sympathise more with Harry than what Ginny had done.
“Isn’t that the point though? It’s the difference that makes people attracted to one another. I think of myself as ordinary, you, on the other hand, are beautiful. You shouldn’t compare yourself with me in that regard, because it’s the uniqueness of each person that makes them attractive, even if it’s small features or big ones.”
“W-what?” As Harry had stepped back, Draco didn’t at first notice the alarm’s that was going off on Harry’s reaction. He was instead too amazed at having had the courage to do something he had wanted to do for quite some time now.
“Yes... She told me think it through properly, and that I shouldn’t just disregard it because of him being a guy and all that” Harry was desperate to hear what Hermione had to say. She was usually much better than him when it came to understanding the big picture and thinking calmly.
“Ah… Could I get one of those” Draco looked at the many pastries lined up neatly behind the counter. “And an iced tea, please”.
“Yes… definitely…” Draco mumbled. “Please…” He knew he was more or less begging, but he didn’t mind. He wanted to feel Harry inside of him, to be connected.
“Here, take this.” Draco handed Potter a vial containing a light blue potion. It was one of his own concoctions that had been highly effective on internal pains such as that Potter was showing.
Potter seemed unaware of the effects he was having on him at the moment and continued on lecturing about something that barely registered in Draco’s head.
As he looked down, he groaned loudly. Potter’s closeness had had some unfortunate effect on another part of Draco as well. “Bastard.” Draco mumbled into his hands as he rubbed his face tiredly, hoping Potter hadn’t noticed his embarrassment.
As Potter moved down and his mouth latched onto one of Draco’s nipples, he also slipped a hand under his pants grasping Draco’s cock. It made Draco squirm and moan loudly from the sudden feel of Potter’s hand on his bare cock.
Draco and Amelia chatted for a bit, as Draco made his decision on what drink would work the best with the cheesecake.
“Wait,” Draco perched his head up slightly, trying to look at Potter, but gave up when the closeness of their faces was too much to handle. “You just used non-verbal magic, without your wand, didn’t you?”
The excuse of being behind on his work hadn’t been that accurate as he after a few hours over time was done with the few things he had been postponing in order to spend time at the bakery.
Blaise mumbled something about wanting to get some rest before the start of lectures and Draco thought he would do the same.
“Shut it, Malfoy! You wouldn’t understand!” Ron sniffed, and Draco could only look on in astonishment as Potter and Weasley continued their bromance with reassurances and saying they would always tell each other everything, yada, yada…
“So… You’re telling me what…you’ve changed bodies?” Draco would’ve laughed at the look of utter bewilderment on her face, had he not been feeling the exact same thing himself.
Impressively enough she managed to keep the other two from speaking until they were sat in charms class listening to the professor.
Draco furrowed his brows as he tried to determine where Potter would steer towards, but he was still keeping a steady course straight towards Draco.
“Oh God, Draco…You’re so good.” Harry breathed as he pushed inside with more force. Draco felt the sensation of Harry hitting a spot inside of him which made him arch his back and moan loudly.
“I don’t mind” Draco said as he sat down in the sofa. It was nice to be back here once again. The fire was lit, and it was as cosy as it had always been.
“Wake up now, or I’ll hex you!” Draco hissed, as he shook Potter’s shoulders, or his own shoulders that was.
“Well, those ‘few left’” Draco said, avoiding Potter’s eyes. “are fairly set on getting rid of the…traitors.” As Draco gave a quick look at the two, he realised their eyes were not meeting his. He followed their gaze, only to realise he had been clutching his left arm right where the dark mark was hidden underneath his robes. He quickly let go and cleared his throat, getting their attention once again.
Potter had a sheepish grin on his face there he stood between a disgruntled Granger and an amused Weasley. Draco scoffed silently. He was well aware that the potion was a complete failure and would need several changes for it to even remotely resemble the potion in question. Shrew seemed too infatuated with the glorious saviour to see the many faults in front of him.
Harry took a moment to look at Draco, it made him uncomfortable with not knowing if it would end with him saying it’s probably best to stop or something like that.
Potter smiled slightly at that and gave an understanding nod. Draco turned to check on some of the other potions he was working on that needed time to brew and felt his cheeks tingle slightly with warmth.
Draco realised to his horror that he had almost passed out on top of the other guy when said guy cleared his throat. “If you’re done snuggling, do you mind telling me what the actual fuck created this predicament?”
Draco was presented with buttered toast and fruit, a croissant, and some porridge, together with the tea and a glass of water.
“Your place is ten times better than mine. It has every necessity, but most importantly it has warmth…” Draco said looking around the living room and feeling the calmness wash over him. This was now the place he would spend his time, a place where he could feel happiness and warmth wherever he looked. It was perfect.
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as he clutched onto Harry’s black hair. Carefully Harry started sucking him off, and it was sending waves of pleasure through Draco’s body.
“He’s one of my best friends! You should’ve just dealt with it properly. Don’t go around making me look bad, just because you can!” Potter grabbed his collar, and Draco felt like he was in a surreal situation at this point. He knew it was Potter before him, but it was his own face that was firing a deadly glare towards him. ‘How odd…’ He thought.
Everyone went silent as Weasley’s voice rang out. To be fair it seemed like it wasn’t just Draco who had forgotten that Weasley had been dragged into the whole ordeal at this point as well.
Before Draco could tell him not to stare, Harry started tracing his chest once more. He slowly made his way to his nipples.
Draco muttered a good night before resuming to his homework. Half an hour had gone by when Pansy showed up. “You’re up late.” She said as she sat down in the sofa next to him, handing him a cup of hot chocolate.
After Ginny and Luna said their goodbyes, Potter had spent most of the day working on reports, only stopping to make them dinner before diving back in. And since Draco was unable to move far away from the guy, he had settled down on the couch with a book. They had spent hours in a comfortable silence before Draco spoke.
“No… This is great… It’s the first time I’ve received a gift this well thought out. I can’t believe you remembered about all these things” Harry grinned.
“Wait, what??” Draco tried once more out of habit to get as far away from the lunatic as he could, which meant still being firmly stuck to him no matter the flailing.
“Maybe…” Draco muttered, slightly abashed at the compliment. He almost jumped as the alarm went off, and he got back to the potion at hand.
Looking at the stag in front of him, Draco put his hands in front of his face. “Merlin…” He muttered.
“Ah! Fuck! That’s soo….” Words spilled from Draco’s mouth as he felt himself become undone. “sooo… Good...”
“It’s sturdy enough, I’m sure the satisfaction will outweigh the damage.” Draco shrugged. Again, Draco was only given a light chuckle, as Potter turned to head out the door.
“I can’t risk that, and you don’t know anything about me or my reasons!” Okay, so that last part had hit a bit too close to home as Draco had, in fact, been regretting his very decision when he lied on the cold stones certain he was breathing his last breaths.
“As if you’re one to talk Parkinson! You’re just as bad, and honestly you shouldn’t have come back here, none of you should have!” Finch-Fletchley, who always seemed to stick by Macmillan’s side shouted out.
“I-…how did you…?” Draco just sat there in utter shock his face starting to burn, unable to even throw an insult at the guy. How did he know. Why the hell would he even think that? Why was he trampling all over Draco’s desperation to keep those feelings buried? When had he slipped up?
“I do believe I can say with certainty that I won’t be turned off” Draco’s breath caught in his throat for a moment as he felt his hand caress over Harry’s pants. He was definitely hard, there was no denying that.
A strange notion came over Draco as he realised just how easy it was to work with Hermione. She had the same level of understanding as him and they seemed to easily catch up on each other’s reasonings and decisions.
“A bit too smart if you ask me.” She sighed and sat down in the chair beside Draco’s. They were seated in front of a large fireplace with dancing flames casting an orange light over the room.
Draco unconsciously tried to cover himself with his hands, as he felt vulnerable and too exposed. “You know, I’ve already seen your body before, but seeing it like this…” Harry breathed shakingly as he reached for Draco’s hands, bringing them to his mouth and kissing them tenderly. “You’re beautiful.” He muttered as he took in the sight in front of him.
It was interesting for Draco to watch how Harry interacted with people. He seemed to know most of the people in town, and especially the ones who were also dabbling in the same business as him.
“Hey Harry! What’s-“ Draco felt himself startle slightly at the sudden voice breaking the silence. A few seconds passed of Granger most likely trying to take in what she was seeing and process it.
Harry slid one finger up Draco’s shaft, and it sent tremors through his body. Harry gripped tightly around his cock and started pumping it slowly. It made Draco moan as he arched his back into the touch. Harry’s eyes seemed to grow darker as a smile tugged at his lips.
“You need to recover. You should rest.” Potter said, and to Draco’s horror his voice had a slight hint of sympathy to it.
“Yeah… Not really used to this type of weather” Draco felt embarrassed, as his appearance had always been important to him. Now he felt pretty shabby in front of this guy that managed to look stylish even in a black t-shirt and jeans.
Amelia was sure that if Harry had been in a relationship at this time, the girl would’ve been filled with jealousy over the way Draco was treated.
“Here.” He said as he walked over and placed the vial on the table. “It might not be the best taste on it, but it will give instant effect, so if you manage to stomach it, you’ll see the results at once.” Draco said, feeling nervous as he watched Granger study the vial for a moment before downing it and scrunching her nose slightly.
He barely knew the guy in front of him, and now here he was drenched at his doorstep and about to take a shower at this guy’s place. They weren’t even friends, wasn’t this a bit too weird? Draco thought.
“It’s Malfoy! Why the hell am I the only one freaking out about this?” Weasley looked around the room at the others, trying to get some support from his friends.
Draco jumped back and in his moment of panic he whipped his pillow and smacked the great Harry Potter straight across the face earning himself a loud “What the fuck?!”
“No, not at all… It’s not… good… I do miss hanging out with him and having him taste all the new pastries was always something I looked forward to, but still…”. Amelia could see the frustration in her brother’s eyes. He had barely made any new recipes since the party and wasn’t putting more effort into his work than strictly necessary. This worried her, because Harry’s whole world revolved around baking.
“I’ve never done this before.” Harry’s voice was soft as he spoke. Draco leaned up, pressing their lips together. “Me neither.”
to make an effort.” Granger was scolding Weasley who looked miserable there he sat at the potion desk picking at the cauldron in front of him.
It wasn’t that he disliked Potter or anything, but he felt embarrassment. He had let his feelings take over the other day and had been completely honest with Potter there he stood shouting at him. Potter had been calm throughout it all and hugged him until he fell asleep. That definitely made him a decent guy, but Draco couldn’t help it.
The whole day felt strange to him, as he found he did not fear being hexed at every corner. People were constantly smiling at him whenever they passed by him, and sometimes a first or second year would muster up the courage to ask him for an autograph.
“Are you done flirting now?” Draco huffed out. It was awkward enough to see Pansy blabber on with Potter like old friends, but to have them seemingly flirt with each other was just disturbing in Draco’s opinion.
“And five of the pre ordered dresses had been manufactured wrong! Can you believe it?! I had to deal with a mob of angry customers and Sally decided it was the perfect moment to have a break which meant I had to deal with it on my own! I’m gonna snitch on her to the boss first chance I see him.” Pansy was on the last part of her rant and had calmed down considerably by now. Although she still looked fairly capable of murder.
Regardless of the utterly distasteful attire Potter had thrown at him, it was a relief to get out of his robes. He still felt filthy from the fight and months on the run, so he decided to bury his demands and use the simple shower. The Bathroom was smaller than the one he had landed in, and this one didn’t include a bathtub. Draco wanted to mock the simplicity of it, but it was difficult to do so when he had spent months hiding from the death eaters that had decided to make him their next target.
“Well, I guess until the storm clears a bit…” Draco said, unable to resist the good offer in front of him.
“And if it all fails you can just move to Italy with me. There’s lots of handsome guys over there” She said as she found a particularly tasty looking Berliner pastry.
“I’m not about to spend the rest of my life stuck to Potter of all people.” Draco couldn’t help the slight sneer that crept into his exasperated voice. It was true after all.
Amelia found it interesting, as she had never heard her brother talk about any of his previous girlfriends in such a fashion. Although he always treated everyone nicely, he had always seemed more or less indifferent to people. This time however, Amelia could feel that something was different. He went to far greater lengths to keep in contact with Draco and he also seemed like he was actually enjoying his time whenever he was with the blonde guy.
She cleared her throat as she motioned at the same chair as last time. “Please sit.” She regarded him closely as he inched over to the chair and sat down.
Draco checked his bag once more, making sure the potions were still there. There was a tinge of nervousness flowing through him as he started walking down one of the dark back alleys of Knockturn alley.
He would reach out to put a strand of blonde hair behind the guy’s ear, and before he could retract his hand, he felt a quick shiver from Draco.
Draco just looked at him. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. His mother hadn’t once mentioned anything about Harry and her exchanging letters.
He allowed Potter to lead him over to one of the benches where he summoned a mattress without his wand. It was nothing new that the saviour of the wizarding world could do wandless magic effortlessly, but it was still impressive to witness in action.
“Hey,” Draco reached out to stop Potter before walking into class. “What was up with Weasley? Why is he acting like that? Should we be worried?” Potter looked at him for a moment with furrowed brows trying to take in the rapid fire of questioning going on.
Draco knew his cheeks had turned pink and huffed in response to the compliment, rushing to explain how it should be used instead.
‘I’ll have time to think about it before the New Year Eve party’ Draco sighed to himself before getting through the last paperwork he had left for the day.
“Actually, it went rather well.” Draco said, feeling pride swell in his chest as he continued. “I managed to conjure a Patronus if you must know.” He tried sounding nonchalant.
“You were mumbling. What are you thinking about?” Pansy sat down beside him, studying his face as she spoke.
“Oh… Yeah.” Potter looked sheepish for a moment. “I didn’t think about it really. I got too shocked about the sudden downpour and just made a run for your shop instead.” He seemed to laugh a bit at his own silliness, but Draco couldn’t help but enjoy the fact that Potter had automatically gone towards his shop instead of taking shelter wherever.
“I know…” Draco said, trying to reassure himself as well, but not being overly successful. “But it’s the best option right now. And if it means I’ll no longer have to look over my shoulder every day, then I’m willing to take the risk.”
A little while passed, and just as Potter seemed to focus his attention back at the report, Draco frowned as he eyed the fireplace. “Shouldn’t Granger have found something by now?”
“I’m… I’m coming.” Harry breathed shallowly into his ear. “Me… too…” Draco barely managed to whisper.
“Of course, I want to be an Auror, Harry! You already knew that.” Weasley looked dumbfounded at the question. “You’ll apply for an Auror position as well, won’t you?”
“Potter?!” Draco managed to bark out, before he was regrettably forced back down into Potter’s lap. He groaned as he landed and started cussing at the naked guy in front of him, or well… underneath him. “Let go of me, you dimwit!”.
“Look, I’m not an idiot, I can see that you’re not overly happy to see me, but I definitely need this potion today, so please. If you could do it now, I’d be extremely grateful.” It was strange, really, to hear Potter speak in such a composed and, frankly, polite way to him. Perhaps Potter had grown up a bit throughout the last couple of years.
The apartment felt neither too small nor too big and Draco noted that it looked rather stylish, but homely as well.
Although he once again wanted to decline the offer, he fell victim to the cosy warmth from the fireplace and hearing the heavy rain continue to beat down on the windows, made it even harder to decline.
“Just the view is enough to send me over” Harry gasped as he looked down on Draco’s back, it looked like he was actually properly making love to him.
“I don’t care about that! How long have you been together exactly? And why haven’t you told any of us yet? What do you think Ron is going to think of this?” Said Ginny continuing her bombardment.
Opening the door to the shared room revealed that it was empty. “Good.” Draco muttered to himself as he figured he might be able to get into bed before Potter got back.
“I simply let you win, remember? Imagine the uproar if the chosen one had lost. I only did you a favour. Nothing more than pity.” It was a feeble attempt at redeeming his losses, but Draco still didn’t give in.
Draco pondered. Pansy’s good mood had turned into that of an interrogator instead of marvelling at the idea of his Patronus’s shape.
“You’re beautiful…” Harry mumbled as he looked down on Draco. He started cleaning him off, but Draco stopped his hand.
The idea of returning to Hogwarts was far from what he had imagined. Yet, the possibility of finding any sort of work in the wizarding world without N.E.W.T.s. after the war was close to zero when your last name was Malfoy.
Draco felt a twitch in his hand, as he thought back to the nightmares that had involved you-know-who far too many times. “I did.” He said curtly.
“But getting in there isn’t that easy. I had to go through many classes trying to procure the ingredients I needed in order to not seem overly suspicious.” Draco sighed at the thought of having to go through the same procedure once more.
“Malfoy.” She looked sick to her stomach, and Draco felt himself shrink under her gaze. There was no saving this, was there?
“The time of day it is taken is important for how well it’ll work, huh? That’s good to know.” Potter’s lips were too close to Draco’s ear, and his breath was tingling, sending shivers through Draco’s body.
Draco hesitated for a moment, before sitting down beside Potter and taking over his side of the chess board.
“As forgetful as ever, are we? You’re lucky to have saved the world, or your only chance at passing the exams would have been to start over from first year.”  Draco said with a sneer before he could stop himself. It wasn’t the time to start a quarrel, but just seeing Potter’s face was annoying, and having felt his heart jump out of his chest as Potter barged in only soured his mood further. It just felt easier to let the frustration out on him.
Draco couldn’t help but wonder who those ‘people’ were that had had the chance to touch Potter’s hair before him. “I don’t mind though. I like your touch, you have nice hands”
It wasn’t long until Draco realised that the number of people that he could get along with were scarce. The only person he knew would be safe to room with was Blaise, which, with the new rule would be impossible.
“Okay” Draco said as he was shown to the bathroom and the guy hurrying off to find him some clothes.
“I would say flattery won’t get you anything, but the free drinks make it difficult to say that” Amelia joked.
This time the previously shocked expression was replaced by a look of embarrassment as Granger saw who was standing in her doorway.
Granger seemed to let it slide though, as she nodded and muttered something about incessant late-night studies potentially being too much for him.
“Oh… Well, since you’re doing me a favour with the Patronus, I figured some of the vials are me paying you back for it.”
“You alright, Harry?” Granger studied him closely with worried eyes. She was quick at sensing things, so Draco couldn’t afford to blurt out anything else.
“Yeah?” Draco said, kissing him. “I’m glad to hear that.” He smiled back, as Harry deepened the kiss more.
“You okay?” Draco looked at the scene unfolding, seeing the people who had been hunting him for months finally unable to get to him. Something inside of him lifted and he suddenly felt very lightheaded there he sat.
Draco couldn’t help it as he felt himself doze off. He was exhausted. There had been far too much happening in one day, and he had exerted all his energy. Harry seemed just as tired as he slid an arm across Draco’s chest and snuggled into him.
“What? No!” Draco knew he wasn’t sounding overly convincing, but he blamed it on the fact that Potter had ambushed him, and he hadn’t been given enough time to think. It wasn’t helping that Potter was standing exceptionally close to him.
“Well, I don’t think I would’ve ever tried so hard had it not been for your lessons. So, really. Thank you.”
“Don’t worry. I have faith that it’ll work.” Potter gave him a reassuring smile, as if reading his mind. “And if it doesn’t?” Draco could hear his own worry drip off his words.
Potter smiled in return. It was a smile Draco had only seen from his mother and Pansy throughout his life. It showed true pride in his achievement. Who would’ve ever thought Potter would be the third person to show him that?
Just as Draco felt like Harry would truly win, his fingers inches in front of his own, Harry slowed down just enough so that Draco snatched the golden ball.
“You’re not even the slightest worried about what your dear brother will think of it? Even if you’re just joking around? If he heard you now I’m certain you’d be on the receiving end of a depressingly bad and most likely backfiring jinx by now.”
Potter was giving him a sheepish grin as he scratched his head. “It’s not like I’m doing it on purpose.”
“Guys… I think Malfoy might be up to something.” Both Granger and Draco halted their actions, looking at Weasley.
“I’m… close…” Harry breathed out, making Draco shiver. He felt himself nearing the edge as well with every hard thrust.
“You have to eat something, or you’ll get sick during the match.” Pansy looked concerned as her eyes darted between the uneaten soup and Draco’s face.
“You know, if you’d want to get on better terms with Ron, it would be a good idea to just lean into the whole idea that the Chudley Cannons actually know how to play.” Ginny said.
The Gryffindor’s must’ve had training today, Draco noted as he watched the last player walk over to one of the lockers in only a towel hanging dangerously low on his hips. His arms toned with strong muscles visible from afar.
“And you can’t deny that he’s hot, now can you?” She eyed him, obviously looking for some sort of reaction and boy did she get one.
“Have you gone nuts!? Why would you come to his shop if you know he works here?” Weasley accused, looking between Potter and Draco like he was certain someone would interrupt and call it all out as a big joke on his behalf and they could all (expect Draco) laugh about it and drink away any memories of it ever happening. “He’s bloody Malfoy for Merlin’s sake! Shouldn’t you be a bit more cautious around the git?”
“I want to make you mine” Harry said as he leaned down and started kissing Draco’s neck. It made Draco shudder, but he didn’t resist it. It felt… good… Draco thought.
Before Draco could pull himself together and start getting up, he was forcefully thrown backwards, as Potter jerked up into a sitting position. All Draco could do in order to not fall backwards completely was to grab onto Potter’s neck.
“Fine.” Draco said reluctantly, he knew it would be bad for business to refuse an order after having made an appointment. It wasn’t something he wanted the shop to be known for. And despite how decent Potter seemed to be at the moment, if he were to throw out any sort of negative comment about the shop to the prophet or something, Draco would be out of business before he could even blink. That was the curse of dealing with famous people. Especially famous people who knew far too much about him.
“No, I mean that normally I would hate to be in a situation like this with anyone, even those close to me.” Draco yelped as Potter slightly lifted him to better position himself on the couch, with Draco on top of him. “But somehow I don’t really mind when it comes to you.”
Draco heard the usual woosh sound that indicated someone had just arrived through the Floo and then heard Granger clear her throat once.
“She said she talked to you the other day and you confirmed it. I asked whether you explicitly said it or not, and that made her a bit more unsure, but still not enough to make her believe my objections properly.” Potter shrugged. He looked far too calm about the whole ordeal in Draco’s opinion.
“When Potter was right in front of you, you froze. You looked like you were unable to take your eyes off him. It didn’t really help that everyone saw the look he gave you and the freaking wink at the end. People might not say anything out loud, but they do whisper about rumours between the two of you.”
“Can you blame me? He has to deal with you on a daily basis. I’d feel bad for anyone being in that kind of a situation.”
Pansy was difficult to deal with in these situations, as she always seemed to see right through him until he said what he was actually thinking. This had happened so many times, that he had eventually started giving up much faster.
“I seriously wasn’t!” Laughter could be heard throughout the small cabin as the smell of breakfast filled the air.
“This is amazing!” Draco looked up in awe at the guy in front of him. To him it was a bit difficult to comprehend how someone could just be this naturally good at something. Sure, he was good at his job, but he had worked hard every single day for it and even then, he felt like he never truly got to a point of feeling satisfied with his work.
Potter just laughed as Draco busied himself with the potion in front of him and refused to lift his head for the remained of time Potter was there.
“Yeah, it’s definitely more private to come here. The Apothecary was always too crowded for my taste.” Potter responded.
“Oh, most definitely. They said it was most likely due to exhaustion more than anything else. Just needed to rest for a bit. Ron got all worked up about it, so that just led to Hermione giving me a lecture the moment I woke up.” Potter had a sullen face as he seemed to be remembering the event. “That reminds me! Thank you for the headache potion. It was delightful compared to anything else I’ve tasted. It was also a big life saver when Hermione was finally done lecturing. Worked incredibly fast as well.”
“You’re far too easy to wrap around my finger.” Draco scoffed, earning himself a hearty laugh from Harry.
“I was making fun of him, that’s all!” Draco said, but to no avail. No one was interested in hearing his excuses any further. Potter only chuckled lightly, seemingly unable to make much more commentary on that than Draco could himself.
After a few more tries, the shield still stood tall and strong not allowing any hex to pass by it. Draco sighed, motioning for them to switch.
Even if it was only a tiny chance of Harry liking him back, he couldn’t let it slip by him without even trying.
When the moment of having to wait for the potion to brew came, Draco was fairly certain Potter had become more familiar with the brewing room than he himself was.
Draco sighed as he stopped stirring the soup. “What’s the point? I’m up against the wonder boy who obviously has a broom that exceeds everyone else’s anyway.”
Draco narrowed his eyes slightly as he regarded Potter who was whipping up a sauce at the moment. “Never mind…” Draco huffed out in defeat, as Potter looked unbothered by his own prior actions.
Harry only chuckled a bit before saying “I’m fine, don’t worry”. He wiped his mouth a bit, before looking back at Draco.
“I hope you’re going to say something along the lines of good, great or amazing. If not, then please let me linger a bit longer in my own bliss” Harry joked as he stroked Draco’s hair.
Feeling disoriented he slowly turned around and saw a bed to his left, enclosed by the bed curtains. It was then that he realised his own curtains were open.
just a misunderstanding, are you?” Granger leaned over her desk as she propped her head on her hands.
They had spent so much time together, and Draco had spent more than a few times sleeping over at his place. Harry had never really thought about it before, but he now realised that it felt like Draco didn’t really have anyone else around him that he was close to.
As he could no longer see the owl, he turned and grabbed his cloak before heading to the door. He looked back at the shared dorm room. It no longer held signs of being two separate parts of a room. He smiled to himself as he twirled his cloak over his shoulders and grabbed the handle.
Potter frowned at him for a second before nodding and stepping back. Draco managed to deflect the next few hexes with his shield, but still he couldn’t help but notice that the hexes sent his way was barely average compared to the first hex. Potter was going easy on him.
Pansy and Hermione was in a serious discussion involving the exams coming up before Christmas. Those two weren’t the ones who should be worrying about passing to be honest, Draco thought to himself. Ron was the biggest concern to the whole group at this point, although Draco still couldn’t help the uneasy feeling of Harry being so damn calm about everything. It was stressing him out, but he knew, if anyone was going to somehow get through it against all odds it would be none other than Harry Potter.
Pansy was lurking behind him and had obviously been keeping an eye on the whole situation while pretending to be busy with everything else.
Miraculously enough he slept better than he had in ages. Waking up the next morning Draco felt more refreshed than he had in a long time.
“Obviously not! The Holyhead Harpies are far superior. Have you even seen a match from the Chudley Cannons? They are probably one of the worst teams out there!”
“Potter! It’s me Malfoy. You’re in my damn body for Merlin’s sake!” Potter still seemed suspicious, but a little more awake after the hit, which made him snap out of the ‘it’s all a dream’ thought process.
“Of course, take your time.” Harry said softly, stroking Draco’s hair. They both stayed like that for a while, Harry keeping completely still until Draco took a deep breath and gazed up at him.
“Hey, Malfoy…” Draco kept quiet, hoping Potter would just leave him be. Or perhaps just sit silently outside the door so that the damn pain wouldn’t be so bad.
Both Pansy and Blaise looked a mix of shocked and delighted at the news of the potion working and was drawn into Hermione’s talk about how she and Draco had been working on finding a potion for ages.
“Harry! Hermione’s been so secretive about-“ He stopped short as he noticed the other presence in the room. “Malfoy?!” He shrieked.
“Yes, that must be quite a lot of work to deal with in itself.” Draco agreed, knowing he could’ve never managed such a task himself.
“How do you survive the constant questioning and demands. It’s a bloody nightmare.” Draco scoffed, as he leaned back down on his pillow.
Draco took a bite of the cake, and he really couldn’t believe something could even taste this good. Beside the quiet atmosphere, the pastries at this place was insane Draco thought to himself. He had tasted a big variety of pastries before and most of them being from high class restaurants or bakeries, yet, somehow, they couldn’t compete with the few pastries he had tried out at this bakery.
“You should mind your own busin- Ack!” Draco yelped as he felt himself being hoisted up from the water. Somehow the effort it took for Potter to get to his feet, with Draco glued to his chest and his robes heavy from the soaking was surprisingly less than Draco had expected. Once again, Draco decided to chalk it up to Potter’s Auror training. It was no secret that Potter had become stronger and built muscles during the years after the war. The prophecy was all over him, salivating at every move the man did. Obviously, it was being devoured by all the singles out there trying desperately to possess the most famous person in history. Draco, on the other hand, had snickered as he could only see Potter as the scrawny little boy in too big hand-me down clothes that dragged his feet around Hogwarts looking like he most certainly had never seen a proper attire during his lifetime.
Draco yelped loudly as he looked down at the sleeping figure in front of him. There was no mistaking it. He was looking at his own face, sleeping with a small frown.
“Merlin… I’m amazed they managed to pass the writing tests for the Auror department.” Draco said jokingly.
“You’ll have to take the potion for a week to be sure it heals properly, and no long-lasting damage occurs.” Draco said, leaning back against the counter behind him and eyeing Potter as he stood up and stretched, giving Draco more than a good view and a few new unholy thoughts.
Draco noted just how strong Potter had become over the last couple of years. He was no longer the weak and lanky student that Draco had taunted throughout their school years.
“I can’t believe I did that.” Draco was still in shock as he leaned back and looked at Potter, who was grinning at him. However, he was starting to feel the high of the adrenaline slowly seep out of him as he started to land again, and realisation dawned on him that he was still holding onto Potter.
“Well, no pressure, but if you want, you’re welcome to celebrate here. It’s just my sister and her boyfriend and two of my friends, so one more is always welcomed” Harry smiled, and had Draco heard even a hint of pity in the guy’s voice, he would’ve instantly declined, but to be honest, there was no inclination of Harry feeling pity towards him. Instead it felt like a genuine invitation.
He quietly tip-toed over and saw Potter sitting in the sofa, a blanket over his legs as he was reading a book. “Couldn’t sleep?” Potter looked up as Draco stood at the opposite edge of the sofa.
“Oh my! That’s very interesting!” Shrew quickly covered up his shock before adding “A hint of ginger roots would’ve made it perfect!” He said as he studied the total chaos that was erupting from Potter’s cauldron.
Harry got hold of his shoulders and softly pushed him down to the mattress. He continued kissing him, Draco leaned his head back allowing Harry more space to explore his neck, leaving marks as he kissed down to his collarbone. He left butterfly kisses down his stomach, stopping at the edge of Draco’s trousers. With a slow pace he unbuttoned them and pulled the zipper down.
“Expecto Patronum!” He felt a small surge go from his arm and out into his wand, before it disappeared again.
After having spent several days contemplating, Draco had made a slip of the tongue and accidentally revealed his daydreaming of wanting to own a potion shop. Pansy hadn’t even let him realise his own mistake before she had jumped on the idea.
She proudly held up the book in front of everyone “it’s the newest British bake-off book! And it’s even signed!”
“I’ll have to leave now to reach the train, thanks for driving me” Pansy said as she opened the door of Draco’s car.
“What about him as a person though? You’ve got the chance to experience his life as well as being around him enough to understand his personality, haven’t you?”
“It is, isn’t it? I’m confident when I say she’s the best minister there has ever been!” Weasley grinned obviously proud of showing off his wife’s amazing career life.
“Any other person would’ve got their hopes up if someone were touching them the way you’ve been doing for the last week or so.”
He felt the rush of wind as Potter came to a halt right beside him, their knees touching as Draco’s eyes widen. For a second everything stood still. Potter’s face was inches from his own, and without a word Potter’s hand grasped the air besides Draco’s head in a mere second.
Harry chuckled as he grabbed hold of Draco’s pyjama pant and underwear, sliding it down to reveal his hard on.
“It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.” – Agatha Christie.
“See, when you cast the Patronus you have to focus on a thought that makes you really happy. The Patronus, as I’m sure you know already, is a positive force of happiness, hope, a desire to survive, which ultimately is what Dementors feeds upon. However, the Patronus cannot feel despair like humans can, and therefore dementors can’t hurt it. It can also be used to send messages to others and it’s quite a difficult spell to learn.” Potter started saying, moving closer to Draco.
“What?!” Draco gaped, and it was an unsatisfying feeling to see Harry grin at his overly heated face.
Draco noticed that Harry was being silent for some reason, as he looked up, he was met with those emerald green eyes staring directly at him.
“You are aware that you’re a witch, right? No need to go make it. You can just spell it.” Draco said, not looking over at Potter, as their close proximity was already making him feel on edge. Little did it help that Potter had no issues openly looking at Draco as he pleased. Humming lightly in amusement to what Draco had said.
“I don’t want to be a bother, I’m sure I’ll be able to get back home” Draco said back, feeling a bit torn between not wanting to bother others and the dreadful thought of having to walk through this weather.
“Why would you want to?” Draco whispered, feeling vulnerable for asking something like that. But he couldn’t take the chance that Potter was messing with him. It wouldn’t be something he could come back from.
Draco put on his now dry clothes that Harry had folded and placed on one of the dining table chairs. He went down the stairs and outside.
“No need to sound so depressed about it.” Draco felt a little less obligated to fight after hearing Potter’s statement.
“There’s one thing though…” Draco could feel the ominous presence of bad news from Potter as he spoke. “If you don’t want to make a big scene out of this, you’ll have to go get her.”
“Me too! No one told me just how important it would be to be able to make your own food once you got older. I blame society!” Ron said, proud of having found another person who was as shite as him when it came to the culinary arts.
“Surely, you must be joking Potter.” Draco frowned in disbelief as he tried to discern the look on Potter’s face. Was he just mocking Draco for his feelings or was he actually being genuine? Draco didn’t trust himself to know which it was.
“No, he’s right ‘Mione. We still haven’t apprehended all of them. It’s on us to make the wizarding world safe after all.” It was in moments like these that Draco most resented Potter. Since when had he become someone who would take Draco’s criticism without putting up a fight? And he even dared to have a look of remorse in his eyes as he said it.
“For once I wish I could give you a decent answer, ‘Mione…” Potter sighed tiredly. “But I really have no clue what is going on myself. We’re stuck. Do you mind stepping through?”
Although Draco enjoyed feeling like his former self in the way he was being treated as Harry Potter, he also found himself understanding Potter’s life a bit more. He had always thought him to be a selfish prick that didn’t have to worry about anything since everyone adored him.
This prompted the redhead to release her grip on Potter and look over his shoulder. Once again, was he met with a look of utter shock from one of Potter’s friends. “Malfoy?!”
“We better head for the room of requirements for this though.” Granger said as she looked around the library.
The feeling of another finger added more pressure again, and Draco had to steady himself. “You’re doing good.” Harry murmured as he slowed down his pace even more. “You’re so beautiful, Draco.” Harry kept his pace slow and steady as he waited until Draco started easing up a bit once more.
Draco’s mind went completely blank as he felt his body react to Harry’s words. The teasing was enough to send him over the edge and he moaned loudly as he felt his groin contract and white, sticky semen covered his belly.
“There’s no time to act innocent, I know what you’re up to.” Potter’s hold on him was still impossible to shake off, and Draco felt unwell. He knew the consequences it would have to be found out, especially if it was an Auror that found out about it. This could be the end of him.
Draco could hear the amusement mixing with a tiny bit of worry in Harry’s voice. For all he knew, it might actually look like he was in pain as Harry barely put his thumb inside of him.
“You better get a new prescription on those glasses! Don’t disrespect my taste in men. Potter you’re the most handsome guy in the universe. Even the sun can’t compete with how hot you are.”
“Fuck me!” Draco groaned as he looked down and saw the glorious sight of having Harry Potter, his unrequited love, in between his legs, giving him a mind-blowing blowjob.
He had never been the type to put functional over fashion, which was now coming back to bite him as he felt uncomfortable in his wet clothes clinging to his body.
“Yeah, we always close up for a few days around Christmas. Makes everyone in the company a lot happier as well”.
A sudden hint of panic hit Draco as he came to the realisation that the two of them would have a head on collision if Potter continued what he was doing. Draco knew he had reacted too late and wouldn’t manage to get out of Potter’s way in time. He clutched his broom firmly, as he waited for the impact.
“This one is definitely a great option. Is your friend more into sweet stuff or salty? Any particular things they like?” Harry was keeping his eyes on Draco with more confident than Draco had felt at the New Year Eve party.
“Well… Er… It’s valentine’s day, so I just… Maybe if you don’t feel too exhausted, we could make some… together”.
The softness of Potter’s lips was amazing against Draco’s own. He felt himself grab hold of Potter’s shirt as he allowed Potter’s tongue to enter his mouth.
A moment of ear deafening silence ensued as both parties sat there looking at each other. Potter looking taken aback by the second time of Draco admitting to something he’d swore would never be said out loud. And Draco being just as taken aback by realising that he had said too much in his moment of anger.
“You’ve been to one?” Draco looked at him with wide eyes. He didn’t think Harry of all people would ever be needing the help of a mind healer. He was a hero after all, wasn’t he? But then again, that was ignorant to think. If anything, Harry had been through the most.
Draco inhaled sharply as Potter placed both hands on his cheeks and leaned in. Automatically his eyes closed, and a rush of emotions surged through him as he braced himself for what was going to happen. This time for sure, he would finally be able to feel Potter’s lips on his.
Draco gave a nod, indicating that he could continue thrusting into him. Harry once more pulled out and pushed back in with a little more force this time.
The bakery was fairly quiet at the moment, and Draco could make out the few of the regulars faces around the tables.
“Just lift your hips up a bit” Harry got hold of Draco’s hips and steadied him with some pillows beneath his stomach.
“Ah, this is a great example on what not to do.” Professor Shrew was inspecting the mess and seemed overly gleeful at the fact that Malfoy had finally messed up. “Sadly, not everyone has an aptitude for potion making.”
He felt the force of the orgasm hit him deep. It was nothing like jacking off by yourself, no this was a completely different level.
Draco opened his eyes to find Harry looking at him. Somehow they had just silently agreed on continuing to share the bed in Harry’s room. It was a big bed, alright? And frankly, Draco knew he barely slept when he was by himself. Having been able to sleep for whole nights when in Harry’s bed, gave him motivation to be selfish enough to blatantly ignore a talk about bed sharing and just tuck himself in without a word.
“Who’s that?” At once Rosie looked slightly reserved as she hid behind Harry, eyeing up the new house guest with suspicious eyes.
The other ingredients had been easy enough to snatch whenever he went to browse the shelfs during potion classes. It was only one more that had to be acquired before he could start brewing it.
“I’d say that makes them pretty good, don’t you think?” Draco knew Potter was being way too chipper with how he talked about the possibly worst quidditch team in existence, but he couldn’t help being egged on by it.
Potter gave him a mischievous wink before flying off to join his team in their victory. Draco sat still for a moment, needing time to take in what had just occurred.
“Oi Malfoy! You better not start imagining Harry is yours now just cus you’re stuck to him. It’s gonna be a major let down the moment he’s free from you and you can’t depend on the saviour protecting you anymore.” Weasley jeered, evidently unaware of the current situation between Potter and Draco.
The whole group had spent the morning after Christmas eating breakfast together and chatting away. It had been a lazy day with no one feeling particularly interested in leaving the comfortable sofa and the warm fire painting the room in an orange glow.
“I’m glad you could come…” Harry said with a voice filled with emotions Draco didn’t fully understand.
Draco carried his broom by his side as he went out of the Slytherin locker room. He enjoyed flying by himself as it was something that felt freeing to him. He was just about to walk past the Gryffindor locked room, when something caught his eyes.
Draco glanced at the handwriting once more before rolling it together and tying it to his mother’s owl that was waiting at the window.
“Then tell me. I don’t want us to stop talking now that everyone gets along with each other.” Potter made no indication of moving his hand or allowing for more space between them.
“Well, it’s a bit weird to say I guess, but sure… I think he’s an attractive man. He’s not the manliest guy though, so I guess he’s more beautiful than handsome really…” Amelia knew that Harry wasn’t aware of how his answer sounded to her, and it frustrated her even more.
“You better not embarrass me, Potter.” Draco gave him a pointed look as a grin spread across Potter’s face, making it hard for Draco to recognize his own features. Potter had always shown a lot of his emotions through facial expressions, which Draco thought didn’t suit his own face that usually tried to hide any emotions from showing.
Despite having, strangely enough, been on friendly terms with Weasley as of lately, Draco had never expected to see Granger again. Just like the other two members of the golden trio, she had gone through a great deal throughout the war. And they had been on opposite sides at the time. So how on earth should Draco talk to her? He had no idea.
“It’s been two weeks since you’ve seen him, right? So how is it? Are you fine with the way things are now?” Amelia knew he wasn’t. But she had to push him a bit to make him start to realise just what he felt for the blonde guy.
“I’m sorry.” Harry looked him in the eyes, obviously going for some sort of puppy-eyes. “Don’t try to act cute, Potter.” Draco scoffed, unable to withstand using his last name. That was certainly a habit he had to get out of.
“Ah… It’s okay. If what it takes is for me to challenge death, I’ll gladly do it if it means I can be with you. No problem whatsoever.” Draco said, a bit surprised at his own irony and how he was even able to speak properly after Harry’s words.
The room fell silent for a moment, the only sound coming from the crackling of the fireplace as it continued its dance of red, yellow and orange.
“If… I’ll go if you come with me.” Draco knew he was being difficult, but honestly, he wasn’t sure he would be able to go through with it unless Harry stood by his side.
“No problem! Although, Harry is better at knowing what you like. I’ll get him for you!” Amelia said and was gone before Draco could muster up any sort of protest.
“Just be charming enough, and that might actually work.” Blaise chuckled, avoiding the glare Draco sent his way.
“Well, even if you don’t know what to give him yet, I guess you know him pretty well by now, so you’ll figure it out. Oh! And don’t worry about the others, we don’t normally give presents, so I think he’s just going to give it to you secretly” Amelia grinned. She was obviously enjoying whatever was going on.
‘Well, Harry has always considered you good-looking’, Draco shook his head slightly as the thought continued to force its way to the front of his mind. Why the hell would Potter think that? When did Potter tell Granger that? Did Granger just lie to him so that he would go and embarrass himself?
Draco rolled the parchment together and tied it neatly before summoning his owl to the window. It was a strange feeling to suddenly be in a dorm so high up compared to the dungeons. At least the owls had easy access here. The owl waited patiently as he tied the letter to its leg before flying off into the crimson sky.
It was nice to just be in the moment and use his skills without having to fear that he might faint from exhaustion or make sure no one else ‘accidentally’ fires a hex his way. Granger was a good duelling partner as her analytical side allowed her to easily spot improvement potentials. Draco knew that she was sharp when it came to stuff like that, so he decided it was only reasonable to take the tips he could get. Granger looked pleased to finally have someone who listened to her advices and gave back just as useful ones.
He came to a halt, not really sure why he didn’t just continue walking. He probably should’ve, but it was too late now.
“You alright?” His train of thought was disrupted as he heard a voice and shifted a bit to look straight into the eyes of one Harry Potter. His wand still in his hand as he furrowed his brows down at him.
The days after the match Potter had been his usual self. He didn’t interact a whole lot with Draco in general and that stayed the same. Sure enough, he had started giving these ridiculous lopsided grins here and there whenever their eyes met, but that was about it. He seemed rather unaffected by what had occurred during the match, unlike Draco.
He was also having a difficult time wording himself whenever Harry would touch him or look him straight in the eyes without looking away.
“Do tell me if you want to stop.” Harry said as he hesitated with one finger lingering at the edge of Draco’s pyjama pants.
Harry turned to see Draco fidgeting. It made him look much younger than he was. He knew Draco was 26, while he himself was 24. Somehow Harry felt like he was older than the guy in front of him.
“He looked rather pale…” Amelia said as she slid up next to Harry. “I told him you just needed time to properly think things through, you know”. She continued, obviously siding the blonde rather than her brother on the matter.
Although he was fairly certain Harry had told Amelia about Draco’s work, he had never felt like Amelia, or Harry for that reason, had been overly interested in his work or changed because of the title he held.
Draco took a deep breath and relaxed. It made it easier for Harry to carefully and slowly nudge his finger inside of Draco.
“It’s alright. You did your best at the time. I’m grateful for that.” Luna let her hand slowly sink down to her side again. “I’m okay, and I don’t blame you for anything.”
Lately whenever he and Draco had been going out together, Draco had spent most of his energy on trying to keep them at a friendly distance.
“What a prat…” Pansy whispered, scowling at Macmillan. Draco just kept his eyes locked on the ingredient he was slicing up in front of him. It wasn’t the first time he got comments thrown after him and he knew better than to retaliate to every single one of them.
The moment suddenly felt too tender, and Draco was having trouble knowing what to say. It somehow felt like Granger was sharing too much intimate information with him, despite them not having talked like this ever before.
“Tch!” Draco felt his words fail him as he came to realise that he had no idea what to do at this point. There was no way he would be able to use the wand still held tightly in his hand against Potter. First off, too much had happened between the two and Draco could feel himself unable to do much more than point the wand at the guy. Even that was straining as he knew how much he owed to Potter. Secondly, he knew Potter had fast reflexes and considering he had already spent a few years as an Auror, there was no telling how good he had become at wandless magic. At this point it was difficult to know if Potter was unable to perform crafty magic without his wand, or if he just simply regarded the situation not dire enough.
Potter also seemed to have become less aware of personal space, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder if that was just his natural behaviour once he warmed up to people. However, he hardly did anything to make Potter aware of it. To him it was more than he could’ve ever asked for. Potter not loathing being around him and even feeling okay with touching him through a playful smack on the arm or jokingly ruffle his hair which had him think about it for days after was a welcoming feeling.
Draco gasped as another finger went in, but the tightness was much less prevalent now. Harry managed to get a steady rhythm going, and Draco felt shudders run through him at every push and pull.
“You’ll make me expect things if you keep talking like that.” Draco huffed, unable to hold his head up any longer and finally resorting to placing it on the side of Potter’s face, turning it slightly so he could use the pillow behind Potter’s head for support.
“Yeah, quite different from last time I was here” Draco said back, trying to sound interested, although he wasn’t a fan of small talk, but the guy had a soothing voice, so maybe it wasn’t too bad. He also should try to get some friends in the area, as his circle of friends at work was fairly limited, and actually having some friends outside of the workplace could be a good change of pace.
Draco closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. It wasn’t the first time he had experienced it, so he knew what was coming. It never came however, as he faintly recognised a voice between the screams of the Death Eaters.
He felt the grip on his head loosened at the same time as Potter looked away for a second before once again regarding him with a restrained composed look in his eyes. “Hermione is the smartest person I know and has the best resources to figure this all out. So yes, I’m calling her.” Potter’s voice was levelled, and Draco felt his jaw clench at the notion that Potter was showing mercy despite it all.
“It does. But midnight blue and night blue are almost identical. If it wasn’t for the fact that I spent 5
Pansy walked over to Draco who was stirring one of the cauldrons in the brewing room. Peering into the cauldron, she sighed dramatically.
“Oh yes, I’m so sorry for my sudden illness and with such a poor timing as well, what with the appointment that was booked.”
“It’s the spell, it gotta be. Whatever put you two together doesn’t seem to like it very much when you are too far away from one another.” Granger looked more than pleased at her own deduction, and it took all of Draco’s willpower not to sneer at the Minister of Magic right in front of the Head Auror.
“Yeah, that’s probably reasonable.” Draco swallowed hard as he spoke. At least he now had a few more days to prepare for living on his own again if Potter chose not to want to pursue anything with him after all. He still probably had to find a place to stay even if Potter wanted something between them. They had been living together for a while now, but it hadn’t been a consensual wish from either of them at the start. And wouldn’t it just be weird to ask to move in with someone before even having been a proper couple first? But where exactly could Draco go? At least he had some time to think about it now.
“Yeah? You had more practice though, so it’s not fair.” Harry chuckled and leaned in, kissing Draco gently. It felt like fire when their lips met, and it ended way too soon.
“Well, I did sleep for most of yesterday and managed to indulge in one too many espresso shots so yeah, I’ve got no understanding of time anymore. I might end up dead on the floor halfway through the day, who knows. Just enjoy my current mood of energy and happiness, alright!”
Once he opened his eyes again, he realised he had been grasping at his arm where the mark was. He withdrew his hand and sighed. The nightmares hadn’t decreased at all. Every night he woke up in a cold sweat screaming or shaking violently.
He shouted out spells himself, trying to redirect some of the curses his way instead of Potter’s. It was difficult to keep up with the unyielding number of curses, and he tried to keep his shield in place, but he felt it starting to crack more and more.
“I know it’s not my place, but I hope you know that you can at least talk to me if you need. I do understand your situation a lot more than you might think. And don’t be afraid of opening up a bit, it doesn’t mean you’re showing weakness.” Draco felt his hand twitch as the words were hitting a bit too close to home for his liking.
Draco sighed. He loved his mother, but it had been difficult to not blame both of his parents for having led him down a path that he could never properly recover from. He knew his mother never wanted it for him, but she hadn’t been able to take Draco and leave his father either before it all went to hell.
Draco shot up in his bed. He was breathing harshly as he felt sweat covering his body, making his hair stick to the back of his neck. He closed his eyes for a moment as he tried to steady his breathing.
“Oh, give it a rest, Ron!” Hermione sighed rolling her eyes. “Look at the bright side, you did some decent gloating yourself last time. I don’t think even Malfoy would be able to compare to that.”
Potter had stopped by a late evening once, looking a bit worried as the lights were still on in the shop. Draco must’ve looked tired there he sat, scribbling down notes on the scattered papers in front of him.
“Yeah, of course. I just… I need more time to figure this out. It’s already so late and…” Draco knew Granger was right and that patience would be needed in order to solve this, but it still felt like a defeat to know he was still far from free of Potter’s close proximity.
“Ah! It’s…” Draco gasped as he clutched the bedsheets. “It’s good!” He managed to get out through heavy breaths.
Draco flew higher up than the rest in order to scout for the small golden ball. In his side eye he saw Potter doing the same. For a long while Draco was searching, while the players below him was scoring goals or hitting bludgers at each other.
Draco could thank his specialised skills for landing him a job in the department that focused on fixing Auror gear and equipment’s as well as creating and testing new versions that could help better secure the Auror’s when they went on dangerous missions. It wasn’t always easy to concentrate on the new development part though, since Auror’s would come in daily with sheepish looks on their faces as they brought forth one damaged equipment after another.
‘If he’s this perfect then he should already have a girlfriend… Or a boyfriend for that matter…’ Draco couldn’t remember them ever discussing relationships and the others hadn’t said anything indicating that Harry was involved with someone either. It seemed rather unusual that if he did in fact have a partner, the person didn’t show up for the Christmas party.
“Do me a favour and think back on the last couple of days.” She looked between the both of them. “Can you remember anyone looking suspicious around either of you, or have you consumed something you weren’t sure of what was? Were you exposed to something, or do you think you might’ve been?”
“I think you’re right.” She said, chuckling. “Magical laws are his go to when he can’t sleep at night.”
Two days had passed since Draco had gone to the bakery. Was he starting to get addicted to it? He thought.
He woke up with a jerk, the memories of the war slowly dissipating as he steadied his breath. He glanced through the curtain over at the bed next to him, finding that the curtains had been drawn shut indicating that Potter must’ve come back after he had fallen asleep.
Somehow, he had started to enjoy watching Potter cook. The man seemed fairly adept at it, and it was fascinating to see how well he handled everything relating to it.
“I had to keep myself from laughing to be honest. I’ve never heard a Malfoy struggle so much with his words before. It was refreshing really. Made me realise just how much you liked him.”
At that Draco moved so quickly he earned himself a headache from the sudden motion. His whole body withdrew and he scooted back as far as possible in the shared bed, looking at Potter with wide eyes.
He looked at his watch, it was not too long before he had to get to work. He groaned as he didn’t want to get out from the warm bed. He was certainly not a morning person.
It was silence around him, he was finally unable to escape the thoughts he had to properly process at some point.
“You think that your decisions during the war was your own and that you choose to do bad, so you don’t think you deserve any redemption.” Draco felt his pulse quicken, Potter was reading him like an open book, and he didn’t like it.
“You want to start hexing or defending?” Potter asked, while pulling his wands from under his cloak.
“I’m a Malfoy after all.” The name didn’t make him nearly as proud as it had used to, but he wouldn’t let him see that. Walking up to Potter, he only lifted an eyebrow before slightly pushing Potter out of the way and walking into the bathroom himself before closing the door with a parting word. “Guests first, Potter.”
Draco sighed. He had no idea where to even start. Yes, he had become really fond of Harry during the months they had known each other, but would it really be okay to just give him something he himself think he’ll like?
The trials were long and took an eternity to get through. It wasn’t surprising as there were a vast number of you-know-who’s followers who had been captured and put up for trial. When it was Draco and his mother’s turn, something rather unexpected had occurred. Before the judges could come to a final conclusion, a last witness was brought forth. The doors had opened and in strode the wonder boy. Draco could do nothing less than stare wide-eyed as Potter started talking. To be fair, Draco hadn’t in his wildest dreams expected Potter of all to jump in and defend both Draco and his mother. The judges all seemed to rely profoundly on Potter’s statement and it only took a short discussion before the judgment was given. Both Draco and his mother were given mercy. No, more than that. They only got a few months of house arrest as well as having their wands confiscated. They had been given replacements that would notify the Auror department the minute either of them performed spells that could imply anything suspicious. It was required to have the wands for at least a year before they could apply for permittance to have their original wands returned to them.
“No…” Draco whispered feeling his chest clench tight. He did not want to share a room with Potter. No way. He’d take the danger of Macmillan over Potter any day.
Potter just laughed loudly. Draco’s looked up his eyes widening for a second before he could manage to cover up his shock at the unexpected reaction. The laugh coming from Potter didn’t hold any animosity or anger. It was just a pure, joyful laugh. Before Draco had a chance to recover and another word could be uttered Potter had left the room.
“It’s… I feel fine now.” Draco said unable to hide his confusion himself. “I only feel a small hint of something uncomfortable in my chest, but nothing compared to what just happened.”
“You’ve got no idea how right you are!” She said in a hushed voice. “During school both Ron and Harry spent 90 percent of the self-study time sleeping or complaining. Both just itching to go outside flying. It was a nightmare.”
Damn him… Draco thought bitterly. He had seen Potter laughing and grinning with his friend’s multiple times during meals in the great hall, but never had it been directed at him before now.
Draco could feel himself start to blush. Harry wasn’t letting go of his hand and had now moved the fork right to Draco’s mouth.
“Er…” Draco started. He wasn’t good with apologising; he never had been. It wasn’t a trait much used by Malfoy’s. However, he had always wanted to talk to Luna, to tell her how sorry he was for what she had to go through. The guilt had been gnawing at him the most when he was sat alone with his thoughts waiting for the trials to decide his fate.
“Well, that definitely takes a twist on the whole conversation about touching, I suppose.” Potter seemed to find it appropriate to try and ease the situation by the use of humour.
“And look at that view! You must love it here” Harry was bouncing back and forth between all the new things he hadn’t seen before.
“I heard you’re going to spend Christmas with us, right?” Draco looked up to find Amelia placing the pumpkin spice latte and croissant on the table.
“I admit that option would’ve been worse. He has shown multiple times to be the type of person who acts before he thinks.” Draco mocked it felt nice to have a chat that felt like old days again.
Draco was brought out of his own thoughts instantly as he realised, he had been going on for far too long, and was now basically just petting Potter’s head repeatedly.
“What?! Seriously? That’s awesome!” Pansy shrieked, grinning from ear to ear, seemingly having forgotten about her own shitty day for the moment. “Can you show me?”
“You know… Going to a mind healer might not be such a bad thing.” Draco turned to look at Harry as he was watching the northern lights Draco had created in the ceiling of his bed one night when he couldn’t sleep. They had fallen into a dreamless sleep after yesterday’s adventure, and Harry was now lazily caressing Draco’s arm as they talked.
Then it hit him. The few times he had tried reading various alternative books on Patronuses long before the fateful meeting with Harry, in order to find some way to try and conjure one, Draco had come across a section in one book that had stuck with him. He wasn’t sure why it had been such a memorable paragraph, but the idea of a Patronus either being the same as a loved one or complimenting it had been both romantic and utterly cliché in Draco’s mind. Yet, here he was, a bloody walking cliché himself. The horror.
“Is it okay to add another one?” Harry asked. Draco nodded; he wasn’t feeling any discomfort at all.
“You look good, considering.” Draco muttered in a low voice. He felt himself relax a bit more as Potter’s condition seemed better than he had expected. Of course, that might’ve had something to do with his incessant need to think the worst in every situation.
At this point Draco had found himself struggling with masking the darkness that had started forming under his eyes. The lack of sleep and appetite had thrown him into some sort of delirious state of mind.
Pansy only laughed wickedly at that, patting him on the shoulder. “You won’t get rid of me that easily. Who will mock you about your crush on the chosen one if I’m not around anymore? We can’t have that.”
There was no particular smell, and he didn’t feel anything acutely different after inhaling it. Perhaps he felt a bit… warmer? However, Draco couldn’t be sure if that was just his own wishful thinking that the potion had worked.
“Then what’s all this?” She pointed at the notes strewn across the table, and the cauldron that was smelling oddly like strawberries instead of treacle tart.
“Yeah, sorry! I’ll see you later.” Draco almost felt Hermione’s own wincing as she probably just said what she usually says to the people that comes into her office. Draco was another case and saying ‘see you later’ was just making things more awkward.
“This is amazing! It even tastes like Christmas” Draco said in awe, it once again showed just how good of a baker Harry was.
He knew that he liked Draco a lot. He was a fun person to be with, he could talk to him about anything and he had never felt so comfortable with having anyone in his house as he did with Draco.
Draco thought, but just as he started seeing hints of a clearing off in the distance, he could no longer feel any presence behind him. He stopped. This was bad. Where had they gone? This was their one chance to get them all. What if not all of them were following him? They would surely know about it if any of the others got apprehended, and then they would hide, and Draco would never know when it would be safe to be alive.
“Hi there.” He felt his hand twitch slightly as he hadn’t heard anyone come in. He looked up to see Granger standing beside him, the look on her face difficult to interpret.
“Yeah, surely. But don’t you guys think it’s weird. He doesn’t even bother us at all, and when we pass by him and his friends, I could’ve sworn he smiles at us and I mean smile not smirking or leering.” Weasley seemed laughably upset about it, and Draco cursed himself for not having thought of this as a way to mess with Weasley back in the days. He apparently goes mental when he thinks Draco is being nice to him.
“Are you ready? We’ll have to leave now if we’re not gonna be late.” Harry said, leaning in the doorway. “Ron is ecstatic, by the way, having passed the transfiguration class that is” Harry grinned.
Pansy… Draco groaned as he rubbed his eyes before standing up and getting ready to close up shop for the day. He would definitely have a talk with Pansy the moment he saw her, but for now he figured he needed a warm bath and a big cup of tea to get rid of the anxious feeling of meeting Harry Potter again.
“Can I start moving?” Draco shivered at the roughness in Harry’s voice, and just nodded in response, not feeling like his voice would hold if he tried to speak.
As Draco followed after him up the stairs, he snickered at the fact that Potter apparently had made it his quest to make sure everyone knew he had once been a Gryffindor. There were red drapes hanging on each side of the windows, and several Gryffindor-inspired ornaments neatly placed around the house.
With a swoosh, the two guys were once again left to themselves. The house feeling deadly silent now.
Both of them just stood there for a moment, no words being spoken before Draco nearly jumped out of his shoes as he heard the alarm for the potion go off.
Draco gave a light chuckle, knowing full well how annoyingly miserable Ron had been for the past weeks now, mumbling on and on about not surviving a re-sit. “I’ll be there in a minute” Draco smiled, as he quickly went back to writing the last of the letter to his mother, while Harry went out to the common room levitating both his and Draco’s bags with him.
The door jingled and Draco had to tear himself away from the packaging station and over to the counter to tend to the customer who had just entered. Pansy was working at Bewitched Dresses that day, so it had been more than a little bit hectic.
“A little over a year. It used to be an old book shop, so people didn’t seem to notice it much. At least I never noticed it during my trips through Diagon Alley.”
Draco lay down, dragging Harry with him. He felt a bit feverish as he took in the sight of Harry easily towering over him. “You’ll tell me at once if you want to stop, right?” Harry’s confidence seemed to have faltered a bit as he realised where they were headed.
He quickly threw a hex Potter’s way without warning him. It had little effect though, as Potter had always been quick with his spell work. Draco threw a few more, realising that the shield Potter had put up was not going to bend to a few minor hexes. That’s what happens when you’ve had a hoard of death-eaters attacking you with unforgivable curses left and right.
“You must’ve hit your head. Why are you even considering this?” Draco knew he was currently just making his chances much lower, but he couldn’t help the scepticism at Potter actually considering him as anything close to a love interest at all.
Sure, he did feel like they had become close throughout the last couple of months, but Harry hadn’t even considered anything turning into love, what with both of them being guys.
Only, it didn’t. Instead, he felt slightly colder skin on his as Potter’s forehead connected with his own. He kept his eyes closed as he didn’t dare open them, knowing Potter’s face was unbelievably close to his.
“Putting all your hope in Potter because of your lack of goalkeeper skills, huh?” Draco jeered back. “Perhaps if you started practicing a bit it wouldn’t all be up to the snitch, now would it?”
“Ready to lose, Malfoy?” Draco rolled his eyes at the already gloating Weasley parading down the halls towards the quidditch locked room.
“I’ll just go to sleep now and then worry about it all tomorrow instead” Blaise said in an exasperated voice as he rose from the couch grumbling and heading to his room.
As he walked over to the living room, he saw that the fireplace was lit up and it cast a warm, golden light throughout the room and with the rain hitting the windows with force, it felt unimaginably great to be inside at this moment. It really was different from what he was used to, Draco noted.
“It doesn’t seem to be that simple. I did try to counteract it before, and it didn’t work. I’ve discussed it a bit with Hannah at St. Mungo’s. I didn’t tell her everything.” Granger said, as Draco looked alarmed at the mention of even more people knowing. “She seems to think we might need to look into some potions to break it.”
There had been quite a few times now where Draco had been put in a position of being flustered and unsure of what he should do. He had tried his best at keeping a normal distance between them and not putting too much pressure on Harry.
Certainly, something must be wrong with that head of his, Draco thought. Perhaps the war had been a greater burden on him than anyone really understood, and now the idiot had gone mad because of it.
Draco liked everything he had seen from Harry so far. Every time he saw a new side of him, he liked that as well.
“But if it ends up with him figuring out that he doesn’t want to date me, I’m gonna be miserable. It was hell trying to get through two weeks of not seeing him. And I’m honestly too aware of him to be able to have the same friendship we had before. I didn’t want to pressure him into anything, so I tried staying away for a while, but then he had just come to a decision on his own” Draco sighed.
“Don’t worry. I’ll help you get started and once you get the hang of it, it’s actually pretty straight forward.”
No one was particularly focusing on him at the moment, as a few students had crowded around Potter as he had entered a second after Draco.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Pansy grinned wickedly as she thrived best when leaving people feeling desperately in need of more information.
“Wow!” Weasley looked amazed as he took in the sight of his arm, fully healed with no red mark or anything left from the burn.
It was a message from Harry ‘Hi! Are you coming to the bakery today? I have a new recipe, but I would like your opinion on it’.
“Watch out!” He heard the warning but felt himself unable to act quickly enough. As he braced himself for the pain coming his way, he was yanked away with so much force that he stumbled to the ground.
They continued on chatting for a while, which Draco found calming, as the place had been packed with a lot of people he didn’t know.
“Bloody Potter.” Draco mumbled, he yelped as he felt an elbow hit his rib. Granger was giving him a warning look, making him realise that he had said it out loud. Luckily enough, Weasley had been busy filling up his plate and hadn’t heard his grumbling.
“And then I saw the spell go towards Harry, but he was already trying to fend off five of them at the time, so I just decided to jump in there and took the hit.”
Jumping up from the couch he ferociously pointed his finger at Potter. “I’m not in love with you!” He yelled, just as a woosh was heard and Granger stood in the living room looking utterly stunned at the both of them.
He always ruined everything, having close friends or even hoping to find love was useless for a guy like him who couldn’t even read the atmosphere at such a crucial moment.
It dawned on him as he hurried over to the mirror on the closet door, hoping to be wrong about his deduction. “This can’t be happening!” He felt horrified as he was met with green eyes and what could only be described as a bird’s nest of black hair sticking out everywhere on his head.
Draco felt the heat return to his cheeks as he looked away from Harry’s gaze, entwining his hand in Harry’s.
Draco fell back onto the bed, pulling Harry with him as he did. “I want it.” Draco could hear his voice being hoarse as he spoke. “Please, let’s do it.”
“You do remember the animosity between us, do you not?” Draco furrowed his brows slightly, as he knew Lovegood had always been difficult to understand.
“Damn it!” Draco said loudly to himself as he paced around the streets. This was way too frustrating and stressful, he thought to himself.
He leaned his head back further, wanting to give more space for Harry to explore. Harry trailed down his chest and stomach, licking and kissing him, sending shivers down his spine with every touch.
It wasn’t normally the first potion he would go for in a case of changing hair colours, but after hearing that nothing had worked and knowing the twins, Draco knew a stronger and more unusual sort of potion would be needed.
Had Potter really been talking about him? To the golden trio? And from the looks of it, it hadn’t been all bad either. Weasley even seemed to have partially accepted it, and even trusted him enough to tell him which room Potter was in. Perhaps Weasley was a lot more accepting than Draco had ever given him credit for. Being on the wrong side and never allowing a chance to see Weasley’s friendly side, had just made Draco believe the guy was a git whom he could never get along with.
The first few times they had met had been fairly awkward to say the least. After the whole war and trials being over, it was strange to stand face to face with his old school rival and the thought of having been on different sides in said war. Draco knew better than to make a scene and was definitely not about to give anyone any reason to doubt his current position as a worker within the ministry. Potter had only nodded shortly and seemed as nonchalant about everything as he always had. Sure, he had grown since their childhood years, and the once scrawny boy had now turned into a young man that filled out his Auror uniform properly and had layers of authority surrounding the air around him. He had grown up, Draco noted. Much more than he himself had. His only victory was the few inches of difference still apparent in their heights.
“I’m not fucking doing anything!” Potter’s voice was still reasonably filled with horror as he too tried to push Draco off.
Draco absentmindedly twirled the small device in his hand as he walked towards the Auror department. It was something he did whenever he felt nervous. The Auror department, although closely linked with his own, still wasn’t a place he liked to venture. There were too many arrogant people in that department, and quite a few who felt resentment towards him. Some did not even want him to work on their equipment as they argued he was someone they couldn’t trust and would probably sabotage their gear if he got the chance.
Both Pansy and Blaise gave each other a look before shrugging and letting the conversation end without further prying.
Oh god… Draco thought to himself as the weather was starting to look more like a serious storm at this point.
“Thank you as always!” Amelia smiled “I can’t believe you have such a refined taste for things like this. If only I was the same” She sighed.
“You’ve been acting weird lately. All sneaky and tense.” Potter said, shifting his position at the bed so that he was facing Draco. “I started paying more attention after I saw you steal ingredients from potion class.” Draco tried to keep his emotions under control and not let Potter see just how shaken he was from the fact that Potter knew about it. This could mean serious trouble.
Harry looked at him, and if Draco hadn’t paid close attention, he could’ve easily mistaken the look in his eyes as pity. Yet, he realised that it was more a look of someone who understood him, who understood what he was going through. “I know how difficult it can be to make that decision, trust me. But I have also experienced how much it can help. Now, although I still have nightmares, it is not close to how it was. I sleep better and the dreams that are peaceful are only increasing.”
“Erm…” Granger looked between Draco and Ron, obviously feeling a bit conflicted with not letting her boyfriend take part in whatever was going on. “Sure.” She said, sending Weasley an apologetic look. Weasley just shrugged and didn’t seem too affected by being left out, he resumed his focus towards the quidditch magazine instead.
“Er… I contacted the shop a few days ago, asking for an appointment for a potion.” Somehow it looked like Potter was uncertain whether or not he had entered the correct shop, probably solely based on Draco’s presence within said shop.
Draco nodded and went over to the same table he had been sitting at the week before. It was quiet in the bakery, the people around him seemed to have had the same intention as most were either reading something or quietly going about their day.
“W-what?!” Draco sputtered. There was no way he could’ve prepared for the way things were progressing, and that was the only thought he could take comfort in as he continued to whirl himself deeper into Granger’s trap.
“You might be right. He does seem a bit lovestruck if you ask me.” Granger raised an eyebrow. “So, forgive me if I’m being a bit straight forward, but... Do you by any chance fancy him?”
“It is. And I intend to hold it. Now I don’t know about you, but if you don’t mind, I’d like for you to stay here until we capture them. I’d feel more at ease and less distracted if I know for certain you are safe.”
Draco was having a hard time keeping up with him. He hadn’t ever been touched like this before, and he was afraid he was feeling it too much. He didn’t know what was normal or how he should behave.
Draco gasped as he felt his erection being freed from his trousers. Harry pulled his trousers and underwear down and easily slipped it off completely, leaving Draco completely naked.
Draco nodded in agreement. It did look really good, and he noticed that he hadn’t seen it before in the bakery when he used to visit. It must be a new addition, he thought to himself.
“Oh I would think! I work with Hermione Granger, she told me all about it when I complained about the nauseousness and headache I was having. She told me a friend of hers had this amazing shop that could be of help. I was a bit hesitant to try it, but Merlin I’m glad I did!” She paused for a second, thoughtfully before continuing. “I had no idea who this ‘friend’ was, but I must say I was a bit surprised to find out it was you. I know we haven’t exactly met before, but being muggle born I know about your name.”
There was a heavy silence following Draco’s statement. Both breathed heavier from the shouting and amount of feelings that were thrown around the room. Pansy looked almost surprised at his sudden honesty, but just as quickly her face turned into that of sympathy.
“Granger, Potter.” Draco felt relieved that he was going up against Granger. It gave him a moment where he didn’t have to change his attitude to match that of Potter’s.
“You seem like you’ve seen a ghost.” Potter chuckled as he closed in on him and Draco realised, he was not, in fact, a ghost. No, Potter looked very much alive, the slight redness in his cheeks from the cold air outside being proof of there being a living human in front of him. Just eerily different with his white hair.
Finally, his heart could rest easy, because now love wasn’t a distant, meaningless word that he could never come to understand.
“I guess that doesn’t sound so bad” Draco said back. He knew he would regret it if he didn’t accept the offer given to him. Although he was experienced in spending Christmas alone, it wasn’t really something he himself wished for.
“By the way…” Draco said turning to the guy once more “the cake you gave me… It was pretty amazing. It’s gotta be one of the best cakes I’ve tasted”.
How odd wasn’t it to be sitting here with Potter, a Weasley and Lovegood and not be feeling completely out of sorts. Somehow Ginny was far less presumptuous than Draco had previously thought of her and was wholeheartedly taking his side when he mentioned the earlier debate him and Potter had about Quidditch teams.
“I can image” Harry chuckled. “How are you spending Christmas by the way? You’re going to spend it with your family?”.
Draco snorted and they both silently took comfort in knowing each had to carry the weight of being the brains in their relationships.
“Why would you even care? It’s not like I’m your responsibility!” The words came out colder than Draco had meant to, but he couldn’t help it. He felt vulnerable now that he suddenly knew his mother had talked to Potter without him knowing about it. What had she said to him? Had she tried to appeal to him by giving away everything that had happened? It wouldn’t be unlikely considering his mother would most likely weight the pros and cons of the situation in order to make sure her son was safe.
Two and a half week had gone by with only one visit from Hermione where she told them she got caught up in a big case at work and would have to postpone working on the potion for a little while.
“Good, good.” Shrew said as he examined Draco’s work as well. Draco didn’t care to feel offended at the lack of interest from his professor. He had felt the look of displeasure from the first lecture when his name was mentioned. It wasn’t something he could run from.
He had ruined it… Everything… The friendship he had built with Harry over the last couple of months, the friends he had got through Harry and the moments of shared happiness was all gone. Just because of him, not being able to keep his feelings out it all.
“That’s good.” Relief went through Draco as he could see Potter visibly relax more as the pain was easing away.
Potter had the audacity to just laugh. He took the pictures from Draco’s hand and looked at them for a moment before putting them down on the desk again.
It felt like time completely stopped for a second as the last pulses of Harry’s hand around his cock and the messy thrusting made them go over the edge. Draco cried out as he felt himself spill his load heavily. He felt Harry shudder as he came inside of him, the combined feeling was insane.
“Are you blind?” Draco harshly sneered, feeling the adrenaline pump through him, making him sound more defensive that he had intended.
I would’ve told them it wasn’t you!” Draco felt himself lose control as tears started trickling down his cheeks, he hid his face in his hands.
“Oh really? I’ve already managed to have Potter recommend the shop to even you, despite knowing our history, so how sure are you that he will take your side? He clearly likes the shop, and I’m willing to bet it’s not
“I don’t think it’s weird at all. It’s more like it fits you well” The guy smiled as he took a bite of the pie.
“Nothing is going on between us!” Draco was not about to let the girls of the hook just as easily as Potter.
“Practice of course!” Potter grinned again, and Draco spent a solid minute just openly staring at that damned perfect smile in front of him before realising he would have to answer sooner or later.
“When I first started realising that you might be involved with some of those groups of people, I decided to look into the reasons why.” Potter stated as a matter of fact.
As they got into the double sized bed in Harry’s room, Draco was afraid he wouldn’t be able to sleep at all that night. Hopefully the amount of eggnog would help him though.
“Oh, she does. But she can’t stop worrying, nonetheless. She’s always lecturing Harry and I on safety precautions whenever she gets the chance.”
“Hello…” Draco walked over, feeling a bit awkward for not having talked to Amelia since she told him to let Harry consider his offer a bit more.
“Yeah, it’s not too much going on here, but the weather is definitely one of the things the locals have a lot of knowledge on. Especially when the storms hit” The guy said before continuing “Do you want to come in for a bit? The storm is getting pretty out of hand, and I would become worried if I just sent you on your way like this”.
Just then Draco caught a glimpse of something golden passing by on the other side of the field. He launched himself forward, flying off to catch it. Harry was close on his heels as they both neared the golden snitch.
“I love you” He whispered in Draco’s ear. He could hear the small gasp and shiver running through Draco’s body at the words, and he smiled a bit to himself.
“Yeah, we need the win in order to have a chance at the end of the year. I was sick when we played Hufflepuff, so they managed to win that round.” Draco sighed, keeping his senses on high alert for the little golden ball.
Draco felt himself turn around as he cocked his head to the side slightly. “Oh? I suppose that’s true for someone who only relies on his broom to do the work.”
Draco looked around the room for a second before heading towards the office desk situated at the far end of the room. Although Potter had visited his office on multiple occasions, Draco had never been in Potter’s office before, mostly because there had never been a reason to. This morning he had received a note asking if he could bring him the device when he had time to do so, as Potter was busy working hard on a case.
So that’s what Pansy had been talking about when she had urged him to go on some get-together. Certainly not something he would be meddling in.
“I…” Draco hesitated for a moment, also a bit put out by his own words. “I know, Pans. I just… There’s no way he could ever like me, and I just don’t know what to do if I were to hear that from him.”
“Fuck” Harry huffed as he had picked up his pace, sliding back and forth. His cock was sliding against Draco’s and Draco could feel his own cock reacting to the friction. It wasn’t long until he was hard again.
“Do you feel comfortable trying it?” Potter asked, and Draco had to pull himself together in order to answer anything sensible.
“Well, most of them are cold-blooded killers who see nothing but the dark lord. And they seem to only go after ‘traitors’ at this point, so it’s not overly concerning though, is it?” Draco felt himself sound much more nonchalant than he truly felt. He just couldn’t help the guilt that started to tighten at his chest. He wasn’t really a man worth saving to begin with, that much he knew. He had, after all, made terrible decisions that had aided the Death Eaters in their quest.
“Everyone has changed, Ron.” Granger was still trying to keep herself composed as she pretended not to be overly interested in the conversation.
With a frown he looked up and when his eyes met Potter’s he realised he didn’t seem to be in any pain himself either.
Potter looked up from the current document he was working on and chuckled lightly, the flames from the fireplace reflecting his glasses and making it difficult to properly see his eyes. “Miracles do happen after all, it seems.”
“It’s fine, I get you… I’m not better myself.” It seemed like the reply had appeased the doubt in Weasley’s mind. It was amazing how Weasley was able to make decent deductions on his own, which showed he definitely had potential to be an Auror. Yet, the easy dismissal of said deductions once someone told him differently was just as impressive, Draco snickered, before realising something. Weasley probably only dismissed things once it was Granger or Potter who talked him out of it. It wasn’t because he never kept to his own decisions, it was just that he trusted his friends more than anything else.
“It’s been a while, Granger. Or should I say, Minister of Magic.” The well-mannered, calm response, despite the current situation, sounded ridiculous. However, it was all Draco could do, as the option to run away or look any sort of decent was frankly impossible at the moment.
He heard a faint “Come in.” As he knocked on the door to the Head Auror’s office. Not surprisingly, Potter seemed just as busy as he was standing by one of the smaller tables, looking through heaps of papers.
“That’s all the components I’ll be needing for the antidote then?” The witch said as she, with a hint of uncertainty, looked over the various ingredients, clearly unfamiliar with the potion.
“I’m so sorry mate… This must be awfully difficult for you.” Ron said, giving Harry a sympathetic look.
Oh no… Draco didn’t think he had said it out loud. He had only meant to think it, and now he had just spilled some pretty serious stuff onto Harry without meaning to.
Draco wondered if he had just imagined it all. The lady was out the door before he could gather himself, and he let out a breath he wasn’t aware he had been holding.
“Amelia and Sebastian are taking the sofa” Harry said as he pulled the handle on the edge revealing a sofa bed.
What felt like an eternity passed with both of them looking into each other’s eyes. One a hateful glare, and the other a wide-eyed shock. Draco could feel his heartbeat racing in his chest, thumping so loudly through the utter silence. He hated the fact that Potter could definitely feel his heart going rampant, making him unable to brush off the situation as not being intimidating.
It was all too common for Draco to have people look at him differently the moment he told them about his job and status. Everyone seemed to cling on a bit too much once they knew and then they all tried to use the friendship for their own gains. Growing up with this kind of thing happening on a regular basis had made him wary when it came to friendships or relationships.
Draco just stared at him for a moment. It felt like he would be giving in too much if he did as he said, but the closeness that would come from calling Potter by his first name was thrilling. “You’re an idiot… Harry.” Draco felt a slight shudder run through him as he looked away from the green eyes twinkling at him.
“Yeah, I’ll just ask the Auror who probably has the most to do out of all of them to come work part time in a tiny potion shop. Brilliant.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Luna’s a strong person. She’s not someone who breaks easily.” Potter yawned; Draco could hear that he was close to falling asleep. The yawn was infectious and became a reminder of Draco’s own sleepiness.
Draco felt a lump in his throat at the uncomfortable realisation that his last thought before apparating had been about wanting to be saved. To go somewhere, for once in his life, where he could feel utterly and completely safe.
“Also, your potions are far better than the other’s I’ve tried. So that’s also a bonus for me to be honest.” Potter smiled, pulling out the right amount and allowing no further discussion on the topic.
“What’s going on?” Granger looked between them with worry and confusion at the sudden change in their behaviour.
Draco said his goodbyes and headed outside. The rain was still pouring down, and after gripping tightly on to the umbrella handle, Draco headed home.
“Oh, then thank you” Draco said back. “You want a refill?” The guy pointed at the coffee, and Draco nodded and said his thanks as the guy placed a hot cup of coffee on the table, before going over to serve one of the other customers.
He couldn’t remember exactly when his trousers had been discarded, but he was now lying there completely naked as he felt himself beg. “Please…”
“You… It’s not… You don’t have to do that just to save a friendship... I wouldn’t want that” Draco said, stumbling over his words at the unexpected conversation.
Potter chuckled although the tone held a weariness which indicated that the title was far from easy to carry around all the time.
Weasley was mumbling to himself for a while longer before making a move and then instantly regretting it.
“I did try at first, but you were completely out. I figured I should just let you sleep then. Merlin knows you probably needed it.”
“What did you say? I couldn’t hear you; the sounds are too loud!” Harry said in a raised voice, trying to get through the loudness.
“She must’ve set me up. I haven’t been able to think about anything else since I talked with her.” Draco snorted.
“Get down!” Potter shouted at him, but before Draco could comply, he was thrown backwards and onto the hard stones beneath him. He felt the sharp pain from the Everte Statum spell hitting him right in his chest.
Potter sounded apologetic as he hesitantly walked into the room and sat down on the couch beside Draco. It felt like such a relief as the pain ebbed away and Draco felt like he could finally breath properly, however he kept his gaze firmly directed at the flames dancing in the fireplace before them. “The pain was getting pretty out of hand, despite the potion.”
“Okay? Is everything alright between you two?” The worried look on Granger’s face was unnatural as it had rarely ever been directed at him before.
Pansy was the only one who knew about Draco’s dreadfully long crush on his arch nemesis. In a moment of weakness and with the help of several glasses containing alcohol combined with Pansy’s constant nagging about him liking someone, Draco had blurted it out. She had taken the news with significantly more grace than Draco had expected of her and only spent twenty minutes laughing her ass off, saying she had always known there had to be more to his obsession over the boy other than the supposed rivalry. Draco had made her promise to keep it a secret, but it didn’t keep her from berating him, especially whenever he went out of his way to avoid any possible contact with Potter.
It felt utterly too good to be true to be laying here on top of Harry Potter who had just agreed to try to make something out of whatever they had going on.
However, luck was not on Draco’s side as he slumped back down into Potter’s lap the moment he tried to get up. He first looked at Potter in disbelief thinking he had been the one dragging him back down again. Potter just arched an eyebrow and looked down between them. That’s when Draco realised his ministry badge had somehow entangled itself with Potter’s own Auror badge. He was therefore, unfortunately, stuck in Potter’s lap for the time being.
“Although I suppose it wouldn’t be strange to think that I have some intel on it.” Why he was stirring up trouble when he had nothing backing it up, was difficult to say.
“No, you prat! It’s me Malfoy!” Potter frowned, obviously not believing him. “Riiiiight….” He sighed as he lay back down again and turned away from Draco.
The next week Pansy was called in for emergency work at Bewitched Dresses, which meant Draco was alone when he heard the bell jingle and saw Potter appear through the doorway.
“I’m with Longbottom. He still seems to hold a grudge against most people from Slytherin, so I’m not sure if any friendship is gonna bloom there, but at least he’s not someone who would easily harm anyone else.” Blaise said dryly.
“I didn’t know you were so invested in the quidditch world these days.” Potter looked genuinely interested as he bit into his eggs on toast.
Amelia looked at him as he was arranging some of the pastries. He’s not even aware of what he’s actually saying, is he? She thought.
“When we get back to ourselves, I’ll help you get better at potions, cus that work of yours is truly devastating.”
Draco had been right regarding both Hermione and Ron, they were both lively people who Draco felt was easy to get along with. Hermione was incredible smart and talking to her was a lot of fun since she shared many of the same interests with Draco.
“But there’s no way I would’ve taken the wrong-“ Draco stopped as he remembered the event that had happened when he tried to obtain the last ingredient. “Damn it.”
If anything, Potter’s changed behaviour had been a consistent pain in the arse in Draco’s opinion. The guy never seemed to take offense anymore to whatever Draco did. Sure enough, Draco had toned down his torment by quite a lot, as there was no room for that anymore. Not after the war.
“I thought not. How about we talk like civilized adults instead?” Potter said as he started to rise up.
When Draco started getting used to the finger and the burning subsided, another one entered. It was easier for the second finger to slide into him and there was no burning sensation to it. A while longer and Draco had three fingers inside of him, scissoring him slowly. He felt himself relax into the touch as it started feeling good.
However, it wasn’t that easy when he now constantly had Potter within arm’s reach and the scrawny boy had grown into something actually resembling a fine man.
“Well, he’s always been known for getting into trouble and St. Mungo’s must be a place he frequents. So no, I’m not at all worried.” Draco said, the knot in his stomach telling a different story.
Before any more conversation could be held Draco hurried back to his desk. He didn’t want to take the chance of generating more suspicion towards himself.
“Yes.” It felt tight as Harry pushed further in. Draco clenched the sheets as he took a deep breath. As Harry pulled out and slowly pushed back in, and Draco focused on taking deep breaths, he felt the tightness slowly ease up a bit with the continuous motion.
He made his way to the back of the store, motioning for Potter to follow him. “What potion is it you need brewed?”
