“Typical Ron,” Ginny tsks, “only caring about boring Auror stuff.”
“Is that—” asks Dean.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Luna says coyly, “I merely told him about the 3rd dingleberry infestation of Northern Wales.” Luna sways as she talks, her long hair swishing perilously close to her glass of purple liquid.
“You’ve been coming to the Burrow for how long now?” Ginny says flatly.
Sensing a vulnerable moment, Ron sprints forward and bursts through the door, ready to hurl stunners at whoever is behind it.
“Literally anywhere else.”
“Hello Draco,” she says, noticing Draco’s precarious position on the stairs, “Are you heading to Ron’s room now? I saw Harry with Hermione on the porch. Shall I fetch him?”
(See the end of the chapter for
fuck!?”
She flips her long red hair over her shoulder and gives Draco a baleful look.
“Toilet?” Draco says innocently.
Dean kicks the ball. For a muggle sport, Seamus really ain’t bad.
I have more to the story planned, so stay tuned. See you again soon! 886 :)
“Like on your couch? Or how about the kitchen—”
“No, no, stop.” Ron scrunches his eyes shut, willing away those unnecessary mental images. “You can have your bed back.”
“Well, you stole ours,” Draco answers, voice dry, “Where else were we supposed to shag?”
“Not much.”
“Did he get it?”
“I’m in,” Ginny says with far too much enthusiasm.
“Okay,” shrugs Dean.
The piercing sound of breaking glass makes both Ron and Hermione jump.
So when Seb contacted him one day right after a practically hard shift (one of his patients was not only in the room Blaise had been in days earlier, but he was both gay and blond) and asked to go out for tea, he had taken the offer gladly. He arranged for them to meet in a more modern wizarding tea shop, so he would not be at all reminded of Smith and Waltons. Through all of this he was aware that he was acting as if he was going through a break-up, and he supposed in a way it felt like one.
“Yes, mam,” he said, still trying desperately to match Healer Patrick’s strides.
“So?” Harry asked anxiously. Draco had arrived in the living room of Grimmauld place moments ago holding an empty grocery bag.
Harry nodded, feeling disappointed he had decided to opt out of playing to make the teams even.
“Harry Potter?” slurred a voice from his side. He tore his eyes away from Malfoy to address Pansy Parkinson, short black hair framing her face in a stylish bob and deep brown eyes wide.
Harry sat in the canteen, trying to enjoy the moment of peace before he started another round of practice demonstrations. On demonstration days, Brayan had each trainee attempt a task in front of all the trainees for the duration of the day. As a result, the day had been monotonous and tiring, and all Harry wanted to do was go home and starfish on his bed. Harry took another bite of his ham and cheese sandwich and let out a long sigh. His brain began to drift to the night before, when he came home as the sun began to set to find Ginny sitting in their living room, reading a book to James, Al and Lily. Harry had been expecting another long conversation and desperate apology from himself after the kids went to bed, but Ginny barely spoke to him. She briefly asked him if everything had gone well at the hospital, to which Harry said yes. He almost threw in a fake story about his supposed time at the hospital, but decided that was a step too far. Now he had no idea where he and Ginny stood and whether or not they planned on talking, like really talking, anytime soon.
“She did, but I can’t argue,” Ron said, “I have never pulled off red hair well.”
“You know I don’t think that,” Harry said softly, “What you are doing now is far more important than anything I’ve done in a while.”
“At least I know now I’m on my own if I’m ever in real trouble,” Malfoy gave a soft smirk as he watched his friend leave. He then looked at Harry, the amused expression growing, “Is this drunk Potter or useful information Potter because I’m not quite sure how I should be taking your sudden reappearance.”
“Oi!” Harry shouted to his kids, “Al, give the scarf back right now or I’ll take the kite away!”
“Gratefully,” Ida said glibly, “When are you going to fuck Seb then?”
“You like him! And this…” he gestured toward himself and Harry, “Was some sort of messed up ploy to make him jealous?”
Harry reached over to ruffle his hair. He was relieved James would still let him do this, he had been anticipating the day James ducked away and gave him an embarrassed look for a long time.
“What?” Seamus said innocently, “It’s what happened. These two pulled the same stunt.”
“Hey!” Harry scolded, “Don’t talk to your mom like that!”
“Why are you here?” she asked, not exactly harshly.
“What is it, Harry?” she asked, her eyes wide with concern, “You can tell me anything. I will always be your person to tell big and confusing things to,” she gave a half smile at this and waited for Harry to respond.
“It seems you’re already focused,” Harry joked softly, noting the softening of Draco’s eyes as Harry spoke.
James looked at him in confusion, “What evidence? You aren’t an Auror anymore.”
“Who could it be?” Seamus wondered, as he looked around the room, “Everyone’s here.”
“A good one?” Malfoy asked,  a small smile forming on his face.
“The case I was given wasn’t a typical article. I had to convince my boss the importance of it, although I’m sure he still believes what I’m investigating is all rumors,” Malfoy paused, as a brief anger passed over his face, “He doesn’t realize the dangers that could be involved if no one acts. Not even the Aurors are taking it seriously, not with the recent attacks to focus on. This is the reason I started working as a reporter. I want to make an actual difference in people’s lives through the power of printed words. But I’ve had too little results for too long. The Prophet has told me to stop working on the important case and has resorted to only giving me fluff pieces, like the one about your career change and the history of the wolfsbane article I started yesterday at St. Mungos. That’s the reason I was so irritable during the interview. It was unprofessional on my part, but I was at my breaking point with the rubbish the Prophet was leaving me with.”
“With who?” Seamus exclaimed, “I’m really trying to be a good person to talk to here, but I feel like I’m missing a few crucial components to this story!”
“Yes,” Harry answered, “It was the childhood home of Sirius Black, so as the only remaining Black who had lived here, he knew the location of the house.”
“Regardless, there’s a good chance he’s involved!” Harry exclaimed, “It all adds up!”
Harry’s brain began to spin, “For how long?” he whispered. He barely recognized his own voice, rough and detached from his body.
With that, she pulled the door shut behind her as she walked back to the canteen. Harry couldn’t help himself; as soon as the door was closed, he began to laugh. It was a jarring sound he barely recognized as his own. Draco gave him an alarmed look, but then slowly began to laugh along with Harry, his eyes still a mix of sadness and anger that Harry wanted desperately to erase.
Sure enough, a woman had appeared in the doorway. She had short black hair that fell into easy waves around her round, pleasant face. Her sea green healer robes matched perfectly with her turquoise eyes. She was stunning in an easy way, a complete contrast to Malfoy’s pristine nature.
“Compliments. Saying what I mean. Feelings,” Draco answered bluntly, “I’ve never been good at any of it.”
“Gani!” Aviary insisted, grabbing onto his arm, “The best healers in Mungos are helping him! If anyone could revive Hector, it’s them. I just want you to hold out hope.”
“What does Harry think?” Aviary asked, turning to him expectantly.
“Well, anyway,” Seamus interrupted, as Padma looked like she was about to come back with a retort for what Parvati claimed, “My gossip is about Blaise, and it’s good. Apparently, Terry Boot believes Malfoy and Blaise shagged while they were still at Hogwarts!”
“Okay?...” Draco looked at him quizzically, “Is something the matter?”
Harry laughed sharply, “I’m glad to know you think Draco is more dangerous than nine years of Auror work.”
Draco and Aviary followed Harry down the stairs to the large living room right off of the kitchen. The room, like everywhere else in the house, was covered in a nice coating of dust. Despite the multiple renovations they had done in the house, this room still had peeling walls and floors as well as furniture that hadn’t been considered in style since long before they were born. It was hauntingly like being back in Malfoy manor all those years ago. Harry could tell Draco was majorly uncomfortable with being in this room.
The two sat in silence for a while. Harry turned over what Ginny had said in his mind. The rage was ebbing away. He didn’t want to hate Ginny, not for this mistake. He wasn’t ready to drop the fact that she had cheated on him. Yet he didn’t want to yell anymore.
“Got it,” Harry sat up and moved to the door, giving Ginny a kiss on the cheek before she apparated to the quidditch pitch.
Harry looked sheepishly down at the floor, mind racing as he tried to think of what to say. He couldn’t tell her about Malfoy, about the investigation. In fact, while he abhorred lying straight to her face, he didn’t fancy the idea of her knowing about the investigation at all. It was more than she thinking it was dangerous; Harry knew the investigation belonged to him and Malfoy and their weird new friendship.
Confused about the direction Ginny took with her retort, Harry flushed slightly and said, “Let’s apparate, then?”
The door opened behind them and Aviary appeared.
He looked back over to Ginny, but she had bent over her own pile of vegetables, evidently not interested in addressing Harry.
Harry woke up and slowly opened his eyes. He could tell by the light streaming in through the window he needed to get up. He ran his hand along his side table until he found his glasses and placed them over his eyes. Harry blinked slowly as he adjusted to the room around him, half alight in the morning glow of the sun. He instinctively rolled over on his side to greet Ginny, hopefully to ease some of the memories that were quickly resurfacing form last night by talking to her before she had to leave for work. To his dismay but not necessarily surprise, Ginny’s side of the bed was empty and her pajamas were tossed carelessly on top of her pillow, suggesting she had gotten dressed and left the room. The absence of Ginny when he woke up was becoming a regular occurrence. When they first moved in together, both Ginny and Harry made it a habit to wait in bed for the other person to wake up. Ginny had started the tradition; she had once told Harry “nothing was better to wake up to than the person you love.” Harry had grown to love the tradition. It was reassuring to wake up with Ginny’s face peering at him or vice versa. Even on days when one of them needed to wake up early, the other was up with them. If he and Ginny were still following this unspoken rule, Ginny would have woken Harry up around 7:00 when she started getting ready for today’s practice. Harry slept like a rock; any alarm he had set in the past ten years of marriage didn’t come close to waking him, and he had tried everything (I mean, he had magic at his disposal. His unsuccessful attempts at an effective alarm weren’t without merit). But the fact that Ginny hadn’t woken up next to him in well over a week’s time made Harry feel unsettled. He knew she had her team and the kids to attend to, but Harry wanted to be a part of those things desperately. He had never wanted Ginny to feel as though the kids were anything but a joint responsibility. He knew Ginny knew this. Harry had been at her side for early morning chaos for longer than he could remember. However, lately, it was if Ginny took no qualms in handling it all by herself. She wanted to wake up by herself, take care of the kids by herself. It made Harry feel lost as a husband and as a father. He wanted to be there for Ginny and to feel she wanted him to be there for her. And more than anything, he wanted, no needed, their once crucial early morning talks. Harry felt like his brain was exploding with the instability of the past weekend, and Ginny was the one he usually talked to when he felt this way.
As Padma reached her office door, she gave it a sharp kick with her foot. The door swung open a second later, and Harry could see Ron bent over his desk, wand pointed absentmindedly at the door. Harry was once again amazed at how well the two worked together. He and Ida had been a good team, but they were never as in sync as Ron and Padma.
Harry rushed over to the fireplace. Before making a call, he cast silencing charms around the room. The last thing he needed was Ginny or any of his kids overhearing his suspicions.
Ron was at his side straightaway, steadying him on the floor.
Harry reached into his back pocket and pulled out the phone, knowing full well most of the people that would call were already at the Burrow. A small bout of panic sprang up in his chest as he spotted the name ‘Draco Malfoy’ flashing across the small screen.
“Rachel,” Harry hesitated. He felt bad telling this girl, who was looking at him with a passion that reminded him of himself at her age, that she couldn’t stay and fight because she was Brayan’s assistant, not an actual Auror. He wasn’t either, so it felt rather pointless to stay.
Angelina turned to Harry and rolled her eyes, “I’m not sure how I feel about this game, Harry. It has seemed to turn my kids against each other.”
The room broke into chaos at this statement. Rose, Al and Ron all turned to Harry in shock and rage.
“No time for any of this,” Harry grabbed on to one of both Draco’s and Aviary’s arms, “I’ll see you both later,” he said to Ron and Ginny as the three of them were engulfed in the familiar uncomfortable darkness of apparation.
“She’s miserable, but she is one of the strongest people I have ever met, so she is holding it together enough to help out in any way she can,” Harry told her.
“Go Angelina!” Harry yelled weakly, smiling beside himself as Lily repeated his shout.
“Well…” Ron began.
“Go cannons!” Brayan exclaimed as he clapped Harry on the back and then left to go back to his seat.
“So, I don’t know if I’m supposed to ask,” Seb asked cautiously, “But I heard from my friend, who’s a healer at Mungos, that you and Ginny…”
“They’re very smart. They know a good thing when they see it,” Harry said.
“Ron?” Harry asked, “What is it?”
“What things?” Harry asked, his pulse increasing unnervingly, as if it was jumping through his skin like electricity.
Laughing, Harry dives into a conversation with Hermione about how the French minister’s owl tripped on the windowsill while taking a letter to Hermione. Soon the whole group began listening as Hermione described how she had to bring in her assistant to deal with the owl’s broken leg while Hermione dealt with more owls and floo calls. The conversation soon shifted to how Aviary is liking working at the Ministry.
Draco, Harry thought, Draco makes me happy.
He looked at Malfoy expectantly and anxiously, waiting for him to reveal what could be good or bad news about their investigation. Malfoy, however, looked a little confused as he pulled his jacket a little tighter against the cold early winter day.
“Thank you,” Harry said, “You did a much better job telling them than I would have.”
“Who is it? A muggle?” Arthur said eagerly.
“Everyone shut up!” Hermione snapped, “They’re coming this way!”
“I would have been here sooner,” she said frantically, “But no one notified the team. Ron only called minutes ago!”
Patrick handed him the cure, “Here is the cure for today, Seb. Drink it all.”
“Ginny!” Harry called into the house as soon as he appeared in the living area, “Ginny!” he called again, when no one answered.
“You know I’m not partial to either side,” Bill said diplomatically.
“Don’t be upset with him, Harry,” Molly added, “It was a very caring action. I am glad both you and Ginny have found someone who makes you so happy and cares about you so.”
“Really?” Harry said, thinking immediately of Malfoy spending hours pouring over a binder that said otherwise.
The group walked for about fifteen minutes until they reached the park, a large green field in the center of the neighborhood equipped with a play set, swing set and football field. Lily took off towards the play structure immediately, the slide being her favorite. James gave his Dad a desperate look that told Harry he would rather go and fly the kite with Al and Rose than go on the play structure with Lily, so Harry took after his daughter. However, she only made it up the stairs and down the slide one time when she shrieked with delight. A young boy standing near her started at the sound and began to cry, causing his mom to send Harry a disapproving look. Harry was about to defend his daughter when she took off again towards Al, James and Rose, who were now flying kite Darren in all his winged glory. Harry followed Lily over to the group now surrounding Al, Rose and James, one eye on his daughter and his other on the kite. If he had thought the kite looked cool immobilized, he was hardly prepared for how amazing it looked in flight. It’s giant wings soared in the air, glistening in the late autumn sun. Months of kite flying had paid off; the kite was gliding effortlessly over the large crowd of bystanders. As Harry reached the circle, he scooped up Lily and put her on his shoulders so she could get a better look. They continued to watch as Al, Rose and James alternated turns with the owl and tried to outdo each other by getting the kite to do all sorts of flips and tricks. Eventually, the crowd thinned out as afternoon turned into evening. Harry and his kids showed no signs of going home. James was now helping Lily fly the kite towards where Al, Rose and Harry stood. Their once large crowd only consisted of two young girls, who Harry thought were there more for Al and James than the kite. James and Al, thankfully, seemed oblivious to this and were focused solely on the kite. All of a sudden, Harry heard an excited but unmistakable polite voice from behind him ask “Is that a northwestern tawney?”
Harry felt himself shaking violently. Draco was going to die. He had come so close today, it was only a matter of time.
“Draco did?!” she asked, clearly surprised, “How? What does he have to do with any of this?”
“Where is she?” Ron demands, “Is she okay?”
James looked as though he was about to protest, but one glance at the look on Molly’s face sent him into the other room with Lily and Albus in tow.
Harry smiled as he watched the Twister game begin and tried to ignore the disappointment he felt at leaving his kids for far less fun ventures.
“Draco?” Harry said softly, picking up a paper that seemed to be almost entirely in a foreign language, “Have you slept in the past three weeks?”
“Exactly!” Harry exclaimed, “That’s why you need us! Voldemort wasn’t fought by just Aurors, now was he!”
“Of course, you prat,” Harry muttered, not daring to look at Draco, “I’m not a monster.”
Reimmins shook his head, “It’s too dangerous. The Ministry is on a complete lockdown from visitors today. This is the only entrance that will admit the few visitors are still allowed.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, wincing when the words came out more accusatory than he had planned, “Sorry, I mean I’m happy to see you. I just didn’t expect you to be back working so soon.”
But something was nagging him. The fact that being Draco’s friend and Ginny’s… whatever was the perfect cover-up. That solved any suspicion with the Aurors and the reporters. The more Harry thought about it, the more it made sense despite his desperate longing for it not to be true. Ginny and Draco would never forgive him, and although he and Draco were not on good terms, he couldn’t stand never having Draco’s trust again. Yet Blaise was at the hospital the day of the attack when Harry had never seen him there before. Was it a coincidence that the only time the Department of Games and Sports and the quidditch teams held a match was the day of a deadly attack on the hospital? And he was in charge of the quidditch tournament! It was all too obvious to dispute. Harry got up and began pacing. Blaise was in charge of everything at the quidditch match, from seating to preparation to food. While he knew that Blaise may not have been able to prevent his vendors from being Imperius-ed, it would have made it much easier for Kareach to control the vendors, or even be the vendors, if Blaise was involved. Harry felt sick to his stomach. He needed to talk to the Aurors. Fast. If Blaise was the real deal, he needed to be investigated as soon as possible. His new temporary job as head of security could be disastrous for the entire wizarding population of England.
Harry was sitting in the canteen eating lunch during his break, an eerie feeling washing over him as he looked at the unusually empty canteen. It had been like this for the past week, ever since the attack. The high death toll wasn’t the only thing lowering the numbers of Healers and trainees. Many, like Dean, were still recovering from ingesting the poison themselves. Miraculously, only three muggleborns who had eaten something laced with poison had died. Most of the deaths came from the slew of killing curses that had been flying around the canteen. That meant seventeen deaths, of wizards and witches of both pure and half bloods, had been because of the recklessness of attempts to kill Draco. Harry couldn’t imagine how Draco was feeling about this. He already held onto so much guilt from his inability to figure out how to stop Kareach. Harry was certain he was spending everyday beating himself up for allowing so many innocent people to die on his watch. Harry had considered calling Draco multiple times, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He had fucked up their friendship by making it all about the chemistry between them that he was most liking inventing in his head. At some point, he would have to talk to Draco again. Harry wasn’t going to leave the investigation. But he felt like he owed it to Ginny to talk to her before he spent more time with Draco. This was proving impossible, and with Christmas right around the corner, Harry couldn’t bring himself to mess up the holidays with his terrible news. As of right now, his plan was to wait until after Christmas to tell her. He’d figure out what to do about Draco after that.
“You listen to muggle music?” Harry asked Malfoy’s head.
“‘Oi’?” Harry asked, “When did you become so British?”
Harry gripped Ida’s hand as she finished talking. He remembered clearly the day Ida had first told him all of this when they had just become partners. Her determination and resilience is what drew him to her and assured him that she would make a fantastic partner. Now, looking over at Aviary, whose eyes were shining softly with tears and admiration, Harry knew Ida would be a source of inspiration for someone else.
Without hesitation, Harry answered, “Of course. I trust almost all of the Aurors completely. I worked with Padma for years. She is a good person who works harder than any other Auror I’ve met. Not only can we trust her, I think she’d also be an essential resource. She’s brilliant and always notices things no one else does. Ron, on the other hand, is able to put together big picture things much better. That’s why they make the perfect team. They would be perfect to work with us.”
When neither of her parents answered, Rose narrowed her eyes, “I’m not a baby. You can trust me with whatever you’re worried about.”
“Daddy!” Lily shouted.
Harry watched as Ida tapped on the door firmly. Moments later, an exhausted looking Savant opened the door.
“It’s one of the newspapers written for Voldemort supporters we discovered during the Blackwell case. I remembered the name Foget and went through the articles with Savant until I found it,” she gestured at the floor, which Harry now realized was covered in articles just like the one in his hand.
Ginny, Ron and Aviary all watched him with surprise as he answered the phone, “Hello?”
When Ron began to speak, it pierced through the silence like a knife, “It has been so long since someone I knew died.”
“I love you too, Ginny.”
“All this time,” she mumbled, “You’ve been putting yourself in danger to solve something that isn’t yours to solve?”
“Harry,” Aviary said gently, “I know it’s hard to accept, but we’ve had a real breakthrough. We have proof that Brayan is behind all of this. It’s time to move on with your life. Maybe focus on your…” she hesitated and looked awkwardly to the side.
Realizing he was still on top of someone, he cast a Petrificus Totalus at the struggling figure below him and jumped up off of him. He looked around to see what was going on: he could easily see that the Kareach members outnumbered the Aurors. The space wasn’t nearly large enough to occupy this many people, battling each other. His heart dropped when he noticed several Aurors collapsed on the floor. Praying that they were still alive, he moved to shoot a spell at a Kareach member Ron was battling. He used a leg locker curse, which caught the figure off guard and caused them to fall to the ground. Ron sent him an appreciative look and sent a curse at a Kareach member who was dueling with Padma.
Malfoy looked as if he was trying to hold back a laugh. Harry couldn’t help but respect him in the moment.
He stared at Draco, refusing to back away. Refusing to hide his feelings any longer. Draco wouldn’t look back at him. Finally, Draco muttered,
Ron shook his head, “You don’t understand. I was standing near Rana. He was fighting too. I didn’t see the person sneak up behind him. If I had been paying attention, I would have saved him.”
“They do if they want to get the best grades,” Draco countered, “Not that it mattered. Granger beat me. Every. Bloody. Time.”
“You have to,” Harry said, “I can’t believe I’m saying it, but I do think it was him. What Ida was saying made a good amount of sense.”
Draco nodded, “Yeah. Women who are already pregnant aren’t infected. The poison has no effect on already partially developed babies.”
Harry reached over to give Remmins a hug. Remmins stiffened; Harry wasn’t sure they had ever been close enough to hug in their time together as Aurors. But then Remmins fell into the hug, sobbing loudly into his shoulder. Harry let him. When he was an Auror, sometimes all he wanted was for someone to hold him close and remind him there was still some good in the world.
Draco looked around the room, “More importantly, what’s going on here?”
Harry laughed and pointed at the glass, “I’m saved from answering by the three-drink rule. It’s time for you to tell me what made my interview with you a living hell.”
“Draco…” Harry started again. Draco opened his mouth to cut him off again, but Harry held up his free hand to silence him.
Ida, Padma and Aviary all exchanged worried looks while Ginny looked at Harry with mixed concern and confusion.
“My dad should be here in a minute,” Scorpius confirmed, trying to stay engaged in his conversation with Harry while simultaneously watching the kite with rapt interest, “He left his favorite scarf at home and had to apparate back to get it.”
“You didn’t make me uncomfortable, don’t worry,” Harry assured, “I’m just dealing with a lot at the moment.”
“My article was rubbish, eh?” Harry joked, trying to diffuse Malfoy’s clear tension.
“I’m so sorry, Ron,” Harry was planning on hugging him for as long as it took, but Ron pulled back moments later.
Draco shrugged, “I was busy.”
“I would never lie about Murr,” Malfoy said seriously, “He deserves more than that.”
“Yes, we hated each other,” Harry relented, “But things have changed. Actually, he apologized to me about everything that happened at school. Even all the Death Eater stuff,” he finished in a whisper.
Harry stared at Brayan, his mouth slightly agape. He knew Brayan was wrong. Hermione had solved almost all of their problems at Hogwarts by looking tirelessly through books. For Brayan to tell Harry that trying to help find the poison was a complete waste of his time was both ignorant and suggested ill judgement as an instructor. Harry, realizing he had to answer despite his rising anger, said with little inflection in his words, “I will focus on my studies, sir. What else can I help you with?”
“Cheers to that!” Seb exclaimed, holding up a glass of water to the air.
Ron nodded in agreement, “We can’t risk Malfoy getting hurt. We are breaking the oath we made as Aurors just by involving him. And you.”
Harry hesitated, then continued, “I don’t think we should breeze past this,” he rambled, “We should at least talk about this plate!” he grabbed the plate with him on it, “And the mug!” he pointed at Draco’s hand that still held the mug with the park scene.
Seamus, who was bending down next to him, moved so he was sitting on the floor beside Harry, “Ginny asked me to help bring the kids home, so I did. She’s upstairs with them right now, passed out with all of them on the bed.”
“You like Malfoy!” she yelled, much more accusatory than Harry would have liked.
Harry, Arthur and Bill laughed at this. Only a few hours after his talk with Ginny, he was once again at the Burrow for Sunday lunch. They were all waiting to eat, with Ron and Hermione pulling the bulk of the preparation as they had been absent from numerous lunches due to their jobs. This gave Harry the opportunity to catch up with everyone. He had just finished learning about Louis’s first time using magic accidentally, which had drawn the entire family’s attention to Louis, resulting in him leaving to play in the yard with James and Roxy only minutes after arriving. Harry couldn't blame the kid; Molly had started baking an entire cake for him as soon as she heard.
Although Ginny sounded angry, the telltale signs in her voice told Harry she was on the verge of tears. Though they both knew Ron was in the wrong, the things he had said stung.
“Ron,” Harry said gently, “That’s exactly the point. We got into a relationship when we didn’t know enough about each other or ourselves. And while we will always love each other, we can’t be happy together anymore.”
Harry muttered “nox” outside his bedroom door so as to not wake Ginny with the bright light of his wand as he entered. Unlike Harry, Ginny was the world’s lightest sleeper. The slightest sound or hint of light could wake her within seconds. Harry slowly opened the bedroom door, being careful not to open it too far as he knew the point where the door would let out a loud screech. He managed to enter and closed the door without a sound and began to walk across the room to the bathroom when Ginny let out a loud cough.
Harry walked into St. Mungo’s canteen, the bright lights of the large room immediately contrasting the residual gloom from outside. The smell of today’s chips wafted from the kitchen, making Harry’s stomach growl in protest. It was late afternoon, so the canteen was relatively empty except for a couple Healer’s enjoying a quick break. Harry recognized Dean Thomas, a close friend of his, and he immediately waved and began to gravitate towards his friend until he remembered he was going to be late for the real reason he was at the hospital on his day off. He gave Dean a quick, “see you tomorrow” and headed for one of the conference rooms located off of the canteen.
“Not to mention your kid naming skills,” Malfoy continued, “No originality whatsoever. How Weasley put up with that, I have no idea.”
“Was there no time for her to tell me this?” Harry asked absentmindedly, knowing that’s not the takeaway of what James is saying but feeling slightly upset at the fact Ginny left without bothering to say goodbye herself.
Draco was so fixated on his writing he didn’t even glance at Harry as he approached. Harry braced himself and then gave Draco a small tap on his arm. Even that sent electricity up Harry’s arm. If something this small gave Harry an unexplained chill, how was he going to get through the next week? Or day?
Seamus shrugged, “As good as any of us can be. Gin and I got Lily and Al to stop crying after a while. Where were you, Harry? Lily kept screaming for you.”
“Thankfully, Padma realized you probably just apparated home, you know, after…” Aviary trailed off.
Harry was nursing a beer at the bar, watching the patrons around him mingle, laugh and dance. Maybe going to the bar alone wasn’t his brightest idea. Harry had never really gone alone in the past; Ron, Hermione and Ginny used to go out together all the time before they had kids. Without anyone to talk to, he was stuck with his own thoughts in a new atmosphere. He wasn’t even much of a drinker. He had been at the Leaky for almost an hour and he had just gotten about half way through his first beer. Sighing, Harry sat his beer down and wondered if he should just leave and go back home to Ginny and Lily. Harry reached into his pocket to grab a galleon when he felt a hand on his shoulder as someone lowered themselves into the empty chair next to him.
Aviary’s head snapped up. Her hands fell to her sides as she turned to face Harry directly, “No. I will not have you believe anything but the truth, not even for a moment,” Ginny moved to pat her back, but she brushed it off, “Gani Remmins was murdered by Ida, not two hours ago, in his own house! I heard her, telling him that he needed to take back what he said about Brayan being Imperius-ed or she would kill him! And Gani, Gani refused! Of course he did. He believed in justice and truth above all else, because he was a good man with strong morals. I thought Ida was the same way, but I was wrong. We all were wrong.”
“That’s a Black family emblem!” he exclaimed. He faced Harry, his eyes hot, “ You took us to a Black residence? As we are trying to escape murderous purebloods?”
With that, he threw open the hospital room door and ran to Hermione’s bedside. He then threw his arms around Hermione and Rose.
“Harry,” Padma admonished softly as she pulled away, “Don’t you dare blame yourself. I know what you’re thinking, but you did all you could when fifty killing curses were being fired at you. Both you and Draco performed courageously. There’s nothing any of us could have done.”
Harry sighed and sat down in the vacated armchair, “You shouldn’t be comforting me, Aviary. It should be the other way around.”
“Nope,” James shook his head.
“Do you two want me to take you home?” Harry asked, “Or you can stay. Either way. Just don’t feel pressured to.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered. The word alone sent shivers up and down Harry’s spine, “We will stop this. It has to be us.”
“Fine,” Harry stood up and turned around to grab his own chair firmly around the sides. He then picked it up over his head and threw it as hard as he could at the opposite wall. The chair slammed into the wall with an even louder sound than before.
“Okay,” Harry smiled, “I trust your judgement. It’s never been wrong before.”
“She really did it all, didn’t she?” Ron asked, his voice dangerously soft. Then, without warning, he kicked the chair in front of him, sending it across the room.
Harry stole a quick glance at Ida to find her shift awkwardly. It was small, something no one would have thought of as strange, but Harry knew. Part of her plan had backfired, and that brought a small shred of comfort to Harry in the moment.
After he sat down, Aviary asked him to explain what had happened at the hospital earlier that day. Harry told them of how he had been eating with Dean when suddenly he fell onto the floor. He described his attempts to help, voice catching when he told them how Draco showed up to help. He then described how the room went dark. Harry tried to avoid anything that made it sound like his main goal was to help Draco; he had already seen Ron’s reaction to that, he didn’t need anymore questions about his relationship with Draco. After he finished his story, ending with how he was hit with a stunning spell, Aviary spoke again.
Deciding to distract himself, he asked Blaise, “What happened to your arm? I didn’t get any of the story from Reyes.”
Harry was surprised to see Molly back so soon (she had been there a couple hours before) and he was especially surprised to see her look so excited? Upset? It was hard to tell with her sometimes.
“Who’s hurt? What happened!” Harry jumped up.
Harry froze, not knowing what to say. After a moment, he asked, “Then why act horribly towards me throughout the entire interview?”
Harry nodded, trying to suppress his surprise at this statement. The young woman Ida and Savant had agreed upon as her new partner seemed to be nothing like the imposing and commanding woman standing next to him. Her name was Aviary Jackmason, and she was a small and petite woman who, while being beyond passionate with her love for her new job, lacked a certain grit Harry associated with every Auror he had ever met.
Ida and Harry watched idly as some man downed five consecutive shots of vodka and let out a loud chant that was echoed by his mates. Harry could see the obvious disgust in Ida’s face.
“And hello to you, sweetheart,” Dean gushed, leaning over to give Lily a high five (a skill she was constantly glad to show off).
“See ya then.”
Harry turned now to Healer Brayan, “Do you have any idea where Draco is? I need to talk to him.”
Lily was now wailing. Harry watched as Albus reached out to comfort her, even though tears were in his own eyes. Harry couldn’t believe any of this was happening. How did James know anything about Draco?
“Who doesn’t know the great Hermione Granger-Weasley?” Seb excitedly stated, “She’s incredible! We worked together to arrange the House Elf rights protest in England, France and Germany. She gave me a platform and I can’t thank her enough for that.”
“Sir?” Harry asked, loudly and firmly enough to catch Savant’s attention.
“You know what I mean,” Malfoy sighed, “It wasn’t exactly ground-breaking, revolutionizing news.”
She pulled back, “Go see Ginny. She wants to make sure you are okay.”
“You’re in love?” she whispered again, “Oh, Harry.”
Harry made his way into the canteen with a couple of his fellow trainees for his lunch break. The morning had been only slightly less chaotic than the past weekend. The Healers were still working endlessly to ensure no more of the Muggle patients died from the mysterious poison they had all been contaminated with. As far as Harry knew, none of the Healers were any closer to finding out what the poison was and why it acted so horrendously among the patients but killed a relatively low amount of them. Harry made a mental note to search through Hermione’s large and ever-growing collection of books when he was next at her house. If anyone could have an answer to this, it was Hermione and her books.
Blaise glowered, “Probably because he’s disgusting to talk to and you didn’t want to ask more than you had to?”
“Wait,” Harry frowned, “What does this all have to do with Remmins?”
“Now I know why,” she said softly, “Having a man crush is a lot to process.”
“I can’t believe him!” Ginny cried later that night, “My own brother! This is our choice to make, not his. He has no right to tell us we ruined our family.”
“You act like we’re wild animals,” James scoffed, “We’re not that much of a pain.”
“Why, Harry?” Ginny asked softly when he finished, “I think they could really benefit you.”
Draco sighed, “I don’t know. They were clearly aiming for me. Unless they were just aiming to kill anyone and anything. But it all felt so deliberate. They know we are onto them. Whether or not me being at the hospital was a lucky coincidence is up in the air.”
Harry shook his head, “If the person is really good at concealing magic, couldn’t they be allowing the Aurors to see that one wand was used?”
As the conversation went on, Harry realized how fun his current assignment was. Seb was funny, smart and selfless, making Harry immediately like him. ‘If only everyone was this easy to talk to’ he thought as he and Seb dove into what was sure to be a lengthy topic of who would win the upcoming tournament, Puddlemere United or the Cannons.
“It’s because it wasn’t for quidditch,” Draco declared, “Reyes was shipping Chann to himself! Being a well-renowned quidditch coach of one of the most popular teams in the world is a perfect way to disguise the fact you are destroying the lives of muggles and muggleborns. He and Ida must have been working together for years!”
“Don’t you dare start,” Aviary threatened, “I don’t fucking care if I’m in danger. It sounds like Draco is in just as much danger as me, and he’s still going. I am doing this for Gani. I appreciate you taking me here, Harry, I really do. But I need to be there, wherever there is. I need to fight for him.”
“What, Ginny?!” Harry exclaimed, his words coming out louder and harsher than he expected.
Harry laughed, “Yes, I suppose so. That was pretty fucking important.”
Ida shook her head, the long braids running down to her waist moving accordingly, “No, they were not. They are good people, just privileged. Yes, even Aries,” Ida added as Ginny made a skeptical grimace, “Aries is a prat through and through, but he isn’t inherently… well… evil.” She shuddered and then continued, “None of our family holds prejudiced views. Our ancestors have seen too thoroughly acts of injustice against people for things they cannot control. That’s actually why I became an Auror here in England. I wanted to help fight to make the world better for others as moving to England did for me. Now, of course, the Ministry of the Philippines is much better under the direction of Aquino, which is a relief for all of us.”
He rummaged around in his bag until he felt the hard metal of his phone in the palm of his hand. Harry reluctantly turned it around and nearly tossed it back onto the bed when he saw ‘Draco’ was flashing across the screen. Every fiber in his body was telling him that answering the phone for Draco would be a bad thing for his mental health, but the unhelpful and disloyal logical part of his brain reminded him that Draco would only be calling if it were crucial.
“Well, it seems like you and Draco are the best of mates,” Ron said loudly, “If you’re on a bloody first name basis!”
“Alright, alright,” Blaise said. He looked from Harry to Draco and looked as though he was going to say something, but Draco shot him a fierce look. He stopped and simply said thank you to Harry. Harry walked to the door, looking back silently to see Blaise grasp Draco’s hand. A shock shot through him. Harry abruptly left the room and closed the door behind him.
“Healer Patrick? What was she doing there?” Harry exclaimed.
Draco opened the door and waved his arm towards the hallway, “So, if you don’t mind, I would like some sleep.”
“I am at St. Mungos with Draco. We both are safe. Draco knows the best way to revive victims. Please apparate people to the Mungos canteen straightaway,” Harry said. He then focused on his patronus reaching his friends fighting at the quidditch pitch.
“That’s what I meant,” Ron said sheepishly as the rest of the group laughed.
Healer Patrick moved swiftly past him and closed the door behind her with a wave of her wand. Harry quickly followed, having to take long strides to keep up with her urgency. She wasn’t even a particularly tall woman, but she walked at a pace faster than Harry thought possible without being considered a run. As they walked, she began to talk.
Sure enough, moments later Aviary walked through. She looked someone even more exhausted than her boss, exhibited by her tangled blonde hair falling out of a messy ponytail and the large bags under her eyes.
“Harry, I want you to be happy!” she wailed, “I just don’t know how to handle this! Ginny is so close to me…”
“We thought we would be too late,” Neville said quietly.
Harry found himself nodding although the last thing he wanted to do was go in and see Ron and Padma again. But he followed Ginny into the house without another word, because it was Christmas Eve. He couldn’t miss spending that with his family, no matter how frustrated he was.”
“Ron,” Hermione chided, “being in Slytherin does not make you a bad person! What if Rose was in Slytherin? What would you say then?”
“You need to hear what happened,” Ron’s voice wavered but he spoke with determination, “So, this morning Brayan was interviewed, as you know.”
“Harry, there was an attack on a muggle shop this time. A place called Sandy’s Salad Bar in Yorkshire,” Ron shuddered as he continued to recount the story, “It was terrible! Sandy herself had been put under the Imperius curse for hours before we got there. Over twenty muggles were poisoned, left passed out on the floor of the restaurant.”
Harry raised his eyebrows as Aviary gasped.
Harry thanked her and made his way around the house saying goodbye to the rest of his family. He then stepped out into the yard to apparate, mind envisioning the large park in the center of his neighborhood.
Savant looked hesitant, but he nodded in agreement, “What you are both saying has merit. We will bring Zabini in tomorrow.”
Harry looked closer; sure enough, the man was not Zabini. His build wasn’t as lean and his smile wasn’t as kind. Harry wondered absently when he had begun to think of Zabini’s smile as kind.
“Since always?” Dean said, taking a large bite.
“Put that down,” a voice said roughly from the door.
“What do you mean?” Ron had made his way out of the group hug and was now standing up next to his sister.
“Of course, of course!” Savant covered, “I don’t believe that! I’m just saying that many people who work in the Ministry once held terrible views and now they don’t.”
Harry nodded solemnly, “It really is. Especially from someone we all respected and trusted.”
There was no doubt in Harry’s mind this kite would put any other kite in the tri-state area to shame. Harry took the kids to a park that was within walking distance of his house. The park usually consisted of primarily muggles, as Harry and Ginny didn’t live in a wizarding community, but a neighborhood with muggles and wizarding families alike. For example, Terry Boot and his family lived only two kilometers away. However, most of the families were muggles, which meant Harry’s kids had grown up with muggle traditions alongside wizarding ones. Lately, his kids, especially Al, had taken a liking to kite flying. It was only a matter of time before Rose and Al constructed the biggest and greatest kite they could create. Their style was to always go above and beyond on anything that involved creativity.
“But surely Ginny has told you everything?” he asked sadly.
“But this is crucial,” Draco insisted, “She would have found a way to let us know straight away, so we can get there as soon as possible.”
She looked up, not at all alarmed as she spotted Harry and pointed her wand to remove the charm. He watched as she walked over and knelt down beside him, her long black hair framing her face in ragged strands. Harry couldn’t imagine how long it had been since she had left the office.
As Hermione pulled back, she murmured something so softly that only Harry could hear, “You need to tell her, Harry.”
“You know I love kids,” Dean said, placing an arm around his husband, “But I can’t act like a plastered fool around them. Especially Roxy. At that one Christmas Eve party she took away my wand and said I wasn’t allowed to use it until the morning. She was five at the time!”
“So you both cheated?” Ron accused, “Great. Glad to know both of you threw a healthy marriage away for two Slytherins,” Rose began to wail at this, to which Ron looked away in shame.
“Bullocks!” Roxy protested, “None of you work for the Ministry!”
Draco nodded, “I wasn’t about to let her die from this terrible poison. And I couldn’t have done it without Harry.”
“Astoria, you know I think nothing of the sorts. I was only saying it would be hard for Scorpius to give up the obligatory hour it would take to explain his knowledge of hippogriffs to Potter,” Malfoy smiled down at his son, something Harry realized he did with ease.
“I’m sorry we ruined your Christmas Eve,” Harry said softly.
Seamus looked from Ron to Ginny to Harry, “I’m sorry, mate,” he said to Harry, “I didn’t know this was a secret.”
Ida reached for his arm, “I know, Harry. He is, well was, a well respected healer. He donated to all kinds of charities. He was a teacher that showed nothing but kindness to the trainees. None of it makes sense, and that’s the point. He had the perfect disguise. That’s what got me thinking: the last time I talked to him, after the St. Mungos attack, he was so polite. Too polite, almost. He had so many questions about you, Harry. About whether or not you were still well connected to the Auror department. At the time, he passed it off making conversation. But the more I considered it overtime, the stranger it seemed that he would be so curious about your relationship with the Aurors after his hospital had lost twenty people from an attack. I thought about that yesterday, after Blaise didn’t work out. Brayan reminded me of Blaise, because he was a well respected and likeable man who was at both the hospital and quidditch stadium during the respective attacks. Not to mention he would have a much better access to poison as a healer than Blaise would as the head of Games and Sports. That’s when I remembered something- we saw Brayan in Diagon Alley after one of the first attacks. He was in the Owl Emporium, hiding behind some barrels. Do you remember?”
As if sensing his inner turmoil, Draco asked sternly, “Harry, what is going on? Why are we here?”
“I know I did. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to be a part of this investigation. That and my position as an aspiring Healer would make me useful to Draco,” Harry said.
“I hate this fucking clock,” she mumbled fiercely, pulling her red hair into a messy pony tail and stalking to the bathroom.
They both gave him a confused look but they didn’t say anything else, so Harry could only assume they were reciting his words in their minds.
“Draco!” Harry reached for his arm, “I wouldn’t break your heart! I feel the same way you do. I want this to work out, so much it hurts. Don’t you understand that?”
“Because I’m a wanker,” Harry held his arms up, “That’s just it. I’m a mess who’s dealing with a fuck ton of stuff at the moment, and I’m not handling it well. It has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with me.”
Harry looked up at Draco and ignored the prickly sensation forming in his stomach, “It’s just us, then.”
“Victore sent a letter just yesterday telling us how much she loves Charms. That was always my strongest subject as well, so it was wonderful to hear she was a natural. Of course, I was taking it at Beauxbatons, but the classes I attended at Hogwarts were just as good! I only hope she makes some more friends soon. Teddy is a wonderful boy, but a young girl needs to learn to make new friends she hasn’t known since birth…”
“Try the match of the decade!” Seamus exclaimed, “I would say century but I don’t think I could ever have as much fun as I did the night of the Quidditch World Cup.”
“Let me show you,” Draco bent down to riffle through a tote bag Harry now realized was sitting on the floor next to the table. Harry also saw his own coat sitting next to it in a heap. Draco must have taken his coat to get him up here. It was a way to reassure that Harry couldn’t refuse to talk to Draco.
Draco smiled, he was glad that Potter had that Gryffindor courage in him today, “Let me get dressed and I’ll come back.” He now had to face the rather embarrassing walk back to his office in his pyjamas, Bezoar still in his pocket.
When Draco was on his third glass - Harry still only just on his second - he smiled wistfully, “Whatever happened with you and the Weasley girl?”
Draco waved his wand and the radio playing Christmas music came flying through to the dining room. It filled the room with cheerful tunes and everybody started to eat. Molly and Harry sat at the ends of the long table, seemingly separated by a never-ending plateau of food. George, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Hannah all sat in the middle of the table, talking amongst themselves and laughing with one another. Kreacher and Draco sat next to Harry, and they sat in a relative silence; appreciating the family that surrounded them. There was no ceremony here – everyone talked and laughed and ate in a pyjama-clad ease.
to clean, Harry?” she asked, looking around the hallway of Grimmauld place.
Harry, Ron and Hermione go back to the club...
Draco scrawled a quick letter stating that this was most acceptable and sealed it, ready to post. At least he had something to do. He put the letter from Granger in his pocket and sat silently on a clear spot on the table. He would have to return to Hogwarts, this was beyond a doubt. He groaned aloud, to no one in particular and stood up, straightening himself as he did. He went downstairs, and saw Nancy giving the shop a once over before she was set to leave.
“Knees,” he choked out, “Now,”
Harry put the boxes back in the cabinet and hopped down from his perch on the counter.
Draco nodded, “Well I’m certainly glad to hear that, was there anything that could be improved?” He asked, always wanting to make his work better.
Draco rolled his eyes, playfully, “Of course I have, I’m a potions master,” He smiled at her, “But for students it does pose a challenge. So,” he raised his copy of the textbook into the air, and spoke loudly, for emphasis, “read up on it. Study it. Do your research before the next class. I shall know if you haven’t done it when you inevitably produce a shoddy mess.” he smiled and motioned to the students to pack up their things.
Potter had calmed somewhat upon Dracos entering the room. His screaming had stopped, but he sobbed. Draco suspected that he was waking up. He quietly set the kettle above the fire and summoned the tea set to him, ready to be filled.
Malfoy began to chuckle, his throaty laugh again in Harry’s ear. He pulled Harry even closer, sliding his thigh between Harry's legs, holding him firm on his hips, “something you like?”
Harry knew that if they were to leave it just a few moments more that the display would be too obscene for a nightclub… even one in Soho. He simply nodded, the idea of not having to hold back was too inebriating. He wanted Malfoy alone, ready to devour in a heated frenzy either in his shitty flat, the back of a taxi, or even the fucking bathrooms for all he cared.
Draco had butterflies around Harry.
With the sound of the door shutting, Draco thrust harder and faster than he had before, and really pulled hard on Harry’s hair. Harry grunted as Draco pulled his head back, and felt the familiar weight of orgasm budding in his stomach.
“I’ll see you at the feast?” Harry asked as he approached the door.
Draco was confused, “what map?”
Draco sat next to him and spoke softly, “I can’t imagine what you’re going through,” Potter looked at him, his eyes still full of tears, “we’re all here for you. Neville, Hermione and Ron. I am too, I know we’ve not seen eye to eye in the past, but I’m here for you and I’m trying to be a good person.”
Harry sighed, “Mischief managed.”
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.” Draco said, holding his hand out for Harry to take.
“None at all, Harry.” Draco replied.
“God, you’re so… so fucking good, Harry,”
Draco carried on with his notes, now sitting at the desk rather than standing. Harry continued to look around the room, and inspected the table in front of him. He remembered carving his name into one of them in his fifth year. Draco scribbled away, finally ending his notes with a flourish - ever the lover of drama.
It had grown dark outside. The living room at Grimmauld place was cosy and warm. Harry and Draco laid together on the settee; Ron and Hermione laid in each other’s arms on the pile of cushions and bean bags – Ron was hard fast asleep; Arthur and Molly had gone to bed; and Ginny and George were playing Chess quietly in the corner. Kreacher had gone to bed long ago, apparently relaxing was tiring for him.
“It’s not been too bad,” Draco smirked, “Why?”
He froze.
“It feels odd to be back,” Draco commented, “I’d just got used to being with you every day.”
“I’m going to re-regret this in the, the erm… what’s the word?” He looked up at Draco, his eyes clouded and a stupid smile on his face.
A second or two of shock hit Harry – had she been reading his mind? He thought that he’d got pretty good at Occlumency over the years. It had become second nature to him, so surely, he would have felt if she was?
Harry nodded, and waved his hand towards the archway, showing Draco the way out. He smiled to himself after Draco had gone – even though he felt like he had been run over by Buckbeak he was almost happy for the first time in years.
“Somebody has been printing and sending fraudulent Hogwarts acceptance letters,” he explained and stepped closer to the board, “Some of the letters were mistakenly sent to young witches and wizards who are already at Hogwarts and so their parents alerted the Ministry. Others were sent to muggles who had no idea what all this was about. We have some of those letters here…” he pointed to another spot on the board where he had tacked two letters, “but they’re yet to be analysed because as usual Auror Anderson is taking forever.”
Draco glared at him, “Don’t push it scarhead.”
He fingered the expensive wool blanket that covered him and looked toward the window, past his plush curtains and rare, antique furniture. The sky was a cold shade of blue and threatened rain - those were Draco's favourite kind of days. He got out of bed, pulling on his soft leather slippers, and walked over to the small burner he had in his room to warm his hands.
An arrest is made, and Draco pays a visit
“We’re going to get it properly tested by the Ministry, then if everything goes through okay we decided that the best thing to do would be to let St Mungo’s and the Ministry do with it what they wish.” Hermione explained. Harry smiled, there was a hint of pride in his eyes. Potter was about to say something when Draco got up, walked to the counter and ordered a drink.
When Draco reached his room and pulled his old Quidditch robes out of his chest, he began to get excited about the prospect of playing Quidditch, and his nervousness faded away. He looked at his robes, and smiled. He’d had them specially made years ago and they were divine to look at – he even thought so himself. They were made of jet-black dragon hide and a charcoal grey fabric, with the Malfoy family crest embroidered in dark green, black, and silver thread on the back. He had to hold himself back from running to the Quidditch pitch, he was so excited to play again.
Harry nodded, “He’s got Hannah though. He seems to have been able to move on. It’s the same with Ron and Hermione: they’re both just fine. I just seem to be the only one that can’t get over it all.”
Evening all! If you're wondering I've had a wonderful day and I hope you have too - the gods know we deserve it at the moment.
Stay safe and sane peeps <3
Afternoon! The final chapter is upon us :( I really appreciate all of your support and feedback throughout this fic, it has been wonderful and y'all are amazing <3
He looked around the living room for Draco but he clearly wasn’t here. Harry listened out, and the kitchen was in silence. He shoved his hands into his pockets and went upstairs. Draco was unpacking in the bedroom, and had taken the liberty of bringing some of his furniture. A huge black and silver ornate mirror was propped up on an equally ornate set of drawers. Harry smiled to himself; the combination of expensive Malfoy and scruffy Potter amused him, but he enjoyed it.
Harry put the tickets to one side, and pulled out a soft present. He knew straight away what this was and looked at Molly and Arthur. He opened it and sure enough, it was knitwear. He pulled a selection of knitted ties and socks from the wrappings, as well as a knitted hooded jacket. He thanked Molly and Arthur.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” he said and gave her a heartfelt hug, “Thank you to all of you for being so wonderful.” He said, and he cleared his throat – obviously trying to disguise the tears that threatened to spill.
He took a deep breath, and took his first present. It was soft, and wrapped in dark paper. He slid his finger under the seam and examined what was in front of him. It was an incredibly soft knitted emerald green jumper, the colour seemed to glimmer in the light like it was a liquid. Draco gasped softly as he unfolded it and saw ‘DLM’ on the front in silver writing. He looked up, and saw Molly beaming down at him. Ron, Arthur, Hermione, George, Ginny and Harry all smiled at him too. He had his very first Weasley jumper.
Draco considered things for a second or two, “I think it can,” he paused, “I’ll just have to figure out why I’m feeling the way I do. I wonder if I could just be happy?” he mused.
“Alexandre…” Harry repeated, savouring the name on his tongue, and using two fingers to draw the dancers head up to look at him, “Hmm, I like the way that that--” he was cut off by Malfoy, who wrapped his hand around the dancers arm and pushed him away forcefully, sending him tumbling into the crowd, out of Harry’s arms.
She smiled warmly at him and he sat down, “Thank you for meeting with me,” Draco said, “I was concerned that I wouldn’t get anywhere.”
He flicked his wand at a textbook and it opened to the right page, “Right, read up on the unforgivable curses, and then I’ll do a demonstration.” He sat behind his desk and watched the class working. The red teacup sat to his right, and as he looked at it the pattern parted:
He let go of Draco's hair, and pulled him into yet another frenzied kiss, both getting lost in the sensations building. He felt Draco’s release, heard his shout of ecstasy, and his whole body relaxed around his own. He allowed himself to let go. Burying deep in Draco as he did, he continued kissing Draco all over. He dropped his head to Draco's chest, who brought a hand up to stroke Harry’s hair.
“Absolutely nothing, it was better than all the things I’ve tried before.” Harry stressed.
Howdy! I hope everyone is doing well, and enjoying this fic!
Continue to leave love, and I'll continue to revel in it instead of my insecurities xx
He’d never really touched Malfoy with any intention, other than to fight with him, so he was shocked that his cool, pale hand felt
“If it wouldn’t be too much hassle?” Potter smiled, “I imagine it will be fairly quiet tonight, it is a Thursday night after all.”
He pushed the door open, and walked into the bustling hall. He spotted his N.E.W.Ts students straight away studying for their Draught of Living Death lesson on the Monday. He smiled to himself, he really was beginning to love being back at Hogwarts.
Harry took a deep breath, pretending that he actually had to consider Draco’s question, “Well I thought that I’d stay on my own and do some work.” he said nonchalantly, and drained his cup of pumpkin juice.
He did not tell them of the nightmares that he still had, or of the emotional scars that his life had left on him.
Hannah and Neville came up to Harry, “Thank you for a wonderful Christmas day, Harry,” Neville said, “But we’re going to head back to the pub now,” he explained, “We really should relieve the staff so they can go home.” He laughed.
Harry sighed, “I suppose I best go and sort my things out. Unpack and all that.” he lamented.
Malfoy sighed and rolled his eyes slightly, “Yes I know. Neither do I. People don’t really want to be around me much anymore.” He shot a knowing look at Harry, and crossed his arms. The snake on his cloak curled around him more.
Harry nodded, he understood just how hard it had been on George and Ron. Draco nodded, not saying anything, but trying to show Ron that he wasn’t totally a dick.
Draco nodded in response and only glanced at Potter briefly. He felt Potters gaze on him but looked at his hands.
When Harry met Draco outside Grimmauld Place, he was nervous. He'd not really ever been on a date before, and he wasn't sure what to expect; his mind raced, should he be himself? Or should he be more on guard after everything that had happened? His shoulder twinged as he worried, drawing his mind from his anxiety. Draco looked relaxed, his hair artfully tousled, and his coat collar turned up. He held a newspaper, undoubtedly full of odds for the match that they were going to see, and it made Harry wonder whether he should have placed a bet or two.
Draco nodded in agreement as Neville passed him his drink. Harry headed upstairs to their room and sunk into one of the big comfortable arm chairs. The fire was lit and Harry watched it flicker and pop in the grate, Draco frowned at the fireplace and took his jumper off.
“Open it.” Draco smiled.
“Where the fuck was Malfoy?” Ron's voice was small, “it took me a while to trust that slimy git but he has always protected Harry as partners. Why wasn't he there?” A stifled sob escaped his lips and he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, he took a deep breath to try and steady himself but the fact that this was Harry - his best friend, brother, partner in crime - could not be ignored. They had grown up together, fought a war together, nearly died together. To think that Harry had nearly died without Ron there made him regret not joining the aurors.
repress everything?” she asked, and sat on the step ladders near the wall of stock. Draco sat on the stairs while he considered telling her everything. He needed someone other than Potter to listen to him.
Happy Midnight! So because I've had a shit of a shift at work, I decided to upload two chapters today - for whatever reason. As promised - here is the second chapter.
He thought about the case. If these letters were being sent out by a squib, what were their motives? Were they jealous of people who could go to Hogwarts? Did they want to shatter some dreams by getting peoples hopes up and then subjecting them to the same heartbreak that they had gone through? Did they simply want to break that statute of secrecy in an effort to get back at the wizarding world? He contemplated the possibilities as he stood, face down under the hot water. He pushed his long, wet hair back and let the hot water beat down onto his face.
“Pity,” Hermione said, “Who else is coming?” She looked hopefully at Harry. She took a cup of tea from the tray that Kreacher had brought in and cradled it in her hands.
“I do think that you take the Slytherin/Gryffindor unity a touch too far, Potter,” Draco smiled, “but I love it.” He planted a kiss on Harry’s paint splashed hair and heaved his trunk inside.
Draco stood in front of his wardrobe, searching for a shirt, “The idea was to reply through Kreacher,” Harry heard rather than saw Draco’s smile, “or did that not cross your mind, Potter?” Harry admired Draco’s back. It was pale, and not as broad as his own, but there was a strength to it that surprised him. He discarded his apple core in the burner and continued to look at Malfoy. He flicked through hangers in his wardrobe, seemingly unable to decide what to wear.
“Kreacher!” He cried aloud, hoping that the House Elf could provide some relief.
Ron broke out into a big grin, “He’ll be happy to hear that, I am too, to be honest. We initially wanted to smuggle them into Hogwarts - we used them in eighth year, didn’t we Harry? - but surprisingly they didn’t sell that well.”
Malfoy took his hand, his long pale fingers clasped around Harrys tightly, “I suppose I’m glad to see you too, Potter.” His words meant well, but there was still no feeling to them.
“Thank you, Mrs Granger,” he said, “Merry Christmas.” He opened the package and let the paper fall to the floor. He held the small pair of rich purple slippers and put them on his feet with a giggle. They clashed awfully with his red house jacket, but he liked them all the same. Harry smiled as he watched his elf dancing slowly in his new slippers. Kreacher, technically, could have been freed years ago but he stayed at Grimmauld place anyway.
Good Morning all! As usual, I hope you enjoy this chapter <3
“Alright mate?” Ron said, pulling Harry into a tight hug. Hermione watched them with a smile and then pulled Harry into yet another hug. She took her coat and scarf off and hung them on the rail. Ron had already thrown his jacket on the stairs and draped his scarf over the bannister.
Fuck.
Malfoy nodded, “Yeah, okay…. There’s my green, your red colour….” he traced his finger over the different colours, “this yellow here is…” he tapped the colour with his wand and a kind of profile expanded in front of them, showing a Ministry ID and details of the users wand, “yeah… see that’s Anderson. There’s no other traces of magic on here which means to me that the person who did it isn’t a wizard.”
He’d left it too long.
Kreacher looked, shocked, at Hermione, then at Harry who grinned. Kreacher had thought that his Christmas bonus was the only present that he would get this year. Hermione gave him a small package and Kreacher looked up at her with big, watery eyes.
Harry interrupted him before he could carry on, “Merlin, shut up Ron.” He ditched his glass on the table and stormed off.
“So how’s life treating you Draco?” She asked after they had finished their business. She packed away her notebook and quill and sat with her hands clasped around yet another hot drink.
“Sorry, where is Auror Potter, please?” She asked, with all the politeness she could muster at such a late hour, though the tears streaming down her face betrayed her true feelings.
Harry shook his head, “Okay, so maybe I’ve slipped up a bit, but please professor, I’m only just getting my life on track.”
Harry could sense what Draco was doing, “Let go…. Let it go Draco.” He panted, and watched as Draco tipped his head back and bit his lip hard in anticipation. Within a mere minute of Harry telling Draco to lose control, Harry continued to watch Draco over his shoulder as he tensed and clenched his hands into Harry’s back. Draco looked totally gone, completely and utterly surrendered to the force of his orgasm; Harry found the sight exhilarating and it spurred him on even more. Draco carried on through his own aftershocks, his face twisted into ecstasy and Harry felt himself slipping further towards his own pinnacle.
Leave some love, let me know y'all are enjoying everything xx
A healer entered the room, “thank you for being here,” she began, her voice quiet in the tension filled room, “he’ll appreciate the comfy clothes and the support. For now though, please go rest. Mr Thomas and Mr Finnegan are here to visit, they'll keep you updated, I'm sure.”
Draco tapped his trunk with his wand, and it closed itself up. He levitated it over to sit on top of Harry’s where it settled with a loud thunk. It seemed that Draco had settled in quite well too.
Mornin' folks!
“What the fuck happened?!” Ron's voice boomed throughout the halls in St Mungo's and only Hermione could hold him back. He stormed into the private rooms one by one looking for Harry. Hermione stopped trying to get her fiance under any semblance of control, and instead looked for a healer.
Hermione shook her head and went through to the kitchen to put her bags down. Ron and Harry followed. Hermione was shoulder deep in her bag and Harry realised that she must have brought her charmed bag. Ron shrugged at Harry and chuckled softly.
Ron clapped Harry on the back, “It’s good to see you happy after all this time mate,” Harry smiled at Ron, “even if it is with a git like Malfoy.” He smiled, he was only teasing of course.
“Can you not call me Malfoy?” His voice was still small, timid.
He set the teapot down on the table with a soft clink, and waited for it to brew.
“Can you get me some please? If it’s at all possible.” Harry asked.
“Did you wrap this?” Draco smiled, and Harry nodded, “I’m impressed: it’s beautiful.” He said with a wide smile and messed Harry’s hair even more. He opened the gift and inspected one of the boxes. Molly, Ginny and Arthur gasped when they saw the beautiful box and Harry smiled softly.
Harry stopped thinking at that point, and just kissed him back. He let his hands touch Draco all over. Draco’s hand held Harry tightly by the neck, and his other held his hips, pulling him toward him. Draco’s hand roamed up to Harry’s unruly black hair and gave it a playful tug. Harry groaned as he did, not expecting to like the feeling as much as he did. Draco’s tongue demanded entry into Harry’s mouth; he let it happen. Harry’s hands roamed all over. He caressed that deceptively strong back, and felt his lean muscles under his shirt. He stroked Draco’s bicep, and held tightly onto his shoulder. He couldn’t get enough. It was the hungriest kiss that Harry had ever experienced. Draco fought for dominance which Harry wasn’t having.
Draco glided through the dense crowd of people, up to the dancer, and placed a few sickles on the stage with a wink. The elegance and grace that Malfoy handled himself with irritated Harry. Had it been anyone else that moved that way, he would have found it endearing, but on Draco he found it arrogant, self-aggrandising - the result of having an aristocratic upbringing. Harry watched as Draco flashed the dancer a sultry smile and felt a stab of something - anger, perhaps. He took a sip of his drink and cast his gaze down to the floor.
He checked his watch, it was still the middle of the night. He glanced out of his window into the murky dark sky and sighed to himself. When would he ever get a grip on his sleep, would he ever be able to have a peaceful night?
Harry closed his eyes. He knew what was coming next and wanted to savour the feeling.
“Which ones have you used and why?”
Does Malfoy's hunch have any evidence? Is it even possible?
“I thought everything was going okay but…” Draco trailed off, he didn’t really know what to say.
“Surprise you?” Potter smiled, and walked further into the classroom. He looked around him, and shuddered slightly at the prospect of being back in the potions room, “I forgot how depressing it is in the dungeons.” he commented, sitting on a stool at one of the workbenches.
Kreacher smiled at Harry, “Master Draco wants to know if Master Potter would like to go for a drink at the Three Broomsticks this afternoon?” His croaky voice filled the room.
they telling you?” he asked, glancing at the letter on Malfoys desk.
The potions classroom was empty, all except for Draco. He had been hunched over one of the work desks for hours and hours, surrounded by books and vials of ingredients. A cauldron bubbled to his left, and he had a recipe scribbled on a piece of parchment to his right. He jotted corrections on it, time and time again until he was finally happy with his design. He had tried the concoction for himself the day before, and he was pleasantly surprised with the results. He stirred the potion, and a cloud of deep purple steamed from the cauldron. The potion inside was a purple, silvery colour and he theorised that it was damn near perfect. He summoned a box of single dose vials, and began to fill them with his creation. He smiled with satisfaction as he put the now full vials into the box and wrapped it in a dark green bow. A wave of nervousness hit him – was this the right thing to do? Was this too much? He shook it off and put his nervousness down to the fact that this would be the biggest, most personal gesture he’d ever done for someone.
Harry simply nodded, not having the energy to speak just yet. He felt Draco kiss him one more time, before getting up. He heard the rustle of material, and finally opened his eyes. They were heavy, there was the fatigue creeping up on him. In a slow move, he sat up. The room around him was warm and close, the air thick with their activities and sweat. He pulled the top sheet around him, and opened the door that was at the end of the bed. The cool air swept through the room, providing welcome relief and waking him up a bit in the process.
“Thank you.” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear. It sent shivers down his spine and he felt almost affectionate for Harry. Harry held him even tighter for a moment before releasing him.
Harry only finished his ministrations when he was sure that Draco was fully prepared. He pulled off, going once more to kiss Draco.
Draco chewed his lip, “I didn’t bring any pyjamas,” he said guiltily, “I didn’t know.”
Harry told his story - unfiltered - of going on the hunt for horcruxes and destroying them. He told them how he walked into the forest, ready to die, and finally he told them how he defeated Voldemort in their final duel. He explained how the Deathly Hallows tied into everything, and how he won the Elder wand’s allegiance. He told them about Ron and Hermione's efforts too, as well as Neville's - he wanted to stress that he wasn’t in all of this alone. He had always had help.
Harry nodded and put the red cup back into its box. The writing on its corresponding cup gradually faded and the pattern returned. Hermione packed the cup safely away and looked at Harry with such affection.
you, you’ll just have to fucking
Grimmauld Place had changed drastically since the Order days. When he had finished his Auror training, Harry had paid the best craftsmen to restore the house to its former grandeur. It was no longer dusty and dishevelled, but refined, classy, and comfortable. The portrait of Walburga had been miraculously removed, Harry wanted to get a portrait of Sirius hung in the same spot but he was yet to find an artist that could do credit to his godfather. He had grown to love the old building dearly; it had become something of a sanctuary for him thanks to the heavy wards that kept the house hidden from the world. It was one of the only places where Harry could be
Draco nodded and cast his eyes to the floor, “I guess I should go do that too,” he said, “I’ll need to get the classroom ready and all that. I’m certain that things will have been left there from before the break.” he groaned.
The teachers ate together, for the first night, not sitting at the high table but rather at what would be the Gryffindor table. The new potions master had not yet arrived, and it seemed that most of the teachers Harry spoke to had no clue who it was. Neville Longbottom greeted Harry with a firm handshake and a warm smile.
After nearly a week of avoiding Potter and hiding away again, Saturday came. Draco prepared himself for his meeting with Hermione. He found that he was a little nervous because he hadn’t seen her properly since the war. He wanted to make a good impression, he wanted to show her that he had changed. He dressed smartly, hoping to show her that he was serious about things now and made his way to Hogsmeade.
She stood outside her office, talking to Ursula – one of Harry’s sixth year students. Harry assumed that this must be something about her and so he waited his turn.
Draco grunted, “Not even a carriage full of chocolate could make me leave bed right now.”
“Potter, Ursula Redsoule tells me that you’ve still not marked homework from before Christmas,” McGonagall looked across at him from her desk and crossed her arms, “I think, maybe, you have a few
He started slow, both to adjust to the feeling of being filled by Harry, and to tease Harry to the point of frustration. Without warning, he dropped onto Harry with all his might, sending Harry as deep as was possible; he knew this felt good.
“Draco…” Harry said, holding aloft an envelope that he had torn into, “We’re going to the Quidditch world cup…” He gawped at Ginny, unable to fathom that she had spent so much on him.
With a grunt Harry shoved his clothes off the end of the bed, and untangled the bedding and spread it over the bed. He looked at the curtains on the bed and smiled. They were the standard red colour that had graced his bed for seven years in the student dorms. He wondered if they were green in Slytherin’s dorms.
Harry laughed, “Let them talk then – they talk about me anyway.”
He sighed and shrugged, “Not good,” he looked back over the dancefloor, it was still fun, but many people had paired off and left together, “you know, I want my money back,” he laughed, and the bartender laughed with him.
“Because it’s Harry’s first Christmas with Draco,” she hissed at him, clearly exasperated, “and while you may not appreciate the romantic effort, Draco will.”
“Yeah, it’s got nothing at all to do with the department’s choice of partner for me, whatsoever.” Harry muttered, barely audible above the loud music, but very clearly dripping with sarcasm.
“Oh… Oh, Draco,” he panted, and Draco pulled harder on his wild hair, “Oh Draco, don’t you dare stop.” He looked at Draco over his shoulder the best he could and forbid him to stop with his eyes.
Draco tidied the room with a brief wave of his wand and Harry picked up his clothes. He had no issues with being so exposed around Draco, but it was close to the evening feast and he had to get ready. Draco poured a cup of tea for Harry and smiled at him.
“It’s been the best Christmas I could have asked for,” Harry said, “I’ve had all the people I love under one roof.”
As they walked to the stands Harry felt Draco's hand bump up against his a few times. With a fond smile, and quite a few nerves, he bit the bullet and grasped Draco's hand in his own. A small gasp escaped Malfoys lips, and Harry found himself looking - he knew what those lips could do, what they tasted like, what reaction they could provoke - and yet right now the smile that emerged was beautifully naive and sweet. A flush crept up onto his cheeks so Harry squeezed his hand, just to see the blush grow even more.
Draco pushed his finger further in, and Harry let out his breath as Draco began to move his finger rhythmically. Harrys hands wound into his crazy hair and he arched his back as Draco pulled his finger out and added another. It was positively exquisite. Harry could hear Draco chuckling smugly to himself and it sent shivers down his spine, Draco’s sexy chuckle was really something intoxicating in itself – but combined with the movement of his fingers it almost sent Harry over the edge.
Draco sighed, and turned back to the castle, thinking about his new found friendship with Potter, and whether or not he really was okay. He made a mental note to try harder with Potter, to really make sure that he could help him turn back into the sarcastic git that he remembered from school.
Draco cleared his throat and walked further into the kitchen, “anything I can do?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Only one of? Good lord Potty, I’m going to have to do better than that,” He spoke with a smile and a mock sense of outrage. Harry had learned all the nuances of Dracos tone, and even now it had the power to drive him mental.
After everyone had settled in, they crowded into the living room and talked about anything and everything. The room was charged with people’s festive energy. Harry spoke to Ginny at length about her Quidditch career, and asked her everything he possibly could think of with regards to her predictions for the next year. They sat near the fire and it crackled enthusiastically as if it could sense Harry’s admiration for Ginny’s athletic career. George, Ron and Kreacher sat together in a pile of cushions debating something which resulted in sporadic howls of laughter from George. Neville, Hermione and Hannah talked about Hermione’s political career and her role within the Ministry – something that Hannah seemed to have a great interest in. They sat in some armchairs that Ron had brought through when more people arrived and they sipped butterbeer. Molly and Arthur sat together, watching their raucous family – adopted and all – spend quality time together and sighed contentedly at the sight.
Harry and Draco go for breakfast... are they friends now?
“Oh, good. That’s exactly what I wanted.” Harry shot Draco a sarcastic look and they both started laughing, their new found camaraderie coming out in full force.
The corridors were quiet - it was still relatively early on Saturday morning and students were entitled to a small lie in on weekends. Draco had this corridor to himself, and took pleasure in being able to walk tall, open, and confident while no one was here to judge him. It was a most pleasant walk to the hall, and one of those small things in life that Draco had come to appreciate. He thought to himself about Potter, and found himself growing concerned - he remembered overhearing from Gryffindors in their school days just how intense Potters nightmares were, and felt himself growing sympathetic towards him. Perhaps, he thought, perhaps having a friend in Potter would help them both get their lives on track.
Draco waved his wand at the piano and it began to play a quiet festive tune, it set the tone wonderfully. Harry put his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close as they watched everyone take their seats in the room: Ginny and Molly sat near the tree – ready to pass presents out; Arthur, George and Ron sat on the settee all looking excited at the mound of presents; Hannah and Neville leaned against the fireplace, their hands intertwined and talking among themselves; Kreacher sat on the piano stool, his feet swinging under the chair; Hermione sat near Kreacher, apparently wanting to take a break from being in control; Draco and Harry sat on the rug in front of the fire, drinking in the festive atmosphere. Draco looked around the room with wide eyes and a huge grin. Harry supposed that he’d never had such a relaxed, casual Christmas.
“It’s okay,” he said with a grin, “it’s just the boggart. It kind of crashed into the wardrobe when I dealt with it. It’s the roller-skates, they’re never very coordinated.” He shook his head and rolled his eyes as he explained.
“Don’t worry – he’s being paid a handsome bonus for his efforts.” Harry said, and Kreacher bowed in the corner. Harry motioned to Kreacher’s agreement, and Hermione sighed. She bit her lip and huffed something under her breath. Harry left Ron and Hermione to wrap their presents in the living room. He made his way to his bedroom and sighed. He wanted to make it look good for when Draco came over but he was habitually messy – unlike his boyfriend. He started by changing the bedding and straightening the curtains around the four-poster frame. He cleared the desk of clutter and gave it a wipe down, and did the same to the bedside table that would be on Draco’s side of the bed. He shoved everything into the bottom of the wardrobe and looked around: it would do.
Harry looked slyly at him, “No hard feelings, Malfoy, but I’m not going easy on you.” He smirked, and Draco felt the butterflies return slightly.
He climbed into his bed, pulled his blankets over him and lay awake. He stared at the ceiling, musing over the day to come. He had three classes to teach, and with his spare time he would be in his office, he supposed, as always. He let his mind wander to the times when he used to go to The Three Broomsticks with Ron and Hermione and let himself entertain the idea of possibly going tomorrow. He looked over to the small bedside table next to him and opened the drawer. His faded marauders map sat there, fairly unused.
“Draco’s present,” Harry replied sheepishly, “I was actually going to ask you what you thought. I got the idea from you.”
Snow had piled up on either side of the paths creating little fences around the walkways; and the trees stood steadfast but bare against the bleak grey horizon. Harry pulled his cloak around him for warmth, and Draco pulled his hood up before they set off walking up to the castle.
Harry pulled the dark green bow off with ease and inspected one of the silver/purple vials inside. He held it up to the light and watched it shimmer, “What is it?” he asked again.
Harry winced slightly, perhaps Draco’s tone wasn’t as neutral as he had hoped, “Is there anything I can help with?” Harry asked.
“Speaking of your brother,” Draco piped up, “Will you let him know that those new silent footfall dragonhide boots that you both created for us Aurors are incredible,” he smiled briefly at Ron, “Under a disillusionment charm without them it’s so obvious where we are if we wear the regulation tread - they’re so damn heavy.” When Draco had started to speak, Harry had taken the glass of gin off the tray and drank it in one, Ron cast him a worried glance but said nothing.
“Malfoy, that’s ridiculous,” Harry went to stand next to Malfoy, and looked down at the letters, a closer look showed that there was indeed very little that the spells had revealed, “Wait…” Harry thought aloud, “What?”
“You look like someone who is out on the prowl,” the sultry bartender looked Harry up and down, seeing the look of surprise on Harry's face, he quickly added, “not that I’m allowed, of course, but there are some great people in tonight,” he gestured toward the dancefloor and smiled before he slinked off to serve someone else.
He ran to the door. Draco stood there in the snow in a heavy woollen cloak with a smart suitcase in his hand. His face lit up when he saw Harry answer. He ushered Draco in and left his case in the hallway. Before he closed the door, he noticed something strange – there was a lone sunflower blossoming through the snow in the hedgerow at the front Grimmauld Place. Draco hung his cloak over the rail, and ran a hand through his hair making sure that he looked okay. Harry had spent enough time around him to sense that he was nervous – he was after all about to enter a room full of people that knew him as a death eater.
Draco looked at her scowling, “It’s not been that long…” he looked around guiltily, “Has it?”
Harry took a deep breath and considered things for a moment, “Right,” he started still processing what he was opening himself up for, “I’ll give you ten minutes to ask me whatever you want about what I’ve done with regards to these spells, seeing as how you all seem so curious.” He said, and leaned back onto his desk.
Draco sat on his bed, still in his shirt from the night before with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow. It had only been Malfoy.
Suddenly Harry felt everything for Malfoy at once, from their childhood taunts, to their more recent trading of wits; it made him chuckle. He realised that not once has he been scared of Malfoy… but nervous? Nervous was a different emotion entirely. The haughty looks, the pale grey eyes, the competitions, the rivalry, the idea that their lives were destined to be opposites of each other. That made him nervous, the notion that they had been flirting around something bigger all of their lives.
“So how are you finding being back at Hogwarts?” Harry asked after some time, breaking Malfoys gaze from the window.
Draco held the box in front of him, and put it on the desk next to where Harry was perched, “I made this for you.” He said, plainly. He stood next to Harry, looking at him. He was desperate for Harry to like it.
“Are you all packed, Master?” he asked, a smirk on his face.
“Absolutely,” Draco replied, “I’ll see you soon.” He smiled at Harry – a genuine smile.
Harry nodded and put his other arm around Draco. Draco smirked down at Harry as they made eye contact. Harry took a shaky breath in, “When you get back,” he couldn’t stop looking at Draco’s lips, “I think that we should celebrate.” He smirked back at him, and brought one of his hands up to cup Draco’s face. Draco leaned into his hand, and kissed his palm.
Harry worked hard, probably harder than he’d ever bothered to before; feeling like he had to prove something to Draco. Part of him wanted Draco hooked on Harry. He wanted him to need more.
Draco growled, and within a split second, brought his lips crashing onto Harry’s. They stopped moving, lost in the power of what was happening. Dracos hands caressed and squeezed every possible place on Harry's body, the desperation seeping from both of them. Their breathing sped up, the world slowed down, and the momentous fact that Harry was kissing Draco Malfoy suddenly felt like the most natural climax of their tumultuous relationship.
” he raised an eyebrow suggestively and Draco sighed at the suggestion. There had always been tension between them but he could never bring himself to cross the boundary; Blaise was one of his closest friends after all, and he didn't want to risk losing yet another one after so long.
“Which room are we in this time?” Ron asked, and picked up the rest of their bags, “Blimey, ‘Mione, what’s in these?” he asked her when he felt the weight of them.
“I’m alright, it’s good to see you out and about. I was worried because I’ve not seen you in a few days.” Draco responded, not wanting to seem like he had been thinking about Potter too much.
As Harry sat outside the front door, Draco returned pulling his trunk on its wheels, “Harry,” he laughed, “What are you doing?” He shook his head slightly at the view of Harry: he sat cross legged on the floor, with two pots of paint and two paintbrushes. His tongue was clamped between his teeth as he concentrated.
Draco sat in front of the burner in his room, wearing his thick flannel pyjamas, reading a complicated book on making one's own potions. It was late, almost too late to still be awake considering that it was mid week and had to teach in the following morning. His room was lit with what felt like hundreds of tiny candles charmed to float around, giving the room a warm and cozy feel. The dark green of his expensive blanket, and velvet curtains seemed to grow in intensity with the light. There was a bookcase next to his bed, mostly filled with potion books and vials of ingredients. It cast a menacing shadow over the corner of his room. A bottle of honey mead glistened on a shelf near his burner and he eyed it temptingly; it would make a wonderful nightcap. Without warning, his house elf appeared, out of the blue, in front of him.
Neville leaned in close to Harry, “I think you do,” he smiled, “I’m happy for you.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and put his cup onto his saucer clearly preparing to answer Harry, “I have a potions shop in Diagon Alley, and it’s doing quite well. I no longer have to be there all the time to make sure it’s alright, something that I’m sure my patrons are happy about. No one wants to hang around a former death eater,” he looked at Harry as Harry began to protest but carried on regardless, “and I saw the posting for here and couldn’t think of a single reason to not take it,” He took a sip of his tea and then carried on, “I had heard, of course, that you taught here now as well as Neville and I thought it might do me some good to be around familiar faces again.”
“It was legal when I did it. There was a war on, a lot of people did things that they wouldn’t usually do.” He answered with a shrug.
He came to an exquisitely wrapped present and wondered who it could be from. Draco cleared his throat sheepishly and the room hushed. Harry smiled, and inspected the present. It was a fairly hefty box, about the size of a thick book, and was wrapped in black and silver flecked paper. The bow was a startling red and green. Harry worked it off the wrapping paper, carefully, and flicked open the present. He was greeted with a heavy, wooden bound book. On the front of the book, there was an engraving of the Potters family crest, accented in red. Harry’s breath hitched as he realised what it was. On the back cover was the Malfoy family crest. He opened the book, and saw photographs of everybody he loved. They all moved, and were vividly coloured.
Harry bent down to look closer, “No… look,” he pointed to the very bottom of the letter, to a spot underneath the other colours, “the parchment has a very pale blue tinge to it now. Maybe it was done by a squib…” he said, humouring Malfoy a bit, “and the desaturation of the colour is because they’re surrounded by magic things in their day to day life but none of it is their own.”
“Thank you,” he said, surprised that he had been given a drink without asking for one from his faithful elf, “To what do I owe this pleasure, Kreacher?” He asked, folding the paper and putting it away before pouring himself a cup of tea.
“Sure, cheers mate.” Harry said. He made his way along the corridor and opened the curtains fully, it brought some life into the old house. He went downstairs. He enjoyed having more people in the house, it seemed to fill the void that he’d been experiencing for the last two weeks.
Now that someone was in the house nearly all the time, there wasn’t much cleaning that needed to be done to make it presentable. Ron and Hermione would be coming over later on in the day to help with getting bedrooms ready for everyone.
“Haven’t you been listening to anything I was saying?” he asked, his voice impatient.
“Now, before you ask,” he carried on, aware that he had been speaking for a while, “I destroyed the wand,” a groan of disappointment went through the class, “and I did not use these curses lightly,” he explained, “you really do have to have a strong enough desire to cast them. Now…” he said, “can I get back to teaching you please?” he added with a smile.
“I’m not supposed to--” the healer began, but Hermione interrupted her.
“I’ll see you then, don’t be late Malfoy.” Harry smiled and sauntered down the corridor in the general direction of his office.
Harry nodded, his face flushing and an excited smile breaching his face. He had missed Draco terribly over the Christmas break and he just couldn’t wait to see him again.
“Why are they being so good to me?” Draco sobbed, “All I ever did was hurt them and demean them and their family. Yet, they’re being wonderful to me. I do not deserve any of this.” He slumped onto the stairs with a sigh and held his head in his hands.
“Oh, okay then.” Draco seemed taken aback, he believed Harry’s jest.
He leaned his head into Draco's neck, surprised at how good he smelled, the expensive aftershave was intoxicating and made Harry groan aloud.
Harry smiled, and leaned towards Draco, his jaw brushing Draco’s messy hair, “It was better than you could have imagined.” Harry breathed. He felt a cool sensation over his stomach as Draco whispered a quiet
In one long movement, Draco took the entire length into his mouth, without a flinch, without complaint. He knelt, like some kind of fallen angel, fully at Harry's mercy. The things he wanted to do. Draco swallowed. Harry saw stars for a brief moment.
“Draco may or may not have asked me to take a few pictures of you here and there as well.” He admitted, and smiled mischievously with Draco.
Harry sighed, “Yes, it’s largely the same. Neville and Hannah Abbot got married a few years back and Hannah is the landlady at The Three Broomsticks now. Madam Puddifoot’s has gone, thank the lord, and it’s now a little café of some kind, I believe.” Malfoy nodded and looked out the window.
Harry caught his breath.
Harry glanced at the muggle watch he’d taken to wearing, and saw that it was 8:30 am. He’d have to ready his trunks to return to Hogwarts for the start of term tomorrow. Kreacher wandered out of the Kitchen and Harry could hear him opening curtains and cursing the dust under his breath.
“Don’t forget to put all the paperwork together and send it off to Robards.” Draco reminded him as he read something on the board.
Hogwarts was largely empty; a few teachers had trickled in and the Castle was being warmed through. Hagrid – now an old man – could be seen getting the castle ready for the swathes of students that would soon arrive on the steps, ready to learn.
Harry talks with Ron and Hermione, and Emergency Duty crops up again
Harry laughed scornfully, then took a deep breath, “She kissed me.” He glanced nervously at Draco – he was sure that Draco might let the mask slip for a second or two and show him how he really felt. He didn’t. The façade remained.
Harry half grinned, “I think we should consult with someone far smarter than we are.”
He heard voices in the hallway and shuffled through to see what was happening. Hermione and Ron had arrived early. Harry’s heart leapt. He had missed his friends dearly, and Christmas was the only time of the year when they weren’t allowed to be busy.
Harry loitered after the feast, greeting some of his existing students and asking after their summer. There was a particular group of friends that reminded him of himself, Ron and Hermione, and they were always lively enough to stop Harry’s worries that he could not fulfil his legacy as the one who finally finished Voldemort. He also greeted new students, something that he did every year, and let them ask him a few questions – just to create some form of rapport between himself and the new students. He let them see his scar, and told them some of the tamer stories about his time hunting horcruxes. He told them of the sunrise over the cliffs, and having campfires in the evening with his friends.
Harry had missed having someone to talk to in person every day and he realised just how lonely he had become.
“Potter.”
Harry took the drink and looked up at Draco, his eyes were full of concern and guilt. Harry wished that he hadn’t reacted like that, but was grateful that Draco had been there. He nodded at Draco, “Yeah, I’m alright. I’m just exhausted.”
“There’s just one thing that I’ve missed today,” Harry said; Hermione and Draco looked at him quizzically, and he smiled enthusiastically back at them, “Treacle tart.”
Harry looked around the room briefly, he was indeed still at Hogwarts. His nightmares didn’t usually affect him here.
Hope you enjoy <3
Harry had somehow convinced Ron to come to a muggle club with the lure of not having to think about work, and the absolute fact that none of their coworkers would be there. Dance music pulsed throughout the club as they waited for their drinks. Harry had intended to get as drunk as possible, work had been hell during the week, but it was Saturday night. Party night. He didn’t have to think about magic, cover stories, or wizarding media pestering him for some kind of interview while he was half cut. The last time that had happened he had got himself into a spot of bother with the journalist and ended up on the front page - not a proud moment.
Harry cleared his throat, “How’s the shop, Ron?” He asked, breaking Ron’s awkward gaze from Malfoy.
“Potter, I know that we’re all good and everything now… but please. I can’t wear this.” He shook his head and put the jumper on Harry’s side of the bed. Harry took off his dressing gown, threw it at Draco and wore the jumper himself.
think?” Harry did a clumsy kind of twirl, losing his footing part way through.
Harry grew hungry for Draco’s touch; their moments separation felt like an eternity to Harry. He took Draco’s hands and pushed them onto the pillows. Draco broke the kiss, and looked at Harry with a flirty smile. His eyes were full of desire and it sent shivers all over Harry’s body. He pushed harder onto Draco’s hands and sat on top of him, straddling Draco’s long body.
“Because you forfeited more of the dares than I did,” Draco grinned, “and because I am refined and used to drinking excessive amounts of liquor.” Sarcasm dripped from him and Harry laughed. Draco? Refined? Sure.
Harry returned to his bedroom, the room that had been Sirius’ many years ago, and saw that Kreacher had anticipated his desire to pack his trunks himself for they sat near the wardrobe open and empty. Harry managed a smile, his return to Hogwarts, even after so many years always felt like a return home – Grimmauld place was simply his weekend house, he felt.
Draco came up to him, his thick cloak moving stiffly around him, “Hey you,” he smiled, and planted a chaste kiss on Harry’s cheek, “Everything okay?” he asked. Draco carried a small pack of books under his arm, clearly ready to mark, and his face was slightly flushed – he must have come straight from a class.
The new potions master, it would seem, had had some kind of obligation to see to and so could not make it for the first feast of the year. It was assured, however, that they would be arriving soon.
The Three Broomsticks was fairly quiet, as Harry had suspected. That didn’t stop the patrons from turning to stare at Harry and Malfoy though. The stares lasted for mere seconds before people turned back to what they were doing. The Three Brooms hadn’t changed at all. The oak beamed aisled roof still gave the building a warm, welcoming atmosphere that always made Harry feel at home. Walking back here made Harry feel like he had never left; like he could walk over to what had been his regular table and see Ron and Hermione pouring over N.E.W.Ts revision or Hagrid drinking butterbeer with the professors. Alas, that was not the case. Neville and Hannah were behind the bar now, Neville had his hand around Hannah’s waist while she arranged the glasses on the side - the very picture of domesticity and happiness.
Harry took a deep breath and then plunged into opening the rest of his presents: A batch of Quidditch gear from Ron and Hermione (no doubt to match Ginny’s present); A book on the history off the Dark Arts from Hermione (she said she couldn’t resist); A supply of products from Weasleys Wizard Wheezes from George, in case he ever wanted to get out of class even though he was the teacher; and a gift card for Madam Malkin’s.
Neville looked up at Harry from his leaning post on his shoulder, and smiled sleepily, “I think I should go home, Harry,” he started to chuckle, “I need to sleep this off.”
Draco approached her, with a smile on his face, he stretched out his hand and she took it, “Miss Granger, Hello.”
after all…” he batted his eyes and sighed.
Draco nodded, “I mean, I did say so, Scarhead.”
Morning all! What would a Drarry fic be without some angst?
“Do you have plans today?” Harry’s voice drew him out of his thoughts.
“Yeah, not bad,” Harry replied, and stole a look at Draco, “Work has been a bit shit, but you know, that’s expected.” He took a sip of his drink, grimacing slightly at the taste - this clearly something new that Blaise was trying and it wasn’t palatable.
He stood, stark naked, in the bathroom and stretched every muscle he could. He ached from being anchored to his desk, this paper-based case was killing him, he was sure. He knew that that would soon end when he began training for the inter-departmental quidditch match. He looked at his reflection in the mirror and pulled his hair from his hair tie. It hung past his shoulders, and fell in tangled curls; a short beard now graced his jaw and he couldn’t help but see the echoes of Sirius in his reflection. Sometimes when he looked at himself, he could forget the things that he had been through as a teenager; other times he thought that no change to his appearance would ever be able to mask it. No matter how hard he tried, he still had a few lines creeping around his eyes even though he was only 23.
Draco looked Harry dead in the eyes and just decided that he would tell him everything.
Nancy raised an eyebrow and dipped her hand into the pocket on her apron, “A letter came for you today from the Ministry. I was going to forward it on to you at Hogwarts, but as you’re here I may as well give it to you now.” She handed Draco the letter and went back down the stairs, sighing as she went.
“You know, Harry, I rather enjoy it.” Neville smiled. They laughed for a moment or two before Neville went off to serve someone else. Harry realised with a sigh just how long it had been since he had been intimate with someone.
They both made a quick flight around the perimeter of the pitch, looking for the snitch as they did. Draco thought he spotted it, but couldn’t be sure. With almost no warning, Harry turned sharply to his left and dived at the floor picking up a great deal of speed. Draco, while appreciating Harry’s performance, recognised a feint when he saw one. He remained where he was and cast his eyes over the pitch. The trick to finding the snitch in his experience was not to look for it directly, but let your peripheral vision do the work for you. Harry, realising that his feint had not worked, flew around the pitch slower, searching for the winged ball. Draco did the same.
Draco climbed on top of Harry, straddling him without a care in the world. Harry couldn’t help but watch as Malofy began to grind down on him, sending sparks through his entire body. Draco smiled, then leaned down to kiss Harry as he rode him.
The air was quiet, it must have been near 4am, and London was finally starting to quieten down. There were few sounds but the spark of the lighter and the occasional draws on the cigarettes. Neither felt the need to speak, either for fear of making everything awkward, or out of the desire to not break the spell that now surrounded them. It was peaceful, the only peaceful time they had ever spent together.
“Mr Malfoy, sir,” she gasped, clearly breathless, and wide-eyed, “It’s Mr Potter.”
When Draco broke the kiss, Harry rested his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, “Thank you, so very much, dear Draco.” Harry whispered in his ear, and kissed his cheek.
Ursula piped up again, “The Imperius curse, sir.”
An awkward smile saw its way up to Draco’s lips, “What?” he asked, not entirely sure what Harry had said. He didn’t know what to think.
As Harry and Draco wondered down the stairs, hand in hand, they could hear the chatter and rattling of everybody making Christmas dinner – maybe they’d slept in longer than anticipated. Draco gasped when they entered the kitchen, to see everybody in their assorted pyjamas and lounge clothes doing their part to make sure that there was a veritable feast for dinner - everybody but Kreacher – who had the day off and so rested with his feet perched on a foot stool in front of the fire.
“Investigatory spells?” Harry asked as he walked past and plonked down in his chair.
There seemed to be a unanimous agreement that that is what they wanted. The classroom seemed to be excited once more.
“Everyone gets a little lonely but that’s what friends are for.” Draco remarked. He poured some tea into the china tea set and passed Harry a cup. Harry cradled it, despite the fire and the heavy furnishings there was still a cold atmosphere from being so close to the dungeons.
Morning all! I hope you're all doing well, and enjoying the fic so far! I'm already working on my next Drarry fic because apparently I'm a glutton for punishment xD
There was a whoosh of green flame as the Weasleys started to arrive through the floo network. Molly and George arrived first, their arms full of presents. Ron took the presents and bags from Molly and he and his brother went through to the living room. Molly scooped up Harry into a mothering hug and planted a kiss on his cheek. With a burst of green flame, Ginny and Arthur arrived, with more presents in their arms. They put their cargo onto the table and everyone greeted each other. Arthur shook Harry’s hand and Ginny pulled him in for a hug. Ron and George joked with Kreacher about something at the other end of the room and Molly and Hermione started talking about Christmas dinner. There was a knock at the front door and Kreacher lead Neville and Hannah into the kitchen. Hannah and Ginny embraced and chatted quietly at the table. Neville shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically and Harry took yet more presents into the living room. Ron showed Hannah and Neville into their room and bounded back down the stairs.
“Oi,” Harry said when he came through the door but Draco ignored him, “Oi, git…” he said louder, “Coffee.” he shoved a chipped mug into Draco's hand and sat on the edge of his own desk.
Hermione turned to Harry and Draco, “Did you have a good Christmas?” she asked them. She stroked Ron’s messy ginger hair and cuddled into him.
Harrys head shot up when he heard his name. It was so unusual for Malfoy to call him by his first name.
Hermione shot Harry a glance, despite her work to make things better for house elves she didn’t like people making them do things.
“That’s precisely the thing,” he looked down at Harry with a confused look, “there’s literally nothing for them to show.”
Draco nodded and Harry took his hand from Draco’s shoulder. He checked the time, “We’ve got time for breakfast, do you want to eat in the Hall today, Potter?”
could do it.” he suggested and took a sip of his drink. The coffee at the ministry was really disgusting, but after a while he imagined you’d get used to it.
“Wasn’t so hard was it?” Harry said nonchalantly.
Harry raised an eyebrow in shock and couldn’t quite figure out what to say.
Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder as he thought about how to make social conversation with Draco, and so he turned to face them: it was the blonde dancer. When he approached, Harry became certain that he was part Veela, there was an aura around him that was mesmerising even when he wasn’t dancing.
Eventually, at around 1pm, dinner was ready. Harry and Molly lay the table in the big formal dining room, and everyone took their seats. Hermione had clearly decorated the room, as garlands and boughs of Holly hung from every possible surface. Harry and Molly served, and then lay the pots and plates full of the rest of the food in the middle of the table around the various centrepieces and candles.
that you need to sort out.”
Morning all! I have a full week off work, so expect regular chapter updates! <3
Draco and Harry talk over dinner...
“Have you finished?” Harry nodded to the cup of tea and nearly extinguished cigarette, hoping that he wasn’t about to be kicked out, despite the earlier implications. The whole situation felt surreal, but calming, and he didn’t want to return to the chaos that was Harry Potter’s hectic life just yet.
He walked back to his room contemplating just one thing: that had definitely been flirting.
“Who shall we start with?” Ginny asked, surveying the brightly wrapped presents to pass out to everyone.
With a groan, Harry unlocked the wards over the door, certain of where the date would end. He loved it when Draco took control.
Draco smiled to himself, he felt confident enough to go into Public when Potter was around - nobody would mess with the man who defeated Voldemort, “Want me to come with you?”
Neville looked sheepishly at Draco as he re-filled his empty tea cup, “Actually, Harry did speak to me. I’m positive that it was out of kindness though, he only wanted to help.”
“Yes, headmistress?” Draco said, his voice feigning innocence.
“Now,” Harry said softly, “compose yourself, because we’ve got presents to open and then we have a whole lot of Treacle Tart to eat.” He added with a chuckle.
Harry goes back to work... what will happen?
Harry took a deep breath, then shivered slightly from being so exposed in the large room, “I think we’ve missed the feast.” He shot Draco an amused look and Draco laughed.
“Was it really that different?” Draco asked.
Malfoy paced their shared office in his aurors robes and crossed his arms angrily as he watched the casefile flop to the floor. He glared at Harry, clenching his teeth. Malfoy strode over to the evidence wall and sighed loudly, obnoxiously.
“Slightly?!” Ron lifted his head from Hermione’s lap and huffed. Hermione put a hand on his chest and he laid back down. She continued to stroke his hair, shaking her head at Harry in a silent cry to give the conversation up.
Harry settled his tab, and the sultry bartender strode over, “nothing here for you eh?” he smiled knowingly, “glad you sorted out that ‘complicated’ relationship,”
They begin their research into past Hogwarts students - will there be any breaks?
anything.
With all the consent he needed, Harry began relieving himself in Draco’s mouth. It felt like nothing else, no-one else, that Harry had experienced; maybe because it was Malfoy, maybe because it was simply exquisite. Draco's mouth relaxed, he simply let Harry use him. Harry couldn’t help but watch. Draco looked like everything he had ever fantasised about: covered in spit, tears pricking his devious eyes, and the delightful sound of a throat being used. Harry had to stop, for fear of cutting the whole process too short. Draco stood, and looked right into Harry's eyes, before taking his hand and leading him into the bedroom.
When they reached the door of the Three Broomsticks, they hesitated. How busy would it be? Would they be harassed by people, or would everyone be fine? With bated breath, Draco pushed open the door.
Draco turned slowly, and Harry looked at every inch of his body. His pale skin seemed to glow in the twilight, it made Harry crazy how something could be so appealing. His body was somehow soft, hard, curved and yet angular all at the same time. At any other time, it would have perplexed Harry, but right now it just turned him on even more. Harry watched as Draco’s arm moved, meaning that he too was touching himself.
Draco glanced at him, “God, Potter, you look positively radiant,” he said quietly under his breath, “people will definitely talk: what’s got the reclusive Chosen One to be so coy?” He smirked.
She led Ron by the arm and sat on a chair in the corridor. Ron had gone incredibly quiet, and Hermione knew that this was how his worry manifested itself, “he's got to be okay, ‘mione. He just has to be,” he whispered, “I couldn't take it if we lost him.”
Malfoy smiled, “Hannah wouldn’t let me bring just two glasses up,” he chuckled to himself, “Must have an agenda of some sort.” He put the tray on the table in the middle of the chairs, and pulled a red and gold cushion off the remaining armchair. He looked at it, smiled, and threw it at Harry who caught it and sat with it on his lap.
“It sounds like jealousy,” Harry said quietly once Draco had finished, “It really does.”
He felt Draco slip a hand under his boxers and he slid them off. Harry felt exposed, but he liked it. He felt Draco’s hot, shaky breath on his thighs, and a soft kiss on his hip. He held his breath as all of a sudden Draco took him entirely into his mouth.
She shook her head in pity and laughed, “I think you’ll do just fine. Honestly though, how have you not decorated for Christmas yet?”
Hope you're all still enjoying the ride - it did get a tad bumpy xx
Draco works in seclusion. Harry's predicament develops...
Sorry that this chapter is a few days late, I've been bedridden with some kind of virus (not that one - no need to worry) and the movement from bed to PC was just too much. Fear not - I'm on the mend and here is a chapter for you all <3
“Right?” Harry asked, still not entirely sure what was going on.
“Potter,” she said, “Malfoy.” They froze on the spot – fairly sure that they were in third year again and that they were headed to detention.
The shower ran hot behind him, filling the room with steam. He stepped in and let the hot water run over his muscles. The relief was immeasurable and a sigh escaped his lips. With a vague gesture of his hand, he made the wizarding radio come to life and quiet music filled the steamy room. A gentle but throbbing guitar echoed throughout the tiled bathroom and took the edge off the tension that Harry felt in his shoulders.
“Sorry,” he said, his voice sore from the screaming, “How did you find me?” His green eyes were weary and wild, and his face was drawn, exhausted.
Ron had done one of the other spare rooms when Harry came out of his room, “Harry, you’ve got a boggart in Mum and Dads room – want me to take care of it?” He asked, a slight grin on his face.
Malfoy walked over to Harry’s desk and leaned against it. He was wearing the same heavy, expensive looking cloak as yesterday, with the charmed snake, and a sharp black and Slytherin green checked suit underneath. He sighed softly and looked at Harry putting the books back individually.
“Thank you, Neville,” Harry replied, knowing that Neville knew he would probably not take him up on the offer, “I’ll think about it.” He guessed that he had become somewhat of a recluse, worried constantly about the hordes of wizards and witches that flocked to him in the street. His only relief was often to go out into the muggle world where no one knew who he was. He had some muggle friends, of course, who believed that he was a history teacher at some obscure boarding school in Scotland.
“I don’t know what you did, or what you said, but thank you.” he extended his hand and Draco shook it, almost giddy with happiness because the people that he had spent so long wanting to be like seemed now to accept him.
“Neville,” Draco caught his attention by tapping his shoulder, as he was talking away to the History of Magic teacher, someone that Draco was unfamiliar with. Neville turned to look at him, “Would you just try and get Potter to stop hiding away slightly?”
“Mine’s closer,” Draco replied, he was still breathless, still wanting Harry more than he could comprehend.
Harry threw Dracos legs apart, still kissing him, and worked his way down his chest, stomach, all the way to his thighs. He took Draco in his mouth, doing his best to get it all the way to his throat. Dracos breath hitched, making Harry smile.
Draco bolt upright, his shoulders back, and took a deep breath, “You can screw your treacle tart.” he said with a smirk, and Harry smiled at him with a raised eyebrow: the composure was back on.
Harry knew what Draco couldn’t say, and revelled in the satisfaction it gave him that Draco was coming undone under his touch. He felt Draco clench around him, his entire body seizing up. Harry smiled, willing himself to let go.
It took a second for Harry to register what had happened – he’d been having yet another nightmare and Draco must have been soothing him. He became supremely conscious of how sweaty and naked he was, and how fast his heart was racing. The adrenaline calmed, and he sat back on his bed with a sigh – not only was he drained from his nightmare, he was also hung over. He dropped his wand on the bedside table with a clatter and ran his hands through his unruly hair.
Draco whispered a cleaning spell and the cool caress of the magic skimmed over their hot skin. He removed himself from Harry and stood upright, stretching his arms. Harry sat on the edge of the desk, and with a swift reach of his arm he pulled Draco to him. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s slender waist and kissed his soft, hot skin. Draco sighed contentedly and smiled to himself.
Harry sat, shocked at what was being revealed to him, on Draco’s chaise longue, as Draco poured his heart out. The fire crackled intensely and Draco had charmed candles to float around the room as he often did. The heavy plush velvet curtains were drawn over the window and the rich furnishings were decadent but comfortable. Harry felt at home in this room – as extravagant and gothic as it was. He focused on the room for a moment and made sure that he was paying proper attention to Draco for his face was twisted into a painful expression and his hands wrung in front of him.
Draco hummed into the kiss, “you’re so good, Harry…”
“Back to work Alex,” he hissed, “Or I’ll tell Blaise that you’re breaking the rules again.” he threatened with a menacing glare.
He moved to his desk and pulled out some parchment, ready to write to Hermione.
“Well, yes, I think we have,” He stroked Harry’s back with one hand and caressed his neck with the other, “Luckily for you though, we do have a kitchen of our own at the house.”
I hope you enjoy this instalment of what was once a oneshot xD Nothing explicit happens in this chapter, which I know is shocking, but I promise there will be more to come <3
“Malfoy.”
“Shut up, Potter.” Malfoy spat across the office, throwing the casefile at his partner.
All of a sudden, it was like Harry’s body had never danced before in his life. He just stood there, the weight of what was happening prevented him from moving. Draco, however, was practiced in the art of getting a reaction from Harry. He pulled him closer, his hand on the small of Harry's back, and began to move to the music that was playing.
With a wave of his wand he selected his clothes for the day. He decided on yet another bespoke  tailored suit: a rich, black wool, three piece suit, with a special pocket made for his wand. He decided on his Slytherin green cloak, which was lined with black fur. Since his own business had done so well, Draco enjoyed the finer things in life - he had after all worked hard for it. After getting dressed, he stroked the fur of his cloak appreciating its quality, and set about walking to the great hall for breakfast.
“I like it,” Harry said, his voice already sleepy, “It reminds me of the Gryffindor common room,” he leant forwards and picked up a glass of firewhiskey, “maybe that’s why you don’t like it all that much - you’re used to the cold dungeons.” He mirrored Malfoys remark from earlier and smiled.
Draco sat in Pansy’s living room, his feet perched on a plush leather footstool, “I really can’t believe that he didn’t just mock me. He’s been in a weird mood all day, Pans.”
“Draco…” he started, “I’m not – well, I’m not gay.” Harry stuttered, hoping that whatever was going to happen didn’t ruin everything.
It could only be Draco.
Harry nodded, “I can do that,” he looked up at Draco, stroking his chest with his free hand, “this does feel good.”
“I wanted to,” Draco mumbled, “I just want to help my friend.”
though, I usually just repress the hell out of everything.”
“Eighth year was good though; it was as close to normal life that Hogwarts ever got, I think.” Ron reminisced with a nostalgic smile on his face. He clearly addressed Draco.
Harry sat in the larger of the two chairs, letting the soft cushions envelop him for a bit. His heart was racing, he was petrified that he would be harassed by people, or that people would surround him in an instant. He concentrated his eyes on the stags head above the fireplace and wondered to himself if he thought that it was offensive. Did it upset him that that was the mortal version of his patronus? Of his dad? Was it something that he should feel something about? He wasn’t sure. Malfoy returned with a tray, glasses of firewhiskey filled it, as well as two glasses of butterbeer. His heart calmed a bit when Malfoy entered the room, he had become something of a reassuring presence for Harry.
“It’s no bother, Master,” Kreacher responded quietly, “I was readying myself to wake you anyway.”
“There we go,” Draco drawled, “that’s much better,” his hand began stroking Harry's lower back, relaxing into having him in his arms.
“I’ve not been back to Hogsmeade since we were students,” Malfoy mused, “Is it largely the same?”
“Oh, well I think we should start with Harry,” Molly said, “It’s his house after all.” She smiled a motherly smile at Harry. Ginny started to pile presents in front of him.
He knocked on Draco’s door, still gazing around and eating his apple.
Harry looked at the students, and was eager to not demonstrate the curses straight away for his sake and theirs. “Let’s talk briefly about the history of these curses - why are they unforgivable?” Harry asked the class. The students looked to each other nervously, a few whispers could be just heard, and then a tentative hand was raised by a Slytherin student at the back.
“I guess she approves.” Draco smiled as they made their way back to Harry’s room for the night, his hand around Harry’s waist.
Malfoy slumped down into his desk chair and glared at Harry. He shot a cursory glance around the room before sighing loudly once more, “Fine,” he rolled his eyes, and levitated some of the paperwork towards his own desk, “I’ll do this,” he grimaced as the paperwork landed with a dull thud on his desk, “but then we’re looking at this new case.”
… things.” Draco hesitated. He was feeling things, but what things he wasn’t entirely sure.
“Have you even
I really hope you're enjoying the fic so far! As usual leave some love below <3
Harry, with no warning to Draco, planted a kiss on Draco’s lips and held him tightly, uncaring that everyone could see. Neville, Molly, and Hannah laughed loudly, George threw a cushion at them as the kiss deepened, and Arthur clapped his hands.
“No hard feelings, eh, Draco?” Harry smiled.
Harry frowned, “Malfoy, I’ve not worn glasses in ages,” Ron looked at Harry, clearly amused that it took Draco so long to realise, “I stopped wearing them in like, September.”
Harry is awarded a medal... someone shows their face
Harry nodded and held onto Draco's hand, ready for the pull of a sidealong to whisk him away.
Harry came upstairs behind Draco and wrapped his arm around his waist, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, “Will it do, do you think?”
Harry watched, mouth hanging open, as he tried to unpack all of this information. Draco Malfoy was using a muggle phone and his son, a virtual smaller version of Malfoy, was jealous. Not to mention Malfoy was writing for muggle newspapers as well as the Prophet. Trying to come up with any solution to what was going on, Harry smiled at Scorpius, “That’s too bad, I find them quite useful too,” Harry continued, hoping to find out about Malfoy’s elusive wife, “So, your mother. Is she a healer?”
“No,” Aviary said firmly, holding onto Harry’s arm, “We can’t think like that. Not now. Draco knows what he is doing. I have the feeling he always does. He will be fine.”
“I didn’t want him to have you. I thought I did, at first. But then I realized you were our hope. You were good in a world where nothing felt good anymore. So I couldn’t let him have you,” Draco said all of this to a space behind Harry on the wall.
“Don’t give me any of that “we will always love you” garbage,” James snapped.
Harry shook his head in horror, “That’s despicable!”
Harry gave another long sigh and was about to take a bite of his sandwich when he felt a hard tap on his shoulder. He turned around, wondering if Dean would have the same break time as him after all, when he saw Seb, the patient he had helped a couple of weeks ago who had had dragon pox. Now, however, he had no trace of the green that had once plagued his skin. His skin was sun kissed and smooth, working perfectly with his extremely blonde hair and coffee-brown eyes. Harry’s heart did a weird jolt that he jotted down to surprise- he had never seen Seb without Dragon Pox, he was merely relieved at the bloke’s recovery.
“No way!” Dean exclaimed, “That’s why you’re in a bad mood! Reyes must be the worst patient.”
“Of course, Arthur,” Angelina reassured, “I’ve seen to it myself. Even if the attacks haven’t been in Diagon Alley recently, it doesn’t mean they won’t happen again.”
“You know it. That one time he sent the bludger into the stands and hit Gonga’s wife? Priceless,” Draco joked. Harry watched the two laugh easily with each other. And Draco was at the match. Harry hadn’t even known about it, and there was no way Ginny hadn’t been there playing. She hadn’t even mentioned Blaise and Aries landing themselves in the hospital. But here was Draco, invited to Blaise’s match and spending the night by his side after his injury. The implications made Harry’s head spin.
“Daddy!” Lily shouted, running towards him and wrapping herself around him.
“Ron,” Ginny said from his side, but he cut her off.
Harry laughed at this and pointed at the book still across Seb’s lab. “‘Quidditch Through the Ages’?” he asked, “That is perhaps still one of my favorite books to read. I used to read it all the time during the summer while I was missing Hogwarts.”
“Weeks?” Draco said, as much of the table broke out in surprised chatter, “And you didn’t think to tell your best friend?”
Seamus looked thrilled at this question, “Oh, it has been complete chaos! But we wouldn’t have it any other way! I’ve been put in charge of permits which, trust me, is hell on earth. Blaise has been working around the clock to secure a solid venue…”
As they appeared in the canteen, Draco turned furiously towards Harry, “What was that for? I’m the only one who knows exactly how to control the seizures! I need to be at the match!”
