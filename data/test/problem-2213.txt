By the time Potter's voice reaches her ears, her hands are trembling badly. He is staring at her, his soup only half finished.
Lucius nodded and the girl smiled brightly " Thank you Mr. Malfoy. Have a nice time. "
She doesn't think that Harry would let her life be over just like that.
She took a deep breath when she finally reached the huge door of the great hall. The guards bowed and she nodded before pushing the door open.
"Two people are eating out of our dustbin. They seem ill," the eleven year old boy said, distraught. He was dressed in blue jeans and a cream T-shirt today. He was looking adorable. They had come a long way. Harry was sixteen when Albus was born. The battle had just finished and a few days later, Ginny had told him about the pregnancy. She was two months pregnant at that time and had hidden it well until the war but after the war was over, she had told him clearly that she would not raise Albus and she was only giving birth to him because Harry was gay and that was likely the only opportunity he would ever get to have his own child.
The clock ticked and seconds passed and Draco could do nothing except stare at his dying husband.
He retracts his fangs and heads towards the fireplace after closing the door with a soft click.
"Impedimenta."
His eyes are really serious but not bitter.
"You're more then your dad's son. You're a determined, ambitious man who doesn't have an ounce of arrogance in him despite being the best and youngest seeker ever. I've always known that. It's time you accept it too." Scorpius murmurs gently.
He whirls around, arranges his folder in his hands and walks inside the castle and straight towards Potter's office.
Father was as adamant as ever "I had
"What?" Scorpius asks, confused.
"She might be pregnant Harry, pregnant with Lord Voldemort's child." She says after a couple of minutes pass and Harry stares at her, his eyes wide.
Draco's mouth fell open in shock, though he recovered quite quickly to scream "Protego."
"No need. I want to talk to
He knows that Snape means well. It took time to adjust with the man but Harry understands Snape now. Snape has always meant well. The man has lost and sacrificed a lot. Harry knows that Snape loved his mother and he still does. No-one could understand Harry better than Snape right now and Snape might not say this but his eyes do.
"Harry, please. Be quiet." It was Narcissa who said this and Harry looked at before turning back to Lucius and continuing in a hard voice, "You are lucky that you have Draco as a son. He accomplished everything he wished. If you have any shame, you will come inside with your wife in fifteen minutes and talk to him. Why were you not here as soon as you got the news of this incident. Where were you? Everyone arrived except both of you and Sirius."
Harry shoots up and sits straight, his back stiff before asking, "Is Draco with them?"
Sirius rolls his eyes before interrupting his husband of two years, "I'm not talking about maiming your old friend. I don't think he would hurt a child for wanting to visit his peacocks and gardens. I should have known this would happen. Harry saw those moving pictures in the daily Prophet."
Draco was breathing normally now and he started stroking Draco's spine and complete back. He trailed his hand from Draco's neck to spine to hips and finally after about fifteen minutes, Draco stopped crying.
Dudley opened his mouth and then closed it again.
"Come. I'll drop you home." Harry stood up, stumbled and fell down and then got up again.
Lucius breathed and lifted a hand to stop Remus and then stared back at the fire.
She shrugs wordlessly, her face blank.
Harry resolved to leave alcohol altogether. He resolved to show Draco that he was not dependent on him. How could the man be so bloody adamant?
Draco looked at him, his eyes startled and Harry took another long breath. He was not a teenager. He should have had a better control over his hormones. Draco trusted him. It was difficult to say this but he had to. He had brought this upon himself.
Harry stays quiet. He wants Draco to answer so he waits.
"He is breathing. Harry. He is alive. HARRY." Ron shouted and finally Harry opened his eyes. He blinked twice before his eyes lay on Draco again. Hermione had laid his body on the bed and she was sitting in front of Harry, with Ron trying to make him listen.
"I don't love you." He says so that Ginny knows what she is agreeing to that is if she
The POP of apparition prevented Harry from saying anything and he nudged Harry so that they could get settled on the couch. Harry sat on the couch and Draco sat down between Harry's legs. Harry stroked his hair and it was utter bliss. This was what he had always wanted, an evening with Harry. The equation was missing someone and he wanted to talk to Harry about that.
Draco nodded and Harry continued "Do you want to go today?" Draco shrugged in response, choosing not to say anything.
It was no where near enough but it was all he could allow himself to do now. With Draco's hand in his, he fell asleep.
Somehow, he controlled his temper and levitated Harry's wheelchair on the stairs and into Harry's room. His room was even messier.
Draco's eyes softened when he heard Harry's words and he uncrossed his arms, resting them on his side instead.
"He hasn't moved on. You know he hasn't." Harry cut her off again, "He just won't forgive me. He refuses to talk to me. I love him, Hermione. I can't move on. He didn't send the divorce papers."
"Aren't you going to school?" she asked.
He tried to bury his desire for their kids and he tried to forget his need for Harry's love and for the most part he was successful. His efforts got ruined on the fifth day, though. The thoughts that he had tired to bury deep inside his mind came to the forefront and everything went to hell.
"I'll tell you later." He answers and Draco begins his lecture.
Ten minutes later when their food has come and Scorpius takes a sip of water, James says casually, "Aunt Hermione said that the time turner is ready."
"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Zabini." Scorpius greets them politely.
Yet Harry can see that she is being brave. She is breathing. She hasn't tried to kill herself. She is letting Harry help her.
He shook his head slowly before answering, "Not yet, Ms-"
Harry was so glad that Lucius had taken this step. He was astonished because it must have taken a lot of strength to do this. He dragged Draco, murmuring "You still have your parents Draco and they love you. You must not waste this opportunity. They want to help you and you must take their help."
"Butter, jam or nutella?" Harry yelled again and Draco replied in an irritated tone "Bring everything. Just come back, will you?"
It was nice to have Draco beside him. Harry craved so much for Draco that he would fall a thousand times if it meant that Draco would sit with him. He did what he wanted and turned towards Draco and looked at him.
"Tea or coffee?" Harry yelled and Draco replied "Tea."
Both Draco and Hermione turned completely blank. Draco was holding his hands too tightly and looking at the opposite wall and Hermione was wearing an utterly sad expression.
She wondered. Maybe, Maria hadn't come yet.
love Potter. Potter is just so easy and naive. Draco needs Potter's protection to get his family out of this mess father has got them into.
After a few moments, James sighs and turns his face back towards Scorpius. People often say that Albus's eyes are exactly like Mr. Potter's. However, where Mr. Potter's and James's eyes are emerald green, Albus's eyes are a darker shade of green.
He remembered the day when he had accused Draco of doing nothing except sitting on his ass all day at home. He had been utterly foolish and had not noticed Draco's depression at all.
"Listen, I know that Harry is your official partner for this case. But, as I don't have any partner and won't have any case until Harry returns, I would like to help you too."
Tears trickled down his cheeks when Draco still did not open his eyes. He stopped shaking the man's chest and just stared at him.
"Headmaster," she said.
He might have to visit his godparents again though because he's almost sure that they were hiding something from them.
His eyes were gleaming and Draco knew that he still wasn't telling him everything. He wanted Potter to be his partner. But why?
But Revenge would come later. Draco's well being was his priority.
Harry stopped just after closing the gate. Albus didn't. He continued walking towards the door of his house, Malfoy leaning on him.
Penelope was looking at the camera which was why she didn't notice how Potter tried to stop Percy's hand from wandering, how she tried to pull away.
"So there is really no point of this fight. She doesn't have what you wanted. We could join hands and -"
Albus breathes hard. He is annoyed and frustrated. The thing is- the thing is that he wants to see more of younger Draco Malfoy. Albus is a bit obsessed with the man. He's been in love with him ever since he was fifteen. Draco used to come to deliver a special lecture every week at Hogwarts. He was in fifth year at that time. Today, four years later, Albus has still not gotten over it. No body knows about it, not even Scorpius. Albus broke up with Scorpius and didn't tell him the reason. He didn't want to lie but he didn't want to hurt Scorpius too.
"You will heal Draco. I will help you. Please, just give me a chance." Harry continued and to his horror, he realised that his shirt was wet from Harry's tears. Harry was crying and he knew that Harry despised crying as much as he did.
"I like their white peacocks and gardens. Pwease. Pretty pwease, uncle Sirius."
"I have been trying to explain this to you since morning Draco that what I did was wrong. I should have backed off when you said no-"
Harry closed his eyes and pulled away. Draco did not trust him. He did not trust him at all. If he had trusted Harry, he would have told him everything. But Draco decided to keep everything hidden. He walked towards the table sat on it. Draco followed him and sat beside him.
"Go to sleep. Granger had told me that you need to sleep. I am calling Kreacher over here. He will help us." Draco said and called "Kreacher."
Had it been minutes or seconds or hours since Harry had fallen. The time did not matter. Nothing mattered other than the fact that life was slowly seeping out of Harry and Draco could do nothing except stare at his unconscious face.
No-body answered her that is no-body except Dumbledore who only muttered, "I wonder if you're right Mrs Longbottom."
Harry still stared and Dudley stayed still on his couch, not daring to break aunt's speech.
"You know how he gets when he is angry, Ron. We can't loose Malfoy. He wants Malfoy to be an example for-"
"Tessa has this look in her eyes at times." He said and Harry's fury flared and so did his magic. Their cups trembled and so did the windows. Their eyes met and Harry was the one who broke the silence "Why did you not owl me earlier? This is a delicate issue."
There had been several nights when he had not been able to sleep in the fear that the moment he closed his eyes, someone would barge inside or that someone might knock him unconscious just because they knew that he was a whore and they were his clients.
He had not known.
Harry did not defend himself because he wanted Draco to know that Hermione cared for him and that she was not his enemy. Hermione parted Draco's hips gently and turned white in just a couple of seconds. What happened was not unexpected. Hermione turned towards him with fury in her eyes. He had not seen her look like this ever since the battle.
With trembling fingers, he opened the letter and started reading it.
Albus jumps up before hurrying towards the door.
"I have taken your case, Mr. Potter." She said and walked towards him. Her face was very blank and Harry cleared his throat before saying softly, "I'm sorry."
"Hermione-" He started and she cut him off "I know that the way he glares at you has not escaped your notice. He is always angry at us."
"Stay away from me." Harry warns him.
"Potter." He hears a few moments later and closes his eyes in frustration.
Harry had not expected Draco to speak anything after that and he was surprised that Draco did.
Harry's angry eyes shot up to him and he nodded, his eyes flashing "I might burn it if you do not take it from my hands immediately."
." The presence retreats and Albus is left sweating with a trembling frame.
Ron was up in a second and so was Hermione.
He crossed his arms and tried to intimidate Black. He only stood in front of Draco with raised eyebrows. It must be Severus's influence. Draco gritted his teeth and started heading towards the exit.
Harry says, "Yes."
Is this victory... because Harry doesn't think that it is. Are they really free. Harry feels trapped in the never ending cycle of misery and pain.
"Draco. No. You can't." He said and as he had expected Draco cringed and jumped up so suddenly that Harry could just stare. His silver eyes held panic and Harry stood up slowly. There was no point in disturbing Draco's mind any more.
"But, why?" Fred spoke and George continued "What have we done?"
"Happy now. You can turn around if you want and become my teddy bear." Harry said before yawning again and Draco turned around to glare at him "I am not a teddy bear."
"Nor is Albus's obsession with you. Besides, Harry isn't like you."
He knew that he had to set up his potions shop and had to help Harry set up Duelling and Potions academy at the same time. Harry said that he won't do anything without Draco's help. But it felt that he did not have any strength to do anything.
"Potter." Draco mutters. Mother and Severus haven't left yet.
Draco's eyes were soft and Harry had just opened his mouth but Draco beat him to it "I know that you do not want to talk about Dursleys and that you are hiding some things from me about your childhood. You are not exactly very forgiving Harry. I don't think that you forgave your uncle easily for what he did." Harry could prevent his eyes from flashing angrily. He had never forgiven Vernon for what he had attempted to do. He had vowed vengeance against the bastard after having defeating Voldemort but then he had started searching for Draco and it had been postponed. Draco continued "I want to know everything and you can ask me anything you wish."
"You most certainly won't." The words were firmly spoken but didn't belong to uncle Severus who had in fact opened his mouth to say something akin to this. They belonged to her aunt Sierra. Mom was still crying. It was painful to watch. But, there was no time to console mother.
Petunia doesn't answer but then the door bell rings and she doesn't need to.
"My people, Hermione. My people!" Ron is gaping at her and Harry is really at a loss.
"Albus." Scorpius drawls slowly, "Do you plan to visit them or do you want to sit here and scowl at their door."
Petunia nods and the child smiles before getting up and kissing her cheeks.
But the child simply looks at the man and shakes his head, "Mom told me that she would say something like this. It's okay, uncle Severus. She's hurting."
"Please, this is not my fault. I did not choose to be a Veela."

"Follow me again and I will."
"Harry, did something happen?" Draco asked softly, trying to soften him. It did not work and harry stalked towards him, his eyes burning with fury and his steps hurried.
terrified of our dear headmaster." Draco finishes.
"Harry." Draco's soft voice reached him but he did not turn around. He just kept on gazing out. "Harry." Draco spoke again and this time, Harry heard something akin to desperation in his voice. Finally, he turned around and almost stumbled when he saw Draco's eyes. His eyes were shining and he was out of breath. It seemed that he had run all the way to his room. Something had changed and Harry wondered what it was.
"Harry, is everything fine?" Ginny asks. They're just outside the potions classroom. It's empty.
He is so alarmed by the revelation that she is hurting herself. Yet his mind can't help but be distracted by her soft skin. He shakes his head and looks at her.
All of a sudden, Harry felt all the fight leaving his body. He did not want to fight with Draco. He had been protecting himself against Vernon ever since he had been capable. But he had been a defenceless baby once and Vernon had attempted to violate him. Had he not had magic to defend himself, the monster would have succeeded. Many a time, Vernon's words haunted him.
"I need to check if you are fit for the lead role Ms. Malfoy." He lies.
"Incarcerous." Severus snarls and the dark lord slams on the wall, his hands and legs tied to either sides of his body.
"He used to come when I was sleeping."
He shook his head but the words won't leave.  Why did Harry have to remind him? The memories were hidden in his mind and he did not want to relive them again.
"They are sleeping in their rooms."
Severus is marking the assignments although his hands are quivering hard and his cheeks are burning from the fury that is coursing throughout his body. He doesn't understand what's wrong with these people. Haven't they just gone through the pain they are inflicting on those poor creatures. The man who created the barbaric law died ten years ago. The law to eradicate veelas was made during the first war.
"Chocolate frog," she said exasperatedly and the gargoyles shifted to let her in.
However, the man might simply refuse to help Albus if Albus doesn't answer. Dad has gone to France on some head auror business and will return after a week. This might be the only chance Albus has to view his memories. This also might be the only opportunity to ask around about Draco's memories too. Mr. Zabini is Draco's closest friend after Mrs. Parkinson-Nott who simply asked him to stay away from it.
"Do you think I am blind or perhaps you think I am dumb? I can clearly see that you are trying to please me with these things. Since when are you terrified that I would leave you?" Harry removed his plate and placed his hands on the table.
She forced her legs to move and headed towards the small rectangular table and sat adjacent to Vernon so that she could look at bot Vernon and Dudley.
"If you're done, can you, please, come downstairs and provide breakfast to dad?" he asked. She stared. Who was this boy? This couldn't be her Dudley. This well-mannered, controlled boy couldn't be her son.
"Harry." It's mom's voice. Albus looks behind dad to find her standing at the entryway with a frown and furrowed brows.
"I love you too." Harry whispered and then continued, "Welcome back."
"What is the point of this question father?" Draco asked and Lucius replied, his body frozen, "Answer me."
"Are you sure?" Severus asks because mother can't. Mother is crying openly in front of Draco, tears streaming down her cheeks. Draco doesn't feel the urge to comfort her. She is not well herself.
"Tell me who did what? Tell me Draco. For Merlin's sake, tell me." Harry pleaded and looked into his eyes, his hands in Draco's.
He closes his eyes. Sweat trickles down his cheeks and mingles with his blood, some of which trickles inside his mouth. The coppery taste urges him to spit it out but he can barely move as it is. His heart is literally pounding. It's dark and cloudy and he's sure it will start raining soon. It's quite chilly and he is so cold that he has to literally bite his index finger to prevent them from chartering.
"My father died when you gave me away to him. Don't look at me. Don't meet me. Don't talk to me. Don't show your face to me." Draco screams at him, her voice hoarse.
"He doesn't know that I am alive. It doesn't matter." Harry answers softly, trying to coax the man.
Harry had never even imagined that Draco was holding so much pain inside him. He cried and screamed and shook and trembled and hugged Harry tightly. He cursed those bastards and vowed to destroy them, crying all the while. At a point he punched Harry's chest and cursed him for not caring earlier.
"If I cannot make Harry mine, I won't let him belong to anyone else."
"I do not have anything say to you except perhaps that you must grow a spine. It's high time and I do not care if Harry has forgiven you. He is so bloody forgiving that I already knew that he would forgive you. I won't though and I do not trust you either. I will keep tabs on Tessa and she will know Harry and me. You will not keep her away from her family and she will attend Hogwarts. I am warning you. If you ever hurt her, you will regret it."
It was amazing Harry had been angry with Draco's possessiveness in the past. It was so sweet.
"I don't understand. What's happening? Are they blind? I mean- atleast Granger used to have brains. Longbottoms, Finnigans, Smiths, Weasleys and so many others have started addressing him as their lord and Potter's here, hiding while another war is brewing, thanks to Burbage." Draco's voice is almost frantic by the time he finishes and Severus only looks at him with his annoyingly cool eyes and a raised eyebrow.
"Where do you think he is?" Petunia asks and Vernon glares at her. She has asked this very question so many times that he has lost count. He is already worried for the brat. This is not his school and our community don't function like theirs. Anything could happen to him. Anything. The boy wasn't even allowed to use magic to defend himself.
"The death eaters are alive. Even aunt Bella and Greyback are alive." Her eyes are haunted as they gaze at him, "You can't protect me from everyone."
"Lucius." Severus murmurs sharply and points his wand towards the man's heart. Twin gasps escape Narcissa's and Lucius's mouth, "Put her down or I will kill you and I won't care about my cover being blown. She is not your child and you can't corrupt her by keeping her away from me."
"What's he doing here?" She asks Vernon who is looking quietly at her.
" Sweet Merlin Draco. " He spoke sharply and when Draco tried to open his trouser button, he knew that he must stop this madness " Stop it Draco."
And then Harry did the most astonishing thing. He pulled back and muttered "Take off your trousers and underwear and turn around."
"Ma-l-foys." Sirius says. Harry still makes the error sometimes and Malfoy would be offended if Harry were to make this error in front of the blonde. Not that Sirius's going to take Harry to visit the manor.
He nodded, glaring at her "Of course I am coming. Move aside."
"May I have your attention please?" Father's voice boomed throughout the hall and Draco turned away from the voice. Harry looked at him with warm eyes and murmured "It's not healthy to stay away from everyone at the party. You must interact with everyone and you should talk to your parents. They must have missed you." Draco was about to speak but his father beat him to it.
"You brought him to our house. You agreed to help him. Don't you dare twist-"
Harry was sitting with his parents. Severus, Sirius and Remus were sitting at the next table. It was apparent that Harry was avoiding his godparents and did not speak to Severus because he was with them.
"I don't understand anything. Riddle and Voldemort are one and the same. Surely you are mistaken." He mutters and Draco sighs audibly.
"No. You won't. You will workout and we will talk about your magic later. It was just that one time. You could be mistaken. Maybe Harry can confirm once he is well. Harry- shh- we are almost there."
"Then, by all means, do," he said.
"They did. You chose them over me. You always cancelled our dates for them. It was like I was not even important for you. You did not love me." Draco replied softly, his eyes still on Harry's chest.
" We will take your leave now then. "
"You might be pregnant. Hermione asked me to look out for symptoms." He murmurs and Draco's heart sinks. She can't be pregnant with his child... NO!
He stares at her in disbelief.
Dudley gasped and Harry looked at him "Let's sit on the couch and you can tell everything to us Aunt Petunia." She nodded and they settled on the couch. He gave a cup of tea to her and she denied it but he insisted so she took it. Their was an odd look in her eyes when she did though and he asked "What happened?"
"Yes. I am coming." Draco replied and crawled out of the bed. He stretched his body and noticed Harry's eyes trailing over his chest. Harry averted his eyes, his cheeks tinged pink when Draco cleared his throat and Draco helped Harry on the wheelchair he had ordered for Harry.
Even though Narcissa's eyes watered and her cheeks stained with tears, her hands never stopped. She went on applying the ointment on Draco's neck and chest and hands. Then she kept the ointment on the bedside before getting up.
She sighed, "Bring them in the hall and guard them at all times. Don't wake Hermione and cousin Ron up."
"No. It's better that I do. She didn't want me to tell anyone. It's - it's rather complicated and I won't have forced her to let me tell you dad. She - I- she is in trouble." Albus says. His fists are clenched tightly and his eyes are so alarmed and terrified and pained that Harry blinks in surprise. Had it been Lily or James saying this, he would have assumed it to be something as simple as breaking their brooms. But Albus has never been dramatic and if he is this scared, then this girl must be in serious trouble.
Lucius looks at her with melancholic eyes before turning towards Severus, "I am ready to beg Potter. He is the only one who would care to rescue her. Please. I will do anything."
"Mr. Malfoy- Mr. Malfoy." Lucius blinks hard and shakes his head to focus on present and looks at the woman.
Harry sighed and just looked at him. What was the point of saying something Draco already knew? There eyes met and Draco averted his eyes first, "I am tired. Let's call it a night."
"How did you know?" Harry asks, stunned.
"DRACO. DRACO. WHAT IS HAPPENING? SNAP OUT OF IT." The voice shouted and his eyes shot open. Harry's face was close to his and he hugged the man desperately and tightly. Harry's essence was so pure that it always soothed him. Belatedly, he realized that tears were flowing down his eyes.
"I was not sure earlier." Harry replied and continued with a sigh, his eyes trained on his best friend's white face, "She has not met us yet. She knows that I know. She expects you to be angry with me and abandon me."
"Of course, I would try to avenge you. Of course, I would try to kill them. It will be upto you to stop me." Harry muttered, his lips touching Draco's and Draco moaned when Harry sucked the lower lip.
A few moments pass and he is still kissing her. She places her hands on his shoulder probably because she needs to breathe but he can't bring himself to stop. His need has taken over him. He doesn't want to stop. He wants her so much that it's difficult to breathe.
He dragged his legs towards the bed and sat upon it. Hermione had numbed Draco's back so that it did not hurt him. Harry started applying the ointment on Draco's thighs first and then moved on his calf. Then he proceeded to his stomach, chest, neck and back.
"Yes, my son." Narcissa spoke. She was standing beside Lucius now. "Do not think that your parents have led a loveless life. I love your father and I always have and I always will. You don't have to be conscious in front of us. Harry is a lot like Lily. Isn't he Severus?"
"They denied." Albus mutters, surprised. Scorpius frowns.
He picked Draco in his arms and Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's legs and his arms around Harry's neck, kissing him deeply. Harry squeezed Draco's arse and Draco pulled back, looking at him with a little panic in his yes. Draco did not know that his eyes revealed his panic which was why he started peppering Harry's face with kisses. Harry trailed his hand all over Draco's back and he noticed the way Draco clenched his eyes completely shut. Yes a part of it was because Draco desired Harry but Draco pressed their foreheads together and a part of the reason of his tremble was because Draco was reminiscing something from his past because Draco had not moved on.
He had expected Draco to sneer or shout at him. He had not expected what happened next. Draco cast a cleaning charm and cleaned the floor and then shoved Harry hard. Harry fell down on the floor and Draco straddled him, placing his legs on either side of Harry's hips.
"Mr. Potter, please save my daughter. Please." These words belong to Narcissa. She is crying frantically. Lucius is still quiet, perhaps because he knows that Harry will rescue Draco.
Harry swallows bile. His stomach turns when he watches Seamus burrow his face in Draco's neck.
"What are you going to do Weasley? Will you atleast tell us so that we can be ready. I do not even want to be a part of your stupid schemes anymore. I should never have got involved in the first place." The woman sitting on the couch behind Ginny snapped at her and the man beside her agreed "Me too. I do not want any part in this."
Lucius had never been so amazed in his life. The girl continued speaking " Will you tell him Thank you on my behalf. Daddy says that Britain is sorry for hurting Mr. Malfoy. "
So, Sirius sighs, "Yes."
The main door of his house was open and his alarm increased. When he entered and looked around, he found the kitchen door closed, which was odd. So he decided to look into the kitchen first.
He tried to think about mundane things, things like Black had shoulder length hair and a scar underneath his right year. Absently, he wondered why Black never got it removed.
He had been in a delusion that he had healed. It was a delusion because he had developed an itch ever since he had landed in Britain. An itch to clean him, to rub his body until it was washed off everyone's touch.
"I- does she know it?" Harry asks and Hermione shakes her head, "No. She doesn't. I didn't have the heart to tell her. If she starts vomiting or feels anything different, ask her to take the pregnancy test."
Finally, Draco looked at him and his eyes were carefully blank. He replied "Like what?"
"I can't move on. I love you so much. I can never move on. I will just die." Harry spoke, his voice soft and breaking from crying.
"I am going to give them a show, Tom. If you hadn't captured Draco, if you hadn't done what you did, I would have had mercy on you. I had originally planned to just cut your head off. Clean and simple. But now... I am going to make it messy and I am going to torture you till your last breath. You can reveal yourself Draco." the last words are muttered without even looking away from a very shocked and terrified looking dark lord.
She apparated before Harry had even opened his mouth and he was left gaping at the door, wondering worriedly where she had gone.
"Draco." He whispers and she looks into his helpless eyes. Silent tears fall down her cheeks.
"SIGN THEM." Draco ordered and Harry grabbed the papers and tore them into half. Draco just stared in shock, his hand hanging in the air. Harry tore the two pieces into four parts and then made their eight parts and then sixteen and then threw the papers in the fireplace.
"Ginny, wait." He says suddenly and reaches for her small hands. They are warm and her fingers wrap around his.
None of them noticed Harry until he raised his voice to get the way cleared for him. Ten years had elapsed and he had not forgiven Britain.
He should have kept his wand on him, not that he was allowed to use it. He had to be extra careful after what happened last year with Dudley. He finds himself wishing that he had a bit of Dudley's or Uncle Vernon's strength. That way he could have fought these bastards. They are three of them and they are really strong. He is no match for them and they are hell bent on hurting him.
"My tongue got away from me." He muttered and looked outside the window to avoid Draco's eyes.
"Mom asked me to visit her." He answers before continuing in a soft voice, "Pweeeaaase. I'll eat all the vegetabws and I'll drink milk also. I'll be a good boy."
The moment Harry touched his shirt's button, Draco felt his forehead sweat. Still, Harry looked into his eyes intensely and Draco tried to distract his unwavering gaze by unbuttoning Harry's shirt. Harry let him and Harry's shirt was on the floor and Draco stared at Harry's broad chest. He still had a few battle scars and Draco traced his finger on Harry's tight nipples. Harry hissed and Draco pinched them. Harry moaned and Draco's heart raced a bit.
"Harry, I don't - " Draco started but Harry cut him off " I know. "
A moment later, Draco starts speaking again. Albus tries once again and this time Draco doesn't stop speaking but Albus is thrown out yet again and his lips upturn in a smirk. Albus swallows. His heart starts beating rapidly and he tries to keep his eyes blank.
He moves a bit and she doesn't react to it. He blinks and then breathes deeply before murmuring, "I am not going to hurt you. You are at my home in Godric's Hollow. Don't worry. No-one will hurt you here."
"Did I ask you to take care of it? Did I? Why did you even offer it when you didn't want to? So you were experimenting. So what- I already knew it before I kissed you." He is almost yelling by this point.
Draco's eyes nearly bulge out of their sockets and jaw drops ungracefully. Severus knew that Potter was alive. Draco remembers seeing him at Potter's funeral. No one was sure if the coffin even consisted of Potter's body. The only ones who could have known were Severus and Sirius and no one dared to ask them. Both were extremely temperamental. Granger and Weasley were there as well.
Draco cried and cried and he heard Hernione sob too. It had to be difficult for the woman considering that she was a healer and did not even realize that Draco was in trauma.
Harry stood staring and Ron muttered "Draco-" but Draco snapped at him "I am not going to tolerate their presence just because they are your family Weasley. Pick your sides."
Severus assured him that Potter loved Draco. Lucius wanted to meet his son and so did Narcissa but they couldn't. They had failed their only son. Draco had not shown his face to them and he did not have courage to call upon his son.
He knew that prudency demanded him to stop but Draco's ego was already fragile. He would never be able to look Harry in his eyes if Harry stopped this.
He just closed the fireplace off after taking the bloody portkey. It was in the shape of a coin and Sirius placed it on his table before laying down on the bed to go to sleep.
"It's all your fault." Narcissa hisses, tears flowing down her cheeks. Her eyes are red-rimmed and she has been crying for a while now, "You didn't even tell me that he asked you if he could court our daughter, that he wants to marry Draco."
"We must get you healed. It's already too late. I can not see you in pain any longer." Harry replied and Draco stared. This was the first time Harry had completely ignored his friends in favour of looking after Draco.
"You do realize that you'll have to return if you decide to help Malfoy get out of whatever trouble she has landed herself in
"Back off. Do I need to obliviate the three of you. I might as well send you to Janus Thickey ward. That will keep this out of the dark lord's ears." He lies. Of course, he is not going to do any of it and Lucius knows but the man mutters, "No. We will back off and leave and keep quiet. People are starting to notice. We will take our leave now but this is isn't finished. I want to talk to you."
Petunia couldn't breathe. She couldn't. She parted her lips and started inhaling and exhaling deeply. Very slowly, she turned her face to look at the door between the kitchen and the sitting room. She closed her eyes. They were lying. She wasn't a - wasn't a witch and she had wanted it so badly. She had even requested Dumbledore to make her a witch, not knowing that it was impossible for the man. Lily was the luckier one. She could do all sorts of magical things and Petunia had wanted magic so badly. She was just so - so normal - not magical or even beautiful enough to be considered interesting.
"NOT that again. I
This in mind, Albus heads towards Draco's manor.
"Have you asked him?" Draco asked carefully.
With her mothers charming and quiet personality and father's charisma, this child is perfect. He can't help but feel that Draco and Harry will be safe as long as they have each other.
"Do you want to have dinner out today? It has been a while." Harry asked and a shiver crawled up Draco's spine. He did not answer because he did not want to refuse but he couldn't accept going out just yet. The risk was very big.
Abruptly, Harry's voice became soft and dangerous "Do you know how it feels to watch your love, your life hang himself to death Draco? You don't because I have never attempted it. I also have my demons and I used to drink to forget them. The fear that someone would sneak inside my bath has never left me. The fear that someone might unlock my door and attempt to undress me has never left me but I stopped drinking because you did not want me to. I tried to find the strength to get over it in you, YOU BLOODY COWARD." Draco flinched when Harry shouted "YOU ARE MY LIFE, MY EVERYTHING. WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T TRUST ANYONE EXCEPT YOU. I NEVER HAVE AND I NEVER WILL."
"Of course, I came." He answered and Harry averted his eyes "I thought you won't."
Harry stood bonelessly in Draco's arms and Draco whispered "I did not let you-"
"You will sign them. I want a divorce." Draco snapped back.
"PLEASE CLEAR THE WAY." Harry yelled at them and everyone froze when he spoke."Draco."
Before she can get another word out, Ron starts, "This is one of your worst plans, Harry and Snape won't agree."
"SHUT UP AND STOP LYING." Harry shouted at his face, his face red and his hands shaking in rage.
"Potter." Draco mutters impatiently but Potter refuses to answer so Draco does as he's told. He starts limping out of the room, feigning a moan as he walks. Potter doesn't care. Draco's annoyed eyes linger on Potter's broad shoulders and strong frame and he huffs petulantly before leaving Potter be. It's not like Potter to not care. Maybe Draco is just imagining all this.
He had not gone to Snape's place. He had shopped for groceries and then walked a bit and spent his time in a garden. When it became unbearable for him to stay still for another moment, he decided to return. It was just seven PM and Draco had asked him to return at 9. But He just couldn't stay away for a moment longer. So he closed his eyes and apparated to his house.
"Close your mouth and settle down Draco." Father muttered and Draco glared at him, "This is your fault father."
"This is what you have been doing for the past few days and in initial years of your marriage. I had thought that it was Draco who was an animal, who just shouted and fought with you and quarrelled with us as well. I had never imagined that you would be so animalistic, Harry." She shouted at him, punching his chest and Draco came out of his stupor to whisper "Granger."
"Harry, we must talk about this." Finally Draco spoke and Harry shrugged "There is nothing to talk about. I had a difficult childhood. So what. They did not love me. At least I was not forced to –" Harry stopped to breathe before continuing " You are more important Draco. We must go to this event."
All of a sudden the magic that had enveloped them was gone and he was back on his feet. Harry was sweating and his body ached with need and he felt so bereft that he simply stared at his husband desperately.
Draco woke up, sweating and screaming, his voice hoarse and his face covered with tears. The first thing he did was looking around to confirm that he was in his own house. The thought brought a little comfort to him. It did not stop the disgust and feeling of tongue and whisky all over him, however.
"Yessss." He hissed and Draco's eyes widened with lust "That's what I wanted to see. Now, we will find them and then we will ruin them. Just wait Draco. I will bring them and throw them at your feet." Draco's eyes darkened with desire and his kissed Harry passionately before continuing "Yes. I will call everyone home tomorrow and tell them. It's time they returned to their homeland as well. I have kept them away long enough."
"Draco. I had thought that you were healing." He whispered softly. He did not want Draco to be angry or too scared. Draco did not reply. He bowed his head and looked at the floor, his hands crawling to his wrists and Harry cleared his throat before speaking "Please speak to me."
"It wasn't just your fault, Harry. You never talked about his past with him or yours." Hermione frowned, "You rushed into marriage. He needed time to heal. I had told you."
Harry stared as Lucius left him and closed the door behind him. His slip of tongue had not gone unnoticed by Harry. Why would Lucius call his father by his first name and speak about him as if he was aware what his dad would want? Harry had never known that Lucius was a writer.
Harriet stays quiet and watches uncle Severus.
His feet freeze and a bead of sweat trickles down his cheek as Bellatrix lifts her wand and starts uttering her trademark curse, "Cruc-"
Draco sits up and leans against the couch before looking at the girl, "- and he disappeared right after he invented it. Isn't it strange?"
They had had sex in the initial years of their marriage and Harry had never seen the scars of a knife penetration. This meant that Draco had hidden them. He could have removed Draco's pants himself but Draco was simply not ready for any sexual intimacy and after watching those photos, Harry thought that Draco needed to interact with more people. They had remained cooped for very long and Harry had been irresponsible. He should have asked Draco. Of course he was still in trauma. Of course he had not healed. He had been abused and manipulated.
"Ummm, they thought you will be uncomfortable around them." Harry spoke after having a bite. Draco sighed "I am not uncomfortable as long as you are with me."
He would have pondered over it but Draco's words did not leave any space for any other thought at all.
Draco replied, "Thank you for bringing me back." and placed his chin on Harry's shoulder.
He tried to pull back, his cheeks warm from embarrassment but Harry hugged him tightly instead "Hey, I want my teddy bear back. Don't wake up yet."
Lucius was about to speak something when he felt a tug at his robes. He looked down and found an eight year old girl in front of him in a very pretty pink colored dress. She smiled and he couldn't help but smile back.
." Snape casts and Harry feels blackness take over him-
"Fault!" Albus exclaimed, his eyes going wide in surprise, "It's not a bad thing to help others, dad. You said so."
Something burned inside Draco. He didn't understand why she didn't shove him off and leave. The Weasleys had the minister's support and Draco would be kicked out if the Weasleys complained to Shacklebolt which was why Pansy wrapped her fingers firmly around his wrist just as George wrapped his right arm around Potter's waist. His arm curled around her waist and rested on her stomach. Potter pinched her lips and her nostrils flared but she didn't back off, not even when George wrapped his other arm around her front, just above Fred's arms.
"No. It's enough. We're going home." Blaise murmured.
Draco stared at Harry who was having his breakfast quietly. Initially, he had been acting but now Harry seemed genuinely hurt.
"I would tell you that you're merely obsessed with him and I would also tell you to stop obsessing over a man you know nothing about but it would be fruitless." Dad snaps angrily at him.
Harry couldn't help it anymore. He breathed hard and wiped his eyes. The unshed tears were wiped off and were replaced by more but he wiped his eyes again and sat up. He had to do this. He had to say this. It was required. He had fallen into the category of people who could manipulate Draco. He was dangerous and it was horrifying. The only man who was supposed to love Draco unconditionally had manipulated him.
"Who were they?" The words were growled and they were spoken by Ronald. Draco was surprised to hear so much anger in his voice .
The anger that had left with Voldemort's defeat returned and he felt the urge to return to Britain and destroy this person and others who had hurt Draco.
Her eyes softened and shined with unshed tears. She said, "He has moved on with his life. Why don't you-"
"AHHHHH. Hurts so much. Burns all over. Ahhhhh." Draco stumbled down on the floor, naked, wet, bleeding and burning and closed his eyes tightly, Tears trickled down his cheeks. It hurt so much.
Harry stares at both of them while sitting back. He is truly at a loss. What are they on about. Okay, maybe he asks his elf and Albus about her sometimes. But he is certainly not obsessed. He didn't have any crush on her.
"No, you don't. You go out with me because I'm more like dad than Albus." James says quietly, desperately.
Draco thought and interrupted her rant "He did not give me those. They were, er, inflicted by my, er, clients." She cast a spell and muttered "But then, they are a decade old. Why were they not healed?" The burn decreased and she accioed a healing ointment, before muttering "Please apply this Harry. I think he would prefer you to do it instead of me."
Finally, she stopped crying and pulled back a bit. She held his cheeks softly and kissed his forehead and Harry stared at her with wide eyes. He had never felt this-their was no name for the emotions he was going through. Aunt Petunia had never looked at him with love in her eyes. Never had he imagined that it would feel so good.
Dad nods and turns around to walk towards his chair and Malfoy practically flies out of the office. Harry has to place his left arm around her waist to prevent her from stumbling.
His heart aches for many reasons. She loves him unconditionally. Harry wants Draco to love him like this.
Finally, Draco nodded and unbuttoned his trousers with trembling hands. Harry wondered if Draco was expecting him to take his advantage. His heart burned from the thought. He would never abuse anyone, leave alone Draco this way. He loved Draco so much.
The silence was uncomfortable and continued for the next couple of minutes.
"Shut it." Mother snapped at Draco and father and they stared at her, "You have to speak to Harry, Draco. Fight for yourself like you always did. I did not give birth to a defeatist."
A meal, tea and thirty five minutes later, Draco found himself back inside the ministry. He was standing in front of the closed door of Black's office. As soon as he had reached his apartment, he had told Black that he wanted him to tell Potter about this in his presence. After hesitating for another five minutes, he knocked lightly on the door, once and then again.
It's painful to hear her sobs in the silence of the night even as he walks out of the room.
Severus raises a hand to stop her monologue. Gryffindors and their harebrained schemes.
"Mr. Malfoy-Potter, how do you feel-"
"Dra- Draco." He hiccupped and his world was slowly falling apart around him. Why had Draco committed suicide? What had compelled him? Why had he broken when nothing had deterred him in the past?
Draco looked at his hands again and Harry wondered for the second time about Draco's dream.
"The Draco I knew at Hogwarts would strangle someone else rather than trying to commit suicide. He would not depend on me to save him. He would tell me very clearly that he did not need anyone's help. You- you are a coward and a defeated man." Harry mocked him. Yes the git was mocking him and was sneering at Draco.
"I will just cast a cleaning charm, Draco. You can take rest." Harry whispered and Draco shook his head mutely. This was his home as well and he would clean it with Harry. He had this right.
Suddenly, nothing makes sense.
"He will understand. Half of the population hated him for having that scar on his face and the other half fawned over him. He is not like others. Talk to him. You have to talk to someone." Albus insists.
She breathes deeply and tries to stop her tears.
"Draco." Blaise shouts. Draco burrows inside his blanket. He doesn't want to wake up.
"Can I pway with cousin Dudwey. I brought my toy wand too. We can practice together. Uncle Severus and uncle Sirius taught me."
"Where is everyone?" She asked.
"Ron, Hermione. Please leave. I will manage this. She will be frightened if she wakes up in your presence."
"I am sorry." Draco repeated and Severus whispered dangerously "Do not apologize to me Draco. Go and apologize to Harry."
"How is she?" He asks as he settles down on the couch. She sits opposite him, her eyes fixed at the fireplace.
"What have you done this time?" He snaps at the man, his teeth gritted.
"She thinks that I am a flower delicate flower Harry. Tell her that I won't break." Draco grumbled and Harry patted his back gently, avoiding the trio's eyes at all costs. "She is just trying to care and make up for her past behaviour and ignorance." Harry nodded at her and closed his eyes to apparate them to their house.
"Look at me." Draco hisses. Harry's hands clench in tight fists.
Harry drifts off and lets the darkness take him over. For the first time, it feels that he is finally home.
Snape nods and whirls around. Harry follows him with Sirius and Lucius.
Severus's mouth open in utter shock. Firstly, how does she even remember Black telling anything to her. Does she remember anything else and secondly why will Black find him cute. She is always making fun of his nose. Earlier it was his hair so he started paying monthly visits to a magical saloon and now she won't stop about his nose.
"Okay." Harry replied and closed his eyes to sleep. He had never noticed that Draco's presence was so comforting. "I loved your treacle tart, you know."
He knew that he would go insane without Harry. As he saw Harry's blood around them, he already felt his sanity slipping.
He stopped in front of Harry's room and took a long breath, trying to control his raging motions. The sight that greeted him when he opened the door stole his breath away. Harry was lying on the bed, his eyes closed. He was dressed in hospital clothes and his face and hands had scars.
Harry smiled and replied "Tea." Though he was smiling, his insides were churning with something indescribable. This was the same house in which he had been almost assaulted multiple times and he had not wanted to ever set a foot in this house again.
"I don't know, do I?" she said, sighing heavily, his brows creased, "All I know is that I need to leave."
"So, you came, eh?" The man said mockingly as he closed the file that he was studying and placed it on the top of others, "I was sure that you had got cold feet and left the country."
Harry did not answer because he couldn't bear to lie to Draco. He would have to accept this truth sometime. Finally, it felt that Draco was letting it out.
Draco knew that there was no way Harry was going to listen to him so he just murmured "Nothing."
"I'm afraid I can't," she replied, saying the exact words he had said and opened the door. She closed it and walked down the stairs and after having passed the gargoyles, she wrapped her cloak around her and then she headed towards her bedroom, hoping Bill wouldn't be there. She would try to contact Kingsley. She could do it through the floo. However, she had only taken three steps when she heard soft murmurs and she stopped walking because one of the voices belonged to Ariana. The other belonged to Scorpius Malfoy. He was her secret boyfriend. Harriet knew, though. Of course, she knew. She also knew that Malfoy approved and that he had given them the talk. She was not proud of overhearing the conversations of her daughter and her boyfriend, hidden underneath her cloak but she knew that it was better not to get too attached to Ariana, not when Harriet didn't know what would happen of her in the coming future. She would prefer that her kids stayed with Malfoy if something to happened to her. He was a responsible man. Harriet trusted him to take care of the kids.
She pulls back after a couple of moments and Harry closes the door. He does notice that his father is watching the entire incident from the corner of his eyes.
"I love him sir. I know that you are his godfather and that you still despise me for what dad did though I am not completely sure what he really did. But I really do love Draco and I will defeat Voldemort. If Draco gets marked, where will that lead him. He is too talented to waste his life in Azkaban. I might be able to pull the strings and get him released but his career will be ruined and he will have to waste many years in redeeming himself. I can't have that happen because I want to spend my life with him once all this is over." The girl mutters in a single breath and Severus's eyes widen. She is so confident that she will defeat the most powerful and dakest wizard of all time and apparently, she has decided that he will spend his life with his-
"DRACO. LET HIM GO." Sirius shouted from somewhere behind him.
It was Ron who spoke "He is alive. You saved him Harry. You came on time. Had you been a minute late, he would have died." Harry sobbed in relief and closed his wet eyes. Ron hugged and him and so did Hermione.
"Where did he go? WHERE DID HE GO?" Draco hears, panting hard. He covers his mouth with his right hand to stifle a moan and braces himself against the wall, breathing heavily through his nose. Blood trickles down his cheeks from the gashes on his forehead and nose. His left leg is so wounded that he can barely walk and his head is pounding. His hands are trembling so much that he doesn't know how he will defend himself, if they attack him. They have snapped his wand and he has no strength to fight them physically.
Draco takes a deep breath before laying down on Potter's lap again. She stares at his face. He seems annoyed.
Harry doesn't answer anyone. He just stares at Sirius speechlessly.
Tears streamed down his cheeks and he did not attempt to wipe them away, choosing to stare at Harry's face instead. It seemed that Draco's throat was closing. It had become difficult to breathe all of a sudden. His heart was hammering inside his chest. He wondered if Harry had also felt so terrified when Draco had attempted to commit suicide.
All of a sudden, Draco's eyes shot open and his silver eyes fell on his hands. Harry was confused when Draco sat up and looked all around him, as if expecting something else. Then Draco did the most astonishing and alarming thing. He hugged himself and closed his eyes. A sob escaped his mouth and Harry finally asked "What's the matter. Draco? It did not seem that you had a nightmare."
Draco's eyes widened and he hurried to meet Harry.
That was that. Draco muttered "Blinky. Slinky."
Draco grits his teeth, clenches his jaw and continues staring outside. He knows that he can't back off.
"You don't understand what you are asking for." He murmurs and presses a light kiss on her closed lips.
Harry leant forward and Draco wrapped his hands around Harry's neck. His lips took Draco's inside his and Draco closed his eyes. His head was twisted so that Harry could gain proper access into his mouth and Draco felt all tension leave him. He pressed his groin into Harry's and Harry groaned inside his mouth.
Harry sighed after remaining silent for a couple of moments, his hands grazing Draco's stomach lightly "We do not have to find them if you do not want to. We can live here peacefully and happily." Harry spoke and Draco placed his head on the window sadly.
He did not understand Draco's reaction though. He had turned white and then red.
"You will help me and if you don't, I will destroy both of you."
"we love you." His parents spoke together. Draco knew why. Father did not like display of emotions or affection like this. Harry dragged him and Draco went willingly, gobsmacked at the drastic change father had undergone.
Petunia starts taking deep breaths and her eyes become damp.
It seemed that Emily had been standing just outside their room because her voice reached them in a heartbeat "Yes, Mr. Malfoy-Potter."
James' face snaps back at Scorpius at that. His eyes are wide and surprised. Scorpius smiles sadly.
"Yes, well... I want you to obliviate me but I want only memories related to our relationship to be removed." He says and Snape doesn't even blink an eye at Harry's declaration. It surprises Harry a bit.
"Everything is of your choice." He continues softly and she nods reluctantly before staring at her hands silently.
"I love you too." Harry murmurs and embraces Draco tightly. He watches their reflection in the mirror. They are looking, beautiful, perfect, free and Harry knows that he has to be patient with Draco. At that very moment, Draco rises his face and looks at him with those silver eyes of his and Harry decides that Draco is worth it and that he will wait as long as he has to if it makes Draco happy.
Lucius shook his hand and murmured politely "Even I hope so."
"Okay. We will see you tomorrow mate." Ron murmurs and Hermione continues softly, "I will tell Narcissa that she is here. I will bring her tomorrow morning. I think she needs her mother."
Draco waits because he can see that Potter has not finished yet.
"He hates her Albus. He hates her and your siblings hate me and even the Weasleys hate us." The girl murmurs. Harry makes a face. He had thought that Ron and Hermione were above hating a child after everything they went through. He will have a word with them.
"But it's my birthday." Harry whined and reached for the glass. It was Saturday night and the club was packed and it was his birthday. He was fortunate that at least Blaise had stuck with him. Hermione and Ron had quit a year ago.
"Draco. Please. He will leave and I want you to stop." It was Harry who had whispered this. Harry who was tolerating his madness, though he deserved better. Harry was so sweet and patient and loved him so much.
Harry took his lips inside his to deepen the kiss and Draco felt like coming home. The kiss became passionate and Harry turned his face the other way to get proper access. It was like Harry was devouring him and Draco hugged Harry tightly.
His smile falls and jaw drops in shock when a familiar figure heads towards him. Her head is bowed and she is dressed in a red gown that accentuates her curves. Red danglers are donning her ears and even her nails are painted red. Her hair is as blonde and straight as it was in school.
Draco just stared because that was not what he had expected. It was not like Harry knew the about the spells he had cast to hide those scars. They could be treated of course, but he was too embarrassed and terrified to get them treated so he had hidden them.
He had never done this. He had thought that Draco won't like revisiting his past. He had never wanted to talk to Draco about it. He had never understood what Draco wanted at all.
Severus has been trying to find Draco for the past twenty minutes now. She is nowhere. He has searched the entire manor. Thinking that maybe she is in Lucius's room, he walks towards it.
"As if you would listen to me." Draco looked pointedly at him and Harry tapped his nose with his own "Of course, I would."
"The dark lord asked him take Draco to him and he left her with the Dark lord in his manor." Narcissa mumbles and Severus stares at Lucius whose eyes are turned towards the floor, "He refused to let that Potter boy date her and yet he left her with the Dark lord."
"Where is she? What did you tell her?" He asks, getting straight to the point.
"Hahahaha." Harriet giggles as Black tickles her everywhere her hands can reach. Green eyes sparkle with happiness and her laughter echoes all over the manor. He can't remember this place being so full of life like ever.
"Stay out of my business," she snapped, still looking at him with narrowed eyes. He did not move because he valued his life and was utterly sure that she meant the threat. But, this did not mean that he would leave her be. Something was wrong - actually many things were wrong and he would not sit back and watch quietly while the rest of the world fell apart around him - not this time around. After all, he was the head auror and even Potter could not stop him from doing his job.
He stared at her and blinked hard and stared some more, trying to understand why his long lost best friend would try to harm anyone in this manner.
"Bloody buggering hell. I should never have let him leave that day." Harry hissed to himself and wanted to break something. But he couldn't because that would alarm Draco and the man would think that Harry was angry at him.
"Father." Draco started but Harry lifted his hand from Draco's cheeks to place a finger on his lips. He received a soft kiss on his finger in reply and Harry placed his hand back on Draco's cheeks. The movement did not go unnoticed by Lucius and his eyes returned to Harry's.
Draco cuts him off, "It was too late. You were too excited."
"Thank you. I can't tell you more yet. I will when I am comfortable." Harry said and before Draco realized what he was doing, he walked towards the miserable ball that was Harry and turned him over to hug him.
He had just placed one foot on the stair when his whole world just revolved around him.  His foot slipped and then everything just turned black.
Harry nods, trying to reassure Ron who gives him a barely perceptible nod and turns back towards his breakfast. Hermione ignores the entire conversation. Together, they walk out of the great hall. The intensity of Draco's glare increases but Harry still doesn't look at him.
godson. You should have searched for him." He spoke coldly.
"CAN'T EVEN BLOODY HATE YOU." After that Draco threw punch after punch on his chest and the force behind them went on decreasing gradually.
Just a minute back Harry and he had hugged them and now – now they did not even exist. Was it too much to want children, Harry's and his children? He hugged himself sadly and visualized his kids's laughing faces again.
"I am not self obsessed," Malfoy said and Harry snorted, "And I am not Harry Potter."
Four hours had elapsed and Draco had written his last letter to Harry. He had given all his money and assets to Harry and was now sitting in his room. It was seven and he had tied the rope to the ceiling. He had also placed the chair on his bed.
Draco swivelled around to storm inside Black's office but found him leant against the wall beside his open door.
The fact that Lucius had never replaced dad's ring with Narcissa's didn't escape anyone's notice and  a new found respect grew in Harry's heart for the elder Malfoy.
Draco searched his eyes a bit and then nodded "Yes. I will start cleaning now."
a freak," she said when several minutes passed and nothing happened, "He's alive. WHERE ARE YOU BOY?" and jumped, startled when Dudley slammed his fist on the table.
"You won't believe what happened, Draco," Blaise muttered, his chest heaving, "The unspeakables told me that it's actually 2001. I barely escaped their clutches."
"Okay. Don't get your knickers in a twist." Draco replied mockingly but Harry was already snoring so he closed his eyes too and let sleep take over. Harry's arms worked wonders and for once, he did not have any nightmares.
Harry did not answer and Draco knew that he would feel cold in boxers so he sighed "Okay. Then you will have to manage in these clothes for an hour. I will get a pair cleaned by Kreacher."
Draco opened his mouth to say something but Harry dismissed him before sighing and unbuttoning his shirt. Draco just stood there watching him undress and his cock twitched.
His eyes were wet and he hugged Harry desperately. Harry knew him and so he kept quiet. Draco did not need any false reassurances.
Narcissa continues crying frantically after this and Severus slumps on the nearest chair, staring at Lucius.
"I was not the one who led you Draco." Hermione replied, his eyes still wet. "I just did not approve you as a life partner for Harry. You were too unpredictable, too volatile. I did not know that you were so hurt. I am so very sorry. I will never be able to forgive myself."
Finally, when there was only Potter with him in the room beside Pansy and Blaise, he spoke up, "What's going on, Potter?"
"I wish I could. I wanted it but still I didn't want it." Draco whispered and Harry closed his eyes, regretting his stupid words.
He stares at Lucius menacingly. The man lowers his eyes towards the floor. It confirms his suspicions.
It did nothing to reduce Albus's nervousness.
"Don't worry." He mouths at her, wondering what else Black was right about. The woman nods and retreats towards Harriet's room and Severus apparates back to Howgarts to get some of his clothes. He will have to stay here for a few days.
"You mean that I caused that blast?" Albus asked whereas the other three occupants stayed quiet.
He was so embarrassed that he wanted to leave but Draco's dangerous voice stopped him.
However, Draco refuses to let Harry live in peace. When Harry is not in the gryffindor tower, he is being followed by Draco. By the time sun sets, Harry starts feeling that his life has become hell.
Draco was still sobbing and Harry sobbed with him. Hermione pressed the vials on Draco's lips and then Harry picked up Draco's naked and burnt body and placed him on the bed. He covered Draco with a blanket and Hermione said "Don't. Don't cover him. I will give you an ointment. You need to apply it on him and he needs to rest. He does not have to be covered. Lock the door and let his body be exposed to cool air."
"No. Up up up up. Mr. Mawfoy. Up pwease." She murmurs and looks at him with eyes so adorable that he can't help but kneel down and pick her up very gently.
"Where were you, Draco?" Blaise asked but Draco didn't answer and pulled away from the door. Two steps and then another and he dropped on the bed on his back and stared at the ceiling, wondering if it had just been a dream. It was so strange and Blaise and Pansy would laugh when he told them that there were different versions of himself and Potter in other dimensions and they were still obsessed with each other.
Harry was standing by the window in his study, looking outside. The weather was nice and he found himself wishing to go out with Draco. Draco had always loved to shop and they needed furniture for home as well as the academy. He wanted Draco to shop for clothes as well. Draco loved it and his face practically glowed with happiness when he purchased clothes for Harry and himself.
She can't let the carriages leave without her. She can't. Professor Snape won't let her see the end of it. The man is already too worried for her.
Draco moaned and trembled "Yes, yours. Only yours Harry. But what's the matter?"
"Okay... Harry." She murmurs and slowly places her head on his lap. She wants comfort and Harry can give that to her. He knows that she doesn't trust anyone else. How can she when her own father betrayed her like this.
Harry Potter.
Draco crossed his arms and glared at him defiantly "Ask her to leave. She has no right to interfere. Or maybe you still think that she does. You always did let them have a say in our matters."
Scorpius closes the door slowly and pushes his hands inside his pockets before walking towards the kitchen. He has taken only a few steps when a voice stops him in his tracks.
"Okay, darling." Harry teased and Draco was extremely annoyed by the warmth he was feeling in the pit of his stomach. Nevertheless, he glared at the green eyed man who was coming with a tray in his hand and was extremely amused.
Draco is entirely another story though. His mouth is open and his eyes are frozen on the child's face. She has bright green eyes and curly hair that are flowing down her back.
"HUSBAND. HUSBAND. HUSBAND. I AM FED UP OF THIS WORD. I HAD SENT THE DIVORCE PAPERS AND TILL DATE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED OF THEM. EMILY. EMILYYYY." Draco shouted and Harry was confused. What did Draco need his receptionist for?
"What happened to you?" Albus asks, alarmed. Why Scorpius decided to become an auror instead of a potions master is beyond him. He was always very brilliant in potions.
Irritated, he burrowed in Harry's arms and Harry mumbled "Go to sleep Draco."
"I told you that there's no point of this. No-body knows where they are." Scorpius mutters, exasperated. They have been arguing about this for a long time.
"Blinky." Draco shouted and the elf appeared, Sirius's bags in his hands.
"I told you." Scorpius looks at his boyfriend.
His voice is gentle but she still flinches almost violently.
She tries to back off by murmuring, "I'm sure that I'm fit, Mr. Potter."
"The weather is quite nice Harry. Let's go to that garden today. It's quite beautiful outside. Ron and Draco have never seen it before." Hermione murmurs, her brown eyes warm and wet.
Granger's fists tightened again. Her knuckles were really white.
She can't forget anything but she can try to heal. She had thought that no-body cared enough but it turns out that Potter does and so do his best friends. It was a surprise really, the way Granger kept on owling muggle story books to her and Weasley tried to contact her via floo. She heard that Severus has not stepped out of his lab for the past week, not even to meet Sirius, his new best friend.
And then Harry settles down beside her. He doesn't touch her or anything. He just settles down.
" Draco I am not angry at you. But you need to trust me. I am not going to leave - " Harry broke off because Draco was not sitting in front of him. He was behind Harry, his hands inside Harry's shirt and his lips on Harry's neck. Though Harry did not want to stop Draco, he knew that he must.
"How did you even know?" He asked and at this Dudley's eyes shown with pain.
Of course Harry was angry but he was angry at people who had hurt Draco. Why would he be angry at Draco at all?
have been captured. They -" and stopped. The door closed again and Draco slowly turned around and found himself staring into his own eyes - stunned silver eyes.
Before Draco could say anything, the woman had fled from the room, leaving them alone.
She smiled tightly and tried to pull away, only to be pressed against George who made no attempt to move away, instead wrapping an arm around her bare shoulders and squeezing her slightly.
Hermione hugs him and Ron squeezes his shoulder before turning towards James and Lily. Harry's throat feels tight. He misses them as much.
"EASY FOR YOU TO SAY THAT. HAD I CARED FOR POTTER AT ALL, HE WON'T HAVE BEEN A BLOODY DRUNKARD AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT. YOU DID NOT HAVE DUMBLEDORE-" He shouted father retorted furiously "OH! Please, Dumbledore did not lift a single finger to search Draco. I am quite sure that he led to-"
Draco frowned again but nodded and left the office. The last time Draco had seen Potter was after the trials. He had thanked him for speaking for his family in the court and had left the country. Except for the fact that Potter had three kids, one among whom was Albus Potter, Draco knew nothing about Potter. He knew a lot about Albus and James, though and the credit went to his son who had come out to him just a few months ago and had a huge crush on Albus and Teddy who liked Potter's eldest son quite a lot.
"You're not asking me to do anything. I'm doing this of my own accord." Harriet said, "And anyways, uncle Severus has taught me well. I can take care of myself."
Harry takes a deep and unsteady breath and then another and pulls back. He closes his eyes and then takes another deep breath and starts accepting it, like he has learned to accept everything else.
"You will kill me Potter. You will finish me off." The dark lord laughs and keeps on laughing until Potter conjures a sword.
Mr. Zabini suddenly tips his head and laughs hard before sneering, "As entertaining as this visit was, I won't involve myself in this madness
"Will you like your readers to know, Mr. Malfoy?" Asks Skeeter.
"Keep telling that to yourself." Severus spoke and Draco huffed angrily before resuming his walk, grumbling to himself "Stupid. Drunkard. Idiot. Can't let me live peacefully."
Dumbledore was standing behind the chair at the head of the table, his hands resting on the head rest. The Weasleys were there and so were the Longbottoms. The elder Malfoys were there. The Smiths, Mrs Zabini and Finnigans were there. The Flints, Browns and many more families were there and all of them seemed quite worried. The blast had affected so many families. It was sad but that's not what she was really worried about. All she wanted was to go back.
"I can't be sure. All I know is that we are-" Draco paused when he heard voices. They were nearing the great hall. Headmaster's office was on the second floor and Draco was sure that he would want to call upon a meeting after Draco told him exactly what he had seen.
"Severus, where is she - oh- Malfoy."
Harry shakes his head. He can't say it. Telling them the truth would mean that he has accepted it. It would make it real. Harry doesn't want it to be real. It can't be real. How can Draco do this? Why should Harry be the one to live through this on the top of everything else. Everything else like being hated by his only living relatives and being hunted by Voldemort every year. It's not fair.
"What do you mean?" Blaise asked quietly.
When Harry still doesn't reply, Ron finally looks up at him. His warm eyes widen when they fall upon Harry.
The next few days elapsed quietly. Potion making kept Draco distracted from depressing thoughts. He struck a deal with another coven of vampires and celebrated with Harry by going out for dinner.
Harry watches them apparate right in front of him and smiles at Draco and the Weasleys. He avoids Sirius's eyes entirely.
Harry experimentally parted Draco's hips and placed his fingers on his anus and suddenly Draco started shaking.
"I do trust you." Draco whispered and Harry stood up "You would tell me if you trusted me." Draco was about to stand but Harry snapped at him "Do eat your breakfast, Draco. You are already weak. I am coming with you, all right. Make of this what you wish."
"I don't know Harry. One mind says that I must seek revenge and another says that I do not want any kind of disturbance ever. I can't live with the feeling that I was demeaned, that I was manipulated to satisfy someone's personal motives. I can't accept it but I do not want to confront my own sins. I simply- simply do not know what to do." Draco whispered and as it happened, fate decided for him.
Having said this, Harry presses a soft kiss on his forehead and they starts getting ready for the day. To say that they had been shocked when Kreacher had appeared from no where in their room stating that Sirius was planning to capture Draco today using a coin as a portkey will be an understatement.
"Mr. Potter, how long do you plan to stand there and stare at me?" Comes a polite voice. Albus blinks and his cheeks feel warm as he glances into Draco's amused eyes. Draco is a charming man. However, he is also elusive and difficult. Albus doesn't know much about his private life but he has heard rumors about his flings. He has heard that Draco changes boyfriends like clothes. However, neither Witch weekly nor the Prophet are legit.
After a few minutes, Draco pushes back and looks at Harry with thoughtful eyes and replies, "I trust you. I know that you love me."
"That's
"Where is it?" Harry asked carelessly, acting as if wasn't a big deal.
The door opens and it takes a moment to control his mounting fury because it's Potter and she is the last person he wants to see right now. She might be Hogwarts' most loved professor but she's still as annoying and reckless as she was ten years ago. He wants to yell at her for the simple reason that he is angry but he knows that he mustn't. There is no dark lord to hide behind now. There is no justification to snap at the woman now, especially since she is no longer his student. She is a colleague now.
"I WANT MY DAUGHTER BACK." Her eyes are crazed. She looks mad at this moment and Lucius has often heard the tales of mothers going mad after their children die. Not that Lucius is faring better. He made a horrible mistake, a mistake that he doesn't know how to correct.
"What if Scorpius is her mate?" She asks, her eyes flat.
Ron and Hermione looked thunderstruck for a few moments.
His eyes were wet and Harry thought for the thousandth time that why had he never noticed that Draco needed him. He pulled back because there was no point in pressurising Draco. It was a big deal that Draco let him go this far. He stood their looking at Draco silently waiting for the breakdown.
Draco remains seated for a few minutes. He's sure that Severus will talk to Potter before leaving. He's curious and so he gets up and tiptoes towards the door.
Lucius breathes hard to stop the tears that are threatening to flow down his eyes. He shouldn't have refused Potter. He is a good match for Draco and Luicus had known that he loves Draco. Just because he is a Potter- how could he have been so stupid.
"It's over Harry. I was never suitable for you. You must chose a person well suited to you. I will get the divorce papers made again and send them to you tomorrow." Draco spoke and Harry's heart thudded violently and he committed a mistake. He took Draco's hands and held them tightly in his.
Draco took a deep breath to cool down "Bring the divorce papers I had asked you to lock,  immediately."
"But I know that it would make you uncomfortable." Harry argued. This was new. He had never argued for Draco's sake before. He had never tried to empathise with him.
Warm fingers wrapped around his own and the man's eyes softened as he murmured, "See that you don't. You can't miss the practice tomorrow if you want to play professionally."
"Aunt Petunia." He said and Dudley whispered "She has not spoken word since we uncovered dad's sins. This is the first time she has said a word."
"Hermione. I asked Ron to stay away for some days. Draco is not comfortable and we have not spoken yet." Harry snarled and Draco's eyebrows rose higher. Harry was disturbed but he was never so disturbed. The fact that he had not risen up to even open the door was evidence that Harry had changed a lot. "Please leave. I will owl you when Draco is ready. You should have owled before arriving. This is no way to-" Draco interrupted because Harry was snarling which was not good. "Harry, it's fine. Calm down. Wait in the sitting room, Granger. We will be out in a couple of minutes."
Harry held his hands in his again. Draco had pulled his hands back to insist upon his anger. Then Harry looked at him and sighed softly. Merlin, his eyes were so soft that Draco wanted to drown in them.
Narcissa couldn't help herself and knelt down to caress the child's cheeks.
"Draco, just listen to me for a moment ... You are being irrational and rash. Just-" He stops mid rant because someone very tiny slams on his legs. He looks and realizes that it's a little girl who immediately hides behind his legs and wraps her arms around them. He stares at her, shocked beyond belief. Children run away from him. They are supposed to be terrified of him. They are not supposed to hide behind him.
Harriet looked around the large staff room with cool eyes. The kids weren't there, unless they were hidden under the cloak somewhere which was okay if they were together. She trusted James and Teddy to take care of the lot of them. She wanted them to have a normal childhood. She wanted them to have a chance to be children and make mischief.
He had just finished the sentence when someone knocked on the door. Draco's eyes widened. Black's face lost its colour and he stared at the door with eyes that could barely conceal his horror.
"'It' as in." He asks.
Draco follows the plan and lets Sirius take him to 'The Three Broomsticks'. He opens his eyes and pastes fear on his face, murmuring, "Wha- where have you brought me?"
Hermione had completed the check up and was now sitting on the opposite chair "You can visit a mind healer for this and if you don't want to tell a third person about it, you can have sessions with Harry, that is if you feel comfortable with him. It is possible that you scream, or cry or break things to let it out so just let yourself be. Know that we understand. Your injuries are extensive. I can only imagine the extent of trauma you are in."
"Of course I spoke to him. He brushed me off. He was an insane man Draco-"
"Hmmm." Draco murmured and Harry's eyes shot open in shock when his hands clutched Harry's hair and his lips crushed Harry's. Sirius was still in the room and Draco was behaving as if the man had left.
His evening plans with Ginny are ruined by the detention she has with professor McGonagal. So, Harry finds himself sitting across Ron and Hermione. Fire is burning in the fireplace. It's warm.
Harry was slightly surprised. Had it always been so easy to cool Draco down? Why had he never accepted his mistake?
" It is better it remains hidden. He does not want you hurt. I fear that it is just a matter of time before you realize the truth. "
"Forgive me for wanting to love my husband Draco." Harry murmured, his voice low and controlled and his eyes boring into Draco's alarmed ones.
Dumbledore pulled his chair back and sat down, placing his one hand on the table and stroking his beard with the other. His blue eyes gave nothing away.
Harry's warm arms that wrapped around his body brought him out of his torture. It seemed that several hours had passed but actually it had just been a few minutes.
"Yes sir." The worker answered and he nodded "Tomorrow, we will do the library. It will take longer than today. "
Coming upon a stream, he stopped and started throwing pebbles in it, his mind whirling with the images of what could have been, had he been a normal human being. It would have been so bloody easier. Harry would have been happier. In fact, he did not have any right to stop Harry from having kids.
Harry's eyes were warm and full of desire, desire that was meant for Draco but when the shirt lay on the floor, he felt oddly naked and vulnerable. It felt like he should turn around to hide his bare front from Harry but he clenched his fists and looked at Harry who was simply looking into Draco's eyes with that intensity that had always made Draco shiver.
"Everyone needs to go to the staff room immediately. We will conduct all our meetings there," Draco said. The elder Weasleys stood up and left. They didn't say anything and didn't meet his eyes which proved at least one thing. They knew what was happening and were still supporting it. Charlie was standing against the wall in the corner of the room. His arms were crossed.
Harry replied, entering the room " I wanted to eat with you. Let me help you. "
"Useless tantrums, my ruddy arse. You are my husband and I have a complete right to be here. I AM NOT LEAVING." Harry shouted and Draco shouted right back at me "GET OUT. I HAVE A MEETING TO ATTEND. You have no bloody right to ruin my meeting."
"Come on. Get up." Ron says and forces Harry to get up. Ron takes out his clothes and helps him inside the bathroom. Harry heaves a mental sigh. Atleast, he has his friends.
But she is married and it's wrong to think of her like that. He opens his eyes, look around and follows her example by apparating in front of his house. He has some baking to do.
"Watch your steps Potter." Draco snaps and Potter doesn't even attempt to pull back. She is just standing there, breathing hard on Draco's shoulder like the bloody heathen she is. Having beautiful emerald eyes doesn't excuse this behavior. Running in the corridors. Honestly, is she five years old.
"Talk to Malfoy and fix a meeting. This is all I ask," she mutters, "Do this last thing for me, Snape. I'll always be grateful to you. You spent your life protecting me and I know I do not have any right to ask for more. But, do this for Ariana, please. This place is not safe for her."
But she doesn't wait. She walks forward and looks into his eyes. He had forced her to kneel down and had deep throated her. It had hurt so much and she wants to hurt him. She wants him to cry as she had done. By now, many people have gathered behind her and she takes a nail in one of her hands and places it on his left palm. Then she starts hammering the nails. He shouts as blood starts oozing from his palm and she doesn't stop. She starts hammering the nail in his right palm. Only when the nails are hammered and he is trembling with pain, does she stop.
When a hand tried to remove his hand from his face, he realized that Harry was still sitting in front of him.
Many a time, when Draco over worked at night, Harry had brought his breakfast in bed the next morning. He shared his achievements , his dreams with Draco and Draco was so happy with him. But the fact that he could not even give kids to him was eating him from inside. The longing that he saw on Harry's face to make love to him was killing him.
Harriet takes a deep breath. They are right. She knows that they are right but she has no other alternative.
Harry cleared his throat before continued before speaking, "I think Ginny is involved as well."
The last thought he had in mind was that Draco would kill him if he managed to live at all.
Not even once did Draco call him back or seek his help.
Harry did just that. He breathed and replied softly, looking into his eyes, his green eyes a bit sad, "I know. So am I. Let's go."
Vernon looks relieved as he says these words. The Malfoys follow him while Snape stares quietly at her.
"Castles do not get angry. Hogwarts is not sentient," Lavender muttered, confused, "Maybe, someone had tampered with the wards."
Draco stared at him with desperate eyes. There was a longing in Draco's eyes and Harry's heart ached for him. But he couldn't ask. Draco would not tell him.
He turned around and kissed Draco's forhead looking deep inside his eyes.
"Look, both of you are my fathers and it was my mistake for being an ignorant fool. Past is past and I have move- moved on. Mostly." Draco's stammer at the end gave him away and his father whispered softly "You can't even look at me. You can't even say it and you want me to believe it, Draco." Father spoke and Draco stayed quiet, looking at Severus with shame in his eyes. "Look at me Draco." Father said and Draco shook his head.
"Sure." She murmurs and looks at Harry. Harry smiles softly and Draco returns to her plate. Harry eyes well with tears as soon as Draco turns away and he breathes hard. Ron looks at him with sympathetic eyes and shakes his head a bit. Harry nods and starts eating too.
"Want you so much. Want to tie your hands and ravish you. " Draco murmured and Harry's cock twitched.
"What was it like?" Harry asked and Draco froze. "What was what like?"
“Please, Draco. It will be a nice change.” Harry requested for the last time.
As she wanted, he is crying but so is she. He is screaming and trembling and nothing except his screams can be heard in the room.
"Just touch it with your hand say 'Godric's hollow' and it will take you there. Once you reach there, it will turn into a normal bracelet. Please make yourself at home over there. I-" He stops and gets up before taking off his robe and placing it on her back. She holds her arm on either side and helps him put it on her. He buttons it up and then takes out something from his pocket. He flicks his fingers and it enlarges into a cloak.
"Stop bickering. Christ! You haven't changed at all." Harry looks incredulously at both of them.
"Ron, all these years... I had been so mistaken. I had always thought that he was an asshole and that he was prejudiced towards us. I had never even imagined... He must have suffered a lot. We must visit him." Hermione got up, her voice breaking and Ron shook his head "He needs time, Hermione. We must wait for Harry to contact us."
The hypocrisy of these people astounded him. A decade back, they had fawned over Harry and had cursed him to a place where his soul had been shattered into million pieces and today when he was successful, they were welcoming him with both arms.
"How are you feeling?" Harry asked after a couple of minutes and Draco looked at him before speaking "I am fine. How are you?"
Harry studied Lucius's posture carefully. His eyes seemed blank and his face was expressionless. His back was stiff and he was lost somewhere no one could reach him. Harry wondered if Lucius had loved his dad. He wondered why dad had led Lucius like this when he had not wanted any relationship with him.
Harriet stared at the window. This was the old potions classroom in which Snape had taught them. Harriet remembered how she glared at him and he glared right back and how he still helped her. She had not understood that he was not a villain. Ariana was much more perceptive than Harriet was at her age. Harriet did everything to keep the kids at a distance. She didn't know how Ariana was so sure that Harriet loved them.
He held no anger for Draco at all, his sweet Draco who was waiting for his reaction, Draco who trusted him so much who loved him so much because it required courage and trust to do this.
"It's all right Harry. I know. It's my decision. I love you." She says, answering his unasked question and he expels a breath he doesn't know he was holding. All the while, Draco stares at Harry with unreadable eyes, frozen at the same spot. A few moments later, Ginny pulls back and grins at him. He smiles back although he's sure it doesn't reach his eyes.
"Malfoy, mind your tongue." The man said, his eyes narrowed.
She goes through the motions, does what is required to live. She suffers from nightmares and starts casting silencing charms once Harry comes to help her.
Scorpius's resemblance to him was as astonishing as Ariana's resemblance was to Potter. Their relationship was ironic because Draco had not once spoken softly with Potter ever since they had met.
Lucius froze. His face became blank although his eyes betrayed his fear. Voldemort had always known that Lucius would never let Draco follow in his footsteps. So, it wasn't a surprise when the man said, "He's only a child, my lord. He doesn't mean to insult you."
He resumed his walk and stuck his hands in his pockets, thinking about his dream. Lily and Teddy had been so cute, so like Harry and him. He yearned for them. He had wanted to share the dream with Harry. He had wanted to show the dream to him through Leglimency but had decided against it since it would hurt Harry too much. The look that dawned on Harry's face whenever he looked at little kids had not escaped Draco's notice.
" I am humbled, Draco but I am your family and you don't need to thank me. Go to sleep. You need it." She whispered and left. Harry sat behind him and they heard a sob. She had kept her emotions carefully concealed all the while and Draco was surprised.
"You have stopped shopping altogether Potter. We are going tomorrow. We need clothes."
"All right. I will sleep with you." He mumbled and Harry closed his eyes in relief. It was not much but it was a starting. Britain would not destroy the little peace of mind Draco had gained over the past few days he had spent with him in France.
Severus struggled in his hold to go and punch father and when Draco did not let go, he shouted "He vanished, you bastard. He completely vanished. His wand had been snapped. I had no way to follow his magical signature even. What was I supposed to do?"
He hissed again and glared at the photos. A second later the letter and photos were burning from the effect of his fury.
"Lucius, tell him. He needs to know." It was Remus who said this. Lucius had been quiet for the past five minutes and Lucius looked at Remus, his eyes stunned.
Had Harry felt this helplessness when Draco had attempted to hang himself to death?
Without even waiting for Harry's reply, Draco walked towards his bar table and looked at the open bottle of his vodka. Harry's mouth burst open in shock when Draco picked up the bottle and dropped in on the floor. He just dropped it and the glass scattered everywhere.
that he loved Harry more than Harry loved him. He felt for Harry's breathe and heartbeats and thank merlin he was alive.
"Sorry." Harry whispered again but it wasn't enough and so he closed his eyes, wondering what would be enough. The last thing that he heard before sleeping was Draco's voice singing a soft lullaby to him.
"Of course, you must be tired. I will have Blinky take your bags in the guest room." Draco spoke with a phony smile on his face. Harry could see fire in Draco's eyes. It was so unlike the fear that had been there for the past few years that Harry was surprised and felt a glee run through him. Draco's eyes that were fixed on Sirius told him that he will destroy Sirius and his smile suggested that he was already planning.
"SHUT UP," Petunia screamed and stood up so suddenly that her chair fell back. She turned her face to look at Dudley but the boy wasn't here and then she suddenly realized that the smell had become stronger. It was unbearable now. She couldn't breathe and so she took deep breathes and covered her nose with her palm.
Two guards were standing close to the opposite railing. They offered her a bow before murmuring quietly, "Good morning, my lady." It was unusual for them to be guarding her room. Usually they took rounds all over the castle.
it. Of course, you haven't moved on." Father whispered, keeping his cold and angry eyes on Severus.
"Karma is a bitch isn't it Sirius? Now, you will pretend that you have captured me until Ginny has lowered her guards. I want her spit everything out. You will either do this quietly or we will get your sentence increased." Draco mutters curtly, his fingers pointed towards Sirius. A white light escapes them and suddenly Sirius starts having trouble breathing. Draco is furious and now that he has finally got the opportunity to take his revenge, he wants to punish this man.
"Potter." Draco mutters again.
"I will never do this again. Please wake up. Only once. Please forgive me for one last time. I promise, I swear not to repeat this again. I do not want to die. I want to live with you. Please get up." He begged, his voice breaking because their was a lump in his throat.
He was drinking his coffee and studying his notes of the variant of Wolfsbane he wanted to create when he heard his floo chime.
Draco opened his eyes and realized that he did not want to let Harry go. So he didn't. He stood in their living room, wrapped in Harry's warm arms. Harry placed his cheeks on Draco's head and murmured "We don't have to talk about this if you are not ready."
He shut his mouth abruptly as if he was about to say something and stopped himself.
"Okay. Dad is in the basement. I had locked him down." Dudley spoke, his eyes gleaming with hatred for his father, "Whatever you do with him, do let Tessa and me witness it. She needs closure and I need to see him punished for what he did to both my cousin and daughter. He deserves nothing short of an agonising death.
Harry said that his godfather should have been free to take care of him instead of getting himself imprisoned.
Draco was sure that it was 2019 when he had left Hogwarts just ten minutes ago. After Potter had left the hall, Draco had left for the ministry along with Blaise. Until yesterday evening, Kingsley Shacklebolt was the minister of magic and
"I am leaving, Harry and leave me be. Move on. You are still young and can find a suitable man for you. He won't be broken like me. He won't require your cuddling like I did or your reassurances." Draco spoke and turned around to leave, walking quickly.
"Well, I don't." Harry replied testily and Draco gritted his teeth in annoyance "You will sign them."
"Your father is an idiot. I asked him for his permission to date you. I wanted his blessings because I knew you would never go against his wishes and he refused. Had he accepted my request, this would never have happened. Now I don't know what to do. I can't see your pain but I can't heal it and I can't make it go away. " He doesn't know why he is confessing all this. Of course she won't believe him. Her own father betrayed her and Harry had merely been her nemesis.
"But why did you stop. What happened after that- the diary- what was it's purpose? I really spoke to an image of Riddle in the chamber of secrets. What was it then, if not the real horcrux and why will Voldemort lead me to the chamber of he knew that I will kill the basilisk."
She looks so relieved that Harry's heartbeats quicken. What happened here just before Harry entered? Dad won't. Harry knows his father. Dad is not one those men. He won't. Maybe Malfoy misunderstood dad's intentions or maybe Harry misunderstood the entire situation. He will just clear the misunderstanding and reject the role like he had decided.
He punched the wall in frustration. Draco did not want to step even a foot out of this place. For the millionth time, he cursed the bastards who had led to all this, to seven pits of hell.
He looks silently at her. There is something in his gaze that she doesn't like. She can't exactly explain it but he is making her uncomfortable.
"But, Harry-" He started and Harry shouted at him "I can take care of it. Why are you arguing with me?" Draco stared, stunned. Why would Harry behave so aggressively? Harry was hiding something and he won't tell Draco unless he feels comfortable so Draco backed off "Okay. If you need help-"
"I can't let you drown yourself in alcohol, Harry. That's just- how- how can you expect me to let you die?" She replied and abruptly stood up "I am sorry but you are forcing me to take the matters in my hands. I have let it go long enough. You would disapprove but you can disapprove all you want. I don't care."
"It'll be fine, Pansy," Blaise said, attempting to comfort her and failing because Pansy's expression didn't change. Draco wondered what exactly she had seen but didn't ask. Blaise gazed at Draco as they walked inside the castle.
Draco might want to bury his anger behind a veil of terror and insecurity but Severus knew. Severus knew that it was just a matter of time. His fury will show itself again.
Dudley who had treated him as his punching bag most of his childhood walked towards him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Why did he not shove it off? He was here to rescue a child, not forgive his relatives.
"His manor is warded. It's not a child's play. The horcruxes are destroyed but he is very powerful. He will need only a minute to call death eaters. You will need help. If he kills you, then no-one will be able to save Draco. He will turn her into a slave. He will destroy her. Do you want that?" Snape asks, his dark eyes boring into Harry's. His hands are digging in Harry's shoulders, compelling him to listen to the man. Harry realizes that he is breathing hard and that he is angry. He also realizes that his fingers are trembling.
Harry lays back down on the grass and stares up at the dark sky. He loves Draco. He loves Draco so much that it's frankly terrifying and right now he is very worried for his boyfriend. He wonders why he was summoned by his parents on such a short notice. The stars are hidden somewhere behind the black cloud that is stretched above. Harry closes his eyes and tries to imagine that Draco is beside him, playing with his hair or grumbling about mundane things. Harry could spend a lifetime gazing into his intoxicating eyes.
"Your fault, Malfoy-" Weasley starts in an equally cold voice, "- is that you exist."
"Eat a little. I will ask the elves to bring our dinner here." He presses softly and she looks at him.
"You don't beat him up," he asked and Lucius shook his head.
The policemen had to intervene to stop them from killing the bastard on the spot. Aunt petunia had not wished to see her husband so she had not come with them. He had returned with a lighter heart and a happy Tessa. She seemed content and looked at her father with a newly found respect.
But now is not the time to ask them. So she nods slowly and whispers,"Godric's Hollow. "
Draco tried to keep his anxiety away from his face but he couldn't because Harry asked him cautiously "Is something the matter?" Draco cleared his throat and walked to sit on the chair beside Harry's bed "Some Vampire delegates are arriving from Britain tomorrow."
"Mr. Mawfoy, I want to see your white peacocks and gardens." Little Harry says with a small pout of his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm busy right now," He says, trying to keep his voice steady, trying not to let his anger overpower him.
"Dr- Draco." He whispered again because their were no words to explain his thoughts.
The last sentence relieved Harry. This meant that Draco would stay in his room. Atleast Draco would try and that was enough for now.
"BECAUSE," Vernon started shouting and then stopped and took a deep breath and continued in a low voice, "Because Harry's dead body is still rotting inside that bloody cupboard. Closing the bloody door to our old bloody house won't stop the smell from spreading."
Harry looked to see the sender's name and Draco saw the faint tremble in Harry's hands and he felt rage emanating from his body.
"Harry, I am sor-" Draco started speaking and walked towards him. Harry simply lifted his hand to stop his husband.
Were they blind that they never saw the denial in eyes or deaf that they never heard his cries of pain and pleas of mercy?
Harriet didn't answer and aunt Sierra walked forward to face her. She was a tall, lean woman with sharp eyes and flawless skin. Her shoulders were high and proud and except for a peach lipstick and a thin line of blue eyeliner, she wore no make up. She was dressed in a night gown. Her eyes were dry like Harriet's despite the pain that shined in them. Besides being an adoptive sister, she was one of the three best friends father had.
They were close and Draco just had to lean a bit to take Harry's lips in his. He wanted to kiss Harry so much. It seemed that an age had passed since they had kissed.
"Shhhh. Sleep. Soon it will be fine. I am taking you to your bedroom. Shhhh." It's almost like he is hypnotizing Harry. The last thing that he hears is Aunt Petunia's gasp and pained scream.
"He's right, Draco. You must compel him to confide in you. You're the brain behind the time turner. Too much is at stake now. You can't back off." Hermione sighs.
"YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE POTTER." Weasley shouted and they stared. "GINNY WILL NEVER DO SO. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOMEONE WAS POLYJUICED AS HER."
"We don't have time mate." Ron whispers, his eyes sympathetic and triumphant.
Draco keeps on staring at the ceiling. The room is boring with dull walls, an old dresser and a bed and an attached bathroom. But it's better than azkaban and the streets. Draco doesn't know how much time has passed since he came- maybe ten minutes- fifteen. Potter has not come yet. There are no house elves and Draco is hungry and thirsty. What's he supposed to do now?
Harry shook his head silently and averted his eyes towards the ceiling.
"Is it time?" Scorpius asks in a low voice.
"My aunt hated me and I was a burden on her. I was small when my parents died and she was angry that she had to tend to me. Many a time, she tried to drown me to vent out her frustration while bathing me. My accidental magic came to my aid. That is why I snapped at you. I can't tolerate it. I am sorry." Harry spoke, his eyes on his hands and Draco was speechless. How could anyone try to drown a defenceless baby?
He's no longer the scrawny teenager Draco had studied with. He has broad shoulders and a lean but muscled frame. His still frame emanates power, both physical and magical as well as danger. His skin is healthy and his lips are full and red. His hair is still as atrocious as ever.
Now, how would Draco live without him?
The moment they appeared in their room, Harry noticed it. Draco had been putting an act in front of Sirius. Draco dragged Harry to the nearest wall and all but slumped in his arms.
His words give her the strength she needs to confront everything. Right from the starting, everyone saw her as a spoiled girl. She was the only child of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. She was the only one who would inherit his vast empire. According to them, Lucius Malfoy doted on his daughter. They believed that Lucius would do absolutely anything to keep his daughter safe. They believed that amongst her parents, her father loved her the most.
