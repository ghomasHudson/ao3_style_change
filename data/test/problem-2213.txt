Harry wears his heart on his face, and every line of it speaks of love– more love than Scorpius can imagine what to do with. It’s enough of a caress, all that love washing over him, and for the first time, a lump rises in Scorpius’ throat.
Harry’s moving before he registers it, darting out to catch Draco’s wrist this time, his other arm curving around Draco’s slim waist until the other man is standing pressed against him, face etched into an expression of confused surprise as he stares down the three extra inches he has on Harry.
“Have you told your friends about me?” Draco asks. His friends know. He knew they’d find out from the very moment Pansy had shown up on the doorstep of his room, wand tucked into her hair, looking sharp and observant as she took in Draco’s every move. They’d written to him, some longer missives—Blaise’s rambling eloquence spilling into a three part letter, Astoria’s detailed descriptions of her year at Hogwarts, a couple paragraphs dedicated to wishing him well—some short, barely a line—Theo’s ‘good for you’ and Millicent’s ‘Finally’.
He leaves out everything that not being wanted dredges up, he leaves out the part where leaving will shatter his soul, he leaves out the part where all he wants to do right now is wrap Draco in his arms, fall back into bed and go to sleep without thinking of tomorrow and what fresh horrors it might bring. He leaves out that he was dying and all he could do was stare at a wall.
And Harry can’t help but kiss him, taste those glorious words on his own tongue, claim those lips again. And again. And again.
Draco knows all too well about the war and the headfuckery it likes to perform, so he nods in acknowledgment and says nothing.
“The prosecution may cross-examine the witness,” Kingsley’s voice booms through the room. Oh right. They’d almost forgotten that part.
They were all just people once, trying to live their lives, trying to work the kinks of their minds and complicated thoughts out through art. Somewhere in these streets, Michelangelo probably had his first kiss. And then, he had not been Michelangelo, world famous artist and sculptor, he had probably been a shy boy with a crush. Somewhere on these streets, Dante had probably tripped on a loose stone and cursed himself out to the shock of passersby.
“Humans are complicated,” Death observes, and Scorpius laughs. It’s a harsh, bitter sound and he wonders how it hasn’t ripped through this fragile fabric between his world and his parents’. Though in truth, it isn’t quite that hard to understand– if his existence was to rip through their bubble, it would have happened when he was alive.
The reference to what was coming hadn’t hurt Scorpius, merely surprised him. Relieved him even, that his father had accepted he was going to die without the fanfare that usually accompanied these things.
Right now, the two arcs of his thought collide, combine, thread themselves together into a bittersweet surge of melancholy for everything that could have been and everything that is.
one of the trio to receive that level of honour given the fact that Potter has a well aimed disarming spell to his name and Weasley is… well, Weasley.
Draco notes the way Potter studiously avoids looking at her when he shakes his head, his jaw clenched.
He knocks on Harry’s door, heart beating fast with anticipation, remembering what had happened the last time he had been in this position. But instead of Harry opening the door, a slurred voice calls from within, “Gooo ‘way, ‘Mioneee. ‘M gettin’ drunk off my arse and you can’t stop meee.”
The pressure on his wrists startles him. The fog has thickened, the world is swimming. And then a voice cuts though it, “Breathe with me, Malfoy. One, two, three…”
‘That’s a good boy,’ Draco murmurs and the words seep into him like warmth on a cold winter morning, comforting him, cocooning him and making him impossibly harder.
“I spoke to a Healer after the War and she said I had something called PTSD. I didn’t go to her again so I never found out how to deal with it or even what it was. I just… went coasting and hoped it would be fine.” He hesitates before saying, “Maybe sometimes even hoping I would be anything but fine.” Draco’s hand tightens in his, whether in solidarity or empathy, he doesn’t yet know. Perhaps both. “I went again after what happened here. Luna asked me to. The man I went to said it was PTSD as well. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, they call it. Almost everyone has it after that damned War, but mine manifests as the sort of extreme violence you saw the other day. I have triggers that I don’t even know about because of my… childhood. Something about repressed memories. And I still need to figure out who I am outside of Voldemort. Outside of the boy who killed him twice and fought him too many times to count and disarmed him in a battle. I need to be Harry and I can’t deal with expectations.”
Draco glances at her. She looks frazzled– hair all over the place, fingers drumming nervously along the tabletop.
He knows Harry might be lying, but he chooses to believe the contrite words spoken into the air between them like a gasp of a prayer from a man on his journey back to the church, and feels something coiled tight and angry unwind just a little.
Potter’s eyes are as green as they’ve ever been, but something in their intensity has shifted so fundamentally that Draco surreptitiously adjusts himself in his seat, discomfited by the unfamiliar attention.
“I’m safe,” Harry says and Draco startles. It’s a reference to an evening neither of them really speak about. He can tell Draco hadn’t expected it. But it’s an important reminder: Draco promised him safety and this is Harry trusting Draco to make good on it.
His body is cold by the time Draco draws his head into his lap, screaming his name, pushing his magic into Harry’s core, begging him to be revived.
She fire-calls the shop and over the crackling connection they find out Pig is out. “There’s a Ministry owl George has hired for a few days, should I send him?”
Malfoy looks away, eyes fixed on a portrait frame on the far wall. “It’s the master bedroom, specially designed for—er. Couples. My parents stayed there, during our time here.”
Draco clears his throat and Harry meets his eyes. “About what Pansy said…” he says, flushing a little pink.
Harry feels the guilt that hadn’t quite woken up yet make a furious comeback in every fibre of his being.
“You’re certain?” he asks, and for once two decades of ceaseless training in the art of Pureblood facades comes into use as he schools his features into an imperturbable mask. He meets Harry’s eyes, and whatever’s left of his heart screams and beats a feeble rhythm against the walls Draco is throwing up around his emotions, but he ignores it in favour of maintaining eye contact.
Draco sighs. “Not so much that as… we went once, when I was six. Mother, Father and I. I just want to… see the place again.” He looks away. “We were happy,” he mumbles, unsure how the words will be received. Have courage, Draco. Speak the truth.
He can barely open his eyes, but he feels Draco pulls off and gently kiss his thigh before spelling the bonds off.
“Well you have spent two days wallowing in misconceptions here and he has been drowning in drink so I don’t know what he wants right now but I would assume so, yes. He wants it. Now, Malfoy, would you please come with me and set the record straight?”
Potter hesitates. Draco picks up on something he isn’t saying. “Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas’ memories have been submitted. As have Ginevra Weasley’s, from the times Mr Malfoy was summoned to torture members of the underground resistance group within Hogwarts—Dumbledore’s Army.”
tradition once it crosses the second generation mark. But there isn’t a tradition in the world that exists… arbitrarily. They have to start somewhere.”
“Now, then,” Harry begins, his hand moving down Draco’s bare chest. It comes to rest on a nipple. “Fucking feels like flying.” He yanks hard on the nipple, making Draco arch and gasp loudly at the unexpected pain. “The rush, the idea that you can do anything, be anywhere.” He reaches down and sucks the nipple into his mouth. “That feeling of sliding in, feeling lube and warm flesh against your dick, feeling the clench and the slide,” he licks the abused flesh gently, “the give of the muscle, the hole widening around you.” He moves to the other nipple.
Something rears its ugly head in the pit of his stomach and he clenches his fist against the surge of annoyance and anger that rises up within him. He knows he shouldn’t be this angry over open curtains or with Hermione or about
Harry nods as best as he can without raising his head or moving it too much. He can’t decide what is more exhausting– moving his aching head or speaking with a sore, raw throat.
“Don’t Anne Frank me after this,” he would joke, laughing a little before coughing up blood. “I don’t want the Wizarding World judging my goodbyes. Promise me, Father.”
Draco watches the Weasleys slump over the body of their fallen brother with a sick twist in the pit of his stomach. The brood-mother—Molly, he corrects himself, wincing, is bent over her son’s chest, sobbing uncontrollably into a chest that will not swell with breath again. The father has his son’s head cradled in his lap, tears falling freely down a face lined and shadowed with immeasurable pain.
He looks towards the runes which had gotten him into this mess in the first place. The panic rears its ugly head.
With one finger, he traces the rim of Draco’s cup, before lifting it and putting it on the table under a warming charm, where Draco will be sure to see it the minute he steps into the kitchen.
“Harry, Ron and I. We’re living together you see, it’s all still a bit chaotic what with Fred… the Burrow isn’t somewhere the three of us wanted to land up in, Molly has enough on her plate after all and- I’m sure you don’t care at all but it’s, well, Harry lost his owl a while back, Hagrid gave him the owl before first year, he was quite attached, and now he refuses to buy a new one so Ron and I, we don’t–”
“Have you eaten something?” Harry asks, and Draco is so distracted that he doesn’t even register the question. It’s only when Harry pokes him sharply in the rib that he actually startles and asks Harry to repeat.
Maybe they actually will leave this time, he muses. He can’t hold on to them after this. But in one last act of desperation, he opens his eyes fully and looks at Luna. She sits their, serious and contemplative– honest, kind, sweet Luna who has just told him he needs to be restrained to not hurt his friends.
She shakes her head. “No, I don’t want to but until I get it out, I’m going to die on the inside.” She chokes over her next few words, “After all it was my fault.”
Malfoy men have dragon heartstrings, the voice in Draco’s head that sounds exactly like Lucius tells him when he stares down at his trembling fingers. It is almost six in the evening and Draco has thrown on navy robes and brushed his fingers through his hair. He thought of taking a shower but dismissed the idea as unnecessary and requiring too much effort in the afternoon. He regrets that now, grimacing as his fingers drag through matted, stringy hair. He’s in dire need of a bath, he hasn’t taken one since… he can’t even remember the last time. But the only way to look presentable in company will be to salvage whatever is left of his hair for now and for that he… needs to look in a mirror.
“Do you understand?” they whisper, and the voice this time isn’t the steady, indefinite one he’s grown accustomed to hearing, but a soft echo of thousands of voiced whispering low. “Do you understand what happens when you leave this place?”
Harry can feel the heat rise. ‘I wanted to try something, once. About three years ago. I bought it from a shop that… sold those kinds of things and I brought it here. I thought I’d bring you here too but then it just, um, never happened.’
Harry rises on his forearms, looming over Draco with all the elegant grace of a coiled panther and it is at this juncture of their sojourn that Draco realises Harry is still fully dressed.
“Right.” He swallows past the lump in his throat. He doesn’t know why she bothers to look after him the way she does. It’s her and Ron holding him together, he knows. If they left, he would fall to pieces, come undone like parchment in the rain.
Draco thinks. He thinks of the memories pressing against the walls of the boxes where he has placed them and locked them, wanting to break out, create havoc.
McGonagall had thought he wanted to visit Dumbledore’s tomb after Scorpius’ death for emotional purposes. A soul seeking talk with a more familiar tombstone. She’d asked, with a withered hand pressed against his shoulder if he would like to speak to the portrait in her office. He’d shaken his head, and hadn’t even had to ask for privacy when she had nodded and walked away.
He takes the slip confirming he is of sound mind to Malfoy’s barrister and says, “I’m testifying for him.”
“I’m not lonely,” he says, looking pointedly at Harry who blinks and then smiles. “I’m not lonely at all.”
desire mud in our blood. But, surely you’re not forgiving me for calling you… what I did and tormenting the Weasel- Weasley the way I did and Potter, fuck, Potter- surely you expect more from me- you haven’t forgiven me and the Aurors haven’t forgiven me-”
Harry’s hands return to Draco’s hips and Draco wonders if there will be finger-shaped handholds on them by the time Harry’s done with him. He hopes there are. He hopes there’s a claiming mark on his body for him to stare at in the mirror on the mornings he wakes up alone and covered in come and bruises and a sense of bone-deep shame.
“He said he’d think about being the Master of Death when the time came to die for the last time,” Scorpius recalls, thinking back to when Skeeter had published her piece with insurmountable proof and comments from ‘reputed resources’. Head Auror Proudfoot had asked Harry Potter to issue a formal statement regarding the claims to keep the rumours from spiralling out of control. That means…
The gates rise tall and forbidding. Even without having reached the house, the unwelcome air of the property strikes Harry. After having the Horcrux in him removed, his sensitivity to dark magic has increased. The best way Harry could explain to Hermione what he was feeling when he couldn’t bring himself to enter the attic of Grimmauld was to tell her that it was something similar to being a recovering alcoholic in a bar. She had nodded and set to cleaning the attic with Ron and Harry had rushed back to his room, darkened it and stared at the ceiling for four hours. And now, the Manor, a stronghold of dark, ominous magic a few feet away is making Harry’s stomach churn in a way that makes him want to Apparate as far away from there as possible. But Hermione’s tear streaked face and her voice telling Harry she’s leaving flashes in his mind’s eye and he raises his hand to the gate hesitantly.
Healer Choudhury is a small witch in beige robes with a kind face who smiles reassuringly at Draco when he calls. When he explains the situation, the smile drops and she looks grave. “Oh dear, I’ll be in in a minute. Tell Hermione I’m on my way, won’t you?”
Potter, in perfectly plebeian fashion, climbs knee first onto the duvet and sits cross legged on the edge of the bed. In the pool of moonlight that seems to drape over him like a veil of light, he looks as young as he is.
Harry stares down at where his latest purchase of Gillyweed is rolling merrily into the gutter. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Malfoy’s surprised face go from neutral to increasingly horrified as he takes in the detritus of Harry’s last-minute shopping spree.
“I’m not airing my dirty linen in front of this ponce. I wish you’d told me before, I’d have called in the Aurors.”
Even now, when the flush of exertion extends down to his abdomen, his hair mussed, his mouth open in ecstasy as he rides Harry’s cock, Draco looks ethereal.
“Six months of my history, another six of yours,” Draco responds slowly. Something in Potter’s expression darkens and then clears. Draco clears his throat. Slides his own hand across the table to grip Potter’s. It’s warm and a little dry and his prior observation of Potter’s palms being large is reaffirmed so heavily that Draco’s brain fizzes and sparks like a hex before his senses acquiesce to stop making an absolute fool of him.
Draco knows his eyes have widened significantly. He wonders how he doesn’t have vision encompassing the whole room from how stretched the corners of his eyes feel, but everything has been consumed by Harry.
“Would you like to hear the Malfoy answer or my answer?” he asks her carefully, after a few moments of internal turmoil as to how exactly one replies to such a comment from someone like Granger.
Malfoy scowls at her and Harry initially prepares himself to throw Malfoy out again for saying something insulting about Hermione but instead he primly says, “Since you’ve been so kind, I do believe it would be rude of me to turn you down.”
In dreams, Harry is happy, and in life he is not, so Harry measures time in light and darkness and the space between them is filled by relief.
“Hands off,” he hears Harry murmur. Slowly, gradually, he slides down the length of Draco’s body, lips and tongue tracing and kissing and sucking down the expanse of Draco’s chest. There’s a distinct pattern for Harry’s ministrations and when he raises himself on his elbows as best he can to look down at Harry, the sight makes him gasp.
‘What do we do about these?’ Draco asks, and Harry flushes red and hot from embarrassment and arousal. He wants to reach out, run his hands through Draco’s hair, pull that gorgeous mouth onto his cock and fuck it raw but Draco’s in control now and despite the squirming impatience, there’s something about this total relinquishing of his autonomy that feels comfortable.
“No,” he says, reigning himself in. “No,” he says louder, noticing with mounting panic that Gianni is spiralling. “No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so very sorry. Here,” he says, holding up the glass of water in Gianni’s face. “Here, thank you, I am drinking.”
“Deal,” he says, and wonders how he’s supposed to pretend for a year that Potter’s smiles don’t set him on fire.
“Why did you even have that much whisky in your room?” Harry can’t tell from his tone of voice if he is in for getting his arse handed to him on a platter or merely about to satisfy Draco’s latent curiosity.
Harry holds up a sheaf of papers. “She had these ready,” he says. Draco doesn’t need to read the words on them to know they are divorce papers.
“Yes,” Harry says, wondering why people keep asking him that. He’s not a child, he’s allowed to make whatever decisions he pleases. “Yeah, I. Since we’re both leaving and all. It might be best to have a drink and—” He scrubs a hand over his face. “Leave the past in the past.”
Malfoy visibly swallows again and braces himself. He drags his tongue over his chapped lips, over the bleeding cut on the edge that Harry can see clearly now. His eyes are lacklustre and his face is drawn. “The Dark Lo– Voldemort came to live in our house. The task I was set in sixth year and I realised that no matter what, there is no glory here. We were servants, we were servants to a madman, a lunatic, a–a rapist. And I couldn’t believe my father anymore. I took the Mark to save him, to save Mother. To save the Manor. And I thought, if my father had been wrong about the Dark Lord, he could have been wrong about Muggles. Wrong about Muggle-borns. Wrong about you.”
He doesn’t know why anyone else would offer. His father is locked away in another cell somewhere in this godforsaken place, his friends are Slytherins with vague loyalties or Dark Marks on their own arms, and therefore more likely to character assassinate him with any testimony. Not that half of them would agree—Goyle stopped speaking to him since the day he finally managed to accept that Crabbe wasn’t coming back, Theo is holed up in his Manor, depressed and drunk, Blaise doesn’t care and Pansy… Pansy would probably tell the jury to fuck off. And then they’d both be thrown back into this shithole with each other for company, and wouldn’t that be a pretty picture, Pansy calling the warden
For some reason, he keeps that knowledge to himself when they both emerge, freshly showered, from their rooms to spend the afternoon walking around Firenze, soaking up its bustling charm. There’s something secretively intimate about knowing the curses Potter whispers under his breath to himself, the tunes of the songs he hums in his space, the quiet sighs when he loosens the bindings of his shoes and the soft thud of them skidding across the floor and hitting the opposite wall.
Recovering from his shock, Draco quickly assesses the situation. Granger is quite possibly having some sort of anxiety attack because capable witch that she is, she is sitting on the floor, hands around her ears, knees pressed against her chin, rocking to and fro like a scared child and screaming. Weasley doesn’t seem to be here at all, his eyes faraway, his forehead bleeding and weird bruises forming on his arms where his sleeves have ripped to expose skin. Potter has for all intents and purposes gone absolutely insane.
“A good enough reason for violating consent? For not even asking for it? What are you on about, Weasley? I would think with Granger as your girlfriend, you would know there aren’t any good enough reasons for things like that.” When Weasley remains conspicuously silent, he goes on, “I’m not going to apologise. I’m going to apologise and hope that one day he can look at me without wanting to spit in my face.”
He remembers falling into bed with Draco, limbs intertwining, bodies flushing and the stones on their rings gleaming like each other’s eyes.
When a familiar pattern catches his eye on the carved mantel, Draco leans over, curiosity propelling him forward. It is made of dark, expensive wood, covered from top to bottom in runic calligraphy. There are ancient runes there which he itches to translate, run his palm over and appreciate thoroughly before he has to leave wherever Granger has seen fit to bring him. It is the type of exquisiteness one finds in old pureblood Wizarding furniture. Draco isn’t sure how any of the trio came across this place but if the rest of the pieces in the house are this beautiful, Draco envies them.
Draco’s jaw hardens. Steel slips into his eyes– it’s practically indiscernible unless one knows what to look for. He stands, sweeping the empty whisky glass up from the table with his left hand, extending his right.
“But here—in Florence, if you were to make every place where an artist who is now world famous, where a creator who left the world a legacy set foot into a museum, the common folk wouldn’t be able to live anywhere. They’d be on the streets, but even the streets were walked by those people. Makes you think, doesn’t it?”
“I’m pulling the Malfoy funds,” Draco had said, leaning back in the armchair. “This doesn’t seem like a well thought out investment to me.”
Harry interjects with a hurried, “I’ve always wanted to,” before the words settle into his brain and he realises the extent of the truth to them. He’s
This villa is the opposite. The sun shines down on the limestone carvings above the arched windows, glinting off the regal white exterior of the building. Ivy twines its way around the girth of magnificently carved pillars that lead to an ornate doorway which seems to indicate the act of gaining entry to be more stately an affair than Harry has ever considered it to be.
He stares until he can’t, until there are tears running down his cheeks from the corners of his burning eyes. He stares until his body can’t hold him up anymore and he sways on the bed, arms useless by his side, quaking as shivers wrack their way through him.
Harry gets up as quickly as his shaking legs allow and Draco almost drops the cup he’s holding at the sudden movement. He walks over to Draco slowly, giving him the space and the time to back away if he wants to but Draco doesn’t. Instead he stands there, the coffee cup shaking in his unsteady hands, his eyes widening with every step Harry takes towards him.
, the touch seems to say. Maybe Draco’s reading too much into it, but what Harry doesn’t know can’t hurt him and what Harry doesn’t feel can definitely hurt Draco, but Draco ceased to care a while ago.
Weasley takes two very deep breaths and says, “You’ve got it all wrong. Yes, I agree, before kissing someone, you should ask them if they are okay with it, if you should do it. But you didn’t. But here’s the deal, Malfoy, Harry wanted it. He wanted it again. And again. And again. And instead, you ran away like he had burned you so he thought the worst. That you had made a bad, impulsive decision and regretted it immediately.”
“Are they…” Death begins, and breaks off. Scorpius looks up, wondering if it’s hesitancy or second thought, only for Death to look generally perplexed across his changing appearances, as though grasping for words that aren’t there. “Are they…” they begin again, “intimate with
“Well, I’m questioning your intelligence because as far as I can see, there’s a Death Eater holding a–
“Draco Malfoy’s father is Lucius Malfoy, a man known to hold deeply prejudiced, dangerous and misguided notions about Muggle-borns and half-bloods. Lucius Malfoy placed Ginevra Molly Weasley’s life, when she was eleven years old, in extreme danger by acquainting her with a Dark Artefact wherein she gained access to a part of Tom Riddle’s mind. In the well-known battle of the Department of Mysteries, where my godfather Sirius Black passed away, Lucius Malfoy displayed no qualms when attacking students far less magically proficient than him with Dark Curses. I was there. I saw the man. I am more than certain that his disregard for the lives of vulnerable children extended to the one in his own home.
Draco’s eyes darken. “Everything,” he says, and Harry wonders, for one spectacularly wild moment if anyone back home in Britain is imagining in their wildest dreams that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are about to spend the night together.
Draco raises his own glass of whisky to his lips and takes a swig. The Muggle drink is refreshing in a way the potent burn of Firewhisky isn’t.
“Have you eaten?” Harry asks, an exasperated edge to his voice. “From the way you look, I doubt you’ve consumed anything except generous whisky servings in the past twenty-four hours.”
There was also the matter with his own mind, the struggle he’d been on the verge of losing that whispers constantly, even now, that he doesn’t deserve a shorter sentence or a gentler one, but he isn’t about to admit that to his self-righteous barrister whose condescending blinking drives Draco to teeth-grinding frustration.
The cat’s head shaped bell jingles when they push open the door and Luna looks up from the counter with a wide smile. It assumes a delighted edge when she spots them and her soft voice turns a shade excited when she calls out, “Ginny, Draco, it’s lovely to see you!”
“I’ve missed you,” Scorpius says in a rush. “I had to watch Father and you all this while, since I–”
It’s agonising, taking in street names and trying to avoid oncoming trams and traffic while being so thoroughly distracted by a man who seems to be completely unaware of the effect he’s having on Harry. And while Harry appreciates the fact that Malfoy seems to have no inkling of the kind of thoughts Harry harbours for him, he wishes Malfoy would tone down the lascivious and apparently completely unintentional swing of his hips if only for the sake of road safety.
They fall back, almost seamlessly after that into teasing touches, hot and promising kisses and sharp, possessive bites. It’s almost as if nothing has changed but with every breath Draco takes with Harry’s citrus shampoo scented hair teasing his nostrils, he feels a little more of his world morph and narrow down to the gorgeous creature in his arms.
Her Scottish accent warmed something, albeit nostalgic, in Remus, who took the ginger biscuit from the ceramic plate, and dipped it in the tea.
"Why not? Are you okay? What happened?" Hermione sounded slightly panicked now, while Ron looked suspicious, and kept glancing back at the Slytherin table.
But something inside him, deep inside, didn't want it to be like this. Something inside Draco wanted him to run away.
"And you think telling Dumbledore that Harry sneaked into Hogsmeade, while Sirius Black's been running around, and ran into an adult pub's going to keep him from trouble?"
"What- he doesn't- what?" Ron's face was so distorted, it was funny. Hermione suppressed a grin, and hit him lightly on the back of his head.
"Potter and Malfoy, please follow me," he said in a somewhat tired and exasperated voice, lined with disappointment. Draco had been weirded out by the professor, to say the least, in the past. He'd come up to Draco and asked about his home life more than once now, which was slightly scary.
Rubbing at his eyes, he somehow managed to elegantly fall onto the bench. The familiar fluttering of wings could be heard, as the light smell of owls swooped down from above. Letters were falling, and Draco looked pointedly at his plate as faces around him lit up in excitement or interest.
The two of them sat behind Harry, who didn't seem to have noticed a thing. Hermione drew the paper from her pocket, and stared sympathetically at Harry, who seemed so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't heard them. But after exchanging a look with Ron, she tapped him on the shoulder, and flinched as he gave a start.
But the euphoria was shattered by a deep voice calling his name, and as Draco jerked his head to see, a dark figure in long robes slowly approached him.
Huddling students were grouped up everywhere, and the Gryffindor table was in frenzy, with everyone talking rapidly among themselves. All the noise and muttering was much louder than usual, and even the teachers were mostly absent, Filch trying to keep order.
"Why don't you try and tell me first. I'm sure we can help you, but first, it'd be easier to say it out loud."
Breaking away from the kiss almost felt like reawakening. His mind was clear, though the rest of him was fuzzy, and filled with warmth. The cold air of the night was numb, and he felt like he was flying. Harry was staring at him, his eyes bringing butterflies in Draco's stomach.
Draco's chest tightened at the mention of his father. But there was no going back now. He really couldn't blame Harry though, he was the one who insulted the Weasleys before.
It was a boggart. A few weeks ago, the Gryffindors and Slytherins had a class in which they each tried to face their boggart, one by one. But Lupin dismissed the class before Harry had the chance, much to Draco's relief. Draco had a good idea of what his boggart would be.
He knew what he was going to do. He knew now. There was no going back. He bit his lip harshly, til he tasted blood and tears pricked at his eyes. It was too painful. He was going to kill the man who'd killed all happiness for his family.
"Speaking of friends, have you seen that Granger girl? Seems to think she's amazing, always with that bushy hair of hers, buttons all done up, always trimmed nails..." she trailed off as she realised Draco was looking at her suspiciously.
so my sudden burst of motivation has decided to make this a small, fluffy-ish fic. by the way, who spotted the pansmione?
"As it happens, I'm well aware of your situation. You don't surely think your parents wouldn't have consulted me? As for my opinion, I think it would be- ah, beneficial for you to know, your parents wouldn't want you to speak of it to anyone. The decision is still at an early stage, and if not for your father's position in the ministry, would be impossible."
"Well that's Potter for you. Always has to be the worst at everything, but still worshiped by everyone else."
Ivy's eyebrows furrowed, and her grey eyes softened. Her eyes met his in an intense gaze. She waved her hand, and a clipboard arrived in front of her. Pulling a pen out of her bun, she bit her lip. "You've been learning occlumency?"
Lately, he'd been confused by his feelings for Draco. He thought he hated the boy. But there was something about him that made Harry want to spend all the time in the world with him. Something about him, that just filled Harry with warmth and comfort, in a way Hermione and Ron failed to.
Lunch came around, and brought Draco's favourite, shepherd's pie. It was something the house elves would always arrange for to make Draco happy as a child, whenever they spotted him crying. Of course, they'd always know the reason, but would never say a word. Although Dobby was much nicer than the others, by caring just a little more than his parents did.
Ron's gaze softened, and his words seemed more sensitive as he spoke. "Y'know, you could always tell Dumbledore. Or Lupin, because- I mean- you guys seem close."
Lupin looked up at Draco with a shocked, almost worried face. His eyes gave everything away, but he stuttered a small "I-n- no- no."
"That's the problem, you can't solve it! My father wants me to move to Durmstrang. They- my parents- must've had an agreement, my father wanted me to go to Durmstrang when I was young because they have a finer education system."
. Gryffindor and Slytherin only had classes together two or three times a day, so Draco rarely got to see him.
!" she said, a grimace appearing on her face. But there was a little fear in her eyes, that made Draco's heart skip a beat. "Anyways, I have an assignment to finish, so I'll see you in the morning."
As they reached the top, both of them felt very out of breath. The cold air was rushing against their faces, and Harry's hair was flying wildly, but in the perfect way. The moonlight let a certain glow cover them, making the night truly difficult.
"I hope he finds me," he said in a cold voice. "'Cause when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does,  I'm going to kill him!"
He actually accidentally caught Harry's eyes at one point, and to his surprise, Harry was staring at him. The thought stayed with him the entire day.
tears. He could feel himself breaking inside. And he could see the world crumbling and falling around him.
He could feel his lungs burning again, and his breath becoming more and more rapid, and getting caught in his throat as he tried to speak. His chest was tightening, and he couldn't breathe. This couldn't be happening, not now. The dizziness had started again. From the corner of his blurry vision, he could see Harry staring at him, but he didn't care at the moment.
"I tried to," replied Draco, looking down at his feet. "Trust me, I really did. I thought it would go away, but, I mean, it never really did."
However, Thursday night's detention was not what Draco expected. His blood ran cold, and his chest felt tight when he realised what they'd be doing. Lupin met them in the empty Defense against the Dark Arts classroom, like they were told to. Standing in front of them was a closed closet which was making noises, while shaking violently, as though something was inside it.
So as the blur of days passed, Draco found himself growing more and more worried. And more and more guilty. Because he knew this piece of information. Dumbledore must've known, and he definitely wasn't the only one.
Dark circles became more prominent, not that they weren't always, and his frayed sleeves remained lower than ever. And though Remus knew he should report this to Snape, he had a feeling that would only mess things up further.
The silencing charm was put on his bed every night, so the others wouldn't hear his screams and sobs. Nobody could ever know that Draco Malfoy actually had emotions. His steady stream of tears was aided by the thoughts swirling around his head.
There were shelves filled with various objects, as well as a huge bookshelf, filled with different books. A cage with some type of interesting creature was kept towards a wall, next to a locked chest. The walls were faded brown, and the whole room felt really warm and comforting, almost like home.
trigger warnings-- self harm ('cause draco still isn't okay). please read the tags, this story deals with sensitive topics.
But as Remus turned through the newspapers, watching Sirius's dead eyes staring menacingly back at him, he could barely recognise the man who soothed him after his nightmares, and bought hot chocolate after the full moons.
Draco laughed bitterly. "Why would they do that? When it comes to my life, I'm the last person they care about."
"What brings you here so early, Draco?" Lupin went and hastily shut the case in which the potions lay.
Harry's eyes grew wide in shock as Hermione's words sunk in. The letter was shaking with his hands, and a cold wind seemed to travel down his spine, despite the crackling fire and closed windows.
But his steady heartbeat was broken as he heard footsteps. Before he turned around, he heard a sickeningly familiar voice call out his name.
He wasn't okay. He wasn't. He found out way too much, and wished he could forget everything he'd heard. It was too much, he didn't want to know.
His bubble of thought was suddenly ruptured as he fell sideways after bumping into someone. "Watch where you're-" he started, but was cut off as the recognition hit him. Harry adjusted his glasses before pulling himself up.
He'd go meet professor Lupin. Show him that there was nothing to be scared of. Perhaps get his father to interfere. And it'd all be over.
"Did you know Potter's into blokes too?" She asked, as her smirk turned into a grimace. "I mean, his lineage is disgusting in itself, but imagine having to be
Slowly, but surely, Draco shrugged his night shirt off, and put on one of his shirts, and pulled on some sweatpants gifted to him by Blaise. He had to admit, muggle sweatpants were so much better than whatever the purebloods had to wear.
He picked up a scarf that was laying on the floor, and tried to cover the faded scars on his hand with it, before glancing at the girl, who was thankfully still reading. Throwing the scarf on the floor, he grabbed his wand, holding it so tightly that his fingers were numb, and muttering more charms, so that the scars were completely invisible.
An hour or two later, on the other side of the castle, Draco was pacing in Slytherin common room. He'd skipped History of Magic, wanting time to just clear his mind, and rushed up to the common room for some peace and quiet.
As soon as, Draco rushed out of the hall, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. As he rounded the door to professor Lupin's office, he hesitated for a split second, before knocking harshly on the door.
He fumbled for his invisibility cloak, and pulled it over him. He looked from right to left, and spotted Draco's figure marching down the hallways, toward the door. Harry tried to run without making his footsteps too loud, almost tripping over it.
Far below the Gryffindor towers resided a fair-haired boy, who just couldn't sleep. Not with the swirling thoughts of Sirius Black in his head, along with professor Lupin, his father, and just everything.
"Professor, I know what it looks like, but I- I was provoked," Harry started. "Malfoy made a really rude-" but Harry was cut off by Lupin, who said in a now much calmer voice "I understand that the circumstances were unfair to you Harry, but nothing could justify having a fully blown duel in the corridors,"
Draco bit his lip. His heart was beating frantically against his chest, and his hands were almost shaking with adrenaline.
The smell of fresh grass was near sickening as Draco slowed down, feeling small drops of morning drizzle land on his skin. He just wanted to run away, be free. The quidditch pitch was right in front of him; the stands towering over, as the coloured stands wrapped around.
Lost in his thoughts again, he closed his eyes and allowed his mind to wander to the kiss that'd happen. And how Harry would want to do it again and again. But he could almost hear Hermione and Ron's reactions.
"So what if he is? So what if he likes Malfoy? He's still the same Harry we both know and love! He's still our best friend! And I hope you stick by that, Ronald."
With his eyes blurred with tears, he could see a figure in the mirror. A figure with messy, black hair. And an untidy uniform. And round glasses. Harry Potter was standing at the door of the boy's bathroom.
She was beautiful, but not in a conventional way. Something about her features were mysterious, almost hypnotic. Intense eyes, sharp, small lips that were almost pale, and cheekbones that Remus remembered used to be too prominent due to hunger.
"Stupid, weak, queer. A pathetic son, you are," The boggart-Lucius's hand got a tight hold grip on Draco's pale arms. Uncovering Draco's sleeve, revealing the many scars, shining brightly against the pale skin. The boggart yelled "What are these? Why can't you pull yourself together? Disgraceful. I will not have my son-"
McGonagall was also an option, but she had enough on her plate, as well as Dumbledore, what with Sirius Black out of Azkaban. Remus knew he should tell Dumbledore about the animagus aspect, but couldn't help the dying light in his heart, telling him that Sirius was innocent.
The next few days passed by in a blur. Draco could hardly recall when he was supposed to meet Lupin, but at this point, he didn't care. The only thing he could focus on was Harry. Only Harry was on his mind.
He suddenly stood up, and stepped over the bench, making sure he was making as much noise as he could. Turning his head, and brushing the hair out of his eyes, he stalked out of the room in anger.
"Weren't any positions open?! What the fuck kind'v 'xcuse is that?! You w're lit'rally starving! 'nd after all yo'd be'n through-"
A sharp fear took over Draco, as a memory hit him. He was thrusted back to the Malfoy family reunion of 1989. The dreaded meetings, in which Draco would have to dress up in those stiff suits, and sit there, listening to the grown-ups talk all the time. Because he was old enough to listen, but talking was always prohibited.
"No, Hermione, I'm fine, really. No, it's just- something I have to take care of," he muttered as he saw Draco leave the table, and march off out the doors. Harry grabbed his bag, and stumbled over the bench to rush outside.
There was an uncomfortable silence as they both pondered over what'd happened. Ron looked at the ground and licked his lips, while Hermione's eyes still lingered on him, her chest still heaving.
"I did, didn't I? Took me six years and way too much bullshit to put up with, but here I am," she said proudly, stretching in her chair.
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Draco squinted at the owl's full figure in the almost pitch black. He clumsily grasped for his wand, almost falling off the bed.
His tongue trailed over a sore spot in his mouth- after biting it so many times, he could taste blood.
Almost disappointingly, Harry pulled off his cloak, and brushed a few short strands of hair out of his eyes. He looked to the floor, rubbing his hands together as the cold air from outside blew shivers down his spine.
"I'm being plain when I say this, what your parents do to you is illegal, not just in the wizarding world, but in the muggle world too. Trust me when I say that you'll find a way out of this."
Draco pulled his sleeve up, trying to look away from the growing red stains on his jumper. He felt a warm sort of presence take over as Harry sat down next to him. Butterflies rose in his stomach as Harry's warm hands held Draco's hand, purposefully ignoring the bloodstained sleeve.
Remus smiled as her accent started getting thicker- it'd always been a trait he found adorable in her. "Calm down," he chuckled. "I can barely understand you."
"Maybe- Maybe another day," Draco said quietly. But his voice sounded different this time. Less flat and emotionless, and more honest.
Deep down, he knew it. After all this time, he still believed it. Because it was true, it had to be.
Draco's heart warmed a little as he climbed up the stairs, steering away from professor Lupin's office, and walking toward his next class. It was nice, he thought, hearing his name finally being said in that warm, low voice.
Professor Lupin's calm demeanor dropped, and a shocked face appeared. No, less shocked, more... stern? Draco couldn't place it, and that worried him.
"Well, I better be off then. Nice meeting you," she said, with a little bow, and skipped off, attracting the stares of several students. The muffled chatter became clear as the doors opened, and professor Sprout spotted Draco, giving him a proud look, which Draco returned with a glare.
Tears escaped his eyes. He heard a scream, which filled his head. It was clouded with the familiar déjà vu of terrified hazel eyes, and wavy red hair. And a flash of green light drowning in manic laughter, that was growing closer and closer.
She gave him a smile, took his hand, and gave him a small kiss on the cheek before running off, Remus grinning fondly just behind her.
Boggart-Lucius started striking him with his black cane. The real Lucius used to do that when Draco was smaller, but resorted to magical means nowadays. And if there was one thing that could make the situation worse, it would be what the boggart-Lucius had said in a loud, yet calm voice.
"Shut it, Lupin, you're not intruding on anything. Was I intruding when you let me stay in your house when shit got bad?"
Draco looked back up at Harry, who gave him a small, assuring smile. And he turned around to walk away. He could feel Harry's eyes on him, and shrugged his cloak back on. As he left through the large, wooden door, he felt a warm, familiar hand grip his shoulder in the dim light.
The paper slipped from his cold shaky fingers. Every breath he took in wasn't enough, and was freezing his lungs. Thoughts were rushing through his mind, piercing through his brain at lightning speed. He couldn't take it. Words were flashing through his mind, blinding him.
"Really?" The lawyer asked frantically, hastily pulling her feet off the desk as she stuffed her wand in her pocket. "Send him in then!"
It was almost a mantra for him now, constantly being repeated in his head. He reached down, under his bed, and grabbed the box. This wooden box was taken out most nights. He reached out for the key under his pillow, and unlocked it. Inside, there were sharp blades. Many that he'd collected over the years.
He still believed there was something. Which was why, he was holding back tears when he saw two boys, one with dark, messy hair and one with light, combed hair sitting back to back at the perch of the astronomy tower. And he didn't have the heart to tell them it was after hours.
The silence was stretched for an uncomfortably long time as they walked back up to their common room, covering their ears as the fat lady tried again to sing an agonisingly high tune. The common room was empty, save for a few students from higher years.
Ron's face was filled with pity, the sickening type. Harry didn't want Ron's pity. Hermione looked more determined, but her eyes also shone with that sympathy Harry hated.
This was his secret. This was how he was able to live with being the horrible person he was. This was how he was able to live with all the secrets and memories. This was his coping method, the only thing that kept him alive. And thank Merlin, no one knew about it. At least, not yet.
A figure- professor Lupin- had appeared in front of him, and Draco saw the creature violently shapeshifting, and saw a giant, glowing orb, which resembled the full moon, before it was hurled back into the closet.
Harry's voice was fiercer than ever, and his eyes were filled with hatred and rage. Ron took a step back, as the silence took over again. The cold air stood still, freezing the moment. Harry was going to kill him.
"Yes, really. They were a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, so you'd know how horrible they were. He'd come back from the Holidays with scars left by dark magic."
The feelings were punched out of him, and suddenly he was numb again. "My taste isn't despicable. Now shove off, or I'll tell Pansy about your crush on
He wanted so badly to tell professor Lupin, but he knew it'd be impossible. On the other hand, a fresh start at a new school could be just what he needed to get his mind straightened out.
Draco pushed past the usual group of Slytherins, who were huddling over a newspaper, and squeezed his way to the middle of the group. He almost jerked back at the sight of the man in the picture. Something about him was recognisable, maybe his sunken eyes which were screaming as much as he was. It hit him, Sirius Black, spotted near Hogsmeade.
"Shut up Ron!" Hermione looked and sounded exasperated. "Haven't you seen the way Harry looks at him now?"
He took a deep breath in, and swallowed the urge to throw up, and looking around him, he fell to the bed beneath before brushing a hand through his soaked hair and sweaty forehead. But the rough dent of that scar sickened him.
He was shaking, and feelings were hitting him harsher than any cane could. And every inch of him was screaming for escape from this torture. As his mind became fuzzier, he eventually drifted off into fitful sleep.
The boggart drifted in and out of his dreams, as he could picture it happening in front of everyone. Until it was too much, and he'd woken up at early morning in cold sweats. He started charming his forearms, so they were no longer littered with ragged tears, hoping that yesterday's detention would be forgotten.
Harry felt the cold wind wash over him as Hermione pulled off the invisibility cloak. It stung his burning eyes, and he felt an odd sense of nakedness, like everything he'd ever tried to keep secret was revealed to everyone.
Draco looked around. The room was empty, and he really had nothing to lose. "Yeah, who are you?" His voice sounded less harsh than normal.
It was whether Harry was safe. Whether Harry knew. Surely Dumbledore must've told him. Maybe Lupin did. He didn't know, but he sure did hope. Draco also mentally debated whether to tell Harry himself, but in the end, decided that Harry wouldn't want to hear this, especially not coming from him.
“He’s not so bad,” Draco whispers back, watching Harry walk a little ahead, absently staring at the pavement. Pansy snorts.
Harry shakes his head, shutting his eyes. He doesn’t want to ruin the moment, he doesn’t want to push Draco away with his inexperience, but Draco simply reaches over to press a kiss to his closed eyelids and says, low and comforting, “First time for everything.”
“I think I’ll stay the night here, if you don’t mind,” he drawls, and Potter’s eyes flash at the thwarted opportunity to have the last word. “I’d ask you to spend it with me, but seeing as you just broke it off between us, toodle-oo, Potter. Off you go.”
“I believe we’re done for the day, Ms. Richards,” he says, firmness lacing his tone. “If you don’t want that drink.”
He closes his mouth with a snap, mortified and ashamed of his eloquence deserting him in the minutes he’s required it most. This speech, possibly his last before an audience could be the determining stroke ascertaining his future. And yet, here he is, standing in the resounding echo of a fumbled apology and an assurance that he understands he is owed nothing.
It’s definitely not his fault that he is now being tortured by thin walls that do absolutely nothing to disguise the sound of Potter’s pleased, choked-off moans as he wanks.
‘I’ve got you where I want you,’ Draco says, and there’s an undercurrent in his words that makes Harry’s skin tingle.
“How many times have I told you that you and Ron should go buy an owl for yourselves?” He asks her, reminding himself to power through the pain, again. His nails are digging into his palm.
He says those words and waits with bated breath. It is perhaps too soon. They haven’t even been on a date together. But after seeing each other the way they have, Draco doesn’t think dinner at a fancy place in Diagon really matters. Moreover, if meals constitute dates, they’ve been having lunch dates for close to seven weeks now.
But by far the worst times are when Draco is completely resigned when Harry steps in at odd hours of the night,  acting like nothing out of the ordinary has happened, pretending that the warming charm he keeps casting on the food is just a routine act, not bringing up the fact that Harry forgot to send a Patronus again. He looks at Harry and in those grey eyes lies a distance that Harry aches to fill but sometimes finds himself falling short.
The unexpected contact is so all-consuming, so intense that Draco can’t hold back the scream that falls from his lips.
Both of them cock their heads to one side in an eerie replication of the other and say, “Oh,” in unison. It’s right at this moment that Ron chooses to enter, sees the two of them sitting on the couch with their heads tilted to one side, Harry gripping his arse with one hand and glowing red numbers in the air and walks right back out.
Now Harry understands. Memories of himself screaming, tell me why I shouldn’t call the Aurors right now with a wand pointed at Malfoy’s face assault him and he winces unintentionally. He raises his hands, slowly, deliberately, making sure Malfoy is following their movement. He places them, palm forwards, near his shoulders and says, “There are no Aurors with me. There isn’t even a wand in my hands. I’m not here to take you away anywhere. Are you listening to me?”
“Really Malfoy,” she huffs, adjusting her satchel. “After all this time and everything that’s happened, one would have expected you to let go of your stupid prejudices, but your lot, you never learn. I just thought…” She shakes her bushy head and a lock of brown hair falls into her eyes which Draco notices are suspiciously red. She turns to walk away when Draco finally finds his voice.
“I don’t…” he begins, looking down at his hips. “I can’t… Oh Merlin. Can I—Can I borrow your clothes?”
“These Wizarding corporations,” he would say, pointing to a section in the file with a contemptuous finger (only Draco could make even hurried pointing look contemptuous), “they think they can get away with fucking over anything.”
Chances are, he simply commissioned the standard armchair size and adjusted himself to whatever was available. Scorpius won’t be surprised if Harry’s armchair has its own glaring faults– too narrow for his shoulders, too soft for a body accustomed to the hard backed Ministry chairs. Harry won’t complain out of indifference and Draco won’t complain out of pride.
“Who the bloody hell is Anthony Filibuster?” Harry had asked, turning the circle of Draco’s arms with a snort.
“How’s the shop doing?” He asks. He’s always harboured a secret admiration for Fred and George Weasley for the stunt they pulled in Fifth Year, and their ensuing resounding success. During the summer of Sixth Year, more than once he’d placed orders under a different name for some puking pastilles and skiving snackboxes. The wrappings are still buried beneath the mattress in his childhood bedroom, the one he moved out of after the events of the War.
“What would that be?” Scorpius asks, feeling the familiar tug of sleep behind his eyelids. These days he can’t stay awake for very long. It’s exhausting, and even seeing is a strenuous act.
“What the actual fuck were you thinking?” Weasley asks him, his hands clenched, his brows furrowed and his lips set into a thin line.
“No,” he says. “This branch of the Malfoy line was wiped out during the Italian Wizarding War of 1876. None of them survived. Plenty of rumours around about how precisely it happened. Some say they were spies. Some say the family splintered within itself and everyone killed each other. Father always said it wasn’t as scandalous as the Malfoy line likes to maintain it is. He said they were ambushed in the middle of the night in a raid and all of them were too drunk to fight back.”
Parkinson holds her hands up, adopting a deceptively innocent expression. “Thank me later,” she says, disappearing into Draco’s room. Draco stares when she slams the door in his face.
Who would have thought that he would live to see the day his fingers would begin to shake anytime he noticed someone’s eyes on him, his hands would get clammy at the mere indication of someone's approach and the notion of approaching anyone himself would make acrid bile rise in the back of his throat?
“Of course,” the woman murmurs. Her gaze turns assessing, honing into the slightly unfocused nature of Draco’s rambling. He doesn’t seem to notice. “Where did this one start, then?”
“I came here because France is buzzing with Saint Potter’s birthday and there are banners in every wizarding neighbourhood proclaiming the joy they feel at the knowledge that the Saviour has lived another year,” Parkinson says. “I trust that you understand Britain will be…”
Hermione makes a dusting motion with her hands and gets up, stretching beside Harry. When Malfoy gets up and opens his mouth, probably to bid them goodbye and leave, Hermione says, “Why don’t you join us, Draco? I think we have bangers and mash tonight with peas, Mrs Weasley sent some over.”
“Shh,” Draco says, and when Scorpius looks at him, he’s crying. He’s not even trying to hide it, simply letting the tears run tracks down his cheeks and drip onto the blue bedsheets. “Quiet, my boy, that’s not…” He trails off, unsure how to complete his sentence.
when he laughs. Draco can almost see the transformation of him in the full-bodied laughter, his armour falling away, his ghosts disappearing. He looks like a boy, and Draco bites down hard on his lip to keep his thoughts from coasting the dangerous shores of the thoughts that invade his headspace when he thinks about beautiful boys.
Without a second thought, he pulls her against his chest as she clings to the front of his t-shirt and sobs softly, her body shaking. It takes him a moment to understand that the dampness against his cheek are his own tears soaking into her bushy hair.
“Angry,” Draco completes. Potter nods, an embarrassed, quiet bob of his head and he fixes his gaze back at the floor. Then he looks back up at Draco and his eyes are so vibrantly green behind those stupid glasses. “Mione said something about a project. And I can’t help but think if I hadn’t been so, so, awful you’d have gone along with it. If you were, Malfoy, don’t reject her because of what I said. She doesn’t hold those views, doesn’t think you belong in Azkaban or whatever else I said at that time.”
“Harry, we can’t live with a ghost.” He stares down at her, eyes wide. Her smile is sad. “You try living with yourself the way we have and you’ll realise that it’s harming you more than us.”
He fills in his request for a fortnight’s holiday, hands it over to Jemima who goes through it and looks up, surprise evident on her face.
They cut themselves off when the door squeaks open. The handle turns and a pale hand lingers on it for a brief moment before falling away. There’s a slight, almost imperceptible tremble to it. Scorpius eyes trail upwards, to where Draco stands in the doorway. There’s a shadow behind him– Harry’s silhouette visible in the dimness of the hallway. Draco’s eyes are rimmed with red. Harry’s breaths are harsh, yet shallow. Neither of them are saying anything.
She seems to visibly hold herself back from saying whatever first springs to mind before eventually blurting out, “Malfoy, what do you think of Muggles now?”
dead tired of this, ‘Mione? You’re the one? I just had to see Malfoy in Sirius’ house, sitting in my kitchen like he owns it and you’re the one who’s tired? I woke up this morning to blasted sunlight scorching my eyes out when all I wanted to do was sleep and you’re the one who’s tired? I have to deal with reliving every single thing every single night and you’re still the one–” he jabs at her chest, voice rising with every word, “–who’s fucking tired, ‘Mione?” He’s panting by the time he’s done.
Draco and Granger write their essays while Potter goes through Granger’s notes, sometimes pointing out sections he can’t understand.
It is a little, isn’t it? He’s the one who said nothing about the walls when he knew. He’s the one who is hard in his bed hearing the slick sounds of Potter’s hand over his cock. He’s the one who isn’t doing anything about it when he could, just by calling out a little loudly for Potter—
To the outside eye, the placement of the chairs seems merely insensitive. Proof of the fact that the most famous family in Wizarding Britain– or should Scorpius say infamous after everything that has happened in the past few years?– can’t keep itself together even at the child’s deathbed. If the newspapers knew, there would be headlines– Feud vs. Fatherhood.
He looks at Draco again, this time taking in the intent frown, the lip bite that indicates his concentration and the tension in his jaw which Harry has grown to learn means Draco is unsure, or nervous or confused.
Draco’s jaw drops open. He had heard rumours about the Saviour’s less than ideal childhood and had passed it as a load of tosh. Just something to make the already overly sung Hero even more sensational. But then he remembers Harry telling him about his repressed memories of childhood, triggers he doesn’t even know of and a sick, sick feeling settles in his stomach.
“The blood curse remained, he was always weak. Died pretty early too. But the Healers at the time thought early would be a couple years at most. He lived to be thirty six. Had about five ankle biters before he passed on too. No curses on any of them. All of them grew up to be perfectly dishonourable Wizengamot members who helped pass the House Elves Breeding Bill of 1852.”
When Hermione returns, Harry is sitting on the kitchen floor, wand limp in his fingers, staring vacantly at a leg of the dining table.
They prolong it as long as possible, mouths moving against each other’s, slotting together so perfectly that air is a secondary concern to the euphoric feel of the drag of the other’s lips. It isn’t kissing, Draco thinks, seeing stars behind his closed eyelids. This cannot just be kissing because Draco has kissed before and has been kissed before and none of it ever felt like this. This is dying, this is that split second before your soul leaves your body and your entire life flashes before your eyes, your best memories bidding you a fond farewell. This is dying and coming back to life again, knowing you have a second chance to do everything better, to do everything differently from the first time.
They sit quietly in the kitchen for a long while, not saying anything to each other. The air is apprehensive but not uncomfortable. They’ve seen each other at their weakest Draco thinks. Finally he feels like he is on even footing with them. Like on some level, they understand each other.
He closes his mouth, cursing himself colourfully internally for running it in the first place. Unwarranted, unwanted words are shameful, he knows that. It has been drilled into him for years, especially the last couple. He clearly hasn't learnt much.
He misses Severus. Not in the way he did just after his death with a fierce aching in his heart and denial raging in his head but instead with the quiet nostalgia that comes with understanding sacrifice. He has watched Weasley suffer the death of his brother and yet he goes through every day with stoic calm that anchors everyone who encounters it. Hermione’s parents are somewhere in Australia and though she misses them, talks about them with a sad smile as though they are dead, she refuses to find them. The memory reversal might be too much for their brains, she claims but sometimes Draco wonders if she is only avoiding explanations. No parent would ever understand why their child erased all their memories, made them different people and sent them off to live somewhere unknown, far away from where they could ensure the safety of their child. For all that it is worth, Hermione’s parents have ceased to exist.
Draco’s holding up a length of hemp rope in his hands, one of the lower kitchen cabinets lying open. Clearly he’d been exploring and he’d come across something that couldn’t quite be… explained.
want to partner with you.” His voice is scratchy from disuse and he realises with a jolt that it has been weeks since he spoke to anybody. “I just didn’t understand why you would want to, a-after, everything.”
“I’m not trying to argue with you,” Draco says. “I’m not accusing you. I’m pointing out the facts and I’m trying to find a reason that either justifies or at the very least explains them.”
By the time Malfoy’s birthday rolls around, the tentative truce they’ve struck has extended to long walks through the wizarding section of San Gimignano and brief but interesting forays into the Muggle part which usually involves copious amounts of gelato and pizza.
Draco has been asked countless times to divorce Harry. Draco has also been asked countless times by countless people why he does
“Is he now,” he says, and marvels at the smoothness of his voice. The calm mask. The overlay of an upbringing tailored for these situations.
Oh. That question. Of course he wanted him to. He had wanted it more than anything else, wanted it with every fibre of his body, mind and soul. He had wanted it so bad that when Draco had first initiated the contact, he had thought it was another one of his fantasies, only more elaborate.
Gregor Selwyn had been a Death Eater placed on house arrest with a diminished sentence for his cooperation after the Second Wizarding War. When Scorpius, with a sick interest clawing at his heart had gone through the papers of 1999, tracing the angry lines of Harry’s form in the pictures the Prophet printed, he’d discovered Selwyn had made the headlines for a week. His intel led to the capture of almost the entire Snatchers gang and brought Fenrir Greyback to his knees. Just for that, if he hadn’t been a branded Death Eater, he might have been nominated for an Order of Merlin.
Draco’s throat hurts “You should have let me die,” he says. “And all these problems would have been solved.”
‘Fuck, Harry, you feel so fucking good,’ Draco whispers, his lips tilting up in an involuntary smile. ‘You always feel so bloody good in me.’
“Me talking about graveyard sex didn’t put you off?” Harry asks, leaning in closer. Draco tries to push him away, looking annoyed but Harry moves in, closing the gap till their eyes are so close that Harry can see the flecks of brilliant blue in Draco’s irises. “Wow, you must really like me.”
They meet outside the courtroom, Hermione clutching the papers to her chest, her hair flying around and an excited gleam in her eyes. She sees them and breaks into a sprint while Kingsley follows at a more sedate pace.
It is a frustrating but recent development– he has begun to notice Malfoy. He has begun to notice that he looks happy when Harry brings in sweets and barely touches his food if there is something spicy. He has begun to notice that some colour is returning to Malfoy’s cheeks, that his eyes don’t look quite so empty anymore. Whether it is because of the food or the company or something Malfoy is doing for himself, Harry doesn’t know (and definitely doesn’t hope it is the company) but Malfoy looks healthier in the three weeks they have adopted the routine. He notices that Malfoy laughs in a way that makes his Adam’s apple prominent in his throat (and in a moment of weakness, Harry had wanted to lean over and trace his tongue over that pale, milky expanse of skin). He notices and he knows he shouldn’t. Not because both of them are men because the Wizarding World doesn’t particularly care about that, only the very old Pureblood families do and that is only due to concerns about continuing bloodline.
Death shrugs. The gesture is so decidedly human that Scorpius wants to laugh. Instead he nods. “Please.”
“What do you even care about my comfort?” Scorpius asks, banging his hand against the cabinet door he’s leaning into. When it doesn’t make a sound, he stifles the urge to scream till he’s hoarse. He’ll never be hoarse, and screaming into a void for all eternity does indeed sound more like the hell he’d thought he might go into on an off-chance. Now that he hasn’t (or at least is being told he hasn’t), self inflicted misery sounds a little… pointless. “I’d be comfortable not watching my father drink himself into alcoholism and a pot belly or watch my other father punch the walls into submission, but here I am, and here you are.”
He’s so beautiful, it’s hardly fair. Could Draco have been reasonably expected to not fall in love? To not want to keep this close and never let go?
Suddenly Draco is gripped by painful realisation, painful, burning understanding of Harry’s testimony on his mother’s behalf.
With every single instruction Granger gives him, things begin to seem clearer and sharper. He focuses on his surroundings and says, “You, the fireplace, the photo above it, the carpet, the tea tray.”
He hadn’t thought of sitting across from her at a coffee shop, watching her Quidditch toned shoulders hunch in on themselves.
“That’s what they all call me,” they say, cutting him off. “But most don’t sit across from me and have conversations about it. There’s no melodrama involved, as you called it. Just perception.”
“You can ask about sex, Draco. In fact, you can say sex,” Harry says, sounding more amused than he has any right to be.
“I’ll have you know I can kiss a file just fine,” Draco had said in response, ignoring Scorpius’ slightly repulsed eye-roll. “I kiss all the ones I win shut.”
He doesn’t make heads turn, but Draco’s eyes can’t move away, fixating on the way Potter’s resting expression appears to be a subconscious smile.
It’s simultaneously infuriating and relieving and Harry finds himself at a loss of how to process this Malfoy—the unfamiliarity of his position contrasted ruthlessly against the familiar, defensive jut of his chin
For three days he has had Malfoy on his mind, a continuous, uncomfortable nagging that something isn’t right. Every day Hermione greets him in the morning with a meaningful look in her eye and he returns it with a pleading one in his. She shakes her head looking slightly exasperated before she goes back to the plate of food before her and whatever book she has with her just then. Ron, who probably heard about the Kitchen Debacle from Hermione shoots him a sympathetic look each time before concentrating on his breakfast or rather what appears to be
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh Merlin fuck, fuck, fuck, I’m gonna, I’m gonna, Harry please, please, please please…”
The ghosts he’s been trying to push away are crowding in on him, and all Harry can do is stare at the blank white wall before him. The sounds of the battle are coming back to him, the screams of terror, the manic laughter of the truly corrupted Death Eaters. Sparks of green and red fizzle in his brain and the jarring sensation of his Disarming Spell connecting with Voldemort’s Killing Curse shoots up his right arm. Everything is collapsing—the towers, the people, the collateral damage of a war Harry wasn’t competent enough to stop, the ghosts of his parents and their friends, his brain—and all Harry can do, is stare, unseeing at the chipped cracks of plaster in the wall.
He won’t deny it holds appeal. The chance to up and leave, to wipe the slate clean and start over- who’s he trying to fool, not just appeal, it holds powerful allure. But Wiltshire has twined its charm into his bones and even when the hallways seem to echo with forgotten hisses of a dead snake, Malfoy Manor will never cease to be his home. There is ancestral magic woven into the walls, into the stones of the Manor. It is sentient, it pulses with life. When Voldemort had lived there, the core of the house, the magic in its foundations had closed itself up. It stood, towering and tall, beautiful in a horrifying way, but completely dead. Now it is slowly coming back to life, the East Wing lets in the sunlight, the floorboards squeak sometimes, wind rustles the papers on his desk. The charm of a new life is great and French has always been one of his favourite languages but the Manor coming back to life is an experience he will not miss for the world. His house is erasing the memories, the horrors one by one, shuddering and heaving, scrubbing its stones clean of the Dark Magic sticking to them. Draco feels an odd kinship with it every time he takes a bath and scrubs his Dark Mark till it is raw, red and puffy.
“We only seek to begin an early introduction. When one is younger, one has a more open mind, and that eases the introduction to a whole new world. There are things to see that will be new to both Pureblood children and Muggle-borns. Things that upon integration will hold the Wizarding World’s hand to development,” Hermione continues earnestly.
He had laughed at her censoring herself, poking her in the ribs to remind her he’s fifteen and he hears worse on a daily basis from all his mates in the Ravenclaw Tower after Professor Longbottom sets them homework. He’d dodged the question for then.
‘Rope,’ Harry says but the word comes out strangled and breathy so he clears his throat and tries again. ‘That’s, um, rope.’
“We were supposed to be partners at the Academy together,” Ron says. There’s an undercurrent of… something there that Harry can’t quite place.
He isn’t supposed to do this. He is Draco Malfoy, he cannot, he should not under any circumstances be kissing Harry Potter. Even taking out the whole Death Eater, Saviour complexity out of the equation, what are they left with? Years and years of mutual hatred, death threats, curse scars and hexes. Years and years of wanting nothing but the other gone. A few weeks of being acquainted to each other, knowing nothing but the basics. Harry probably only kissed him back because he didn’t know how to turn him away. Draco had done him a favour when he had Stunned him and helped Hermione through her panic attack and Harry feels too grateful to do something as insulting as turning away someone who kisses you. He hadn’t asked for consent, Harry probably hates him by now. Harry probably thinks he’s trying to take advantage. Harry probably… probably…
Ron moaned. “Yes. Our dear Chief Warlock has got himself a front garden full of cocks, as you might have heard.” He followed Harry out the back door, closing it behind them, and through the garden to the rear gate. Harry unlocked the old, slightly battered-looking Volkswagen Polo parked in the laneway behind the house, and he and Ron slid in. The interior condition of the car was somewhat at odds with its exterior. The soft leather seats creaked comfortably, and the radio switched on automatically, filling the cavernous back seat with the latest hit from The Sneaky Tweezers. There was a pleasant smell of leather polish and carpet foam, and Ron immediately lifted the lever to ease the seat all the way back to stretch out the entire length of his legs. “Do you mind if I change the station? I can’t stand this Sneaky Tweezer shite. Whatever happened to decent bands, like the Weird Sisters?”
Potter said it softly, matter-of-factly. Sympathetically. He never asked anything of Draco, never expected anything of him. Draco couldn't look at him, and so focused his eyes on the faded teal and salmon patterns of the ancient parlour rug, and felt his stomach knot and twist.
Draco nodded. “I’ll do the permits, since you allegedly don’t work for the Ministry and therefore can’t make any official requests.” A dimple creased Potter’s left cheek, which Draco tried very hard to ignore. “You remember how to use the Ledger, I assume?”
Harry’s lips pressed together in a genuine smile, and he looked at Malfoy properly this time. Malfoy seemed to relax slightly, and smiled back. “You know me a bit too well, Malfoy.”
“I don't think that’s quite the deterrent you intend it to be,” Harry said, feeling his pulse quicken at the thought of Malfoy baring Harry’s arse and taking his hand to it. And since when had
“Oh, my turn.” He cleared his throat, and didn’t look at Malfoy. “Er. I’ll shag Ron, as well. Best tits in the Ministry, hands down.”
In the lane, the air was cooler than the stuffy atmosphere inside the pub. Still warm, though; good weather for a walk. They were predicting a heat wave, soon, but Harry wasn’t sure he put much stock in meteorology. It seemed about as reliable as divination, a lot of the time.
He didn’t even pretend to protest when Harry backed him into the wall beside the mantle, and slid both hands up the back of his robes. Harry meant to have just one last snog, to tide him over until Friday, but Draco’s mouth was sweet with mint toothpaste and sugary tea, and it was far too easy to get lost in it. Draco’s skin was warm and velvety under his fingers. Harry hadn’t been wearing much himself to begin with, just some worn-thin pyjama trousers, and he managed to get one thigh between Draco’s without much protest.
Harry remained in the same spot for several minutes, until the cold had cleared his head sufficiently to allow him to Apparate home without Splinching himself. In this state, he’d be likely to leave his cock in the laneway, which would make all the wanking he planned to do when he got home significantly more difficult.
Draco pressed his lips to the shell of Potter’s ear, and whispered. “Fresh laundry. There’s something about the smell, the bleach, the washing powder.” Draco made a low noise, and pressed Potter back until they collided with a high bench stacked with folded towels. “Fabric softener. Makes me hard.”
He’d thought he’d feel more anxious about letting go of all this stuff, but he felt curiously calm about it. “But it
As he climbed back up into the stands, he scanned the rows for a gap in a section with a decent view. His mother and aunt could be anywhere, but frankly he didn’t fancy a lecture on top of everything else.
“Leave it with me, Devlin,” Harry said, closing the file. Fuck Throttlebottom. Harry couldn’t decline to investigate, but as far as he was concerned this case was not their top priority, no matter Ron had said. “I’ve got something else to handball to you in the meantime – I’ve got a couple of backlogged Extractions that need to be integrated with a Tracker, including this freshly brewed little bastard.” He handed Devlin the toaster phial. “Could you take care of that for me?”
Harry passed a lazy hand over Draco’s body, cleaning charm tingling in its wake. “Honestly, I didn't expect to live past seventeen so everything after that has been a bonus, really.”
, and he’d always thought that’s what he was. But maybe he was like Malfoy. Maybe it wasn’t just about being male or female. Maybe it was much more complicated - or maybe it was simple. Just sexual. Just liking who you like.
“What’s the word?” Ron said, peering under the tarp at the remains of the shrub cuttings, and generally poking at things on the bench. “What does it all mean?”
of Draco’s notebooks, the one he was using for the wedding planning, was on the kitchen table where he must have left it after making himself breakfast in the morning.
"Your opinion means more than my two years of sweat and blood and sacrifice. I should have known it would be this way before I ever came to your stupid Order for help. What was it worth? Not a thing, not even my freedom. Everything I've done has been for nothing."
He nodded. “M’fine. The tenderness is nearly all gone, and I had a potion for my head. Still definitely experiencing the truth compulsion though. I never would have told you all that without a year of therapy and most of a bottle of vodka in me.”
That got Malfoy to turn his head slightly, enough to level a glare at Harry, but he still wouldn’t face him. Malfoy’s skin was blotchy. Harry clenched his fist and felt the fabric tighten around his hand, and he crossed the room to stand in Malfoy’s personal space. Within punching distance.
“You can’t call me little man anymore, I’m ten,” Teddy said, face mashed into Draco’s shoulder. Draco pressed a kiss to the top of his head. He still smelled like baby shampoo.
He still felt pretty seedy, though his body didn’t ache the same way it had, which was a relief. He’d been absolutely battered like a cod by that hex, or perhaps it’d been several hexes, he couldn't rightly remember. There was Pepper-Up under the sink, and he gulped down as much as he could stand, and then his stomach growled so loudly that he decided the next order of business needed to be food.
“Its eye kind of watches you no matter where you go, doesn’t it.” Potter moved into place beside Draco, just slightly too close to be casual. “Maybe our frozen friend is annoyed with you for making his beak look so much like a phallus.”
Morgan squinted, and pressed the binoculars hard into his sockets. “The brown. With the cream pinstripe.”
Draco looked at him, and narrowed his eyes. Potter's team was in Sourton. “I’m sure Agatha is perfectly happy with her assignment. Who wouldn’t prefer an exciting field assignment to plankton duty?”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy said smoothly. “Listen, if you’re not doing anything Thursday night, I was wondering if you’d do me a favour.”
The choking feeling gripped him again as he went down the stairs. Draco rubbed his throat, willing it to pass, standing paused outside the kitchen door. He tried to will the panic away.
how long it’d been since Harry last pulled, if there was some kind of tell he wasn’t aware of. “Since you quit the Auror’s,” Malfoy continued after a moment, raising an eyebrow questioningly. “So it’s not like you’re saving the world all the time anymore. Definitely saving a few arses and noses from biting objects, but that’s hardly warrior stuff, is it?”
That finally got Orange Singlet to tear his gaze away from Harry to look at Malfoy. He gave Malfoy a long, appraising look, lingering on where Malfoy’s hands were spread wide on Harry’s hips.
“I’m meant to be on leave,” Draco said, already knowing all the fight had gone out of him. Weak as piss. “Right now, the itinerary should have me in the middle of a very long bath.”
His neighbour didn’t reply for a little while. “So. You come here every week and try to find a Harry Potter knock off.”
Potter led the way when they reached Mysteries, ushering Draco down the stairs which led to Level 10 and the courtrooms, then down another to Level 11. They each pressed their wands to the heavy iron door, and the access permits activated after a long, considered moment, allowing the door to swing open on creaking, aged hinges. The vibration of the ward magic was enough to rattle his teeth and set every hair on end, and Draco could see Potter grimace at the sensation as well, from his peripheral. The magic felt very old, and very, very powerful, and the room seemed to shimmer with it. “This way.” Potter touched Draco’s elbow lightly, and directed him towards a spot that, to Draco, seemed exactly like any other in the vast room. “Just here.”
“Today was shit,” Malfoy said, with feeling. Harry hummed agreement as best he could around a mouthful of Stella.
“This is obscene,” Harry said, with mingled horror and awe. He’d never looked so...well endowed. Even with the jeans over the top, it was a bit hard to miss. “I can’t go out in public like this, surely.” What if he
“Yes, Ron, we can go to the pub. Go and round up the others, and don’t fucking forget Bujalski this time.”
“Firstly, he doesn't actually want to go to Hampton Wick, he wants to go to the cafe in Bushy Park, but he insists on saying Hampton Wick because at heart he’s still fourteen.”
to get into it. He’d bought all the stationery Hermione had so excitedly recommended, a small fortune of it, with sticky flags and multi-coloured highlighters, and Tippex -
All Draco could see now were Potter’s eyes. The very edge of Potter’s nose touched his, and Draco held his breath. “How could I possibly know that, when you haven’t even let me kiss you?”
“Mmm,” Harry grins at Teddy, who currently has blond hair and green eyes. Malfoy hasn’t noticed. It switches to black and grey, and Harry blows out a breath and tries not to notice the way his guts tumble around like a washing machine when he thinks about what babies with Malfoy would look like. “It’s early days, actually, but we had a promising snog last Thursday and with any luck, he might let me do it again sometime soon.”
“Have you got dust in your ears?” The family resemblance was uncanny. Draco looked terribly cranky.  “Our children. Teddy. Rosie and Hugo, should they fall on hard times.” He lifted a sheet that lay over a gilded, silk upholstered chair. “Some of it’s sentimental and family history, but some of it could be sold for quite a few galleons, if the need should arise.”
“Quite right, Nev,” Harry laughed, and he used Malfoy’s wand to Silence the bed again, and added a darkness charm for good measure. “Your wand feels good in my hand, Malfoy.”
His hand skimmed over the buttoned fly. Harry's been half hard for ages, and it takes very little to bring him fully erect. He was right, the jeans looked obscene and especially now that they were straining under the effort to contain his thickening cock, but instead of embarrassed like he had been at the beginning of the night, he’s aroused. Excited. The hair below his navel is coarse under his thumb as he flicks the top button open, then the next, and the next, until his jeans are open and sliding down his thighs, the sleek briefs pulled taut across his prick.
“A million. A billion, maybe.” Harry’s hands slipped down, and cupped Draco’s backside. “Harry, no fondling me in front of McGonagall!”
“I think I can manage.” Draco stepped down finally, and revealed he was carrying a large pad of paper and a biro. “Since you’re stuck here for a while, I thought it might be a good time to look at one of those lists.”
“I love it when your mouth tastes like gherkin,” Harry said breathlessly against Draco’s lips, as his fingers worked on the drawstring of Draco’s joggers, which were really Harry’s joggers. He got them down over Draco’s hips, and slid immediately lower, feeling his shins catch on the flags, and pushed his face into the joint at the top of Draco’s thigh. “I love it when your cock tastes like salt.” He pressed his tongue flat against the slit and roughly licked the sticky smear of wet gathering there. Draco breathed out hard, and a tumble of swear words followed. “What was that, sweetheart?”
It took Draco several minutes to overcome his laughter, but at least Potter was in good spirits again. “Welcome to the world of senior management, Potter. You’ll soon learn that there is a bottomless pit of agitation and complaint in even the most seemingly content workplace. Someone is always missing out on cake, or stealing a stapler, and everybody wants to have their problem taken seriously. You can hope your staff have a little perspective, but not all of them can see past their own cubicle.”
A bit of investigation of the serial number on his laptop at home had confirmed the original manufacturers were a company based in China, with no known magical affiliation. They exported their goods almost everywhere, but there were no signs of any reports of dick gardens in other countries; in fact, the Throttlebottom case was the only one anywhere, as far as Harry could tell. He had managed to obtain a list of businesses which stocked that particular model of dong, however, and had run the list through the wizarding division of Companies House, to see if any of them happened to be owned by wizards. As it happened, there were three, and one of them was right in Knockturn Alley.
, who on earth would be interested in whether he was on the market, or not. As far as Draco knew he was still social poison, and about as far from an eligible prospect as possible while not actually residing in Azkaban. “When you say ‘traditional’...?”
He could hear the snuffle of Malfoy’s soft laughter, and the shake of his shoulder, still a hot weight against his own, but Harry couldn’t look at him. His face would give it all away, his eyes. He wanted Malfoy so much. He wanted to twine their fingers together. He wanted to borrow his pyjamas, and to help him plant ghost orchids in the woods, and he wanted to eat posh steak, and taste cool lemon in his mouth, and he wanted to whisper
“No.” Draco hadn’t slept. What he’d done instead was panic, nearly cry, nearly vomit, nearly Apparate back to Potter’s house. He spent the night in a spiral, decanting the memories of their conversation into his Pensieve, of the last time they’d had sex, of a dozen or more other encounters together to try and make sense of what Potter had told him. He’d paced for hours considering the chat with Weasley. He’d even resorted to playing Coldplay on repeat through the stereo, but in hindsight that had only served to exacerbate the glum.
Granger twisted the stem of her glass, her eyes narrow and unforgiving. “What did Harry do to you, to hurt you this much?” He felt a shiver of panic. She saw that, too. “Did he say something to you?”
The pub was noisy, but not so much that they couldn’t hear each other. “Probably be in Mungo’s tonight if you hadn’t blocked that last hex.”
Harry had shrugged. “That can’t be helped. This is where the bedrooms are, unless you want them up on the fourth, with us?”
“Dartmoor.” Potter stood, dusted off his knees, and re-folded the map. The magic sample he capped in a small glass phial, and placed in his pocket. “Side-Along okay?”
“I don’t want to investigate this,” Harry said mournfully. “I have biting tea cups. I even have biting toilet seats. There’s been a lot of biting action lately and I really don’t have the time.”
“Won’t,” Harry said, hardly able to bear pulling his mouth from Draco’s skin even long enough to reply. He wrangled Draco’s underwear off at last, pushed his legs apart, and brushed his mouth across the sticky head of his cock.
Malfoy looked up from his mischief with a pleased smirk, and then saw Harry’s presumably surprised expression. “I do like men. I also like women. I like people who weren’t born with the body to match the gender they know in their soul, and I like people who don’t feel they were born with any specific gender at all.” Malfoy shrugged. “I tend not to use labels, myself, other than to say I am a sexual person. I like who I like.”
“Sorry,” Harry said, not very sorry at all. “Maybe being harassed by my friends makes it hard to play a game of strategy!” He took another long gulp of his punch, and felt sweat prickle on the nape of his neck. The Muggle pub was free of wizarding reporters and gawking wix, but it was also sadly absent of cooling charms.
“You know a lot of this stuff is my inheritance, right?” Draco ran his fingers over the nearest chest. “Things handed down for generations. That I’m saving for the kids.”
They both watch Teddy’s eyes turn from green to the warm brown of strong tea, and his hair black, and wild.
“Oh my god Malfoy, you were always a bitchy little prat,” she elbowed him with a grin. “Don’t let Ron hear you say that about Hermione’s hair. Fancy any Ice Mice?”
“Um,” Harry served himself some, distractedly. “Fried bacon lardons, scallions, a bit of diced red pepper, coriander, and the dressings just a whole jar of good mayo mixed up with some curry powder and dijon mustard.”
His drink was placed in front of him, and Draco knocked it back with a wince to buy himself some time. “Actually, Potter, I was just about to hit the dance floor with my friends. But thanks for the offer.”
- oh.” He was sure his blush hadn’t faded, yet it felt like it burned afresh and Harry really started to feel a bit annoyed with himself. He was no
“Sorry,” he said, when he saw Malfoy watching him with narrowed eyes. “That’s a bit gross, I know. Let’s go in and get the insides done, and I’ll clean up properly before we eat anything.” He laughed. “I probably smell a bit ripe.”
Ginny elbowed him in the side. “I’m willing to admit I felt a little flutter in the nethers, too, Malfoy.” Ron made gagging noises, and Ginny mimed fanning her face and neck. “Ron if you don’t calm your tits, I’m going to say the magic word,”
Her tits were almost all of the way out of her dress, and it was a bit of a spectacle. He’d already caught Ted staring at her with wide eyes, twice, which wasn’t unexpected since he was thirteen now, and had functioning vision. He sipped his highball of Old Ogdens on ice, and tried not to make direct eye contact with her cleavage.
“Okay,” Theo scratched his head, and yawned. “Do you want a whole mobile contract as well, or just the handset?”
“Thank you,” Harry said grumpily, not really annoyed with Draco, but playing along was half the fun, he’d learned. “Carry on, I suppose.”
He’d died in the forest once, would he have to die of embarrassment too, without having done anything even remotely sexually adventurous?
Potter dropped into the other seat. “You know the one. That irresistible one, where you look half evil, half adorable at the same time.” Draco felt his face heat, and Potter delivered a double whammy of charming grin, and wink. A deadly combination, as far as Draco was concerned. “I like it when you blush.”
“Oh,” Malfoy’s eyes fluttered, and his hands came up to rest on Harry’s hips. “You’re in a bit of a state, Potter.”
“Of course, but let me do it. You’re too heavy handed. If I leave you in charge, I won’t even be able to taste the asparagus. Or see it.”
Malfoy stood there for a beat, and just looked at him. “The Centaurs Arms,” he said eventually, and returned back to his desk. Harry watched him complete a series of charms to clean and press his uniform robes, then hang them carefully on his coat hook, and then pick up the satchel ready to leave. “You ready?”
Draco laughed. “Not that traditional. I was...I had someone I was sleeping with for a while, but not anymore.”
Draco smirked and checked his nails. “That's not how I’d pronounce it, but you might be onto something Potter. Seriously though, what do they pay you for?”
And Harry felt different. Maybe he even looked a bit different, perhaps something around the eyes. While he was busy locking down unwanted thoughts about the state of his mental health, it seemed like something else had been unlocked in its place. His lashes were damp and clumped together in wet spikes. He was clean now, and dripping steadily onto the bathroom tile, heavy drops of water which splashed onto his shoulders and trickled down his spine. Yes, he looked different. Like he knows something new, understands something now. It’s a knowledge he can thank Malfoy for, knowing his own body a little better, his own desires.
riding him,” Harry said, hot and annoyed, just as Ginny returned, finally, and the fresh jug of cocktail was set down heavily, sloshing wildly.
But she wasn’t going to be able to fuck him the way he’d truly like, at the end of the day. None of her sort could. So, the fantasy of a wife he could tolerate and the production of at least one Malfoy heir to satisfy his mother was enjoyable, but brief, and Draco thanked her for her time and effort, and used a little wandless to whisk away the wet patch on her sheets before he left. A courtesy, the least he could do. She would never have been suitable, anyway. Muggle.
“This is a formal interview, Malfoy, and I’m required to obtain confirmation from you of any pertinent information, regardless of whether I already know or suspect the answer,” Harry fixed Malfoy with his best stern investigator expression, keen to gain the upper hand and keep it this time. “Is there somewhere we can speak privately?”
It wasn’t about the actual cleaning. Not that Harry was any great fan of that. The thing was, the attic was full of Draco’s things, full to the rafters, and then some. He had so many heirlooms, and things he just couldn’t part with, dozens of chests and trunks and boxes from the Manor after Narcissa had packed up for the Pays de la Loire and donated the building, the grounds, and whatever Draco left inside to a children's charity. Now it was a wizarding primary school and early childhood centre, and Harry had upwards of sixty slumbering portraits of generations of Malfoy’s in his eaves.
He turned, bemused. “Why would I be uncomfortable?” Draco lifted his arms, as if to encompass Bellatrix, and Lucius, and all their school years. Longbottom snorted, and looked back out at the horizon. “Get over yourself. We’re friends, you dull bugger.” He took a deep breath, and shook himself sharply. “I’m getting out. M’freezing my buds off, and there’ll be no fruits on my vine, either, at this rate.” Longbottom started to wade back to the beach. “Don’t get hypothermia.”
Potter must have heard something in his voice. He looked at Draco over his shoulder as he pulled the joggers up over his hips. “Unless - did you want to shower first, or?”
Draco’s eyes drifted involuntarily over to where Potter was sitting with Weasley’s own wife, a heavy-duty Privacy Charm thick around them. He let his eyes slide past them to the bain marie, reluctantly, and considered his options. “Rendang and coconut rice, with a roti.” When Draco looked back at him, Weasley had a knowing smirk on his face, and Draco felt a bit hot.
Draco felt a familiar lump in his throat. “Well. There might not be anything to step into, anymore.”
Lunch was actually a bit of a fraught exercise. The Atrium was in no better a state than it had been when Draco was passing through at a quarter past eight, although the corridors and offices in the various levels seemed relatively normal (aside from the double thickness of memos in the air). All of Creatures seemed to be there, doing their best to direct pigeons and elves alike, with a team from Dispatch set up at a makeshift mail processing station in front of the memorial fountain. Their choices were to brave their way through it, in order to get out of the Ministry and have a chance at some decent nosh (which would, on the downside, mean they’d be forced to make their way back through the chaos and muck again when they were done), or stay in and brave the equally daunting prospects in the Refectory bain marie. As much as Draco would have liked to inflict Weasley on Hawksmoor, they were better off getting this done quickly. Even if it did mean a leathery and lukewarm lasagne and wilted garden salad.
“One of your lot,” Harry says, and nicks a bit of potato. He licks a smear of feta off his thumb, and Malfoy’s eyes follow every movement hungrily. “Zabini, I think, or it could be Parkinson. It may actually be both, if I know Gin.” He’s pretty sure it’s both.
“Who else would be here?” Draco murmured absently, half focussed on his work, half on the memory of Potter falling back against plum-coloured sheets.
Harry turned to face Malfoy fully with a small sigh. Malfoy seemed not to register surprise at all to see Harry, as if he’d always known he’d eventually show up.
Draco gave him a look. “Because I know you, Potter. Also, Ron mentioned you’re off magic for the week, and I know you don’t know where we keep the matches.”
Draco cut Potter's confession off at the lips, kissing him again with something nearing desperation. And this time, Potter kissed back.
Malfoy was still pretending he wasn’t awake for it, though, so Harry humped him lightly for a few minutes every morning, before nuzzling Malfoy’s neck, and rolling out of bed to finish off in the shower.
The rest of the day passed in a blur of parchment and regulations. Draco was almost surprised to see the clock read five o’clock when he finally looked up from his desk, and stretched, his muscles cramped and protesting, and almost every joint cracked noisily. There was a rap at the door, and Draco picked up his wand and opened it, revealing a traumatised-looking Potter on the other side. Every strand of hair on his head was standing on end, and the collar of his robes had become twisted drastically to the right.
have you been keeping it from me?” Malfoy pointed accusingly at Harry with a mayonnaise coated fork. “I thought you said we were friends.”
About twenty minutes later, Blaise lifted his head from the pensieve. Draco had chewed his lip near to ribbons. “Well?”
Harry threw down a card with annoyance. “I feel like I shouldn’t have to remind anyone, but I did die to save you all, not that long ago.”
Draco muttered something under his breath about ‘organised’, and snorted. “Well. We needed seven rooms, and three of them are basically done. We’re practically halfway there.”
Harry groaned, and dropped his hands to glare at Malfoy. “I’m not a monk, either, Malfoy, I’m just a very-”
Draco was curled up in a ball under his bedclothes when he heard the first hesitant knock at the door.
“Right, protect the cashmere, sure,” Potter gave him a very thorough look over. “That’s one issue. The other — not sure how to put this delicately…I can see the full outline of your cock.” He looked down pointedly and added, “And your balls.”
“Hey. Pretty boy.” A man stepped abruptly into Harry’s personal space. “You look like you want your dick sucked.”
That wasn’t why he couldn’t sleep, although the sugar alone made him feel like he was buzzing slightly, and he was definitely feeling quite squiffy. And knowing Draco was in the house definitely didn’t help. There was something about knowing he was here, laying down in bed, even if it wasn’t Harry’s bed. He’d taken off his clothes at some point, Harry assumed, and that made him feel extra wobbly when he thought about it. Harry didn’t know, and would never ask, what Draco wore to bed. Had he been nude at any point under Harry’s roof, tonight? Probably had, since Harry’d given him towels, and showed him where the bathroom was. Draco had been nude in his house. Draco had definitely touched his naked cock, in some shape or form, in Harry’s house.
The curry was tepid, and too salty. The rice was dry, and the roti rubbery. Draco poked at it sadly, while Weasley inhaled his jacket potato smothered in beans.
“Of course we don’t, Malfoy. That would be insane.” Oh, Draco realised, wiping his mouth carefully with his thumb. Potter was mocking him.
Malfoy leaned closer and pointed to the opposite corner of the club. “Over there - can you see? You better go and see what they want.” With a slight push in the back from Malfoy, the man ambled off as abruptly as he’d arrived, and he was soon lost in the mass of people.
Potter laughed again, and sat up, Summoning a pair of joggers from a chest of drawers across the room. “You’re not going to go home in the raw, are you? I mean, I know it’s Floo to Floo, but still. Imagine if you ended up in the wrong fireplace? Imagine if you burned something sensitive on the way through!”
Harry kissed Draco’s chin. “You’re just keeping me humble. Who knows how out of control my ego would get if you started agreeing with me all the time.”
Morgan and the opera glasses were pressed so closely together, there was a good chance the lad may end up with a bruised eye. “Definitely tea, Mr Malfoy, although he’s gone for the commemorative Uruguay mug from the 2005 World Cup instead of the china.”
But not tonight. Tonight, routine and well-worn pattern was out, and the unexpected was well and truly in. Tonight his heart beat a little faster, and adrenaline sizzled through his veins. Tonight, all that habit and certainty seemed boring. Tonight, Malfoy's hands had wandered ever so carefully over his body, his lips had teased his ears and neck. He’d whispered to Harry that he was sexy, and Harry had felt it. He’d believed it.
Draco would have laughed, but that would have required using muscles which were currently strained to buggery, so he just made a noise instead and hoped it wasn’t too pathetic.
Malfoy wasn’t heading to line up, however; he was sauntering directly up to the bouncer with a wide smile. “Evening, Martin.”
“Not sure. I’ve got a lot on.” That was perhaps the biggest lie he’d told in recent memory. Weasley looked unconvinced.
“How dare you,” Draco said, and Potter grinned at him, orange, flaky pasty smile gone, and charming white one back where it belonged. He felt his neck heating up, and Draco cleared his throat and looked down at his desk, brushing away a non-existent speck of dust and straightening an already perfectly square blotter. “Well, Potter, don’t just sit there looking foolish. If we’re going to be working together for good instead of evil, then we better get on with it before the big meeting or I’ll have to explain to Pansy’s children why there’s no ice skating this winter, and Uncle Draco will be in a great deal of trouble.”
“You’re next to useless already, Potter,” Draco said, refusing to look at him anymore, instead opening his desk drawer and retrieving his folio of proposals for the impending meeting. “Be back here in five minutes.”
“Exactly,” Harry said again. “What do you make of this, though? I have some thoughts, but I’d like a second opinion, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“Nope,” Ron said with a grin, and scooped several salted macadamia nuts from the dish in front of Draco, throwing them into his mouth and chewing. His grin soon turned into a grimace. “Wow, that did not taste like what I expected. Sort of a weird texture, innit?”
Draco stood in front of him now, and had gently wrapped his long fingers around Harry’s wrists. His own fists were clenched, and he focused on meeting Draco’s lovely grey eyes, which had softened again, as they often did, and on the warm touch sliding down his wrists to clasp his slowly opening hands.
Bioluminescent plankton on the Norfolk coast. That was what Draco was doing instead of the runespoor case with Potter. He’d heard it was going well, Agatha had owled once or twice to ask questions, because Draco actually was the more knowledgeable of the two of them, not that Robards would know that.
Harry barely looked at Malfoy as he led him out into the reception area, and toward the lab. Mercifully, Vicky and the rest of the team had headed home for the day - while Malfoy’s brown paper bag was small and discreet, and unlikely to rouse any suspicion about its contents, Harry felt that his own behaviour must be signalling to all and sundry that something lewd was afoot. His heart was pounding, and Subconscious Hermione was tutting at him, silently, but judgmentally.
“Don’t bother going there Potter, not until we’ve checked. The Cum Den is revolting, it’s a real- Lester! How are you, old man? Oh, well enough, you know how it is. Look I wouldn’t bother you, but I’ve just had a customer drop in trying to return a Sensual Lover dildo, and I didn’t sell one so I thought maybe it might have been one of yours? Yeah, I have the serial number actually, would you mind?”
He wanted French flax linen hotel sheets, and the prickle of a slight sunburn that would darken his skin just enough to cause his hair and eyes to glow like a Veela. He wanted fresh oysters, and moussaka, and crisp but expensive casual shirts unbuttoned at the throat and rolled up at the elbows. He wanted olives, and cold white wine, and the salt smell of the Myrtoan sea. He had at least three paperbacks to get through and some new Muggle thing Pansy had got him called an iPod, that was filled with music she called ‘chillout electronica’. He wanted horseback riding in the hills. He wanted fresh goat cheese on warm flat bread. He wanted dolmades and hot, fresh tyropita. He wanted a sunbed on Vrelos Beach. He wanted honey-soaked baklava on the terrace of his hotel after a sweaty night of fucking. He really, really wanted the sex.
Harry aimed a kick at him, which Malfoy dodged nimbly, laughing. “Arsehole. Like you’re any better.”
Draco’s voice was ever so slightly breathless, and his fingers  were tight in Harry’s hair. “We’ll get an elf service, you twit.”
“Won’t,” Harry said grumpily. “Fine, leave me then. I’ll just waste away here, and be eaten by Doxies. You’ll see.” Draco sighed, and Harry felt a growing, guilty heaviness in his chest. He knew leaving was hard on Draco too. “Sweetheart. Come here for a sec. Just a second, I promise.” Draco’s jaw was tight, but he came back to stand silently by their bed, and Harry sat properly, and took his hand, kissing each of his knuckles gently before resting his lips on Draco’s engagement ring, and closing his eyes. He felt Draco’s right hand slide into his hair.
my aunt. Dean and Seamus. Bernie and Will from work, and Hagrid, I can’t believe you left him off. Oh, and you forgot Hannah.”
Harry closed his eyes and visualised his spell analysis report, which in his mind’s eye was obscured by layer upon layer of translucent, aggressively wobbling dongs. He took a deep breath through his nose, inhaling the comforting scent of the tea, now balanced atop a stack of reference texts beside the divan; he tasted the chocolate from the biscuits on his tongue; slowly, firmly, he blew out his breath and imagined himself holding a broom, which he used to sweep away the piles and piles of cocks, until he could see the report clearly once again.
The buzzing reached inside him, but the second arm of the toy spread snugly against his perineum and delivered its own maddening tickle from the outside in. He rocked it, deeper and shallower in his arse, thinking about Malfoy.
Malfoy drops the spoon and it ricochets off the high chair tray and onto the tiles, where the lump of pumpkin splats. “Shit!”
When he remembered the dazed, glossy lip look that he’d given a couple of weeks ago, Draco could see the appeal. A student next to him knocked his elbow, and he frowned, shouldering them off as they knocked him out of his fantasy. Blaise cuffed the younger man across his head, and Draco settled back in, hand brushing the cut above his lip.
Harry was more preoccupied with the soft wrinkles decorating the corners of his eyes. His gaze swept over Draco’s face, pondering. Apparently for too long, because Draco leaned in and nipped at his lips again. “Hello, Harry?”
return. The girl was easily spooked, booking down halls or behind doors if he went anywhere near her.
Draco worried at the stupid cut on his mouth again and Potter let out another huff, frustrated and looking at him like he’d rather punch him.
Malfoy gave a small nod in response. He returned to his textbook in front of him, clearly eager to get the attention away from his person.
So Harry managed to catch Malfoy alone again, hand wrapped around the back of his own neck as he stuttered forward almost as painfully as the first time.
Even more threatening to Harry’s sanity was that this was creeping into his free time. He wouldn’t call it stalking, no. If asked, he would vehemently deny it.
The blonde pulled it apart after a couple of tries, tapping it almost carelessly and looking down at the sketch.
This may, or may not, have been the reason why Blaise considered him a messy eater. Draco had cast more stain cleaning spells in the past two months than he’d done in his entire life. After getting kicked out of the library with one of the nastiest glare’s he’d
Sated and with warmth flooding through his veins, Harry slumped against the taller form in front of him. He heard Draco huff, and then felt them be slowly lowered to the hearth in front of the fire. “Hmm...Happy Holidays.”
Harry had spent too much time reveling in the sight of Malfoy’s mouth. He’d never considered kissing. Kissing. Hesitantly he pressed his thumb to his mouth, rubbing it along his lips. It felt wrong. Harry’s hands were far too calloused from Quidditch, and even if they hadn’t been, he didn’t think his fingers could feel as soft.
Harry continued, humming thoughtfully every so often, stroking himself leisurely. He was more than happy to let this go on for hours, as long as Draco would allow. Seeing Draco throw him impatient looks had him pulsing fat drips he wanted to smear into his skin. Let it sit there.
Schedules had never been a priority for him, only that he was able to take the classes he needed to graduate. With his status being less than subpar at the Slytherin table, he’d found himself dreadfully alone in the mornings - Goyle hadn’t returned. Pansy and Blaise would often be around for lunch or dinner times, but neither had bothered to try for a morning class to make up. Or rather, they hadn’t needed to, both pre- and post-War situations not calling for their academic prowess.
That had left Draco rather alone. More than he’d like to admit. But, given the circumstances, Draco kept his frustrations to himself.
To his left, Ron was shoveling several spoonfuls of piping hot oatmeal into his mouth at an alarming rate. It wasn’t pretty, but there was definitely a technique. Over the years, Harry had determined that yes, Ron had developed the habit of eating quickly as a result of having to fight his siblings for it, regardless of however caring Molly was. The quality of it had never been a question. It was the drive to actually be able to eat it.
Potter cleared his throat. “Right, then just - “ he didn’t raise his eyes again, and only made to push Draco to the side. He slid open the door. Draco pretended a chill didn’t go up his back. Ignored the warmth he wanted to lean into. “It’s clear. I’ll...I’ll see you around, then.”
Harry half expected to see something similar to the sketch he’d received in third-year. But he was disappointed, flattening it out to reveal the terrifyingly elegant scrawl for both a seventh year boy and a silently cast spell.
One moment Draco was leaning against the wall, the next his knee was being bashed into and his whole equilibrium was being thrown back and down to the stone floor below. Someone over the edge of it had had a similar event. They let out a pained groan before jumping up.
With a flick of the eyes down the table to make sure no one was watching, he’d dropped his mouth down to the side to lap at it. In that moment, the feeling of being watched increased and dread crept its way up his spine. The glance to the left and right still told him no one was paying any particular attention so, who -
So food could be exciting, and a little scary, for a variety of reasons. But it had never been sexual.
“Ah, well, a sure fire attempt, Mr. Potter. Now, Mr. Malfoy, would you care to try?” And trust Malfoy to go a step further, he didn't touch his own supplies and nodded towards Harry's things.
He sat in the library for nearly an hour lost in thought; his own kissing experience was fairly limited. Far more so if he considered how many boys he’d kissed. It made something warm spread across his stomach when Harry considered that maybe Malfoy was the same. Malfoy still seemed confused at Harry’s actions, even if he continued to taunt him during meals.
Silent casting and advanced manipulations of various charms they’d learned over the years were par for the course these days. Although they had significantly improved a vast number of them, Flitwick still managed to find some charms here and there that threw the group for a loop. No House showed any particular skill in these classes, and for once Harry was grateful they all seemed to struggle together.
“Going to - going to cum,” he rasped. Draco let his mouth slack, and felt the length of Harry’s cock tense against his tongue as it pumped cum down his throat. Idly horny but entirely too tired to do anything about it, Draco licked Harry through his orgasm as he lazily palmed his own hardness.
“Guess? Or are you too fascinated by my face?” Even as he said it, his face flushed. The prat would probably blame it on the fire next to them if Harry said something. He briefly licked over his own lips, his mouth again, trying to get a feel for it.
That was good. It was good. They were good. Draco blinked again, entirely too aware of Potter’s eyes on him. He had to look anywhere else, because his eyes were still on Draco’s mouth and that was - that was too much for him to understand at that moment. His hands tapped the edges of the door he was against.
It was late. The evening before they broke for the holidays. Heat licked at the sides of Harry's legs from the fires burning their way to ashes in the kitchens as he kicked them out against a counter.
Only the pink of Malfoy’s tongue, his bitten lips pouting as he stared down his essay, sent all the blood in Harry’s brain to his cock. Just the thought of
Harry had never been allowed to touch. And now he could. Touched as reverently as he was allowed, as eagerly as he could, catching everything and anything Draco gave him.
From the look he received from Malfoy, it wasn’t his best work, nor enough to distract the wizard from this morning. In fact, now Malfoy seemed curious, hands drumming the sides of the desk impatiently.
He’d barely gotten a nod out of the other before his lips were being sucked, pulled between Harry’s, a careful tongue making a light, soft tap at the sweetness transferred over. Draco sighed, gradually opening his mouth more, letting the sweet heat of Harry’s mouth melt into the surrounding berry flavours, feeling himself lean into the arm offered to him.
So Draco had gone about his time hiding in the mornings. And, as hyper aware that he was, he could always, always feel Potter’s eyes on him. It had happened a couple of times, the awkward eye-catch that had resulted in them struggling to infantilize the situation and stick their tongues out at one another and yet both sharing a ghastly, ghastly reminder that no, it wasn’t there. So curt nods, or dismissive shakes of the head became the norm.
After a moment where Draco felt a fool for talking to thin air, Potter’s head appeared, eyes looking back at him, clearly edging to get away. Perfect.
The entirety of sixth year was a blur to him. Draco, to this day, couldn’t remember much past a few weeks towards the end of it. He’d been so paranoid he doubted he’d acted in a manner most considered normal. And now - now he wasn’t sure how to act. He’d copied Blaise for the majority of it, eyes staring down anyone who dared to comment. It worked.
Despite what he’d often said loudly, and at large, Draco found the food very agreeable. It wasn’t the refined meals that his family used to eat, nor could he expect them to be. But summer's past spent in fear had definitely taught him to be grateful. And he was.
“Not even close, it’s - ah - would you - “ Harry had placed his thumb just inside Draco’s mouth, smearing the remainder of it across his lips. Grey eyes considered him, both enticed and confused at the motion. Draco dropped his mouth open more, letting Harry essentially pet his tongue, apparently fascinated with whatever Harry’s eyes were doing at the sight. “Would you prefer I be sucking something else, Potter?”
Harry pressed his mouth to the scar on Draco’s lip, and Draco sighed again, more than content to lay together until the holiday started.
Malfoy pulled back to take a breath and rolled to his side, hair no longer smooth but nicely tousled and possibly grass stained.
Draco momentarily touched his fingers to his lips before he dropped them. He flicked his eyes across the hall, watching for Potter. He didn’t even know if he’d left. The stalker was probably still around, he wouldn’t be seen fantasizing. At that thought, Draco strode as quickly as he could down the stairs, heart racing.
The second meeting was nearly as awkward, if only because Malfoy appeared to be caught off guard, again. The third had been a total disaster, anger getting the better of the two of them. But it had led to the fourth, with Harry sitting on a hidden alcove in the grounds, with Malfoy next to him.
Draco went about his normal breakfast routine before classes. Or as normal as it could be given the circumstances. He’d gotten used to the routine by now. Get up, get dressed, and set his shoulders before walking out to the Great Hall and ignoring any stares or commentary as he sat down. Alone.
He couldn’t get enough of it. They weren’t even properly snogging, now that he came to think of it. Or maybe Harry had been negatively influenced by Gryffindor mating habits. Who knew. But it couldn’t compare to what he’d seen Ron and Hermione do previously. Hell, Harry didn’t even think snogging Ginny had felt like this. He wasn’t sure what on Earth it was.
that was stuck on Harry’s face - it made him spread his legs a little more, shift them open as he pushed his face up against the fat tip smearing bits of precum against his face. Marking him. His eyes twitched.
Although the rest of the classroom was moving, everyone paying attention to their own attempts, Harry still felt nervous.
He leaned back a bit more, and Potter looked up. Draco did not smirk. He absolutely did not. Whatever he did was better, because Potter blushed. Flushed something pretty even in the dim light of the cupboard.
Harry’s hand trailed down Malfoy’s side lightly as he tilted this way and that to catch his mouth. Feather light presses against his body, but his mouth was clearly saying something else. His thumb caught against Malfoy’s stomach and he felt the other teen shift towards him, hips hitching forward.
Potter continued to look at him and kept biting his lip, opening his mouth and then closing it again - worrying his lower lip with his teeth and since when did Draco even -
Draco wasn’t a slut for cock, he’d never considered himself one. He’d definitely suck Harry’s cock. He’d done it before, and would happily do it again. But this - this weird teasing, the strange
Harry spent the next few days avoiding Malfoy. At all costs. He looked at other boys, watched their faces and their eating habits just to see. Fortunately or not, Harry found that there was nothing attractive about the way Gryffindor boys ate. Or Hufflepuffs. Or, after searching enough, anyone else.
He almost wanted to push Harry away, jaw sore and eyes still watering but he couldn’t. Not with that
The look on Potter’s face the next morning when he licked at the cut repeatedly during class was worth the massive headache. There was something going on there, and he’d get to the bottom of it.
A gasp made its way out of Draco’s throat as Harry pulled himself loose, hands twitching as he became oversensitive. He let the tip press itself loosely against his lips once more, eyes half-lidded in exhaustion.
Something drove him to do the insane. He kept his eyes locked with Potter, and pulled his mouth back. The oil was still smothered on his lips so he slipped his tongue back out to catch it and Potter flushed darker than Weasley on a bad day.
Draco could taste the precum leaking into his mouth, being spread against his tongue before being shoved further back into his mouth. His throat was hot, becoming tense as it was pressed at again and again. When he was given the chance Draco sucked, lips pushed to the tip and not letting Harry move as he flicked his tongue again and again against the slit, dipping into it and watching him writhe above him. They fought. Of a sort.
Draco coughed a moment, licking his lips and cringing some, eyes glancing around the area for something to wash the taste away. He had a lap full of Harry and a bitter, bitter reminder of what just transpired.
Grey eyes stared at him levelly as he worked his way down Draco’s chest, hands idling on the sides, fisted in robes scattered now about them. It never failed to amaze Harry how Draco would never stop looking. Initially he thought he’d be ashamed but no - no the scarring against his lips almost turned Harry on.
“Mmm yeah, I’m fine. Thought I’d forgotten something, but I found it halfway and just thought I’d come straight down.”
“Mhmm...yep,” he drew out the word slowly, tongue absentmindedly coming out to flick at a cut. Blood. Cherry. Interesting combination. Potter froze again, and Draco titled his head up, still dazed.
looking at him again. “Thank you…that was wonderful,” he sighed, eyes closed. Draco laughed against the lips pressing lightly to his. “You’re more than welcome.”
So as much as it pained him, Draco pulled away and took great pleasure in the dazed look on his rival’s face. The only thing worth looking at. Watched Potter chase Draco’s body heat, face tilting slightly forward as if unsure - and
The heat was back again, only this time it spread across his face. Harry grit his teeth and chucked the note in the bin. It meant nothing. Just a side trick to get Harry to mess up - for some reason or other.
Walking down the halls in the dark used to be exciting for Draco. But as he walked back from a session in a spare classroom, he was tense. He was far too alert to be caught off guard by a Prefect, or a Professor at this hour. Not that Draco was up to anything overt.
Draco’s pouted lips as Harry touched his cock to his cheek definitely made the look worth it. “Do you want me to suck your cock or not?”
Settled quite nicely between them, Draco very, very slowly licked his lips in front of Harry. The cream was very, very sweet. Not overly thick, not sickly sweet. He barely had time to consider it, Harry was so close to him.
It was a strange thought, that for years, he could determine Draco’s moods based off of how he looked during meals, and how he’d probably paid more attention than was necessary to how he behaved during the time. Another thought crossed his mind as he watched the young man reach for tea. It would be earl grey, probably a dash of milk or two, some sugar - but for the life of him Harry could not have told someone how Hermione or Ron took their tea.
The dread that had slipped itself up Draco’s spine threatened to fill the rest of him. Heart in his throat, Draco threw a glance down and - no, it was his right hand. He wasn’t sick enough to do such a thing to his left (he’d almost pulled his shoulder several times trying to avoid using the entire arm), but what on Earth could have offended Potter so much?
Harry wasn’t even sure. Just the feel of it was enough to get his cock going. He shifted his hips restlessly, trying to get comfortable as it twitched against the front of his slacks. “Possibly,” he sighed, “this is pretty comfortable, however.”
honestly worried. You, Malfoy? Since when did you give a rat’s arse about her?” She’d shoved him to the side without another glance and ran off.
Harry wasn’t sure why he thought the way Draco ate was anything to get excited over, let alone something he could be attracted to. In fact, Harry wasn’t sure how he could think anything involving food was attractive. There was good food, sure; but before this morning he’d never had a reaction like that.
- “ Someone’s footsteps were coming down the hallway. Draco felt Potter move his body - hand haphazardly disappearing into the air as he was tugged through a door that came out of nowhere.
What was worse was that he couldn’t even confront him on it. Social pressures aside, cornering Malfoy to ask him why he was doing this to Harry was a no go. Even he recognized that. What would he even ask Malfoy, ‘Hey I think you’re trying to seduce me via spoon licking. Please stop it.’?
The eyes shining up at him weren’t - that wasn’t... Potter’s eyes didn’t even try to meet his, they simply stayed at half-mast. Lidded, heavy things that stared, once more, at his mouth.
Later that night, when he was alone, Harry dumped the contents of his bag out onto his bed. Shuffling the books and quills into a corner by his nightstand, he saw Malfoy’s scroll again. More than curious, Harry grabbed it, and found it still wrapped tight.  He was momentarily tempted to bin it, it was after all only a spare bit of parchment.
Being the nosy prat that he was, Draco had gone about trying to suss something out of other Slytherin girls. That hadn’t worked out well. He’d actually had a mild breakdown over the event, sitting in his bed wondering why on earth Greengrass had decided to grow a spine this year of all years.
If magic hadn’t already determined that yes, Harry did have the ability to fly, he’d have nothing to compare it to. But kissing Draco less than twenty minutes past the teacup incident was like walking on air, floating somewhere higher than the rest of the world.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “When I eat.” It wasn’t a question, and Potter just seemed to burn an even brighter red at the insinuation.
Harry shivered. He was starting to think he wasn’t a proper teenager. Featherlight touches on each other’s arms shouldn’t be enough to make him dizzy. Hair tickling his forehead shouldn’t turn him on.
Hands never left Draco’s side as he ducked down a moment, thighs spreading apart to make the distance between them smaller. Harry sighed, letting the sight before him sink into his brain.
And as Harry picked at his own leftovers from the morning, he thought back on his own habits. He was similar to Ron in that manner, that yes, food should be eaten as quickly as possible while it was available, but it had taken some time. He could even remember the first few weeks of first year thinking that maybe he should hide some food in his room for later, just in case it didn’t come back. In fact, much like himself and other Muggle-born children, there’d been a sort of fascination and fear of the food presented. A lot of the foods were exciting - magic could come up with an amazing array of pasties and sweets - but some were just plain odd. He could remember numerous times where they’d been provided food that was outright dangerous if you prepped it wrong or timed a bite on an off-moment.
The parchment in front of Harry began to tremble a bit, and he watched as letters started to form themselves into words across it, but they were moving too quickly for his eyes to catch. Either way, he didn’t have long to read before it wound itself up tight, sealed.
“You want to - gah - look with your cock? That’s new, Potter. Even for you.” Draco’s face scrunched up a little, but the feel of his cheeks, the soft plush of his lips as Harry passed the tip teasingly over them to the other side - was heaven.
Draco had no sense of where to hold him, held immobile against the door behind them and forced to concentrate on the kiss and nothing else. He wanted to melt, wanted to simply sink into the warmth, the relief that he offered with his lips. Someone had to be proud of him for it; Malfoy’s lived off indulgences and dared others to deny them things, it simply wasn’t done.
Want. Clear, unadulterated want was everywhere on the flushed face before him. Draco wasn’t sure how long either of them stared at the other, but he was becoming even more intimately familiar with Potter’s fringe and scar than he’d thought possible. How the line etched itself above a currently bunched brow. How his skin split and webbed itself together, sloping over his nose, spotted with a spare freckle or two. Could feel his chest hammering against his own, and felt something heated pressing against his thigh.
Two flicks of his wand and he’d had a cup of tea stirring itself at his elbow. Careful not to dip his hands into any of the jams or condiments ahead, he’d pulled in some toast and butter. This was a strange bit of shame for him. Draco had been perfectly fine with most kitchen spells, having spent some of his childhood trying to imitate the way the elves set things, determined to be worth more than someone set in a rag beside him. But he’d never been able to get rid of some strange acrid flavor when it came to spreading or mixing dairy. It drove him insane for years until he’d finally given up and done it the Muggle way. He blinked. Human way, he supposed.
Draco got up with false reluctance. “Don’t ruin my risotto, Potter, I’ve been looking forward to it all day.” He bumped softly into Harry, and pressed his face into his shoulder. Harry put his free arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close.
Draco had by now pulled the jumper on, and of course it looked phenomenal, after all. Everything looked great on Draco. In fact, he had shrugged into a peacock blue velvet blazer, and wrapped an enormous black Ferragamo scarf around his neck almost absently as he sifted with the other hand through a mountain of boxes and bags. “Is this all for me?” Draco looked at him with huge eyes, and Harry sighed again, and nodded. “Harry this is - this is like a million pounds of Muggle designer fashion. Just sitting here.” He had unearthed a gorgeous pair of Berluti loafers with a bitten off moan, and had slipped them on too.
A fine, yellow mist moved from his head down to his chest, and pulsed lightly for a few moments before moving on. “Wizards like yourself with very powerful magical cores often need some extra assurance. It’s probably second nature to you to Summon things non-verbally, and without your wand, yes?” Harry nodded, feeling a bit red in the face at the mention of powerful magical cores. “You wouldn’t have even meant to do it, maybe you’d’ve reached for your glasses in the morning and they’d be just out of reach, and then BANG!” Harry jumped, “And if the curse was mucking with your magic, you might have exploded.”
“Fuck off, you prick,” Harry laughed, but only because his neighbours were old and mostly deaf. “Thank you for coming ‘round.”
The smell of him still filled Harry’s nostrils, from the brief moment Malfoy was pressed against him in the lane - he’d desperately wanted Malfoy to kiss him then, and the needy tug of desire showed no sign of easing with distance or fresh park air. Harry was fairly sure he’d never felt so frustrated, and he was definitely positive he’d never felt more like taking someone home, or being taken home by them, with the unequivocal intent to fuck. But here he was, standing in a park in Islington at ten to two in the morning, with three quarters of an erection and a very slight ringing in his ears.
The upper hand was his again. He could absolutely pull off casual and dismissive now that he had caught Potter sucking on a lukewarm tea bag.
“It was for work!” Harry said, far too loudly, absolutely roasting hot in the face. “I needed to run some tests. For the case!”
, and said loudly, "I - erm, yes, thanks. Good. Please bring an invoice, I'll pay you right away - galleons are fine? A promissory note will take longer to arrange..."
“Potter doesn’t say anything unless it's to beg me to give it to him harder,” the words were out of his mouth before he could help himself. He should have denied it, but what would the point have been. She clearly knew something. He never could pull a fast one on Hermione Granger, and certainly not after several glasses of gin.
“Can you remember the first time you felt desired, Potter?” His lips were nipping at Harry’s ear with every word, and fuck, but Harry was hard, so fucking hard. He felt too hot. It was difficult to focus.
"I imagine you'll be needing this quickly and discreetly, Potter, and probably not flying through the halls of the Ministry by owl.” That was a very good point, actually. “I can-" Malfoy hummed slightly. "I can be at your office at a quarter to five this afternoon, if that suits?"
“That’s right,” Potter appeared beside them. “Fifth year. Draco made up a song about it, didn’t you, Draco?” Potter raised an eyebrow at him. “Give us a few lines, won’t you?”
He and Ron were the only ones currently in the communal kitchen. Nev was already out for a run, Malfoy hadn’t yet emerged from the room he shared with Seamus, and Ron was rooming with Foley, who seemed to have gone off on his own as well. They were barely two days into this training rotation, four weeks of rooming together in tight quarters in this Academy flat, and they’d already reached the stage of death threats for loud urination.
Harry let out a surprised bark of laughter, and Malfoy smiled. The tension eased, and Harry felt some of his muscles unclenching.
That cut deeply. Draco picked up his glass with a shaking hand and downed the last of his gin. “Well, fuck. Tell me what you really think, Granger.”
It had been about a month since he last went to bed with Potter, when he walked into a briefing room and found him waiting there. Well, Potter and about a dozen other Aurors, of course, but it felt like it was just the two of them. He tried his best to concentrate, took diligent notes, answered questions when asked, and did not look at Potter once, even when Potter had asked him a follow-up question.
Agatha sighed, and held out the parchment pointedly. “He’s literally specified. ‘Deputy Head Potter, Field Division, requests Senior Officer Malfoy personally undertake analysis of the runespoor poisons case and provide a report at his earliest convenience.’ He’s actually underlined your name, twice.”
Draco surveyed the labyrinth of crates and trunks, and blew out a long breath. “And Weasley’s willing to consider anal, you say?”
“Remember you said that,” Potter said ruefully, as he came fully into Draco’s office, and stood beside his chair. “Trust me?”
Malfoy hummed in agreement, and reached out to touch one of the cocks without hesitation. “Oh! It’s - I wasn't expecting it to feel so warm.”
Some hours, and several pints later, Malfoy slapped one hand decisively on the tabletop. “Home time, I think.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy said, his voice light and dangerous. Furious, then. Murderous, maybe. They reached their office door, and Malfoy opened it and didn’t bother to wait for Harry to enter first, as he usually would. He went instead directly to his desk, and started shuffling through their files with brutal speed.
- that maybe the next time they were sitting quietly in the parlour watching the Muggle telly together, he might say so. Let Potter know how grateful he was, for everything. For never asking it of him. For not being angry, or bitter, at Draco's seeming ingratitude.
Harry gave Malfoy a look. “Yes, even a hopeless case like me can manage to stand still and leer at people.” He’d meant it to be funny, but Malfoy fixed him with that piercing look again.
“I pity the life you’ve led, Longbottom, if you’ve not had a reason to say ‘penis’ before breakfast.”
“Yes, well. I had to figure out where the, erm, original knob had come from, so. I had to check out a couple of...sex shops.”
“Are you mad?” Harry stared at the mirror, which was sweating profusely and was now a rosy pink. “You’ve never let me leave this room without at least three insults specifically about my hair.” Harry scowled at the glass. “Some of them have really hurt my feelings, actually.”
There was a hand on his shoulder, turning him around - Potter had gotten up and was standing before him, his eyes glittering again, not with tiny images of celebrities and white-haired smiling men; with all kinds of feelings, what of, Draco didn't know, but he wanted desperately to ask Potter to close them and just back away, just a little. But Potter came closer, looking earnest, and Draco had a wild thought, that maybe there was only one way of showing what it had meant, to have someone like Potter forgive someone like
The silence dragged on, and Harry shut his eyes and tried not to panic. Draco wasn’t going to call off the engagement over this. He wasn't going to leave him. This wasn’t good, but it probably wasn’t as bad as
Draco snorted into his glass. “I told you, you’re only a genius if this works. Your other option is ‘idiot’.”
Granger gave him a look, and pulled out the chair opposite him. “I was going for more of a Top Gun reference, but sure. Does this make me Crito?”
Kisses on his wrist. He could feel Draco’s pulse flickering under the soft skin, there. “You dreamed of me making you Nutella-based pudding as a teenager?”
That got a snort from Malfoy, and Harry looked up at him quickly and away again. “So what happened next, Potter?”
“So...you’re upset that I took responsibility away from you?” Potter transitioned from blank to confused. “But you’ve got so much work to do already, I thought you would have been happy to have less on your plate.”
Stepping in front of the wardrobe mirror, Harry pulled his tshirt slowly over his head and dropped it somewhere in the vicinity of the washing hamper. He remained still, just looking at himself.  A little rumpled, more so than usual. Differently than usual. He could kind of see what the bathroom mirror was saying earlier, about his hair. A bit wild. Like maybe he’d had someone's hands running through it, clenching it in handfuls in a moment of pleasure...his eyes seemed darker than usual, too, and his cheeks flushed, and his mouth looked fuller than normal, like his lips were almost swollen. Like he’d been kissing. Or biting. Sucking.
“Yeah,” Harry said again, confused. “That’s why I made it, you noodle.” Draco just stared at him, until Harry rubbed his hand through his hair self-consciously. “What?”
Oh, Christ. Saying it out loud would mean people knowing, and people knowing would mean pressure, and pressure would mean Harry couldn’t avoid things like he normally would, and he really had ordered too much food, what had he been thinking-
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “But you didn’t accept.” It wasn’t a question. Harry shook his head, once.
“How’s work, Harry?” Ginny stretched out a leg and poked his shoulder with her foot. “Anything exciting happening in the world of cursed Muggle objects?”
Malfoy’s smile was liquid. “You look good, Potter. Scruffy suits you. Never managed to pull it off, myself.” Harry immediately had at least fourteen simultaneous fantasies of Malfoy pulling himself off and bit down on his lower lip, hard. “I suppose I was always a bit jealous of you in school for that. The effortless sex appeal, just-jumped-off-a-broom thing. It was magnetic.”
“Partly because she knows no one would have me, partly because I asked her not to.” It was sad in a way that was a bit like relief, as well. “She’s taking it pretty well. She’s got Teddy to dote on, now that she’s made up with her sister.” Draco chewed on his lip, tore a bit of dry skin off and winced as the salt water immediately stung the raw patch. Longbottom was looking off into the distance. “Some families should just let their fruits die on the vine.”
He looks so upset that Harry can’t bear it. He’s shaking with laughter as he puts his hands on Malfoy’s neck, thumbs his jaw, and kisses him. Malfoy’s mouth opens in apparent surprise, and Harry slides his fingers into Malfoy’s hair, and his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth.
The clouds rolled in so quickly, that they hardly had enough time to snatch up glasses and plates, and race back inside as fat drops began to hammer down on the canopy, and drip slowly through the leaves. The two of them lingered, though. Draco smiled, and touched Harry’s forehead, pushing a dripping curl back on his head.
“It’s barely four o’clock,” Draco laughed softly, and Harry caught him up and swung him around. “I said four.”
Potter led the way to the kitchen. He made the tea quietly while Draco watched, and they drank it mostly in silence together, speaking only to ask for milk, or sugar, or for a teaspoon. Draco contemplated his tea leaves and wondered what fate had in store for him next.
Draco snatched up various papers, and marched out the door. Potter could follow him, or be left behind.
“On the table,” Potter said with a waggle of his brows, and Draco gave him another two fingers for his trouble. “Seriously though, I’m happy for you to take the lead on this. I’m only the consultant, after all.”
This was the plan. This was going according to plan. Draco swallowed his nerves, and rolled onto his back. He pushed the jersey up, right up under his armpits, so one nipple could be seen, then he arranged his legs so it was clear he still had no pants on, without going for a full frontal shot of his bare cock. That was more than he was prepared for today. Draco held out the phone and took a flurry of snaps. Some of them were a bit blurry, some very clearly included his whole entire dick, but he found just the right one: back arched, nipple out, hint of rough hair low on his belly. It was clear he was sprawled in bed, but he thought it couldn’t hurt to say so, just to be absolutely crystal clear, and he sent that off too before he could change his mind.
Draco's hands were travelling through Harry's messy locks of hair, that curled everywhere, as Harry pulled him closer.
He slowly picked the letter, nervousness buzzing inside of him. He couldn't help thinking that the owl must've gotten lost, though there was no way any owl as smart as this one wouldn't have recognised the glaringly Slytherin dorms.
So going back up to the dorms, walked toward the room. The thoughts swirling around in his head were making everything blurry. He remembered his heart stopping as he heard footsteps behind him, and whipped his head around, only to find a big cat.
But the worry reached a peak. A peak of fear. On Wednesday morning. An owl swooping over the breakfast table on dropped something unfamiliar to Draco. A letter. It seemed normal to the others. But Draco knew better.
A very weary looking Remus Lupin opened it, and his face lit up in surprise as he saw Draco. He waved his hand, and Draco walked in, eyeing the bottles of a familiarly fiery smelling potion from which rings of smoke were rising from.
"Well, what is it then?" asked a confused Ron. "You've been staring at him the entire breakfast now, mate."
Harry was sitting, knees drawn to his chest, by the fire. He'd never looked so vulnerable. His eyes were filled with the ghost of fear, and his mouth was slightly parted, as the glassy reflection of flames danced in his iris.
"Yes, well, I generally find you to be very distracting," said Draco in a flat voice. He didn't remember allowing those words to escape from his mouth, but it was worth seeing Harry blush.
"You're not that mean, are you? You're just hurt," she said gently. "I can see it in your eyes. They can tell a lot about you, you know. Your eyes, for example, look deep, like they're hiding endless emotions. I'm Luna, by the way. Luna Lovegood."
enjoy this, wouldn't they?" Draco sneered. But something about the remark sounded hollow and defeated. Draco had never shown this side of him to anyone. This was scary.
"I had a friend in a very similar situation," Lupin said, and a faint smile appeared with the memory. "He was- um- not their perfect son, shall we say. His parents tried to force their traditions and bigotry on him. He was kind of, let's say, the Black sheep of the family," said Lupin with a little chuckle.
McGonagall's office was much warmer than Remus remembered. The window beside him let in glaring rays from the nearing full moon, which prickled Remus's skin as sickness pooled in his stomach. He uncomfortably sat down in the cushioned chair, hands under his thighs.
The noise in his head was too much. He wanted to scream, to cry, to shout, but at the same, just wanted it all to stop. He squeezed his eyes shut, and walked towards the doors, feeling the cold rush of wind blowing his hair back and screaming in his ears.
Draco felt a cold shiver run down his spine. He'd heard about Sirius through his family, and was altogether very confused about the situation, but Sirius was clearly out for murder, which almost scared Draco. Anyone belonging to the Black family was probably delirious in some way or the other.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but words were caught at his throat. He didn't want to do this. But he didn't want to keep running as well. "Okay then," he replied in a softer voice than he wanted. "But, uh, Harry?" Harry looked up at him. "Are you going to be there?"
"I promise, anything you say will stay within this room if you want, though I'm sure our teachers are more than capable of solving any issues."
"However," he added, looking at Draco, whose angry gaze was still fixed on the table, "I cannot tolerate any form of crude language or remarks, Draco. I understand, that your
"Excuse me? I'm being responsible!" Hermione's hair was tasseled, and her voice was frantic, but she remained composed. Crookshanks fiddled with a strand of wool, loose from her jumper, as he laid in her arms.
Until everything had become too much. The pictures behind Harry's eyelids made him force them open, as his chest heaved heavily and irregularly. For a second, he didn't know where he was, til the warm colour of the curtains drew him back to the Gryffindor dorms.
Remus pushed open the door, and embraced the warmth of the cosy office. The books were all lined up messily in shelves, Remus recognised them, having borrowed most of them from her. The warm brown walls complemented the leather seat she was sitting in.
"Malfoy? I'd have assumed you weren't the type to impulsively run away," droned Snape, dragging his words out. "As it is," he paused "I am the head of your house. Any of your concerns are to be handled by
Draco had no idea why this memory had struck him now. But it terrified him. His family knew about it. Sirius Black, heir to the Noble and Most Ancient house of Black. There was no way Harry was going to survive. Not if the secrets Draco heard about the family's involvement in dark magic and illegal curses were true.
Professor Lupin was gazing outside the window, and had a look in his eyes that made him look like he was remembering something. He looked nostalgic, and seemed to be in the midst of reliving a memory. The faint smile disappeared however when he noticed Draco, tear stained and breathing rapidly.
But he knew it was impossible. So, he swallowed hard, looked forward, and with his chest out, he walked outside. He was going to face it that way his father would want him to. Maybe he'd finally be true to his family.
"Though I assume this won't happen again, I'm still required to punish you. How about... let's see, detention, Thursday night?" This earnt him a defeated groan from Harry, which made him add "Don't worry, it won't be boring," with a small grin.
He slowly got up from the bed, looking at the warm orange slowly colour the sky, though the waves of the lake blurred and rippled through it. Yawning and stretching, he picked up his Arithmancy book, cursing the subject, before trying to distract himself with it.
Fluttering could be heard in the distance, and Draco furrowed his eyebrows, clambering into a sitting position. Stretching over to open the curtain between the bed posters, Draco peered around to find the source of the fluttering noise.
Draco pushed the blade into his skin, and watched as the glimmering blood rose up from his skin. The mess inside was slowly pouring out, as the pain took over, and the warm blood stained his skin. Tears slipped down from his eyes, blurring his vision.
"O- okay professor," startled Harry. With a warm smile, Lupin dashed off in the opposite direction. Harry couldn't help feeling something, maybe nervousness, maybe excitement, at the prospect of meeting Draco again.
Draco could almost feel himself pulling heavy walls up, as he cleared his throat and put on the mask. "Disgusting. Lupin loved him, like he always does. Well, I suppose I'm lucky to have just gotten detention with it, I mean, imagine if McGonagall had seen me!"
Draco looked up, tears burning his eyes, and gave a small but genuine smile. And without thinking, he reached out and hugged Harry. The action surprised him, but as Harry slowly wrapped his hands around Draco, something warm rose up in both of their chests.
Draco found a paper on the floor, filled with messy notes, and ripped it up, throwing each piece into the burnt-out coal of the fireplace, before slumping onto the sofa. He just couldn't concentrate. Something inside him was threatening to burst out.
"Listen to me, Draco. This is a crime. Not just legally, but morally too. Anyone who does this, no matter what they say, is wrong. This is something no child should ever have to go through, something no one in this world should ever go through."
Draco followed Lupin, keeping his eyes fixed in a glare towards the back of Harry's head. The laughing and teasing behind him was building up his rage. The professor led them into his office, which was much more exciting than Draco cared to admit.
Harry's surprisingly warm hands found Draco's cold one's. Their fingers interlocked, making Draco's heart flutter, along with the thousands of butterflies in his stomach. But the best part was the warm feeling that took over his entire body. The light haired boy managed a small smile,
"Listen, Hermione, Ron, this- this can't be true. It- it isn't, Draco would've told me! Or- or professor Lupin, right?"
"I'm honestly so proud," said Remus, sitting down on the chair in front of her desk, and pushing his briefcase aside. "But as much as I'd like to catch up, I need your help."
He slowed down, but almost fell over when he bumped into Crabbe, who looked bewildered. Harry slammed himself to the side of the wall, and watched as Draco scolded Crabbe. He watched, with a feeling close to nostalgia or longing as Draco stepped outside, the wind blowing harshly against his robes.
But the pictures, they were crowding his mind. Narrow passages suffocating him, a giant, feral dog with bloodied teeth. It was all just too much. He couldn't breathe.
Footsteps echoed off the walls of the stairs. Draco hastily pulled his sleeve up, as he looked at a dark figure that appeared at the doorway. The short hair, and twisted smirk revealed to be Pansy Parkinson, the only one of Draco's friends with any brains.
Turning away, he picked out the Marauder's map, and stuffed his other hand in his pockets while turning back to class. It wouldn't hurt to be a little late, so he wandered around, watching Draco's spot lingering near Luna's. Harry tried to put off the twinge of jealousy he felt.
"What even- keep your hair on. Seriously, what'd you do?" asked Blaise, who had joined in the conversation, much to Draco's displeasure.
Draco hadn't realised the cold sweat that covered his body, the shaking that had taken over him, and the tsunami of tears he was releasing. He violently wiped his cheeks, and waited for his breathing to return to normal.
Harry's hands were surprisingly warm. Their fingers intertwined, making butterflies flutter in Draco's stomach. He could hear Harry's slightly heavy breath, thick with emotions, as they walked up to the classroom. But Draco stopped before the door.
And the sadness was taking over in waves. Pushing him in and out, not allowing him to breathe. He wanted to push just a little harder, so it could all end. So he didn't have to think about the day, about his father, about how everything would turn out.
His heart skipped a beat, as a feeling of dread washed over him. "You didn't hear exactly what he said, did you?"
Draco wiped away his tears and walked with Harry, holding his hand. He looked into Harry's eyes. And Merlin, he could drown in them. Deep, forest green, with shades of the different colours in nature. It also sort of reminded him of an Aurora Borealis, like the one he saw on holiday once.
"If you don't want to face the boggart, that's completely okay with me. I'm very sorry, though, Draco, if there's anything I could do to help you, please don't hesitate to come up to me," said Lupin solemnly.
Draco suddenly sat up in his bed, his heart in his throat beating rapidly. It was another nightmare, thank Merlin, he was still at Hogwarts, far away from his father. He violently wiped away the tears on his face, feeling guilty at being so weak.
Malfoy’s face was doing that thing again, where he smiled mostly with his eyes, and looked amazing. “What, you don’t think I can keep it up long enough?”
Draco was burning hot and clenching tight around him. He rocked and thrust and fucked himself unapologetically over and over, while Harry's eyes swam. He closed his hands around Draco's prick and
“But we made it through another week alive,” Harry said, and it was Malfoy’s turn to grunt a response through his beer.
“He said the joyous misery of requited love,” Hermione translated, as Harry’s mouth was largely muffled by a pillow. Hermione had got pretty good at interpreting his sulky mumbles. They had spent quite a bit of time being miserable together in tents, after all.
Draco sighed heavily. He drew his wand again and closed his office door with a quiet swish. Serious talks with Potter were activities he had always sought strenuously to avoid. “You’re a consultant, Potter. You waltzed in here when you decided you didn’t want to be an Auror anymore, and Scrivener practically fell over himself to offer you the third most senior position in the department-”
“Can’t any of you be serious about this? It's the first time in a decade that I’ve got a prospect and all you can do is take the piss.” He needed better friends. He should start spending more time with Nev, and Luna.
“I think we’re done for the evening,” Malfoy said, eventually. He was almost smirking again, and he hooked one finger through a belt loop in Harry’s jeans and tugged him towards the stairs.
He returned to find Malfoy and Ron sitting alone - the others having gone for fresh drinks, or to the loo, or maybe just home - and their heads were bent rather closely together, in apparently intense discussion.
“Before you go, since you mention it…” Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously. “You haven’t noticed anything that might indicate that I might, well, that if we decide to, you know, have kids…”
“Yes, I’m very scary.” Draco refused to turn and look at Potter, and instead glared across the room to where the waiter was attempting to persuade Orange Robes not to molest the ice sculpture. It was not going well.
Draco turned and gave his most reassuring smile to the witch in the bubble. “We’re on the case, not to worry.” The lift lurched off. Draco’s smile slid into a glare.
Clementine refused to take it. “You know your money’s no good here, Draco. If the Boss got wind of it, I’d be strung up by my tits.”
"Draco!" he shouted, curtains forgotten, neighbors forgotten, pack dropped heavily to the floor and kicked out of the way. "I'm home!"
Bog shrugged. “Bog doesn't know such things as why Bog is. Bog was just Bog, when there wasn’t Bog before.”
“I was thinking,” Potter said, his thumb making circles on the inside of Draco’s wrist. “Maybe we should have a bit of a dance. To celebrate our success – the hourglass is full.” Draco turned his head dazedly to find that the hourglass had indeed been filled, and gems continued to clatter down into the narrow neck of the thing, and were starting to pile up in the upper bulb. “I’m not very good at it, and I actually kind of hate it, but I thought you would probably be quite good, and you might like to.” Potter cleared his throat slightly. “Or, if you don’t, then maybe we can get a drink and have a quiet chat out on the balcony instead.” Draco looked at Potter, and Potter smiled at him, almost shyly.
