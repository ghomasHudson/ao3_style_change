“Draco, it isn’t a big deal. We used to make out all the time.” Harry told him matter-of-factly.
“When you’re the Boy Who Lived, anything will get you on it,” Draco muttered. The two stared at each other, unsure if there was anything else to say. There were a lot of things Draco wanted to tell Harry, but… was it different now?
It was the red silk pajamas that Draco claimed he would never give Harry since it was his favorite.
right now, Ron,” Hermione told him in a whisper, before turning back to look at Draco and Harry, smiling to herself.
After a long banter, Draco was finally able to convince Harry to get into the shower. Draco didn’t seem to realize why Harry was so against going in the shower, but when he got out, it soon wasn’t a mystery anymore.
Classes were starting again, and the first lesson they had on Monday morning was Defense Against the Dark Arts, where Harry and Draco had to sit beside each other.
“Harry, I mean like… other work. Extra credit.”
Draco let out a soft, low moan as Harry’s hands slowly trailed down to his thighs. Harry stopped kissing his neck, slowly looking up at Draco, slowly taking a step back. Draco opened his eyes and nodded at Harry.
“I don’t want you to make up for anything,” Harry scoffed. “We’ve both made so many mistakes. Mistreated each other.”
“Once a day. Daily.”
The Death Eaters left. Harry was able to move again.
“You know why that idea would sound insanely absurd to me, right?” Harry retorted, then shook his head. “I’m sorry. This is weird. I don’t know how I’m supposed to behave around you. It feels like the walls are closing in on me every time you look at me like that.”
She stared at him, watching as he made his way to the kitchen, opening the fridge and getting some leftovers out.
. Real.”
Late March.
“Whatever you say, Draco.”
“How are you, darling?” he asked. “It’s our first time hanging out in two weeks.” he then added quietly, “not as if we’ve spoken about it before that too.”
“I have no right, I don’t, I don’t. But he… he just let her kiss him, he just let her! I know I shouldn’t be so upset, I’m being a huge hypocrite since I kissed Ginny, but I didn’t even want Ginny to kiss me, I don’t even like her. But he might like
Harry held out his wand. The two watched as it trembled in the clasp. He gulped, opening his mouth to speak, then set his wand down, turning around. “I can’t,” he shook his head. “I’m sorry.”
“Harry, it’s not about that,” Draco raised his voice, starting to grow somewhat impatient. “You and I could
“Oh, fucking hell,” she threw a pillow at him, sitting up slowly. She raised an eyebrow when she noticed he let the pillow hit him. “It’s six in the morning, Draco.”
There was a moment of silence. “Compared to…?”
Pansy nodded. “Be right back.” She ran into Draco’s dorm and came back two minutes later with many clothes in her hands. “Let’s go to my dorm, everyone’s already left for breakfast.”
“I can always write it down if that’s the case. I’m not just going to let you stay in the dark if there’s a planned attack.”
“Draco, tell me when it hurts badly. I’ll be there.”
?” Harry asked in astonishment. His head turned to Draco, who looked away in shame. Harry took in a deep breath. Draco turned to leave. “Wait, Draco!” Harry called after him, grabbing his hand. Draco turned at once.
Well, there was one word: love.
Meanwhile, in the Great Hall, Draco kept glancing over to the Gryffindor table, sulking. Pansy, beside him, tugged at the sleeve of his robe. “What’s the issue now?” she asked, following his gaze to see if he had something to say about Potter again.
“What did you do to him?” asked Lucius as he took a small step forward so he could see Harry’s face clearer.
“You didn’t?” Draco said. His hair fell into his eyes. Today he didn’t gel it back for the first time in two years, letting his brown streak be visible. “Anyway, I think it’s safe to say that we probably used up all your Muggle money. I can pay you back in Galleons.”
“There was nothing that could be done. You don’t think I tried warning Dumbledore, even if it was subtle? He told me to stay silent before I could even utter a word… he knew already. And what do you think would happen to Draco if they found out he wasn’t really-”
“I don’t think there’s a way out, Draco,” Harry told him quietly. Draco sighed in defeat. Ron was busy talking to Luna who had appeared to be in the cellar for days.
“They're not love letters, Ron.”
“Well, of course we’ll support you being bisexual,” Ron nodded, “but you can do so much better than Malfoy, mate.”
Slytherin’s victory in first year.”
“Relax, I just saw it the other day over your shoulder. Merlin, it makes me curious what you say in those letters,” She put a hand to her forehead dramatically. “Oh, fuck me daddy!” she cried out. “Fuck me so hard in the broom closet, which is quite ironic-”
“Do you need me to come inside?” Draco asked. Harry shook his head.
“You’ll see, honey.”
He stood up, scoffing. “Of course you need something. Why was I stupid enough to think that you actually were sorry for once? Who am I kidding? You’re a Malfoy. All you’re made of is cowardice and cruelty.”
Harry grabbed him by the chin and carefully turned Draco’s head to look at him in the eyes. “You’re right. I’m Harry Potter. And I love you, because you’ve spent the last four months trying to make sure I don’t die in battle,” he stroked Draco’s cheek. “Because you respect my boundaries. And especially because when you kiss me, everything else seems a little less gloomy.”
“Where is it?” He asked, nostrils flaring. “This isn’t funny.”
“Yeah, I thought I’d go over for dinner or something. But that was when we were still dating,” he put his hands in his pockets, awkwardly shuffling his feet.
“Not my fault that I think you’re deaf, you sit at the front of the class and can’t even hear what the teachers are saying.”
“Yes, thank you!” Hermione said, feeling satisfied that she was going to get some information.
“Why do you care so much?” he asked.
Harry didn’t mean to say it. It just slipped out of his mouth. Draco was getting aggravated at this point. The two were past the tears, only feeling pure anger towards each other now.
“Please leave.”
“I’ll see you on Friday,” Draco signed, opening the door and leaving before Harry could stop him.
“Harry, dear, could you help me out with setting the table?” Molly called from the kitchen, and Harry quickly got up and went as asked, flashing a smile at her as he started helping her out with setting the table.
not sorry.”
“Yeah, it’s fine, go eat,” Harry replied sleepily as he sat up, rubbing his eyes.
“Come, sit down,” Harry said. Draco did as he said and sat down. The two stared at the fire for a few moments.
“Harry, please, give me a chance to explain-”
Draco would be able to quickly sneak out and get his wand and luggage and leave without his father spotting him - just getting out of his room was a problem, as Lucius has locked it before he left.
If any of you are actually still here, thank you. And if any of you were actually waiting for a new chapter, I'm even sorrier, I just had zero inspiration for a while.
“Sounds awesome, cutie.”
He looked up suddenly, frowning. “How did you know?”
Then everyone stood up to get to class. Draco and Pansy bickered all the way to class, about whether Draco was in love with Harry or not.
Draco’s cheeks flushed. He coughed slightly, sitting back down. “You can’t even eat properly,” he mumbled, but he was smiling. “Whatever. I love you too.”
Their hands that were intertwined slowly let go of each other as Draco left the cellar.
“Draco-”
All Draco wanted to do in that moment was to die, because only he knew how much he didn’t deserve the pure love from Harry.
Pansy smiled at Harry. “You came.”
“Hate? Excuse me, that was really hot,” Draco whispered, before jumping on Harry, wrapping his legs around his waist. “You’re really hot when you’re protective, you know that?”
He slowly opened the box and picked up the device, looking up at Harry in confusion. “You got me metal? I mean, thanks? What are these buttons on the side-” Draco let out a blood-curdling scream when the phone lit up, “What the fuck?! What the fuck, what the fu-”
Suddenly, Harry pulled away, wincing and putting a hand to his forehead.
“Sure, mate, see you there.” Ron and the others left, and Harry walked out to the field, walking to the middle, to see Ginny standing there, still in her Quidditch uniform, the Snitch in her hand.
“Calm down, it doesn’t matter. So we got the potion off of Ron and then Slughorn gave us this drink, I don’t really know what it was. But he gave it to us and he started making a toast but by then Ron had already taken a sip and,” Harry had been talking so fast that he stopped to take a breath, “Ron was poisoned. He literally almost died!”
Draco stared at Harry with an amused expression on his face. “And who may that be?” He asked, his lips twitching into a slight smirk. Harry shook his head vigorously and continuously until he felt dizzy again, this time able to regain himself before he could fall over again.
“I would never rip your throat. I’d pull your hair off,” he responded. “I know how much you love your hair, so, you know. I’d do something you’d have to live with for the rest of your life. Baldness.”
“It was two minutes.”
Harry wondered where Draco was. He thought back to the previous years - walking to each others’ compartments, exchanging insults… Harry wanted to see him again. He stared out the window as the train finally started. They were on their way to Hogwarts.
Harry walked to where he had seen the Room of Requirement last. He stared at the blank wall and slowly thought to himself.
of this. I’m
“Draco, don’t,” Narcissa warned, frowning at her son, who was frowning too. She hadn’t seen a single smile on his face since his fifth year. “I’ll go get the owl.”
“It’ll make Draco feel better?” Harry said questioningly. “No, scratch that. It’ll make
Harry immediately started walking after him.
“Harry, you got out of the shower just now, right?” Draco asked as the two walked down the hallways. Lucky for them, no one was in the halls, everyone was busy eating breakfast, so they could walk freely together.
“Ah, yes, Pansy, you assuming I was gay for Harry Potter right since the beginning and thinking we were dating even when we weren’t really helped me.”
“Oh, no,” she shook her head. “I suppose you’re right. Though I wasn’t welcome lovingly. It was more just of an acknowledgement.”
*******
“It’s not the same,” Harry said, slowly opening his eyes and looking up at Draco, “We have to be enemies in classes and everywhere else…” Draco sighed but didn’t say anything - because he knew Harry was right.
, per se. Just… you know, your families aren’t exactly the best of friends-”
“Doing anything with you is memorable, Draco,” he said before he could stop himself. It was the first time that day he had said his name. “I… I better go, then…”
“Like this?” Harry adjusted himself on Draco’s lap, turning to kiss him.
Wow... this chapter lmao
“No. Father,” he whispered. “I felt free for once. I knew what I wanted to do. But he ruined all of it. I’m not happy. I’m alive, but I feel so dead. Without him, everything is meaningless. He made even the smallest things so much better.”
“I win,” Draco smiled, but it faded after a few moments. “Are you okay, though, Harry? Do you think these lessons with Dumbledore are really necessary? It seems like it’s only stressing you out.”
guys I'm sorry I feel like this chapter is awful but I wanted a chapter to be out :((
In the Gryffindor Common Room, Hermione studied Harry’s blank expression as he sat in front of the fireplace. “Mione, I’m deaf, not blind. Why are you staring at me?”
He hung his head low in shame. “It’s difficult. But it’s nothing I can’t handle. This summer was the worst, if I’m being honest. Even though… I basically went with everything my father told me to, he was still so angry with me. I feel as if he wishes I was a better son. But his version of a better son is someone who would abide by everything he has to say, and probably worship the Dark Lord as much as he does.”
“What? So you mean that he just won’t be able to come this year?” Harry said, frowning.
He paused and the two stared at him, expectantly waiting for an answer. Hermione’s gaze, as usual, was somewhat judgemental.
with him.”
“I’m going to regret asking, but...” Pansy said as she sat down beside Draco in the Slytherin Common Room, “why are you reading that book if you don’t believe he’s deaf? And where did you get it?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry scoffed, folding the note and putting it on his bedside table, unsure of what to say. “You know, yesterday… I wasn’t studying. I, uh… I was on a date with someone.”
So, he started reading.
“Why would someone go abroad suddenly?” he asked, face flushed. “I just… I wished he would send me a letter to say goodbye. Maybe… even talked to me one last time. I… I wanted a goodbye. End whatever our relationship was on a proper note. I know that’s stupid, since that… it was me who hurt us, both of us…”
Thankfully, the two had given each other ‘love bites’ in secluded places, which could be easily hidden by the collars of their shirts.
“Okay, but… that doesn’t erase anything from our past mistakes.”
Draco pulled him into a tight hug.
“No, I got it. Your parents might wonder where the money went anyway, and-”
The nervousness was starting to affect Draco, so he cupped Harry’s face gently. “I’m really sorry. But I think you need to be prepared for this, okay?” he said in a quiet voice, gently pressing his lips against Harry’s cheek, who nodded, then moved to the table to take off his hearing aids.
Eyebrows creased, he gulped. “No,” he answered. “I mean… they’ve been trying to convince me, but… I’m not really…”
She opened her mouth to speak, then nudged him when she saw Harry, Ron and Hermione entering. Draco turned - the Gryffindor table was just behind him. “There they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if they got held up by something. If those three are missing, something’s always bound to go wrong.”
“I just… it’s different around my house. At Malfoy Manor, everything’s lonely. Most of the time it’s just three people in their own parts of the manor. I’ve had my own wing ever since I was old enough to find my way around. Ever since then, I was distanced. Well, it wasn’t as if we were exactly all close.
“I know,” he replied from underneath the blankets. “I hate him so much, Mother.”
He looked around, eventually walking deeper into the room. After a few minutes, he eventually found a blond head in the dark, only one candle on the table beside him.
“I thought of maybe buying you your own. But I thought it’d make you feel comfortable if you were wearing something that was mine,” Draco mumbled, turning slightly pink. “I have like ten pairs left anyway… and that’s only here. Back home I think I have around thirty.”
The blond looked at him, raising an eyebrow. “Is there-”
Harry didn’t say anything, staring down at the piece of paper, eyes glistening too.
“Oh, well, you just ran out on me this afternoon, and you didn’t show up for dinner, and I didn’t find you in the Marauder’s Map, and-”
“I saw you that night,” he responded as they continued to move to the music. “You were moping and sitting in one place. You seemed quite angry, so I didn’t feel like coming and insulting you. Besides, Moody would have probably turned me into a ferret again.”
, exactly?” he folded his arms. “If they ask, I’ll just tell them you’re being a bitch.”
Draco scoffed. “Godfather? My own father doesn’t have the right to look through my mind.” Draco hissed.
Who was he fucking kidding? He loved Harry. He wanted to hold Harry, or he wanted Harry to hold him. He wanted to kiss Harry until his lips ached, love him until there was no love left - but there’s always love left. Always for Harry.
Perhaps it was because their scar/mark was hurting, or maybe it was because the memories were hitting both of them at the same time. Whatever it was, they both were suddenly getting riled up.
Harry tried not to smile, staring down at the three cards he had left, lips twitching in amusement. “And I…” he sighed, setting down a plus four card, “am not sorry either.
“On a date with Lavender, to break up with her,” Hermione said with an eye roll, to which Harry raised an eyebrow at. Hermione opened her book again. “Yes, I know. Absolutely rude and harsh. I told him that but he said I was being unreasonable and walked off. Anyways, what’s up?”
“I... I don’t know. There are a lot of factors to think about.”
“Mad? No,” he said, stroking Draco’s hair, who shut his eyes. Crying had tired him out again. “I wouldn’t have wanted to say it if I was in your place. I understand. Thank you for telling me now.”
“And if I ask you to stay?”
He looked up from his book, raising an eyebrow, gazing at her amusedly, fiddling with the ring on his finger. “Alright, give me some, then.”
And shit, it hurt so much.
“Shh! He’s here!” he pushed Pansy out of his way, quickly making his way near the Great Lake. “Potter! Oh, right,” he muttered, turning to walk over to him, but it seemed Harry was already charging towards him.
Draco looked up at Harry. Of course. How could Draco fucking forget? He wanted to smash his own head against the wall. “Harry, I-”
By the looks of it, Draco was really taking all of this seriously. He was pretending that Harry didn’t even exist, which hurt more than he thought it would. His words would randomly come into his head: ‘worth the risk’. Was Draco worth the risk? More importantly, why did Draco think that Harry wasn’t worth the risk?
Leaning his head against the window, Harry looked out at the view from his dorm in the Gryffindor Tower, his face expressionless. He thought back to when him and Draco used to be enemies. Maybe things were simpler then, for both of them.
“Please shut up,” he said, quickly leaving the room. She exchanged glances with Astoria, who shrugged, frowning. He had been like this the past few months or so - easily irritable, almost fragile. But he hated that word. Fragile.
“I don’t think either of us thought this far ahead, love,” he shook his head. They sat in silence, and Harry took his moment to study Draco. He looked tired, but less pale. He was wearing a black suit and his hair was gelled back.
“You’re right. We have time for that later,” Draco replied, sitting down beside Harry. “But… I’m not sure if our rules make any sense anymore. Are we sticking to them?”
“Sorry, I couldn’t quite get that.”
“Do you?” Draco whispered, pulling Harry onto his lap, a frown on his face. “Even if I may not be the best person?
Say goodbye. Just let him go. Just-
“Because you are-”
Anger rising in his chest, Draco slowly looked up. “What kind of consequences?” He asked in a low, rough voice, feeling like he was fighting back tears, but also an urge to murder the man right before his eyes.
“Well, fuck me,” Draco muttered to himself.
Draco’s eyes burned with fury - no, frustration. “Don’t do that. Don’t. It’s not going to help you or me. So let me tell you what needs to be said.”
“Shut up,” he snapped, but turned around, leaving the kitchen and finding a mirror in the hallway, staring at the glistening white streak in his hair. Ron followed after, both of them staring at his reflection. Harry turned to him quickly. “Quick, make my hair a different color.”
“I agree. Take your time, Harry. And I understand that you might not be able to come to a decision even on his wedding day.”
Draco picked up the board game carefully and placed it on the floor, gently pushing Harry off of him and turning him around so they were sitting right in front of each other.
“Harry, they’d have to pry my dead hands off of you,” he answered, hoping that’s what Harry wanted to hear. To his surprise, the Gryffindor looked up at him and grinned. “Now, onto more positive things, alright?"
Draco glanced over to his watch. It was around six - Hogwarts Express had probably reached by now. How would Draco even get there? The only option would be to Apparate in Hogsmeade and from there, he would walk to Hogwarts.
She rubbed her hand gently up and down his back. “You should experiment, you know. Go out with boys. See how it feels.”
“Are you going to come in?” The Fat Lady asked in a slightly annoyed tone.
“Ex-crush?” Hermione raised an eyebrow. “Weren’t you just gaping at her in the previous lesson?”
“Aw, you really didn’t have to-”
“Hm?” He looked back at Pansy who placed a hand on his arm. “You never told us what happened on that date.”
Short as well, I know, but in my opinion, it's just the right amount and way to end their 6th year at Hogwarts.
He turned when he noticed a faint tapping on the window, only to see an owl waiting just outside. Quickly walking up to the window, he surveyed the area outside before opening it to let the owl in.
“Yes, I think so.”
He wondered where Draco went. He decided to go to the lake, maybe Draco was there?
Startled, Harry watched as he stood up, walking towards the door. He paused at the doorknob, hand trembling as the Gryffindor spoke up. “I can’t not worry,” he was saying, his voice shaky. He was unsure of how loud he was being. “I thought you said we were friends.”
“It’s ten thousand Galleons. I don’t know about you, but I don’t have that kind of money,” Harry sighed, setting down the paper. When he looked back up at her, she had a look on her face. “I know what you’re going to say. I’m not going to ask him!”
Harry slowly made his way down the hallway before dinner. He hadn’t seen Draco since their meeting in the Potions closet many hours ago, and now he wanted to see him again.
“I’m in need of a wand,” Harry whispered, staring down at Draco who had three wands in his hands: Hermione’s, Ron’s, and his. Draco quickly and carefully pushed Harry off of him, making it seem like the way he pushed him off was brutal. Draco handed over the three wands in his hands.
“I’m not worried,” Harry lied. Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed.
“Hm? Oh, no. I think we should be on good terms with them,” Draco replied, smiling at her. “They did invite us for Christmas dinner, after all.”
idiot.”
Honestly, I got a block after the last chapter! And I've been super busy with schoolwork these past few months. I still can't promise a consistent schedule whatsoever due to school. But I'll try my best!
Draco folded his arms, his expression darkening. He had forgotten about the bad things for a moment. “There are still responsibilities waiting for me, Pansy. I just didn’t want to be in a situation where I would hurt him again."
“You know, Draco, I really don’t think you should be going to Hogwarts for your eighth year,” said Lucius, taking a small step towards his son. Draco slowly took a step back, shaking his head.
“I think it’s cute,” said a dreamy voice from behind them. Luna Lovegood was smiling at Harry and Draco who seemed to still be insulting each other’s hair. “Besides, you don't need to worry. No one even pays attention to what they have to say to each other anymore. If they do, I think there’d be a problem. I mean, look at them.”
“Perhaps for the best,” he replied. He looked up at the Slytherin table, searching a little then eventually finding Draco, who was messing around with Pansy. After a moment, he looked up, and as their eyes met, Harry felt the need to quickly look away.
The image of Harry’s teary eyes came into his mind, and he felt regret flood through his chest. It bit at him, almost like a stabbing pain. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt Harry again, and that was exactly what he did. He almost wanted to go to Harry and tell him that they could be together, but he knew he couldn’t. It was too risky for both of them.
“What if I was like…” Harry took in a deep breath, then whined out, “
“Draco, we need you,” said Narcissa as she entered Draco’s room in a rush.
Pansy, who had been watching, slowly walked to Harry, gently taking his arm and squeezing it. “Leave him be for a while, okay? I’m sure he’s just upset. It’ll be okay,” Pansy said gently. “It’s better if you both just get some space…”
Harry licked his dry lips, his eyes faraway. “A dream,” he answered, then shook his head. “A nightmare.”
“What is that?” Ron asked, trying to take it from Harry’s hands, who slapped them away. “Hey!”
That night, Harry got a letter from Dumbledore, saying that he wanted to meet him in his office. He went at once. Anything to distract his mind. Anything to make him stop the pure heartbreak he was feeling, even if it was just for a while.
i love and hate this at the same time
It finally occurred to Draco that Harry was wiping away the lipstick marks. Their gaze remained on each other as Harry continued doing this.
“Yesterday, I guess.”
“Yeah, well… this is my first day off in a while. I do close my shop for holidays and stuff, but… I don’t really go out for anything other than grocery shopping or seeing my friends.”
Everyone in the Eighth Year knew about Draco and Harry - well, to a certain extent. The only people who knew that they were dating were Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Pansy. The rest all just thought that Malfoy and Potter finally put their differences aside and decided to be friends.
“Just… you look great,” Harry managed to say. Draco blinked before biting his lip, his pale cheeks turning a light shade of pink. Harry’s cheek went slightly pink too.
It was as if they had never crossed paths. The hallways were much quieter. The communication between the Gryffindor table and the Slytherin table in the Great Hall had come down immensely.
Then one Friday, sometime in March, Harry and Draco were cuddled up in Draco’s dorm while everyone was busy eating dinner. The two were silent - but for very different reasons. Harry was busily reading and Draco - well, he was just staring at his Dark Mark.
“I am. I just need to be able to sit in front of him and explain everything that happened.”
The rest of the week went by painfully slow, and Draco had not realized until now how many classes he and Harry actually had in common. It was strange to go back to not talking daily. He found himself thinking of things to write in a poem for Harry, only to remember poems weren’t necessary anymore.
Harry put his hand out for Draco to shake, who pushed it away and kissed him instead, and the ache in Harry’s chest had faded slightly. Knowing that Draco was his again; that Draco would be on his side. And to see him smile against Harry’s lips when he pulled away ever so slightly.
He looked down, frowning. “Harry, I told you, I don’t want to be in a position where-”
“But the agreement-”
“I accepted him when he couldn’t accept himself,” Harry started, then shook his head. “Why are you here? I don’t need you to get me a tub of ice cream or something. He’s moved on, and I’m… getting there.”
Harry looked down at the blank piece of paper he was going to use to write back to Draco. “I don’t know, guys. I don’t even know what happened. One minute I could hear, then… I came back through the Portkey and it was gone.”
“Right, that’s why you and Pansy don’t meddle in our relationship at all,” he stated sarcastically, nodding. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “So you’re telling me Draco is my...
Dumbledore’s eyes glinted knowingly. “I’m not quite sure if that concerns you.”
“What do you mean ‘you didn’t mean it like that’? There is only one way you could have meant it. And oh, I’m sorry, it
“So you two are keeping it a secret?”
“Isn’t Malfoy the one who took the fall? I thought you landed right on top of him.” Ron piped in.
“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”
“What? I’m hwungwy.” Draco said through a mouthful. Pansy was so disgusted that she didn’t even bother to roll her eyes. She just focused on her own food.
(See the end of the chapter for
.” He shivered dramatically.
“I’m sorry. It sounds like there’s a lot more to that,” he answered, squeezing Draco’s thigh. “But…”
Pansy practically barged into Draco’s dorm on Monday morning.
Harry looked at Hermione, who quickly signed everything Snape had said. “Um… no, Sir, I’m not distracted.”
The ending is a bit rushed, sorry about that.
“Snape found out,” Draco finally said, running a hand through his hair. “And he wants me to break up with you. He said that The Dark Lord will find out by reading your mind. But you had Occlumency lessons, didn’t you? Can’t you block him out?”
“Everything’s spectacular,” Harry said when he paused from drinking to catch his breath, before taking another gulp. Hermione raised an eyebrow but decided to leave Harry to it, joining Pansy and Luna to converse with them. Draco and Harry had been able to hide that they were arguing surprisingly well. Pansy and Hermione did notice that when they walked past each other in the hallway, they just disregarded each other’s presence rather than saying anything snarky or shooting an insult. They decided it was probably better not to pry, and just assume that they weren’t in the mood to fake-argue in front of everyone.
“Harry, please stop making things harder for me-”
Then he swiped and saw a video from Harry.
The wedding was icy, dreadful, despite everyone smiling as he walked down the aisle. He stood beside Pansy, who smiled at him sadly. The anxiousness he had been feeling all day was too much to handle. His stomach was queasy and he felt like he was going to be sick at any moment.
? His father’s enemy?
Pansy laughed. “Yes. Now, here.” She handed Draco a simple sweater and black pants. “Keep it casual. After all, he probably doesn’t care what you look like.”
“Oh just open it!” Molly said excitedly.
“Trust me, I’m not,” He rolled his eyes and picked up his bag, heading for the door.
“Draco, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I really am. I didn’t know what the spell did, I-”
ask Pansy and Luna to come too, right?”
“It’s okay. You don’t necessarily need to say goodbye right this second. You still have time,” Narcissa told him, picking up the piece of paper that had been torn by how hard Draco had scribbled on it. “How about we go out for lunch, hm?”
Another meeting. Another letter.
“How lovely of you to have me, Sir,” Harry replied, trying his best to sound genuine. Draco mentally cringed.
In the coming weeks, the first few lessons went this way. They’d do a few minutes of physical signing, then Harry would give him a new phrase to learn, or a new topic of words to learn. They would usually sit in silence then, until Harry decided he needed to leave. Draco would stay for an hour or more, trying to study WSL on his own.
“What are you doing? Are you talking to that Siri person?” came Draco’s muffled voice from behind the camera.
“Yeah. Draco said that Mum was nice to him and accepted him when he couldn’t even accept himself.”
He was gone.
“So, Mr. Malfoy, what exactly are your intentions with Harry?” Arthur said after about five minutes of silence. Hermione and Harry exchanged glances, and an awkward, red-faced Draco wished he could literally be in Azkaban than having this conversation. George and Charlie tried not to laugh.
She smirked as she looked past him. He followed her gaze. Mouth open, Draco frowned, his name spilling out of his mouth-
“You should see how panicked you get sometimes,” he laughed. “You don’t need to worry so much. I really don’t think we’re friends or something.”
“Care to lead, then, abled-hearing person?” he asked, and this time, Draco laughed out loud as he switched the placement of their arms so he was now leading. This seemed more comfortable for the two, even though Harry had originally learnt how to lead. It was surprising to him how gracefully Draco moved, as if it came to him naturally. He was even smiling now, letting himself get lost in the dance. Even the arms around Harry’s waist felt in place and not uncomfortable.
Harry’s eyes widened when he realized who it was.
“Here, have a sausage,” Draco cut a sausage into a smaller piece and held it to Harry’s mouth. “Normally I’d find the Three Broomsticks a bit low for my standards, but… I’m not going to lie, this is pretty good.”
“I was going to apologize. Ask you if there was any chance you could take me back, any chance at all.”
Narcissa looked at him with a small smile on her face. “So I was right? He
“Well, since you’ve been wishing for it since first year…” Harry started, then let out a laugh when Draco smacked him on the shoulder. “I don’t know why, but… it feels easier to be around you than most people lately. So, yeah, I’d say we’re friends.”
No, Draco was fine. He had to be.
Or maybe, after how Harry had ruined things, Draco didn’t want anything to do with him.
“Oh,” Draco said, slowly opening his eyes and sitting up.
“You can’t expect trust to build so easily, not with us,” Harry shook his head.
“Looking for a way for you to get out of here,” muttered Draco as he looked around, a confused, searching look on his face.
“I don’t think it’s best if you go.”
“Mistletoe,” she pointed towards the ceiling. The two looked up, and surely enough, there was a mistletoe. And before he knew it, her wet lips were on him, and all he could do was stand there in awe. And while he kissed her back, he couldn’t help but realize how wrong it felt.
*********
“Mr. Potter, please stand up. Ten points from Gryffindor for making such a ruckus.”
Draco stared at him in surprise. “Oh, um, well I’m an Auror now. It’s kind of boring, actually.”
“I just…” Draco paused. “Oh Merlin, stop looking at me like that. Okay, I can’t do it.”
“To call it deceit is a tad bit dramatic-”
Sneakily, they managed to make their way to the cliff, where Harry felt instantly more at ease. The sun was - very slowly - starting to set by now. The view was incredible like always.
“Bit dark, baby,” Draco kissed him on the cheek. “I’d break your glasses.”
“Why do you always wake up so early?” Harry shot back, and Draco just rolled his eyes again, sitting down at the bed. “You don’t have to wait for me. I might take too long.”
As it turned out, Draco used his charms to somehow convince Harry to come to Christmas dinner on the 26th, the Second Day of Christmas. But first, they had to go through a Christmas dinner with the Weasleys.

“You… you…” Harry cut him off. He was refusing to believe it. “No, no, it can’t be. Tell me you’re joking. Tell me this is a big, cruel joke.”
“Merlin,” He breathed. “I have feelings for him! I have feeling for Harry James Potter, I… I…”
“Don’t call it a second date. Just ask to hang out today evening.” Pansy said. “That makes it easier.”
He was pretending it was Draco Malfoy he was kissing.
“If I’m a kid to you, that makes you a pedophile.”
Draco’s face was pink by now. He gripped his cup tightly, unsure why his chest felt so tight. The underlying hope that Harry would enjoy his poems were there, yet to hear him say it was something else entirely. “...forget it,” he replied, shaking his head. “Has the chamomile tea been helping you?”
He shrugged, unsure of what Draco could even do. The worst had already happened to him. It would be hard to top.
He massaged his temples. “I’m still not quite sure. What would happen if your parents found Harry here? And what if they question why I’m here so often?”
“That’s ridiculous,” he yanked the book out of her hands, dusting it carefully as if she had made it dirty, holding it close to his chest. A devious smile on his lips, he chuckled to himself. “I’m learning it just so I can make fun of him.”
” Draco Malfoy shouted at Dumbledore, and his wand flew out of his hands. Harry wanted to pull off his Cloak and talk to Draco, but he realized that he was bound. He turned and realized that Dumbledore was the one who had immobilized him.
“Mr. Potter,” Snape said suddenly, causing Harry and a few others to jump. The class had been silent for a while and Snape had just broken it, a few people were bound to find it sudden. “Please stand up.”
“For what, being nice?” Harry asked with a scoff.
“It hurts, it hurts!” He managed to say before he was hit with even harsher pain this time. Harry turned to see Draco’s Dark Mark. His whole hand was completely red and Harry could feel the sweat in Draco’s hand.
Harry didn’t know it was possible to be so attracted to someone.
Draco found himself looking over at Harry every few seconds, however, he was just staring at his drink and murmuring quietly to Ron. Did it really have to be this hard to even be in the same room as him? The regret of the past two years had been looming over him for a while, but in this moment, all he wanted was to apologize and take Harry in his arms, but he knew he couldn’t do that. It’d be outrageous, putting aside the fact that the curse placed on them would hurt him.
Harry choked on his spit, looking up at the two who nodded in unison. “Seriously?”
“Drink? What drink?” Draco asked, his eyes widening. “Slughorn had it?”
“Oh, look, he’s signing. Draco, don’t you think we should mess with him again? I feel like that prat deserves it,” he said smugly, taking a sip from his drink.
“...right,” he nodded, trying not to seem caught off guard. So Harry really hadn’t told anyone about the two of them. This was surprising mainly because from Draco’s understanding, Harry was really close with Ron and Hermione.
Draco and Harry had managed to avoid each other - which was actually quite hard. There was quite a less amount of Eighth Years, which made it harder for the two. After the war, everyone put their differences aside, and usually, they all hung out together.
“That really is sadder than what I did.”
“Are you okay with both of you being unhappy for the rest of your lives?”
“Yes,” Harry said. He quickly said the password and walked through. So did Draco and Pansy, under the Cloak (that they had taken from Hermione, which Hermione had taken from Harry without his knowledge).
“Harry, that makes no sense.”
“You and-” Ron started.
She looked at him, then nodded, taking his hands and holding them tightly for a moment. “...I suppose you’re right. Let’s talk about something else.”
“Hey, Draco,” he smiled at the camera. “See? This is a
“About Malfoy. You knew he was a Death Eater, and what he was set to do.”
He stared at the white streak in his hair before slowly turning to his bed, fixing it up before he could lie down on it.
he knew. He was more worried about what was happening. “I just knew,” was all he said. “What’s wrong? Is he okay? Have you heard from him?”
“It’s barely been a day, Pansy. I don’t want to seem clingy,” he stated as if what he was saying was so obvious. “I don’t want to rush anything, either. It’d be quite embarrassing, wouldn’t it?”
“I love you too,” Harry whispered back. He had no idea who it was, nor whether or not he was dreaming or not. But his mind held a long-lasting hope that it was a certain boy with white hair and silver eyes.
Narcissa smiled at her son, before slowly shutting the door and leaving him to his thoughts.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, biting his lip.
“My mother won’t hate you! Er… well, my father on the other hand-”
So here Harry was, on a mid-September night, listening to Draco’s voice reading out a story. His head was pressed up against Draco’s chest, so he could feel his voice too; soft and deep and soothing. It was a beautiful way to fall asleep.
“For the love of God, what?” Draco finally responded, looking up from his book, an annoyed expression on his face as he looked over to Harry, who was pouting as he stared at Draco, his arms folded. “What?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.
Draco felt like being playful. “Potter, you have no friends!”
Tears were rushing down Harry’s face, the gut-wrenching pain of guilt hitting him, as the boy beside him continued to shake uncontrollably.
as you know, I haven't updated in soooo long because I lost interest.
“Always.”
“Do you forgive me for that?”
“No!” she exclaimed, startling him. “Certainly not. That would just make it more difficult for both parties involved. You don’t want to keep going back and forth.”
“We’ve been together for two months!”
They walked around the whole castle, but Luna’s shoes were nowhere to be found. They eventually went outside, to the lake where there was a tree beside it.
“H...how do you know there’s someone on my mind?” asked Draco, slowly sitting up.
“Don’t be ridiculous. I don’t have any bricks with me to throw.” Pansy said matter-of-factly.
“Yeah yeah, good morning,” Harry mumbled, walking over to the bedside table to grab his glasses and fix his hair.
With some hesitation, Draco spoke. “He was saying these stupid things about you. Things I was saying at the start of this year. And hearing it from him made me realize the stupidity of my words. Anyway, I told him to cut it out, and he started telling me how you’re my boyfriend because I’m trying to ‘protect’ you.”
“That hickey on your neck says otherwise,” Pansy sang. Draco quickly put a hand to his neck - of course, his pajamas didn’t hide his neck, as well as his shirts, did. Harry put a hand to his neck as well, feeling so awkward that he was smiling.
“Harry’s staring at you,” Pansy told Draco.
“No?” Harry said, confused. Was he supposed to know where Draco was? “Why, do you know where he is?”
“If you really have to…” Draco whispered, leaning forward and placing his head on Harry’s chest, trying to hide the fact that there were tears streaming down his face. Harry, of course, knew that he was crying. But he simply wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him onto his lip and rocking him gently.
Spoiler alert: he
“This is the easiest sentence. And the most important,” he rolled his eyes. Draco watched as he signed while speaking, amazed. He had only. “‘My name is Draco’. You need to finger spell your name. Look at me again.”
Harry could feel his heart pounding and Draco’s face was flushed.
“I will do what I like, thank you very much,” he said, then sighed when she glared at him. “I don’t want to talk to you right now. You’ve kept this from me for… I don’t know, five years?”
Draco slowly fell to his knees, absolutely astonished, his eyes prickling with tears that threatened to fall down any second. He couldn’t register it. Nausea filled Draco’s stomach. His heart was struggling to keep a steady beat, and his chest felt like a wolf was eating at it, ripping out his skin, his heart, leaving him with nothing.
He presumed it was Ron who helped him upstairs and into one of the guest rooms. About five or ten minutes later, his scar had stopped seething and he was finally regaining his senses. “Are you okay?” he asked, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I can get you some more water.”
bloody stupid,” Harry said with an eye roll. They slowly entered the Hall. Harry made eye contact with Draco and quickly looked away, starting to smile.
Despite all they had been through, they were still just awkward gays in love with each other. Green eyes stared into silver ones.
“Yeah, and we could gotten the pet dog you always wanted.”
“...doesn’t matter who I was staring at,” he corrected himself before they could notice. “I don’t like her anymore. Not sure if I ever liked her, actually…”
“I just don’t want him to use Draco.”
“What happened?” She asked immediately as Snape left the classroom to get something.
Stroking his thumb over the phone, he quickly turned it off and placed it underneath his clothes again, shutting the closet door, quickly picking up a piece of paper. Harry hadn’t shown up to the Weasley Christmas dinner last year (he didn’t go either, but got a letter from Molly saying it was a shame the two couldn’t make it).
Harry tore open the envelope, seeing his name on the decorative piece of paper. “Draco and Harry’s…” he looked up to see Draco down on one knee, far away from him, eyes glistening. “Draco…”
you to shut-”
Harry nodded. “Rule six: you need to stop putting gel in your hair.”
Draco had his back to Harry, but he was tall, so whoever was in front of him, was being covered by him. All Harry saw was a slim hand running through Draco’s hair, their long, pointy fingernails brushing through as if it was a comb.
“Fine isn’t acceptable for me,” Draco replied, “not when it’s an obvious lie.”
“Don’t,” Harry bursted, frowning, stepping closer to him carefully, too panicked to even try and understand what he was saying. “Draco, don’t. Please.”
“What are you writing?” Pansy asked once he was done, setting it to the side.
“That’s okay, love.”
Harry nodded. He was happy to see that Draco looked less pale now that they had eaten.
“What about the Potter kid?” Lucius asked as he entered. Draco and Narcissa turned, and the atmosphere had immediately turned sour. “Off you go, then, Draco. Your mother and I have… some matters to discuss.”
“I’ll go with idiotic.”
I love this line so much ahaha
“You didn’t let me explain, nor did you treat me properly.”
!” Pansy raised her voice, pushing Blaise off of Draco. “What the hell is wrong with you two?”
“He’s too soft to do that, but yes, we’ll be pretty mad.” Harry told her. Pansy smirked, watching them leaving the Slytherin Common Room.
“You heard it in his voice, didn’t you?”
“Hey, guys, what are your plans for Christmas?” asked Ron as he sat down on the sofa in the Common Room, beside Draco and Harry who were holding hands under the blanket that was over both of them. “The holidays start in a few days.”
Draco chewed on his lip, then nodded. "Okay."
“Harry, you alright?” Hermione asked, but her voice seemed almost distant. He put a hand to his forehead, nodding slowly.
December was rapidly approaching - the first three months of Hogwarts had been fun. Sneaking around, pretending to be enemies, studying together, making out in broom closets. It was like sixth year all over again, minus the secrets.
“And… there’s no one for miles,” he replied, tracing his index finger up Harry’s chest and wiggling his eyebrows rather suggestively. Harry let out a laugh in response. His face was a deep shade of red.
“Sure, this is a color-changing spell, you won’t need it,” Blaise shrugged. “But it’d be rather embarrassing to fight the Dark Lord - since he’s supposedly back - when you can’t even pronounce your spells properly. Maybe you ought to just take your defe-”
Draco was perched on the side of the armchair, his hair disheveled, a few buttons of his shirt unbuttoned. Checking his watch, he raised an eyebrow, concerned. Harry was very, very late. He had tried reading a book and doing his homework, but nothing was keeping him busy.
“Except you are,” he cut her off. “You knew how hard this would be for me, and you intentionally tried to make it worse.”
“Just to ask how they’re doing and if they’d like to be invited to dinner.”
“I need to get back to work, I’ll see you later.”
“Such as?” Draco asked, an eyebrow raised as Harry slowly sat down on his lap, facing him. Harry’s green eyes sparkled with an emotion that Draco couldn’t identify - but he sure as hell could feel it. “You’re seriously-”
Harry, excited, practically grabbed it from his hands and tore it open, revealing a small box, his eyes widening as he looked up at Draco. There were two, shiny gold rings inside.
Pansy kept her eyes on him, as if she didn’t know what to say.
He shook his head, and they both turned to the loud whistling kettle. Harry quickly ran to turn it off, then turned back to face him.
“Oh, shut up, Malfoy.” Harry snapped at him, but the Slytherin and Gryffindor shared a look in their eyes that knew they didn’t mean what they were saying at all.
“Sorry, shouldn’t have joked about that,” Harry said, immediately sensing how he had stepped over a line, looking down at his feet awkwardly.
“I can’t help but think it’s both of them,” he said, grabbing his notebook. “Right, I’ll get to it, then. Stupid wit-sharpening potion.”
“Okay, two pets. But that’s the limit. And you better not be buying random things for the apartment. It’s honestly hoarding at this point!”
“I’m not hurting anyone by doing it my way,” Harry responded, his voice hoarse.
Glancing up, Harry frowned. “I’m okay. I think. I don’t know. I suppose my feelings are really not taken into consideration anymore,” he shrugged.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks for visiting!” Harry beamed at a few customers, turning back to restock the shelves. He had dyed his streak brown again. It had been three weeks since his encounter with Draco, and day by day, he was pushing it further away from his conscious mind.
“Better get your eyes checked out,” Harry said, but he was trying to fight back a smile. “I need help with a few potions, but I think I need to master these spells first.”
Narcissa walked over to take Ron and Harry down.
He broke eye contact immediately. Gulping, he tried to keep his smile as Molly Weasley got up from her seat, greeting him with a hug, followed by Ginny.
“Ron, I’m not even an adult yet. How could I possibly be going grey?” Harry asked, astonished by Ron’s logic.
Harry, panting, let out a loose laugh, leaning up so their lips were brushing as he spoke. “Do you really want to discuss your hair right now?”
“Yeah, we should’ve. I’m just glad I got to see you. This summer has been so… awful,” Draco was saying. Somewhere in between a half-asleep conversation with Draco, Harry fell asleep.
“Like what?”
“Draco, if you don’t want to talk about it, it’s okay. We can skip past that bit.” Harry said softly, taking Draco’s hand and holding onto it tightly.
It was like fireworks. Harry felt Draco put his arms around his waist. This time, when their lips met, it was as if they were greeting each other again, the kisses being soft but quickly turning to rough, with deep lust and a need for more.
“Alright, alright! Sorry.”
“No, no. I was just a bit worried, in case I hurt you in some way. But you’re okay, right? Not too tiring?”
Dinner was a bit weird for everyone. Draco and Harry sat down beside each other - Draco really did not want to sit next to anyone else, he still felt super awkward.
“It’s to make sure Harry understands them,” he replied, and all Pansy did was smile at him, as if she knew something about himself that he didn’t. “Don’t look at me like that. It’s frightening.”
“Thanks, love.”
“But no one saw me.” Harry said with a grin, receiving a smack on the shoulder from Draco. “Ouch! Besides, I
“Just some secret admirers,” Harry said smoothly, taking the paper from the owl and smiling as he quickly left the Great Hall. He had taken a liking to Draco’s owl, who seemed to be much nicer than his owner.
“So? You hate me?”
“We made the deal for the best,” Draco stroked Harry’s cheek with his index finger absentmindedly. “So that we don’t die. Or rip each other’s throats apart.”
malfoypolix <3
“It was just a headache,” Harry shrugged, playing with his hands, looking away.
********
“Not if I owl you first,” Draco said, then went inside the house to bid everyone goodbye.
“Mr. Potter, please leave unless you are in need of something.”
Look out for the next chapter.
They slowly walked inside. Inside, there was a couch, a small coffee table and on the other side, there was a slightly bigger table with all kinds of stuff. There were also fairy lights inside.
“I don’t, but since it was my fault he fell, I had the decency to make sure he was okay. Are we done with this interrogation now?”
“I mean…” Pansy spoke up, fiddling with the things on Umbridge’s desk, “Draco, you come from a family full of Death Eaters, and there’s been five years’ worth of rivalry and distrust between you two. I don’t blame him. On the other hand…” she looked up, startled to see everyone staring at her. “Did I overstep?”
“What now, Malfoy? Got another bet with your father going on that you need to tell me about?” Harry said, his green eyes sparkling as he stared at Draco. “Oh, and your hair looks awful today!”
“Yes, Professor,” the two grumbled.
“This isn’t about you, Draco,” Harry fumed, “it’s bigger than you. It’s bigger than me, even. If I trust the wrong person, the entire Wizarding World could be in danger. What part of this is so hard for you to understand?”
Dodger seemed like he wasn’t paying attention. More so, he was ignoring Draco. Both Dodger and Draco’s eyes moved to the window, that was wide open. Narcissa must have left it open for the owl to go out of.
If none of you are still here (which isn't surprising, you probably aren't), I might continue this story later on, when I have more time.
“I-I know I shouldn’t be. Really…” Harry protested. “I just… I was just thinking of the look in Draco’s eyes the night that Dumbledore died.”
“I know, but…”
“Up here,” he shouted, running a hand down his bare chest, quickly putting on a sweater.
“No. And don’t speak a word about it to Harry. He doesn’t know that I’ve actually gotten a task I need to finish.” Draco told her. Then he noticed the worry on Pansy’s face. “I’m fine, really. It’s not that big of a task.” But it was.
Harry decided it was best for him to gather some proof before telling Hermione and Ron about it further because they obviously they didn’t believe him during the feast when he went on about how Malfoy is annoying. Harry drifted off into a deep sleep.
“I’d get rid of all of your hair gel,” Harry planted a gentle kiss on his forehead.
“Where’s Draco?”
Harry tried putting his hand over where Draco was bleeding, to get it to stop, but he couldn’t. There were too many wounds.
He collapsed into Ron’s arms, letting the tears roll down his face. “I couldn’t… I can’t… make a decision, so… I just… thought it meant I don’t want him.”
“He was keeping you safe,” he said, taking Harry’s hand gently. “And… he knew about my attempts. I figured. I didn’t really try my best to cover my tracks. But… he didn’t stop me whatsoever. A part of me thinks…”
“I still don’t know what to do, Harry.” Ron whined after Harry and Draco stopped glaring at each other.
“Well… you know… he’s not always like that,” Draco mumbled, not noticing Harry’s clenched fists. Draco stared down intently at his textbook, not wanting to face Harry.
“Yeah, okay,” Draco responded, standing up. He smiled at his mother. “Do you think he’ll show up?”
“Calm down, will you? It’s literally our first day back,” Draco said, leaning back as he stared at the table which was a mess, filled with papers, books, quills, ink, etc.
Harry looked over at him, instantly regretting what he had said. “I’m really sorry, Draco. I’m being inconsiderate. This must be really difficult for you, too,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m really sorry.”
“Mother said it’s best if I go,” Draco said in a low voice, staring down at his feet - facing his father was too much for him.
“How are you?”
Harry walked over to the bed where Draco had placed blue silk pajamas. “All you own are silk pajamas, I swear,” Harry muttered as he pulled off his shirt, putting on the clothes before flopping himself down on the bed again, staring up at the ceiling. Draco stayed sitting on the desk, looking over at Harry.
Harry thought to himself,
“And I think we should still be together, but we always can’t get what we want,” Harry snapped, then took a step forward. Draco gulped and stepped further away from him. “Please, Draco,” he whispered. “Why are you doing this to me? I love you.”
“And Harry?” “Yes?” Harry turned eagerly. Draco had now sat up and was staring at him.
He shrinks it and puts it into his pocket, continuing down the cobblestone street to Scrivenshaft’s to buy Percy’s present.
, Potter could at least tell him what happened when they were at Hogwarts together. He’ll want to help, and all Draco has to do is ask... Right?
There’s a tense silence for a long moment, before someone steps forward. Draco’s eyes snap to a blond boy no older than seventeen, his steps crunching in the rubble. He’s wearing a battered and torn hat, face scarred and bloody. There’s steel in his eyes and a stubborn set to his jaw, and Draco’s lips tighten.
Harry puts his face in his hands. “I’m sorry. I think they’ve gotten the wrong idea. What did she say?”
Groggily, Draco swings his legs over his bed and edges forward to reach for the curtains, pulling them back and peeking through. It’s difficult to see around Rue’s cubicle, but one of the healers—maybe Healer Wagner—steps back into view long enough for Draco to see him pull out his wand and cast a spell that puts the patient to sleep.
“Oh,” he says, looking down at his lap. He doesn’t know what to say.
her?”
“Thank you,” Draco says sincerely, and Harry sucks in a breath.
It’s stupid to be jealous, he tells himself. Draco will be fine — he’ll probably enjoy whatever it is Fred and George have planned — and Harry will be just as fine, thank you very much. He has Neville and Blaise for company, at least.
Frowning, expecting more, he turns to the slip of parchment that fell out. It reads:
He turns to Agnes, managing a smile. It’s a bit belated, but he finally signs hello, the movement of his hands coming naturally after practicing it so much.
Draco goes very still, heart freezing. He blinks at the words, rereads them, not wanting to believe what she’s suggesting.
“Wait!” It’s Soto, alarm and desperation and anger clear in that one word. Draco instantly feels on edge. “You can’t just
hasn’t forgotten his name. He has half a mind to duck back out of the store and sleep through the New Year, but that would leave Draco alone, and
“I’m glad to hear that, Draco. I’m sorry to say I have to be going now, but we’ll meet again, alright?” they say sincerely.
“Pardon?” he asks, voice quivering. Not
He can easily make out his few dreamless sleep vials and the Marauder’s Map, the colours stark against the dark wood. The map, especially, has been quite handy as a professor, particularly when Teddy was still a student and in his trouble-making phase. Harry pushes aside the bittersweet reminder that he’s no longer Teddy’s professor, and continues to search for his glasses in the other drawers, and around the floor.
“Blaise,” he greets, inclining his head. “How’ve you been? How’s the gin?”
An idea pulls at him. He probably can’t do it, but… maybe he’ll get lucky. He glances at the clock. It’s four in the morning, and Wagner’s shift ends in slightly less than four hours.
Draco lets out a small breath. Things will be much easier if he can exit the ward whenever he pleases.
He’s real — so is Draco. Draco’s lips travel down his neck, and Harry’s back arches.
“Whatcha doing?” she asks, and Draco, lost in thought, startles and drops a few newspapers.
—Healer Potter, you can’t do this,” Soto splutters, and Draco’s stomach knots.
Moments later, a storefront emerges from the fog, a cobblestone road forming their feet, the world bursting with color. Draco gapes. Again, all he can think is
Narcissa’s eyes narrow immediately. “Did you agree to it?”
uncomfortable, but he doesn’t even think that she can actually understand what’s going on. In all the time he watched her, she hasn’t spoken a word, and she’s unresponsive to the healers when they talk to her.
“The next batch of Weasley children are at Hogwarts, of course we went through the Skele-Gro,” Neville says with a snort, making Harry and Draco laugh.
warm. It spreads from the center of his chest, to his fingertips, to his toes. It makes him feel safe, in a way.
“Have you ever seen the scars on my chest?” he murmurs. “I don’t know how I got them.”
He approaches a set of double doors. This is it, he knows. He’s arrived
“I don’t know what I did to make you think this, or what ‘escapades’ you’re referring to, but thank you for letting me know how you feel. I hope Gilderoy and Basil are good company. I’ll leave you to it, then,” he says, words clipped, and immediately exits Agnes’s cubicle.
Just then, the wards go off. A high, pleasant chiming. There’s someone at the front door, asking for permission to enter, and relief washes over Draco.
Instead, he found everything he isn’t: a Draco who used words like
He really hasn’t had enough to drink to process this.
Harry finds a chair after that, and takes to people watching. Rosmerta appears every once in a while, giving him pointed glances. A few couples get a little too handsy — George usually handles them. Surprisingly, only a few people take any great, drunken risks. He wonders if it’s a bad thing that he’s disappointed.
from the flaming hat—and everything happens so quickly and at the same time that Draco almost doesn’t see Potter roll from the giant man’s arms.
Frustrated, he snaps the fitted bed sheet over his mattress with sharp movements, tucking pillows into pillowcases with unnecessary aggression.
After all, everyone is
He chats with her for a little while, falling easily into a mix of playful banter, conversation about the ward, and gossiping about other patients (especially Saul Croaker, who spends his days yelling at Agnes to shut it. He used to be an Unspeakable, but now his legs sometimes spontaneously disappear and make working impossible—though they always come back.)
never say hello,” he points out, and Draco bats his hand absently. Harry’s eyes are glued to his fingers.
Draco presses his back against the door as he listens until finally, Agnes’s barking stops.
, and looking at
As they approach the faculty room, Harry falls a bit further behind Draco, biting his lip as he looks between the mistletoe in the doorway and the back of Draco’s head. He almost grasps Draco’s wrist to stop him beneath the mistletoe, fingers itching to just reach out and
“What did I call you—before?” he asks, voice catching over the words. She takes a deep breath to compose herself, the troubled expression leaving her face as she squares her shoulders once again.
But somehow, through the chaos, Draco is drawn to Potter, not much younger than he is now. His green eyes are sharp and blazing, managing to bark instructions to the other healers as they all turn to him for direction.
Draco clenches his fists in his robes and turns his gaze away from Bryn.
All Harry knows is Draco. Draco.
Draco’s face is illuminated by the bursting lights — his pale skin tinted red, purple, blue, green, yellow — and Harry watches the colours shift.
He says hello to everyone who notices that he’s there, offering hugs where they’re wanted and helping Percy get the toddler off of the tree (he still doesn't know whose child it is). Draco sidles up beside him by the time he’s gotten to saying hello to Fleur, eyes wide and soot on his robes that he evidently couldn’t get off with all the commotion, and Harry’s heart skips a beat.
Draco gapes, stomach twisting at the sight. The pieces sink to the ground, puddles of black ooze on the floor, before they disappear completely.
“Christmas with the Weasleys.

(See the end of the chapter for
“Why did you even demote her?” he asks, breaking the silence.
“Different?” he asks. Something about the way she phrased it doesn’t sit well with him, and his chest tightens with concern.
Harry thanks him, resigning himself to walking up three flights of stairs, before George adds: “You might want to pop a mint in before you find him, mate.”
Bryn’s eyes soften, and he wonders if his nervousness is evident in his voice. “Are you comfortable with me using this spell on you today?”
It’s too early and he’s too tired to have emotions, but Harry softens so much he’s afraid he might actually have to hold himself up using the doorway.
Isaballe wanders off shortly after, leaving Harry to shower and dress slowly, thinking about how nice it would be to just stay under the hot spray of the shower forever. But he’s going to Hogsmeade today, and Harry promises himself that he’s
Potter stands from the armchair, and Draco’s throat tightens slightly when he pulls out his wand. It never bothers him when Soto has her wand around him. But something about Potter having a wand pointed at him leaves him… nervous.
So they do.
“They’re fine. She slipped away from them. I have a feeling she ran back into the building to rescue the Pygmy Puffs,” memory-Draco says. Potter pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs.
ever kissed, if you’ll recall,” Hermione cuts in smoothly, not looking up from her book, and Ron’s ears turn bright red. Harry laughs, Bill snickers — obviously having listened to their conversation, which is a little embarrassing — and Hermione stifles her chuckle behind her hand.
Draco flips through the few pages, noting that the dates are all from the past week. The very last page is mostly empty, apart from a short list. He raises his eyebrows and takes a sharp breath—this is exactly what he’s looking for.
He goes to pour himself more whisky, and spots a familiar blonde vigorously mixing herself a drink. He raises his eyebrows.
“Oh no, you wait until she nicks your pants,” Draco replies. There’s a faint note of embarrassment in his voice. “And
There’s something nagging at him that he can’t put his finger on, like something he’s supposed to be doing or remember, but he has no luck in thinking of what it could be. He knows he’ll quickly grow frustrated if he thinks too much about it, so he tries to focus on something else instead.
begins, as people try to get closer to him, to see his scar or say hello or shake his hand.
that he knows her name, and it’s on the tip of his tongue, but he can’t quite grasp it for a few moments. Potter’s frown steadily deepens, either in concern or impatience—or neither.
Merlin, Draco. Harry can barely even get a proper sentence out around him. His cheeks are flushed, eyes practically burning beneath long eyelashes, voice low, standing close to Harry.
He doesn’t want to admit he’s sulking, but he most definitely is. With Draco dragged off by the twins to do who-knows-what, he’s left to his own devices. (Which really just means he’s taken shelter by the food, and trying to hide his face as more people get word that he’s there.)
manage to overhear. He can’t possibly imagine how or why Potter managed to demote Soto. Surely, he can’t just do that over nothing.
“I don’t know. Both are important,” he admits, voice soft. The more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that it
“Do I need a reason to see my favourite Defence teacher?” he asks playfully, and Harry laughs.
It also raises the question of
“This stays between us,” he whispers. Agnes rolls her eyes, but nods. “I went through Soto’s office yesterday.”
Self-inking quill in hand, she scrawls:
He supposes, though, that if Draco wasn’t Draco, then Harry wouldn’t be in the situation to begin with. He smiles at the thought, and leaves his half-cleaned-up quarters in favour of eating breakfast.
, but now that he thinks of it, he doesn’t know a single thing about who he is.
“Huh,” he mutters. Someone should probably be fired for putting up the new wards wrong, because they clearly forgot to close some sort of loophole that allows patients in.
Harry has to laugh at the skepticism in Neville’s tone, but his skin heats because he
Another scene forms just as quickly as the previous one vanished.
to that, and Blaise smirks at something over Harry’s shoulder as he lights the cigarette.
ohohoho what's this, they briefly held hands and now there's a CLIFFHANGER?! 😈 🙊
Harry snorts, trying to hide it behind his hand, and evidently fails when the student starts laughing too. Neville elbows his side sharply, muttering something about
“Don’t mention it,” George says, waving it off and glancing at Fred. Harry sighs, resigning himself to whatever it is the twins are planning.
— so he makes his way through the crowd to the winding staircase, trying to find a familiar blond head.
Remembering her comment leaves a bitterness in the back of his mind because he
And Potter, unsurprisingly, is far more than lacking in the warmth that Soto brought. Instead, he brings clipped words, weighted statements, and confusing signals that Draco has trouble deciphering. On the surface, there’s the obvious irritation and distrust, and Draco doesn't want to consider what lies beneath that.
Harry laughs. “When everyone is here, yes. Let’s go to the kitchen. It’s usually quieter there.”
The first drawer is full of patient files. They can’t all possibly be of the current patients in the ward, considering there’s only five, but the majority of the files are thin. Draco assumes that the thicker ones are of Soto’s patients—himself and Agnes—and she likely doesn’t have access to anyone else’s complete files.
Soto looks back and smiles warmly, taking the letter from him and slipping it into her pocket.
It’s the first time he’s admitted it to himself so plainly, and he wonders if he should feel something dramatic after doing so — shocked, maybe, or nervous. But apart from the warmth blossoming in his chest and the continued ever-present longing for Draco, he doesn’t feel any differently.
“Oh, be nice to poor Aggie, Draco. You wouldn’t want me to have to step in, would you?” comes a bright voice to Draco’s left.
Impossibly, Potter’s lips pull into a reluctant smile. He glances at Draco, a gleam in his eye that Draco can’t pinpoint the meaning of. But Draco's mouth goes dry—Potter's eyes seem to burn—and he flushes at the eye contact. Nothing else is said between them before Potter abruptly clears his throat.
Oddly, the sight of it makes Draco’s heart leap.
“Of course,” he says, and means it. “I’m sure Molly would love to see you both again.”
“I don’t know what you were doing out here, and frankly, I don’t even want to deal with it,” Potter starts, sounding exhausted and completely, utterly sincere. “I’ve had enough of you to last a lifetime. Good luck with your memories, Malfoy.”
The fact that he can’t even recall the details of the conversation shakes him up.
He grasps his throat, sucking in deep breaths, willing it to stop.
“What’s gotten into you?” Draco asks, corners of his lips pulling down as he squints at Harry. “You look... constipated.”
she writes.
Really, he’s just glad to be away from Agnes right now.
“Where are we going?” he asks. Potter shoots an amused look over his shoulder.
They find the twins where Neville said they were, overlooking the first floor and making sure nobody is dying or getting too handsy. But the night is young, and there’ll be opportunities for that later, Harry supposes.
Before he can figure out what’s happening, Draco’s lips are against his, hands gripping his collar to pull him close, and Harry sinks into the kiss. He can barely believe that this is happening.
Draco licks his lips. Hesitates, for a moment, before turning the parchment over and scratching a list down. Potion ingredients. He scratches the words down, folds the parchment, and tucks it into an envelope.
“Tired?” Potter asks wryly.
“What do you mean?” he asks.
you’ll get to say that you know how it feels.”
The walk to the loo isn’t long enough. He’s avoided entering it since he sicked in the toilet, nervous that the memory will make him nauseous again, but nothing is different when he walks in. Still the same sterile scent, every surface gleaming, and Draco feels... fine. Absolutely fine.
“I’m not entirely sure,” he finally settles on. She lets out a little huff that could mean anything, writing on the notepad again.
He’s greeted by ivory and pale blue walls. The sterile scent hits him like a wall, mingling with something like sausage and eggs. This is St. Mungo’s, he knows. He’s very familiar with it. He pauses, unease settling into his chest—he shouldn’t
“Of course she would. Well. Thank you for going after her. If you see Ron, please let him know she’s going to be okay. And—don’t wind up in here tonight, Malfoy. You don’t want to be stuck with me to treat your injuries.”
Draco furrows his eyebrows. How could this help the case? He doesn’t know what any of these items do, or why they are important. He almost thinks that it could’ve been something Narcissa accidentally brought with her—it seems almost like a shopping list—but he doesn’t think she would make a mistake like that, and this is the only actual information in the letter.
Firenze, who keeps tugging on his ugly Christmas tie, muttering about how there’s no good cheese at this year’s party. Harry has to agree with him — last year had a large variety, but this year there are more baked goods than cheeses. It’s a shame, really.
The corner’s of Draco’s lips tighten. He’s not sure if it’s just him having an off-day, but her words sting.
But then he thinks of the potions and his attacker, and suddenly things are twisting around in his head and making everything more complicated.
Though, he supposes that he’s going to have to get used to unfamiliar things.
Draco’s scowl deepens. “I’d like to see you try. See what happens to your precious photographs then,
But importantly, Saul was admitted in 1997, which means it’s unlikely he’s working with the potion thief—though it’s still not a good idea to rule him out completely. He hasn’t even spoken to Saul directly and has no idea if he’s capable of getting away with something like this.
, but it only worsens. He cries out as the pain reaches unbearable levels—more and more and more and Draco can’t
“Malfoy, this is Healer Cassidy. They’re the best memory specialist in Britain,” Potter says. The admiration in his voice is obvious, even to Draco, and he ignores the spike of jealousy he feels at that. Cassidy blushes a bit, but turns their attention to Draco instead of replying to Potter.
Agnes’s eyes widen in excitement. She signs something in response, but it’s too quick for Draco to catch. She continues signing, and he’s not sure how to get her to stop without interrupting her, so he just lets her do it until she stops on her own.
“Well, Draco, I have good news and I have bad news, and they’re kind of contradictory. You ready to hear this?” Bryn asks.
Taking a deep breath, he unfolds the letter. A smaller piece of parchment falls out onto his lap, but he focuses on the letter itself.
“Yup,” Neville replies. “I’ll have to be alone for this, though, so I won’t ask for your help. You know how the mandrakes get at this age. Very picky about the humans they interact with. But I’m sure someone else could use your hands.”
As quickly as Draco arrived, he’s gone, leaving Harry with a windowsill of snow and papers to grade.
They reach for the small pile of papers behind them and flip through them, clicking their tongue absent-mindedly.
Bryn hums and turns to the counter, tapping their wand on the small stack of papers, which separate themselves into two different stacks. They tuck their wand away and jot something down on their clipboard.
And so Harry thinks of Draco, and yearns, and wishes, and remembers a million gentle smiles and a thousand glances that have spoken so loud without saying anything Harry can understand.
He finds himself holding his breath as he thinks about the memories, trying to figure out what’s so wrong about them. A moment passes, then another and another. Suddenly, white fear hits him, throat tightening with the realization that he doesn’t recognize the name he’d written on the note. It has to be his
“You’re Harry Potter. I read about you in the papers. But no, I don’t remember meeting you at all,” he replies. He crosses his arms and flushes, but doesn’t look away. He feels vulnerable and open, but he refuses to
He showers as quickly as possible, exiting the bathroom in a towel to find the door closed and a set of robes spread on the now-made bed. They’re deep green in colour, the trim similar to Draco’s the night before. Harry eyes them suspiciously. He swears he’s never even
—and focuses on what he’s doing. He’s bent slightly over his desk as he writes something, the quill scratching on the parchment.
Harry wakes, shivering, to the early morning light and a dying fire. He rolls over in bed with a groan, cursing the cold stone of the castle, and his bed, too, for being so large and empty as it is.
“No,” he says. Potter sighs audibly.
Harry is still hacking a lung, not recovered from almost dying a minute ago, so Neville takes it upon himself to answer for him. The bastard.
” they begin, muttering the words under their breath over and over, repeatedly moving their wand in a complex hexagonal pattern. Their eyes are focused completely on a seemingly arbitrary part of the wall behind Draco, hardly blinking at all as they perform the spell.
As he does, he thinks of Draco. Long hair, piercing eyes, knowing smiles and shared glances.
Potter doesn’t seem surprised that Draco still hasn’t let that go.
“You kids are always so rude, but no worries, I don’t hold it against you. You’ll learn better when you’re older,” he says with a sure nod and patronizing smile. Draco’s hand twitches in irritation, but the lingering guilt stops him from saying that
He furrows his brow, and decidedly doesn’t comment on it. Best to leave it be.
The room spins, the sink seems to be getting further and further away, the walls stretching and warping. His stomach turns over itself, and panic rises in him—he knows what this has to be, but he doesn’t want it to happen.
Harry laughs, the image of Isabelle dragging Draco’s pants into his room still ingrained in his mind. Having to return those to Draco was the highlight of Harry’s month.
to trust her.
“In this instance, the black dot is an indicator of what kind of spell was used on you. This memory charm is known as the ‘Repealed Obliviate,’ and it’s usually completely reversible.”
“He beat you!” someone shouts, voice breaking, and the strange muffled quality over the courtyard shatters. The sound of the girl’s choked sobs reach Draco, then, and the sound makes his throat tighten.
since Potter became part of the ward, which certainly isn’t enough time to judge anything. He feels an inexplicable need to defend Potter, pushing the unwanted image of Potter's reluctant smile out of his mind.
“Do you think Neville would miss us if we left?” Draco asks in his ear, voice low. His breath sends a slight shiver down Harry’s spine. He wonders if Draco intended that.
Because Draco loves Harry, too.
“No, no,” he says lightly. “I’m just asking you to distract Wagner if he decides to impulsively check on me. He shouldn’t, but in the off-chance he does…”
big today — and takes a bite, while Neville takes five points from a Gryffindor student for less than appropriate handlings of their sausage.
Potter clears his throat awkwardly.
.oOoOo.
At noon exactly, Draco’s nerves as tight as a wire, someone raps softly on one of the metal poles hanging up his curtain.
“Nevermind the pants. It’s almost noon, you know,” he says, and Harry gawks.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Draco asks, blushing, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. He rubs the back of his neck bashfully.
Best-case scenario, she’s fully supportive and is willing to help him—but he’s not sure if the worst-case scenario would be losing her companionship, or if she were to rat him out. Both thoughts leave him wary, but the latter more so.
Cuthbert, who falls asleep mid-conversation in an armchair by the fire, and Harry has the dreadful suspicion that it might even be the armchair he died in. The thought makes him so uncomfortable that he’s relieved when Binns falls asleep, slipping over to the refreshments table for a snack.
But now, sitting a few feet away from her, Draco feels a little sick. He can understand why the trainees don't like being in the ward. Rue is much younger than he initially thought she was, and it leaves his stomach twisting.
Draco bristles at the lack of explanation, as if Potter doesn’t think he needs one.

“That’s a

his glasses, considering that he can see floors and walls alright, and what else does he really need to be able to walk?
His heart skips a beat. He finally sees himself. Memory-Draco breaks from the Death Eaters, the first to notice Potter. He runs to Potter’s side and throws him a wand, shouts his name, and then the world descends to chaos.

After dinner, gifts were exchanged. Harry gave Hermione yet another book, and Hermione gave Harry a watch. Harry gave Ron a lot of food, and Ron gave Harry a music box saying it was so cool how Muggles could make things like that. Draco gave Hermione a book too, and Ron a Muggle pen. Hermione gave Draco a fairytale book, and Ron gave Draco a scarf.
As Harry walked down the hallway to go to his dorm, he wanted to walk back. He wanted to enter the library again and take back what he fucking said; because he didn’t mean it.
Draco’s demeanor fell, face blank. “I didn’t know he was going to be here. I came for Molly and Arthur, and-”
“You’re my mother,” he shook his head. “...and the only family member I can tolerate,” he whispered under his breath, walking over to her and hugging her. He knew he shouldn’t have; Malfoys don’t hug. They don’t show affection. Hell, they’re lucky if they even understand what love is. But she hugged him back, almost as if she had been waiting for him to.
“I’m used to you annoying the fuck out of me,” Harry retorted. “But it’s a good kind of annoyance, I suppose. Beats Ron and Hermione’s constant bickering. Though, obviously, I have no way of being able to tell if it’s bickering or a normal conversation. I don’t really speak to them much.”
“Why didn’t you tell me? Fuck, why are you with me? L-look at what I did to you,” Harry was saying, turning to face Draco. He took Draco’s hand and made him trace over one of the scars, “I can’t believe… I should have known it would have been this brutal… I’m so, so sorry, I…”
“I…” Harry stood before his headmaster, his heart pounding. He moved forward down the spiral staircase, pausing when he heard footsteps. He looked back at Dumbledore, who gestured for him to come back.
“Must be easy for you, since you can’t hear him. Though, I must say, this past week without his stupid loud rambling has been quite peaceful,” Hermione pointed out.
He Apparated to Pansy’s house, feeling a little disoriented when he reached. He probably would never get used to the feeling of Apparating. Looking around, he flinched when he saw Pansy and Draco, wide-eyed, sitting on the couch.
“Do you think I should break up with him?” Ginny asked, wide-eyed.
The white-haired boy studied Harry’s demeanor as he sat at the desk, getting out his homework and textbooks to work. His every move seemed so fragile, almost as if he was afraid. He also stared down at his work and rarely looked up during classes, nor did he engage in conversations with anyone other than Hermione or Ron. Hand slightly trembling, he stared down at the paper in front of him, then back up at Harry.
“It’s weird. I care a lot about this person, even though… I didn’t really expect to.”
“You’re not going to kill him, are you?” asked Harry.
been our safe place recently,” Draco pointed out, which was true. Draco and Harry had decided to use the Room of Requirement as a place to hang out without being spotted or disturbed. Draco slowly shut the door behind him and
“Harry, you were sent to the Hospital Wing for two weeks because of him, and vice versa. You can’t just-”
“When Draco finds out, you’ll be having more than just one moment of weakness,” Harry muttered, adjusting himself on the bed and turning so that his back was facing Draco, who was silently chuckling to himself before he left.
“No, you stop!” Harry bellowed. “I can’t trust you anymore.”
“I’m not blind. I saw you open your eyes.”
?” asked Snape as he slowly walked over to the window, looking outside.
“What did you just say, Scarface?”
“I’m not sure. I can only do so much, Draco. Use your brain.”
“But now I realize you were on my side all along. And I feel so,
It was going to be different with two people, as well as Pansy, who most likely wouldn’t be taking it easy on Harry.
That was, until the evening. Harry had eaten whatever he could and exited the Hall as quickly as possible. He was walking down the hall when he saw Draco. This time, he didn’t flinch but did take a step backward when he noticed Draco was with someone.
After a moment, he looked up so Harry could understand what he was saying. “Are you mad? That I didn’t tell you?”
“Do you trust me?”
“Oh, that… that was stupid. And weirdly emotional. I wrote it at like two a.m. so don’t even think about it-”
Draco looked back down at him. “You’re awake?"
“Was there anything you wanted to specifically say to me, or…?” He folded his arms, looking over at the white-haired boy.
“You don’t need to apologize for what happened. I understand. I was… just worried you wouldn’t want to learn sign language because of it.”
“Harry?"
Harry slowly nodded. “Yeah. Yes, I understand…” Draco let out a sigh of relief.
“Morning, lovebirds,” Pansy greeted as Harry entered. Hermione, Ron, Luna, and Pansy were all staring at Harry, then at Draco after he pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of him.
“You know, Potter, you aren’t worthy enough for my son.”
“I’m not whipped. In fact, I’m far from whipped.”
“Of course not, of course not!”
“But the Trace breaks in four days,” Harry pointed out.
“Sit down,” she said, grabbing his hand and pulling him down. They sat at the dining table, both sitting in silence. “Do you still love him?”
“I wonder where Harry ran off to,” The two heard Hermione say. “He keeps on disappearing.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Do I need to spell everything out for you, Potter?”
He knew it was a mistake to stay for the wedding. And his birthday - well, that was just sad. He was excited to be seventeen, to finally have the Trace off of him, but all he could think of was his sixteenth birthday, spent with Draco, alone in his room at the Grimmauld Place.
“Well, good, because I didn’t raise you to be like that,” she said sternly. “Anyway, we tried to acquire them, but it was difficult. For now, I’m fine like this. Besides, wizarding hearing aids would be quite expensive.”
“Lunch will be soon,” she said as she left.
Suddenly, he had lost consciousness.
The rest of dinner was mostly in silence. Lucius hadn’t said a word. After dinner was over, Narcissa pleaded desperately for Draco and Harry to spend the night, how it was so lovely having Draco home that she didn’t want him to go soon.
“Six a.m. is like midnight!”
Harry blinked, waking himself up. “What? Someone who uses too much hair gel?”
“How could you not tell me? Are you on his side? I thought I told you to tell me-”
I was staring at Dr-”
were the one who insisted on all of this.
“Holy shit, Harry. You had me so worked up over the metal device that I completely forgot about Christmas dinner with the Weasleys. Oh, they’re going to hate me. They’re going to actually hate me!”
Harry found himself snorting as he read the letter. He looked up to see Draco was already looking at him, seeming satisfied with himself. He was confused, but Draco knew exactly why he was satisfied. He had managed to make Harry smile for the first time.
They washed the liquidy slime off of their faces. Draco was done before Harry, but found himself waiting for him. The two stood there for a moment too long, until Draco finally spoke. “...you have some in your hair,” he mumbled while signing.
“Will. You. Relax?! You’re giving me a fucking headache!” Harry cut Draco off from his ranting, rubbing his temples before taking another sip of his coffee. “Look, they don’t hate
“He has an Invisibility Cloak, doesn’t he?” she asked. “And… worst comes to worst, we can pretend we’re dating.”
“What?” he asked.
This is literally the last weekend before school starts skjssks so I don't know how often I will be able to post chapters (I have this thing where I get the most inspiration to write in class, and zero inspiration to write during the holidays).
Harry blinked in surprise. What was that thought just went through his head?
He remembered what his parents had told him, more so his father. People needed to be ‘worthy’ of a Malfoy’s love. What was even love, according to a Malfoy? Despite how much he resented Lucius, he couldn’t deny the nights he had found his father pacing back and forth last year, worrying about Narcissa as she fell sicker and sicker by the day.
Ron simply gave him an apologetic look. “It’s not you. He’s the problem.”
“Right,” Draco nodded, looking around the room uncomfortably. “How often-”
“You’re not making me do anything. I chose it. I chose you. I will always choose you.”
“Uh,  yeah, just… fuck,” he said, grateful for Ron who had already grabbed him and was holding him up. “Sorry, it’s just a headache.”
Hermione and Pansy walked outside to the lake, both of them were silent. There was nothing other than the sounds of their boots against the hard ground. It was a gloomy day with a deathly serious atmosphere.
“Draco-”
As a given, Ron and Harry took a room, one at the very end of the hallway. The Eighth Year rooms weren’t split into different sections for genders - just the girls’ dorms on the right and the boys’ on the left, right across each other in a hallway down the Eighth Year Common Room.
“Molly! Hi!” Harry greeted, hoping she didn’t see - and if she did see, she’d pretend nothing happened. He walked forwards and hugged her.
Someone slowly knocked on the door. Draco hadn’t noticed since he was busy writing away on the paper. He also hadn’t noticed that his Dark Mark and forehead was hurting deeply.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Harry said after he composed himself, surprised to see him there. The house elves were all done with cleaning and cooking, so they were off somewhere else. Which, in Harry’s opinion, made things worse. He got a glass and poured water in it, downing it as quickly as possible before turning to leave.
still works, right?”
“I’m sure a color-changing spell would help you a lot later,” Harry responded. “But thanks for the insight.”
“Hermione, don-” he started, but she and Ron already stood up, practically running to the bathroom. Harry gave the others at the table an uncomfortable smile before getting up and going after them. “We’re sort of invading privacy here--”
“Well, she put what I was thinking into words. Besides, I agree. I think you need a break from all of this, mate,” he sighed. “I know you don’t want to hear it, but I’m worried about you.”
Caught off guard, he quickly cleared his throat, looking down at his book, shaking his head. “No, nothing. You just… um… seem different.”
Potions essay you’re talking about?”
“Um… you know Draco’s coming, right?” Ron asked almost carefully. “How did your date go, by the way?”
Harry’s eyes moved down to his lips, trying to understand what he said. Frowning, he turned back to Hermione who had tapped him on the shoulder. He wondered what Draco said, but at this point, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know. By the look on everyone’s faces, it seemed that no one believed that he was deaf.
“Not really,” he said quietly, but with the way she looked at him, he could tell she knew he was lying. “Have they found any trace of Potter?”
“Your mother is so lovely,” Harry said with a sigh as he shut the door behind them, looking around Draco’s large room, plopping himself down on the bed, too tired to look through Draco’s stuff in his room. “She’s so nice… I really wasn’t expecting that.”
The lesson went by somewhat smoothly. Harry found it easy to teach everyone, especially since they were actually quite eager to learn. He also found it to be a good thing to be doing this rather than moping about all day. It felt like he was achieving something. At the end of the lesson, as he waited for everyone to leave, he noticed Cho hanging back.
“Calm down, Draco! It’s a phone.” Harry gently took the phone from his hands and started to set everything up for him, carefully explaining the process on the way. After it was done, Harry handed it to him. “Here. Now, press down on this button. This is called the Home Button. You can use it for exiting apps- applications and stuff like that.”
“He’s just helping me learn WSL and I’m helping him keep up with his classes. Nothing else,” he put his hands up as if to tell her to calm down. “Seriously.” he folded his arms, then looked at her again.
Harry entered and sat down. It had been five minutes and Draco wasn’t here yet. Harry decided to just change into his pajamas. He took off his shirt and was about to pull on his very oversized t-shirt, when-
“Harry, please,” he pleaded. “I want you to have it. It works for my mother.”
“My face or the sunrise?” Draco asked jokingly, but his eyes were glinting.
Harry sat at the desk, unable to focus on his homework. He jumped when Draco tapped him on the shoulder. “You didn’t see me come in?” he asked, sitting down across from him. Harry shook his head, watching as he took out his textbook. “Alright, let’s get started.”
“Then what were we meant to be?” Draco asked without thinking.
When he got back into his room, he saw Dodger had picked up the stack of letters that Draco had written that was meant for Harry.
Harry stared at her, eyebrows knitted. “You know WSL?”
“Not fully gone!” Harry cried.
“Potter’s that way, moron,” Blaise pointed towards the table Ron, Hermione, Harry and Ginny were sitting at. He cleared his throat, then sat back down at the booth. Pansy shook her head in disbelief, then followed after Draco. Blaise cursed loudly then left too.
One step at a time. He could try that.
The next Saturday was almost just as the dull as the last. It was Ron’s birthday, so it was definitely more interesting than the Saturday before.
Draco clutched his arm and Harry put a hand to his forehead. Both of them noticed the other in pain at the same time and scrambled over to each other, Harry put his hand on Draco’s Dark Mark and Draco gently using his index finger to massage Harry’s forehead.
- Ash (malfoypolix) <3
Harry grinned. “That’s cool!” He tapped his watch two times.
The awkwardness had somehow managed to die out soon after Draco had greeted all of the Weasleys. Draco ended up in a heated discussion with Hermione about some book that Hermione thought was amazing but Draco hated.
By the end of the day, Harry flopped down on the couch before putting on his hearing aids again. “My arm hurts. Can we stop now?”
He stared down at his steaming hot drink, pushing it to the side, suddenly losing his appetite. “I don’t know. On one hand, I’m still really mad about everything, but… he’s the only thing I used to be sure about. I thought as long as we were together, I could figure everything else out in time.”
“Hey, at least I didn’t throw some Muggle device that could help him hear into the lake.”
mean he’d be stuck with his own thoughts, it was a risk he was willing to take for today.
” Draco echoed, raising an eyebrow. “Yeah, no way I’m taking his last name-”
“Not… particularly,” Lucius said. “Remember what we discussed in the summer, Draco?”
As the song changed to a more upbeat tune, Draco quickly spun Harry around. “Like dancing.”
“Draco,
“Harry, please just
” Harry echoed.
“That’s not true,” he replied. “I just… you know, you could be doing this to get on my nerves.”
“You are in a relationship with Harry Potter. End it now.” Snape demanded.
As it turned out, Harry went to dinner at the Weasleys’, not surprised to see Draco there. But what did surprise him was that Ron, Hermione or Astoria weren’t around. It was only him, Draco, Molly, Arthur, Ginny and George. Molly said the three had gone shopping for some last minute recipe she wanted to cook. Harry wondered if three people were necessary or they just didn’t want to deal with the heavy, tense atmosphere that loomed every time Harry and Draco were in a room together.
Harry had been staring at Draco’s lips, yet not a word had registered in his brain. He reached forward and used his index finger to gently trace over the blonde’s lips, smiling slightly to himself. “I’m deaf, of course I can’t listen,” he said.
“Why can’t I brew it?” Harry asked.
“Well… I don’t see a reason to. It was given as a gift, was it not?” Draco asked in a defensive tone. He looked down at Harry, who looked at him as if he didn’t believe him one bit. “Shut up.”
“No, it didn’t!” Draco protested. He slowly got up and sat down on Harry’s bed. “Now, come here.”
. A Slytherin, pure-blood. His enemy, and now coincidentally his crush.
“Sure, if you want to,” Draco said with a shrug. “Hi, how are you? Today class was super bori-”
The feeling in his chest lightened a bit. “Oh, you mean that way. I was just wondering if you… I dunno, liked her or something.”
After breakfast, Harry took his time to get back to the Gryffindor Common Room - it wasn’t as if he had anything to do.
Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter!!
That was a lie, but Harry didn’t call him on it. If Hermione, Ron, or anyone else asked, he would just say he didn’t think to check the last day for turning in assignments. Which was certainly not the week before, because Harry, like said earlier, hadn’t checked.
Draco meant the exact opposite of what he said.
“It’s not like they’re whispering,” she said. “Besides, it’s easy to lip read their conversations when they enunciate so much.”
“I think so too,” he replied, grinning to himself as he looked down at the charm bracelet on his wrist.
“Are you talking about Cho?” Harry raised an eyebrow, moving forward and sitting down beside him on the couch. “...so you
When Draco was sure there was no one in the hallway, he slowly stepped out, staring at Harry who was staring at the floor, unable to decipher what was going on.
“Yes, quite a pity how expensive it is, though,” she replied, eyebrows furrowed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh come on, you’re not looking too great, and Draco is barely surviving. What happened between you two?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You’re so paranoid.” She whispered as they sat down at an empty table.
“Then how come you flinch every time someone says his name?” Hermione asked, getting impatient.
“Stay,” Harry said, his eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t lose two people in one night. God, Draco, this hurts so much.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake!” he groaned, taking four cards from the pile. “Ooh, be prepared to lose-”
The two stared at each other in silence, processing what the other had said.
interact in the hallways or classes unless absolutely necessary. Do you understand me?”
“I’m not, I know that,” Draco replied. He longed for Harry’s arms to be wrapped around him.
“Ah, that’s really where you are wrong. My son is too young to understand that this is merely just a…
“I’m hoping not even then,” Draco retorted.
They both ordered - Draco got an Americano while Harry got a hot chocolate. The two decided to go to the park nearby so they could sit a bit further away from each other.
“Yes?”
“It’s fine. I guess learning how to defend myself is more important,” Harry stood up. “Hey, listen, I’m really tired, and I should probably go check up on Ron. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”
They fell into a silence as Harry got started with his essay. Draco picked up his WSL book and started reading, surprised to feel Harry’s hand rest on his thigh under the table. He couldn’t help but realize Harry was right. In this room, where they were away from everyone, they were in fact just Draco and Harry.
Draco bit back an insult. Blaise was right. He didn’t have a right to say anything. Over the course of the past five years, he had done much worse to Harry. Yet, wasn’t the difference that he actually felt guilty, rather than Blaise, who seemed proud, as if he had done something great?
“Well, the only other thing I have is Butterbeer, and it’s far too early in the morning for that,” she replied. “Besides, I make pretty good lemonade.”
The day before Christmas, Draco stayed in his room, lying under the covers of his bed. He had about five or six poems simply hidden under his pillow, but he knew he couldn’t send them. More so, shouldn’t. Malfoy Manor had held a Death Eater meeting two days ago, and the things he heard made him realize the depth of the situation he was in.
“You’re impossible to talk to,” Harry said with a bitter laugh. “This isn’t about me kissing Ginny. This is about you betraying me.”
“Well, it was also because of what you said about You-Know-Who,” Hermione pointed, then pursed her lips when Harry rolled his eyes. “Sorry.”
“Yesss,” He cried, “and I r-ruined everything! You see, I just wanted to help… to be th-there for him, and I ruined it. I also said some things I shouldn’t have said… even though I knew the pain he was going through…” Harry trailed off into silence.
“Oh, wow,” Ginny gasped, starting to frown. “Oh, no.”
“Probably with the Death Eaters outside the school…”
“So like old times? Do we need to fight over who’s under the Invisibility Cloak again?” he asked as they pulled away from each other. “It better be you, just so we’re clear. I’m not about to sacrifice myself again.”
missing the point right now. Let me finish, please?”
“Hey, Harry, Hermione, haven’t seen you since…” Pansy trailed off into silence but quickly changed the subject, “Anyways, I need to talk to you guys.” Pansy quickly entered the train compartment and sat down beside Harry. Hermione politely greeted Pansy and waited for Harry to greet Pansy too. But he didn’t. He seemed to be staring into space. Ron awkwardly waved at Pansy.
Draco smiled slightly, sighing as he ran a hand through his pale hair, the brown streak in his hair glinting. “Of course I heard. I know him better than himself.”
“Thankful? Yes, thank you for leaving, Draco,” he spat. Draco’s name was like poison on his tongue. “Thank you for making me think that there was something wrong with me, that I didn’t deserve to move on and be happy like you are.”
“After what happened…” he gulped, “everyone was treading on thin ice. They still are. They try not to bring it up if they don’t have to. But you? You weren’t afraid to say it to my face. And you weren’t afraid to treat me the same way you have been the past few years. It was like… while it feels like everything is changing, you’re the one reminding me that not much really has to change.”
“It’s fine,” he rolled his eyes, but continued walking. “Let’s just go get the shopping over with.”
Draco picked up the piece of paper to see what Harry replied with.
The two stared at each other, unsure of what to say now. This was a new, strange territory. They seemed to be civil with each other, but it wasn’t as if they could say they were friends. No, they were a long way from friends. More like… acquaintances.
“Well, that clearly wasn’t the best thing to say,” Draco muttered to himself after he was thrown into his room and locked in there without his wand or luggage. At this point, he wasn’t even surprised; but he was wondering why his father was so firm about keeping Draco at the Manor - what was he planning? Draco was sure that it couldn’t be anything good.
Harry’s gaze moved up to look into Draco’s eyes, unsure of what to say. “Um…”
Luckily, the two hid it quite well. Arthur Weasley, who was staring at Draco and Harry, nodded. “Interesting, interesting. Well, congratulations.”
“Harry, how do you feel-” Hermione and Pansy stared at Draco and Harry for a few moments, unsure of what to say. The confusion on their faces were clear, but it seemed that they were holding back a smile. “Um… sorry, are we interrupting something?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You only need to be here for ten minutes. Besides, I promised to buy you something in return, so stop complaining,” he turned to Harry, who nervously cracked his knuckles. “It’ll be fine, darling, I promise you. We’re not going to hurt you.”
Comment below if that's something you'd like! <3
“Harry,” he stood up so they were looking at each other eye-to-eye. “That poem… fucking hell... it's about my mother. I don’t have a girlfriend. I don’t even like a girl- I mean I don’t even have a crush.”
“He told me everything,” she smiled slightly. “You don’t need to pretend. I know you’ve been helping him with sign language.”
“No, it is not! Are you colorblind?” Hermione asked outrageously. “Harry, tell him it’s dark purple.”
“Spectacular,” Draco replied, not looking back to Harry. He wondered why Harry was talking to him - and pretending as if they hadn’t argued, though he was slightly relieved. Draco had pushed the whole argument to the back of his mind so that he wouldn’t think about it. Bringing it up now probably wouldn’t be the best idea. “And you?” Draco added after a few moments, slowly turning to look at Harry.
Harry jolted to the side on the carriage, gasping loudly. Everyone who was on the carriage - Hermione, Ron, and Pansy - raised an eyebrow at Harry who awkwardly cleared his throat.
Luna skipped off to class, taking her sweet time as she did so, her shoes in her hands. Harry simply chuckled before quickly going to his first class.
“No, you just broke in. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here.”
“Yeah, mate, I agree with ‘Mione,” Ron said with a nod. Harry fell back in his pace, watching as his two best friends rushed into class, slowly following after him.
hurt you.”
“Even if we were dating these two years, you would’ve changed. I don’t think you understand that I don’t want who you were or will be, but who you
“Anyway…” Harry said, seeming as if he didn’t notice Pancy’s yelp. “It’s seriously been three years since your wedding, huh? I’m surprised you two aren’t sick of each other.”
“Great!” Harry clapped his hands together. “I’ll start. Draco, truth or truth?”
“I told her everything. She told me she would help make it seem like I was marrying her. My father signed a contract to get rid of the curse on my wedding day. It didn’t explicitly say that I had to be marrying Astoria.”
Harry had woken up later than Ron for once, and the first thing he did was reach for the letter sitting on his bedside table - someone must have taken the letter from Hedwig, who was now sitting perched at the window.
On Saturday morning, Draco walked to the tent. It was mostly empty. He walked over to the couch and saw a pile of clothes neatly folded, and a piece of paper placed on top.
“Cho,” Harry replied solemnly.
“I just bumped into him, it was an accident,” Harry said, snapping out of his daydream.
Harry felt the hot tears run down his face, his chest hurting as if it was scalded. He turned to leave. Just before he pushed past the curtain, Draco spoke, springing up Harry’s hope.
Far from it, actually.
“Draco, you are not a killer,” Dumbledore said.
“Morning,” Pansy said as Draco sat down beside her at the Slytherin table for breakfast. “Slept well?”
“And risk you running back into Potter’s arms? No. Never.”
When Draco entered, Harry coughed and set the soup down on the bedside table, trying to avoid his gaze.
Draco simply smiled.
“Harry, it’s cold,” Draco whined, “Why did we agree to come see some stupid Muggle fireworks with Muggles around?”
You have until midnight.”
“I told you I would explain myself. You didn’t let me, Harry, and this is how things have become. So, therefore, you ruined everythin-”
Just then, the door sprung wide open. Draco and Harry managed to jump apart just in time, both breathing heavily, almost having a heart attack. Harry bit his lip as he stood there for a few moments, looking at Draco, before turning to who was at the door.
“I’m not kidding, Harry.”
“Y-yeah…” Draco stuttered. “Hey, um. I won’t be able to come to the tent tomorrow.”
“Hey, I’m only buying nice, pretty things! We need to make our house seem homey, you know. I’m not surprised you don’t know how to decorate things. Malfoy Manor is literally just white walls.”
“Are you… okay?” she asked while signing. “Did something happen?”
“Listen, Molly, I… I suppose I haven’t properly apologized for my words and actions as a child. I was under the influence of my father-”
Harry stood in front of the mirror, fixing his sweater and tie, and running a hand through his hair to fix it. He then noticed that in one small part of his hair, the roots were greyish-white.
“I know.”
“Okay, ew,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes and turning away. Ron just gagged, Hermione rolled her eyes and Luna smiled.
“Strategic? In a stupid Muggle game? Whatever,” Draco huffed, standing up and walking towards the window. The sun was starting to set. He turned around to look at Harry again. “Did we really spend the whole afternoon playing board games?”
He thought of the time they had together so far - he wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It was refreshing to be around Draco; not only because of his honesty, but his fresh perspective on things. Harry had only ever known to think in a certain way, and his friends would usually agree with him. Draco would challenge him, give him a different way to think about it. Most of all, he was the only real love he’d ever known. He had friends, sure, and a lot of people that cared about him, however, being Harry Potter came with a lot of expectations and responsibilities, that all seemed to fade when he was with Draco.
“Harry, mate, did you hear? We won!”
excuse of a wizard. And don’t even get me started on his lie about the Dark Lord being back. All of this is just to make everyone pity him, to get them on his side.”
“Harry, did you do your Potions homework?” Hermione asked, breaking the silence that was between the three as they sat in the library. Ron and Harry looked up from their textbooks.
“More like who,” Pansy snorted, laughing even more when Hermione choked, coughing.
“Goodness! Too long,” Draco said dramatically. “We need to make up for lost time.”
“Well, no-”
“A phase?” Harry asked. He wanted to laugh. “I’m sorry to say, but your son has done quite some things that make it not
“Me? I should be thanking you.” Astoria said. “We’ll finish this off later, Draco.” She winked and walked in the direction opposite from where Harry was walking up to.
They had only been shopping for around thirty minutes, but he was already tired. Everything seemed so exhausting lately. All he wanted to do was lay in bed and stay there.
“Oh, Draco,” she smiled warmly, “you don’t need to apologize for anything. I understand completely.”
“We’ll have to stay for the wedding, or Mum’s going to be more mad than she already is,” Ron sighed in response. He turned to Hermione, who put a hand on his thigh. They were seated on the floor of Ron’s room.
He moved away from Harry, sitting down across from him. “I was, uh… supposed to do that extra credit work. But the Room of Requirement ended up bringing me here for some reason.”
“Oh, stop with the deceit,” Draco shook his head, folding his arms. “You can barely look at me.”
Draco stared at his mother for a few seconds, frowning, before nodding slightly. “I… I see. I didn’t know that you knew this whole time… Thank you for not saying anything to father.”
Just as Harry looked up, Draco had opened the door, hiding his face away from Harry.
Draco grew pale, a faraway look in his eyes. “...right…”
“To what? More of your bullshit? For all I know, you’ve been playing me this whole time,” Harry snapped, “as more Death Eater work.”
“No. I have a system. I dream, I wallow for five minutes, then I move on. It’s easier that way,” he sighed, swiftly losing the energy to argue with Draco.
“I didn’t know you two were so intimate-”
Finally, he cleared his throat. “So, we could… reschedule this lesson for tomorrow?”
“I was really looking forward to just making out this study session,” He muttered, “but you procrastinating git…”
“Um…” He looked down, struggling to open the wrapping. “I don’t want to ruin the wrapping, it looks really nice-”
anyway, hope you enjoyed the chapter! thank you for all the continuous love.
“We do,” Hermione said while signing with her hands, looking over to Ron.  “It’s just so hard to process… You really couldn’t hear our screaming?”
Then she left. He hugged his knees, resting his head against the wall. He loved Hermione and Ron for everything they were sacrificing for him; he did. But it just wasn’t the same. It was so difficult to be grateful when all he wanted was Draco. He wanted to see him. Their last night together; on their anniversary - which was now tainted by Dumbledore’s death - was good. Even after the chaos and mishaps. But when he’d woken up, Draco was gone, without a trace, except for a small note.
“You know, technically, only one of has to be under the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry pointed out, folding his arms. Draco shook his head after realizing what Harry meant.
“So visitors are finally allowed,” Hermione told Harry as he started eating.
He stared out the window, up into the sky. The atmosphere was cold, empty. He turned back to the empty paper and starting writing. Pouring his heart and soul, furiously writing away. He didn’t even notice when Narcissa slowly opened the door and called out his name.
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry… nothing. He’s gone.”
“You’re the one who’s making it difficult!” Draco said outrageously, but begrudgingly put his hands out. “Okay.” He started signing the sentence but stopped halfway, forgetting how to sign one of the words, letting out a groan.
“Luna, Nargles aren’t real,” Hermione said with a slight chuckle, seeming as if she had been aching to say that. “I don’t know where you came up with them, but they’re.
“You’re ignoring me,” Harry complained, leaning forward and resting his head on Draco’s arm, still pouting. “I’m bored.”
It seemed like the answer was yes.
“Do you?”
He immediately stood up and left the Hall, Draco following a few minutes later. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances when Harry practically ran out of the Hall.
?” He scoffed, waving away the treat Crabbe offered him. “Seriously. It’s definitely all just an act to make people gain sympathy for him. I don’t believe it one bit.”
!” Draco whined, his face getting red as he embarrassedly turned to Harry. “She’s just joking… I didn’t wish that at all… pfft.” Harry simply snickered to himself, turning to Narcissa who was grinning, winking at Harry sneakily before returning to eat her food.
“Oh, and,” Harry set down his fork, “I… want to go to the cliff. Please. I know you said you're busy, but...”
“The hell are you talking about?”
“It was a rhetorical question, bonehead.”
“You both were upset, Harry. It’s only natural.”
When he got out with just a towel wrapped around his waist, he heard the door open from and footsteps.
“Good one, Ron!”
“Ron’s right,” Pansy said, who had been amusedly enjoying the conversation. “Nargles are real, okay?! If Luna says they’re real then I believe her.” Harry groaned as Pansy smirked, ready for Hermione to start arguing about the facts and how Nargles were not real.
“Draco.”
first hickey.
“Well, I’m sure they’re not hate letters,” he stood up, then looked back at Harry. “Come with us. Please? We’re just going to the Three Broomsticks.”
Harry put his hands in his pockets, then nodded. “Alright. If you say so,” he said, putting a hand to the white streak in his hair. “Have you noticed this? It goes white every time I see you. It’s probably the stress I get from seeing your face.”
Harry said nothing, looking back down at his lap, unsure of what to say. “Fuck, Draco,” he whispered. “What are we doing?”
“Hey,” came Harry’s voice a little closer than he expected.
that they exist-”
staggered a few steps backwards, but managed to balance himself before they could both fall on the floor.
“Because I messed up. We messed up.”
Draco felt his chest tighten as he shut the door behind him. His father had seen him. There was no way Draco would be able to leave without Lucius stopping him now.
Harry nodded and slowly turned and exited the Hospital Wing.
Then she left, and it was just Harry and Draco, who moved to the couch, sitting back. They were exhausted.
cross,” he held both of Draco’s hands tightly as they remained standing there. “I’m so angry. But I can’t bring myself to waste our limited time like that. So fuck you, but also, I love you.”
“Thanks for calling me a girl, darling,” Harry told him sarcastically. By now, the three had reached the classroom of Defense Against the Dark Arts. They were the first ones there. Draco and Harry went to sit in the front of the class, and Pansy went to her usual spot, somewhere in the middle row.
“Shut up Ron,” she snapped. “Open it.”
Draco was rather surprised by her embrace, but it was good to see so many familiar faces again. For a short while, people were in one big group talking, but after a while, it broke off into separate groups.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, well, Merry Christmas!” Harry said, taking the gift boxes he had in his hands and put it under the Christmas tree.
“You’ll see soon, Draco,” said Snape. “The reason I found out was because of this theory. A legend, you could say.”
“Is it okay if I kiss you?” Draco whispered, his voice cracking as he spoke.
“Oh come on Ron, that joke’s old.”
“Shut up, Pansy,” Harry rolled his eyes, putting a hand to his neck. He had forgotten to wear a turtleneck. Draco’s eyes moved down to his neck, surprised by the few hickeys that were there. Well… it only made sense that he moved on. Clearly they didn’t love each other anymore. It was sensible, really…
“But that’s not till after breakfast!”
“...nothing.”
“Just sort out old files,” Harry answered, so grateful that Hermione had interrupted them that he pulled her into a hug. He quickly pulled away and awkwardly stood in front of the two girls.
Draco frowned. “I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. This is probably so awful for you. Do you ever… regret being with me?”
There was a warmth that hit his chest suddenly. He was confused - it felt exactly like…
“I thought you were going to be late like you were last Saturday.”
“Okay, for one, we don’t even have
Harry sat in the hospital wing, watching as Lavender came all over Ron (who was sleeping and had no idea what was going on). Then Hermione came and took a hold of Ron’s hand. Harry found it cute and all, but he really just missed Draco.
“I just… don’t think you should stop trying new spells,” Draco frowned as he watched him sit down across from him. “Seriously, Blaise is an idiot. Even while deaf you can probably do every spell better than him.”
“You’re so pale. Ferret.”
Harry looked at him, frowning. “I kind of wanted to go to the cliff. You know, spend some time there.”
He stood up slowly, trying to take Harry’s hand. “Maybe our rule isn’t a good idea.”
“Oh, come on, don’t be so negative, Harry!” she smacked him. “Do you know what this is? This is
“Yes, I did. I came here after dinner yesterday. It took ages but I had to make it. It felt empty without it. Besides, I thought maybe… you need a place to get away from everything.”
As he sat in that room by himself, hearing the chatter and laughter from downstairs, Harry realized he hadn’t felt this alone since he was eleven years old.
“Are you sure you weren’t an accident?” He said, making Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe laugh. Draco felt terrible for saying it and immediately turned away from Harry, grabbing his bag and leaving the classroom and waited right outside for Pansy so he could talk to her.
Draco looked around. He had no time to go to the bathroom to hide. So he jumped on Harry’s bed and closed the curtains around the bed right as Ron walked in.
And somehow, this had become their new (ab)normal. But it was like Draco had said: normal wasn’t quite their thing.
“What about Astoria?” Harry gulped.
“It’s soft and comforting, because it smells like you, Dray.”
“I didn’t eat breakfast,” Harry answered with an eye roll. “Relax, Draco, I’m fine.”
As Harry looked around Platform 9 and 3/4, memories of the previous years flooded his brain. He felt his heart beating quickly as he looked around, in hopes to find a certain white-haired boy.
“I’m not sure he wants me to be here,” Harry told her with a sigh.
So. I need a little help. I can guarantee that not even one person is still reading this story, but I'm taking all the chances I can get.
Draco, who was standing beside Pansy, nearly fell over when he heard the words being said. Pansy looked around, in search of Hermione, who was too astonished herself to be thinking of anything.
“Bloody Hell!” Ron exclaimed. “That’s… that’s unimaginable!”
“You think
“Thanks again for letting me stay with you for the summer,” he smiled softly, squeezing their hands then letting go, turning to look outside the window. They were already on their way back to Hogwarts. Over the summer, Harry, Ron and Hermione all started to learn WSL, which was Wizarding Sign Language. With a bit of research Hermione learned that it was almost the same as British sign language, only with extra signs for Wizard terms.
“...well, if you really feel that way, then I’m sorry. Tell me if I’m overstepping again,” she said, her frown helping Harry understand that she actually did feel quite sorry. “Let’s go. Last lesson before the holidays, huh?”
“I saw you fainting. I saw as you fell down, as you were escorted to the hospital wing, how you were out for a week. You… how could you even do that to yourself? Do you have any idea how worried everyone was? Especially me, because I had no way of finding out how you were.”
“It sounds awful,” Pansy admitted, putting an arm around his shoulder. “But give it time. Do you have any idea how genuinely happy you’ve been the past two months? Don’t let go of him so easily.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks, you too,” Draco murmured. As Harry had been checking out Draco, he was doing the same to Harry. He was studying his beautiful green eyes and his messy brown hair and his cute nose and his glasses and his scar that he always liked to hide behind his hair.
“Or were you trying to stop him from insulting Harry?” Pansy asked.
“What? I didn’t say that. I just- um--” he cleared his throat awkwardly, standing up and dumping the book inside his book bag. “Shut up, Pansy. You know I don’t believe that stupid Gryffindork. Now let’s go for breakfast.”
“A necklace of
“It’s fine,” Draco said, folding his arms and holding his chin up. Seeing Harry’s face now made him less worried and more irritated. “It’s only been an hour. Guess it would’ve killed you to owl me or something.”
“That’s good, that’s good… well, as long as you’re happy, we’re happy too, I hope you realize that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“When did you realize you had feelings for him?”
Looking around, he nodded slowly when he noticed Draco was nowhere in sight. After making sure everyone was gone, they both quickly slipped into a broom closet. “Um… why do you need to talk to me?” he asked finally. He couldn’t recall a time where he and Pansy had ever even spoken properly, but what he knew was that she wasn’t the type to insult or be rude to him.
“That’s the thing. Why would I take him back like that? Is that all my purpose is, waiting for him to come back to me? Mind you,
“No,” Draco firmly said this time, sitting up properly. “Leave it. Don’t involve yourself with him. He… all he does is cause trouble wherever he goes.”
“Leaving without saying goodbye?”
He shook his head, turning his attention back to the fireplace. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. Much to their surprise, he spoke. “Yes,” he sighed, craning his head to look at them, “but I don’t want to talk about it. Okay?"
“Your father,” admitted Narcissa, sighing. “But he does have your best interest at heart.”
Harry was too busy staring down at his hands to lip-read, helping him sign out the phrase. “Don’t get it confused with ‘I need help’. That goes in the opposite direction, like this,” he said, pulling Draco’s hands towards him. “Did that help?”
“Seems like all you are is worried about me,” he muttered. “Seriously, I’m alright.”
Harry opened the door.
“What the hell, Scarface? Come back here and hold me, I’m cold.”
Snape came into view. “...Twenty points from Gryffindor and ten from Slytherin. Now go get cleaned up before I give you detention,” he said, giving them both a deathly stare. The two quickly nodded and left for the bathroom in silence.
He swung open the door, shook his head, and muttered, “I don’t like your hair gelled back.”
Each morning, he’d promise to confront his feelings, maybe consider going back to Britain, but every night, he’d find himself in a random club. Searching for silver eyes. Searching for the smile that made his insides turn, searching for the touch that made him feel safe, that made him feel at home. But he knew he was far away from home.
“Shut up, your gelled hair reminds me of your father,” Harry rolled his eyes. “What if I accidentally called you Lucius?”
Of course, Draco knew where Harry would go. That’s why he wasn’t able to find him. More so, he didn’t put in much effort to find him. He went to general places where Harry would usually hang out.
“That’s fine for us,” he waved his hand, then blinked. “Oh. For Harry…”
“You don’t know the half of it,” Harry muttered. He turned back to his bed, grabbing his wand and turning to leave.
“No need to be, I’m a-okay,” Harry told her sarcastically, clutching his left arm.
Hogwarts without Harry Potter. Well, that’d be a new one.
? You’re telling me my soulmate is a
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nothing, just… you should eat. You didn’t eat dinner last night either,” Ron said, using one hand to eat and the other to sign. Harry nodded, picking up the toast on his plate, taking his time.
“Get out,” Draco demanded. The tears were still falling down his face, the hand he was holding his wand with shaking.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, eyes widening slightly. “I…”
Harry set down his quill, looking at him. “Oh. Well, I hadn’t thought that through whatsoever,” he rolled up his sleeves. “Maybe… the day we got back together? I guess?”
So many kudos already?? Thank you so much!!
“Prick.”
“Oh Merlin, I have feelings for…” Harry didn’t finish his sentence which frustrated Hermione deeply; not knowing who his secret girlfriend was annoyed him. “Sorry, ‘Mione, I think it’s best if I keep her identity secret for a while.”
“You have a girlfriend, don’t you?” Pansy asked, running a hand through her hair, seeming rather amused. “Where else have you been going the past few Fridays? Gone before I can even notice.”
“Harry-”
“Out of everything I said
“For the last time, do you think
“Well… it’s not like we actually were in a serious relationship - I mean, to others, yes, but… well, you know. Besides, I’m not going to stand in the way of you and the person you really love.”
“Yes, Harry, I’m a part-time construction worker. I go and construct buildings for the Muggles.” Draco answered sarcastically, receiving a smack from Harry. “I just have some school work that I’m behind on.”
“Just wait.” Harry took out concealer and started dabbing over it with a makeup sponge. After about five minutes, Draco’s Dark Mark had vanished.
“Not everything is about you!” Draco shouted suddenly, clenching his fists in anger.
Harry wasn’t exactly a lightweight, but he wasn’t a heavyweight either. He was quite somewhere in the middle; which was probably why after chugging down the bottle and drinking another one had perhaps made him drunk.
him this. That I didn’t want to be in a situation where I had to choose. But here I am, like some bloody idiot, wishing that I was with him, but I’m too much of a coward to actually do it.”
As they left, Ginny deciding to tag along, Harry chewed on the inside of his lip nervously, fiddling with the piece of paper in his pocket. “You okay?” Ginny said as she tugged on his sweater gently. Hermione and Ron were bickering again, and Harry wasn’t too bothered trying to lip read their conversation.
“You can understand me, right?” she asked, making sure to enunciate. Harry nodded, and she smiled. “Right, so… Draco wants to see you. At six.”
“Well, of course, but shut up! I spent most of sixth year being the one under the cloak!” Harry protested, and Draco rolled his eyes at him.
Draco stared at him for a few moments, licking his lips nervously. “...really?”
“Really? I’ve always been here.” Harry said, referring to the fact that Ginny could have talked to him any time.
He tried not to think of the other options. Like - maybe Harry was mad at him, or maybe he was cutting him off. Or… worse. He could be hurt or in danger. With every waking moment, the regret of making an absurd deal with Harry only grew. How could Draco
“Like what?”
“I’m aware.” replied Draco in a blank tone.
********
“No one in particular,” Harry shrugged. “I’m just… confused.”
Till next time! <3
“He’s right,” Ron chimed in, who had just joined them as they left the Gryffindor Common Room.
“Draco, are you sure there’s nothing you want to tell me?”
Harry didn’t know what to think of that. Was it a good thing that she was asking? Or was she asking because she was scared of him? Harry continued to stare as he watched the girl’s parents looking over at him, and saying something inaudible. The girl had turned and she was now staring at Harry.
On a Saturday evening, Harry walked into the Common Room, surprised to hear music and everyone in the room, in separate groups, talking. Hermione quickly approached Harry, noticing how confused he looked.
“Ah, come on, mate, it’s fun.” Ron insisted. Harry took the bottle and spun it very fast, hoping and praying it wouldn’t land on Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be staring at Harry very intently as he stared at the bottle spinning and spinning until it finally came to a stop.
“It’s okay to take a break for yourself,” Draco said, sitting down on the seat beside him. “You’ve been through a lot the past couple of years; a lot more than anyone should in their lifetime.”
"Harry, can you tell me with all honesty that you wouldn’t have endured through all the pain to be with him, to the point where you get seriously injured?”
Harry nodded. “I understand. I just wanted to apologize. I know that… I was stupid. So… I’ll see you around, I guess,” he said, then moved towards the door. Draco was stunned - maybe it was the hope or delusion that they would actually be able to be together again, but no. Harry still didn’t trust him fully, and Draco didn’t want to be the only one trying in their relationship.
“Sure,” he replied, looking over to Draco, who was smiling at Astoria. It was so easy to forget he was married when it felt like they were the only two people in the world. He had to push it away. They got to the kitchen where Molly was arguing with Ginny about cupcakes. They took the things out of the bag.
benefits to dating me other than money.”
“Harry,” Ron said, shaking Harry awake. “It’s midnight! What the hell are you doing?”
asked for one month, and then you changed your mind?”
“I just said, that’s interesting,” Hermione said. “Look, Harry, it’s really obvious that Draco isn’t-”
Oh, also, thank you so much for 100 kudos!!
It was a bright, peaceful spring Sunday afternoon. The days were now longer but the nights were harder. Astoria had moved into Malfoy Manor, but would sleep in her ‘study’ which had a twin bed and a desk to work on. Lucius did not question it. It seemed now that the marriage was sealed, he had no problem with the obvious fact that Astoria and Draco did not love each other.
“Hmm?” He looked up, just in time to see Harry quickly leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek, ruffling his hair. Draco rolled his eyes, but looked at himself in the mirror, and made no attempt to fix the mess Harry had made to his hair.
Draco kept his eyes on Harry, frowning. He took in a deep breath, then finally opened his mouth. “I thought it over,” he said slowly. “My feelings. You. My family. The Dark Lord.”
“And why, exactly?” She asked with a raised eyebrow. Harry pushed his hair back to reveal a few strands of his roots greyish-white. She rolled her eyes. “That’s completely normal. It’ll probably just wash out, it could be paint or something of that sort.”
“I think you should come. You haven’t been out of the castle in weeks,” he stated outrageously. “You need to clear your head.”
“I probably will, you know. When I’m telling him about how dorky you are.”
After the last song finished, they both fell back onto the bed, breathing heavily. “Honestly, this is not what I planned to be doing at two in the morning, Harry,” Draco huffed, tugging at the collar of his sweater.
“Boyfriend,” Harry echoed, almost as if he couldn’t believe it. “Really?”
Harry’s heart plummeted down to his stomach. Was kissing Draco a deep mistake?
“I swear you guys just eye-fucked,” Pansy whispered and Draco let out a snort. He was in too good of a mood to even get annoyed by her. She had been able to tell something had happened as soon as he entered the Slytherin Common Room the night before. She asked him what happened and Draco, too flustered to lie, came clean. “You two are like star-crossed lovers.”
Harry nodded again, unsure of what to say. “It went… better than I expected. I thought it would be awkward, but… what can I say? It’s never awkward with him. We always find something to talk about, which is what I love… loved about him.”
“You… used to make a specific face when your scar started hurting. Besides, I don’t think a headache has ever been that painful to you before.”
“Something funny with my teaching, Mr. Potter?” Snape asked, coming into Harry’s view. “You’re already behind due to your… disability. I wouldn’t want you to be further set back by Mr. Weasley here.”
Draco put a finger to his lips, kissing him gently, as if to tell him to relax. Harry kissed him back, then huffed. “Fine. I’ll keep it on for five more minutes,” he gave in, wrapping his arms around the other. The fact that he couldn’t see where they were going made him more nervous, but he decided to put his faith into Draco’s riding skills.
“You know, you become a little more like Hermione every time I see you,” Draco commented, dodging a smack from Ron, entering the room. Harry walked back to the bed while Draco stayed by the door after he shut it behind him.
finally, a new chapter! it's been forever!
His mouth dry, Draco looked back up at the ceiling, the corner of his lips twitching. “Sometimes our hands touch and it feels like an electric shock,” he mumbled. “And today he was looking over my shoulder… his body was pressed against mine. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.”
The nights grew colder as the days became longer. Each minute that passed was a minute closer to the wedding. Draco would lie awake at night, staring at the God-awful engagement photo that was framed and perfectly placed on his bedside table.
Sometimes Harry found himself questioning if he really deserved a second chance with Draco. But, it was different when you loved someone. You always wanted to see the best in them. And Draco loved Harry.
“We’re living together… we have a small dog… and… Draco’s making me pancakes.” Harry chuckled drowsily. “He sucks at making pancakes… but it’s fine. I pretend that I like them. Then… we go out for dinner and I propose… and I’m finally…”
“I was here five minutes early.”
They got off the carriages and were led inside the castle.
Draco and Harry both took a few steps back from the cauldron, then turned to look at each other. The potion was still somewhat of a light green slime and now it was on their faces. There were a few quiet snickers. Harry quickly looked away, trying to hide his smile.
“No need to thank me, Harry,” said Pansy, smiling at him before taking in a deep breath.
“Oh? Uh… Harry, I’m a little bus-”
“I’m going,” he stood up, and Pansy burst into laughter, grabbing his hand, pulling him back down. He stared down at the WSL book in his hands, then looked back up at her. “Can you tell me something?”
“But I want to tell him to meet me now before he makes plans.”
“Draco, it’s okay. Maybe you two need to talk it out,” Pansy was saying. “I’m not sure if ending your relationship with Harry with a
(See the end of the chapter for
At that exact moment, Hermione and Pansy went running to Harry. Pansy immediately helped Harry up, with help from Hermione.
Draco sat up suddenly, making Narcissa almost jump out of her skin. “You’re right! Oh, you’re so right!” he stared into space for a few seconds, grinning, then looking back up at his mother. “I need your help.”
“Well, then you must get on and do it,” Dumbledore said in response.
“So… can we finally move past this awkward stage?” Draco asked, holding his hand out, trying to shake off the uncanny feeling of deja vu.
Harry jerked awake, his body sweating, as tears fell down his face, breathing heavily. Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair and wrapped his arms around him in an attempt to comfort him and calm him down.
Harry burst into laughter. “That’s the second time!”
And he did.
The two broke into a small smile as Harry went to stand right in front of him. “Do you need it? I reckon using your mother’s wand isn’t the same.”
“I love it. Thank you,” he leaned forward and kissed Draco on the cheek gently.
*******
I hope you guys like it! I think we can all guess what's going to happen in the next chapter... oof.
at Dumbledore. Harry moved to take off his Cloak, then realized he couldn’t move.
“Well… I just don’t want to be a homewrecker.”
“Not cool, mate,” Ron said as he watched Harry eat.
And when Harry woke up, Draco was gone, a letter left at Harry’s desk.
Draco finally turned to look back at Harry, his silver eyes gleaming with tears, screaming for help, frowning profusely. His eyes were screaming, shouting, for Harry to just
Harry was just about to add his tongue into the kiss, but suddenly, he heard footsteps.
“You did! You could have come to me! Draco, I told you I would have understood! Unless you actually want to kill him?”
Draco leaned forward and kissed him on the lips softly. “You’re a reckless idiot, you know that?”
Draco didn’t say anything. His eyes slid away from Harry’s, still feeling the other’s gaze on him as he bit his lip.
“What were you doing there, Harry?” Hermione asked, taking a sip from her drink.
“I know, Harry.”
“Oh, as if you’d be any better,” Harry replied. “You’d have died right at the beginning of the Forbidden Forest if it weren’t for me.”
“It’s just… after Sirius died…” Harry trailed off into silence. “No, nevermind.”
Harry slowly walked to the tree by the lake. It seemed like Draco wasn’t there yet. He awkwardly leaned against the tree. Hermione had picked out something for Harry to wear and although she wasn’t really that informed of what to wear during dates, Harry was grateful nonetheless.
“Has he woken up yet, at least?” Harry asked, his eyes moving to the direction where Draco was, hidden behind the curtains. His voice was filled with worry, his eyes glinting with guilt.
“Who would you go to, then? Viktor Krum?” he scoffed. Hermione glared at him, and Harry now looked back down at his work, shaking his head.
“Sure, what is it?”
“You are such a pain in the ass,” Draco scoffed.
“Potter,” Lucius Malfoy said as Harry entered, which made him almost jump out of his skin.
listen to our conversation in Charms?”
. And a token of love from me. You’re in the shower right now, so think of this as a gift… I love you so much, you know that? Too much, honestly. I even feel happy listening to you sing in the shower like you are right now. Well, anyway, this is how videos work, so… any time you want to see me and I can’t be there… here I am.”
That’s when the door slammed open. Harry, in an instant, knew exactly who it was.
“So,” Harry cleared his throat, sneaking glances at Draco. “Tomorrow is…”
Suddenly, they heard the doorknob twist.
“Harry Potter… is dead!” cried out Voldemort.
“Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah, that’s fine,” Harry stroked Draco’s hair.
