, because the silver absorbs what’s required,” Draco repeats, rolling his eyes. “Practically nobody uses the powdered silver because it’s more expensive than all the other ingredients put together.”
Back then, as he’d watched Potter stalk away, an apology on the tip of Draco’s tongue, he’d attributed the racing of his heart and the stirring of his cock to his humiliating, not to mention nugatory, crush on Potter.
--” he squeezes his prick under the head as Malfoy emits a garbled shout and starts to come all over his hand, “—until you fucking pass
Granger seems on the verge of giggling. “The head actually measures half the length of its body,” she says, pointing out with her forefinger again. “Your baby is no bigger than a kumquat right now,” she beams, “but he seems pretty happy in there, doesn’t he?” She turns, still smiling widely, to Potter, who is still just standing there, arms akimbo, lips turned inwards, jaw clenched and eyes over-bright.
Harry had barely just managed to kill the beast and send out a Patronus before collapsing, not daring to reach up and check his wound or stem the blood loss, and
“I’m not sulking, this is just my face.” Draco dumps the honey into the cauldron and stirs vigorously, the potion inside sloshing up the sides.
?” Potter inhales loudly, breathing in deeply for a long moment before emitting a soft, rolling growl that sends a shudder up Draco’s spine.
Some sort of stone structure surrounded them. Grey slabs of stone comprised towering walls around them forming a central courtyard of a kind. Crumbling archways gaped gloomily even though it was daylight, and solid, stone steps curved upstairs and out of sight. In the centre of the courtyard was a circular hole in the ground.
. “You’ve been up and about all day, cake and… everything,” he adds feebly, not bothering to hide the shiver that wracks through him.
“Please,” Draco pants, hips bucking uselessly as he tries to gain some kind of friction on his own cock. “Potter, please.”
Harry accidentally snaps the thin neck of his bottle and looks down in surprise before lazily placing the pieces aside and pushing his way into the surging, wildly moving crowd. It’s hot in here, despite the time of the year, and the press of so many bodies as well as the rising fury inside him, has Harry breaking out into an instant sweat.
He was strolling along behind that long, stiff-backed, pale form he’d become so accustomed to that he’d started to dream of Malfoy frequently – chasing after him, Malfoy floaty and oddly amorphous, always just out of reach, disappearing before Harry could get to him.
James didn’t answer at once, his face drawn and his chin soft as he simply stared at the jumper Harry held. Then, in a very low voice, he said, “I miss Mum.”
Fully hard by now, Draco sighs again and starts pulling in earnest, biting his lip to stem any involuntary moaning and bracing his free hand against the wet tiles. He doesn’t bother playing with himself or taking his time – he hasn’t in ages now – but just quickly pulls himself off with brisk, tight-gripped strokes, a little groan finally escaping him as he shoots out a string of precome, now nearly on the verge of his climax.
to finally relent to Potter’s incessant wheedling, promising himself that it was only because of the baby and that he’d go out and find a better place of his own soon enough.
And why did he always return Draco’s stares? Draco was staring at him because ... well, he had his reasons. But what was
“I spent about six consecutive years with you, Malfoy,” Potter points out, “and I never once noticed all
“Unfortunately and quite abstrusely,” Draco says under his breath, grumpily ignoring the butterflies in his stomach.
“Nor Pansy me,” Malfoy sighs. “It’s probably why she said she’s most certainly not going with me this year.”
“I spent all morning throwing up,” Malfoy replies distractedly as he peers into the en suite, eyes bulging at the sight of the, frankly, obscenely large claw-foot tub, scrubbed spotlessly white and gleaming.
Potter sniffles softly, giving Draco a tremulous little chuckle and throwing an arm around Granger’s shoulders. “Shut up,

Malfoy is trembling now, nails digging into the soft leather of the seat as he fucks himself on Harry’s fingers. “Th-that bint never
, under the table, glancing around furtively. Ron went purple in the face and let out a sound like a dying walrus as he slouched forward in his chair, clutching his leg with both hands.
,” Potter abruptly snarls through grit teeth, his voice muffled in Draco’s crease, and Draco whines as one, numb arse cheek is released.
“Master Harry is sending Kreacher to fetch Master Harry’s potion for him,” it croaks, and Draco blinks, realising only after several seconds that the elf is simply answering the question Draco asked it before the potion was delivered.
Devoid of the energy to rag him for it, Draco just sighs and looks around Potter’s room. The curtains are drawn haphazardly, and with the sun rising, there are broken shafts of deep vermillion light slanting into the room, dancing with clouds of dust motes. There’s a desk in a corner with several Auror case files strewn around on it, and a large, stuffed armchair by the window. The wardrobe on the other side of the room hangs slightly open and Draco can just about spot the sleeve of the set of black and gold dress robes Potter had worn to Paris on Draco’s birthday. There’s a chest of drawers next to the en suite and atop it are several framed photographs – Draco thinks he recognises a familiar bushy brown head as well as several heads of bright red.
It’s unnervingly quiet, Harry shuffling in quickly, looking around with his hand closed around his wand in his pocket as though he’s expecting to be jumped by a tome wielding old crackpot yelling ancient magical theories at him. There’s hardly anyone around though, just two witches poring over enormous, crumbling volumes at one of the tables, barely even glancing up at Harry as he hurries past, looking around desperately for that distinctive, bright head of white-gold.
Granger silences him with a loud sigh. “Harry’s an Alpha wolf,” she says bluntly, darting Potter another frown before dipping her quill into the inkpot and resuming her scribbling.
“What do you want me to say?” Malfoy laughed. Harry waited. Then, “I may be persuaded to do this again – though preferably never again in a fucking loo stall.”
One of the many things about Potter that Draco is fast beginning to...appreciate, is how earnestly caring he is. He
Clicking his tongue with the indulgent patience of familiarity, Draco let him press dry kisses into his hand before combing some of the hair out of his face. Cupping his cheek, he murmured a soft, “Get up, you stupid lump,” and tugged firmly as this time, Harry accepted his hand and hauled himself up to his feet.
, please—please don’t cry--” Draco sifts desperate fingers through Harry’s dirt-caked, blood streaked hair, “Ssshh. Don’t, just don’t do this to yourself, Harry.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry is just adding buttered toast to plates piled with rashers of crisp bacon, fried eggs browned around the edges, grilled mushrooms and tomatoes, when Malfoy walks in, biting his lip and glowering to himself as he takes a seat at the table without looking at Harry.
, you psychotic bastard?!” Potter hollers back, fingers plunging viciously. “Fucking-- satanic, shit-brained--”
It’s nothing like Draco imagined it would be – Draco doesn’t think he’s even capable of imagining something so formidably phenomenal, doesn’t think his mind can stretch that far. The way Harry fills Draco up, fills his whole being up, extends beyond just the physicality of Harry’s cock in Draco’s arse – Draco feels a fullness, an intangible sense of completion that brings about the realisation that he hadn’t even known until now, how incomplete he’d been all this while.
in his life, and that too with an ardent devotee who wasted no time in gushing about how spectacular you were.”
“We should,” Hermione agrees crisply, plucking up a quill and opening up a fresh folder, speedily filling out the patient details. “You’re twenty-six, yes?”
“Bedtime, I think,” said Harry. Malfoy nodded, getting to his feet and brushing crumbs off his clothes. Harry stood and crushed his empty beer can. Then he said, “Tomorrow, Malfoy, we start practicing.”
Now that I’m here, I want to head straight back home. Draco, Tristan, Parkinson and Zabini are all at the bar, waiting for the rest of us. I’d figured that if I turn up early, I can slip away in a couple of hours and keep Draco off my back for leaving too soon. But I’d forgotten the effect seeing him with Tristan has on me. It makes me halt in my tracks a few feet into the place and genuinely consider turning right back around and leaving.
“Well, fuck,” Draco drawls, promptly shifting his foot back there, “as someone who currently flies every
“No, why would I joke about going on a date?” He looks bewildered. “I actually like him, he’s nice.” Then he suddenly scowls. “And
gift now,” Draco spits, swiping his hair back roughly. “He’s going to wear them next week when he starts coaching the Harpies; did you know your sister can’t play for shit, Weasely?”
“We’re soulmates,” Harry mumbles glumly. “Or...like...perfectly matched for each other or something.” When Malfoy looks horrified, he hurries to add, “No! My cock is proof! My soft cock is proof, look at it!” He spreads his thighs out, pointing eagerly to his wonderfully soft cock.
, Draco suddenly thought back to their first kiss – hesitant, clumsy, and laced with Firewhiskey as they’d lounged by the fireplace in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed. He thought of the kiss after their ‘first fight’ – Draco had screamed at Harry about how he probably still thought of Draco as nothing but a Death Eater who’d gone scot-free; it had been a completely irrational bout of insecurity and Harry’s eyes had been wet as they’d later kissed with a nearly violent need to reassure, shivering in the cold as they’d stood pressed together in the snow behind one of the greenhouses.
“NO! Not my bathrobe!” Draco shouted, springing off the bed and nearly crumpling to the floor because his legs were like jelly from being relentlessly stimulated to the point of intense orgasm. “You filthy little beast!”
anything about it this time,” Draco interrupts calmly. “You probably will next time, if your innate tenacity and incurable Saviour Syndrome are anything to go by.”
“Of course. I’m going to be wherever you are.” A single tear slid down the side of his nose. Lily stared at it before reaching out and wiping it off.
than a foot away, completely still and unmoving as he stares unblinkingly at Draco, viridian gaze, unimpeded by glasses,
“It’s the same hair,” Draco says, swallowing hard. “It’s only my regular hair, Potter; I’ve just...braided it today.” Draco blushes even darker now for some reason.
Draco ends up with Harry’s cheek pressed to his chest and it happens so gradually that he doesn’t know how it happened. He holds Harry, cradling his head and shoulders with both arms and then finally giving in to the urge to let his mouth rest against the top of Harry’s head – he smells like wood smoke and grease and just...Harry.
Harry almost loses himself in the sight before himself. He kneels there on the rugs laid out, Draco’s thighs digging into his sides, his fingers being squeezed by the intense warmth of Draco’s body, the soft, breathless moans and sighs skating across his skin and making the hairs on his arms stand up – Harry doesn’t know when it had hit him so hard, but he was a gone man, and couldn’t remember the last time he’d been so blissfully, terrifyingly happy with his life.
“I like you and want to take you out to dinner, Malfoy,” he says softly – and then he takes Draco’s left hand between both his own.
And fuck, but the bastard got Draco going when he did that. Even if it did make something twist in his chest.
.” When Harry blinked at him he added, “You wouldn’t like it either, Potter. You wouldn’t like it at all.”
“If someone walks in right now, they’d see my bare arse,” Harry mutters, making Draco’s face split into a wide, crinkly grin.
Their voices fade out again as I discreetly look back around, trying to locate Draco and his ‘date’ before I realise they’ve disappeared completely.
He watched as Harry eased himself back in and did up his fly, leaving his shirt un-tucked. Draco made another sound of disapproval as, to add to his general unkempt appearance, Harry raised both hands and gave his hair a vigorous, completely unnecessary ruffle.
“Haven’t you ever just fucked someone and left it at that?” Draco asks aggressively. “Or do you propose to all your one-night-stands?”
. At least they’ve drained most of the pus out and he’s on anaesthetics so he’s not in pain.” Then she frowns, looking uncomfortable. “It’s...sweet of you to want to check up on him even though he...you know. He can’t talk with his mouth full of those boils, or whatever they are.” She shudders, “but I’m sure he doesn’t have much to say for himself, nonetheless.”
He goes to step around me and instinctively – involuntarily – my hand jumps as though to reach out and grab his. Draco notices and pauses, looking me right in the eye for a beat; just that one single beat where he’s looking at me, his jaw clenched, his eyes burning, his nostrils flared. My heart, already somewhere in my belly, sinks right down to my boots.
seems to have read it. Skeeter is ruthless in her slander, gleefully mocking their relationship, having dug up everything from Harry and Draco’s childish rivalry to the time Harry was taken captive and brought to Malfoy Manor during the War.
It starts one day with a single Stinging Hex to Draco’s back while he’s on his way to Herbology. The incident is waved away.
Harry is staring down at his cock – his cock that’s hanging limp and heavy between his slightly sticky thighs. At Malfoy’s sharp tone, he looks up, gaping at him in silence until Malfoy makes another sound of vexation.
His insides lurch violently and he can only stare with his lips parted as Potter slowly lowers and then gently drops Draco’s hand. He’s blushing too, but doesn’t seem ruffled or awkward about what he’d just done. The part where Potter’s warm, damp lips had touched Draco’s hand is all Draco can focus on as he ogles at him.
And for all the generosity of spirit that people associated him with, Harry Potter was a possessive bastard – and was utter shit at pretending otherwise. This one time Draco had sat next to a particularly handsome seventh year Slytherin during dinner (because, yes, Harry and he had had a fight that evening and Draco was nothing if not hurtfully petty), Harry had more than satisfied Draco’s passive aggressive need to see him completely
He dashed into the kitchen and paused for an enraged second to watch as Moody desperately tried to force the bunched up bathrobe into the narrow gap between the fridge and the wall. Leaping forward, Draco snatched up his bathrobe with a snarl, eyes bugging out as, for one unbelievable moment, the shrieking ferret hung off the robe, flailing and thrashing, before Draco violently shook him off. Falling to the floor on all fours, Moody paused only to call Draco a bastard in Ferret, before skidding away to his favourite haunt behind the fridge.
“Is this the...?” Potter holds up the vial and inspects it closely, his eyes crossing slightly as he peers at it. The vial is only about the length of his finger and slightly slimmer in girth, and for a moment Draco is worried Potter might end up inadvertently snapping the fine glass. “It’s not blue,” Potter finally comments, after inspecting the vial in silence for a long minute.
Deliberately, Draco walks forward, noting the wary apprehension that Potter eyes him with as he comes to stand before him, close enough that he can feel the warmth of his bare chest through the soft cotton of his pyjamas; close enough that he smell the rich, earthy scent of Potter’s skin.
“Ready?” he murmurs, and Draco just turns his face to land a biting kiss on his mouth in reply, squeezing Potter’s hips with his thighs in answer and winding his arms around his shoulders. Potter kisses him back, edges closer between Draco’s thighs and presses into him.
I’m tiddly myself and those words, perfectly innocent by themselves, make me choke a bit on my own saliva as I find the double meaning in them.
I nod again, smiling at him and hoping I don’t look deranged as I do. He smiles back. So I put my glass down again and lean in, kissing him on the mouth.
Draco’s stomach does a back-flip and he doesn’t care for this sort of hysterical, physiological reaction to Potter’s proximity – regardless of how good Potter smells and how his eyes crinkle up when he smiles, or how much time Draco spends thinking about him nowadays even when he isn’t around; regardless of the fact that these sessions with Potter, no matter how fruitless they’ve been so far, have been the highlight of Draco’s week.
“Well, had you not left in such a hurry,” Potter shrugs, taking one exaggerated step towards him, “I think we’d definitely have had another round – likely on a bed and likely lasting
He was also shirtless, clad only in joggers, and his hip bones distracted Draco long enough for Harry to pull his toothbrush out of his mouth to ask thickly through a mouthful of foam, “Wha’?”
He’s okay, I reason. He’d been very sincere in his apology when we’d gotten back in touch. And he’s not bad looking at all. He’s cute enough to attract the immediate attention of the bartender and I notice a trio of women whispering amongst themselves as they stare over at him.
Harry feels his face and neck heat slowly as he forces himself to talk. “Er... So, you know my boyfriend—?”
Potter’s arm shot out, sturdy fingers curling around Draco’s wrist, his grip unexpectedly strong. He sighed. “Sorry,” he said with a hint of a scowl still lingering about his face. And then, before Draco could reply, he called out to the barkeep who’d just appeared from the other side of the circular bar, “Hey, Martin? Can I have a neat whiskey, please? And another one of these?” He indicated to his empty pint.
Everyone is gathered under the shade of an enormous alder. I dismount and slowly near them; Tristan is stirring – not dead. Thank fucking god.
Potter looks rather astonished as he leans forward and places his forearms on the table, silently inviting Draco to continue. Draco fidgets slightly before going on, “It’s in my blood, Potter, and we’re a whole family of Veela.
Harry remained silent once more, willingly helping Malfoy stuff his hands into the sleeves of his thoroughly rumpled pyjama top and swiftly buttoning it up for him – the backs of his fingers brushed across the scars.
I fuck him right through it, letting go and joining him halfway through with my own climax, coming inside him, emptying myself inside him like I’ve dreamed of doing for weeks now. His arms are back around me now, clutching me around my neck, and he’s fighting for breath, gasping and panting, against my shoulder.
Outside, Draco lights a cigarette and leans back against the grotty brick. The acrid whiff of the smoke mingles with the foul stench of rotten potato peels, fresh urine and rat shit.
“Potter,” Draco says in a small voice, staring down at his own hands, “I’m sorry.” When he feels that penetrating, green gaze on him, he says, “For everything you know... For all those years of...” Unable to find a way to finish the sentence without spontaneously dying of embarrassment and shame, Draco just lets it hang between them pathetically.
Even Hermione dissolves into giggles at that, and Harry can do nothing but sip his tea and glare sullenly at the pair of them while the cushion in his lap dances with each twitch of his poor, hexed cock.
Before walking out any further, Harry scanned the skies, wand gripped tightly. He wondered if he even had the mental capacity to create a Patronus if need arose.
Helplessly, Draco twists again, Fox’s impatiently shouted tips bouncing right off his ears because all he can hear is the pounding of his own blood as it rushes down south, his cock now hard against his thigh and getting harder still, rising inexorably towards Potter’s hip.
“D’you want to take a vial of Dreamless?” Draco murmurs against his scar. Harry shakes his head with a little sigh, wrapping burly arms around his waist and keeling over sideways so Draco thumps down into bed with him, their legs entangling as their mouths seek each other blindly.
. I don’t need your help, period. I was merely being polite when I told you about this. I can do this by myself. And I was just being courteous when I agreed to this Healer’s appointment, Potter.”
?!” he asks, finally lowering the vial long enough to stare incredulously at Draco. “But it’s not the week leading up to the full moon. I start my course exactly seven days before—”
Their mouths moved wetly together; Harry's mouth tasted of sunshine and pumpkin juice. His face was cool from having the wind cut across it for so long and Draco’s fingers moved warmly over his cheeks, their lips curling into identical smiles of shy delight at the same time.
Harry feels a huge, freezing ball of fear settle in his throat. “What if it’d transformed?” he whispers, voice cracking.
babies. Not a lot of wizards possess the fortitude to take up the challenge as efficiently as you did.”
Malfoy is vibrating with gleefully wicked laughter beside him. “Yeees?” he sings. “Do finish that statement.”
Harry stared blankly at the spot on the floor where she had lain. Had she got up and walked out herself? He knew this to be impossible. He had seen people who had been Kissed; he’d had to when he’d been an Auror. They did nothing but blink and fall asleep by themselves. They were nothing but empty human shells.
now,” Draco snaps impatiently even as he tugs Harry closer, pushing his hands into Harry’s hair and tipping his head back, his breath clouding in bright white puffs.
Ron in Honeydukes was very akin to Hermione at Flourish and Blotts, and while Harry stood next to Malfoy and munched on a bar of something with nuts in it, Ron, as was customary, took a free sample of nearly every sweet on display and then decided to buy about three bulging bagfuls worth of candy. Hermione watched in resigned exasperation as Ron paid for it all, and Malfoy went and opened his mouth about how none of the sweets matched up even halfway to the chocolate
“Yes, we’re just a bunch of pretties who do nothing more than strut around, tossing their hair,” Draco interrupts loudly, “We’re all well aware of your opinions of us. Let me just clarify that my opinion of
“Fuck.” He scowls, scratching his head where the sofa cushions have flattened his hair. “I’m officially out of ideas again.”
Jerking his head back with an irritated scowl, Malfoy hisses, “Did you lose your way up to the DMLE?”
Draco, meanwhile, is hovering around in a zone he doesn’t ever want to leave. His orgasm looms, probably only seconds away, promising and inescapable, his back aching from the incessant, almost imperceptible tremors zinging up and down the length of his spine.
“You did always clean up well, yourself,” Draco replies. Harry gives him another lopsided grin and steps closer. “You look good too,” he adds quietly as Harry takes his hand in one of his own and slides the other around to Draco’s lower back.
“Harry, I’m sorry for everything you’ve been through, I am, but none of that is even pertinent to you finding someone to fall in love with,” Hermione says flatly all in one breath. “I know this hex has left you in a mess, but you can’t just sit here feeling hopeless and sorry for yourself. Of course you’re not going to find someone perfectly suited for you just after...what, you’ve been on three dates so far? I’m sorry none of those men were it for you, but I’m also pretty sure you didn’t
“No, I don’t want a fucking cushion,” Draco says gruffly, wrapping one hand around Potter’s heavy cock and using his other hand to press Potter’s thighs even wider apart. “You keep your fucking cushions, Potter.”
Looking curious more than excited, Potter obeys, stretching out on top of Draco and immediately kissing him again, the stag pendant pressing bluntly into Draco’s chest. There’s a wet spot in Potter’s boxers where his erection is seeping, but he seems most content to simply rut against Draco’s own renewed boner.
“Harry!” Draco let out a startled yelp as a hand suddenly closed around his ankle and lifted his shoe-clad foot onto one sturdy shoulder. “Merlin, warn me, dammit.” He whined in disappointment when his cock was abandoned rudely, Harry moving down to catch Draco’s balls in his mouth for a quick suckle before he moved his mouth lower, so he could nibble at his arsehole again. “I was
But Draco has launched himself at Potter, crashing into him hard enough to send him slamming back into the pillows with a grunt, their mouths meeting in something resembling a kiss, teeth clacking, tongues jabbing. Without lifting his lips off Potter’s, Draco kicks off his pyjamas, wrestles Potter’s jeans down his thighs, and lines up their cocks together so he can wrap one hand around them.
Potter smiles wryly. “Can’t you imagine what the common consensus would’ve been had I, Merlin forbid, not caught the Snitch? Even for
“Thought or hoped?” Harry murmurs, now stringing kisses up Draco’s jaw, hands working his arse in a steady massage.
There was a crack like a gunshot. The boys screamed something out. The dementor holding Lily immediately began backing away. Footsteps charged on the floorboards behind him and the next second, someone sailed over Harry’s head, jumping right over him.
I’ll hex your teeth into marshmallows!” Draco threatened, even as arousal spread outwards from the sting that Harry was now lovingly easing away with his tongue, chuckling at Draco’s outburst. “Please,” he added, shivering as hot breath puffed over his crack.
Draco, I’ve come to learn, is very quiet when we touch. Any sound that he makes has always seemed involuntary or inadvertent. That one time we’d ground together and come in our pants, he’d pressed his mouth into my shoulder and shuddered in silence as he’d come. When we kiss and I touch him, run my hands over him, he pants quietly against my mouth, against my cheek, but never makes a sound.
“You stole the words right out of my rather talented mouth.” He smirks as I huff exasperatedly. “It’s been four fucking months – move the fuck
With a small, strangely heart-rending sound, Malfoy thrashed again, lifting his legs to rest his feet on Harry’s shoulders, his chest heaving. And then, “What are we
Harry’s hands on his hips tightened and he ran a careful tongue along Draco’s own, the velvety slide making them both shiver. Tilting his head to further deepen the kiss, Draco made a sound of irritation when Harry abruptly pulled away.
Harry springs to his feet, reaching for Malfoy with both hands, shaking his head with a croaked laugh. “No, Malfoy, listen, let me explain--!”
Malfoy takes it from him but doesn’t make to pull his hair back again, leaving his hair draped in a scraggly mess around his face, the ends just about grazing his shoulders. They both simply stare at Hermione who’s glaring exasperatedly at them both as she walks in and takes her seat behind her desk, arranging the files and bottles before her.
“Malfoy,” Potter says airily and with a deceptively sweet smile, “what if you weren’t pregnant and I’d offered to help? Offered to let you move in? Would you have accepted? How many owls would I’ve had to have sent before you’d agreed to let me help? Be honest.”
Once inside, the smell is even worse and Draco lifts one gloved hand up to his face, clamping it lightly over his nose and mouth. He glances around and sees several large portraits, all of them hung shut with thick lengths of black velvet. There are about three candles sputtering on three different brass, snake shaped sconces on the wall, which is in turn covered in grubby, Victorian style wallpaper in deep green and silver.
“I just told you,” Potter replies gently, serving up eggs and sausages onto both plates. “I’m making breakfast. Thought I’d bring it to you in bed but you’re up now, so...” he shrugs, “’s good. Sit down,” he adds, pointing to the little breakfast table near the window.
When Draco turns, Potter is standing there with his hands casually stuffed into his pockets; his chin high in the air as he stares flatly down his nose at Draco, jaw bunched tight, his whole form seeming to crackle with barely suppressed, white-hot fury, the badly masked ferocity in his expression making Draco erupt in gooseflesh.
“What do you think?” Harry deadpans, grinding his still-hard cock against him. “We’ll pick up some roses on the way if you like. You can shred them up and toss them all over the place while I eat you out and fuck you again.”
Harry doesn’t simply hold him as they clumsily move together, both of them slightly unsteady on their feet. Instead, he grips Malfoy with possessive, bruising fingers, elbowing away anyone who happens to step into their space. He keeps his gaze steady on Malfoy’s, both of them panting lightly through their mouths, eyes keen and sharp on each other.
“Annoying bastard,” he mutters once he’s successfully pushed me away, looking around furtively before pulling out his wand.
“I ...” Draco said, voice quavering. “I mean ...” He turned to see Blaise, Pansy and Goyle staring avidly over at them, looking like they wanted to start flinging hexes. Draco shook his head minutely at them and then turned back around. “Fine,” he said, ensuring that he had his nose very high in the air. “I suppose I could grace Potter with my presence for a drink, why not.”
“Whatever,” Draco said, sniffing and strutting over to his wardrobe, opening it and staring blankly at the contents, very much aware of his halfie and mentally cursing Harry.
to openly investigate the matter,” Draco says, voice icy and low. “He told everybody that the boy died of dragon pox and then proceeded to lock our Veela ancestry in archaic blood magic. The following generations all had their Veela genes repressed so they – we – simply appeared to be,” he smirks slightly, albeit with a modest tilt of his head, “just slightly above average in the looks department.”
I pull away just in time and sneeze violently into the crook of one arm, once, twice, thrice, until Malfoy is shaking with laughter, his head thumping back onto the wood as he clutches his stomach.
,” he grits out and Granger looks a little confused as she looks up. Draco doesn’t have the stomach to look at Potter. “I’m—I’m
“And you decided that the best way to comfort me would be to boss me around in bed?” There’s a slight grin to Harry’s voice and Draco feels his face heat.
... “We’re proud to say that we make the best battery operated torches, available in a variety of different sizes--”
“Hello, Scorpius,” said Harry, smiling. “Did you sleep all right?” When Scorpius nodded, Harry added, “How do you like your porridge? My kids like treacle in it. Lily likes raisins mixed into hers.” As he talked he pulled out another bowl and a small packet of raisins.
“We’re definitely more equipped to handle wizard-pregnancies now,” Hermione says soothingly. “Malfoy’s going to be alright. I told you, we’ll figure this out. What time did you ask him to be here anyway?”
Snorting under his breath, Harry obligingly Vanishes the contents of the chipped, blue mug, his eyes straying to the books around it; it’s a mixed jumble of Muggle and magical literature, worn hardbounds and dog-eared paperbacks, and Harry’s gaze slides over them unseeingly until a brand new, pristinely white book catches his eye, the front cover bearing a cherubic little baby with a gummy grin and bright blue eyes.
Long, dreamy minutes later, he’s whimpering as Harry sucks furiously at his rim, jiggling his head vigorously as he loosens the ring of muscle, nipping and licking at it so that Draco grinds down helplessly, seeking more and more of the exquisite assault. Low rumbles sound from Harry, his hands as gentle on Draco’s arse cheeks as his mouth is ruthless on his hole.
The memory of Draco lying there like that, bruised and broken, with that air of resigned acceptance, makes Harry clutch at him tighter now, kiss him harder. Draco responds at once, his breathing stuffy and laboured even as he opens his mouth wider under Harry’s, kissing him back with eager fervour.
, Malfoy, and I’ve hardly been discreet about it.” Potter pauses then, rubbing one eye tiredly, appearing not to notice Draco blushing as he just stands there. “I didn’t mean to...I dunno, be so rough,” Potter finally continues, sighing again. “To hurt you.”
Pulling his thumb free, Harry simply flips him over matter-of-factly, pushing Draco’s thighs wide open, pressing his knees to his chest. There’s a twinge of pain along his thighs as Harry repositions him and Draco wants to tell Harry that he’s not quite as malleable as he once was, but Harry is running ardent fingers over the scar on Draco’s soft belly, lowering his head to lick into his navel and then abruptly pull Draco’s cock into his mouth.
Draco keeps his eyes shut, his chest tight and painful as he tries to breathe in fully. He’s so close to what he knows is going to be a completely devastating orgasm that he’s teetering on the edge of consciousness just from the anticipation. His arse aches exquisitely around Potter, convulsing pathetically as though trying to force him back out. His own cock pressed flat along the curve of his belly under Potter and
The stairs led them into a wide, stone passageway. There were torches bearing bright bluish-green flames already mounted to the sconces on the wall. Outside, thunder rumbled.
“So, we get to take full credit?” Draco laughs. “Brilliant. Maybe we can blackmail them into naming their children after us.”
Draco simply nods, licking his lips and spreading his legs as Potter reaches down and prods at his arsehole, slicking up the tight furl thoroughly before he starts edging a finger in. And as he slips in the first finger, Potter chooses to look up, gaze burning into Draco’s as he works his finger in and out, and just
“Me,” Draco says crisply, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist and locking his ankles. “Fuck me again, Potter. You have months of catching up to do, you lazy bastard.”
“We’ve done...stuff,” I force out eventually. “And it was great, really. I’m—I’m talking about...going all the way.”
He’s busy licking around his lips when Potter startles him by swiping a thumb across his cheek, wiping away the salty tracks there. He runs it over Draco’s lips and along his jaw and fiddles clumsily with one earlobe.
,” Draco says, shooting him a grin over his shoulder as he drags Scorpius out for a bit before bending down to hook his free arm around his midriff and carrying him, giggling madly, to the bathroom.
Hermione closes a hand over mine. “Are you...not sexually attracted to him, Harry?” she asks gently.
Neither spoke again for a few seconds until Malfoy asked, in a very small voice, “Are you going to tell people about my job, Potter?”
It proves unnecessary though because then Ron says loudly, “Oi, mate! Ginny nicked the Snitch from her last match. Want to fly a game or two?”
And then, over Malfoy’s thin shoulder appeared a small, round, cherubic little face. Wide grey eyes stared right at Harry and the child’s mouth was hanging open in clear awe.
Harry gathered up their luggage, a slightly livelier Lily, and called to James and Albus who were peering into the well in the centre of the courtyard.
Harry snorts into the kiss and Draco makes a sound of annoyance, pulling away with a scowl. “That’s disgusting,” he declares, before turning to glare at Ron. “Stop saying shit like that, Weasel. We were
“Yeah?” Potter pants, eagerly lifting his head and nudging his glasses higher up with his free hand. “You all right, Malfoy?”
mine, right?” Harry asks, swallowing past the dryness in his throat, feeling awfully guilty even asking out loud.
“I won’t be held responsible for anything I might say to Weasley,” Draco informs him, releasing his face and rubbing his knuckles over the dark, scratchy stubble there.
Atop the table, a two litre bottle of pumpkin juice lay on its side, its contents spread across the round expanse of teak, dripping off the edge at various points. The
“Ron, don’t be a baby,” she says not unkindly before turning to me once more. “And what are you on about? Of course it matters. It’s rather wonderful, actually.”
It felt like an appropriate moment to say it, so Harry said, “You know I’m genuinely grateful to you, right? Really. Last night...and...earlier today at Godric’s Hollow...”
“No!” Harry almost shouts, scrambling to his feet and taking a step towards him, stopping dead when Malfoy’s eyes flash warningly. “Malfoy, you’re misunderst—”
“Why don’t you sit down, Malfoy?” Hermione offers kindly. “I just have a few questions and then we can move on to the physical examination.”
“So, you’re really doing this, then?” Draco nods to the general mess on the counter. “You’re actually baking his cake yourself?”
Harry doesn’t bother reading the article although he does spend a full ten minutes staring at Malfoy’s unreadable expression in the moving picture while his bandaged arm tingles and throbs.
“You’re a hell of a partner,” Harry admits, just as softly. “We’re not known as the best team that the DMLE has for nothing.”
He leaned back until his shoulders rested against the wall, instinctively tightening his thighs around Harry’s hips in a grip that was probably far from comfortable for him. But Harry simply pinned him with that steady, scorching green gaze and fucked up into him with enough force to leave Draco gasping for air. His cock slapped against his belly, neglected by both of them, and Draco couldn’t even bring himself to reach for it.
Without even thinking about it Draco picked up the delicate silver vase on the set of drawers near the door and hurled it at the ferret with a bellow of anger. Moody easily ducked away, the vase hitting the pillow and rolling off to drop to the floor with a dull clang. Moody hopped off the bed and darted into the en suite, hopping up onto the counter to crouch at the sink and drink out the tap. Immediately running in after him, Draco grabbed him with both hands and lifted his arms to fling him out of the bathroom, but the ferret beat him to it and simply wriggled out of his grasp and leapt down, scampering out of the bedroom and pausing only to grab the robes Draco had just taken off and left in a pool near the door.
Potter tilts his head back with a deep exhale, looking pensive and calm. “It was...similar to shaking off the Imperius, I guess.” When Draco just blinks at him he adds, “Well,
Potter blushes but is barely able to hold back a smile. “Shut up, Malfoy,” he replies just as lightly, nudging a present wrapped elaborately in bright gold paper and dancing ribbons that’s sitting beside Draco’s plate – upon which sit two crisp, perfectly golden, enormously puffed
“Fuck you, you fucking bastard,” Draco snarls and whips his hips even harder, sending the frame of the bed crashing into the wall. Potter emits soft, croaked sounds of pleasure, his head tipped back, the pendant around his neck swinging wildly. Draco reaches up and snags a hand in Potter’s hair, dragging his head further back, and making Potter scream.
Ron must have said something amusing then because everybody is suddenly laughing. I hurriedly chortle along and look down into my beer mug – I don’t remember having downed quite so much of it already – so I don’t have to look at the way Draco rests his chin on Tristan’s shoulder as he says something into his ear.
“Yes, because I’m also permanently hungry,” Malfoy drawls, sounding rather morose. “I’m always ready to eat.”
He’s wearing striped, soft looking pyjama bottoms and the same jumper he’d worn the night he’d offered to teach Draco. His hair is pillow-mussed and his face a bit pale and he sits hunched over with his back to Draco.
“Don’t—” Potter starts but Draco has already chucked his wand across the room. It bounces off the wall and clatters across the floor. “Yes, because a broken wand always produces a perfect Patronus,” Potter says wearily, picking it up and coming over. “Let’s just call it a day, hm?” His fingers are warm where he gently strokes Draco’s nape.
Draco doesn’t have a retort for that but it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters but for the fact that Harry is kissing him again. He trembles violently within the rigid bands of Harry’s arms around him and it’s not only because of the bitter breeze howling through the room.
His body was shutting down. His hand moved over the ground and found Lily’s tiny, frozen hand. On either side of him, Albus and James panted quietly, clutching at handfuls of his clothes. Harry slumped backwards as footsteps came closer, his head hitting the ground with a muffled thud.
, Granger,” he says, voice so low and dangerous that Hermione looks rather startled, flushing and spluttering for a moment as she shakes her head.
“Yeah,” Harry says gruffly, striding over and sitting down on the desk chair, hurriedly catching himself and his mug of tea when it wobbles precariously under him. Malfoy grins but hides it by sipping some tea. “Why are you living here, Malfoy?”
Harry swallows the saliva that floods his mouth just from looking at Draco’s pink, moistened lips. “You know,” Harry reaches out and tucks a strand of impossibly soft, pale golden hair behind Malfoy’s delicately rounded ear, “I don’t remember much of that night at all. Seamus slipped something into my drink when I was already sozzled,” he rolls his eyes when Malfoy smirks again, “and I suspect that contributed to me retaining almost
The elf looks at him much like the voice sounds. “Master Harry is being needing it for health purposes,” he answers politely anyway. “If young Master Black can be excusing Kreacher now?”
However, Potter simply opens his mouth, sticking his tongue out slightly so that the crown of Draco’s cock is resting on it and waits. Swivelling his hips, Draco shifts his cock around, so it slides up Potter’s cheek and then down his chin, before bringing it back to his tongue, gently tickling the ridge of his own cock against the velvety softness of Potter’s tongue.
“Yeah, because he’s a big, scary werewolf and would likely jump you if he didn’t properly reign himself in,” Octavia waves a careless hand, “Heightened sense of smell and everything – and you’re a
“Please don’t tell me you nicked this from the cursed trunk,” I say, examining the exquisitely beautiful pendant, the metal slightly coarse under my fingers. Draco clicks his tongue irritably.
Those warm, brown eyes, as identical to Ginny’s as Albus’ and Lily’s were to his own, were beseeching. He couldn’t find an argument that might make sense to James. He had hit the main and most important nail on the head with his first swing – if any one of them had been alone and in danger, Ginny would’ve fought tooth and nail to get to them.
As though reading Draco’s mind and spontaneously deciding to drive Draco further round the bend, Potter drags his hands down Draco’s bowed back and firmly grabs his arse, filling his hands with the round cheeks and lifting Draco to the tips of his toes with his grip, making him gasp around Potter’s tongue.
“No, I need to know that you’re okay,” Harry interrupts, lacing their fingers over his stomach again.
“Well, it’s just that he’s so incredibly rude,” he says. “And you have other friends. Better friends. He’s just superfluous in your life, if you ask me.” He shrugs and keeps walking at a brisk pace.
“Are you—are you okay?!” he managed to eventually ask, blinking around and then realising his glasses had slipped off his sweaty nose. “Malfoy, did I--?”
Potter nods thoughtfully, taking a bite of toast. “Yeah,” he says, voice muffled as he sprays crumbs across the table, “I used to let the team gain a head start of at least ten goals before I looked for the Snitch in earnest; used that time to watch the opponent Seeker and note flight patterns and stuff.”
Draco goes scarlet right to the roots of his hair and tips of his ears. The rigid line of his mouth quivers a bit and then he bites the corner of his lip.
“Anyone else want anything?” I ask not really waiting for an answer and turning around to head to the bar.
“Fuck,” Malfoy wheezes, “Potter, fuck.” He’s wiggling and rutting, one foot now and then kicking at the ground as he slips down a little before being unceremoniously hauled higher by Harry.
ful!” Malfoy grumbled, stumbling along next to Harry. “Look, seriously, it was really nice of you to invite me and all, but I think it’s best if I just head back up.”
“So close,” Malfoy whimpers, winding an arm beneath himself; his shoulder bounces as he starts wanking himself and Harry leans his weight on his knees, lifts his free hand from where it was braced on the jolting bed and yanks at Malfoy’s hair, wrapping the strands around his knuckles and tugging his head back.
“Don’t look right away,” Harry mutters out the corner of his mouth, “but there’s a mermaid over there
Malfoy into the flimsy plywood door, wringing helpless cries and shameless demands out of him, until they’d both shuddered with orgasm and Harry had spilled into him for so
A fleeting moment of bewilderment and then Potter bursts out laughing, face lighting up at the memory. “You were a right arse back then, Malfoy, don’t you deny it,” he says, smiling widely and Draco rolls his eyes as he feels his own mouth twitch.
Ginny screamed something and Harry looked around. Albus was cowering, crouched over with his head in his arms, half-hidden behind the curtains. James was standing in front of him as two dementors sailed towards them. James’ face was tear streaked but his brown eyes blazed with something fierce.
“Yes, actually,” Harry says irritably, “This building looks like it might crumble in on itself any bloody second. There’s some sort of renovation going on across the hall and it’s incomplete and bound to get even messier soon. You’re too close to Knocturn Alley and I don’t even want to think about the sort of crowds that frequent it and the front door downstairs is
“Want to dirty my mouth up some more, Potter?” Draco murmurs inhaling into the thatch of curls above his straining cock. “Want to come down my throat?”
“Well, now you’ve got me all hot for you, Weasley.” Draco drains his fifth drink of the night, spins his glass onto the bar and very purposefully marches around Seamus and Dean. Before the poor idiot knows what’s happening, he grabs Ron’s face to place a very wet kiss on his mouth.
“That will get better now, Potter,” Draco promises gently, rounding the coffee table and taking two tentative steps closer to him. “This new potion will help. Taking a dose of this size every day, as opposed to a larger dose for just seven days, will help steady your core system, will help your human side stay stronger.”
, doesn’t he? Do you suck his cock every time he flips his hair at you?” Harry guffaws loudly and throws her off. “Have you written over all your money to his greedy arse yet?” she asks on a throaty giggle.
Harry tried, immediately obliging Malfoy, trying to push deeper into the unforgiving heat of Malfoy’s arse, the incredible tightness. But Malfoy shook his head vigorously.
“Tell me what you want,” Harry breathes, finally drawing away long enough to be able to talk. “Tell me how you want to—tell me what you want.”
Harry rested his forehead on Malfoy’s sternum, tightened his grip around his cock until the head was nearly purple, and rutted forward determinedly.
want to be gifted with?” Malfoy blinks up at Harry, glasses suspended halfway up to his face. “You know, if... If you had—had a boyfriend and he wanted to give you something...what would you like?”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice is firm and I sigh, placing my beer next to the bowl of crisps and leaning back on the sofa, pushing my glasses up onto my forehead and rubbing at my face vigorously. I can feel the beginnings of another headache. “You’re going to have to talk to us about this at some point,” she says bluntly and I drop my hands to glare at her.
Over and over Harry stabbed that tongue in and out of him, easing up a little only when he deemed Draco’s arsehole sufficiently pliant, after which he closed his lips over it and started to suck, noisily and with an embarrassing lack of shame.
Malfoy walks in, his rectangular, frameless glasses perched on the tip of his nose as he peers closely at a long scroll in his right hand, an enormous pile of colourfully labelled files clutched in the crook of his left arm. He’s garbed in neatly pressed grey trousers with a spotless white shirt tucked in, crimson and bronze striped tie knotted in a perfect double Windsor. His hair is as pale and shiny as ever, combed neatly into place, just a few errant strands falling across his brow. A fancy eagle feather quill is tucked behind one pink ear and there’s a smudge of green ink on his razor sharp nose.
I want to leave him scrambled and senseless. It’s a sort of crazed craving that suddenly possesses me. My cock is steadily hardening, and the longer I sit there thinking about doing things to him, messing him up, the more mindlessly turned on I’m getting.
Ron snorts. “Yeah, we all know what that means,” he glares at Harry, “Doesn’t your cock ever get tired?”
It’s a bit of a task holding a thrashing, flailing Malfoy in the throes of a particularly intense orgasm down, tugging his head back in warning when he shrieks too loud, while continuing to jackhammer away into his arse, lube starting to squelch out messily as Harry’s thrusts get uncontrolled and savage, Malfoy's rim dark and rosy where it stretches outwards with each pull-out of Harry's cock, clinging tightly to every ridge and fold.
is my room?” Malfoy asks, voice no louder than a whisper, disbelief laced with uncertainty. He takes everything in with wide eyes as he walks in, running long fingers over the high, glossy vanity, poking at the bowl of chocolates. “Potter, I—I don’t...require all this space,” he says weakly, tracing the carved patterns on the gigantic, ceiling-to-floor length wardrobe.
Harry lowered his head, unable to take his eyes off the spit-slicked lips. “I don’t want to stop,” he admitted, grinding his still covered cock into Malfoy’s bare erection just to emphasise
Draco blinks, eyes wide but face otherwise empty. His gaze darts all over my face, his pink mouth slightly open as he makes an obvious effort to puzzle me out.
Taking a step back she moves her wand in a straight line in front of Malfoy, starting from his forehead down to where his feet swing above the floor, repeating the motion a couple more times before an orb of pale, bluish-silver light appears over Malfoy’s heart, floating serenely towards Hermione.
Draco scowls, trying to gauge whether Potter is trying to manipulate him into actually paying him a compliment or two, only to realise that the git looks genuinely content as he sits there smirking at Draco, like he really believes Draco would never in his right mind find anything pleasing about him. For a moment, he considers just agreeing with him out of spite, rudely informing Potter that he
Even though he’d barely spoken just now, Draco thinks he knows what Harry will say when they next meet, when they talk about this. He’s fully expecting some sort of speech about how what Draco did was stupid and dangerous, and how, now that Draco has seen what Harry truly is, he should leave; move on and find someone less savage to be with.
It’s unplanned and clumsy and frantic and entirely too sweet, and Draco is mindless throughout, gasping out expletives the whole two minutes that Potter spends inside him, rocking unsteadily and groaning softly. He barely makes a sound as he flies over the edge, dragging Potter along too, and lies trembling in Potter’s arms afterwards, silent and overwhelmed.
“Did you paint these on?!” I tug fruitlessly at his blue jeans and he sniggers, his mouth clumsily landing on mine, whiskey and beer mingling on our tongues. “Why do you smell like chocolate?” I hiccup into his soft, flushed cheek, sliding one hand up under his un-tucked black shirt, immediately twisting the nipple when my fingers brush.
“The muslin will absorb the pungent fumes that rise when dittany and valerian root mix,” Granger says, slow and thoughtful, “which otherwise would have just infused itself into the potion itself--”
into his eyes; eyes that are very wide as he stares at me in mild shock. I stare right back because I don’t know how
“Then listen to Papa,” Harry says calmly, winking at Draco again as he comes back with a brick of butter.
The snapped instruction made Harry shift into action almost automatically. He hefted his left knee onto the bed and swung his right leg over Malfoy’s calves, leaning forward and slipping his fingers under the waistband of the pale blue pyjamas. His hands paused momentarily and Harry used the second of indecision to glance up at Malfoy once more.
The unfinished question hangs in the air as Draco releases his cock just long enough to gather his own hair and twist it up into a loose knot at the nape of his neck, his movements hurried and clumsy as he eagerly leans back down and lifts Potter’s cock once more.
Ron makes a sound that’s half sympathetic, half impatient. “This is why you were given permission to go on leave until you--”
Harry slants him a look, gaze amused as he takes in Malfoy’s wide, mischievously twinkling grey eyes, his sharp nose still slightly pink from the cold outside, to match his cheeks, flushed with playful excitement. Slowly Harry says, “I’m not a vanilla prude.”
“Yes.” Harry kept his eyes wide open and fixed on the rain outside the nearest window because every time he so much as blinked while thinking about it, he could clearly recall the dementor bending over Ginny as she lay sprawled out and helpless. He’d left her there like that. “So how can she be gone?” he said out loud.
Harry leans forward and nuzzles him. “It’s never happened with anyone else,” he confirms and then watches Malfoy’s cheek colour further. “I’m really sorry, Malfoy.”
, pushing his arse back onto that tongue and then bucking forward so his cock slid against the wall.
“You know...” Erickson waves a hand at his desk, a thin frown creasing his brow, “You know,” he repeats. When Draco stares impassively back at him, he leans forward slightly, “You don’t...know?”
“What?” he asks, rubbing their noses together. “What is it?” he presses, drawing back further when Draco simply swallows hard and stares up at him a little desperately.
“Is that what they’re calling it these days?” Draco asked. Potter’s cheeks pinkened and he shoved Draco playfully.
His children would never know life. He had died for their future. If only he had another chance to properly die again if it meant they would live; he would in a heartbeat.
“Heedless of the fact that had he ended up hurting you, he’d have lived the rest of his life with the sort of guilt that would have probably killed him,” Weasley says, low and calm. “The man was barely just starting to get over the pit of depressed despair he’d fallen into since he was turned. And then
Draco, his cheeks pink, had wanted very much to fling his glass of cold beer into Weasley’s stupid grinning face.
to Potter, hanging on for dear life, one leg wrapped around his hip as he’d had rutted and ground his cock into his hand, whining like a bitch in heat, coming within mere seconds as he’d screamed and moaned and bitten expletives into the crook of Potter’s neck.
Suddenly, the dislike morphs into that burning hatred that, the last time I’d experienced, had made me shove this guy off his broom midair.
you weren’t wearing pants under this,” Harry murmurs, grabbing the milky white globes of Malfoy’s bum and kneading two handfuls of the soft, supple flesh. “These trousers are too bloody tight, and you’re never wearing them in public again unless I’m with you.”
From the floor, Harry watched Malfoy raise both arms over his head. In his hands there was a sword of pure gold.
Maybe it had been sometime around the second week of Auror training, when Potter had politely requested Draco to budge over so he could reach the pot of tea in the break room, and Draco had automatically snubbed him and asked him to take his orphaned arse elsewhere. The tips of Potter’s ears had turned red, the slow spread of rage making Draco’s skin tingle with anticipation even as regret had bloomed in his chest.
“I wasn’t particularly craving that much sugar when he did but now I do,” Draco grouses. “All the fucking time.”
Potter, however, looks completely unruffled. “Yeah, something like that,” he says, nodding as he watches his own hand slide down Draco’s flank. “It’s stressful, physically and mentally. I’m basically overpowering the most significant part of lycanthropy – it’s taxing.” Then his face falls again. “Even though I do stay human, some of the wolf’s more savage instincts do creep up. That’s why last night I—”
“Fuck,” Potter breathes, his head falling back and his hips canting out when Draco pushes his thumb into the slit and massages until a clear dribble of precome oozes out.
Suddenly, everything clicks into place and Draco hisses furiously, “Does this have something to do with—
.” If Draco hadn’t spent the past week falling too hard and too quickly for Potter, he’d have definitely considered flinging a sharp hex or two at him, if only to wrest a more charged reaction out of him.
This time, Harry’s hands fly down onto Draco’s head, feathering briefly over his hair before, with what must’ve been an immense burst of self-control, he draws them back, curling them around the headboard and gurgling wetly as Draco obliges him with a sucking tug to his sac. With damp fingers, Draco pushes and kneads Harry’s taint, thumb pressing along the smooth stretch of his perineum over and over, until Harry is screaming expletives at the ceiling.
“No, he doesn’t know,” Harry waves a hand, and then when Malfoy looks confused, “Oh, I mean, it’s a surprise gift,” he adds hastily.
“Can we just...” Harry looks around again, “talk?” he finishes, slightly hopeless and sure that Malfoy is going to insist that he leave.
“Fucker.” I pull my hand back and round my desk to sit down in my seat. “You figure out why the bloke couldn’t open his dead father’s old trunk then?”
Tristan is telling a slightly bemused looking Mrs. Weasley about being an investment something-or-another at Gringotts, droning on and on, and I vaguely wonder if she’d even
Shuddering again, this time with cold realisation, Harry wonders about the best way to tell someone that you’ve knotted them. He’s able to feel where his cock has thickened inside Malfoy, just around the base, and Malfoy hisses through his teeth when Harry pulls against the clutch of his stretched rim.
From what Harry could tell, the whole village seemed deserted. The quiet surrounding him wasn’t the sleepy quiet of early morning, but the dead silence of a place uninhabited. Not even birds seemed to be around to sing anymore. When he scanned the skies there were just puffs of clouds and thankfully no dementors.
“Fine, I’ll just go, then,” Draco said, abruptly giving up and turning on his stool to hop off and stomp away.
“No, it’s your birthday,” Draco says quickly, scowling a bit. “Don’t think about them on your birthday.”
Harry didn’t get flustered. Instead, he leaned forward and brought the shirt around Malfoy’s back. “I do know.” He could feel Malfoy’s breath on his skin again. “I’m sorry.”
Potter laughs breathlessly, his face finally lighting up again, young and handsome as he gazes, eyes bright and shiny, at Draco. His hands slowly edge towards Draco’s arse and so Draco kisses him again, nipping and sucking on his lower lip, growling softly until Potter finally catches on and starts steering them towards the bed.
“Merlin!” Draco’s squeak of pleasure is once again lost in the rather feral growl Harry gently bites into his arsehole, his tongue painting broad strokes from Draco balls up to his tailbone, each lick against his rim softening it further.
They pick up the potions from the kiosk on the ground floor and then Floo back to Grimmauld, Draco immediately taking off his cloak and heading upstairs to his room, Potter staring after him, helpless and morose. He’s barely just taken a piss and washed up for dinner when the awaited knock sounds and Draco opens the en suite door and waves his hand from near the sink to let Potter in instead of just answering out loud.
“You’re still hard,” Harry pointed out unnecessarily. “And you’re currently in no condition to—to take care of it.” Carefully, Harry traced one finger over the back of one of Malfoy’s hands, the plain white bandage slightly coarse but soft under his touch.
“Er.” Harry watched as Malfoy’s eyes came open, one eyebrow hooking up. “Sorry, but would you mind terribly if I handed Lily to you for a moment?”
, all the press around my wolf thing, but—” He leans back, crossing his arms, staring off again, “I dunno if you remember how it was back when—you know, when I was bitten. I mean,” he laughs rather derisively, “Puddlemere had just won at Nationals – they barely acknowledged
The fucking phone went off again just then and muttering darkly, yelping as he skidded on an empty biscuit packet, Harry went to answer it.
“No,” Harry says pointedly. “Something else. It’s rubbish and I’m absolutely not interested, but those nagging shits won’t take no for an answer.”
He’s already found someone to dance with, and Harry grips his bottle too tight as he watches the way the man immediately pulls Malfoy closer, his hands skating over Malfoy’s hips, thumbs slipping under the waistband of his leather trousers as he grabs his arse and pulls their groins flush.
He pulls out what appears to be just a long length of thick black thread, until I see something glinting off the end. He holds it out to me and I take the necklace, peering at the oval medallion that dangles at the end. The dull gold base has a pellucid gem stone in a deep green set into it, the extremely fine threads of gold running through the stone catching the light every now and then.
“Still feel those drinks, Malfoy?” Harry asks after his cock has stopped throbbing, dragging in lungfuls of citrusy air with his face pressed into Malfoy’s hair.
When at last they did part long enough to talk, Harry blurted, “Fuck, but I’ve been dying to do that.”
then, lifting his hand off Draco’s mouth to grab his hip hard enough that Draco can feel his fingernails through his shirt, digging into the tender flesh there. “Potter, release me at once.” Draco almost lets out a hysterical cackle at how pathetic he sounds; he doesn’t even
Malfoy looks at him like he’s genuinely doubtful Harry has a brain. “No,” he says slowly and with emphasis, “But I’m
to come for me?” he asks roughly, hand tightening in Malfoy’s hair as he noses his way down his cheek to his throat, licking broad swathes through the salt there.
He was sure he was properly blushing now. And he was trembling very lightly from a mixture of genuine mortification and...
“Hey,” the prat says sheepishly. “Er... Are you here to throw those in my face?” he adds, eyeing the bottle, the folder and the box of cloak-clasps Draco is holding precariously.
I sit up but remain on the floor, turning to lean back against the sofa, folding my legs up to my chest and resting my elbows on my knees. I don’t look at him.
Draco moans, soft and helpless, and he’d tried holding onto it but he absolutely cannot give a damn anymore. Potter releases his waist and brings both hands up to cradle his face, gentling the kiss into a playful nibble before pulling away, eyes dark and hungry, mouth wet and red.
– is lodged firmly against Potter’s groin, and Draco wants nothing more than for Potter to maybe twist his neck until it snaps so he doesn’t have to live through whatever is about to follow.
“Suck,” he rasps, wrenching away and stuffing two fingers into Draco’s mouth, fucking them in and out in time with his fist on Draco’s cock. “Want them inside you?” he whispers against Draco’s cheek and Draco shudders, balls jumping up; Potter immediately squeezes around the base and Draco howls in protest.
Draco writhes on the bed, the sheets too hot against his suddenly hypersensitive skin. His cock has risen in just the couple of minutes it took to get him on the bed and undressed and Harry touches him everywhere but where Draco most wants him to. His hips rise up off the bed every few seconds, groin angled towards Harry’s blazing mouth and tongue as it traces little patterns on the skin over his hipbones.
from between cupped hands and Granger shook her head without looking up, mouth curled into an exasperated smile. Longbottom made a soft
“Harry didn’t exaggerate,” Weasley replies stupidly, and Draco ignores the muffled splutter that issues from Potter. “And Hermione too-- You’re like...a Veela.”
Potter turns back to Weasley after another burning, somewhat searching, look at Draco, and the two of them carry on towards the showers, Draco watching the stiff lines of Potter’s back.
Draco sighs, halting in his tracks and turning, weary and cool, as Pearce Erickson striding up the corridor towards him, pulling his face mask on. He has the same deep pockets beneath his eyes, the same greyish tinge to his skin.
Malfoy’s lip only curls further at this and he replies to neither of them as he asks the room in general, “What’s
He lay quietly with Lily for a while as the sky lightened. James had kicked off his blankets as usual and Albus lay on his stomach. Harry wondered if the Cushioning charm beneath the bedding had worn off and if they could feel the ground underneath like he himself could.
, and had determinedly rejoined work the following Monday despite having being granted as many weeks of paid leave as he may require.
“There’s nothing wrong with me buying you things,” Potter said quietly. “I like taking care of you.”
“Is that the problem?” Potter scowls. “Spending one-on-one time with me? You’re afraid I’ll drag you into an empty room, and what? Curse you?”
Harry stares at a framed photograph of Malfoy and his mother that sits on the desk. He’s no older than fifteen in it, tall and bony as he puts an arm around Narcissa’s shoulders and slants Harry an appraising smile. Narcissa, Harry observes, is smiling rather vapidly at nothing in particular.
“You’ve been sort of... faraway for days now,” Hermione said softly, her gaze never lifting from her book, her hand moving steadily as she made notes. “Is everything alright?”
He squirms with a wet chuckle when Harry whispers sweet nonsense against his navel, giving him a loopy grin when he looks up and then sighing softly when Harry rolls him onto his left side and lifts his leg up.
Harry stilled, blinking down at Malfoy’s chest, damp with his saliva. One of the scars, the very tip of one, cut into the pink of his nipple – his right nipple. It was only evident when seen up close, and just to comfort his hysterically panicking brain and his thunderously drumming heart, Harry sucked over it wetly.
“He’s... Ah.” Harry fidgeted for a second before saying, “Scorpius, this is Albus. And this is James.”
Draco scoffs the best he can with his heart in his throat as the too familiar, gleaming mahogany box is revealed, instantly making his insides clench painfully. He stares at the bright brass clasp for several beats too long before he’s lifting it up and flinging the box open, one hand flying to his mouth as he sees the white gold watch he’d sold off to Garrick and Graeme’s in Diagon Alley about a year after moving into that dingy flat when he’d returned from yet another failed job interview.
Potter sits on the steel stool, spinning himself round and round, and making Draco dizzy, eventually getting up and poking around Draco’s lab, knocking things over and apologising profusely as he straightens them back up, flipping in curious bewilderment through some of the countless volumes Draco has got stacked along his bookshelf in the corner, and generally being a lot less intimidating and intense than Draco usually found him to be.
“I lost that job,” Malfoy tells her very blandly. “I had a lot of trouble finding another. And since I was warded out of the family property, I was informed I had no claim to the family vaults either,” he continues, glaring daggers at his father.
Potter swallows hard, his sweat-shiny throat bobbing as his hands loosen around Draco’s. “Use your--” he murmurs, but his voice cracks and he quickly clears his throat discreetly. “Lift yourself using your free foot and use your knee against my side to throw me off.” He speaks so softly that his voice is merely a puff of air against the damp skin of Draco’s neck.
“Yeah, I don’t fall ill much,” Harry lifts up and places one elbow next to Draco’s shoulder, resting one cheek in his hand as he gazes down at him, “If there’s one perk to the way I was brought up, it’s that I developed a great immunity even before I turned ten.” He grins lazily, lightly tickling the red tip of Draco’s nose as he drags another pillow under his head and then wraps both arms around Harry’s neck, sighing as Harry lands atop him with a soft
“They’re doing that now. The dementors. They’re taking away people.” His heart thundering in his ears, Harry sat in silence. “Sometimes they Kiss them first. But apparently they take some away...whole,” Malfoy’s eyes shifted, “Like they tried to with your little girl, earlier today.”
He tried to stand. His ankle protested violently and Harry let out a gritted scream of pain, falling back onto his arse.
“Off,” Harry mutters, trying to push the soft terry from Draco’s shoulders. Draco stands up on his knees and shrugs it off, gasping when Harry immediately lunges forward and sucks one tight, pink nipple into his mouth. “Fuck, baby,” he moans softly, as Draco cradles his head close and trembles.
“Well, he failed to mention any of this to me, Granger,” Draco says steadily; next to him Potter lets out a loud whoosh of air and Grangers mouth ticks up on a smile.
Potter tucks Draco’s hair behind his ear, his other arm tightening around his back. “I believe Hermione said they’d be here around seven,” he blinks, tilting his head, “Why?”
He pulled off for a second to look up once again; Malfoy’s hands, heavily bound as they were, were clenched beside his head on his pillow and his eyes were open – they were
Potter grins crookedly, leaning back against the armrest and throwing an arm across the back of the sofa. “Go on, then,” he challenges, “pay me a compliment, Malfoy.”
“An interesting question you bring up, my dear.” Lucius leans back once more, fingers steepled over his chest, a strange glint of triumph in his eyes. At Narcissa’s enquiring look, he turns to her with an overtly patient sigh. “Cissa, don’t you see? Draco is here because he wishes to move back
“No,” Harry said firmly, just as the rusted, creaky old signboard of the Hog’s Head came into view ahead of them. “I’m buying you that Firewhiskey, just shut up and drink it.”
“No,” Malfoy says at once, smirking and dragging Harry closer by the leg he has over his shoulder. Shaking his head in exasperation, Harry bends forward and pushes in, cleaving his way inside on a single slide until his pelvis hits Malfoy’s bump, Malfoy’s thigh trembling where it’s pressed between them. “
Harry stares at Malfoy’s stomach where he now, at this distance, spots the miniscule bump, just below his navel, barely noticeable – Malfoy could pass it off as muscle and nobody would think anything of it.
Draco glared at him until he stood stiffly in the tight circle of Harry’s arms. Harry still had the boxers hanging over his shoulder. “The ferret needs to be
Harry lets out a slightly tortured laugh. “Draco, you’re literally the only person who’s actually helping me in some
“Hmph,” grunted Draco, letting himself be pulled flush against Harry, shivering lightly as Harry pressed kisses up the side of his neck right up to the back of his ear, still carefully grinding his cock against him.
. The forest floor was surprisingly soft under him, spongy with fine wild grass. The earth was porous and incredibly thirsty, judging by how quickly it was gulping down the blood that
. He stares at the milky stretch of Malfoy’s nape as he walks away, frail strands of blond curling onto it, the delicate skin unblemished and inviting.
“I thought I asked you to stop talking,” Draco snarls, reaching down to squeeze the base of his erection. “Oh!” Mouth falling open at the press of Harry’s cock into him, Draco holds himself perfectly still.
from the number of dry orgasms he’d thrashed through. His palm felt rough and calloused against the oversensitive shaft and he’d had to put on a wrist brace after a point for how painful and creaky the joint got. Cold showers did nothing but clog up his sinuses, and sleep mostly evaded him because the fucking tent-pole between his legs meant he could
“See, this is why you need a partner,” I tell him exasperatedly. “So you have someone watching your back.”
“Ron,” Potter and Granger say in unison, Granger rolling her eyes wearily, Potter looking slightly panicked.
Malfoy turned to him, silver eyes flaming. For a second, Harry was convinced Malfoy was about to ask him to get the fuck out of his bed. And then, “Yes.”
under his breath before disappearing with a pop and Harry feels like he’s been sealed to the floor which feels like a sheet of ice beneath him.
“Give him something for that, please,” Harry says gruffly, frowning at the floor as they both turn to regard him. “He’s literally growing another human, he needs to eat,” he says, stiffly.
“I just don’t know what your feelings are about Malfoy and his...past, Harry,” Hermione says, getting to her feet.
Harry’s mouth finally crooks into a little smirk. “I have you to thank for that, I suppose,” he says, nodding his chin in Draco’s direction. “You didn’t come by tonight,” he goes on. “I got a little worried so I popped into the Ministry.”
Blinking, he looked around to see Moody scuttle past with his own little soft baby blue flannel blanket clutched in his pink mouth. Draco scowled. That fucking ferret. He still couldn’t believe that Harry washed his gross, fur-covered blanket along with the rest of their clothes.
“They’re happy for you too.” A brief pause, and then Harry says tentatively, “You do remember it was Hermione that found you that first time?” When Draco stiffens beneath him, he starts hastily, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--”
like that, Potter, not when I have no idea where to go looking for you!” Draco yells, stepping forward and shoving roughly at Potter’s chest. “Not without telling me what’s
He half expects Harry’s hands in his hair when he stripes a broad lick over one light brown nipple, glancing up in pleasant surprise when Harry only shivers and arches into it, hands curling into loose fists but staying in place, Draco’s own hands stroking up and down Harry’s flanks, warm and firm. He applies steady suction, pulling on the pebbled nub until Harry is moaning loudly, hips bucking up into nothing, the skin around his nipple damp and dark when Draco finally lets up, only to move onto the twin, treating it to the same, relentless sucking, adding a generous helping of teeth this time, nibbling and plucking at the nipple with his lips until Harry is a gasping, panting mess.
Draco stood there wordlessly, shivering as the wet, hot mouth worked expertly over each of the sensitive little nooks along his neck, the light stubble catching on his skin, adding an edge to the softly sucked kisses. His tie was tugged loose and pulled off over his head and his collar was yanked aside for more access to his throat. When Harry bit firmly into the curve between neck and shoulder, Draco whined softly.
,” I say pointedly, “I’m in love with you or something. It’s probably just a phase, though. I’ll probably get back with Simon once he’s discharged.”
“How are you so calm about this?” Harry asks after a beat, his lips moving in shapeless patterns over Malfoy’s glowing skin.
Harry’s gaze flicked between Malfoy’s damp cock and the skin his hands stroked, finally unable to resist licking a determined path up the underside of his erection. Malfoy’s hips bucked, a low sound drifting out from under his hands.
Draco has to takes several steadying breaths and forcibly wrench his gaze off Potter’s tightly muscled, bare chest. “When you
“There are survivor camps springing up everywhere, though. Hermione thought Hogwarts should be one.” He paused as Malfoy simply looked at him. “People aren’t really very drawn to Hogwarts anymore, are they? Not since the War.”
is easier to find than a soulmate,” Harry had mumbled sadly, helplessly closing a hand over his crotch as his cock started to throb again.
And then Potter moves forward, but it’s not with the intent of touching Draco, apparently, for he just strides in, crowding Draco, backing him up against the double doors and, well, then he
can’t believe you’re real. It’s why I kiss you so much, you know,” he says wisely, “to make sure you’re not something I’ve whipped up from imagination.”
I add a dollop of heavy cream into the huge pot and stir, tasting it yet again and deciding it needs more salt. I’m just lifting the spoon to taste again when I hear the crack of Apparition and a moment later, Draco saunters into the kitchen, clutching a large paper bag.
Malfoy, flushed and sweaty, eyes slightly crossed, mouth wet and gasping open, says, “You didn’t ask the first time, Potter.”
Draco hadn’t believed the rumours when they’d hit the mill – the very prospect of it seemed laughable.
His erection is a persistent bump under Draco’s and it’s almost without thought that Draco reaches down and fumbles with Harry’s flies until he’s holding Harry’s pulsing, throbbing cock.
“A room to practice in,” Potter answers as though obvious. “Shall we?” He strides over and pushes open the door, sticking his head in and looking around before shooting Draco a grin over his shoulder. “Come on, then.”
“What right do I have to ask you to choose me?” Harry’s chest aches at how open Malfoy’s expression is.
Potter turns at once, eyes large and very dark, shoulders tense and high. “Sorry?” he asks voice rough, and what appears to be genuine confusion creasing his face.
Suspicion immediately intensifying, Malfoy tilts his head back to peer at Harry down his sharp nose. “About?”
“I owled you,” Malfoy says, swallowing desperately. “I owled you dozens of times after I broke up with—” This time when he breaks off, Malfoy stares fixedly at his own feet, his cheeks slowly colouring. Across from them, Lucius’ mouth curls into a small smirk.
Harry garbles something into the bed and Draco turns around with a snarl of frustration, stopping dead as Scorpius comes sauntering into the room, crooked smile of self-satisfaction directed at Draco as he holds his little arms out and spins in place, green eyes shining with excitement, jet black hair in a horrid, hopeless pile on his head.
“I don’t give a fuck, to be honest,” Harry says flatly. Narcissa makes a soft sound of disapproval and Harry’s cheeks warm slightly. “Er. Sorry...” Malfoy is now grinning at him, shoulders shaking with mirth and Harry feels the exhilaration bubbling up inside him as well, biting down on inward-turned lips to stem his sudden laughter.
For one breathless moment, Harry fully believed that Malfoy would sneer and walk away without taking his hand.
with something Draco can’t place, his jaw clenched tightly as if he’s gritting and grinding his teeth together. His lips are pressed into a thin line and as Draco stares, they tighten further.
“He’s sent his apologies,” Draco replies calmly, wiping up the last smear of gravy on his plate with a chunk of roast potato. “He’s baking the cake for the party.”
Malfoy looks up now, eyes still swimming with tears, but expression bewildered. Harry points to the food again and Malfoy draws his chair up, wiping his nose one last time before handing the apron back to Harry.
“He doesn’t want to see—” Potter started to mumble, but Weasley seized him by the shoulder and spun him around on his stool, nearly sending Potter sliding off his seat. Draco just had a moment to spot something silver hanging from a long, thin chain around his neck, gleaming against the dark material of Potter’s black T-shirt, before Weasley was waving the round badge, the size of a sickle, in Draco’s face.
I’m not sure if it’s the food or the nerves or a combination of the two that’s making me as nauseous as I feel by the time we head into the living room and seat ourselves on the sofa, close enough that I can feel the heat of his body, but not actually touching.
“Shut up and fuck me,” Malfoy groans, his toes curling where his foot flops in midair, his hips now moving in time with Harry’s fingers, thighs trembling. “Damn it, Potter!” he sobs, spine pulling inwards as Harry works in a third finger and twists them inside him.
“One of these days, you’re going to come home and find him gone, I swear to Merlin,” he threatened. But it didn’t sound as morbid as he’d hoped because his arsehole was still clenching and his cock was trickling a final drop of come down his shaking thigh and Harry was running large, calloused hands all over him. “And maybe I’ll kick
The pressure around his cock becomes unendurable as Malfoy bursts into sudden orgasm, his arse clamping vice like around him as he cries out and thrashes, their stomachs sliding together as Malfoy comes in long, endless jets.
Draco swallows hard, staring at it unblinkingly for far too long before hurriedly snapping out of it. “Oh,
goes down to the canteen lest he runs into the slightly lascivious lunch-wizard whom Harry had once furtively hit with a Stinging Hex for touching Draco’s hair.
There’s another long pause. “Really?” Malfoy turns his head so Harry can see one pink cheek and a heavy-lidded grey eye trained curiously on him.
makes shoes out of glass?! – instead of just looking the woman in the face and recognising her as the one who gave him a raging stiffy? What an utter shit. Muggles have some fucked up literature, man.”
It’s just sex, Draco thought, lifting his hips and letting Potter tug his jeans and pants off in one messy bundle. It’s just a drunken shag, he told himself as he let Potter press his knees back onto his chest. This is where Potter belongs, he mused: between Draco’s legs with his tongue up Draco’s arse.
, Ron?” Harry almost yells, finally locating the right file and yanking on it so hard that the folder rips, sheets of neatly arranged parchment spilling out onto the desk, sailing off the edge and onto the floor. Sighing, Harry pinches the bridge of his nose for a moment, lifting his glasses and rubbing at one eye. “Look,” he says wearily, “this whole fucking thing is mental, and I know some people are fucking
bears a spasmodically moving picture of them in black and white – Malfoy helping Harry up and reaching out to clutch at two bulging paper bags, while carefully nudging Harry’s bleeding arm higher and taking his other arm.
“Don’t be mad anymore,” murmured Harry plaintively, working the knot of Draco’s pink terry bathrobe open and then turning him around in his arms. “You’re too hot right now for me to resist you.”
Dressed, Draco heads downstairs to the main sitting room where Potter usually is found at this time of the day, making it all the way up to the doorway before stopping dead in his tracks at the sight before him.
Malfoy’s gaze, fixed on the way Harry’s holding up his trunk, snaps up to his in a flat glare. “That better be a fucking joke, Potter,” he says dangerously.
The first lap is laid along the entirety of Draco’s crack, a long, thorough lick with the flat of his tongue, then another, this time running all the way up to his tailbone. Then Harry pushes his face into the moistened groove with a throaty, slightly lewd groan that’s nearly Draco’s undoing by itself, and tickles his arsehole with the very tip of his tongue.
He brought Lily a little bowl of dry Froot Loops to munch on. He checked the fridge one last time and threw out some old pudding cups. He tore off all the pictures of the kids they had up on the fridge and put them in his pocket.
Malfoy’s bright head had disappeared from view by then and Harry had bolted after him, ignoring Ron’s high pitched squeak of mortification at Hermione’s suggestion, his own mind filled with hysterical laughter at the ridiculous thought of being
Potter chuckles again, turning his head and pressing several wet kisses to Draco’s inner thigh before helping him off and onto his back next to him, leaning over and burying his face against Draco’s neck again. “Did I go too far?”
still looks unbelievably sexy though, and nowhere as sloppy as his sidekicks – but then, Draco thinks, he may be a tad biased.
Draco fiddles with his collar self-consciously before clearing his throat with a sharp click. “How are you?” he asks, when green finally meets grey.
They’ve danced before, pressed up close and sharing the same space. They’ve been close before, hands tight on each other. Harry knows what Malfoy smells like by now, what his sweat smells like, what his breath smells like after a few drinks.
The silence lasted a lot longer than before, both of them not saying a word for what had to be at least a quarter of an hour. Harry checked the large, round clock that ticked soundlessly on the wall above Madam Pomfrey’s office; it was nearly four AM.
Draco had not pointed out that Potter could simply owl-order an entire crate of muscle relaxants from the nearest apothecary for under twenty sickles. He’d nodded at once, gulping. “Yes, of course, you’re likely always tense and stiff, I’ll brew you something--”
to massage him in a steady, truly evil press-and-release, making him hurriedly pull out just stave to off his suddenly looming orgasm.
“Wait, seriously?” Potter glances down at the box with a look of dawning realisation. “Everyday...forever?”
“Wouldn’t it just be easier all around if you lived with me?” Harry beseeches. “I’d be able to keep an eye on how you’re doing; I’ll be on hand for you to order around! I’ll be your damn personal butler if you want, Malfoy, I know you’d just
Harry doesn’t dare to take the seat next to Malfoy’s and is too nervous to sit down anyway, so he hovers awkwardly beside the desk, arms folded. Hermione throws him a comforting little smile as she sits back down, smoothing her lime green robes down neatly.
expression – the one where his eyes are slightly narrowed as if in deep concentration, like he’s wordlessly cast a
He’s still unkempt and barefooted, his hair in a knotted mess around his head, stubble having thickened into a light beard, but he now looks rested, like he’s had a few good nights’ sleep and a meal or two.
“Could you help me put my shirt back on?” He suddenly leaned down and picked up his pyjama bottoms off the floor. “I’ll manage with these. I just--” He sighed. “I can’t let Pomfrey find me naked here, can I?”
Harry fitted their mouths together, pulled out and rammed back in, marvelling at his own self control, amazed at the fact that he hadn’t come all over the both of them already. His back ached and his left leg felt like it was about to go into a cramp. His injured side was properly hurting him again, the pain muted for the time being under the heat of his dangerously looming climax, Malfoy’s arse clenching mercilessly around him. Harry was
“You didn’t hurt me,” Draco interrupts loudly, scowling up at him. “Do you mind maybe not ruining it every single time?”
“See, this is what I’m talking about,” Harry barks loudly and Malfoy starts where he sits, looking around at Harry in wide-eyed silence. “Grow
. “Go back to whatever cupboard you were holed up in,” he says irritably, turning away and making his quick way upstairs.
His hand bumps into his own chin as he works Potter’s cock at a furious pace, sucking loudly until his cheeks hollow. Jaw aching and lips swollen, Draco shuts his eyes when Potter finally cries out hoarsely and shoves Draco’s head down with both hands. He presses his cock into Draco’s throat as it twitches and pulses out ribbon after salty ribbon of warm spunk that Draco eagerly gulps down while feeling like an absolute slut, whining and whimpering as he grinds his own erection against the front of the sofa, staining the rich upholstery with precome.
Draco nods. “The rest can be discarded — and along with it, the acrid bitterness that makes the potion taste so utterly dreadful.”
He props the card up on the vanity next to the newly filled bowl of chocolates, which Draco pauses to note, are from
such a star athlete,” Weasley grits out at once, hand clenching around his bottle as his eyes flash.
“We’re meeting the git’s boyfriend this Friday,” Ron says, sniggering and nodding towards Draco who’s frowning at me for not having paid attention.
so much,” Harry says with a lewd grin. “You definitely fall into the ‘remotely decent looking’ category.”
Harry was on his feet with Lily’s tiny, motionless body pressed against his chest. His wand grew hot in his hand.
with Potter and seeing him in joggers that sit too low on his hips and ripped jeans that cling to his rock hard arse and t-shirts that stretch too snugly across his broad chest and on one blessed occasion, in nothing but his fluffy, white towel.
I shake my head as Ron and I enter the locker room – guess we’ll be hearing all about that tomorrow morning.
“It was almost six when you finally came to bed,” Harry reminds him, rifling through one of the cabinets. “You need the rest, you look dreadful as it is,” he adds cheerfully, finally plucking out a set of measuring cups.
,” Potter sighs, shoulders slumping and his chin dropping to his chest. “I just—I didn’t think you’d even care, okay? I knew you’d think it to be some...I dunno, display of superiority or something equally obnoxious and I thought it was just a conversation we could skip.”
Harry smiled and stepped forward, extending his hand. Scorpius squeaked and darted behind Malfoy’s legs.
“I’m fine,” Draco whispers at once, laying one warm hand on Harry’s cheek; he feels scorching hot, just like he had that day that he’d pressed his nose into Draco’s neck and sniffed him. “Is your leg okay? I’ll ask Kreacher to bring you a dose of Skele-Gro.”
“I’m glad you liked it!” Goddammit, why is my voice still so fucking shrill?! Draco seems rather unsettled by my cheeriness as well, and simply smiles, looking rather pained. “Champagne?!” I half-shout.
“Hello, you two,” she says, all warm smiles and kind brown eyes, shaking ash out of her hair. “How are my boys today?”
“Yeah, listen, about that.” Harry turned onto his side, leaning up on one elbow – he’d just had a brilliant idea – disastrous, but brilliant. “Listen, Malfoy, I don’t know whether you’re going to be interested but I—I know this bloke, at the Ministry--” Malfoy waited patiently through his stammering. “He’s erm... He’s looking to hire a personal assistant. He doesn’t care about Dark Marks and stuff, and... er, the pay’s good too.”
The breathy exhalation makes Draco sigh wearily, and he quickly slips his ivory comb back into his pocket and sweeps the long, freshly groomed curtain of his hair over his shoulder as he turns around with a little smile plastered to his face.
I furtively gaze at Draco, wondering if we’ll ever be engaged some day. I swallow, my mouth dry, as I realise just how brilliant that sounds. It’s unbelievable how much I want to be with Draco, how much I think of him when he’s not around, how difficult it’s become to look away from him when he
The sky breaks open and rain starts hammering against the pane of glass and Harry’s ears are jangling warningly as his temper spikes dangerously. “Do you even realise how dangerously you just Apparated?” he asks through clenched teeth, deliberately drawing deep, full breaths. “You could’ve splinched yourself, Malfoy.”
, Harry,” Draco tries tremulously, tightening his arms to a chokehold around Harry’s neck, “At least you saved him, you saved a
He’s dimly aware that he’s being pressed back into the granite counter, the cool edge digging into his lower back. Potter’s hand is stroking softly at Draco’s cheek now, his other arm still vice like around his waist as he kisses him ferociously enough that he’s bending Draco backwards over it.
Ron rolls his eyes as he shovels the last bit of pastry into his mouth, stands and picks up the case file I’d been perusing earlier. “Thanks, Em,” he says thickly to the slightly bewildered looking young Auror. “I’ll just be a sec.” She nods and quickly ducks out, Draco grinning and deftly dodging Ron’s attempt at smacking him on the head. “I’ll see you ladies later,” Ron calls over his shoulder as he leaves.
“But you didn’t,” Draco interrupts, a thin line between his brows. He crosses his arms and glares defiantly as Harry’s jaw clenches. “You didn’t and you won’t, I have absolute faith and I was ready to
When he looks around, Granger is smiling again, watching the ultrasound before looking down at Draco kindly, and when he glances, he sees Potter gulping furiously, eyes transfixed and suspiciously shiny.
I hear him charge at me but before I can turn he’s shoved me so hard that I nearly fall down flat. I stumble dangerously, catching myself, and turn, too shocked at first to react. He’s fumbling clumsily and presently draws his wand, pointing it at me, his breath coming out in harsh rasps through gritted teeth. His hand is shaking, as is the entirety of his narrow frame.
They headed to Islington, Draco straddling Potter’s thighs. Potter shoved his hands into Draco’s jeans, grabbing and massaging his arse. He sucked on Draco’s lips until they were swollen. He bit Draco about a dozen bruises along his neck before they stumbled out of the cab and swayed towards Potter’s greying, grim looking house.
He’s moaning before he can rein it in, his hand tightening in Harry’s hair as he drives himself into his mouth over and over, hips snapping and balls swinging wildly against Harry’s chin. Harry is unremitting as he sucks and pulls, head lifting off the pillow as he nods it over Draco’s cock, slurping and drooling around it, his stomach trembling with strain.
Then he remembered the bedding Ginny had packed. The wash of grief suddenly shifted to panic as Harry felt around over his chest. The shrunken trunks were gone.
he finds himself enjoying all of it, for they still haven’t actually talked about, or in any way addressed, what they are now.
We stack all the boxes of Christmas lights, decorations and ornaments next to the tree Ron had dragged in, with much groaning and swearing, half an hour ago. He’s now dozing with his mouth open on the sofa.
Potter just chuckles. “Well, it’s an open offer,” he tells him. “It’s sort of a useful skill to have, yeah? Sending messages in an emergency and stuff.”
“So fucking hot,” Harry grits, persistently licking him open, tongue sawing in and out of his arsehole. “Fuck you, Draco. Fuck you for staying away so long.”
“I... I want you to ride my cock, Draco,” Harry pants, already sounding a bit wrecked, clumps of hair stuck to his sweaty forehead, “Give me that gorgeous arse.”
“It’s hard not to watch your groupies make fools of themselves,” Draco says airily but his ears are still warm; the familiar humiliation at being bested is creeping in, and the need to vehemently reject Potter’s offer, purely out of spite, is on the very tip of his tongue.
Draco snorts. “I told you. I’m the only Slytherin staying back for Christmas. Well, except for that one fourth year, but I think she spends most of her nights stalking the Blood Baron.”
“Oh.” Scorpius looked a bit taken aback. He looked over at his father but Malfoy was digging around in their trunk and not paying attention. “I—I suppose I should ask Father... But, me, I like berries in my porridge.”
“The wolfsbane and silver stay in your bloodstream and keep the wolf suppressed,” Draco explains, “and along with it, all of its base instincts. It’ll also, to an extent, make your transformations less painful,” he adds, smiling hesitantly as Potter stares in utter disbelief. “You’ll also notice a more regular sleep pattern now, as well as an increase in appetite. You can imbibe your dose at any point in the day, as long as you take one vial
He tastes Malfoy’s cock, pulling the slender, rosy length into his mouth and sucking until it juts out stiff and wet, as hard and desperate as Harry’s own still rampant erection. He caresses Malfoy’s arsehole, gleaming wet and winking up at him as he conjures and carefully fingers lube into him.
Granger watches him as he adds the dittany to the cauldron, drop by drop, seven times, the potion gradually turning lighter with each drop. He stirs the mixture thrice, anticlockwise, and then places the ladle aside, further lowering the flame under the cauldron and covering it with a large square of soft, white muslin.
“I actually came here to try and figure out if you really do feel about Harry, the way he feels about you,” Weasley says with careful consideration, “or if the whole thing was some elaborate plan you concocted so you have something to wave in Harry's face as some petty victory.”
Over the last couple of days, however, Draco’s noticed a sudden, shockingly drastic drop in Harry’s mood. He barely talks, and even when he touches Draco it’s with a raw, almost angry hunger, ripping at Draco’s clothes, and yanking at his hair, and using more teeth than tongue everywhere. Draco is nearly always a quivering, moaning wreck underneath him when he gets like that and hasn’t yet been able to bring himself to complain or protest.
“Draco Malfoy!” Erickson greets, his loud boom of a voice slightly muffled behind one of the lime green, standard issue facemasks that are available in Mungo’s free clinic. “As distracting as ever,” he leans in, fingers clasped, gaze roving pointedly down Draco’s form.
Scorpius beamed. “Oh, but of course. I know about them too. Albus Severus and I are the same age. Your older son, of course, is three years our senior. Your daughter is Lily Luna and she’s three.”
Harry’s vivid gaze snaps up to his face and effortlessly snags his gaze, keeping Draco locked there as he leans forward, and with a slow, uninterrupted slide, pushes into Draco.
of flesh hitting flesh, both of them damp with sweat, Draco’s stomach still tacky with come, his cock being steadily stroked by Harry’s abdomen. “Nearly there,” he whimpers, wrapping both arms around Harry. “I’m—Harry, I want to come—”
“What did you do?” he wheezes, reaching forward and grabbing a handful of his son’s ludicrous, neon purple and vomit green robes, “How did you change them?
Potter shrugs and pulls a face, pushing his face back into the crook of Draco’s neck. “Stop calling him ‘Dark Lord’,” he murmurs, lapping gently over Draco’s jugular. “He’s literally a wispy bag of bones buried under multiple wards somewhere off the North Sea; nothing dark about him anymore.”
Potter is as red as Draco’s own face feels as he coughs once more, tugging at his earlobe. “Um, you and me, I guess,” he mumbles. “It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he adds hastily. “It’s just...you never get out of the house and it’s your birthday, after all, so I thought...” he trails off, slumping slightly. “It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he repeats.
Tearing his pants off, Harry licks a hard kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s thigh as he hooks it over his shoulder and straddles his other thigh on the bed, holding his cock tightly and walking forward on his knees until he can line up against his gleaming wet, furiously winking arsehole, his mouth watering at the sight. Pushing the tip in, Harry inches forward until the head is seated inside the rim; then he’s shuddering and reaching frantically for control because Malfoy’s insides

him to prevent any more such incidents, it’s sort of...nice of you? But don’t you think things would just be easier if you just went up to him and talked to him? Asked to be...something resembling friends?”
“Because you’re trying to behave like it’s not a big deal!” Draco realises he sounds decidedly hysterical now. “Like
The contents of the bowl, in turn, sparkle delicately under the natural light, and it’s what Granger is staring at in wide eyed fascination. She leans right in, so that her nose almost pierces through the intangible fence of moonlight, but stops just short, staring with her mouth slightly parted.
about Potter pleases him. The very sight of him lights something inside Draco up – the way Potter carries himself, careless and yet graceful, his smile, warm and crinkly, his stupid fucking hair, frighteningly, en
Draco calmly wipes his hands on his apron. “Yes, but I’ll make sure it tastes delicious.” Granger huffs, arms crossed, looking torn between genuine suspicion and some sort of grudging admiration. “Would you like to come in? I have a potion simmering.”
Draco pauses as Potter’s eyes bug out, expression appropriately shocked. Clearing his throat lightly he continues, “They never did find out who was responsible; there were too many guests in attendance and Septimus, being as prominent a member of society as he was, did not have the fucking
he’d displayed a few minutes ago as he ate Draco out with reckless sort of hunger; he looks almost pained, beseeching, as he cups the underside of one of Draco’s knees and pushes it up beside his chest, abruptly leaning down to nibble sharply at one of Draco’s nipples, wresting a croaked cry out of Draco.
Potter scowled. “Do I resemble the fucking barkeep?” he asked, pushing his stupid glasses up his nose.
“I don’t actually know,” Malfoy looks thoughtful, “I’ve wondered too, actually, but people always say that dancing is like sex and that if you’re good at one you’re automatically good at the other as well.”
, one sec,” Draco gasps, panting with his eyes shut, “Fuck, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to keep up with you.”
The cracked groan of pleasure Potter lets out as Draco’s mouth descends around him is quite enough for Draco to go fully hard. Potter’s cock lengthens and hardens further in the insistent, hot suction of Draco’s mouth, the soft foreskin stretching and peeling off the head. Draco hums as the lets the crown slip into his throat for a moment, smirking around the hard thickness when Potter cries out and drops a hand into Draco’s freshly washed, still damp hair. Potter leaves his hand there, loose and undemanding, as Draco bobs his head steadily, slicking Potter’s cock up thoroughly, leaving it gleaming with spit when he sucks off to lick hungrily into the slit.
“He doesn’t like it, you know,” Malfoy says casually, as though continuing a conversation they’d just been having. “Theo. He hates smelling these on me.”
Even Draco couldn’t help but heave in silent mirth as he’d watched Finnigan shriek and scrabble at the centaur’s hindquarters, Thomas almost pissing himself, judging by how hard he’d laughed, before going to rescue him while the rest of them, Potter included, had roared with helpless,
“Do you regret what happened?” Harry asked bluntly, not ready to let Malfoy bait him into an argument. “You think I forced myself on you or someth--?”
“Good guess. The bint is never happy with just a sweater. So now I’ve to find her a fucking necklace that costs me half my annual earnings.”
, come here,” Harry panted, knocking away his hand and hefting Draco up with one arm crooked beneath his arse, using his other hand to guide his cock into place.
“With a bloke,” Harry added. Ron’s hands scrabbled through the mess of books and parchments on their table as he made a dramatic grab for the edge, looking very much like he was about to faint, vomit and laugh for a week all at once. Hermione’s eyebrows disappeared under her fringe and she pursed her lips up very tightly.
“Ugh, Potter, stop being a fucking girl,” he snapped. Harry heard the gush of Malfoy presumably washing his hands. He heard the rip of tissues being wrenched out. Then Malfoy sighed. “I’m not upset. I just—what does one say after they have phone sex with their school rival completely out of the blue? I mean, I wasn’t
“Well... Would you still look out for him after he’s given you what you want?” she questions tentatively, and Harry just stares at her, speechless and so openly horrified, that she instantly looks guilty. “I didn’t mean—” she starts.
“What are you doing?” Malfoy grits, baring his teeth and lifting onto his elbow, glaring dangerously at him. “Did you
“Happy birthday,” Harry whispered, grabbing Draco’s hand where it lay on his cheek and then pressing something into it. Draco’s fingers closed around the Snitch and he looked back up at Harry with a soft snort. “I keep my promises.” Harry winked.
They both look around as the server bustles over, placing a plate loaded with fried eggs, sausages and tomatoes in front of Malfoy, who immediately hunches over his plate, picking up his knife and fork. Harry wraps both hands around the mug of black coffee set before him, head tilted as he watches Malfoy spear up a slice of tomato and shove it into his mouth before immediately following it up with half a sausage.
“My date for the night,” Draco says loftily. “How do I look?” he hurriedly takes off his jacket, throwing it to me.
“It’s the ancestral Black home,” Potter informs him with a snort. “You sort of have claim over it too, I suppose.”
Hermione slanted them both a look. “I heard a bunch of seventh years laughing about it in the common room.” And before Harry could ask who they were, she added, “Harry, look, if you’re
Lifting up in a high arc, neck strained and throat raw with how loudly he’s shrieking, Draco sinks his nails into Harry’s back, ruthlessly breaking the skin, and comes harder than he ever thought it possible. Harry’s emitting some sort of barking snarl as he watches Draco unravel completely, flying apart while simultaneously imploding underneath him, his rosy cock shooting a long stream of come that hits Draco’s bobbing Adam’s apple in a messy white splatter.
any other options, Auror Potter,” said the senior Healer, sounding more severe than sympathetic now. “This is ancient, irreversible magic and the hex has likely woven itself around your bones by now. There is nothing you can do but...wait.”
The bed is thrown into the wall with each thrust now, and Draco is done; he just physically is not capable of holding on any longer.
Shuddering, Draco stirs feebly, stretching his legs out as his cock plops in a sticky mess onto his thigh. Potter lifts his head to peer down at him and then yelps as he’s promptly dragged back down by the hair so Draco can sink his teeth into his lower lip.
“What do you mean, why?” Harry says gruffly. “It’s your birthday and the others aren’t here yet so I thought I’d dance with you.” He forces himself to release Malfoy and step away. “Unless you’d rather dance with someone else; go home with them perhaps?”
For one heart-stopping instant, Harry braces himself for Malfoy to simply blurt it out. They hadn’t spoken about this – about telling Malfoy’s parents about them, about the baby – what with the sudden turn of events since Ron’s Floo call and Malfoy’s complete refusal to talk afterwards. Harry has no idea suddenly of how Malfoy intends to do this, and while he has nothing to fear, not really, he finds himself holding his breath as he looks from Lucius’ hyper-suspicious glare to Narcissa’s keen, slightly confused expression.
hasn’t made to touch Draco the way Draco has been fervently wishing (sometimes signalling) for him to for
I’ve left my wand somewhere on the sofa and so I snap my hand to wandlessly block his Stinging Hex, staring at him in shock. He follows with one more, which I dodge, approaching him as I do. He throws out a third one which flies over my shoulder as I finally reach him, snatch his wand from his grip and fling it, with all my might, across my flat. I hear it clatter to the floor somewhere in the kitchen.
Draco hardly registers the pleasantry. “I want to help you,” he says abruptly, half shouting it into Potter’s face.
I finish my smoke and grind it out on the wall behind me. He eats another chip, sucks the salt off his thumb, pulls out another one and steps forward, holding it up to my mouth.
Harry laughs quietly as Malfoy sighs once more and tucks himself into Harry’s side, his breathing evening out in seconds to the deep, steady pulls of sleep.
Groaning and sinking his teeth into Draco’s neck, Potter follows, his arm buckling as his hips shudder heavily and finally still, his cock pressed impossibly deep, the hot gush of his release making Draco moan tremulously as he rides out the last of his own orgasm.
“Malfoy.” Harry settled his hands over Malfoy’s hips once more, pressing him down gently while grinding upwards – a silent plea. “Oh, god.” Harry’s eyes rolled back as Malfoy, bound hands braced on Harry’s chest lifted himself up briefly before sitting back down forcefully.
. Draco feels separated from me suddenly and it’s only now that I become aware of having thought of him as being
If Malfoy was as surprised as Harry was at the relatively content silence they ate in, he didn’t show it. He ate very slowly, and left the crusts, but when Malfoy set the empty plate down, Harry thought he didn’t look quite so eerily pale as he’d looked before.
Harry was sweating now, trickles of it running down his face and neck, dripping along the nape of his neck and down his back. He felt cruel for the way he ignored his own need, his poor cock straining for some sort of touch; he was worried he’d barely last once he was inside Malfoy.
“Are you sure there’s another box?” I ask wearily, peering into and then pushing away yet another box of books.
Malfoy blinks up at him a moment before getting up, rolling his eyes, and walking over to the armchair, sitting down and immediately drawing his legs up, curling up primly and holding his mug on his knees. Harry stands there a moment, staring down at him; the mildly sweet, but somehow shockingly exotic scent of Malfoy had assaulted his senses the second he’d walked into the ramshackle old building, but it’s not until just now, when Malfoy had brushed past him that Harry properly registers it again.
“And this,” Granger gestures to the sparkly contents of the bowl, “You’ve mixed in powdered silver with chopped--”
Malfoy’s movements are no more than a light gyration against Harry, but at Harry’s words, he goes still, standing there with his elbows on Harry’s shoulders, expression wary and closed off.
His thighs were pale and smooth, nearly hairless, his calves shapely and tight, the hairs on them golden, nearly white. His ankles were bony, the arches of his feet deep and his toes slim and slightly crooked.
Draco pauses as he automatically follows his mouth. “Did you...say something about the Imperius just now?” he asks slowly, thinking back a few minutes.
Unable to form words yet, Draco sips some tea, staining the handle with chocolate before he instinctively licks his fingers clean, right over where Potter’s tongue had touched him, warm and very wet. Across the table, Potter inhales sharply.
I think about it for days and weeks and months and years to come. He says those words to me again of course, always hesitant and self-conscious at first, until he grows into it and graces me with them regularly, consistently, like one might say hello and goodbye.
That’s when he hears the Floo flare, the bell above the hearth tinkling merrily, followed by the sound of Caesar’s meow, one long, loud meow, broken with each bouncing bound of his as he, presumably, leaped out of the armchair he’d been curled up in and ran towards the visitor.
--” The wet sounds his hand made were obscenely loud now – he stroked even faster, arching up into it. Sweat poured off him and his hair clung to his forehead, his back sticking to the wall.
? How long d’you intend to be this way? Forever? Do you seriously have the energy to be such a complete piece of shit
Maybe one of the effects of the hex was that he’d never enjoy sex again, even while remaining permanently hard. He can’t think of any other reason as to why he
I finally find him again, his bright head of gold shining as he reappears on the other side of the room. He saunters up to Tristan who’d until then been looking around blankly, tapping him on the shoulder and leaning up to say something (incredibly charming, I’m sure) into his ear.
Draco sighs, picking up his wand and dragging a hand through his sweaty hair. “I was seven and Father finally gave in to my relentless begging and bought me a Crup,” Draco says, rolling up his shirt sleeves and not looking at Potter. “She had black fur, was terribly moody and slept right on my chest most nights.”
fancy,” he says, looking smug. “Do you know what this is?” His smirk widens when I shake my head. “Fortescue’s made ten tubs –
!” Draco bellowed, following it with a kick to the door. There were hurried footsteps and then silence.
Draco planned for it to be an event that would forever be imprinted in their guests’ memories—glittering and classy, catered by his favourite French restaurant, house-elves bearing trays of tastefully presented hors d’oeuvres, timeless tailored robes for Harry and himself and champagne by the crateful all accompanied by some carefully selected classical music tinkling prettily in the background.
“Indeed it doesn’t,” Draco says, pleased. “The moonstone is what makes it cold, it’ll help regulate your body heat. What else?”
Draco realises he’s been staring and quickly looks away, cheeks heating, just as Kreacher comes up and carefully lays a cup of tea in front of him, the china surprisingly elegant, cream with rosy flowers painted under the gold rim. Potter is handed a humongous, steaming mug of black coffee, half of which he gulps in a single mouthful before croaking, “What do you want, Malfoy?”
Malfoy licked his lips again, squeezed his eyes shut for a few seconds before opening them with a soft sigh. “...Yes.”
“’bout half an hour ago,” Harry says distractedly, waiting until there’s a familiar jerk against his hand. He beams at Malfoy who simply shakes his head, rolling his eyes with a reluctant, beautiful little smile that makes Harry
Ron and Hermione don’t comment but Harry catches them exchanging knowing glances on more than one occasion.
He had the kids hold hands and covered them with the Cloak. When he looked across the clearing, Scorpius was watching with his eyes bugging out of his face, mouth hanging open. Malfoy was reading something, not even mildly interested.
“So,” Hermione says slowly, taking her own seat once more as Harry gets up and silently refills the goblet, setting it back down before Malfoy, “When did you—how is this—are you really a—”
He spoke as if being bent was an incredible privilege that Malfoy very much doubted Harry, unlike Malfoy himself, had been blessed with. As if Harry lacked some sort of prerequisite quality and wasn’t
“What’s happening?” Malfoy cries out weakly, bewildered and frightened – and Harry can feel it too. He can feel his prick growing, thickening impossibly wide at the base, can feel the way Malfoy’s rim is stretching wide around it, tensing around him and squeezing.
Harry threw the receiver back onto the base and went back to his Earl Grey, somehow thoroughly irritated with that smooth voice.
It’s the most intimate Draco has let himself get with anyone and so the knowledge that they still haven’t addressed what Harry had revealed is a constant thorn in Draco’s side. He doesn’t, however, have it in him to bring it up, Harry’s expression of shameful defeat from that evening still fresh in his mind.
With a loud gasp that made Harry shush him in panic, Malfoy sat up, eyes wild as he looked around in a daze, shivering as the water soaked him right through his thin hospital issued pyjama shirt.
awful, ‘Mione,” Harry admits, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes and rubbing vigorously. “I’ve barely slept in over three weeks, I can hardly think half the time with
“Fuck off.” The fondness in my voice isn’t unusual but it unnerves me anyway – I’m terrified that he might figure out how I now feel.
Potter sits there, sandwiched between Weasley and that Mudblood, both hands wrapped around his pint, laughing along with his friends and his
Harry’s mouth tilts up on one side, gaze turning warm again as he glances at Draco and shifts so their shoulders brush. “Well, I’m not lonely right now.”
Harry snorts, shaking his head as he takes a long gulp. “No, I usually stay over at Ron’s parents’; we all do,” he replies, squinting slightly as the strobe lights hit them in the face for a moment before sweeping in a wide arc over the club.
Across from him stood a tall, thin figure. He was cloaked. Harry’s nerves would have prompted a violent reaction from him had the cloak been black instead of the deep green that it was.
“Hey, we’ve barely snogged today!” Potter says with a faint laugh that promptly dies out when Draco glares. “We won’t snog anymore during practice, okay?”
I’m considering just breaking up with him via a note – real classy, I know – when there’s a creak from his bedroom.
Turning his head slightly to be able to wrap his lips around the head, Harry sucked it into his mouth with a noisy slurp, salty-sweet precome spreading over his tongue as Malfoy’s hips lifted off the bed and his hoarse gasp rustled over Harry’s skin, making the hairs on his arms stand up.
“How about I ask him to join us all for a pint the next time I spot him at the gym?” I ask casually, Draco immediately scowling at me as I sidle up beside him and rest one elbow on the bar.
“Draco is pregnant,” Harry says plainly, shocking himself even as he speaks. Malfoy’s neck clicks with how fast he turns to glare at him with his teeth bared and his eyes bugging out much like his father’s had a minute ago.
Potter laughs, head thrown back, Adam’s apple bobbing, shoulders bouncing; then Potter’s arm slides off the back of the sofa and his hand, warm and heavy, lands on Draco’s knee. “You know I’m teasing, right?” He cocks a brow, expression playful, eyes bright. “You can go ahead and insult me a few times if you like, I don’t mind.”
“His boyfriend told him he loves him,” Seamus says sombrely. Zabini’s dismissive snort goes on for a full three seconds and Draco sharply pulls his tumbler up off the bar as if afraid that a stray booger might land in his drink.
The following week, Draco worked late almost every day. He was used to leaving Mungo’s by five—latest six—every day, and going home and attempting to cook dinner until Harry got home and salvaged it, or simply waiting for Harry to get back, meanwhile reading or watching TV.
The old building is even grottier and more derelict that Harry remembers it being and he realises in hindsight that he ought to have checked this place first thing, three hours ago. Ignoring the grizzly old witch on the ground floor, sitting at her window and staring curiously at him, Harry flings open the rickety front door, nearly pulling it right off the single hinge it’s hanging dismally from, and hurtles up the stairs.
Scorpius grinned and then let out a little giggle. “Bugs,” he said. “I don’t mind some raisins. I like trying new foods. Father says he didn’t like many foods. But Mother always said that if I didn’t try new foods I would be left eating toast three times a day for the rest of my life.” He shook his head, looking serious. “That’s a lot of toast I’d be eating, Mr. Potter.”
Two weeks after the first incident, and Ron was already telling Harry that it felt like sixth year all over again.
I don’t finish what I was about to say but Ron is already looking at me with that overtly knowing look on his face. “Like the ferret?” he rubs in.
“Not actively.” Harry slid his thumb over the head, gathering the precome and spreading it around in a quick circle. “Are you alone?”
Draco grits his teeth, turning around and marching up to the room, pushing open the half-shut door and glaring around at the Golden Trio of the wizarding world.
“Well, you wouldn’t let me ask Hermione about the gender,” Harry says sullenly. “It’s really rude calling the baby ‘it’.”
sweets and clothes and—and—” He inhales deeply, his palms and temples starting to bead with sweat, his gut twisting with the way his insides burn scorching hot. “Go knock up a whole bunch of people, Potter! Start a fucking collection of us, why don’t you? A collection of one-night-fucks! Then we’ll all gather in here every night and sing songs about the wonder that is Harry Potter with his super magical, Alpha sperm!”
“Were going at it like rabbits?” Draco scrabbles for his glass but Ron manages to drain it in a single gulp, grinning through the shudders as Draco glares.
something, you fucking oaf!” He thrust up again, violently, with his teeth bared at Harry and hands thumping painfully into Harry’s shoulder blades as their cocks slid together.
Silently unravelling, mind and soul, Draco breathes in and out, deep and deliberately, forcing himself to maintain eye contact until he’s able to think through the hoarse roaring in his head. Potter gazes back at him, blinking slowly, and Draco is suddenly hyperaware of the way their thighs press together, warm and firm.
With a smile that probably made him appear nauseated, Draco carefully placed his long, white hand in Weasley’s and shook it weakly.
He knew the exact moment Harry conjured lube into the whole mix; he felt the sudden coolness of it, and then Harry finally pulled his tongue out, added another finger to replace it and scissored them all at once. Draco thrashed as much as he deemed prudent for a person standing balanced on one leg, and at that point, Harry looked up.
Ron sighs. “What did the idiot do this time?” he asks, sounding all patient and parent-y. “Did he hex your name-plate on the door to ‘Happy Potty’ again? He hasn’t done that in a while now.”
I turn back around and then wish I hadn’t. He looks crestfallen and I fucking hate it when he looks like that.
And then Malfoy sagged into him, completely collapsing and letting every last ounce of his weight rest on Harry. His arms fell limply next to them and Harry’s cock fell sadly out of him, sticky with his own come. Malfoy panted roughly, quivering atop Harry for several more seconds before he finally slid off Harry with a low groan, throwing himself beside him so they both lay side-by-side, squashed uncomfortably into each other.
It’s a Muggle club but it’s still laughably easy to point his wand from under his sleeve and send a sharp Stinging Hex to the bloke’s groin.
Half an hour later, Draco is almost completely drenched and has to wrestle Scorpius out of tub again with a towel-bundled Lyra tucked against his chest.
“Nobody can ever be completely sure when it comes to something like this!” Weasley says with vehement exasperation. “Even
“Fuck,” Draco mutters, hurriedly catching himself with one hand on the wall, the alley swimming around him as that last tumbler of scotch finally hits him. The brick under his hand is grainy and unyielding, grazing the softness of Draco’s palm. Potter’s head bobs back and forth, his lips turning pinker with each second he spends ravenously sucking Draco down.
He lets out a derisive huff. “What? Not going to let me crash here anymore?” His eyes are still shut and his chest is rising and falling as he pants softly. “I just want to know what I did wrong,” he says suddenly, so softly that I almost don’t catch it.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice sounds very far away and Harry realises Malfoy’s watching him with an odd look on his face.
They both just stared at each other for a while, Draco with his mouth hanging open and Harry looking more and more apprehensive until, suddenly, he just screamed, “Well?! Will you fucking marry me, then?!”
Then, before he can so much as blink, I’ve turned back around, my hand clenched, shoving my fist so hard into his face that I hear a cracking sound as he flies backwards, sprawling onto the floor and lying there, motionless. I see blood on his face in the half a second I spare to glance at him before turning away.
“This pregnancy actually makes so much more sense now,” Hermione says, “We thought Harry’s wolf element played a role seeing as he’s a Half-Blood but still managed to impregnate you. It’s likely your Veela genes that supported the pregnancy more than anything else. It’s also what helped develop and secure your womb this soon in a male pregnancy. While male Veela are incredibly rare,” she tells them, “
“You’re having my parents sent to Azkaban?” he asks softly, his tone so frighteningly frigid that the ball of dread slowly unravelling inside Harry’s stomach is suddenly exploding all at once, his blood turning cold in his veins.
Malfoy didn’t glare at Harry anymore; he didn’t spare an eye-roll when Harry was accosted by a bunch of giggling fifth years in the corridors or when meek first years requested him for his autograph. He didn’t ignore or avoid Harry either, no.
Sticky-eyed and still half asleep, Draco stumbles into the kitchen and stops short at the scene that greets him: Harry, a paisley apron thrown on over his joggers and rumpled t-shirt, standing behind the centre island and poring intently over a large cookbook. Scorpius, still in his pyjamas, is sitting
Harry turns his chair around halfway, so he’s able to look Malfoy in the face. “Are you alright?” he asks, voice gravelly.
backwards before Harry could even register what was happening, the sound of the boy’s skull knocking against the wall a loud thump in the quiet corridor.
won’t be indulging it such pointless frivolities, Potter,” he says loftily. “And stop calling it a ‘he’.”
He drank deeply, downing two glassfuls before pouring himself a third. Just as he threw another glance at the gauzy curtains that were drawn, he heard it – a soft, breathy little sound.
“Stop thinking about it,” Draco mumbles against his mouth when Harry whines softly into the kiss and wraps Draco up in a vice like grip. “Be here. Stay here with me. Stop thinking about it.”
Then Harry stirs, gently pushing away Draco’s arm slung across his shoulders so he can sit up and fix Malfoy with an impassive stare.
Harry sighs, untying his apron and flinging it over the back of one chair. “Do tell,” he invites wearily.
“Merlin, it was a nightmare,” Harry says and Malfoy laughs. “I think Parvati still hasn’t forgiven me for it.”
They pulled away and Draco’s heart sang in his ears, his chest rising and falling as they beamed at one another, both of them completely out of breath, Draco completely out of words.
Draco is properly blushing now, he’s sure of it; his face burns hot despite the frigid air and his stomach flops clumsily at the thought of being dragged into empty rooms by Potter.
, Potter!” Draco yells as the tears finally spill. “I don’t fucking know! My owls always come back unopened and I don’t know if they’re getting the letters and sending them back or if the birds simply can’t find them. I don’t fucking know and I have no way to find out. I don’t know if they’re even alive.
He was wearing his tightest pair of boxer briefs and Draco could clearly see the promising bulge of that magnificent cock of his, and he had one hand in his hair messing it up
Harry spent the remaining morning resting beside Lily. He felt shaken and drained. After he had put together another meal for the children, they wanted to go outside into the overgrown field. Malfoy quietly led them out and left Harry to shut his eyes for a bit; whenever he lifted his head and peered through the cracked entrance, he would spot Malfoy standing with his hands behind his back, idly kicking a stone or examining something one of the kids had found.
Harry presses the heel of his hand to his temple, his breath huffing out him choppily, something gradually tearing itself free inside him. “Malfoy, I really need you to stop talking right now,” he whispers, staring somewhere near his own feet.
“Papa’s up, actually,” Draco announces,  with an amused rasp. Harry and Scorpius’ grins are nearly completely identical as they look around at him and Lyra’s squeal is so high pitched that all three of them wince. “Hello,” Draco greets, tousling Scorpius’ hair on his way to pick up Lyra.
Malfoy in turn keeps his word and brings his fully packed and shrunken trunk with him, barely looking at Harry, having hardly spoken a word to him since the previous night. He’s dressed in neat, voluminous robes in a sombre grey and wears his hair in a severe knot at his nape, his face worn and tired, mouth tightly pressed into a thin line.
“She’s hoping either you or I will go out with him,” he chortles. “Their mothers are close!” he adds, as if that explains it better.
--” Malfoy breathed his name into his neck over and over again, his thighs visibly trembling from exertion. Harry could feel hot tears in his crook of his shoulder, running down his skin and onto the sheets below. His fingers clenched into the soft flesh of Malfoy’s
to be found, over and over again.” Malfoy looked so scornful and disgusted that Harry half expected him to punctuate his speech by spitting on the ground.
Over the next few weeks, Harry’s cool acceptance of what had occurred turned into a giant knot in his stomach that eventually
Draco blinks as he kneels there in front of him, his own cock tenting his pyjama bottoms, wondering whether he should shrug and brush aside whatever the moron is apologising for, or whether he ought to milk Potter’s contrition for all its worth and make him suck Draco’s cock.
a better place for you to live in while pregnant,” he says softly, “I swear I’m not doing it just for the baby. Nobody deserves to live the way you were living, Malfoy. And I’m so happy you agreed to move in here. Even though it probably killed you just a little bit to let me help,” he adds with a knowing chuckle.
--and then, literally out of nowhere, he let out a little snort, his mouth turning up at the corners before he looked away, shaking his head with his eyebrows raised in exasperation.
“What just hap—?” Draco, still panting noisily, turns and leans most of his weight on the door, feet slipping forward as his legs nearly give away. Potter appears terrified as he gapes at Draco’s stomach and after a moment it hits Draco. “No, what I meant was—” Draco starts, throat rasping dryly as he pulls in lungfuls of air.
“Young Master Black cannot!” Kreacher looks absolutely horrified, “Young Master Black will surely suffer a gruesome, painful—”
Potter doesn’t say a word and when Draco tries to get up, he realises their hands are still wound together. When he tries to pull back, Potter’s grip tightens.
Harry sinks down onto the bed, elbows on his knees, his face in his hands as he lets out a long, tortured groan on a weak chuckle. “Why am I not even surprised? I’m
Ron looks highly sceptical while also looking slightly grossed out. “So, until tomorrow morning, then?”
“You should eat something,” Draco whispers hesitantly into his hair after a solid twenty minutes of silence.
“Something like that,” he finally says calmly and Harry blinks in shock. “You kissed me back last week,” he adds.
is burnt out by the same fire that has been threatening to turn Draco’s insides to ash for what feels like several lifetimes now.
The teacup rattles noisily on its saucer as Potter sets Draco’s tea beside his place. “Um,” Potter’s voice is rather high, “That’s okay, Malfoy. I got them for you. Kreacher said he’d put a Stasis over them so they’d stay fresh for however long it takes you to finish them.”
“Are you going to stand there all day, then?” Potter finally asks, and Draco is a little relieved to see that crooked smile, to hear that wry tone.
, but I expect a quality present, Potter,” Draco said, sniffing snootily before immediately ruining the effect by planting a wet kiss on Harry’s cheek.
Suddenly, Draco’s slightly glazed gaze shifts from Parkinson right on to me as though he’d known all along to find me standing here. The way his eyes light up, the sheer beauty of the smile his face splits into, has me on the verge of turning around and bolting out the door and running as far away from him as my legs can take me. He slides off the stool, Tristan’s arm slipping off him, and he strides up to me, shaking strands of his glossy hair out of his shining eyes.
Unable to move his hips anymore, Harry simply presses in as deep as possible and empties into Malfoy, crying out in broken snarls, his clothes drenched in sweat at sticking to his helplessly quivering body. Malfoy’s back arches upwards as he stiffens, his head dipping low, and Harry opens his eyes to dimly find himself with his nose pressed into Malfoy’s soft, sweat-soaked nape. Tilting his head, Harry clamps his teeth into it, Malfoy’s yowl sounding from somewhere very far away as he locks his jaw and surrenders to the nothingness that envelops him.
James stirred – or rather, he kicked out wildly and woke up Albus who immediately sat up and kicked him back.
“I mean, it’s the least he could’ve expected,” Ginny says flatly, wiping her cheek with the back of one hand and leaving a huge smudge of mud on it. “Didn’t exactly fight alongside us, did he?”
“I am, indeed,” Draco replies lightly, clipping his cloak back on. “I was hoping to actually stop by on my way
“Wait--!” Harry scrabbled around wildly for Malfoy’s wand, finding it beneath his perfectly round arse. He switched it to his right hand and blindly threw out privacy spells followed by a silencing spell. Dropping it somewhere behind the pillows, Harry looked down just in time to see a drop of his blood plop down onto Malfoy’s cheek. Malfoy, wide eyed, leaned up and ran his tongue slowly over Harry’s lip, lapping at the blood and then licking his own lips clean.
as was his wont, and his body was chiselled and tanned and tight with muscle, and to top it all off his green eyes were soft and pleading as he gazed meekly at Draco.
at Draco like it’s no big deal for him to be cooking breakfast in Draco’s kitchen after having, presumably, spent the night in Draco’s bed.
After Potter had pulled his shirt back on, leaving it untucked and pressing Draco into the brick wall to kiss him some more, he’d whispered against Draco’s mouth, “So, what d’you think?”
“You didn’t have to,” Draco says hoarsely, peering closely at the face of the watch, the bright gold roman numerals shimmering through the glass, the serpent shaped hands wiggling as Draco runs a thumb over it. Wiping his cheeks with his napkin, Draco sets the watch down, his hands too unsteady suddenly. “I—I can’t take this from you,” he says weakly, shaking his head and pushing the box a few inches towards him.
Eight days he’d spent looking for the escaped werewolf who, as man, had gone by the name Trevor Markins. After he’d been bitten, given to the lack of immediate medical attention and too many full moons spent in the company of a particularly vicious pack of his kind, the wolf took over completely. Greyback had left behind quite the legacy, and while the Ministry managed to round up most of them, Trevor was one among the few particularly vicious ones still at large. And Harry had been dizzy with excitement to bring in the bastard.
at that, his mouth still fused with Draco’s, immediately grinding down. Sinuously moving his thigh back and forth against Potter’s erection, Draco lets himself be lost in the kiss for the briefest few moments before abruptly forcing Potter away with a hand to his face.
Harry quickly shifts to his left and cranes his neck to look over the crowd, spotting Malfoy in about three seconds; his hair appears almost white in the way it lights up under each colour of the pulsing lights, his long, pale form standing out like a beam of light of its own.
“They’re in the archives, don’t worry,” she rolls her eyes, “And stop changing the subject. I want to know who he is.”
“Jesus, I ought to have known you’d be a pervert on top of everything else!” Malfoy managed to drag the covers back up, thumping his hands down over his lap. “
Harry sighs and closes his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose, his cigarette dangling from his fingers. “No,” he sighs. “Of course not, you twat.”
I grab him by the collar and slam him into the wall so hard that he gasps in pain. But he has no time to recover from that because I’m already kissing him.
“You’re fucking welcome,” Harry said sarcastically when all Malfoy did was snort and pick up the shirt between the palms of both hands with a sceptical eyebrow-lift.
so that when he slides a hand between them and grips his cock, he’s instantly exploding into a spectacular orgasm, messily coming all over the place with several wild bucks up against Potter.
“You’ve already given me a birthday gift,” Harry says in surprise. “And they fit like a dream and don’t get any dirt on them. And also, my birthday was over a week ago,” he adds casually, grinning as he leans forward to nibble along Malfoy’s jaw.
Eyebrows flying up, Lucius sets aside his drink and sweeps over. “To what or whom do we owe this honour?”
“Yeah, until they realise they’re going to spend the next seven years smelling of dung.” Ron grins when Neville just sighs.
Instantly turning hot all over, Draco almost hurls the wooden box at him before turning away with a huff as a grin of mortified thrill spreads across his face. “
They entered the clearing to find all three boys crouched around Lily who was now sitting up and staring back at them in confusion. When the two men walked up, they got to their feet and Lily reached for Harry.
and sipping on his tea, darting frequent admiring glances at the ridiculously perfect V of Harry’s upper body disappearing into his joggers.
gave him diamond dusted dragon hide boots,” Draco says loftily, suddenly feeling embarrassedly materialistic as he says it out loud. Sullen and a bit resentful, Draco sneers before turning around with a flourish; his low ponytail whips around his neck and slaps him across the face. Weasley snorts and makes an odd choked heaving noise and Granger nudges him with one bare foot. Draco glowers.
“I found traces of syrup of hellebore and bitterroot in your blood, Malfoy,” Hermione calmly informs him, “along with...” she hesitates for a fraction of a second, and Malfoy’s breath leaves him in a rush as she adds, “Veela hair.”
“Good to know,” Potter says, his pleasant, friendly expression slowly melting off, replaced by annoyance. As Draco sits there debating a way to accept Potter’s offer while also insulting his hair, Potter makes to stand and, presumably, leave.
“What was that like, having some bloke dropping the L bomb on you?” Ron asks hoarsely while Zabini mournfully inspects the faded blue dishcloth he has tucked into his belt as he wanders away to another couple of beckoning customers.
you feel all right, Harry?” she’d asked repeatedly, until Harry and whirled around, glaring, the bulge in his jeans twitching menacingly at her.
Draco stares as Potter trails off, looking slightly sheepish but still mostly determined as he looks around Draco’s room once as if to draw some confidence out of the walls. “Okay,” Draco says.
“And why not?” Malfoy asks calmly, one eyebrow hooking up in his trademark insouciance. When Harry just chuckles and shakes his head, Malfoy goes on, “See now, there are a number of possible reasons why you don’t want to tell me.” When Harry just sighs at him with patient expectance he continues, “One, you’re lying, and you’re actually above and beyond terrible in bed.”
Malfoy was bent over him, frowning very lightly, and, from what Harry could tell, checking his pulse. When he saw that Harry’s eyes were open, his lips thinned and he shook his head.
I have no idea how long we stand there kissing except that we begin to attract a lot of protests. It’s only when someone, Parkinson I think, threatens to hit us both with Stinging Hexes, that I force myself to wrench my mouth away. I pull back and look at Draco; he’s flushed and breathing hard, eyes dark and twinkling, mouth red and already swollen. He’s pressed incredibly close, his arms tight around my neck, his champagne-scented breath puffing across my face as he stares back at me – he’s breathtaking.
A gasp tangled in his throat, Harry whirled around, a blast of red curse light shooting out of his wand. He had a split second to see the way Malfoy’s eyes widened before he threw himself out of the way, hitting the ground hard as the curse hit a tree and scorched a large, red-hot mark onto it.
“Yes, well, he probably wants to be fed now,” Draco picks up his wand and waves it in the direction of the kitchen, “Caesar, run along now, your bowl’s full.”
Harry’d only really ogled his arse these past few months; Malfoy’s trousers were rather well-fitting. He’d only ever noticed that Malfoy, when not glaring or scowling, wasn’t at all bad to look at - quite the opposite really. He’d only just silently accepted that he much preferred it now that Malfoy wore his hair loose and unstyled, so that it fell into his eyes, as if he was trying to hide behind it as he sat for hours at that corner table in the library, hunched over his books long before anyone else came in, remaining there long after everyone else had left.
I have the sudden urge to stand up and violently upturn the fifteen foot long table, half empty platters of food and all.
Harry frowns slightly but doesn’t comment either, setting Malfoy’s plate before him wordlessly, making a second trip for the cutlery. When Malfoy still doesn’t look up at him, Harry asks softly, “Earl Grey?”
“How does the powdered moonstone help?” she asks, gesturing to a bowlful of shimmery, white powder that’s sitting on the workbench.
Harry didn’t notice the empty classroom door cracking open just as Malfoy walked past it. And so when a hex flew out, sending Malfoy reeling forward, books and bags going everywhere as he went flying across the corridor on his front, Harry stumbled to a complete halt in shock, too taken by surprise to react even as three students toppled out of the classroom, hooting with laughter as they approached Malfoy’s feebly stirring prone form, wands pointed straight down at him.
on my birthday,” Draco explains. “The restaurant in Paris?” he adds when Granger simply tilts her head, still looking confused.
“I thought it made you uncomfortable,” Harry replies, and there’s no room for dishonesty in his tone. “I thought
“Don’t you judge me,” Draco snaps sleepily at Cairo when the bird’s huge, amber eyes land on Draco’s hand between his legs. “
him. And he’s yet unsure of the nature of their relationship to be able to confidently demand an explanation.
Malfoy’s eyes widen in slight shock before narrowing slightly. “Or three,” he shifts minutely closer to Harry, looking around casually as he says, in a low, husky murmur, “You’re worried that you might, oh, I don’t know, get me all hot and randy for you if you talk about it.”
“So I just have to cry more often to get you to hold me down and ride me like you’re trying to kill me?”
“Your father and I are taking the children to the Manor for tonight,” she answers crisply. “I thought you’d appreciate the time to clean up and rest a bit.”
Draco sucks idly around the sweet. “Did Potter tell you he bought Honeydukes?” Draco asks Granger who looks even more amused. “He bought me about twenty-five kilos of chocolate, Granger.”
Malfoy stares at him, bright eyed and straight faced, for several, lengthy beats. And then, to Harry’s utter shock, Malfoy bursts out laughing.
Harry of anything,” Granger talks over him, “It means that Harry’s magic, his physical strength, even his senses, they’re all actually
Loud, broken cries of pleasure being wrenched out his throat, Draco arches back as Potter’s free hand finds his cock again. Riding his fingers, completely off rhythm, and fucking his fist, Draco comes hard, mewling and bucking, nearly uncontrollable in Potter’s lap.
They’ve visited Granger for two more scheduled visits since their second and on the last one, two days ago, they’d watched their now significantly larger baby wiggle and squirm around as Granger had pointed out each new development, the flexing fingers and toes, the longer limbs, the stronger spine, the way it pulled little faces, and the way it seemed to just
“Rest,” he was ordered as he was pushed back down. “I’ll write you a prescription for some sleeping potions, seeing as you’re likely to have some trouble falling asleep with the...”
Draco, whom I love more with each passing day, is no longer with Tristan and also believes I am in a steady relationship with someone he thinks is the lowest, most repulsive creature to live.
Draco jumps slightly, slopping some butterbeer onto the sofa; he Vanishes the stain and takes another sip. “It’s going okay, I think,” he says, looking straight ahead at the TV. “Last week, he saw me eat a
Harry turns his head, vision swimming slightly. “Malf...oy?” he slurs, blinking in bewilderment at the long, pale form as he folds himself onto the stool next to Harry's.
With their respective new jobs and schedules it had taken them nearly two and a half months to finally find a place they both really liked and agreed upon and another six weeks to finalise the deal and finish moving in.  An additional month to finish setting up home and they were finally able to throw a housewarming party.
Minutes passed and Potter still hadn’t spoken. Draco was sitting close enough to him that he could smell Potter’s cheap Muggle deodorant, a smell that he most certainly did not find oddly erotic. When he stole a glance at him, he saw a single drop of sweat trickle down the side of Potter’s face. Draco could feel himself starting to sweat beneath his arms and resisted the urge to sniff his armpits. The crowd around them went on chattering and drinking, completely unaware of the enormity of the situation Draco was in.
“Don’t write me off just yet,” Harry grins back, “Not with Valentine’s Day around the corner. You ready for our first date?”
“I don’t care.” I feel relief coursing through me because as soon as I say it, I realise I truly mean it. “I don’t care. I don’t give a fuck about them. I love you. And you’re with
the one who keeps asking me to try being in a relationship for once, instead of sleeping my way around all of London.”
And Draco responds with all the vehemently reassuring fervour he can manage, slowly sliding Harry’s hot, naked weight off himself and rolling atop him, holding Harry’s face with both hands and grinding their mouths together in a slick, scorching kiss that intensifies steadily until it finally ebbs, both of them gasping loudly for air by the time they pull apart.
“Ugh.” Harry barely had a second to open his mouth before she was unceremoniously dumping the contents of the vial into it. Harry swallowed hurriedly, the potion burning its way down his oesophagus, and spluttered out a series of coughs as he half-sat up and leaned his weight on his left arm – it hurt a little to move his right – and accepted the proffered goblet.
to, but he smiles, cheeks still warm. “No, you really are an idiot to want to do this,” he informs Potter.
“’m really sensitive there,” Draco informs him weakly, his nipple still gleaming with Potter’s saliva.
“I just remembered, I’ve to be somewhere,” I say, pausing right in the middle of Diagon Alley, other shoppers continuing to hurry past all around me.
, bearing a large tray, elaborately laid with tea and cake, all four of them — Harry included — flinch. The elf squeaks but when none of them move or say a word, scuttles forward and sets the tray down on the coffee table. Then, as though thinking better of serving tea, it backs away and disappears with another resounding
not reason enough?!” Draco snaps, slamming the files onto her desk. “Why can’t people be more dignified? Merlin, it’s like they don’t possess basic self-control. Can somebody escort him out, please?” he adds in a bellow over his shoulder, as the delivery wizard starts screaming proposals at Octavia.
Once he’s sure that Harry’s asleep, Draco slowly gets out of bed, his spine and knees clicking as he stretches them out after a night of being tightly curled up under the furry weight of Harry’s wolf.
Draco’s heart is galloping furiously up into his throat as he becomes more and more aware of Potter’s touch – Potter’s
He can definitely hear something now – low thuds and dull, blunt scraping sounds. When he listens closer, he can hear a muted sort of baying, faint, animalistic moans of pain.
He looks like he always does when I’ve kissed him the way I did – eyes glazed over, lips parted, and the apples of his cheeks rosy. There’s also the barely-discernable glint of disappointment that I’ve been spotting in his eyes lately. Feeling guilty, I turn back to the curry, stirring vigorously.
He’d been in the middle of admiring the chiselled edge of Potter’s jaw when he’d roughly elbowed Draco aside, grabbed the tea and had informed Draco that he’s an arsewipe, before stomping away, leaving him pink cheeked, slightly out of breath and, for some utterly bizarre reason, more than a little aroused.
in here!” Draco said furiously. “I can’t believe he’s stealing all our things! He has his own fucking cage with a fucking custom made mattress in it and he’s stealing my designer clothes to build a fucking nest here!” Draco’s voice had steadily risen until he was screaming again.
“Tell me what your deal is.” Potter drags his jeans off and grasps his jutting cock; his glasses are smudged and crooked, his gaze fixed on Draco’s arsehole as he pulls them off and tosses them aside.
“Not tonight, Potter,” he says, and something catches in his throat at the way Potter’s face falls. “Tonight,” says Draco, “you’re coming to mine.”
Harry turned, already running. Ginny was on the floor, backing away, sliding backwards on her bum, her wand falling out of her hand as Harry watched. James pounced after it. Albus was howling, mouth open and drooling as he sobbed, clinging to the curtains.
“And mushroom risotto!” I say, still in that high-pitched voice. I set the platter down and go fetch the wine. “There’s chocolate mousse for dessert too!”
Potter seems rather amused. “Yeah, I, er...don’t need them anymore,” he replies casually, shrugging. “Enhanced senses and everything...” he explains awkwardly when Draco tilts his head questioningly.
“No,” Harry says calmly, looking around once more, just because he cannot bear to look at Malfoy for too long – the urge to touch him rises inside Harry like a tidal wave.
“No, you can wait until you open your gift tomorrow.” Harry settles down more comfortably, half his body still on top of Draco’s, his cheek pressed to the cushions. He tucks his arm under Draco, holding him close, loudly breathing in the scent of his hair. “You smell like Christmas,” he mumbles.
“Please what?” Harry presses, his own limbs breaking out in gooseflesh at the way his voice comes out a cruel croon; his cock is an aching weight inside Malfoy, his hips and back aching with how hard he’s pistoning in and out of him.
“The DMLE didn’t even know they’d left the country until I told you about this,” Harry hisses through clenched teeth. “This isn’t even a chargeable offence as of now; not until they’ve been found guilty of performing actual Dark Magic of some sort in the last ten years.”
!” Draco shouts at once, curling his fingers around the cool brass of the handle again, pushing himself up to full height. “I—I meant that I’m too fat to remain standing after two back-to-back orgasms,” he says quickly, pairing it with a wry smirk and a quirked brow.
And so the day after the full moon, Draco finds himself standing outside a truly awful looking mansion in Islington. The name Grimmauld Place brought about the same stirrings that the old house-elf had, and Draco is surprised as to how easily he’d found the place.
Harry gritted his teeth. He indicated to the boys to follow him and then stomped, ankle throbbing, over to the opposite end of the clearing. He shot a Cushioning charm over a small bunch of wild grass, and lowered Lily onto it.
Malfoy stares at him in silence, hands on his hips, slightly out of breath as he watches Harry coolly. When Harry then steps forward and yanks Malfoy to himself, his breath huffs out in a surprised burst across Harry’s face, though he still doesn’t say anything.
Then Draco parts Potter’s buttocks and sees for himself the dusky little hole there, nestled in a silken patch of soft hairs. Potter shudders and Draco can feel it all the way up to where he’s massaging Potter’s arse.
He runs. He streaks out of the castle, bolting towards the Quidditch pitch where he knows Team Gyffindor is still at practice. He nearly trips over and lands face-first in the damp grass before furiously waving Harry down from the air.
, right? We have been getting along.” When Draco purses his lips, Potter gives him a hint of a swift grin. “I mean, relatively,” he adds, waving a hand around, “like, compared to how nightmarish this could’ve been.”
“Is it really okay?” Potter asks, looking concerned. “Because I—Draco, I understand completely why you wouldn’t want people knowing-- you deserve
“It releases more of the juices,” Draco says simply. “The powdered silver then leeches even more of the liquid out, essentially dehydrating the wolfsbane but absorbing the essence that we require.”
“That’s it, give your prostate a little rub...” Harry’s hand flew over his cock now, his grip tightening every few strokes. He pulled at his foreskin, tugging it hard the way he liked before running two fingertips along the vein underneath.
with you!” howled Draco, drawing his wand and simply levitating the fridge out of the way, the huge mass of metal hovering precariously in the air, the electric cord strained, the plug nearly falling out of the socket.
you I wouldn’t. If that’s what you’re here for, to threaten me into keeping quiet, you’re a piece of shit.”
