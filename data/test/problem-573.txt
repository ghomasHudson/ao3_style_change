“We will, but with grandma present too.” I tell him. Then he sprints down the hall, presumably to go get Andy.
I nod uncertainly. He’s resumed his distant, polite, uptight persona, his mask back up and on show. He’s carrying a leather messenger bag. Why does he need that? Perhaps he’s staying in Scotland, and then I remember graduation. Oh yeah….he’ll be there on Thursday. He’s wearing a black leather jacket. He certainly doesn't look like a multi-millionaire, billionaire, whatever-aire, in these clothes. He looks like a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, maybe a badly behaved rock star or a rebellious quidditch star or a catwalk model. I sigh inwardly, wishing I had a tenth of his poise. He’s so calm and controlled. I frown, recalling his outburst about Blaise….well he seems to be.
No acts involving needles, knives, piecing, or blood.
“Mrs Potter, he isn’t alone.”
“Drink, now.” He orders,
Kate drops her blankets off her back and races towards me. She leaps on me and hugs me half to death. It's a good thing she is so light, otherwise I would have dropped her straight away.
“Show me how you stretch yourself.”
Suddenly we both become aware of voices in the hall outside his bedroom door. It takes a moment to process what I can hear.
“Yes.”
Okay, we are back to ‘Mr Malfoy’ now.
renders people speechless.
“You really are beautiful when you play.” I tell him. He smiles shyly and just continues hitting the right keys. The melody is soft and beautiful and very Draco. I lean my head on his shoulder and close my eyes, just listening to the music.
Tonight
As soon as we have both taken our first sip, we hear a crashing noise coming from the living room.
“You’re so tight. You okay?”
“Ahh yes right.” He darted over to the couch, probably hoping I’d sit next to him on it but I was still a bit angry so I took the chair. Which made him frown a bit.
“I told Hermione to tell you he was missing you.” She says with a small smile.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you! Harry you’re the best.” She wrapped her arms around me, as much as she could, with auror training I had grown up a bit lately, and squeezed me half to death.
“I’m babysitting my godson if you can’t see.”  I tell him and look down at Teddy. He’s almost asleep now, occasionally sucking on the bottle.
“We were just talking about holidays, Draco,” Mr Potter says kindly. “Theo has decided to follow Pansy and her family to Barbados for a week.”
“Harry? Draco?” It’s Hermione.
“Just because you can doesn’t mean that you should.” I’m getting quite angry with him now and he just seems to be laughing at me once more. He arches his eyebrow at me, a smile on his lips.
“That’s right, baby.”
“It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s something different for you to feel and experience. I know they’re quite brutal, and I do like that in a restraining device.” He smiles at me mildly. “Very effective at keeping you in your place.”
We apparate to grimmauld to grab a quick shower and change into clean clothes. Then we decide to take the floo from there instead of apparating, just to see how that affects Draco’s sickness. As we come through I look to Draco straight away. He looks pale and like he’s about to throw up again. He runs off, obviously trying to make it to the bathroom. Andy looks at me in concern and Teddy’s eyes are wide.
“Stop all what?”
He pulls me back into the kitchen.

“After everything that I did to her in school, after everything I said to her!” He turned his face away, “After everything my aunt Bellatrix did to her. She has a right to hate me and want me to have an awful life. I don’t blame her. I treated her awfully and she hasn’t got over it and she has a right to hate me.” He looked really genuine and it broke my heart that he could think he deserved this for being a bratty kid back in school and for things Bellatrix did that had nothing to do with him.
I don't even know how to categorise him. If I do this thing…..will he be my boyfriend? Will I be able to introduce him to my friends? Go out to bars, the cinema, quidditch games even, with him? The truth is I don't think I will. He won’t let me touch him and he won’t let me sleep with him. I know I’ve not had these things in my past, but I want them in my future. And that’s not the future he envisions.
“What do you mean?”
Harry glares down at me, and then his lips twitch up in a smile. And in spite of the fact I’m mad at him, my face is unwillingly pulled into an answering grin.
“You’re a virgin?” He breathes. I nod, flushing again. He closes his eyes and looks to be counting to ten. When he opens them again, he’s angry, glaring at me.
I let out the breath I’ve been holding and feel like the cold has slapped me.
“He’s hot.”
“Mother, this is Draco Malfoy. Draco, this is Lily Potter.”
“I was-”
I walk out of Ethan’s grasp, while Harry smiles icily at him, and I take my place at his side. Pansy grins at me. She knows exactly what she’s doing, the vixen!
When we are finally back at grimmauld, I lead Draco to the bathroom and light the candles.  He stands in the doorway and I wrap my hands around his waist and rub his belly.
“Why do you have to hide my things if I don’t put them away?!” I call the Draco, running back downstairs.
I smile apologetically at him and shrug.
My subconscious says.
“It’s a big step,” I mumble, and eat.
“No, you deserve a lot more for what you’ve been though. And me and Harry will gladly give it to you, as long as you continue to be our friend and help us when we need you. And of course we will do the same.” Draco says and strokes her hair out her face.
“The way you smiled at him, and he at you.” He stares at me and I try to look away, but can’t. He is so unnerving.
“Okay. I get off work at 8.”
He jumped up then, “no, I do Harry, really! Please go out with me Harry?”
Sev heads out. I glance nervously up at Harry. We pause briefly as a photographer comes up to us.
“Well we still have 20 more weeks to think.” He nods slowly and then the fireworks start and I open my eyes. It really is a beautiful night. The first half of this pregnancy has had its struggles and I’m sure the second half will have some, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.
“No.”
“Of course i do but…” he looks away and then carries on “I've never done this before, okay?” Oh. He looks so embarrassed but he shouldn’t be. So what? I’ve only done it a few times and I was pissed most of the time.
Where shall I meet you?
“Grimmauld was never your home, Norte coeur is.” He says and kisses me.

“Are you smoking again?!” She shouts down the line. Shit, well I was trying to be discreet. I take another drag and ignore her. “Draco, I thought you’d quit for good this time. You were doing so well. How long has it been?” 8 months since I last quit. I always end up starting again, but I too thought that was the last time.
“Dray? Your aunt and Teddy are here, can we come in?” He doesn’t answer and I frown. He was wide awake 20 minutes ago. I open the door and peak through, but Draco isn’t in the bed. Then I hear it.
Luna saunters back into the living room and hands us champagne flutes filled with pale pink prosecco.
We follow him through a plush seating area to an intimate dining room.
“That’s right, how do you feel about that?” I ask him. Andy has gone a bit pale and isn’t saying anything.
He looked at him surprised. Harry looked unfazed, still laying with his eyes closed and face relaxed.
He agreed, though he wasn’t exactly convinced. It was true that the weather was just amazing for the middle of October. And idea of the picnic seemed more than appealing, but idea of adding there more people than Hermione, wasn’t. He would gladly be there just with her, but at the same time it wasn’t big deal either.
“I can’t believe it was two years already,” he said. “Just four more years and my father will be out of Azkaban.”
His eyes were travelling around the room as he tried his best to not look at Draco, that was blushing like mad, sinking further into water.
“O-Okay,” he whispered.
“Harry? Did you do it?” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She does.”
There was silence on the other side, and he was sure that this telopophone thing was just a joke, but his aunt finally spoke.
He whipped around her to look at her perfectly composed face and gleaming eyes. She was mad at him.
“Thank you, Draco. I am so happy to have you as a friend,” she said, as she finally moved away, wiping away her tears.
“Yeah. It was.”
“Because you don’t deserve being treated like this. And they
“Can we go now? Before anyone sees us?”
She dropped her bag on the table, looking at him with accusatory look.
“Mm. I had the most pleasant encounter with our dear Savior of the worlds and Mr. Weasley.”
“Well, you had a glimpse into his amazing self here and there, didn’t you. He was a bit worse than that as a father, I suppose. Very … demanding, and not taking
School year is slowly coming to an end, so Draco tries to use it the best he can.
“Think that you messed up anyway,” he finished for Harry.
“It is so sad,” he muttered. “I can’t imagine what mum must have felt. I would be devastated.”
“Yep.”
It felt so strange to be sitting in the Great Hall, having breakfast, not needing to worry about anyone’s nasty looks. People glanced at him here and there but were fast to carry on with their own tasks, forgetting Draco was even there.
“Sure, please.”
“Good we are on the same page,” Draco said.
There was a long moment of silence, that Draco decided to break. He didn’t want to think about anything of his almost pitiful life, things he could and couldn’t do, or the hunting past. He wanted to look at the very few semi-bright sides there was.
He just nodded, looking away from intense green eyes. He wanted to say so many things, but he found himself unable. It was as if they first met the previous semester, when he couldn’t let a single ‘yes’ slip through his throat. And now it was the worst possible moment. Because he wanted to tell Harry he
He thought Harry decided to drop the subject, as he let go of his wrist, but it became soon obvious what he was doing instead. He showed Draco the top of his right hand, and something there that he never noticed before. It wasn’t like it was too noticeable. Harry’s skin was tanned, and pink of the scar, that faded much more in his case, didn’t stand out so much.
“I guess.”
He felt tears running down his cheeks. How could Harry say those things with such a peace. Was it the same when he talked about his future plans few weeks back? So bazaar, stupid and … sad?
“I … just like that? Without any reason?”
An amused smile tugged at his lips.

It wasn’t
Something slimy wrapped around his ankle, and Harry let out a shout, jumping away from Draco. They both looked down, eyes wide, then back up to each other. There was a brief pause, then quickly, Harry grabbed his wrist and they both hurried out of the water. When they made it back to shore—stumbling and falling in their rush, they were panting again, broken, half laughs occasionally punching out of their lungs.
A world he’d been brought into as a
“Is it that strange?” he asked, genuinely.
It was the perfect setting to rest—to think.
He stayed beneath the water until his lungs burned for air, and when he finally came up it was reluctantly. He could hear Malfoy making his way into the water as he pushed his wet hair back out of his face.
—could do wordless magic and make it look like child’s play,” Draco huffed, though Harry’s heart did a strange skip when he realized there was no real irritation in his tone. He watched as Draco pushed himself to his feet and walked over, slowly pulling on his trousers.

finally asleep—maybe it was all a dream. Yet, if that were true…why would he be dreaming about
Harry snorted softly and looked out to the water. Dark and unforgiving to those who trespassed with ill-intent. He wondered briefly if the icy water would feel nice on his skin. The weather was growing colder… He shook away the thought and closed his eyes. “I wonder why.”
It was quiet that evening. Moonlight shined down bright and glowing, the dark surface of the lake glittering beneath it. Wind blew gently, shaking the leaves of the large tree Harry sat beneath, his back against the old, thick trunk.
“Lake’s freezing,” he heard Draco mutter, nearly jumping out of his skin at how close his voice was. Harry spun around, only to find himself face to face with his ex-rival.
fault the dorm felt suffocating, or that it smelled of smoke and flesh, or that every creak of the floorboards sent his heart pounding.
Silence fell over them both, but it wasn’t awkward or tense like Harry thought it would be. It was strange. And slowly, the way they fell into such easy comfortability with one another in the freezing night quickly grew uncomfortable. Harry shifted, unnerved by how relaxed he could be with Malfoy beside him, staring at the stars—counting them under his breath.
His eyes went wide at the sight of Malfoy peeling off his socks, shirt, and trousers on the grass beside him already. Quickly, he turned back around and continued moving deeper into the water, a flush high on his face. The image of Malfoy’s pale, scarred skin danced in his mind as he ducked his head beneath the surface to wet his hair—eyes shut tight.
The grin that lit Draco’s face was absolutely

“I feel the same way,” Draco murmured, something telling in his voice that made Harry feel he understood what he’d truly meant. He breathed a sigh of relief, and wound his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him close.
Harry only shook his head, running his fingers through his own hair. Somehow, it was even more tangled now that it was wet. Harry thought that was wholly unfair, considering how smooth and neat Draco’s managed to look.
of all people?
?” he finally asked.
Briefly he wondered where in the hell his self-control had run off to.
Slowly, he dared let his gaze drift back to Draco. He must have ducked under the water before Harry turned around earlier, because his hair was wet and limp—just barely a shade darker—and pushed back, away from his forehead. The way it was held back by the wetness vaguely reminded Harry of when he used to gel his hair back.
“I wasn’t expecting you to actually join me,” he admitted after a moment of consideration. They only stood about waist deep, feet still able to touch the floor, and the wind chilled Harry’s upper body. Though, he was growing much more used to the temperature of the water, now.
“I hurt my back in the final battle. I fell from very high on my back. Didn’t feel how bad it was until the adrenaline wore off. Hermione says it’s chronic pain, or something. Might never go away. Only some potions and work outs are helping out, but flying on the broom is too uncomfortable and it hurts like hell. Also too risky, I should risk bigger injury with the state of it.”
“Couple of weeks ago. I told her I never loved her, that it couldn’t work. I told her that I had affair with someone and that I am supposedly gay, or whatever. She was mad, they all were mad. But they eventually got over it. Even Ginny decided it was better for us to go separate ways if I was to lie to her our whole lives.”
“I…please, tell them to go. Tell them I don’t want to see them,” he said, feeling his heart beating fast, breath erratic. He was so scared of what Ginny may do. More than anything he wanted Hermione and Harry with him now, but that was out of question. Their relationships were bound to end, so it didn’t matter it came to the halt so soon and abruptly. It hurt like hell, but it didn’t change anything.
“Where you off to,” the man from before asked, appearing out of nowhere.
“Are you going home for Christmas?” Harry asked after few minutes of silence following his story.
He was stunned, at lost of words. He thought that Harry just got him to the Hospital Wing to have him taken care of. But this … it was something he would never expect. Not only because Harry was just his friend, and he didn’t have anyone that would stand up for him, ever, but also because it didn’t sound like Harry.
Narcissa reached out a few weeks back, but he didn’t want to do anything with her. He was scared of his mother, no matter her apologies. He didn’t want her near himself for now. Though, he accepted the money she was sending every week. He wouldn’t say no to that. He was saving up for his own place, paid for healer appointments and did groceries, and pitched in for the bills. Aunt Andromeda kept refusing, but he knew he was enough of the burden as he was.
“I’ve learned about this place during our forth year. It was second task of the Tournament … and you probably don’t want to hear it. Sorry.”
He moved to Harry to hug him tight. The other did the same and soon enough they were laying in the warm sun again, but doing nothing more than hugging.
“It won’t be,” Harry said confidently.
He was silent, staring at his plate.
He was in middle of going over the material for Ancient Runes when Hermione came out of nowhere, holding a basket in her hands. She sat down next to him.
He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that it already has been two years.
“What are you taking on your NEWTs?” he said.
“Look what I’ve got.”
“Are you going alone?” he said.
“I know,” he smirked. “But I’m fine. I’m happy here. I will be starting training at the apothecary nearby. I’m saving up to open my own.”
“Is it Ron’s brother?” he said.
He looked away at the sight of Harry pulling off his school vest. He went back to sitting with his back to him, sinking into the water so much it covered his lips and almost touched the lower lip. He didn’t look at Harry even for a moment but he could hear him take off his clothes, walk and then sink into the water few feet away. Draco still stubbornly looked ahead of him.
No matter that it sounded like some ill-fated idea that Harry could come to regret in matter of hours, Draco decided to agree. This day was full of surprises, just so was this term from the beginning. Maybe it was stretching his luck and good fortunes, but looking at how his and Harry’s friendship was bound to end eventually, he decided to take the risk and cherish every moment he could.
“Here darling, I made you more tea,” Andromeda said, sitting next to him.
"You are different. I mean you are acting different. You are so quiet and deep in your thoughts. Did something happen?"
He walked Blaise to the Floo point, and they hugged before saying their goodbyes. He stood there for a moment longer, hating the idea of going back to the castle. It felt almost normal while having lunch with Blaise. He was his only old friend and meeting with him was so natural. There was nothing awkward about it, even though so much time passed. But now Blaise was gone and they probably wouldn’t meet before the year was over.
“I never told her, Draco. I promise you. I would never expose you like that. And I never thought it to be anything short of what it was. I’m in love with you, Draco. I think I have been since that day when we were fifteen. When we were partnered up at potions and you were so good at it, but still smiling gently and blushing whenever you did something good or Severus said your potion was the best in class.”
Anyway, TMI of today - I've got another plant baby, it was gifted to me for my birthday and on the second note - college is starting in three weeks though I vividly remember it being five months away (it's my first year, and no, I'm not that young, I 'should've' started it a few years back if I went straight after high school).
She was sitting in the chair pulled close to his bed, watching him with teary eyes.

“Did you have fun?”
“Draco? Is everything alright?” Harry said, softly. Just like Hermione, he appeared out of nowhere, startling him. But he just sat down in front of Draco, not willing to take the hint.
“And your elf too?”
He smiled sadly s Hermione started packing her things.
to have kids. Yes, in ideal world it was after getting married to the man he loved, but he never had it ideal or anything close to it. Having a baby and being a single parent seemed to be the easiest part of it all. The first part felt somehow natural. As shocking as the news were, they brought him some sort of comfort and level of happiness. It was the fact of how uncertain his future was, that scared him and brought everything to ground level.
The look Harry gave him, told him he had overshared and it wasn’t necessary to talk about his father and what controlling freak he was. But it was sort of look that was clear to be of concern and sorrow, that were only proved by a soft hug that he received from Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, we can talk,” Harry said. He had settled himself couple of feet away from Draco, turned towards him.
Harry was silent for a long moment, and he was about ready to apologize and just change the subject.
He didn’t notice how Harry moved closer to him, their faces just inches apart. He didn’t notice the hand that crept his way up, until warm thumb wiped away his tears, and the palm rested on his cheek.
“Yes, please.”
“I will pass.”
“She was Tonks’s mother, I’m not sure if you knew her, she was part of The Order. Also, she was Lupin’s wife. They had a son, Teddy, who is my godson. He is staying with her. They will be at Weasley’s.”
“Your friends are waiting outside, but I wanted to talk to you first, before they come in,” Mrs. Pomfrey said.
“Shh,” he whispered, kissing Harry’s lips softly. “It doesn’t matter, Harry. We don’t know what will happen in a day, or a week, or a year. As far as I am concerned I may be already disinherited. My mother didn’t send me a shortest note since I came here.”
“You know Aunt A hates it when you jump on the counter. You are running outside all days catching germs, and then you walk on the kitchen counter,” he scolded. Salem was uninterested in what Draco had to say, fixated on the fish that was soon presented to him. “You don’t even care, do you,” he sighed, petting the cat.
“Don’t say it, Harry. I would never think any different of you.”
He listened to more stories, saying something only when it was expected of him. Eventually, after biscuits and another tea, the lady, whose name was Mrs. Tilly, called him to the kitchen. She was standing next to the fridge, pressing buttons on a weird device that had string and sort of a handle attached to it. She held it to her ear and started talking, making him wonder if she was sane. It took him a long moment to realize that it was sort of a device he saw before. When he went to London with Harry, he saw few people with these weird rectangular things in their hands or held to their ears. They were either looking into it as if it was a magic box, or talking to it. If he remembered correctly, Harry called it telepophone. Device to communicate with other Muggles.
They reached the castle, panting and soaked to the bone. Few students, no doubts coming back from the pitch, came running behind them, but quickly passed to go further.
Remember that you are precious and loved!
With that she was gone, an he wasn’t sure he felt more pathetic in his whole life. He wanted to cry, but there was no tears left to cry, even if he tried hard. It felt like his life was falling apart, even though it was just starting, and things that he had to face now were nothing compared to what life would have for him in upcoming months, he felt.
“It is, because Sirius left me it. But you are a Black, even though partially. And this house lives its own life. If you only knew what it took to get rid of all the awful portraits, especially the one of Sirius’s mother. It’s as if I shouldn’t be living here.”
He felt so lost and lonely that not even Salem’s presence brought much comfort these days. He was in constant worry about the future, trying to figure out what to do, and constantly blaming himself for putting himself in such a position.
First two periods went by smoother than he thought. None of them were with Gryffindors, and none of his friends were in close proximity. Only when he was at the Library during lunch had he run into Hermione.
“Does anything help? At least a bit.”
, and he still couldn’t fully come to terms with it.
“Meet for a potion revision tomorrow,” he laid.
Harry stubbornly avoided his eyes, silent. Draco grew only more concerned. He moved closer and put hand on his cheek, nagging Harry to look at him, which he finally did.
“Okay your turn Draco.” She tells him when he’s finished buttoning up Leo’s onesie. He hands the baby over to me and starts to undress.
“You know this contract is legally unenforceable.”
“You feeling better babe?” I kiss the top of his head.
“Draco. What are you doing?”
“I don’t know.”
“I-I slept well.” I stutter my explanation. His lips try to mask his smile.
I eventually get him out of the bath and get him changed for bed. We then head downstairs to have tea. Andy’s waiting for us at the table when we come into the dining room.
“Why on earth would I be mad? I was sick of you coming back injured and you were constantly in a mood because your mind was always on one case or another. I love having you home. It might just be me but...well I think we have become closer these last few weeks.” He smiles shyly at me now.
I've never put myself out there, ever. I've had a lifetime of insecurities — I’m too pale, too skinny, uncoordinated, and the list goes on. But I’ve never even liked anyone, no one except for Harry bloody Potter. Maybe I should be nicer to guys like Greg and Blaise who actually want me. I bet I wouldn’t be sobbing into my knees if I had given them a chance. Maybe I just need a good cry.
After another half an hour practising things and teaching, I declare a break. We go inside to find Draco and Teddy so we can go to lunch at Whipped. Nia has cut down her hours working at Whipped and is just working lates now so she can learn magic in the day. She says she doesn’t mind and it’s keeping her busy, but I hope it doesn’t get too much for her.
Harry smiles at Severus and his eyes are dancing with joy.
“No answer sorry, but Draco said he loves you and hopes it goes well. And he told me to stay with you.” I tell her sweetly. Her face changes instantly to happy.
“I can see a head. You’re nearly there draco! 10 more minutes and baby chéri will be here” she says excitedly and stays where she is now, ready to catch the baby.
Oh shit. Less than an hour before the big reveal. My stomach suddenly drops again and I’m immediately nervous again. Holy shit, what has he got in store for me?
“Hello, st mungos, Donna here. How can- oh Mr Potter! Can I help you sir?” She perked up as soon as she saw who it was. But this time it didn’t annoy me because I needed to get Draco some help.
“Phew… I do love you too.”

“This is your punishment, so close and yet so far. Is this
“You okay? Do you need a healer?”  He takes a breath and smiles.
“So, a termite problem ey?” I smirk at him. I catch his lips turning up just before he turns back to the toilet and throws up some more.
“No, Draco. No Xbox. No PlayStation. Come.” He stands up and holds his hand out for me. He pulls me up and holds me close. Then he apparates us.
“Sorry Harry.” Katie whispers to me as I’m passing.
“I just don't think our relationship is going to go anywhere.” I stare down at my fingers.
“You okay Dray?” I ask him softly at the door.
“Yeah, she’s done so much for us lately and she’s still in the barn. We wanted to do something nice.” Draco smiles kindly and continues eating. Everyone seems to agree with this and carry’s on.
“I hope you like fish,” Harry says mildly.
“He’s my best mate ‘mione. We shared a dorm for years. I know him and I know he’s feeling guilty but he’s also sad. The things he said to me down the phone..” he takes a breath. “They were bad ‘mione. He didn’t sound like him at all.”
“Well I don’t know any gay guys around here and I only now one lesbian and she’s my ex. This town is not exactly in the 21st century yet but it's nice enough.” She's very friendly and chatty and I kind of like her.
Oh, shit. I blush.
“Please, call me Draco.”
“I’m going to throw my stomach up one of these day.” He says rubbing his belly, he then looks down at it and starts talking. “Please be kinder to me little cherry, you’re killing me here.” I chuckle quietly and get down on my knees. I place my hands over Draco’s and get really close to his belly.
“You mean the things you were forced to do as a child. No, I don’t think they are Draco. Come on, we have to go. I'll be with you the whole time okay.” He nods and takes my hand.
“I’d like to bite that lip.” He whispers darkly.
“This is lovely, thank you Andy. Thanks Teddy.” I smile at him and he gives me a cheeky smile back.
Holy shit. Harry’s mother. This is so much more than I bargained for. Perhaps meeting her will help put a little part of the jigsaw in place. Might help me understand why Harry is the way he is….Suddenly, I want to meet her. I pick up my shirt off the floor, and I’m pleased to discover that it has survived the night well with hardly any creases. I dress quickly, but if there's one thing I hate, it’s not having clean underwear. I rifle through Harry’s chest of drawers and come across his boxers. After pulling on a pair of tight grey Calvin Kleins, I tug on my jeans, after a quick cleaning spell, and my Converse.
The gates let me in, and suddenly I’m a teenager again coming back from hogmeads. I always feel the same wonder coming back to Hogwarts, but I don’t get to come as often as I would like. This was my first real home. It was where I first made friends. It was where I found people who cared for me. And it was where I discovered real magic.
Exercise - We agreed on three hours, this still says four.
I bristle at his insinuation. Pansy isn’t like that.
I’m like a small, giddy child. And all the contract angst fades. As I wash my hair, I try to think of what I could possibly ask him via email. Surely it’s better to talk these things through. Suppose someone hacked into his account? I blush at the thought. I dress quickly, shout a hasty good-bye to Pans, and I’m off to work my last week at The Hogs Head.
“Are you okay to travel by floo like this?” I asked, worriedly.
“I’m so glad she’s okay.” Draco says for the second time since I got home.
A nurse comes around the corner then and looks at her clipboard.
I haven’t mentioned this to him.
“Yeah he really would have.”
“It’s time!” She declares, coming up from under the sheet. “You’re ready to push!”
“Thank you.” He smiles at her.
“Do you think that would stop me?” he says softly, a sensual warning.
“Ron! Harry isn’t going to sleep with him on their second date!” She hissed. I decided I was going to make Ron pay for that.
“Just eat what’s on your plate, Draco.” He smirks and then his face turns serious again and his mouth sets in a grim line. “If you had eaten yesterday, we wouldn’t be here, and I wouldn’t be showing my hand so soon.” He looks angry now. I frown and return to my breakfast. It's cold now but dig in anyway. I look back up through my lashes and he looks like a little boy who’s sulking. I think it’s amusing and try to stop myself from laughing at him.
“Yes! I was the youngest seeker in a hundred years.” He says excitedly. I blanch.
“Then…” he takes his hand away.
“You’re welcome dear. I put some chocolates in for Harry and some sweets in for you. I know you have a sweet tooth.” We all chuckle and move on to the next present.
Pansy smiles, a wicked gleam in her eye.
“You’re late, I came to check you hadn’t blown me off, or you weren’t dancing in your underwear again.” He smirks at me.
“Yeahhh.” I say and rub the back of my neck. “Anyway, I’m glad your home safe, are you stopping for a cup of tea?” I ask to change the subject.
Harry Potter
“So you remember the nursery is closest to our room?” I ask Teddy and he nods. “Well we have put you furthest away from the nursery, so that the baby’s crying doesn’t wake you up.”
Nuisance
I squirm uncomfortably and bite my lip.
“I only saw the mergers and acquisitions one.”
We step out onto a grey flagstone patio area lit by recessed lights in the rocks. There are shrubs in grey stone tubs and a chic metal table and chairs set up in one corner. Harry walks past those, up some steps, and onto a vast lawn that leads down to the bay….wow - it’s beautiful. There are lights of a town or city on the horizon and the cool, bright May moon etches a sparkling silver path across the water towards the jetty where two boats are moored. Besides the jetty stands a boathouse. It is so picturesque, so peaceful. I stand and gape for a moment.
“Account?”

In such circumstances related to this, the Submissive may make use of a safeword (“the Safeword(s)”). Two safewords will be invoked depending on the severity of the demands.
“It’s shrewd business.” I don’t understand, it doesn’t make sense to me - feeding the world’s poor? I can't see the financial benefit of this for him, only the virtue of the idea.
“Hello Harry. I’m good thank you, not as bad as Draco with his morning sickness but it comes and goes. I was just telling Draco that I haven’t told a soul yet, not even Ron. I know not to tell anyone yet and i wouldn’t want to tell everyone your secret anyway. That’s for the two of you to share when you're ready.”
“Yeah and hopefully she won’t get woken up by a screaming baby.” Draco cuts in and everyone laughs.
When I wake, it’s still dark. I have no idea how long I’ve slept. I stretch out beneath the duvet, and I feel sore, deliciously sour, and realise Harry must have cast a cleaning spell on me. Harry is nowhere to be seen though. I sit up, staring out at London in front of me. There are fewer lights on among the streets, and there’s a whisper of dawn in the east. I hear music. The lilting notes of the piano, a sad, sweet lament. Bach, I think, but I’m not sure.
“Don’t pretend, please. I’m so sorry Draco. I know I always miss dinner, but that’s changing from now. I will try my hardest to be home on time from now on, okay?” I asked him and looked in his eyes to make sure he knew I was telling the truth. Draco stared at me and then more tears started rolling down his cheek like he couldn’t stop them.
“What?”
Next comes a surprise. Andromeda comes through the floo with Teddy.
“Your mind, no, Draco, but your body - that I’ve gotten to know quite well since yesterday.” His voice is suggestive. How does he switch so quickly from one mood to the next? He’s so mercurial….it’s hard to keep up.
“That’s not the point Draco! And you don’t know she didn’t hear you.”
“I’m not angry with you, I’m angry with myself. I just assumed….” He sighs. He regards me shrewdly and then shakes his head. “Do you want to go?” he asks, his voice gentle.
“Hello Harry, this is a beautiful home.” Luna says in her dreamy soft voice. “Lots of wildlife outside, including magical.” She looks at Nia and smiles.
“To Ron and Hermione! May you always be happy and healthy!” Draco speaks up then, surprising me. I smile at him and we all clink glasses while shouting.
“Where’s she going?” He asks innocently. I look at Draco and he looks hurt. Why is everyone taking this baby thing so hard?
As I open the door to mine and Pansy’s rooms, I see Pansy and Theo sat at the dining table. Pansy has the most ridiculous grin on her face, so unlike Pansy, and she looks mussed up in a sexy kind of way. Harry follows me through and Pansy, being Pansy, eyes me suspiciously in spite of her mussed up grinning look.
Ahh yes...Blaise. The words I will be having with him later.
He raises his eyebrows in surprise, then looks resigned, shaking his head.
We had locked the door on purpose so she could open it with her key, then we lead her upstairs.
“I...I thought he had told you.” She just shakes her head at that. I put my head in my hands and cursed myself. I’ve really screwed up this time.
“Oh no, she’s a hufflepuff from head to toe.” She chuckles and stares at the floor. I shake my head and chuckle.
Ron gets the beers out then and by the time I get home it’s way past 11. Hermione had long gone to bed and me and Ron had sat talking and drinking just like old times. I told him how the house was going, about Nia, about going to Hogwarts (which he was a bit jealous about), about thinking of quitting the aurors (which he wasn’t to happy about but he understood), but mainly we talking about our pregnant partners and how excited yet terrified we were about becoming dads. It was nice to talk to him again just us and we agreed to do it again soon. Maybe everything was going to be okay after all.
“I want you sore, baby.” he says, and he continues his sweet, leisurely torment, backward, forward. “Every time you move tomorrow, I want you to be reminded that I’ve been here. Only me. You are mine.”
That’s when I hang up the phone. He’s such a downer. And he still didn’t tell me about the books. I frown. Well I succeeded in one mission tonight — getting drunk. Holy shit, did I just drunk dial Harry Potter? My phone rings and I almost drop it. Witches and wizards around are looking at it strangely.
I hope you are having a fantastic day, decent at least, and as you always have to read to my rants, please - let me know how are you and what you are up to these days!
He caught the way Harry looked at him – maybe a bit concerned, sad. He wasn’t sure what it was, but certainly not positive emotions. He didn’t want his pity, but he wasn’t expecting anything else. He was unwanted by his own family. What news.
children, not care about high society bullshit, about pure-bloods
“I-I live here now,” he said quietly, finding his words. “Aunt A and Teddy are in London for Teddy’s weekly appointment. Sit down. Do you want something to drink?”
He wanted to roll his eyes and slide down the chair in the most dramatic fashion. He wondered whether Minister himself was coming, or he would have twelve different people to deal with.
“I am her nep … niece. I am her niece.” There was no point in proving the woman wrong. He did look more like a girl these days, no doubt. His hair was all grown out, and he let his mother take him to her hair stylist to have them cut just under his shoulders with some layers. And what he was wearing wasn’t exactly considered manly. To that, if he was really to stay there, he wouldn’t just parade around all pregnant, as Muggles weren’t exactly used to seeing pregnant men. So, for now, he would be considered a girl then. “I didn’t tell her I was coming. I … there was a bit of a situation, and I didn’t have time to tell her I would be coming.”
pregnant, they just look and treat you like a woman, basically. Especially in pure-blood families. They already treat me like one. There are either two roles in marriage and in this world. A provider, or a child-bearer. Guess where am I. My father is very happy, as you may imagine. Always was happy to have a heir to carry on family name and now, with me, Malfoy name is going to die in couple of years.”
“Fair well, I will do that. No need to get so flustered over it. But still, I think we should talk first.”
Even thought of such simple thing made a small smile appear on his face. Oh Merlin, when did he become so simple?
“I knew it. I said things I shouldn’t have,” Harry muttered.
It didn’t make it better at all, and he found himself crying his eyes out again.
“Oh. Okay. Are they here or can you sit with us for few moments?”
He didn’t even care for Harry sharing the bath anymore, too taken in by the notes. They were sitting in considerable distance from each other, both knowing it was better this way. Since they first shared a bath, it happened few more times, most of them after they ‘got together’
He knew it was this sort of feeling that no one else in the world could spark. That it was something that barely anyone in this world was lucky enough to know. But he knew it was not his to have. That it was his for only a brief moment. So, he made sure to rejoice the single moment he had.
“I’m sorry that he had to go so soon. And that it was because of my aunt. I wish you had more time with him…”
“Good,” he said, absentmindedly nodding.
They sat in the same spot as the last time, and Draco had to say that it was even nicer than it was before. With only Hermione and Harry he felt far more comfortable. He spoke much more, especially since Harry barely took part in the conversation, seemingly deep in his thoughts, spacing out many times. It reminded him of Luna sometimes, but there was so much hurtful feelings in his eyes, that Luna didn’t have in her.
He carried on with the task of making endless pancakes and eating a leftover cinnamon roll from yesterday that he reheated. One thing that happened in the past few weeks he was at his aunt’s, the morning sickness went away, and he ate everything in his sight and still had space left for more. Due to that, he gained a lot of weight. So much that he didn’t recognize himself in the mirror anymore. His face rounded up and so did the rest of his body. No more ribs were poking out, no pointy shoulders and collarbones. And his bum, hips, and cleavage just got crazy. The only thing that didn’t grow was his stomach. Other than few more centimeters that he gained around his middle, it stopped. He was concerned at first, but the healer assured him that baby was growing just fine and he had plenty of time to grow. Not that he minded any of it. As long as it kept his baby happy, he wouldn’t complain. And he was sort of happy too. He didn’t feel any of the awful tension that he had for months. Leaving his home did help.
He would have to find a solution. But for now, he had to come with terms that he wasn’t alone anymore, and it wasn’t only himself that he was willing to give up on anymore.
“Draco! You will not talk like this about your father!”
“Yes. I do,” he whispered.
Harry too must have sensed how tensed and nerve wrecked he was. He cocked his head, cheek resting on Draco’s leg, and looked at him with the warmest smile he had ever recived, green eyes so kind and caring, looking straight into his.
“It’s
“You can use Prefect Bathroom. No one goes there after nine thirty. Ron says they have a strict schedule. It’s the fourth door to the left of statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password is
She leaned in closer as if she was about to tell him a secret before she whispered:
“I have no idea. We don’t talk or exchange letters. He got it slightly better, I suppose. He surrounded himself. He went to the Aurors, and handed is wand. If it wasn’t for that, he would never see the outside, I suppose. He gets to have two visits a year, two hours each. It is always my mother that goes. He never asked for me. He hates me, actually.”
He walked to Blaise, meeting him in a midway. He grew shy suddenly, not really sure how to act, but it was quickly dismissed as the other wrapped arms around him in a tight hug.
“Grimmauld Place 12,” Harry said.
They ate their lunch silently, all of them having things on their minds that didn’t feel like sharking. Draco didn’t even find it in him to look up at harry as he usually would, instead just eating his sandwich with gaze fixed on the ground.
“Le l-lendemain à s-son réveil, elle aperçut le clerc sur la p-lace. Elle était en p-peignoir…”
“Are you crying?” Harry asked, softly.
. It was as if Harry expected him to be around longer, long enough to have him as a guest in his own house that could take ages before being properly livable and for people to see. Absolutely despite Draco’s wishes, he felt his heart swell and warmth spread in his chest. He wouldn’t mind sticking around more. And especially wouldn’t mind being frequent guest at Harry’s house.
“I canceled my lunch plans to come to see you. I know, I know, a perfect gentleman would make an appointment for a lunch date weeks prior, but I hope it isn’t a big bother to you? Otherwise, I shall leave and owl you about the more suitable date.”
It just didn’t feel real. It felt like someone else’s life. His was already planned. He would take his NEWTs, go back home, not stick his nose out of the Manor unless his mother decided otherwise, and marry someone of her or his father’s choosing. Then he would have a baby. If he tried very hard, maybe he would just never go back home, stay at someone’s place, looking for a job. In this plan, being pregnant and having babies was not in the picture, unless by some foul luck he would fall in love again, which was unlikely. He even considered this option, and already got in touch with Aunt Andromeda, asking how she and Teddy were doing, and exchanging few more letters. He had yet to make up his mind whether or not to beg her to let him stay at her place for some time.
Draco smiled faintly. He knew perfectly well that Ron thought that Harry was seeing his sister. That unwanted tightened in his chest happened, but he chose to ignore it. He wanted to enjoy this moment. It was first, and maybe only, time he could spend with Harry like this, so he wouldn’t let that slip or be taken over by the negativity. He would think of what a horrible person he was tomorrow.
Harry didn’t answer. He felt shifting behind and looked there just to find Harry laying on his back, hands under his neck, staring at him.
“Through the Floo. I already asked Headmistress to let me use it. I’m sure she won’t mind you coming with me.”
He blushed, embarrassed he was caught red-handed. And there he was, thinking he was being sneaky.
“We can go. We don’t need to be at the Burrow till four, so we have plenty of times. I was thinking we could go see a movie and then to the zoo? Or maybe oceanarium. Unless you want to do something else. Or just stay here. That’s alright too…” Harry visibly flushed, retreating a bit. If Draco knew better he would think that he got embarrassed for some reason.
“What’s
“What did she want?”
He left, without a second look, and ignored his mother’s calling as he made his way back to his room.
Draco frowned, trying to understand the riddle, but nothing came to his mind. He did know some French girls, mostly his very distance relatives that he got to meet on few occasions, but he never got to drawing any of them.
Not that Draco minded. If any of them were there, he couldn’t be closer than one feet to Harry. And he really liked the way Harry had his arms wrapped around him, while he leaned against his chest, between his opened legs as he was reading the book.
“That is very … informative piece of information. I don’t know how nobody told me this before.”
Harry nodded, and stepped away, giving him a tight smile himself.
He was visited by Headmistress, but she didn’t nag him after he said he haven’t seen his attacker. Which was almost suspicious if he gave it more mind.
“You didn’t know?”

“She isn’t wrong, though,” Neville agreed.
“He was my godfather, as you know,” Harry said, quietly. “At first I thought he did get my parents killed as everyone said, but he didn’t, and that you know too. I just … I got really close to him, even though we didn’t have much time together, and him being a bit out of it due to his isolation, having to stay put and in hiding. He was closest to a real family I ever had. He knew my parents, was close with them, and he kept telling me how I was just like my father. I think that’s what brought us the closest. Him and Lupin were closest to my parents, and it drew me in. Unlike Lupin, Sirius was very talkative and never shied away from speaking about them. I was looking forward to better times, to living with him in peace and quiet. For a long time, he was my only hope, you know. But once he was gone, I didn’t have this hope anymore. I felt left alone, and ready to die more than to win. But somehow I managed to do it, and made it out alright. I had half a mind of selling Grimmauld Place, or whatever wizards do with ancient, crazy houses, but I came around thinking that it was the only piece of
“Lying down is fine. But I couldn’t get much of it during classes, could I.”
I hope this chapter won't bore you to death and that you may end up enjoying it!
“But it wasn’t a dream. You defeated him. He is gone, and you have nothing to worry about.”
It was a weird thing, being alone. He got used to that over the years, especially when the war started, and then back at the Manor, following the events. But it was different. Back then he didn’t have so much on his plate, he didn’t … lose so much. He found it hard to wrap his head around the things that happened. He was no longer Hermione’s friend and Harry’s secret lover. Now, he was friendless and soon-to-be a single parent, which didn’t fit in his head at all.
The silence that fell after those words were so heavy and almost frightening. His mother’s face was even paler than usual, and when she started talking again, her voice was chillingly calm.
“Are you feeling alright, Draco? You are as white as a wall. I mean, you always were, but it’s different,” Blaise said, his voice heavy with concern.
“You are great in every other subject, anyway. And I think if you wanted to, you would become a great potion master, so who cares about some charms, right?”
He had dinner in the kitchen, with Salem hissing at Kreacher that was cleaning after cooking, muttering to himself nasty things. Draco quickly came to understanding that he wasn’t in his best mind, as he kept adding very nasty things after every sugary-coated line he spoke to Draco, as if he was forgetting he was talking out loud. He quickly got used to it but it wasn’t the most pleasant thing, especially since the House Elf was popping next to him every other minute to ask if he wanted tea, to bring the tea, to make the fire bigger, to run him a bath. Draco was used to House Elves. He was sure that to a certain point in his life he saw them more often than his parents. He even had his own one, Ana, that was always there to assist him if he needed anything. But Kreacher was making him almost uncomfortable. Not only with constant speech of ‘his mistress would cry herself into heart attack if she saw what the scum was doing with her house’ or ‘at least some decent blood is here to show the scum how to take care of the house’, but also with the fact that he was past his working years, but demanded to help him out with everything.
“But what about your roommates?”
It was still a bit cold, though. So he was wearing all of three layers of top, ending with orange sweater with yellow suns that Luna gifted him for last birthday. He did receive questioning looks for that, but no one asked.
Harry’s face didn’t light up despite the small smile that appeared on his face. He was taken aback, not sure whether to agree or just leave. It was few hours before the curfew, but it didn’t change the fact that it was Harry, of all the people. And it was what decided.
“What are you talking about?”
“Oh. I know what Titanic is. My great-grandmother was taking that cruse. Didn’t make it, though .”
Harry captured his lips in yet another kiss, guiding him to lay down. It was truly the most amazing feeling. He didn’t care that their clothes were flying off the bed, he didn’t care about the lips and hands travelling all over his body, touching places no one has ever touched. Everything he felt was immerse pleasure, but also the feeling of hot love in his chest, that made him want to burst from the intensity of it.
Author! <3
“You said not to say anything, I didn’t.”
He felt small blush on his cheeks. He almost forgot about that. Blaise wanted to marry him. It all came out of the blue but was no less real.
Andromeda knew about Harry. He had told her the same evening he came to live with her. He couldn’t contain his emotions, crying like he hasn’t in years. She didn’t judge him and she promised to keep his secret.
Harry moved closer to him and the next moment, their lips were joined together, moving slowly and shily, barely touching in the beginning. Harry’s hand rested on his cheek and his travelled to wrap around Harry’s wrist, as if he could keep it there longer. Draco was never kissed before, but he thought it to be the most amazing and romantic kiss imaginable. It was slow and sweet, lips moving together in sync, brushing against each other with more confidence after few passing moments. He felt closer to Harry than he ever did, in the way he always wanted to. It was like a comfort blanket that  someone laid on him suddenly. He didn’t feel sad or unhappy. In fact, he didn’t feel anything other than excruciating love. His heart was beating fast and he felt the most pleasant sort of warmness in his chest and limbs, rush of blood the audible only thing in his ears.
Hermione nodded, even though it was obvious she didn’t believe him.
“Can I sit here?” Harry’s voice startled him.
“G-Goodbye,” Draco said.
Luna has gifted him with the most extinguished, odd looking, and colorful scarf he had ever seen. It was thick and long with colorful tassels on each end, whole made of small patches of different colors of yarn, each seemingly different color and shade. He decided it was nothing compared to the present he gave Luna. His set of handmade sunflower jewelry he purchased through Owl Post and book on Muggle mythology was appearing blandly now.
“Draco,” Harry said softly, in attempt to start his rant that was getting him dangerously into bad headspace.
“I know, Hermione. And I did buy it, so don’t worry.”
“Yes. I’m excited.”
“First of all … being pregnant? You? What the hell?”
Harry looked as if he was thinking hard about something before he spoke again, this time looking at him.
“Sorry to hear that. I thought you would be civil.”
They collected their things and were soon on their way back to Hogwarts. As they made they way up the path, more and more people came to view, some giving them looks. Draco didn’t like it all. Well, not exactly them, it wasn’t even about the way they looked at the two of them. It was about the fact that he had to be so distant from Harry whenever people were around. They could be close only in the safety of seclusion because Draco was, well, a second person. Harry already was in the relationship. And it perhaps helped that he couldn’t go to the Great Hall, because it limited the time he saw Harry and Ginny together. And the few times he did see them, it hurt worse than anything he had ever experienced.
He knew that coming back home would be hard. Harder than any other year before. Maybe even harder when the war was going on. Back then he had no one but himself to worry about, and now, it wasn’t only his future that was uncertain. He had someone very important and defenseless to worry about.
“Yes, I … I am sorry it came out like this. I … had no idea you were interested in me. I suppose if things were different…” he said, quietly.
He saw the way Harry was smiling all the way downstairs and even once they left the house into the freezing cold and falling snow.
“Not even a bit.”
They always set the meeting, sneaking together under Harry’s Invisibility Cloak, but respectfully turned their backs to each other, and didn’t peek, as they were changing. They didn’t sit too close, in fear they might accidentally, or not so, touch one another. Which would surely lead to some embarrassment, or something they haven’t wrapped their heads around yet.
Stay healthy and know you are loved,
But he nodded anyway.
Love each and every one of you!
with. Hell, his soon-to-be fiancé, as far as Draco was concerned. He wouldn’t be surprised if the two would marry sooner than himself.
“No. I don’t have what girls have, thank you very much. But when two guys do, you know,
With a loud click and an uneasy sensation in his stomach that almost made him sick, he found himself on the empty sidewalk. He had no idea where in the world he was, and looking around at the houses did nothing for him. But before he could say anything, Ana outstretched her hand to the street and waved. Nothing happened for a good minute, and as he wanted to question that, a three-story bus appeared right in front of them, and a short man, not older than him, got out.
or something in the same lines. He didn’t care about all the other Slytherins, not anymore at least. He had his friends and that was all he needed.
He laid there for a long time, trying to put his mind in order and overthinking the whole day in and out, before he heard the stairs and then floor outside creaking. Soon the door opened slowly and Harry walked in. He looked tired and his hair were disheveled, eyes brimmed red and sleepy. Draco sat down , suddenly self-conscious and embarrassed that he was caught in Harry’s bed as if it was his own.
“But that’s alright. I got used to the idea. My father was an asshole before he learned I’m not going to be a perfect manly man…”
With even more love,
The caring note in his voice and his soft, concerned features were just heart-warming and it did things to Draco. It was as if someone really cared about him – Harry of all people. He rubbed his eyes furiously, trying to get the gathering tears dry before they escaped. Harry was quick to grab his hands, gently, taking them away and keeping in place between them.
He didn’t argue and just followed the lady into her pink house with perfectly cut grass and hedge. For the most part, it was the lady that was talking, as she almost forced him to sit at the table in the kitchen and drink tea while she fixed him food. It made him a bit uneasy. He barely ever met strangers, let alone have them be so nice. He was also worried about aunt Andromeda being gone and contacting her. Salem’s presence was helping a bit like the cat laid in his lap, ignorant of the tuna that lady presented him with, and seven curious cats in the house.
“Draco? I think it’s a friend of yours.”
“Hey,” Harry said, smiling tiredly.
“It’s … It’s nothing,” he said, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“And if we are on the lunch, I would eat something. I didn’t have breakfast. Too much going on for anyone to care about me.”
Thank you for reading!
"Why aren't you with Ronald and Ginny?" Hermione said.
He felt his cheeks heating. He dropped his head, hair covering his face. He forgot to hide his essay. Hermione already knew, but no one else did.
“Here. Have this.”
The way Blaise looked at him so peaceful and unbothered as if he wasn’t just proposing to change their whole lives, almost startled him. Even more than other’s words. He couldn’t imagine it. He liked Blaise, and he knew he didn’t have anything bad on his mind. He wanted to help if anything. And he would reconsider it if it wasn’t for his love towards Harry, and for the need to be independent. He wasn’t going to marry Blaise just because he was offering nice things. Maybe that day when he found out, or when he run away from the house he would just take the offer, not thinking about it, but not anymore. If he and Harry weren’t bound to happen, if they were to go their separate ways, or co-parent (in case he finally got guts to tell Harry), he wasn’t going to jump onto Blaise’s offer. He wanted to be loved and to love. He didn’t want a marriage just because Blaise was a nice man from a good, pureblood family. If he had to, he would be working his ass of himself. Hell, he wanted to do that either way. No matter if he was to marry the love of his life or be all alone with the baby.
He didn’t know why he would assume that he would have another outing like this with Harry. It was a big thing to say that they would come again in few months, but Harry didn’t say anything against. Instead, he smiled, and just took Draco’s cold hand into his much bigger and warmer one to lead the way to the exit. He followed few inches behind, looking at their joined hands with wide eyes, blushing madly, feeling hot all over. To make the matters worst Harry didn’t let go of his hand all the way to the small cinema nearby. Just when they got inside the warm place and Harry was taking off his scarf and fogged glasses at once, he let go of Draco’s hand, leaving it prickling with the lingering sensation, totally oblivious what he did to the blonde.
He found himself at the loss for words. It was as if he saw Hermione for the first time this school year, not able to form the sentence. What was he supposed to even tell her? That he didn’t want to be friends anymore?
Harry chuckled softly.
His blush got only worse, and he only shook his head.
Ana left, and soon enough Blaise walked in, looking way too handsome in his black suit and black shirt. And that half-smile he was sporting wasn’t helping. Draco often thought that, in a different setting, he would see himself falling for Blaise. If only the other man liked men and had a bit of interest in him.
“I … but why?”
, meeting people that supposedly weren’t going to whisper or point fingers and nasty looks at him. But it was just wishful thinking. If Harry didn’t say it to make him feel better, and Weasleys agreed to having him over, it meant they were just such goodhearted people. But there was no need into straining that. He was who he was, no use trying to pretend the truth was different.
. “Unless you don’t want to.”
They moved away and Draco put his gifts safely in his bag as Harry was going through his wardrobe contents. The brown-haired man announced he was going to have a bath before he disappeared in the bathroom. Draco, on the other hand, went back to bed, keeping himself occupied with one of the Herbology books.
“Hermione told you about this place?”
“You are already up?” Andromeda’s voice came from the entryway. She was already put together, and Draco figured it was something she and his mother had in common. Looking nice and fresh despite the early hour. While he struggled to even get out of bed, not caring how presentable he looked. And he looked exactly how he felt – tired. Happy, but so tired.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a mug full of steaming coffee – with cream and sugar, he sat down at the table with his aunt and Teddy and made it a point for himself to scarf down as many of the pancakes as he could. And then have a nap. But first, he made sure that the boy’s breakfast was ready alongside his cup of juice. It quickly became a thing – Draco mothering over Teddy. It came so naturally that it was almost frightening how close he grew to the boy he haven’t seen before. The only thing was that he regretted not being in his life sooner. Or that he wasn’t needed there, that Teddy would have his parents at his side. But those were wishes he would have during the dark, sleepless nights that he was haunted with dawning past.
“Harry is coming.”
First of all he will have Harry and Hermione to answer to. He would have to break things off. With Harry it was somehow easy, but with Hermione, there was no real reason to it. He figured that even the Weaselette didn’t have other reason than to make sure he suffered enough. Thinking about the redhead girl made him think that, after all, he wasn’t the worst person in this weird love triangle.
Harry cranked his neck to meet his eyes, smiling sadly.
He felt the strong urge to lay next to Harr and hug him. The expression on his face made him uneasy. He looked distressed, and as if he was in deep concern, and thinking heatedly on top of that. It was way too much for one human being to do at one.
“Yes. But where are we going?” he asked.
She passed the handle to Draco, and he looked at it puzzled before taking it, and putting it to his ear as she did. He could hear some creaking in the receiver and the distant sound of people. He was silent for a long moment, words failing him.
“Draco? What are you doing there, sweetheart?”
He took Draco’s suitcase, giving a side-look to Salem that hissed at him. Draco was close to being out of it. There was no way for his mind to wrap around what was going on right now. He just followed Ana into the shaggy inside and sat down on one of the chairs. He grabbed the piece of railing from the wall, holding onto it for his dear life as the bus drove off. The chair were all moving around and everyone seemed deeply unaffected. Even Ana, that was long gone with her chair to the middle of the bus, just sat there, happily wiggling her short legs.
Draco’s heart dropped.
“I … I’m scared that you might think different of me once you know what they are about.”
“Oh, how I wish things were different. That
do it.”
Therefor he found himself tagging behind Hermione, Ron and Harry on the Friday noon, just after their classes, and before their last period that would be only before dinner. He was carrying his fluffiest, greenest blanket, bag filled with sweets and books and Salem. They reached the outskirts of the Lake where they seated their blankets in the shadow of the tree. Weather this year was really unlikely. Draco couldn’t remember when was the last time one could step outside at this time of year to be blessed with sun instead of heavy rain.
His eyes went a bit wide at the prospect. Sharing a bath with Harry? Not even Prefect’s Bathroom was big enough to make him less nervous.
“You see, Draco,” she continued. “Don’t tell her that I told you, but I think you should know. When Narcissa was seventeen she was already engaged to Lucius, they were attending Hogwarts together and having meetings frequently. But your mother … she got pregnant by him. She told me when she came for Christmas from school. She was really scared and confined in me. I was going to persuade mother to push the wedding if anything, but … we had another sister, as you know. A very nasty one. Bellatrix told our mother. She didn’t take it lightly and well … your mother had nowhere to turn to, and she carried on with what our mother said. Our mother thought it best for her, and I suppose Narcissa thought it might be the best for you. It is wrongful to think what would happen if you stayed at home, imagining the worst scenario. What matters is that you are here, safe and sound, and your mother saw her mistake.”
“No,” he said fast. His blush got even more dark. He lifted his eyes, shily, to look into green ones. “It’s not because I can’t do a Patronus. It’s because I can’t cast anything. Some minor spells work sometimes, but most of the times it’s just few sparks and it dies down. I … I have seen many people through last few years, but they all say the same – it sometimes happens and there is faint chance it will come back. That’s why I’m doing essay for Charms. I always do. Professor McGonagall came up with this solution.”
Hermione was already at their usual spot, two feet tall stack of notes on her left, and a parchment, where she was scribbling away, before her.
,” he said finally.
But just a moment later Harry wasn’t close anymore, having moved away from him, in rush, hearing some rustle not far away. He heard it too, and got slightly startled, in fear someone might have caught them.
“I understand,” Blaise sighed. “I suppose I should have given you a sign earlier, but I always thought that we do not need such customs being brought up the way we were. Anyway … may I at least know who?”
“Draco,” came the low, raspy voice, that he thought he would never hear again.
The small table next to the glass wall was already set when they sat down. Draco opted for more tea, mint this time, and a plate full of mushy pea and potato puree, one of the very few things he could stomach these days. Blaise’s food looked like a delicacy compared to his, but just the smell of the duck made him feel uneasy in the stomach.
“No,” he lied. “We … We agreed that when one of u-us decides it is over … we would just split our separate ways. And I want th-this to be … to be over.”
He was sure that he imagined the way Harry slowly moved his way. But it was too brief to really notice, as at the very same moment an paper plane swooshed between their faces and dropped to the table, right on Draco’s drawing. They both moved away quickly, breathing a bit too heavily for it to be just friendly encounter, and Harry quickly grabbed the paper while he was looking around, in fear of someone seeing there. But there was no one. They were still alone.
The man walked inside giving his coat to Draco that just hang it on the old wrack. Blaise was scanning the small house carefully on their way to the kitchen.
He started the colorful, delightful smelling water and placed his pajamas and towel next to the bath before slipping off his school. Shivering slightly from the cold, he quickly stepped into nearly full bath, letting his body be covered with hot water. He really needed that. He loved learning, and working with Slughorn because he could learn even more due to that, but it was so tiring. Adding the fact that he had to hide before any Slytherin in eyesight, not being able to have proper meals at the Great Hall, only whatever he got from the kitchen, Hermione brought him or mountains of snacks from Hogsmeade, were making it worse. He wished that everything was more simple, that he didn’t have to live in fear of sitting at Slytherin table to have his Daily Prophet and big bowl of Magick O’s followed by eggs and toasts.
Above anything else I wanted to thank for all of your lovely comments. I want to say that they mean a lot to me, and they all came up in the moments I needed the most. I am here everyday, checking comments, reading stories, re-reading my stories because why not, and I just keep re-reading all the heart-warming things you wrote these past couple of weeks and they really helped me get back on track and uplift my spirits. I won't lie, I want to be a writer, like published author, and I am working towards this goal, and my main goal as an author is to write relatable things, in hope that the readers can feel that their struggles happens to others, to see those things in others lives and possibly give some hope for better future, so to have someone tell me they feel like they relate with my characters here is just priceless.
“Anyway,” Draco said after a long moment of thoughtful silence. “What are you doing here? I don’t mean to be impolite, but it’s Saturday, and you are always busy working at this hour.”
“You know that whatever he says, whatever he thinks, doesn’t define you, right? Just because it’s expected of you by your family, doesn’t mean you
“That’s why we have Invisibility Cloak, don’t we?”
He took the mug from her hands, taking a sip of steaming brew. At least he couldn’t say he was cold.
There was a slightly gloomy undertone to Harry’s tone and fading, thoughtful smile. After that he drifted off into his own thoughts, opening front door of the house. He didn’t say anything as they made their way upstairs to pick up their things and Salem to finally go to Weasleys.
And Draco would be left alone, with only Salem at his side, trying to desperately put his life together and not go crazy. Trying to fight off all the predictions and expectations his family had of him, which was already proving hard, even though it didn’t came to it yet. All he would have would be memories of one school year when he had two new, amazing friends, one of them being the love of his life that he had a chance to experience in its fullest, not only admire from afar.
Blaise smirked again, passing him a teacup.
“I know.”
“Uh, pretty girl! Pretty girl,” a voice called few meters from him, and he ignored it until it called again.
“Can we go there now?”
“You had enough of learning. You are on top of Slytherin class. And you come at the same level as Hermione in classes we have together. You are already prepared for the NEWTs better than anyone else, so you can have few hours of rest.”
“Friends?” he whispered, suddenly terrified.
“Yes. She was mad at first, but eventually wrote to apologize. She says she understands that not all the relationships work out, and if we are meant to be together, then maybe we will be one day, and if not, that it is okay. And that she don’t want to lose me because she thinks of me as a part of family. Which is nice, and I wish Ron was so understanding. I really want to go to that wedding, but I don’t know … Ron has the ability of making everything awkward.”
He was coming back from Slughorn’s classroom, after finishing his task of cleaning, when the Weaselette approached him. She was angry, she knew about him and Harry, and she threatened him. For a moment, his mind told him, that she was the one that pushed him, but it wasn’t the case.
“I only met her once.”
Draco giggled at his story, putting his bag into the fancy armchair that stood next to the fire place. He put Salem down, and cat took a curious stroll around the room before jumping onto the bed and making himself cozy between millions of pillows.
"Can't we just eat here?" Draco said, almost whining.
“I think that’s understatement. She was a bitch. She came over for mother’s tea parties’ and dinners until she died. I was a kid back then but she traumatized me nonetheless.”
I hope you liked it! And I'm sorry for making Ginny unlikable, it just...I don't even know why, it just came out like this. Also, I wanted to ask if there is parcticular way that you imagine those characters to look like? I must say for the big part, in my mind, I'm going with the movies but Harry and Draco are totally not movie nor book related and I don't even have any refference. I went with my imagination and just putting few characteristics here for everyone to imagine them as they please. I used to be super fixated in discribing every little detail, as if I could put the very same image in someone else's head, but it doesn't work like that, really. Anyway, thank you for reading and sticking around and I will see you very soon in the next chapter.
“Why are you here,” he finally said, voice weak and choked up with emotions.
“It’s alright. You couldn’t have known. No one does. Just Hermione. She was going through books, trying to come up with something but it just won’t happen. I’m okay with that, though. I got used to the idea.”
“Sorry, must have stood up too fast,” he murmured.
He didn’t match the level of enthusiasm that Teddy had with his cheerful shriek of ‘uncle Hally’. If anything he lost his whole appetite and the coffee smelled awful all of the sudden. He hasn’t heard from Harry all those weeks, months. He understood that Harry needed time for himself and space, and Draco did his best to push Harry into the back of his mind. Into the little box that was put in the locked cupboard. But there wasn’t a day where he wouldn’t wish for Harry to be there, right at his side, being happy with him and anticipating the birth of their baby. But as much as it was a beautiful dream, he saw it drifting away. It has been over two months since he last saw Harry on his birthday. And the older had no idea that Draco was here. He was coming to see Teddy – his godson. Not him.
I like this chapter, though it was struggle to get through it. I'm not in the best place right now, so I'm finding writing a bit hard, but I'm getting better, and I'm getting more writing done. I know I always write too much here and no one cares, but I wanted to say that I'm really thankful for my readers and that you all stuck around this long and are waiting for more <3 We are oficially ending sort of 'part' one of this story with next chapter and I'm kind of excited, because I was waiting to write this next part for so long.
“So, we thought we could have brunch at the lake. It is the only chance after all. Ron and Ginny will stop fussing eventually.”
They were passing the same corridor when something caught his eye through the creak of one of the door. Harry wandered further as he slowly walked into the room, pushing the door opened with a creak. It was like a trespassing, and he had a strong feeling he should have just follow Harry, but couldn’t help himself. Instead he walked into the specious room that was completely empty, floor ripped off, leaving the raw underneath of it. But what interested him the most was the old tapestry of a family tree. His family tree, to an extent.
“It was a rabbit. At least something that resembled one,” Harry said.
He closed him book as Harry sat down. She wasn’t wrong. Very dark and thick clouds were slowly moving their way. It became more cool and windy too. It would be a matter of time before the storm started, and they would be blown away or washed down by the it.
He was sitting at the table in the far end of the library, away from his usual spot, franticly looking through the pages of the book in search of one line he needed to copy. He didn’t want to spent more time at the library than necessary, but now, it was inevitable. He had to study all he could in next seven days.
“I-I’m so-sor..rry.”
“What is it? Am I sick or something? Did that fall messed up my head?”
He opened his mouth to say it was Carrow’s doing, but he quickly closed them, clenching them tightly. He knew it would only get worse if he told anyone, if he made a fuss about it. So, he couldn’t do it. He would rather never leave his room. It wasn’t like he had to bear with it much longer. It was February already. Just few more months and he would be back in the safety of his home.
“You know?”
“Sorry, he just loves to sleep,” he said quickly, walking to the bed to shoosh the cat from there.
“That’s … how? Do you have like an…”
“Are you alright? I’m sorry I didn’t come to see you at the Hospital Wing, I had some things to take care of.”
She put down her quill and carried on to going through the contents of her bag.
“You … You got presents for Ron, Weasleys and Teddy?” Harry asked, frowning.
“I suppose it’s because it’s just common knowledge. Like all those stories
Why exactly wasn’t he going home? Was it because of his mother visiting Lucius that didn’t want him to come? Or that she was going back to France after that and didn’t want him
Another Sunday spent entirely in the library, revising and finishing any leftover homework and extra credits. Nothing new, except for the fact that usually Harry wasn't around. Most of the weekends, save for few picnics and that amazing night few weeks back, Harry was out and about with Weasley and the Weaselette. So, to have him come over this early in the afternoon felt like a treat. Which really shouldn't, but Draco has long come to accepting the little things life allowed him to have. Sharing Harry was one of them.
“Blaise? Me?”
“I need to go,” Harry said, before just walking away.
“Do you know her?” Harry asked.
“Do I need reason given the situation we are in?”
It wasn’t long before Blaise was knocking at the door. Draco took the cardigan from the wrack and wrap it tightly around himself, seeing Andromeda to the stairs before he opened. They looked at each other for few good moments, before Draco let out quiet ‘Hello’.
“I must say, I never thought you would be such a good player, Malfoy,” Ron said, amused.
But life wasn’t that nice. And especially people in his life. He couldn’t see what could really happen. His mother was an unpredictable in her actions, and it was hard to even wonder what her reaction would be.
He wanted to believe, that he could do it. That he could just move out, become a Potioneer, earn some nice Galleons, and live the way he wanted. But with each passing day, he found himself less and less willing to put up any sort of fight. He was becoming so tired of it all, and there was no light in that tunnel. Everything was so pointless, that it hurt sometimes.
Draco smiled compassionately, giving the invitation back. He knew it was off the subject, but at that moment his mind drifted to wishing that Mrs. Weasley was so understanding with Harry. That he could broke up with Ginny, and still have his substitute family, as if nothing ever happened. So they could be really together. But he knew it wouldn’t be happening. Firstly, because Harry was too scared. Secondly, because Ron was Ron, while Ginny was beloved only daughter, and having her heart broken would be entirely different story.
It all sounded so nice, but there was one problem – there was no Harry in his future, and that was a main down of every plan he could make. It almost felt pointless, to fight with his mother, and possibly father, to go against their word, to not marry out of convenience, to build something on his own. But even without Harry, the prospect of a small flat and his own Apothecary was much more pleasant than marrying some posh old man and living in another huge, empty mansion, having some awful man touch him. No, there was o way in the latter, at least he was convinced so for now.
for an answer. He wanted me to be little posh dog that would do anything he wanted. And I never did. He want me to be friends with you, to treat people that didn’t do anything wrong to me as if they were below us. He always made me play with Crabbe and Goyle who were such awful bullies. It got worst when
“You will see for yourself,” Harry said, smirking.
Please, enjoy the new chapter!
He nodded, thoughtfully. He couldn’t even imagine it. His grandmother was deceased long before he was even born, but all the stories he heard drew him a nice picture. He wouldn’t want to go anywhere near her. His father used to say she was just as nasty and crazy as Bellatrix, but more to herself and somehow it made her only scarier. And now, hearing what he has, he couldn’t help but dislike her a little more. It also gave him a new light on his mother. She said she never loved Lucius. But he supposed it didn’t change the love for her child that she would be having. It made it all that much clear why she was this way towards him. He could feel a bit of understanding after all these years. He wasn’t sure if he would be this way, but if he tried, he could see why things were how they were.
“No. I think I tripped.”
“I was seventeen. It was Bill’s wedding, before shit went down. It was so awkward, and weird, and I couldn’t wrap my head around what happened, because one moment I was in the kitchen, getting ready, and the next I was well … with Ginny, in her room, and we were doing it. I suppose it was heat of the moment, fear of what was to come, and all that stuff. But it was so wrong and weird. Luckily, I had no time of beating myself up, because I had other matters to worry about.”
Moments later warm, wet lips were on his neck, kissing, licking and biting, very gently, making his skin prickle. This mixed with the fingers working on his nipple, teasing, rubbing and squeezing, send jolts of pleasure down to his stomach and he could vividly feel his member tightening against the fabric of his underwear, aching at the lack of any sort of stimulation and restriction of the fabric.
“You wanted to ask me something earlier,” Harry said.
“Maybe. But I wanted you to know that I … I broke up with Ginny.”
“I fear so. Sirius’s mother was … well,” Harry said, before laughing softly.
He turned around, shy smile on his lips as he leaned in to peck Harry’s lips.
He felt bad for lying to Hermione, as the only thing he wanted to do was to tell her everything. But he couldn't. The thing between Harry and him was strictly confidential.
“Wait,” Draco added quickly. “Can you take my presents with you? I mean, I got one for Hermione, Ron and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and for Teddy and for you too…” he said, suddenly embarrassed. It sounded more stupid spoken out loud.
“Everyone were talking about it, weren’t they? Harry Potter getting a detention during first class, going totally mental,” Draco recalled.
“Me either. I figured it would be nice to stay here a bit longer. It’s our last year, right? I will miss this place and I wanted to stay here as much as I can. Silly, I know. But I will be joining Weasleys for Christmas party and Boxing Day. My godson will be there and I don’t want to miss his second Christmas. May I ask why you are not coming?”
As if it was some routine, after eating Hermione leaned against the tree, with newest edition of Hogwarts: The History, in her hands, that she purchased in Hogsmeade just yesterday. Harry laid down, and Draco sat in close distance reading Madame Bovary, Salem in his crossed legs, as he appeared out of nowhere. His book was an very old copy that he brought from  home, full French, which he spoke fluently since he was four. His mother insisting that he had to have French tutor. Not that it was anything pleasant.
Even though there was a high possibility that they may never find a way back to each other, that once Harry decided he was ready to start a love life again, he would fall out of love with Draco, or understand that he was just a charity case at the time, he was willing to take this risk.
After everything settled down, as much as it could have, his mother came up with a brilliant idea of getting back in touch with her sister. After all she was the only family they had left. They met few times, that Draco knew of, and he met her once, for tea with her mother, but it was cut rather short. Andromeda didn’t love who Narcissa was, and vice versa. They were just too different and there was too much between them to rebuild their relationship. Which was pity, because after all Andromeda was the last piece of family he had left beside his parents. And she was extremely nice, smart, and kind woman. He wanted to get to know her better, perhaps have a real aunt, but he never got such chance.
“What are you wearing?” she said in a low voice. “Elf was supposed to leave the clothes that came from Madame Pirburry in your room.”
His voice was sad, and Draco could understand it. It felt like Harry really loved Quidditch and had to resign against his own will. It was also sort of weird to hear him speak so openly. For the first time Harry confessed something to him. As if they were really friends. Hermione did confided few things in him, but it was different with Harry. It felt almost intimate. Especially with the mention of war that held so much sadness and pain on its own. He has never talked about it with anyone else than Luna. But it was only twice. With Hermione they didn’t pick up a subject ever since he apologize.
“Of course I want to. But … are you sure? You know how things are. And I wouldn’t forgive myself if I hurt. If I did something you may regret later.”
Draco just nodded. He really liked the idea of spending Christmas outside of the castle, especially with his friends. He hoped he wouldn’t be too big of a bargain, though, but he trusted Harry and his reassuring words.
“Who?”
wrong. Maybe he could have an hour of rest. The next day it was Saturday anyway. He would spend the whole day learning, and practicing potion making with Slughorn as he has planned anyway.
“And what makes you think that you have any saying in this?”
“Y-y-you have yo—your own p-place?” he asked, looking at Harry, frowning.
He felt light nudging on his hand and he couldn’t ignore it any longer.
“But no tonight. Soon. I want you to sleep on it couple of days, to know you are sure. And then I will arrange everything.”
He carried on with making the table and put the kettle on for tea. Salem, seeing there was no threat, resumed eating his tuna just to warm himself a spot in Harry’s lap moments later. At first, they didn’t talk at all. Harry sat at the table, watching him intensely and petting Salem. And they didn’t talk for a good few minutes when tea was served, and Draco was sitting in front of him in uncomfortable silence.
“Not at all. Do you want to talk about your nightmares?”
"Is everything alright, Draco?" Hermione said.
“Well, for your luck, Mrs. Zabini is a very considerate person. She will let Blaise take your hand in marriage.”
He left Blaise on the dance floor and left to the closest balcony, glad that his friend didn’t follow him. He needed a moment to himself to calm down.
He suddenly remembered exactly what happened.
The boy nodded quickly, looking at Draco with anticipation. He chuckled to himself and got up from his warm, cozy bed, and put on the thick robe before taking the boy’s waiting hand and going to the kitchen.
Hermione shook her head and vigorously stabbed her food with fork, eating it fiercely as if it was at fault, not her ex-boyfriend.
“Oh,” was all he managed to say.
She rushed to him as he stopped, waiting for her.
“I fear we had seen it all. In spring and summer there is more animals to see, as some are now asleep or just in places they are warm.”
“I suppose that if you put so much effort in it, I would let you stay. But don’t slip like this again, promise?”
Harry didn’t take as long as he thought he would, and soon he came back bringing with himself smell of mint and eucalyptus from the bathroom. Draco half expected him to wear some checker pants and button down top, but instead he went for muggle sweatpants and black henley shirt and Draco thought for a moment he was going to melt because of the sight. He wasn’t prepared for Harry looking so domestically handsome.
Harry nodded and a heavy silence fell between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She hated my father. She thought he was after her position. Which wasn’t true, because he was very comfortable where he was. And I just asked how we would pass our OWLs if we didn’t know how to cast spells, because even learning in Charms, we would take hours and hours to master easy spells, not talking about things that were more advanced, like everything at Defense Against the Dark Arts. So, I’ve earned two weeks of detention. Then another three some time later. She thought she would get back at my father going after me, but he was mad at me after he knew. That I let myself be treated this way.”
He swallow thickly, trying to regain his sense, and calm down his crazy beating heart, moving eyes from Harry to his book. He could do it. It wasn’t a big deal.
“Don’t look so dumbfounded, Draco. You and Blaise know each other for years. And he is a good catch. I was surprised when his mother approached me, telling me he asked for my recognition over your hand. We could not find you a better match. Other than him there was only that Rowle man and Selwyn’s father. Both are quite good, but Zabinis are beating them. They are almost as rich as we are.”
“See you.”
“Okay,” he whispered.
“I suppose. I just wish it could stop. All the thinking, all the crap I have in my head. I want to be happy with how things are. With good memories I have. Hell, can I really complain about things now? I mean, it sucks to be an orphan, but at some point I had loving parents, which many people didn’t even have that much. And now? I have money, I have beautiful house, I mean it will be beautiful once it is redone. I can do
“Oh.”
“Speak for yourself. I fully intent to go after Potion Master position in the future.”
“How are you feeling?”
“Of course. What is it?”
They bid him goodbye and he was on his way to the dungeons, dreaming of nothing more than hot shower and bed. But that wasn’t happening. Too many Slytherins in the common room.
His head snapped up at the word, and he quickly got up from his chair and made his way to the door, trying not to trip over the chairs or few people. He got out of the bus that was as quickly gone as it appeared.
Harry smiled sadly, hand travelling to squeeze his shoulder, staying there for a while.
Draco nodded, even though the other wasn’t looking his way. He was not expecting that. Most of the times they met, they went to the Prefects Bathroom or The Room of Requirement, even fewer times. So, to go to Harry’s room, all way in the Gryffindor tower, felt so strange, yet almost pleasant. It was almost like visiting at Harry’s home. Well, Hogwarts was sort of his home for duration of ten months, so it seemed only fitting. But back when he visited Grimmauld Place, they were friends. Maybe even less than that at the time. And now, they were in sort of a relationship, which changed things entirely.
“Oh, darling. I was just like you. Thinking that life is all about love. But then I met your father, and I understood that it all wasn’t about it. Life is about having a face and good backup. I never loved Lucius, no. But we are great partners. I never was short of anything. He provided me with everything I needed and more. Most importantly, it was what my family wanted from me, so I did it. You are going to do so too. For your family. Zabinis are the most liked family these days. No doubt tying a knot between two of you would make us look better.”
“No, it isn’t. You shouldn’t be stuck here. I know … come with me to the Burrow.”
“If you say so. But I think in this case your mother should call-off the ball.”
It was already middle of April, and they were running out of time. Draco was sure that the closer they got to NEWTs, the less time him and Harry would have for each other, both too busy with learning, and after the NEWTs ... it was over. They time would be up.
Draco could feel more tears running down his cheeks. He wanted to say so many things, but Harry said against it. Instead, not thinking what he was doing, he leaned in and hugged Harry tightly, clutching to him.
“Me too. I have to wait in common room to apologize to Ron and Ginny,” Harry said, grimly.
“Your mother wrote again,” she said.
Draco was still in awe, looking through the balcony and Harry took this moment to lay down the blanket he got from the thin air.
can get pregnant. Naturally, and if not, with help of potions.”
“What is wrong with me, Salem,” he sighed heavily, flopping to his side to cradle the cat in tight hug. He got a snark in response. “Thank you very much. You are not helpful at all.”
. All lies.
“I … it’s … it’s okay,” Draco said, quietly. “I-I’ll leave.”
Harry sat down next to him and unpacked his bag.
“I said it first, so now you have to resign.”
“But…”
“It’s alright. I came to terms with it, I guess. It’s just … what war is. No matter how stupid and pointless the war might be, it is what it is. It just take people away. And I happened to be one of the main concerns of this war, so it is only natural that all this things happened.”
“Draco. You are not five anymore. I was planning this for ye-.”
“Mm. Yes. I just … I was so mad. That Ministry wanted to make me some delusional freak and, to that, stop us from learning how to defend ourselves. It was pure madness.”
