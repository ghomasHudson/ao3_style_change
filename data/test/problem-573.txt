Harry knew now that because Hermione and Draco were friends, Ron figured he had no choice but to be friendly with the Slytherin.
As Harry had expected, the news had already travelled to the other houses somehow within the hour. Some the Gryffindors (Fred and George most particularly), were grinning up at him, calling out to him most unpleasantly, and this extended to some of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs as well.
I didn’t want to defend myself for fear of getting into more trouble, but then I heard my mysterious attacker yell Crucio, so I cast a protective charm but of course that knocked the tosser off his feet.
Draco’s voice sounded that same rasp that always put Harry in a predicament; Draco sat atop him and Harry’s pants were tightening with every passing second.
When Harry finally found Ron and Hermione, he quickly scurried over to them, thankful that they were sitting a little apart from the rest of the Gryffindors. Their faces looked at him with sympathy, but Harry could see Ron was also eyeing with him a look of disdain and betrayal.
Draco and Blaise performed that same sexy handshake that Harry could only awe at. ‘Why did Slytherin’s have to be so cool?’ Harry thought to himself.
“I’d be happy to oblige. I mean, I have trouble sleeping too so, you know, maybe...It could benefit us both?”
Harry’s head lent forward again to look at him. His green eyes stern and fiery, “Don’t act like you don’t feel the same way.”
Thus far, Harry hadn’t really thought about the intricacies of being in a relationship with Draco, his focus remained on the confession of his feelings.
Harry scrambled to the floor for his cloak and quickly draped it over himself, now thankful for the corridor’s darkness and obscurity because as Blaise approached, he seemed to have suspected nothing. Harry stood there, invisible, looking between the two Slytherin’s, Blaise’s face in utter bemusement.
Draco gestured to the large armchair by the fire, that looked exactly the same as Harry’s except it was dark green.
Harry heard Draco gasp a sound of disbelief and sit forward on the edge of the couch, turning his whole body toward Harry, “What?!”
At once all of the first years began yelling various tones of ‘up’ and Harry and Draco could only look upon them and suppress their laughter. Harry had to admit they were quite cute, but their struggle really was quite humorous.
Harry shook his head, “Thanks Hermione, but… It’s not that.” He leant forwards on the table, and Ron and Hermione leant a little forwards as well, trying to ignore the eager faces looking in their direction.
Then Harry swiftly cupped the blond’s neck and used his other hand to grip his hair, pulling Draco’s head back and crashing their lips together.
Having not yet released, and sitting amongst the darkness of the eerie yet beautiful common room, Harry was dizzy with desire, and he could tell Draco was too.
Draco hummed raspily and approvingly into Harry’s ear. His strokes becoming more urgent and desperate.
The chatter around the table immediately subdued. Ron, Dean and Seamus looked between Harry and Pansy with eager grins on their faces.
“Even at eleven you already knew the good from the bad. And you were brave enough to stick up for your friends.”
He was safe with Ron, because Ron had been there with Harry on every anniversary since they’d started school, and the redhead knew to give Harry his space, but to also remain in his presence so he didn’t feel lonely. He felt a rush of fierce love for his best friend.
“Draco, how can I be honest with you, when this whole thing we have going on… is based off secrecy and lies?”
“Are you kidding?” Draco kept running his gentle hand through Harry’s hair, “I meant that, if you’ve got something to say, you’ll say it. You aren’t passive, you’ve never been, and it’s saved a lot of people's lives. And I don’t just mean physically, I mean when you stand up for others, when you stand up for your friends.”
“... I know there’s something there,” Harry said as Hermione was practically beaming, “But I think we’re just too-”
Harry, whose recent elation had suddenly been replaced by fiery anger, rounded on Draco with George, and punched the Slytherin hard in the stomach.
“Actually I just boiled a pot of tea,” Harry felt his heart sink, “When I’d got back there after dinner, a teapot, cups and saucers were all sitting on my desk.” Draco seemed to be talking to himself now, not looking at Harry, “I could swear they weren’t there before I went down to the Great Hall for dinner.”
As the eighth years, as well as Ginny and Luna, all gushed about their presents over breakfast, it wasn’t until a while later that Harry realised Ron, Hermione and Ginny were all dressed in their scarves and beanies, clearly ready to head to Hogsmeade after they’d eaten.
Harry and Ron looked at Neville sadly, then the three of them made their way down the spiralling staircase. When they neared the bottom, they saw a bunch of eighth years trying to push and shove their way through the entrance to the common room, taxed with their heavy trunks and animal cages.
As Draco cast a wordless Cleaning charm over the two of them, Harry felt Draco’s erection still as hard as ever beneath him.
They all snickered at her honesty. It was true anyhow; Blaise and Ron really just wanted an excuse to drink.
“Ron,” Harry said quietly, turning to him. “I’m sorry I’ve been so selfish lately. Crying about my parents and all that when here you are not a year out from losing your brother. It wasn’t until I saw George that I’d realised how self-centered I’ve been-”
Harry wrapped his arms around the Slytherin, and they stood, simply holding each other for what felt like eternity.
Wolf whistles ensued around the circle and after a few minutes Ernie’s head was lulling back in obvious enjoyment. When Pasny finally got up, Ernie’s hair was messed and his pupils were large, undoubtedly aroused by Pany’s kissing.
“What about you?” Draco hissed nervously, his face even paler than usual, “What are they gonna say when they see you and I are...are… you know…”
Harry knew it wasn’t worth trying to convince Draco with words, so he shifted to lay down under the covers in Draco’s bed.
Harry laughed cruelly, “Why? Scared of what the Death Eaters would do if they found out Malfoy’s pureblood son was hooking up with Harry Potter?”
But then Draco’s lips were gone, the blond giving Harry one last ambiguous glance, before he was straightening his clothes and heading for the door, leaving Harry feeling more confused than he had done since they’d first begun hooking up.
“Yes. You were already famous, and to add, you could catch Snitches at the age of eleven. I’d been riding a broom for a year or so before I went to Hogwarts, and I still couldn't manage it.”
Harry still sat atop him, looking thoroughly put out as Draco had propped himself up on his elbows, a smug look plastered on his face.
“Figures McGonagall would transfigure this tower into an almost identical replica of the Gryffindor common room.”
As Harry sat across from them, his back facing determinedly toward the Slytherins, Ron spoke at once.
Before Harry could think twice, he was up on his feet and once again heading straight for Draco’s door. As Harry opened his own door however, he was faced with Draco himself, his hand raised as if he was about to knock. Harry’s eyes swam over the slightly taller boy in front of him. Soft blond hair tousled, he wasn’t wearing a sweater this time, but a black long sleeve shirt that hugged his arms with a loose grey T-shirt over the top of that. He looked irresistibly comfortable and pleasantly different compared to the black suits Harry was used to seeing him wear. Draco had the same straight black trousers he had had on yesterday, and plain black long socks that bunched at his ankles.
I’ve spent so much time with my Mother the past week and a half, I know she’ll let me return to the castle for Christmas. She says she’s seen a change in me and that it’s come from being back at school.
When they got to the Great Hall, their usual eighth year table, as well as the four house tables, had magically disappeared. Only to be replaced by a longish, rectangular table in the center of the room.
There it was. Hermione proving once again how strikingly mature and intelligent she was. And all Harry could do was look at her in awe and remind himself how lucky he was to have her as a best friend. Now his face shone with fierce pride.
When Draco lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder, their eyes connected. Both dark and wide, but hazy with sleep and satisfaction. Then Draco’s hand was on Harry’s face, his thumb gliding across his cheek bone, and then they were kissing; not urgent or desperate as they were before, but soft, and purposeful. And Harry felt himself melting into the gesture.
“That time…” Draco panted as he kissed along Harry’s jaw, “When you guttered me on the Quidditch pitch in fifth year. Merlin I was so turned on.”
He finally reached the door and entered the darkened passageway of the dungeons, the mutters of chatter and giggles silenced instantly.
Harry kept thrusting, seeking as much friction as he could. He began kissing Draco’s neck again as the blond groaned shamelessly into the echoey classroom.
The sound of Draco’s sexy rasping voice moaning Harry’s name, the mere sight of him coming into Harry’s hand, Harry had never been so turned on.
Draco had gotten up to. He was standing beside Ron and Blaise in a corner, Harry noticing that the three shared a bottle of some amber liquid between them.
“The only thing that would’ve made that hotter,” Harry murmured into the blond’s skin, “Was if you wore your Slytherin tie in the shower.”
So obviously, they all had a long way to go before they could, in Pansy’s words, ‘play happy families.’
Again, they stared. And it was as though all of the unsaid feelings they were afraid to admit were being conveyed silently between the two.
“Maybe if I went with you tomorrow people won’t treat you so badly,” Harry murmured as he touched Draco’s chest gently.
Upon passing the eighth year table, she stopped abruptly. Her eyes seemed to sweep over them and they turned to look back at her innocently.
When Harry pulled back, he could see Draco’s face clearly now, the sun having fully risen outside and casting a glowing look on the blond’s face.
But Harry seemed to notice that Blaise’s uniform was unconventionally untidy too. This was strange, as a prideful Slytherin, Blaise had always taken his appearance seriously.
When the two of them went down for breakfast, Ron, Hermione and Blaise were already there. Luna was sitting on the eighth year table too, and Harry noticed that there were only about fifteen other kids who also sat in the Great Hall, scattered around the mostly empty House tables.
Before he knew it, Harry’s breathing had quicked and his head had lulled back onto his own pillow. His eyes were squeezed shut as he faced the ceiling, rubbing his hand against himself more quickly.
The two disengaged from their helping friends and ran toward each other, colliding in a crashing hug.
A few more hours had passed in the Three Broomsticks and much to Harry’s relief, his friends' topic of conversation had switched to Quidditch and Christmas, among other things as the eighth years had swapped and switched seats as the time went on. Hermione with Luna and Ginny. Ron with Seamus and Dean.
She smiled and looked at her fingernails, “Oh you know, we’re all just so open these days. All so trustworthy and accepting. I’d just thought I ought to let you know that.”
Harry let Ron’s words fall into the loud chattering and laughter echoing around the platform. Malfoy and his friends; Pansy, Theo and Blaise Zabini shifted to the edge of the large pack of students and Harry weaved in and out toward them whilst still moving slowly forward amongst the flow, toward the carriages. Students eyed him as he tried to gently push them out of his way, he was glad the Slytherin’s were walking along the edge of the group, so he wouldn’t attract too much attention.
That same feeling Harry felt seven years back when he’d met Ron on the Hogwarts Express, seemed to be swelling in him again. He was at a loss for words. The reaction he felt from Draco’s praise matched that only of the compliments he’d received from Sirius or Dumbledore. He felt his throat dry up and his eyes sting for release.
Draco chuckled and his grey eyes flashed at Harry before he kept moving down the stairs, “I’ll see you at the party Potter.”
Harry managed a breath that was more like a gasp. Merlin had he missed the boy’s proximity. It was beginning to drive him mad.
Harry’s head lulled back, losing all senses and simply revelling in the gesture since he’d been deprived for so long.
Ron scowled but Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. Then George turned and led them in for a tour of the shop.
When Harry practically sprinted up the spiral staircase and burst through his bedroom door in a haste to find the Marauders Map, only out of the corner of his eye did he realise there was a new addition added to his room; an unmistakable, emerald green oversized sweater lying lazily on his bed.
Draco had his white button up school shit on beneath his vest, his green tie looking immaculate, and over the top draped his Slytherin robe. His white hair was roused in that same sexy way that left Harry dizzy with desire, and his black trousers and shiny shoes only accentuated Draco’s toned legs.
“Er, what do you mean what was I talking about…? You heard me, I was watching Harry and Malfoy play Quidditch-”
“Wait Draco,” Harry whispered as he placed one palm on Draco’s chest. “I don’t think we’ve thought this through.”
By the time Christmas Eve night finally rolled around, Harry was in Draco’s room waiting for him to get ready to go down to Great Hall for the Christmas Eve Feast.
They both tried to outfly each other just as they had done years before. Sometimes Draco would feign a dive and Harry pursued him only to realise the Snitch was nowhere in sight. Then at one point they forgot they were pursuing the Snitch at all and just raced each other around the pitch.
Ron shrugged, “She seems fine. I mean, it’s like George said, it hurts, but Fred wouldn’t of wanted us to sulk around. Coming back to Hogwarts fell at the right time for me and Ginny, and opening a store fell at the right time for George. We’re dealing with it, but we’re being productive at the same time.”
Suddenly, a great oak wooden double door appeared upon the blank space of the wall. When the three entered, they were blown off their feet with loud, blasting music. The Room looked just like a house party. The lights were dimmed. There was a fireplace along one wall with a rug, a couch and two armchairs surrounding it. Long, thick ribbons that looked like streamers hung loosely from the ceiling. This reminded Harry of Slughorn’s Christmas party back in sixth year. There was a large wooden table adorned with party food and next to that, another table with a large assortment of drinks. There were many comfortable armchairs spread throughout the room.
Draco had been gone just over a week, and between Harry’s homework, mentorship commitments and NEWT revision, he spent all of his free time writing to Draco.
Harry had become a madman, and so had Draco, and they knew that the only way to stop delving deeper into these dangerous waters was to cut ties all together, but they both seemed delusional toward the prospect, and so continued their nightly meetings in earnest.
That seemed to seal the deal right then and there. Harry couldn’t possibly admit to that revelation. He needed to move before the mess they were in only got extremely and irreversibly messier.
Every time Harry had downed whatever spirit and soft drink that was in his glass, he took a shot for good measure before starting on his next mixed drink.
Ron’s mouth fell open; not only had a bushy haired Hermione scrambled through the door, but a certain blond haired Slytherin followed carefully behind her.
Harry could not deny; their eighth year tower was beautiful. It was just as warm and cosy as Gryffindor tower. A warm fire. Couches, armchairs and desks spread throughout the common room. Mullioned windows reaching high into the ceiling. Large soft rugs coated the floor underfoot. The colours of the common room were mixed but not to create contrast. The yellow of Hufflepuff was a dark gold. The green of Slytherin was deep emerald. The blue of Ravenclaw was like the velvet night sky, and the red of Gryffindor was many shades darker than Harry was usually accustomed to seeing in the Gryffindor common room. Somehow, all of the metallic colours mixed beautifully together, radiating a softness and safety to the students who now stood within them, awing at their aesthetic.
Ron looked back at Harry and smirked and Harry could barely suppress his grin either. He didn’t love the stares and frenzies his presence seemed to bring wherever he went, but he could appreciate the innocence and invincibility of childhood. He longed for it, so glimpses of it often made him smile.
As Draco ran his soothing hand up and down Harry’s back, he spoke, “Harry. You must know how loved you are. How loved you always will be.”
Not a moment later, Harry heard footsteps running up the staircase outside his door. He turned, and as his pulse quickened, his door flew open to reveal an adoringly handsome, platinum blond Slytherin standing there, dressed in jeans and a long travelling coat. His face was clear from the cold, with a small pink tinge on his cheeks, his hair, somehow looking effortless and falling slightly into his intoxicating grey, sparkling eyes.
“Well, just think, we can only sleep when we’re next to each other. The first night you slept in my bed, we woke up in each other’s arms. And I know we both didn’t dream at all that night.”
“Merlin you’re daft,” Draco crossed his arms, “Do you really think people believe that Harry Potter and a Malfoy are seeing each other?”
Hermione and Ron scooted up along the booth seat against the wall, as Pansy sat beside Hermione, and Blaise pulled up a chair beside Draco.
What’s more, is that because Draco was now sleeping with Harry every night, Harry’s usual curfewed ‘release,’ was deemed impossible now that he shared a bed with another. He longed to touch himself. He should’ve done when he was in the shower, but he always remained in Draco’s bed in the morning for too long, wasting his precious time and rendering himself unable to get off before school started.
They were panting again. They both looked to the darkened end of the passageway, searching for the cause of the sound.
More clapping and cheers ensued around the table, mostly from the teachers. Harry noticed that the other students at both ends of the table looked merely astonished at the fact that they were sharing a table with most of the staff, not to mention the eighth years.
Harry didn’t care. He, like the other eighth years, had gotten used to the Slytherin’s inside-joke tendencies. He’d accepted that some things just never change, his own, seemingly eternal reckless courage was an example of that.
I now realise how my Mother feels living in this huge house by herself. It’s much too big. I think we might sell it and live somewhere small in the countryside.
Harry could only happily oblige. He continued to rub the blond all over his shoulders, neck and back, continually touching his hair at segmented moments. And between it all, soft hums and moans escaping Draco’s lips as Harry carefully tore at the knots in his back. Before long, Harry felt Draco become a dead weight and his body was suddenly falling back into Harry’s chest. Overwhelmed by this sudden clash of body contact, Harry felt both his heart and mind racing, knowing how touch deprived he was and if he didn’t nudge Draco, he may very well do something he’ll regret.
“I hope you’re right, it’s been too long since the last time I rode a broom. That’s kind of why I signed up for Quidditch, there’s something freeing about it.”
Harry pulled back to look at him properly. Draco’s eyes were dark, sparkling slightly in the dimness of Harry’s bedroom.
The fog swirled around them the same way their magic did, and as the alcohol pumped through Harry’s bloodstream, mixed with the fiery touch of Draco’s body behind him, Harry felt totally dazed and delirious with his mounting pleasure.
“You know we support you Harry,” Hermione said kindly. “But that was very rude of Pansy, Harry’s got to sort these things out on his own,” She said fiercely looking at Blaise.
Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Ron Weasley, actually defending the not so secret sleeping habits of Harry and Draco.
The Slytherin laughed again, “Yeah I know. Society wants us shoved into categories. So yes, I am bisexual, but I figure it’s easier to just live your life, love who you want.”
Harry watched, unable to move. There was fire in Draco’s grey eyes and a frightening fierce expression on his face as he continued to belt the man beneath him.
“What are you talking about Parkinson?” Ron burped looking at her, obviously still too hungover to be engaged in civilised conversation.
When they’d gotten in the shower, Draco came up behind Harry again, and Harry moaned loudly at the feel of Draco’s bareskin against his own.
Harry nodded. He was feeling utterly exhausted from the rollercoaster of emotions he’d felt today and he wanted nothing more than to curl up into Draco’s arms.
“It’s complicated Potter,” Draco breathed, “I just… I just want you to sleep with me. I haven’t been getting much sleep lately.”
“If that doesn’t work Finnigan, I have ample supply in my bedroom,” He winked at Seamus, “And I’d be happy to oblige… So long as that’s cool with everyone?”
“Massage.” Harry said simply. He must be crazy, he thought to himself, but then again, it was nighttime and he was literally sitting in Draco’s bed.
“You two,” she eyed Draco and Harry, “Have rooms right next door to each other. Draco only sleeps when he has someone sleeping next to him,” She giggled, “I can put two and two together you know.”
As he eyes returned to the room at large, he saw his new Firebolt leaning against a corner in the room, and his trunk at the foot of his bed, underneath; a huge dark red and gold rug that covered just about the entirety of his dorm's floor. There was a small fireplace at the back wall, an armchair big enough for two people beside it, and a doorway next to the fireplace that led the way to the bathroom.
Now it was Harry who was left unable to answer. He looked at Draco earnestly, as if the answer would appear across the blond’s attractive face.
As they groped each other desperately, Harry heard and felt the rustle of his parchment, school books, quills and Draco’s letters falling onto the floor around them.
Draco shrugged, “I’d prefer to go through this healing process naturally. I know that you can’t properly heal unless you’ve suffered enough.”
Draco yielded under his gaze, resting his silver blond head back onto Harry’s pillow and looking up at the Gryffindor with arousal and smugness.
“Pansy you really wonder why the other houses never approach us. You’re unbearable,” Draco said glaring at her.
“Harry!” Ron’s loud voice forced Harry’s eyes to snap open. He jumped up, his wand already in his hand.
Harry looked as though he were going to hit him, but then Draco just took one step forward, gripped Harry’s T-shirt roughly and thrust him against the stone wall.
The conversation lingered on; they swapped stories of their summer, played exploding snap, snacked on pumpkin pasties and chocolate frogs, and discussed George’s new Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes pop-up store coming soon to Hogsmead.
That evening, when Harry and Ron returned from an icy Quidditch pitch, soaked with sweat and snow, Harry saw, as he passed, two platinum blond heads sitting beside one another in the Great Hall.
Nobody seemed to be discussing this new seating arrangement. It seemed to Harry, to come under that umbrella of things teenagers did but never talked about, and everyone obeyed the agenda knowingly.
Harry had only time for one startled gasp before Draco had connected their lips, his soft palm coming up to cup Harry’s neck.
Harry noticed that half the teachers weren’t there, undoubtedly hungover and ashamed to appear before their students. Harry grinned.
Not long after, Harry watched as McGonagall rose from the Headmistress’s chair, and began to head back through the Great Hall.
“Potter you’re welcome to come have some tea with me. Frankly I thought you’d still be down at dinner. Personally I couldn’t handle much noise tonight, I’m used to being on my own you see, being an only child. It always takes me a little to adjust to the commotion.”
Harry also found himself not caring because the mere fact that he would be seeing Draco tonight ultimately eradicated any sort of unpleasant feelings, it felt like he’d drank Felix Felicis again, and that any potential obstacle he encountered was deemed meaningless and laughable.
Within the next hour, Harry and Draco had cleaned themselves up and were now sitting up right against the headboard in Harry’s bed.
Harry heard Draco shift behind him, the blond’s presence crowding him from behind. Draco dug his head into Harry’s neck, softly gracing his lips over the clenched muscles of Harry’s throat.
“There’s a fair few pictures of Sirius Black in there Harry,” Draco spoke quietly, “Hermione told me you were close to him... There’s also lots of photos of your parents. Your mum seemed to be quite smart, she’s almost on every page holding a different award… That’s why I stashed it in my bag from the library when Pince wasn’t looking, she didn’t notice a thing, so it’s yours to keep now if you like.”
A particular favourite song of Harry’s had just begun to play and he suddenly stood up on the couch and started singing loudly.
Before he’d barely finished the sentence, Hermione flung her arms around his neck and Ron clapped him on the back.
Slughorn’s large and pompous figure appeared a few meters away, waving him and Draco over to the table.
He looked at Harry then but Harry averted his gaze. Laughing feebly, he said, “Um yeah I guess the castle is still learning about us. Er, I’ll just get your sweater.”
Harry’s thought processes had sufficiently dulled. The only thing he was thinking of was how much he wanted Draco. The tingling and sparks of their magic still dancing around them, tickling their skin.
The figure adorned a familiar emerald, oversized sweater, expensive black trousers, and its head was coated in Harry’s undeniable favourite colour; platinum blond. It was Draco.
This, Harry thought, was a Slytherin at work. Pansy, so enthralled by the humiliation she was inflicting upon not only Harry, but Draco; the boy whom she’d been best friends with for seven years, who, Harry noted, looked utterly terrified.
Harry then thought, since they were already on the topic of discussion, he’d better tell Ron and Hermione the news about his sudden change of career plan.
Harry snorted, Blaise snickered, Draco looked down at his plate so as to hide his smile. Hermione however, suddenly breaking out of her astonishment, simply rolled her eyes.
Suddenly Harry was falling onto Draco again, his body pushing Draco up against the wall. Harry’s head lay on Draco’s shoulder as he sniffed unashamedly.
As they both scraped outwards into the air, Harry saw Draco’s fingers begin to close over the golden ball. He scrambled to close his hand over Draco’s, not ready to give up. When both their brooms hit the ground, they toppled over onto the grass in a tangle of limbs, Harry’s hand still clasped over Draco’s, feebly clawing at the Snitch underneath.
“Right well you best be off. Best of luck to all of you and please try to stay out of trouble.” Molly wished them a final farewell as the Hogwarts Express blew its final whistle of departure.
Pansy’s eyes swept to Harry, who looked at her with hard eyes as if begging her mutely not to say what she was thinking.
The two best friends had just gotten back from the Halloween feast. Harry had been particularly subdued the whole day.
OK, so Harry wasn’t dreaming and this really did just happen and he really, really enjoyed it. Merlin, why do girls have to know everything?
As Harry’s eyes returned to his path ahead, he noticed a figure sitting in front of the old beech tree that he, Ron and Hermione had claimed as rightfully their own.
Blaise and Draco threw back their shots, but as their glasses automatically refilled, their faces contorted at the sight of Harry and Ron throwing back their shots as well.
Harry lay on his own bed, convincing himself that after such a long day, Draco would probably want to be alone when he finally got back to his room.
The thin layer of Harry’s boxers provided an ample feeling of Draco’s erection rubbing against his own.
When Harry and Draco entered Draco’s room, Draco practically slammed Harry up against the wall, immediately devouring his neck.
“I didn’t see you running away. In fact, from my point of view it looked like you were thoroughly enjoying yourself.” Draco smirked up at him.
“So wait, you’ve liked me all this time?! So...So when you say, you’ve worked out what our gravitational pull means, you mean-”
Somehow, seeming to know what Harry was thinking, George placed his hand upon Harry’s shoulder and forced him to look up.
“Did I mention how much I love you both?” Harry said, his eyes half closed. “Like we’ve all been through so much together. I sometimes have to sit back and be like ‘is this really my life?’ ‘Am I really a wizard?’”
When they finally reached their table- Harry squeezing in between Neville and Hermione, Draco in between Theo and Blaise- McGonagall spoke, “Thank you for joining us, Potter, Malfoy.” She nodded at them and smiled, “Everyone, please return to the feast.” Harry’s fellow eighth years looked between him and Draco, their faces as confunded as the rest of the students behind him. Slowly the chatter returned to full volume and Harry began to fill his plate with everything in sight.
Harry jumped out of bed and wrenched it open, the cold air smacking his face. He let the owl inside after he’d taken the semi soaked letter from its leg, and it immediately flew to sit beside the fire, shaking its grey feathers.
Although he knew all the students were already seated and he could vividly imagine the looks he was going to receive, truthfully, he didn’t mind. He could imagine the pleasing look McGonagall would send him upon the sight of a Gryffindor and Slytherin walking side by side to dinner; a perfect representation of house unity. But as he looked to the Slytherin next to him, he knew that Draco wasn’t so optimistic.
They both had O.W.L’s to study for, and Quidditch practise, Draco had prefect obligations, and Harry had distressing Occlumency lessons, not to mention his increasing run-ins with Umbridge, as well as his constant dreams about darkened passageways and mysterious wooden doors. In short; Harry and Draco’s secret fling had occurred at the worst of times… If it was even to occur at all.
And in those moments when he did reach sleep, he found he wasn’t sleeping at all as the same flashing visions of snakes and lockets and tiaras and cups infiltrated his mind.
Moreso, whenever Harry was late, Draco would straight up tell Harry he didn’t want to see him that night.
Draco didn’t answer right away. Harry watched his eyes sweep over the page he was on, then mark it with his expensive looking bookmark, then stowed the book beside him. Harry frowned at the front cover, was that? No, couldn’t have been.
As Harry still sat facing away from the majority of the pub, as well as the pub’s entrance, nothing could’ve prepared him for the warm hand that placed itself upon his shoulder, and the sudden scent of parchment and soil radiating from behind him.
“Can you believe it?! Us, with our own rooms! I didn’t think McGonagall had it in her...Dumbledore perhaps but I’d never guessed this kind of treatment from the woman who’d preferred me in Hufflepuff,” Neville said.
“No, but yes, that is an intriguing revelation...Anyway, you just admitted to being jealous of me, and you said jealous means love and hate at the same time.”
“Oh come on Potter, aren’t you supposed to be the bravest, boy wonder, Chosen One Gryffindor to ever exist?” Pansy asked, causing more sniggers.
Harry carefully folded up the letter in his hands and placed it on the pile with all of the other letters Draco had sent him on his desk.
It was then that Harry looked up toward the sound of brisk clacking footsteps heading toward their table.
He couldn’t wipe the grin off his face, his elation at the reality that Draco would be returning today left him feeling light and giddy, like he could float up into the air.
As Harry’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw five beds, four of which had their curtains hanging from their four-posters, obscuring their occupants. Harry had been in here enough times, but only when Draco was certain that the two of them would be alone. The fact that Draco’s fellow Slytherin friends all slept in their midst made Harry feel as though he was seeing Draco’s dorm for the first time again.
Harry noticed that whenever he’d had a particularly good day with Ron and Hermione, most likely at times when the three had left their DA meetings, when he’d meet up with Draco that evening, the Slytherin was cold and passive-aggressive.
Draco laughed, “I know you would’ve Harry. I think that’s why I did it, you’re scarily rubbing off on me.”
He brushed off Ron, Hermione and Neville and headed for a shadowy corner of the Entrance Hall to drape his Cloak over him.
Before Harry could catch his breath, Draco had also put down a cake beside the jersey shaped one. With a powerful jolt in his heart, Harry saw that this one was in the shape of a lily flower; entirely white with a soft pink tinge on the various petals.
Of course. Voldemort lived at the manor. Draco was bound to see death. With a slight pang in his heart, Harry continued plumaging through his back as he spoke.
“Oh please Potter it’s only a bit of fun. Don’t have me thinking Gryffindor’s are soft. Besides,” She suddenly got to her feet, Blaise following suit, “If we’re all gonna sit together and play happy family, you’re gonna have to get used to our wicked sense of humour. Come on Theo, Draco.”
Harry clenched the letter in his hand and crumpled to his knees. He began to feel that usual upsurge of guilt whenever he heard something had happened to his friends and he was unable to do anything to help. His eyes were watery and the ache of Draco’s absence suddenly weighed heavier on him that it had done in the past few days.
They lay next to each other trying to catch their breaths. Their various drinks spilled all over their clothes.
As the eighth years trudged through the snow alongside the younger year levels, Harry, Ron and Hermione wrapped their Gryffindor scarves around their faces as the cold winter wind whipped at their skin. Only their watery eyes could be seen peering through the falling snow.
It was nice to see; another Gryffindor and Slytherin putting their ancient rivalry behind them and starting anew.
She placed his hand over his beneath the table and squeezed, “It’s alright Harry. Besides, you’re right. They can’t keep Draco away for much longer considering he’s a NEWT student. That’s unfair.”
That night in the common room as Ron had just stalked up the stairs to bed leaving Hermione and Harry by the fire, Hermione spoke.
“Use your cloak,” Draco said condescendingly. Then he shifted so that Harry had to stand, “Come one.”
As they laid down, they turned to face each other. Harry placed his hand on Draco’s hip and snuck his fingers underneath his sweater, caressing Draco’s soft skin.
Afterwards, as Harry walked back up the hill from Hagrid’s hut, he felt notably lighter, like he’d just left an unofficial therapy session; not planning on letting his emotions out but it came to that anyway and he realised just how good it felt. He knew Hagrid felt the same way, and resolved to check up on him regularly.
“He’s not here, but I think we should toast Neville as well, he destroyed the last…” Hermione’s voice trailed off as she stood, her glass in the air.
The tall boy shook his head, “No it’s alright, besides, I’ll need to see mum and dad at St Mungo’s.”
“Fine. I don’t even care what you’re doing. I’m not interested in the details of your stupid little life.”
He came back the moment, realising that it was silent, everyone looking at him expecting him to say something.
“Harry. Is this true?” Arthur said, his wand still drawn, apparently convinced Draco had Ron under the Imperius curse.
Draco still looked as casual as ever, “Well yeah, I offered you my hand once, remember? You rejected me so I hated you, but I still wanted to be your friend… So I guess that’s love isn’t it?”
Perhaps it was simply that Draco provided Harry all he ever really needed; true, unconditional love, touch, and acceptance. His long deprivation from such things had evidently scarred him, but Draco’s presence felt like warm bandages wrapping over those internal scars, and Harry felt safe.
Harry’s thrusts began to slow as he neared his release. Draco pulled on his hair again and the two reconnected in a clumsy kiss.
With that, Harry mounted his broom, winked at Draco and said, “Best of three wins!” And he sped off into the pink sky.
Hermione had appeared by his side, the two of them looking fondly at the mess of limbs in the corner.
Harry stood a few meters away from the circle with his arms crossed, smiling fondly at the sight. There were various sounds of excited intrigue.
“Er- I meant when they were playing Quidditch yesterday Professor,” She said quickly. “I was watching them from the lake, they make a good team.”
Harry knew that this was all of their sexual frustration that had built up over the past week finally getting released, and frankly, it felt fantastic.
“But you don’t know if I am! And you just did...you just did this, with me!” Harry turned his head toward him.
Draco was humming into their kiss, which was becoming sloppy as their breaths and moans drew more urgent.
“Yes Harry?” Hermione urged as his two best friends sat eagerly either side of him on the stone bench.
Harry turned to look up at Draco who stood looking effortlessly beautiful. A Slytherin scarf around his neck, a black winter coat that went down to his knees, and black cargo pants and sneakers. As he sat beside Harry, he took off his coat to reveal the same emerald oversized sweater that Harry had come to fall in love with, and his snow white hair was messed from the weather outside. ‘No one should be able to look this good’ Harry thought to himself.
Harry swallowed, “We’re not good for each other Hermione… We’re alright from afar, but not this close.”
Draco was dancing with Luna and Pansy. Neville and Hannah were huddled in an armchair, so were Ron and Hermione, and so were Dean and Seamus.
“Yeah. I think he got quite lonely. Sometimes he’d come down in the middle of the night and we’d speak through the door.”
“Wait!” Theo said, his eyes wide, “What if Potter’s been in here before, and we never realised it till now?!”
Harry couldn’t stop moaning. The feel of Draco rubbing up against him from behind was easily the hottest thing he’d ever experienced and he very well thought he could drift to heaven right then and there.
Harry slowly woke up. He was hazy with sleep, his brain not yet functioning, his eyes blinking; adjusting to their surroundings.
In regards to inter-house unity, the eighth years were improving. The Hufflepuffs were learning to not take serious offence to the crude sense of humour issued by the Slytherin’s. The Slytherin’s, instead of making a fuss over the often reckless and uninhibited choices played out by various Gryffindor’s, simply watched them and laughed. The Ravenclaws were also beginning to open up and relax a little, thanks to Hermione’s kindness. They warmed up to her quickly simply because she was so smart and they were continually appalled as to why she was never sorted into Ravenclaw.
“It’s time you stopped doing things people expect you to do. If you wanna be an Auror, that’s great. If you don’t, that’s great too.”
After Harry had returned from his own room having gotten changed into his pyjamas, Draco was fumbling unnecessarily with his doona covers, averting Harry’s eyes as he spoke.
Draco reached for his wand on the side table and cast a wordless Cleaning charm upon both of them before he chuckled, “I don’t think I’ve ever come in my clothes so much in one term.”
Harry looked down the table toward him. Draco had a book in one hand and a fork in the other, apparently absorbed in his book and ignoring the banter between his friends. As Harry began to feel excited at the prospect of what tonight might bring, his eyes bore into Draco as he watched the blond suddenly rise from his seat, close his book, nod at his friends, and then depart from the Great Hall.
Eventually, Harry noticed that it seemed to be the Slytherin’s that were doing the most work toward befriending the students from the other houses. It had become, in Harry’s mind, another one of those unwritten rules where the Gryffindors (apart from Hermione), Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws sat back and waited for the Slytherin’s to come to them and make the initiative. But this was an unwritten rule that Harry simply couldn’t abide. Draco had put himself out there so much for Harry’s friends, even though Harry had no idea why (he secretly hoped Draco was doing it on Harry’s behalf, but he and Draco still hadn’t had that conversation). But nevertheless, Draco was really trying his best, like Ron said, to show that he was sorry for his years of bullying through action rather than words, by being open, by helping Hermione and in turn, accepting her help. Because of these gestures, Harry resolved from then on to make more time for not only Draco, but the other Slytherin’s as well.
They were nearing Christmas, and between waking up in a cold sweat with his scar prickling, and running through the castle to meet Draco, Harry’s body temperature seemed to be fluctuating constantly.
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut at the soothing gesture, then snapped open again. No. No. Must. Leave. Now.
“OK everyone,” came Pansy’s voice floating into Harry’s conscience. She waved her wand and the volume of the music suddenly decreased so that people could hear her. “We’re going to play some party games,” her mischievous smile stirring apprehension in Harry’s stomach.
But it faded as soon as it appeared as Draco continued, “Harry I…” He looked away, “I have to go to the Ministry tomorrow.”
“Nope. As much as I was longing to return to Gryffindor tower, I’m excited to see this new addition to the castle. Apparently we aren’t sharing with our old dormmates either, we all have our own room. Of course, I’m sure it’s fine if we want to share with another person,” She glanced at Ron who seemed to have caught onto her insinuation as he choked on his frog.
When they entered the warmth of the pub, Harry saw that the Weasley’s were mingling around the center of the pub, all with drinks in their hands and happy looks on their faces. Which happened to morph into utter shock at the sight of Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy standing flushed together in the doorway.
The blond had released their cocks and gripped his sticky hand onto Harry’s hip pushing him up against the wall, before he softly reconnected their lips in a purposeful and elated kiss.
Harry stopped walking and Draco turned to look at him as they reached the end of the platform. As Harry dropped his bag and knelt to open it, Draco glanced toward the carriages heading up the path to the castle.
Now it was the mid December, and Harry’s already tumultuously burdened year had become even more strenuous.
Harry whispered, “We’re not good for each other. The son of a Death Eater with Harry Potter? I don’t think so.”
But nonetheless, Harry lied on his back, eyes open facing the ceiling, certain that he wouldn’t fall asleep until he heard Draco come up the stairs.
George shrugged, “It still hurts. A lot. But I know Fred wouldn’t have wanted me to sulk around. So I keep distracted. I keep up the business for him.”
Draco flinched at the name, but then pushed Harry even harder into one of the desks, causing him to topple over it. But as he did so, Harry laughed.
Ever since his chat with Luna around the Great Lake, Harry suspected that Luna and Draco possessed a special friendship that couldn’t ever be known to outsiders, for they had shared their fears and hopes, and most likely lots of tears between a hard iron door, in the midst of a horrifying situation that had lasted for months.
Hermione came in to save the day as usual, “It doesn’t matter. There’s enough of us here that I doubt anyone will come up and interrupt Harry when he’s with his friends. Let’s give them a reason not to by minding our own business. Who wants another drink?”
“Humble as ever,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Honestly Potter I don’t think it’d make a difference. Even if that git did set them off, which he definitely did, Draco and Blaise reacted, and that’ll count for something.”
Harry spluttered a moan, awfully weak at the knees, now resting his forearm against the tiles so as to stop him from falling down.
“Blimey ‘Mione,” Ron said as he turned to her and beamed. She kissed his cheek and then turned to Harry and hugged him tightly.
Harry felt his heart thumping in his chest, suddenly feeling more awake than he had done the whole night.
So when the Golden Trio were outside in the courtyard on a clear yet frosty day, he decided he’d come clean.
Harry then realised the itch along his temple was soft, white blond hair; Harry had fallen asleep on Draco’s shoulder and Draco’s head rested lightly on top of Harrys. He then looked down to uncover the soft feeling gracing his fingers, to be none other than Draco’s own fingers, loosely overlapped with Harry's. His heart rate sped up again. He didn’t want to leave but was unsure of how Draco felt about this. Before he could let his anxiety run away with him anymore however, Draco’s sleepy, raspy voice suddenly broke the silence.
His face was puzzled when he answered, “Um, yes. I did. Wow. I actually slept, and sitting up no less! Draco this idea was great!”
“No…” Draco looked at Harry with semi sad eyes, “No, you’ll never know what it’s like to be an outsider looking in, trying hopelessly to unlock the mystery… even though I know you’ll never be completely honest with me.”
When they stumbled onto Harry and Draco’s platform first, Hermione and Ron bade them goodnight and continued up the stairs.
Draco’s grey eyes sparkled as they bore into Harry. Then he brought his hand down from Harry’s hair to his neck, and pulled him in for a kiss.
Harry looked back at her in annoyance, “I don’t know what you want from me Pansy? I’m not gonna admit I love someone when that someone isn’t here-”
Draco brought himself more up and over Harry so he was looking down on him slightly, before nudging Harry’s legs apart and digging his own leg between them.
And despite the ever increasing fear that was running through Harry’s body at the prospect of somehow squeezing out of this room between the immensity of Crabbe and Goyle, the thing that frightened Harry the most was the fact that he actually felt good, felt safe, in Draco’s arms.
Lastly, he’d received a golden snitch from Draco. Which had personalized engraving on it; adorning a small snake and a small lion carved next to each other on the Snitch’s center.
Although it’s warm inside the castle, I prefer the warmth of your body. The heat of your chest against my own. The comfort of your head nestled in my neck.
Harry weighed his options before answering, coming to the conclusion that discussing that weird gravitational pull he felt toward Draco could probably wait for another day.
You are expected to develop an hourly long class that aims to equip students with the necessary abilities to thrive in the said subject. This responsibility is to be taken seriously, do not abuse this privilege if and once you have decided to sign up.'
Harry saw a glint in Draco’s eye, and it took all his effort not to reach out and kiss him senseless.
“Look, it’s not that I don’t wanna fight the Dark Arts, frankly, it’s the only subject I’m quite good at so what other options do I have really? In fifth year McGonagall said she’ll help me become an Auror if it’s the last thing she does so-”
Draco shoved Harry hard at that, and he crashed into one of the nearby desks, “Don’t you dare talk about my father.”
Harry looked up and ran his hand through Draco’s shining hair, pulling him for a kiss that tasted of apples and citrus.
The blonde then moved his hand to cup Harry’s throat. He looked deeply into Harry’s eyes as he grazed his thumb along Harry’s jaw.
Harry’s head lulled back again into Draco’s chest. He felt the blond’s wet hair tickle his throat as Draco continued to suck seductively below Harry’s ear.
Harry’s eyes widened and felt a rush of arousal course through his boxers at the revelation that Draco had actually fancied him in the past.
Draco then began to stroke him, slowly at first. Harry couldn't remember a time when he’d ever felt so good.
Harry got straight off his bed and sped to the door as he saw, a miserable, defeated looking Draco Malfoy stand on the threshold.
Draco looked smug, his arms still crossed against his chest, “You say this is your home isn’t it? It never made any sense to me why someone who was so anti Ministry, who literally talked down to and turned his back on the Minister for Magic, would want to work in a department in the freaking Ministry…”
“Jeez Draco I don’t think I’ve ever been more turned on in my whole life.” Harry said as he rolled off of him.
Draco moved back to help Harry remove it before crashing into him once more, kissing him with fire and intensity.
Harry, I know I said that our “gravitational pull” could endure, but now I’m not so sure. I think about you all the time, about touching you, running my hands through your hair, kissing your neck. I’ve found that I can only sleep after I’ve touched myself and thought of you. The way your head falls back in pleasure, the way you growl and moan my name. My dreams are full of black hair, lions, and navy blue sweaters.
When Harry and Ron approached Blaise and Seamus, Seamus thrust a shot glass into Harry’s hand. Harry barely looked at the blue looking liquid before he threw back down his throat. It burned as he wiped his mouth.
All the anger and sadness that had been pumping through Harry’s veins suddenly subsided. All he felt was overwhelming gratitude and love choked up in his throat for the people who stood staring hesitantly around him. He still wasn’t able to speak. Tears were now leaking down his face and dripping onto the yearbook that he held in his hands.
Harry suddenly felt nervous. So Draco had just done this as a favour, and nothing more. That thought, seemed as insane as the reality of this whole situation.
Pansy, Blaise and Theo fixed their stern gazes upon Harry. Draco standing behind them looking apprehensive. Until he placed a hand on Theo’s shoulder, and his three friends turned to look at him.
When their bodies met Draco growled hungrily, slamming the door behind him and switching them around so that he pushed Harry roughly up against the door.
Harry caught his forehead in his hand as he stared down at his plateful of porridge. Hermione had a point, as usual, but his anxiety was getting the better of him.
The initial excitement for the eighth year return had definitely subsided, and most evenings in the common room were subdued, the only sounds coming from the scratches of quills on parchment, the turning pages of books, and Ron’s whispers of intermitted swearing as he tried to complete his abundance of essays.
Harry quickened his pace, heading toward the beech tree. Draco looked entirely absorbed by the book in front of him and Harry considered that the Slytherin most likely came out here for peace and alone time. But there was that gravitational pull again, and Harry felt himself unable to stop his feet getting nearer and nearer toward the blond.
But then Harry paused. He looked closer at Draco’s torso and chest, before becoming overwhelmed by unwanted images of blood and water pooling on a cold bathroom floor. Harry standing beside a dying Draco, utterly shaken and helpless.
Harry was now unashamedly rutting against Draco, causing Draco to cling to Harry’s shirt as his head fell back at the friction.
“I don’t know what to do. And now everyone knows. Even if there is something between us, I think it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”
Draco, I’ve figured out what our gravitational pull means. I think I’ve known for a while, but I couldn’t put it into words. But I won’t explain until we see each other.
What an asshole that kid was. Provoking Draco just to see him be punished. Harry thought, once Voldemort was defeated, that these futile divisions between people would disperse. But, it was like Dumbledore once told him, ‘To fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated.’
“Only joking Ronald!” And she intertwined their fingers and kissed him on the cheek before the four of them made their way down to the Great Hall.
When the three Gryffindor’s finally made it into the common room, they found Hermione pleasantly absorbed in a book as she sat on the couch by the fire.
Most of the time however, Draco and Hermione were studying together in the library ever since they became project partners in their Ancient Runes class, but the sight of the two of them; huddled over a desk scribbling down notes and exchanging ideas that sounded to Harry like they were speaking a different language, warmed his heart nonetheless.
Draco remained crouched over. But not a moment later had he twisted his foot behind Harry’s calf causing Harry to stumble backwards. Draco seized his opportunity and shoved Harry hard. The brunette fell to the cold stone floor and Draco jumped on him, straddling Harry and punching his chest.
He’d kept himself relatively distracted throughout the day; visiting Hagrid, flying with Ron, and walking around the lake with Luna, whom he’d discovered was staying for Christmas break as well.
Harry cringed as he thought back to the bitter memory. He was never good at expressing his feelings. He either screamed loudly and let out his anger at the top of his lungs at either Dumbledore or Ron and Hermione, or he would simply say nothing. If only he’d just explained to Draco that this was a particularly sad day for Harry, and it really had nothing to do with him.
Draco watched as Harry reached inside his robes, notably freezing on the spot with the idea that perhapsHarry was here to hex him while they were alone in the dark.
When they were all heading back to their common room, Harry felt himself being practically dragged by Hermione and Draco. They both had each of his arms slung over their shoulders as they helped him back through the castle. It was late enough that they could assume Filch was asleep.
She fiddled unnecessarily with Ron’s collar on his jacket. “Please, just this once, as it's your last year,” She looked directly at Ron and Harry, “Try to be safe and enjoy Hogwarts as students rather than superheroes.” Her eyes became watery as she grabbed Ron and Harry and they flung tightly into her chest.
Lavender and Parvati giggled, and Dean and Seamus smirked. Ron sighed as if to say ‘I’ve got no choice but to go along with this.’ But thankfully, Hermione came to the rescue once again.
Draco frowned at him. Harry suspected the blond had thought Harry would have had many friends before Hogwarts. That was an area Harry wasn’t in the mood for talking about. So he changed it.
Just as he was feeling like he was going to throw up, Harry felt that familiar softness and warmth take this hand.
Draco was suddenly choking on his own breath. Ron just started laughing, obviously too drunk to believe Harry’s words.
“We talked quite a lot about you actually. What you might be doing wherever you were. It gave us both a sense of hope.”
Harry risked a glance at Draco, who seemed to be determinedly avoiding any eye contact from Ron, as if expecting the redhead to strike at any moment.
And then some uninhibited children pointing plainly at him. Loudly expressing their thoughts as their parents try to hush them behind their cloaks.
“I met Draco in the library and he looked very sad. He said you didn’t seem to be yourself in Charms today and I explained what the significance of today was-”
It felt so good, Harry couldn’t deny it. He had fully succumbed to the strangeness and yet utterly satisfying moment.
This caused some giggles. Then McGonagall said with her glass raised, “To Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger!”
He stalked down the dark corridor of the boys dormitories, and then out in the Slytherin common room where a handful of students were hanging about before breakfast.
Harry looked around at them properly now, and he noticed, with a jolt, that the Slytherin’s were no longer sitting at their designated end of the table.
As Harry dug his head into Draco’s neck, he spoke through broken sobs, “I,” he sniffed, “I could’ve grown up with my mum and dad, and...and Sirius,” Harry choked on his breath again, “But they all, they all d-died, and I was left with...with them!”
They stood like that for a long time. Harry patiently waiting for Draco to speak first, not wanting to push him.
He folded his arms, and looked at her with a confident and challenging expression, “Got something to say Pansy?”
The other students began packing up and Draco stood clearing up his books and parchment. Harry felt as though he couldn’t move.
Draco giggled as he brought Harry into a hug, wrapping his arms around him. The blond kissed Harry’s forehead softly.
That was all the excuse Harry needed. He practically sprinted from Gryffindor tower, clad in his father’s cloak, and ambushed Malfoy in the darkened stoned corridor deep in the castle's bowels.
Harry clung to him; one arm around his waist and another around his neck, his hand softly caressing the blond’s hair at his nape.
The Slytherin’s voice had a smugness to it, and the boiling anger Harry had felt all day suddenly reached its peak.
“Gryffindors.” Blaise said as he pushed between Draco and Harry and headed for the staircases himself. Draco and Pansy then followed him and Harry realised he was the last one left in the common room.
“It’s alright professor,” Harry said suddenly bold, “Even if you hadn’t put me up to this, I probably would’ve done it anyway.”
Draco looked at Harry with earnest eyes. His mouth formed a small grin. Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco’s free arm reached up and Draco’s fingers graced softly down Harry’s cheek.
Draco peered up at him, only a slight hint of anger conveyed on his perfect face. “Why? Why now? We’ve been doing this for months. I don’t see what the sudden problem is.”
“U-ugh Draco,” Harry’s head lulled back against the door behind him. Then Draco had forced his leg in between Harry’s, pushing him even further up against the door.
Her knowing eyes seemed to expose every secret he kept in his mind and his own eyes scanned back and forth between hers nervously.
Their loud singing left them breathless and then Seamus fell on Harry and Harry fell on Ron and they ended up a tangle of limbs on the floor, laughing hysterically.
It was, Harry couldn’t deny. He’d experienced the worst moments of his life alongside them so he was bound to feel security in their company. But that all too familiar ache of longing tugged at his heart. Still to this day Harry hadn’t known how to numb it’s feeling, so he just resolved to let it tear him apart.
As Draco palmed him deeply, Harry moaned as he came strongly. So much tension built up over the past week, all over Draco Malfoy, and it was Draco himself who brought Harry to his release.
Harry couldn’t look at him. He was just grateful the room was dimly lit so that Draco couldn’t detect the fear splattered across his face.
“Er- I just gotta do something… Up in my room. I’ll be back in a bit!” Harry spluttered as he set off at a brisk pace toward the spiral staircase.
Breathy moans sounded beside Harry’s ear as Draco rode out his high, and only a moment later, Harry was coming too; bucking his hips and gripping Draco’s blond waves tightly as he moaned out Draco’s name.
Harry just stared at him. He was never good at hearing compliments, much less ones given at this early in the morning, and much less ones given by Draco Malfoy.
Harry was painfully hard now. With Draco’s arm so tightly wrapped around him, and his soft lips resting against Harry’s forehead. Draco was irresistibly beautiful. Damn him, Harry thought. This wasn’t fair and the tension built over the past week was really at his breaking point.
On Wednesday night, Draco seemed to be overprotective all of the sudden. They had both been in the common room late at night, Harry with Ron and Seamus, and Draco with Theo and Blaise. When Harry had bade his friends goodnight and walked up to his bedroom, he heard quickening footsteps behind him climbing up the stairs.
“Nevermind that. How in Salazar’s do you even know all this about the eighth years ‘Mione?” Ron asked.
Draco, avoiding Harry’s eyes at all costs, began to follow his friends out of the Great Hall, looking completely miserable.
They were to meet Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill and Fleur, Charlie, Percy and George in the Three Broomsticks, which was where the family would be staying over the next few days, aside from George, who had his own rented apartment in the village.
Dumbledore chuckled, “It’s interesting. I told you long ago that to the well organised mind, death is nothing but the next great adventure...I suppose this is what I meant.”
His body froze. Harry was somehow entirely awake now. The two were still lying face to face, but Draco had shifted up slightly during the night so that his lips now graced Harry’s temple. Their hands were interlaced between their bodies, and Harry realised his other hand was resting on Draco’s bare hip.
“Harry and Malfoy no less than a Gryffindor and Slytherin,” Dean chimed in now from Seamus’s otherside.
“You’ll like my pillows then,” Harry gestured behind them, “I only just found them like this before you came bursting through my door.”
Harry’s head lulled back, allowing Draco more access at his neck. His eyes fluttered closed in the immense pleasure that Draco brought him, suddenly realising how blissful this all felt in the early hours of the morning.
It was close to midnight and he’d just left his dorm with the invisibility cloak draped over him, that was until his feet lost their balance at the sight of Ron and Hermione sitting by the now dying fire in their common room.
McGonagall, Hagrid, Slughorn, Flitwick, Sprout, Trelawny, Madam Pomfrey, Madam Pince, as well as fifteen other students were mingling around the table, all with glasses of wine or butterbeer in their hands.
That night, Harry and Draco sat alone in the Slytherin common room. It was well after midnight. Harry’s excuse was that his bad dreams kept him awake anyway, and the adrenaline he felt around Draco kept him wide awake, so Harry readily succumbed to his self-destructive behaviour.
The blond's hair still fell into his eyes, obscuring his expression. He didn’t say anything. Instead, he moved forward and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and dug his head into Harry’s neck.
“So you really don’t know where she’s gone?” Harry asked Ron demandingly, finally breaking the silence. The redhead was pouring over a Quidditch magazine.
“I agree with you Harry, I think Hogwarts is where you should be, and…” She paused, before glancing back up at him, reaching across the table to hold his hand, “I think Dumbledore would be proud of you. He never wanted anything to do with the Ministry either, so I think that really does make you his man ‘through and through.’”
Draco’s smirk was undeniable, and all Harry could do was grip Draco’s tie tightly in order to stop himself crumbling to the floor with desire.
Harry figured he drank so much already, what was a few drops of truth potion going to do. He actually figured, being at that peak stage of drunkenness when one felt absolutely invincible, that he needn’t even take the potion, for the alcohol would have him spilling the truth regardless.
“As you perhaps already know... your rooms,” She gestured to the archway behind her, “will not be shared among your previous dormmates. You will occupy your own room. Two spiral staircases sit behind me, girls on the right and boys on the left, and don’t worry Mr. Weasley, the girls staircase isn’t bewitched.” The eighth years laughed as Ron stood red faced. “Furthermore, due to the magic we have embedded into this tower, as well as the castles own ancient magic ingrained in the walls, your rooms seemed to have formed impressions of their owners once we placed your names upon the doors.” At this, many of the eighth years gasped. “Of course, this shouldn’t stop you from rearranging and transfiguring your room into the way that suits you, in fact, myself as well as the other staff encourage you to express yourself as much as you can. So, plainly, you have free reign toward the design of your bedroom.”
Draco was sitting cross legged underneath Harry and he pulled back to admire the brunette sitting on top of him. He reached up once again and graced his thumb along Harry’s cheek bone, then pulled him back down for a passionate kiss.
As Blaise wiped his eyes, he said, “I wouldn’t put it past them. But who cares? We know the truth now. My God, wait till I tell Pansy!”
Hermione let out a sigh and muttered to herself, “Boys.” She returned to her Prophet as Ron spoke again.
“Course you’d defend them Harry,” Hannah gave him a dirty look before rising from the table and leaving the Great Hall at a brisk walk.
“Young is right Harry,” Hermione interrupted him. “Young enough to still be considered children according to some.”
“Honestly Ronald all they did was stare at each other and swap names. C’mon let’s keep going my feet are aching.” Hermione set off again down the aisle and Ron and Harry followed along in her wake, Ron chuckling on their way.
“Well, I guess we’ll see won’t we...Course, if I did score the role, and I got to choose out of the three of you, we all know who’d it be.” Draco looked at him carefully, a playful and insinuating expression on his face.
“I should’ve followed him,” Harry was muttering to himself, “If only I’d just gone out there with him, he wouldn’t be in this mess. I should be up there now! Banging on McGonagall’s door.”
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. When they pulled away, Harry pulled Draco’s sweater vest over his head, and then they remained fierce eye contact as Harry began to undo the buttons on Draco’s crisp white school shirt.
Ron and Hermione however, didn’t look shocked at all, in fact, they looked as though they were expecting him.
Rosmerta looked impatient, “Then you do that! But clear out these people while you’re at it. I’ll not have fights outside my pub, it’s bad for business!”
“Put your wand down you git! What the hell are you doing?” At this, Ron looked between Harry and then down at the couch, where Draco Malfoy was sleeping peacefully. Harry looked around then and saw all of the other eighth years surrounding him and Draco on the couch, some looking shocked, some looking curious, and others, (Hermione, Pansy and Blaise), with smirks on their faces.
But the boy who stood beside the bed couldn’t suppress his grin. His arms were folded against his chest and he looked undeniably pleased with himself.
The next few days leading up to Christmas were some of Harry’s happiest. Harry and Draco simply couldn’t keep their hands off each other, and since there were barely any students in the castle over the break, they’d gotten into a habit of holding hands, pecking each other in the hallways, simply being carelessly affectionate. Ron, Hermione and Blaise had gotten used to this. Hermione would look at them adoringly, whereas Blaise and Ron’s mutual discomfort at the sight saw the two developing an unlikely friendship.
Harry knew all too well what he was talking about. He smiled and said, “I know exactly what you mean.”
“I think there’s a few of us here who’ve developed more than a friendship,” Pansy said smirking and flashing her eyes at Harry.
Once again, Draco was confusing Harry into madness. The blond’s moods seemed to change as frequently as the enchanted sky in the Great Hall, and he plainly expected Harry to adapt to them. And the worst part of all… Harry did.
Blaise threw back his shot, then looked back at everyone with their full glasses in their hands, “Blimey you’s are innocent!”
Harry didn’t have it in himself to pretend he was fine. Instead he squeezed his eyes shut, brought his knees up to his chest and covered his eyes with his palms. He had heard faint footsteps beside him and after a second, he felt Draco’s warm hand close on his shoulder, then slowly run along his arm to tear one of Harry’s hands away from his eyes.
By the time Harry got back to the common room in the evening, there were only the boys lying about. All the girls were up in their rooms getting ready for the eighth year party. Harry was still wearing his Quidditch robes from this morning, still unable to muster up the motivation to get changed. It was only 8 PM. They’d all just come back from dinner and Harry was feeling pleasantly full and lazy.
They stared at each other once more, and then Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s middle bringing their bodies flush together. Harry’s hand glided up Draco’s bare, toned stomach, up over his chest to rest on the boy’s neck. Harry nuzzled his head into the blond’s throat and kissed his soft skin tenderly. As their bodies lay closely intertwined, Harry could feel Draco’s still hardened member against his own, their bodies still waiting for release after hours of build up and teasing.
He tightened his hold on Draco, persistent on not letting the moment end. He felt the blond’s body fall back into Harry, stirring. And then Draco slowly rolled onto his back blinking his grey eyes open to look at him.
Then they looked at each other, and Harry was sure he saw the same feelings Harry was feeling in the intensity of Draco’s grey eyes.
Slowly, Draco rolled over to face him. Harry locked eyes with his and slowly descended into the mattress, pulling the doona up onto himself as well. They now both lay on their separate pillows facing each other. Harry had no idea what was going on, all he knew was that he loved it. He reached out his hand again so as to touch Draco’s face but Draco grabbed it this time. Harry thought he might push him away, but instead, he curled his own hand into Harry’s and let them both fall into the space between their two bodies. Draco slowly ran circles with his thumb over Harry’s hand, before he whispered.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut in frustration. After a few surreal minutes, the eighth year table was left only to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Blaise.
Draco pressed him up close to the wall as he gripped one hand onto Harry’s hip and the other onto his neck.
Before I work myself up again, I try to remind myself that Hermione’s studying to become the Minister of Magic. She reckons that change can only be made from within. So I try to have faith that by the time we’re older, these dumb acts of pettiness won’t exist.
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair as Harry deepened the kiss, feeling Draco smile against his lips.
He kissed her on the cheek before excessive amounts of food suddenly appeared on silver platters all around their table.
Once again Harry felt his heart begin to race, he wanted to talk to Draco again and he had absolutely no idea why. But, once more urged on by the atmosphere of the night, he got up, left his room, stood in front of Draco’s door, and knocked.
Harry thought it better to go along with this lie, he didn’t fancy Draco thinking Harry was there to be his bodyguard, even if Harry rightfully knew that if anyone tried to hex him they’d better prepare themselves for the wrath of Harry’s wand.
“So then-” Draco interrupted her, “-We decided to do something special for you. I felt terrible Harry. I had no idea.”
Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the night; still air and starry sky. Or perhaps it was rejuvenated Gryffindor courage that seemed to rise to the surface, caused by the mere proximity to Hogwarts. Whatever it was, Harry felt himself stalking up to Draco Malfoy.
The journey to Hogwarts filled Harry with feelings of safety and waves of nostalgia. The picturesque views outside the window filled him with happiness. Clear skies shining over the rich greenness, glistening lakes reflecting the blue of the sky. To Harry, the landscape seemed to depict the freedom he felt inside him.
And then his two best friends got to their feet. Ron squeezing his shoulder lightly as he passed, before they left the Great Hall, leaving Harry alone at the eighth year table, utterly speechless.
“Blimey ‘Arry, you’re really going for it tonight,” Seamus laughed as he watched Harry swallow another shot of Firewhisky.
Encouraged by this gesture, Draco began trailing kisses along Harry’s shoulder, nuzzling his head deep into Harry’s throat.
“I don’t know,” Harry said looking between Ron and Blaise, “I’d say those two give Draco and I a run for our money.”
“They’re drunk,” Draco said beside Harry, as they both were looking at the unruly sight of Ron and Blaise.
Harry huffed in frustration. One minute Draco was vulnerable, the next his walls were up and he antagonised Harry in his own defence.
In light of Draco’s initiative and openness, Harry was currently sitting on an armchair by the fire in the common room, looking down at the floor where a Wizard’s Chess board lay, and where, remarkably, Draco and Ron sat by either side of it.
Harry couldn’t argue with that. Ron shrugged. Then the three of them headed for the eighth year table.
“Course not,” Harry said at once, propping himself up on his elbow. “I’d say I have a hundred scars from the past seventeen years. You just get used to them I suppose.”
Harry gripped the fabric of Draco’s skivvy, “Yes. I know we’re both mental, but I can’t imagine myself with someone who's not.”
Simply knowing that Draco was babysitting Harry’s godson left Harry in such a state of lightheaded happiness, he honestly thought he might drift away to heaven.
When Draco eventually rolled off of Harry, he cast a wordless Cleaning charm and they both settled under the covers, seemingly sleepy, blissful and content.
“Oh never you mind.” Then Harry heard the squelch of a kiss assuming that Hermione had just pecked Ron on the cheek. At this, he reset his brisk pace out of the Great Hall and toward the eighth year common room, feeling once more, widely grateful for his friends.
I also heard that the Christmas break is being extended this year at Hogwarts. The students are supposed to leave on the 12th.
But the boy had already laid face down in the opposite direction bringing the doona up around his shoulders. There was still a space of neck though exposed to Harry, and, not wanting to waste any chances, he slowly reached out and ran the back of his hand down the back of Draco’s neck, in a caressing motion. As Draco didn’t move away, Harry then began to run his fingers through Draco’s hair, and the soft texture reminded him so vividly of Hedwig. He found himself never wanting to let go.
“Blimey! This is brilliant innit!” Ron said beaming. “Yours is pretty much the same as mine Harry, course, just a few extra Quidditch posters.”
Ron looked partly surprised, partly hurt at the fact that his best friend wouldn’t be joining him in the Auror office. Hermione had that fond, motherly look on her face.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s dark, messy curls, then broke the kiss to say, “I think we need a shower Potter.”
“I just feel like you guys are making all the effort,” Harry said honestly, “At least, that’s how I see it anyway.”
“By ruckus,” Ron said, “Do you mean, running into trolls, falling into the chamber of secrets, getting maimed by giant hairy dogs, floating at the bottom of the Great Lake, riding invisible horses? That sort of thing?”
“And it all worked out in the end...And people I’d never thought I’d be friends with, well, we’re friends now, and it feels great.”
Hagrid had brought in his usual twelve Christmas trees that stood proudly decorated along the walls of the Great Hall.
But now it was if they’d reached a place that went further than physicality. They had only exchanged a few words, but Harry knew he and Draco had finally penetrated the unspoken truth that lingered between them for so long. And they had both admitted toward the mess they’d created, and yet here Harry lay, beside Draco Malfoy, wrapped in his arms, falling into a surprisingly peaceful and undisturbed sleep.
Draco hummed a smile into his skin, “We both know that’s true… After all, we hate each other don’t we?”
“I dunno, Kingsley seemed pretty optimistic about my Auror application. Don’t even need my NEWTS he says, right Harry?”
Draco had just lined up his body at an extremely sensitive position for both of them and their kiss broke as they gasped and groaned.
When they’d reached the door to the common room, they met Ron being virtually carried by Dean and Neville.
“Look, as much as I want to make you study, I’ve learnt by now that nothing I do will help. But I know that you haven’t stopped mid essay because you’re tired…” She looked at him closely, “You’re distracted Harry.”
When the seven of them made it into the common room, Ron, Draco and Blaise were singing obnoxiously and completely out of tune.
“I can’t help but ask,” Draco stared into the fire, “We haven’t been back to the castle for more than twenty-four hours and you’ve approached me four times already. Why the sudden interest if not for thinking I was up to something?”
Harry and Hermione had fallen behind them, grinning at the sight. Draco looked back at Harry apprehensively, but all Harry could do was smile. Ron, his best friend, with his arm tightly thrown around his boyfriend’s shoulders, about to introduce the anxious Slytherin to the entire Weasley family.
Harry instantly felt their magic intertwine, immediately easing his anxiety. He squeezed Draco’s hand in response.
Outside his room, he could hear loud footsteps and the dragging of trunks down the spiral staircase as the other eighth year boys prepared to depart from the castle.
Harry heard Draco’s breath hitch. Harry began sucking lavishly on the soft skin and before long, Draco’s head was falling back and his eyes were closing, humming in undeniable pleasure.
But so far Ron hadn’t detected anything suspicious about Harry’s behaviour, instead, the red head was looking at the list of the newly appointed mentors for each Hogwarts subject. The notice must’ve been put up overnight.
Harry dug in his pocket and pulled out his Snitch, the one he caught in his mouth back in first year and the one Dumbledore left to him in his will.
“Well...I’ve got little to no chance getting a job anywhere due to my track record. But...McGonagall’s the only one who believes in me, so...Maybe try to get a job here, in the castle?”
“Yeah, Pansy and the others want to go for a look,” Draco said, keeping his gaze forward at the wine glass in front of him.
Blaise obliged calmly, smoothly lifting his T-shirt above his head to reveal a toned chest, shoulders and stomach. ‘Yep, I definitely like boys,’ Harry thought to himself.
“Well somehow the rest of school maintains their houses, but the eighth years operate without them,” Ernie said as Harry nodded.
Harry looked at him seriously, “I am.” So the truth serum was still stirring in his bloodstream then.
Harry reached up and dug his fingers in the wet hair at Draco’s nape, pulling him in for a kiss. Draco responded by cupping Harry’s cheek and wrapping his other arm around Harry’s waist.
Harry was already so turned on. They hadn’t even spoken yet but he found he wanted this more than anything in the world. He reached up and gripped Draco’s soft hair, bringing the blond’s head into Harry’s neck, motioning him to suck.
Although Harry wished desperately that Draco would be back at Hogwarts by now, the letters that were going back and forth between them provided Harry with solace, and not to mention, pleasure.
Draco made his way over to the bed, waving his wand so the lights dimmed around them, “I guess that’s true.”
“You were always a restless idiot...And I was always looking for a fight...We were the perfect match.”
Harry felt a dozen eyes on him once more and coughed awkwardly into his hand before returning to his pancakes.
Then the three remaining Slytherins turned to look at Harry, who apparently couldn’t find words, or his feet. He was glued to the spot, full of disbelief that this was all really happening and knowing that once Blaise told Pansy Parkinson, the whole goddamn entirety of Hogwarts would know that Harry Potter had spent the night in Draco Malfoy’s bed.
Harry swallowed and cleared his throat in a futile attempt to disengage from the beauty that radiated from Draco.
Harry moved closer to him. Draco still averting Harry’s eyes. Harry slowly reached over and ran his hand down Draco’s chest, feeling the softness of the fabric of Draco’s top.
Draco’s grey eyes glistened in the dawn light breaking through the windows. And Harry kept his fingers tangled in his platinum hair.
“Brilliant! If they’re any help tell me. I’ve read a few, but none have sparked any inspiration for me yet.”
“I don’t want anyone punishing him for anything,” Harry said loudly, his gaze boring into the pompous Pattison. “That fight in Hogsmeade was provoked. The git admitted it to me after Draco and Blaise were taken away- Wait, where is Blaise anyway? Harry frowned.
“Oh get over yourself,” Draco chuckled, before he lifted one hand beneath Harry’s shirt, letting it roam against the skin of Harry’s stomach. Harry groaned before he could stop himself. “I’m flattered I drive you mad Potter.”
“Wait!” Hermione had interrupted her. She reached into the pocket of her dress pulling out a small vial of what Harry could only assume to be Veritaserum.
It’s getting harder and harder to be away from you. I don’t know how to explain it but I just feel like there’s something between us, there always has been. I feel like I’m going mental, but it’s probably just the lack of sleep.
Harry smiled fondly at his friends, and at the memories of their first year. He’ll never forget what it felt like riding his broom for the first time.
“Alright Luna?” Harry asked as the long blond sat down on Ron’s other side and Neville sat down beside Ginny.
Harry's heart was leaping. He knew he and Draco had gotten each other off last night but hearing Draco’s admittance made him feel a hundred times better. But what did it mean? Harry still didn’t know if this was what Draco just did with his friends. Harry recalled the arousing images of Draco and Blaise making out, and knowing that the two of them had definitely engaged in something of the like before.
Harry decided the only way to shut the overly energetic children up would be through magic. He wordlessly cast a Silencing charm and all of kids' open mouths were suddenly silenced.
Draco glared at Harry, and Harry glared back, suddenly filled with anger. He wanted so badly to hex him right then and there, in front of his friends.
She made her way into the compartment looking so content, Harry actually felt envious. Neville followed in after her and then Ginny finally made her way in and plonked herself next to Harry.
Draco then brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and kissed over the scars softly. Harry watched, mesmerized. But no sooner had Draco’s lips left Harry’s hand had the blonds eyebrows begun to form a frown. He stared off blankly at the wall, lost in thought.
Harry really hoped Draco was referring to Harry’s body at large and not the stirring sensation in his pants that seemed to occur after he realised his fingers were connected with Draco’s.
For once in his life, his future wasn’t burdening him. The love of his life lay peacefully upon his chest. ‘The love of his life,’ Harry thought to himself, ‘Could this be real?’
When he made it down to the Great Hall for breakfast, (purely by memory as his head was still spinning and this thoroughly disturbed his vision), he slowly made his way up to the eighth year table, still desperately clutching his head.
Harry was sure he’d heard him wrong. He looked at Draco’s face and saw it shining truthfully against the blaze of the fire.
“Draco...Thank you for telling me this. I...I appreciate it,” Harry looked at him, “Truthfully I never had any friends before I came to Hogwarts. Ron came into my compartment on the train, and he accepted me straight away. I’d never felt that kind of feeling before.”
It was true, and Harry and Draco both knew it. In fact, they’d never totally overindulged in their relationship, they’d always leave each other wanting more, which only added to the thrill and pleasure of their secret fling. But the more they met up, the closer Harry became to Draco, and he’d become terribly afraid of what was in store for their fate.
“No I-,” He let out a deep breath, “I wanted to give him back his wand. I guess I just fumbled too long in my bag. We missed the carriages, and walked up here together.”
Draco watched him out the corner of his eye, then moved slowly to lay beside Harry, pulling the doona up over them both.
The whole sensation of their wet bodies as the water poured down on them, the fog continuously encompassing them, and the way Draco turned Harry on so fiercely, was too much for his brain to comprehend.
The sight of Draco, his hands effortlessly shoved in his pockets, his Slytherin robe deserted to reveal his Slytherin sweater vest and white shirt, laughing casually with Ron and Blaise, turned Harry on no end.
Draco was silent for a moment, apparently thinking, before a mischievous grin broke out on his face.
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. He leant down in a flash and reconnected their lips, the two of them moaning into the kiss.
When the sky fell into a velvet blue, Ginny, Neville and Luna left their compartment, the trio changed into their robes, and soon they felt the train begin to slow. As they got onto the platform night had fully fallen, but it wasn’t dark enough to obscure the white blond head movie gracefully forwards through the crowd of students.
“Oh it’s great! I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many plants! And my windows seem to be positioned at just the right angle for sun and all!”
At this, Draco was up from his bed. He pushed Blaise hard that the boy stumbled backwards, but continued to laugh in earnest, and then Draco strode toward the bathroom and slammed the door behind him.
Harry shook his head, he felt suddenly sobered. “You were going through so much...You...I saw you crying...I could’ve done something-”
The silence went on, aside from Blaise’s chuckling. Harry sat there helpless, silently begging for Hermione to step in and save him once again from his increasing mortification.
“Mmm, you’re so hot,” Draco began a trail of kisses up Harry’s chest to his neck. Harry groaned, his head falling forwards onto Draco’s shoulder.
Then Draco’s hand was gone and he turned to head up the path. Harry bent to grab his bag and sling it over his shoulder, for some reason missing the touch of Draco’s hand. He shook his head and hurried after the blond.
After an unknown amount of time had passed, Harry realised they’d reached that point in the night where all inhibitions were lost, and they both could just comfortably share silence.
Draco giggled, “No. It was the summer wasn’t it? We had time to get off by ourselves whenever we wanted to.”
“I understand your decision Potter. After what you’ve been through, it’s only fair that perhaps the Dark Arts isn’t for you.”
But not a moment later did he grab a fistful of Draco’s frustrating sexy robes and pulled the blond into a rough and passionate kiss.
“You guys are so beautiful. Hermione that dress looks so great on you, Ron is so lucky isn’t he? Draco did I ever tell you how much I love the colour of your hair? It’s just like, you know, it’s like, so blond! You really are-” Harry hiccuped again, “-so handsome.”
You’re not going mental. You’ve got no idea how much it turns me on to hear you’re wearing my clothes and sleeping in my bed. As for the crimson rug...perhaps my bedroom thinks there’s a place for a certain Gryffindor in my life?
About fifteen brooms flew out of the shed. A few of the kids screamed but then each of the brooms turned and lay next to each of the first years.
“After all I’ve done...and what I’ve seen, those morals are so important to me now,” Draco whispered. “I only wish I’d learnt them sooner.”
A few more hours had passed. The eighth years had moved on from Truth or Dare to play Spin the Bottle, and to Harry’s disappointment, he didn’t get to kiss Draco.
It will be the 12th tomorrow, so I hope that means you can come back. Most of the other kids have packed and are ready to leave for Christmas break.
“I’ve learned to take a page out of Dumbledore’s book… And give second chances when they’re due, and to be brave enough to trust others despite their history.” Hermione said and politely returned to her book.
“Draco, please don’t tell me you snuck Potter into your room back in the day?” Blaise said, his eyebrows raised.
Sighing as he lifted his head, Harry looked at Draco through sleepy eyes, “Are you sure you’re not a Legilimens?”
Blaise cut him off, “Well yeah? You’re Mr oblivion,” Looking at Harry knowingly, “Like I get it, you had to save all of us from certain doom, but that’s over now. And...you’re not as subtle as you think Potter. Whatever’s going on between you and Draco, it’s obvious enough to all of us,” He gestured to Ron and Hermione, “Pansy’s just an impatient brat, to put it lightly...Anyway enough chit chat, your boyfriend’ll be here tonight. See you’s later.”
