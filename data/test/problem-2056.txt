I didn’t need a mirror to realise I had. I sensed it when my body changed, adapting and settling down on its new skin. And it was comfortable.
“I’m asking now, Potter.”
It seemed if they were going to be much closer friends, Harry should take wins where he got them, though he doubted it was boring. There was real pain sketched underneath her annoyance, so he dropped it.
“What I had to.” Draco's eyes have been fixed on the door since Luna went in to talk to Harry, despite being a paediatrician.
Draco didn't have many friends, and they lived very far away from everyone else. Teddy didn't mind that, because he loved Draco and Draco had always been everything he needed, but Draco had always seemed lonely. But then, Harry had joined them and Draco was smiling again like he meant it.
"You can’t do that. I don’t care what he was saying about you—"
Pansy becomes Harry’s new Healer, under the supervision of Healer Cameron. They’re both the only ones Draco and Harry trust with this, and they pick up the pace as soon as they’re on the case. It hurts Draco that he has no say in Harry’s healthcare, but he’s allowed some additional time off to be with his husband—one of the perks of being married to the Saviour of the Wizarding World, no doubt.
Draco scoots nearer, reaching blindly until he makes contact with Harry’s hands, his arms, his neck. Maybe if they’re close like this, he won’t perceive the alarming hopelessness in his gut, the dread filling his chest. “Harry, what are you talking about?” He’s not surprised his voice barely comes out.
that only Draco knows. It’s something to hold on to from someone who’s gone. But Harry’s not gone, he’s not dead. He’s alive and Draco still lost him.
You barely wasted a second glance on my body, and it made me beam.
Draco watches many emotions flicker across Harry’s face, though none stick. His expression sets in the same resigned, distant stance as before. It hurts more than he expected. Harry has to feel something.
Harry does tell him. He seems distracted enough that the change of subject slides between them easily. He tells Draco about the time he spent with Charlie Weasley in Romania, and Draco laughs when he realises what ‘
Draco smiles gently. “I am sorry too.”
"What's the difference between what you pretend to be and who you are, if you pretend all the time?" Draco asked, frowning at him.
He moves on to his bedroom, the one he insists on using despite it reminding him so much of the man who doesn’t want him.
"What do you need me for?" Harry asked.
"Just because it's old doesn't mean you should keep it," Draco said. "I know that’s funny coming from me."
“You’re alive and well,” he says, finally. Draco nods to the Mediwitch standing on the other side of the bed. The woman silently leaves the room.
“I can do it,” Draco declares, albeit unsure. And then, once more with feeling, “I
that. Being with Harry feels right. When they cook dinner together, or when Harry hugs him after a bad day at St Mungo’s—and those are becoming more frequent since the first headline on the Prophet—when he holds Harry close to his chest after a nasty nightmare, when they kiss. When he’s pushing inside Harry.
"So how did you get him to take the appointment with me then?"
It’s still a very rotund budget, but considering their main income right now comes solely from Harry’s fortune, they want to be intelligent with how they spend it.
"The drying charms make my hair poofy," Harry explained.
"Oh fuck. I mean, shit. I thought she was joking about knowing you. Nice to meet you, Harry. Very nice to meet you. Huge fan." From Padma’s expression, he wasn’t usually this nervous.
"Do you think it’s still got something to do with lingering Dark magic?" Harry asked Ron on a Tuesday afternoon.
There’s a rather curious recount in an old journal about a couple who had their souls bonded, and that it acted to save their lives when one of them had an accident. The soul of their partner had acted out and healed them through powerful magic. Draco wonders how much of that can be applied to him and Harry. His soul is keeping Harry’s in this plane, but what if… What if his soul is actually filling something…
"Not with the house, with Malfoy," Hermione said.
Harry frowned at any of Draco’s offhand comments, before accepting them as jokes and laughing. And Draco would always gape exasperatedly at Harry when he was particularly stubborn. It wasn’t enough to deter them from spending time together. Being together still felt like
"Take it easy. Have a good night, yeah?" Oliver whispered. Harry nodded. Harry could sense Winston, who was more than used to their weird displays of affection. They had been like this even before dating. Sex was one thing, but he'd sooner swallow tacks than date Oliver again. It had been too much like dating himself, if he was more well-adjusted.
That wasn't quite it. Of course, he wondered. He wondered about what his parents would have thought of his career in professional Quidditch. What would they have eaten at Christmas? What was he missing? He wanted to know which set of grandparents would have given him dusty sweets and which would buy him itchy holiday outfits.
Harry will never talk to him again. And Draco can’t change this.
, Harry had said, a week earlier, knowing enough about Draco’s hectic schedule that he’d need some time to organise his hours in order to fit the new appointment.
"There’s more to be done, but you should start thinking about it. It’s important for you to pick magical objects that resonate with the house, something that makes you think of a home," Draco continued.
So, when Draco hears his own name being called behind him, he turns around, almost falling on his haunches.
this again.”
Harry grins cheerfully. “It will. A lot.”
For once, Harry was grateful he had kept this house.
"Uncle Harry, do you work here?"
"Summons. My mother has commanded me to come to dinner and explain myself." Draco crumpled the parchment. His breath was shaky and uneven.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
"You can’t just change the subject every time I’m here. You do need to pick anchor objects," Draco said. "We should do that sooner rather than later."
The answer escapes Draco’s grasp. How can he say something he doesn’t yet know? There are so many things wrong.
It’s small, but it’s enough. He can picture Harry trying to write a letter to him and coming up empty. He can picture the amount of discarded crumpled paper on the floor. It doesn’t matter that it's only one question. Harry wants to meet him.
“You’re crazy if you think I’m turning away from you because of this, Potter.”
"It was eighth year. You weren't there. It was just a weird time. All any of us did was study, drink, have breakdowns, and have weird grief sex. It was like the world’s worst ongoing orgy."
The first thing Draco registers is her arms around him so tightly he might pass out—either out of breath or affection. And then, trays floating around their heads, the scent of meat, spices and sweets filling his nostrils all at once.
"I can certainly drink to that." But Draco refrained from explaining his remark any further.
Harry hesitates for a few seconds, though, when it comes to him. He sighs, then smiles. “You sound like that violin. And like the purr of a satisfied cat, and...” he stops himself, shaking his head and giving up on whatever he was going to say after that. “That’s it. It’s weird, isn’t it?” He huffs. “Do you have any scientific explanation for it, Dr. Malfoy?”
"I’ll catch up on some of my other files. Research," Draco said. The last drawer held a tiny carved silver bottle with a Stasis Spell, and they both looked at it for a moment.
And I did, as I held you close.
The war had taken a lot more from the Malfoys than their status and fortune for reparations. Lucius had been justifiedly locked in Azkaban right after the battle, only to die a few months later. Draco’s and Narcissa’s destiny  wasn’t the same in the light of Harry’s endorsement during their trials.
The first thing he notices is the Tree of Life. It’s impossible to miss it. It’s as huge as all the gossips’ descriptions. Its trunk is thick and of a dark, almost black wood.  There’s ample space around it, as if no other tree dares to grow too close to it. Branches that look like veins draw patterns in the night, poorly illuminated by the moonlight filtering through its leaves. Shadowy roots slither across the ground beneath his feet, leading to a body lying motionless on the grass.
Draco can’t say he hasn’t thought about the possibility of getting a no. But that’s not what he’s got until now and he’s prepared for this. He’s prepared for Harry’s doubts, his fears. They share most of them, anyway.
"I’m not a baby!" Rose insisted.
He can try his best. That was what Harry repeated to him all the time, wasn’t it? They were trying their best when they met again after the war, when they held each other in cold and dark nights, when they tried to stick their pieces back together.
I nodded.
Draco takes in Harry’s words. Harry’s not wrong. Draco misses what they had, what he felt having Harry by his side. He misses the way his heart fluttered when Harry smiled at him. Harry’s sticky notes saying
“Won’t it make the curse spread faster? I won’t have any magic to protect me from it,” Elle asks.
They poked around a little more, and then Harry declared, "After that, we’re having a drink."
"I need to work on this statement, but I’ll see you around," Pansy said. "Drop by and we can have lunch."
And it’s not like he hasn’t seen Harry at all during this time. Harry still stops by St Mungo’s to visit Elle. He still smiles sheepishly at Draco whenever their paths cross. Harry never stays, however. Always polite, but never willing. They don’t talk, Draco doesn’t hear his voice anymore, and has to watch him from afar.
“If you say so.”
Harry felt vague twinges of guilt in his chest because he was being a bit terrible, wasn't he?
, Draco repeats, not allowing hope to settle in his chest.
"You're Harry Potter."
“You opened my Floo,” he mutters, following suit and pushing a chair to the corner of the table, far from his friends. None of them try to reach closer.
“Right now?”
“Are you coming back to stay or just visiting?” Marvin asks.
“I did this to you, didn’t I?” Harry asks, fingers gently stroking the scar that crosses Draco’s collarbone. “In sixth year.”
Inevitably, he would battle his way across the back field to the stables. The Malfoy family was renowned among Pureblood society for their champion racing thestrals. His father forbade him from going near the foals every spring, lest he spoil their carefully monitored diet with too many sugar cubes, or tempt fate with an unsupervised gallop through the woods. His father needn’t have bothered, however, since between the hours of eight and six o’clock the stables buzzed with activity--veterinarians weaving webs of glowing diagnostic spells, farriers nailing magically-enhanced shoes into filed-down hooves, trainers and jockeys putting each thestral through rigorous exercise regimens, stable hands mucking out stalls and levitating in fresh bales of hay. There was no room for him then.
"No, get Milo to cover her. Montrose’s defensive line is about to fall apart."
The truth of his words almost slips from his grasp. How could he forget the importance of that? Harry is awake. That’s all that matters.
Pansy’s magic slips to envelop Harry’s head, assessing his brain and cognitive functions. Draco examines her work with interest, even though he’s not been Harry’s Healer for years now. He does not notice Harry’s eyes doing the same.
"You’re winding me up," Harry accused. Draco didn’t even pretend he was doing otherwise. "Don’t use your bedroom voice on my house."
Hermione exhales loudly as the fight leaves her body. “Is he really? Oh, my…”
“To accept this life, to try to live it would mean giving up on many things he can’t right now,” she presses on and Draco muses how many times she’s rehearsed this speech before finally laying it out for him. “It doesn’t mean you and him will never be... together again. Just that Harry wanted to live without the bond of a marriage he doesn’t remember.”
“Yes, sure. Thanks,” Potter splutters. “Later is good.”
Harry scoots closer, still keeping enough distance that their thighs are not quite touching, and balances the album on both their legs so that Draco can see it too. Draco suppresses his  automatic response that he’s seen this album so many times, he knows it by heart. He can get used to Harry coming closer to him by his own volition, and he stays silent and peeks at the picture Harry’s pointing at.
"That's fine," Draco said. Draco poured them another glass, Harry asked the house for another bottle, and they went trudging upstairs.
She grinned. “You kept your eyes.”
It was a small acknowledgement that Sirius had meant a lot to Harry, but he appreciated it.
“Yes. It is,” Draco nods, uncertainty straining his features. This is something he had expected. Draco expects Harry not to want to live with the imposed bond, but it still hurts. “But I don’t know what would happen to you without my soul to attract yours. It’s too dangerous. I don’t want to leave anything for chance.”
“Their loss.” Draco winks, before turning his attention to the patient’s sheet by her bedside table.
Draco glances around once, barely recognising his own room. Not Harry’s. This is
After some more pleasantries and a promise to send season opener tickets for Diane, Harry left the fire, went back to the parlour, and gave it over to Draco without a single glance at the scroll.
Luna snapped a photo later with Ginny and Harry on either side of Ron, both in their black training jackets and matching thumbs down for Ron’s horrid orange Cannons scarf.
He can’t deal with it now. With Harry, with their bond, their history. So he closes himself off, he shields his mind from it. He shields his office from the outside world and screams and screams and screams.
Harry must have thought so, too, because after that his cheeks were very red and he kept staring at Draco until night fell. Then Harry sighed before hiding in the little alcove they had transformed into a room to sleep alone.
"Tell you? There was not a chance you weren't going to be weird about it. Like you're being right now. "
"But you hated me," Draco said, facing him properly now.
Draco brought out a long, thin golden thread and silver needle. For all his flinching about the blood when he broke the plate, he didn't hesitate to prick his finger and begin weaving over the burn mark where Sirius' name had been blasted off of it.
Her laughter is louder now, still disbelieving. Elle shakes her head. “I’ll take whatever you give me.
PRTDN had taken the appearance of a burlesque club now. While a woman in feathered costume sang on the stage, people curled in on themselves upon the many red velvet couches.
He relished the shock of the icy dew on his bare toes and ankles as he leapt about, waving a twig like a wand and imagining that the tendrils of swirling fog were traces of spells he cast across the warming fields of Wiltshire. He dueled spectres in the vapor rising from the damp grass, vanquished foes that lurked behind bushes and trees, and bowed before kings and queens grateful for his valiant service to their empires.
When Potter says he can’t talk to his friends about it, Draco is the one who truly understands why he feels like he needs to hide this disconnected and fearful side of him from the people who expect him to be perfect. When Potter tells the group he is lost, and he can’t bother anyone else with his problems, Draco wants to yell at him to stop being stupid, because he’s sure people would love to help him, and people would be by his side, and he deserves it. More than anyone.
Janet finishes her story. Marvin says something to his right. And then Potter’s gaze is  on him again, heated and calculating.
rather desperate to meet Harry. To just lay eyes on him again, despite the fact that he can’t touch his tawny-brown skin, his wild black hair, or kiss those full flushed lips.
"You’ve got a guest," the staff member said. Teddy burst through the door.
But why?
"Where do I find someone who specialises in house magic? Is that even a job?" Harry reached for a biscuit. Blaise slapped his hand away.
so young. Sometimes, when Harry looked at him and thought about what his childhood had been like, it made him sick. But Teddy was very different than Harry had been. Teddy needed to be reminded of his manners. Teddy chattered away to friends and family. Teddy did most of his chores sloppily, if at all. Harry loved him like that.
Harry shrugs, finally meeting his eyes. “I mentioned it to Pansy, actually, and she told me its name.”
Harry is not asking him to move in, Harry is proposing they, together, find a place they can share, a place that’ll have both of their approval, a place that’ll be
. He wants to hear Harry, to let Harry’s moans of pleasure penetrate his skin and mark him. And never leave him.
It’s been like this since Harry left his house three weeks before. He tries not to think about it, not to be hurt by it. Draco was getting used to not having Harry, before their encounters started becoming something more of a constant.
Draco runs to him, kneeling in front of Harry, hands cupping his face urgently. Harry’s staring straight at the window, at the nothingness growing outside. Draco forces his head around, but Harry’s eyes stay focused on the glass.
He obviously doesn’t tell Harry he doesn’t actually do the cooking there, but how hard can it be?
The owl hoots again, staring at Draco’s impossibly enormous smile.
It’s hard to say where his own grief ends, where Harry’s begins. Their magic has always been like magnets, pulling them together. Now, however, the tendrils of their energies intertwine themselves as their souls claim each other in a bond Draco doesn’t know how to deal with. It pulses between them, reverberating whatever they try to hide behind hooded eyes and half-truths.
Harry’s roaring laughter echoes behind him, but Draco isn’t sure he’s computed the offer properly. His cheeks burn furiously, and he tries not to choke as realisation dawns on him.
“Please, don’t.” Maybe he does have to slow down. With a sigh, he subsides. “Alright. Fine. I’ll take a week off. Are you satisfied?”
There’s barely any disturbance in the grass where his body had lain. It’s as if he’s never been there at all.
Last minute, Stella broke out of the formation and waved Atty over. Portree’s Captain didn't look pleased to be facing their rookie, but the whistle blew and Atty took immediate possession of the Quaffle and passed straight to Sam. Sam zipped up the centre with Luc and Milo trailing behind and scored in the first ten minutes, with an aggressive fake out. It set the tone for the match.
“How do you know it will work? Binding magic is unstable and difficult to perform. How can you be sure you can do this in such delicate conditions?” She sizes him up, before shifting her dubious gaze to the book on his table. The old pages display a section Draco's been reading before talking to her, about ancient bonding rituals, with the illustrated figure of an amphora.
What did he hope for? That Harry would wake up, and they’d be together and happy forever?
It was the closest Harry thought he had ever been to falling in love.
"How do you know that?"
When Harry’s eyes widen a bit and he doesn’t reply immediately, Draco regrets his sudden courage. He’s not a brave person, he’s never been, and every time he tries, it backfires.
"You’ll have to sign a copy of the cover for my wife. She made me promise," Stella said. It was a long running joke; upon meeting him the first time, Darcy had swooned. Harry wrote "Darcy, won’t you run away with me? - Harry Potter #60," and Stella cackled with delight.
The dark-haired girl is the one who recovers fastest, squinting up at him. “No way,” she barks, shaking her head. “You hired him. You’re paying him to say that.”
"Wait, are you retiring?"
“Let me cast some more diagnostics,” Pansy offers hurriedly, taking her wand back. “Talk to me, let me know if you feel any discomfort or—”
"Thank you so much for having me here. This award goes to the most innovative and promising Seeker in the Junior Leagues…"
"Ronald, the proper order of things is that you finish your speech and then you cry," Molly called. Ron muttered something and used a shirt sleeve to wipe at his reddening face.
Harry says nothing else as he passes three pages of pictures before stopping and poking at a new one. In the picture, they’re both lying on the grass under the shade of the creamy, white flowers of their dogwood tree in the house's garden, during one spring. It’s motionless as it’s Muggle, but Draco can almost feel the breeze and warmth of the memory prickling his skin.
This had been Harry’s favourite mug. Draco got it for him as a present, right after he’d started art school. But there’s no point in holding onto Harry’s favourite mug now that Harry’s not here to drink from it, he muses, dropping it on the floor. The ceramic smashes with a muffled sound. A thousand red pieces cover the tiles.
, is wondering about whatever attraction exists between them. He tries to keep the smugness out of his grin. “It’s not that kind of attraction. This is all on you.”
From the moment Harry sat at the table, he knew that Theodore Nott did not like him in the slightest. He watched Harry like he was liable to steal the silverware and set fire to the carpet.
“There were only two wizards there. An old apothecary and his son.” Harry continues, unaware of Draco’s internal battle. “They helped me control my magic.”
, you attacked my mouth. I didn’t want to breathe; I didn’t want to think, I just wanted you.
Draco doesn’t quite understand how she can know the right path when everything around them is white nothing, but as soon as he takes the first step to follow Elle, the landscape starts shaping itself around them.
, he had said—Harry wasn’t happy.
. Draco’s not sure he can. “Can you give me another chance?”
Draco gets to see the drawings, though, two weeks later in a park close to the centre.
do this.
Draco plasters a smile on his face. “No. Let’s stay. Buy me another drink and pretend to be my boyfriend for the rest of the night,” he asks, and Blaise happily obliges.
Draco's been smoking on every break since Pansy's revelation. And when he meets Elle again later that week, her face scrunches up. Harry is there once again, and Draco's heart does a painful loop.
Hermione won’t let slide the way his cheeks burn or how stiff he gets whenever she enunciates Harry’s name. The fact that he’s been avoiding her and Pansy since the first of Harry’s midnight escapades doesn’t help either.
"Mum and Grandpa Ted were in Hufflepuff. Dad’s parents, Dad, and you were in Gryffindor. And Gran and Draco were in Slytherin," Teddy said, screwing up his face in concentration. He was getting more concerned about what Hogwarts was like the closer September came.
Harry remembered what Draco had told him about house magic. So he sang to the house a little while he cooked and cleaned. He wasn’t very good at singing, but the house didn't seem to mind. Then went for his second workout. Draco didn’t return until late evening, looking quite a bit more flustered than usual. His hair curled damp on his forehead. He held out a black velvet ring box, head bowed.
Oliver wanted to play Quidditch and be left alone otherwise as far as Harry could tell. Harry had wondered sometimes about the timing of their relationship. Whether the rumour Oliver had left Puddlemere to play with Harry Potter, his boyfriend, had been easier to work with publicly than the idea that his team hadn't wanted him anymore. Harry couldn’t hold it against him either way. The League could be difficult, and they had loved each other in their own limited way. Just not enough to stay together and make it work.
"I should go," Draco said. His hair was a mess. Harry stood up too, wincing at the ache from the hard floor. Draco leaned in first with a kiss that was all sweet satisfaction. He took a second one with his hand cupped on Harry’s cheek.
“I said you’re beautiful, especially from this angle.”
So he focuses on himself for now. Despite the fact that his life is just a series of lonely days. Draco had been alone before Harry. He can certainly do that again.
Granger opens her mouth a few times, but no one has the will to say anything after that. Luna gently creeps close to Harry’s side and holds him, murmuring something about Nargles.
"Someone also stole some items from your parent’s home in Godric’s Hollow out of the Auror’s evidence vault. Ordinarily, it would be almost impossible to track."
Potter’s cheeks flush, and he looks down at his  intertwined fingers resting on his knees. “No. I... I feel like I’m dead most of the time. Like I never woke up from, er, the accident. Like I’m slipping. Sometimes I feel like hurting myself... I want to feel.
“Oh, you know. Just us, mom and dad. I think George will be out of town and Ginny has practice.”
“I’ve lost something,” Harry says louder, his voice wobbly, a hand leaning against a tree.
Harry’s perfect, and he’s worried about Draco. About how he feels, though all Harry can see in him right now is a stranger with a tainted past.
"Should I use it on you instead?" Draco teased.
They both stare at the empty door, and Draco is the first to cut through the silence. “Is that okay with you?” he asks, pulling away to see Harry’s face.
Going out became less of a struggle when I realised I needed a couple of days to recharge, after being around so many people, and when I started to respect that.
“She also said she loved you very much.”
Harry straightens and pushes a hand through his morning-messy curls, stifling another big yawn behind his palm. Draco’s heart clenches.
"It's nice that you have her. I'm so happy for you. Like, so happy." Maybe Harry was verging on tipsy.
The music is louder, almost deafening. The time to go is getting so close, Draco can barely keep his eyes open. His words are flowing in a sea of clouds. He closes his eyes, presses his nose against Harry’s neck.
The laziness of the early days of summer nestles inside Draco’s bones as he rests his back against the tree trunk. The side of his shoulder touches Potter’s and although it’s too hot for the contact, he doesn’t pull away.
“Did we have a cat? Hermione told me I keep sketching it.” Harry inquires, raising a brow.
"Sir?"
"Are you an athlete or an activist?" Lee asked.
Harry isn’t swayed so easily. His words, though bringing a pang of loss to Draco, are strong. “If I had a chance to talk to my parents, even for a second, I’d take it without thinking.”
If tears run down his face, they’re cold and bring an icy burn to his cheeks. Draco really thought he had no tears left to cry.
Harry hums, staring at his own hand firmly gripping the album. Draco
He contemplates burning everything down and building a new house from scratch, there’s no way he’d still remember Harry then. That’s when he hears the voice coming from the living room.
Why is he apologising? Draco wants to ask, but finds that his voice doesn’t come out again under Harry's stare.
He wants to burn it all. He
Harry’s face falls, and guilt tugs Draco's chest.
He had never heard about this, about any of this. Draco hasn’t been in Harry’s painting room since the last time Harry was awake. How could he, when it only rubs in his face the fact that he might never see Harry’s skilful fingers drawing again?
"Why don't you talk to Draco?"
"Oh, you know, Hogwarts. Same as ever. Plants are good. Kids are good. Bear is about five months old now." Neville chattered away, catching him up on the House Quidditch cup.
His mind works fast, recounting the events of the last weeks. Hours. Minutes.
Draco doesn’t stop talking, casting his gaze at the rest of the group instead. “Thank you,” he huffs an embarrassed laugh. “I’m terrified to start, to be honest.”
. I’m going to be back at work at six am tomorrow. And I’m here instead at home." She pouted but, when it didn’t work, handed over the pack.
. He opens his mouth, but she doesn’t let him say anything.
Draco follows the sound because somehow he knows it’s taking him in the right direction.
"Absolute nonsense! He attacked my player!" Coach was also screaming. Coach, at one point, switched to Spanish, in which he said a number of rather rude things about the referee's eyesight and mother.
The walls closing around him have never felt so cold and unfamiliar. Bare. Not even the bright red flames on the hearth are enough to heat the coldness inside his bones.
Coach was in fine form for the annual midwinter ‘train harder’ speech.
The way Harry says it makes Draco’s body pleasantly hot again, and the lunch is almost completely forgotten when Harry drops to his knees between Draco’s legs.
Mrs Weasley sizes him up with care in her eyes. “I was so worried about you, Draco. I wish I could’ve come earlier, but you know how things are.”
She’s gone.
The words came to Harry as if compelled, "Draco Lucius Malfoy, I have learned that you possess a Potter signet ring. I ask for its return."
"No, it’s not bad. This will be easier than it could be. You know that gathering feeling when you’re about to cast? I want you to take that and hold it until you feel you have a bit of magic the size of your fist."
"I appreciate that," Draco said. He took Harry through a list of other visitors, verified all the owls should be redirected to his mail service, and offered some additional protections.
He listens to the voice in his head reminding him what Harry needs right now is space. He needs rest and familiarity, not an agonising display of affection. Draco convinces himself it’s the bond’s magic, electric, crackling between them, and not his own feelings surfacing through his fingers.
“You’re not coming back now. I don’t need a healer with his head elsewhere,” she starts, and when she continues her voice is so sweet and sounds so alien coming from her that Draco cringes inwardly, “Draco, I mean it. You haven’t had enough time to process all of it, you need to—”
“I know exactly what I’m getting myself into. Or you thought I didn’t know the Golden Boy would come with a lot of drama in the package? I’m not about to let you go because some dark curse wants you.” He feels the certainty in his words before it fully takes hold. “I’m going to break it. And you’re not going anywhere.”
"Oh. I was obsessed with you in school, but no. And you look better now than at sixteen."
"Ah," Harry said. No wonder Draco had looked so embarrassed.
"Yeah," George said, hanging his head. A chill from the stone bench set in Harry's bones and he shivered. "I just..." He trailed off.
The Red Hart seems small at first, intimate and comfortable. But then Draco notices the way the tables are scattered loosely around the place, far from each other and making it seem smaller than it truly is. Dark walls surround them and only a faint yellowish light gleams. There's low music playing somewhere, but the small stage by the corner is empty.
“There’s no way
The way Harry’s eyes dart from one building, to the trees surrounding his old campus, to the assortment of students scattered around is endearing. His magic spills out of his body like waves, the warmth of it crashing against Draco’s own. Draco tries showing him everything he knows, despite having visited the place only twice—once to exalt one of Harry’s art exhibitions, and another time to deliver the papers of his dropout, when Harry was so far gone that he couldn’t attend the classes anymore.
“Draco?” they hear, in a strangled murmur.
Pansy hushes and hugs him with promises of
He wrote Neville via his mail service:
. He hadn’t realised sacrificing dark magic near a Tree of Life would open a direct portal to Limbo. A place that, according to ancient Celtic magic, has no concept of time, light, or emotion.” And that’s why it had worked with Draco. The Dark Mark, even when Voldemort was gone, was enough to maintain some amount of darkness in him. When it was sacrificed near the tree, it opened the portal to Harry. He motions with his hand. “But somehow, your soul kept connected to Limbo, and it was... pulling you back.”
Harry stumbles out of him, body falling flat on the bed and a cheeky smile  on his lips. He turns to Draco, hand hovering over Draco’s waist, but not coming in contact.
Somewhere along the way, Draco might have missed a sign that his life was on a path towards utter destruction. He can’t trace back to when things got out of control with Elle’s spell. With Harry. With his own life.
“I lost you. I lost you and I was all alone again,” he says once, before he can hold back the frightened words. Or tears.
Still, he comes to Draco with all kinds of questions. Draco has to fight a brighter grin when he answers.
It’s ironic now that his first instincts are to resort to Muggle techniques when he’s in a tense situation, but that’s exactly what Draco does. He checks Harry’s pulse, his index and middle fingers placed on the side of Harry’s neck, counting the rhythmic heartbeats he can get in a minute.
“Would you like to take a walk?” Draco blurts out without thinking.
as well. You had wanted the same thing I did; you had had the same idea. Your face was different, something as disconcerting as relieving now, I noticed, watching your bushy brown hair, round features and thin lips. Despite that, I recognised the two bright moons beaming in the club’s lights, eyes that had been following mine for years, never really finding them.
with Harry that had come out this morning. Barb had shown him the advance a few days prior.
"The house is yours. But your claim is bound and reinforced by certain ties. The house won’t behave until it’s indisputable, but the house is tied by both magic and wards. With your family’s things, the house will be bound to your family name. With your things, the house will be bound to you."
"And what are you drinking? It's grey." Draco wrinkled his nose with disgust.
“Harry, I’m so sorry about what I said to you,” he goes on, voice pained. “I once told you I love all of you and it remains true, even if you don’t remember it. I love you for the impertinent, arrogant child you were.” He lets out a chuckle, and Harry still doesn’t show any sign that he’s listening. Draco bites his lower lip, pressing Harry’s fingers. “The teenager who sacrificed himself for the world. The adult I’ve come to know and lived by my side. And I love you now, because despite having no reason to, you still decided to see the best in me, to have faith in us when I was blind to it. I hope it’s not too late to have you back.”
Pansy sighed. "You know, that spell works on everyone else but you and Percy. I deserved one.
It’s not possible. The spell he performed had been a success. He had cast diagnostics on her before he went home. There had been no sign of the curse in her body, or in her magic.
Marvin shows him around and Draco realises it has, in fact, changed more than he had noticed at first. The room they used for the group sessions is still the same; large and empty, with chairs piling up close to the walls. But the rest of the interior is more alive. There are new paintings in bright colours and abstract shapes hanging on the walls. The doors now have coloured plaques with numbers and letters he can’t decipher. All the furniture has been changed or painted anew, though the overall design seems to have remained the same. There is one entertaining room that didn’t exist before. It features a television and various children’s toys. A couple of kids play with dolls and don't pay attention to them when they cross the room.
He doesn’t want to share what little he has with this boy who’s got everything and everyone by his side.
"Your parents had seven of you," Harry pointed out.
"Should have brought your boyfriend," Ron said when they caught each other in the upstairs hallway. It was too cold to continue celebrations outside once the sun had gone down.
“Yes. Just Ruby,” Harry sighs, his voice weak, teeth grazing Draco’s collarbone.
On the tenth day, Draco said to Harry something he always said to Teddy,
Harry’s talking to him again, and that’s enough for him.
Sighing, Draco puts down his wand. The floating tendrils of magic fade, softly merging with the background. He’s been trying to discipline himself regarding Harry. He asks no more of Pansy, avoids reading news about Harry, since the whole
"Come here," Draco said. A delighted shiver ran up the back of Harry’s neck at the brush of his rings when Draco clasped it shut.
"Do you wear it all the time?" Harry asked.
He paused, searching for the right words.
"Do you want to meet the team today? I think you saw most of them at camp, but…" Harry trailed off. Teddy, who played it fairly cool most of the time, lit up at the prospect.
"Why do Luc and Atty both look like you just gave them the bollocking of a lifetime?"
“No,” his word cuts the air sharp and bitter, patting Elle’s arm before she lets it down with a sigh. “I told you to work on your muscles and exercise, but I’m guessing you ignored my recommendations as you always do.” He lifts a brow, staring at her askance.
“Harry?” Draco calls a few times, crossing many cabins with closed doors. He tries opening the first ones, but when they don’t budge, Draco just keeps following the corridor.
Draco is left with the warmth of Harry’s skin against his lips, the heat of his magic, and he wonders, can he really have this?
"Not—the house knows I have a valid claim by blood. So I have to be more careful than usual until you claim it, so I don’t complicate matters further," Draco stammered through.
He sits down, finally, in his usual chair, back toward the window and the table below that will hold whatever food the group brings for the meeting. This time, Draco brought some leftovers moussaka his boss let him take from Egeu, the restaurant where he works that serves Mediterranean cuisine. His eyes are fixed on the door and anyone coming in.
"I don’t really care," Harry said. They were talking about the finish of a fixture. "Like, I want it to look nice, but I don’t…care much."
Of course Harry doesn’t know. He never asks about them. Draco flinches, thinking this will be the time Harry will run away. But Harry’s eyes sparkle for a brief second, and he asks Draco to tell him more. To spend more time with him.
Granger stops, face constricted, and Draco can almost see the engines of her mind working. She buries herself in another book for an hour, and no one has any expectation of rescuing her now that she’s delving deep in whatever theory she’s brewing.
"There’s a record player in the study, but all I have is the Muggle music Sirius left behind," Harry said.
Harry shifts between his arms, turning so he’s facing Draco. “Wanna come with? You can see my place.”
"I can change it if you want," Draco said.
much.” It seems redundant to say it now, as his whole body beams with what he feels. His smile is broad, and his fingers must be warm, even if there’s no warmth in this place. There’s still magic—the magic holding them together like magnets.
“I’ve been better,” Draco lets out, when none of them seems too willing to start again. “But I’m glad you’re awake. That’s everything I could’ve wanted.”
"I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that," Andromeda said, standing by the door. They were both all dressed up, Andromeda in jeans and a jumper meant to look like a Potter jersey, Teddy head to toe in grey and white, including a new pair of Falcons trainers that Harry was mildly embarrassed to remember had a design that bore his name.
Draco’s heart does a loop in his chest, and he’s sure it’s skipped a beat completely. To have Harry in that room again, staring at him with those expectant eyes, is almost enough to break him. He sits down by Harry’s side, letting his hand rest between them, and tells Harry about their life.
Draco smiles softly. If he could just hold him for a second. Touch his hand, assure him that everything would be fine, like Draco’s friends have been trying to do to him. Harry is
"He…uh…he died," Harry muttered. Right after the war, but before Harry signed to Falmouth. Harry wasn’t even sure whose funeral he was returning from, but he had come home from one to find Kreacher lying curled up in front of Regulus' room. He still missed Kreacher in a strange way sometimes, being in this house again. He might have kept it up and tried to stay if Kreacher was still around.
Harry stirs, almost causing Draco to stumble back. The bond flares for a single second. He turns his gaze to Draco, it’s still clouded, but it’s more alert now.
Harry knew where she was leading. "And you think by showing the entire world my bum I can entice them into reading about homophobia in sport," Harry guessed. Barb left a pleasant smile on her face in response. He sighed. "I'll do it. All money to SafeHome, please."
"Thanks," Harry said. "If you let me shower first, I can make breakfast?"
he says.
Harry spent his time fiddling with the playbook at home. The Kestrels had overcorrected in recent years. After being left behind by a style of play that favoured more precision over brutality, they had built their team nimble and light. But it was also easy to push them out of formation because of it. Harry was setting up to have the Falcons pin their Chasers away from each other, keep their Kenmare's Beaters occupied with Milo and Luc's Bludgers, and brute force their way into as many goals as it took for Min-woo to find the Snitch. Drawing out the game wasn't in the Falcons' favour.
Harry took his time filling out the form, so it was nice and legible. Blaise scanned it carefully and then flicked it into his bin.
"Don’t you want to stick with your friends?"
"What did EuroQuidditch call you once?" Stella asked. She was grinning wickedly, without a doubt awake now.
“They kiss.”
"My apologies," Draco said, like it cost him something. "We are working more collaboratively than I usually must with clients."
like the rustle of passing pages of a book, or the clink of glass against crystal. It’s soft, and comfortable. Ron sounds like children’s laughter, the bustling talk of a crowd, the cheers of fans after a good match. Pansy...” Harry hunches his shoulders, chuckling to himself. “Like a storm, thunder echoing in the darkness.”
"No, you have to explain this to me. Why a summer project?" Draco insisted. His leg was pressed up against Harry’s under the table.
“They must.” Draco’s words are barely a whisper, caught by  Harry’s mouth.
Draco merely raises an eyebrow. “I can assure you there’s nothing you can possibly tell me that will make me leave in the middle of the night.” And then he reconsiders, “Tomorrow morning, maybe.” But even Draco knows that’s hardly a possibility.
“He’s awake,” he repeats, trying to soothe his own frail nerves, and stares at Pansy. She is still sitting in the same place, preening at her achievement.
Harry Potter is the one who should have everything he wishes, not Draco.
“I’ll see you next week.”
"Someone fetch Nat for a haircut," Pansy called to her staff.
"All right," Draco said.
The Healers cleared Harry to join training again with a warning to come back if his shoulder twinged.
“Do you know where he is? I can’t… I can’t feel him.”
And then my sight caught yours, and I knew it was you by the way you
Draco takes it. It's easy. And they go in.
"Half the time I want to fucking kill him, but he was also the first person to come around when my parents disowned me, and I don’t know what I’d do without him."
Potter stares at him for a second, narrows his eyes and says, “No.”
again since Harry had been inside him, occupying himself instead with the focus he needed to perform Elle’s spell with perfection.
When Harry finally defeated him and Voldemort’s reign over the Manor was squashed, there was nothing left in it to be saved. The Manor had been taken by shadows, and by an emptiness so great it consumed whatever life tried to grow in there. Draco didn’t want to have anything to do with that place, the war, or what had happened. And when his mother moved out of the country alone after the trials, he'd had to fend for himself, unable to set foot in the Manor again.
“You did, but that’s okay, too, if your taste is different now.” Draco shrugs, and then points at Harry’s coffee. “Just go easy on those. I can feel your magic, and it’s still erratic. Too much coffee can...”
." Draco sounded stern but very, very fond. Maybe he did like magical houses that much.
"Well, not all of us are underemployed millionaire gym rats, so I'm going to go," Draco said.
"It’s part of who I am—"
Harry snorted and held a hand out. A bottle appeared in it as if Summoned. He handed it to Draco who read the label.
Draco hums in acknowledgement, ignoring the way the word
"Let them. I’m good for the money," Harry said.
before leaving the house. There’s a huge photo of a clearly annoyed Harry under giant capital letters spelling
Later, Draco found Harry in the hallway when he wandered out for some space. Draco leaned into Harry with no hesitation. He kept smiling, little crinkles forming in the corner of his eyes. It was a dance figure. Harry's hands were in his pockets, and Draco's arms wound around his neck as if they did this all the time. It was a scant inch or so that Draco was taller, but Harry still had to tilt his head up.
Draco can’t blame the elf. The creature tries to take good care of them; he’s been doing that since before Harry's coma. Whenever Kreacher isn’t at home, Draco knows he was by Harry’s bedside. He figures it hasn’t changed now, since Harry woke up. He can’t bring himself to call the elf when Harry might need him more.
"No one is fighting at Christmas dinner. Cut it out, both of you," said Arthur with a warning tone.
A rare lull washed over them, so everyone heard Miles where he had cornered Greg.
Draco shifts in his seat, ears alert, eyes trying to catch Harry’s every move. The way his body goes rigid, only to relax the next second, how his hands keep fidgeting over his knees, clenching and unclenching in the air. Whatever it is, it seems important, and that he chose to tell Draco and not anyone else is enough to have his heart joyously thumping in his chest.
Draco looks at the quivering drawer by his bedside. “No, it’s not.”
No, they haven’t. Draco can’t even imagine what is going on in Harry’s head right now, though he’s tried to, more than once. Draco can’t really relate to his seventeen year old self anymore, not in a way that resonates with what Harry must be feeling.
"But you could do this any time. If you want to learn to drive or play piano, you could start tomorrow," Draco pressed.
“Going to bed early?” he asks, a feeling of dread spreading in his stomach.
With the turn in the weather came some welcome changes. Draco left him notes. But sometimes he waited around until Harry was home from training, and they chatted.
"If my boss ever catches wind that I do this, I’ll have you all murdered," Gemma said, pointing at each of them in turn. She stood up and shook her head.
. I have the best of everything: the best wife, the best daughter, the best friends, and best family." Harry went to grab Ron off the table and, suspended in mid-air, Ron hollered, "Also, Cannons for the Cup this year."
"If that’s not a problem," Percy said, his voice all tight and clipped.
Draco shakes his head. What can he say? Harry’s right and it’s a certainty that uncoils mournfully inside him; he can’t let go of the past. It’s all he still has. It's all he'll ever have. Harry doesn't love him, and will leave him at the first opportunity.
“Not any I’ve tried, at least,” Harry says, making a face. “Hermione made me taste her entire collection. I think she has at least fifty different teas stocked there.”
“No!” Draco shakes his head and kisses the back of Harry’s hands. “I want you, babe. I want you every day that you’ll have me. I love you so much.”
“I thought you were a wizard, Draco.” Harry snorts, despite the slightest shake of his limbs, lifting the towel.
The golden lines flutter around her for a second, her magic an energetic pressure around him, when he utters the automatic response, “I don’t have any exes.”
The world around him stops as he registers Harry's words, “I want a divorce.”
Draco cries again, while nodding furiously. “Yes,
Three.
"Sorry, sorry," Miles said. He didn’t sound very sorry. "You’ll all forgive me? Too much wine."
“Why did you keep yours?”
Draco loved Vincent for many reasons, not least because he was there the day that Vincent was born. The chaos of foaling season meant Draco could slip through the stables virtually undetected as the racing team staff, his father, and their wealthy patrons were otherwise preoccupied. He watched--wide eyed and slack jawed--from behind a mound of hay as the vet murmured charms and wove a magical barrier around the mare’s hind quarters, reaching out a gloved hand to ease the baby into the world with a wet-sucking splatter. Vincent looked right at him, with his fresh, milky eyes, as his spindly legs and wet-paper wings flapped and flailed about.
"Not with you in the car, I hope," Harry said, raising an eyebrow. He was certain Andromeda had it covered, but sometimes he wanted to tell Teddy that he cared about him.
Harry hopped off his broom a few feet from the ground, one hand still holding the Snitch aloft. His teammates dropped all around. The stadium was so loud, he couldn’t hear anything above the crowd’s roaring even as he was being jostled and hoisted onto shoulders. Hot tears blurred his vision, and he had to brush them away.
"Ancient history really," Neville insisted.
"That hurts my feelings," Harry said. "I’d like to think I was hot at sixteen." Harry was joking, because he wasn’t much for assessing his own looks. In some important ways, he felt like the exact same person, even if objectively, he had gotten a bit taller and bulkier in the meantime. Harry had been eighteen by the time they got to the trials.
"But he wants…"
"May I look at the books before we dispose of them?" Draco asked. Harry raised an eyebrow.
"Theo," Draco called. "Theo!" He left Harry in the hallway.
“How long?” Harry asks.
There’s no Harry here now.
Harry felt there was something nice about waking up and knowing he only had to finish his morning workout. Draco was here, in the library. He was halfway between a set before he heard the piano again, clear as day.
"Mr Potter. Did you know I was at the door before I knocked?"
“Oh, shut up.” Draco’s cheeks burn with embarrassment as he shoves a towel into Harry’s wet hands, using his own to half-heartedly dry his hair.
The two years after Vincent’s birth are the happiest in Draco’s memory. His father noticed his particular attachment to the young thestral and, instead of shooing Draco away like always, used the opportunity to indoctrinate him into the family business. He was put in charge of Vincent’s care, and, as soon as enough time had passed, his early training.
"I told Hermione that it might be…nice to have another. And she said ‘what if our second kid is as smart or smarter than Rosie?’ so you know, I’ll never sleep again."
The mist he had seen before has returned, and it stalks his steps as a silent companion. Draco keeps walking for far longer than should be possible until he finds one open cabin after what he can swear were a hundred cars.
Drey nodded once and the secret in his eyes came to life and Teddy finally understood what it was.
Elle stares at him, eyes wet, a grin so bright it reaches her ears. “It worked. That’s all that matters.”
Is anybody asking Harry to understand how
“You could come for lunch with us this Sunday,” Hermione interjected, beaming. Her hand reached for mine, and I let her, even though all I needed was to hide under my skin. She pressed my fingers.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Draco replied, dismissively, turning to leave the stable and the conversation. He had tried very hard not to make friends, intent on absorbing all he could to take home to his father.
Draco had never been afraid of the darkness until he had to live with the Dark Lord under his roof. Now, though, he makes his way inside and out of the Manor as quickly as he can. He stops by the library to retrieve some books on ancient curses he knows they’ve had in storage forever, and leaves before the gloom stretching inside the corridors of Malfoy Manor becomes too much to bear.
Harry introduced them one by one while Andromeda stood in the doorway.
The minute Harry sat, Miles sat in Harry's lap and was insufferable half the night. Harry kept glancing over at Adrian, but he didn’t seem to mind, and Draco didn’t seem to care either. It also had the added benefit of keeping Theo at the other corner of the room as Theo seemed to dislike Miles about as much as he hated Harry.
"I thought the League was going to start fining people for partisan statements?" Percy asked with a look that was too knowing by half. Of course, he knew, but Hermione wouldn’t have.
“Harry thinks he surrendered himself to Voldemort a few moments ago.” Her voice is soft, contradicting her heavy words. He can’t believe it.
Now he could see clearly. The hesitation shouldn’t happen again. In general, Harry needed to rely on Stella more for all the central play, and they needed to stop looking at goal spreads for optimum Snitch-seeking, because their ranking was fine. At this point, they needed to maybe let the ranking go to number two if it was that dependent on ruining the rest of their play.
“We don’t have to go if you don’t feel like it.” You chided, “Personally, I am not eager to be in a room full of Weasleys and Gryffindors, to be honest.”
Well, Draco knows that. He feels it in Harry’s energy whenever he carries himself through the corridors and from what Harry had told him about feeling on edge when he woke up. But he still is here so often Draco sees him almost every day.
Before he can conjecture
"Is that meant to be me? I don’t sound like that. That’s awful. Come here. I’ll show you accommodating," Draco said. And what had seemed momentous was the inevitable conclusion of Draco coming here, to this house, to them meeting and knowing each other at all. They were always going to be like this.
"The way you feel towards the house will shape the house." Then Draco’s voice grew softer. "The goal for you is to like it, not tolerate it. Sympathetic magic, remember?"
They crushed the Kestrels 250 - 40 with Harry pacing by the bench next to Coach the whole match. It would have felt better to play, but it was better than nothing. They had a lull until the next three away games, so they took to their pub and celebrated.
"Attila!" Oliver called, with his pint in hand.
Draco’s afraid of the answer, because though Harry is here by his side, Harry’s also lost. Draco doesn’t want to live in a memory. He wants the real Harry back.
When Harry blew out his candles with the Weasleys, Teddy, and Andromeda, he didn’t make a wish. He didn’t believe in it anyway. But he remembered Draco in the kitchen, licking frosting from the plate off his fingertips when he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
"Well, your job is to make the house stop doing this. So stop it," Harry snapped. "I don’t want wasted food."
Every daybreak thereafter found Sir Draco tending diligently to his steed--his
Draco feels the heat of Harry’s body getting closer. He turns to meet guarded green eyes and raises an eyebrow.
Harry smiled. "Hand her over here."
"I don’t want anything from Sirius’ parents. Put it all in the trash where it belongs. It’ll be a guest room," Harry said.
She had never reacted to Harry’s surprise visits like this before. Maybe she had a guest, which might explain the car in the drive.
Draco only falls asleep long after Harry’s breathing evens out. Images of a pale corpse and lightning on a clearing haunt his mind, and even then he can’t be sure if they’re a presage or just dreams.
“You never had me. But I want to be here with you now, and you’re too afraid to see it. To accept it. You realise you’re trying to hold on to something that isn’t there anymore, don’t you?” Harry sighs heavily. “My memories might be gone, but I love you now.”
“Nobody knows what I did, except for Charlie,” Harry continues. “Apparently we had a thing.” He grimaces, not as much in distaste as Draco would have hoped, but in confusion. “He’s back in London for a couple of weeks and filled me in about my time in Romania.”
"How’s that then?" Harry asked.
"They are very nice tits. Award-winning tits, even," Millicent said, grinning.
"I thought it might be forward. He is very busy as Deputy Minister."
Harry nodded. Draco pulled him in close and landed them by Harry’s. Not at the Apparition Point, but not at the house either. There were the spins.
Draco came back at night. He sat down with Harry in his room, and they talked for hours after Teddy had gone to sleep.
It’s the bond’s urgency, his own fear that he’s going to lose what little he has conquered now and the recent discovery about Elle’s case that takes Draco back to the house where he grew up.
They had been learning how to be with each other again. How to love.
Their lips separated, but they kept their foreheads together, deep breaths filled the space between them.
Her eyes are barely open, unfocused, but she sighs at the sound of his voice.
Pansy’s gaze turns sharper, narrowing threateningly. “What are you talking about?”
“I was so nervous about this, you know. About meeting you, because there’s actually something I wanted to talk to you about. I was afraid of your reaction, but you… you seem nice.” He scowls as he utters the words, gripping his cup. But soon Harry’s trying a tentative grin once more. “I hope you don’t take it the wrong way.”
"This is excellent work gossip, you have to pay attention." Pansy flopped onto his bed, at home like she was Ron or Hermione. "Turns out, she’s been stealing player Healer records. Her father is trying to pay to make it go away." Harry dropped the clothes he was gathering in the bedroom in shock.
His flat is only two blocks away, but by the time they finally reach Draco’s place—purple painted wood, in a hall with dozens of monochromatic doors—they are completely soaked.
The majority of the footage features Harry unashamedly asking their guests to talk to the camera, with some skewed shots of the beautiful decorations. Mother had helped Draco not only pick their wedding rings, but plan the whole thing. He would have been happy enough with a smaller ceremony, but his mother always dreamed of planning a huge wedding for her only son, and Draco and Harry couldn’t say no.
Sighing, Draco sits on the couch, arm outstretched, but Harry recoils from his touch.
The grey cat follows them on their quiet stroll around the block, before disappearing inside a garbage bin. It’s awkward and strained, but the absurdity of the situation is such that neither of them tries to talk or leave.
"How did you know it was a Prewett watch?" Harry asked. He had worn it once this year, right before his first match. Draco didn’t answer, squinting down at the clock as if he could see all the coils and gears by looking at its luminescent face.
I grinned fully now. “Yes.”
Draco gave a dry, bitter laugh. "Oh she's not ill. I came running the first few times she wrote to me alluding to some mystery illness. She's faking it."
"I keep a lot of reference material on hand, and I haven’t had time to clear out in a while."
“I’m tired, Draco.” And it’s in his voice, in his weakened stance, in his more than often vacant stare. That fight is coming to an end.
His patient’s condition has worsened over the past few weeks, despite Pansy’s ministrations. Elle can barely lift an arm above her waist, not without a world of pain, in her own words. Draco doesn’t doubt Pansy’s competence, but he’s the one who was with Elle from the beginning, tending to her, listening to her quiet complaints and revolting with her when the Aurors never found the wizard who’d done it to her. He’s the one who understands the nuances between Elle’s sounds of discomfort or her magic flaring. If there’s anyone who will heal her, it’ll be Draco.
The corner of Draco’s lips tugs up, but he contains the smile.
Granger says the Weasley matriarch has been feeling lonely, estranged by her own spawn, since the last of her children left the nest. Ronald Weasley had been assigned an Auror mission in Ireland and decided not to come back, and the girl Weasley is often away practicing with her team. Draco makes a mental note to thank Mrs Weasley again afterwards.
“What is mine?” Harry deadpans so fast Draco leans back.
“Are you sure you want to do this, Harry?” Luna’s fist stopped mid-air, the brush dangling from between her fingertips.
Elle’s right there, in front of him. She looks younger than he’s ever seen her. Silky hair falls on her shoulders in even waves. The grin she gives him is gentle.
"I'll see you home," Draco said.
"Why does Blaise dislike you so much?" Draco asked.
Far from Draco to be annoyed by the company, even if it implies having to lend some of his hard-won clothes to Harry, or dealing with double the amount of mess that he’s used to—although he likes to call his own an organised chaos. Draco’s so used to Harry’s presence at his flat now that being alone in there feels almost weird. The apartment is… lacking when he’s by himself.
"If you want," Draco said, which Harry took to mean, make your case.
The flirting had started about a week before, when Harry had—accidentally, Draco had thought—pressed him against a wall when hiding from one insistent reporter in Diagon Alley. Draco had blushed too violently to pretend it didn’t affect him. It had seemed to amuse Harry to no end, which made Draco feel even more aware of his own embarrassment. After that, their touches had gained a more intimate tone.
. "It's not because I don't understand. But it should be all or nothing.''
"What will you do instead?" Harry asked.
"I don’t think you’ll like any of it," Harry said, though he didn’t really care if Draco hated it. This was his.
It was Friday. It was Friday and, two minutes past ten, and Harry was pacing in front of the entryway. For a moment, it seemed like there was going to have to be an epitaph on his gravestone. "After defeating a Dark Lord, here lies Harry James Potter who choked to death on an apology at the tender age of 27."
"You’ll have to keep playing the piano here," Harry tried to joke around the lump in his throat. "It’d be a shame to have it just sit here."
Draco saunters back to their booth, with the faint feeling that he’s leaving a piece of his heart behind at each step he takes. The pang of loss—his or Harry’s?—creates a lump in his throat. Will he ever heal from this broken heart?
There’s a Mediwitch waiting for him by the hospital’s Floo. The short, middle-aged woman is ready to take him to Elle’s room, as if Draco doesn’t know the way by heart.
, he muses. O
, Draco had thought, but he let Harry go.
“There’s something... I haven’t told anyone,” Harry admits, finally. His eyes dart around the room, insistent on avoiding Draco’s. “It’s nothing, really. Just...”
"It's not about Oliver for once," Hermione called. "It’s Malfoy."
Elle tips her head as he casts his usual spells to ease her pain. “So how is it?” she asks.
The errand didn't take Harry long, although he had turned into one of those weirdos who went to Muggle places in a cloak because he hadn't dressed expecting to go out, just back home. He bought three tins and came back to the Ministry with them shrunk in his pockets.
how I process things,” he pleads. “I need to do something. I can’t just… Please. I’m the best, you know that. Let me come back to work.”
"I understand a project of this complexity is frustrating. I assure you, although it seems like progress is slow, you will see results soon," Draco said. His tone was professional.
He tries not to look at it too much, at the windows falling to pieces, at the trees trying to root themselves inside the walls, at the dark tone they have taken since he left it to rot twelve years earlier. There’s nothing good this house can offer him now.
His letter to Harry had been short. He knows visiting their old home is something Harry’s been avoiding, but it’s also something that’ll have to be done eventually. That’s why, deep down, Draco had half expected Harry to respectfully decline. However, when the clock strikes eight, he hears three knocks on the door and soon after, Harry’s magic is spilling into his house.
Draco waited so long to answer, Harry almost changed the subject.
"Because I like Quidditch a lot, and everyone has to work. Next question." He wouldn't put it past Hermione to have taught her the concept of generational wealth so he was hoping for no more follow-ups from her.
The three of them burst into laughter. Both Julie and Draco have always known
Harry tapped his cheek with one finger. "You talked about bail bonds. Contracts. Adjudication. Torts." Harry had sat up with her while she revised for that one.
"Forget about who it belonged to. There are about a hundred magical houses in Britain that are this old, many of which are dying. The magic used to make them alive is unique. We
Draco opens his eyes, gaze trained on the mark on Harry’s heart. He inhales deeply, and can only feel coldness inside him when he gathers his courage and touches the black veins. They feel like emptiness. “Will it... does it hurt?”
It’s there, though. Harry always says so and Draco always feels it in his magic. It doesn’t taste bitter and acidic, as curses usually do for him. It’s something different, devoid of flavour or feeling, settling inside Harry’s core.
He couldn’t recall--
That’s something he has to learn to live with.
Elle tips her head to the side, frowning. She says, “I’ll take you to him,” and gestures forward with her head.
Pansy is right. They’re not together anymore, but Draco would never let Harry be hurt. He needs to tell him about the bond. He knows he’ll do what she wants—what he should have already done. But not before he figures out Elle's situation, not before he gives Healer Cameron a full report on what he intends to do to save her.
Draco’s stomach twists dreadfully. Whatever Harry is feeling, it doesn’t seem like something that will make Draco happy. It’s dark and painful, filled with guilt and doubt.
Draco adds, “It’s... I grew up with these customs. It’s always been a part of who I am.”
The terror of what has just happened spreads inside him, and the shadowy claws of hopelessness darken his vision before he registers his voice is almost gone.
"Are we friends then?"
“You’re smoking?” Draco asks, because he has to, although this is not all he wants to ask.
Harry took a few seconds before giving in. He could be home after midnight, and maybe being home alone
They’re here because of Harry. And Harry, much to Draco’s dismay and astonishment, doesn’t appreciate being the centre of attention, even if said attention is focused on his own wellbeing. That there was ever a time when Draco thought Harry Potter was an arrogant prick who craved attention seems a distant memory.
of the tree. He wanted to harness the magic of your grounds. Did he… Did he kill anyone in the house? Maybe near the tree?”
Draco noticed that Harry hadn’t moved his hand, it felt surreal, it felt like home. It’s when he realised what that glisten in his eyes was, it was hope.
clothes? As far as I remember, you’ve been using mine whenever you come over.” And he comes over a lot.
"Sit," he ordered Harry, and he did. Dragging over a chair onto the red patterned carpet. Draco fetched a black leather folio on the music stand. He shucked off his cardigan, rolled up his sleeves and flipped through until he found whatever he was looking for.
“Oh, Harry, it worked. You’re here,” Draco hears himself say, hot rivulets of tears streaming down his cheeks. His face is drawn to Harry’s line of sight as his torso hovers over him. “You’re really here. It’s me, love. It’s me. I’m here.
times.
“I don’t think I can take another heartbreak.”
The change of the topic seems to have an effect on Julie. Her eyes get brighter, though she doesn’t let go of Harry’s arm. Harry doesn’t seem to mind.
"This is not the official playbook, or you wouldn't be able to see what I was working on." Harry reset, frowning at the pressure he'd be putting on Min-woo. Atty was playing centre, but if she played right…
"Molly, we love you. We’re just trying to give you a break," Angelina said.
"It is unnecessary and fairly hard on the team to have the star player out of the game in an important quarter-final match, isn’t it?" The same reporter said.
Harry laughed. "Let’s just say people have a lot of opinions about what I should be doing. But I like doing my own thing. Always have," Harry said. That wasn’t what Pansy had written, but she nodded along.
"It was to let people know that not everyone is willing to tolerate reactionary rubbish," Harry said. "Someone had to say it."
He nods absently, shoving his nose against one interesting volume about house magic he’d been reading before the distraction. They’ve talked about it before, albeit never too seriously. However, when Harry says nothing else and Draco lifts his head from his place on the floor and finds Harry’s earnest eyes, he knows this time is for real.
"You can ask. I certainly don’t have to answer," Draco said.
Harry turned his attention to rolling them onto the bed sheets. He took one broad palm and traced the same path on Draco's skin where Draco had touched him. Draco watched him do it, heavy-lidded but alert. He looked better than Harry could have imagined. Harry pulled him closer again to kiss, revelling in the fact they could do this. Harry broke their kiss to throw his shirt off.
Harry’s anger is like a beacon, pulling Draco in, holding him in place, though he never snaps at Draco. He’s still as guilty as he’d been when he and Draco first met at the Community Centre. But it’s different now, because Harry wants to run, he wants to scream and to be left alone and, in turn, Draco wants to give him everything, to make him know that he’s loved and that he’ll give him space if he needs it. His hands twitch to hold Harry whenever his face falls or his brows furrow in a frown.
“I assumed as much,” she says, voice now low and worried. “Death—” the word doesn’t sound quite as right, too rough and frail, and Granger clears her throat before continuing. “Death is one way to harness this kind of power. It probably opened a path for him to corrupt your
“Keeping you alive? Yes, what else?”
He didn’t know what he was doing or why he was doing it but he brought himself forwards and captured Harry’s lips. Instantly thinking he’d made a mistake but Harry kissed back, slowly and softly, stroking his thumb against Draco’s neck and angling his head to kiss deeper. He was lost in the kiss until he moved his head a little more and bumped into Harry’s glasses.
"Yes, Coach." Harry wasn’t entirely certain he was joking.
"Should we expect anything better from Mrs Well-Actually-Grindelwald-Was-Hot?" Miles asked.
Then, without a break in between, they moved onto the bedrooms, and what to do with them. It was as though Draco wanted to remind Harry he was here to do a job. Harry needed him to complete the house which had taken to stealing parts of the pavement.
"I just don’t think it’s fair to you, Harry. We can’t keep calling you up whenever we need to sway public opinion. If nothing else, we all owe you that much," Percy said.
The first time Draco sees one of these daunting articles is during the third week after their divorce. Harry’s picture stares at him, the hand of a man the papers couldn’t name around his waist. Draco’s sure this is the day his life ends.
"We only deal with criminal matters, Mr Potter. This is civil. We can’t arrest your house for stealing from Muggles."
“I’m just a bit surprised you know how to…” Harry squints at the instructions Draco’s pinned to the board, voice filled with mirth. “Er, ‘pilot’ a washing machine and control the ‘people-eating box’. I’m assuming that’s a TV. If it’s not, I’m going to be worried about your house.”
The long paper inside holds one simple question in small letters, which seems like an exaggeration for the whole thing. Harry could have sent a smaller, more simple note.
But it also brings up another question. A more important question.
Draco called to a passing waiter for an extra plate and, without looking at Harry, scooped half his pasta into a plate and handed it over. Harry answered him with a squeeze of his leg under the table in thanks. Draco caught his hand, held it, and continued to eat.
Harry felt heat rush to his face.
It was the same, as Harry had asked. But, on one wall, Draco pinned all the photos, and another book was bound on the desk. Harry flipped it open to a letter dated July 2, 1972 and signed
“Yeah, I think I do.”
"Well, we know you’ve got several charities that you support. You’re a busy man. But readers will wonder: Is there anyone special in your life right now?" Lee asked. Lee had to ask, Harry knew, so he didn’t begrudge him the question.
develop into anything else.
"I thought he asked on the train to Hogwarts in third year?" Astoria piped up. "When I was in first year?"
“Yes, well.” He shifts uncomfortably in his chair, but doesn’t let go of her hand. “I would say don’t believe everything you read, but this happens to be true.”
He smiles, despite himself.
"Is it because you’re gay?" Harry said.
They sat like that until the sun sank below the horizon, taking any residual heat with it.
"I can work with your schedule. If we meet most weekdays until then, we can meet less often during your season. Let’s start."
One more flight of stairs. It felt like they should go through every door, so Harry did. He was used to his bedroom by now. Regulus’ bedroom was in cheerful yellow and blue stripes for Teddy, with the former master in a delicate pink with matching duvets as a second guest room. Harry hesitated before Sirius’ bedroom, and it was only Draco’s presence behind him that made him walk in.
They had noticed. And they had stayed.
"Thank Merlin. He’s at least decent," Ron said. He had a streak of flour smudging his cheek. Ron disliked Oliver on his behalf because he knew Harry could never bring himself to. That was the trouble with complaining to your friends about exes.
He devours his casserole with a goofy and undignified smile on his lips, and to Harry’s relief—and a flare of pride in himself—Draco forgoes another cup of coffee for the tea Harry’s brewed for him.
Harry shakes his head. “We never did anything like this.”
“I’m not giving you up.”
be attuned to Harry’s emotions all the time, when the slightest slip would mean having him gone, he can’t rest, he can’t stop.
Draco exhales with force and sits up, mirroring Harry’s position. He brushes a hand across his face and takes a deep breath, trying to smooth the remnants of sleep induced irritability.
Giving up trying to control his blush, Draco grins. “Thank you.” He has half a mind to say it’s their song. Or, it used to be. But he figures it won’t have the same appeal to Harry now as it used to have.
"Okay. I know, too," Harry said, as close to an allusion to their past as he dared make.
Draco paused. "This didn't begin as a magical home. It became one. But granted, it is more complicated than that."
"Right," she said. She sat down and started writing something on parchment with a peacock feather quill in very showy handwriting that Harry couldn’t read. He had seen her jot down things in pen during a media scrum, but this was more fluid and formal. She whistled sharply and a tawny barn owl swooped into her office and took the note.
It was strange, because it was his house, but Harry followed Draco around as he searched for something Harry couldn’t perceive.
He asks Harry now, “Was it true?”
She takes a long look at him, but says nothing, before setting the table in a corner and transfiguring one chair into another table. It’s not as elegant as his own, but it works fine to hold all the trays she’s brought. The wine, though, disappears somewhere inside the cupboards and Draco’s in no hurry to get it back.
Despite being terribly mortified about his meeting with Harry weeks prior, Draco still goes to Serendipity. He figures the press, opinionated as they are, will eventually find where he lives and the places he attends regularly, so he should enjoy it while his peace lasts. Still, Draco hides his face under a grey hat and sunglasses when he does so.
“Okay? Feeling better now?”
"Fuck, you’re so…" Draco said.
Harry laughed,
Harry didn't know what to say to that. He wanted to say he understood, but he didn't really. The Dursleys had been awful, but at least Harry had the assurance his actual parents had been decent people, even if he never knew them.
." Draco’s tone was teasing and amusement danced in his eyes.
It was almost like praise. Harry preened a little. "If you want to come watch a game, you should. I can put you on the list at the Falcons VIP box."
Maybe things will be fine, after all.
Harry turned his attention back to Stella's wife. Darcy was showing them something her terrier Crup mix named Pepper could do with his paws, and he smiled fondly at her. She moved on to show Milo’s current girlfriend.
would never suffice. Nothing would. Nothing feels enough. The words dry in his throat, and although all he wants is to lose himself in those green eyes again, he can’t bring himself to stare.
As he lies on his bed, staring at the poorly lit ceiling of his flat, Draco wonders if he’ll ever hear Potter’s voice in the meetings.
"I'm not a good Chaser. Ginny would wipe the floor with me any day of the week."
"But you still want another kid," Harry guessed.
Draco is still mortified about his attempt at kissing Harry Potter, granted that Harry was polite enough not to bring it up again when they parted ways after the park.
“Would you like to share anything?” the man asks softly, but Draco barely waits for him to finish before spitting out, “No.”
"I have picked. Piano, record player, hearth in the kitchen. All magical, all the symbolic heart of the home I want. I listen to you," Harry said. He wasn’t really listening now though. It was the first time in more than two weeks Harry had been in the house with him for any significant amount of time.
“I have many regrets, Draco,” she says gravely. “But the biggest one of them is that I have let pride impede my relationship with my son. I have lived with that pain, and shame, and the doubt that you would ever want to speak to me again.” She takes a deep breath. “I shouldn’t have pushed you. I should have protected you and cared for you when the world turned its back on us. I failed you as a mother.”
Harry doesn’t reply for a while, and Draco starts to reconsider his question. Maybe it’s too early for that.
"Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Pansy were all busy," Harry answered. Ginny reached up to adjust his tie, a boring black. Harry could see the headlines already. Always a fabrication, but never anything he dreaded, never anything remotely true.
He shed his blanket reluctantly and hopped on his broom to do a few low circles.
The booth they take is private enough, and once Blaise returns with their drinks, they fall into a pleasant conversation.
"Just a little something. Didn’t take more than a moment," Molly said, making a dismissive gesture. Hermione, George, Andromeda, and Harry all tried not to laugh when they saw the defeated look on Ron’s face.
They spent the afternoon giving the house more magic. Harry was not, he discovered, inexhaustible.
"Come on, then," Harry said.
Harry is in his living room and this is a sight Draco had given up on witnessing again. Harry simply
Having run out of expensive stuff to buy his friends and family in the last few years, he bought a Wizarding hammam-style spa day for Andromeda and Molly, a lecture series with a pilot for Arthur, a voucher for international Portkey travel for most of the adults, and so many toys for the kids that Hermione started giving out her extendable gift bags every year in anticipation.
Harry was a little bit embarrassed. "That was blunt."
Diving into his job, or going out with Blaise again, doesn’t work. Having lunch with Pansy and Hermione does little to diminish the clutching in his chest. They are certainly aware of what Draco’s done, but none of them brings the subject of the bond up.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco smacks his arm, unable to contain his own chuckle.
. Kids screaming everywhere, loud conversations they had hoped I would join. Laughter and cries, noise, noise, noise. It hurt. It physically hurt how I didn’t belong there anymore — how maybe I’d never belonged. I was the broken piece that couldn’t fit.
"Work on it. Let’s do some diving drills. Form one!" Coach shouted.
Then, Draco jolts upright, eyes wide and senses sharply returning. He has trouble separating the reality of his surroundings and the dreadful memory of death. “He’s awake.”
“I think I’ll call you Pax,” he whispers as he sketches, delighted by the foal’s high-pitched chirps, “it means--”
"I would like it if you came to the end of the season matches," Harry said.
Draco locks himself inside the bathroom and the argument between his friend and the elf drifts away, muffled by the sound of water filling the bathtub. A small pile of discarded letters float softly in the room, before finally resting on a stool by the tub.
I met you later that night, too. You didn’t touch my body, just the wall behind me. When I hugged your neck and pulled you closer, closer and
The match played out in the shadows for Harry. A circle passed Oliver, and Harry furrowed his brow trying to follow the Chasers. Their Chasers weren’t any better, falling out of sync and sticking too close together to score well. Both Milo and Luc played like it was a Hogwarts match, amateurish and clumsy. Harry couldn’t spot the Snitch anywhere when he wasn’t being distracted.
Harry’s rigid for a second, and then his hands are everywhere on Draco’s body. He whispers, “You’re my star, you know that?”
It was wishful thinking, Draco realises, to have believed the papers would let this slide. They already had so much to publish about Harry Potter, they didn’t really need to finish carving Draco’s grave with news about the divorce.
"Hi," Draco said.
doing?” Draco amends, before she insists on the topic of Harry making out with other people. “Tell me something good.”
“Why would I,” Harry’s words come easier now, albeit more like a snarl. “Talk to you?”
He feels his cheeks blush as the prospect that Harry,
They both scrambled out the door seconds later, expressions sheepish and fully clothed.
This is Draco’s second year of spending his Saturday mornings in the Community Centre, in meetings all too intense. Despite his frequent attempts at avoiding the attention on him, he always leaves these sessions with a lighter heart.
Though it’s not the weekend yet, Marvin is there when Draco faces the familiar yellow walls again. The facade has been repainted, he notices distantly; it looks even brighter than ten years ago. Some windows have been changed for more modern frames. But the inside of the building looks exactly the same as it had the last time he came, albeit cleaner.
Gulping, Draco inhales deeply. Tears threaten to fall down his cheeks. “I’m sorry I lied,” he whines helplessly, holding his shaky hands by his chest to prevent him from reaching out and touching Harry. And never letting go. “I’ll make it up to you, please.”
At the end of that day’s session, Draco paused before the front door.
—is to hold him tight again, finally, and it
Harry felt silly with Draco ghosting his fingers over the tattoos. A tiny falcon holding a Snitch over Harry's ribs fluttered its wings as Draco brushed past. Then Draco's hands were on the band of ivy leaves around his left bicep, which bloomed with delight. Finally, his hands trailed over a spray of stars on Harry's right shoulder blade and lingered.
Draco approaches them in a few steps, ignoring the smug grin Elle gives him. “What? No. Never, Harry. It’s my favourite song. I like that you like it.”
“No,” Draco hears himself saying again. At the same time an ‘
There’s nothing old about it, except maybe for some yellowish aging piece of papers here and there.
Of course, this new system is something he’s been practicing for only a day, and Draco can’t quite bring himself to stop Elle when she carries on.
“Nothing,” she replies, but it doesn’t appease him. Pansy sighs. “Nothing. Just, what would he come here so much for? He told me he hates St Mungo’s.”
A shiver shoots down his spine as he makes his staggering way through a path of threatening roots and dark canopy closing in around him. Draco doesn’t let it deter him, he won’t let this old magic tell him whether he’s supposed to be here. He’s not about to let a Forest prevent him from finding Harry.
Draco grins softly. “How are you feeling?”
’ finds him as Hermione’s arms envelope his body in a tight, comforting embrace. He’s distantly surprised she doesn’t have her face shoved in Pansy’s neck at this moment, but he supposes it’s undignified, and he’s probably the one to take this news in the worst way.
Harry wished that he could give Atty Blake something to hold on to in training other than telling her not to read the rubbish in the papers. She was quieter than she had been before. Harry had only gotten some glimpse of the headlines.
Harry doesn’t flinch, though, and he counts that as a victory.
Draco purses his lips, containing a shy grin. The words tumble out of his lips so fast he can barely control them, and he whispers, “I miss you.”
Harry hadn’t expected Draco’s presence would be everywhere in the details of the house. Sirius’ leather jacket was clean and oiled in the coat closet along with a travelling cloak of his grandfather’s. The larger vases that Henri had made were in each guest room. Draco had carefully selected what few Black family heirlooms remained. All the door handles matched the celestial clock they had found, beautiful brass fitting in with the rest of the decor. The house was well-behaved, opening and closing doors before and after them.
"And the house is still not mine after you’ve done this?" Harry asked.
"Right, well. I’ll need a few more things. Any coins on you?" Draco rummaged in the pockets of his own trousers, holding up a two pound coin. Harry produced a Galleon and a Sickle. Draco spun his wand and then tapped each item until it was the correct size.
Of course, it has to be Luna. She’s doing the same as she did to Draco when he was at his worst—even though he can’t really acknowledge this as Harry Potter’s worst. What, did he just come out of a magazine? She must be trying to help.
"It’s a Muggle sport where you jump off bridges with a rope," Oliver said, not all helpfully.
"Thank you," Daphne slurred her words, but Blaise seemed to be perfectly at purpose with a task.
“Hm, you know, you’re very sexy when you talk like that?”
Draco’s eyes widen a bit. Harry has never offered before, and Draco has never asked, content in imagining the space in secret. Harry is always with him, anyway, the rest shouldn’t matter.
. He tries not to curse himself for having supplied her with them.
"It's apparently a common Metamorphmagus trait. Centre of gravity isn't stable, all that."
“He’s nice, you know, for someone famous and all.” Her words are disinterested. She shrugs. The movement probably causes pain, and she winces almost immediately. Elle continues, as if the pain is nothing and it hurts him to see her actually getting used to living with it. “He’s not worthy of you, though. You’re better off without him.”
She nodded, even as her face crumpled again. "I know it’s just the game." Harry would get himself thrown out of every game if that was going to be the game, but he thought it wouldn’t help her to hear it.
He knows his friends have been trying to spare him of whatever makes her grin like that. Whatever it’s for, not to rub their happiness in his face or to grieve with him. The last few years, Draco recounts, have consisted of days sadder than the previous. Just how many things has Draco missed by only worrying about himself?
Despite being constantly surrounded by his own and Draco’s friends, Harry explodes months later.
"I didn’t want one. I think they ruin the brick facade, and the building shouldn’t allow them," said Draco.
It didn’t matter that Harry didn't remember them, Teddy realised. It was Draco's hidden grin that made Harry’s eyes spark with life. It was Teddy’s laughter, and the sound of the screaming kettle in their tiny house, and the breeze in the afternoons, and the crack of the flames on their old hearth that made Harry stay.
“On?” Harry presses.
"Well Teddy, I think it’s almost time for us to go," Andromeda warned as players started packing their bags and heading to the stadium Floo, down the long hallways.
“I’ll get the next round,” he offers, getting up with their glasses before Blaise can argue.
Harry chortles behind his hand and the glance he directs at Draco almost makes him melt. “My Hagrid?”
"He said I should ‘piss off and be smugly married elsewhere’," Stella said.
No, I wasn’t okay.
And that was okay.
Draco’s thankful that Healer Cameron gave him one more week to come back, because the day after sneaking into St Mungo’s, his divorce is in the papers and Draco’s once more caving in on himself.
"Let's run!" Rose insisted.
to him. “Do you come to St Mungo’s often?”
"And yet…" Draco drawled.
“You want a dog?” he asks, bewildered.
Draco was still cold, and a bit reserved; there was no expectation there would be a return of the old ease that had been there, but it was a start.
"It does not. There’s very little left to do now and certainly not enough to justify being here every single weekday. I have other houses to move on to," Draco said. "I told you, the Ministry wants me to start looking at the abandoned houses up north."
Harry is in front of Draco, and slipping through his fingers like the white sand of that lifeless beach.
“Ruby misses you.” Harry’s words graze Draco’s skin as his lips leave a warm trail on Draco’s neck.
"How’ve you been, Jaggy?" Harry asked, cutting off Luc before he could build up a head of steam.
The silence becomes oppressive when all he can hear is his own ragged breathing. Draco doesn’t stop trying until a heavy hand falls on his trembling shoulder and Healer Cameron’s voice echoes in the room. “She’s gone, Draco.”
He can’t do this alone
He pushes on, though, because he knows that if he starts doubting his decision now, he’ll never get out of this cycle.
Draco grabs Harry’s wrists, pulling him closer and pushing their chests together. He’s grasping at anything he can, unable to let Harry go. Or to go himself.
“Are you keeping tabs on me?” he asks defensively, shoulders hunched.
"You don't sleep in the master bedroom," Draco said. It was a statement, not a question. Harry shrugged. It was clean, there were deep gouges in the hardwood from Buckbeak, and on occasion it had been occupied when the house was full of Order members, but Molly seemed to sense that stirring up memories of Sirius' parents was not a good idea. Harry felt uneasy about it.
, he says while they walk across the blank beach. He tells Draco nothing really felt right until he found this place.
Draco spends half of the night watching Harry as he slowly falls asleep. Harry shifts in the bed, unable to keep his eyes open, head slightly leaning to the side. His breathing quiets down enough to almost disappear into the darkness. Draco lays a hand on Harry’s chest and listens to the low rhythm of his heartbeat until sleep claims him too.
This is nothing like Draco imagined, but he tests the bed anyway. At least the mattress is as comfortable as his mind supplied.
When Harry agrees with her, Draco finds he can’t really say no.
“Is that what people see me as? A lost cause?” He asked, defeated.
The announcer was even louder. "Merlin, Potter has the Snitch with some of the most dangerous flying I’ve ever seen in my years announcing, folks. What a match! The League has ruled that Potter’s last move was regulation, even in replays. The final score is 270 - 100 to the Falcons. This semi-final is over. Pride is out for the season! With the Harpies defeating Appleby earlier today, the final will be the Harpies and Falcons!"
Draco Malfoy was the opposite of what Harry expected.
“You don’t want this?” Harry interrupts, gesturing a finger between their chests. His breathing is turning laboured. Harry shakes his head.
house.
The next morning, he was greeted with a heaving kitchen table after his workout. Buttered multigrain toast, more fruit than even Harry ever ate in a week, spinach omelettes, a whole rasher of bacon, and a pile of still-warm pastries. Harry put his face in his hands. His left ankle was throbbing unhappily, and he missed his cottage where nothing ever changed without his permission.
"It’s a greenhouse. I thought it was a bit warm for this time of year," Neville said. "Most of the flowers are lilac, honeysuckle, and jasmine. Could use a trim, but they look good."
“Peace,” a deep voice rumbles softly from his left. Harry lifts a hand to fist at his tired eyes and yawns deeply. He leans forward on his elbows, which rest atop the stall gate, to peer over at Draco’s sketchpad.
"That doesn’t mean it’s fair. Will you be all right?" She sniffled hard, but shook out her shoulders and nodded.
. His magic fills every corner so perfectly, it’s almost as if he’s never left, and the low hum of magic and presence suffusing around him is enough to leave Draco breathless and at a loss for words.
It was nice seeing Draco, Harry had said, and it keeps ringing in Draco’s head all the way to his home. He can’t stop smiling.
Christmas went as it should. Harry stepped out for his annual big shop for the kids in residence at SafeHome off the list Jim gave him. He could send someone else, but there was something about standing in a queue for a stuffed Erumpent and going to his cottage to pick up all the brooms he hadn’t bothered opening that put him in a good mood. He liked buying a laptop for Kwame who wanted to study graphic design and a new set of colouring pencils and a camera for River. He bought gaming systems, shiny cauldrons, miniature indoor fireworks, and rare tropical plants. Harry completed the list over a few days, his heart full.
"Draco?" Harry said.
“Hermione, you know Draco,” Weasley repeats unhelpfully.
He didn’t really think that.
Pansy’s fingers delicately take the paper from him and he lets her. A second later, the heavy intake of breath from the girl and Blaise’s muffled “Whoa” resound in the room. Draco, though, is left staring at his own fingers and the void that message left there.
"It’s all very tricky magic, isn't it?" Harry asked. "When I talked to Bill, he said he’d rather steal from Gringotts than fiddle with people’s houses."
"You said all or nothing," Harry said. "So I’m going to kiss you now."
Then, in a much smaller voice, Draco said, "They didn't care who I was, as long as I did what they said. I couldn't live like that."
“How… What…?” Draco’s fractured words stumble out of him, as he sits down beside Harry.
If I felt the need to travel back then as much as I do now...”
Barb waved her hand, so Harry sat on one of her sleek white leather couches, feeling better already. He hadn’t trusted this petite, soft-spoken woman with a cheap haircut when he was a rookie interviewing potential agents. Oliver shrugged and said, "Go with who you like. It’s all the same except for fee percentages." But she was the only one who had the foresight to meet him in Muggle London, avoiding the circus of his early public appearances post-War.
The green eyes turn to the rain, the droplets rapidly growing thicker and stronger. “Shall we run?”
Harry
Harry had never minded away games before. He got melancholy at long stretches like everyone else, and he missed their pitch, but generally he was fine. But things had changed since the house was in the process of being fixed. Harry missed his new, ridiculously expensive sheets and his new tub that fit him easily. He missed the gentle brightening of rooms in the morning and the dimming of them in the evening. He missed the idea that no one could try to entice him into billiard games by banging on his hotel door at ten in the evening, although everyone had quickly got the message and avoided him.
"Here is your story. Some of your grandfather’s things went to your parents’ house in Godric’s Hollow. The rest went to the Lupin home. Then, on November 15, 1981, someone broke into the Lupin home and stole what was left in there. With no master left in residence, the house couldn’t defend itself."
“What is this?” he forces out.
"But they don’t have Portkeys, Teddy," Harry responded. Teddy thought about it for a bit.
"You want to hear why it didn’t work out between me and your friend?" Harry asked. Draco nodded.
"You said there were some pieces my mum…that she was…" Harry said with a tiny hope. Draco went through the folio again and stopped at a different place.
Harry’s temper sparked. Draco knew nothing about Sirius, or what his parents had been like. Harry had never asked to inherit this ruin.
"We are back in business. Pray. Burn incense. Thank your ancestors. We have to replicate this success. Don’t do anything new if you can help it," Coach said.
"Because you don’t need it," Harry said. He was familiar with the feeling, and Draco appeared to be doing all right for himself. Harry wondered if Draco ever had to sell something he loved. His home was beautiful, certainly, but it also felt like Draco loved it. Loved it like it was his, because Draco took care of things he loved.
article came out. Then Coach summoned Harry to his office, where he was pacing.
"Did you break the curse?"
Harry slipped up and caught the Snitch too neatly in his left hand.
“I don’t see it.” Harry shrugs again. “Not anymore. Haven’t since I first got here. I’m kinda stuck.” His laugh is dry and lifeless.
"Thank God you're back. Oliver's fighting with his boyfriend, and he's been a fucking terror," Stella said. Harry was hungover and not in the mood. He hadn’t been hungover in over a year, and he wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that he overindulged to keep Draco with him for the space of a glass of wine longer. Hangover potion purged the nausea but not the exhaustion.
When Luna found me an hour later, seeming more distressed than I had ever seen her, I almost didn’t want to leave. But I knew I would, anyway. I didn't ask what had made her so anxious that night and she didn't offer.
Draco pulls back, his face creased in an ugly grimace. He can’t have heard it right. “What? How can you say that? You’re my life, Harry.”
"He is. But Percy considers you family, Harry. You don't have to go through me."
With slight apprehension, though, Draco lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s stunned expression. He was not the only one that felt it. Harry is staring at him with wide eyes, mouth hanging open. He licks his lips, and all Draco can do not to jump on him is to interlace his fingers on top of his knees.
exhausted, which is no surprise considering how late it is. His schedule at St Mungo’s gets worse by the day, something expected for a person training to be a healer and on the path to deciding which specialty to undertake. If he hadn’t moved in with Harry and quit his job at Camden (though he had been coerced into it), Draco isn’t sure he would’ve managed the hours and providing for himself. That Harry worries about his coffee and eating habits is certainly a bonus.
Draco has the niggling sensation he can relate to her exhaustion, feeling stretched thin and worn out himself. Not that he can compare his situation to hers. Draco can still get out of his bed in the mornings, he can walk, he can use his magic without fearing it will backfire. But Draco knows how it is to feel bone-deep fatigue, to not have any strength left to live.
“Oi, Harry,” Weasley is yelling, and Draco’s searing beef sizzles loudly at the same time, calling him back to the task in hand. Draco’s glad for the distraction, and for the excuse that might explain why he flinches when he hears the ginger's voice. “There’s a Malfoy in your kitchen!”
Draco pulls him closer in lieu of a reply, their bodies mingling under the covers, and Harry hums happily. His magic is always warm and comfortable, and Draco is not sure anymore how he’s supposed to feel without it.
Draco’s heart does a loop in his chest, and the words tumble out of his mouth before he gets a hold of them. “Want to go to my place? It’s close.”
He was thinking he could even sell the house to someone.
I did. That was how we got to this moment.
Blaise shrugs, and the rest of the room chuckles lightly. No one has really forgotten Harry’s words, but it’s a silent agreement not to engage in the heavy topic for now.
"Thanks again, Millie. See you around!"
"Strike." Coach, the team, and a few stragglers shouting back. She smiled.
“Maybe.”
Harry usually studies him, gaze unwavering, before deciding whether Draco’s answers make sense or if he wants to know more.
You did like that song an awful lot.
Harry frowned. "As far as I’m concerned, we’re even because of your mother."
“We both know he won’t,” he says instead of what he actually thinks. Harry won’t get his memories back. And then what?
"Harry, come on. We have to deal with this."
“Such as?”
He doesn’t press Harry to say the rest, and stays patiently silent as he takes a deep breath. That Harry is here, acknowledging their bond, their relationship, is enough to render Draco speechless.
Hermione had tried to put up some resistance, untrusting of Draco. But the gravity of his expression had been enough to stop her when he left.
Draco voraciously feeds on the bits of information Pansy and Hermione can give him.
Their bodies moved and touched as if held by the strings of a puppeteer. A shiver ran down my spine.
Oliver was Harry's only teammate who would have dared say anything. Harry centred himself. They were projected to win all three matches since they were playing lower-ranked teams back to back through some miracle of scheduling. The Tornadoes went first, losing to them 120 - 200. Wimbourne almost managed to pull off a victory, but Harry caught the Snitch quite literally from under their Seeker’s nose.
This is Harry.
"Do you think you’re funny?" Pansy pursed her lips, nostrils flaring. Harry wisely declined to respond. He had remembered. Very late.
Harry reached out and read it himself. It was a nice enough letter for an estranged parent.
"The house is calming down," said Harry, noncommittal.
“Yes. We planted this tree when we moved in. I can show it to you later, or on a sunnier day.” It’s an open invitation. Both men know it, and Harry doesn’t agree, nor reject it.
Hermione comes by after the fourth week, looking more guilty about feeling hopeful than of having abandoned Draco to his misery. Not that he can blame her, but he misses the company of the friend he found in the brilliant woman. It’s depressing how much has changed because Harry hates him now.
“I know who you are outside here.”
"You never used to bring people you were dating to Falcons stuff," Stella said sometime later in the evening. "Then you show up with him."
He wishes he could apparate to his destination, but he’s too afraid of that, of being pulled by the darkness, or the void, of being sucked into this place and disappearing forever like so many other things have. Instead, Draco keeps walking around the house at a slow and strenuous pace.
“Hello, Harry. Weasley, Granger.” Your voice echoed, cold and courteous, fingers pointing at their coffees. “Would you like a refill?”
"Fine. Let me firecall Gwen," Harry said.
Their first big fight happened about a month after Harry moved in with Draco. It had been months and Draco still wasn’t able to sleep an entire night without waking Harry up to make sure he was there. That Harry was alive, even though the bond was always latently pulsing inside him. Harry had become very attuned to Draco, and when it happened, Harry held him close in the middle of the night and whispered “I’m here,” as many times as Draco needed to hear it. It seemed only natural that the next step of their relationship was living together.
"If you wanted to destroy a magic object like this, what would you do?"
Harry doesn’t sit by his side. His eyes are wet, face flushed, fingers twitching between Draco’s. “You already have, love.”
"I'm aware, thanks," Harry replied. His throat was still a bit tender from crying.
“We can’t be together anymore,” Harry blurts. His words are expelled so quickly, it feels like he’s just breathing them out.
"This is…I'm going to die," Harry gasped out. It was overwhelming to have Draco inside him. He didn’t know it would be like this. All-consuming, languid heat sparked deep inside his body. Draco stopped and held Harry open with a thumb, ran a finger along where they were joined. He was looking, Harry realised with a shiver of pleasure. The sound Harry made was low, involuntary.
Harry’s memories can come back tomorrow, or he can spend the rest of his days without knowing what happened during the twelve years after he died in the battle.
Draco is tempted to stop and read it. What if Pansy and Hermione forgot to tell him something? It’s fruitless, though. He has the best sources on the subject, and he’s probably just looking for a reason to bail.
Hermione cackled. "See, I was correct. I can see you're having a normal one right now."
Luna didn’t ask me if I was sure this time, she knew I was when I invited her to try again.
“No, Draco, he is
“Why?” Draco shouts, remembering Hermione’s words from years ago.
Talking about Quidditch or books or the most recent society scandal does not appeal to him anymore. Blaise’s newest conquest seems like a distant and irrelevant topic now. Still, Draco smiles and follows the conversation the best he can, pretending, for his own sake, that this is important, because this is a welcomed distraction. Because he needs this. He needs not to be alone anymore, even if all Draco wants is to cover himself in blankets and never wake up again.
"Don't move," Draco said.
The strokes are wild and heavy, but each of the blurred lines carries a simplicity Draco’s beginning to recognise as something that’s just Potter.
“Draco,” Harry starts, lifting his head, eyes heavy. “I’m not coming back with you.” Harry points at his own chest, where a black mark stains the place where his heart should be. “I told you I was gone.”
