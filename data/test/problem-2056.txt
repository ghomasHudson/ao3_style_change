For a moment, Draco shuttered at the idea that he’d gotten the times wrong, and that it was only a matter of seconds before waves of students came crashing into the common room, but Harry eased his thoughts quickly with the spluttered mess that left his mouth as he rushed into the dorm.
Dinnertime was when chances got a bit higher, seeing as Draco was most definitely starving by the time the Great Hall offered the students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry more food. He was rarely at lunch, and he ate breakfast so early, that by the time dinner rolled around, the blond had gone nearly 12 hours without eating.
“Come in, come in. Make yourself at home,” The man made way for Draco to fit through the door. The inside of the classroom was rather
"Ginny wasn't even upset with me, we didn't talk about me or Harry or even Hogwarts!" Narcissa nodded her head, slowly and calmly, making Draco yawn as he continued telling about his day. "We just talked about stuff we liked, like normal people do. Neville talked about plants,  Luna talked about going on a holiday trip to find exotic creatures, and Ginny talked about the Holyhead Harpies.
. He knew that didn’t make sense, he knew he’d basically just contradicted himself, but it was the only way he could describe his feelings. It was fair, but it wasn’t.
Despite having gone to sleep at a seemingly decent hour, he still had to force himself to leave his cozy bed and make his way down to the Great Hall before it became clustered with children. They wouldn’t be as tired as they were the night before, no. In fact, they’d be ten times more observant.
"That father and his friends trapped in our basement? Yes, the very one." Draco said in a monotone voice. Narcissa's eyes widened in horror before shaking her head.
“Are you doing alright?” Harry asked, and Draco sighed exhaustedly, feeling as though he’d heard that phrase thousands upon thousands of times that day. Of course, he probably had, seeing as he’d only broken down the day before. And of course, most of the people he’d been asked by were Hermione and Harry, who had problems with accepting answers it seemed, and had asked quite a bit.
"I want inner house unity and I want everyone to try. Now on a less serious not I have some notices," McGonagall continued.
"I just wanted to say I don't blame you for what  happened in the war. It wasn't your fault." Why was Potter starting this conversation and why didn't he hate Draco?
The last thing on Draco's mind, as he fell asleep was: what is Potter planning and why is he being so weird?
"Early as always guys," Draco smiled at them. It was a relief to have at least two people who didn't hate you at school.
"But because you are also the oldest you will be setting an example of house unity." This lessened the smiles.
"On this piece of paper are your sleeping arrangements. All your things are already there and no, no one will be swapping rooms." She set the piece of paper down and looked at the small group of 8th years rush towards it.
"As you are now the oldest students in the castle and you are legally adults you don't have a curfew. If you go to classes tired, that's on you. You will also be able to visit Hogsmade freely and whenever you want." She looked around to see smiling faces.
Stupid McGonagall. Stupid Gryffindor's. Should've gone to Durmstrang like father said  Draco thought angrily. Pansy and Blaise were both looking at him to see if he would react but Draco knew better. He had too much to lose if he acted irrationally so he just sat down at the 8th year table quietly. The other 8th years didn't seem to care that much and most of them didn't even want to look at the Slytherin trio. Potter and his little group sat at the other end of the table. Draco observed them while Blaise and Pansy talked, he noticed that, like him, Potter was not joining the conversations. Instead, he was staring at the empty plate in front of him. Weird, Draco thought. Did perfect Potter fall out with his friends?
"So yeah, in short, I could kick your pure-blood arse, Malfoy." Ginevra Weasley stood in the doorway of the small home, broomstick over shoulder, leaning against the wall with a pleased smirk on her face.
, was given his book back, and he pocketed it away before giving his attention back to the professor. “When I was a boy, I despised them so much, but as I grew, they got more and more beautiful. I think you’ll enjoy the others.” Draco nodded, feeling quite a bit more happy than when he first walked in.
His hands shook as he read the prompts off the cards, his voice was a quivering mess, and best of all: his mother was not in the house.
"So... Me, You, Ron, Neville... Luna, maybe. And?" Hermione began after a while. Harry was truly grateful that she was even considering his thoughts; all throughout their school years, the two had always found his ideas somewhat skeptical. Maybe they were finally beginning to realize he had some brains after all.
"A few minutes. I came the second he started mumbling. They aren't incantations." She said. She seemed confused.
"You had a theory?" Ron said, thoroughly unimpressed. Harry didn't think he would be. After all, this was Draco Malfoy.
His face relaxed and he thanked her for the food. She nodded her reply and moved away, going back to talk with her husband.
“As always, the third floor is off limits to anyone who doesn’t wish to die a most painful death, and students are to be in their common rooms after curfew. I bid you all, goodnight.”
His mother lay shivering in her bed, and Draco was by her bedside. A large storybook lay in his lap, and it looked even bigger than it was on his tiny body. He remembered grinning up at her every so often as he struggled his way through the fairytales, and he recalled the pained look on her face being replaced with a faint smile every time he did so.
If Teddy so much as heard another voice while he was trying to sleep, he'd try to morph himself to what he heard. And as Harry heard her say so many times within the past year, Mommy was not having it.
He couldn’t bother to actually work on the tasks he’d been assigned by his professors, but he felt obligated to at least have them with him, as if their presence would encourage him to finish them up. Of course, that mindset didn’t actually work, but the sentiment was nice.
Lucius Malfoy raised a hand to strike his son. His idiotic, blood traitor son. The boy who houses Harry Potter and his bloody godson. The son who had every opportunity to kill Potter, to kill Dumbledore, to kill McGonagall. To help the dark lord.
I-” He stopped suddenly when Draco turned rather abruptly back to look at him but pursued, trying to come off as a calm type that Draco knew he most definitely was not. “I think- I think she was just a bit worried. And-”
Once completely clean, the two hugged each other and began making small talk. Luna squeezed Draco's thigh before excusing herself and sitting understandably close to her girlfriend.
he liked it, seeing as it was messy and completely idiotic. The boy never brushed it through, at least it didn’t seem like it. And it had no order whatsoever, it was just
“It seems I might never stop,” The Baron replied. “Your presence is requested in ten minutes in the Great Hall. The Headmistress suggested five however, because students will clamored together.”
"And Sirius risked everything for me, he saw me as another James, as my dad. That's why, I think." Hermione nodded.
"Parkinson?" Pansy retorted. "I'm more than a mere acquaintance to you Draco, I would assume. Or shall I call you Mr. Malfoy?"
Harry smiled with her as he too thought of his godson. And honestly, how amazing is it to have a godson in his life, yet not have to constantly care for him. Harry was able to live his life freely.
“Okay.” And it was clear that Draco wanted to say something else, something different; but something stopped him. Was it Harry? Or something else? He supposed it didn’t matter, even though it did.
“We heard what happened. We heard about everything.” What was everything? Who was we? He wished he understood, but at the same time, he was glad he didn't. Whatever she knew, it was about him. Something had happened concerning him and he couldn’t be bothered with it. He wasn’t prepared mentally to take in any extra besides school related topics.
In hopes that he'd take back the invitation so that Draco wouldn't have to contemplate all of his wrongdoings in order to answer him.
Neville was quick to take out his planner, and checking the date, he confirmed to the small group that it was in fact, most definitely, November 3rd. The confirmation gave birth to a collective realization and understanding of Harry’s sudden mood change, and for Draco, a blatantly obvious sign of proof that Harry’s anger was in no way his fault.
Stupid, arrogant boy! His eyes began to water as his back hit a wall. Teddy's seat floated towards him and he was grateful. Grateful that he wouldn't have to reach out for him, grateful that his father couldn't hurt him.
"The catch, is that I personally picked the sleeping arrangements." That statement was met with groans.
Draco stepped out at platform 9 and 3/4. He was greeted by the loud noises of owls and little kids running around the station. Most people were there with their families but Draco didn't have that luxury. He stood away from the crowd and as soon as he could, he went inside to get himself a compartment; none of his friends, except Pansy and Blaise, were going to come back to Hogwarts because they all fully supported the dark lord unlike Draco. He hissed at younger years and gave them death glares so that by the time the train started to move he was still alone and had the compartment to himself. A couple minutes later, Pansy and Blaise arrived laughing.
After Potter had left, Blaise turned to Draco and asked, "What was that about? Since when does Potter care?" Draco didn't really know how to reply so instead he stared at Potter. What was up with him. First the weird look now pretending to care about Draco's preferences. What a weirdo. Once again, Draco noted, Potter wasn't joining in the conversation the weasel and Granger were having. He was just looking at the wall. What was up with him? Not that Draco cared of course. He was caught staring and it took him a few seconds to understand what Pansy had said.
Draco was silent for a moment, but eventually he nodded and reached over, taking a piece of pumpkin pasties. He bit into it, and smiled. He supposed it was alright.
"So Draco, how have you been lately?" It was Ginny who asked this, and surprisingly, she looked genuinely concerned. As he tried to answer, Neville motioned for him to join the trio, and he did so reluctantly, answering the question along the way.
hungry?” Harry asked eventually, sitting on one of the beds. Draco tentatively sat down on one closer to Harry rather than his own. “You haven’t eaten since yesterday morning.”
"I think he will come," Luna said after a spell of silence. "I don't think he's asking for advice," She nodded her head slightly to Draco. "I think it might be to confess something."
They hadn’t put on the proper attire for the cold weather, but they had on black robes, and Harry thought it was fine just as it was.
"Come into my house with that filth all over you, see what happens!" Ginny said. Neville, a smile still stuck on his face, backed away and swished his wand, cleaning himself up.
"Oh," was his response. "Well, I'm glad you did. We'll have fun!" He did his best to reassure him but he felt his point wasn't getting across. The boy still looked timid and reserved as he ate his food.
to. He’d been taunted with his parents' images since he was eleven, hell, maybe even since he was thrust into the parental guardianship of his aunt and uncle.
confused him. It was not, death was painful. His mother, father, godfather, friends. All dead, all painful to think about.
"I'll, I'll call, someone. St. Mungo's perhaps." She said distressed. She apparated god knows where and Harry turned his attention back to Draco.
He half expected Potter to push him away. Hex him or curse him out until he was far too upset to even attempt to comfort the wizard, but that was far from the truth. Instead, Harry had tapped the spot next to him and moved over a bit, as if welcoming Draco into the makeshift fort of shadows.
Draco shook his head. His father had never been the type of person to take Draco trick-or-treating, even if the other October problems hadn’t been in place. No, his mother always would give him a few treats, perhaps a handful of candy, and allow him to read a few scary stories before bed. It had never bothered him when he was younger, because most of his friends were the same way. Pansy never went trick-or-treating because her parents weren’t fond of taking treats from probable half-bloods, or even worse, Muggleborns. As was the same for Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Blaise Zabini always had lavish parties, but his parents usually handed him over to a babysitter, so he didn’t get to be in them until he was a bit older.
"You don't mind, do you?" Draco shook his head before sitting as well. Of course, he sat in his lounging area. What reason did he have to sit next to Potter anyway?
He thought, though he realized just as soon that it was a silly idea. Draco was rather skilled at occlumency, and Harry was rather
Harry sat on his bed, an old computer in hand. Hermione had gotten it from her parents, who were muggles. He being basically muggle born himself, knew how to work it exceptionally well despite never actually having any electronics in his youth.
"I'm planning on, or asking permission to... move out?" Harry, nervous than Hermione during an exam, stared intently at his cuppa, not bothering to look at Narcissa.
eat, it wouldn’t harm anything. What did it matter if his body got back into the swing of things, he’d have to do it the next day anyway.
Harry nodded and dismissed the boy with a wave of his hand, "Tell me if it comes to you." But the two of them knew he didn't mean it.
“Why do you need the library if you’re only working on spells?” Draco asked disbelievingly, though in truth, he was quite happy to have an excuse to break away from his time-consuming essay.
Those were ones Draco enjoyed more, and Harry was delighted when he realized that Draco was just as nerdy and easy to impress with silly factoids as Hermione Granger was.
Draco thought, and his mind began racing a thousand miles per minute. What could possibly be making Harry Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World himself, cry?
"Why would you invite me?" Draco retorted, although the effort wasn't anything like it used to be back at school. It was quiet, and somewhat kind.
"Well it," Draco began, with a small amount of happiness in his voice. Subtle yes, but it was there. (Although it went completely unbeknownst to Harry.) "Well, I was just-" and he sighed, realizing that Harry wanted nothing to do with him, and if Potter wanted nothing to do with him, why would any of the boys friends?
“I know it’s Sirius Black’s birthday,” he stated, and he allowed himself a quick glance in Harry’s direction. He didn’t know how to react when Potter sucked in a deep breath, so he continued, hoping that whatever came from his mouth next wouldn’t force Harry Potter away. Not that he would care, but maybe he would. Losing potential friends seemed worse than losing people you were already close with. Draco compared it to grabbing for something that was barely out of reach; longing for something you just couldn’t get. Perhaps it was precisely what he deserved, but he tried not to think about that.
Draco searched his brain for an answer as to why the taller male standing just a few inches from him had
“But-” Harry had said, trying to start a conversation. “Classics are boring.” Draco, still struggling to wake himself up properly, looked offended.
He was standing awkwardly to the side, quite a length away from the staircases, but he began to make his way over.
It was quiet for a few minutes but to Draco, each passing minute became more and more awkward. It was so quiet, he felt that if he moved it would be louder than Moaning Myrtle.
"Sit." Hermione said, the same scary whisper still flowing form her lips. As angry as she seemed, she still brought him some tea and pumpkin juice, a plate and some silverware and allowed Harry to dig into the food in front if him and Ron.
"The poor boy!" Ron spoke up for the first time that morning, not including his greeting to Harry when he knocked on the front door. "The poor boy? Sounds like you have a liking for Malfoy, Hermione."
"Are you in a better mood today?" Narcissa asked, rubbing his thigh. Draco nodded and allowed a small smile to spread across his face.
“I want to visit my parents’ graves.” It was sudden, and his voice was sharp, and he meant every word. He didn’t
have warm hands, though he didn’t know why. Nevertheless, he allowed a small smile to come across his face when the touch remained. “What happened was quite intense, and it’s fine if you need time to recover.”
As he looked around, he saw that there was an extra table now, probably for the eighth year students. He sighed as he realized he probably wasn't supposed to sit at the Slytherin table anymore, that his house was irrelevant this year. The Headmistress had explained that although the eighth years were a part of their own house, they wouldn’t be participating in house games like usual. That was for the main houses, they were only there to complete their education. Although they would be allowed to play quidditch for their original house, as well as celebrate with them.
He cleared his throat and hurried to startup a conversation before anyone started talking to either of them. "So. What made you decide to come Draco?"
But each and every time Harry whispered the words “I love you,” into Draco’s ear during a cheesy but sweet movie as they cuddled one another, or yelled it through the house when he saw that his favorite jumper was washed and hung in his wardrobe, the words were never said back.
, both. He wondered if Harry Potter would join in and lead the slaughter or watch from the sidelines, quietly cheering them on.
noticed a few people gathered around the Giant Squid’s lake, he hadn’t realized they were making memorials; he certainly hadn’t had the guts to go and ask the Headmistress, who’d been the only teacher he’d talked to in his days at the castle. He hadn’t thought to ask the Bloody Baron either, because he was a ghost, and prior to that morning, he hadn’t realized ghosts could leave the inside of the castle.
“Oh wow, that’s so cool!” Draco gave a tight smile. “Anyway, your table is there!” She pointed to the middle table and Draco nodded quickly.
"She has a prankster for a brother, a dragon-handler for another, and this list goes on. And on! One peep out of her red-haired piper and I'm dead." Draco said, sitting down once again at Luna's disapproving tone.
“Yes, Professor.” God, he was being terribly awkward, but he didn’t know what he could do about it. He gave his hands another shake before looking the Headmistress in her eyes, trying to show
enjoyed the books, and he didn’t think they were boring. He thought they were exciting and exhilarating, and he thought each chapter brought a new adventure. “I doubt you’ve ever had the brain capacity to read such things.”
"You don't understand the things I did to him." he said, melancholy like, "not that your daft! You aren't, you are brilliant, Mother!"
"Draco? Something I said?" He shook his head and placed the biscuits and tea on the table before sitting down himself. "Draco, considering going, and actually going, are two entirely different things. You wouldn't be... You wouldn't really even be a Slytherin if you do this. You're already living with Harry Potter. Is that not enough?"
“Apparently, I watched her die. “ Harry paused, letting that fact sink in. He had watched his mum die, and he hadn’t been able to do anything about it. Granted, he was a baby, but the idea that his mother was dying right in front of him hurt more than he had anticipated.
He wanted to wake up every morning to messy blond hair and splotchy freckles and loud yawns that seemed to fill the whole house. He wanted to go to the local shop at 2 am and buy as many gummy bears as he could, just because he enjoyed the way Draco’s eyes brightened when he saw them. He didn’t mind staying in bed for hour long cuddles, just because; and he didn’t mind watching children’s television because he knew they made Draco happy.
"Well... you might be hungry. I don't have my wand. You could magic yourself up something?" Harry offered, glancing hopefully st Draco from the corner of his eye.
Harry swallowed the bite of food in his mouth and cleared his throat; his cheeks blushing a small bit, although he certainly didn't authorize them to do so. "I suppose not, Mrs. Weasley. He hadn't really mentioned it, and I didn't see him this morning."
Draco's mind wondered back to third year, year of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin. The only living relative that the boy in front of him had left, the man that might as well have been killed by Draco's own father.
The ground was covered in snow, and Harry found himself slowly growing a hatred for the freezing air. Of course, the snow had nothing to do with the death of his parents, but there was no one left to blame, so he figured he could go on blaming other things until he felt it was good enough. He knew it wasn’t healthy, but no one could really tell him anything anymore. He had saved the entirety of the Wizarding World, and as a gift, they’d given him the feeling of loneliness.
Three hours before the train was set to arrive, Draco was back in the Eighth year dorm rooms, standing a few feet away from his four-poster bed, hands on his hips. He was trying his best to think of a spell that might conceal his entire existence a bit better, but the stress of the upcoming events were overtaking him. His breath was heavy and labored, as it had been since his meeting with the Headmistress had concluded. He knew he had every opportunity to go and ask a professor for spell help, but his mind told him no.
On the upside, his dorm room was closer to the exit, he’d be able to make a quick and easy getaway if need be. That in itself was quite reassuring. He was almost to the staircase when he locked eyes with Ava Winsbury, the only other Slytherin in the common room. His heart sank into his stomach when she smiled and gave him a small wave, she had
“That’s bullshit, that is.” Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t explain any further. If he had to go through the process of explaining that he didn’t want to eat, because that would awaken everything else in his body, he’d probably die from embarrassment.
She stood from her place and smiled down on Harry before walking towards the stairs. "Even if it's every night for dinner."
“Why do you dislike October?” Harry asked suddenly, startling Draco. Draco shut his book sharply and inhaled, trying to digest what Harry had asked. He rolled the phrase over in his mind until it made sense, and then allowed himself to process it a bit more to figure out how he’d word his answer.
And also, Harry was petty as fuck. Anyone would agree. Dead Sirius would raise a glass to that in his grave, if he had one.
their purpose.” Draco replied, giving Harry a pointed look. Of course the Hogwarts library books were helpful, if they weren’t, there’d be no point in them being there.
P.S. Omg I almost forgot! As a Christmas present (and again, if you don't celebrate, a normal gift instead) I bestow upon you, the very small and very short Draco Malfoy playlist designed to help me work on this fic. I do hope you like that too, and if you have any ideas on songs I can ask, you can comment or message me on either Tumblr (@drarryismyshit07) or Discord (DrarryIsMyShit#6083)
Harry nodded, seemingly unable to speak, and went in for the hug that Draco was offering. “I’ve a question, Draco.”
“But it’s Sirius’ birthday.” It felt like Draco was going off topic, and Harry wanted to scream because he thought Malfoy wasn’t taking him seriously, but he was too tired to even consider the possibility.
And it wasn't just the trip, it was literally everything else Harry had asked him over the past couple of months that had seemed to go completely ignored by the other party.
"We talked this morning, Harold," Draco chided as he turned on his heels. He stood at the door of the Manor, and Harry got the impression that he was about to apparate, so he called out again.
Hermione had already ordered plane tickets, and good ones at that, both of them wanting their friends to have the best possible time throughout the trip.
He stuffed his mouth full of food, not bothering to slow down. No one was there to watch him, no one was there to judge his every move. He could eat as fast as he wanted, he could eat as much as he wanted as well. He thought that, going by the previous logic, he could also eat as slowly as he needed to. However, everytime he tried, his anxiety had a wonderful way of making it sound as though hundreds of kids were seconds from bursting into the hall, and suddenly his moves sped up once again.
"Well, he's only just gone to Ron and Hermione's last week, so he'll probably be seeing us soon." Nevilled added as he began reading a Herbology magazine.
"Well obviously," he said hotly. He walked over and waved a hand in front of Draco's face. When he wasn't acknowledged, he picked up Teddy and gave him to Pansy.
"I've just got a letter. Sent by Hermione and Ron. I've only visited them last week, but Hermione's been insisting like crazy.
Harry loved Draco so much that it created aches in his chest. Harry loved Draco so much that a simple fond memory of the boy was enough to make him well up in tears from the overflowing abundance of joy Draco made Harry feel. Harry loved Draco so much, that he reminded the blond of that fact every day. Multiple times.
When he was sure there was no one else would come out, he opened the door quickly and flew into the room. He caught his breath and sighed in relief.
“Granger is under no obligation to tell you my business, Potter” Draco began. “And you’ve no right in asking, which is probably exactly what you did.” Harry backed a bit, put off at Draco’s sudden lecture, but he recovered and stepped up, clearing his throat and attempting to start again.
Sitting through Muggle Studies wasn’t that difficult. The oldest person there, aside from him, was a seventh year Ravenclaw who thankfully didn’t recognize him. The other people were a mix of two bored second years who wanted to take an “interesting” class. A brother and sister, fourth and fifth year, who were being forced to take the class by their parents, who were probably wizard-born and probably afraid of confrontation. Everyone needed to be clear that they didn’t support the works of the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord.
And when Draco noticed his overthinking and held Harry’s shaking hands in his steady ones, it always
Slowly, he stepped out of the car. He was thankful he hadn’t shed any tears in the car, because Draco was always obscenely quick to noticing them.
“Oi!” Harry said, and Draco felt rather smug at his string of insults, though deep down he wished they hadn’t been said. The ruder and more unkind he was in the day time, the more his nightmares would haunt him at night, reminding him of all the reasons why he, being not only a Malfoy, but
“Thanks,” he said shortly and walked as quickly as he could away from her. He thought to sit at the end of the table, but thought it might draw too much attention. He certainly couldn’t sit in the middle. The end closest to the professors seemed too risky, so he decided on a spot in the middle of the center and the end, on the side closest to the exit.
, Draco thought, though he wasn’t sure whom he was directing the insult at. Himself, for even mentioning such a thing to Harry, or Potter, who had mistakenly mentioned such information at the worst time. He rolled his eyes and began to turn away again, deciding that that day’s conversation with Harry Potter was over with.
“Five minutes,” he whispered. He gave a small bounce before flinging himself out of the door, knowing that if he didn’t do it then, he wouldn’t do it at all. He walked quickly and efficiently to the great hall until he hit the flood of human flesh.
It was as if he himself wasn't doing a single thing. His eyes were crying, his fingers were clutching to his mother's torso, his toes curled into the bottom's of his feet.
Draco smiled, his evil Slytherin heart hated to admit it, but he adored it when he was told he was loved.
He sighed and wished he could shut off his brain. He was done thinking faster than the speed of light, trying to anticipate the enemies next move in order to live another day. He shouldn’t have to do this anymore. The enemy was dead.
His hand tightened around his wand, clenching and unclenching. Open, shut. Open, shut. He was way too aware of his grip on his wand, way to aware that he couldn't protect Pansy and Teddy if his father came out of his hiding spot.
"Thank you, Draco. Continue, please." She said offering a small nod that went completely unseen by her child.
, just strange, though he didn’t enjoy being constantly on guard in case the man’s mood changed to an angry one. It never hurt to be prepared for something like that.
No. this wasn't right. They were enemies. Enemies don't help each other out, no matter if their wrongdoings were forced out of them. They were enemies. "We were enemies!" He said rising from his seat.
As weird as that sounded, it meant taking them grocery shopping and looking at kittens. Going to bookstores and watching movies at theaters. And
The room steadily filled with children, adults now he should say. Only twenty were there, of the eighty-eight, and he found himself very grateful. A mix of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors talked loudly as they came, making Draco uncomfortable. He hadn’t been friends with any of them, but he did wish he had the luxury of laughing and smiling on the first day of school again, rather than cowering in fear.
"What would you do?" Draco raised an eyebrow and made eye contact with the messy haired boy for a small fragment of time before putting his focus back on his plate of breakfast. Harry's eyes widened and he choked a bit on his pumpkin juice.
his book from Wilson’s arms, returning it to its rightful home in his robe pocket, where it’d be safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seemed rather rude, and he was
Draco found himself fighting over whether to out himself early on and ask a question, or hope some other non-Death-Eater student asked something for him. Some of his questions were answered of course, but the professor’s answers usually only brought about
"As always, Harry dear, I'm fine and well. Teddy however..." her voice trailed off as she looked up at the ceiling in the direction of Teddy's bedroom.
He remembered the exact way Potter's mouth had formed when he asked his question. He knew the exact hair that had fallen out of place when Harry showed him the box with the key. He knew exactly which of his green eyes reflected the light more during that time.
"Can I help you Draco?" Harry asked, his voice laced with annoyance. He couldn't help but be slightly aggravated at Draco's lack of reservation. He didn't understand how difficult it was to just... just answer.
I'm sorry for the lack of editing in part two after the "incident." as you know, ive been trying to post every thursday now, but i missed my own deadline due to stress! as an apology, i give thee a 6k chap that now takes up 15 pages in my google docs!
Draco had chosen a simple breakfast for the day, beans on toast, as well as the ever-classic pumpkin juice it seemed no witch or wizard could possibly go without. Rather than waking early and rushing to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, he’d waited for his fellow peers to wake, deciding to join them instead.
"What, may I ask, did he say?" Draco let out a dry sob, he was quickly realizing that his distressed mind couldn't actually remember the exact words. The hysteric thoughts zooming through his brain were going so fast, he couldn't grasp onto a single one.
Ronald Weasley sat in the booth near the window, next to the Granger-Weasley kitchen, eating his breakfast and trying to hide his recurring chuckles by stuffing his oats in his mouth. Harry was surprised his best friend hadn't choked, as the portions being shoved down his throat were large enough to fill Hagrid's entire half-giant mouth.
"Exactly!" Harry exclaimed, grateful that one of his friends had faith in him. A tenfold more grateful that it was Hermione, whom had a much better chance of changing the mind of Ron than even Mrs. Weasley.
Unfortunately, when it came to making such rash and sudden decisions such as that, he was weak. He shuddered at the thought, mindlessly wondering what his father would say at the notion.
They sat every morning, noon, evening, and night for all the meals of the day together. They bid each other good morning, noon, and night. They even watched little Teddy together on nights Narcissa just wanted to herself.
“Okay, that’s fine too.” Draco thought Harry was fine with too many things, but he was grateful that he was alright with Draco’s answers now. He wasn’t eager to expand on why he’d fallen victim to his own anxieties, and Harry was respecting that.
The slight happiness that had momentarily filled his usually depressed body diminished without so much as a trace. He shook his head and looked down, feigning a confused look. "I think I may have forgotten." He stated, getting a bit upset himself.
“I am,” Professor Wilson walked over to his desk and began to reorganize his belongings. Draco understood, because no one really wanted to be the entertainer to a boy riddled with anxiety. “It was quite the surprise to me and my family, but it was always fun to show them the things I learned.”
"I just didn't want to be stuck at home. I didn't want pass up the opportunity and risk being rude on top of it all," Draco whispered as he ate his food. Harry wondered why he seemed to be afraid of talking to loudly. Everyone else was nearly shouting and it was already hard to hear your conversation. What was he so worried about in the first place?
Distancing himself would be beneficial, for both parties. At least that was what he tried to convince himself, but to no avail. He was nothing but a teenage boy that missed his mother dearly, and the only thing stopping him from seeing her was his own selfishness.
eat, afterall, it was over twenty-four hours since his last meal. And he could always stay up and finish any forgotten assignments, seeing as he’d slept so much in the past day, he wasn’t really tired anymore.
Harry turned back to him. "Your room is cozy. I like it. Is it designed after the Slytherin common and dorm rooms?" Draco stood, door still open, much like his own mouth, staring at Harry intently.
He gave a small smile as a couple young boys and girls joined the house of Slytherin, but tried not to bring attention to himself. His fellow eighth years clapped and cheered for their own houses, as Draco figured they should. He only wished he could show his support better than a small, timid smile.
"Draco, dear," she swished her wand and Draco's face cleared of any signs of weakness immediately.  "Draco, what's this all about?"
Draco had emerald green robes, his hair was combed back and looked rather perfect in his opinion. He shrugged his shoulders, making sure to keep his head down. "Is it because you'll have to share a room with me? I won't do anything," he reassured quickly, his hands flew up defensively.
"You never answered my question from earlier. That's what I came in here to do, mostly." Harry said out of the blue after after a few beats of awkward silence.
A cold sensation poured over him, drenching every part of him. He shook his head and his eyes popped open. The man in front of him held a glass in front of his face. His eyes stared into his, and his hand held his.
He was remembering his godfather, Severus Snape, and how everyone was surely thinking him a hero now, but Draco remembered the days he’d been in Snape’s care as a young boy. The days where he was taught to master certain defense skills, or wouldn’t be allowed to eat dinner. The days he’d tried to get the attention of Severus, only to be thrown aside and reprimanded. God, it had felt so
Though he tried not to, he felt a sense of jealousy wash over him when he saw that the professor stared at the book like it was an old friend. He
The idea that the past year had been an emotional roller coaster that had the possibility of being nothing more than a faint memory for Draco disgusted him. All of this hard work he’d put in, and he wouldn’t even be more than a fond thought on a lonely night.
He sat forward contently, leaning his arms to rest on the table before him, and waited around for the remainder of Hogwarts students to finish their own food, which happened rather quickly after he did. Satisfied sighs and half-hearted shouts filled the silence until McGonagall cleared her throat and gathered their attention once again.
Nevertheless, he didn’t say anything. Better to not dwell on the happenings of previous years, of previous Octobers. Better to focus on the now, and on getting better, being a better and more empathetic member of society. Better to focus on being seen as
A few minutes passed, and he finished the pastie, but didn’t take anything else. Harry continued to stuff his face with treacle tart, occasionally pausing to sip his goblet of what was probably pumpkin juice.
however, as a birthday gift from me to you, i will be posting a special list of "Weird" Things That Draco Malfoy Does Now That He's Trying To Change on November 15th. Thank you for your kind comments and messages whether through tumblr or comments. they mean so much to me!
“Are you an eighth year?” Draco stumbled and his nose flared as he looked down on a short, chubby witch who couldn’t have been in more than fourth year.
And as he drove home from working, searching his stress-riddled mind for some sort of excuse that would grant him the option to return to his flat later than usual, he really wished that he didn’t love Draco Malfoy as much as he did.
That didn’t make much sense in Draco’s opinion, seeing as his father had said things completely opposite of that phrase; but with Harry’s hand on his foot and the curve of the circular window outlined against his back, he couldn’t bring himself to care much. Besides, Lucius was in Azkaban, and Potter was not. If that said didn’t say anything about morality, then Draco and his echoing brain didn’t know what did.
"Go! Go get Cissa!" Pansy stared at him, tears running down her cheeks. "Now!" She sprinted away without a word.
The lounge area at the front of his room, bean bags and blankets, were clean, yes. But there were games, both muggle and wizard like. A stash of candy laid in a wicker basket. How very stupid he was to not take the time to put away his childlike possessions. How stupid of him to even have them past adolescence! He was an adult after all. Much to old for such things.
"Oh yeah, she took me Nargle hunting a few months ago. She's been helping me... reconnect with friends from school. Non-slytherin friends."
"Whatever. What's wrong with you anyway?" Draco stared at Harry, looking him up and down in attempt to figure out the situation by himself. "You're louder than this."
Harry Potter was a difficult man to find when he was truly trying, which made perfect sense in Draco’s mind, seeing as their entire lives there was a power-hungry excuse of a man searching high and low for Harry  and a chance for revenge.
“Because Voldemort killed my parents, and then I killed him. Or kinda, that is.” Draco flinched at the name, and it felt as though his arm began to buzz. Draco spluttered for a second, rather impressed with Harry, as well as a bit startled at the ease in which he said the Dark Lord’s name.
was the question that left the mouth of The Chosen One. He held his breath for a moment, both in fear that he might say something sudden and abrupt and probably untrue and in deep thought as he decided how exactly to answer.
There was a long silence, and Harry felt an equal sense of comfort and tenseness in their tiny spot. Harry looked over and into Draco’s general direction, and debated on asking a question for what seemed like years.
He was so emotionally distraught that he looked sick, and God knows he mental state was far from healthy. "But I'd have to go with
Neville, who usually wasn’t one for conflict in general, had gratefully reentered the conversation, but Draco didn’t find it that easy. As subtle as possible, he kept his eyes on Potter’s movements, wondering what could  have possibly compelled the usually upbeat boy to be so sullen and angry. Hermione and Neville began to talk loudly again, seeming to forget about Potter’s sour mood for the moment; and in an attempt to seem present, Draco nodded his head along with their words, occasionally muttering a “Brilliant!” here and three to sell the deception.
"Whatever you say darling." It was starting to get late and Draco wanted to be well rested for his first day, so he excused himself and went to his room. Luckily for him, Potter was still in the common room. Draco got himself ready before changing into his pyjamas and getting into bed. He started reading a book and it was not long before Potter came in.
The whole school rushed at once to get to the doors. When only the 8th years were left, Pansy wondered out loud. "I wonder where we'll be sleeping?" Blaise looked at her thoughtfully before declaring "I have no idea." Draco sighed.
Draco joined Harry in a quick but intense staring contest in which he was sure he looked downright evil compared to Potter’s innocent stare. It simply wasn’t fair that he was so much better than Draco was, in almost every way possible. It had always been like that. From day one of Hogwarts, from day one in general. Perfect Potter with his perfect scar come to perfectly save the world.
It happened quite a bit, and Draco was usually always there to stop it. That had to count for something, right? That had to suggest that perhaps Draco held even the slightest amount of love for Harry, didn’t it?
"And then," Draco said dramatically, "he said: 'We were children.'" He stuffed an entire  chocolate frog into his thin-lipped mouth before guzzling down so pumpkin juice.
Also! The very last scene isn't as edited as everything else because I didn't want to bother my beta, so I apologize if it doesn't... feel like everything else!
But now Potter was a new person, he looked as if he’d been visited by a dementor. All of the pleasantness had been sucked from his body, leaving only an angry carcass in its place.
Harry glared at him, lifting his head just a bit, revealing the redness in his eyes that Draco must have missed when he was giving Harry a one-over.
They didn’t speak a word as they were transferred somehow (Harry chalked it up to magic) all the way to Godric’s Hollow. Harry thought there would be a sense of familiarity when he finally came to the very first place he’d ever called home, but there was nothing, and he realized that hurt more than any nostalgic feeling he’d thought would happen.
In fact, that was one of the few similarities with the two boys. Both of their two childhood friends grew up to date each other after Hogwarts. Actually, Hermione and Ron just recently got married.
usually got me tons of attention the first few weeks of school.” They were photographs, the square shaped papers. They were still photographs of the professor’s family it seemed, and in them, all sorts of foreign things Draco could only assume were muggle things.
"Just some... ideas of what to do. I wasn't sure if you had much planned." He answered, his voice still slightly above a whisper.
They nodded and everyone went back to their conversations, understanding that Draco wasn't in the mood for much of a talk. He sighed and continued eating; he may have been uncomfortable, but it was nice to have people interested in you.
Anyway, this was my first time writing... "anxiety/trauma/PTSD" I put quotations because I'm not sure if people actually read that and were like, "Oh, okay! Draco has anxiety/trauma/PTSD, makes sense." Or if they were like, "Damn, this basic ass bitch can't write for shit, aight."
“No,” he said, sighing at the answer he’d settled on. “Well, I suppose I don’t know.” He felt that was a better answer, but he also didn’t like the fact that he’d contradicted himself, something Malfoy’s didn’t do. And though that wasn't what he wanted to be known as anymore, simply another Malfoy, in this instance, in most actually, it was the persistent thought that ran through his mind.
No, in fact, Neville had been more than kind. He apologized for both the death of his aunt and the imprisonment of his father. And now the three of them had become "good" friends. Friends who talked about possibly real creatures and idolized the idea of plant growing then gossiped about young toddlers.
Professor McGonnagall, who he found seemed to be making a habit of catching him in awkward moments, stood there in front of him, exhibiting every ounce of her glory. “Oh, erm,” Draco started, giving his hands a bit of a shake, “Moring, Headmistress.”
“H-harry?” Hermione was the first to speak, and she tentatively reached a hand out to comfort him, only to be glared at by the angry raven-haired wizard. She withdrew her arm and looked at him with concern, then turning her gaze to Ron, who shook his head with confusion and shrugged his shoulders. Hermione rolled her eyes but nodded and slowly, she tried to restart the conversation with Neville and Draco.
Draco nodded, still keeping his no talking streak. Instead, he grabbed a handful of Every Flavor Jellybeans and picked through them, though never ignoring the boy.
Draco groaned and let out a small chuckle, not wanting to admit the humor in the sentence. “And I suppose it would be about all of the purebloods that didn’t deserve the cruel treatment I brought upon them?”
As Draco nodded Harry crossed the room and sat on his bed. It was squishy and soft and seemed to be perfect for sleeping on. He sighed a relaxed sigh as he bounced a bit.
Draco laughed quietly and tightened his hold around the blanket, allowing the silence to overcome them again. He turned slowly and eyed his bed, where his tea was growing cold and his book lay askew across his pillow.
If he felt in the mood, he’d conjure up a small sandwich and some water to quench his thirst and hunger, then he’d settle down again. His books didn’t have fascinating tales of dragon-fighting and magic duels. Instead they were filled to the brim with day to day muggle activities, and it seemed Draco could never truly get enough of it.
"This year we have two additions to our staff. Professor Connor Gray, who will be teaching defence against the dark arts and Professor Emma Gibson, who will be taking over potions." There was a small round of applause. Draco noticed that both teachers seemed to be quite young. He whispered the same to Pansy who shrugged, not really caring.
"He's sharing with LongBottom who has gotten incredibly fit over the summer." Draco teased while Blaise blushed.
"Come on. I'm going to pass out it I don't eat something soon." Draco continued complaining. Blaise rolled his eyes.
"I was not drooling." Before he could continue arguing, Headmaster McGonagall called all the attention to the front of the hall ready for the sorting to begin.
"I know dear, I'm just worried about you." She looked at him sadly. "Promise to be good and write letters to me. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Come on Draco," Pansy waved him and Blaise over to a carriage. Draco stared at the Thestral and it looked back with its big eyes. The Thestrals had never gotten this much attention but after last years war it seemed inevitable that so may people would have seen death. As they climbed into the carriage, Draco saw Harry Potter for the first time since his trial. He hadn't changed much but he seemed more adult-like. More isolated. The wind blew, blowing his hair into his face. He moved to push it away but stopped when he saw Draco staring. They looked at each other until Hermione Granger pulled Harry after her. Stupid Granger Draco thought but he didn't really know what had just happened. Maybe Potter didn't hate him after all. Why should he care?
"Now that we are all fed, you all need your beauty sleep ready for your first day. Prefects please take lead and 8th years stay here. I need to talk to all of you. Go on then, everyone get going. Goodnight."
He was doing Ginny and Neville a dishonor by overlooking the small sacrifices they had made by befriending him. Didn't they realize the costs of their decision? Surely, somewhere down the line, they too would be looked down on by the people of the Wizarding World. Surely they had thought about that. So not even bothering to consider their proposal was downright...
Finally, when things were just a little too tense and uncomfortable, he allowed the words to shoot off of his mouth before he could rethink his decision.
“And you’re sure it's nothing to do with your-” Harry took a moment to look around, making sure no one was eavesdropping onto their conversation. “-Your
His mind raced in and out between accusations towards his mother and thoughts of Harry Potter; and his dissociation was becoming deeper and deeper, so much so that the surrounding voices that had once sounded distant completely withered away. His memories swirled about in his brain, until he landed on a specific one from his childhood that he supposed
"If anything, Draco, Ginny could beat you up herself. She doesn't need a man, she's an independent, Gryffindor woman; who, might I add, is playing for the Holyhead Harpies only two years after an uncompleted education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
Pulling into the driveway, Harry tried his best to calm himself down. It was quite difficult, seeing as he’d gone nearly a year without having to do so without assistance.
Draco and Harry were nearly there, and Harry wanted to turn back and never return. He felt an immeasurable amount of guilt. He knew there was no need for it, because deep down he knew it wasn’t his fault; but he didn’t think he could live without placing the blame of his parents death on someone.
But they had never truly spoken to each other. In Harry's defense, Malfoy, and all that he had stood for, hurt and/or killed everyone he had ever loved or cared about.
be checking on him, and he had a feeling there were some interior motives. But when he finally pressed, Potter insisted that he only wanted to make sure he was alright, and upon Draco’s answer he left, only returning once or twice.
"And even if Blasie wasn't a first hand death eater, he's still got his stepfather's deaths to be accounted for. He could be brought to court any day for that!"
Harry knocked once more and Draco was able to confidently open the door and meet him, although he definitely didn't look him in the eyes. He was far too ashamed to do that.
He also planned on getting them all phones, or puppies, or both. He didn't exactly know just yet but he knew he definitely wanted to do that.
Maybe he'd do better asking Narcissa first, getting her opinion on matters always helped him before. Getting the input of any maternal figure in his life was very relieving to his traumatized mind, quite frankly.
His small corner of the room was just that, a small corner. And there were another nine beds in the room. The day before, he’d found a secret door that led to another room filled with beds. It was strange, having a second dorm room, but all too suddenly, the reality came crashing down. There were
When they’d awoken, Harry acted as though the sadness of the last day of October had never existed, instead focusing on the excitement of the new month.
he reasoned with himself. But he didn't need to think about Americans' use of trunks or not, because he. was. not. going!
. He supposed there was no point in complaining, seeing as his hair was just as bad, especially after he’d gone a few days without properly combing it through.
He’d gotten quite the tan over the summer, something he could honestly say had never happened before. He spent so much time reading in the sun, that his face and arms weren’t the pale color he was known for. They weren’t overly dark, but the change was noticeable. And noticeable was good in situations like this.
that the wizard before him was a muggle-born, but it didn’t stop him from wishing he’d gotten to experience the book like Professor Wilson so clearly did. “Pride and Prejudice,” he began, his voice full of surprise. “I’ll say, I haven’t read this one in ages. It’s truly a classic.”
.” They were mere feet away from the graves, and Harry was boiling. “Why was I so important?” He whispered, and it floated away into the cool wind. He whirled around to Draco, making the boy flinch, and he gave him the deadliest look he could muster. Draco took a step back, reaching for his back pocket, but Harry couldn’t care less. He spun back around and yelled at the top of his lungs:
“Was Remus already gone, underground? Did he celebrate completely alone, no one to remember anything with?”
, and as he repeated the sentence in his mind, allowing the words to roll over and over in his brain until they were perfectly smooth and he could imagine himself saying it in the most confident of ways, he began to believe it to be the truth.
"Draco, what could you have possibly done?" Narcissa kissed his head once more, "What was so bad that you feel you are unfit for companionship?"
coming?" Harry and Draco sat across from each other at the rather large dining table in the Malfoy Manor. Teddy sat next to Harry, feeding himself so porridge and babbling about nonsense that neither teen understood. Harry had on casual black robes with a Gryffindor scarf to protect himself from the cold. His hair was a right mess, per usual, and his glasses stood on the tip of his nose.
to school after everything he’d done. Then again, when had he ever thought straight enough to realize when he was making a bad choice? He was already at the school anyway, there was no chance of being able to leave unless something drastic happened.
"No, no. We aren't. I shouldn't have said couples. We're only going to share a room. In a hotel. In America. For the long weekend." Harry insisted.
Sirius Black was the only parent he’d ever gotten to know, and on the day honoring his birth, Harry could only think of how he had only screamed Sirius’ name, rather than try to save him.
Friends that didn't complain about being a Slytherin in these times of uncertainty, friends who didn't leave him because of his status or his disgusting tattoo.
After everything he did to that boy, how dare he. He didn't know how Harry could be so forgiving as to forget the previous seven years at school, but he was extremely grateful. He certainly couldn't bring himself to forget the horrid things he had done, forced or not.
“I don’t know Harry.” Draco didn’t sound annoyed or exasperated. He was replying to questions Harry had had for years with no one to ask.
Draco stared at him, his body language changed instantly. Instead of the usual straight back and folded hands, his body slumped over, hands running through his mane of platinum blond hair.
Unfortunately though, upon reaching the tower of the eighth year common room, he heard shouts of “Huffles call first room for the boys!” before seeing twelve or so wizards start to sprint for the door. The “door” of the Eighth year common room wasn’t really a door at all, it was a solid wall that, upon being touched by the right hand of an Eighth year, became a portal to the other side. IWith a bit of embarrassment, Draco could say that it was easily one of the coolest things about Hogwarts.
It was only when Draco was on the verge of giving up the search, and instead ready to sit down and ponder for a bit, did he find Harry in a darker part of a rarely occupied hall. It made him wonder how similar the two actually were.
Harry, also eager to change the topic of interest, smiled widely and began to talk of things he'd always wished to do as a boy. Hours passed before Harry returned himself to the Malfoy Manor. His stomach full and his mind hazy from his time at The Burrow.
"And I guess third year was all just a dream? Who was it that punched Malfoy in his ugly pure-blood face?"
Luna sat down next to him, put her arm around her shoulder, and pulled Draco into her. "You think Ginny might try to sneak in upon seeing him?"
“I’m completely fine, Potter. Thank you.” He answered shortly, wishing hard that he could just stare at the stars for the remainder of the night. For the remainder of the weekend, preferably, or perhaps even until the very last hour of the last day of October. He imagined how absolutely bliss life would be if he could watch the minutes of October slowly trickle away as he stared at the stars he’d always looked at.
“All that time, celebrating like nothing was wrong.” Draco could tell that Harry was getting emotional, the cracks in his voice and small pauses were a dead giveaway. “My aunt and uncle never told me, but that’s expected, I guess. Dumbledore, he didn’t either.”
Draco didn’t really understand much of what Harry had said, but he took a platter from him anyway, nodding as he did so.
"Harry, what is wrong with you?" Hermione had dropped her high-pitched voice of accusations down to a low, whisper full of threats. He took a few steps back and shuddered. Who knew his friend of nearly a decade could be so terribly terrifying?
Shaking his head as if that simple motion would erase all thoughts of death and family members, he opened it to reveal a large, brown, barn owl with a not so reasonably sized package tied to his feet.
"Harry's? No. I assure you." She began gently rubbing his head, pulling his platinum blond locks through her bony fingers. "But I of course knew something was aloof."
He remembered how Harry's face had fell when he didn't answer his question, when he walked away and kept on until he was sprinting in his own home. He remembered the faint, "Draco?" that had escaped the black-haired wizard's lips as he disappeared down the Malfoy Manor hallway.
"Oh, honestly, Ron! Ginny would've been his mother, James' love interest, isn't that correct Harry?" She turned her attention back to Harry and Harry nodded.
“And I’m sure your parents were rather cross when that happened, because Voldemort was just getting big, wasn’t he?” Draco nodded tentatively, but realized Harry couldn’t see him and tried to let out a verbal answer. All he could do was sputter out a choppy “I suppose,” - which wasn’t even meant to be funny, especially with the topic of conversation - and wait as his cheeks heated up uncomfortably.
She still stood tall and still when she spoke, but her facial features had softened tremendously, allowing Draco to see that she meant it. “I do sincerely hope this year can be of some relief to you,
“I suppose,” Harry said cheekily, then let out a loud burst of laughter so contagious, Draco joined in quietly.
professor who seems quite skilled I suppose. Of course, she’s not as good as your late godfather, as much as I hate to admit it.” Draco scratched his nose and looked down, waiting for the topic of conversation to change.
"Jumping to conclusions, never really had a problem? Hermione! Might I remind you that in second year it was you who made the Polyjuice Potion so that we could sneak into the Slytherin Dormitory." Ron said, ears red out of anger, not embarrassment.
"Well, I've never really had a problem with Malfoy, you two were the ones jumping to conclusions all of the time." She said matter-of-factly.
Everyone else was quiet too, and Draco was so very close to jumping into the fireplace to escape it. Whether it were to Floo home or to burn alive, he didn't yet know.
. That somehow Harry’s negative mood was his doing, and that a wizard on his way to becoming a friend was quickly becoming yet another enemy. Potter being his enemy wasn’t anything new, but it certainly wouldn’t help in his current situation. If Harry Potter, the most selfless man of his time, couldn’t find it in his heart to forgive a Malfoy, the rest of the Wizarding World wouldn’t even consider it.
"You will have a joint common room but rooms will be handed out in pairs. You will be on the third floor." Everyone started to look towards their friends. Pansy was looking slightly distressed however, because as the only girl Slytherin she would have to be separated from Draco and Blaise.
"Oh, you mean except me not being allowed to leave the house and mother being stuck at home with me and complaining about everything. Yeah, it was amazing."
Draco zoned out during this because if he was being honest with himself, he simply didn't care. He was only at Hogwarts to finish his education. He wanted to leave as soon as possible. Actually he don't want to be there at all. mother had forced him. He let him mind drift and it was not long until the sorting was finished. McGonagall called for silence again and addressed the whole school.
