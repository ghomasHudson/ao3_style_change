Pansy rubbed her hands, cracked her neck and said, “Let’s begin then. Never have I imagined a teacher naked.”
The girls remained quiet and when Draco looked up he saw the both of them in a staring contest, silently screaming at each other with their eyebrows. It was clear that Pansy had lost when she finally spoke up, “We want you to join us for breakfast on Saturday.”
And so Draco had found himself in the library three times a week, helping Harry with Potions. After that, getting physical contact had become fairly easy and the bond stayed at an almost comfortable level for almost a whole day each time.
Taking a deep breath, he stops that train of thought before he gets carried away while cleaning — again.
“Merlin, Dragon. I forgot how responsive you are.” Blaise muttered but Draco suspected that everyone heard in the absolute silence of the common room.
Pansy acted as though she had to think about that for a moment. “Would you rather shave your head or not be able to speak for three weeks?”
“Fucking finally. I don’t know how anyone enjoys this.” She leaned back in her chair and let her head fall back, closing her eyes and letting out a deep breath.
Draco unwrapped his presents with numb fingers and dread in his stomach. There was a buzzing noise somewhere but he wasn’t sure if it was real or if he was imagining it. The bond tugged at him, practically screaming that he needed to go to Harry NOW. But Draco dutifully ignored it and continued unwrapping. Narcissa had sent him his favourite french chocolates, beautiful silk and satin dress robes and magnificent cufflinks. But the silver cufflinks seemed dull, the satin seemed rough and the chocolates seemed to have no taste. Draco only longed for one thing and wasn’t it pathetic.
“I’m not that snarky anymore.” Draco claimed in an effort to defend himself.
“So I was thinking,” Harry started off.
Too afraid to get some food.
“Forget it, I-” Malfoy began and Harry realised that he had yet to answer the other. Hastily he interrupted “No, yeah… I’ll… help you.” He was eager to find out what Malfoy had planned. “uhm.. empty classroom on the second floor after dinner?” Malfoy only nodded before walking away.
Pressing his shoulder blades into the backrest, Draco thrust into Harry, who dug his fingernails into the pale chest, as the head of Draco’s cock hit his prostate. Gripping Harry’s hips even tighter, Draco thrust into Harry over and over again, the slapping of their skin mixing with their panting and their moans.
Draco only repeated that he did not have one, which earned him a punch into the stomach. The ropes kept him from keeling over like his body wanted to, and instead he felt his abdominal muscles contract, forcing all of the air out of his lungs. It was by sheer will alone that he didn’t cry out at the impact; the only sound audible was him heaving for air.
smoothly. Was it all a ploy?
Together they step onto the mat, face each other and kneel. Harry reaches his hands forward and lets his forehead touch the mat. Had someone told him two years ago that he would willingly be bowing before Malfoy, he would have hexed them. But he was bowing and so was Malfoy. They straighten up again and Malfoy smirks.
“No! This is just because you deserve some nice things in your life Draco. I can see that you’re trying to get better darling and I don’t think forcing you to this party will help with that. If you feel up to it I am more than happy to see you there, but if you don’t that’s perfectly okay too. You know best what you can handle. I just want you to be happy.”
Harry woke to water in his face and a throbbing feeling in his arm. Reflexively he grabbed his wand from under his pillow and pointed at the attacker. Moments later he recognized his attacker to be none other than his unfortunate bed mate. “What the hell Malfoy?” he sputtered, looking around to see it was still dark outside.
Draco had to admit that it made sense. Realising that they were nearly at the classroom by then, he quickly told Pansy to keep it secret, even from Blaise. They entered the classroom just as Pansy promised her silence.
“Soft limits?”
“What? No. We never…” Harry clears his throat. “We never got along. I haven’t seen him since we graduated.”
Fair warning for: references to disordered eating, anxiety and some hints for past abuse. (Also BAMF McGonagall)
“While that is nice to hear, that’s not what I was referring to Mr. Malfoy. If I were interested in your class standings I would have asked my dear colleagues. I am interested in your emotional state, and frankly put, your life outside of course work. I know it might not be my place but I noticed some instances and have wondered why you haven’t come forward with them.”
Without a second thought, Harry laid down next to Draco, their shoulders and arms touching. The hospital bed was a bit small for both of them to lay on their backs and Draco felt so good lying next to Harry, that he could only keep up his farce for a few seconds. He turned on his side, facing away from Harry and mumbled, “Fine, have your cuddles then.”
The smell of flour, chocolate and fresh fruit engulfed him and Draco felt at home. He had worked hard to build his own little shop and now, 5 years after opening, his bakery was a set fixture in the neighbourhood.
Draco fidgeted with the strap of his bag until he became aware that all eyes were on him. “Uhm.. I need to talk to you about my parole meetings.” he opened, all courage leaving him instantly. Desperate, he turned to Pansy standing slightly behind him.
Nodding at her suggestion, Draco took a moment to think about possible questions. In the end he settled on the most pressing, “What do you already know about me?”
“I know it’s not a real dinner, but it’s better than nothing,” Draco admitted.
The darker man chuckled, “No. Mother wasn’t keen on pronouncing happy news as her husband had just died in a tragic accident.”
“You’re smart, right?” he asked while nudging Draco with his elbow.
“Won’t last long — so close— ” Draco panted against Harry’s lips, which only encouraged him more. He buried his lips in Draco’s neck, sucking at the soft spot behind his ear. Draco brought his hands down, grabbing Harry’s arse, feeling the muscles in his back work, and encouraging him to keep going.
Another look around the common room and still no Potter. A tempus revealed that there were still three minutes to go until their arranged meeting time. Draco felt his knee bounce.
“That is mostly my hand and sometimes my foot too, and only if I want to keep lying on the floor. The impact energy has to go somewhere and so I let it go into the floor. Look.”
Blaise just shrugged it off. “I’m not even sure he was my father, don’t even know if mother is certain about that fact.” Seeing the shock on his boyfriend's face he continued, “It’s fine love. I don’t miss him and I have no need to know. It’s your turn by the way.”
“This wasn’t the first time you’ve been beaten up, was it?” Hermione asked once she finished the third diagnostic spell. Contrary to Pansy snapping her head to glare at Draco, Hermione was calm and collected.
his brain objected.
And he had disappointed Pansy — yet again. No matter how often he promised himself – promised her – that he wouldn’t let her down again, he always did.
Julia is the first to answer, “Stop fighting, face each other and bow.”
Harry woke to a gift at the foot of his bed on the morning of the 21st. He glanced around the room and saw that the others were still asleep. He pulled his bed curtains close and untied the silver ribbon.
It was late afternoon when Harry really realised why Malfoy had been so scared. Not only had his moaning disclosed that he liked Harry, but that he liked
‘Euphemia with son James Potter, Summer 1964’
“Listen. You… don’t have to do this. I know Pansy kinda forced you into this.” Draco shut him up with a raised eyebrow, hiding his nerves behind the haughty exterior of his mask.
Another reassuring hand on his knee, Pansy’s this time. “I’m proud of you. Should I take over this turn or are you up for it?” Draco only shook his head and pulled his feet up into the armchair, hugging his knees. He was vaguely aware of Pansy daring Hermione to rip a page out of a book and to not reparo it for the rest of the evening. He closed his eyes and focussed on his breathing, blocking the others' voices out.
“Shut up, you need more contact.”
Draco had not noticed, if he was being honest. He had been so caught up in his attempt to disappear from view, that he hadn't noticed a lot of anything. All his thoughts had circled around his past and future, his parole, his classes and the fastest way between each of them in a desperate attempt to try to avoid any and all people. Not getting noticed apparently also meant not noticing either.
In one of the chairs across from the ornate desk sat a friendly looking, middle aged woman with dark hair. The chin length bob swayed as Healer Hayes stood up to walk towards him. Her pastel orange robes complimented nicely with her brown skin and when she stopped in front of Draco, she was almost two heads smaller than him.
“Meals were the worst. I could hide in my room or on the grounds most days and would be left fairly alone, but I had to come to meals. And everyone else was there too.” Another pause while they descended a flight of stairs.
Draco found himself almost looking forward to their study meetings. That week's ancient runes text was surprisingly difficult, even for him, and he wanted to discuss it with Hermione once he had the chance. On top of that, his body had finally realized that he was in no danger from anyone in their little group and the social interaction had finally stopped draining his energy. He had even managed to chime in with a little joke when he had walked by Hannah and Blaise in the common room on Tuesday. The look of pride in Pansy’s eyes had been lost on him though.
This chapter deals with slight references to disordered eating, insults/verbal threats and anxiety attacks/social anxiety.
“Uhm.. truth I guess” he chose.
Within moments, sleep found him and he drifted off feeling more relaxed than he had in months.
Draco could practically see the confidence leaving Harry’s body when the man came to an abrupt halt just in front of him. Grabbing his hand, Draco pulled Harry onto his lap. “Don’t worry, we’ll go slow. I won’t hurt you” he whispered into the other’s ear and then gently kissed him again.
So he stopped walking too and repeated, “Harry is my boyfriend.”
Harry nodded solemnly, “I know. I thought so too.” They stood in front of Dragon Cakes and Coffee for a moment, their silence becoming awkward.
Draco could feel himself getting close to the edge but he wanted to feel Harry come undone before him. “Touch yourself,” he moaned, desperation making his request less demanding than intended, but Harry complied nonetheless. The sight of Harry on top of him, fisting his hand over his own cock would be seared into his mind forever..
The stress of the upcoming NEWTs was nearly tangible in the 8th year common room. The table they used for their study group meetings was almost permanently covered in books, parchment and scrolls upon scrolls of notes.
It was only because of his obsession that Harry noticed Malfoy struggling in DADA two weeks after the palm reading lesson. They were studying the Patronus charm and although Harry had taught it to the majority of the class before, they were going to focus a few lessons on the charm nonetheless. So while Harry listened to a lecture he could hold himself, he let his eyes drift towards the platinum blond hair three rows away, trying to come up with a reason for the others' almost friendly behaviour weeks ago.
Draco finds a solution to his food problem and starts socialising a little bit.
Neville and Susan murmured their agreement and just before Blaise could ask the next person, the portrait swung open and Harry Potter stepped into the common room. Instantly Draco felt on edge. He had of course seen Potter in class over the last two months, but he still hadn’t managed to sort out his feelings regarding the saviour.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up on their own accord. “Oh?”
“How was the death-day party?” asked Hermione.
“Was about time you came to that conclusion.” She said with a laugh. “Anything in particular you need help with?” To Draco’s surprise the Gryffindor simply said that he needed help with all of it, having never properly understood the basics. To Draco’s horror he heard Pansy say, “You know, Draco is quite brilliant with potions and he is also the one who probably has enough time to actually explain it to you.”
Pansy came to his room like she did after almost every meal. Draco was still incredibly grateful for her and the meals she brought up for him. With the steady supply of food his body had finally been able to recover somewhat from the malnourishment of the past months. He was still too skinny, but he at least couldn’t count all of his ribs anymore, not without consciously trying to. Between the regular meals and actually sleeping at night (at least most nights) Draco looked healthier than he had in a long time. His body was still mangled and he still radiated fear when he walked the Halls, but in the security of his dorms or even the 8th year common room, he actually looked something close to happy at times.
“Can’t you just go to your fucking manor if sharing a bed bugs you this much?” Harry found himself asking hopefully, although he knew that Malfoy indeed could not go back to the manor. The ministry had confiscated it along with most of the Malfoy funds for the time being.
“You know, you could always come to lunch? Far easier, really.” Pansy mused, watching him expectantly.
Draco saw the sparkle in her eyes and knew he could trust her. “I- Truth”
Granger immediately piped up. “It is so fascinating though?! So many different nuances and details that need to be taken into account. And so much to learn from the texts!”
“Pathetic. You skipped the whole hand shape and according to you I don’t even have a heart line. But I guess you really do think that.” Before Harry could take another look at the heart line (he had completely forgotten about that one), Malfoy pulled his hand away and beckoned Harry to place his hand on the table. “Let me show you how to properly do this.”
Pansy saw Draco and leaped out of her chair, “Draco, could I ta–” she stopped herself, concern growing visibly, “Are you alright?”
“Wh-.. What? I-...” Draco had dropped the shirt he had been holding. His eyes darted across the room, his body was tense,“Why didn’t you wake me then?” Malfoy demanded.
“Never have I ever had gay thoughts.” He stated, raising his shot in the general direction of Draco and Pansy.
Before his mind could run too far Granger spoke again, “We are planning a party for Saturday after the Halloween feast. It’s only us eighth years, mainly the study group, so we were planning on just having the party in the common room. Don’t get me wrong, you are of course very welcome to join in on the party, but I wanted to warn you about it, because Pansy mentioned that you don’t really like gatherings right now and I… I kind of noticed that too, to be honest. So whether you will be there or not is completely your choice, but know that you are indeed very welcome if you’d like to join.”
“Draco! You’re here!” Harry jumped up and ran to gather Draco in a tight hug. “How was your mind healing session?”
“No need. Those were… rewards.” Blaise gestured to his wrists with his chin and then winked at Draco. “Apparently Neville thinks we look fucking hot together.”
The moment he left, Draco felt his absence as if losing a sense, though the places where Potter touched him still felt warmer than the rest of his body.
you. The spell is only triggered if you say ‘Never have I ever’ and wears off the moment you leave the circle.
Harry lifted his head at his words and frowned. “No it’s fine, I can take the couch, this is your flat.” he tried to reason but Draco wasn’t having it. He showed Harry the bedroom and tried not to watch as the man in question stepped out of his jeans and scurried under the covers. Satisfied that Harry was safe in bed he went to turn.
In hindsight I realise that I used my standard description of separating a person and their brain. I use this technique quite a lot, when trying to explain mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression to people who don’t experience them. I as a person might rationally know that I have people who care about me, while my brain tells me that everyone secretly hates me/is laughing about me behind my back.
“You’re wrong. I could have. I do know…. I- I saw it. Or well some of it.” Dark hands scratched a dark neck and then all air left Potter all at once, “I sometimes had visions from Voldemort’s perspective, and I saw some of the shit that happened — what he did to you… I should have known it might shock you. I’m sorry.” Potter admitted, still stumbling for words.
“Does leaving for Hogwarts count?” Potter asked in return, which Lisa resolutely didn’t count. “It has to have nothing to do with Hogwarts,” she said.
and presses his thumb tendon against the pulse point. Using his own momentum he pulls Malfoy close onto his chest and, remembering his own pin-down, hooks his legs around Malfoy’s, effectively pressing them together from head to toe.
After 15 minutes of rolling around in the empty feeling bed Harry sighed, reluctantly sat up and settled into sitting cross legged on the covers with his back leaning against the headboard. He closed his eyes and focussed on his breathing.
The warm water of the shower had temporarily calmed him and had helped with the hair situation, but all of that calm was about to become undone again — he didn’t know what to wear. Going back to his school uniform would be stupid, they were done for the day and besides, his robes were still wrinkled anyways. Nothing a good ironing charm couldn’t fix but still. There was no need to rub his Slytherin-ness into their faces.
The walk to the seventh floor was spent in anxious silence. Neither knew where to start and Draco’s mind didn’t have the capacity to think on it either.
Draco shrugged and simply slid one hand up to Harry’s head to play with his hair. It was one of the most effective ways to calm him and Draco had the feeling that Harry needed some calming right then. He just hoped that Harry had thought about what his little stunt would mean for the both of them.
“No, not everyone has one, but most people do. You definitely have one though. Do you see how your heart line entwines with another line for the first part? Crossing each other multiple times but not staying together until your heart line curves upwards? You will meet them long before you love them. The curve means you’ll get together once you openly communicate your love. That in combination with the fact that you have earth hands and your only emotional marker being lower Mars means you are too stupid to realise your own emotions.”
Why he even bothered worrying about the git was beyond him, it’s not like they had agreed on a set date when he would visit again. There was no reason for him to flip his shit when the saviour didn’t visit for 10 days. It hadn’t even been 2 weeks, just because Harry had come around every 3-5 days in the past weeks didn’t mean he would continue to do so. “Get a grip Draco,” he chastised himself and kept cleaning, stoically ignoring the hard on he still had.
The Room of Requirement was thankfully void of any pink or frilly hearts. Some of the seventh years had thought it necessary to decorate the castle for Valentines day, and Draco had taken one look at the small glittery hearts falling from the ceiling in the Great Hall before quickly turning around and leaving.
AHH my ever beloved alpha/beta/cheerleader/friend Monika finished editing all the chapters SO: have another one in celebration! I'll probably upload another one before the weekend, but we'll see (Screw regular uploading schedules, am I right?)
Tentatively, Harry placed his free hand on Draco's lower back and traced his tongue against his lower lip, asking permission. Draco responded instantaneously, his hands came up and pulled Harry in closer so their chests were mere centimeters apart. He parted his lips and deepened the kiss.
That night when all his dorm mates were asleep, Draco took the dark blue parchment and the pictures out of his bag and under the light of a very dim lumos, he bound them together with a silver ribbon.
proud. But I doubt that you actually believe in the ideals they had. Do you know why I think so?”
“But… I used to be such a piece o— such a hateful person. I bullied so many students, and spread so much hatred.” Draco felt his eyes prickle with unshed tears but he didn’t allow himself to cry. Not in front of McGonagall.
No one said anything, all just staring at Hermione intently. A few moments later she and Pansy walked the circle, casting the mentioned charms. When they sat down on the cushions indicating their places, a shot glass filled with Firewhiskey appeared in front of each player.
As promised, there was a spellbook text, copied neatly in his mother’s clear cursive. The distinction between book text and his mother’s annotation made clear with a simple change of handwriting. Reading through the instructions twice, Draco wondered why his mother never went into spell invention. It was clear how much thought she had put into this simple spell, taking maintainability and magic levels into account so as not to drain magical energy to keep up the spell.
He bumped his knee against Pansy’s, glanced at Blaise and raised an eyebrow. Pansy only shook her head.
“Look, I know this is weird, but… I am just so tired of all this fighting and all this… hate. I don’t hate you Malfoy and I certainly don’t wanna fight with you. All I want is a single quiet year at Hogwarts and to pass my bloody classes. If that means spending time with you so that I can finally understand Potions then so be it.” The shrug of the shoulders was surely meant to look indifferent but Draco saw the nervousness behind it.
Draco sat on the opposite end of the brown couch Potter was occupying and pulled his knees to his chest. A little voice in the corners of his mind commented that someone must have taught the Gryffindor some emotional intelligence, as the man sat silently with his eyes trained onto one of the many magical windows, leaving Draco with a semblance of privacy to pull himself together.
Even aside from their opposing sides of the war, there is quite the history between our Saviour and his boyfriend. Multiple classmates described the pair of them as ‘bitter enemies’ (previous to their last year at Hogwarts), with an animosity that led to several physical alterations between the two of them, and even rumours of near deadly battles. It is shocking to see the two holding hands in Diagon Alley.
Another Tempus showed that he’d have to choose quickly, he only had 5 minutes left. Deciding that the dress robes were far too formal for a simple study meeting while the training gear was way too informal and unfitting, the latter also defeated the purpose of not screaming Slytherin with his clothing choice. “Muggle attire it is.” he thought to himself. He quickly grabbed the grey jeans and the slighty oversized dark blue jumper and put them on. A quick glance into the mirror told him that he was indeed presentable. He briefly considered pulling his hair back (it had reached his chin) but not only would that leave him with a nasty hair tie wave for the next day it would also defeat the purpose of the shower. Plus he could hide behind his hair when he got too uncomfortable.
“Harry. There is no such thing as ‘being out’,” Draco said, “Not completely at least. I only came out to my mother over Christmas and I don’t think most of the school actually knows or cares about my sexuality. Pansy and Blaise have known for years of course but they don’t really count, do they? Point is, there will always be people I am not out to, for whatever reason. Even if that is only because they don’t know me.”
Malfoy seemed to have understood, as he reached for the Firewhiskey, refilled his shot, drowned it and refilled again. “Never have I ever saved the world.”
“Thought so. There’s too much old damage in between the fresh stuff. Some internally bruised joints and a few bones that haven’t healed correctly, but I doubt that those need to be reset if they don’t bother you right now.”
Draco tried answering, but he couldn’t, the tightness in his throat keeping him from making any sound. This time it was Pansy who stepped in for him.
“Hey Pansy, are we still set on meeting this afternoon?” Hermione asked between bites of toast and eggs. The Slytherin witch simply hummed her agreement into her tea cup and Hermione turned to Draco. “We were planning on talking a bit about how growing up wizarding/muggle might have influenced our way of facing problems. You’re welcome to join if you want?”
“yeah… she’s a great listener and I needed someone to help me make sense of my feelings without judging me for it...” Harry kept his eyes on his nearly empty plate while he said this, fidgeting with his mug.
“The hair. The colour. The piercings. All of it. It suits you. I realized I never told you.” Harry clarified.
Draco sneaked a glance at Harry (after pulling his jumper back on), who was still looking dishevelled and half asleep, and pulled together all his courage. “I’m meeting with the girls for breakfast, you want to come?”
Pansy accepts his outbreak with a sad look in her eyes and then simply catches him up on the latest gossip while he eats.
Draco found himself following her into the office space adjacent to the classroom, settling into the armchair across from her desk. Moments later there was a cup of tea and some biscuits in front of him. He nibbled on one, trying to ignore the silence and the stern eyes watching him.
“Well in that case
Draco watched in wonder as Harry proceeded to take out comfort food after comfort food, peppered with his favourite Hogwarts kitchen specials. With a jolt he realized that Harry had known exactly what to ask for, and was touched that Harry knew him well enough to know his taste. Once Harry had unpacked all there was, Draco reached for one of the muffins that was recommended by the house elf. While he was planning on eating something more proper after, he could really do with the sugar and comfort right then.
“Episkey isn’t enough”
Draco hadn’t looked forward to his scheduled potions tutoring with Potter in the slightest and sitting across from the boy wonder, who was somehow unwilling to look at him, he knew why.
“Look at him, he almost looks like that bastard too.”
“Uhm. Yeah.” Draco admitted and told the group the gist of his hair, piercing and tattoo adventure, mentally making a note to thank Hermione and Pansy for going to McGonagall about Morris once he was alone with them. The compartment door opened just as Pansy demanded that Draco show them his new tattoo.
During the group revision of their last potions lecture they had started an in depth discussion on the difference between minced and crushed adderfork tongue, up to the point where Pansy had to remind them that they didn’t even use adderfork tongue in that class and that they should move these types of conversations to a more private setting, where they wouldn’t confuse any more poor students.
(See the end of the chapter for
On the inside Draco fretted that holidays spent reading potions books and visiting a friend for a day or two shouldn’t count as someone’s best holiday season, but he knew about Harry’s homelife now and how he usually spent the holidays in the castle. While Christmas at Hogwarts wasn’t all that bad it clearly didn’t compete with spending it with a loving family. Still he couldn’t refrain from commenting.
Pansy dropped her attitude and sat next to him, giving Draco a one armed side-hug, “Halfway there is amazing progress darling,” she tried to reassure, “Of course I’ll bring you some food. Any requests?”
“Used to being the key factor here Mr. Mal- Draco. Let me ask you a question. Did you want to be a death eater?” The gentle tone of her voice tore a gasp out of Draco.
Normally Harry would have been delighted with the situation. He didn’t have to go to the Burrow, didn’t have to face Grimmauld Place, he didn’t have to deal with  the hero-worshipping there would have been if they had decided to stay in a wizarding place, and thanks to McGonagall, they were even allowed to use magic inside the cottages. It was ideal.
“You can. Though the moment it becomes too much we’ll go back to the dorm, okay?” She gently pressed his shoulder and they kept going, joining Hermione who had waited a few steps ahead.
There were dark bruises when Draco opened his shirt.
His bisexuality hadn’t been the reason they had broken up; they had simply fallen out of love. The year spent apart had changed them both, and they each grew into different people and Harry liking men too had only been a contributing factor in that. Ginny hadn’t seen that at first, not understanding how they could have fallen out of love. She clung so desperately to the idea of them together that she had grasped onto every argument, and later every threat she could find, as a way to get him to stay. But when she had nearly outed him — that was the final straw. She had apologized, later on, but Harry still couldn’t really forgive her.
The fourth floor in the Western tower was guarded by a landscape painting. The beautiful scenery of a sunrise in an English countryside wasn´t as effective as the hidden entrance to Slytherin, but since it was activated only by the magical signature of the “8th year students” as they were called, there was no possibility of anyone entering without permission.
“Isn’t that the point my dear?” Narcissa asked gently, cupping his face. “You don’t need Lucius’ approval, nor do you need mine. Be the man you want to be, do what makes you happy. That’s all you need.”
Exchanging a questioning glance with Harry, Draco answered, “Only that you look lovely in that shade of blue. It brings out the golden undertones in your hair.” Flattery was always an option and he wasn’t even lying, the blouse did look great on Hermione.
“It’s more of a feeling than a state of mind,” he spoke softly. “At least for me. It… It starts just above my navel, as if I swallowed a tiny ray of sun and it warms me from the inside.” Harry closed his eyes, pulling up the feeling he got when casting a Patronus. “It spreads, warming my whole stomach before it reaches my chest, where it starts to almost feel like a comforting hug — a fluffy blanket warm and safe around my shoulders.” Harry revelled in the feeling for a moment and then continued.
Stepping out from the official apparition point of Kings Cross and onto Platform 9¾ took a huge toll on Draco. While he had mentally prepared for the thrum of students and parents, the crowd seemed larger than anticipated, especially after the quiet of the manor where he had become accustomed to not being around people.  With his left hand fidgeting with the hem of his comfort sweater, and his right pulling his trunk along, he made his way onto the platform.
Reality hit him like a brick and he went still. Harry hadn’t come to kiss him of his own volition. It was a dare. To top it all off, Harry was absolutely pissed, and the chances of him even remembering the kiss the next morning were slim to none. A single tear slid down Draco’s cheek, and he tried to push the Gryffindor off of him. But Harry wouldn’t budge, instead he held on, mumbling something incomprehensible. Accepting his doom, Draco let him be and looked around the room.
“I was thinking we could brew a pepper-up. It’s fourth year material so not the easiest there is, but I still think you can do it.” he said in favour of a greeting when Harry entered.
Shaking hands reached for another biscuit. Draco took his time eating, hoping to sort his head. “Mother is nothing like him. I hate that he pulled her into this mess. I hate that she still loves him, even though he pulled us into this.”
Newspaper Clippings of what the future holds
Realising he was staring, he averted his eyes just in time for Pansy to put down her quill and push her parchment away.
Draco snorted,
He felt himself getting dizzy, his heart pumping way too fast and all his nerves on edge. He hurriedly capped his ink bottle and threw his stuff into his bag. With wobbly legs he practically ran from the library, the laughter of the Gryffindors trailing behind him.
“Professor?” Draco asked. The rest of the transfiguration class had already left and McGonagall had busied herself at her desk. At the sound of his voice, she looked up.
“Obviously,” drawled the other without looking up.
“Truth or Dare. So what will it be, Potter?”
All four of them did.
“Ahhh…. In- ahh… Inside me!” Harry moans and Draco chuckles, his gaze swiftly checking Harry’s bound wrists. They’re slightly red, from struggling against the rope too often but nothing too bad. Draco opts to keep them bound for the time being and focusses back on prepping Harry.
“Yes, Draco.” McGonagall spoke softly, Draco had almost forgotten she was there. “I asked Gemma here because I trust her and because I think that conversation based therapy is something you could greatly profit from. However, if you feel like either Gemma or the style of therapy are not a good fit for you, that is perfectly fine and we will look for a different option.”
On Saturday morning Draco found himself once again being dragged towards the Great Hall for breakfast. It was way too early but after how hopeful and proud Pansy had sounded after the study meeting on Thursday, Draco couldn’t bring himself to shoot her down. He had promised to try and this was him trying; keeping his promise. Hermione joined them in the Great Hall and listening to Hermione and Pansy bickering, Draco could almost forget his fears.
Instead of taking out his usual book and parchment, he turned to Draco and burst out, “I think I want to come out to the group today.”
“I’m going to kill him.” Pansy hissed and then turned to pace the room. Draco only caught bits of her murmuring.
Once again, Draco remained silent. Now wasn’t the time to tell Potter about the nights he had spent lying awake and half heartedly wishing to have died instead of Vince. If he thought about it with a clear head, he was glad too; glad that Potter had managed to pull him out of the fire. Despite the challenges life after the war posed for him, he was glad to be able to live it, and he was acutely aware that it was only due to Potter.
I just terminated my appartement, got accepted into the masters degree I was hoping for and got a confirmation on a job I've applied to. So in order to share my excitement, have this chapter, which just happens to be a GOOD one.  I promise.
“Draco? I heard-” he broke off, taking in the scene in front of him. Pansy was clinging to a half dressed Draco, while Hermione stood besides them, wand in hand and sporting a slight blush. “My, my, my. Draco! If I wasn’t absolutely sure that you’re gay I would congratulate you.”
“Due to the testimony of Mr. Harry James Potter, and the willingness of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall to assist in the implementation, the Wizengamot sentences the prosecuted, Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy, to two years of Parole under the condition that Mr. Malfoy agrees to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry to complete his education.”
A couple in fancy robes, laughing; titled: ‘Euphemia and Fleamont Potter. Summer 1957’.
Needing to stage run-ins with Potter twice a day without raising suspicion, seemed impossible, but somehow Draco managed it for nearly a week.  His inevitable doom arrived on Saturday, when Potter left the castle with Granger to meet the Weasel in town and didn’t return until long after dinner.
Restlessly he turned to the other side of his bed. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the meeting had gone
“So I was thinking,” Harry started.
“Welcome to
“Draco, you coming?” asked Pansy.
“Understand the basic arithmancy concepts” said Hermione to him and then added for Draco, “It’s because Arithmancy is really close to muggle math and that is a mandatory class in all muggle schools for all students.”
When they pull apart, Harry’s lips are swollen and red, his hair is standing in every direction and his cock is straining against his jeans. Both of them are panting for air. Always the reasonable one, Draco pulls back slightly, trying to get up, which Harry stops him from doing.
“I- It is. Yes.” His voice broke.
Their potion turned out fine.
A slight smile appeared on Draco’s still blotched face as he was once again reminded why he and Blaise were best friends, the man understood how to lighten any situation. A talent Hermione apparently didn’t understand as she began to justify and explain the situation, growing redder in the face.
Inside the Hall were only a handful of students. Two Ravenlaw Fifth years were sitting at their house table as well as a small group of younger Hufflepuffs at theirs. The Slytherin and Gryffindor tables were empty as was the eighth year table for now.
Harry cast a muffliato around them and they chatted away. Hermione nagged them about the potions essay until she was satisfied that both Ron and Harry had actually done the work behind it and then pulled her arithmancy book from her bag and began reading. So Ron pulled his playing cards from his bag and Harry and him played a few rounds of wizarding poker.
With his eyes trained on Harry, Draco thought that the wedding really couldn’t come quick enough.
“I… Yes. I do.” Draco stammered.
“I´d recommend a red wine. The pinot noir is especially fitting for your main course.”
A smirk appears on Draco’s face and with a slight shake of his head he admonishes, “Oh Harry. If I had wanted you to undress me, I would have told you so. Now, be good and watch me.” and Harry watches. He watches as Draco slowly reveals pale skin and lean muscles. His cock is throbbing by the time Draco pulls off the dark shirt and carelessly tosses it aside. Instead of starting on removing his trousers though, Draco gathers his hair together and puts it into a messy bun, anchoring it with his wand. Harry moans and pulls at his restraints again, Draco looks ethereal, sitting on top of him, wearing just his black trousers and grey eyes wandering over Harry.
“Me following you? Who is on whose fucking property Potter? You do realise that the manor is only behind the hills right? You are technically in my home. So go on, ask me again if I am following you.”
Draco had to admit that he had wondered about the influences as well and he said so to the both of them. “I mean, for example: arithmancy. You understood the basics so much faster than I did, most of the muggle-raised kids in our class did.”
“Do you think I’ll ever become like my father?” he asked with squared shoulders. His attempt to keep the fear out of the question was rather unsuccessful.
“Mr. Malfoy, I am by no means a professional when it comes to this but I would like to offer my help to you, not as your Headmistress or teacher but as a… confidante perhaps.  You are of course under no obligation to use my help should you not want to.”
“Rules are simple. It’s basically truth or dare but adapted to make it fair. First off: No choosing your next victim, we will spin a wand to discern who goes next. Second off: Every question or dare can be evaded by taking a shot. And third off, everyone playing has to take a sip of veritaserum.”
“Your sun and fate lines are both pretty deep but they are both interrupted? So I guess you are going to be successful and popular with breaks?”
As if it had been too busy to notice before, Draco’s brain finally processed the position he was in. His legs were on either side of Harry’s thighs with his knees pressing into the backrest of the couch. Harry had scooted forward a bit, leaving their chests only centimeters apart. The hands on his hips weren’t merely resting there but gripping him, trying to steady themselves. His own hands clinging to the mop of curls Harry called hair, clutching hard enough that it must be painful, but Harry didn’t complain.
“It never occured me not to, it seemed logical.” And there it was, Potter instantly proving him right. “Our lives have circled around each other for so long that it was just natural.” When Draco didn’t say anything Potter added, “I’m glad I did though.”
After a while the begging arose again, “Draco. Please. Please. I’m ready. PLEASE!” but Draco made no move to remove his fingers from Harry’s arse. Frustrated, Harry pushed Draco into the sofa, forcing him to pull his fingers out. Without any great preamble, Harry grabbed Draco’s cock, conjured more lube, and lowered himself onto it, moaning loudly. Draco threw his head back, moaning loudly as well , as the stimulation and the change of position hit him. Hands reached towards hips and he grabbed Harry as he tried to refrain from bucking up into him.
The scent of too much incense burning at once wafted into his face when Harry entered the Divination classroom. He wasn’t sure why he still took the blasted class; prophecies had already dictated too much of his life.
“What did most muggle kids do?” interjected Blaise, joining them at the table and sitting down next to Hermione. He shot Draco a reassuring smile.
“But not all of them.” Potter said.
“What about the Room of Requirement? That way we don’t have to ask Armado for permission and could use it whenever we want.”
A small cobblestone path led to the entrance of the little sanctuary Harry had booked for the next week, surrounded by evergreen bushes and leafless trees. Shouldering his bag, he entered the little stone cottage and looked through the rooms. There was a small kitchen, not even big enough to contain a real table, a bedroom containing a double bed and small dresser, and a bathroom. The largest room was undoubtedly the living room, with its rather disproportionate fireplace and huge windows.
On his birthday of all days, they called him in front of the Wizengamot to hear his sentencing.
When he woke up again the sun had shifted, shining bright enough that Draco thought it could already be lunchtime. He dragged his freezing body out of bed, wincing at the feel of his sheets brushing his skin and headed for the bathroom.  Four steps into the hall he collapsed.
“Congratulations, did it hurt?” Draco immediately interrupted which earned him a light tug on his hair.
“Alright, in that case I’ll give you a small run down of what mind healing can look like. Within magical mind healing there are several different fields specialising on different aspects or illnesses. The starkest difference is that there are so called ‘invasive’ and ‘non invasive’ fields of expertise, which differ in their used tools and methods as well as application of course. If you’re lucky, you’ll never have to really deal with the invasive specialists. They’re the only one’s sanctioned to use ‘invasive’ methods like legilimency, hence their name, and mostly deal with extensive curse damage or trapped minds.
Potter ordered a latte macchiato and a piece of the crumble cake and Draco promised to bring both to his table once the drink was ready.
Deciding that ignoring Blaise was probably the best plan of action, Draco simply countered. “I was hoping to talk to you to verify that I didn’t cause you any trouble with your… with Neville.”
After a moment Draco’s eyes went wide. “I said your name, didn’t I?” he asked, blushing again and it was Harry's turn to be confused by the question. Draco squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, steeling himself for what he would say next.
“She is a lot better now. It was just a flu, but at her age I didn’t want to risk leaving her alone with Teddy. He is a lovely child but Andy wouldn’t have found a moment of rest watching him.”
And suddenly Draco was almost bursting with the need to talk to her. “What you said about my parents last week… I- It-.. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.” He admitted.
Sunday, November 29th 1998, late morning:
They stood there in the empty classroom, Malfoy’s panting the only sound to be heard. Harry couldn’t move, couldn’t tear his eyes away from the anger-reddened face in front of him. After a few moments, Harry watched as Malfoy closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose with his right hand and suddenly the whole room was completely silent as Malfoy held his breath.
“Hey, could you maybe explain to me what we did wrong and why the dittany helped?”
Draco was glad that Potter didn’t try to touch him and only stood awkwardly at his side. He didn’t think he would have been able to cope if he did.
Instead of hanging around after class to talk to McGonagall, Draco followed the Headmistress to her office to use the floo. With all the studying, socialising and overall
Why the hell had Potter testified for him?
“Know? No. But you practically asked him permission before agreeing yesterday, so there must be something going on. So? Out with it. What’s your relationship to Neville and did I cause any trouble?”  Draco turned his back to Blaise to grab his jumper.
“That fucking asshole.” she hissed and closed the door with more force than technically necessary. Once they were alone, she pulled him into a tight hug, leading Draco to wince and recoil, the tears he had kept at bay beginning to fall again. Pansy pulled away immediately.
“Draco, I would also like you to know that I won’t accept any form of hateful behaviour, especially at that party. And that includes hateful behaviour against you, too. I don’t expect there to be any, but maybe knowing that someone would be there to back you up and support you, could help with your anxiety.”
Even hours after their impromptu snog, Draco’s head was still dizzy. He and Harry had spent another hour in the Room of Requirement, kissing and holding each other. At one point, Draco had sprung up in a haste, fearful of missing curfew; Harry had to remind him twice that curfew didn’t apply to them anymore. Nonetheless they did leave for their common room a little while later, their hands brushing against each other as they walked.
“I told you about me so that you know that I won’t go around outing you. I realize that you probably don’t even want me to know about it and I am sorry for overhearing it okay?”
“I’d take the three weeks of silence. I could still communicate via writing if needed, so not much of a disadvantage.” A shrug from Pansy indicated that she considered his turn done and so Draco turned to Blaise, who chose truth as well.
“Never have I ever been in the papers. By name or with a picture.” Hannah said, smirking at Neville and nudging him to drink. Draco downed another shot, observing as the rest drank. He had expected Blaise to drink but his shot remained untouched. Without thinking he said,
“That’s like saying that I killed him because I didn’t pull him onto my broom. It’s stupid and you know it. It was an accident.”
With quite a lot of people needing to be relocated rather quickly Harry supposed he could be glad things weren’t worse. McGonagall had organized multiple cottages for the older students seeing as they were capable of caring for themselves. The younger years were staying with the staff in the little hostel on the edge of town.
Hermione had pulled Harry aside after the lesson and chastised him so thoroughly that Harry actually kept away from Malfoy after that, even keeping the stalking to a minimum. Which is why Harry was actually surprised when Malfoy came to him two days later.
Granger, who had just a few seconds ago had been fully prepared to fight Pansy on her opinion, sat there and stared at Draco in shock.
“Room of Requirement at eight?” Harry proposed happily and Draco smiled and nodded.
The waitress appeared once again, switching their empty plates with the dessert, a mini chocolate cake and some ice cream on each plate. The cake was still warm and chocolate poured out once Draco took a spoonfull. The ice cream turned out to be a raspberry sorbet and some high quality vanilla ice. The mixture of the rich dark chocolate cake with the sweet and fruity ice was heavenly. Hadn´t he just had a wonderful full meal, he could have eaten multiple plates of this.
Malfoy was already in their classroom meditating when Harry barged in. Without any preamble Harry asked, “Are you by chance an Occlumens?” When Malfoy only nodded in affirmation Harry let out a relieved sigh, “Okay, then we need to work on that first. It could be that you are subconsciously blocking your memory from being present enough to trigger the charm. So you kinda need to drop your shields… or however that works.” In hindsight Harry regretted that he never got the hang of occlumency. A better grasp of it’s techniques would have been helpful right now.
Draco paused a second. Then, his face burning, he rushed to add, “I mean, they’re accompanying me so that I don’t… freak out again.”  Innerly wincing at the admission to his panic attacks, Draco turned an even darker shade of red.
“Maybe. But from the looks of it you didn’t even know yourself. Not the best way to come out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt himself blush. He shouldn’t be listening to this and above all he shouldn’t be
Overwhelmed with the sweet gesture, Draco hugged Harry a bit more tightly. “Thank you Harry. Really. This is exactly what I needed right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How can I hate him and love him at the same time?” Draco asked, hoping the older woman could help him make sense of his emotions.
Harry continued to come into Draco’s shop,  visiting at least once per week, and slowly ‘Potter’ changed to ‘Harry’ and ‘Malfoy’ changed to ‘Draco’.
When Draco had finally pulled his jumper over his head, Blaise had joined him at the sinks, to face the mirrors. The darker man had pushed his sleeves up to his elbows to wash his face and Draco couldn’t help but notice the faint bruises on his wrists.
In a much calmer manner he placed one hand on Harry’s neck while his other sneaked onto his lower back, pulling him closer and almost dipping him slightly. Gently yet determined he kissed Harry again, licking tentatively at his lower lip after a few moments.
Afterwards Draco had lain in Harry’s lap, not unlike the position he was in right now. They had caught their breaths and had a very awkward talk about their emotions and their relationship.
“You know, if you really want to come out, you could do a test run with the study group. You know they are not homophobic and most of them must be suspecting it anyways after the Never have I ever game.”
“I’m really sorry. I didn’t know what the spell did. It’s-... It’s no excuse. But I really didn’t know it would…” Harry broke off, unable to find the right words. “Do that.” he whispered in the end and gestured towards Draco's chest.
Later that evening Draco was rereading what little information he had on the bond. He had gone nearly 18 hours without touching Harry that day, despite fainting after only 12 the day before and it didn’t make sense.
That seemed to snap Harry out of his stupor and he looked down on himself. “Erm, sure. Just let me stop by my room and change real quick. Don’t really fancy wearing my uniform on a Saturday.”
“Obviously.”
His brain caught up to reality when Pansy got up and motioned for Potter to switch seats with her. Draco had just agreed to tutor Potter in potions. And Potter being Potter would definitely need more than a single study meeting to catch up. Merlin, when had Draco lost control enough to agree to this?
“Uhm… sure?”
Neither of them knew how long they kissed, only that they were both breathless and slightly dizzy when they finally pulled apart. Draco lifted his right hand from Harry’s chest and gently traced his cheek, before softly cupping it. He pulled Harry in for another kiss, almost chaste compared to the previous one and cast the incantation again, lips moving against Harry’s. Harry could feel the magic leaving Draco’s wand and, without looking, was certain that he did it, that Draco had managed a corporeal Patronus.
“-ie” Hermione mumbled, her face by then buried in her hands. Only removing them when Weasley prompted her to repeat. “Charlie. As in your brother, Charlie.”
Before his mind could blow his fear out of proportion though, Harry timidly said, “Yes, please.” and the butterflies spread from his stomach to his whole body. Happiness flooded Draco and he revelled in it, enjoying the feeling.
Extracting himself from Draco’s hug, Harry sat up and faced him. “I don’t know. But I’m sick of sneaking around like you’re my dirty little secret. It just feels wrong. I love you and I don’t see any reason to hide that.”
“Not at all Mr. Malfoy. I simply wanted to hear how you’re dealing with everything at the moment.”
The hands were still loosely holding onto his wrists when the sobs and shaking subsided. Potter sat on the doorstep with him, facing Draco and cradling his hands. There was no pity, no disgust or anything else Draco expected in his features. Just an understanding sadness and compassion.
Once they calmed down again, Harry admitted, “I kind of really want to kiss you right now.”
The boy looked at Potter who nodded and then back at Draco. “I am Teddy”, he introduced himself. Ah that would explain why he was with Potter but didn’t look like the other man. Draco remembered that the Gryffindor was named Godfather to his cousin.
With reluctance they pulled apart and by unspoken agreement they walked back to Draco’s flat, the anticipation prickling between them like electricity.
When Draco sat down across from Morris, the older man didn't even try to hide his scowl.
“I just wanted you two to stop avoiding each other. ‘Mione said he’s hiding in his dorm half the time too.”
“Like any unloved thing, I don’t know if I’m real if I’m not being touched”
Suddenly there is a hand in his hair, pulling his head back. The slight stinging on his scalp helps him focus. Draco is leaning close again. “The rumours -” Teeth are scraping lightly against his throat and another shiver runs along Harry’s spine. “- are they true?” The growl in Draco’s voice makes him aware of how hard he is, how hard he has been since he arrived really.
Draco’s hand reached for his shot glass, unwilling to talk about the war. But then he whispered “taking the mark” anyway. He chased the answer down with his shot but continued to explain his answer. The veritaserum gave him the words he normally was too afraid to say. “It was the beginning of the end for me. I mean I was a prejudiced asshole even before that, but after that there was no going back.” Realizing the gloomy mood around him, he stopped himself from saying more, filled his glass again and downed it.
Draco laughed, rubbing at the spot on his arm. “I watched you the whole time you were brewing, you did well and I took no risk testing it.”
Draco could only shake his head, silent sobs shaking him and making the pain flare up all over again.
A blush crept up Harry’s neck and cheeks. “uhm. I- Sorry.” he stuttered, and quickly cancelled the sticking charm and wards, but to his surprise Malfoy didn’t apparate away instantly, he simply stood there and watched Harry. Moments passed and Harry shifted uncomfortably under the calculating gaze. “You- uhm, you wanna come in? Could I offer you tea or something?” The offer was stupid and he knew it. With the manor close by, Harry doubted Malfoy would ever ac-
Draco nearly couldn’t believe his ears. “That’s all?” he asked in disbelief, “No comment about those horrid muggle trousers? Only that my impromptu haircut needs some cleaning up?”
“This may seem like a lot but we will start small. Everyone please kneel down, we’ll start from a lower height and work ourselves up. It’s more rolling than anything else.”
He didn’t take much notice as Pansy sat herself down next to him. She reached for his hand, gripping it tightly in hers, “Breathe darling. Just breathe”
Harry felt himself blush too. “Uhm… yeah.” he admitted hesitantly. To his surprise Draco started laughing.
From the moment he stepped on the platform he could feel people staring. Aiming to simply board the train as fast as possible, Draco kept his head down and headed straight for the closest door. He made it almost ⅔ of the way, before the whispers set in.
Malfoy silently stared at him for a few moments, then he spoke through gritted teeth, “That’s your big trick? A better memory? Did you honestly think that I didn’t know that? How many fucking content moments do you think I’ve had in my life, huh? After THAT!” Malfoy pointed to his left arm. His voice had gotten gradually louder until he was yelling at Harry.
“I might have a proposition for you, if the rumours prove to be true.” Malfoy says cryptically, leaving Harry to inquire what rumours the blond meant.
His mind was racing to catch up. In the last months it had felt like Professor McGonagall not only cared about Draco’s behaviour in the context of his parole, but also in the context of his future and health, both mental and physical. She hadn’t given up on him yet and seemed to actively be on his side, respecting his boundaries and fears.
Before he could think too much about it, Pansy spoke up, “Okay, so Blaise and Hannah are working on their History of Magic assignments, while Hermione and I are doing the Ancient Runes translation. I don’t know what you still need to work on, but we were planning to all go over Potions again in an hour or so. Depends how fast we get through our essays.”
1. We will all take turns making a statement that starts with ‘Never have I ever’ and if you have done whatever follows after that, you take a drink.
“That was quick. Thank you for telling me, and congratulations on figuring it out.” he reached a hand out to squeeze Harry’s knee for a moment.
’ he chanted like a mantra.
Of course, Draco had apologized before and Potter knew all of his story from the trials, but other than that they had avoided talking about the war. And maybe Potter was right, maybe it was time for them to talk. And maybe it was time for Draco to face another one of his fears.
He could see that Harry was trying to believe him, but the fact that he was still gnawing on his lower lip gave away that he didn’t quite manage it. Draco wanted to pull the lip from between Harry’s teeth and kiss it better. Presuming that that would take Harry’s mind off of the worries, he did just that.
